Revit Architecture is considered by many to be the best BIM solution in 
the international market. Autodesk acquired the company in 2002 and 
the Revit user base is adding hundreds of thousands of users annually. 
If you are studying at a university or work for a design or construction 
company, and have decided to use Revit Architecture, you’ve made the 
right choice.


This is a comprehensive book about Revit 2018 Architecture. It will 
not teach the reader architecture design, which is a pre-requisite for 
this book. It can be used as an instructor-led or teach-yourself text-and-­
project book to help master the basics of Revit 2018 Architecture.
••
We prepared two sets of exercises, one for metric units (mm) and the 
other for imperial (inch, ft).
••
At the end of each chapter you will find “Chapter Review Questions” 
that will help you test yourself.
••
There are fifty-seven exercises integrated throughout the book, to 
help the reader implement what has been learned.
••
Starting with Revit 2018, Autodesk changed the naming method and 
combined all of the Revit modules into a single product. So, when you 
buy the software, instead of Architecture, Structure, and MEP being 
separate modules, now one product contains all of them. Accordingly, 
this book teaches the Architecture part of Revit 2018.

ON THE COMPANION FILES


The companion files included with this book contain:
••
A link to the Revit 2018 trial version, which will last for 30 days 
starting from the day of installation. This version will help you solve 
all the exercises and workshops in this book. The student trial version 
can be extended beyond the 30 day period.
••
Practice files and projects which will be your starting point to solve all 
exercises and workshops in the book. 
••
Copy the folder named “Practices and Projects” onto the hard drive 
of your computer. In the Project folder, you will find two folders; the 
first is called “Metric” for metric units projects and the second one is 
called “Imperial” for imperial units projects.

Preface

Exercises


We prepared two sets of exercises, one for metric units (mm) and the 
other for imperial (inch, ft).


The companion files include both sets of exercises. Copy the suitable set 
to your computer before you start reading this book.


In the exercises, you will find the metric dimension first, then the ­imperial 
dimension within parentheses.


The numbers are not necessarily equal.


C H A P T E R1
CAD VS. BIM


CAD means Computer Aided Drafting:
••
When CAD was introduced in the early 1980s, it was revolutionary.
••
In CAD we draft; we don’t design or model.
••
A line in CAD software could mean anything! It could mean the outer 
edge of a wall, an electrical wire, or a hot water pipe.
••
In CAD, plans, sections, elevations, and details should be drawn in 
separate files. The collection of these files will be the design of your 
project.
••
The sheets are not interrelated by any means except in the minds of 
the engineers who designed them.
••
If one part of the project changes, the engineers must revisit all the 
related drawings and edit them manually.
••
In CAD, groups of engineers from different disciplines use primitive 
commands to share their designs.

●Creating new files and opening existing files
INTRODUCTION TO  
REVIT 2018

2 • Revit 2018 Architecture


BIM means Building Information Modeling.
••
This is the new approach to designing buildings.
••
BIM is based on the concept of creating your model in 3D right away, 
using intelligent elements like walls, doors, windows, floors, ceilings, 
and roofs. The user will not use lines, arcs, or circles.
••
Each element holds inside it an enormous amount of information. 
For example: a wall drawn in the Floor Plan holds inside it its height; 
hence, you see it in 2D as a plan, but when you visit the 3D view you 
will see it extending in 3D as well.
••
Some elements is in their nature to need a host, like a door and win-
dow need a wall to host them, and a lighting appliance needs a ceiling 
to host it.
••
The BIM approach supports Parametric, which means intelligent ele-
ments understand their relationships with each other; when one ele-
ment changes, the other elements connected to it will react accordingly.
••
The BIM approach supports sharing the model information across 
users. Hence if an update is made for one user, all the others will 
know about it.
••
All parts of the model are interrelated; a change in one part will reflect 
on all other parts. For example, moving one wall in the Floor Plan view 
will affect all other views; hence there is no need to go to each sheet and 
change it manually. Even the schedule views that hold the information 
of the quantities of the different parts of this wall will react accordingly.
REVIT ARCHITECTURE


Revit Architecture is the best BIM solution for architects in the interna-
tional markets these days.


Revit Architecture is based on the idea of creating your whole model in 
a single file containing all the architecture elements; even if your model 
is very big, it will be in a single file.


The Revit Architecture file will contain all the views of the 3D model 
that the user will create; hence floor plans, ceiling plans, sections, eleva-
tions, and schedules are all produced automatically.


Revit Architecture is equipped with sharing and updating capabilities, 
which is unparalleled in today’s software technology.


Revit Architecture comes with Revit Structure (for structural engineers) 
and Revit MEP (for Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing engineers) 
in one package called Revit 2018; the three represent the ultimate BIM 
solutions for all engineering disciplines.



Using this list, you can add or remove commands. Also, you can 
­Customize the Quick Access Toolbar.

6 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Ribbons


Ribbons consist of two parts:
••
Tabs
••
Panels
 


For instance, the Architecture tab consists of seven panels: Build, Cir-
culation, Model, Room & Area, Opening, Datum, and Work Plane.


Some panels will have a small triangle near the title to indicate additional 
buttons; if you click it you will get the following:


Some buttons may have a small triangle at the right part, meaning there 
are more options, such as in the following illustration:
 


If you stay for one second over any button, you will see a small help 
screen pops up, just like the following:


However, if you stay for three seconds, you will see an extended help 
screen. Check the following illustration:

Introduction to Revit 2018 • 7


Panels can be docked or floating. By default, all panels are docked. To 
make them floating, simply click the name of the panel, hold, and drag.


While the panel is floating, there is a small button at the right side; the 
following image shows its function:


Ribbons can be displayed differently on the screen by clicking the small 
arrow at the right repeatedly:
••
You can see the panels and their contents:
 
••
It displays a single button with the name of the panel. If you hover 
over it, it will show the contents of each panel alone:
••
It will show only the name of the panel. If you hover over it, it will 
show the contents of each panel alone:
••
The name of the tabs will be displayed; once you click it, Revit 
Architecture will show all the panels related to that tab:
••
If you click the arrow beside the small button, you will see:
••
In this list you can pick any status you wish right away, without cycling.

8 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Info Center


At the top right part of the screen, you will see the Info Center, like the 
following: 


Info Center is the place where you can type any keyword(s) and Revit 
Architecture will search all its resources (online and off-line) to find you 
all the help topics related to your keyword(s).


Other buttons are for signing into Autodesk 360 (Autodesk Cloud), the 
Subscription Center, the Communication Center, etc.
View Area


Revit is based on views.


When you start a new project based on one of the given templates (archi-
tectural as an example), you will find (at least) two floorplan views, two 
ceiling plans, and four elevations views.


You will always work on a view, which is your place to input Revit elements.


The first step to start creating your model is to ask yourself, “am I in the 
right view?” If yes, go ahead. If not, go to the Project Browser, double-
click the desired view, and then start working.


You can open as many views in your project file as you wish. This may 
slow down your computer; hence, you need to close views frequently. To 
close hidden views:


Go to the Quick Access Toolbar and click the Close Hidden Windows 
button:


Go to the View tab and select the Windows panel, then click the Tile 
button to tile all the opened views:

Introduction to Revit 2018 • 9


To browse between the opened views, you can use one of the following:
••
[Ctrl] + [Tab]
••
Go to the View tab, select the Windows panel, and click the Switch 
Windows button to see something like the following:
Properties


At the top left of the View Area, you will find the Properties palette (of 
course you can dock it anywhere else).


This palette will show the properties of the selected element (Wall, Door, 
Roof, etc.). If there is no element selected, it will show the properties of 
the current view.


Check the following two examples. The first one shows the properties of 
a wall, and the second one shows the properties of the current floor plan:
         
Project Browser


Everything related to your project will be found in the Project Browser.


You will find the following:
••
All views (floor plans, ceiling plans, sections, elevations, 3D, ­rendering, 
legends, etc.)
••
Schedules and Quantities
••
Sheets
••
Loaded families
••
Created groups


The name of the current view will be bold compared to the other views.
View Control Bar


This bar is located at the bottom of view area, above the status bar:

10 • Revit 2018 Architecture


In this bar, you can control the scale of the view:


Use the Detail Level button to control the view; you have three choices:
••
Coarse
••
Medium
••
Fine


Compare Coarse and Medium using the ­following figure (Wall):


The Visual Style button will show different styles for the 3D view (you 
can see the effect in 2D views as well but not as clear as the 3D):


Other buttons will be discussed later, each in its proper place.
Status Bar


The last bar at the bottom will show different things:
••
It will show you the next step after you start a command. For ­example, 
while you are in the Wall command, you will see at the left of the 
­status bar “Click to enter wall start point.”
••
The second part is the Workset part (advanced feature).
••
The third part is the Design Options part (advanced feature).
••
The rest are buttons for selecting elements and filters.

Introduction to Revit 2018 • 11
Options Bar


When you start a new command or select an element, you will see this 
bar filled with information to help you finish your task correctly.


For example, when you start the Wall command, the Options bar will 
look like the following:


These are all options related to creating a wall (which will be discussed 
later).
ZOOMING IN REVIT 2018


The Mouse is the primary input device:
••
The Left Button is always used to Select or Click.
••
The Right Button means lots of things depending on what you are 
doing.


The wheel in the mouse has zooming functions:
••
Zoom in by moving the wheel forward.
••
Zoom out by moving the wheel backward.
••
Pan by pressing the wheel and holding, then moving, the mouse.
••
Zoom to the extents of your model by double-clicking the wheel.


You can use the Zoom commands available in the toolbar at the right 
(though we think that using the mouse for zooming is much easier). 
Click the second button, and you will see the following menu:
Zoom All to Fit works if multiple views are opened and tiled. It will Zoom 
all elements in all views in one shot.
NOTE

12 • Revit 2018 Architecture
3D AND CAMERA IN REVIT 2018


When you create a new file using one of the premade templates, there 
will be no 3D views.


When you issue the 3D command for the first time, a new view called 
{3D} will be created.


To issue the 3D view command, go to the Quick Access Toolbar and click 
the arrow beside the Default 3D View to see the following list:


Click the Default 3D View button to see the 3D presentation of your 
model.


At the top right of your screen you will see the ViewCube:


The ViewCube will allow you to view the 3D model from six orthograph-
ical views and from the edges and corners of the cube.


To orbit the 3D model, hold [Shift], click and hold the mouse wheel, and 
move the mouse.


To create an additional interior or exterior 3D view, create a camera.


To create a camera go to the Quick Access Toolbar, click the arrow beside 
the Default 3D View, and select the Camera option:


Specify two points:
••
Camera point
••
Target point


Once done, Revit Architecture will create a new 3D view (with a tempo-
rary name) and will make it the current view.

Introduction to Revit 2018 • 13
STEERING WHEEL


The Steering wheel will allow you to navigate the model using different 
methods like zooming, orbiting, panning, walking, etc.


To issue the command, go to the toolbar at the right and click the 
­Steering Wheel button, like the following:


Choose the Full Navigation option, and you will see the following:


There are eight viewing commands, four located in the outer circle, and 
four located in the inner circle. The commands in the outer circle are:
••
Zoom command
••
Orbit command
••
Pan command
••
Rewind command


In the inner circle, you will find:
••
Center command
••
Look command
••
Up/Down command
••
Walk command
Zoom
This command will zoom in on the 3D (although using the mouse wheel will 
do almost the same job). Move your cursor to the desired location of your 
model, start the Zoom option, click and hold, move your mouse forward to 
zoom in, and move your mouse backward to zoom out.
Orbit
This command is similar to the Zoom command. Move your cursor to the 
desired location, select the Orbit option, click and hold and move the mouse 
right and left and up and down to orbit your model.

14 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Pan
This command will Pan in 3D. Move your cursor to the desired location, 
select the Pan option, and click and hold and move the mouse right and left 
and up and down to pan over your model.
Rewind
This command will record all your actions that took place using the other 
seven commands. Use it as if you are rewinding a movie. Start the Rewind 
command and you will see a series of screen shots; click and drag your mouse 
backward to view all your actions.
Center
This command will specify a new center point for the screen. (You should 
always hover over an object.) Select the Center option, click and hold, and 
then locate a new center point for the current view; when done, release the 
mouse, and the whole screen will move to capture the new center point.
Look
Assume you are in a place and you are not moving; your head is moving up 
and down, left and right. Move the cursor to the desired location, select the 
Look option, click and hold, and then move the mouse right and left and up 
and down.
Up/Down
This command will go up above the model or down below the model. Move 
your cursor to the desired location and select the Up/Down option, and you 
will see a vertical scale; click and hold and move the mouse up and down.
Walk
For this command to be active, you need to create a camera first, and then 
work at the camera view. It will simulate walking around a place; you will 
have eight directions to walk through. If you combine this command with 
the Up/Down command, you will get best results. Move your cursor to the 
desired location, select the Walk option, and click and hold and move the 
mouse in one of the eight directions.


The other versions of the Steering Wheel are mini copies of the Full 
Navigation:
••
The Mini Full Navigation Wheel shows a small circle that contains all 
eight commands.

Introduction to Revit 2018 • 15
••
The Mini View Object Wheel shows a small circle that contains the 
four commands of the outer circle in the full wheel.
••
The Mini Tour Building Wheel shows a circle that contains the four 
commands of the inner circle in the full wheel.
••
Basic View Object Wheel 
••
Basic Tour Building Wheel

••
From the Application menu, click New, then Project.


Using any of the above ways, you will see the following dialog box:


To make sure that you are using the right template, click the Browse 
button and you will see the following dialog box (there is another set of 
templates for imperial units):


Depending on the options you selected when you installed Revit, you will 
see either U.S. Metric or U.S. Imperial (which are the default ­contents) 
or you will see other choices of templates.

16 • Revit 2018 Architecture

INTRODUCTION


We will be using plenty of drawing and modifying commands throughout 
the coming chapters.


These commands share almost the same techniques, so we will dedicate 
this chapter to discussing these techniques only.
DRAWING IN REVIT 2018


While you are drawing walls (for example) in Revit 2018, there will be 
four things that will help you do your job precisely:
••
Temporary dimensions
••
Alignment lines
••
Snaps
••
Draw context panel
This Chapter Contains:
●
●Drawing commands and drawing techniques
●
●Selecting in Revit
●
●Some modifying commands
HOW TO DRAW AND  
MODIFY IN REVIT

22 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Temporary Dimensions


Temporary dimensions appear in two different situations:
••
When you are drawing walls in floor plans, you will see the length of 
the wall and its angle measured from the east (180° counterclockwise, 
and 180° clockwise), just like the following example:
••
In this mode you are allowed to input the value of the length by typing.
••
You will see the second type of temporary dimension after you finish 
drawing the wall. If you click the wall, you will be allowed to change 
the temporary dimension, as in the following:
••
Click the small blue circle to change the position of the dimension 
from the outer edge, inner edge, or center of the wall.
••
The small shape beside the dimension is used to convert the tempo-
rary dimension to a permanent dimension:
Alignment Lines


When you draw several walls, Revit will help you align the new wall to 
any existing wall, as in the following example:

How to Draw and Modify in Revit • 23
Snaps


Revit allows you to snap to any element, as in snapping to endpoints, the 
midpoint of a wall, or the intersection of two elements.


By default all snaps are on.


To control Snaps go to the Manage tab, locate the Settings panel, and 
click the Snaps button:


You will see the following dialog box:


In this dialog box you can do all/any of the following:
••
Turn on/off any desired snap.
••
Change the length dimension snap increment. The different values 
will work according to the zoom level. When you are closer you will 
use the lesser value.
••
Change the angular dimension snap. The level of zoom applies here 
as well.
••
Use the Temporary override by using the keyboard shortcuts; for 
instance, SC is used to snap to the center of an arc or circle element.

24 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Draw Context Panel


When you start any command in Revit that includes drawing, you will 
see something like the following (depending on the command, you may 
see less or more tools):


The panel includes tools to help draw shapes such as:
••
Line tool, to draw straight shapes. If you want to draw continuous 
lines, make sure that the Chain option (which appears in the Options 
bar) is turned on.
••
Rectangle tool, to draw a rectangle shape using two opposite corners.
••
Two types of polygons (Inscribed and Circumscribed)
••
Circular shape
••
Three types of circular arcs
••
Fillet arc (to add an arc to two lines)
••
Select existing lines
••
Pick Faces


More of these tools will be discussed when we tackle other commands.
SELECTING IN REVIT


There are three ways to select elements in Revit Architecture:
••
Click on the desired element.
••
Click on an empty space, hold the mouse, and go to the right to form a 
Window. Elements contained fully inside the Window will be selected.
••
Click on an empty space, hold the mouse, and go to the left to form a 
Crossing. Elements crossed by or contained fully inside the Crossing 
will be selected.


The following is an example using the Window technique:

The following is an example using the Crossing technique:


You can add and remove from the selection set as follows:
••
Hold the [Ctrl] key to add more elements to the selection set. You will 
see the cursor with the add sign.
••
Hold the [Shift] key to remove elements from the selection set. You 
will see the cursor with the subtract sign.


Depending on what method you use, a green context tab will appear, 
which looks like the following:


Under the panel called Modify, you will see all modifying commands, 
like Move, Copy, Rotate, and so on. This method of selecting elements 
before issuing the modifying command is favorable when using Revit.


At the right under the Selection panel you can see the Filter button. 
This button is very important when you select multiple elements; it will 
help you segregate the contents as you wish. Click Filter and you will 
see the following dialog box:


In the above example, your selection contains five walls, two doors, and 
two windows. You can use the two buttons at the right to check them all 
or uncheck them all, or you can use the checkbox at the left to make your 
own decisions.

SOME MODIFYING COMMANDS


As we said previously, when you select element(s), the context Modify 
panel will appear, along with some element-specific functions.


This method is the recommended method to modify elements in Revit. 


The context panel looks like the following:


We will discuss the following commands:
••
Move
••
Copy
••
Rotate
••
Mirror (two types)
••
Array (two types)
Move Command


The Move command is always available when you select an element. For 
example, select a wall, then hover over it, and you will see something like 
the following:


Once you see this symbol, simply drag the element, and the temporary 
dimension will help you specify the exact distance.


Another way is to select the desired element(s), then click the Move 
­button from the Modify context panel:

How to Draw and Modify in Revit • 29


The selected element will appear like the following:


The option bar will show the following:


The two options are:
••
Constraint. To restrict the movement of the selected element to be 
either horizontal or vertical (this option is off by default).
••
Disjoin. To understand this option, note that the movement of walls is 
always stretching, which means the connected walls will always react 
by increasing the length or decreasing it. With Disjoin on, only the 
selected wall will move (this option is off by default).


Specify the options, specify the start point, and then specify the endpoint.
Copy Command


The Copy command will copy the selected element(s).


All things that apply to the Move command apply to the Copy com-
mand, except for one thing; in the Options bar, there is an option called 
Multiple that allows multiple copies in the same command.


Select the desired element(s), and then click the Copy button from the 
Modify context panel:
Rotate Command


Use the Rotate command to rotate element(s) around a specified point 
called the Center of rotation. Select the desired element(s), and then 
click the Rotate button from the Modify context panel:

30 • Revit 2018 Architecture


At the Options bar, you will see the following:


The Center of rotation is always the center of the selected element(s); to 
change it, click the Place button and specify a new point:


Select Disjoin if you want the selected element(s) to disjoin from the 
attached elements.


Select Copy if you want to keep the original and rotate a copy of it.


You can specify an angle by typing, bearing in mind that positive values 
will rotate the elements counterclockwise.


Another way to rotate is using the mouse; specify two angles (from the 
center of rotation) and Revit will calculate the net angle.
Mirror Command


The Mirror command will mirror the selected element(s) around the 
mirror line. There are two types of Mirror command:
••
Mirror Pick Axis, which uses an existing axis. Click the Mirror-Pick 
Axis button from the Modify context panel:
••
Mirror Draw Axis, which asks the user to specify two points as the 
mirror axis. Click the Mirror-Draw Axis button from the Modify 
context panel:


The Option bar will look like the following:

How to Draw and Modify in Revit • 31


By default, Revit will mirror and delete the original element. If the Copy 
option is turned on, both (original and mirrored image) will stay.
Array Command


There are two types of Array in Revit 2018:
••
Linear Array
••
Radial Array


Select the desired element(s), then click the Array button from the 
Modify context panel:


In the Options bar you will see the following:
Linear Array


Linear Array is the default array type.


It will repeat the selected items in linear fashion in any angle and dis-
tance desired by the user.


Change one or all of the available options:
••
Group and Associate means all elements resulted from the array 
will be united in a single object. This means editing the whole array 
in the future is available.
••
Number means to specify the total number in the array including the 
original element.
••
Move to 2nd or Last, means the distance you will specify graphi-
cally will be from the original element to the 2nd, or to the last ele-
ment of the array.


After you specify the number of items and whether the distance will be 
measured to the 2nd or to the last element of the array, specify the dis-
tance and angle of the array.

32 • Revit 2018 Architecture


For example, check the following illustration:


In this example, the number is 4, the distance between the first and sec-
ond is 1700, and with an angle of 45, the result will be like the following:


You have the option to change the total number of items in the array. 
Input the new number and press [Enter].


Even after the array command is finished, you can select any element of 
the array and you will see something like the following:


While in this mode, you can change the total number of the array again, 
but you can also ungroup these elements; you will see a context tab 
named Modify | Model Groups, with one panel named Group con-
taining two buttons like the following:

How to Draw and Modify in Revit • 33


Click the Ungroup button to ungroup elements from the group—the 
user should note that this would remove the array effect from the ele-
ments.
Radial Array


Radial array will repeat the selected element(s) in circular or semicircu-
lar fashion. After selecting the Radial button, you will see the following 
option bar:


By default a Radial array needs a Center of rotation point (just like 
the Rotate command); use the Place button to specify a new Center 
of rotation.


Specify whether to Group and Associate the total number of elements 
and whether the angle given (graphically) will be between the first and 
2nd or last element.


The user can type the angle (if you type the angle, the positive is coun-
terclockwise) or specify it graphically.
EXERCISE 2-2  SOME MODIFYING COMMANDS
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 2-2.rvt.
3. Zoom to the room at the lower left corner.
4. Select the right wall and the door, and move them to the right by 500  
(0'-11").
5. Select the two inside walls, the door, and the south window only. Start the 
Copy command, make sure that Multiple is on, specify the inside lower 
left corner as the first point, and then copy the room twice.
6. You should have something like the following:

34 • Revit 2018 Architecture
7. Using the Mirror – Draw Axis command, mirror the three rooms (with 
their doors and windows) to the right side of the building.
8. For the middle room, delete one of the middle walls and correct the 
length of the horizontal wall to attach to the vertical wall.
9. Zoom to the middle of the building where the table and chairs are.
10. Rotate the left chair so it will be like the chair on the other side.
11. Array the top chair to be three chairs with the distance between chairs

PROJECT INFORMATION AND PROJECT UNITS


After you create a new file using the desired template, you may need to 
visit these two areas: Project Information and Project Units.


Some companies may opt to include these two items in their template 
files.
This Chapter Contains:
●
●Project Information and Project Units
●
●Creating levels
●
●Importing a CAD file
●
●Creating gridlines
●
●Creating columns
PROJECT PREPARATION

38 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Project Information


In the Project Information dialog box, input general information about 
your project.


This information will be used later in the final printed sheets.


To issue this command, go to the Manage tab, locate the Settings panel, 
and then click the Project Information button:


The following dialog box will appear:


The user should enter all or any of the following information:
••

Author (the creator of the project)
••
Energy Settings (to be filled if the project will be taken to Revit MEP)
••
Project Issue Date
••
Project Status
••
Client Name
••
Project Address, Name, and Number
Project Units


When you start a new project using a template file, this will dictate units 
to be used in the project. Most likely the default settings will be ­adequate.

Project Preparation • 39


In this part we will learn how to change the project units.


To issue this command, go to the Manage tab, locate the Settings panel, 
and then click the Project Units button:


You will see the following dialog box (the left for metric, and the right 
for imperial):
 


You can change any of these settings by clicking the Length button, 
which will bring up the following dialog box:


In the above dialog box, you can change all or any of the following:
••
Units
••
Rounding
••
Unit symbol

40 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CREATING LEVELS


Creating levels is an important step to start a new project in Revit. 


All walls, columns, roofs, and ceilings will be constrained by levels.


If you start with the default template, two levels separated by 4000mm 
(10') are available.


Each level has three things:
••
Name
••
Height
••
View names associated with it


You should be in the elevation or section view to create/edit a level.


Change the name and height of any existing level.


You can add any number of new levels.


To create a new level, go the Architecture tab, locate the Datum panel, 
and click the Level button:


Two things will change:
••
You will see the following context tab, which includes two tools, draw-
ing lines and picking existing lines:
••
The Option bar will show the following:
••
Click on the Make Plan View checkbox to help you create a floor plan 
and ceiling plan for each newly added level.
••
The Offset field will allow the user to set up an offset value for the Pick 
lines tool in the Draw context panel.

Project Preparation • 41


Ultimately, you can draw using the line tool. However, with the existence 
of the Pick line tool with the Offset value, things will be much easier. 
Since we have two existing levels, all you have to do is to click the Pick 
line tool, type a value in the Offset value, and then move your mouse to 
the desired level. You will see a preview dashed line above or below your 
existing level; click wherever you want it to be:


To change the name of a level, click the name twice and type in the new 
name. When done press [Enter] and you will see the following dialog box:


Most likely your answer will be Yes, as the name of the views should be 
aligned with the name of the level.


A few remarks about levels:
••
Levels with corresponding views will appear blue, levels without views 
will appear black.
••
By default level bubbles will move together using the small circle that 
appears to the left (or right) of the level bubble as shown below:
••
You can add an elbow to the level bubble using the Add elbow tool as 
shown below:

42 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
After adding an elbow, adjust all the parts by moving the small blue 
circles.
••
Show the bubble in both sides or in one side, using the checkbox at the 
left or right, just like the following:


In addition, you can adjust the level family to show bubbles on both 
sides. Do the following:
••
Start the Level command.
••
Using the Properties palette, click the Edit Type button.
••
You will see the following dialog box:
••
Make sure that both Symbol at End 1 Default and Symbol at End 2 
Default are checked.
When you create a new level, click the Plan View Types button on the 
Options bar, as shown below:
You will see the following dialog box; deselect the Structural Plan option so 
only Floor Plans and Ceiling Plans will be created:
NOTE

a. Change the name of Level 1 to 00 Ground.
b. Change the name of Level 2 to 01 First.
c. Change the height of 01 First to 5500 (18').
d. (Make sure you are not creating structural plans). Add new levels 
3600 (12') apart with the names: 02 Second, 03 Third, 04 Fourth, 
05 Fifth, and 06 Roof.
e. Add a new level over 06 Roof with 1000 (3'-6") in height and call it 
07 Parapet without creating a plan view for it.
f. Add a new level over 06 Roof with 3600 (12') in height and call it 
08 Staircase and Elevator without creating a plan view for it.

44 • Revit 2018 Architecture
g. Using the Add elbow tool to make the following:
8. Select one of the levels you just created. Click the Edit Type button and 
turn on both the Symbol at End 1 and 2 Defaults.
9. Save and close the file.
IMPORTING A CAD FILE


This is an optional step, yet if you want to use it, it will be very useful in 
speeding up your creation process.


This option will help you setup the grids, columns, and walls quickly 
using a CAD file.


The advantage of this step is utilizing the huge experience of CAD (in 
general and AutoCAD in particular) software in the design offices.


To import a CAD (or AutoCAD) file do the following:
••
Go to the desired floor plan.
••
Go to Insert tab, locate Import panel, and click the Import CAD 
button:
••
The following dialog box will appear; go to the desired folder contain-
ing your file and select it (without pressing [Enter]):

Project Preparation • 45
••
Select whether the CAD file will be used in the Current view only.
••
Select the Colors of the file: Preserve, Black and White, or Invert.
••
Select to import which Layers: All, Visible, or Specify.
••
Select Import Units (leave it on Auto-Detect, as Revit can bring in 
the right units of the CAD file with high accuracy).
••
Select Positioning: Automatic (Center-to-Center or Origin-to-Origin).
••
Click Open to finalize the process.


The import will be one object. When you hover your mouse over it, a dark 
blue frame will appear. You will see something similar to the ­following:


We will use this later as tracing paper for our Revit elements; hence, 
we may need to get a more transparent look for the import file. To do 
that, right-click the import file, select the Override Graphics in View 
option, then select By Element or By Category (if you select By Ele-
ment, only this instance will be affected; using By Category means all 
instances of this element in this view will be affected):


You will see the following dialog box; pick Halftone to make it less dark:

46 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CREATING GRIDLINES


Adding gridlines will help the user early on to set up the columns, which 
will be a guide for wall location as well.


You can add gridlines using one of two ways:
••
By drawing
••
By picking existing lines coming from a CAD import


To add a new gridline use the following method:
••
Go to the desired floor plan.
••
Go to the Architecture tab, locate the Datum panel, and then click 
the Grid button:
••
In the context tab, select one of the available drawing tools as shown 
below:
••
In the Options bar, you will see the following:
••
You can set the Offset value (both for drawing and picking lines), and 
you can choose to lock the gridline to the existing lines.
••
The first line drawn or picked will be numbered as 1, which you can 
change to any other value (a, or A, etc.); the next gridline will con-
tinue counting from that value.


A few remarks about gridlines:
••
By default gridline heads will move together using the small circle 
below the bubble.
••
You can add an elbow to the gridline bubble using the Add elbow tool.
••
After adding an elbow you can adjust it by moving the small blue 
circles.
••
You can show the bubble on both sides or on one side.

Project Preparation • 47
CREATING COLUMNS


There are two types of columns in Revit:
••
Structural Column
••
Architecture Column


The architecture column is used as decorative column, whereas the 
Structural column is a standard column and can be used later on by 
the structural engineer as a starting point for the structural system of the 
building.


To input a structural column, do the following:
••
Go to the Architecture tab, locate the Build panel, click the Column 
pop-up list, and then select the Structural Column button:
••
From the Properties select the desired family:
••
You will see the following context tab:
••
Under Placement, make sure you are using the Vertical Column button.
••
Under Multiple (and if you have already placed the gridlines), click the 
At Grids button.
••
If you want to add tags once you add columns, click the Tag on 
Placement button.
••
If you select At Grids, you will see the following context tab:
••
At Grids will ask you to select the desired gridlines. Once you are 
done selecting, click the Finish button to end the process of inputting 
columns.

48 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
At the Options bar you will see the following:
••
Select Height (to go up from the current level, choose Height, to go 
down from the current level, choose Depth).
••
Specify the level to which the column will extend.
EXERCISE 3-2  IMPORT CAD, GRIDLINES, AND COLUMNS
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 3-2.rvt.
3. Go to the 00 Ground view and import the AutoCAD file called Ground 
Floor.dwg, using the following information:
a. Colors = Black and White
b. Layers = All
c. Import Units = Auto-Detect
d. Positioning = Origin-to-Origin
e. In the current view only
4. Using the same settings, import in 01 First view the AutoCAD file called 
First Floor.dwg.
5. If needed move the four elevation symbols to the proper places.
6. Set the Graphics Override = Halftone for both CAD Imports.
7. Use the lines from the CAD import in the 00 Ground view to input 
­gridlines, setting the vertical gridlines to A, B, …, and the horizontal grid-
lines to 1, 2, … (make sure to show bubbles on both sides for all gridlines).
8. Create structural columns using all the gridlines starting from 00 Ground 
up to 06 Roof; the size to be used is M_Concrete-Square-Column 
300 × 300 (Concrete-Square-Column 12 × 12).
9. Delete the unnecessary columns: A1, A4, F1, and F4.
10. Go to the South elevation view and adjust the length of the levels to go 
beyond the columns at the right and at the left.
11. Save and close the file.

You can create TYPES of system families within your project.


System families are families that exist in a Revit project file as an essen-
tial part of your modeling process, such as walls, floors, ceilings, roofs, 
stairs, and railings.
Component Families


They are loadable in the current file.


There is an RFA for each family.


You can create new families using the Family Editor.


Examples of Component families are: Furniture, Lighting Fixtures, 
Doors, Windows, Planting, Plumbing Fixtures, and so on.


Wall families are System families and exist in all Revit project files by 
default.


There are three types of wall families:
••
Basic Wall
••
Curtain Wall
••
Stacked Wall


It is important to reiterate the concept that BIM elements are not like 
CAD objects. Walls in Revit are not only two parallel lines, but:
••
They have 2D presentation and 3D presentation.
••
They carry data (information) like width and height.
••
They consist of layers of materials (each layer has a width and 
function).
••
They can host other elements like Doors, Windows, and Light 
Fixtures.

All You Need to Know About Walls • 53
••
They understand the relationship between them and the roofs, floors, 
and ceiling attached to them.
••
You can generate a schedule from them.
To see the layers of the wall, change the Detail level to Medium or Fine.
INPUTTING WALLS


There are two ways to input walls in Revit, either by using the drawing 
tools, or—if you have a CAD Import—by picking existing lines from a 
CAD file.


To input walls, go to the Architecture tab, locate the Build panel, select 
the Wall button, and then select Wall: Architecture:


The properties will show the wall types so you can pick one of them:


You will see the following context tab:


The Options bar will show the following:
NOTE

54 • Revit 2018 Architecture


In the Options bar control whether this wall will go from the current 
level downward (choose Depth) or upward (choose Height).


You have two options to control the height of the wall starting from 
­current level:
••
Unconnected, which means the wall is not connected to a level. 
In this case input the height value.
••
Or to choose the level you want the wall to reach, check the following:


To continue discussing the height concept, you can set the Base 
­Constraint (the starting level) and Base Offset (which can be positive 
or negative), then the Top Constraint (the ending level) and Top Offset 
(which can be positive or negative):


To illustrate the concept of Base and Top Constraints along with positive 
and negative offsets, check out the following (numbers are in mm):

All You Need to Know About Walls • 55


In the previous illustration there are four cases:
••
Case (1) the base offset is a positive offset
••
Case (2) the base offset is a negative offset
••
Case (3) the top offset is a positive offset
••
Case (4) the top offset is a negative offset


Specify the Location Line:


To understand the above, in Revit there is a layer in the wall type defini-
tion called the “Core” layer. Each wall should have this layer, which can 
be at the center of the wall width or not. Check the following illustration:


Other Location Lines are:


If you want the drawing of the wall chained (the beginning of the new 
segment is the end of the last segment), then click on the Chain check-
box. If you click it off, you will specify two points for the first segment, 
two points for the second segment, and so on.


Set the Offset value if the wall will be created with an offset value from 
the points selected.


If the wall has an arc, click on the Radius checkbox and input the radius 
value.

56 • Revit 2018 Architecture


To control how two walls will join, select Join Status to be either Allow 
or Disallow:
WALL CONTROLS AND TEMPORARY DIMENSIONS


When you click a wall, you will see controls appear over the wall, like the 
following:


If you click one of the walls in a chain of walls, you will see something 
like the following:


The above example shows the measurement from inside to inside. If you 
click and hold the Witness Line, you can measure from center to center, 
or from outside edge to outside edge, or any combination of the above. 
Another way is to click the blue circle, which will move it from inside to 
the center to the outside of the wall.

To input a permanent method, go to the Manage tab, locate the 
Settings panel, select the Additional Settings button, and select the 
Temporary Dimensions button:


You will see the following dialog box:


Select to measure from the centerlines of the wall/core or the faces of 
the wall/core.
To select chained walls, do the following:
••
Move your mouse over one of the walls.
••
Press the [Tab] key, and all chained walls will be highlighted.

d.	Location Line = Finish Face: Exterior
e.	Chain = yes
f.	Detail Level = Medium
5. Using the Pick Lines tool, click the CAD file to import outside lines, mak-
ing sure that the dashed lines are on the inside, ignoring the door open-
ings, and not picking the curve.
6. Using the Drag Wall End tool, close the door openings ignored in the 
previous step along with the entrance at the east elevation.
7. Using Wall family: Exterior Glazing and the Pick Lines tool, create  
the outside curve to be a Curtain Wall extending to the Roof minus 1250 
(4'-2").
8. Go to the Roof view and close the gap between the curtain wall and the 
normal wall using CW 102-85-100p (Exterior – Brick on CMU – Special) 
if Revit gave you the following error: “The top of the wall is lower than the 
top of the wall – click Reset Constraints button.”
9. Look at the model in 3D view; if the Brick is not on the outside, then click 
the Change wall’s orientation control.

Click the existing wall, right-click, and then select the Create Similar 
option:


You can start inputting the wall right away, as it holds all the right information.


You can use this command with doors, windows, and so on.
Cut Profile


When you add the outer wall with an inside finish layer of drywall 
­(gypsum board), then you create an intersecting wall for an elevator or 
staircase, and you don’t want this specific layer to be continuous in these 
two parts of the building.


You need to stop the finishing layer in the staircase or elevator.

A closed area inside the profile will mean an opening.
HIDE AND UNHIDE ELEMENTS


Sometimes Revit displays lots of information in the Floor plan, Ceiling 
Plan, and Elevation Section views that may confuse you.


You have the ability to hide some of the elements at any time during 
project development, then unhide them later.


To hide any element, do the following:
••
Select one element of the desired element (say we need to hide the 
gridlines).
••
Right-click, and you will see the following menu:
••
Select Hide in View, and then select either Elements or Category. 
If you select Elements, only the selected elements will be hidden. If


In this chapter we will learn how to insert doors and windows in Revit.


Walls are the hosts for both doors and windows.


We will discuss different techniques to insert both doors and windows:
••
Use the pre-loaded families.
••
Load the RFA file from the hard disk.
••
Customize the door and window sizes.


We will discuss how to place doors and windows exactly using temporary 
dimension and Aligned dimension.

Finally, we will discuss the door and window tags.
This Chapter Contains:
●
●Inserting doors and windows using pre-loaded families
●
●Loading door and window families

INSERTING DOORS AND WINDOWS USING  
PRE-LOADED FAMILIES


To insert a door or window, do the following:
••
Go to the desired view. Though you can add doors and windows in 
many views, we prefer always to use Floor Plan views.
••
Go to the Architecture tab, locate the Build panel, and click Door 
or Window:
 
••
In both commands you will see the following context tab:
••
This context tab allows you to include a tag. Also, it will help you to 
load a non-pre-loaded family, and finally, it will allow you to create a 
new door/window using Model In-place.
••
In the Options bar you will see the following:
••
You can insert a tag in two orientations, either horizontal or vertical, 
with or without a leader (you have to specify the length of the leader). 
Look at the following illustration:
••
Use Properties to pick the desired family and the desired size:

Inserting Doors and Windows • 75
In Revit templates, the default tag for doors is instance parameter 
(i.e., ­sequential); the next door will take the next number. But for windows, 
the default tag is type parameter (i.e., non-sequential), which means the same 
window type will always take the same number. In the coming chapters, we will 
learn how to load other types of tags for both doors and windows.
LOADING DOOR AND WINDOW FAMILIES


Since door and window families are component families, you can load 
them to your current project.


Door and window families are RFA files. Revit comes with many ­families, 
which reside in the hard disk of your machine.


Another way is to look up door and window families online free of charge, 
download them, and then copy them to the desired folder.


Once you start the Door and Window command, using the context tab, 
click the Load Family button.


You will see the following dialog box:


Double-click the Doors folder or the Windows folder to see the ­following:


Select the desired folder, select the desired family file(s) (you can select 
several files), and then click Open to load them into your project.
NOTE

76 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CUSTOMIZING DOOR AND WINDOW SIZES


If you like the door family, but you need different size, you can create 
new sizes by creating duplicates of your type.


To do that follow these steps:
••
Start the Door or Window command, and select the desired family.
••
At Properties click the Edit Type button:
••
You will see the following dialog box:
••
Do not make the mistake of changing the values now; always create a 
duplicate and do your editing on it. Click the Duplicate button:
••
Type the new name of your type (normally, the name is the size of the 
door or the window).
••
Click OK to end the creation process.
••
Change the values you wish to edit.
••
To finish the whole customization process, click OK.

SPECIAL TECHNIQUES FOR DOORS AND WINDOWS


To position a door or window precisely, or after inserting, use the tempo-
rary dimensions. Check the following illustration:


Use the Aligned Dimension tool to position multiple doors or windows 
exactly. Check the following example:
••
Notice the windows are not equally distributed over the distance 
between the staircase and the inside wall:
••
Start the Aligned Dimension tool from the Quick Access Toolbar at 
the top left of the screen:
••
At the Option bar, change Wall centerline to Wall faces:
••
Input the dimensions starting from the edge of the stair at the top, to 
the center of each window, ending it at the edge of the wall:

78 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
There is a small icon of the letters EQ with a slash to indicate that the 
dimensions are currently unequal; click it once to make them equal:
••
To show the real distance, choose Properties and select the dimension 
(if not already selected); under Other, select Value for the Equality

INTRODUCTION


There are three types of curtain walls in Revit Architecture:
••
Curtain Wall
••
Exterior Glazing
••
Storefront


The Curtain Wall type is a single piece of glass and cannot be used in 
curved walls.


In Chapter 4 we used Exterior Glazing in our model, which consists of 
glass panels only stacked over and beside each other.
This Chapter Contains:
●
●All you need to know about curtain walls
●
●Controlling curtain grids
●
●Adding and manipulating mullions
●
●Adding storefronts
●
●Curtain panels
●
●Hiding and isolating elements
CREATING AND  
CONTROLLING CURTAIN 
WALLS

86 • Revit 2018 Architecture


The Storefront type is aluminum sections and glass panels. This type has 
the power of being embedded inside Basic walls.


In this chapter, we will discuss how to control the Exterior Glazing using 
Curtain Gridlines and Panels.


Also, we will discuss how to insert and control the Storefront type.
ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT CURTAIN WALLS


Any curtain wall is divided into:
••
Curtain Gridlines (which can be filled by a mullion, or simply nothing)
••
Panels


In order to select:
••
The whole wall, move your mouse to one of the outer edges as shown 
in the following (notice the tool tip), and then click to select:
••
To select a panel, go to one of its edges and press [Tab] until you 
get something like the following (note the tool tip), and then click to 
select:
••
To locate a curtain gridline, simply move your mouse pointer to the 
desired line; it should highlight right away, but if it didn’t, press [Tab] 
until you see something like the following:

Creating and Controlling Curtain Walls • 87


The keyword here is curtain gridline:
••
Curtain gridlines can be replaced by mullions, but note that when-
ever you move the curtain gridline, the mullion will move with it.
••
When you move a curtain gridline, one of the panels will be smaller 
and the other will be bigger; hence, you can control the size of the 
panel through the movement of the curtain gridlines.
••
As an alternative method, you can add new curtain gridlines to the 
existing curtain wall, and new panel sizes will result. You can delete 
whatever you added but not the original curtain gridlines. To do that 
you need to unpin them first.
••
By default, Panels are holding Glass material, but you can assign any 
material you desire.
CONTROLLING CURTAIN GRIDLINES


Go to an elevation view that can show the curtain gridlines clearly.


Hide anything may hinder your work.
Moving Existing Curtain Gridlines


To move a curtain gridline, you need to select it first.


If it was pinned, then unpin it (to unpin anything pinned, use the 
­Modify context tab, locate the Modify panel, and click the Unpin 
button):


There are several ways to move a curtain gridline:
••
Use the Move command.
••
Hover your mouse over the curtain gridline until the Move icon 
shows, then click and move it.
••
Use the temporary dimension.
••
Use the Align command.
Adding New Curtain Grid Lines


This command will add new curtain gridlines.

88 • Revit 2018 Architecture


To issue this command, go to the Architecture tab, locate the Build 
panel, and click the Curtain Grid button:


The following context tab will appear:


If you hover over a horizontal curtain gridline, Revit will understand that 
you will add a vertical one.


If you hover over a vertical curtain gridline, Revit will understand that 
you will add a horizontal one.


When you want to add a new curtain gridline, select from the following 
choices:
••
Whether the new curtain gridline should cut all segments
••
Whether the new curtain gridline should cut only the picked 
segment
••
Whether the new curtain gridline should cut all segments, then pick 
some undesired segments out
Deleting Curtain Grid Lines


To delete a curtain gridline:
••
Simply select it and press [Del] at the keyboard.
••
You can’t delete an original curtain gridline—only user-added ones.
Controlling Curtain Grid Lines Using Properties


When you select the whole curtain wall, two parts of the Properties 
will allow you to control vertical and horizontal grids as shown in the 
following:

Creating and Controlling Curtain Walls • 89


Control the Justification of the vertical and horizontal grid lines:
••
Beginning – means starts from the bottom (if it was horizontal), or left 
(if it was vertical)
••
End – means starts from the top (if it was horizontal), or right (if it 
was vertical)
••
Center – means starts from the center of the distance


You can select to change the Justification with or without an Offset value
Add/Remove Segments


This option will be available only when you select a curtain grid line. You 
will see the following context tab:


This command allows you to pick any segment of a selected curtain grid 
line and delete it if it exists, or add it if it is not there.
If you have a curved curtain wall, the best place to add/remove segments 
is in 3D view.


This could help you remove an original curtain grid line by removing all 
of its segments (but the curtain grid line will stay).
ADDING AND CONTROLLING MULLIONS


You can replace curtain grid lines with mullions.


By default mullions are:
••
Different shapes and sizes (Rectangular, Square, L-Shape, 
Trapezoidal, Circular, etc.)
••
Material used is always Aluminum (but you can change it)


To issue this command, go to the Architecture tab, locate the Build 
panel, and click the Mullion button:
NOTE

90 • Revit 2018 Architecture


You will see the following context tab:


You can select one of the three options:
••
Grid Line – you will add mullions covering the whole grid line
••
Grid Line Segment – you will add mullions for the selected 
segment
••
All Grid Lines – you will add mullions covering all grid lines in the 
curtain wall
Selecting a Group of Mullions


When you select a group of adjacent mullions, you will see the following 
context tab:
••
Make Continuous will make a group of selected mullions continu-
ous. Check the following illustration:
   
••
Break at Join will do the opposite.
ADDING STOREFRONTS


A storefront is special curtain wall which consists of mullions and glass 
panels.


This special curtain wall has the ability to penetrate basic walls and 
occupy their space.


This is a wall type, hence all things we know about walls apply here. You 
have to add in the middle of the other walls, as in the following:
   

Creating and Controlling Curtain Walls • 91


This how it looks in elevation view:
CURTAIN PANELS


By default all panels in any curtain wall are presented as glass panels.


You can do two things:
••
You can replace a panel with special doors or windows.
••
You can change the material of a panel.
Replacing Panels


To replace a panel with doors and windows, do the following:
••
Load the special door or window family, but don’t use it in the nor-
mal way of inserting doors or windows. End the door or window 
command.
••
In elevation view select the desired panel, then Unpin it.
••
Go to Properties and click the arrow beside the current type 
(System Panel Glazed). Check the category called Most Recently 
Used Types, find the loaded door or window among them, and 
select it:

92 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Panel Material


To change panel material, do the following:
••
In elevation view select the desired panel, then Unpin it.
••
Go to Properties and click the Edit Type button. Click the Duplicate 
button and give a name for the new System Panel.
••
Locate the Material field:
••
When you click the Glass field, at the far right click the small button 
with three dots to show the Material Browser dialog box:
••
Browse for your new material, or use the top edit box to type the 
name of the new material to search for it in the library. Either way, 
select it and click OK, then click OK to end the creation of the new 
System Panel.
HIDING AND ISOLATING ELEMENTS


This is another method to hide elements or categories of elements, along 
with the function of isolating elements or categories of elements (isolat-
ing means the selected elements will be shown, others will be hidden).


Select the desired element.

Creating and Controlling Curtain Walls • 93


At the View Control Bar select the Temporary Hide/Isolate button:


You will see the following menu:


Pick between Hiding or isolating elements or categories.


You will see a cyan frame around your screen with title Temporary Hide/
Isolate to remind you of what you did.


In this chapter we will learn how to create floors.


Floors will be the tool to define balconies and decks.


Create floors by selecting the bounding walls, or by sketching using 
­drawing tools. Later on you can edit the profile just like we did with 
walls.


We can create shafts to create an opening in a floor (or floors) depending 
on the height of the shaft.


We will learn some extra functions related to walls.
This Chapter Contains:
●
●Creating floors using two methods
●
●Joining elements
●
●Creating a shaft opening
●
●Creating a floor with slope
CREATING FLOORS

100 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CREATING FLOORS BY SELECTING WALLS OR SKETCHING


This command will add a floor using the bounding walls or by sketching 
using drawing tools.


To start the Floor command, go to the Architecture tab, Locate the 
Build panel, and click the arrow beside the Floor button to select 
Floor: Architecture:


In the Properties palette, select the desired floor family. Floor families 
are like wall families; they are system families:


The following context tab will appear:
••
The default option is to specify the Boundary Line.
••
In the Profile Sketching mode, you either select the bounding walls 
(the default option), or start sketching using the drawing tools.
••
Use the Slope Arrow button to specify the slope of the whole floor.
••
Use the Span Direction button to specify the direction of the floor 
span. By default Revit will specify the direction of the floor span as 
the first picked line of the profile.

Creating Floors • 101


The Options bar will show:


Specify whether the floor should be extended into the wall (to core), or 
not. You can also specify an offset value inside or outside.


The profile should be closed with no overlaps.


When done, click (✓) to end the command, and you may see the ­following 
message:


Revit asks if you want to attach the lower walls to the upper walls or not.


If you created part of the floor outside the walls (e.g., a balcony), Revit 
will show you the following message:


The above message means Revit is asking to join the floor and the 
bounded walls and remove the overlapping volume from the walls.
Just like the Wall command, to create an opening in the floor, simply draw 
a closed shape inside the boundary lines.


Floors are normally created at the level you are in. If you go to an eleva-
tion view, you will see something like the following. So the thickness of 
the floor will go below the level (this is of course by default):
NOTE

102 • Revit 2018 Architecture
JOINING GEOMETRY


For typical floors, when you create a floor with balconies, the floor 
­normally joins the wall, making an opening in the wall.


But when you copy this floor for the other levels, the copied floors 
will not join the wall, so you should join them manually with the Join 
Geometry command.


To join two elements together (here we are talking about floors and 
walls) do the following:
••
Go to the Modify tab, locate the Geometry panel, click the arrow 
beside the Join button, and then select the Join Geometry button:
••
At the Options bar, click Multiple Join if you want to join multiple 
elements and not only two:
••
Select the first element and then the second element.
HOW TO CREATE A SHAFT OPENING IN FLOORS


As we said earlier you can create openings while sketching the floor 
­profile.


Also, after creating a floor you can create a shaft opening, specifying a 
Base Constraint and Top Constraint.


The user should be in the floor plan to create a shaft.


To do that, go to the Architecture tab, locate the Opening panel, and 
select the Shaft button:

Creating Floors • 103


You will be inside a sketch mode to draw the plan of the shaft. 
The ­following context tab will appear:


In the Options bar, you will see the following:


Keep the Chain checkbox on so you can draw multiple lines. Specify an 
offset if the shaft has an offset to existing walls or elements. If the shape 
contains arcs, specify the radius of the arcs.


Use Symbolic Line to draw lines to indicate a void in the plan and all 
the plans the shaft reaches.


Here is a shaft Opening with Symbolic Lines:


Control the height of the shaft using Properties:


In the above example, the shaft extends from the Ground floor (-150mm) 
to the Roof level, penetrating all floors in between these two levels.

104 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CREATING A FLOOR WITH SLOPES


You can create two types of slopes in floors:
••
Create a one-direction slope
••
Create a slope for drainage
One-Direction Slope


You can specify a slope in one direction for a floor (or roof).


To do that, follow these steps:
••
Select the desired floor.
••
At the context tab, click the Edit Boundary button.
••
At the context tab, click the Slope Arrow button:
••
Draw the slope arrow (the length and direction are very important), 
and you will get something like the following:
••
The first point will be the tail, and the last point will be the head.
••
When done, select the arrow and look at the Properties:
••
Under Constraints, click Specify, and you will have two choices, either 
Height at Tail or Slope.
••
If Height at Tail is selected, specify the level of the head and tail (the 
current is default, which means the current level). Also, specify the 
Height Offset at tail and head.

Creating Floors • 105
Slope for Drainage


You can specify the slope for drainage in the toilets and kitchens using 
this feature.


You will first need to add Split Lines, which will split the area of the toilet 
from the other parts of the floor.


Then add a point with a lower elevation to create the slope.


Depending on the floor family used, Revit will slope the entire floor or 
only the top layer.


To create a drainage slope, do the following:
••
Select the desired floor.
••
You will see the following context tab:


Start with the Add Split Line button to separate the area in which you 
want to create the drainage slope from the rest of the floor slab.


Select the Add Point button, then at the Options bar, specify the desired 
value (it should be negative—assuming the other points to be at zero 
slope).


You will get something like the following:


To edit the point height, hover over it, press [Tab] until the point is high-
lighted, and then click. A number will appear beside it; click it to edit the 
value. Also, this will allow the user to move the point to another location.


If things didn’t work out and you want to start over, do the following:
••
Select the desired floor.

106 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
At the context tab click the Reset Shape button, and everything will 
go back to the point before you specified any drainage slopes:
UNDERLAY AND LINEWORK


In Chapter 4 we discussed the Underlay feature, which will allow you to 
see the floor below you as an underlay.


Linework will allow you to draw lines over the edges of other elements 
to highlight them.


To start the command, go to the Modify tab, locate the View panel, and 
click the Linework command:


A context tab will appear; select the desired Line Style:
EXERCISE 7-1  CREATING FLOORS

Creating Floors • 107
5. Start the Floor command and select family Insitu Concrete 200mm 
(Insitu Concrete 8").
6. Make sure that the Extend into wall (to core) checkbox is turned off, and 
offset=0.
7. Pick the outside edge of all the outside walls one by one.
8. Press [Esc] twice to get out of the selecting mode.
9. Zoom to the right entrance.
10. If you didn’t pick the three walls, pick them right now, and fix the bound-
ary to be continuous with no overlaps. When done click (✓) to end the 
command.
11. Go to the South elevation view to make sure that the floor is covering the 
whole ground floor up to the outside edges of the walls.
12. Go to the 01 First floor plan. Using the CAD import you will notice there 
are some extra lines to specify outside edges and inside edges for the floor 
slab.
13. Using the same floor family, do the boundary of the first floor making sure 
the Extend into wall (to core) checkbox is turned on. (Hint: do the walls 
first, then do the other lines, and make them connected and closed.)
14. If the following message comes out: “Would you like walls going up to this 
floor’s level to attach to its bottom?” answer No.
15. If the following message comes out: “The floor/roof overlaps the 
­highlighted wall(s). Would like to join geometry and cut the overlapping 
volume out of the wall(s)?” then answer Yes.
16. The new floor is already selected; copy it to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th 
levels.
17. Go to the 3D view, and make Visual Style = Hidden.
18. Notice that first floor slab penetrates the wall and you can see the edge 
lines. But from 2nd to 5th, the wall edges are not there! We need to join 
the two walls with the floor slabs. (Hint: make sure it is set to Multiple 
Join before you start.)
19. Make a shaft opening for the elevator extending from the Ground Floor 
minus 500mm (-10") to the Roof and draw symbolic lines. Visit the 3D 
view to make sure it penetrates both sides.

INTRODUCTION


Roofs are very similar to Floors. Roofs will cover the last level in a 
­building and cover any entrance.


The Roof families are system families like floor and wall families.


There are two types of Roofs:
••
With Roof by Footprint, you can create a flat roof or slope (Shed, 
Gable, and Hip) roof.
••
With Roof by Extrusion, you can create irregular shapes and extrude 
them to form a roof.


Meanwhile we will discuss the Reference Plane tool, which will help us 
place the roof by extrusion in the right elevation.
This Chapter Contains:



Components are still BIM elements that hold information, and you can 
create schedules out of them, so they are not dummy blocks.


Component files are RFA files like doors and windows, except they will 
be loaded from a different command.


There are three ways to place them into your project:
••
Components are pre-loaded into your current project
••
Components can be loaded using RFA files that reside in your 
­computer (off-line)
••
Components can be loaded online 


Some components don’t need a host, like furniture and trees.


Other components, like lighting fixtures, need a ceiling or a wall as a 
host.


For each family, you will see different options.


To start the Component command, go to Architecture tab, locate Build 
panel, click the arrow beside the button Component; to show a list, 
click the Place a Component button:


Using Properties, you will see something like the following:

CREATING A CEILING – INTRODUCTION


For the first time, we will work on the Ceiling Plans view.


There are two methods to create a ceiling:
••
Automatic Ceiling, where you will move your mouse pointer to a 
closed area bounded by walls
••
Sketch Ceiling, where you will sketch the shape of the ceiling using 
drawing tools


We will introduce Ceiling Soffit and some components that are usually 
used with ceilings.
CREATING A CEILING – AUTOMATIC


As the first step, go to the desired ceiling plan view (lots of people forget 
to do this important step).


Go to Architecture tab, locate Build panel, and click Ceiling button:

134 • Revit 2018 Architecture


The Context tab will appear with the Automatic Ceiling mode enabled:


At the Properties palette, you will see the following:


Select the desired ceiling family.


Move your mouse pointer to an area in the building with bounding walls, 
and you will see a thick red line surrounding the area:


If you are sure of this area, click once inside it, and you will see some-
thing like the following:


To select the Ceiling Compound Grid, simply select one of the lines.

Components & Ceiling • 135


You can rotate and move the whole grid. If you select the grid, the 
­following context tab will appear:


Clicking this button means you will start the boundary editing process 
that was discussed in Walls, Floors, and Roofs.


Using this option will allow you to set the slope for the ceiling.
CREATING A CEILING – SKETCH


If you don’t have bounding walls or you want to draw an inventive ­ceiling, 
you need to sketch it.


You will use the normal drawing tools to draw the desired shape.


Start the Ceiling command, click the Sketch Ceiling button, and you 
will see the following context tab:


You can draw any shape you want or select Pick Line or Pick Wall.


Also, you can create a Reference Plane just like we did with Roofs.


The boundary line should have the same characteristics of boundaries 
discussed previously.


Once you are done click (✓).
To create an opening in the ceiling for both types:
••
Use Shaft or Vertical just like we did in Floors
••
Draw a shape inside the boundary lines; this will be considered as an 
opening


For both types you can add special components in the ceiling, like lights 
and mechanical equipment (return register, supply diffuser).
NOTE

136 • Revit 2018 Architecture


For both types: using Properties, set the height of the ceiling:
CREATING A CEILING – CEILING SOFFIT


A ceiling soffit is the underside of the ceiling, which will connect two 
ceilings with different heights.


A soffit is a wall type specially used for this purpose.


You should control the heights of the soffit carefully to connect the two 
ceilings correctly.


Sketch the ceiling first, and then add to its edges the needed soffit.
EXERCISE 9-2  CREATING CEILING
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 9-2.rvt.
3. Go to the 00 Ground ceiling plan.
4. Hide all gridlines.
5. Start the Ceiling command and make sure Automatic Ceiling is selected.
6. Change the family to Compound Ceiling 600 × 600mm Grid (Compound 
Ceiling 2' × 2' ACT System), and set height to 2700mm (9'-0").
7. Click inside the right office at the north side of the building, then press 
[Esc] twice to get out of the command. Start the command again; when 
you click inside the left office, you will notice that Revit took the Cafeteria 
as well. Accept the selection, and press [Esc] twice to end the command. 
Select one of ceiling lines from the context tab, select Edit Boundary, and 
change the boundary to include only the office.
8. Zoom to the right office and select one of the ceiling lines. Using the 
Rotate command, rotate the ceiling grid by 45°. Do the same thing for 
the left office.

9. Notice the two reference planes from the middle of the left vertical wall 
and the middle of the upper horizontal wall. Use them to sketch the 
­following shape, bearing in the mind the following:
a. The Polygon Circumscribed number of sides = 8, and the radius = 
3500mm (12'-0")
b. Circle radius = 2500mm (8'-0")
c. Ceiling Type = Compound Ceiling Plain (Basic Ceiling – Generic)
d. Height offset from level = 2700mm (9'-0")
10. Draw a soffit wall to cover the circle with height = 300mm (1'-0").
11. Create a circular ceiling to cover the shape from the top with height = 
3000mm (10'-0").


In this chapter we will discuss how to create and modify Stairs and 
Ramps, and of course we have to tackle railings because they work with 
both of them. So, let’s start.
CREATING STAIRS – FIRST LOOK


As discussed before, Revit elements are all intelligent elements, and 
stairs and ramps are no exception.


You can deal with stairs using one of the following methods:
••
Standard stairs: where you will specify the start and end of stair flights, 
and Revit will take care of the rest, using stair families
This Chapter Contains:
●
●Creating and editing stairs
●
●Creating ramps
●
●Creating railings
CREATING STAIRS, RAMPS, 
AND RAILINGS

140 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
Editing standard stairs: where you will change the shape(s) of the 
flights and the landing of an existing standard stair
••
Sketching stairs: where you can sketch your stairs in any shape
CREATING STAIRS – STANDARD STAIRS


Stair families are system families.


In the standard stairs method, you will specify the start and end of stair 
flights using a stair family.


You will use reference planes as a helping tool.


The final result will depend heavily on the stair family used, so you 
should select the desired family as your first step.


To start the Stair command, go to Architecture tab, locate Circulation 
panel, and then select Stair button:


The first step is to look at the Properties palette to select the desired 
stair family; you will see something like the following:


Why do we do this step first? Because family settings will influence other 
settings, so selecting the wrong family first, and then changing the family 
later, may lead to wrong results.


The context tab will look like the following:

Creating Stairs, Ramps, and Railings • 141


Make sure the Run button is on. Select one of five possible shapes:
••
Straight (default option)
••
Full – Step Spiral
••
Center – Ends Spiral
••
L-Shape Winder
••
U-Shape Winder


The sixth is not a shape, but it is a mode. The sixth button is Create 
Sketch.


If you select it, the context tab will change to:


At the right of context tab is the Railing button (we will discuss it shortly).


You can create reference planes within the command, or you can create 
them beforehand (we prefer to create the reference planes within the 
command, because you will not see them in other floors).


The Properties palette will look like the following (it may change a little 
bit depends on the family selected):


Before we discuss the contents of this palette, let us lay down a simple 
fact. Revit will create a stair from the current level to the level above. 
Knowing this, let’s discuss the previous image:
••
Specify the Base level, and the top level with offsets or without.
••
The Desired Stair Height (read only) is the height between the base 
level and top level.
••
Specify the desired number of risers (actual number of risers and 
actual riser height are read-only fields). Most likely this value is 

142 • Revit 2018 Architecture
calculated based on two factors: your selected stair family and the 
height between the two levels.
••
Specify actual tread depth.
••
Specify tread / riser start number.


The Option bar will show the following:
••
Specify the stair Location Line. This will decide how you will spec-
ify the start and end points of flights and landings; you have several 
choices to pick from as listed above, with or without offset.
••
Specify the Actual Run width.
••
Specify whether you want to add an automatic landing between 
flights, or not.


After you control all of these things, specify the points. Do the following:
••
Start the first point (the first point will be the first riser of the stairs).
••
You will see one flight, representing the whole height of the stairs. At 
the bottom you will see how many risers were created, and how many 
are left.
••
In the above example, seven risers were created and fifteen remain.
••
Whenever you want to stop the flight, click a single click to end it.
••
Move up, right, left, and click to start the second flight; the distance 
between the two clicks will be considered as a landing.
••
When you are done, you will see something like the following:

Creating Stairs, Ramps, and Railings • 143
••
Notice the numbers at start and end of each flight; they are the num-
ber associated with each riser (this stair was drawn from left to right).
••
Click the Railing button at the right, and you will see the following 
dialog box:
••
Select the desired railing family, and then specify the position of the 
railing, whether on Treads or Stringers.
••
Once you are done, click (✓) to end the creation of the standard stair. 
This is the final shape:
••
You will be able to edit each flight and each landing separately
CREATING STAIRS – SKETCHING STAIRS


Start Stair command, from context tabs, select Create Sketch button:


You will see the following context tab:


The Boundary and Riser buttons will allow you to sketch any shape you 
want. Boundary is green, and Riser is black

144 • Revit 2018 Architecture


Check the following example, where we sketch two inclined boundaries, 
with multiple arcs representing the risers:


Once you are done, click (✓) to end the creation of the staircase. Revit 
will take you back to the previous mode of staircase command
CREATING STAIRS – CONNECT LEVELS


If you have typical floors and you want the stiar run to repeat it self 
­multiple times to higher levels or lower levels, then you should use 
­Connect Levels


When you start Stair command, you will see the following context tab:


Create a stair from Level 1 to Level 2 (for example)


Go to one of the four Elevation views


Under Multistory Stairs context panel, click Connect Levels button


Select the desired levels (hold [Ctrl] to select multiple levels


Click (✓) to end the command


You will see the stair extended to the levels you selected
EDITING STAIRS


If you have a stair already in place, simply click it (avoid clicking the 
­railing, or clicking one flight, make sure to select all the stair flights—Use 

Creating Stairs, Ramps, and Railings • 145
[Tab] key to select it), and at the context tab, you will see the ­following 
button:
Select Levels button will appear turned off, if you already selected levels 
for multistory stairs


Click the Edit Stairs button. The context tab will change to the ­ ­following:


You will see something similar to the following:


Each part of the stair can be selected separately:


Change the width of the flight by moving the left or right arrows.


The bottom arrow will change the number of risers from one flight to 
the other. Pulling it downward means more risers in this flight, and vice 
versa.


Click the landing, and you will see something similar to the following:
NOTE

146 • Revit 2018 Architecture


You can change the dimension of all the landings’ sides. To change the 
flight or landing shapes, you need to convert them first to Sketch Edit 
capability.


To do that, and while you are in the stair edit mode, select either flight or 
landing, and at the context tab, click the Convert button.


You will see the following message:


This message is telling you that the conversion process is irreversible; 
click Close after reading it.


Now the Edit Sketch button in the context tab will be enabled, and you 
can customize the shape 
EDITING SKETCHED STAIR


If you have a sketched stair already in place, simply click it (avoid click-
ing the railing, or clicking one flight, make sure to select all the stair 
flights—Use [Tab] key to select it), and at the context tab, you will see 
the following button:
Select Levels button will appear turned off, if you already selected levels 
for multistory stairs


Click the Edit Stairs button. The context tab will change to the ­following:


Select the desired flight, Edit Sketch button will be enabled. You will 
see three different colors:


The context tab will change to the following:


To change a boundary, select Boundary button first. This applies to 
­Risers as well.


You can edit the shape of a boundary for both the landing and the flights.


You can change the riser shapes as well:

148 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CREATING RAMPS


Creating ramps is very similar to creating stairs.


Ramps come in a variety of shapes (straight, arc, circular, etc.). They 
normally cover shallow vertical distances.


To start the command, go to the Architecture tab, locate the Circulation 
panel, and then click the Ramp button:


Using Properties, select the desired ramp family. Set the different 
parameters (which were discussed in creating stairs) like:


The context tab will look like the following:
••
This is like Sketched Stair, so all things discussed there are valid here.
••
Use Run to draw a standard ramp, or use Boundary and Riser to 
sketch.


There are three important things you should know about ramps, and 
all of them are found in the Edit Type button (found in the Properties 
palette):

Creating Stairs, Ramps, and Railings • 149


They are:
••
The Maximum Inclined Length, which is the maximum the ramp run 
can go without a landing (default value is 12m)
••
Max Ramp Slope (1/x), which is the maximum slope of a ramp
••
Shape (thick or solid); check the illustration below:
CREATING RAILINGS


By default the railing will be added when you create a stair or ramp.


Though they are created together, you can modify the railing separately.


You can add railings for other elements like floors to create balconies.


Railings have their own families.


There are multiple methods for dealing with railings:
••
Modify an existing railing of a stair or ramp
••
Create a new railing
Modify Existing Railing


To modify an existing railing, do the following:
••
Hover over the railing until you see a tool tip just like the following 
(you can use the [Tab] key as we did to select other elements):
••
Click to select. The context tab will change to the following:
••
You can Edit the Path of the railing (the railing path can be opened, 
but not overlapped).

150 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
You can Pick a New Host.
••
You can Reset a Railing, hence removing any type changes applied 
to this railing.
Create New Railing


The first method to create a railing is Sketch a Path:
••
To select this command, go to the Architecture tab, click the 
Circulation panel, click the list, and select the Sketch Path button:
••
Select the railing family.
••
The context tab will look like the following:
••
Normal Draw tools are included, along with reference plane tools.
••
You can choose to pick a suitable host (like floors) or Edit Joins.
••
Once you are done, click (✓).


The second method is Place on Host.
••
To select this command, go to the Architecture tab, click the 
Circulation panel, click the list, and select the Place on Host button:
••
Use this when you want to delete an existing railing on stair or ramp 
and insert a new one. You will see the following context tab:
••
Before selecting the desired stair or ramp, select whether you want 
to place the railing on Treads or Stringer, then select the desired 
element.

zontal line, then draw the five arcs
c. From Street 1 to Ground Floor
d. The distance between arcs is 300mm (1'-0")
e. Railing = Glass Panel - Bottom Fill
f. Since the first step drawn is considered by Revit to be the lowest, 
check the stair in 3D after finishing and flip it
24. If you look at it in 3D, you should get the following result:

154 • Revit 2018 Architecture
25. Using the Railing Sketch Path command (select the slab to be the host of 
the railing), sketch at the right of the stairs you’ve just created as in the 
following sketch:
26. Use the same Railing family = Glass Panel - Bottom Fill.
27. Do the same thing for the left part of the stair.
28. Zoom to the right part of the entrance, where we will create a ramp for 
the disabled and elderly people. The ramp should cover the vertical dis-
tance between the street 1 and 00 Ground floor.

CREATING AND  
MANIPULATING VIEWS

160 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CREATING DUPLICATES


You can create a duplicate of any view in Revit.


You can create duplicates of your floor plans and devote them to showing 
dimensions only (we will do that using visibility control).


Another reason for duplicating is to show a portion of your model in a 
certain view using crop region and annotation crop.


For duplicating 3D views, you can show the 3D presentation for each 
floor.


To duplicate a view, do the following:
••
Go to the Project Browser.
••
Locate the desired view.
••
Right-click and you will see the following menu; select Duplicate 
View:
••
There are three types of duplicating; Duplicate, Duplicate with 
Detailing, and Duplicate as a Dependent. The following is discussion 
of each one:
Duplicate


This method will duplicate only model elements like walls, doors, 
­windows, furniture, and so on but will not duplicate anything in the 
Annotate tab, Detail panel, along with tags, dimensions, and text.


Any addition of new elements in the source view will appear in the ­copied 
view after copying, and vice versa.

Creating and Manipulating Views • 161


Any addition of new detail elements, tags, and annotation in the source 
will not appear in the copied view after copying and vice versa, because 
detail elements, tags, and annotation are view-specific elements.
Duplicate with Detailing


This method will duplicate model elements like walls, doors, windows, 
furniture, and so on along with anything in the Annotate tab, Detail 
panel, tags, dimensions, and text (annotation).


Any addition of new elements in the source view will appear in the ­copied 
view after copying, and vice versa.


Any addition of new detail elements, tags, and annotation in the source 
will not appear in the copied view after copying and vice versa, because 
detail elements, tags, annotation are view-specific elements.
Duplicate as a Dependent


This method is perfectly suited for big projects which can be cut into 
zones or areas.


Duplicate as Dependent means any change in one of the views of any 
sort will reflect on the others. Views should be identical in all aspects.


The Duplicate view will appear as a nested view belonging to the parent 
view, something like the following:
Renaming View


Once a new view is created, Revit will give it a temporary name.


You should change the temporary name to something more meaningful.


To rename a view, do the following:
••
Go to the Project Browser.
••
Click the desired view name.

162 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
Right-click and select Rename:
••
You will see the following dialog box; type the new name and  
click OK.
Another way is to press [F2].
Crop Region


Crop Region is a rectangular region shown around the model, and it can 
be resized to show a portion of the model.


Go to the desired view, using Status bar, click Show Crop Region 
button:


You will see the following around the model, click it to show the controls:


Using the blue filled circles, you can resize the crop region.


To turn it off, use the same button in the Status bar.
NOTE

Creating and Manipulating Views • 163
Annotation Crop


This is created specifically for annotation elements like text and tags.


Annotation crop can be as small as the crop region or bigger.


It will hide any annotation element covered or crossed by the crop 
region.


The Crop Region should be activated before the Annotation crop is 
activated.


To activate it go to Properties and select the checkbox of Annotation 
Crop as shown in the following:


To see it, click the Crop Region.


You will see something like the following:
CREATING CALLOUTS


Callout is a portion of the model (plan, section, elevation) selected by 
you to show greater details with larger scale.


There are two types of callouts in Revit:
••
Rectangular shape
••
Sketch, any non-rectangular shape


You have to be in the right view before you issue the command.

164 • Revit 2018 Architecture


To issue this command, go to the View tab, locate the Create panel, 
and click the arrow of the Callout button to see the two available 
options:
Rectangular Shape


For a rectangular shape, specify two opposite corners.


A new view will be created in the same category of views, holding 
the name of the current view plus the word Callout. For example, 
assume your current view name is 00 Ground (floor plan); the tem-
porary callout name will be 00 Ground – Callout 1. Of course, you 
can rename it.


Go to the callout view to find out the scale of the view, and change it 
before you start adding any annotation.


If you click the callout, you will see something like the following:


The blue filled circles allow you to resize the callout and change the 
placement of the callout head (the callout head will be filled with data by 
Revit and not by the user).

Creating and Manipulating Views • 165


Check the following illustration:
Sketch


It is the same as the rectangular callout, except the method of creation 
is different.


You will see the following context tab:


Draw the shape of the callout using Draw tools.


Once you are done, click (✓). The following is an example of a sketch 
callout:
For Both Types


If you click either type, the following context tab will be shown:


Using this context tab, you will be able to edit the crop region of the call-
out, reset the crop region of the callout to its original shape, and resize 
the crop region of the callout.

166 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CONTROL VISIBILITY / GRAPHICS


The Visibility / Graphics dialog box will give you full control to show/hide 
any part of the model or annotation elements.


For example, select to show the furniture in one view and to hide it in 
another.


To issue this command, go to the View tab, locate the Graphics panel, 
and click the Visibility / Graphics button (type at the keyboard the 
shortcut VV, or VG):


The following dialog box will come up:


In this dialog box, do the following:
••
Click the suitable tab at the top (the most important ones are the first 
two, Model Categories and Annotation Categories, which will show/
hide either model elements or annotation elements).
••
If you don’t want to see Furniture elements in a certain view, go to 
the Model Categories tab and turn off the Furniture and Furniture 
systems.
••
If you don’t want to see Dimension elements in certain view, go to 
Annotation Categories and turn it off.
••
If you want to click (on/off) for multiple categories in any tab, select 
them using [Ctrl] at the keyboard. You can use All, None, or Invert 
(Invert means invert the current selection).

EXERCISE 11-1  VIEWS – PART 1
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 11-1.rvt.
3. Go to the 00 Ground floor plan view. Create two duplicates of the 
Ground Floor plan view and name them 00 Ground – Dimension and 
00 Ground – Furniture.
4. In the 00 Ground – Dimension view, start the Visibility/Graphics dialog 
box and turn off Furniture, Furniture System, Casework, Lighting 
­Fixtures, and Plumbing Fixtures.
5. In the 00 Ground – Furniture view, start the Visibility/Graphics dialog box 
and turn off Dimensions.
6. Go to the 00 Ground floor plan view. Create a sketched callout for the 
staircase and elevator and call the new callout 00 Ground – Staircase & 
Elevator.
7. Create a rectangular callout for the two toilets at the left, and call it 
00 Ground-Toilets.
8. Duplicate the South elevation view. Call the new view South-Curtain 
Wall.
9. Show the Crop Region. Resize the Crop Region to show only the curtain 
wall.
10. Hide all levels and Reference Planes. Set the Visual Style = Shaded.
11. Go to the 00 Ground floor plan view.
12. Save and close the file.
CREATING ELEVATIONS


Each template file comes with four elevation views.


You can create as many as you wish. There are two types of Elevations:
••
Building Elevation
••
Interior Elevation


The creation method for both is the same. Bear in mind that you should 
be in the plan view to create elevations.

168 • Revit 2018 Architecture


To issue the command, go to the View tab, locate the Create panel, and 
then click on the Elevation button:


In the Properties, select whether you want Building or Interior:


You will see the following elevation marker:


This marker is sensitive to walls; it will redirect itself when you get closer 
to any wall. Once you are satisfied with its location, click to insert it.


You can control its limits and depth. Click the head (not the circle) to see 
the following:


You can move the two blue dots to resize the coverage size, and the two 
arrows to resize the depth of the elevation.


Revit will give the newly created elevation a temporary name; make sure 
to rename it. 



CREATING SECTIONS


A section can be created with any angle you want. Even if you create it 
horizontally or vertically, you can rotate it later. There are two types:
••
Building Section
••
Wall Section


To issue this command, go to the View tab, locate the Create panel, and 
click the Section button:


The Properties palette will show:


Select whether you want a Building Section or Wall Section.


You have to click two clicks to specify the section. The first point will 
always be the head of the section.


By specifying the two points, you are specifying the angle of the section.
NOTE



After you specify the two points, you will see something like the ­following:


You can move the two blue dots to resize the coverage size and the two 
arrows to resize the depth of the elevation.


Near the head you can see the following:


The two arrows will flip the section head (in the previous example, the 
section head is pointing north; if you click the arrows, it will point south).


The two arrows forming a circle are used to cycle the section head shape; 
you can choose to show Head, Tail, or nothing. This is available at both 
ends.


At the middle you will see the following:

VIEW RANGE


To understand the view range for any floor plan (or ceiling plan), look at 
the following image as your first step:
NOTE

174 • Revit 2018 Architecture


Any floor plan is bound by two planes:
••
The Top Plane is the topmost plane, and you can’t see beyond it.
••
The Bottom Plane is the bottommost plane, and you can’t see below it.


Each plan has a cut plane which is 1200mm (4'-0").


These three planes are called the Primary Range of view.


To control the View Range, go to the desired plan:
••
Using the Properties scroll down, click the View Range Edit button:
••
You will see the following dialog box:
••
If you click the Show button at the lower left corner, the dialog box 
will expand and look like the following:
••
For the Top and Bottom planes, there is a Level and an Offset value. 
You have to specify the associated level, and then input the offset 
value.
••
As for Cut plane, you have to specify the offset value only.
••
You can specify View Depth, which is below the bottom of the pri-
mary range. By default the Bottom should not be below view depth 
level, but rather equal or above it. Elements in the View Depth range 
will be drawn using Beyond line style.

PLAN REGION


Assume you want to show two windows with different sill heights on the 
same floor plan view, bearing in mind you have only one View Range to 
control.


The solution is in the Plan Region command.


You can select a region in your floor plan and define a different View 
Range. To do that Go to the View tab, locate the Create panel, select 
the arrow near the Plan Views button to show the other buttons, and 
select the Plan Region button:


The context tab will look like the following:


The Option bar will include Chain and Offset value.


The previous Draw panel will allow you to draw any shape you want 
around the area you want to modify in the View Range. Properties will 
show the following:


Click the View Range button in Properties, and alter the values as you 
wish.

EXERCISE 11-2  VIEWS – PART 2
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 11-2.rvt.
3. Go to the 00 Ground floor plan.
4. Create two Building Sections, one that cuts the building vertically, and 
one that cuts it horizontally (it should be around the middle of the build-
ing for each section). The vertical should look to east, and the horizontal 
should look to north.
5. Show head for both ends for both sections.
6. Use Gaps in Segments for the vertical section only.
7. Call the horizontal section Section A-A, and the vertical one Section B-B.
8. Use Split Segment to make Section A-A go through the wall of the stair-
case (without cutting the staircase itself); check the result of the section 
before and after.
9. Make sure that both sections cover the building and beyond.
10. Create the following Building Section and call it Left Office.
11. Go to the Left Office Section view and change the crop region to 
show only levels 00 Ground and 01 First. Change the View Detail to 
Medium.

Creating and Manipulating Views • 177
12. Create the Wall Section as shown below at the east entrance; call it 
East Entrance:
13. Go to the East Entrance Section view to see the result. Change the crop 
region to show up to the gable roof and the whole staircase. Extend the 
levels from the left to go beyond the model.
14. Go to the Gentlemen’s toilet; create an Interior Elevation inside the toilet 
showing the four sides. Check each one of these elevations; change the 
size of the crop region to show the whole toilet floor and ceiling. Set the 
Visual Style = Shaded.
15. Create a duplicate of the 3D view, and call it 3D Section B-B.
16. Using the Orient to View command, select Section B-B.
17. Create a duplicate of the 3D view again, and call it 3D East Entrance.
18. Using the Orient to View command, select the Section East Entrance.
19. Go to the 00 Ground floor plan. Zoom to the two toilets; you will 
notice the two window tags appearing at the left of the wall but with-
out seeing the two windows. This is because the sill height of the two 
windows is beyond the cut plane. Start the Plan Region command and 
draw a rectangle around the two windows; click (✓) to finish the com-
mand. At Properties, click View Range and set the Cut Plane Offset 
to 2000 (6'-8").
20. What happens now after we change the View Range inside the Plan 
Region?
21. Go to the 3D view. Create a duplicate of it and rename it 00 Ground 3D.
22. In the newly created 3D view, using the ViewCube, and using the Orient 
to View command, show the 3D of the Ground Floor.

178 • Revit 2018 Architecture
23. Go to the 00 Ground floor plan. Select the stair on the ground floor; using 
the Modify context tab, locate the View panel and click the Selection 
Box button. Duplicate the 3D view and rename it “3D Stair.” Go to the 
3D view and check the Section Box from Properties.
24. Save and close the file.
DEPTH CUEING


Depth Cueing is a tool to help you decide to display elements that are 
farther away from you in a special way using fading.


This feature is available in section and elevation views only.


As a first step, you need to control Far Clipping:
••
Far Clip is the depth of the elevation as shown below:
••
Go to the elevation or section view.
••
From Properties, under Extents, locate Far Clipping:
••
Click on the button and you will see the following dialog box:

Creating and Manipulating Views • 179
••
Select whether you want the clip with a line or without a line (the 
clipped view will have a frame around it). Click OK.
••
Set the Far Clip Offset value.


To activate the Depth Cueing, do the following steps:
••
Click the Visual Style button.
••
Select the Graphics Display Options.
••
You will see the following dialog box:
••
Expand Depth Cueing, and you will see the following:
••
Turn on the Show Depth checkbox; this will enable the fade of 
elements.
••
Control the Fade Start location (which is labeled Near) and start with 
value=0. If you increase the value to be more than 0, the fade will 
start further from the front view plane, hence, it will reduce the fade 
of near elements.
••
Control the Fade End location (which is labeled Far) and start with 
value=100. If you decrease the value to be less than 100, the fade 
limit will be closed to the back view clip plane, hence, it will increase 
the fade of the far elements.
••
When you control the above two sliders, some elements will disap-
pear because Fade Limit % = 0. Increase the value so you can see 
these elements.
••
When done, click OK.


To make your view more realsitic, you can turn on the shadows.

180 • Revit 2018 Architecture
EXERCISE 11-3  DEPTH CUEING

How to create legends
CREATING DIMENSIONS


You can create all types of dimensions for your model such as:
••
Aligned (the most used)
••
Linear
This Chapter Contains:
●
●Creating and editing dimensions
●
●Creating and editing text
●
●Creating legends

LEGENDS

184 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
Angular
••
Radial
••
Diameter
••
Arc Length
••
Spot Elevation
••
Spot Coordinate
••
Spot Slope


You can create a single dimension or series of dimensions using a 
­single command. Also, you can dimension a whole wall (with or without 
openings).


To issue the command, go to the Annotate tab, and locate the Dimension 
panel:
Aligned


It can measure both aligned and orthogonal distances.


Select Aligned. The context tab will repeat the same dimension types, 
which means if you started any dimension command, you can use another 
one without the need to exit the current command.


The Option bar will look like the following:


The first part of the Option bar, the reference line, offers the following 
options:


Choose between Wall centerlines or faces and Core centerlines or faces.


As for Pick, you have the following choices:

Annotation and Legends • 185


Individual Reference means you can pick any element in the model 
(grid line, face of wall, etc.), but if you pick the Entire Walls option, the 
Options button will be enabled; if you click it, you will see the following:


You can select whether to include openings or not; if yes, choose for 
them to be measured from widths or centers.


You can select whether you want to include Intersecting Walls and 
Intersecting Grids while picking the entire wall.


The following is an example of a Wall with an opening:


All of these dimensions are considered to be a single element.
Linear


It can measure orthogonal distances only.


Aligned is more comprehensive.


Points in elements (like walls) will be highlighted.


For example:

186 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Angular


It can measure angles between two reference lines.


The Option bar will show whether your reference lines are Wall center-
lines or faces, or Core centerlines or faces.


For example:
Radial and Diameter


It can measure the radius and diameter of an element.


The Option bar will show whether your reference lines are Wall center-
lines or faces, or Core centerlines or faces.


For example:
Arc Length


It can measure the length of an arc.


The Option bar will show whether your reference lines are Wall center-
lines or faces, or Core centerlines or faces.


You should select the arc first, then select two intersecting references.

Annotation and Legends • 187


For example:
Spot Elevation


It can measure the elevation for floors and ceilings.


The Option bar will look like the following:


Select whether you want Leader or Leader with Shoulder:


For Display Elevation, you have the following choices:


You can show Actual Elevation, Top Elevation, Bottom Elevation, or 
both Top & Bottom Elevations (very important in case of elevation or 
section of floor or roof). For example:
Spot Slope


It can measure the slope of an element.


It should be inserted in Elevation or Section views only.

188 • Revit 2018 Architecture


The Option bar will look like the following:


Specify whether you want to show Arrow or Triangle:


Specify the offset distance from the reference (should not be less than 
1.5mm).
WRITING TEXT


Writing text in Revit Architecture is so easy.


There are two types of text in Revit Architecture:
••
Annotation text
••
Model text
Annotation Text


Use this text type to write any notes to your model (don’t use it to name 
rooms or areas; this will be handled by Room definition and room tags).


To issue this command, go to the Annotate tab, locate the Text panel, 
then click the Text button:


The mouse pointer will change to:

the type of leader (one segment, two segment, or curved).
••
Select the justification of the leader with the text written Top 
Left, Middle Left, Bottom Left, Top Right, Middle Right, or Bottom 
Right.
••
Select Justification of Text Left, Center, or Right.
••
The two tools of Check Spelling and Find and Replace can be reached 
from the context tab or from the Text panel shown above.


Once you specify these things, click using the mouse pointer to specify 
the first point of your text. A new context tab called Edit Text will appear, 
which looks like the following:


Type text and then select any part of it, you can specify any or all of the 
following:
••
Whether you want the text to be Bold, Italic, or Underlined
••
Whether you want the text to be subscript or superscript
••
Whether you want to convert the small letters to capital letters
••
Select whether you want to create a list using four different methods
••
Based on the above, whether you want to decrease indent or increase 
indent
••
Also, you can choose to increment or decrement the list values
••
Once done, click the Close button to end adding and editing the text



If you right-click the second blue circle from the end of the extension 
line of the Aligned dimension, you will see the following menu:


There are two options in this menu that will help you edit the dimension: 
Move Witness Line (already discussed) and Delete Witness Line, 

Annotation and Legends • 193
which means to get rid of this line. To understand this: imagine that you 
used Aligned dimension to dimension from A, to B, and then to C. If 
you delete the Witness Line of B, the new dimension will measure from 
A to C.
Delete Single Aligned Dimension


Using the [Tab] key you can select one dimension out of a continuous 
aligned dimension, and you can delete it.


If you click the text in the dimension, you will see the following:


You can’t put a number in place of the measured distance. But you can:
••

RENDERING IN REVIT – INTRODUCTION


Rendering in Revit is mainly a complementary function rather being 
fundamental. It can produce still rendered images in high quality, but if 
you want better images, use the likes of 3DS Max and Maya.


The Revit rendering engine is the Autodesk Raytracer.


Prepare your view to be rendered. Set the camera view to create the 
proper 3D view. Since almost all of the Revit elements have material 
defined inside them by default, there is no need to assign materials 
for the elements. Finally, add lights, components like furniture, trees, 
­people, and other accessories.
RENDER COMMAND IN REVIT


To render a view in Revit, do the following:
••
Open a 3D perspective or orthographic view.
••
In the View Control Bar, click the Show Rendering Dialog button. 
This option only displays if you are in a 3D view:
••
You will see the Rendering dialog box as shown below:

218 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Quality


Select from the existing list as shown below, or create your own Custom 
(view specific) settings (Draft is the lowest quality and shortest, and Best 
is the highest and longest):
Output Settings


Send the rendering to the screen or to a printer. If you pick the Printer 
option, select the DPI (dots per inch). The Width and Height of the view 
are displayed in pixels and the image size is displayed in megabytes:
Lighting


Under the Lighting section, select a Scheme whether to use the sun and/
or artificial lights, set up the Sun Settings, and finally set the artificial 
lights:
Background


Under the Background section, set the Style for the sky by selecting from 
several options of cloud, a color, an image, or Transparent. (If you export 
the rendered image to PNG or TIFF format, the alpha channel reserves 
the transparent background to be used by other software packages.):
Image


After creating a rendering, Adjust Exposure, Save it to Project (it will be 
saved as view in the Project Browser), and export the image:

Visualize in Revit and Printing • 219


The Exposure Control dialog box looks like the following. Try each one of 
the sliders to make the rendered image, highlights, and shadows brighter 
or darker. Then control the saturation and white point:


In order for these settings to take effect, wait for the next render.
Display


Use the Show the model button to show the model on the screen. Accord-
ingly, Revit will display the model and the button changes to Show the 
rendering to go back to the rendered image.
Render and Render Region


When all of the above settings are controlled, select whether you want 
to render the view displayed on the screen or you want to render a part 
(region) of it.


To do the Region option, click the checkbox and zoom out to see the red 
boundary displayed; click it and resize it.
RENDER AND LIGHTS


Lights in your model are called artificial lights in the Render command.


Make sure to turn on light sources before any rendering. To do this 
­perform the following:
••
Type VG or VV to open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box.
••
Using the Model Categories tab, expand the Lighting Fixtures and 
select the Light Source option:

220 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Setting Up Light Groups


For interior renderings, and in order to save rendering time significantly, 
create light groups just for the room(s) you are working on.


To create a light group, do the following:
••
Open the ceiling plan view, which contains lights you want to group.
••
Select one of the lights.
••
In the Options Bar, locate the Light Group drop-down list and 
select an existing group or select Edit/New option to create a new 
group:
••
If you select Edit/New …, you will see the following dialog box:
••
Click the New button to create and name a new light group; you will 
see the following dialog box. Type in the name and click OK:
••
Select the other lights, and from the Options Bar, select the newly 
created group; you will see the following warning:
••
Click OK to accept.

Visualize in Revit and Printing • 221
••
To activate the light group, start the Render command, under 
Lighting, and select a scheme with Artificial Light mentioned. The 
Artificial Light button will be enabled; click it and turn on your light 
group, and turn off the Ungrouped lights.
Adding Trees and People


To make the scene more lively you can:
••
Add trees; Revit comes with deciduous and coniferous trees of many 
types.
••
Add people components (found in the Library under Entourage) that 
are specifically created for rendering. In a plan, the person displays 
with a point indicating the direction in which they are facing. In a 
3D view, they display as outline. In a rendering, they will display as 
they have been created.
EXERCISE 13-4  RENDERING IN REVIT
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 13-4.rvt.
3. Go to the Site floor plan, and add M_RPC Tree - Fall.rfa American Beech 
6 meters (RPC Tree - Fall.rfa American Beech 20') trees as shown below:
4. Go to the 00 Ground Ceiling plan and zoom to the top left office. 
Create a group of lights and call it Manager Office, and add the four 
lights to it.
5. Go to the 00 Ground Floor plan and add the three Standup lamps to the 
same group.
6. Using the Entourage folder in the libraries, add M_RPC Female.rfa (RPC

CREATING SHEETS


Construction sheets in Revit are very simple and straightforward.


You will create a sheet based on a title block template (in this chapter we 
will use the ones that come with Revit).


Then add one or more views into the sheet.


There are two ways to create a new sheet:
••
Go to the Project Browser, locate Sheets (all), right-click, and select 
New Sheet option:
••
Go to the View tab, locate the Sheet Composition panel, and then 
click the Sheet button:

Visualize in Revit and Printing • 223


Using either way, you will see the following dialog box:


You can see only one loaded paper size. To load more, click the Load



Load, or use the pre-loaded title block, then click OK, and you will see 
the following:

224 • Revit 2018 Architecture


At the lower right side of the title block, you will see some information 
already filled in, like the client name and project number. This informa-
tion was filled into the Project Information dialog box at the beginning 
of this book.


Other pieces of information can be filled either by clicking the field in 
the title block, or by going to the Project Information dialog box and 
editing it there.


The following is an example of editing the data inside the title block:


Another way to change information is the Properties palette:



To insert a view inside a sheet, locate it in the Project Browser, click it 
once, and drag and drop it inside the sheet.

226 • Revit 2018 Architecture


If the frame of the view is bigger than the available space, you may need 
to check the following things:
••
The scale of the view should be changed.
••
The crop region of the view is big, and you need to resize it.


The title line will appear with each view dropped in a sheet:
••
It can be moved up and down.
••
You can lengthen or shorten it by the two ends.
••
By default, Revit will show the name of the view, but you can show a 
different name using the Properties palette:


Once you start inserting sections, elevations, and callouts, all the heads in 
the plans will be populated with the right sheet number, as shown below:
By default, you will deal with the view as a picture (you can’t edit its 
contents). If you need to work inside it, you need to activate it inside 
the sheet. Click the view inside the sheet, and then right-click and select 
Activate View. When done, right-click and select Deactivate View:


You can rotate a view inside a sheet. Click the view and set the rotation 
angle in the Options bar:

CREATING SCHEDULES


Schedules in Revit are data collected from the project file, whether they 
were counting schedules (door and window schedules) or quantity take-
off for construction material.


All the data is there, and all you have to do is put them in a nice, neat 
table. Since Revit is a total BIM solution, data that appear in the sched-
ules are connected in two ways with the project data; any change in the 
project will reflect on the schedule, and vice versa.


There are two ways to start the Schedule command:
••
Go to the Project Browser and locate a group called Schedules/
Quantities; right-click this group to see the following list:

SCHEDULE KEY STYLES


A key schedule will help you fill a finishing schedule quickly and easily.


Create a key schedule using a key name, which will group finishes of a 
room (as an example) and then apply it to the normal schedule.


To create a Schedule Key Style do the following:
••
Go to the View tab, locate the Create panel, expand the Schedules, 
and click the Schedule/Quantities option.
••
You will see the following dialog box; select a category, then select the


When done, go to the schedule you would like to populate. Add a col-
umn to the schedule (such as the Room Style column). Once you input 
the key name, the columns will be filled automatically, like the following:
REUSING SCHEDULES


You can reuse schedules you created in other projects. This is a very good 
tool to avoid repeating the same procedure in each project.


To save a schedule to a file, do the following:
••
In the Project browser, right-click on the schedule you want to save 
and select the Save to New File option.

Room_Schedule_yourname.rvt.

Creating Schedules • 245
7. Start a new project and import it to it. What exactly did you import (how 
many schedules?) and why? _____________________________________
8. Save and close the project.
CREATING PROJECT PARAMETERS


Project Parameter is the perfect way to add user-defined parameters.


There are two types of pararmeters:
••
Project parameters can be used in schedules, but not in tags.
••
Shared parameters can be used in schedules and in tags. You can use 
them in other projects as well.


To create a Project parameter, do the following:
••
In the Schedule Properties dialog box, in the Fields tab, click New 
Parameter.
••
You will see the following dialog box; select the Project parameter 
option, as shown below:
••
Under the Parameter Data part, type in a Name for the parameter 
and select the Discipline, Group, and Type of Parameter in the drop-
down lists. Choose whether it is an Instance or a Type:
••
Instance parameters means for each instance of an element, this 
parameter will change. Type parameters means for all instances of an 
element, the parameter will be the same.
••
The Discipline can be set to: Common, Structural, or Electrical (in 
MEP also HVAC and Piping).

246 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
Type of Parameter specifies how it will be stored inside Revit:
••
The Group parameter under the drop-down will specify where this 
parameter will be shown in Properties and Family Types dialog boxes:
CREATING FIELDS FROM FORMULAS


Another way to create a new parameter is to create a formula. This is 
very popular in quantity take-off schedules.


You can create either a formula or percentage.


You have to add the right fields as your first step.


To create a Calculated Value field, do the following:
••
In the Schedule Properties dialog box, under the Fields tab, click 
Add calculated parameter button. The Calculated Value dialog box 
opens as shown in the following:
••
Type in a Name for the new field.
••
Specify Formula as the type of field.

Creating Schedules • 247
••
Select the Discipline and Type as desired.
••
For the Formula, click the small button (with the three dots) to guar-
antee you get the exact field name, as shown below:


Percentage fields can be used with area schedules.


To create a Perecentage Field, do the following:
••
Using the Schedule Properties dialog box, under the Fields tab, click 
Add calculated parmeter button. The Calculated Value dialog 
box opens:
••
Type a Name for the new field.
••
Specify Percentage as the type of field.
••
Select the field you want to take a percentage Of.
••
Select the field you want to take a percentage By.
••
The default value is <Grand total>, which means Revit will calculate 
the percentage based on the total of the entire schedule.
CONDITIONAL FORMATTING


Conditional formatting is to highlight a column in a different color in the 
schedule using condition(s).


To create Conditional Formatting in a schedule, do the following:
••
Go to the desired schedule and click the Formatting tab.
••
Select the desired field.

248 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
Click the Conditional Format button.
••
You will see the following dialog box; select the Field, Test, and spec-
ify a Value, as shown in the following:
••
Click on the Background Color button and select a color to display 
in the schedule when the condition is satisfied. You can add more 
conditions.
••
This is will be the result:
CREATING MATERIAL TAKEOFF SCHEDULES


You can create a special schedule, called Material Takeoff, which collects 
information about materials in a project and user-defined parameters.


You can also create formulas or percentages based on material properties 
using the Calculated value option.


To create a Material Takeoff Schedule, do the following:
••
Go to the View tab, locate the Create panel, expand Schedules, and 
click the Material Takeoff option.
••
Using the dialog box, select the Category. Type a Name and then 
click OK.
••
Using the Material Takeoff Properties dialog box, click the Fields tab 
and select the desired fields. You should include at least one of the 
Material fields (e.g., Material : Name, Material : Cost, etc.).

Material:Area.
21. Use the Filter set Function = Exterior, and Material = Concrete Masonry 
Units.
22. Look at your schedule.
23. In order to calculate the number of CMU in one square meter, we have to 
multiply the area by 12.5, then round it off (there are 112.5 per 100 SF).
24. Using Properties, click the Fields button, click the Add calculated 
­parameter button, and set the name to be CMU. It is Common, and it is 
Integer. The formula will be (Material:Area/1) *12.5 (for imperial use the 
following formula: (Material:Area/100) * 112.5)).
25. Go to the Formatting tab, select CMU from left, and select Calculate 
totals.

PROJECT PHASING


If your project is divided into phases, or you have renovations or ­additions 
to your existing building, then you need this feature in Revit.


You can define existing, demolished, and new phases, and more.


You can apply phases to elements and control them using views.


There will always be the current phase, and when you draw a new 
­element, it will be assigned to it automatically.


Go to Properties, make sure there are no elements selected, scroll down 
to the Phasing area, and you will see something like the following:


Set the Phase for elements created in the view (by default there are two 
phases, Existing or New Construction—the default phase).
This Chapter Contains:
●
●Project Phases

●Design Options
PROJECT PHASING AND  
DESIGN OPTIONS

254 • Revit 2018 Architecture


Set the Phase Filter to determine which phases are displayed in the view.


For example, if Phase 2 is current, the Show Complete filter displays all 
construction up to Phase 2. Show All means it will display all phases up 
to the current phase with all except the current phase grayed out.
Use the Duplicate view command to create duplicates of a view, and then 
apply different phase filters to each view.


For example, you may want to show existing and demolished in one view 
and existing and new items in another view.
Phases and Elements


To assign/modify phases for elements, you should select them first, check 
Properties, and you will see something like the following:


All system and component elements will have phases.


By default, Phase Created is set to New Construction and Phase 
Demolished is set to None unless you change them.


On the other hand, you can’t assign phases for annotation elements (e.g., 
dimensions, text, and tags), view elements (e.g., sections, elevations, and 
callouts) and datum elements (e.g., grids and levels).


You should use Filter in the context tab if you select multiple elements 
seeking to assign a phase for them, in order to rule out annotation, view, 
and datum elements.
How to Demolish Elements


To demolish an element, do the following:
••
Go to the Modify tab, locate the Geometry Panel, and select the 
Demolish button.
••
Select the elements to mark as demolished in the current phase.
••
Press [Esc] to end the command.
NOTE

Project Phasing and Design Options • 255


If you demolish a wall, doors or windows associated with it will be demol-
ished as well.


To reverse the process, select the demolished element, go to Properties, 
and change Phase Demolished to be None.


Curtain Walls, Panels, Grids, and Mullions can’t be assigned to a phase, 
but the wall type can be.



Normally you start adding elements after you define Design Options, 
but what if you have already elements in your model and you want to add 
them to the Design Option? The first thing is you have to select elements 
before you activate a Design Option. Do the following:
••
Make sure that Main Model is the Active Design Option.
••
Select the elements that you want to add in a Design Option.
••
Go to the Manage tab, locate the Design Options panel, and click 
the Add to Set button:
••
The Add to Design Option Set dialog box will be displayed. From 
the Add selection to drop-down list, select the Design Option Set. 
Then select the option(s) as shown in the following:


When done, click OK. The elements are added to the option(s) and will 
not be modified in the main model.


In typical views, only elements in the primary Design Option will be 
displayed, but they cannot be selected. In order to select these elements, 
you turn off the Exclude Options checkbox in the Status bar before 
selecting:

How to Add New Elements to a Design Option


In order to add new elements to a Design Option, do the following:
••
Set as current the desired Design Option, as shown in the following:
••
Main Model elements will be grayed out, but new elements will be 
displayed in black.
••
Add or modify elements as you wish.
••
Finally, set the Active Design Option to Main Model.
How to View Design Options


The best way to present your Design Options is to create views and 
­display each Design Option(s) in a separate view.


To accomplish this, do the following:
••
Create a view (Floor Plan, Elevation, Section, or 3D view).
••
Start the Visibility/Graphic dialog box.
••
Go to the Design Options tab, and you will see the Design Option 
Set you previously created. Using the drop-down list for each Design 
Option Set, select the desired Design Option. The default value is 
<Automatic>, which means using the primary option:
••
Click the Pick to Edit button in order to open a Design Option by 
selecting an element contained in the option. Go to the Manage tab, 
locate the Design Options panel, and click the Pick to Edit button:

Delete Design Options


Once you present your design options to the client and agree on one of 
them, you can delete all other options in the project.


To accomplish this, do the following:
••
Set Main Model to be the Active Design Option.
••
Open the Design Options dialog box.
••
Select the option you want to keep and click the Make Primary 
button.
••
Select the Option Set and click the Accept Primary button.
••

TOPOSURFACES IN REVIT

268 • Revit 2018 Architecture
PROJECT BASE POINT AND SURVEY POINT


Every project has a Project Base Point and a Survey Point, as shown in 
the following:
   


You can see both points when you go to the Site plan view.
Project Base Point


Revit doesn’t deal with a coordinate system like AutoCAD, which has 
WCS and UCS.


Project Base Point describes the origin (0,0,0) of the project coordinate 
system.


It influences the absolute elevation of your model.


To modify the Project Base Point, click on the icon (circle with × inside 
it) and modify N/S, E/W, Elev, and Angle to True North.


Another way is to input the values in Properties, as shown in the ­following:


Make sure that your model is less than 20 miles (32 Km) from the loca-
tion of the project base point if you want to accurately deal with Revit.
Survey Point


Survey Point is a specific point in the real world, such as a survey marker.


It is used to orient the building when shared with a program that uses a 
different coordinate system (like Civil 3D software, for instance).


Unclip Survey Point first to specify its coordinates.

Toposurfaces in Revit • 269
To display your model with True North, do the following:
••
Duplicate the plan view that you want to rotate to true north (most 
likely the Site plan view).
••
Go to Properties of the true north plan and set the Orientation to True 
North, as shown in the following:


Accordingly, the view rotates to show True North specified in the Project 
Base Point.
CREATING TOPOSURFACES


You can create a toposurface using one of the following methods:
••
Inputting points manually
••
Importing a CAD file with 3D points
••
Importing a points file which contains X, Y, Z points
Inputting Points Manually


To create a toposurface by inputting points, do the following:

how contours are displayed in both plan and section views, as in the 
following:


Under Contour Line Display:
••
At Intervals of: this value will specify the distance between the 
primary contour line and another. They will display in a heavy line 
style.
••
Passing Through Elevation: For primary contour lines, this value 
will specify the starting elevation for them. Example: if you type 5, 
instead of the default value 0, then the primary contour lines will pass 
through 5, 5005, 10005, and so on.


Under Additional Contours:
••
Start / Stop: Specify the start and stop of additional contour lines.
••
Increment: If Range Type is Multiple Value, then Increment means 
the distance between an additional contour and another.
••
Range Type: Single Value means you can specify the location of 
the single contour in the Start Value; Increments are not available. 
Normally we want to display a group of additional contours.
••

EDITING TOPOSURFACES


Normally you will have the existing toposurface. But you will need Revit 
to help you create the proposed toposurface, which will be your final 
product.


Using commands like Subregion, Split Surface, and Graded Region will 
allow you to design drainage away from your building, and specify the car 
parking lots and other utilities.
Creating Subregions


Subregions will help you specify materials for parts of the toposurface 
without changing the existing contour lines.


To create a subregion, do the following:
••
Go to the Massing & Site tab, locate the Modify Site panel, and 
click Subregion button:
••
In the context tab, use the Draw tools to sketch the borders of a 
subregion.
••
Using Properties, set the Material for the subregion as desired.
••
Click (✓) to finish the command.
••
To modify an existing subregion, click its border; in the context tab, 
locate the Subregion panel then click the Edit Boundary button. You 
will be back to sketch mode to make the necessary changes.
••
To delete an existing subregion, select it and press the [Del] key.

280 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Splitting Surfaces


Split Surface command will really split toposurface into discrete parts. 
You can modify and assign material for each one by itself.


To split a surface, do the following:
••
Go to the Massing & Site tab, locate the Modify Site panel, and 
click the Split Surface button:
••
Select the desired toposurface.
••
In the context tab use the Draw tools to draw the borders of the split-
ting boundary. Each split process should end up with two separate 
boundaries. It is accepted in this type of boundary to be open.
••
Using Properties, set the Material for the surface as desired.
••
Click (✓) to finish the command.
Merging Surfaces


If you split surfaces and want to undo your work, you can use Merge 
Surfaces to finish the job. The only condition is they should be adjacent 
to each other.


To join surfaces do the following:
••
Go to the Massing & Site tab, locate the Modify Site panel, and 
click the Merge Surfaces button:
••
Select the two adjacent surfaces in no particular order.
••
Material of the first picked surface will be applied to the newly 
­created surface.
Grading a Site


Revit doesn’t have the best grading tool comparing to other specialized 
software, but this command is good enough for architects.


Use this command to change the nature of the existing surface by chang-
ing the elevation of the points to match your intended design.

Toposurfaces in Revit • 281


Don’t forget to change the phase of the existing surface before you pro-
ceed with this command. Set the Phase Created of the surface to be 
Existing.


Revit automatically calculates the Cut and Fill for the surface. This infor-
mation is displayed in Properties.


To grade a site, do the following:
••
Make sure that Phase Created of the surface is Existing.
••
Go to the Massing & Site tab, locate the Modify Site panel, and 
click the Graded Region button:
••
You will see the following dialog box. It will inform you that the exist-
ing toposurface is demolished (that’s why we set the Phase Created 
to Existing) and a matching toposurface was created in the current 
phase, and asks how you want the new toposurface to be copied. The 
options are either to create a copy of the original, or a copy based on 
the perimeter points only:
••
Select the desired toposurface.
••
In the context tab use the tools to add more points, delete points, or 
set new elevation for existing points.
••
Click (✓) to finish the command.
ANNOTATING TOPOSURFACES


In order to label a toposurface, use commands like: Label Contours 
(already discussed), Spot Elevation, and Spot Coordinate; add to that 
normal commands like Dimension and Text.

282 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Spot Elevations and Spot Coordinates


Spot Elevation displays the elevation of a selected point, while Spot 
Coordinate displays the coordinate data of the project:
   


To add Spot Elevations / Coordinates, do the following:
••
Go to the Annotate tab, locate the Dimension panel, and click Spot 
Elevation or Spot Coordinate buttons.
••
Using Properties, select the type that you want to use.
••
Using the Options Bar, select whether to show Leader and Shoulder. 
For Spot Elevation, specify the Display Elevations option as shown:
••
Select a point to dimension and place the leader line and target or 
text. Revit automatically displays the information from the selected 
point. Click Modify or press [Esc] to end the command.
SITE AND PARKING COMPONENTS


As your final touches, you can add trees and other landscaping shapes, 
along with parking spaces. These are just like other components we 
added previously, but these will be placed on the contours and not on 
the levels.


To access site and parking components, go to the Massing & Site tab, 
locate the Model Site panel, and then click the Site Component ­button 
or Parking Component button:

INTRODUCTION TO CREATING ROOMS


If you have bounding walls (curtain walls as well) you can create a room 
element. Revit will give it a name and a number, and you can modify 
both.


Use the Room Separator Line to create rooms in open areas.


Revit will calculate Area and Perimeter by default. To calculate Volume, 
Revit needs Floor, Roof, or Ceiling.


Later you can create schedules for Rooms, accordingly room finishing, 
and quantity take-off.


Also, you can create Color Scheme plans.

CREATING AND MODIFYING ROOMS
To Create Rooms One by One


To create rooms one by one, do the following steps:
••
Go to the Architecture tab, locate the Room & Area panel, and 
click the Room button:
••
Using the context tab click Tag on Placement to add a tag when 
placing a room.
••
Using the Option Bar, set the Upper Limit. The default Offset value 
is the height of the level. This will control the volume calculations, as 
shown previously:
••
Also, you can set how the tag will be placed; you have three options, 
Horizontal, Vertical, and Model (this tag can be rotated to be aligned 
with walls and other boundaries). Set whether you want a Leader 
with the tag or not.
••
Set whether the room to be placed will be a New room requiring 
a new name, or a repetition of an existing room; select the appro-
priate choice from the drop-down list (you should create a schedule 
­containing all your rooms with their associated numbers).
••
Click inside the desired bounded area to place the room:

and change the family to M_Room Tag Room Tag with Area (Room Tag 
Room Tag with Area).
12. Start the Schedule command and create a new Room Schedule as shown 
(Call it Ground Floor Room Schedule) using the following fields:
13. Save and close the file.
CREATING AREAS


You can define two types of areas in Revit: Gross Building and Rentable.


Gross Area is the total area of the building, and it is measured from the 
outer face of the external walls. You can have for each level a separate 
gross area plan.


Rentable Area is area measurements based on the standard method for 
measuring floor area in office buildings.


There are three steps you will do:
••
Create Area Plan
••
Create Area Boundaries
••
Create Areas
Creating Area Plan


To create an Area Plan, do the following steps:
••
Go to Architecture tab, locate Room & Area panel, expand Area, 
and click Area Plan button:

Creating Rooms and Areas • 295
••
You will see the following dialog box; select the type of area plan, 
either Gross Building or Rentable:
••
Select one or more level(s) for which you want to create new views. 
Each level has an area plan created for it.
••
Revit will show the following message, asking to automatically create 
area boundary lines associated with all external walls as shown below:
••
Click Yes. In your Project Browser you will see that area plans are 
created for the desired levels, as shown in the following illustration. 
Revit will create Gross Building views separate from Rentable views:
••
For Gross Building, boundary lines are created on the outside edge of 
the exterior walls, whereas for Rentable area plans, they are created 
on the inside edge of the exterior walls.
Placing Area Boundaries


The next step is to create area boundary lines in the Rentable area plan 
to define parts of the building, such as offices, stores, and common areas.

296 • Revit 2018 Architecture


To create Area Boundary lines, do the following steps:
••
Go to the Rentable Area Plan you want to work in.
••
Go to Architecture tab, locate Room & Area panel, and click Area 
Boundary Line button:
••
Using the context tab, select the desired sketch tool:  Using Pick 
Lines, Revit will show in the Option bar a checkbox called Apply 
Area Rules, which means you will add boundary lines from the faces 
or center of the selected wall according to the type of area you are 
specifying.
••
Using Line or Rectangle tools, boundary lines will stay as drawn 
regardless of area types you apply to them.
Adding Areas


This is the third and final step of Area definition process.


Adding areas is similar to adding rooms.


Using Properties, you can specify the area type, which controls the loca-
tion of the boundary lines.


For instance, if you are working in the Rentable Area Plan, the Office 
area type will select the center of the wall, the major vertical penetration 
uses the outside edge of the wall, whereas the building common area 
used the inside edge of the wall.


To add an area, do the following steps:
••
Go to Architecture tab, locate Room & Area panel, expand Area 
button, and click Area button:

Creating Rooms and Areas • 297
••
Before you place the area, go to Properties and set the Area Type. 
Hover your mouse pointer over the closed area boundaries and click 
to add. The default tag will display the name of the area and the area 
value.
••
Press [Esc] to end the command.


As we did with Room definition, you can select multiple areas to edit the 
name and number collectively.


If in the future you changed the area boundaries or moved the walls con-
nected to them, the calculated area would be changed accordingly.
Tagging Areas


Go to Architecture tab, locate Room & Area panel, expand Tag Area 
button, and click Tag Area button:
You can create Gross Area or Rentable Area Schedules that include the 
area, name, and type, as we did with Room Schedule.
EXERCISE 17-2  CREATING AREAS
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 17-2.rvt.
3. Start the Area Plan command, select type = Gross Building, select 00 
Ground. Click Yes in the alert box to create boundary lines at the external 
walls. The gross area = 842 m2 (9058 SF).
4. Using the Area Plan command create a Rentable area plan for 00 Ground. 
Click Yes at the prompt to create boundary lines at external walls. The 
area boundary is on the inside wall of the building this time.
NOTE

298 • Revit 2018 Architecture
5. Add area boundaries and areas (specify area type from Properties):
6. Using the Schedule command, create a Rentable Area Schedule. Show 
the name, area type, and area:
7. Save and close the file.
CREATING COLOR SCHEMES


Create Color Schemes that show the various uses for rooms and areas.


You can show different color schemes according to Room/Area names, 
area value, and so on.


To create a color scheme in a view, do the following steps:
••
Make sure you are in the right view (normally you need to duplicate 
the view and apply the color scheme to the duplicate).
••
Using Properties, under Graphics locate the Color Scheme param-
eter, and click the button next to it, as shown:

Creating Rooms and Areas • 299
••
You will see the Edit Color Scheme dialog box; locate the Schemes 
area, and from Category select the desired category (normally if you 
are in Area plan rentable, your available choice is Areas Rentable). 
Select an existing scheme as shown below. Click OK. The new color 
scheme displays in the view.


Add a legend that matches the Color Scheme. Go to Annotate tab, 
locate Color Fill panel, and click Color Fill Legend button:


Add the legend in the desired place as shown:
Creating a New Color Scheme


To create a new color scheme, do the following steps:
••
In the desired view, make sure that nothing is selected. Using 
Properties, locate Color Scheme and click the button next to it. 
Another way is to go to Architecture tab, locate Room & Area 
panel, expand the panel title, and click Color Schemes button:

300 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
Either way you will see the Edit Color Scheme dialog box; under 
Schemes, select a Category: Areas (Gross Building), Areas (Rentable), 
or Rooms, as shown:
••
Select an existing scheme and click the Duplicate button:
••
In the New color scheme dialog box, type the name of the new 
scheme.
••
Type a Title for the new color scheme. This displays when the legend 
is placed in the view.
••
Use the Color drop-down list to choose an existing color scheme, as 
shown:
••
Select whether you want the scheme to be By value or By range (dis-
cussed later).
••
Use the green plus button to add more rows to the scheme, as shown. 
Control the visibility (Visible column), Color, and Fill Pattern as you 
wish. In Use is the read-only parameter:

Creating Rooms and Areas • 301
Color Scheme By Value


If you select By value option, value is assigned by the parameter data for 
the room or area object like Name, Number, Area, Parameter (these are 
for Rooms).


Values are automatically updated when new data is introduced. 


By default, Revit will sort the data that will be displayed; to change this 
order, select the desired row and use arrow up and arrow down as shown:


To remove a row, select it and click the red minus sign. This is only 
permissible if the data is not used in the room or area elements in the 
project.
Color Scheme By Range


By range option means you have to specify a range (for example area 
values). Change the At Least variable and the Caption, as well as the 
visibility, color, and fill pattern, as shown in the following:


Only Area and Perimeter parameters can be set by range.

302 • Revit 2018 Architecture


To change how the units are displayed, click Edit Format to control the 
units display format; you will see the following dialog box:


Click off the Use project settings checkbox and change the settings as 
you wish.


To add a new row, make sure to select the row above the new row then 
click Add Value. The new row increments according to the previous dis-
tances set or double the value of the first row.
EXERCISE 17-3  CREATING COLOR SCHEMES

INTRODUCTION


In this chapter, you will learn how to:
••
Add tags for different Revit elements whether in 2D or 3D views
••
Create details using different methods, including importing ready-
made AutoCAD details drawings
HOW TO ADD TAGS IN REVIT


Some elements like Doors and Windows have a button while adding 
them, allowing you to place the tag with the element.


Walls, on the other hand, and other Revit elements don’t have this 
capability; hence, Revit provides you with three tools to add tags for 
any desired element, except Rooms which have separate commands as 
­discussed previously.


There are three ways to tag in Revit, they are:
••
Tag by Category 
••
Multi-Category
••
Material

Tag by Category


This method will tag individual elements according to their category. It 
will insert Window tags on window, and Furniture tags on furniture.


The tag should be loaded prior to the command, or Revit will give you 
the following message:


Allowing you to load the desired tag family.


To issue this command, go to Annotate tab, locate Tag panel, then click 
Tag by Category button:


In the Options bar, you will see the following:


It contains the following things:
••

will be displayed horizontally or vertically:
••
Select whether you want the tag with leader or without a leader.
••
Select whether you want the tag as attached end or free end:
••
For attached end, you can specify the length of the leader.

Tagging and Detailing • 307


After you specify these settings, simply click the desired element and a 
tag will be placed.


To tag all the incidences of a certain element, you can use the Tag All 
command; this will add tags to all desired elements in the current view.


To issue this command, go to Annotate tab, locate Tag panel, and then 
click Tag All button:


You will see the following dialog box:


This dialog box title is “Tag All Not Tagged.” The first sentence at the top 
reads: “Select at least one Category and Tag Family to tag non-tagged 
objects.” This is a self-explanatory sentence.


The default option is to add tags for “All objects in current view.” You can 
add to “Include elements from linked files.”


Select the desired tag(s) by clicking and holding [Ctrl] to select multi-
ple tags. If you want all tags in this dialog box, click the checkbox near 
Category

CREATING DETAILS


There is more than one way to create a detail in Revit. They are:
••
Create a detail view from scratch.
••
Use one of the callouts as your starting point, and then add to it the 
necessary adjustment to make it a detail.

Tagging and Detailing • 311
••
Get an AutoCAD detail and convert it to Revit elements.
••
Get an AutoCAD detail and link it to the section view.
Creating a Detail View from Scratch


You need to create an empty view first. To do that, go to View tab, locate 
Create tab, and then click Drafting View button:


You will see the following dialog box:


Type the name of the new view, specify scale, and click OK. This will 
create a new empty view.


Go to the Annotate tab, locate the Detail panel, and you will see the 
following:


Use any of the following tools to draw your detail:
••
Detail Line, to draw lines, arcs, and so on using Line Style. This 
appears in the following context tab:
••
Revision Cloud
••
Region: there are two choices: Filled Region and Masking Region. 
Using Properties, select the desired pattern to be used.

312 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
For Component, you will see the following:
••
Both the Detail and Repeating Detail Component will be selected 
from Properties. Some of the Detail Component is pre-loaded, but 
lots of them will need you to Load Family first.
••
Go to the Detail Items folder, and you will see something like the 
following:
••
That represents the 16-division system of Construction Specification 
Items (CSI). It contains lots of ready-made parts that will help you 
build your detail easily.
••
Finally, Insulation, which will create an insulation pattern. This is 
good for sections.
Callout or Section as Starting Point


Another way to draw a detail is to create a callout or wall section, and 
then add to it any of the above-mentioned tools.


Since the callout and the wall section will show part of the model, then 
you can use Keynotes.


There are three types of Keynotes:
••
Element Keynote: which will tag the desired element with the ­keynote 
specified for the element
••
Material Keynote: which will tag the desired element with the ­keynote 
specified for the material existing in the element
••
User Keynote: which will tag the desired element with a tag you will 
select.

Tagging and Detailing • 313


To see a wall keynote (for instance), select one wall and click Edit Type. 
Under Identity Data, check the Keynote field. Click the small button 
with three dots inside it, and you will see something like the following:
••
Keep selecting the sub-categories up until you reach to what you 
want.
••
The final value will be something like the following:


If you go to the Material Browser, locate your desired material; at the 
right, click Identity tab. Under Revit Annotation Information, locate 
Keynote.


Repeat the same procedure we did earlier. It will look like the following:


Starting with an AutoCAD File


Since there are millions of people who have used AutoCAD and are still 
using it, most likely all of the companies will have a huge library of details.


Create a drafting view just we did above, then either link or import the 
AutoCAD file (we recommend importing).


You have two paths to take:
••
Leave the file intact without any change, and link it to one of the 
­sections. To do the linking, start the Section command (Wall Section) 
at the context tab and you will see a Reference other view ­checkbox; 
click it, and then select the name of the drafting view containing your 
detail:
••
This is the shape of the section:
••
The second path will be to import an AutoCAD drawing and then 
Explode it.

Tagging and Detailing • 315
••
After explosion, it will be converted to Revit elements. You will start 
to change text lines to line styles of your own. You can add any other 
detailing components like we learned about previously.
In order to use the same detail in future projects, you have to save the 
view. To do that go to Application Menu, select Save As, then Library, 
and select View:


You will see the following dialog box:


Save the view(s) in your desired folder. It will be *.rvt.

CREATING GROUPS


If you ever used AutoCAD, Group in Revit is like Block in AutoCAD.


Grouping elements in Revit will cut production time significantly if you 
are using repeating layouts like in designing schools and colleges.


There are three types of groups in Revit:
••
Model Groups: which contain model elements
••
Detail Groups: which contain view-specific elements such as text, 
dimension, tags, and filled regions
••
Attached details group: which contains both model elements and 
detail elements together. Revit will not create a group containing 
both model and view-specific elements, so it will create model group 
and detail group associated with it.
This Chapter Contains:

326 • Revit 2018 Architecture
EXERCISE 19-1  USING GROUPS
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 19-1.rvt.
3. You should be in the Gents Room view in floor plans; if not, go to this 
view.
4. Add the following elements (all available in the project):
a. Start Wall command, change Location Line to Finish Face Interior.
b. Using wall family Interior – 66 mm partition (Interior - 5 1/2" ­Partition 
(1-hr)) draw a 1430 × 1430 (4'-6" × 4'-6") wall.
c. Add a Single Leaf Door (with tag) 600 × 2000mm (Single-Flush 
26" × 76") at the middle of the wall.
d. Add M_Toilet Commercial Wall-3D -380mm Seat Height (Toilet-
Commercial-Wall-3D 15" Seat Height).
5. You should get something like the following picture:
6. Select the two walls, the door with the tag, and the toilet.
7. Create a group, name the Model Group as Toilet, and the Attached 
Detail Group as Door Tag.
8. Move the origin point to the upper left corner of the toilet.
9. Using the Place Model Group, from Properties select Toilet group, place 
a copy of the group directly to the right of the original group (you will 
notice that door tag is not displayed).
10. Click Finish to complete the process.

Creating Groups and Revit Links • 327
11. Select the new group. Using the Attached Detail Groups button, select 
the Door Tag detail group and click OK. The tag is added to the instance 
of the group.
12. Using the Project Browser, place two more copies of the model group 
Toilet in the project.
13. The last group does not need the right wall. Hover over the element that 
you want to exclude, press [Tab] until it highlights, and select the element.
14. Click the icon to only exclude the wall from that group. Click in empty 
space to complete the process. But you can see that it didn’t solve the 
problem, as the horizontal wall is still too short to meet the vertical wall.
15. Select the last group and Ungroup it. Delete the vertical wall, and extend 
the horizontal wall.
16. Using the Application Menu, select Save As / Library / Group. In the Save 
Group dialog box, go to your class folder and save the group with the same 
name as the group.
17. Save and close the file.
LINKING MODELS – INTRODUCTION


If you have ever used AutoCAD, this is like XREF command.


You can link any RVT file inside another RVT file; if the original changes 
the linked copy will update accordingly.


Link the model once, but you can place it as many times as you wish. The 
linked model can be moved, copied, rotated, and arrayed.


To place the linked model in the exact place, use Reference Planes (you 
can lock the linked model to the reference planes if needed).


You can schedule elements from the linked model in the host project.


You can tag doors, windows, rooms, and areas of the linked model in the 
host model.

328 • Revit 2018 Architecture
LINKING MODELS


To add a linked model to the host project, do the following steps:
••
Go to Insert tab, locate Link panel, and click Link Revit button as 
in the following:
••
You will see the Import/Link RVT dialog box; select the file that you 
want to link. Before opening the file, set the Positioning as shown. 
Click Open to start the placing process:


Go to the Project Browser and locate Revit Links as shown below; if you 
need more copies of the link, drag and drop into the project:


You can also use the Copy command and Copy to clipboard to copy 
instances of a linked model. The new copies are also links as well.
MANAGING LINKS


To control the linked model, go to Insert tab, locate Link panel, and 
click Manage Links button:

Creating Groups and Revit Links • 329


Another way to reach the same command is when you select a linked file, 
the context tab will show a panel called Link; click the Manage Links 
button:


In Manage Links dialog box, go to the Revit tab, and you can modify 
other properties of the link:


Control all or any of the following:
••
Status: shows current status of the linked file (Loaded or Not Loaded). 
This is read-only.
••
Reference Type: there are two choices, either Attach or Overlay. 
To understand Reference Type, imagine multiple people using linked 
files. Let’s assume that B brings in a linked model to his/her file from 
A. Then C brings in B file. What will C see in his/her file? If an 
Attachment, C will see both the A model and the B model. If Overlay, 
C will see only the B model.
••
Position Not Saved: Works in combination with Save Positions. It is 
active if the link is part of a shared coordinate environment.
••
Saved Path: Displays the location of the original file.
••
Path Type: The path type can be set to Relative or Absolute. If abso-
lute, Revit will save the exact path of the linked model, remembering 
the drive and folder(s), which means if the file is moved to a differ-
ent place, Revit will report an error. If Relative (the default option), 

330 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Revit will only save the name of the folder containing the file, ignor-
ing the other superior folders and drive. So, in case of moving your 
folder to another place, Revit will be able to locate it.
••
Local Alias: shows an additional name for files linked to Worksets.


The lower buttons are:
••
Save Positions: use this button (if there are shared coordinate systems 
used in the host model) to save a linked model to a position in the 
host project.
••
Reload From: use this button to reload the file if it was moved to 
another folder or drive.
••
Reload: if you use Unload, use Reload to bring back the file.
••
Unload: to unload the file so that it is not shown in the project but is 
still linked.
••
Remove: to delete the linked file from the host file.
VISIBILITY / GRAPHICS OVERRIDES IN LINKED MODELS


Using the Hide in View command while you have the Host project 
and the linked project will work fine, if you choose Elements and not 
­Category.


If you use the Category option, all elements in both the host and linked 
projects will be hidden.


But what if you want to change things in the host project without affect-
ing the linked model, and vice versa?
Display Settings in Linked Model


Use the Visibility / Graphics dialog box to set view options for the linked 
model.


To modify Display Settings in a Linked View, do the following steps:
••
Start the Visibility/Graphics Overrides dialog box.
••
Go to Revit Links tab. The default in Display Settings is By Host 
View. Click this button to make the desired changes:

Creating Groups and Revit Links • 331
••
The RVT Link Display Settings dialog box will come up; go to the 
Basics tab and select By linked view or Custom. Select the By 
linked view option, and then you can select from a list of related 
linked views in the linked model, as shown:
••
Select Custom, so you can specify each setting individually:
••
If you select Custom, click the Model Categories tab, and you will 
see everything dimmed, and Model Categories is set to By host view; 
change it to Custom, so you can set what is to be shown and what is to 
be hidden in the linked model:
LINKED MODEL CONVERSION


If at any time you decide to have the linked file as part of your project, 
you will lose the connection and any future update; use the Bind com-
mand and the linked project will be turned into Group.

332 • Revit 2018 Architecture


To convert a link to group, do the following steps:
••
Select the link. In context tab, locate Link panel, and click Bind 
Link button:
••
The Bind Link Options dialog box will open up. Select the items that 
you want to include and click OK.


There are two possible alert messages that may come up:
••
If there is an existing group with the same name
••
If you are bringing elements with families with the same name
How to Copy Individual Items in a Linked File to the Host File


You can copy selected elements from the linked model to the host 
­project. Do the following:
••
Hover over the desired element, press [Tab] until it is highlighted, 
and then Click it.
••
In the context tab, locate the Clipboard panel and click Copy to the 
Clipboard button.
••
Click Paste from Clipboard to insert the individual element into

3. Link myname_Kitchen.rvt into myname_Building, and place it anywhere 
initially. Using the Move command, move the kitchen using the upper left 
corner to the upper left corner of upper room, and then save and close 
the file.
4. Open the file Exercise 19-2.rvt. The site has four locations for the 
­buildings.
5. Start the Link Revit command, and select myname_Building.rvt. Place 
initially anywhere. An alert box opens; read it. Simply this is because 
myname_Kitchen.rvt was inserted as an Overlay, and not attachment.
6. Using the intersection of Grid A & Grid 1, move the building to the upper 
left corner of one of the four rectangles.
7. Copy the linked model to the other three locations.
8. Start the Visibility/Graphics command. Go to the Annotation Categories 
tab, uncheck the Grids, and click Apply. All grids in the linked model dis-
appear. Go to the Revit Links tab. Next to the main link, select Halftone.
9. Click the plus sign beside the name of the link to display the four copies. 
Randomly select one of them, click the Not Overridden button, go to the 
Basics tab, select the Override display settings for this instance, and set it 
to By linked view. Click OK twice to finish the command.
10. All of the linked models are set to gray (halftone) with the grids turned off, 
except for the linked model in which you overrode the Display ­Settings. It 
still includes the grids.
11. Save and close the file as myname_Exercise_19-2.rvt.
12. Open myname_Building.rvt. Select one of the interior walls, right-
click, and select Create Similar option and draw several walls inside the 
building.
13. Using the Manage Links command, go to Revit tab, select the myname_
Kitchen.rvt file, and set the Reference Type to Attachment.

COORDINATING ACROSS DISCIPLINES


Working in Revit with the other two disciplines (Structure and MEP) 
is inevitable. Elements from the architect model can be copied and/or 
monitored.


Structural and MEP engineers can copy column gridlines and levels. 
This will keep track of any movement or change on the copied or moni-
tored elements.
Copying and Monitoring Elements


You can use either:
••
Copy elements from a linked file: in this case, Revit will copy the ele-
ments to your project, and will keep track of any change; if anything 
happens, it will inform you to take an action.
••
Monitor elements from a linked file: for this part to work, you need to 
have your own elements (column gridlines, levels, etc.). You will ask 
Revit to link any element from your project to an equal element from 
the linked file (no copying will take place here). If the element from 
the linked project is moved or changed, you will be notified.


To copy and monitor elements, do the following steps:
••
Go to Collaborate tab, locate Coordinate panel, expand the Copy/
Monitor button and click Select Link or Use Current Project.
••
Select the desired link, and the following context tab will appear:

Creating Groups and Revit Links • 335
••
Before you copy and/or monitor elements, you can change the Copy/
Monitor options by clicking Options button. This will replace any 
element with a replacement, as shown below:
••
Using the Tools panel, click the Copy button. In the Option Bar, 
select Multiple option. Select all of the desired elements to copy and 
monitor.
••
When done, click the Finish button (not the (✓) symbol).
••
Selected elements are now copied into your model. Revit displays 
a symbol-like break line to designate that the elements are being 
monitored.
••
When you are done, click Finish (✓).


To monitor elements only, do the following steps:
••
Go to Collaborate tab, locate Coordinate panel, expand Copy/
Monitor button, and click Select Link or Use Current Project.
••
Select the desired link, and then click the Monitor button.
••
Click the desired element from your project to monitor, and then 
select the equivalent element from the linked project.
••
When you are done, click Finish.
Coordinating Monitored Elements


If you did either copy and/or monitor, and the linked file was modified, 
you will be notified to do a Coordination Review.

336 • Revit 2018 Architecture


If you open a project containing a link with copied or monitored ele-
ments which was altered, the following warning message will be dis-
played telling you that a coordination check should take place:


To do a coordination review, do the following steps:
••
Go to the Collaborate tab, locate the Coordinate panel, expand 
the Coordination Review, and click Select Link or Use Current 
Project:
••
Select the desired link. The Coordination Review dialog box comes 
up showing the modifications as shown:

will take you to the model to show you the issue to be reviewed in this 
element.
••
To solve the problem, select an Action next to each of the elements as 
shown below. You may add a comment to justify your action:
••
To create an HTML report, click the Create Report button.
••
When done, click OK.

Interference Checking


Interference Check examines if interferences took place between differ-
ent types of elements. For example, there might be a door getting in the 
way of a column.


To run an interference check, do the following steps:
••
Go to the Collaborate tab, locate the Coordinate panel, expand 
Interference Check and click the Run Interference Check button:
••
The following dialog box will come up; select the Categories from 
each project that you want to check, as shown below. You can select

IMPORTING/LINKING CAD FILES


There are lots of companies that still use AutoCAD, or use it partially, or 
have legacy drawings. Revit can make our lives easier by importing these 
files to its environment.


Revit can import several types of CAD (vector-based) files:
••
AutoCAD (DWG and DXF)
••
MicroStation (DGN)
••
SAT (the native file type of the ACIS 3D modeling)
••
SketchUp (SKP) into mass and in-place families (you should be in 3D 
view as a first step)


You can use either Link (just like we did with Revit files) or import (just 
like we did in Chapter 3)

How to Import or Link a Vector File


To import a vector file, go to the Insert tab, locate the Import panel, 
and then click the Import CAD button:


To link a vector file, go to the Insert tab, locate the Link panel, and then 
click the Link CAD button:


Fill out the Import CAD (or Link CAD) dialog box. The top part of the 
dialog box holds the standard select file options. Please check Chapter 3 
for importing options.


Only the current drawing is imported, not any reference files. You need 
to bind the reference files to the main file before it is imported.


Text only comes in if you are importing to the current view.


Use the CAD file to trace over it and snap to its points.


You can print a mixed drawing—part Revit project and part imported 
drawing.
Importing Lineweight 


One other significant setting for imported drawings is the lineweight. 
Typically, each color in AutoCAD is associated with a lineweight. There-
fore, Revit imports them by color


To import lineweights, do the following steps:
••
Before you import a CAD file, go to the Insert tab, locate the lmport 
panel, and click Import Line Weights as shown below:


One way to create your building is to create a mass, then convert the 
­different faces to walls, floors, roofs, and curtain systems.


You can accomplish this by using two commands in Revit:
••
Place Mass command, in which you will use pre-made 3D shapes 
with adjustable dimensions
••
In-Place Mass, in which you will create more complex shapes, but it 
will be only for this project

Select all of the profiles.
••
In the context tab, locate Form panel, click Create Form, then 
Solid Form. Revit will create a loft out of all profiles.
Void Forms


You will use the same methods to create a void, bearing in mind that the 
void form needs to intersect with the solid form to subtract the volume 
like the following illustration:



To create a void form, do the following steps:
••
Create the necessary sketches.
••
In the context tab, locate Form panel, click Create Form, then Void 
Form. Revit will create a void out of the sketches.
••
The void automatically subtracts volume out of the solid form it 
intersects.
MANIPULATING CONCEPTUAL MASS


While you are in In-Place editor, you can select either a vertex, edge, or 
face, and move them to create a more complex shape:


3D Control is tripod which will be displayed once the selection takes 
place (note you have to be in 3D view to see the effect of your work).


Select either a face, edge, or vertex, as shown here. You will see the 3D 
control is displayed:
••
Hover your mouse over one of the three arrows, until it highlights, 
then click and drag to make the movement you want.
••
To move a face, edge, or vertex along a plane (which is the semi rec-
tangle shape between two arrows) hover your mouse over the semi 
rectangular shape until it highlights, and then click and drag to make 
the movement.
••
Once you select a face or an edge, you can use the Rotate command 
from the Modify panel.


This chapter will provide the knowledge for you to customize existing 
types of walls, floors, roofs, and compound ceilings.


All of them are system families.


The method is the same for all, except a wall has more options to include 
in the customization process.


Walls will be used as an example for the four types.
This Chapter Contains:
●
●How to create a new wall, roof, floor, and ceiling family

CUSTOMIZING BASIC WALL TYPES


As we said previously, there are three types of walls; Basic, Curtain, and 
Stacked.


We will cover the first and third in this chapter.


In order to create a new basic wall, do the following steps:
••
Start the Wall Architectural command.
••
From Type selector, select a wall similar or close to what you want, 
and click Edit Type button. Using the dialog box, click Duplicate 
and type in a name for the new wall.
••
Under Construction, locate Structure parameter, and click Edit 
button. You will see the following dialog box:


Assembly Information: The top of the dialog box lists the Family, the 
Type, Total thickness, Resistance, and Thermal Mass. Also, you can see 
the Sample Height (this is important in case of a Stacked Wall).


Layers: specify each layer of the wall, its function, thickness, whether to 
wrap or not, and whether it is Structural Material or not:

Customizing Walls, Roofs, Floors, & Compound Ceilings • 381


Here is a list of the available functions that you can assign to wall layers: 
Structure [1]
This layer will be considered as support for other 
layers (it has the highest priority)
Substrate [2]
A material that acts as a foundation for another 
material, such as plywood or gypsum board
Thermal Air 
Layer [3]
A material which act as insulation and prevents air 
penetration
Membrane 
Layer
A membrane which will not allow water vapor 
penetration. This layer is set to a zero thickness, 
and has no priority code
Finish 1 [4]
The exterior finish layer
Finish 2 [5]
The interior finish layer (it has the lowest priority)
Priority codes will be used in wrapping. The priority 1 layer will wrap 
before the other higher priority code layers.


There are four buttons beneath the table, to Insert, Delete, move Up, 
and move Down layers.


The top of the table is labeled Exterior, and the bottom is labeled 
Interior.


You may have more than one Core Boundary layer in your wall.
Wrapping (Only for Walls)


Default Wrapping: is None At Ends (end of walls from both sides), and 
Do not wrap At Inserts (when door or window is inserted):


For At Ends the available options are: None, Exterior, or Interior:
••
Exterior means all layers above Core Boundary will be wrapped at 
the two ends:
NOTE

382 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
Interior means all layers below Core Boundary will be wrapped at the 
two ends:


For At Inserts the available options are: Do not wrap, Interior, Exterior, 
or Both:
••
Interior means all layers below Core Boundary will be wrapped at the 
insert of the door or window:
••
Exterior means all layers above Core Boundary will be wrapped at the 
insert of door or window:
••
Both means all layers below and above Core Boundary will be 
wrapped at the insert of door or window:

USING PROFILES ON WALLS, ROOFS, AND FLOORS


Revit has many commands which enable you to add profiles to walls 
(Sweeps and Reveals), roofs (Soffit, Fascia, and Gutter), and floors (Slab 
Edges).


Profile is a 2D cross section which can be applied to the definition of 
walls, roofs, and floors.


We can use premade profiles, or you can customize your own.


Go to Architecture tab, locate Build panel, as shown below, and select 
the desired type you want to add the profile to:
     
     


To set up profiles, and add it to the element, do the following steps:
••
Go to elevation or 3D view.
••
Go to Insert tab, locate Load from Library panel, and click Load 
Family button.
••
Locate the Profiles folder, choose the desired folder (Walls, Roofs, 
Slabs, etc.), select the profile, and load it.


To apply the profile, and as an example, we will discuss Sweep, but the 
procedure fits for other types as well:
••
Start Sweep command. Using Type selector, select a Wall Sweep type 
and click Edit Type button. In the Type Properties dialog box, click 
the Duplicate button and enter a new name for the type.
••
In the Type Properties dialog box, under Construction, select 
Profile (which you already load it to the project), as shown below:

384 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
Set the Material of the Sweep. When done click OK.
••
Using context tab, locate Placement panel, click either Horizontal 
or Vertical. (This is only for walls.):
••
Hover cursor over an element to add the sweep and click to place it.
••
When done press [Esc] twice.
••
You can adjust the height (for vertical) and width (for horizontal) by 
clicking them, and moving the blue circle.

INTRODUCTION TO CREATING FAMILIES


Revit comes with lots of component families from furniture, lighting, 
doors, windows, etc.


We practiced how to create System families like Walls, Floors, Roofs, 
and Compound Ceilings.


You can create your own component family by using Family Editor, and 
3D creation commands like the ones we saw in Mass Modeling.


Families can be:
••
Host-based families like light components, they need walls or a ­ceiling 
to host them
••
Stand-alone families like furniture components, they don’t need a 
host 
This Chapter Contains:

●Creating a framework of family
●
●Creating a 3D body of the family
●
●Creating types and assigning materials
CREATING FAMILIES  
IN REVIT

400 • Revit 2018 Architecture


To create a new component family, do one of the following two things:
••
Start from an empty template file (for each type there is a separate 
template file)
••
Open an existing RFA, save it under another name, and make the 
necessary changes


Either way, you will use the Family Editor as your interface. Family 
Editor is equipped with all tools to accomplish your mission.


Before you start your first step, do the following:
••
Create sketches of your family from top and side views, mentioning 
all the needed dimensions.
••
Specify which dimensions will be variable, and which will be constant.
••
Since our family is parametric, then you need to draw imaginary ref-
erence lines which will define the framework of your family.
PARAMETRIC FRAMEWORK


Revit families are parametric.


As a first phase to create a family, do the following steps:
••
Add to the existing reference planes (they come with the template 
file) the desired new reference planes
••
Put dimensions (use EQ to specify equal distance)

Creating Families in Revit  • 401
••
Create a parameter by naming the dimension with relative names
••
Create relationship between parameters
••
Flex your framework, by inputting different values for certain param-
eters, and see how the other parameters reacted to the change


Check the below shape:


To draw Reference Planes, do the following steps:
••
In the Family Editor, using Create tab, locate Datum panel, and 
then click Reference Plane button:
••
The method of creating a reference plane was already covered in the 
beginning of this book.


Reference Lines are continuous green lines, which define four work-
planes, as follows:
••
Plane parallel to the workplane of the line itself
••
Plane perpendicular to the first
••
Two planes at the two ends of the line


You can see reference planes/lines in plan and elevation views, but not 
in 3D views.


Once you start a new family, you will see two intersecting reference 
planes. This will be considered the origin of the family.


If you draw another reference plane and you want to change the origin of 
the family, simply select the desired reference planes, using Properties, 
locate Other, and then click the checkbox Define Origin on:

402 • Revit 2018 Architecture


This will impact the Room Calculation Point (by default hidden). The 
Room Calculation Point is the point that Revit uses in order to create the 
furniture schedule per room. The Room Calculation Point will always be 
following the Origin of the family.


To show the Room Calculation Point, using Properties, under Other, 
click the checkbox on as shown below:
As discussed previously, you can give reference planes names.


Reference Planes are not constraints unless you put dimensions on them.


In order to create relationships between these dimensions, you have to 
convert them to parameters first.


To label a dimension, do the following steps:
••
Select the dimension you want to label
••
Using context tab, locate Label Dimension panel, and click Create 
Parameter button to create a new label:
••
If the parameter is already created, you will find it in the list, simply 
select it as shown below:
••
If you are adding a new parameter, the Parameter Properties dialog 
box will be shown. Select the Family parameter option, as shown here:
NOTE

Creating Families in Revit  • 403
••
In the Parameter Data section, type in the Name. The Type of the 
Parameter is by default set to Length and the Group parameter under 
is set to Dimensions, because the parameter is a dimension:
••
Select Type or Instance, then click OK.
Revit will issue a warning if there are too many parameters. The reason is, 
it will be over-constraining the family. Hence the new parameter will not 
be created.


Test your framework, by inputting different values for one of the param-
eters, and see how the other parameters react. This is called falexing 
your parameters.
••
Go to Create tab, locate Properties panel, and click Family Types 
button:
••
You will see the following dialog box:
••
Use the Value field to change the numbers.
NOTE

404 • Revit 2018 Architecture


Add formulas under the Formula column. The example above is Width 
= Length/2.


Use the following in formulas:
••
Addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponen-
tiation, logarithms, and square roots.
••
Sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent.
••
Less than (<), greater than (>), equal (=). Also, use AND, OR, or 
NOT.
Parameters are case-sensitive. If you named one of your paramater 
Widths (w is capital) you have to input it like that in the formula.
EXERCISE 23-1  COFFEE TABLE FRAMEWORK
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Using the File menu, click New, then select Family option.
3. Select the template Metric Furniture.rft (Furniture.rft) and click Open 
button.
4. At the Project Browser, you are at Floor Plans, Ref. Level. You can see 
two existing reference planes are included in the file.
5. Save the family in your Exercise folder as Coffee_Table.rfa.
6. Add two new vertical reference planes, one at the right, and the other at 
the left of the existing plane. Do the same for the horizontal:
NOTE

Creating Families in Revit  • 405
7. Put dimension between the three vertical reference planes, setting EQ. 
Then add single dimension from the first to the third. Do the same for the 
horizontals.
     
8. Create from the horizontal dimension a parameter label named Length. 
Create from the vertical dimension a parameter label named Width. You 
should have something like the following:
     
9. Click Family Types button, and do as shown below:
   

406 • Revit 2018 Architecture
10. Go to Front view. Create two reference planes and then dimension, and 
label them as shown below:
11. Using Family Types flex the framework, by inputting values in the length, 
1500 (5'-0"), and 1800 (6'-0"). Get it back to 1200 (4'-0")
12. Save the family file.
CREATING THE 3D ELEMENTS OF THE FAMILY


Your next step is to create the 3D elements


There are five commands to create 3D solid elements, as shown here:


Each method uses a sketched 2D profile as the basis of the 3D shape:
••
Extrusion command creates a 3D solid by extruding a 2D profile
••
Blend command creates a 3D solid by blending two 2D profiles
••
Revolve command create a 3D solid by rotating a 2D profile around 
an axis
••
Sweep command creates a 3D solid by sweeping a 2D profile along 
a path
••
Swept Blend command creates a 3D by sweeping two 2D profiles 
along a path

Creating Families in Revit  • 407


Use Align command to align and lock the 3D solid elements to the exist-
ing reference planes.


To create a constant distance, use dimension commands, and lock them.
Adding Controls


Adding Controls is very handy in a doors and windows family, where you 
can assign them to flip the door right to left, and inside out, as shown 
here:


To add controls, do the following steps:
••
Go to the Create tab, locate the Control panel, and click the Control 
button:
••
In the context tab, locate the Control Type panel, and click one of 
the following buttons:
••
Click on the screen to place the control in the view.
••
Press [Esc] twice to end the command.

408 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Adding Openings


In case you started a family which needs a host (like doors and windows) 
opening command will allow you to draw an opening in a host element.


To add an opening to a host element, do the following steps:
••
Go to the Create tab, locate the Model panel, and click the Opening 
button:
••
In the context tab, locate the Draw panel, and using the Draw tools 
sketch the opening. When done, click (✓).
••
In the context tab, make changes as needed. Using the Options Bar, 
select whether you want the cut to display in 3D and/or in Elevation.
••
Press [Esc] twice to finish the command.
Adding Model and Symbolic Lines


To draw 2D elements to help see some more details in certain views, use 
one of the following two commands:
••
Go to the Create tab, locate the Model panel, then click the Model 
Line button:
••
Go to the Annotate tab, locate the Detail panel, and then click the 
Symbolic Line button:
••
You can see Model Lines in 2D and 3D views.

Creating Families in Revit  • 409
••
However, you can add Symbolic Lines in views parallel to the view 
you created them in (a good example would be to use Symbolic lines 
to describe the swing of a door).
You can add Text and Model Text to your family, as you did with a 
­normal project.
EXERCISE 23-2  CREATING 3D ELEMENTS OF THE FAMILY
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. Open the file Exercise 23-2.rfa.
3. Go to Ref. Level floor plan view.
4. Start Extrusion command.
5. Set the Depth = 25mm (0'-1").
6. Start the Rectangle from the Draw panel, and draw a rectangle 
1200 × 600 mm (4'-0"×2'-0"). Lock the four lines to the reference planes. 
Click (✓).
7. Go to Front elevation view. You will notice that the top of the coffee table 
is not at the right place. Using Align command to align the top edge to the 
top reference plane, and lock it. Then align the bottom edge to the lower 
plane, and lock it as well.
8. Go to 3D view, and you will see the top of the coffee table.
9. Go to Ref. Level floor plan view.
10. To place the legs of the coffee table, we need to create four reference 
planes, which they are an offset of 50mm (0'-2") to the inside of the four 
edges.
NOTE

410 • Revit 2018 Architecture
11. Put dimensions and lock them for the four new reference planes. 
You should have something like the following:
 
12. Create another four reference planes with offset of 50mm (0'-2") to the 
inside measured from the new four reference planes.
13. Put dimensions and lock them for the four new reference planes. 
You should have something like the following:
 
14. Zoom to the upper right corner of the table top.
15. Start Blend command, pick the Circle from Draw panel, and draw 
R=20mm  (0'-0 ¾") circle in the intersection. Set the Depth to 375mm 
(1'-3"). From the context tab, locate the Mode panel, and click the Edit 
Top button. The Circle is still with you; draw another R=40mm (0'-1 ½") 
circle in the other intersection. This should be the case:

Creating Families in Revit  • 411
16. Click (✓).
17. Look at your family using the 3D view. You should have one leg.
18. Go back to Ref. Level floor plan view.
19. Using the Mirror – Pick Axis command, mirror the leg twice to get 
four legs.
20. Go to the 3D view, you should see the following:
21. Save and close the file.
FAMILY TYPES – SIZES AND MATERIALS


As a final step, we will create preset sizes to be used by the user.


Then we will create a material parameter which will give us the flexibility 
to assign materials to different parts of our family.
Setting Sizes


To create family sizes, do the following steps:
••
Go to Create tab, locate Properties panel, and select Family Types 
button:

412 • Revit 2018 Architecture
••
You will see the following dialog box:
••
Click the New Type button:
••
The following dialog box will come up; type in the name of the new 
type, and click OK:
••
Input the values for that size, as shown below:
••
Click Apply to check the size without leaving the dialog box.
••
Do the same for other sizes; when done, click OK to end the command.
••
Save and load the family to your project.


Use the two buttons at the right of New button, to Rename and Delete 
the existing types.

Assigning Materials


There are two ways to assign material for all or part of your family:
••
Select the part, using Properties, locate Material parameter, and 
assign a material for this part. Using this method, the part of your 
family will always carry the selected material.
••
The other method will give you the flexibility to let the user of your 
family assign material as type or instance parameters.


The following steps will let you assign materials as parameter:
••
Select the desired part of your family.
••
Using Properties, locate Materials and Finishes, then locate Material. 
You will see <By Category>. Click the small button at the right as 
shown below:
••
You will see the following dialog box:
••
As you can see no material parameters were defined before. Click the 
Add parameter button. You will see the following dialog box:

CUSTOMIZING EXISTING DOORS AND WINDOWS


Revit comes with lots of doors and windows families.


These families help you fulfill the requirements of almost all of your 
­projects. But still we need to know how we can customize the existing 
doors, or even create a door from scratch.


You have two ways to go:
••
Open an existing door / window family, and save it under a new name. 
Make all the changes needed by adding reference planes, adding new 
2D/3D elements, and removing any unnecessary elements. This is 
the recommended way.
••
Start a new family based on one of the door RFT templates that comes 
with Revit. This method is harder, and longer than the previous one.


We will do two exercises which will use the first method, one for doors 
and the second for windows.
This Chapter Contains:

VISIBILITY SETTINGS


Visibility Settings allow the user to control when elements of your family 
will be shown, and when they will be hidden.


Certain things like handles of doors should not be displayed in floor 
plans or ceiling plans.


To control the display of elements, do the following steps:
••
Select the desired element(s). Using context tab, locate Mode panel 
and click Visibility Settings button:
••
You will see the following dialog box; specify the views and detail level 
in which you want the elements to display, as shown below:


The dialog box states that all elements will be displayed in 3D. Select 
other view(s) in which you want the elements to be shown.


Also, select which detail level you want the element to be shown in. For 
example, maybe you want to show an element in floor plans but not in 
Coarse detail.
EXERCISE 24-1  CREATING A CUSTOM DOOR
1. Start Revit 2018.
2. From the starting page, under Families, click Open.
3. Go to Doors folder and select M_Door-Single-Panel.rfa (Door-Single-
Panel.rfa), and click Open.
4. Save the file (in your exercise folder) as My_Door.rfa.
5. Get yourself acquainted with the family, by visiting Ref. Level in Floor Plans,

CREATING CUSTOM RAILINGS


A railing family is system family, hence you need to start with an existing 
family and duplicate it.


Creating a railing requires that you understand how Revit sets the 
­different components together to form a new railing. The components 
of a railing are (as shown below):
••
Post
••
Baluster Panel
••
Baluster
••
Rail


To create a new railing type, do the following steps:
••
Load or create all components of a railing type.
••
Select one of the existing railing types, using Properties, click Edit 
Type button, and then click Duplicate button.
••
Under Type 
Parameters control Rail 
Structure 
(Non-
Continuous) which control the horizontal parts of the railing, and 
Baluster Placement which controls the vertical parts of the railing.

INTRODUCTION TO WORKSETS


Since the Revit model is in a single file, and since no single person can 
finish the designing process by him or herself, we need to share the 
­project with other colleagues.


The idea is very simple:
••
There will be a single Central File that resides in the server.
••
Each user will create a copy from it in his or her own computer; we 
will call this file the Local file.
••
You will make the changes and save it back to the Central File.
••
BIM Manager can create ownership for each element in the project. 
If other people want to make changes to your owned elements, they 
have to get your permission.
This Chapter Contains:

●Create and control worksets in Revit
WORKSETS

434 • Revit 2018 Architecture
HOW TO CREATE A CENTRAL FILE


A Central file is a normal RVT file


When you start the Collaborate command, it will become a Central File.


Assume we opened a normal RVT file that contains three levels, do the 
following steps:
••
Go to Collaborate tab, locate Manage Collaboration panel, and 
select the Collaborate button:
••
You will see the following dialog box:
••
This dialog box explains the collaboration concept: “This will allow 
multiple people to work on the same Revit model simultaneously.”
••
It gives you two options to select from: Collaborate within your 
­network, or use A360 (Autodesk cloud).
••
If you select the first choice, Collaborate button will disappear, and 
the Worksets button will be enabled.
••
Click the Worksets button, and you will see the following dialog box. 
Revit tells you it created two worksets automatically, one for levels 
and grids, and the second for all other elements called Workset1:

Worksets • 435
••
Using the three buttons at the top right, you can create a New work-
set, or Delete or Rename an existing workset.
••
When you click the New button, you will get a dialog box as shown 
here:
••
Type the name of the new workset, and click OK.
How to Assign Elements to Worksets


Creating worksets on its own means nothing. You need to assign a work-
set for each group of elements. Do the following steps:
••
Go to a suitable view.
••
Select the desired elements.
••
Using Properties, set the name of the workset:
••
Repeat this process for as many elements as you wish.


As the creator of the Central file, all sets are editable by you, and owned 
by you; look at the following example:


The creator of the central file needs to release the ownerships of all 
worksets, or other users will not be able to work at their local files.


To do that go to Collaborate tab, locate Synchronize panel, and click 
Relinquish All Mine button (the file should be saved first):

436 • Revit 2018 Architecture
CREATING A LOCAL FILE


A local file is a copy of the central file opened in the user computer.


You can add to and modify the existing elements. Once you are done, 
save back to the central file to update it.


You can create a local file each time you start Revit, or you can save the 
local file to be used frequently.


To create a local file, do the following steps:
••
Start the Open command, and select the central file.
••
At the bottom of the dialog box, locate Create New Local checkbox, 
and turn it on, as shown here:
••
Click Open button.
••
A copy of the project is created in your local computer. It will hold 
the same name as the central file with your Revit Username added 
as a suffix.
••
Use the Save As command to give the file a new name.
••
Go to Collaborate tab, locate Manage Collaboration panel, and 
click Worksets button, and you will see the following:
••
There are no Owners for any workset; all you have to do is to make 
the workset Editable, and assign your name to be the workset owner:
••
If you keep your ownership to this workset, nobody can modify it 
except after taking your permission.

Worksets • 437
FUNCTIONS TO HELP CONTROL WORKSETS


There are lots of functions and tools to help you control the worksets 
process. Each one of them is unique by itself. They are:
Active Workset


This list will tell you which workset is available for editing.


You can reach it from two different places:
••
Go to the Collaborate tab, locate the Manage Collaboration 
panel, and select the desired workset. Revit will tell which is available 
for editing:
••
The second way is to use the bar at the bottom of the screen, where 
you will find the same list:
Gray Inactive Worksets


Based on the active workset, Revit can gray out the other inactive work-
sets, to show them in dimmed color.


Go to the Collaborate tab, locate the Manage Collaboration panel, 
and select the Gray Inactive Worksets button:


You will get a result similar to the following:

438 • Revit 2018 Architecture
Synchronize


Synchronizing means updating the central file with your local file 
changes.


There are two types:
••
Synchronize and Modify Settings
••
Synchronize Now


Go to the Collaborate tab, locate the Synchronize panel, and select 
one of the two options:


You can reach the same two options using Quick Access Toolbar, at the 
top left part of the screen:
Reload Latest


It loads changes from the central file to your local file.


Go to the Collaborate tab, locate the Synchronize panel, and select 
the Reload Latest button:
Worksharing Display Options


Using the Status bar, you can activate the Worksharing Display options:

Worksets • 439


You can show colors for Checkout status, owners, model updates, and 
worksets. You can turn off the worksharing display, or control the display 
settings.
••
To control the display settings, click Worksharing Display Settings, 
and you will see the following dialog box:
     
     
••
You can show these colors on your screen, using any of the methods 
mentioned previously.
