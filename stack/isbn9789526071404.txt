Preface 
Without question, scientific research helps in developing industrial processes. 
In the shipbuilding industry, there is not much researched information on the 
topic of this thesis or on the cruise ship building process control overall. That is 
why this topic is important to examine. 
Shipbuilding, especially the cruise shipbuilding, has been a continuous source 
of personal inspiration for me during my long career. I have experienced the 
whole process of cruise ship building process through a variety of tasks in a 
shipyard and that motivated me to do this research.  
This thesis would not have been possible without the support and assistance 
of several people. As I have mainly been working alone it was vital that there 
were abutments where I could go when things did not proceed as I had planned. 
First of all I want to thank Professor Pentti Kujala, my supervisor and supporter, 
who encouraged me from the very beginning. Similarly I want to express my 
gratitude to my second advisor, Professor Jani Romanoff for his constructive 
comments. They helped me see many ideas in a new way. I also want to thank 
the Aalto University Maritime Risk and Safety research group, especially Dr. 
Maria Hänninen and M.Sc. Osiris Valdez Banda, both of whom helped me 
greatly with the Bayesian method when we created the model.  
I also want to thank the experts for their contributions and my numerous 
colleagues in the shipbuilding industry with whom there have been many truly 
memorable moments. Many challenges have been solved and many fine ships 
have been constructed and delivered working together. Finally, I want to 
express my deepest gratitude to my family members, Risto, Juho and Iida, for 
tolerating and strongly supporting my enthusiasm for shipbuilding. 
Further, during the course of this thesis, several cruise ships were built where 
I had the good fortune to participate in one way or another. All of those projects 
are unique achievements, and I believe they make this industry not only 

2 
interesting, but also an inspiring venue. I hope this thesis encourages other 
students to research this field.

Original features 
In the cruise ship industry the ongoing trend seems to be that in the future 
cruise ships will be built as a co-operative effort with the shipyard and the 
surrounding network of the numerous suppliers, including authorities. It would 
be difficult to imagine that any shipyard that builds cruise ships would recruit 
all needed experts and workshops inside the shipyard. Part of that network 
comprises of business that are extremely specialized in their fields, and 
competing with them seems unrealistic. Instead, the role of the shipyard is to be 
the main contractor of the ship building effort and a coordinating manager of 
the network during the building of a cruise ship. This means that co-operation 
between all parties in the network is essential and indeed a key factor in 
achieving a successful ship delivery. Further, it seems that the competition in 
the rapidly-moving cruise ship business will also in the future be increasingly 
tight which means that the costs of the shipyard and its network need to be kept 
as low as possible and lead times as short as possible. Thus, the targeted 
productivity is not just a matter of a single shipyard, but also a matter of the 
entire network. This thesis researches the efficiency of the cruise shipbuilding 
process production as it relates to organization type using a Bayesian model in 
these circumstances. The original features of this thesis are the following: 
1.
The cruise ship building process as a whole has not been 
researched earlier like it has here. Also, the way that production 
efficiency, which as such has been studied widely, is connected to the 
phases of the cruise ship building process here is new. 
2.
The efficiency of different organization types has not been 
studied using the Bayesian model earlier and thus it makes this topic 
also new. Now, when the comparative model does exist in shipbuilding, 
it can become useful also for other fabrication industries in the future.  

6 
3.
Choice of perspective: This study has taken into account the 
combination of a shipyard and its network by modelling the process 
from the point of the product, the cruise ship, and included in the model 
factors that impact production efficiency no matter whether the activity 
is done by the shipyard or network member. A shipyard's network can 
comprise of a considerable amount of outsourced multinational 
companies to only a handful of specialized local businesses. As such, the 
network is heterogeneous, but herein it is treated on a general level as a 
singular unit for the research purposes of this thesis. 
4. The choice and clustering of the main elements: The factors that 
form the basis of the model were chosen by reviewing the cruise 
shipbuilding process phase by phase. On that basis, those factors that 
could potentially affect production efficiency were chosen for closer 
review and only the most evident of these were chosen for the model. 
These factors were clustered according to the main phases of the 
process.  
5.
The developed model: This kind of quantitative model, which 
combines the players into a single model of a very complicated system, 
is new in this connection. This model presents production efficiency 
factors that are not directly production-related such as production 
facilities, methods, and tools. By using this model, those factors can be 
identified more clearly and their impacts can be studied in a new way. 
This is a new approach of modelling the process. 
6. The results of the model: Through the choice of essential factors, 
defining the interdependencies, having a decision formula with three 
organization type options, and elicitation, the model presents the 
results. According to that information the Project Organization gives the 
best probability of achieving targeted production efficiency. Hybrid 
Organization, or in other words, a matrix organization, is the second best 
choice, and the third is Line Organization.  The possibility to use this 
model to study other topics has been recognized. Such is effectivity of, 
e.g., a WBS-based project organization or minimizing lead time or 
studying whether the model can work the other way round to indicate 
necessary preconditions for settled targets. Other fabricating industries 
can also find this model useful.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background and Research Environment 
The cruise ship industry is an industry handling large, complicated projects. The 
economic value of one cruise ship is high, and the lead time for the completion 
of a single ship, starting from the first idea or concept to that ship’s delivery, is 
typically several years. The competition between shipyards is also very tight, and 
in order to be successful in such competition, shipyards must continuously 
develop their knowledge and processes as the demands of technical complexity 
are growing, while simultaneously lead times are shortening and at the same 
time there is a demand for lower costs. Today, holiday cruises are marketed to 
all ages and social groups, which means that the requirement for onboard 
activities are numerous and new innovations for attracting more passengers are 
being researched constantly. Often, these new features also involve new 
technologies which must be applied to achieve a more attractive venue. It is a 
major exercise to develop a totally new solution in an environment that is so 
strictly regulated by classification societies and authorities, and where 
passenger safety is the most important factor. 
In today’s highly competitive market environment, shipyards must 
continuously develop their processes and be ready to adopt the newest 
technologies.  The processes that can take place from a ship owner’s creative 
idea to a ready cruise ship is available to passengers is both long and 
complicated. Figure 1 describes the cruise ship process from original concept to 
the operational ship. 
Production efficiency is an important aspect of the cruise shipbuilding process 
(Bruce & Garrard, 2013; Pires et al., 2009). One can apply informal definition 
for efficiency, namely that “efficiency is the degree of producing a set of desired 
effects” (Färe et al., 2013). In shipbuilding production, efficiency consists of 
those factors that date back to design and material decisions in addition to key 
production factors. Production efficiency is often measured by consumed 
working hours or working cost per square meter or steel weight in tons. On the 

12 
ship level, the measuring of production efficiency is often presented as 
consumed working hours or cost per light weight or gross tonnage. 
Figure 1. The cruise ship process from ship concept to full operations as a  
                    ship. 
It is typical practice in cruise ship business that after the cruise ship contract 
is solidified between ship owner and shipyard, the shipyard creates the actual 
design of the ship. Also the shipyard obtains acceptance from the ship owner, 
class, and authorities, and builds the ship for minimal costs, desired lead time, 
and agreed-upon quality. If the building process is carefully planned and 
controlled it will effectively handle the numerous changes that are common 
during this process. If the process is not well controlled, however, these changes 
can cause severe disruption in that process and a delay in construction and thus 
in delivery.  In the last few years, as expected lead times have become shorter, 
technical complexity has grown at the same time. This change has complicated 
the shipbuilding process even more.
Nowadays shipyards build cruise ships in co-operation with a supplier 
network. Depending on the shipyard, that network can participate in multiple 
varying tasks ranging from material deliveries to undertaking design work and 
production. Part of the network offers high level of know-how in their specific 
field, and another part is acting as sole resource providers. The control of this 
heterogenic network is of key importance when managing such a project. Also 
securing the knowhow of this large team is vital. Meyer (2010) studied the 
organizational features related to on-job-learning. According to him, knowledge 

13 
of economy leadership is a strong driver today and long-term partnerships 
support the managing of knowledge. 
Because this process is complicated, simulation models have been developed 
to better understand the dependencies in the process. McLean and Shao (2001) 
offered an overview of a generic simulation of shipbuilding operations. This 
shipbuilding simulation model can be an effective tool to analyze the schedule 
impact of new workloads, evaluate production scenarios, and identifying any 
resource problems. The simulation also helps identify resource constraints and 
conflicts that may occur between the competing jobs. Krause et al. (2004) also 
state that the complexity of the product, the ship, and the shipbuilding process 
make planning these tasks over the long, medium, and short term difficult and 
can produce serious uncertainties. Discrete event simulation are useful when 
testing and evaluating the different scenarios of investment planning, 
scheduling, and resource planning. By using a virtual shipyard environment, the 
cost of finding the most optimal solutions and the risks related to wrong 
decisions in the real world can be drastically reduced. They note that German 
shipyards already successfully use this simulation tool set. Further simulation 
research has also resulted in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, 
which have improved both process control and productivity (Krause et al., 
2004; Tu, 1997; McLean &Shao, 2001). Additionally, research on three-
dimensional design systems and other integrated IT tools that are used to 
manage the building process have allowed cruise ship design to become a fully 
three-dimensional model, and that model should have a significant positive 
impact on productivity as well (Liu et al., 2011; Cho et al., 1998). 
The performance level of production facilities, tools, and practices plays an 
important role in increasing efficiency. Studies on the production efficiency of 
shipbuilding have yielded better working methods, including more efficient 
welding techniques, increased welding automation, and extended use of 
modularization and block outfitting (Erikstad, 2009; Greve, 2007; Roland et al., 
2004; Koenig et al., 2002; Park et al., 2011). During ship production, one of the 
key processes is welding. Roland et al. (2004) studied joining processes as an 
important key factor related to the competitiveness of European shipbuilders. 
In addition to their contribution to shipyard productivity, joining techniques 
have had a significant impact on material properties and thus on overall product 
performance and quality. These factors have become increasingly important for 
new complex structures that use comparatively thin and high-strength 
materials. Based on these research results, more practical industrial 
applications have recently been developed.  

14 
While the aforementioned findings have had a positive impact on production 
efficiency, the question still remains whether it is possible to further increase 
production efficiency by organizing the shipbuilding project in a specific 
manner. Currently there is not enough available research information on how 
organizing the cruise shipbuilding process can affect overall production 
efficiency. 
1.2 Objectives and Research Scope 
The current lack of information about organization effect thus leads to the 
research question, RQ: 
Does organization structure have an impact on production efficiency?  
To answer the question of whether organizing the cruise shipbuilding process 
will impact production efficiency, a suitable tool is required to examine the issue 
in closer detail. Problematically, such a tool is not currently available. Any 
modeling of the cruise shipbuilding process is difficult to portray accurately due 
to the complexity of the process. This complexity is due to numerous variables, 
changes made during the process, and a schedule that can affect production 
activities even if the design is not yet fully complete. The objective, therefore, is 
to create a model of the cruise shipbuilding process from the perspective of 
production efficiency. When made available, such a model can also be used to 
develop and refine the construction process from other points of view, such as 
lead time, in addition to its successful application for studying the impacts of 
the organization process to overall production efficiency.  
In this thesis, controlling and managing the shipbuilding process 
encompasses the combined individual elements of project management, 
building practices, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and planning and 
implementing the entire process. The model is built using the Bayesian Network 
(BN) techniques (Darwiche, 2009), and the influence of the organization is 
captured by using decision variable that enable the different organization types 
present in the model.  
To summarize, the objective of the work is to create a model of the cruise 
shipbuilding process related to production efficiency, and to investigate 
whether the organization structure of that process has an impact on overall 
production efficiency. The ultimate goal is to provide a tool with which it is 
possible to obtain information on how to best control and manage the entire 
shipbuilding process, resulting in maximized production efficiency.  

15 
1.3 The Research Process and the Dissertation Structure 
When selecting the method for modelling the cruise shipbuilding process, 
various options were considered. Given that there are a large number of 
variables and the interactions and dependencies between different variables are 
not fully known, this modelled process obviously involves uncertainty, which 
herein led to selection of Bayesian Network techniques as the modelling 
approach. BN has been used in the marine industry before, e.g., marine safety 
related studies widely, but particularly for studying production efficiency 
relating specifically to organization types that still remain absent. 
The model was created after a review of the cruise ship building process. Based 
on the wide experience of being responsible for various positions that range 
from project planning, purchasing, production, development and quality to 
leadership of the entire ship project, precise observations were undertaken by 
the researcher. Typical causes of inefficiency in the process were also mapped. 
Based on this analysis, the factors that related to production efficiency were 
identified. The selection of variables was done using the Pareto principle where 
the assumption is that 20% of actions contribute to 80 % of costs (Koch, 2011). 
Then, due to the rather large number of candidates, only the most evidently 
pivotal ones were considered for the model.  
Due to the large number of variables still remaining in the model structure, an 
initial clustering of those variables was then executed. For every variable, two 
alternative states were determined. Then, the dependencies between these 
variables were determined. In order to utilize the model for studying the effects 
of organizing the process, the decision variable was added to the model namely, 
organization type, which reflected the organizing method for the shipbuilding 
process. Then, the variables that this decision formula impacted were clarified.  
The next phase was to fill in the conditional probability tables, i.e., the model 
parameters, which were based on expert judgment. The qualification 
requirements for an expert was the wide knowledge and experience of the 
shipyard cruise shipbuilding process and understanding the procedure for the 
elicitation of probabilities. Three experts were qualified and provided their 
views on the parameters. A searched model output is the probability with which 
the set target for desired production efficiency is earned within this scope. Using 
the model, it was possible to investigate the differences between the 
probabilities of the organizational structures and production efficiency. 

16 
This thesis introduces a quantitative model for the cruise ship building 
process. The model allows for the examination of how the production efficiency 
of the cruise shipbuilding process is linked to the ways that the process is 
organized and managed. In Section 2, a brief description of the cruise 
shipbuilding process is presented together with the theoretical background of 
any related items. Also the methods are described. In Section 3 the creation of 
the model as well as the actual model with its structure and the results of the 
analysis are presented. In Section 4 the results are discussed and both model 
reliability and validity are analyzed. Finally conclusions are offered and 
recommendations for future research are discussed. 
1.4 Main Limitations 
This study is based on the assumption that all production-related factors, such 
as production facilities, methods, and tools, do remain constant throughout the 
cruise shipbuilding process. Therefore, their impacts have been excluded in this 
study in order to clarify only the influence of the organization model. However, 
numerous uncertain dependencies, variables, and connections do still remain. 
The number of experts could be more, but herein the demanded qualifications 
for experts were special including long working period in the same shipyard in 
the different parts of the process for knowing the process well. In shipbuilding, 
this parameter changes slowly because the lead time for the projects is long and 
the any timing of changes in the process must be considered carefully. The 
typical timeframe for getting changes in the process implemented can range 
from three to five years based on past experience. The study was done in one 
shipyard only because the information needed for this kind of study is very 
broad and not generally available.  

17 
2. Background 
2.1 Description of the cruise shipbuilding process 
The cruise shipbuilding process is complicated (Eyres & Bruce, 2012). The 
process contains numerous tasks that link to each other technically as well as in 
terms of scheduling and cost. In several studies a general description of the 
shipbuilding process is offered in regards to both shipbuilding practices and 
ship structures (Eyres & Bruce, 2012; Hiekata & Grau 2015).  According to them, 
the process consists of a concept and preliminary design, detailed design, 
production design, and actual production. In terms of the design, they indicate 
that design activities are carried out with a high level of concurrency that is 
supported by different computer software systems. That process is highly 
dependent on the experiences and insights of the skilled experts. Further, 
detailed design information is difficult to share, and design conflicts are 
resolved via a common effort by the design engineers during the downstream 
design stages. The number of detail design drawings is typically thousands, 
which offer further perspective on the nature of such huge design work. Meyer 
(2010) suggests that effective creating, sharing and use of knowledge is a 
principle factor of corporate competitiveness in today’s global economy. 
Further, he argues that business success critically depends on how well 
companies with highly trained employees and high labor costs protect, combine 
and utilize the knowledge of their employees, their organization, and partner 
organizations.  
The design and material definition proceeds through several stages toward an 
entity, a ship that is a luxury, self-containing hotel with an optimized steel hull, 
equipped with energy production and propulsion. The design is guided by the 
rules and regulations of a classification society and authorities. Sometimes the 
projects also reflect the development of rules because the concepts and 
innovations can prevail for structures that have not been considered in the 
existing rules and requirements. This circumstance can produce long term 
development processes with classification societies. That process needs to be 
managed so that the project stays under control during its development, and 

18 
design can proceed despite any possible changes needed when new rules have 
been confirmed and must be applied by the shipyard. Safety and environmental 
issues are a necessity. As an example of this Figure 2 show the typical leisure 
features of cruise ships that have been developed over the years. They have 
demanded a great deal of development work and testing before they could be 
offered for everyday use on board cruise ships.  
Figure 2. A rising bar, ice rink and flow rider on board cruise ships. 
Indeed, today the execution of a cruise ship project is a collaboration of a huge 
network of design offices, authorities, classification societies, material 
suppliers, and turnkey (TK) contractors together with the shipyard. This 
scenario means that shipyard needs to have the ability to control its network in 
order to be successful. A portion of the suppliers and turnkey contractors 
participate to the tendering phase, i.e., when the shipyard is offering the ship to 
the owner. The long co-operation has resulted in many highly specialized 
companies which are absolute tops in their field. The overall scheme of the 
cruise ship process can be seen in Figure 3. 
Figure 3. The overall scheme of the cruise shipbuilding process. 

19 
A modern production process combines hull production activities and outfitting 
activities, with simultaneous execution performed on both fronts. This prevails 
with developed computer aided design (CAD) systems. Fernández and Lado 
(2015) describe how naval shipyards have increased their demands for an 
integration of CAD applications with product lifecycle management (PLM) 
systems and present advanced architecture for CAD-PLM integration in a naval 
shipbuilding environment. 
As stated earlier, ship contracts have traditionally been compiled in such a way 
that when entering into one, the shipyard is committed to deliver the technically 
specified vessel within the required time frame given only the operational and 
architectural demands, but with no detailed technical plans or drawings. As a 
result, the ship must be defined in detail while the construction process is 
already ongoing. This situation puts considerable pressure on the planning 
effort. 
Planning is the basis for successful execution of any cruise ship project. 
Without proper schedules and a resource plan, it will not be possible to achieve 
the intended results on time. The basis for the schedule is WBS (Work 
Breakdown Structure) and the building practice. Shipyards in the cruise ship 
industry have their own processes and ways to control that process. Some 
shipyards use a combination deck-fire zone as the basic element of WBS 
whereas other shipyards use the functional area – system WBS. Typically, one 
cruise ship project will consist of tens of thousands of individual activities which 
all have a workload and connections to other activities in between the different 
disciplines. It is evident that without the help of computer this task would not 
be possible. As stated earlier, the ship contract includes the deadline for the 
whole project. To achieve the planned financial result, it is extremely important 
to meet the targeted delivery date. That is why schedule is important and 
through that focus the planning itself.      
Every shipyard has their own IT environment and procedures. The planning 
system is typically the core system with which all other systems need to co-
operate. That is why numerous links need to be created between the design 
systems, the material and logistic systems, as well as the document handling 
system. This process leads to a situation where the planning systems as entity 
are tailored and different in the shipyards. It can also be the reason that a lot of 
development work is done by the planning system suppliers who need to do this 
tailoring work inside the shipyards to get the contract to the system. However, 

20 
some shipyards have developed totally individual planning systems for their 
own use only. 
Nowadays the supplier network is an essential part of the cruise ship project 
and thus their role in the scheduling process is essential. There are cases where 
suppliers participate in the planning by creating their own schedules and then 
combine them with the main schedule and also cases contractors just follow the 
schedule already set by the shipyard. The schedule is also the basis for progress 
reporting. The broader the reference data is, the easier it is to create follow-up 
and controlling reports.     
According to Liu et al. (2011) shipbuilding is a complex production system that 
is characterized by a complicated work and organization structure, prolonged 
production lead time, and heterogeneous resource requirements. This entity 
means that planning all needed activities from the design phase until the last 
activity of commissioning is a challenging task. They studied an aggregate 
production planning model for ship production in efforts to minimize the 
variation of aggregate man-hours and simultaneously minimize the logistics 
demands of any interim products. They developed a directed genetic algorithm-
based solver for this optimization problem. Emblemsvåg (2014) developed a 
new approach for project planning called Lean Project Planning that was 
intended to overcome any shortcomings in the earned value management 
approach and found it to be successful. 
Restricted parts and elements of the planning process can be studied in 
general terms but the whole planning system of a shipyard is so big an economic 
and operational effort that it needs an investment decision by shipyard to start 
developing it. 
A vast amount of careful planning, technical detailing, and co-ordination of 
resources, materials, and work is required to manage a process that can produce 
the agreed-upon high-level cruise vessel, with all its technical performance 
indicators within a predetermined time, and the agreed-upon quality in a 
profitable way (Bruce & Garrard, 2013). Several different tasks and activities are 
interdependent and will affect each other, and thus complicating the process 
even further. The creation of a schedule is based on the shipyard and its Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs). Improvement in these results shorter unit times 
and naturally helps to shorten the overall lead time. The demands of shortening 
these lead times have resulted in a situation where the next phase can start 
before the preceding phase has completed; thus parallel work is required. An 
illustration of a typical project main schedule is presented in Figure 4.  

21 
Figure 4. A typical full schedule for construction of a cruise ship with its main  
                    phases noted. 
It shows how the different work is being done in parallel terms to still keep the 
overall lead time short. The shortening of lead time prevails the efficient parallel 
work and strict control of all preconditions. In Figure 5 a typical outfitted block 
is being lifted to the hull during the hull assembly period. It shows one example 
of parallel work progressing as, during the hull block building, remarkably 
outfitting is also being done. However, as a result of a tight plan, many 
individual issues can become critical during the process, and quick reactions are 
then needed to maintain the planned schedule. 
Figure 5. An outfitted block is being lifted to the hull during the hull assembly  
                   period. 
The first steps in the cruise ship building process are taken before the ship 
contract even exists. That phase is typically called project design. 
After receiving an enquiry from a client, the specification is reviewed  and the 
shipyard's own specification is written, taking into account the owner's 
definitions and demands in addition to the shipyards own solutions, standards 

22 
and procedures. Based on this review, system descriptions are outlined, 
and system diagrams are defined. Hull design in this phase includes 
calculations and modelling, and the result is a preliminary hull shape with a 
mid-ship section. Figure 6 shows an example of a geometry modelling tool. In 
addition, the specified rules and regulations play a big role for the structures. In 
this phase, the planning work is starting to define the main building practice 
and the schedule. Necessary planning activities are done including all the main 
schedule options. Also the network is being contacted now. Especially, all big 
and critical materials and components are quoted. General arrangement (GA) 
design is started to make the layouts as attractive as possible. Based on the GA 
and the main WBS, the turnkey systems and areas are then quoted. 
Simultaneously cost calculations are ongoing. First, calculations are based on 
the statistics but also when the offers from contractors are received, they can be 
used to determine a cost basis. When specification, GA, mid-ship section with 
necessary structures, the building practice, and the main schedule have been 
agreed upon, the cost and the overall budget can be compiled with the help of 
statistics and received offers for components, materials and TKs. Based on this 
compilation, the offer for building the cruise vessel can be completed, and the 
commercial negotiations start. 
Figure 6. A geometry modelling tool (www.napa.fi ). 
The Basic design phase starts normally after the contract has been signed. 
The most important activities during basic design are classification design, basic 
design of all machinery, propulsion, electricity, HVAC, deck and interior. The 
overall scheduling has to be done at a more detailed level as well as detailed 
capacity planning for the design. Normally, the purchasing of expensive and 

23 
critical components is done in this phase, as well as any turnkey contracts. In 
order to be able to do this task, planning work has to have proceeded already, 
so that procedures and schedules for purchasing all material categories exist 
and detailed building practices with their schedules have been determined. 
System design proceeds together with the suppliers, and architectural design 
proceeds together with the owner. Basic design is documented in the form of 
hull drawings, technical calculations, system descriptions, layout drawings, and 
architectural drawings. All necessary documentation needs to be approved by 
the owner and the classification society. 
 All the standards for further use in later phases are also agreed upon in the 
basic design. Inspection plans and testing procedures are agreed during this 
phase for later purposes. In general, all common procedures needed for the 
course of the building and the co-operation with the owner, classification society 
and authorities should be agreed upon during the basic design phase. The 
overall capacity planning for later phases is also included in the basic design to 
ensure all needed resources are available later on. Purchasing of resources also 
needs to be planned in detail for these schedules. 
Detail design consists of both hull detail design and outfitting detail design. 
Hull detail design can be part of the hull process. Based on the basic design 
decisions, calculations, module plans, architect design area arrangements and 
all approved area-based documentation, respective workshop drawings, 
defining of materials in parts lists, and prefabrications are done during this 
phase. System design is also taken to a detailed level, so that working drawings 
for piping, ducting, and electrical work are done and ready for production. 
Installation drawings for all equipment, machinery, and technical spaces are 
detailed as well. In order to secure planned block outfitting for each respective 
phase of hull work, the working drawings need to be done early enough to secure 
the necessary materials and prefabricates. In case different openings are 
planned in connection with the steel process, the outfitting design is done 
simultaneously with the hull detail design. In the detailed design, all 
documentation needed for purchasing these materials is finalized. This means 
that all workshop drawings, component lists, technical specifications for 
enquiries, and orders are done. During the detail design phase, all material 
enquiries and purchasing contracts are completed, and all prefabricated items 
are put into production. For certain materials, only frame agreements are done 
first and call-offs based on need during production are made afterwards. Other 
working-related documentation is also produced in this phase. In order to 
organize the work in production, job orders are produced based on the working 

24 
drawings and the parts lists. This work is based on WBS and thus is defined into 
controllable entities that help the right work order in the blocks, grand blocks 
and in the area phase onboard. 
The hull production phase includes the detail design, material-related 
activities, part fabrication, part assembly, block assembly, grand block 
assembly, and hull assembly. Block outfitting in different phases is part of the 
hull process, which is why planning combines outfitting design and hull design. 
It is essential to keep the process effective. Logistics also play an important role 
in the hull phase due to the tight lifting schedule of grand blocks.  
Outfitting has various phases. Depending on the building practice, there can 
be different phases in action in different parts of the ship. The first outfitting 
effort is done in workshops when the pre- fabricates and modules are fabricated. 
If there is block outfitting, that can be started already during the steel process 
when openings are done and also when the first welded parts are installed. 
During the steel process, there can be several block outfitting phases, depending 
on the type of area in the block. The cabin area has different block outfitting 
than the machinery areas, galleys, outer decks or public spaces.  
After the grand blocks are installed, the area outfitting phase begins. In the 
hotel interior and technical areas, the background work is finalized, and the 
interior work, including system work, is done. In the machinery areas, the 
outfitting is mainly for system work. Figure 7 shows phases of the hull and 
outfitting process. 
Figure 7. The phases of hull and outfitting production. 
In the commissioning phase, all the systems are tested and checked, so that 
their functionality corresponds with what was defined in the specification.  

25 
The ship project can be organized in several ways, either by using line 
organization or project organization. Traditionally, shipyards have been 
organized as basic line organizations. In a basic line organization, the main 
departments, meaning other than the administrative departments, are those for 
design, procurement, hull, and outfitting. For projects, separate project 
organizations can be established. Line organization is a stable, but in contrast, 
the content and role of the project organization has changed over the years. 
Project group responsibilities can vary from a purely client interface to real 
project management in terms of cost, schedule, content, and quality. In project 
organization, the main department of every line organization nominates its 
representative to join the project group. That representative uses the power of 
their respective departments in the course of the project.  
The cruise shipbuilding process includes uncertainties due to 
fluctuations and incomplete information, all of which must be addressed to 
maintain the total lead time for the process. One has to know which information 
is permanently fixed and which is subject to change. Every cruise vessel project 
is different. Even if it is a sister vessel and technically identical, the 
circumstances during the project process can still be different. Whereas many 
of the technical uncertainties have been clarified already for the sister vessel, 
factors such as the resource situation, the supplier network, the shipyard 
organization, key personnel, and the processes can still change. Thus, from a 
project perspective, these types of changes make the new situation quite 
different from the previous one.  
2.2 Production efficiency 
Production efficiency and productivity are defined as the relationship between 
the output generated by a production or service system and the input provided 
to meet responsibilities and create this output (Prokopenko, 1987). According 
to this author, productivity is defined as the efficient use of resources, such as 
labor, capital, land, materials, energy and information, for the production of 
various goods and services. He also states that productivity is the point wherein 
human skills and interests, technology, management, and the social and 
business environments all converge. Further, that productivity should be 
managed, not just measured. The techniques used to improve productivity are 
in his opinion industrial engineering techniques, economic analysis and 
behavioral techniques. Also improving the use of capital resources can be 
improved by undertaking waste reduction, energy conservation, and 
maintenance improvement. Further, improving productivity through quality is 

26 
also one method this author suggests to be used for improving production 
efficiency. 
The producers are efficient if they have produced as much as possible with the 
inputs they have used and if they have produced that output at minimum cost 
(Greene, 1997; Porcelli, 2009). Efficiency is one part of the overall performance 
as seen in Figure 8 (Porcelli, 2009). 
Figure 8. A framework for performance assessment  
In Figure 8 allocative efficiency refers to the ability to combine inputs and 
outputs in optimal proportions in the light of prevailing prices, and is measured 
in terms of behavioral  goal of the production unit like observed cost vs optimum 
cost. Technical efficiency is measured as the ratio between the observed output 
and the maximum output, under the assumption of fixed input, or, alternatively, 
as the ratio between the observed input and the minimum input under the 
assumption of fixed output (Porcelli, 2009). Both technical and allocative 
efficiency can be measured by the input approach or the output approach. 
According to Porcelli, the input approach means evaluating the ability to 
minimize inputs keeping outputs fixed and the output approach means 
evaluating ability to maximize outputs keeping inputs fixed. 
Semenick (1994) has reviewed benchmarking methods such as non-
parametric, deterministic Data Envelopment analysis (DEA), Free Disposable 
hull (FDH) and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA). DEA has its roots in 
mathematical programming. It creates an envelope of observed production 
points. It provides linear approximations to model the best-practice reference 
technology and measures of technical efficiency levels are developed for firms 
that operate inside this data envelope. FDH is a variant of DEA. When DEA 
creates a piecewise linear best-practice frontier, FDH creates a best-practice 
frontier resembling a staircase (Semenick, 1994). SFA is based on statistical 
regression techniques. It is a parametric approach and is more linked to 

27 
econometric theory (Bogetoft and Otto, 2011). SFA compares a firm with an 
average technology by using data from all time periods and for all firms 
(Semenick, 1994). 
Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is a technique to help the decision 
makers to choose, prioritize or sort alternatives in situations when there are 
conflicts between criteria and between different interpretations of the criteria 
and preferences among the different actors.  It structures and solves decision 
and planning problems including multiple criteria. MCDA problems can be 
classified into multiple-criteria evaluation problems and multiple-criteria 
design problems. “The applications of MCDA problems are numerous and in 
different fields. Most real-world decision problems occur in a complex 
environment where conflicting systems of logic, uncertain, and imprecise 
knowledge, and possibly vague preferences have to be considered. To face such 
complexity, preference modeling requires the use of specific tools, techniques, 
and concepts which allow the available information to be represented with the 
appropriate granularity. “ (Greco et al., 2005). 
The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a theory of measurement through 
pairwise comparisons and relies on the judgements of experts to drive priority 
scales (Saaty, 1998; 2008). Preference Ranking Organization Method for 
Enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) method helps decision makers find the 
best alternative for the problem. It provides framework for structuring a 
decision problem, identifying the conflicts and highlight the main alternatives 
and the structured reasoning behind. Da÷deviren (2008) uses these both 
methodologies in making equipment selection. The AHP is used for analyzing 
the structure of the equipment selection problem and PROMETHEE is used for 
obtaining final ranking and sensitivity analysis. Combining Fuzzy set theory 
with AHP creates Fuzzy AHP method. It resembles human reasoning in its use 
of approximate information and uncertainty in creating decisions (Da÷deviren 
and Yüksel, 2008). 
The concept of virtual manufacturing has been developed for sheet metal 
forming process in order to increase the industrial performances. According to 
Banabic (2010) it is the one of the most efficient way of reducing the 
manufacturing times and improving the quality of the products. 
In lean philosophy, there is resource effectivity and also flow efficiency, which 
refers to the amount of products produced in given unit of time. Liker & Lamb 
(2002) examined lean ship construction. According to them, the Toyota 
Production System was the basis for "lean manufacturing." The purpose of lean 
manufacturing is to improve product cycle time, cost competitiveness, and 

28 
quality by eliminating waste in the manufacturing process through continuous 
improvement generated by a motivated workforce. According to the authors, the 
key points are specifying the product value from the customer’s perspective, 
identifying the value stream, constant flow, pull and perfection or acceptable 
quality. In addition to Just in Time and Built in Quality, other principles used 
in lean manufacturing are 5S (sort, sustain, straighten, standardize, and shine), 
7 wastes (overproduction, transport, waiting, movement, over processing of 
inventory, and defects) and Kaizen, which is continuous improvement. 
According to Koliü et al. (2016), the idea of lean manufacturing in shipbuilding 
is being applied in shipyards worldwide. Erdem (2015) studied the lean 
manufacturing effects of modularization on the outfitting process in 
shipbuilding. He analyzed several Lean Manufacturing effects on reducing the 
items on the bill of materials for outfitting using data. The goal was to increase 
the pre-outfitting percentage by identifying waste and thereby facilitating 
modularization in shipbuilding. He concluded that the reduction of movement 
leads to less confrontation and interruption of employees’ working in the 
shipyard and increases the overall pre-outfitting percentage when compared to 
all the outfitting activities.  
In a cruise shipbuilding project, thinking for process and the efficiency in 
design can be seen as the use of standards and repetitive solutions as well as the 
ability to keep to the design schedule and budget.  Avoiding wait time or lack of 
clarity in the initial information, and securing approvals and resources are 
essential for such effectivity. In procurement, that effectivity can be seen as on-
time material or service deliveries in a specified condition. Clear, well-defined 
purchasing scopes, acceptable suppliers, and keeping to a purchasing schedule 
and budget are also important. In addition to keeping to the schedule and 
budget, in hull production the design documentation, materials, information 
regarding outfitting design on time, the availability of needed resources and 
working logistics are the keys to productivity. In outfitting the co-operation of 
the supplier network, shipyard, classification society, and authorities creates the 
basis for efficient work. Avoiding wait times by having detailed planning and 
regular control of the prerequisites for continuous outfitting work and 
commissioning can be achieved. In outfitting a pre-outfitting grade, modularity 
grade and block outfitting grade indicate the level of efficiency. Change 
management can give good indicators of project efficiency or inefficiency and 
the reasons behind any of the changes in the process throughout the whole time 
span of the project. 

29 
The challenge in improving production efficiency during the cruise ship 
building process is that majority of the ships are customized to a detail. The 
shipyard needs to create something new for the next projects. Even in serial 
ships, the interior is often changed to give a new look for passengers. This means 
that restoration and standardization need to be done in a clever way so that it 
still offers the possibility of looking new and unique.  
2.3 Organization structures 
Lægaard and Bindslev (2006) describe the theories which contain contributions 
to organizational theory over the past 100 years. They say that the greatest 
contributions to organizational theory were made in connection with the build-
up of the industrial society, which created a need for theories about the 
management of many people gathered around industrial tasks.  The 
development resulted in organizational theories with normative rules for 
structuring of work. Further, they clarify the theories that are scientific 
management, administrative theory, bureaucracy and organizational structure 
and administrative behavior.  
Scientific management is no longer prevalent as a managerial ideology. 
However, it still functions as a guideline for technical procedures, not only in 
the industrial sector, but also in the service sector.  
Administrative Theory has the form of the management’s hierarchical 
pyramid structure were to function as the basis of the part of the organization 
that involved activities, i.e. a top down approach. Bureaucracy and 
Organizational Structure includes that the public employee must act as if the 
superior’s interests were his own and thus stay in his bureaucratically assigned 
role. On the basis of the thoughts about organizational structure as a link 
between the company’s strategy and implementation of action plans, the 
following models for organizational structures can be identified: Simple 
structure, Hierarchical system, Functional organization, Product 
organization and Matrix organization. There are no perfect organizational 
forms and no completely correct solutions when it comes to structuring 
organization. Administrative Behavior has attempted to clarify goal specificity 
and formalization and explain their connection to rational behavior. There the 
objectives only affect the individual member if they are significant in his daily 
conduct. In this way, it becomes the organization’s role to delimit the objectives 
that are significant to the individual member. 

30 
Lundin and Söderholm (1995) have researched the theory for temporary 
organization. According to them four basic concepts — time, task, team and 
transition — provide a suitable foundation for a theory of the temporary 
organization as well as a framework for identifying these demarcations. Further, 
they suggest that the four sequencing concepts are of central importance: 
action-based entrepreneurialism, fragmentation for commitment-building, 
planned isolation and institutionalized termination. The basic concepts — time, 
task, team and transition — are thus the foundation for our understanding of 
temporary organizations. Time in temporary organizations can be envisaged as a 
linear section of a continuous time-flow that is predictable and plannable. The 
presence of a task, something that calls for attention, is the main reason for 
creating a temporary organization. Team focuses on interpersonal relations, on 
how teams can be made to function through commitment-building, and how they 
interrelate 
with 
the 
surrounding 
environment 
through 
processes 
of 
legitimization. Transition is a basic aim of temporary organizations; something 
has to be achieved in terms of transition before success can be proclaimed.  
Brady et al. (2006) describe mega project management in projects at 
Heathrow airport. These range from routine capital projects to a one-off mega 
project — Terminal 5 (T5). They concentrate on the learning gained from 
previous projects, individuals and organizations that contributed to the 
innovative approach used to manage the T5 project. The T5 project uses 
'integrated team working' to ensure that safety, time, budget and quality 
constraints are met. It has already reached 50% completion (March 2005) on 
time, within budget and with a high safety record. The T5 project is Europe's 
largest and most complex project. Central to the delivery of T5 has been the 
concept of integrated teams. They proceeded with an approach based on strong 
leadership, simplicity and openness. The approach was liked by members of the 
project team. However, it was not liked their parent organizations because the 
team members became identified more strongly with the project than their own 
organizations. The various teams were co-located and fully integrated. They 
were run as if they were a small business with them all taking joint responsibility 
for the outcome. Teamwork was mentioned as a major success factor. There it 
was claimed that teamwork has been excellent both at the Heathrow Airport 
Limited level and also through to construction activities where the co-location 
of the team provided huge benefits. It was also noted that the team members 
'left their companies at the door' when they came to work on the project. 
The cruise ship building process is a large project that can be organized in 
several ways. Depending on the organizational structure and working 

31 
procedures of a shipyard, the project can be executed using the permanent line 
organization of the shipyard, setting up a temporary project organization or 
both techniques. The organizational structure shows where the people in the 
organization belong to and to whom they should report. The most common 
organization structures are Functional, Project, and Matrix. 
The typical functional shipyard organization, the line organization in this 
study, is often divided into the following functions: sales, marketing, design, 
purchasing, hull, outfitting, administrative, planning, human resources, quality, 
service, maintenance, and economics. Department managers report to the 
shipyard director, see Figure 9 for details.  
Figure 9. An example of a line organization. 
Project organization is a temporary organization that is set up to fulfill a 
special task (Atkinson, 1999; Hobday, 2000; White & Fortune, 2002). This task 
can be building a cruise ship according to the agreed upon contract. In the cruise 
ship project group there are typically the following responsible persons: 
planner, controller, design responsible, procurement responsible, hull 
responsible, outfitting responsible, commission responsible, and often a 

32 
document controller. All of them report to the project manager, see Figure 10 
for an illustration of a project organization for cruise ship project. 
Figure 10. An example of a project organization. 
The matrix organization, a hybrid in this study, includes part from both the 
functional organization and the project organization. There can be several types 
of cases, depending on how strong or weak the project manager is. If a project 
manager has only limited authority, then the functional managers maintain 
control over their own resources and project activities. If that authority is shared 
equally between the project manager and the functional managers, then the 
matrix is in balance. If the project manager has main responsibility for the 
project and the function managers support the technical expertise and provide 
resources when the project asks for them, then the project is a strong one, see 
Figure 11 for details. 

33 
Figure 11. An example of a hybrid organization. 
According to Robbins (1983), an organization represents the planned co-
ordination of the collective activities of two or more people who, while 
functioning on a relatively continuous basis through the division of labor and a 
hierarchy of authority, also seek to achieve a common goal or a set of goals.
Robbins also notes that organizational structure has three components: 
Complexity, Formalization and Centralization. Complexity considers the extent 
of any differentiation within the organization, e.g., the levels of an organization’s 
hierarchy. Formalization describes the degree of rules and procedures on which 
the organization relies, while Centralization considers and establishes the actual 
decision-making authority. Based on these factors, one can evaluate different 
kinds of organizations very precisely. 
When evaluating the complexity of an organization, Robbins (1983) notes 
three elements: Horizontal Differentiation, Vertical differentiation, and spatial 
dispersion. The more complex an organization is, the greater is the need for 
effective communication, co-ordination, and control devices. As complexity 

34 
increases, so do the demands on management to ensure that differentiated and 
dispersed activities are working smoothly and together in order to achieve the 
organization’s declared goal.  
The measuring of organizational effectiveness, according to Robbins, has 
proven to be a difficult aspect to define. Evaluating productivity usually means 
defining the quantity or volume of the major product or service that the 
organization is providing. Efficiency can be seen as a ratio that reflects a 
comparison of some aspect of unit performance to the costs incurred for that 
performance. 
Robbins also describes an organization using the term “adhocracy” which 
means a flexible, adaptable and informal organization. He states that “when it 
is important that the organization be adaptable and creative, when individual 
specialists from diverse disciplines are required to collaborate to achieve a 
common goal, and when tasks are technical, etc.” and “too complex for any one 
person to handle or for individual supervision, the adhocracy represents a viable 
alternative”. As an example he mentions the most popular application of 
adhocracy, a matrix organization, which is a combination of departments by 
function or by product or by project. The matrix breaks down the unit command 
concept. Employees in the matrix have two bosses - their department manager 
and their project manager. This matrix is designed to benefit from the strengths 
of both the functional and the product/project structures. The strength of a 
functional structure rests in bringing specialists together. Project structure 
facilitates the co-ordination between these specialists so as to achieve timely 
completion of the project and meet budget targets. Further, this structure 
defines those with the clear responsibility for all activities related to that project. 
Aurélio de Oliveira et al.  (2012) analyzed the influence of leadership style and 
the factors associated with organization agility on project performance. They 
studied which combination of leadership style, agility, and organizational 
factors can achieve the highest project performance. Their effort “helps clear up 
the mistaken view that high agility only takes place when all constituent factors 
display maximum values. The leadership style and people contribution to agility 
is clearly addressed”.  
Ford and Randolph (1992) reviewed and summarized the literature on cross 
functional organization forms and focused on the commonalities of the 
literatures that deal with matrix organization and project management, ending 
with a discussion on needed research. Their article ends with a call for more 
research and theory building on cross-functional organizations, which they 
argue is continuing to grow in application importance.  

35 
According to Greve (2007) a central theoretical problem in organizational 
evolution is how organizations acquire new capabilities. The organizational 
exploitation of current capabilities often reduces the exploration of new 
capabilities, resulting in a short-term bias regarding of organizational 
adaptation. When talking about large projects, the capabilities of the 
organization must be ready to change when needed because during long lead 
times, circumstances can and do change. 
Hobday (2000) examined the effectiveness of producing so-called CoPS, i.e., 
complex high value products, systems, networks, capital goods, and constructs 
in a Project-Based Organization (PBO), compared to that same process within a 
more traditional functional matrix organization. According to Hobday the PBO 
become an intrinsically innovative form, as it creates and recreates new 
organizational structures to meet the demands of each CoPS project and each 
major customer. The PBO is able to cope with emerging properties during 
production and respond flexibly to changing client needs. It is also effective at 
integrating different types of knowledge and skills and coping with each 
project’s risks and the uncertainties that are common in CoPS projects. 
However, the PBO is inherently weak whereas the matrix organization is strong 
whenever performing routine tasks, achieving economies of scale, coordinating 
cross-project resources, facilitating company-wide technical development, and 
promoting organization-wide learning. 
There is a lot of knowledge available on organizations as seen from the 
discussion above. However, the impact of different types of organizations on 
productivity in shipyards has not yet been researched to its fullest extent. 
2.4 Critical evaluation of the available models to study 
organizational and production efficiency
Previous models that have been developed on the shipbuilding process are 
mainly simulation models. In general, these models help to understand the 
dependencies that exist in the shipbuilding process.  
McLean and Shao (2001) offer an overview of the generic simulation of 
shipbuilding operations. This shipbuilding simulation model can thus be an 
effective tool to use when analyzing the schedule impact of new workloads, 
evaluate production scenarios, and identify any resource problems. The 
simulation also helps to identify resource constraints and any conflicts that may 
occur between competing jobs. Further, when integrating new technologies or 

36 
equipment into a shipyard, the simulation can be used to show planned or 
expected results. However, it is not suitable to use when studying production 
efficiency of the whole process nor organization effectiveness because the model 
concentrates on resource and equipment planning only. 
Krause et al. (2004) introduce a discrete event simulation. According to them 
it is useful for evaluating the different scenarios used for investment planning, 
scheduling, and resource planning. They argue that traditional static tools no 
longer provide sufficient outcomes for controlling the complex elements of 
shipbuilding. Further, they say that only by compiling a simulation of the great 
number of variant parts can their dynamic effects be evaluated. The simulation 
includes the product, resources, process structure, continuous product data 
flow, shipyard layout planning, production planning, and logistics. According to 
them, to achieve an appropriate result from the simulation data management, 
each part of a ship including all material with all relevant geometrical 
dimensions, the weight and quality must be described in the product data.  
Because of this feature, this kind of modelling tool is not feasible for studying 
production efficiency and organization in shipbuilding case as the needed 
information for a viable simulation of this aspect is not available. 
Kim et al.  (2005) introduce a model for a simulation-based shipbuilding 
system in the shipyard manufacturing process. It is a process model for block 
erection processes. It can simulate crane operation and block erection in a 
virtual dock. As it concentrates on a limited part of the process only, it is not a 
feasible tool to use for studying production efficiency and the impact of 
organization. 
Alfeld et al. (1998) describe a software program that simulates the dynamic 
complexities of the ship construction process. According to them, this 
simulation model of the shipyard production process captures both the essential 
physical shipbuilding activities and the essential management decision-making 
activities that work to support the physical production processes. According to 
their description, the application consists of two independent sub-models that 
identify the overall shipyard facility and manpower resources and the 
construction tasks required to build a ship. They interact to calculate over time 
the specific allocation of resources necessary to produce a ship. The output is 
the durations and man-hour loadings based on dynamic resource availability. It 
also helps to quantify the cost and schedule impact of delays and disruptions as 
well as identifying the actions to overcome such problems. This model also 

37 
focuses on resources and scheduling and thus is not suitable for studying 
production efficiency and the impact of organization. 
König et al. (2007) present a constraint-based simulation of the outfitting 
processes in shipbuilding and civil engineering. That is an approach used to 
detail outfitting tasks and their corresponding restrictions and requirements. It 
is also an appropriate instrument to use to support the planning process, while 
focusing only on outfitting. It is not suitable for studying production efficiency 
and the impacts of organization.   
Additionally, when considering the methodology for this study, one option 
would be to analyze the process KPIs of several cruise ships and then study 
which organization type gives the best result. However, this kind of quantitative 
historical data was not available for analyzing. Also the use of  the benchmarking 
methods described in Section 2.2 were not feasible, because of the needed data 
for that purpose is very large and it is typically company confidential 
information and not available for this kind of research.   
Bayesian Network techniques were chosen due to the large number of 
variables involved in any shipbuilding project, and the interactions and 
dependencies between them, and also as that complicated process obviously 
involves uncertainty. Also, the fact that BN has been used in the marine industry 
before, e.g., widely in marine safety-related studies, encouraged us to choose BN 
as the modelling approach for the current research. 
2.5 Bayesian Networks  
Bayesian Networks (BN) is the process of reasoning under uncertainty, using a 
graphical model with variables and nodes with interdependencies. It is the 
consistent combination of information from various sources. According to 
Charniak (1991), it is a way to model a situation wherein causality plays a role, 
but also where the understanding of what is actually going on is incomplete, so 
the process must be described probabilistically. These dependencies or arcs in 
BN specify the independent assumptions that must hold true between the 
random variables. These independent assumptions determine what kind of 
probability information is required to specify the probability distribution among 
the random variables in the network. To specify the probability distribution of 
a Bayesian Network, one must know the prior probabilities of all root nodes and 
the conditional probabilities of all no root nodes, given all possible 

38 
combinations of their direct predecessors. Figure 12 shows an example of 
Bayesian Network concerning system safety (Fenton & Neil, 2012). 
Figure 12. An example of Bayesian Network. 
Bayesian Networks are techniques used for graphically representing the joint 
probability distribution of a set of variables (Darwiche, 2009). The structure of 
a BN model is a directed acyclic graph, wherein the graph nodes represent the 
model variables and the arcs between the nodes describe the direct variable 
dependencies. Each network node has a finite number of mutually exclusive 
states with their probabilities of occurrence. These probabilities depend on the 
current states of the potential parent nodes for each variable, i.e., the variables 
that have an arc to the variable in question. BNs can be utilized for descriptive 
modeling of a system and can include uncertainty, but also prediction. By 
augmenting a BN with the variables that describe potential decisions and 
variables that measure its utilities, the resulting influence diagram can be 
applied to a decision analysis whenever uncertainty is involved (Jensen, 1996; 
Nielsen & Jensen, 2009; Stamelos et al., 2003).  
According to Joyce (2003) Bayes Theorem is a mathematical formula that is 
used for calculating conditional probabilities, using subjectivist or Bayesian 
approaches to epistemology, statistics, and inductive logic. Subjectivists lean on 
conditional probabilities and the models of empirical learning. Bayes Theorem 
simplifies the calculation of conditional probabilities and clarifies the features 
of the subjectivist position. Further according to Joyce the probability of a 
hypothesis H is conditional on a given body of data E and is the ratio of the 
unconditional probability of the conjunction of the hypothesis and the data to 

39 
the unconditional probability of the data alone. Thus, the probability of H
conditional on E is defined as 
PE(H) = P(H&E)/P(E),  
 
(1) 
provided that both terms of this ratio exist and P(E <0  
Here: 
PE is a probability function.  
If E entails H, then PE (H) = 1. 
If  P (H) = 1, then PE(H) = 1. 
The Bayes Theorem relates the direct probability of a hypothesis conditional on 
a given body of data, PE(H), to the inverse probability of the data conditional on 
the hypothesis, PH(E). 
PE (H) = [PH (E) P(H)]/P(E)  
(2) 
Where: 
P (H) is the prior probability of hypothesis H.
PE (H) is the posterior probability of hypothesis H (in the light of evidence E). 
PH (E) is likelihood of evidence E on hypothesis H.
To evaluate Bayesian Networks, there are several software programs that have 
implemented the needed algorithms, e.g., SMILE (Structural Modeling, 
Inference, and the Learning Engine). SMILE is implemented in C++ in a 
platform independent fashion. SMILE is equipped with an outer shell, a 
developer's environment for building graphical decision models, known as 
GeNIe (Graphical Network Interface), a simple interface to SMILE, is a 
development environment for building graphical decision-theoretic models. It 
enables promoting decision-theoretic methods in decision support systems. It 
has been developed at the Decision Systems Laboratory, University of 
Pittsburgh (Bayes fusion, 2016). According to them the structure of a GeNIe 
network is a graphical, qualitative illustration of the interactions among the set 
of variables that it models. Nodes are usually drawn as circles or ovals. The 
network also represents the quantitative relationships among the modeled 
variables. Numerically, it represents the joint probability distribution among 
them. This distribution is described by exploring the probabilistic 
independences among the modeled variables. Each node is described by a 

40 
probability distribution conditional on its direct predecessors. Nodes with no 
predecessors are described by prior probability distributions. Both the structure 
and the numerical parameters of a Bayesian Network can be elicited from an 
expert.  
As experts individually assess the probabilities, the sessions produce multiple 
probability tables for the variables. Separate Bayesian Network models are built 
based on the assessments of each individual expert. In addition to the individual 
expert models, the experts’ answers are to be combined with linear opinion 
pooling and applying equal weights for each expert, creating a simple but robust 
and well-performing method for combining multiple expert judgments into one 
single judgment (O’Hagan et al., 2006). 
BN has been widely applied to problems in medical diagnosis, map 
learning, language understanding, and many other fields including 
shipbuilding 
(Lee 
et 
al., 
2009). 
However, 
as 
very 
few 
process/management problem BN models have been published, their 
application to the cruise shipbuilding process description or its 
evaluation is still unresolved (Aurelio de Oliveira et al., 2012).  In more 
recent years, however, BNs have been applied to several maritime-
domain related studies (Eleye-Datubo et al., 2006; Antao et al., 2008; 
Kelangath et al., 2011; Hänninen & Kujala, 2012; Martins & Maturana, 
2013; Montewka et al., 2013; Lehikoinen et al., 2013; Hänninen et al., 
2013; Akhtar & Utne, 2014; Montewka et al., 2014; Goerlandt & 
Montewka, 2014; Hänninen & Kujala, 2014; Hänninen et al., 2014). Most 
of the aforementioned studies came from The Maritime Risk and Safety 
research group at Aalto University quite recently. Based on those results, 
one can argue that BN is an effective tool for modeling complicated 
systems, which also encourages the use of BN for modeling the cruise ship 
building process. 
2.6 Description of other methods used in this thesis 
Observation was the method utilized for defining the variables for the 
model. According to Taylor-Powell and Steele (1996), observation provides an 
opportunity to document activities, behavior and the physical aspects without 
having to depend on the willingness and ability of any others to respond to 
specific questions. They argue that observation is a good tool when trying to 

41 
understand an ongoing behavior, process, unfolding situation or an event. Also, 
observing the management operations and procedures may provide better 
information than relying on reports. They add that recording the observations 
can be done in various ways such as keeping checklists, photos, and field notes.   
The use of observation here was based on the vast experience of the researcher 
after having held various positions at a shipyard over the course of a long period 
of time. The matters observed were activities which will impact production 
efficiency as such or in any later stage of the process. This observation was done 
on every phase, starting from the time when an owner’s inquiry is received in 
the shipyard until ship delivery. Also, the typical causes of inefficiency in each 
phase were noted. In addition to this, other typical problems related to 
efficiency in the cruise ship production process were reviewed.  
According to Koch (2011), the 80/20 Pareto principle states that there is an 
inbuilt imbalance between causes and results, inputs and outputs, and effort 
and reward. Typically it can mean that 80 percent of consequences flow from 
20 percent of causes. To find the essential factors affecting to production 
efficiency, Pareto principle was used. On that basis, the amount of potential 
variables found through observation was reduced by selecting the most 
important variables relating to production efficiency. Afterwards, a portion of 
those factors were chosen as model variables for the model.

related to Bayesian model use for 
cruise shipbuilding process production 
efficiency 
3.1 Creation of the model 
In order to study the impact of organization type to production efficiency, a 
model of the cruise shipbuilding process is required. The intention is to build a 
Bayesian Network model for a process resulting in the probability of agreed 
property at the end of a particular process. Herein that process is cruise 
shipbuilding and the targeted result is a settled production efficiency level. The 
aim is to clarify whether the organizational structure used to manage that 
process impacts this probability, so the level of efficiency itself is not thus the 
focus here. The effect of organizational structure can be studied using the model 
by applying a decision formula that contains different types of organizational 
structures. The core part of the model is to determine the variables in question, 
define their states, and identify the dependencies between them.  
Variables 
In this study, the process in question is a cruise shipbuilding process in a 
shipyard that has built several big cruise ships. An illustrative visual 
presentation of that process is shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. It is necessary to 
understand the entire cruise ship building process starting with the project 
design phase before any contract until the delivery of the vessel. The variables 
related to production efficiency were discovered during a review of the process. 
This process was studied phase by phase, starting from the time when an 
owner’s inquiry is received in the aforementioned shipyard. 
Six main phases can be observed in this process: Project design, basic design, 
detail design, hull building, outfitting, and commissioning. Of the above project 
design begins before the contract is signed, that is, while the vessel concept is 
still being defined. Simultaneously to all the aforementioned phases, the 

43 
planning process is ongoing. The planning process consists of defining the 
building practices, milestones, schedules, resource planning, reporting, and 
certain supportive activities. Project management continues during the entire 
process as well. 
This review was based on the vast experience of the researcher after having 
been involved in building several cruise ships and being responsible for various 
processes ranging from design, purchasing, production, quality and planning to 
an actual project manager. When the researcher was working in design 
planning, the process for basic design and detail design was reviewed and the 
everyday challenges of the process were met. During the purchasing period of 
subcontracting and interior material and TK-contracts, the essential features of 
the purchasing process were handled to show the importance of clear scopes 
and purchasing schedules. Being given the responsibility of the interior 
outfitting manager finally demonstrated the complexity of building cruise ship 
cabin areas and public areas for passengers and crew, while at the same time 
taking care of the inspections and commissioning of the hotel part of the ship. 
The role of the quality manager in outfitting deepened the importance of having 
a clear understanding of the key processes involved.  A project planner is 
responsible for the plan of the whole project from project design to actual 
delivery of the vessel. Working as a project manager on cruise ships further 
increased the researcher’s knowledge of the various interdependencies that 
must combine all the individual activities into one complicated and complete 
entity.       
The method that was utilized for this study was observation. Every main phase 
was first analyzed by clarifying the steps in the activity flow diagram. Then the 
inputs and outputs of these steps were identified.  After that, the whole process, 
including project design, basic design, detail design, hull building, outfitting, 
and commissioning was investigated as an entity of thinking which factors 
impact production efficiency either directly or indirectly. The failure analysis, 
i.e. a review of the possibilities that can cause inefficiency, resulted in the 
gathering of a number of items. They were reviewed and the reasons behind 
them were clarified. Also, typical problems related to scheduling and efficiency 
during the cruise ship production process and the reasons behind those issues 
were also reviewed.  
Based on observation during the researcher’s experience in different parts of 
the process, the typical outcomes that resulted from activities in project design
leading to inefficiency at some stage can be: 
x
technical calculations are not reliable, 

44 
x
rules have not been followed,  
x
specification is incoherent, unclear, expensive and contains risks,  
x
a supplier network has not been checked and confirmed,  
x
owner demands have not been followed,  
x
general arrangement is unclear and constricted,   
x
cost calculations not based on building strategy and confirmed cost 
elements, and main milestones and work load studies are unrealistic.      
In the basic design phase, the typical outcomes leading to inefficiency at some 
stage can be:  
x
faulty calculations,  
x
poor classification design,  
x
inadequate system process descriptions,  
x
delayed architectural design,  
x
delayed purchasing activities,  
x
unclear supplier scopes,  
x
a wrong work load plan,  
x
a faulty basic design schedule and inadequate building practices and 
poor schedule and module plan.  
In detail design phase, the typical outcomes leading to inefficiency at some stage 
can be: 
x
poor design coordination,  
x
unclear drawings,  
x
faulty parts lists,  
x
insufficient number of standards,  
x
delayed purchasing,  
x
an ignored area/system relationship,  
x
non-specific job orders.   
In hull phase the typical outcomes leading to inefficiency at some stage can be:  
x
inadequate strength and vibration analysis,  
x
delayed opening information from the outfitting design,  
x
poor dimensional accuracy,  
x
poor welding quality,  
x
poor loading plan for heavy lifts and modules,  
x
non- synchronized hull services,  

45 
x
low block outfitting rate,  
x
delays in the production schedule and material delivery. 
In the outfitting phase, the typical outcomes leading to inefficiency at some 
stage can be: 
x
low prefabrication and modularization rate,  
x
low block/ grand block outfitting rate,  
x
unclear responsibilities,  
x
wrong work order,  
x
wrong document revisions,  
x
material delays,  
x
delayed system work effort.    
In the commissioning phase, the typical outcomes leading to inefficiency at 
some stage can be:  
x
inspections not done in connection with the actual work,  
x
delayed system readiness,  
x
unclear scope and role of the suppliers,  
x
an inadequate inspection plan and program. 
Generally delays in schedule and incompetence cause inefficiency in phases of 
the process. All of the above failure possibilities lead to different consequences 
later in the process, and therefore need to be corrected before the delivery of the 
vessel. Executing these corrective actions can add several additional tasks to the 
original plan, which means extra time spent on the delivery and therefore, 
greater cost. 
 Every detailed phase of the shipbuilding process was thus analyzed by 
clarifying the inputs and outputs, the content and what can cause inefficiency 
either during each unique phase or when entering into the production phase. 
Following the completion of this analysis,, the mapped process was reviewed by 
considering which activities will impact production efficiency in any later stage 
of the process. This evaluation was done on every phase and activity in the 
described process.  Afterwards the typical causes of inefficiency in each phase 
were noted and clarified. Additionally, other typical problems related to 
scheduling and efficiency in the cruise ship production process and their causes 
were reviewed.  
On that basis, the factors that could potentially affect production efficiency 
were chosen for a closer review using Pareto (Koch, 2011). According to that 
evaluation, 20% of sources cause 80% of the problems, which leads one to 

46 
concentrate on the causes that will have the greatest impact on the process if 
satisfactorily remedied. Afterwards, a portion of those factors were chosen as 
model variables for the respective sub-models and the main model as described 
in Section 3.2. Because there was a rather large number of candidates, only the 
most evident ones were considered for the model. Due to the large number of 
variables needed for the model structure, an initial clustering of these variables 
had to be executed. These clusters were named using to the aforementioned 
main phases as the sub-models of the cruise shipbuilding process, namely 
project design, basic design, detail design, hull, outfitting and commissioning. 
In addition, the model included a so-called “main model”, that contained 
planning and project management activities and combined the sub- models into 
a single comprehensive entity. 
States of the variables 
The variables in this model are discrete, meaning that they can take values from 
a set of states. For every variable, two states were determined. These states were 
chosen so that they best describe the status of production efficiency related to 
each variable in both the best and worst case scenarios. In other words, 
describing the feature of the variable from production efficiency point of view. 
For instance, the supplier network, in terms of production efficiency, it becomes 
meaningful whether the network is “good” or “poor”.  The good network means 
that the shipyard has reliable contractors who work according to the contracts 
in the best possible way. Further, when considering variable competence, the 
states are “high” or “low”.  The states can also describe the features of the 
variable in as specific way, e.g., the variable job order that has such states as 
“Defines the budget for specified work” and “Does not define the budget for 
specified work”. This definition means that first state is better for production 
efficiency because it gives a clear target for the person and therefore enabling 
better efficiency. The states for all the other variables were determined by 
applying this same principle. It is important that the experts understand the 
nature and content of the states correctly, because these definitions form the 
basis for the elicitation. 
In this phase, the variables and their states were documented and entered into 
the GeNIe software by a Bayesian Network expert who properly guided the 
building of the network system wise. Figure 13 shows the principle.  

47 
Figure 13. States of variable Supplier network. 
The variables and their states are explained in detail in Section 3.2. 
Interdependencies  
Based on experience with the processes and the relationships between the 
variables, the arcs between the model variables were determined to show their 
dependencies. To avoid an overly complicated model, only those dependencies 
assumed as the most important ones were modeled. The dependencies of these 
variables are explained in Appendix 1 and were added to the GeNIe model by 
the Bayesian expert who checked the proper technical structure of the model.  
Decision formula 
To utilize the model to study the effects of organizing the process, one decision 
variable was added to the model, organization type, which reflected the 
organizing method for the shipbuilding process precisely. The type of 
organization states are Project Organization, Line Organization or Hybrid 
Organization. Hybrid Organization means that the project is partly controlled 
by the project group and partly by the line organization. The presentation of 
these organization structures can be found in section 2.3. All three mentioned 
organization structures have been used in the shipyard in question for the last 
30 years when cruise ships have been built. 
The first state is a basic line type of organization, which normally has a vertical 
hierarchy between its different organizational levels. Typical line departments 
in shipyard are sales, design, procurement, and production. In a Line 
Organization, control of a project is divided between main departments and the 

48 
shipyard director is responsible for fulfilling the ship contract. In this case, the 
role of the project manager is to take care of the owner interface. Decisions that 
affect costs, scheduling, and quality are all made in these functions, i.e., the 
departments.  
Alternatively, a Project Organization is established to take care of specific 
projects by using teams of specialists from different functional areas within the 
organization. This is the next state. After a project is completed, the Project 
Organization as such no longer exists. In a Project Organization, the named 
group of representatives from the main departments is responsible for taking 
care of the project for that part of and is also responsible for decisions 
concerning costs, scheduling, and quality. In cruise ship Project Organization a 
naval architect is also named as a project group member due to the large field 
of rules and regulations. The project group can also be nominated, so that the 
responsibilities of the project group members are based on, for example WBS 
(Work Breakdown Structure). The members of project group report to the 
project manager. The responsibility for fulfilling a ship contract belongs to the 
project manager along with the project group.  
Finally, the project can be conducted within a Hybrid Organization, a matrix, 
which in this study means that organizational structure responsibilities 
concerning the project are divided between the Line Organization and the 
Project Organization. Typically, this process is carried out so that the main 
functions, i.e., departments have the responsibility for technical contents and 
costs, while the project group is responsible for the scheduling and the owner 
interface. These decisions are made together with the line managers and the 
project manager.  
The most important aspect of the model is determining which variables this 
decision formula will impact. After being responsible for a production 
department in a shipyard that was acting as line organization , as well as having 
been involved and responsible for several project groups in different cruise 
shipbuilding projects, these dependencies were determined based actual 
practical experience of the researcher. 
Elicitation of the variable probabilities in the model 
To specify the probability distribution of a Bayesian Network, expert judgment 
is needed. In the model that means that the conditional probability tables, i.e., 
the model parameters, were specified by experts using judgment. The 
qualification requirement for being an expert was possessing broad knowledge 

49 
and experience with the shipyard in question cruise shipbuilding process and 
also understanding the procedure undertaken for the elicitation of those 
probabilities. The experience needs to be in the cruise ship building process, 
coming from different disciplines such as design, purchasing, production, 
management and project management for several cruise ship projects to clearly 
understand the dependencies, reasons, and consequences in the shipyard under 
review. Experience is needed in several different kinds of situations in order to 
be able to see the entities and reason- consequence-relationships in the broadest 
way. After carefully considering three experts who had worked continuously for 
about 30 years in this specific shipyard and determining they were qualified, 
they were asked to provide their opinions and views on the suggested 
parameters. Before eliciting the model content itself, including nodes, their 
parameters, links and discretizing were discussed with the experts.  Based on 
their opinions and comments the model was updated so, that the consensus of 
the model was achieved. The experts agreed that the model responded to the 
actual process. 
The first expert, Expert A in the following, had 30 years' experience in 
shipbuilding at the shipyard. This experience consisted of purchasing, quality 
management, 
interior 
outfitting 
production, 
planning, 
and 
project 
management. The first elicitation session featured Expert A and a facilitator, the 
Bayesian expert. The facilitator first briefed Expert A. In practice, the 
preparation for the actual probability elicitation was also conducted. 
Background material on the probability concept and any potential biases 
regarding expert elicitation was sent to the expert before the session. In the 
beginning of the elicitation session, the same matters were again introduced to 
the expert. Also, the purpose, content, and motivation for the elicitation were 
explained. The expert then conducted a brief calibration assessment to become 
aware of the potential tendencies toward biases when following the technique 
proposed for an elicitation situation (Simola et al., 2005). 
For the elicitation, a direct probability estimation method was applied. For 
this purpose, the option to visualize the probabilities as bars, available in the 
GeNIe BN software (SMILE, Druzdzel, 1999), was utilized. Every node was 
judged by experts. After activating the node definition in GeNIe, the dialog box 
presented in Figure 14a displays where the probabilities of occurrence of each 
of the states can be entered. As the variable Supplier network has no parents, 
the elicitation is based straight on the experts’ view for which state for the 
variable is more probable than other. As each variable consisted of two states, 

50 
the actual elicitation was the expert assessing which state was most probably 
true and to what extent it was true.
Figure 14a. The screenshot of GeNIe:  A numerical elicitation of the “supplier  
network” variable with no parents between the states “good” and  
“poor”. 
The other option is to make the elicitation by visual tool as presented in Figure 
14b.  
Figure 14b. The screenshot of GeNIe: A visual elicitation of the “supplier  
network” variable between the states “good” and “poor”. 
Figures 14a and 14b show that the expert decided that a state “good” (blue) was 
a more probable state than “poor” state for the supplier network with probability 
values 0.71 / 0.29.   
If the node has parents, it creates conditional options and the elicitation 
becomes more complex. The more parents there are, the more complicated the 
elicitation is. Figure 15 shows the node Module plan, which has three parents: 
(1) the main schedule with main milestones; (2) the detailed building practice; 
and (3) high level building practice. The judgment was done for every separate 
case shown in the table by assessing which of the states, either Major or Minor, 
were more probable and how much so in each case. For example, is it more 
probable to have a Major module plan in the case where the Main schedule with 
milestones is based on correct statistics and where detailed building practice 
enables comprehensive planning and the whole process is included in a High 
level building practice. The results can be seen in the left side columns, which 

51 
indicate that the Major module plan is true with a probability of 0.81 against the 
Minor plan is true with a probability of 0.19. 
Figure 15. The screenshot of GeNIe: A conditional probability table 
Whenever the decision formula impacts the variable, it can be seen in the 
conditions table. If there are no parents, as seen in Figure 16, then the case is 
simple. But if there are parents, then the judging becomes more complicated 
especially when in addition to organization type, several parents impact the 
variable. Figure 16 shows a node where the decision formula has an impact.  In 
this case, there are no parents, and thus the case is simple. 
Figure 16. The screenshot of GeNIe:  A node with decision formula impact. 
For each variable, parent, and decision formula combination, the expert and the 
analyst adjusted the bars together until the expert was able to provide the most 
accurate probability representation. The software was utilized as is, as no 
changes were required.  
The eliciting process had the expert consider the different probabilities based 
on the expert’s experience in three different organizational structures over the 
course of several years spent at the shipyard. The expert had to judge which of 
the states is more true and how much more true taking into account the 
conditions defined by the predecessors. The Facilitator and Expert A undertook 
the elicitation together. Elicitation was done in sessions of one sub-model at a 
time.  
The elicitation with Expert B was done separately with Expert A serving as the 
facilitator. Expert B had 32 years’ experience in shipbuilding. That experience 

52 
consisted of purchasing, engineering, planning, project management, sales, and 
shipyard management. Initial guidance regarding expert practice elicitations 
was given to Expert B by Expert A. The elicitations were done in three sessions. 
The first session addressed the elicited project design, basic design, and detail 
design. The second session included hull, outfitting, and commissioning. The 
last session elicited the main model from the expert. Expert C had 32 years’ 
experience in shipbuilding consisting of research and development, purchasing, 
design management, working on several cruise ship project groups, production 
development, and sales. The procedure for the Expert C elicitation was similar 
to that of Expert B.  
The total amount of the individual judgments for the probabilities in this 
model was 5610 with the variables having two states. These values are seen in 
Appendix 2, which describes the extent of the elicitation work. If there were 
additional states, they would complicate the process and broaden the judgment 
considerably wider. 
As these experts individually assessed these probabilities, the sessions 
produced multiple probability tables for the variables. Separate Bayesian 
Network models were elicited based on the assessments of each individual 
expert. After this, the experts’ answers were combined with linear opinion 
pooling and applying equal weights for each expert into one single judgment 
(reference to formula (3)) (O’Hagan et al., 2006). It is a simple and widely used 
technique. There, a consensus distribution f Ǉ) is obtained as some function of 
the individual distributions {f1 Ǉ), ..., fn Ǉ)}, with the consensus distribution 
then used for decision-making purposes. 
The simplest such function is the linear opinion 
(3) 
which just a weighted average of the individual distributions with weights wi 
summing to 1. For instance, the decision maker may choose to give each expert 
equal weight, so that wi = 1/n (for all i) and f Ǉ) is the simple average of the fi 
Ǉ)s. 
3.2 The structure of the model 
The model is not a process description of the cruise shipbuilding process; rather 
it is a network of factors that then together through the mechanism of 
interactions affect the production efficiency of the cruise shipbuilding process 
(Hellgren et al., 2016). The cruise shipbuilding process contains numerous 

53 
activities and interdependencies and it is not easy to find the most important 
issues affecting production efficiency. This model helps to identify those factors 
in the process and dependencies between them. It enables one to focus on the 
essentials when improving the production efficiency.  
The model consists of six sub-models and a main model that compiles the sub 
models into a single entity. The sub-models reflect the main disciplines of the 
process, which are project design, basic design, detail design, hull, outfitting, 
and commissioning. The main model also reflects planning- and project 
management-related factors. There is also one decision variable in the model 
called “Organization type”.  It represents the different methods that can be used 
to organize and manage the cruise ship building process. Altogether, there are 
85 random variables called nodes in the model. Every variable has two states. 
The states of these variables have been determined depending on the individual 
variable and its nature and the consideration on its production efficiency aspect. 
In addition, the decision variable has three states. 
The structure of the model is presented in detail in Appendix 1. Figure 17 
shows the overall dependencies between the main model variables and the sub-
models. The green rounded rectangle represents the sub-models, and the yellow 
ovals are variables. A red rectangle indicates the decision variable.  
Figure 17. The main model for the cruise ship building process for production  
                      efficiency. 
Appendix 1, Table 1.1, presents the description of all the main model variables, 
their parents, children, and states together with a short description of each 

54 
variable. Appendix 1, Table 1.2 includes a description of the sub-model “project 
design” with its variables, their parents, children and states together with a 
short description of those variables. Appendix 1, Table 1.3 contains, respectively, 
the description of the sub-model “basic design”. Appendix 1, Tables 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 
and 1.7 describe the sub models, the “detailed design”, “hull”, “outfitting”, and 
“commissioning”, in a similar manner.  
The model shows the structure of the production efficiency-related variables 
in the context of the studied shipyard. A comparison of the effect of different 
organizational options is presented using the decision formula. The use of the 
model requires that there are qualified experts who have the necessary 
experience of the whole process and all the alternative organization 
circumstances in question for a long enough time span. 

55 
The sub-model project design shown in Figure 18 includes 12 nodes. 
Figure 18. Project design network for the model 
The variables chosen for project design phase have either a direct or an 
indirect impact on production efficiency. See Table 1 below for details. 
Table 1. Project design variables for the sub-model. 
Enquiry
Owner's enquiry to shipyard to deliver a cruise vessel is a variable 
in the sense of its accuracy. This means that the more detailed the 
enquiry; the more it may restrict that shipyard possibilities to use 
its own effective working methods. The general 
specification makes it possible to use freely working methods 
typically used at the shipyard. States are Detailed and General. 
Specification
Specification is a document, which defines the technical and 
architectural contents of the ship with respect to complexity.  If 
the specification is complicated, then the design and actual work 
is complicated. If the specification is easy and clear, it becomes 
possible to execute the work clearly and efficiently. States are 
High complexity and Low complexity. 
General
Arrangement
General arrangement defines the layouts of the decks of a ship. If 
GA is clear and open it is possible to work efficiently without 
difficult shapes and a tightly packed working place. States are 
High complexity and Low complexity 
Rules
Rules define the technical conditions to be followed in the 
structures and operation. Depending on the complexity of rules 
the structures can be in a production phase more or less 
production friendly. States are High complexity and Low 
complexity 

56 
Technical 
Calculations 
Calculations form the theoretical basis for defining the actual 
technical properties. The more reliable the calculations are, the 
more clearer and efficient are the phases coming afterwards 
(basic design ->detail design ->hull -> outfitting). States are 
High reliability and Low reliability. 
Mid ship 
Section Hull 
Shape 
Defines the essential part of the ship's steel hull. The complexity 
of the mid ship section impacts the production efficiency of the 
hull, as complex structures cause inefficiency. States are High 
complexity and Low complexity.
High-level 
System 
Descriptions 
The system's functional description presents the main features of 
its functionality. The content can be clear and simple or unclear 
and complicated, thus impacting the productivity of the entire 
process. This leads to the statuses High clarity and Low clarity. 
Competence 
of Shipyard 
The level of know-how is a variable that affects the effectiveness 
of the project design. If the know-how is a high level, it becomes 
evident, as the effectivity of the work is greater. If there is a need 
for subcontracting, that circumstance creates inefficiency because 
the know-how in this phase is crucial and also NDAs (Non-
Disclosure Agreements) are demanded. Here the states are High 
and Low.
High-level 
Building 
Practice and 
Milestones 
Building practice defines the main principles of WBS structure, 
i.e., how design, purchasing and building the ship are controlled. 
This variable indicates the overall comprehensiveness of 
planning. Comprehensive planning enables better productivity 
than doing it separate planning. States are Whole process and 
Only production. 
Supplier 
Network 
The quality and diversity of accepted design, components, 
materials, subcontracting, and turnkey contractors is a variable 
that has a big impact on resources and thus on productivity. The 
state of a network can be described within respect to quality and 
diversity. States are Good and Poor. 
Cost Statistic
For calculation purposes unit prices of cost elements of the ship 
are used. The validity of the cost elements is crucial when setting 
a cost target. So, the reliability of this variable affects the realistic 
basis of a budget and through that motivation keeping the targets. 
States are the good and poor reliability of Key Performance 
Indicators. 
Budget
The prime cost that corresponds the specification, mid ship 
section and GA will be the budget. The budget variable describes 
the WBS-based target of responsible persons and thus connects 
costs to WBS. Whether the target is realistic and achievable or not 

57 
it influences productivity, which suggests that the budget and 
work breakdown structure are corresponding. States are Enabling 
a realistic target and Not enabling a realistic target. 
The sub-model basic design includes 11 nodes. See Figure 19 below. 
Figure 19. Basic design network for the model. 
The variables chosen for the basic design phase will have either a direct or an 
indirect impact on production efficiency. See Table 2. 
Table 2. Basic design variables for the sub-model. 
Owner
The activity of the owner can influence the shipyard’s daily 
work. The more the owner participates in the daily activities, 
the more that can lower productivity due to numerous 
inspections and demands for clarifications. States are High 
activity and low activity. 
Architectural 
Design 
If the architectural design is the responsibility of the owner it 
influences productivity. Owner works according to their own 
schedules, which does not necessarily comply with the 
production phase schedule of the shipyard. Also, if the 
architectural design is the responsibility of shipyard, then 
production friendliness can be taken into account in a more 
efficient way. States are High production friendliness and Low 
production friendliness. 

58 
Arrangement 
Design 
The layout design of the interior and machinery areas can be 
done so both the production friendliness of these structures 
and the working space onboard are taken into account. Both of 
these aspects impact production efficiency. States are High 
complexity and Low complexity. 
Calculations
Calculations deliver a theoretical basis for the technical 
properties. The more reliable the calculations are, the clearer 
and more efficient will be the phases coming after (detail 
design ->hull -> outfitting). States are High reliability and Low 
reliability. 
Classification 
Design 
In classification design, the dimensions of the steel structures 
are defined. The more it is possible to use recurrence in these 
structures, the more efficient will be the detail design and 
production. States are High recurrence in structures and Low 
recurrence in structures. 
System 
Descriptions & 
Schemes & 
Parts lists 
Complexity of systems and their expression influences
production efficiency because it is the basis for the detailed 
design for all the vessel. If there are ambiguous and not clear 
details in the system design, the detail designers will need to 
clarify them at a later stage. Also, if details are clear in the 
basic design, production can be more efficient and need no 
additional clarifications. States are Unambiguous and 
Ambiguous. 
Approval 
Procedure 
If the process for how the classification society and the owner 
give their approval for any specified documentation is time 
consuming and difficult, there can be delays in the design 
schedule and thus inefficiency in the production phase. If the 
approval activities are scheduled into the design schedule, it 
will be easier to see their overall influence on the latter phases 
of the project and prevent such delays. Statuses are a Whole 
process scheduled in the basic design schedule and a Whole 
process not scheduled in the basic design schedule.
Turnkey
Entities and 
Scope 
Basing both scopes and borders of turnkey deliveries on a work 
breakdown structure is a more efficient way of controlling both 
because then they are a natural part of the entire control 
system. Also, when the borders follow the functional entities 
onboard, more efficiency is achieved. States are Functional 
entities, based on the work breakdown structure and Not 

59 
functional entities, which are not based on the work 
breakdown structure. 
Purchasing 
Contracts & 
Material Scope  
When the scope of suppliers are based on a work breakdown 
structure and are not dependent on the progress of other 
suppliers or shipyard work, the commercial terms are bound to 
their own progress which creates more effectivity. States are 
Independent entities with progress- related payment terms 
and Dependent entities having no progress-related payment 
terms. 
Basic Design 
Competence  
The level of know-how is a variable that affects the
effectiveness of the basic design. If the know-how is a high 
level, it is evident that effectivity of the work is better. Any 
need for subcontracting creates inefficiency because of 
borderlines. Solid know-how in this phase is crucial and NDAs 
complicate this. The states are High and Low. 
Basic Design 
Progress 
Normally when the work is done according to the schedule 
with adequate resources, there is better efficiency than having 
delays and struggling with them. When delays occur, catch up 
activities have to be established to keep to the schedule, which 
creates inefficiency and additional costs. States are In schedule 
and In budget and Delays and/or budget overruns. 
The sub-model detail design includes 13 nodes. See Figure 20. 
Figure 20. Detail design network for the model. 
The variables chosen for the detail design phase have either a direct or an 
indirect impact on production efficiency. See Table 3. 

60 
Table 3. Detail design variables for the sub-model. 
Detail Design 
competence 
The level of engineering know-how available in shipyard 
affects productivity directly because skillful and experienced 
designers can do their work more effectively and with fewer 
issues. States are High and Low.
Area 
Arrangements 
Layout of areas impacts productivity during the outfitting
phase onboard. Depending on the layout, it is either easy or 
not easy to plan different ongoing work simultaneously there. 
States are Enables planning of sub-areas for better effectivity 
and Does not enable planning of sub-areas for better 
effectivity.
Detail Design
progress 
When detailed design documents are done according to the 
schedule, that success enables better productivity. Work 
preconditions exist if no delay occurs. States are In schedule 
and In budget Delays and budget overruns.
Detail Design  
Progress 
Preconditions 
When basic design is proceeding according to plan, it enables 
DD to proceed effectively. If budget enables a realistic target 
for design teams, there are possibilities for support 
productivity to increase. States are Good and Poor. 
Detail Design
schedule 
The design documents are produced according to the detail 
design schedule. If the need of the documents is connected to 
the production schedule and they are met accordingly, 
productivity in outfitting is helped because there are no delays 
in starting the work due to missing drawings or materials. 
States are Need is based on the respective production phase 
and Need is not based on the respective production phase.
3D Tools for 
Routing and 
Follow-up  
With the help of an integrated 3 D design system with 
standards and material components in an electronic format it 
is possible to prepare a design effectively including the routes 
of pipes, ducts and cables. Also connecting actual work 
readiness to the system enables additional effectivity of the 
outfitting work as commission preconditions. States are In use 
and Not in use.
Standards
The more ready-made standards there are for materials and 
for working details, the better the efficiency that can be 
achieved. Working standards for installation ease design and 
also make the training of workers easier. States High extent 
and Low extent.
Workshop 
Drawings & 
Parts Lists 
When the design documentation for manufacturing and 
installation is done as corresponding entities to the 

61 
production, it contains all essentials, is clear, and it enables 
the logical scheduling of items and purchasing entities. The 
tighter the connection is between detailed design and 
production, the more efficient will be the process. States are 
Unambiguous and Ambiguous.
Job Order
With a job order, the work is prepared beforehand, so the 
worker can immediately start the work without studying what 
it is about and whether all needed materials are available. 
When a piece of work is prepared in advance, it can include 
description as the instructions for the worker and also an 
estimate or budget for the worker and make the process thus 
more efficient. States are Defines the budget for specified work 
and Does not define the budget for specified work.
Component 
Purchasing 
If there is a possibility to purchase materials via competition,
getting the best product with the best price and the right time 
is easier. This process also affects to productivity. To be able to 
do this task there needs to be enough time for it. States are 
Possibility for competition and No possibility for competition.
Detailed 
Schemes 
When the systems’ schemes are properly finalized, so 
additional working drawings are not needed. There is greater 
productivity because design work time is saved. States are Can 
be used as working drawings and Cannot be used as working 
drawings
Area-system 
Matrix 
After designing the routing of systems, the area system matrix 
can be published. It defines the areas where different system 
pipes, etc., pass. Using this matrix makes it easier to identify 
the key points of commissioning and helps to concentrate on 
essential work thus speed up the commissioning. States are In 
use and Not in use.
Opening 
Information 
It is efficient to make the holes and openings needed for 
penetrations, doors, windows, etc. during the plate 
preparation phase in steel production. Information about 
openings and penetrations to hull design is needed at an early 
stage and needs a dedicated process that takes care of 
scheduling of the design and communicating the information 
on hull design. States are Known process in use and  Known 
process not in use

62 
The sub-model hull includes 6 nodes. See Figure 21 below. 
Figure 21. Hull network for the model. 
The variables chosen for hull phase have either a direct or an indirect impact 
on production efficiency. See Table 4 below. 
Table 4. Hull variables for the sub-model. 
Hull detailed 
design 
Hull workshop drawings are based on the classification design, 
various calculations, and standards. The information from 
outfitting in the form of area layout and openings is also the 
starting information. The more possible it is to use standard 
structures in hull design the more efficiency can be achieved. 
States are Standard solutions in use and Standard solutions 
not in use. 
Hull 
Competence 
A level of know-how is needed for successful execution of 
welding. The competence of welders has direct impact on 
productivity. States are High and Low. 
Inspection Plan
When the plan of inspections for securing the correct quality is 
a normal part of the production process, it can be taken into 
account when creating the production schedule. It also makes 
it possible to start corrective actions early enough when 
defects do occur. The earlier the corrections are competed, the 
more effective it will be when targeting agreed upon building 
accuracy. States are Integrated to production schedule and 
Not integrated to production schedule. 
Hull Building
The better the building accuracy is during the steel work 
process, the more effective will be the hull assembly. If the 
accuracy is not good, a lot of fitting work will be needed in the 
grand block assembly and hull assembly phases. This need has 
a direct impact on effectivity and also causes delays in the 
schedule. States are High amount of fitting work in hull 
assembly and Low amount of fitting work in hull assembly. 

63 
Hull Progress 
Preconditions 
When the conditions for hull work exist, there is also better 
production effectivity. Having working drawings, materials, 
and work procedures in place is just a matter of competence to 
achieve productivity. Here motivation is seen as a driver. If the 
budget enables a realistic target for teams and there are 
possibilities for a supporting salary system, productivity can 
increase. States are Good and Poor. 
Hull Progress
When the work is done according to the assigned schedule 
with adequate resources, there is better efficiency than having 
delays and struggling with catch-up plans. Keeping to the 
schedule also makes it possible to stay within budget. States 
are In schedule and in the budget and Delays and/or budget 
overruns
The sub-model outfitting has 10 nodes. See Figure 22 below. 
Figure 22. Outfitting network for the model. 
The variables chosen for outfitting phase have either a direct or an 
indirect impact on production efficiency. See Table 5. 
Table 5. Outfitting variables for the sub-model. 
Cable Pulling
If pulling of the cables is not done according to 
schedule, it will cause a delay for later phases making 
it very difficult to catch up. Especially, the main 
cables play an important role in keeping to the critical 
path. Interior work is dependent on cable work and 
also the commissioning. The better the accuracy of 
keeping the schedule the better will be the 

64 
productivity.  States are Scheduled to production 
schedule as preconditions for area work and Not 
scheduled to production schedule as preconditions 
for area work.
Area Outfitting  
Area-based outfitting is a work entity. If hull work 
and block outfitting is proceeding according to 
schedule, main cable pulling is done according to the 
schedule, job orders define the short term work, 
resources are available, and the necessary 
coordination is available, so effectivity improves. If 
inspections have been planned to be part of the work 
they do not cause surprises. States are Outfitting is 
done in a correct order and Outfitting is not done in a 
correct order.
Area Outfitting Plan 
If area outfitting has a realistic schedule with correct 
dependencies on the commissioning and the 
prerequisites have been identified and taken into 
account in their respective schedules, it is possible to 
plan the work in the area effectively (the design 
documentation exists, delivery control makes correct 
material deliveries etc. ). States are Comprehensive 
and Limited.
Delivery Control
Control all purchasing contracts, including material, 
work, and turnkey, whether there are regular follow-
up and catch-up activities for keeping to the schedule. 
Lack of material causes ineffectiveness. States are 
Deliveries on time and Delays in deliveries.
Outfitting Competence
The level of know-how needed for execution of 
outfitting. In outfitting the possibility to train multi-
talented outfitters would increase effectivity. States 
are High and Low.
Outfitting Inspections
Plan for inspections produce the correct quality. 
Because inspections are an essential part of the 
process, the time needed for them and any possible 
repair work must be taken into account when making 
the schedule. States are Integrated to production 
schedule and Not integrated to production schedule.
Responsibilities/Scopes
The work is efficient when everybody knows their
jobs and roles are clear. Due to the large amount of 
different parties building in the areas and the impacts 
from outside the area, it is most important to have 
good coordination in the work place. The main 

65 
responsibilities should follow the WBS and the 
division of responsibilities regarding discipline. This 
is also the basis for target setting for time and cost. 
WBS target setting against a budget produces 
concrete goals and improves effectivity. States are 
WBS-based target setting and Not WBS-based target 
setting.
System Outfitting
If systems are built as a work entity, it becomes more 
effective to build and control, as the technical details 
remain the same no matter in which area. Also, there 
are better prerequisites for commissioning, as status 
follow-up is clear. States are System is built ship-wide 
by a single team and System is not built ship-wide by 
a single team.
Outfitting Progress
Actual readiness of outfitting work. For keeping 
efficiency high in the planned level, one should be 
aware all the time of actual progress and the cost 
status. Then it is possible to react quickly and repair 
any situation. If the work is delayed and there has to 
be a special task to catch up to the schedule, it creates 
inefficiency. Also if the budget has overruns, it is not 
possible to use resources as one should and that leads 
to even more inefficiency. States are In schedule and 
in budget and Delays and budget overruns.
Outfitting Progress 
Preconditions 
When the conditions for outfitting work exist, there is 
better production effectivity. Having working 
drawings, materials and work procedures in place is 
just a matter of competence to reach productivity. 
Here motivation can be seen as a driver. If the budget 
enables a realistic target for teams, and there are 
possibilities to have a supporting salary system, 
productivity can increase. States are Good and Poor. 

66 
The sub-model commissioning includes 6 nodes. See Figure 23 below.  
Figure 23. Commissioning. 
The variables chosen for commissioning phase have either a direct or an 
indirect impact on production efficiency. See Table 6. 
Table 6. Commissioning variables for sub-model. 
Commissioning
If the commissioning is planned according to WBS, the 
tests can be done in right order. Commissioning should be 
the driver when creating the production schedule. The more 
deeply the commissioning affects to building schedule, the 
more effective will be the process. States are Based on WBS 
and Not based on WBS.  
System Suppliers

The better the supplier’s scope responds to the 
commissioning plan the more effective will be the work. 
States are Based on WBS and Not based on WBS.

Low. 
Commissioning 
Progress 
Preconditions

achieved which ensures the effectivity. States are Good and 
Poor. 

67 
The main model has 27 nodes.  See Figure 17. The main model includes 
the variables related mainly to planning and overall co-ordinating. The

by one team is more efficient than that made by several 
teams. States are In use and Not in use. 
Area Division
Area division defines the borders of the functional areas on 
ship decks that are controllable entities for design, 
purchasing, installation, and inspections. It defines the 
borders of outfitting work entities for WBS. If the areas are 
functional entities, then the work can be more effective. 
States are High functionality and Low functionality. 

68 
Main Schedule 
with Main 
Milestones 
Main schedule defines the 6-10 main milestones (start of 
the basic design, start of the detail design, start of 
production…) which form the basis for the ship schedule. 
Main schedule defines timing of the basic and detail design, 
the start of production, keel laying, launching, other main 
milestones and delivery. If based on correct statistics the 
schedule will be correct and enables effectivity. States are 
Based on correct statistics and Not based on correct 
statistics.

extensively outfitted before being taken inside the vessel. 
States are Major and Minor. 
Grand Block 
Division 
Grand block division defines the borders of the grand blocks 
of the steel hull, which are the controlling entities for the 
detail design, manufacturing, and block outfitting. Defines 
the borders of the steel blocks according to WBS. The better 
the borders comply with the area division, the more 
effective is the work. States are High compatibility and Low 
compatibility. 
Block Division
Block division defines the borders of the blocks of the steel 
hull, which are the controlling entities for detail design,

and purchasing. Timing of work activities is based on WBS. 
The better the awareness of the actual status, the better is 
the possibility to react to delays and keep effectiveness. 
States are Good schedule control and Poor schedule control. 
Load Analysis and 
Resource Plan 
Load analysis and the resource plan indicate the need for
resources and subcontracting based on the work budget. 
High subcontracting here means that the resources needed 
for the project are allocated to project based on plan, not so, 
that resources are common to all projects. States are High 
need of subcontracting with an accurate plan and Low need 
of subcontracting.  
Change 
Management 
Change management is a procedure that defines how any 
change is documented, put into the workflow and followed 

69 
up on. The better the process, the more effective is the work.

By reporting the readiness of work, the awareness of the 
situation is adopted and known, and it is possible to react to 
delays and secure effectivity. States are Regular follow-up 
and possibility to catch up and Irregular follow up. 
Ship Progress 
Preconditions
These preconditions create the possibility to work according 
to the schedule. States are Good and Poor. 

70 
Ship Progress
Ship progress describes the total readiness of the ship 
project. Working according to schedule is always more 
effective than working via catch-up plans and special 
actions. States are In schedule and in budget and Delays 
and budget overruns.  
Target Setting and 
Bonus System 
When targets and bonus systems are connected to the 
project result, they create motivation which creates 
effectivity. States are Connected to the project result and 
Not Connected to the project result  
Meetings and 
Reporting 
Hierarchy 
If the meeting calendar that is connected to the reporting 
hierarchy in line and in project is complicated, the most 
important issues can get lost and thus hurt effectivity when 
not reacted to early enough. States are High complexity and 
Low complexity. 
Problem-solving 
and Decision 
making 
When problems and decisions related to project target 
achieving are identified and taken care of,  productivity is 
better than when not identifying them or making these 
decisions. States are Project target oriented and Not target 
oriented. 
Ship Delivery
When the ship is delivered and all costs are closed, the 
result of the process can be seen. States are Targeted 
production efficiency achieved and Targeted production 
efficiency not achieved. 

71 
The decision variable 
The decision variable Organization Type/'organization type' has three states; 
Project Organization, Line Organization, and Hybrid Organization. The 
decision variable has an effect on the model in change management, area 
division, the commissioning plan, meeting and reporting, target setting, load 
analysis and resource plan, the budget, problem solving, status reporting, 
turnkey entities, and responsibilities and scopes. 
3.3 The Model Operation 
After the variables and their dependencies have been defined, they are saved 
into the system which in this study was GeNIe.  After that, each expert made the 
elicitations individually with the software by estimating conditional 
probabilities of the variables. Based on these elicitations, the software calculates 
the achievance probability by organization type based on the structure of the 
model (reference to the formulas (1) and (2)). Figure 24 shows the results of 
experts based on the calculations. 

72

C

73 
After that the expert models are combined into one linear opinion pool model. 
This was done by BN expert. From this combined model the final results can be 
achieved.  
An example from the combined model with the detailed values of expert 
elicitations can be seen in the Table 8a and Table 8b. The values concern 
variable Area outfitting plan and the example also shows the condition levels 
related to this variable. The more parents the variable has, the more complicated 
the elicitation is.  
Table 8a. An example of expert elicitations to variable “Area outfitting plan”. 

74 
Table 8b. An example of expert elicitations. 
3.4 The results  
The cruise shipbuilding process is complicated, and the modeling of that process 
has not been done before in this specific way. Thus, the actual modeling itself is 
a result here (Hellgren et al., 2016). It enables future development of the process 
in several ways. In this study, production efficiency was the viewpoint used for 
choosing the variables, and the decision variable was the organizing type. 
However, the model can also be built by using other viewpoints and different 
decision variables.  
Table 9 present the probability that the targeted production efficiency can be 
reached based on the linear opinion pool model. It can be seen here that Project 
Organization has the highest probability of 0.65 and it is followed by the other 
two organization types, namely, the Hybrid Organization reached the second 

75 
highest score with probability of 0.63 and the Line Organization achieved the 
lowest score with the probability of 0.60. 
Table 9. Achievance probabilities of the decision variables in the model.

The results by each Expert can be seen in Table 10. Figure 25 is indicating the 
level that each expert was using in their elicitation.  
Table 10. Achievance probabilities by the Experts and the combined value. 
Figure 25. Achievance probabilities by the Experts and combined value. 
In order to understand what is the range where the values of the probabilities 
can vary by each Expert the model can be elicited by extremely optimistic expert 
and extremely pessimistic expert. For optimistic expert all the variables affected 
by organization type get values 1/0 and for pessimistic expert the values are 0/1 
depending on the variable. This gives the maximum values for each expert that 
can be seen in Table 11.  The Figure 26 illustrates these values.

Table 11. The optimistic, pessimistic and actual values from elicitation. 
Figure 26. The ranges of elicitations 
In this model, the organization type directly affects the model in change 
management, commissioning plan, problem-solving and decision making, area 
division, meeting and reporting hierarchy, target setting, load analysis and 
resource plan, budget, status reporting, and also turnkey entities, and 
responsibilities and scopes. According to the elicitations offered by Experts A, 
B, and C, the magnitude of these probabilistic effects are presented in Figures 
27 to 36. The Figures indicate the results of the expert values for the variables 
that organization type directly affects. Figure 26 shows that Expert A probability 
for the Known process for change management is in use in Project Organization 
is 0.81. Next is Hybrid Organization with the value of 0.64 and third is Line 
Organization with the value of 0.59. All experts share the same trend with 
different values. The same trend can be seen in Figure 27 for probability for 
integrating commissioning plan to production schedule. Further, Figure 28 
shows same trend where experts see that Project Organization includes the best 
probability for Project target oriented problem-solving and Decision-making.  
The same amount of order can be seen in Figure 29 for area division 
functionality, in Figure 30 for low complicity in meetings and reporting

experts shared the same opinion trend in probabilities except for Figure 33 for 
a variable Budget, Figure 35 for variable TK entities and scopes and Figure 36 
for variable for Responsibilities/ scopes, where Expert C preferred Hybrid 
Organization. This view is based on some projects where budget keeping was 
successful and where the responsibilities were clearly divided between the line 
and the project. Expert C also felt that Hybrid Organization will lead to the best 
functionality for TK entities and scopes as well.

When the organization type is altered, the probabilities of the variables change. 
The biggest changes between different organization types are presented in Table 
12, which shows that when changing from Project Organization to Hybrid, the 
biggest decrease in probability is related to the variable “load analysis”. When 
comparing Hybrid to Line Organization, the biggest decrease is found in the 
probability of “problem-solving and decision-making”. Further, when 
comparing Project Organization to Line Organization, the biggest decrease 
occurs in “problem-solving”.  
Table 12. Change of probabilities of the variables when the organization type is  
                   altered. 
In the main model the organization type directly affects the model in change 
management, commissioning plan, problem-solving, area division, meeting and 
reporting hierarchy, target setting, load analysis and resource plan, status 
reporting. See the Figure 37. According to Table 12 the biggest changes of 
probabilities of the variables when altering the organization type from Project 
Organization to Line Organization are:

                       model and the variables that are affected most when changing  
                       organization type. 
The model shows the range of probabilities for every variable within all the 
respective conditions. As an example, the ranges of probabilities of variables by 
Experts A, B and C in the sub-model Basic design can be seen in Table 13.   

83 
Table 13. Conditional probabilities in Basic design by experts. 
The variables Owner and Calculations have no parents, which is why there is 
only one probability value by each expert. The other variables have one or more 
parents, which creates the conditional situations that the experts judged during 
the elicitations. For example, for the variable TK entities and scopes the 
probability of having functional entities based on WBS will vary according to 
Expert A from 0.28 to 0.8, depending on the conditions that resulted from the 
parents. The probability of 0.28 describes the conditions as seen in Figure 38, 
while the probability of 0.8 results from the conditions seen in Figure 39.

By using the model, it is possible to clarify which conditions each expert uses to 
reach the best probabilities for each variable. In the Basic design sub-model, 
these conditions can be seen in Table 14.  There in architectural design Experts 
A and B have similar conditions stating Known process for change work flows 
and responsibilities, basic design schedule based on need of information, 
Specification with high clarity and owners low activity. In arrangement design, 
Expert B and C share a similar view that functional area division, a major 
module plan, easy GA, scheduling of design process and production friendliness 
lead to easy arrangements. For classification design, all experts share a similar 
view according to which mid ship section low complexity, basic design schedule 
is based on the need for information, high reliability calculations and whole 
process scheduled in basic design schedule lead to high recurrence in the 
structures. For variable Purchasing contracts & Material scope, all experts have 
a similar opinion. According to that opinion, a Purchasing schedule that is based 
on WBS and the need of information, a major module plan, and TK Functional 
entities and based on work breakdown structure   lead to Independent entities 
with progress-related payment terms. There are differences in the TK entities 
and scope where Experts A and B see that functional WBS-based TK entities are 
the result when Project Organization is the organization type, whereas Expert C 
prefers a Hybrid Organization. Variables that also have an output on this sub-
model are shown in Table 14. They act as inputs and conditions for the variables 
where they are connected to.

3.5 Assessment of Sensitivity, Uncertainty, and Bias 
The results of the sensitivity analysis of the networks done by GeNIe is 
presented in Appendix 3. 
The GeNIe analysis tool helps in identifying the most influential parameters. To 
perform sensitivity analysis, an additional indexing variable will index various 
values for parameters in question and have GeNIe compute the impact of these 
values on the results. Based on that, the most influential node is Ship delivery, 
which is highlighted in red to indicate its high influence. Light red indicates a 
moderate influence, and those nodes are Status reporting, Ship progress, 
Commissioning plan, Control points, Target setting and Bonus system, 
Meetings and Reporting hierarchy, Problem- solving and Decision-making, and 
Commissioning. For an evaluation of uncertainty and bias, a method presented 
by Goerlandt and Reiniers (2015) is utilized. The box plots are exploratory 
graphics for showing the distribution of a variable. The needed definition of 
scores is shown in Table 15. A Summary of Uncertainties and Bias for the most 
sensitive variables is shown in Table 16.

4.  Discussion  
4.1 The results in light of state of the art  
The research on the cruise ship building process has resulted in broader 
knowledge about production efficiency as well as better working methods, 
including efficient welding techniques, increased welding automation, and the 
extended use of modularization and block outfitting (Erikstad, 2009; Greve, 
2007; Roland et al., 2004; Koenig et al., 2002; Park et al., 2011). Additionally, 
the research on three-dimensional design systems and other integrated IT tools 
has allowed cruise ship design to become a fully three-dimensional model, (Liu 
et al., 2011; Cho et al., 1998). Further, simulation models have been developed 
for the shipbuilding process. McLean and Shao (2001) offered an overview of a 
generic simulation of shipbuilding operations and Krause et al. (2004) 
presented a discrete event simulation for testing and evaluating the different 
scenarios of investment planning, scheduling, and resource planning. 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems have also been developed (Krause 
et al., 2004; Tu, 1997; McLean &Shao, 2001). Production efficiency and lean 
manufacturing have been studied by Koliü et al. (2016) Erdem (2015) and the 
organizational features related to on-job-learning by Meyer (2010). However, 
research about the entire process effectiveness and cruise ship building process 
control still remains absent, and there is no available research information on 
how organizing the cruise shipbuilding process can affect production efficiency. 
This thesis studies the effectivity of the whole process of building a cruise ship. 
The different organization types have been researched in general. The 
measuring of organizational effectiveness, according to Robbins (1983), has 
proven to be a difficult aspect to define. Aurélio de Oliveira et al. (2012) analyzed 
the influence of leadership style and the factors associated with organization 
agility on project performance. Hobday (2000) compared the effectiveness of 
producing complex high value products in a project-based organization to a 
more traditionally functioning matrix organization. However, the effect of 
organization type in shipbuilding as it relates to production efficiency has not 
yet been studied. This study offers a tool and a new way of focusing on the 

89 
management of the process by comparing different organization methods when 
a large shipbuilding project is involved. 
4.2 Answering the research question and discussion 
It can be inferred from the model that the highest probability for achieving the 
intended production efficiency is reached by using Project Organization. The 
second best probability for the desired outcome is by using Hybrid 
Organization, and the third is by using the Line Organization type. As seen in 
Table 9, the differences between the probabilities for these organization types 
are not large, namely as they vary between 0.02- 0.05, but they do show a trend 
which organization type could be the most beneficial. Albeit the differences may 
seem marginal at first, but as we are studying processes with high economic 
values and long lead times, even the smallest of changes can translate into big 
benefits or losses. When studying the effect of the organizing method on the 
different variables, the expert elicitations show a parallel trend, with Project 
Organization being the best option of the variables according to all three 
experts.  
Generally, the results of this study indicate that the best probability was 
achieved with Project Organization and the lowest probability was with Line 
Organization. All probabilities were between 0.60 and 0.65. However, even the 
probability level of 0.65 is low. What this means for the actual process, is that 
there is a lot of potential for improvement to achieve a probability that will be 
more satisfactory. The process is complicated, and even small problems can 
cause consequences that lead to unexpected inefficiency. Yet based on this 
study, it is quite evident that by improving the organization method, it is also 
possible to improve overall efficiency in the cruise shipbuilding process. 
When comparing the organization types with each other, it can be seen which 
probabilities of the variables change the most, as illustrated in Table 10.  When 
comparing Project Organization to Hybrid Organization, the biggest decrease in 
probability is related to the variable “load analysis”. This can be the consequence 
of allocating of resources on coarse level. In Project Organization the project 
defines the need of resources, in Hybrid Organization the defining process is 
done partly on departmental level.  When comparing Hybrid to Line 
Organization, the biggest decrease is found in the probability of “problem-
solving and decision-making”. This refers to responsibilities and goal 
orientation which in Hybrid Organization are more project related than in Line 

90 
Organization. Further, when comparing Project Organization to Line 
Organization, the biggest decrease occurs in “problem-solving and decision 
making”.  This is also a matter of goal orientation which in Project Organization 
affects efficient problem-solving more than in Line Organization. 
The range of probabilities in Table 11 describes the probabilities for different 
conditions of the sub-model Basic design.  It can be seen that there are 
differences between the experts’ elicitations. In most cases, Expert B has the 
highest values for the probabilities. Expert C has the lowest probabilities, and 
Expert A stands in between the two. The experts use ranges in different 
positions on the scale. This shows differences in judgment. 
Based on these results it seems that the Project Organization helps production 
efficiency by organizing change management, including a commissioning plan 
as part of the production schedule, by  project-target-oriented problem-solving 
and decision-making, by functional area division, by structured meetings and 
reporting hierarchy, target setting and a bonus system related to project results, 
as well as by more accurate resource planning, by realistic budget target, and by 
using regular status reporting as well as functional turnkey entities. 
The reason for the best values being in Project Organization can be that when 
Project Organization is used, responsibilities are clear (Robbins, 1983). Further, 
Project Organization creates the need to have all planning-related activities as 
WBS-based, including functional area divisions and turnkey entities, 
production schedules, commissioning and resource planning. It is also seen in 
the results of variable Area division. This choice makes it easier to state target 
setting accordingly in Project Organization. When responsibilities and target 
setting using a bonus system do comply, then problem-solving and decision-
making will have a common target. Even if the differences between organization 
type probabilities were not significant, however, the results from Project 
Organization can help to develop and direct the process towards a direction 
where especially clear responsibilities make it possibly to improve overall 
production efficiency. 
Furthermore, handling of changes in the cruise shipbuilding process is easier 
with Project Organization because the responsibilities are clear, and the 
consequences of changes are easier to see and also forecast. In change 
management process it is vital that responsibilities for the workflow are clear. 
In Project Organization the tasks and responsibilities are transparent which 
support efficiency. Reporting and meeting routines can comply with these 
responsibilities to create the need for regular status reporting. The comparison 
between Project Organization and Line Organization in table 10 shows that the 

91 
biggest differences in the probabilities occur for problem-solving and decision-
making, target setting and the bonus system, meetings and reporting hierarchy, 
and also load analysis and status reporting. This means that for Project 
Organization, these variables have a better probability of achieving the targeted 
efficiency. A common factor behind these results can also be clearer 
responsibilities. When someone is clearly responsible for a target, where a 
bonus is also possible, it is evident this the person will want to solve the 
problems, make decisions, clarify the need for resources, and continually 
inquire about the actual status of the planned target. To include commission 
plan to production schedule is more probable in Project Organization cases, 
most evidently due to the project deadline which demands the move from 
production to commissioning in a seamless way. 
The modeling of the process was done by taking into account that the cruise 
ships are built as a joint effort between the shipyard and the supplier network.  
As a logical result, the model includes factors that impact production efficiency 
no matter whether the activity is done by the shipyard or a network member. 
This kind of model, which combines various players into a single model, is new. 
The development process together with network specialists during the first 
phases of design has been recognized in this model. During the first steps of the 
process, most of the costs are locked and that is why it is important to know the 
factors and dependencies starting from the beginning. 
This model presents production efficiency factors that are not production-
related factors, such as production facilities, methods, and tools. It can be seen 
in the model that there are many other factors than these production-related 
items that can impact to production efficiency. Using this model, those factors 
can be identified more clearly and their impacts can be studied in a new way. As 
noted earlier, ship building process has been simulated in many studies and 
applications. However, those actions that are based on human behavior always 
include uncertainty and thus the simulations are not precise enough. The 
Bayesian model also addresses the human factor and its uncertainties in this 
process, which in fact means the management view of the process. This made it 
possible to study the effect of organization type to production efficiency. This is 
a new aspect of modelling the process. 
As said earlier, one typical feature of cruise ship contracts is that in the ship 
contract the shipyard commits to design and build the specified vessel within a 
certain deadline and for an agreed price. The model demonstrates that many 
factors during the first phases of the process are prohibiting the shipyard from 
proceeding fluently when fulfilling these obligations. If the shipyard has 

92 
extremely strict control of all factors, however, it can succeed. Yet, as seen in the 
model, there are many aspects and details that are not supporting the shipyard’s 
progress, which raises up the question of whether it is possible to divide a ship 
contract into a design part and a production part. This arrangement could also 
benefit the ship owner. 
Bayesian Networks have been successfully used in many studies related to 
marine safety (Uusitalo, 2007; Quintana & Leung, 2012; Montewka et al., 2013; 
Hänninen et al., 2014). These studies gave the motivation to use BN in this 
research. The use of a Bayesian Network as a modeling approach in this study 
turned out to be feasible, and its use appropriately supported problem 
processing. The model is not a process description of the cruise shipbuilding 
process, but rather a combined model of the factors that do influence production 
efficiency throughout the entire process. Using the decision variable makes it 
possible to investigate how different organization approaches resulted in the 
probability of achievement. BN is flexible and a visual tool in this respect and 
indeed, it is well suited to this particular study. However, the reporting 
possibilities and features in the software could be better for enabling smooth 
analyzing work. 
The structure of the model included numerous variables and dependencies. 
The decision to divide the main model into six sub models, according to the 
cruise shipbuilding process did help to clarify the entity of the model. The built 
model consisted of 85+1 variables. By reducing the number of variables, the 
elicitations themselves could offer a simpler representation but at the same 
time, some of the important variables would be lost and the total result would 
not be as comprehensive. Due to the high number of variables, only two states 
were allowed for each variable. This made the elicitations more reliable by 
keeping the number of options on a reasonable level.  
Due to the challenging characteristics of this process, the required 
qualifications of the experts included wide experience and knowledge of the 
process itself, accumulated over a long time while working in various 
organization structures. In this case, all the experts fulfilled the qualifications, 
meaning that they knew the background of the process. As the variables and 
dependencies were already familiar to the experts, there was no need to explain 
the meaning of the model elements, which enabled better concentration on the 
probabilities. The elicitation work was demanding. If there were several 
condition levels the situation of elicitation would demand extreme 
concentration and accuracy to maintain the logic. Increasing the amount of 
elicitations by adding several experts would naturally broaden the perspective, 

93 
but it would be necessary these persons are qualified enough to properly render 
a judgment.  
The study was done based on one shipyard only because the information 
needed for this kind of study is extremely broad, and therefore expanding the 
study to compare different shipyards was not feasible for the purpose of this 
study. 
4.3 Reliability and Validity of the model 
Validation framework 
This study using the Bayesian Network for the cruise shipbuilding process led 
to a constructive perspective using the basis of epistemology constructivism. 
This means that when creating the validation framework for the study, it was 
necessary to provide arguments for why the interpretation would be trustworthy 
as a basis for decision-making. Also, it was necessary to think about the precise 
features that would make the assessment credible and identify uncertainties and 
the biases. Pitchforth & Mengersen  (2013) present the framework for that 
validation (see Figure 40). 
Figure 40. The validity testing framework. 
Face validity 
For the face validity, the test checked to see whether the model structure 
(number of nodes, node labels and arcs between them) look the same as the 
experts and/or literature predicted. Face validity is also checked to see that each 

94 
node of the network is discretized into sets that reflect expert knowledge. 
Further, the parameters of each node are checked to see if the parameters of 
each node are similar to what the experts expected.  
Before eliciting the model content itself, including nodes, their parameters 
and discretizing were discussed with the experts. The experts agreed that the 
model responded to the actual process. In the literature there are no similar 
cases from shipbuilding for a comparison, but in principle this model looks 
generally the same as the existing models. 
Content validity 
In content, validity is checked for whether the model structure contains all and 
only those factors and relationships relevant to the model output. Another check 
done for whether each node of the network contains all and only the relevant 
states that a node can possibly adopt and whether the discrete states of the 
nodes are dimensionally consistent.  
The model includes the main factors according to current knowledge of the 
shipyard’s cruise shipbuilding process that impacts production efficiency. The 
content validity process should be reviewed for both project management and 
production efficiency. The main areas in project management generally are 
control of schedule, costs, and performance. All of these are represented as 
various nodes here in the constructed model. Concerning the main 
preconditions for improved production efficiency, the impact of production 
facilities, methods, and tools were not included in the current study. Thus, the 
availability of production documents, materials, and resources at the right time 
remain. Without them, the most efficient production is not possible. Those 
elements are, however, widely represented as respective variables in the model. 
Because of the complexity of the model it was decided to have only two states 
for each node. These states were chosen so that they reflected the extreme ends 
of the states. This aspect was agreed upon with experts. The states were specified 
for each node, bearing in mind actual production efficiency.   
Concurrent Validity 
For concurrent validity, the check is done to see if the model acts identically to 
network, models a theoretically related construct, and if the parameters of the 
input nodes match the nodes in a comparative model. Compared to models 
related to marine safety, as mentioned earlier in this study, the model seems to 
act in the same way. But because there is no similar model available it is difficult 
to say precisely.

4.4 Examples of other possible applications of the model 
It is possible to use this model to study other topics as well. One interesting topic 
could be how project organization that is strictly connected to WBS would 
improve the probability of achieving the targeted production efficiency.  
Minimizing lead time could be another topic. However, it would require its own 
respective variables and dependencies. 
Further, studying whether the existing model could work the other way round 
to indicate necessary preconditions for settled targets would be interesting and 
even beneficial, as would investigating how much improving some factors might 
improve the end result. For example, if the probabilities of variable or variables 
would be improved with 20%, how much that improvement affect the end 
result? This can be studied with the model by improving, e.g., Expert A values 
for commissioning plan, commissioning and control points with 20 %. In the 
model this change gives about 4-5% better end result depending on the 
organization type. This way the model can provide information on how to 
control and manage the whole shipbuilding process to maximize production 
efficiency by making it possible to investigate optimal procedures for the future. 
The model is new in this context. However, the basic concept of the model is a 
general one. This aspect makes the idea of the model possible for use in other 
industries than shipbuilding. 

96 
5. Conclusions 
The impact of organizing the cruise shipbuilding process for its productivity has 
not been researched much. Thus, this thesis offers a new view on this topic 
(Hellgren et al., 2016). In this thesis, the cruise shipbuilding process was 
modelled in relation to production efficiency and that model was used to analyze 
the effect of organization type on production efficiency. The impact of 
organizing the shipbuilding process for production efficiency was modeled to 
compare the probabilities for three organizing methods. Based on the model 
presented here, it is clear that the organizing method does indeed impact 
production efficiency. Although that impact might not seem considerable at first 
glance, it illustrates a clear trend. The goal of the thesis was to clarify whether 
organization structure has an impact on production efficiency. The goal was 
reached. The highest probability of achieving an intended production efficiency 
is reached when using Project Organization. The second best probability is when 
using Hybrid Organization, and the third is when using Line Organization. The 
differences in these probabilities show the direction of thinking for how 
organizing methodology should be developed in the future when increased 
production efficiency is requisitioned. Project organization helps with project 
target oriented problem-solving and decision-making, target setting, and a 
bonus system related to project result, clarity in meetings and the reporting 
hierarchy,  more accurate resource planning, functional area division, and use 
of regular status reporting. That is why these factors are important and they 
should be put much attention to in cruise shipbuilding process. The study on 
the effects of different organization methods is part of the discussion of 
organizations and their uses in different processes. The benefits of Project 
Organization is also noted by Hobday (2000). The model also shows how 
individual factors in the process act within different organization types. This 
result is useful when considering future organization types to develop the best 
cruise shipbuilding process. Further, it shows that even in a complicated 

97 
process, it is possible to discover factors of improvement that will indeed affect 
overall production efficiency. The model with its elicitations helps to 
understand how the process has worked in the past, but it also makes it possible 
to investigate optimal procedures for the future. 
The main limitations of the work are that the study was done in one shipyard 
only because the information needed for this kind of study is very broad and not 
generally available. Also the number of experts is limited, but herein the 
demanded qualifications for experts were special including long working period 
in the same shipyard in the different parts of the process and for that reason 
they were difficult to find. 
The modelling of the cruise shipbuilding process related to production 
efficiency is a new study on applying Bayesian Networks. BN has been used in 
various studies as stated in Section 2.4 of this thesis. The basic idea and network 
structures are largely the same. However, raising a feature of the process as the 
main idea of the model and studying it for organization type is a different focus. 
Bayesian Network enables one to model a building process in a new way by 
understanding the complicity of the process and how it is possible to research it 
through the use of dependencies.  
In the thesis the cruise ship building process has been modelled for the first 
time as an entire process. The model is now available for further development 
and the results of the impact of organization structure can now be used as a basis 
for decision making in shipyards. 
In the future the model could provide information on how to control and 
manage the whole shipbuilding process in order to maximize production 
efficiency. Also, in shipyards the model can be used together with data mining 
and combine the benchmarking methods discussed in Section 2.  Another topic 
could be how a project organization, strictly connected to WBS, would improve 
the probability of achieving the targeted production efficiency. Also the study of 
minimizing lead times could be one interesting topic. To study whether the 
model could work the other way round indicating necessary preconditions for 
settled targets would be interesting and beneficial. Further, the modelling was 
based on a one project-at-a time focus. It would be useful to study the impact of 
a multi-project environment and compare those results to this study. The model 
is new in this context, but the basic concept of the ship building process is a 
general one. This can make it possible in the future to compare shipyards with 
different organizational structures as well as doing an analysis of the 
consequences of reorganizing from one organization type to another in different 
shipyards. This model can be used in the future to also study other factors than 

98 
organization structure with production efficiency in the cruise ship building 
process.
The study was based on the process of one shipyard and its experiences over 
the course of 30 years. Every shipyard has its own processes and ways of 
working, but the main process for building cruise ships at a high level is largely 
the same. Thus, the results of this study can be used in most shipyards to target 
better production efficiency. Hopefully this study will also encourage even 
further research on the topic itself.
