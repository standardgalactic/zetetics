Introduction
Open Source Intelligence Methods and Tools focuses on building a deep understanding 
of how to exploit open source intelligence (OSINT) techniques, methods, and tools 
to acquire information from publicly available online sources to support intelligence 
analysis. The harvested data can be used in different scenarios such as financial, crime, 
and terrorism investigations as well as in more regular tasks such as analyzing business 
competitors, running background checks, and acquiring intelligence about individuals 
and other entities. This book will also improve your skills in acquiring information 
online from the surface web, the deep web, and the darknet.
Many estimates show that 90 percent of useful information acquired by intelligence 
services comes from public sources (in other words, OSINT sources). Social media sites 
open up numerous opportunities for investigations because of the vast amount of useful 
information located in one place. For example, you can get a great deal of personal 
information about any person worldwide by just checking their Facebook page. This book 
will show you how to conduct advanced social media investigations to access content 
believed to be private, use advanced search engines queries to return accurate results, 
search historical deleted versions of websites, track individuals online using public record 
databases and people-searching tools, locate information buried in the deep web, access 
and navigate the dark web, collect intelligence from the dark web, view multiple historic 
satellite images and street views of any location, search geolocation information within 
popular social media sites, and more. In short, you will learn how to use a plethora of 
techniques, tools, and free online services to gather intelligence about any target online.
OSINT-gathering activities should be conducted secretly to avoid revealing the 
searcher’s identity. Therefore, this book will teach you how to conceal your digital 
identity and become anonymous online. You will learn how to exchange data secretly 
across hostile environments like the Internet and how to communicate with your peers 
privately and anonymously. You will also learn how to check your digital footprint and 
discover what kind of digital traces you are leaving behind and how to delete them.

xx
Open Source Intelligence Methods and Tools is an indispensable guide for anyone 
responsible for collecting online content from public data, and it is a must-have 
reference for any casual Internet user who wants to dig deeper into the Internet to see 
what information it contains.
Target Audience

What the Book Is Not
This book is not about the history of open source intelligence, and it does not discuss at 
length the legal issues of personal reconnaissance online. We will not talk about policies 
and regulations that govern different countries or business organizations. Although 
some of these issues are discussed briefly in Chapter 1, the main aim of this book is to 
create a guidebook to support all types of investigations. You can read the chapters in 
any order because each chapter is considered an isolated unit that discusses the chapter 
subject’s comprehensively.

Summary of Contents
Here is a brief description of each chapter’s contents:
•	
Chapter 1, “The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence”: In this 
chapter, we introduce you to the term OSINT and explain how it has 
evolved over time. We introduce the different parties interested in 
exploiting publicly available data and the benefits gained from doing 
so. We include some technical information about online gathering 
techniques and the challenges involved, as well as the legal aspects 
when harvesting data from publicly available sources.
•	
Chapter 2, “Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures”: 
In this chapter, we teach you everything you need to know to stay 
safe when going online. This knowledge is essential when conducting 
advanced searches online to avoid being tracked since using 
advanced search operators and other OSINT search techniques 
will attract attention online and make your connection a target for 
interception by different outside parties.
•	
Chapter 3, “The Underground Internet”: This chapter is devoted to 
uncovering the secrets of the invisible web, which contains both 
the darknet and the deep web. This knowledge is essential as the 
underground net contains a wealth of valuable information that any 
cybersecurity professional should know how to access.
•	
Chapter 4, “Search Engine Techniques”: In this chapter, we show you 
how to use advanced search techniques using typical search engines 
such as Google and Bing to find anything online. We also cover other 
specialized search engines for images, video, news, web directories, 
files, and FTP.
•	
Chapter 5, “Social Media Intelligence”: In this chapter, we show you 
how to use a wide array of tools and techniques to gather intelligence 
about a specific person or entity from social media sites. For instance, 
using Facebook you can gather intelligence about people worldwide. 
Other major tech companies like Google and Microsoft own huge 
databases of information about their users. A great amount of 
information is published publicly on these sites, and this chapter 
Introduction

xxii
teaches you how to search for people, including their relationships, 
names, addresses, and communications (and interactions) with others 
on social sites, to formulate a complete profile about your target.
•	
Chapter 6, “People Search Engines and Public Records”: Here we 
list specific search engines and other public resources to search 
for people’s names and get details around them. You will learn to 
use different reverse search criteria to find people online such as 
birth records, mail addresses, résumés, dating websites, e-mails, 
phone numbers, previous breached usernames, and more. We 
also cover government resources such as vital records, tax records, 
criminal information, and other public sources you can use to gain 
intelligence about people and entities.
•	
Chapter 7, “Online Maps”: This chapter covers how to use Google 
Maps and other free geolocation services to investigate the 
geolocation information acquired about target people.
•	
Chapter 8, “Technical Footprinting”: This chapter covers how to 
gather technical information about a target website and network 
system in passive mode to support your OSINT intelligence.
•	
Chapter 9, “What’s Next?”: This chapter covers the OSINT process 
and its future trends.
Book Companion Website
In this book, we list hundreds of online services that help OSINT gatherers to collect and 
analyze information. We all know about the ever-changing nature of the Web, though; 
new sites launch and others close down daily, so some links might not work by the time 
you read this. To prevent this hassle and to avoid making part of this book useless after 
publishing it, we have created a dedicated website where we offer a digital list of all the 
links mentioned in this book in addition to many more resources that just wouldn’t fit in 
the printed version. We will do our best to keep this site updated and continually work to 
add new useful OSINT content that reflects improvements in the field. Dead links will get 
deleted or updated, so the content of this book will remain current for many years to come.

CHAPTER 1
The Evolution of Open 
Source Intelligence
Since the end of the Cold War, global societies have become more open, and the 
revolution of the Internet and its widespread use have turned the world into a small 
village. Unleashing the Internet network to billions of people worldwide to communicate 
and exchange digital data has shifted the entire world into what is now an information 
age. This transformation to the digital age brought huge benefits to our society; however, 
the speed and scope of the transformation have also triggered different kinds of risks. For 
instance, cybercriminals, terrorist groups, oppressive regimes, and all kinds of malicious 
actors are using the Internet effectively to conduct their crimes. Juniper Research 
predicts that cybercrime will cost businesses more than $2 trillion by 2019,i so these 
risks encourage governments to invest in the development of open source intelligence 
(OSINT) tools and techniques to counter current and future cybersecurity challenges.
OSINT refers to all the information that is publicly available. There is no specific 
date on when the term OSINT was first proposed; however, a relative term has probably 
been used for hundreds of years to describe the act of gathering intelligence through 
exploiting publicly available resources.
The United States is still leading the world in the intelligence arena, with vast 
resources dedicated by the U.S. government to its intelligence agencies that enable it to 
build sophisticated surveillance programs to harvest and analyze a large volume of data 
covering all the major spoken languages. This makes our discussion of OSINT history 
largely dependent on U.S. history, although during the Cold War many countries also 
developed OSINT capabilities to gain intelligence. Still, no other country has reached the 
level of the U.S. programs.

The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) defines OSINT as follows:
“Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is an intelligence that is 
produced from publicly available information and is collected, 
exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate 
audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence 
requirement.”ii
In modern times, OSINT was introduced during World War II as an intelligence tool 
when the United States established the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS) to 
monitor publicly available information that related to supporting its troop operations at 
that time. This all happened before the U.S. intelligence community even existed.
After the end of World War II, the FBIS has continued its work in exploiting OSINT 
sources globally, until the September 11, 2001, terror attacks on the United States. This 
drew attention to the importance of creating an independent OSINT agency to intensify 
exploiting these resources to protect national security. This is what was suggested by the 
9/11 Commission, which called for the creation of a specialized agency for gathering 
OSINT.iii In 2005, the WMD Commission, which was formed to measure the effectiveness 
of the intelligence community to respond to threats raised by weapons of mass 
destruction (WMD) and other related threats of the 21st century, suggested the creation 
of an Open Source Directorate within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).iv
Following these recommendations and other debates, the Director of National 
Intelligence (DNI) announced the creation of the National Intelligence Open Source 
Center (OSC). The main tasks of the OSC are to collect information available from 
both online and offline public sources, which was previously done by the FBIS. Later, 
the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, which was proposed to reform 
the intelligence activities of the U.S. government, merged the FBIS and other related 
research entities into one body. This organization is now called the Open Source 
Enterprise and is managed by the CIA.
OSINT sources are distinguished from other forms of intelligence because they must 
be legally accessible by the public without breaching any copyright or privacy laws. 
That’s why they are considered “publicly available.” This distinction makes the ability 
to gather OSINT sources applicable to more than just security services. For example, 
businesses can benefit from exploiting these resources to gain intelligence about their 
competitors.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

Note!  During the search for OSINT sources, classified information that is not 
protected properly can appear. This includes leaked documents, such as those 
published by WikiLeaks. This type of information is called NOSINT, as opposed to 
OSINT. Intelligence usually considers all sources regardless of their legal accessibility.
In addition to its significant importance to the intelligence community, OSINT 
gathering is less expensive and less risky than traditional spying activites. Unlike other 
intelligence sources that may require using spy satellite images or secret agents to 
collect information, all you need to gather OSINT online resources is a computer and an 
Internet connection. And, of course, you need the required searching skills.
As technology proliferates and the volume of available data increases, government 
departments, nongovernmental organization (NGO) organizations, and business 
corporations are starting to rely to a large extent on OSINT rather than private and 
classified information. This book will teach you how to exploit OSINT sources to search 
for and gather information online. In this chapter, we will describe the term OSINT, 
discuss the types of OSIN, and talk about different parties’ benefits from using OSINT 
and their motivations, as well as trends and challenges for the future. In later chapters, 
we will cover how to use a plethora of tools and techniques to acquire data from publicly 
available sources.
Open Source Information Categories
There are different kinds of information that you may encounter when conducting 
OSINT analysis. According to the NATO Open Source Intelligence Handbook V1.2 
published in 2001, there are four categories of open information and intelligence.
•	
Open source data (OSD): This is generic data coming from a primary 
source. Examples include satellite images, telephone call data and 
metadata, datasets, survey data, photographs, and audio or video 
recordings that have recorded an event.
•	
Open source information (OSINF): This is generic data that has 
undergone some filtering first to meet a specific criterion or need; 
this data can also be called a secondary source. Examples include 
books about a specific subject, articles, dissertations, artworks, and 
interviews.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

4
Note!  The set of sources legally available to the public through specific channels 
is called gray literature. These sources include books, journals, dissertations, 
technical reports, and internal documents of commercial enterprises, commercial 
imagery, and any information that is controlled by its producer. Gray literature is a 
major element of OSINF and can be obtained legally by acquiring the permission 
of its copyright holder or by paying for it (for example, through subscriptions 
agencies, commercial bookstores, and so on).
•	
Open source intelligence (OSINT): This includes all the information 
that has been discovered, filtered, and designated to meet a specific 
need or purpose. This information can be used directly in any 
intelligence context. OSINT can be defined in a nutshell as the output 
of open source material processing.
•	
Validated OSINT (OSINT-V): This is OSINT with a high degree of 
certainty; the data should be confirmed (verified) using a non-OSINT 
source or from a highly reputable OSINT source. This is essential, as 
some outside adversaries may spread inaccurate OSINT information 
with the intent to mislead OSINT analysis. A good example of this is 
when a TV station broadcasts live the arrival of a president to another 
country; such information is OSINT, but it has a large degree of certainty.
As you saw, OSD and OSINF comprise the main sources (primary and secondary) of 
information that OSINT uses to drive its results.
Another issue you need to understand within the OSINT context is the difference 
between data, information, and knowledge. The three terms are usually used 
interchangeably; however, each one has a different meaning, although the three do 
interact with each other.
•	
Data: This is a set of facts describing something without further 
explanation or analysis. For example, “The price of gold per ounce is 
$1,212.”
•	
Information: This is a kind of data that has been interpreted properly to 
give a useful meaning within a specific context. For example, “The price 
of gold per ounce has fallen from $1,212 to $1,196 within one week.”
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

5
•	
Knowledge: This is a combination of information, experience, and 
insight that has been learned or inferred after some experimentation. 
Knowledge describes what your brain has recorded in the past, and 
these records can help you to make better decisions about the future 
when facing similar contexts. For example, “When the price of gold 
falls more than 5 percent, this means the price of oil will fall too.”
OSINT Types
OSINT includes all publicly accessible sources of information. This information can be 
found either online or offline, including in the following places:
•	
The Internet, which includes the following and more: forums, blogs, 
social networking sites, video-sharing sites like YouTube.com, wikis, 
Whois records of registered domain names, metadata and digital 
files, dark web resources, geolocation data, IP addresses, people 
search engines, and anything that can be found online
•	
Traditional mass media (e.g., television, radio, newspapers, books, 
magazines)
•	
Specialized journals, academic publications, dissertations, 
conference proceedings, company profiles, annual reports, company 
news, employee profiles, and résumés
•	
Photos and videos including metadata
•	
Geospatial information (e.g., maps and commercial imagery 
products)
Digital Data Volume
As you already saw, OSINT encompasses not only online sources. Paper editions of 
public sources must also get investigated thoroughly as part of any OSINT-gathering 
process; however, online sources comprise the largest segment of OSINT.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

6
Today we live in an information age, and publishers as well as corporations, 
universities, and other suppliers of OSINT sources are shifting their business processes 
to digital formats. The number of users on social media sites will also continue to 
increase, and the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices will intensify in the future, 
leading to a huge increase in the volume of digital data coming from the billions of 
sensors and machines worldwide. In other words, most OSINT sources in the future will 
be online sources.
Note!  Gartner estimates that 20.4 billion IoT devices will be in use by 2020.v
The volume of digital data is exploding rapidly. According to IDC Research,vi by the 
year 2020, the total amount of digital data created worldwide will reach 44 zettabytes, 
and the number will increase faster within five years to reach 180 zettabytes in 2025.
By 2020, the Gartner research group estimates that an average person will spend 
time interacting with automated bots more than with their spouse, and of course all 
these interactions will be digital. Another estimate says that in 2021, 20 percent of 
all activities a human do will involve using a service from at least one of the giant IT 
companies (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon). Not to mention, most people will prefer 
to use voice commands to interact with their computing devices over typing.
These figures should give you an idea about what the near future will look like in the 
digital age. The volume of digital data along with the increased number of people using 
the Internet to do their jobs will make online sources the primary source of OSINT for 
both governments and business corporations in the future.
OSINT Organizations
Some specialized organizations provide OSINT services. Some of them are government 
based, and others are private companies that offer their services to different parties 
such as government agencies and business corporations on a subscription basis. In this 
section, we will mention the main OSINT organizations worldwide.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

7
Government Organizations
Government organizations working in OSINT analysis are still considered the best 
because of the resources available from their governments to do their jobs. The two most 
famous government agencies that do OSINT globally are the Open Source Center in the 
United States and BBC Monitoring in Great Britain.
Open Source Center
We already talked about the Open Source Center (OSC); it is the largest OSINT 
organization and has vast resources to do its job. OSC works closely with other local 
intelligence agencies in the United States and offers its services to U.S. government 
intelligence agencies.
BBC Monitoring
BBC Monitoring (https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/login) is a department within the 
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) that monitors foreign media worldwide. It has 
a similar role as the Open Source Center in the United States, with the main difference 
being that it does not belong to British Intelligence. BBC Monitoring is funded from its 
stakeholders in addition to many commercial and governmental entities around the 
world. It was first established in 1939 and has offices in different countries around the 
globe. It actively monitors TV, radio broadcast, print media, Internet, and emerging 
trends from 150 countries in more than 70 languages. BBC Monitoring is directed by 
the BBC and offers its services on a subscription basis to interested parties such as 
commercial organizations and UK official bodies.
Private Sector
You should not underestimate the private sector when looking at who supplies OSINT 
information; many private corporations have developed advanced programs and 
techniques to gathers data from public sources for commercial gain. Indeed, most 
private OSINT corporations partner with government agencies to supply them with such 
information. In this section, we will mention the main ones around the globe.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

8
Jane’s Information Group
Jane’s Information Group (http://www.janes.com) is a British company founded in 
1898. Jane’s is a leading provider that specializes in military, terrorism, state stability, 
serious and organized crime, proliferation and procurement intelligence, aerospace, and 
transportation subjects. It publishes many journals and books related to security matters 
in addition to its OSINT sources that track and predict security matters in 190 states and 
30 territories.
Economist Intelligence Unit
The Economist Intelligence Unit (https://www.eiu.com/home.aspx) is the business 
intelligence, research, and analysis division of the British Economist Group. The main 
domain of the Economist Intelligence Unit is its business and financial forecasts; it offers 
a monthly report in addition to a country economic forecast for the coming five years 
with a comprehensive view about current trends on economic and political issues.
Oxford Analytica
Oxford Analytica (http://www.oxan.com) is a relatively small OSINT firm compared 
with the previous two. Oxford Analytica specializes in geopolitics and macroeconomics 
subjects. It has a global macro expert network to advise its clients on the best practices of 
strategy and performance when accessing complex markets. Its expert networks contain 
more than 1400 experts. Most of them are scholars on their subject, senior faculty 
members in top universities, and high-profile specialists in their sector.
Gray Literature Vendors
We already talked about gray literature as part of OSINF data. However, this type of data 
deserves to have its own reference when talking about the main sources of information 
used in OSINT gathering because of its great intelligence value.
Gray literature is mainly produced by the world’s publishing companies. It includes 
books, journals, newspapers, and anything published publicly. However, there is 
another type of gray literature called gray information that has different acquisition 
requirements.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

9
Usually the terms gray literature and gray information are used interchangeably. 
However, in the intelligence arena, they are slightly different. Gray literature refers 
to all publications that can be obtained from traditional bookstore channels, while 
gray information refers to other publications that cannot be obtained from traditional 
routes. Hence, gray information has its own channels, and it may be difficult to identify 
and acquire it. Gray information includes the following and more: academic papers, 
preprints, proceedings, conference and discussion papers, research reports, marketing 
reports, technical specifications and standards, dissertations, theses, trade publications, 
memoranda, government reports and documents not published commercially, 
translations, newsletters, market surveys, trip reports, and festival agendas.
Gray literature can be divided into three main kinds.
•	
White: This includes anything published publicly for sale through 
traditional bookstore channels. The publication should have an ISBN 
or ISSN and can be obtained directly from its seller. Books, journals, 
and newspapers fall in this category.
•	
Ephemeral: This type is short-lived. Examples include flight 
schedules, draft versions, copies of invoices, advertisements, posters, 
tickets, business cards, and anything that is self-published.
•	
Gray: This contains a mix of the previously mentioned two types.
Generally, gray literature can be obtained by paying subscription fees for such 
content or through buying books, journals, magazines, and other publications directly 
from bookstores. To acquire more hidden gray information, you have to use other 
specialized services. The following are some of them.
Factiva
Factiva (http://new.dowjones.com/products/factiva) is a global news database with 
licensed content. It harvests data from more than 33,000 premium sources, and many 
of these sources (74 percent) are licensed and cannot be found freely online. Factiva 
collects sources in 28 languages in addition to its unique service of being able to provide 
access to resources that have not been published yet by their creators.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

10
LexisNexis
LexisNexis (https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/gateway.page) is currently owned 
by RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier). It originally focused on providing high-quality 
legal and journalistic documents, but it has expanded its coverage to include more 
services such as media monitoring tools, supply management tools, sales intelligence 
solutions, market intelligence tools, and risk solutions that analyze public and industry-
specific content to predict risk and improve decision-making.
The following are other companies that specialize in gathering online intelligence 
from both public and private sources:
•	
InsideView (https://www.insideview.com)
•	
NewsEdge (www.newsedge.com)
•	
Semantic Visions (www.semantic-visions.com)
•	
DigitalGlobe (www.digitalglobe.com)
Parties Interested in OSINT Information
OSINT can be beneficial for different actors. In this section, we will list them and explain 
what motivates each one to search for OSINT resources.
Government
Government bodies, especially military departments, are considered the largest 
consumer of OSINT sources. The huge technological developments and widespread 
use of the Internet worldwide have made governments a huge consumer for OSINT 
intelligence. Governments need OSINT sources for different purposes such as national 
security, counterterrorism, cybertracking of terrorists, understanding domestic and 
foreign public views on different subjects, supplying policy makers with required 
information to influence their internal and external policy, and exploiting foreign media 
like TV to get instant translations of different events happening outside.
Intelligence agencies combine legally accessible information with their secretly 
acquired intelligence (for example, using spy satellite images, electronic listening 
stations, and spies) to answer a specific question or to predict the future. Those people 
have the required resources (money and equipment) to capture and analyze huge 
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

11
quantities of data on the Internet. The act of mining OSINT data by governments is 
expected to intensify as we move steadily toward what is now a digital age.
International Organizations
International organizations like the UN use OSINT sources to support peacekeeping 
operations around the globe. The UN balances superpowers’ and emerging nation-­
states’ concerns when creating its policy, which requires it to be as transparent as 
possible. To achieve this, the UN found that it is more convenient to exploit OSINT 
sources (including commercial satellite images) for intelligence needs instead of 
depending on reports from its member states, which may have conflicting policies.
Humanitarian organizations, like the International Red Cross, use OSINT sources to 
aid them in their relief efforts in a time of crisis or disaster. They use OSINT intelligence 
to protect their supply chain from terrorist groups by analyzing social media sites and 
Internet messaging applications to predict future terrorist actions.
NATO depends heavily on OSINT sources for intelligence purposes and for making 
plans for peacekeeping operations. It also benefits from commercial satellite imagery 
to plan operations because not all NATO member states have such facilities. NATO 
has published three standard references about how to exploit OSINT to the public. 
The first one is NATO Open Source Intelligence Handbook (https://archive.org/
details/NATOOSINTHandbookV1.2). The second is NATO Open Source Intelligence Reader 
(http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/nato/osint_reader.pdf). The third one is 
NATO Intelligence Exploitation of the Internet (http://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/
NSAEBB436/docs/EBB-005.pdf).
Law Enforcement Agencies
Police uses OSINT sources to protect citizens from abuse, sexual violence, identity theft, 
and other crimes. This can be done by monitoring social media channels for interesting 
keywords and pictures to help prevent crimes before they escalate.
Law enforcement uses OSINT to monitor and track a criminal’s networks across 
different countries. For example, they use OSINT tactics to compile information about 
people of interest to create a complete profile for each one. They also use OSINT sources 
for online counterfeiting and copyright violations.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

12
Business Corporations
Information is power, and corporations use OSINT sources to investigate new markets, 
monitor competitors’ activities, plan marketing activities, and predict anything that can 
affect their current operations and future growth. In the past, exploiting OSINT sources 
was limited to big businesses with good intelligence budgets. Nowadays, with the 
widespread use of the Internet, small companies with limited budgets can exploit OSINT 
sources effectively and merge acquired information into their business plans.
Businesses also use OSINT intelligence for other nonfinancial purposes such as the 
following:
•	
To fight against data leakage, knowing that the business exposure 
of confidential information and the security vulnerabilities of their 
networks is a cause of future cyberthreats
•	
To create their threat intelligence strategies through analyzing OSINT 
sources from both outside and inside the organization and then 
combining this information with other information to accomplish an 
effective cyber-risk management policy that helps them to protect 
their financial interests, reputation, and customer base
OSINT is specifically useful for companies working in the defense industry, as such 
companies need to be fully aware of the surrounding circumstances of their customers 
to develop and target them with the appropriate equipment.
Penetration Testers and Black Hat Hackers/Criminal 
Organizations
OSINT is used extensively by hackers and penetration testers to gather intelligence about 
a specific target online. It is also considered a valuable tool to assist in conducting social 
engineering attacks. The first phase of any penetration testing methodology begins with 
reconnaissance (in other words, with OSINT). Figure 1-1 details the main phases of 
penetration testing.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

13
Penetration testers are paid by companies to break into internal networks to show 
where weaknesses lie and how to keep outsiders out. This is different from black hat 
hackers who exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to confidential data; 
however, both use the same reconnaissance techniques and tools to achieve their work.
Privacy-Conscious People
These are ordinary people who might want to check how outsiders can break into their 
computing devices and what their ISP knows about them. They also need to know their 
online exposure level to close any security gap and delete any private data that may 
have been published inadvertently. OSINT is a great tool to see how your digital identity 
appears to the outside world, allowing you to maintain your privacy.
Individuals can also use OSINT to fight against identity theft, for example, in case 
someone is impersonating you. During this book, we will teach you different techniques 
to search for text, images, and video, as well as digital file metadata.
Indeed, all Internet users are using OSINT techniques in one way or another, such 
as when searching for something online. Whether it is a company, school, university, or 
person you are looking for, you are collecting some form of OSINT intelligence.
Terrorist Organizations
Terrorists use OSINT sources to plan attacks, collect information about targets before 
attacking them (like when using satellite images such as Google Maps to investigate the 
target location), procure more fighters by analyzing social media sites, acquire military 
information revealed accidentally by governments (like how to construct bombs), and 
spread their propaganda across the world using different media channels.
Figure 1-1.  Penetration testing methodology (source: http://www.DarknessGate.com)
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

14
Information Gathering Types
OSINT sources can be collected using three main methods: passive, semipassive, and 
active. The usage of one in favor of another is dependent on the scenario in which the 
gathering process operates in addition to the type of data that you are interested in. The 
three gathering techniques are generally used to describe the ways in which footprinting 
works, in other words, acquiring technical information about target IT infrastructure 
(types of OS, network topology, server names, and so on). However, bear in mind that 
this book will teach you different techniques to collect OSINT intelligence, and technical 
footprinting is considered a kind of information gathering.
Passive Collection
This is the most used type when collecting OSINT intelligence. Indeed, all OSINT 
intelligence methods should use passive collection because the main aim of OSINT 
gathering is to collect information about the target via publicly available resources only. 
In this type, your target knows nothing about your intelligence-collecting activities. 
This kind of search is highly anonymous and should be done secretly. From a technical 
perspective, this type of gathering reveals limited information about the target because 
you do not send any traffic (packets) to the target server—either directly or indirectly—
and the main resources that you can gather are limited to archive information (mainly 
outdated information), unprotected files left on target servers, and content present on 
the target website.
Semipassive
From a technical view, this type of gathering sends limited traffic to target servers to 
acquire general information about them. This traffic tries to resemble typical Internet 
traffic to avoid drawing any attention to your reconnaissance activities. In this way, you 
are not implementing in-depth investigation of the target’s online resources, but only 
investigating lightly without launching any alarm on the target’s side. Although this 
type of gathering is considered somehow anonymous, the target can know that there 
is reconnaissance happening if they investigate the issue (by checking the server or 
networking device logs). However, they should not be able to attribute it to the attacker’s 
machine.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

15
Active Collection
In this type, you interact directly with the system to gather intelligence about it. The target 
can become aware of the reconnaissance process since the person/entity collecting 
information will use advanced techniques to harvest technical data about the target IT 
infrastructure such as accessing open ports, scanning vulnerabilities (unpatched Windows 
systems), scanning web server applications, and more. This traffic will look like suspicious 
or malicious behavior and will leave traces on the target’s intrusion detection system (IDS) 
or intrusion prevention system (IPS). Conducting social engineering attacks on the target 
is also considered a type of active information gathering.
As we said earlier, active collection and semipassive collection are types of 
information gathering, but you usually do not use them in OSINT gathering. Passive 
collection is preferred because it can harvest information from public sources secretly, 
and this is the essence of OSINT.
Benefits of OSINT
In today’s information age, no one can underestimate the vital role that OSINT plays 
in the different intelligence arenas. The benefits of OSINT span many areas in today’s 
world. The following are the main ones:
•	
Less risky: Using publicly available information to collect intelligence 
has no risk compared with other forms of intelligence such as using 
spying satellites or using human sources on the ground to collect 
information, especially in hostile countries.
•	
Cost effective: Collecting OSINT is generally less expensive compared 
with other intelligence sources. For instance, using human sources or 
spying satellite to collect data is costly. Small businesses with limited 
intelligence budgets can exploit OSINT sources with minimal costs.
•	
Ease of accessibility: OSINT sources are always available, no matter 
where you are, and are always up-to-date. OSINT sources can be 
used by different parties in any intelligence context; all you need 
are the required skills/tools to harvest and analyze OSINT properly. 
For example, military departments can predict future attacks by 
analyzing activities on social networking sites, while corporations can 
use it to build their new market expansion strategies.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

16
•	
Legal issues: OSINT resources can be shared between different parties 
without worrying about breaching any copyright license as these 
resources are already published publicly. Of course, some limitations 
apply when sharing gray literature; we already covered this in a 
previous section.
•	
Aiding financial investigators: OSINT allows specialized government 
agencies to detect tax evaders, for instance. Many famous celebrities 
and some giant companies are involved in tax evasion, and 
monitoring their social media accounts, vacations, and lifestyles has 
a great value for a government inspector who may be chasing them 
for undeclared income.
•	
Fighting against online counterfeiting: OSINT techniques can be used 
to find false products/services and direct law enforcement to close 
such sites or to send warnings to users to stop dealing with them. 
This is a great advantage of OSINT, especially when fighting against 
counterfeit pharmaceutical and natural health products.
•	
Maintaining national security and political stability: This might be the 
most important role of OSINT; it helps governments to understand 
their people’s attitudes and act promptly to avoid any future clashes. 
Wise governments utilize OSINT in their future strategies, especially 
for their domestic policies.
Challenges of Open Source Intelligence
All intelligence gathering methodologies have some limitations, and OSINT is not 
exempt from this rule. In this section, we will mention some of the challenges that face 
OSINT gathering.
•	
Sheer volume of data: Collecting OSINT will produce a huge amount 
of data that must be analyzed to be considered of value. Of course, 
many automated tools exist for this purpose, and many governments 
and giant companies have developed their own set of artificial 
intelligence tools and techniques to filter acquired data. However, the 
tremendous volume of data will remain a challenge for the OSINT 
gatherer.
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

17
•	
Reliability of sources: Bear in mind that OSINT sources, especially 
when used in the intelligence context, need to be verified thoroughly 
by classified sources before they can be trusted. Many governments 
broadcast inaccurate information to mislead the OSINT-gathering 
process.
•	
Human efforts: As we already mentioned, the sheer volume of data 
is considered the greatest challenge for OSINT collection. Humans 
need to view the output of automated tools to know whether the 
collected data is reliable and trustworthy; they also need to compare 
it with some classified data (this is applicable for some military and 
commercial information) to assure its reliability and relevance. This 
will effectively consume time and precious human resources.
Legal and Ethical Constraints
Despite the great importance of OSINT, it has legal concerns when analyzed or captured 
in many cases. For example, if someone acquires OSINT sources by illegal means to 
justify an honest case, how should the legal system handle it? Another dilemma is when 
the OSINT sample is minimized or selected according to the collector’s need. They could 
effectively discard important sources purposely in favor of bringing about a specific 
outcome.
Another concern is when some forms of hidden public information are collected 
and publicized widely as part of a scandal. As you are going to see in this book, a lot of 
public information cannot be viewed by the regular Internet user and needs specific 
techniques/methods to acquire. What is the consequence for such things? What will be 
the effects on some groups or individuals when revealing such information about them? 
What are the moral consequences?
Over the past five years, many whistleblowers have stolen classified information from 
well-guarded agencies and institutions and published it online (Edward Snowden is a 
clear example). Should we consider this information belonging to the public source? Of 
course, military departments around the world will be thirsty for such information, but 
should we use it—as individuals or companies—as a public source for our intelligence?
Chapter 1  The Evolution of Open Source Intelligence

18
Many corporations (Facebook and Google are examples) harvest a large volume 
of online user data for commercial intelligence; most of this data belongs to the user’s 
actions and behavior online and cannot be used to recognize the user’s real identity. For 
instance, there are two types of data that can be collected online:
•	
Sensitive personal information (SPI) such as name, Social Security 
number, place of birth, parents’ names, passport or ID number
•	
Anonymous information such as technical information like your 
OS type and version, browser version, IP address, connected device 
location, and anything that is shared between more than one 
connected user
To justify the collection, these corporations say they acquire only anonymous data, 
but what if this anonymous information has been combined with other sources to 
become SPI? How should such information be handled by the OSINT analyst?
The final legal concern that we are going to cover is the reliance on automated 
machines to collect and analyze OSINT information. Can we trust the outcome of 
automated machines and treat it just like the data collected by humans? What if there 
is a software flaw in the tool that produces inaccurate output that leads to harmful 
consequences? How we can find a balance between using automated machines, which 
are necessary in the OSINT-gathering process, and remaining ethical?
The limitations of OSINT in addition to its legal constraints should encourage its 
adopters to follow an individualized and tailored approach when using it.
Summary
In this chapter, you discovered the essence of OSINT, its types and users, and how it can 
be used in different contexts by different parties to gain intelligence. We distinguished 
between different ways to gather information online (mainly technical footprinting) and 
talked briefly about what things each method cares about.
We concluded by talking about the advantages and limitations of OSINT gathering. 
No information-gathering methodology is considered 100 percent complete; however, 
with the right planning and sufficient resources and expertise, exploiting OSINT will 
produce accurate results on a great scale.

OSINT is a great place to get intelligence about future events, but acquiring OSINT 
alone is not enough to produce accurate results. For instance, to achieve the best results 
from OSINT sources, some value-added tasks must be considered during the analysis 
phase, such as using an expert analyst, merging OSINT information with classified 
information when handling military information, and adopting the right techniques to 
acquire nonbiased OSINT intelligence.
This chapter was an introduction to the subject. In the following chapters, we will 
thoroughly cover a plethora of techniques and tools to harvest and analyze OSINT 
information. Before we begin diving into the world of OSINT, though, it is essential 
to learn how to maintain our digital privacy and obscure our online activities when 
conducting OSINT gathering, and this will be the subject of the next chapter.

CHAPTER 2
Introduction To 
Online Threats and 
Countermeasures
As you do your research for OSINT, you will certainly leave digital traces behind that 
can be used to track you. For example, consider an investigator performing an online 
search for drug dealers in Mexico. What if the people the investigator was searching for 
discovers his search? What if they could learn the source of the search (the organization 
or the person behind the search) and the searcher’s location? If you think that criminal 
organizations are not technically savvy, we’re afraid you are wrong. Terrorists and 
criminal organizations have specialized teams working in IT to gather intelligence 
online, and even small criminal organizations with limited budgets outsource such tasks 
to specialized organizations for a fee.
As you saw in Chapter 1, OSINT is beneficial to many user groups. We already gave 
an example for an investigator searching for drug dealers; however, the same thing 
applies to anyone conducting OSINT searches such as individuals, government entities, 
business corporations, and even NGOs and global organizations like NATO. Revealing 
the searcher’s identity when conducting OSINT searches can have dangerous—and even 
legal—consequences on some user segments.
In this chapter, we will teach you how to conceal your digital identity and become 
anonymous online. You will learn how to exchange data secretly across hostile 
environments like the Internet and how to communicate with your peers privately and 
anonymously. You will also learn how to check your digital footprint and discover what 
kind of digital traces you are leaving behind. But before we begin, we will cover online 

22
threats and how outside adversaries can exploit computing devices and networks to steal 
confidential information. Countermeasures and best practices to maintain your online 
security and privacy will be thoroughly covered.
This is the longest chapter in this book; you can consider it as a mini book that 
teaches you how to work online privately. This knowledge is mandatory, as you cannot 
conduct OSINT searches with your real identity.
Note!  We cannot teach you how to become 100 percent anonymous in one 
chapter. However, to begin conducting your OSINT search, this chapter is enough to 
help you avoid attracting outside observers to your OSINT-gathering activities.
To understand all concepts in depth and learn how different actors can invade 
your privacy, you should read our book Digital Privacy and Security Using 
Windows (https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484227985), which is 
considered the perfect companion to this book. If you already have this book, you 
can skip this chapter.
Online Threats
Despite its great benefits to humanity, the Internet is still a hostile environment. 
Bad guys are always out there to disrupt your life. In this section, we will list the 
main risks that Internet users face when going online, and we will give brief advice/
countermeasures for each one.
Malware
Malware is short for “malicious software.” It is the term used for any malicious software/
code that can damage to your computing device or steal your confidential information 
without your consent. There are different kinds of malware such as viruses, spyware, 
rootkits, worms, ransomware, scareware, and adware.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

23
Note!  There are many websites that offer free samples of live malicious code 
(malware) for security researchers, incident responders, forensic analysts, and any 
interested party. Some of these sites are the following:
https://virusshare.com
https://www.virustotal.com
http://malc0de.com/database
https://virusscan.jotti.org
Black Hat Hackers
Black hat hackers are people with sophisticated computing skills. They aim to invade 
private networks and break into other people computing devices to steal personal 
information or to conduct other malicious acts. They usually exploit vulnerabilities in 
the OS, in application programs, or in networking devices to gain unauthorized access. 
After gaining access, they may install a keylogger or a Trojan horse to maintain their 
access, steal information, or spy on user activities.
Pharming
Pharming is a cyberattack intended to redirect users from a legitimate website to a 
fraudulent site without their knowledge. Pharming can be conducted either by changing 
the hosts file on a victim’s computer or by poisoning the Domain Name System (DNS) 
server records with false information to lead users to unwanted destinations.
Windows users can prevent this type of attack on their local machines by preventing 
hosts file modifications through the following steps:
	 1.	 Navigate to the %SYSTEMDRIVE%\Windows\Ssystem32\drivers\etc 
folder (SYSTEMDRIVE is where you installed Windows, usually at 
C:\).
	 2.	 Right-click the hosts file, select Properties, and select the Read-
only attribute; finally, click OK (see Figure 2-1).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

24
Note!  You can edit the Windows hosts file using a feature-rich tool. Such tools allow 
you to add entries to block malware sites and enable or disable the hosts file. Check 
out HostsMan (www.abelhadigital.com/hostsman) and SysMate - Hosts File  
Walker (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sysmate-hosts-­file-walker/).
Phishing
Phishing is a kind of social engineering attack where an attacker uses psychological 
tricks (social tricks) over the phone or uses a computing device (emails, IM chat) to 
convince people to hand over sensitive information about themselves or an organization 
and its computer systems.
Phishing emails appear as if they were sent by a legitimate company or someone 
you know (such as an individual on your contact list). These emails usually contain a 
link that the user must click to access/update an online account (for example, a bank or 
social site account). Upon clicking such links, the user will be directed to a fraudulent 
website that appears legitimate. When the user provides their credentials, the attacker 
will store them for later use and direct the user to the original website.
Figure 2-1.  Changing the hosts file attributes to Read-only to avoid pharming 
attacks on Windows machines
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

25
Phishing emails have some characteristics that anyone can spot. Here is a list of the 
main ones:
•	
They use threatening or urgent words in the subject line to encourage 
the user to act promptly. They usually ask you to update your online 
account or to send your personal details by replying to the email.
•	
Some phishing emails offer prizes, work-from-home vacancies 
with large salaries and no qualifications necessary, or business 
investments with high profits. Then they ask for your contact details 
for further negotiations.
•	
Phishing emails look unprofessional and contain many grammatical 
errors; they also originate from a different domain than the company 
they pretend to represent. For example, an email from PayPal should 
come from the PayPal.com domain and not from xyz.PayPal.com.
Whenever you suspect an email to be a phishing email, do not reply to it. To check 
whether it is a phishing email, rest your mouse (but don’t click) over the links in the 
email to see whether the address matches the link that was typed in the message or the 
sender domain name. In addition, do not supply any personal information if a phishing 
email asks you to fill any forms (see Figure 2-2).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

26
Some attackers use URL-shortening services to mask the real phishing URL sent to 
the user. If you suspect that a short URL could be a scam, you can expand it using these 
free online services to see its destination:
•	
http://checkshorturl.com
•	
www.getlinkinfo.com
•	
http://wheredoesthislinkgo.com
•	
https://linkexpander.com
Note!  Lehigh University provides different types of phishing emails with a 
short description about each one (https://lts.lehigh.edu/phishing/
examples). The site at www.phishing.org/phishing-examples offers 
sample phishing emails also.
Figure 2-2.  Example phishing email pretending to be from Google
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

27
If you suspect that you are a victim of a phishing attack, contact the Federal Trade 
Commission at https://www.ftc.gov/complaint and raise a complaint. You can report 
an identity theft on the same page if you suspect that someone or a company is misusing 
your private data. You can also file a complaint on the FBI website at https://www.ic3.
gov/complaint/default.aspx.
Ransomware
Ransomware is malware that installs silently on the user’s computer or mobile device; it 
works by locking the user’s access to his files—or screen—by encrypting all user data on 
the device in addition to all the data on the attached storage devices (USB flash, external 
HDD, or SSD) and then requesting a ransom to remove the restriction. Some types of 
ransomware threaten victims to publish their data publicly if they refuse to pay the 
ransom. The ransom is usually paid through anonymous online payment methods like 
Bitcoin—which is a kind of digital currency—to get the decryption key.
Ransomware infection comes through a variety of methods. For example, a ransom 
could be attached to spam emails, installed upon visiting malicious websites, or installed 
as part of a legitimate program that has been modified by an attacker to conceal the 
ransomware within it. It can also get dropped by other malware such as a Trojan horse or 
exploit kits.
There are two main types of ransomware.
•	
The first type—also known as locker-ransomware locks the system 
screen in a way that is easy for an experienced computer user to 
unlock the restriction.
•	
The second type—also known as crypto-ransomware—encrypts 
whole disk drive or some files types, including all attached removable 
storage, and requests a ransom to remove the restriction.
A special variant of ransomware attacks the master boot record (MBR) of the 
vulnerable system, thus preventing the OS from booting unless the victim pays the ransom.
To counteract ransomware attacks, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Back up all necessary files regularly. All operating system types 
have special backup functionality. In Windows 10, you can access 
the backup functionality through Windows Settings (Windows + I) 
➤ Update & Security ➤ Backup.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

28
	 2.	 Regularly install all security patches for the operating system and 
all installed applications and keep them all up-to-date.
	 3.	 Install antivirus and anti-malware solutions if possible and keep 
them up-to-date.
	 4.	 Do not run macros in Microsoft Office files when receiving such 
files from an unknown user or when downloading them from the 
Internet.
If a ransom attack successfully compromises your system, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Disconnect your computer from the network/Internet.
	 2.	 Perform a full scan of all connected devices/storage media.
	 3.	 Seek advice from a specialist to find out the ransomware type as 
there are removal tools available for specific ransomware families.
	 4.	 Format affected devices if necessary and perform an OS reinstall.
	 5.	 Restore your data from a previous clean backup.
	 6.	 Inform law enforcement about the case and do not pay the ransom.
Tip  Crypto Sheriff (https://www.nomoreransom.org/crypto-sheriff.
php?lang=en) helps users recover from ransomware attacks by offering a free 
service to check the type of ransomware affecting your device and then helping 
you to download the decryption solution if available.
Adware and Spyware
Adware is a kind of advertisement software that tracks users’ online activities to display 
corresponding ads, thus generating revenue for its author. It is usually installed as part of 
free Internet programs such as system utilities, games, or browser toolbars. You cannot 
consider all adware software as being malicious because many of them are installed 
as part of legitimate software that declares the existence of adware as part of its end-­
user license agreement (EULA). However, most users simply click the “I agree” button 
without knowing that they are installing adware on their machine.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

29
Spyware is another kind of tracking software; however, it is for malicious purposes 
only. Spyware monitors everything you type on your keyboard and sends it to its 
operator. Some types install other malware (like ransomware) on your machine to 
facilitate performing other malicious actions.
Trojan
This is a kind of malicious computer program that installs silently on the victim machine. 
It enables its operator to have full control over the victim machine including the camera 
and microphone. Most of the popular banking threats come from a Trojan family like 
Zeus and SpyEye.
Virus
This is what most non-computer-savvy users mean when talking about malicious 
computer programs. Viruses are considered one of the oldest traditional risks since the 
early days of personal computers. The main intent of a virus is to make the victim operating 
system inoperable, thus forcing the user to format it to return to its original state.
Worms
The Morris worm, or Internet worm, was one of the first to be seen in the wild. In 
November 1988, it was distributed via the Internet and caused significant damage to the 
infected systems. This is now another type of old-school attack that is still widely used. The 
main intent of a worm is to spread from one machine to another through internal networks 
or the Internet to spread malicious code. By replicating itself, worms consume a great 
amount of network bandwidth—for example, sending files via emails—thus causing great 
damage to corporate networks. Worms can also install backdoors on computers.
Scareware
Scareware is a kind of malicious software—also known as deception software, rogue 
scanner software, or fraudware—that tricks the victim into purchasing security software 
(such as antivirus and anti-malware) to remove the infection from their PC. For example, 
a user can see a pop-up message on their PC stating that it is infected with malware and 
should act promptly by purchasing a special anti-malware solution—which is fake!—to 
clean the PC. The idea here is to trick the user into purchasing something unnecessarily 
to take the user’s money.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

30
Worm infections can be mitigated through installing security software and keeping 
your OS and antivirus solution up-to-date.
Distributed Denial of Service
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack happens when many compromised 
computing devices flood a target computer—for example, a server—with many fake 
requests simultaneously, making it unresponsive to serve legitimate users. This attack 
targets a large number of entities such as banks, shopping websites, and news agencies. 
Unlike other attacks that aim to steal confidential data, the main aim of a DDoS attack is 
to make your website and servers unavailable to legitimate users.
Rootkits
A rootkit is a dangerous type of malware; it can potentially gain administrative access 
over the system and can prevent normal detection programs (antivirus and anti-rootkit 
programs) from noticing its presence. Some dangerous rootkits attack at the hardware 
level (firmware rootkit), and removal may require hardware replacement or specialized 
intervention.
Rootkit detection is difficult because there is no single security solution that can 
remove all known and unknown rootkits. However, there are many valuable programs 
that can remove a large number of rootkit types, as you’ll see later in the chapter. 
Juice Jacking
This is a type of cyberattack where an attacker copies data or installs malware onto a 
victim’s smartphone/tablet when the victim connects a device—through USB cable—to 
a public charging station that has been modified to play a malicious role. Public charging 
stations can be found at airports, hotels, shopping centers, and conferences.
Wi-Fi Eavesdropping
Free Wi-Fi access points are spread almost everywhere. An attacker can exploit 
vulnerabilities in such devices to intercept all the communication—via phone calls, 
instant messages, and video conferences—that’s gone through them. It is highly 
recommended not to use free Wi-Fi service in public places unless a strong virtual 
private network (VPN) has been used to protect the connection.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

31
Security Software
It is essential to install an antivirus solution on your computer before a malicious piece 
of software compromises it. Having an antivirus program is considered the first line of 
defense against cyberattacks. New viruses are created nearly every minute. It is the job of 
the antivirus software to keep up with the latest threats.
Bear in mind that having an antivirus program installed on your machine does 
not give you 100 percent protection. With the sophistication of modern cyberattacks, 
you need more than one measure to protect your computing devices and network. For 
instance, installing a firewall solution is equally essential as the antivirus program. Many 
antivirus solutions come equipped with a built-in firewall. In this book, we will mention 
only the free products.
Antivirus
Commercial antivirus solutions are always better than their free counterparts (see 
Table 2-1), so we will begin by talking about the recommended features that must be 
existed within any antivirus solution to be considered useful.
•	
It should be equipped with a built-firewall.
•	
It should be able to scan email clients—such as Thunderbird and 
Outlook—and detect phishing attacks.
•	
It must update itself automatically and discover zero-day malware 
before it hits your machine.
•	
It should be able to detect advanced malware like rootkits and 
ransomware and all kinds of malicious software like adware and 
spyware.
•	
It should protect your browser from browser exploits and have DNS 
protection.
•	
It must not consume high computing resources to operate.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

32
Windows 10 comes supplied with a free antivirus solution, Windows Defender. 
This program helps guard your PC against viruses and other advanced threats such as 
rootkits and bootkits; however, its main disadvantage is the lack of a personal firewall. 
This should not let you underestimate Windows Defender because you can install a free 
dedicated firewall, as we will show next.
Firewall
A firewall monitors and controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic and helps 
you to screen out hackers, viruses, and worms that try to reach your computer over 
the Internet. As we already said, not all free antivirus solutions come equipped with a 
personal firewall, but there are many free dedicated personal firewalls that can do the 
job. See Table 2-2 for the most well-known ones.

Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

33
Anti-malware
Cyberattacks are being developed continually. Every day sophisticated malicious scripts 
and programs are created by cybercriminals, and anti-malware solutions help to detect 
threats that were not previously discovered by regular antivirus solutions. To achieve 
maximum protection, it is necessary to have an anti-malware solution in addition to 
your installed antivirus program.
The free edition of Spybot (https://www.safer-networking.org/dl/) has an 
anti-­malware and anti-spyware functionality that can be installed along with your 
antivirus solution.
Another famous program for detecting malware is Malwarebytes  
(https://www.malwarebytes.com). The free version has the basic anti-malware and 
spyware protection in addition to its ability to remove rootkits and repairs the files that 
are damaged. It can also work with any antivirus program already installed.
Securing the Operating System
No matter what kinds of security software you have already installed on your OS, 
securing the OS itself is still the first task you should do before installing any programs or 
accessing the local network or the Internet.
There are two types of risks that threaten the security of your OS.
•	
Logical threats originating from malware and other malicious 
programs.
•	
Physical threats. These happen when an attacker gains physical 
access to your machine (for example, through USB or other ports) to 
perform a crafted, malicious action.

We already covered how to secure the first part of the logical side of the OS through 
installing security software. In this section, we will continue to cover other parts of OS 
logical security—which is related to OS configuration—in addition to physical security.
We will not delve into the OS security as that requires a book of its own. For this 
book, we will cover the main security configuration that you should do to enhance OS 
security and privacy. The focus will be on the Windows OS because it is the most widely 
used OS on earth.
Hardening the Windows OS
The Windows OS is not intended to be a secure, anonymous OS. When conducting 
OSINT searches, you should avoid revealing your real identity online. Windows can 
be configured to be more private following a simple steps. Besides, the software and 
techniques that we are going to demonstrate later will allow you to conduct your OSINT 
searches anonymously in addition to hiding/masking your digital fingerprint.
Note!  There are many different operating systems, like macOS, Linux, and 
Windows in addition to mobile OSs like iOS from Apple and Android from Google. 
Whatever OS you use, it has not been created to be completely anonymous and 
private. There are special distributions—usually based on Linux—that provide 
maximum security and anonymity when going online like Tails OS, as you are going 
to see later in this chapter.
Warning!  Create a new system restore point before implementing the tweaks in 
this chapter so you can safely revert your changes in case something goes wrong.
For now, let’s begin our list of recommendations to harden your Windows box.
Updating Windows
The Automatic Update feature for the Windows OS should always be turned on. 
Windows 10 Update is set to automatic by default.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

35
Updating All Installed Programs
Windows usually updates Microsoft programs—such as the Microsoft Office suite and 
the Edge (IE) browser—as part of Windows Update, but you should make sure that other 
programs (Adobe Reader, VPN clients, Firefox, and Opera) are also updated regularly.
Locking Your PC Using a USB Drive
The default Windows login authentication does not offer the necessary security for its 
users. Many black hat hackers have successfully compromised this functionality to gain 
unauthorized access to Windows. To add an additional layer of security, you can lock your 
PC with a USB drive in addition to the default login. This procedure is necessary for older 
versions of Windows (7, XP) that cannot be protected using enhanced Windows 10 features.
USB Raptor allows you to lock your PC using a USB flash card. It is a free program 
with many advanced features. You can find it at https://sourceforge.net/projects/
usbraptor/?source=typ_redirect.
Using a Less-Privileged User Account
When conducting OSINT searches, there is no need to use an administrator account; 
it is always advisable that you use a limited user account for your daily tasks. This will 
effectively protect your computer from malware installed inadvertently and prevent 
outside hackers from invading your system and installing malicious software. You can 
configure Windows (all versions) accounts by going to Control Panel ➤ User Accounts.
Using a Strong Password for Windows
Use a strong password to protect your Windows login and make sure to change it once 
every three months. Later in this chapter, we will give tips on how to create strong 
passwords and store them within a password manager.
To enforce a password policy under Windows 10 (all editions), follow these steps:
	 1.	 Go to Control Panel ➤ Administrative Tools ➤ Local Security 
Policy ➤ Security Settings ➤ Account Polices ➤ Password Policy.
	 2.	 On the right side, double-click the “Maximum password age” policy.
	 3.	 Set the number of days a password can be used before Windows 
10 requires users to change it to 90 days.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

36
Disabling Remote Assistance
This feature allows a remote user to access your machine over a network connection. If 
you are not using this feature, you can disable it to prevent hackers from exploiting it to 
gain unauthorized access your machine. To disable it in Windows 10, follow these steps 
(see Figure 2-4):
	 1.	 Enter remote settings into the Cortana search box and select 
“Allow remote access to your computer.”
Keeping Your User Account Control Turned On
User Account Control (UAC) monitors what changes are going to be made to your 
computer by showing a pop-up window when you try to perform actions that require 
administrative access, like installing/uninstalling a program. Turning on UAC will help 
you to deter malware from making changes to your computer. You can adjust UAC for 
each user account through Control Panel ➤ User Accounts; then click “Change User 
Account Control settings” (see Figure 2-3).
Figure 2-3.  Adjust the UAC settings under Windows 10 to notify the user of any 
changes to Windows and other applications
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

37
	 2.	 Make sure that the option “Don’t allow remote connections to this 
computer” is selected.
Figure 2-4.  Disabling remote connections in Windows 10
Making Hidden Files Visible
Some malware and other malicious programs come hidden using the same attribute that 
Windows uses to hide its system files. To display hidden files and folders under Windows 
10, select Control Panel ➤ File Explorer Options and then go to the View tab and select 
the option “Show hidden files, folders, and drives.” Also, make sure to uncheck the 
option “Hide Protected operating systems files.” It is advisable to view file extensions by 
unchecking the option “Hide extensions for known file types.”
Freezing the Hard Disk
The freezing software allows a Windows user to restore their OS to a previous stable state 
within seconds each time the computer restarts. For example, consider a situation when 
a piece of malware hits your OS if you already have a freezing program and it is activated. 
All you need to do is to restart your machine and everything will return to its previous 
state.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

38
RollBack Rx Home Edition (free for personal use) is a program for freezing Windows 
machines. You can find it at http://horizondatasys.com/rollback-rx-time-machine/
rollback-rx-home/.
Setting a Password for BIOS/UEFI
Many cyberattacks against operating systems and encryption software (full disk 
encryption) rely on booting the victim’s machine using a USB or CD/DVD to crack 
the encryption keys or to find a way to steal the victim’s sensitive data. By a setting a 
password for the BIOS/UEFI, each time the user boots the machine, he needs to provide 
some sort of credentials—hence a password—before the computer loads the OS. This 
trick will also prevent an attacker from changing your BIOS settings or damaging your 
computer by wiping your hard drive clean. Each motherboard manufacturer has its own 
menu to set this password, usually in a Security section. You should first boot to BOIS/
UEFI and then activate this option.
Disabling Unnecessary Ports/Protocols and Services
Each open port is considered a security risk. Hackers usually scan open ports to try 
to get access to a victim’s machine. Monitoring traffic going through ports is a firewall 
task; when you configure your personal firewall properly, it will prevent attackers 
from exploiting open ports for malicious purposes. The best secure configuration is 
the “interactive mode” (in Comodo firewall, this rule is called Custom Ruleset) where 
the firewall asks you to grant or deny access to any connection going through OS ports 
(see Figure 2-5).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

39
Like ports, unnecessary services should be disabled. Windows load essential services 
upon starting, but other unused services should be disabled.
To disable a service under Windows, do the following:
	 1.	 Go to Control Panel ➤ Administrative Tools ➤ Services.
	 2.	 Locate a service to disable.
	 3.	 Double-click it to open its Properties dialog box.
	 4.	 Choose Disabled as the startup type.
Staying Private in Windows 10
Compared with the previous Windows versions, Windows 10 comes equipped with 
enhanced security features for encryption and authentication. Windows 10 is also more 
robust against bootkits and rootkit attacks. To use the modern security features offered 
by Windows 10, your computer must have certain hardware components.
•	
Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0: This is used to store the 
cryptographic keys of BitLocker. This is a full disk encryption feature 
offered by some editions of Windows 10 (Windows 10 supports 
BitLocker on Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions).
Figure 2-5.  Sample warning dialog issued by the ESET firewall when a service or 
application is trying to establish an ongoing connection with a remote host
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

40
•	
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI): This is the BIOS 
replacement used in modern certified Windows computers.
•	
Fingerprint scanner: This enhances the traditional Windows 
authentication schema.
A retinal scanner and a 3D camera for facial recognition are highly recommended 
so you can activate the advanced biometric authentication scheme of the Windows 10 
Hello feature. However, their existence in modern computers is still limited because they 
increase a computer’s price significantly.
As we already said, Windows 10 enhances the regular Windows authentication by 
introducing a modern authentication mechanism called Hello. This app allows a user to 
log in to a machine using a fingerprint, face, or even iris. User biometric data will not be 
stored anywhere online—according to Microsoft—for this feature to work.
It is highly recommended not to use the Hello feature on the computer where you 
are going to conduct your OSINT search. It is always advisable to use the local Windows 
account when signing into Windows as no one can guarantee what might happen when 
you send your credentials or other sensitive information over an unsecured medium like 
the Internet.
Windows 10 comes equipped with many new features to personalize the user 
experience when using it. For instance, Cortana is a Windows digital assistance that 
allows a user to navigate Windows using voice commands; it also monitors user actions 
on Windows—such as what the user types and searches for—and personalizes future 
events according to this. To control Cortana’s collection and use of your data, check 
https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-cortana-and-privacy, which 
contains instructions on how to disable it on different Windows devices.
Several privacy configurations of Windows 10 are stored in one location. Windows 10 
created a privacy dashboard that is accessed by pressing Windows key + i to access the 
Settings page and then selecting Privacy (see Figure 2-6).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

41
Everything in the Privacy dashboard is self-explanatory; it is advisable to disable 
everything you do not need and not to use the Microsoft Edge browser for conducting 
online searches. Skype, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive are also not recommended for 
exchanging important files. Secure alternatives to these programs will be given later in 
the chapter.
Destroying Digital Traces
Data destruction is an important step in covering your digital traces when conducting 
OSINT searches. Digital traces—previous usage—on the computer remain even after 
formatting it many times. There are three ways in which data—and remnants of it—can 
be destroyed securely: physical, degaussing and logical destruction (sanitizing). We will 
briefly describe each technique, but let’s first talk about the different types of hard drives 
in use today.
Figure 2-6.  The privacy settings in Windows 10 are all bundled together in one location
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

42
There are two types of hard drives currently used in computing devices.
•	
Hard disk drive (HDD): This is the old type that has been used since 
the early days of personal computers. It is a mechanical device that 
mainly consists of a metal platter (could be more than one) made 
of glass or aluminum coated with magnetic material to store data. 
HDDs are usually used for mass storage and cost less than SSDs.
•	
Solid-state drive (SSD): This is a more advanced version of a drive. 
It does not contain any moving parts and has no platters. Instead, it 
stores data on small microchip units (like USB flash drives). SSD is 
faster and smaller than HDD but has a limited lifespan compared  
to HDD.
Modern computers—and all smartphones and tablets—use SSD as the only storage 
unit type; however, this does not mean that HDD is going to fade away. HDD is a mature 
technology, and it will remain in use for a long time according to many studies.
For this book, let us see the difference between SSD and HDD in terms of data 
recovery.
Recovering data from an HDD is relatively easy and can be conducted by any user 
with the appropriate tools. When you delete a file on an HDD, the file is not deleted 
directly; instead, only the pointer to this file on disk is deleted. This operation helps to 
speed up the deletion process, saving valuable time. Recovering data from an SSD drive 
is quite difficult and impossible in many cases. For instance, an SSD uses a different 
mechanism when handling deleted files. All modern SSDs utilize the TRIM command 
when enabled. This command will remove deleted file data blocks instantly, allowing for 
another file to take up that space. This speeds up the writing process the next time the OS 
needs to write data onto the drive. There are many approaches to implementing TRIM 
on SSD devices, depending on the OS in use. Some operating systems will execute TRIM 
instantly after each file deletion, while others will execute TRIM at regular intervals.
Now, let’s see how data can be destroyed completely when using both types of hard 
drive. The following techniques are used to achieve this:
•	
Physical destruction: This is the most secure and usually preferred 
method used by intelligence services and giant corporations to 
destroy classified and high-grade data assets. This technique works 
by physically destroying the storage medium—whether it is HDD, 
SSD, CD/DVD, or flash drive—so that it is no longer can be used.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

43
•	
Degaussing: This is another secure technique to prevent antirecovery 
techniques from recovering your data from the storage medium; it 
works by exposing the storage medium to the powerful magnetic field 
of a degausser to destroy the stored data magnetically. This technique 
works well with HDD. SSD devices are better destroyed physically to 
avoid the ability to recover top-secret data.
•	
Logical destruction: This is the most widely used technique to 
destroy data while maintaining storage medium for future use. This 
technique works by using specialized software to cover the old data 
and remnants of data with random characters written by the wiping 
tool. There are many wiping algorithms already used to destroy data 
digitally in this way; some are more secure than others. However, 
what you should know when using such a technique to destroy data is 
that it cannot guarantee 100 percent removal of all data on your drive. 
Some advanced recovery techniques that are hardware based are 
still able to capture your old data, or at least parts of it (but doing so 
is costly and time-consuming). Logical data destruction techniques 
have some disadvantages too; they need time to finish because they 
must write random data multiple times (several passes) over all 
the available sectors on the hard drive. In addition, this technique 
assumes your hard drive is working and writable to write the random 
data into it. Another challenge to wiping software comes when using 
it to wipe data stored using the RAID technology. This technology 
offers fault tolerance by mirroring data onto multiple disk drives 
in different physical locations. In such a situation, the wiping tool 
should track all mirrored data across all enterprise storage servers.
Different standards have been developed to wipe data (logical data destruction) on 
hard drives. Table 2-3 shows the most popular ones.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

44
Different programs exist to wipe your hard drives, and the majority support more 
than one wiping standard. Table 2-4 lists the most popular ones (free tools only).

Destroying your digital traces is important when conducting OSINT searches. Bear 
in mind that browsers, image-viewing software, Microsoft Office programs, and anything 
you do on your computer will leave digital traces. By using the advice in this section, you 
will make tracking your traces difficult and even impossible.
Warning!  For people (law enforcement and military officials) conducting top-­
secret OSINT searches who need the maximum anonymity possible, it is highly 
advisable to use an anonymous OS like Tails OS, covered later in the chapter.
General Privacy Settings
In this section, we list some recommendations to maintain your privacy when going 
online. Some of these tips can be considered trivial at first; however, it is important 
to implement them because not doing so can cause serious damage to your privacy if 
exploited by outside adversaries.
Covering Your Laptop Camera
Hackers and intelligence services go after computer cameras and microphones when 
targeting specific people. So, it is advisable to cover your webcams with tape for security 
reasons.
Avoiding Pirated Software
Pirated software can include malicious payload—like a Trojan or keylogger—that can 
invade user privacy and spy on the computing device. It is strongly advised not to access 
pirated websites that distribute illegal contents such as Torrent websites.
If you prefer to use freeware programs downloaded from the Internet, it is highly 
advisable to use your antivirus solution to scan them before executing them. To become 
more confident, you can scan the downloaded program with free scan services, which 
comes in handy when you want to scan a specific file/program using multiple antivirus 
engines.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

46
VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com) is a free service that analyzes suspicious 
files and URLs and facilitates the quick detection of viruses, worms, Trojans, and all 
kinds of malware. All you need to do is enter the website URL you want to check or 
upload the file/program to see whether it is clear from malware threats.
Handling Digital Files Metadata
Metadata is data about data; it contains descriptive—usually hidden—information about 
the file it belongs to. Digital file metadata includes the author name, file size, location, 
creation date/time, and comments.
Conceptually, all digital file types can include metadata. From a privacy perspective, 
users are mainly concerned about the metadata that exists in digital images, audio files, 
and video files. Microsoft Office—and other digital text document creation software—
also contains a wealth of metadata. Metadata usually comes stored in the digital file; 
however, some file types store it in a separate file.
One metadata type existing within images files is EXIF. This is a standard that 
specifies the format for images, sound, and ancillary tags used by digital cameras 
(including smartphones), scanners, and other systems handling image and sound files 
recorded by digital cameras. EXIF data is embedded within the image file and works with 
JPEG images only. EXIF metadata can contain geolocation metadata in addition to a 
wide array of technical information.
Other types include Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP), which supports 
different digital file types and is not limited to images, and the International Press 
Telecommunications Council (IPTC), which is considered an older meta-information 
format.
It is advisable to check the metadata of all digital files before uploading them to the 
Internet or sharing them with colleagues to avoid leaking private information about 
yourself and the device. There are many freeware tools that can view and edit a digital 
file’s metadata; we’ll begin with digital images.
Exif Pilot (www.colorpilot.com/exif.html) is a free EXIF editor that allows you to 
view, edit, and remove EXIF, EXIF GPS, IPTC, and XMP data in addition to adding new 
tags and importing and exporting EXIF and IPTC to/from text and Microsoft Excel files.
Other free tools that can be used to view image metadata are GIMP  
(https://www.gimp.org) and XnView (www.xnview.com/en/), which comes free for 
private and educational use (see Figure 2-7).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

47
Windows comes with a built-in function that allows you to view and remove some 
metadata associated with documents and digital images. However, keep in mind that 
Windows may not be able to remove all EXIF tags, so if you intend on sharing important 
files, always use the suggested third-party tools already mentioned.
To remove EXIF using Windows, right-click the image, select Properties, and go to 
the Details tab. At the bottom, click Remove Properties and Personal Information to 
open the EXIF removal tool. The tool lets you either create a copy of the image with all 
the metadata removed or pick and choose which properties to erase from the selected 
file (see Figure 2-8).
Figure 2-7.  Using the XnView tool to view EXIF tags
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

48
As we already said, metadata also exists within PDFs, Microsoft Office files, and 
audio and video files. In this section, we will briefly cover some useful tools to clear 
metadata from such file types.
To clear metadata from PDF files, Adobe has a feature called Sanitize Document. 
After clicking it, you can remove all the hidden metadata from the intended PDF file  
(see Figure 2-9).
Figure 2-8.  Remove EXIF metadata using the Windows built-in function
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

49
Note!  Not all versions of Adobe Reader support the sanitization feature. If 
your current version does not have this feature, you can use third-party tools 
to remove metadata from your PDF files such as BeCyPDFMetaEdit (www.
becyhome.de/becypdfmetaedit/description_eng.htm) or PDF Metadata 
Editor (http://broken-by.me/pdf-metadata-editor).
To view/edit and remove audio file metadata, use Mp3tag (www.mp3tag.de/en). For 
the video file’s metadata, use MediaInfo (https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo).
To remove metadata from Microsoft Office 2010, 2013, and 2016 documents, you 
can check the document metadata by selecting File and then going to the Info tab. The 
Properties panel will be on the right side; from here you can remove document metadata 
by clicking the Properties button and selecting Advanced Properties (see Figure 2-10).
Figure 2-9.  Clearing PDF file metadata
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

50
In Microsoft Office 2007, you need to click the Microsoft Office button and then 
select Prepare ➤ Properties to edit the document metadata.
Another issue you need to consider when sending Microsoft Office documents to 
outside parties is deleting other hidden metadata. Fortunately, Microsoft Office provides 
functionality for deleting hidden metadata. You can access this feature in Microsoft Word 
2010, 2013, and 2016 by selecting File ➤ Info ➤ Check for Issues ➤ Inspect Document. 
In Microsoft Word 2007, you can access this feature by clicking the Office button and 
selecting Prepare ➤ Inspect Document.
Physically Securing Computing Devices
We already covered different precautionary steps to maintain your privacy, but 
everything is useless if your computing device or hardware (or portable storage units) 
gets stolen or unauthorized physical access takes place while it’s unattended. People 
working to collect OSINT information to investigate crimes and other official issues 
should take extra care to avoid revealing any information about the cases they are 
working on and losing their hardware containing confidential information.
Figure 2-10.  Removing Microsoft Office document metadata
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

51
Corporations and government agencies have special policies to quantify the risks 
to IT infrastructure and the possible consequences, in addition to protection measures 
that should be taken to mitigate such risks. Users should follow these guidelines where 
applicable.
Individuals also suffer from physical threats. Theft and hardware defects can prevent 
them from accessing data stored on computing devices in addition to revealing this 
data to unauthorized users. For example, laptops that are left unattended without being 
secured by a cable lock can be quickly stolen. To secure mobile devices, use these tips:
•	
When using your laptop in public places, secure it by using a cable 
lock attached to a heavy object (e.g., desk, table, column in a garden).
•	
Do not leave your office without locking it when you have portable 
devices in it.
•	
Do not store your work’s sensitive files on your computing device 
without proper permission, and make sure to encrypt everything if 
you store such data on your device.
•	
Do not store your sensitive/personal data on mobile devices without 
proper encryption.
•	
Use a password to protect your mobile device from unauthorized 
access.
•	
Do not turn your Bluetooth connection on in public places, and if 
necessary, run it for a short period of time to receive or send urgent 
files.
•	
Turn off Wi-Fi when you are not using it. Be careful when using 
public hotspots and encrypt your connection using a VPN when 
using insecure Internet connections.
•	
Keep a written record of the make, model, serial number, MAC 
address, and other pertinent information about your portable device 
in case it gets stolen.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

52
Online Tracking Techniques
Web tracking is used to record the web browsing behavior of users when going online. 
This activity is conducted by different parties for different purposes. For instance, social 
sites can track their users across many websites. This information can be later associated 
with each user social account—for example, a Facebook account—to show personalized 
advertisements and services.
In this section, we will introduce you to how online tracking technologies work. This 
knowledge is essential to understanding how you should conceal your identity later to 
avoid being tracked when conducting OSINT searches.
Tracking Through IP Address
The first technical thing you need to understand is the concept of Internet Protocol (IP). 
It is essential to understand this concept and how devices are connected to the Internet 
because most of the anonymizing techniques work by obscuring your real IP address to 
avoid tracking. Besides, you cannot protect your digital privacy without knowing how 
Internet devices are connected in today’s digital world.
What Is an IP Address?
An IP address is a unique address that computing devices use to connect to the Internet 
and to identify themselves and communicate with other devices in the IP network. This 
address is unique for each device in the IP network; hence, no two devices can have the 
same address within each network.
There are two standards of IP addressing already in use. The IPv4 standard is the 
most widely used one; it can accommodate up to 4.3 billion addresses. Apparently, this 
number is not enough, especially with the explosion use of Internet of Things (IoT) 
devices. This fact has resulted in another standard named IPv6, which can accommodate 
more than 7.9 ×1028 times as many addresses as IPv4.
When connecting to the Internet, you either use the same IP address each time 
(known as static IP) or use a different number each time (known as dynamic IP).
A static IP address is an address that is assigned by your Internet service provider 
(ISP) and does not change over time. This kind of address is usually used by business 
corporations, the public sector, and other IT providers such as email service providers.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

53
A dynamic IP address, on the other hand, is assigned dynamically by your ISP each 
time you connect to the Internet. It uses a protocol called Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP) to assign new IP addresses whenever you disconnect from the Internet 
or your router gets rebooted.
Note!  To determine whether you are assigned a dynamic or static IP address, 
open a command-line prompt. In Windows 10, press Windows + X and then click 
Command Prompt (Admin). Type ipconfig /all and then press the Enter key. Locate 
the line containing “DHCP Enabled” under your current network connection. If 
DHCP Enabled is set to Yes (see Figure 2-11), then you most likely have a dynamic 
internal IP address.
Figure 2-11.  Determine whether your PC is using a dynamic or static IP address. 
In this case, we’re using a dynamic IP address.
IP addresses come in two types: public and private IP addresses. A public IP 
address allows direct access to the Internet. A private IP address is a non-Internet-­
facing IP address on an internal network and is used to assign a private number to your 
computing devices in your home or office network to avoid exposing them directly 
online. For example, you can have one public IP address assigned to your router on 
your office network, and each of the computers, tablets, smartphones, and peripherals 
connected to your router (via a wired connection or Wi-Fi) get a private IP address from 
your router via DHCP.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

54
Note!  DHCP is a network protocol used on IP networks. It works by dynamically 
allocating IP addresses to a set of connected hosts based on a preconfigured pool 
of addresses.
How Is an IP Address Used to Track You Online?
Whenever you visit a website, conduct a search online, or access your social site account, 
your connection IP address will be made available to the connected site. Nearly all 
websites record their visitors’ IP addresses among other details such as date/time of the 
visit, pages visited and duration, user actions on the website, and much more. Knowing 
the IP address is also—almost—enough to figure out approximately your current 
geographical location.
Your ISP will also record your IP address. ISPs usually record the browsing history 
of their users and connect it with each user’s real identity (ISPs usually request a valid 
government ID to provide Internet connections for their customers).
Social sites—like Facebook and Twitter—track their users’ browsing history across 
many websites. For instance, Facebook’s Like and Share buttons and Twitter’s Tweet 
buttons are used to track a user’s online activities even if the user does not click them. All 
this information is stored in a separate log attached with each user’s social account ID—
Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter—to better target the user with customized ads. Storing 
such logs is dangerous because all your web searches and web history get connected 
to your real name. Many WikiLeaks revelations mention that intelligence agencies 
have different facilities to access giant IT providers’ user. Giant corporations are also 
interested in such data to exploit it for commercial gain. This means all your sensitive 
details will be exposed in one way or another.
Although tracking online users through their IP addresses is still the most prevalent 
method used by different actors, there are other advanced technical techniques that 
allow an outside observer to track a user’s online activities even without knowing the 
user’s IP address, and this what we will talk about in the coming section.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

55
Cookies
Cookies are small text files usually stored on the client computer’s browser. A cookie 
file contains information that is specific to a client computer in addition to the website 
name, expiry date, and a user ID number to distinguish the user from other visitors. 
Cookies allow a website owner to be able to recognize the visitor’s browser the next time, 
effectively allowing the website to offer a customized experience for its visitors.
Mainly there are two types of cookies already in use: session cookies and persistent 
cookies.
Session cookies are stored in a temporary location in the client browser and are 
removed when the user closes the web browser or logs out of the current session. Such 
cookies are usually used to remember user shopping cart information or to store data 
between multiple pages.
Note!  Most websites plant HTTP cookies to track site visitors or to remember 
a user’s credentials. This kind is less risky than persistent cookies and can be 
removed safely by using the standard browser function Remove Cookies.
Persistent cookies come in two main types: flash cookies and ever cookies. Persistent 
cookies are more persistent than HTTP cookies and contain information from other 
websites that is used to track a user’s online activities across multiple websites. With 
flash cookies, a cookie is stored within a specific folder on a client hard drive (not within 
the client browser like HTTP cookies). In other words, such cookies will not get removed 
when you use the standard Remove Cookies browser function. For security reasons, it is 
highly advisable to deactivate this kind of cookie and delete the currently installed one. 
You can achieve this by going to Control Panel ➤ Flash Player and selecting the option 
“Block all sites from storing information on this computer” (see Figure 2-12).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

56
Note!  FlashCookiesView (www.nirsoft.net/utils/flash_cookies_view.
html) is a small utility created by NirSoft that allows you to display a list of Flash 
cookies that exist on your system and delete them.
An ever cookie is another type of persistent cookies. This type of cookie is a 
JavaScript-based cookie that can survive even after the user deletes HTTP and Flash 
cookies from their machine. Fortunately, the browsers and anti-malware software 
applications that exist today are now able to detect and block ever cookies.
Note!  You should disable Java plug-ins or at least to set their security settings to 
a high level. To do so, select Control Panel ➤ Java; then go to the Security tab and 
select the option “Very high.”

Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

57
Digital Fingerprinting
A browser fingerprint is the set of technical information about the client OS and browser 
that can be used to distinguish a client machine online. Such technical information 
includes browser type, add-on installed, user agent, fonts installed, language settings, time 
zone, screen size, operating system (OS) version, and color depth, among other things.
Fingerprinting allows trackers to track a user’s machine even though cookies and 
JavaScript are disabled, and it allows them to distinguish a client machine among 
millions of connected devices. You may think that such technical information is generic 
and cannot be used to recognize a specific computing device. We’re afraid you are 
wrong because when such information is combined, you can draw a comprehensive 
unique picture about each user machine, and later, this information can be linked to a 
real identity if combined with other sensitive personal information (SPI) such as name, 
Social Security number, or phone number. This should effectively allow different outside 
parties to easily profile people without using traditional tracking techniques such as 
computer IP addresses and cookies.
There are two main types of device fingerprinting: script-based techniques and canvas.
Script-Based Fingerprinting
This type works by loading a script—usually a JavaScript (Flash, Silverlight, and Java 
applets are also used)—into the user’s browser. This script will execute and collect 
technical information about user browsers and machine technical specifications such as 
screen resolution, CPU type, and other details about the targeted system. A hash is then 
made based on the collected information that is later used to identify and track your 
computer like an IP address.
The main defense against this technique is to disable JavaScript in your browser. 
However, this approach is not practical and may result in breaking many websites (the 
majority of web design frameworks are based on JavaScript to deliver functionality).
Canvas Fingerprinting
Canvas is an HTML element used to draw graphics (lines, shapes, text, images) and 
animation on web pages using the JavaScript API. This technique is exploited by 
different actors—especially advertisers—to fingerprint browsers to profile people and 
track them online.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

58
Canvas fingerprinting works by drawing an invisible image on the user’s client 
browser. Once drawn on the client browser, the image will collect different technical 
information about the user’s browser and OS. A hash is then created based on the 
collected information. This enables online trackers to track user online activities across 
different websites based on this hash, which is unique for each user’s client machine.
Browser fingerprinting is a powerful tool for tracking users across many websites. 
This type of tracking (also known as stateless tracking) raises serious privacy concerns 
since it is hard to detect and non-computer-savvy users may find it difficult to counter 
such techniques.
HTML5
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. It comes with new features that can be exploited to 
track users online. For instance, the HTML5 Web Storage feature—which is used to store 
offline contents on user machines—can be used to store tracking code like cookies do.
Checking Your Digital Footprint
Fingerprinting is currently considered the greatest risk that faces users when surfing 
online. We cannot conduct secure OSINT searches without fully understanding this risk 
and working to avoid it. In the following section, we will show what your current digital 
fingerprint shows to the public by using two free services.
Browserleaks
Browserleaks (https://browserleaks.com) is a web security testing tool that shows you 
what personal identity data may be leaked without your permissions when you surf the 
Internet.
Panopticlick
Panopticlick (https://panopticlick.eff.org) is a research project created by the 
Electronic Frontier Foundation (https://www.eff.org/). It will analyze how well your 
browser and add-ons protect you against online tracking techniques.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

59
Secure Online Browsing
Earlier you learned how browsers can leak personal identifying information about 
you and your machine. In this section, we will cover how to configure your browser to 
become more private in addition and offer advice and tools to conceal your real digital 
fingerprint.
There are many desktop browsers; the market share is mainly divided between 
Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Google Chrome. 
IE and its successor Edge come preinstalled on the Windows OS; however, we always 
encourage users to use open source software to assure maximum security when working 
online. Mozilla Firefox is still considered the only true open source browser of the main 
browsers mentioned, so in this book, we will cover how to make this browser more 
private.
Note!  The Epic browser is developed by a group called Hidden Reflex and 
promotes privacy worldwide; this browser is based on Chromium (like Google’s 
Chrome browser) and comes with enhanced security features to eliminate  
online tracking. It also comes with a free built-in VPN to conceal your  
IP address and protect your online communications. You can give it try at 
­https://epicbrowser.com/index.html.
Configuring Firefox to Become More Private
In this section, we will give basic tips to secure your online browsing when using Firefox.
Turning On Private Browsing
When you enable private browsing in Firefox, the browser will not record your visited 
pages, cookies, temporary files, and searches. Firefox will also activate tracking 
protection, which will block online trackers from monitoring your browsing history 
across multiple websites. To enable private browsing in Firefox, open the Firefox browser, 
and press Ctrl+Shift+ P. A new private browsing window will appear (see Figure 2-13).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

Changing the Firefox Settings to Become More Private
There are many tweaks to make your Firefox browser more private. In this section, we 
cover the main one.
Access the Firefox options by clicking the menu in the upper-right corner of your 
browser and selecting Options (see Figure 2-14).
Figure 2-13.  A new private session window opened in the Firefox browser
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

61
Move to the Privacy tab. You need to turn on the option Use Tracking Protection in 
Private Windows. Now, go to the History section on the same page and select the option 
“Never remember history” so that Firefox will delete all your history every time you close 
it. Finally, go to the Location Bar section and disable all the suggestions in the search 
bar because the suggestion process can leak excessive data about you. Your Privacy tab 
should look like Figure 2-15.
Figure 2-14.  Use an anonymous secure search engine that does not track your 
online activities
Figure 2-15.  Configuring the Privacy tab in the Firefox browser for better privacy
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

62
Move to the Security tab and configure it like in Figure 2-16.
Figure 2-16.  Configuring the Security tab to stop phishing and dangerous websites
Go to “Privacy & Security” tab ➤ “Firefox Data Collection and Use” pane and disable 
the following options: Allow Firefox to send technical and interaction data to Mozilla and 
Allow Firefox to send backlogged crash reports on your behalf. We are using for this step 
Firefox Quantum edition—version number 61. Crash reports can contain valuable data 
about your computer status that can make you vulnerable if it falls into the wrong hands, 
so it is better to disable them.
While you are still on the Advanced tab, go to the Network subtab, and make sure 
that the option “Tell me when a website asks to store data for offline use” is selected. This 
prevents websites from planting a tracking code on your computer.
Now that you have finished configuring the basic settings of Firefox to make it more 
privacy-friendly, you need to move to the advanced settings to continue your work. 
Access the Firefox advanced settings page by typing about:config in the URL address 
bar of your browser. A warning message will appear; hit the button “I accept the risk!” to 
access the advanced settings panel.
To access a specific setting, you need to type its name in the Search box that appears 
at the top of the page. To begin, let’s change the first setting named browser.formfill.
enable to false (double-click to change the settings value). This forces Firefox to forget 
form information (see Figure 2-17).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

63
Now, in the same way, you need to change the following settings:
•	
Change browser.cache.disk.enable to false.
•	
Change browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl to false.
•	
Change browser.cache.offline.enable to false.
•	
Change dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled to false.
•	
Change geo.enabled to false.
•	
Change network.cookie.lifetimePolicys value to 2.
•	
Change plugin.scan.plid.all to false.
These advanced configurations will “harden” Firefox and make it more difficult for 
outside parties to track your activities. In the next section, we will cover privacy add-ons 
that can further secure Firefox and fight against online tracking and user profiling.
Firefox Privacy Extensions
A selection of the best Firefox extensions (see Table 2-6) that help you to maintain your 
online privacy will be mentioned here. Please note that some add-on providers may 
fool users and collect private data about browsing habits and even personal information 
without their consent, so it is advisable to avoid installing any add-on except the 
ones mentioned in this section. Also, if a new reliable add-on appears later (say after 
publishing this book), ensure that it comes from a reputable trusted developer and 
install it from https://addons.mozilla.org exclusively.

Fighting Against Digital Fingerprinting and Browser Leak
We’ve already covered a good amount of information on how to make your web browser 
more resistant to fingerprinting. Despite all these techniques, we cannot guarantee a 100 
percent technical solution to stop this privacy invasion. The best solution is to access the 
Internet using a freshly installed of the Firefox browser. This will effectively make your 
browser look like most browsers’ fingerprint! To make things more hidden, install your 
web browser within a virtual machine. This will also conceal your current machine—
hardware and software—configurations. Of course, you still need to use a VPN to encrypt 
your connection and conceal your IP address.
Secure Online Communication
In this section, we will show you how to use different techniques to conceal your real IP 
address and to make your connection encrypted so it is hard to intercept. Please note 
that the term privacy is different from anonymity, although they are interrelated in many 
ways. So, in this context, VPN and proxy servers will help to mask your traffic; outside 
observers will see that there is traffic originating from your computer, but they cannot

see what is passing (for example, ISPs and governments cannot see which websites you 
are visiting). In addition, all the websites you are visiting—and the applications you are 
using—will not see your real IP address. In anonymity, an outside observer should not 
be able to know the source of the connection; hence, they cannot attribute your online 
activities to you. Both privacy and anonymity are important for any OSINT analyst and 
should be fully understood before you begin your OSINT work in the rest of the book.
VPN
A VPN allows a user to establish a secure connection from one site to another across the 
Internet (see Figure 2-18). It is widely used in corporations to access remote sites while 
assuring the confidentiality of sensitive data. The VPN also gives users anonymous IP 
addresses, making them appear as if in another location so they can avoid censorship, 
share files with other people privately, and more. Nowadays a VPN is a necessity for 
anyone who cares about their privacy when going online.
Figure 2-18.  How a VPN works (source: www.DarknessGate.com)
VPN vendors offer varying features. You should care about the following features 
when selecting your VPN provider:
•	
Do not subscribe to VPN service providers that are based in one of 
the following countries: United States, United Kingdom, Australia, 
New Zealand, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Norway, 
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

66
Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, Israel, Sweden, and of course 
countries such as Russia, China, Iran, and all Arab states. The best 
providers are based in Switzerland and follow its jurisdiction.
•	
A VPN provider must have its own DNS server; it must also support 
DNS leak protection (more on this next).
•	
It is preferred that the VPN software support the OpenVPN software. 
This is an open source program that can be audited by anyone to 
assure it’s vacant from any backdoors.
•	
It should accept anonymous payments such as bitcoin, gift cards, 
debit cards, and cash.
•	
It is better to support multiple devices at the same time so you can protect 
your tablet and smartphone data in addition to your laptop or PC.
•	
It should not require many details to set up; a username and a 
password should be enough.
Note!  If your ultimate purpose is anonymity and plausible deniability, use the Tor 
Browser instead of a VPN.
Proxies
A proxy server is an intermediary computer that sits between your computing device 
and the Internet. Corporations use proxies to filter content and to offer a level of security 
by separating a corporate local network from the Internet. There are different kinds of 
proxies; the main type is the web proxy that most Internet users mean when using the 
term proxy. Its main function is to fetch online resources—whether it is a page or a file—
from the Internet and then send them to your computer. They also provide anonymity 
by changing the real IP address of the user’s computer into the IP address of the proxy 
server (see Figure 2-19).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

67
Numerous free proxy servers are available online. However, we strongly recommend 
that such services are not used. A free proxy usually shows advertisements in your 
browser, which may introduce malicious software or other tracking scripts that could 
infect or compromise your machine if you click a malicious link. In addition, most free 
proxies are not secure enough to trust to process and communicate your critical data, 
such as credit card details and account passwords.
DNS Leak Test
Using a VPN—and other anonymity services—does not guarantee that your web 
browsing history will not get revealed. Sometimes even though you are protecting your 
connection using a VPN, a connection leak can occur and reveal the real IP address 
without you being aware. Such a leak occurs when part of your computing device traffic 
(DNS traffic) is not routed through the secure channel of the anonymity service you are 
using and hence the VPN. Instead, it gets directed to your ISP’s Internet servers (see 
Figure 2-20), allowing them to potentially monitor and log the complete web browsing 
history, even though you’re using a VPN.
Figure 2-19.  How a proxy server works (source: www.GarknessGate.com)
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

68
To ensure that your VPN provider is not vulnerable to this risk, you are strongly 
advised to test your connection directly after connecting to your VPN provider, as 
follows:
	 1.	 Go to https://www.dnsleaktest.com.
	 2.	 You will see two buttons along with your current IP address. The 
first button is labeled “Standard test,” and the second is “Extended 
test.” Click the second button for detailed results.
	 3.	 The detailed results page will show you a list of all the DNS 
servers (along with their locations) that are used to resolve your 
typed website URLs into IP addresses. If any of these servers 
are not related to your VPN provider company, this means your 
connection is leaking information about you.
Figure 2-20.  How a DNS leak occurs (source: www.darknessgate.com)
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

69
Reputable VPN providers have a connection leak prevention mechanism. However, 
you need to make sure that your VPN provider has this feature enabled automatically for 
your connection.
Warning!  Always do DNS leak testing, as explained, to assure that your DNS 
traffic is tunneled through your VPN-encrypted tunnel and not through your ISP.
Online Anonymity
When working online to collect OSINT sources, it is vital to remain completely 
anonymous. VPN allows you to mask your IP address and scramble the transferred 
contents to and from your PC. However, the VPN provider can intercept all your 
communications in plain sight. For mission-critical tasks, it highly advisable to use 
anonymous networks (e.g., Tor, I2P, and Freenet). This allows you to conceal your 
identity when surfing or publishing information online. In the following section, we will 
cover the Tor Network, which is considered the most used anonymous network today.
Using the TOR Network
Tor is the most popular anonymous network currently used online; it is mainly 
composed of these two parts:
•	
The piece of software you run on your machine to access the Internet 
anonymously
•	
The Tor Network of volunteer computers that direct your online 
traffic
Tor enables users to achieve a high level of online anonymity by encrypting both the 
data and the destination IP addresses prior to sending them through a virtual circuit, 
which consists of many nodes (no fewer than three nodes at any given time). Each node 
then decrypts part of the data to reveal only the next node in the circuit to direct the 
remaining encrypted data to it. The next node performs the same function until the 
message reaches the final node, called the exit relay. The exit relay decrypts the data 
without revealing the source IP address, sending it on to its destination (see Figure 2-21).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

70
Note!  The term node is used to describe any server working as part of the Tor 
Network of relays. Sometimes people use different terms for the node such as 
server, relay, or router.
When using Tor to anonymize your location, it will use the exit relay IP address 
instead of your real IP address as the source IP address. This will effectively conceal your 
identity online.
To use the Tor Network to begin your OSINT searches, all you need to do is to 
download and use the Tor Browser.
Tor Browser
To access the Tor Network, download the Tor Browser from | https://www.torproject.org/ 
projects/torbrowser.html.en. The Tor Browser is a security-hardened Firefox browser 
that requires no installation on the client machine; you can safely run it from your USB 
drive. It comes with the Tor software that allows you to access the Tor Network transparently 
upon launching this browser without any extra configuration (see Figure ­2-­22).
Figure 2-21.  How the Tor Network works
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

71
Figure 2-22.  Successful launch of the Tor Browser
Please note that only websites visited through the Tor Browser will get routed 
through the Tor Network anonymously; other browsers and applications already 
installed on your device will not use the Tor Network.
Hiding Tor Usage
An important point that should be carefully considered is hiding the usage of the 
Tor Browser from your ISP. This step is essential because using Tor Browser could 
be considered suspicious and even illegal in some countries. Other countries—and 
ISPs—may forbid access to the Tor Network. This will make using the Tor Browser more 
difficult for novice users.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

72
Detecting Tor usage is feasible using a variety of technical methods. However, in this 
section, we will introduce some techniques to conceal your Tor usage to a large extent, 
which makes detecting it difficult.
Using a VPN
You can hide Tor usage from your ISP by using a virtual private network service. The VPN 
will create an encrypted tunnel between your machine and the VPN server. Once that’s 
initiated, you can launch the Tor Browser, which will be hidden from your ISP to a large 
extent.
Using Tor Bridges
Bridge relays (or bridges for short) are Tor relays that aren’t listed in the main Tor 
directory. Bridges are considered entry points to the Tor Network. Since there is no 
complete public list of them, even if your ISP is filtering connections to all the known Tor 
relays, it probably won’t be able to block all the bridges.
Please remember that this method may not fully guarantee that your ISP will not 
detect your Tor usage, but it will make discovering this fact difficult and will require 
sophisticated techniques to uncover. To get Tor bridges, do one of the following:
•	
Go to https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges and get your 
bridges.
•	
Send an email to bridges@torproject.org with the line “get bridges” 
by itself in the body of the email. You must send this email from one 
of the following email providers: Riseup, Gmail, or Yahoo.
Now, you need to configure the Tor Browser to use these bridges. To do so, follow 
these steps:
	 1.	 To enter bridges into the Tor Browser, launch the Tor Browser, and 
before the Tor Browser connects, click the Open Settings button 
(see Figure 2-23).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

73
	 2.	 A Tor Network Settings window appears; click the Configure 
button.
	 3.	 Tor asks you whether your ISP is blocking or otherwise censoring 
connections to the Tor Network; click Yes and click Next to 
continue.
	 4.	 In the next wizard window, select the option “Enter custom 
bridges” (see Figure 2-24). Copy the bridges you have from step 1 
or step 2 and paste them in the box; click Next to continue.
Figure 2-23.  Accessing Tor Network settings before launching the Tor Browser
Figure 2-24.  Entering custom bridges into the Tor Browser
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

74
	 5.	 The next wizard asks you whether your computer sits behind a 
proxy server; in our case, you don’t need one (which is the most 
common). Select No and click the Connect button to continue. If 
you are sitting behind a proxy server, select Yes, then enter your 
proxy settings, and finally click Connect.
If everything works as expected, the Tor Browser will open using the customized 
bridges.
As we have already introduced, using customized Tor bridges may not fully mask 
your entry to the Tor Network. Some countries use a deep packet inspection (DPI) 
technique to analyze Internet traffic flows by protocol to examine whether they contain 
Tor traffic. However, using customized bridges is still a good way to circumvent Tor 
censorship and conceal its usage in many countries.
Using Pluggable Transports
To work around the DPI censorship technique, Tor has introduced the pluggable 
transport (PT). This technique transforms the traffic between your computer and the 
bridge into typical Internet traffic, thus hiding your Tor usage from your ISP. To use a 
pluggable transport, do the following:
	 1.	 Launch the Tor Browser and click the Open Settings button before 
Tor starts.
	 2.	 Click the Configure button, select the Yes option when asked 
whether your ISP blocks or censors connections to the Tor 
Network, and click Next to continue.
	 3.	 Select the option “Connect with provided bridges” and select a 
bridge from the Transport Type drop-down menu (see Figure 2-25).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

75
	 4.	 The final wizard window will ask you whether this computer sits 
behind a proxy server. In our case, it does not, so you can select 
the No option and click the Connect button. If you are sitting 
behind a proxy server, select Yes, enter your proxy settings, and 
click the Connect button.
If everything goes well, the Tor Browser should now be able to load successfully.
Warning!  What should you do to stay anonymous when using the Tor Browser?
1.	
Do not install add-ons in your Tor Browser such as Flash Player, 
Adobe Reader, and QuickTime Player. Such extensions tend to open 
independent connections outside the Tor circuit, and this will leak 
your real IP address.
2.	
Do not open PDF files or play Flash video within your Tor Browser.
Figure 2-25.  Connecting to the Tor Network using a pluggable transport to 
conceal your Tor usage
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

76
3.	
If you are exchanging sensitive data through the Tor Network, make 
sure to encrypt it first. The Tor exit relay—which is used to establish 
the connection with the destination—is not encrypted. If an intruder 
sits at that location, he can intercept your connection.
4.	
Make sure when using the Tor Browser to not use your real identity 
to register or post comments on websites. Of course, as an OSINT 
analyzer, keeping your identity secret is the main reason to use the 
Tor Network.
Using the Tails OS and Other Security OSs
Sometimes you may want to achieve the highest anonymity possible through using a 
specialized OS that directs all Internet traffic through the Tor Network. The Tor Browser 
is more than enough for concealing your identity when conducting regular OSINT 
searches; however, when working on sensitive cases or exchanging information with 
other parties, it is necessary to use an anonymous OS.
Tails is a Linux security-hardened OS that uses Tor as its default networking 
application. It is considered the best anonymous OS currently available, and for the 
record, this is the OS that Edward Snowden used to help stay anonymous during the 
initial NSA spying leaks. You can use Tails to communicate privately with confidence in 
extremely hostile environments.
Tails is portable. Hence, you can execute it from within your USB stick drive, and it 
is fully independent of the host machine. Tails runs using the host machine’s RAM and 
does not copy any files to the resident host machine’s hard disk.
Tails achieves its anonymity by forcing all network connections to go through the 
Tor Network. If an application tries to connect to the Internet directly, the connection 
is automatically blocked. Tails leaves no traces on the host machine’s hard disk. Upon 
shutdown, Tails will delete all user files, unless explicitly asked not to (persistent 
storage). Tails comes with many cryptographic tools that allow you to send encrypted 
emails and have secure IM chats.
We will cover installing and using Tails in Chapter 3.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

77
Sharing Files Securely
Sometimes you may want to share files privately with other parties located in another 
location. This is especially important for any OSINT analyst who may need to request 
and share information with colleagues to support a case. There are numerous file-­
sharing services, but the majority are not built to be completely anonymous. They 
usually require an account to share files and store some information (also called 
transaction metadata, which includes uploader and downloader IP addresses among 
other things) about each transaction happening through them. Such a thing is not 
suitable for investigators working on sensitive legal cases. In this section, we will 
introduce a secure file-sharing service through the Tor Network; it is considered the 
most anonymous solution to exchange private files online.
OnionShare
OnionShare is an open source tool that uses the Tor Network to share files anonymously. 
You can share any type and size of files. Your shared files will not get uploaded to the 
Internet. Instead, they will remain on your computer, which plays the role of a hosting 
service. All you need to do to share files is to share the URL given by the tool to the 
person you are corresponding with who should access it using the Tor Browser.
To use OnionShare, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Download and install the program from https://onionshare.org.
	 2.	 Launch the tool and select the files/folders you want to share. 
Make sure your Tor Browser is launched and connected to the Tor 
Network.
	 3.	 After selecting which files/folders you want to share, click the 
Start Sharing button. OnionShare will create a hidden Tor service 
for your shared files hosted on the Tor Network and will give you 
a URL to send to your correspondent. You can get this URL by 
clicking the Copy URL button (see Figure 2-26).
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

78
	 4.	 Your correspondent must access the shared URL through the Tor 
Browser.
	 5.	 Your OnionShare program and the Tor Browser should remain 
open until your correspondent finishes downloading your 
shared files. When the recipient receives your file successfully, 
OnionShare will stop the sharing process automatically. (To stop 
sharing automatically after the recipient receives the file, you must 
enable the option “Stop sharing automatically” in the OnionShare 
program before sharing files.)
Note!  For security-conscious people who want to share sensitive files, we advise 
you to use the Tails OS when sharing files through the OnionShare program.
Figure 2-26.  OnionShare provides a URL for your shared files, sends it to the 
recipient, and keeps it private
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

79
Making Anonymous Payments
As an OSINT analyzer, during your search for OSINT sources, you may encounter 
websites that request you pay a fee to see some resources (mainly gray literature). 
This frequently happens when requesting academic papers or a corporation’s internal 
documents. The same thing applies when buying anonymity services online (e.g., paying 
for a VPN provider anonymously). As you know, you may be part of a legal investigation 
and do not want to reveal your real identity when investigating some types of resources. 
In such cases, it is necessary to pay for such services anonymously.
In ordinary cases, when you purchase something online, your name, credit card 
information, and other transaction details will be available to the online merchant. 
Your credit card issuer and the bank will also know about your transaction details, and 
no one can guarantee how long these details will remain stored and whether any third 
party (e.g., advertisement agency) may have access to it. To purchase digital goods 
and services online anonymously, you can either use a gift credit card or pay using 
cryptocurrency.
Prepaid Gift Card
Major credit card providers offer prepaid cards for their customers. Such cards do not 
require any personal information to set up; they also do not require the existence of a 
bank account to work. Such cards are available in drugstores and supermarkets and 
are used specifically to purchase digital goods like VPNs and other anonymity services 
(although please note that not all websites accept such cards).
There are different types of prepaid cards. What we care about for this book is the 
anonymous type, which is the “nonreloadable” card. This card comes preloaded with 
a specific amount of cash—usually less than $500. You can purchase them with cash 
(which is untraceable) without revealing any personal information; even your e-mail 
address is not required.
Warning!  Do not buy prepaid credit cards online. If you buy a prepaid credit card 
online, you need to pay for it using some form of nonanonymous payment like an 
ordinary credit card, a bank check, or PayPal. In addition, you need to supply your 
postal address to receive the card (if it is a physical plastic card). This will link the 
purchased credit card to your real identity.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

80
Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that is designed to work as a medium of 
exchange using cryptography to secure the transaction and to control the creation of 
additional units of currency. There are hundreds of cryptocurrency types already in 
use; the most famous is still the bitcoin system. You can find a list of currently available 
cryptocurrency at https://coinmarketcap.com.
Bitcoin (https://bitcoin.org) is a decentralized and unregulated peer-to-peer 
payment network (like the Torrent network) that is powered by its users with no central 
authority or middleman. Bitcoin is a digital system; it is not printed like ordinary 
currency (dollars and euros) and is created by people and companies using a specialized 
open source software program called a bitcoin wallet (the wallet can be an online 
service; hence, it is called an e-wallet). Bitcoin does not charge fees on transactions, and 
it is nonrefundable (once you send bitcoin to a recipient, it will be gone forever unless 
the recipient returns the bitcoin to you).
We will not delve deeply into the technical side of the bitcoin digital currency and 
how to set up an account to buy products using it because it is out of the book’s scope. 
What you should know about bitcoin is that you can make anonymous purchases using 
this currency that are near impossible to uncover. In the following list, we will give you 
some reputable online sources to understand how this currency works.
•

•	
Bitcoin wallets: https://blockchain.info/wallet
•	
Bitcoin wallet programs: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Clients
•	
Buy bitcoin anonymously with cash using ATM machines:  
https://coinatmradar.com
Bitcoin payments are extremely anonymous; however, there is a bit of a learning 
curve for buying and exchanging bitcoin.
Before moving on, consider the following when conducting anonymous purchases online:
•	
Encrypt your online connection before making an anonymous 
payment. When paying anonymously online, make sure to 
anonymize your connection using an anonymizing network like Tor 
or I2P. Paying anonymously without masking your IP address will 
expose your technical connection details to different parties, and this 
may lead to revealing your identity.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

81
•	
Registering for anonymity services, like a VPN, and even conducting 
some online purchases using an anonymous payment method may 
require users to supply their e-mail address as part of the transaction. 
Make sure not to use your primary email address; instead, use a 
temporary email address for such tasks.
Encryption Techniques
Encryption provides a robust set of techniques to ensure secure transactional sensitive 
data flows online, thus preventing hackers and cybercriminals from accessing sensitive 
content, even if they succeed in capturing the transmitted encrypted data. The 
mathematical formulas involved in today’s cryptographic standards are enough to 
prevent most attackers from decrypting stolen data. In this section, we will present some 
tools and advice that helps you to keep your confidential data private by encrypting it.
Securing Your Passwords
Make sure to secure your online accounts using strong, complex passwords. It is also 
highly recommended to change your password every three months. There are many 
free tools to aid you in the password generation process. Such tools will produce highly 
secure passwords that contain a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Here is a 
list of some of these tools:
•	
Free Password Generator (https://www.securesafepro.com/
pasgen.html)
•	
PWGen (http://pwgen-win.sourceforge.net)
Many websites offer online password generation services. However, we prefer not to 
use such services because your password can be intercepted while traveling to your PC.
To store your passwords, you should use a security program to keep them safe; using 
a password manager program is essential to keep all your passwords in a safe location. A 
password manager encrypts the database that contains your credentials and protects it 
with a master password. This is the only password you must remember.

Encrypting Your Hard Drive/USB Sticks
Encrypting data becomes essential in today’s digital age as it considered the last line of 
defense if an attacker successfully gains access to your confidential data. In other words, 
encryption will be your last hope to prevent the compromise, use, or disclosure of your 
sensitive information to the public or to your enemies.
Keeping stored information on a hard drive secure is easy when using encryption 
software. For instance, Windows provides a built-in encryption utility that is available 
for most of its versions (Windows 7 and beyond) called BitLocker. Using this utility is 
easy; all you need to do is to right-click the drive you want to encrypt and select Turn on 
BitLocker (see Figure 2-27). A wizard will appear that walks you through all the steps to 
configure your drive encryption (setting a password and storing a recovery key).
Figure 2-27.  Activate BitLocker on a Windows box
There are many reputable disk encryption software applications that provide disk 
and even OS partition encryption.
VeraCrypt (https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) is supported on all major 
OSs. It can encrypt hard drives including OS partitions and USB stick drives. VeraCrypt 
also creates encrypted vaults that can be used to store data and then transfer it into a 
USB stick or send it over the Internet securely. You can check the documentation section 
for how to use this tool in different scenarios.
DiskCryptor (https://diskcryptor.net/wiki/Main_Page) offers encryption of all 
disk partitions, including the system partition. It is supported only on Windows OS.
Cloud Storage Security
Most people are using cloud storage to back up and store their sensitive data 
(such as documents, personal pictures, contact lists, address books, and the like). 
The many security incidents that have taken place lately with major cloud service 
providers shows that their security measures alone may not be enough to stop such 
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

83
compromises. To counter such risks, don’t rely on the cloud service provider to secure 
your data. Always encrypt your data before uploading it to the cloud and make sure to 
have a backup copy stored somewhere else when dealing with sensitive data. Here are 
two programs that can be used to secure your data before uploading it to the cloud:
	 1.	 Duplicati (https://www.duplicati.com) uses AES-256 or GPG to 
encrypt your data before sending it to the cloud.
	 2.	 Cryptomator (https://cryptomator.org) uses AES-256 to 
encrypt your data and uses SCRYPT to protect against brute-force 
attacks. It works by creating an encrypted vault—a virtual hard 
drive—on your local machine that encrypts everything inside it 
before uploading it to the cloud provider.
Please note that compression programs like 7-Zip (www.7-zip.org) and PeaZip  
(www.peazip.org) also offer encryption features, so you can compress and protect your 
files with a password before uploading it to the cloud.
Secure E-mail Communications
Whenever an e-mail is sent, it should be encrypted to assure the integrity and 
confidentiality of its contents. In today’s digital age, e-mail becomes the main means of 
communications for both individuals and public/private organizations, and breaching 
this communication medium would have a serious consequence. E-mail data breaches 
occur daily to assure that the contents of your emails are secure, so you should use 
encryption software.
Detailing how to incorporate encryption in your e-mails is beyond this book’s scope. 
However, in this context, you should understand that when sharing information with 
colleagues (e.g., as part of your OSINT investigation) through e-mails, you should take 
care to encrypt it first. In this section, we will give you resources and tools to learn how 
to do this. However, if you want to understand the ins and outs of e-mail encryption, 
you should check out our book Digital Privacy and Security Using Windows: A Practical 
Guide (Apress, 2017).
•	
Gpg4win (GNU Privacy Guard for Windows) allows you to create 
cryptographic keys (public and private keys), encrypt files and 
folders, and sign your e-mails before sending (digital signature). 
Gpg4win is the official GnuPG distribution for Windows and can be 
found at https://www.gpg4win.org.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

84
•	
Another implementation of the GnuPG project to be used on other 
platforms can be found at https://www.gnupg.org/download/
index.html.
•	
Mozilla Thunderbird can be configured to use GnuPG on all 
major platforms through installing the Enigma add-on, which 
adds OpenPGP message encryption and authentication to the 
Thunderbird e-mail client. It features automatic encryption, 
decryption, and integrated key management functionality.
Note!  You can direct your Thunderbird e-mails through the Tor Network by using 
an extension for Mozilla Thunderbird called TorBirdy. According to its creators 
(it belongs to the Tor project), TorBirdy is still in beta release and should not be 
used to secure communications in extremely hostile environments. You can 
find information on how to install and use this extension at https://trac.
torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy.
A browser extension is available for both Firefox and Google Chrome called 
Mailvelope that can be used with most web e-mail services. It allows its users to 
exchange encrypted e-mails using the OpenPGP encryption schema. You can either 
generate your key pair or import existing one (for example, from Kleopatra). You can 
use this extension without installing any tools except the extension on your browser. It 
is open source and available at https://www.mailvelope.com/en. However, we do not 
recommend encrypting messages within web browsers because this will make them 
more vulnerable to cyberattacks that regularly hit browsers.
Secure E-mail Providers
If you prefer to use a webmail for some of your tasks, it is advisable to use a secure end-­
to-­end e-mail provider that offers extended security features for your e-mail account. For 
instance, ProtonMail (https://protonmail.com) is different from other regular e-mail 
providers in many ways. It is based in Switzerland and follows its jurisdiction, which is 
considered the best one in the world in terms of protecting user privacy. ProtonMail uses 
two passwords to protect your e-mail account. The first one authenticates your account 
credentials on the server, and the second decrypts your inbox within your web browser 
or app, meaning that it never goes online to the ProtonMail server. If you are exchanging 
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

85
e-mails with another ProtonMail user, you can safely set your emails to destroy itself 
within a time limit in addition to sending encrypted e-mails to other ProtonMail users. 
It is especially useful to destroy sensitive e-mails automatically on both sides of the 
communications.
Finally, if you want to use an e-mail for only one time (for example, to activate some 
services anonymously), you can go with any of the following two services:
•	
https://hidester.com/temporary-email
•	
https://www.guerrillamail.com
Secure IM and Online Calling Services
IM conversations are another form of communications that you may need to protect. 
No one can guarantee that giant IT providers that offer free IM, voiceover IP, and video 
conference services do not log your chat—or at least the metadata of the conversation 
such as date/time and login IP address—for some period. We cannot discuss the security 
features of each available application in this book. However, we will focus on the security 
feature that makes one application more secure than the rest. For instance, most VoIP and 
chatting applications work the same way. They encrypt the messages exchanged between 
the people involved in the conversation, but they do not encrypt the message metadata.
The best secure VoIP/IM application is one that has the following technical 
characteristics: it should be open source so its code can be audited by independent 
security experts, it should not offer/show ads or any type of commercial advertisements, 
the provider and hence the app should not store the decryption key on its server so no 
one can request the key to decrypt user data, it should not store any metadata about the 
user connection, and the user contact list should not be stored on the app server and if 
necessary it should be saved encrypted. It should offer clear options to choose what you 
want to backup before sending it to the cloud provider.
The following are some popular secure and well-supported messaging apps:
•	
Tor Messenger (https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/
wiki/doc/TorMessenger): Although it still in beta version, this is 
considered the best secure IM chat. Traffic is directed through the Tor 
Network for maximum anonymity.
•	
Cryptocat (https://crypto.cat/security.html): This is an open 
source secure messaging application, it encrypt all communication 
by default and allows for secure sharing of files online.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

86
•	
Signal (https://whispersystems.org): This is a secure messaging 
and VoIP app; it is easy to use and offers similar functions as 
WhatsApp and Viber Apps. This app runs on Android and iPhone 
devices only.
•	
Ghost Call (https://ghostcall.io): This is an end-to-end encrypted 
calling service.
•	
ChatSecure (https://chatsecure.org): This IM program works only 
on iOS when it is configured to use OTR over XMPP.
Virtualization Technology
Use virtualization technology to enhance your privacy and protect your host machine 
from malware and other security threats. A virtual machine allows you to have a virtual 
operating system that behaves like a full, separate computer. You can use virtual 
machines to execute programs, open e-mail attachments, test programs, and visit 
dangerous websites safely without being afraid of malware affecting your operating 
system because the virtual machine will run in a sandbox isolated entirely from its host 
machine’s operating system. Online investigators can use virtual machines to conduct 
their online investigations securely, and they can use freshly installed browsers to mask 
their digital fingerprint, making it appear like millions of similar browsers. Finally, they 
can delete the entire virtual machine to clear any digital traces that may be left on the 
host machine!
These are the most popular two virtual machines:
•	
VMware Player (see Figure 2-28) (www.vmware.com/products/
player/playerpro-evaluation.htm)
•	
Virtual Box (https://www.virtualbox.org)
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

87
You can also use portable programs that do not need to be installed to run. Such 
programs will usually leave a little trace on the host machine, but it is still considered a 
way to minimize your digital footprint online.
Using a bootable USB token or live CD/DVD when working on sensitive documents 
is also a great practice to hide your digital traces. Running the Tails OS (https://tails.
boum.org) in offline mode is a great practice. There are many tools that can help you to 
create a bootable USB/CD drive. The following are some of them:
•	
Windows USB/DVD download tool (https://wudt.codeplex.com)
•	
Rufus (https://rufus.akeo.ie)
•	
WinBuilder (http://winbuilder.net)
Figure 2-28.  Multiple OSs can be installed on each virtual machine; this image 
shows seven OSs installed within one instance of the VMware program
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

88
Windows To Go is a new feature available in Windows 10 (Enterprise and Education 
editions only). It allows you to run the complete Windows 10 Live feature from a USB 
drive without needing to install it on your computer’s hard drive. You can access this 
feature from Control Panel ➤ Windows To Go. This feature allows you to take your 
Windows box with you wherever you go, but bear in mind that some Windows 10 
features may not work when using the Windows To Go operating system.
Android and iOS Emulator
An emulator allows you to run the Android application on your computer as if it were 
on your smartphone. There are numerous reasons why an online investigator may want 
this to happen; maybe he wants to test the functionality of a specific app or simply wants 
to gather some information using a feature that is available only for smartphone apps. 
The protective measures to stay anonymous can be implemented more easily when 
running such applications—using an emulator—on your computer rather than on your 
smartphone. For instance, using a VPN and accessing resources using Tor anonymously 
is more convenient using a computer with a mouse. The same can be achieved with 
smartphone apps when running on a computer using emulators. Here is a list of the 
most popular emulators for both Android and Apple OS:
•	
Andy (https://www.andyroid.net)
•	
ARChon (https://github.com/vladikoff/chromeos-apk/blob/
master/archon.md), Google Chrome
•	
MEmu (www.memuplay.com)
•	
MOBIONE STUDIO (http://download.cnet.com/MobiOne-Design-­
Center/3001-2247_4-75910775.html), Apple apps
Essential Prerequisites
In this section, we will list some of the supporting software and methods that can aid 
an investigator for preparing the gathered OSINT data into usable formats for further 
analysis.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

89
Drawing Software and Data Visualization
Drawing software—including mind mapping—and other data visualization tools help 
online investigators visualize their findings, make search plans, and avoid forgetting 
something during the gathering process; they also present the final results in a clear 
manner. In this section, we will focus on the best free programs/services available for 
aiding OSINT investigators in completing their mission.
Mind Mapping and Idea Generation Tools
When conducting OSINT gathering, it is better to use some tools to organize your 
findings. The following are some popular tools for drawing diagrams and charts, taking 
notes, and creating mind maps to visualize your results.
FreeMind
FreeMind (http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) is the 
most popular free mind-mapping software. Using this tool, you can draw different 
diagrams that visually organize information.
Storytelling Tools
These tools help you to create a timeline for your OSINT gathering. Here are some 
popular free solutions:
•	
Story Map (https://storymap.knightlab.com)
•	
Visual Investigative Scenarios (https://vis.occrp.org)
Diagramming Software
The following are some tools for diagramming.
Apache OpenOffice Draw
Apache OpenOffice Draw (https://www.openoffice.org/product/draw.html) allows 
you to draw different technical and business process diagrams.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

90
Google Drawings
Google Drawings (https://docs.google.com/drawings/create) is a free cloud-based 
diagramming tool developed by Google.
Note Management
Here are some tools for note management.
TagSpaces
TagSpaces (https://www.tagspaces.org) is an offline, open source, personal data 
manager that helps you organize files on your OS—Windows, Linux, Android, or Mac—
using tags and notes to files/folders.
KeepNote
KeepNote (http://keepnote.org) is an open source cross-platform program for 
organizing your notes and to-do list. You can attach different media—like such as and 
videos—to your note making it more informative.
Data Visualization
Here are some tools for data visualization.
Microsoft Excel
This helps you to summarize large amounts of data and present it in charts/tables and 
other graphical visualizations. Microsoft Excel is proprietary software by Microsoft.
Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools
Business Intelligence and Reporting Tools (https://www.eclipse.org/birt/about) is 
open source software that helps you to visualize data and create reports based on it.
Dradis CE
Dradis CE (https://dradisframework.com/ce/) is an open source reporting and 
collaboration tool for InfoSec professionals; it allows you to combine the output of different 
tools like Burp, Nessus, Nmap, and Qualys to create a single report for a specific case.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

91
Bookmarking
When working on collecting OSINT sources, you will encounter a large sum of useful 
online resources. To handle this large volume of data, you need a method or tool to 
organize your favorite web pages. All web browsers have a built-in feature to organize 
favorites; we already recommended Firefox as a preferred web browser for conducting 
OSINT searches. The built-in bookmarking organizer associated with Firefox is enough 
to organize your work. However, it is preferable to use it efficiently by associating your 
bookmarks (see Figure 2-29) with tags and grouping related bookmarks in one folder. 
Firefox also gives you the ability to export your bookmarks to an HTML file so that 
you can import this HTML file into another browser later. To export your bookmarks 
in Firefox, select Bookmarks ➤ Show All Bookmarks ➤ Import and Backup ➤ Export 
Bookmarks to HTML.
Figure 2-29.  Organizing Firefox favorites
There are plenty of online bookmarking managers; however, we found storing 
bookmarks using online services is not a good thing for the secrecy of the OSINT 
investigation.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

92
Free Translation Services
During your OSINT searches, you will encounter useful resources in other languages 
that you do not understand—for example, Arabic. Online instant translation services 
offer a great aid to understand these foreign resources to add them to your case data. 
The following are some free translation services:
•	
Google Translate (https://translate.google.com)
•	
Bing Translator (https://www.bing.com/translator)
•	
Babylon’s Free Online Translation ­(http://translation.babylon-­
software.com)
•	
Systranet (www.systranet.com/web)
Final Tips
Finally, we want to give you some tips for you to follow before you begin your online 
OSINT research.
Use a False Identity to Register on Some Websites
While you are conducting your OSINT searches, some websites may require you to 
register or create a free account to use its service or to access some sections. Make sure 
not to use your real personal information; you should also have a specialized e-mail 
address (preferably on Gmail) for this issue with fake information. The same thing 
applies when opening fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social 
networks to conduct your OSINT searches.
Warning!  Some social sites prohibit creating fake accounts; it is always 
advisable to read the rules before you sign up. However, for people working in the 
intelligence arena, it is unlikely that they will obey such terms!
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

93
A fake identity generator can generate everything you need to become a new digital 
citizen. This includes phone, website, e-mail, username, password, account security 
questions, fake credit card and Social Security numbers, occupation, company, physical 
traits, and more. Here is a list of the most popular identity generation websites:
•	
www.fakenamegenerator.com
•	
https://names.igopaygo.com/people/fake-person
•	
www.elfqrin.com/fakeid.php
Be Anonymous
Enable your VPN service—or simply use the Tor Browser—before you begin your OSINT 
search. If you are not using Tor, make sure to use a virtual machine that has a freshly 
installed web browser within it to collect online resources. Make sure that your VPN 
connection is enabled for all applications installed on your machine including your 
virtual machine instance.
Destroy Your Digital Traces Upon Finishing
Use virtual machines and browse the Web using Firefox incognito mode. Make sure 
to use tools such as BleachBit (https://www.bleachbit.org) to wipe clean your 
applications’ digital traces in addition to any remnants left on hard drive.
Use Linux
Many powerful OSINT tools work on Linux-based systems. These tools are available 
on Kali Linux (the successor of Backtrack), although many of these tools have been 
imported into Windows. You can download Kali from https://www.kali.org and 
install it on a virtual machine. Mastering the Kali Linux distribution is essential for any 
penetration tester and digital forensic investigator. Kali comes equipped with a plethora 
of out-of-the-box security tools.
Chapter 2  Introduction To Online Threats and Countermeasures

94
Summary
In this chapter, we prepared the stage before you begin your OSINT search. We talked 
about different online threats and how you can counter them through security software 
as well as best practices when using computing devices. We covered some OS-hardening 
tips focusing on Windows as it is still considered to have the largest user base worldwide.
We talked about how online tracking works technically by listing its types and 
gave countermeasures to prevent outsiders from tracking your online activities. Then 
we moved on to talking about secure online browsing; we gave hardening tips for the 
Firefox browser as well as useful privacy add-ons. Using VPN to encrypt online traffic 
is important for any Internet user; we briefly described the concept of a VPN and proxy 
server and then gave important hints on how to use them safely to avoid leaking your 
real IP address without your knowledge even though you are using a VPN service. The 
anonymity section is essential before conducting OSINT searches; you should not do any 
OSINT search without activating an anonymity service or a VPN. We talked about using 
the Tor Browser to surf the Web anonymously. For people who live in extremely hostile 
environments, using the Tails OS—which directs all your Internet traffic through the Tor 
anonymity network—is strongly advisable.
Virtualization technology comes in handy when you want to test other applications 
or you want simply to cover your digital traces on the host machine. Virtual machines 
also help you to lower your digital footprint when conducting your research online as 
you can use a standard OS and web browser installation to make your search and finally 
delete the entire OS in one click.
This was a long chapter full of advice on how to deal with today’s online threats. 
Understanding online threats, countermeasures, and how to become anonymous 
online is essential before beginning your work to harvest OSINT resources online. The 
rest of the chapters in this book are dedicated to OSINT search techniques. In the next 
chapter, we will delve beneath the surface of the ordinary Internet to explore the hidden 
underground Internet, known as the deep web.

CHAPTER 3
The Underground Internet
How well do you know the Internet? Being a regular Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram 
user and knowing how to use Google to find stuff online will not make you a super 
Internet user because you are just scratching the surface of the Web. Most web content is 
hidden and needs special methods to access it.
According to Internet World Stats, the number of Internet users in the world on June 
30, 2017, has reached 3,885,567,619. (The world’s population is 7,519,028,970 people.i) 
This is a huge number, and it is predicted to increase to 4 billion Internet users by 2020. 
Most Internet users worldwide are using the surface web—also known as the ordinary 
Internet. Only a tiny percentage of Internet users use the other hidden layers of the 
Internet on a daily basis or have even heard about them!
In August 2017, the total number of live websites belonging to the surface web was 
1,800,566,882,ii while the estimated number of Tor websites on the darknet from March 
2016 to March 2017 was about 50,000 to 60,000. Despite the huge number of websites 
within the surface web, Their contents -which can be indexed by typical search engines- 
constitutes only 4 percent of the whole Web, while the rest belongs to the deep web 
portion (which includes the darknet).
In this chapter, we will introduce you to the terms deep web and dark web. Both 
terms are used to point to the part of Internet that is hidden from an ordinary Internet 
user’s sight and cannot be indexed by typical search engines. Deep web contents can be 
accessed using the regular HTTP/HTTPS protocol and typical web browsers; however, 
this is not the same for the darknet, which needs special software to access its contents. 
Before beginning our discussion, let’s first differentiate between the three terms—
surface, deep, and dark Internet.

96
Layers of the Internet
Let’s begin with the ordinary Internet or the surface web. This is the portion of the Web 
that includes all the contents that are readily available to the public. Websites on the 
surface web can be indexed using regular search engines such as Google so a user can 
find them easily.
Search engine providers use software known as web crawlers to discover publicly 
available web pages. Crawlers work by clicking hyperlinks inside pages and then sending 
these pages (results) to search engine servers that organize the results in a search index. 
The search index contains hundreds of billions of indexed pages. Finally, a user submits 
a search query, and the search engine responds by ranking pages that match the user 
query and returning an ordered list (see Figure 3-1).
Figure 3-1.  How search engines index websites (source: www.darknessgate.com)
Note!  If you want to understand how search engines index websites, Google 
offers a simple tutorial describing this issue. You can find it at https://www.
google.com/search/howsearchworks/.
As of November 2017, Google is aware of about 130 trillion pages. The numbers 
change continually because of the fast-changing nature of the Web.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

97
As mentioned, search engine web crawlers discover new pages through clicking 
links. However, this method is not perfect, and a vast volume of data will remain 
unindexed as search engines crawlers cannot reach them through web crawlers.
As an example, say you want to know the Canadian dollar exchange rate in the 
year 2000. There are many websites that offer currency exchange rates over time. So, 
for this example, you go to the www.xe.com website to see the Canadian exchange 
rate in the year 2000. But wait, there is a problem here. If you want to act as a regular 
search engine crawler, you can only click hyperlinks! But this will not give you the 
result you need. However, if you act as a human and went to the search form at  
www.xe.com/currencytables and entered the specific search date (2000/01/01) 
and clicked the Submit button, then the website would retrieve the historical result 
from its database and present it to you (see Figure 3-2). This result cannot be fetched 
using conventional search engines because it requires you to use a search box on the 
website and enter a search query to retrieve it. The fetched result is a clear example of 
deep web content.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

98
Many Internet users—and even some experts—use the terms deep web and darknet 
synonymously, but there is a difference between them. The term deep web describes all the 
online resources that are not indexed using conventional search engines such as Google, 
Bing, or Yahoo, but the deep web can still be accessed like any regular website using the 
standard HTTP/HTTPS web protocol and typical web browsers without using any special 
software. Any Internet user has certainly used some type of deep web while browsing the 
Internet; however, most users may not know that such resources belong to the deep web.
Deep web resources are usually buried within databases accessible to online public 
view, but the user needs to type a query (for example, into a web search form) or use a 
Figure 3-2.  Historical data extracted from a website’s database is an example of 
deep web data
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

99
drop-down menu to set some search values to retrieve the contents of these databases. 
This is what makes its contents hidden; it cannot be seen by typical search engines because 
it cannot be accessed through hyperlinks. The same thing applies to websites that require 
registration (username and password) to access content and websites that are purposefully 
designed to keep search crawlers out. Encrypted networks and websites that require 
payment to view content also fall under the category of the deep web. No one can know 
the accurate volume of deep web websites because of the ever-changing nature of web 
content, but many studies suggest that it is approximately 500 times that of the surface web.
Here are some examples of major deep web websites:
•	
The Library of Congress (https://www.loc.gov) This is the largest 
national library in the world, it includes a huge collections of 
resources -like books, photographs, newspapers archive, maps and 
manuscripts- in different topics.
•	
Vital Records (www.vitalrec.com) gives access to U.S. birth 
certificates, death records, and marriage licenses.
•	
Science.gov (https://www.science.gov) gives access to more than 
200 million pages of authoritative federal science information.
•	
Alexa (https://www.alexa.com) gives detailed analytical information 
about websites.
•	
Directory of Open Access Journals (https://doaj.org) gives access 
to high-quality, open-access, peer-reviewed journals.
•	
The Online Books Page (http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu) 
gives free access to more than two million books that are accessible 
(and readable) on the Internet.
As you already saw, finding content on the deep web is not a straightforward task for 
a typical user, and most of the valuable deep web contents must be extracted manually. 
However, there are many approaches to simplifying this task:
•	
Specialized search engines: This includes any search engine that 
helps you locate deep web content within one subject or more. The 
following are some examples:
a.	 https://www.doi.org helps you to resolve the digital object 
identifier (DOI) of any publication.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

100
b.	 https://www.100searchengines.com contains specialized 
search engines for almost any topic online. It allows you to 
search multiple search engines at the same time (although 
searching multiple search engines at the same time may omit 
some results because not all search engines use the same 
mechanism to fetch data from their index).
c.	 https://books.google.com/?hl=en is one of the biggest deep 
web databases that contains millions of books. Google includes 
results from this database when conducting regular searches.
d.	 www.academicindex.net is a scholarly academic search 
engine accessing only a selected set of websites that are 
specialized in academic and research papers.
e.	 https://www.truthfinder.com searches social media, photos, 
police records, background checks, contact information, and 
more. The result will be fetched from TruthFinder’s database 
of deep web sources.
•	
Web directories: A directory is a website that shows a list of websites 
organized into categories. A user enters a search query, and the 
directory gives the user the relative subjects to the entered query. 
Each subject may contain hundreds and even thousands of websites 
that fall into that category. To browse a directory, a user selects the 
topic and then moves down from the broadest to the narrowest. 
Some directories are paid, while others are free and maintained by 
a community of volunteer editors. Web directories are smaller than 
search engines as they are maintained by humans, unlike search 
engines, which are mainly maintained by spiders (web crawlers). The 
following are some famous web directories:
a.	 https://www.hotfrog.com.au is the largest online business 
directory; it lists 120 million businesses in 38 countries.

Internet of Things (IoT) search engines: The term Internet of Things 
is used to describe any device that can connect to the Internet and 
can collect and exchange data. The list of devices includes routers, 
servers, traffic lights, cell phones, coffee makers, washing machines, 
headphones, lamps, wearable devices such as watches, security systems 
including alarms, Wi-Fi cameras, baby monitors, smart refrigerators, 
smart TV sets, smart air-conditioning systems that can adjust the 
heat remotely, and almost anything else you can imagine that can be 
connected to the Internet and controlled remotely. Shodan (https://
www.shodan.io) is a sophisticated search engine that specializes in 
searching Internet-connected devices through finding where they are 
located and who is using them. Shodan collects data mostly on these 
ports: HTTP (80), FTP (21), SSH (22), Telnet (23), and SNMP (161). 
Shodan allows both individuals and corporations to secure their IoT 
devices by discovering which one is vulnerable to outside attack or 
misconfiguration (for example, still uses the default manufacturer 
username and password). This search engine can be used effectively to 
find information about active IoT devices worldwide.
Now, we have reached to the third layer of the Web. This is the deepest one and 
called the darknet. The darknet—or dark web—is an online resource that has been 
designed purposefully to be hidden and anonymous. The darknet forms a small part of 
the deep web, but unlike the deep web, this one cannot be accessed using typical web 
browsers. It needs special software to access it such as Tor (short for The Onion Router).
Darknet—or anonymity—networks are composed of collections of computers 
spread all over the world that form a decentralized web. These anonymity networks form 
collectively what is known as the darknet. Users can access these networks to surf the 
Web anonymously or to visit the anonymous hidden websites within these networks.
Individuals get to the darknet for various purposes, and a significant number of them 
are unlawful. While there are no accurate statistics on the quantity of illicit sites (called 
Tor services or hidden services on the Tor Network), the Intelliagg group in 2015 reviewed 
more than 1,000 samples of Tor hidden services and found that 68 percent of Tor darknet 
contents are unlawful.iii Criminals are not only visiting the darknet to look for illegal 
products but are utilizing it as a medium to anonymize their online correspondences 
and keep others from following them when utilizing the surface web. Still, even though 
most darknet websites are associated with illegal activities, many people utilize it for 
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

102
legitimate purposes (for example, using a Tor Browser to conceal a user IP and machine 
digital footprint when surfing the ordinary Internet). 
There are different anonymity networks. The following are the most popular:
•	
Tor Network (https://www.torproject.org/index.html.en)
•	
I2P network (https://geti2p.net/en/)
•	
Freenet (https://freenetproject.org/index.html)
As you already saw, deep web resources can be found by searching for them within 
target websites or by using specialized search engines, directories, and other online 
paid services that offer access to nonfree contents (such as gray literature). The same 
thing does not apply to the darknet. As an OSINT analyst, you need to understand where 
to start your darknet investigations and how to access and search within the darknet. 
OSINT investigators usually use darknet networks—especially the Tor Network—to 
browse the surface web anonymously. This will effectively help them to conceal their 
online activities from outside observers (see Figure 3-3). The rest of this chapter will 
explore what the darknet is and how to access and exploit its resources.

Darknet Users
Darknet has a bad reputation for being the preferred place for malicious actors to 
conduct their criminal activities online. The following are some bad actors:
•	
Drug dealers exploit the anonymity feature of the darknet to conduct 
their illegal sales safely.
•	
Arm dealers use the darknet for illegal buying and selling of weapons.
•	
People buy false government papers (such as passports and national IDs).
•	
Black hat hackers use it to download and share exploit tools; sell ready-­
to-­launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware, 
and security exploits; and offer espionage services to customers.
•	
Terrorists use the darknet to share information and trade unlawful 
goods in addition to concealing their activities on the surface web.
•	
Gambling and betting websites are on the darknet.
•	
Sellers of stolen information—such as corporate secrets, credit card 
numbers, and the personal information of people obtained during 
fraudulent activities—use the darknet to sell their stolen information 
to interested parties.
Even though many darknet sites are directed toward criminal activities, there are 
many legal uses for the darknet. Some of these include the following:
•	
Human rights activists, journalists, and whistleblowers use it to reveal 
secret contents to the public without uncovering their identity.
•	
Privacy advocates use the darknet anonymously away from 
governments and corporate surveillance.
•	
Law enforcement uses the darknet for different purposes (e.g., 
tracking criminals and collecting information about them).
•	
Individuals, governments, and corporations use anonymity networks 
as a secure medium to exchange top-secret information.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

104
•	
Intelligence services and military organizations use the darknet to 
gather open source intelligence information and to counter terrorism 
activities.
•	
Business corporations may monitor darknet forums and blogs to see 
their own leaked proprietary information.
Maybe you wonder how traders do their business anonymously on the darknet. The 
answer is simple. Every dark website accepts payment via bitcoins. We already covered 
the concept of cryptocurrency in Chapter 2; bitcoin (https://www.bitcoin.com) is the 
most popular one and can be used to conduct online money transactions anonymously.
Accessing the Darknet
The Tor Network is the most popular anonymous network in the world, so we will focus 
on it in this chapter to describe the darknet. However, before we begin, remember the 
essential precautionary steps upon accessing the darknet.
Note!  Although accessing the Tor Network is considered legal in most countries, 
its usage can arouse suspicion with the law. And some countries consider 
accessing the Tor Network as an illegal practice that can lead to questions by 
authorities. A rule by the U.S. Supreme Court gives permission to the FBI to search 
and seize any computer around the world that is found using the Tor Network or 
even a VPN service.iv Make sure to read the section on how to conceal your Tor 
usage in the previous chapter.
Security Checks When Accessing the Darknet
Chapter 2 was dedicated entirely to personal cybersecurity; however, it is worth 
remembering the following main points before accessing the darknet (detailed descriptions 
on how each precaution works technically are available in the previous chapter):
•	
Make your entry to the Tor Network hidden by using pluggable 
transports, custom bridges, or a VPN before starting your Tor 
Browser.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

105
•	
Cover your webcam and microphone.
•	
Prepare your anonymous e-mail (like the Protonmail.com service) or 
use a free disposal e-mail service.
•	
Generate a false digital identity in case you need to register at some 
websites to access some locked contents. Make sure not to use any 
personal details that relate to you.
•	
Make sure that your Tor Browser is up-to-date to avoid leaking your 
real IP address—the Tor Browser will warn users to update it upon 
launch in case it becomes outdated.
•	
Make sure that your OS and antivirus software are up-to-date. 
The presence of a dedicated anti-malware software is highly 
recommended.
•	
Disable JavaScript on your Tor Browser by activating the NoScript 
add-on that comes preinstalled with the Tor Browser (see Figure 3-4).
Figure 3-4.  Disabling JavaScript on all websites before accessing the dark web
•	
It is advisable to change your online identity and hence the IP 
address for each visited site on the dark web, as in Figure 3-5. 
Selecting the New Identity option will require restarting the Tor 
Browser and lose the current session.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

106
•	
Do not download anything from the darknet to your computer, 
especially software and pirated media such as songs and movies.
•	
Be suspicious before clicking any hyperlink because you do not know 
who operates darknet websites and the destination that such links 
will take you to.
Accessing the Darknet from Within the Surface Web
Some websites offer a functionality to access the Tor hidden websites (hidden services) 
from within the surface web—using regular browsers—without using the Tor Browser 
or Tor software. The following list shows some websites that connect Internet users to 
content hosted inside the Tor Network. Bear in mind that accessing the darknet in this 
way does not guarantee that you can surf it as you would do with the Tor Browser. This 
method is more convenient—for a casual user—to surf the Tor Network easily. However, 
you will lose the anonymity that Internet users seek when using the Tor Browser in 
addition to making your browsing history susceptible to interception.

Warning!  If you want to access the darknet (Tor Network) from within regular 
web browsers using proxy websites, make sure to encrypt your connection first 
using a VPN.

Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

107
Using Tor
We already covered how the Tor Network works in Chapter 2; however, we will give you a 
brief description of how data flow works within this network.
Tor sends user requests across many relays (also known as a server or router); 
usually, at least three relays are used. The entire connection within these relays is 
encrypted. The first relay establishes the user connection to the Tor Network. This relay 
knows your current location, so it is advisable to use a VPN connection first to mask this 
or to use custom bridges/pluggable transports to mask your entry to the Tor Network 
from your ISP/government or any other outside adversary.
The second relay knows that the data is coming from the first relay, the third relay 
knows that the data is coming from the second rely, and so on. The last relay—also 
known as the exit relay—cannot know the origin of the data.
Tor relays do not record any activity pass through them, and all connections within 
these relays are totally encrypted. However, the weakest link resides on the last relay—
the exit relay—as this relay can intercept data flowing through it if it is not already 
encrypted. There are some cases when this relay got comprised by intruders to unmask 
Tor users and to sniff their unencrypted traffic.
To mitigate the risk of someone intercepting your data at the exit relay, you should 
encrypt everything before sending it across the Tor Network. The Tor Browser comes 
with an add-on named HTTPS Everywhere (https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) 
that forces your browser to encrypt your communication transparently—with major 
websites using the SSL protocol.
Websites hosted on the Tor Network end with the .onion extension. Unlike normal 
web addresses that end with .com or .net, Tor websites can be accessed only through the 
Tor Browser.
To access the Tor Network, all you need to do is to download and use the Tor 
Browser; you can always download the latest version from https://www.torproject.
org/download/download. Download the version that matches your current OS and 
then launch the browser. The Tor Browser is a hardened version of Firefox that comes 
occupied with the Tor software to enable transparent access to the Tor Network. The Tor 
Browser can also be used to browse the public Internet.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

108
If you do not know where to start after launching the Tor Browser, go to the hidden 
wiki (see Figure 3-6) at http://zqktlwi4fecvo6ri.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page. 
This site provides a directory of the most active darknet websites organized into 
categories. Bear in mind that some websites may not work instantly; however, this does 
not mean the darknet is offline. Many websites run for specific number of hours daily, so 
return and visit later.
Figure 3-6.  The hidden wiki—beginner entry to the darknet
Tor was primarily created to allow users to access regular (surface) Internet 
anonymously. This fact is considered a disadvantage for it when compared with other 
anonymity networks (like I2P, which was created as a stand-alone network within the 
ordinary Internet). For instance, the ability of a global adversary—with good resources—
to monitor Tor exit relays (where data leaves Tor to the surface Internet) can reveal the 
identity of Tor users if their activities have been successfully correlated to their entrance 
to the Tor Network (the first relay). To overcome this shortcut, Tor allows its users to have 
their own hidden websites that no one can track. As mentioned, websites hosted on the 
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

109
Tor Network are known as Tor services or hidden services and have the .onion extension. 
These sites are accessible only from within the Tor Network. Actually, you can run your 
own using your home computer, but you must know how to avoid revealing your true 
identity. Tor offers instruction on how to configure your hidden website at ­https://www.
torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en. The collection of Tor hidden 
websites is part of what is known as the darknet; indeed, the most popular sites within 
the darknet belong to the Tor Network.
Finally, a major drawback with the Tor Network is speed. Tor is notoriously slow. 
This because the traffic needs to go through no less than three relays before reaching 
the destination. Tor will slow down even more when a large number of users are using it 
simultaneously.
Using the Tails OS
In extremely hostile environments where there is a high risk of intercepting 
communications by outside adversaries, it is highly recommended to use the Tails OS 
for your top-secret communication and offline work. In this section, we will cover how 
to use this OS in some detail, showing you how to use it in both online mode and offline 
mode (offline mode allows you to create and read documents in a secure environment).
As we said in the previous chapter, Tails is a Debian GNU/Linux security-hardened 
OS that routes all network connections through the Tor Network. It comes equipped with 
many applications that are preconfigured with security in mind like the Tor Browser, 
secure IM chat, encrypted e-mail client, and encryption software in addition to its 
productivity applications like the Office suite. Tails is a portable OS that runs from within 
a USB or CD/DVD and loads directly into the host machine’s RAM memory; it leaves no 
traces on the host machine’s hard disk. Upon shutdown, Tails will delete all user files, 
unless explicitly asked not to. Tails can be configured to allow a user to store personal 
documents and program settings (persistent storage).
To install the Tails OS on your USB drive, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Download Tails from https://tails.boum.org.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

110
Warning!  Before you create the live Tails DVD/USB/SD card, you should check 
the integrity of the ISO image you have downloaded to ensure your copy of the 
Tails file is genuine. Always download Tails from its official website (https://
tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html). Do not download the Tails ISO 
image from any other mirrored location.
	 2.	 Download the Universal USB Installer from https://www.
pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3. 
This tool is used to install Tails into a USB stick drive.
	 3.	 Configure the Universal USB Installer as shown in Figure 3-7. You 
should have a USB drive with 8GB of free storage. Finally, click the 
Create button.
Figure 3-7.  Installing Tails on a USB stick drive
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

111
	 4.	 Change the boot sequence of the host computer to start from the 
USB zip drive. Each computer manufacturer has its own method 
to access the BIOS/UEFI; consult its website or computer manual.
	 5.	 Plug in your Tails USB stick and restart your host machine to start 
Tails. If Tails boots successfully, select the first option from the 
menu Tails to boot into the system (see Figure 3-8).
Figure 3-8.  Tails boot screen
	 6.	 When the Tails Greeter screen appears (this window allows you 
to select your language preference and keyboard layout), click the 
Start Tails button to access the Tails desktop.
Upon starting, Tails needs little configurations because everything is already set to 
work through the Tor Network (see Figure 3-9). All you need to do is to configure your 
Wi-Fi by entering the access point password; if you are connecting through a cable, no 
configuration is needed.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

112
You just installed Tails in read-only mode—also known as an intermediary. In this 
mode of installation, you will not benefit from important features such as automatic 
security upgrades or the ability to store some of your documents and configurations 
in encrypted storage. In the coming section, we will show you how to install Tails in 
a persistent storage mode so you can keep your program settings, bookmarks, stored 
documents, and notes while conducting your OSINT search activities.
To install Tails as persistent storage, you will need another USB stick with 8GB of free 
storage. Of course, if you are planning to store large files, use a higher-capacity USB drive.
	 1.	 Plug the second USB stick into the computer while the Tails OS is 
still running.
	 2.	 Go to Applications ➤ Tails ➤ Tails Installer to start the Tails 
Installer.
	 3.	 When Tails Installer launches, select the “Install by cloning” option.
	 4.	 Select the second USB drive in the Target Device drop-down list 
and then click Install Tails (see Figure 3-10).
Figure 3-9.  Tails desktop showing the Tor Browser launched
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

113
	 5.	 A warning message appears informing you that all data on the 
selected drive will get lost. Confirm your action, and Tails will 
begin the installation process, which may last for about three 
minutes.
Now, to access the new Tails, restart your machine while leaving the second USB 
stick plugged in—you should remove the first one. Start Tails as you did before.
To save some of your documents and configurations in an encrypted storage on the 
final Tails USB stick, you need to create an encrypted persistent storage. Follow these 
steps to create such storage. This storage will occupy the remaining space on your Tails 
stick drive.
	 1.	 Go to Application ➤ Tails ➤ Configure persistent volume. Select 
a passphrase to protect your encrypted data within the persistent 
storage.
	 2.	 Click the Create button to begin.
	 3.	 Upon finishing, Tails will ask what kind of files you want to store 
on the persistent volume. We recommend selecting Personal 
Data, Network Connection, GnuPG, and Browser Bookmarks.
Figure 3-10.  Select the target USB stick where you want to install Tails with 
persistent storage
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

114
	 4.	 Click the Save button, and Tails will reboot.
	 5.	 This time, the Tails Greeter screen will ask you whether you 
want to use persistent storage. Click Yes and then enter your 
passphrase.
	 6.	 You can now save your working documents in the Persistent 
folder. To open the Persistent folder, go to Places ➤ Persistent.
Warning!  Remember two points when working on persistent storage.
•	 Persistent storage is not hidden; if someone captures your Tails 
USB stick, they will be able to read it.
•	 The persistent storage folder can be opened in another OS; 
make sure to open it on a trusted secure computer to avoid 
compromising the Tails security.
Tails can be used in offline mode without an Internet connection if you want to read 
or create sensitive documents. To start Tails in offline mode, launch Tails. When you 
reach the Tails Greeter screen, in the Welcome to Tails window, click the Yes button. 
Then click the Forward button to enter advanced startup. The advanced startup window 
appears. Go to the bottom of the window and click the “Disable all networking” button. 
Then click the Login button.
Warning When Using the Tails OS
Tails is an excellent anonymous OS that uses the Tor anonymity network by default, but 
to stay completely anonymous when using this OS, you must be aware of any threats or 
attacks against the Tails OS that may result in your privacy being invaded while using it.
•	
Tails does not protect you against hardware-based attacks: Hardware 
keyloggers and other malicious software that infect the host 
computer firmware can intercept your communications stealthily 
even though you are using Tails.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

115
•	
Encrypt everything before sending it through Tor: As we mentioned 
previously, the Tor Network is an anonymous network. The link 
between Tor relays —within the network—is encrypted. However, 
once your data leaves the Tor Network, nothing is encrypted. Tails 
also does not encrypt your data by default before sending it through 
the Tor Network, but it offers ready tools for this task, and you should 
consider using them.
•	
Tails does not clear a digital file’s metadata by default: As mentioned 
in Chapter 2, metadata exists within most digital file types. Make sure 
to clear the metadata of digital files—images, Office files, videos—
before sending them online to avoid revealing your identity.
•	
If you are using Tails and live in an extremely hostile environment, you 
should take extra care when working online by separating your online 
identity into many identities: For example, use separate identities 
when you want to perform multiple actions online such as uploading 
a post to your blog, checking your e-mail, and replying to comments 
on a specific blog or website. To remain anonymous in such cases, 
you should restart Tails after doing each task previously mentioned. 
This will effectively make tracking you by a global adversary with 
great resources extremely difficult.
As an OSINT investigator, it is highly recommended to practice using the Tails OS 
and the Tor Browser before conducting your online investigations.
Searching the Tor Network
You will not find much useful information—similar to the surface Internet—when searching 
the darknet (Tor Network). This network is mostly directed toward illegal activities, and 
some websites may not always be available. However, it can still contain useful resources 
that can aid you in your online investigation. In this section, we will mention popular 
useful hidden services that can help you to find useful resources in the Tor Network.

Other Anonymity Networks
Other anonymity networks perform similar roles as the Tor Network. The second most 
popular anonymity network is I2P, covered next.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

117
I2P
I2P stands for the Invisible Internet Project; it was first released in 2003. It is an 
anonymity network like Tor, but it differs from it in many aspects, as you are going to see 
next. Before explaining how to use this network to access the darknet, we’ll first explain 
briefly the technical side of this network.
I2P is a decentralized peer-to-peer (also called client, node, or router) network built 
using the Java programming language. I2P allows you to host websites and access the 
darknet of I2P websites (also known as deepsites, which have an .i2P extension). It offers 
a wide range of applications such as anonymous web hosting, BitTorrent, e-mail, file 
sharing, and much more. In the I2P network, the communication between sender and 
destination—within the I2P network—is completely encrypted. Traffic usually passes 
through four layers of encryption before reaching the destination.
Using I2P
Now, we’ll begin explaining how to access the I2P network.
Note!  To run I2P on your computer, you must have Java already installed on your 
machine because I2P is written using the Java programming language. You can 
download Java from https://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp.
	 1.	 Go to https://geti2p.net and download the software version 
that matches your current OS.
	 2.	 After installing the software (I2P router), click the “Start I2P 
(restartable)” icon, which will bring up the router console using 
your default browser, which has further instructions to configure 
this network. If the router console does not pop up automatically, 
go to http://127.0.0.1:7657/home to view it.
	 3.	 It may take several minutes before I2P connects successfully to the 
network; a message labeled “Network OK” (see Figure 3-11) should 
appear on the router console. If another error message appears 
instead of it (such as “Network: Firewalled”), you need to check 
your firewall settings to allow a connection to I2P ports. We cannot 
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

118
describe the reasons /proposed solutions for all possible problems. 
You can always copy the error message and Google it to find the 
appropriate solution. Running I2P inside a virtual machine without 
installing a firewall is another option for non-tech-­savvy users.
Figure 3-11.  I2P router console view—“Network OK”
	 4.	 Now you need to configure your web browser to use the I2P 
network. We will describe how to do this for Firefox; other 
browsers use similar configurations.
	 5.	 Open Firefox Options ➤ General ➤ Network Proxy (located at the 
bottom of the page) and click the Settings button.
	 6.	 In the Connection Settings window, click the circle next to 
“Manual proxy configuration.” Then enter 127.0.0.1 in the HTTP 
Proxy field and 4444 in the Port field. Enter 127.0.0.1 in the SSL 
Proxy field and 4445 in the Port field. Be sure to enter localhost, 
127.0.0.1 into the “No Proxy for” box. Finally, click the OK button 
to accept the new settings (see Figure 3-12).
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

119
Warning!  Unlike Tor, I2P does not provide a mechanism to hide your entry to 
the I2P network from your ISP and government. However, once the connection is 
established, everything will become completely encrypted and anonymous.
I2P doesn’t go through Tor.
The previous configuration of Firefox allows you to use the normal Internet 
anonymously. In the same way, you can access any website hosted on the I2P 
anonymous network (such websites have a .i2p extension instead of .com or .org).
Figure 3-12.  Configure Firefox to use the I2P anonymity network
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

120
After successfully connecting to the I2P network and configuring your browser 
properly to use it, you can begin discovering this network. If you are stuck and do not 
know where to start, point your browser to the I2P wiki at http://i2pwiki.i2p.
When you first visit an I2P website, you may receive an error message stating 
“Website Not Found in Addressbook” because you do not have any I2P website 
addresses in your router address book. To solve this problem, you need to click one of 
the jump service links at the end of the page (see Figure 3-13).
Figure 3-13.  Accessing an I2P website for the first time—the visited website was 
not found in your router’s address book
Try to click each jump service link (boxed in Figure 3-13) until you find one that 
takes you to the page that allows you to add this website to the I2P router address book 
(see Figure 3-14).
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

121
After clicking “Save & continue” in the section “Save {Website Name} to router 
address book and continue to website,” the page shown in Figure 3-15 will redirect you to 
the intended website (ELGOOG.I2P in this example).
Figure 3-14.  Adding a new I2P website that has not been visited before to your 
router address book. The next time you visit this website, you will not see this 
message.

122
I2P vs. Tor
The main difference between Tor and I2P is how their designers perceived the threat 
model. For instance, Tor was primarily created to allow users to surf the surface web 
anonymously. I2P was created as a stand-alone anonymity network that enables fully 
anonymous communication between two parties within its network.
Tor uses a circuit-switching method to drive its data through the Tor Network, while 
I2P uses the packet-switching model. Circuit switching was originally invented for voice 
communication, and it was less suitable for data transmission. Tor uses a single path for 
data transmission, while I2P uses packet switching, which makes all peers participate in 
forwarding packets across the network. Unlike Tor, I2P uses two routes (tunnel) to direct 
inbound and outbound traffic. This will effectively improve the overall anonymity of the 
system and will make data delivery more flexible as each packet will take different routes 
to reach the destination, unlike Tor packets, which need to travel using a single path in 
both directions (the lifetime of each Tor circuit is ten minutes). I2P is faster when moving 
big files within its network than the Tor Network, which suffers from network congestion 
and service interruptions, as it uses only one route for data delivery.
Tor uses a directory structure to view the overall performance of the entire network, 
as well as gather and report statistics. Tor directories maintain a list of all Tor nodes 
and hosted hidden services on the Tor Network and are placed in the United States and 
Europe. The I2P approach is to use a decentralized peer-to-peer network where there is 
no single point to view the entire network, and each peer (router) locally maintains a list 
of all known routers (relays).
I2P uses Garlic encryption—which is a variant of Onion encryption—where multiple 
messages to different recipients are bundled together. This makes it harder for outside 
adversaries to analyze the traffic flow through the network and will also speed data 
transfer and make it more reliable.
Tor has more exit relays compared to I2P. I2P uses the term outproxy to name its own 
exit relay routers. The number of I2P users is smaller than Tor. This makes the number 
of I2P outproxies considerably smaller than Tor exit relays. This will effectively make I2P 
more susceptible to outside traffic analysis compared with the Tor Network, which owns 
a large number of exit relays.
Tor acts as a proxy server by using Secure Sockets (SOCKS), so any application  
(e.g., web browser, IM chat, or e-mail client) able to use SOCKS can be configured to 
use the Tor software directly. I2P uses its own API that must be implemented by any 
applications wanting to communicate through the I2P network. This makes I2P more 
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

123
secure and anonymous than Tor as its API is designed specifically for anonymity. 
However, applications should be adjusted to use it, and this is somehow costly and limits 
the number of applications that are ready to use the I2P network.
Finally, Tor is well funded. It has a large user base and more supporters from the 
academic and hacker communities compared with I2P network. This clearly appears 
from its website, documentation, and the other projects currently underway. Tor also has 
an advantage in being written in the C language, making it faster when running on client 
machines than I2P, which is written using Java and consumes more RAM memory.
To conclude, both I2P and Tor are excellent anonymous networks, but the context 
in which they are used determines which one is best in terms of performance and 
anonymity. For instance, I2P is preferred over Tor for hosting anonymous sites and 
for making communications within the I2P darknet as it is faster and gives stronger 
anonymity. Tor is preferred to anonymize your traffic when accessing the surface 
Internet, unlike I2P, which is almost unusable—and risky—for this task.
Freenet
Freenet is another anonymous network. It is a fully distributed, peer-to-peer anonymous 
publishing network. We will not cover how to use this network like we did with the 
previous ones. However, you can check out http://freesocial.draketo.de for a 
complete tutorial on how to use this anonymous network. Tor, I2P, and Freenet are the 
most popular anonymous networks currently available. Tor surpasses the other two in 
being more widely used and more mature. We recommend using the Tor Network for all 
your online work that requires anonymity.
Going Forward
As you saw during this chapter, searching for deep and dark resources is not 
straightforward. Current search engines are optimized to search the surface web 
and cannot search—and index contents—below it, even though some commercial 
companies that have developed some advanced search tools try to harvest data from the 
deep web (including dark web). The effectiveness of such tools is still limited in terms of 
retrieving accurate, linked, and complete results.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

124
Now, with the advance of computing technology and the widespread use of Internet 
services around the globe, more criminals are shifting their activities online. Black hat 
hackers, terrorist organizations, and countries controlled by oppressive regimes are also 
using the Internet—especially the darknet—to conduct illegal activities. Governments 
and law enforcement entities around the globe must utilize all resources possible to 
capture and prevent bad actors from using Internet technology to facilitate their crimes.
To help overcome these challenges, the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (DARPA) in the United States has created the Memex program to help fight 
against human trafficking activity across the world. Memex is a next-generation search 
engine that focuses on helping law enforcement investigators find online perpetrators 
engaged in human trafficking in the cyberspace. Memex has the ability to search within 
the darknet and deep web in addition to the surface Internet to find linked information 
spread everywhere online to support investigators in their mission.
Although the key mission of the Memex is to fight against global human trafficking, 
it can be used by intelligence services and other military organizations to collect and 
correlate useful OSINT information from the deep/dark web about anything they want.
Summary
The deep web and dark web have gained increased attention by researchers, law 
enforcement, and government entities. However, both terms are still unclear for most 
web users. In addition, the nature and technical architecture of darknet networks still 
lack clarity for many people.
In this chapter, we shed light on the concept of Internet layers and demonstrated by 
example the contents of each layer and how they can be accessed to retrieve information 
from them.
Two darknet networks were presented and compared. While Tor is a mature 
anonymity network with a wide user base and mostly used to browse the surface web 
anonymously because of its many exit nodes, I2P is beginning to get more attention as a 
preferred solution to host hidden websites inside the I2P darknet network because of its 
speed and stronger anonymity for both users and website operators.
Chapter 3  The Underground Internet

125
As we already said, many darknet websites are dedicated to illegal activities; it is not 
the purpose of this chapter to introduce you to such illegal services and teach you how 
to access them. We highly encourage a typical Internet user not to visit the darknet at 
all. The main point here is to introduce you, especially OSINT investigators, to how to 
use online anonymity tools like the Tor Browser and the Tails OS to conduct your online 
investigations safely and anonymously. The information presented in this chapter will 
also benefit online investigators when accessing and searching within the dark areas of 
the Internet.
This chapter was dedicated to the deepest layers of the Internet. In the next chapter 
we will return to the surface to teach you how to use advanced techniques using typical 
search engines such as Google and Bing to search for OSINT resources online.

CHAPTER 4
Search Engine Techniques
The number of Internet users is increasing steadily, as is the number of active websites. 
According to Netcraft’s January 2017 Web Server Survey, there are 1,800,047,111 billion 
websites.i The number of pages on these websites changes continually according to 
many factors. Google Inside Search estimates that there are more than 130 trillion web 
pages discovered by Google; about 50 billion of them have been included in Google’s 
searchable index as of October 2017.ii Do not forget that Google—and similar search 
engines—cannot index the entire Web, as pages that belong to the deep/dark web 
cannot be discovered by typical search engines.
As you can see, the number of web pages that exist is huge, and finding your way in 
this mass media would be very difficult without search engines. A search engine works 
by sending a crawler—automated software—to continually scan active websites to add 
the discovered content to its index, which is stored in massive databases. The user then 
queries the search engine index, which returns the results—that may contain a mix of 
web pages, images, videos, and other file types—as a list of matching sites ranked by 
relevance.
Without a search engine, a user would need to access and check every website 
manually when seeking specific information. This would be a daunting task and consume 
a considerable amount of time for each search. Search engines also help users view only 
relevant results. For instance, search engine software scans each indexed page and selects 
a list of keywords from it to categorize it. When a user, for example, searches for cheap 
flight to Hawaii, all pages that offer flights to Hawaii will appear in the search result list. 
However, the top rank will be for the pages/websites strictly related to user search criteria. 
Please note that the algorithm for ranking websites in search results is secret for each 
search engine provider, and the rank for each website—even for the same query—can 
change hourly. However, the highest rank will be for the websites that satisfy the ranking 
algorithm criteria in terms of popularity and relevancy of the user’s search query.

128
Typical search engines like Bing and Google offer their services free of charge. They 
also offer advanced search features that can be used by users to conduct advanced 
searches. For example, Google offers a powerful Advanced Search (https://www.
google.com/advanced_search) that gives more specific search results (see Figure 4-1).
Figure 4-1.  Google Advanced Search functionality returns more specific search results
The internal mechanism of search engines is not as simple as their interface. The 
more sophisticated the search engine, the more complicated the algorithm it uses to find 
and index contents from the Web. In this chapter, we will cover how to use different types 
of search engines efficiently to locate information online. We will start by focusing on 
Google because it’s considered the largest one and has plenty of specialized operators 
to conduct advanced searches (also known as Google dorks). We will also cover how to 
search for specific digital file types such as images and videos in addition to using many 
free online services to validate your findings. Before we begin, let’s cover how to select 
search keywords to return the most relevant results from search engines.
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

129
Keywords Discovery and Research
As an OSINT investigator, you need to master the art of online searching, which requires 
you to use the correct search keywords. Typical search engines discover and index 
web pages using a variety of criteria. Apparently the most important one is the set of 
keywords available within the target page.
Keyword discovery help searchers to expand the breadth of their searches to include 
different variations of the same keyword and uncover synonyms and semantically 
related terms and phrases so they can better find content that may be rarely accessed by 
typical users conducting similar searches.
Keywords discovery is used extensively by online marketers in search engine 
optimization (SEO) to see which keywords are used by different people—using 
different search engines—to search for a similar topic. Online investigators can use the 
same technique to search for variations of a phrase/keyword in addition to acquiring 
intelligence about current search trends.
The following are the most popular keyword research tools:
•	
Google Keyword Suggest Tool (http://tools.seochat.com/tools/
suggest-tool): This gives keyword suggestions for Google, Bing, 
Amazon, and YouTube.
•	
Google AdWords (https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/
keyword-planner/) and Google Trends (https://www.google.com/
trends): These will show search volume and matrices of Google 
searches for any geographical region in the entire world.
•	
One Look (www.onelook.com/reverse-dictionary.shtml): Enter a 
word, phrase, sentence, or pattern to search for related words.

Using Search Engines to Locate Information
In this section, we will show how to utilize search engines to get precise results, 
beginning with the giant, Google.
Google
The Google search engine is the leader among its peers and has the greatest market 
share with more than 77 percent of global search traffic using it.
The number of daily searches conducted by web users globally on search engines is 
huge. Table 4-1 shows the number of daily searches per search engine.iii
Table 4-1.  Number of Daily Searches by Major Search Engines

Other (AOL, Ask, etc.)
128,427,264
Most web users have used a Google web search to find something online. A Google 
basic search is what you see when visiting the Google home page (www.google.com). 
You type your search query into the Google search box and hit the Google Search 
button. Alternatively, you can use your voice to enter the search query by clicking the 
microphone icon. The Google home page offers other useful services such as searching 
for images, videos, newsgroups, and maps in addition to the Google Translate service. 
Let’s see how you can use some Google words to refine a basic search for better results.
Warning!  When using the following Google search words (symbols), make sure 
not to put any space between the symbol and the search term (query).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

131
	 1.	 To search within social media sites, use the symbol @ followed by 
a social media name; then enter a colon your search query. For 
example, enter @facebook:nihad hassan to search for the term 
nihad hassan within Facebook).
	 2.	 To search for hashtags, put a # sign before your search term. For 
example, enter #USAelection.
	 3.	 To search for an exact match, surround your search term/phrase 
with quotation marks. For example, enter “data hiding”.
	 4.	 The tilde (~) operator searches for the word that comes after 
it directly and for its synonyms. For example, entering Excel 
~guide will return Excel tutorials, tips, helper, video trainings, and 
anything synonymous with the word guide.
	 5.	 The OR operator in capital letters only—also written as a 
vertical bar (|)— is used to find pages that contain the searched 
terms. For example, entering Apress OR springer (or entering 
Apress|Springer) will retrieve pages that contain either the term 
Apress or the term Springer.
	 6.	 To exclude words from your search, put a minus (-) symbol in 
front of the word (phrase) that you want to leave out. For example, 
enter lacoste -animal.
	 7.	 To search for the unknown words, use the asterisk (*) to substitute 
it with one or more words. For example, enter data hiding in *.
	 8.	 Use the double dots (..) without spaces to provide a number range 
such as date, number, or price range. For example, enter USA 
earthquake 1980..2000.
	 9.	 To search for similar web pages, put the word related: in the front 
of the web address that you want to see similar pages of. For 
example, enter related:springer.com.
	 10.	 Use the word info: to return information that Google has about a 
certain domain. For example, enter info:springer.com.
	 11.	 Use the word define to find a definition of the supplied keyword. 
For example, enter define:information.
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

132
	 12.	 Use the word cache: to return the Google-cached version of the 
web page. For example, enter cache:apress.com.
	 13.	 To search for information about a specific song or movie, enter 
Music: or Movie: followed by the song or movie name.
	 14.	 To check the current weather in any place around the world, use 
the weather keyword. For example, enter weather:London.
	 15.	 To show the stock price of any company, use the keyword stocks: 
followed by the company ticker symbol. For example, entering 
stocks:MSFT will show stock information for Microsoft Corporation. 
You can fetch any company stock ticker symbol by going to 
https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/lookup.asp.
	 16.	 Use the keyword map: followed by location name and Google will 
show you map-­based results. For example, enter map:New York.
	 17.	 Enter time keyword to check the current date/time of your 
current location. To find the time of another location, precede the 
time keyword with the location name (for example, enter time 
New York).
Note!  http://localtimes.info shows an interactive map of the time 
around the world right now. www.thetimenow.com shows the date, time, and a 
calendar in addition to weather forecasts and more information about the current 
location. (The current location is detected using your connection IP address, so 
make sure to update your location if you are using a VPN service that masks your 
real IP address.)
	 18.	 Google also can be used as a converter between currencies and 
measures. For example, enter (190 cm in feet) or (1000 dollars  
in yen).
	 19.	 You can even check flight information using Google. Type your 
airline company name and the flight number in the Google search 
box and it will show you flight status information graphically  
(see Figure 4-2).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

133
Google is also famous for its image search. For instance, to search for a specific 
image, you can use the Google Advanced Image Search at https://www.google.com/
advanced_image_search, which allows you to set different image search criteria (such as 
size, color, type, etc.) to locate your target image.
Basic search is suitable for beginners, and you do not need to worry about the 
spelling or capitalization of your searched keywords because Google will fix this for you. 
However, when it comes to fetching relevant information related to a specific topic, you 
need to use the Google special operators to return information that is difficult to locate 
through simple search queries.
Google Advanced Operators
The advanced options are also known as Google hacking or Google dorks. Google 
hacking occurs when a user combines search keywords with advanced Google search 
operators to locate hidden information that is difficult to locate using a basic Google 
search. For example, Google hacking can be used to find vulnerable web servers 
or lists of personally identifying information (PII) files for employees/clients in a 
Figure 4-2.  Showing information for the American airline company, flight 10

134
specific company that could have been left on a company server without protection. 
Cybercriminals, black hat hackers, and even terrorists use this technique to collect 
sensitive data online to facilitate launching further attacks against the target.
In the following list, we show examples of advanced Google search operators 
beginning with the simplest. The general format is as follows: operator:search_term. 
(There is no space between the operator, the colon, and the keyword search).
•	
The site operator asks Google to search within one website or 
domain. For example, if you enter hide site:darknessgate.com, 
Google will search for the word hide within the darknessgate.com 
website only. Using the same operator, you can restrict your search 
within one domain type. For example, enter computer forensics 
site:gov to search for the term computer forensics in all websites with 
the .gov domain.
•	
Insert your query search term after the allintext operator and Google 
will restrict its search to all pages that contain the terms specified. 
For example, enter allintext:free SMicrosoft service and Google 
will only return the pages that have the three terms free and SMS and 
service within its text.
•	
Begin your search with the allintitle operator and follow it with your 
search terms. Google will only return the pages that contain your 
searched query in their titles. For example, enter allintitle:Nihad 
hassan to have Google return all pages that have nihad hassan in 
their title (the page title appears at the top of the browser window), as 
shown in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3.  Searching within page titles for a specific term
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

135
•	
If you use the allintitle operator in an image search, it will return 
images in files whose names contain the specified search query.
•	
Begin your search with the allinurl operator followed by your search 
term and Google will restrict its results to all the pages that contain 
your searched terms in their URL. For example, enter allinurl:OSINT 
intelligence and Google will return pages with the terms OSINT 
intelligence in their URLs (see Figure 4-4). You cannot include other 
search operators with the allinurl operator.
•	
When using the filetype suffix with your search terms, Google will 
restrict the results to web pages that end with this extension. For 
example, enter osint intelligence filetype:PDF and Google will 
return PDF files that match the specified search query.
•	
To search for more than one file type, add their extensions to 
the search query as follows: osint intelligence filetype:pdf OR 
filetype:doc. Google supports searching for different file types; the 
list of indexable file formats is available at (https://www.google.
com/support/enterprise/static/gsa/docs/admin/74/gsa_doc_
set/file_formats/file_formats.html).
All these examples are simple demonstrations of how you can use advanced Google 
search operators to return accurate relevant results. Online investigators should be 
creative and work to develop their search skills by utilizing different search operators in 
one statement to return the best results.
Figure 4-4.  Using the Google allintitle operator
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

136
Note!  Google Advanced Search (https://www.google.com/advanced_
search) allows users to use advanced search operators without typing them 
manually into the search box, although it still has limitations on conducting more 
creative searches. However, it’s still considered a great tool for casual users to 
search Google professionally.
Google Hacking Database
The Google Hacking Database (see Figure 4-5) created by Johnny Long contains 
hundreds of ready-to-use advanced Google search terms that can be used to acquire 
intelligence online. It can help you to find the following and more:
•	
Vulnerable web servers
•	
Files that contain sensitive information such as usernames/
passwords in addition to configuration files that contain settings and 
other important information from Internet devices
•	
Sensitive directories left without protection
•	
Error messages generated by servers, databases, and other software 
that can be exploited to invade information systems
•	
Information about network devices such as firewalls, IDS logs, and 
configurations
•	
Different IoT devices and the control panels of unprotected ones
•	
Hidden pages such as intranets, VPN services, and others
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

137
Here are some examples search terms that you can use on Google to find sensitive 
information online:
•	
“Index of /backup”: This will return a list of unprotected servers that 
contain backup data. Such files can contain sensitive information.
•	
“robots.txt” “Disallow:” filetype:txt: The robots.txt file usually 
resides within the root directory of a web server and instructs search 
engine crawlers on the parts of your website that you do not them 
to look at (in other words, that you want ignored from the indexing 
process). Hackers check robots.txt files to see the unindexed files to 
gain intelligence or to access sensitive locations.
•	
budget site:gov filetype:xls: This query will return all publicly 
accessible Microsoft Excel spreadsheets with the term budget from all 
websites that have the .gov domain name.

Search Engines Powered by Google
While Google is great at web searches, it does not have a clean record in terms of 
respecting a user’s privacy. Google and other giant IT providers monitor their users’ 
online activities to some extent to understand their browsing habits and thus target them 
with customized advertisements. Another disadvantage for using a Google search is the 
fact that Google records your previous searches and may omit some results from future 
searches if it finds them irrelevant to your browsing habits. This is dangerous for online 
investigations because it may limit the result set returned by Google, according to the 
searcher’s previous browsing history.
The Google search algorithm is considered the best one for returning relevant 
results. However, for privacy-conscious people, there are many search engines that 
retrieve their search results from Google without invading users’ privacy by collecting 
information about their searches. These are the most popular ones:
•	
StartPage (https://www.startpage.com)
•	
Lukol (https://www.lukol.com)
•	
Mozbot (https://www.mozbot.com )
Bing
Bing is the second most popular search engine after Google; it was developed by 
Microsoft and is the default search engine in the Internet Explorer and Edge browsers. 
Bing has many similarities to Google basic search operators. Table 4-2 lists the main 
search operators that can be used to refine your search on Bing (don’t use a space after 
the colon in the examples).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

139
You can compare the results retrieved by Google and Bing for the same search query 
by going to http://bvsg.org/index.html.
Another useful service that allows you to construct complex search queries for both 
Google and Bing visually is Advangle (http://advangle.com), as shown in Figure 4-6. 
You can also save your queries in an Advangle account (registration is free) to return to 
them later.

Privacy-Oriented Search Engines
These are the most popular search engines that don’t track user activities:
•	
DuckDuckGo (https://duckduckgo.com/): Online investigators 
usually use this to search the surface web while using the Tor Browser.
•	
Qwant (https://www.qwant.combased): This is based in France.
•	
Oscobo (https://oscobo.co.uk): This is based in the United Kingdom.
•	
Swisscows (https://swisscows.com): This is a privacy-safe web 
search based in Switzerland.
•	
Privatelee (https://privatelee.com): Search for web and images 
privately.
•	
Gigablast (https://www.gigablast.com): This is an open source 
search engine.
•	
Gibiru (www.gibiru.com): This is an uncensored and anonymous 
search engine.

141
Other Search Engines
Many OSINT investigators prefer to use more than one search engine to fetch results. 
Indeed, you will be surprised at the diversity of results when using different search 
engines to search for the same query. Table 4-3 lists other popular search engines that 
can be used to locate information online, by popularity. Bear in mind that you should 
anonymize your connection before conducting any search, or you can simply use the Tor 
Browser to conduct your search.

Business Search Sites
Although the term OSINT comes from the military, its value has not been limited to this 
context only. Nowadays, businesses rely heavily on OSINT to empower their decision-­
making processes in addition to predicting future events.

Finding information about corporations is essential for any online investigation. 
For example, business information gathered from OSINT sources can reveal important 
information such as business profits, current and future projects, business hierarchy, 
and company dates (such as annual meetings, corporate holidays, or investor meetings). 
Such information is helpful in many cases (for example, to find out whether a specific 
company or a person was part of a tax evasion case).
In this section, we will list sites that can be used to retrieve important information 
about businesses globally.
Find Business Annual Records
An annual report is a document issued by a company to its stockholders once a year. It 
contains valuable information about a corporation’s financial status such as its budget, 
financial position, profits, loss, management and auditor reports, and cash flow. You 
can also find a general description about the industry in which the intended company 
belongs.
The following sites give free access to thousands of annual reports published by 
different industries:
•	
www.annualreports.com lists thousands of annual records from 5,333 
companies worldwide.
•	
https://www.reportlinker.com contains more than 60 million 
searchable tables, figures, and datasets.
•	
https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-­
registries/overseas-registries lists all the company registries 
located around the world offered by the U.K. government.
•

Metadata Search Engines
When you conduct a search using a typical search engine like Google, your query will get 
processed by the search engine, which looks up your search query in its index database 
and retrieves relevant results accordingly. Metasearch engines are different; these 
engines do not have their own indexes. Instead, they send your search query to other 
search engines (such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo) in addition to other third-party data 
sources. Then they retrieve the results, rank them, and present the final output to you 
through their web interface.
Metasearch engines make agreements with the “true” search engine providers (like 
Google and Bing) to allow them to search and retrieve content from their indexes. Some 
meta search engines do use their own ranking schema to present the compiled results 
to end users. However, they cannot interfere with—or decide—the rank and relevancy 
of contents delivered to them by their data sources. Thus, you should usually stick to the 
top results from each partner search engine.
A major advantage of metasearch engines is their ability to compile results from 
many sources for each user search inquiry. Searching multiple sources instantly will 
reduce the time required for conducting the search and will return more comprehensive 
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

148

results without forgetting the enhanced privacy compared with other typical search 
engines (like Google and Bing). In the following list, we discuss the most popular 
metasearch engines currently available:
•	
www.etools.ch/search.do compiles its results from major 
international search engines, preserving user privacy by not 
collecting or sharing personal information about its users. This 
search engine is fast and shows a summary for each search query—
on the right side—detailing the source of its results (see Figure 4-8).
•	
All the Internet (https://www.alltheInternet.com) queries major 
search engines including shopping sites like Amazon and eBay.
•

search engines (aggregating results from the Guardian, Reuters, the 
Washington Post, BBC News, and the Los Angeles Times) and health 
search engines.
Code Search
As an online investigator, you may encounter cases when you need to search for a 
snippet of code (for example, to reconstruct embedded software). The following are the 
major source code search engines:
•	
Searchcode (https://searchcode.com) searches Google code, 
GitHub, Bitbucket, CodePlex, Sourceforge, Fedora Project, and

Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

151
FTP Search Engines
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is an old protocol invented in the early days of the 
Internet and still used by millions of websites. As its name implies, it is used to transfer 
files between computers across networks like the Internet. Web hosting companies 
usually give its customers an FTP account to transfer files to their hosting space. Many 
companies, universities, institutions, and collaboration projects put large archive 
files and other downloadable software on FTP servers to facilitate sharing among 
its employees. FTP accounts can be accessed using a special client such as FileZilla 
(https://filezilla-project.org) that supports uploading, downloading, and 
renaming files. Companies usually protect their FTP servers with a password. However, 
you can find plenty of them left unsecured online (without a password), and such public 
FTP servers can be accessed through web browsers directly to view/download their 
contents.
According to the IEEE Computer Society,iv there are more than 13 million FTP 
servers in the world, 1.1 million of which allow “anonymous” (public) access. A wealth 
of useful information can be found on public FTP servers, ranging from music and 
video files to licensed software, tax documents, and cryptographic secrets in addition to 
personal files and directories.
When searching for contents on FTP servers using specialized FTP search engines, 
you are only searching for filenames and directories, as indexing all the content on 
all FTP servers is difficult and cannot be achieved easily. Let’s first begin testing some 
techniques with Google to find content on FTP servers; see Table 4-5.
Table 4-5.  Advanced Google Search Queries to Find FTP Servers
Google FTP Search Query
Meaning
inurl:“ftp://www.” “Index of /”
This search query can be used to find FTP servers online.
inurl:ftp -inurl:(http|https)  
“SEARCH QUERY”
Use this to search for all FTP servers that have the 
specified search query.

The following are some sites to search FTP servers:
•	
Global file search (http://globalfilesearch.com)
•	
Filemare (https://filemare.com/en-nl)
•	
Archie (http://archie.icm.edu.pl/archie_eng.html)
•	
File watcher (www.filewatcher.com)
Automated Search Tools
Automated tools allow an online searcher to automate the search process using 
major search engines such as Google, Bing, and Shodan. Automated tools are fast and 
allow you to test large numbers of search queries continually, thus returning more 
comprehensive results because the search tool can construct complex search queries 
better than a human. The following sections highlight the most famous automated 
search tools.
SearchDiggity
This is the most well-known search engine hacking tool; it is a Windows GUI application 
that connects you to famous search engines’ hacking databases such as the Google 
Hacking Database. It works by automating the search process on different search engine 
platforms such as Google, Bing, Shodan, CodeSearch, and others, and it presents 
the results within the program’s main interface. See https://www.bishopfox.com/
resources/tools/google-hacking-diggity/attack-tools.

Internet of Things.
Web Directories
We defined web directory briefly in the previous chapter. A web directory—also known 
as a subject directory—is a website that lists and organizes many sites into categories. 
We can consider it like a phone book. Each letter in this phone book refers to a topic 
or subject (shopping, news, information technology, blog), and each topic has many 
websites belonging to it (for example, information security contains  
www.DarknessGate.com).
The directory has a hierarchical structure; it emphasizes linking to a site home page 
instead of linking to individual pages, thus focusing on the general topic/subject the 
website belongs to. Directories are usually managed by human reviewers; hence, unlike 
search engines that use spiders to index web contents automatically, web directories 
depend on human efforts to add/update their contents. To add a website to a web directory, 
a webmaster needs to submit a site address and supply some keywords and define its 
niche. A moderator—from the web directory—then checks the submission for fitness.
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

155
A user can use a web directory internal search engine to find a specific website 
within the directory or can simply browse all websites under a specific topic (see 
Figure 4-11).
Web directories come in varying sizes. Yahoo and DMOZ are both discontinued now, 
but you can view a static version of DMOZ at http://dmoztools.net. There are huge 
directories covering all types of Internet sites. Other types are specialized web directories 
that cover specific subjects and branch to relevant websites within them.
A web directory can be either free or paid. Free submission sites charge no money 
for include your site in the directory, while the paid ones require a website owner to pay 
a little amount of money to include their site in the directory. Some web directories ask 
for a reciprocal link. Hence, you need to put a link to the directory on your homepage to 
include yours—freely—in their listing.
While websites use keywords to search and locate information online, web 
directories organize all the websites according to each site subject, thus enabling you to 
find groups of relevant sites according to subject, language, and region. Then you can 
use search engine techniques—for example, a Google custom search—to search within 
each category for specific information.
Figure 4-11.  Sample web directory (http://dmoztools.net) showing main category 
and other subcategories

Website History and Website Capture
Sometimes you want to go back in time to investigate something in the past. Website 
capture is useful for online investigations because you can ensure that a snapshot of 
a given website will always remain online even if the original page disappears. Please 
note that saved pages are usually stored without their associated scripts, so some 
functionality, themes, and menus may not work correctly.
There are many online sites that offer such services; the following are the most 
popular ones:
•	
Internet Archive (the Wayback Machine; https://archive.org/web/
web.php) is the most popular archive site; it has more than 308 billion 
web pages saved over time, and anyone can capture a web page as 
it appears now to use it in the future as a clue or a reference (the 
captured website should allow crawlers). See Figure 4-14.
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

159
•	
Archive (https://archive.fo/) is also available.
•	
Cached pages (www.cachedpages.com/) shows previous websites 
captured on three different archive websites (Google cache, Coral, 
and Archive.org).
•	
www.screenshots.com shows screenshot history for any website.
•	
Way Backpack (https://github.com/jsvine/waybackpack) is a tool 
that allows you to download the entire Wayback Machine archive for 
a given web page.

webarchive/) holds U.K. government web archives published on the 
Web since 1996 to the present. The archived contents include videos, 
tweets, and web pages.
Website Monitoring Services
Sometimes you might need to know about changes to a specific website when they 
happen. Tracking down changes to one website can be achieved by visiting it regularly. 
However, what can you do if you need to track page changes to many sites at once?
There are many online services that allow you to track an unlimited number of 
pages. This works by sending you an alert e-mail once a change is detected in the 
specific page (chosen by you). Some paid services allow you to receive SMS alerts also. 
The following are the major free website-monitoring services currently available:
•	
Google Alerts (https://www.google.com/alerts; see Figure 4-15) 
is a web content change detection (based on your search phrase or 
keywords) and notification service offered by Google. To set an alert, 
you need to go to the Google Alerts page (you need to sign into your 
Google account first) and enter the search phrase or word (it should 
be specific, not general, to avoid getting too many results). Google 
will notify you by e-mail when the specified search phrase or word 
appears in the newly indexed search results anywhere online (it will 
not notify you about current results available on the Web).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

161
•	
Talk Walker (www.talkwalker.com/alerts) is an alternative to 
Google Alerts.
•	
Visual Ping (https://visualping.io) monitors web pages for any 
detected change; the free account gives you 62 checks per month.
•	
Follow That Page (https://www.followthatpage.com) gives you two 
daily checks with the free account.
•	
Watch That Page (www.watchthatpage.com) gives you 70 weekly 
checks on all your pages.
•	
Update Scanner (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/
addon/update-scanner) is a Firefox extension that monitors web 
pages for updates.
Figure 4-15.  Creating a new Google alert
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

162
RSS Feed
Another method to monitor website changes is to use an RSS feed. So, what does RSS 
mean?
Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary is an XML (text) file that allows site 
owners to inform subscribed readers—and other sites—about new content published on 
their sites. RSS revolutionizes how Internet users can track updated content online. To 
check for new site updates, a user needs to have an RSS feed reader. The user subscribes 
to the site RSS feed, and then any new content on this site will appear in their feed reader 
automatically. Each feed entry will usually contain the title, summary of the published 
text, date of publishing, and author name.
Subscribing to a website RSS will make a user aware of any updates on to their 
monitored sites, thus removing the need to visit intended websites continually to check 
for newly published contents.
Major web browsers offer a mechanism to subscribe to the site RSS feed. Mozilla 
Firefox comes equipped with built-in RSS support called Live Bookmarks. To subscribe 
to any website RSS feed through Firefox, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Navigate to the website where you want to subscribe to its RSS 
feed.
	 2.	 From the Bookmarks menu, select Subscribe to This Page (if the 
browser does not detect an RSS feed on the page, this option will 
be grayed out). Then select your feed. Figure 4-16 shows two feeds 
for this site because it is a blog, one for the comments and the 
second for site contents named Feed.
Figure 4-16.  Subscribe to an RSS feed using Firefox
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

163
	 3.	 The next page appears. Use the Firefox subscription box at the top 
to confirm your subscription. Make sure to set the option as in 
Figure 4-17.
	 4.	 After clicking Subscribe Now, a pop-up message will appear 
allowing you to change the feed name and location. The default 
settings should be OK. Hit the Subscribe button and you are done!
The built-in RSS feed reader in a browser has limited functionality compared to some 
dedicated desktop RSS feed reader software. For instance, RSSOwl (www.rssowl.org/) 
comes with powerful features such as searching within feeds, saving a previous feed 
search, and getting notifications on new content. It is free and comes supported on all 
major platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.
There are also browser extensions—add-ons—for major web browsers in addition 
to online services that offer feed subscription. However, if you are part of an online 
investigation, it is preferable to use only the built-in browser feed utility or the RSSOwl 
software to avoid leaking information about your stored feed. Many browser extensions 
request access to your browser surfing history, and this may result in a privacy breach if 
such records fall into the wrong hands.
News Search
A wealth of useful information about anything can be found in news sources. For 
instance, a corporation can gain deep insight about any competitor like its legal history, 
partnership agreements, financial status, and any negative mention by searching within 
news archives. We gave an example for business corporations; however, the same things 
apply to governments, nonprofit organizations, and high-profile individuals.
Figure 4-17.  Click the Subscribe Now button to subscribe to the intended RSS feed
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

164
Searching in news online is easier than searching in a media broadcast archive. In 
this section, we will cover how you can customize Google News to know about the latest 
updates of any search keyword/phrase appearing in global news channels. We will also 
mention other online news sources and give advice on how to detect fake news.
Customize Google News
Google News offers an up-to-date news service aggregated from various sources around 
the world. A user can select a topic of interest, and Google will show relevant results 
about this topic. Online investigators can exploit the Google News service to simplify 
searching for specific topics or search terms within the news. To do this, follow these 
steps:
	 1.	 Go to https://news.google.com.

Fake News Detection
In today’s digital age, everything is connected online, and a large number of people 
receive their news using social media sites, where anyone can post anything using a 
fake identity. In addition, there are many unreliable news sites that announce news 
without investigating its source accurately. For instance, any malicious actor can spread 
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

167
misleading news for commercial gain, for propaganda purposes, or to mislead people 
about something. Such false news can spread instantly because of the simplicity of 
sharing information across different social media platforms and, consequently, through 
the entire Internet.
Detecting fake news has become a hot topic today and attracts huge attention. Major 
social platforms—like Twitter and Facebook—have promised their users they will find 
a solution to stop or at least decrease the harm of fake news. Researchers continue in 
this field with emphasis on developing artificial intelligence solutions (such as machine 
learning and natural language processing) to combat fake news.
As an OSINT investigator, you will certainly encounter fake news during your search 
for resources. Any suspicious information should not be included in your case files. To 
help sort true information from false information, you should use the following checklist 
for investigating suspicious news:
	 1.	 Read the entire article or piece of information first. Do not believe 
anything until you review its source.
	 2.	 Read the source of the news/information.
	 3.	 If the source comes from a credible or well-known website (for 
example, a global well-­known news agency), do the following:
	 a.	
Go to the source of the news to see whether the same 
information is presented on its site. For example, if a piece of 
news is attributed to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com), 
check its website to see whether the same information exists 
there.
	 4.	 If the information comes from an unknown source, you need to 
conduct an online search to see who else has published the same 
news.
	 a.	
If a credible and well-known website published the same 
story from the same source, it is highly likely to be a true story.
	 b.	
Otherwise, you need to check more about the issue or decline 
to use the information.
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

168
Warning!  Do not trust information published on social sites only. Instead, 
conduct an online search to see whether the same news has been published 
elsewhere. If you find that this news is false, make sure to report it to the site 
operators (for example, Facebook allows its users to report posts for review).
You should read news, articles, and other content only on reputable websites. Less-­
known sites should be investigated thoroughly before considering their news as valid.
There are many sites online that help you to figure out whether something is false 
news/information. The following are the most important ones:
•	
Snopes (https://www.snopes.com) discovers false news, stories, and 
urban legends and researches/validates rumors to see whether they 
are true (see Figure 4-20).
•	
Hoaxy (https://hoaxy.iuni.iu.edu) checks the spread of false 
claims (like a hoax, rumor, satire, or news report) across social 
media sites. The site derives its results from reputable fact-checking 
organizations to return the most accurate results.
•	
FactCheck (www.factcheck.org/fake-news) is partnered with 
Facebook to help identify and label fake news reported by its users. 
It also monitors different media for the false information covering a 
wide range of topics like health, science, and hoaxes spread through 
spam e-mails.
•	
https://reporterslab.org/fact-checking gives a map of global 
fact-checking sites (see Figure 4-21).
Figure 4-20.  Example of fake news discovered by Snopes
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

169
•	
www.truthorfiction.com discovers fake news in different topics such as 
politics, nature, health, space, crime, police and terrorism, and so on.
•	
Hoax-Slayer (www.hoax-slayer.com) focuses on e-mail scams and 
social media hoaxes.
•	
Verification Handbook (http://verificationhandbook.com) is a 
definitive guide to verifying digital content for emergency coverage 
available in different languages.
•	
Verification Junkie (http://verificationjunkie.com) is a directory 
of tools for verifying, fact checking, and assessing the validity of 
eyewitness reports and user self-published content online.
•	
https://citizenevidence.org has tools and lessons to teach people 
how to authenticate user-generated online contents. It is managed by 
Amnesty International.
•	
InVID Verification Plugin (www.invid-project.eu/tools-and-­
services/invid-verification-plugin) supports both Mozilla 
Firefox and Chrome. This is a tool created by the InVID European 
project to help journalists verify content on social networks.

Searching for Digital Files
In a previous section, we talked briefly about how to use Google and Bing advanced 
search operators to search for different types of digital files (documents, images, and 
videos). In this section, we will continue our discussion and show how to utilize different 
techniques and specialized search engines to search for files in a variety of formats.
Digital files constitute an important percentage of web contents located on the 
surface web. Now, with the availability of free cloud file-hosting services (Dropbox, 
Google Drive) and video-sharing sites (YouTube), individuals and corporations are used 
to using such services for online sharing. Digital files found online can contain a wealth 
of information, not only in their contents but also in their metadata (hidden attributes).
Document Search
This section is dedicated to online document search, but before we start, let’s first talk 
about the most common document file formats available online.
DOC and DOCX
DOC and DOCX are the standard file formats for Microsoft Word documents. Microsoft 
Word is part of the Microsoft Office suite created by Microsoft. The .doc extension is 
for older versions of Microsoft Word, such as 2003 and older. New editions of Microsoft 
Word (beginning with 2007) have the .docx extension.
HTML and HTM
Hypertext Markup Language is the standard web page file format to represent content on 
the Web. Both extensions (.html and .htm) can be used interchangeably. To edit these 
files, you can use any text editor. However, to decode and display HTML file contents, 
you need to open the HTML file using a web browser.
ODT
This is a text document file format (formatted using the OASIS OpenDocument XML-­
based standard) like the Microsoft Word file format; it is used in the open source word 
processing program named Writer, which comes as part of the Apache OpenOffice suite. 
ODT can be opened and edited using any OpenOffice-compatible program, including 
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

171
NeoOffice (Mac), AbiWord (Mac and Windows), and KWord (Unix). You can also open 
ODT files using Microsoft Word and save them as DOCX files.
XLS and XLSX
XLS and XLSX are file formats for Microsoft Excel used to create spreadsheets. Older 
editions have the .xsl extension, while modern Microsoft Excel files (beginning with 
2007) have the .xslx extension. Excel is part of the Microsoft Office suite created by 
Microsoft.
ODS
ODS stands for OpenDocument Spreadsheet; this format was created by the Calc 
program that is included in the Apache OpenOffice suite. ODS files can be opened and 
edited using any OpenOffice-compatible program, including NeoOffice (Mac) and 
LibreOffice (Mac and Windows). They can also be opened in Microsoft Excel and saved 
as XLS or XLSX files.
PPT and PPTX
PPT and PPTX are file format for Microsoft PowerPoint that are used for creating 
multimedia presentations. Just like with the Excel and Word programs, .ppt is used for 
older editions, while .pptx is used in modern Microsoft PowerPoint editions.
ODP
ODP stands for OpenDocument Presentation. It is used in the Apache OpenOffice 
Impress program, which comes as part of the OpenOffice suite. Microsoft PowerPoint 
can be used to open or save a presentation in the ODP format.
TXT
TXT is a basic plain-text file format that can be opened using any text editor on all 
operating systems.
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

172
PDF
PDF stands for Portable Document Format, the most widely used document file format 
online, originally created by Adobe Systems. Acrobat Reader, which is available as a 
free download from the Adobe website (https://get.adobe.com/reader), allows you 
to view and print PDF files. The PDF file format has become the most widely used file 
format by governments, corporations, and educational institutions around the world.
Note!  Apache OpenOffice can be found at https://www.openoffice.org, 
and LibreOffice can be found at https://www.libreoffice.org.
Let’s begin our search for documents by using some Google operators to find files on 
different cloud storage providers.
To search a Google doc site, use the following query in the Google basic search 
engine: site:docs.google.com SEARCHTERM. This will search for the specified search 
term on the Google document website (docs.google.com). In the same way, you can 
search for documents hosted on Google Drive—with public access—using the following 
search query: site:drive.google.com SEARCHTERM.
To search for files hosted on Dropbox, type the following in Google: site:dl.dropbox.
com SEARCHTERM.
To search for files on Amazon AWS, type the following in Google: site:s3.
amazonaws.com SEARCHTERM.
To search for files on Microsoft OneDrive, type the following in Google: 
site:onedrive.live.com SEARCHTERM.
File Search Engines
Some specialized search engines can query many file hosting sites.
Fagan Finder
Fagan Finder (www.faganfinder.com/filetype) is an old search engine but still works 
just fine to locate different file types online. Just enter your search term, select the file 
type you want to search for, and finally select the search engine to conduct your search 
(see Figure 4-22).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

173
General-Search
General-Search (www.general-search.com) allows you to search for different file types 
using 11 file-hosting websites. You can select the file type and set a filter to its size (see 
Figure 4-23).
ShareDir
ShareDir (https://sharedir.com) lets you specify a file type and search more than 60 
file-hosting sites simultaneously. The unique service offered by this site is that it allows 
you to download 500MB daily—without waiting—from premium file-hosting websites. 
All you need is to register for a free account to use this feature.
Figure 4-22.  Use the Fagan Finder file search engine to locate a variety of file types 
on different search engines
Figure 4-23.  Search for files using 11 file-hosting websites
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

174
Note!  You can search any file-hosting website using the Google site search 
operator. For example, to search for files on Mediafire.com, type the following 
operator into the Google search engine: site:mediafire.com SEARCHTERM.
Custom Search Engine
We already covered different types of search engines. However, we deferred our 
discussion of custom search engines until now, so we could cover how to use this 
technique to narrow down your search for specific file types within a limited set of sites.
The term custom search can be misleading at first sight; some users may think that 
they can create a new custom search engine according to their preferences. However, 
this is not true. A custom search allows you to use an existing search engine service to 
preselect the websites you need to limit your search to, the types of results returned (for 
example, only PDF files), and how the results will be prioritized.
A major provider of custom search is Google, so we will cover how to create one in 
the following steps:
	 1.	 Go to www.google.com/coop/cse.
	 2.	 You must have a Google account to use this service, so sign in if 
you have not done this already.
	 3.	 Click the “New search engine” button on the left side.
	 4.	 On the following page, enter the sites that you want to include in 
your search in the “Sites to search” section. You can include whole 
site URLs or individual page URLs. Select the language used to 
display the GUI of your custom search engine; finally, give your 
search a name.
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

Figure 4-24.  Create a custom search engine using a Google custom search
	 5.	 Click the Create button to create your custom search engine (see 
Figure 4-24).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

176
	 6.	 After successfully creating your custom search engine, Google 
will display a page showing the public URL of your custom search 
engine. It will also show the HTML code snippet in case you want 
to put it on your website and a link to a custom search engine 
control panel to update its settings (see Figure 4-25).
To access the public URL of your custom search engine, go to https://cse.google.
com/cse/all, click the custom search engine name you want to access, go to Setup, and 
select Public URL (see Figure 4-26).
Figure 4-25.  Google custom search engine created successfully
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

177
Google will display a search box to you. Enter your search query, and Google will 
display relevant results from only the websites that have been entered upon creating 
your custom search engine.
Figure 4-26.  Viewing the public URL of your Google custom search engine
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

178
Many Internet users have already created their own Google custom search engines to 
locate files and FTP directories online. One of these is located at https://cse.google.
com/cse/home?cx=014863114814409449623%3Ajc-vjhl_c5g. To use this custom search, 
enter your search term (file or directory name); you can also specify the file type you 
want to restrict search results to by clicking the relevant name below the search box  
(see Figure 4-27).
Other useful Google custom search engines for locating OSINT resources online are 
as follows:
•	
300+ Social Networking Sites (https://cse.google.com/cse/public

Gray Literature
As we already said in Chapter 1, gray literature is any material produced by the world’s 
commercial publishing systems. It has mainly two types.
•	
Gray literature
•	
Gray information
Gray literature includes books, journals, magazines, and anything that can be 
obtained publicly through traditional bookstore channels or academic publications.  
A user usually pays subscription fees to gain access to such resources or buys them 
directly from bookstores (such as buying books from Amazon.com). Springer  
(https://rd.springer.com), which provides access to millions of scientific documents 
such as journals, books, series, protocols, and reference works, is a clear example of a 
gray literature channel.
Gray information, on the other hand, cannot be obtained easily using traditional 
bookstore routes. However, it has some specialized channels where you can obtain some 
of it; you need to pay for specialized subscription agencies to acquire the rest. Gray 
information includes the following—and more:
•	
Academic papers
•	
Preprints
•	
Proceedings
•	
Conference and discussion papers
•	
Research reports
•	
Marketing reports
•	
Technical specifications and standards
•	
Dissertations
•	
Theses
•	
Trade publications
•	
Memoranda
•	
Government reports and documents not published commercially
•	
Translations

Data Leak Information
Data leaks—sometimes called data breaches—are the intentional or unintentional 
release of confidential information to the public. Leaks mainly occur because of black 
hat hacker attacks against computerized systems or by disgruntled employees who may 
uncover secret information about their organizations.
Data leaks can include credit card information, PII, health information of patients, 
financial information, e-mail/social site usernames and passwords, trade secrets, 
corporations plans and future works, intellectual property information, and military 
information belonging to governments.
There is a debate on the legal status of data leak information. For instance, some 
argue that leaked information has become part of OSINT sources and thus you can 
handle it as you do with any publicly available information. The opposite opinion 
suggests that leaked information has been obtained illegally by breaching system or legal 
rules and thus should not be used as OSINT sources.
OSINT investigations cannot omit the existence of such leaked data while 
investigating some cases (especially when dealing with leaked intelligence information). 
However, it is preferred to handle it carefully on a case-by-case basis. For instance, if 
personal information or a private corporation has secrets leaked online, it is preferable 
not to publicize the information again and to renounce it in your search. Instead, you 
can use the useful elements in your investigation while respecting the affected actor’s 
private information that has been already leaked once.
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

183
Leaked information such as personal, financial, and corporate information can be 
found on the darknet (already covered in Chapter 3), but we are not going to cover it 
because this is made up of illegal sites promoting illegal actions.
Leaked official documents are distributed online using specific websites that 
focus on different areas, mostly the military, intelligence, and surveillance arenas. The 
following are the two most popular official data leak repositories online:
•	
WikiLeaks (https://wikileaks.org)
•	
Cryptome (https://cryptome.org)
•	
Offshore Leaks (https://offshoreleaks.icij.org)
Document Metadata
We already talked about digital file metadata and demonstrated how to view/edit it using 
different tools in Chapter 2, but bear in mind that any digital files acquired online can 
contain useful metadata that must be investigated.
Image
Digital images, logos, and icons can be of great value in OSINT investigations. Major 
search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing provide basic image search engine 
functionality. However, there are other more specialized image search engines that can 
be used to get more precise results.
Basic Image Search
The following sites offer image search services:
•	
Google Image Search (https://images.google.com)
•	
Bing image search (www.bing.com/images)
•	
Yahoo Images (http://images.yahoo.com)

HOW TO DOWNLOAD FLASH VIDEOS, ICONS, AND OTHER IMAGES USING FIREFOX
Some websites—like www.DarknessGate.com—protect multimedia content by disabling 
selection and right-click. Many websites are still using Flash videos (SWF files) to display 
animation. To download SWF files and other multimedia files—when the right-click on a site is 
disabled—using only Firefox browser, follow these steps:
	A.	 Go to the Firefox menu and select Tools and then Page Info.
	B.	 Go to the Media tab and locate your SWF file or the images you want to

Reverse Image Search
A reverse image search uses a sample image instead of a search query. It works by 
uploading an image—or inserting its URL—into a reverse image search engine, which 
will in turn search its index to find where else this image appears online and display 
all the other locations. In this way, you can know the original source of photographs, 
memes, and profile pictures. The following are the most popular reverse image search 
engine sites:
•	
Google reverse search (https://www.google.com/imghp): Google has 
a dedicated search engine for image reverse searches; you can either 
paste the image URL in the search box or upload it to Google (see 
Figure 4-29).
•	
Karmadecay (http://karmadecay.com): This is a reverse image 
search on Reddit.com (in beta).
•	
TinyEye (www.tineye.com): You can search by image or URL; more 
than 24 billion images have already been indexed.
•	
Reverse Image Search (www.reverse-image-search.com): Conduct a 
reverse image search with Google, Bing, and Yandex.
•	
Imagebrief (www.imagebrief.com): Search for images and use reverse 
image searches as well.

Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

188
•	
Cam Finds App (http://camfindapp.com): This is an app available 
for both Android and Apple devices. It uses visual search technology 
to recognize uploaded pictures and gives instant results about them 
such as related images, local shopping results, and a vast selection of 
web results.
•	
Image Identification Project (https://www.imageidentify.com): This 
uses visual search technology to recognize uploaded images.
Image Manipulation Check
OSINT multimedia searches intersect many areas of the digital forensics field. As an 
online investigator, you should not trust all the multimedia files you acquire. If you are in 
doubt about any multimedia file (image or video), you should check carefully to assure 
that it has not been tampered with, meaning manipulated on purpose to hide or alter 
some facts. Image analysis begins with identifying the source device (camera or mobile 
phone) used to take the photo. This information is part of image metadata.
As we already mentioned in Chapter 2, all digital file types can include metadata 
(which is a data about data). Metadata can include a wealth of useful information 
for your investigation. In Chapter 2 we mentioned some tools to view/edit metadata 
in images, video, PDFs, and Microsoft Office documents. We will continue here and 
mention additional tools that are specifically useful for digital images:
•	
Forensically (https://29a.ch/photo-forensics/#forensic-­
magnifier): This site offers free tools for image forensics analysis; it 
includes clone detection, error-level analysis, metadata extraction, 
and more.
•	
Fotoforensics (http://fotoforensics.com): This offers the forensics 
analysis of JPEG and PNG files to check for any manipulation using 
error-level analysis (ELA) techniques.
•	
Ghiro (www.getghiro.org): This is an open source tool that can 
analyze images in bulk and extract metadata information, use GPS 
metadata to search for nearby images, and perform ELA to detect 
whether an image has been manipulated. You can download this 
program as a virtual appliance that is ready to use (it comes installed 
within Linux Ubuntu).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

189
•	
ExifTool (https://sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool): You can 
read, write, and edit meta-information in a wide variety of files. It 
supports different metadata formats such as EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, 
JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix, AFCP, and ID3.
•	
Exif Search (https://www.exif-search.com): This is a commercial 
search of images by using their metadata.
•	
JPEGsnoop (www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-snoop.html): 
This analyzes the source of the image to test its authenticity.
•	
GeoSetter (www.geosetter.de/en): You can manipulate/view 
geodata—and other metadata information—of other images.
•	
Lets Enhance (https://letsenhance.io): You can enhance a photo 
size without losing its quality. The free account allows for 14 images. 
However, you still need to upload a target image to the server, and 
this will impose privacy concerns on the uploaded files.
OCR Tools
During your search, you may encounter text written inside images. This text should be 
extracted first so that it can be edited, formatted, indexed, searched, or translated. The 
following are popular tools and web services for extracting text from images, known as 
optical character recognition (OCR):
•	
FreeOCR (www.paperfile.net/index.html)
•	
Free Online OCR (www.i2ocr.com)
•	
NewOCR (www.newocr.com)

Figure 4-30.  Opening an image file using Google Doc
Google Drive and Google Docs have integrated OCR support enabled by default. To 
use this service, you need to upload the image into your Google Drive account (you must 
have a Google account first) at https://www.google.com/drive. Then right-click the 
uploaded image, select Open With, and choose Google Docs (see Figure 4-30).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

191
You will notice that Google has presented your uploaded image on the top of the 
document and created an editable OCR text below it (see Figure 4-31).
Video
The technological revolution has affected the way people communicate. For instance, 
Internet speed is increasing steadily and has become more affordable in most countries 
around the world. Computing devices such as tables and smartphones are getting 
cheaper, and almost anyone can acquire one. Many of these devices come equipped 
with powerful cameras. In fact, people have become used to recording their daily 
moments using videos; video-sharing websites allow anyone to upload a video file with 
just a simple click using each site’s app.

196
File Extension and File Signature List
Knowing file extensions and signatures will help you to identify and investigate digital 
files during your OSINT gathering. The following are two websites for this issue:
•	
File Extensions (https://www.file-extensions.org/): This library 
contains thousands of file extensions and their descriptions.
•	
File Signature Table (https://garykessler.net/library/ 
file_sigs.html): List of file extensions and their associated Hex 
signature.
Productivity Tools
In Chapter 2, we covered some useful tools for making your online investigations more 
organized. We deferred mentioning the remaining tools until now as they relate to file-­
searching techniques.
Screen Capture
Sometimes you need to take a screen capture of the whole screen or part of the screen to 
capture important information (for example, to capture a pop-up message or a portion 
of online map) and include it in your investigation report. There are many tools to 
achieve this; these are two popular solutions:
•	
Awesome Screenshot Plus (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/
firefox/addon/screenshot-capture-annotate/): This is a Firefox 
add-on; it can be used to capture the whole page or any portion of 
it; annotate it with rectangles, circles, arrows, lines, and text; blur 
sensitive information; and much more.
•	
Greenshot (http://getgreenshot.org): This is an open source 
screenshot program for Windows. It allows you to create screenshots 
of a selected region, window, or full screen. It has a built-in image 
editor to annotate, highlight, or obfuscate parts of the captured 
screenshots (see Figure 4-35).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

197
•	
Screenshot Machine (https://screenshotmachine.com): This site 
allows you to take an online screen capture of any specified URL. The 
captured image can be downloaded to your device.
•	
PDF My URL (http://pdfmyurl.com): This is an online service to 
create PDF documents from any URL in your browser.
Download Online Video
Online investigations require you to search and investigate video files to extract useful 
hidden information. Sometimes you may need to save (download) a video from the 
Internet—for example, from a YouTube website—to include it in your investigation or to 
analyze it further. There are many ways to download videos from the Internet; the easiest 
method is to use browser add-ons.
Easy YouTube Video Downloader Express
This is a Firefox add-on to download videos from YouTube. It allows the direct download 
of high-quality video/audio from YouTube (1080p full-HD and 256Kbps MP3) with a 
single click. You can find it at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/
easy-youtube-video-download.
YooDownload
If you prefer to use a web service to download videos from different social sites online, 
YooDownload will help to achieve this easily. Go to https://yoodownload.com/ 
index.php and insert the video URL from the social platform (YouTube, Facebook, 
Instagram, Twitter, Vid, and SoundCloud music); you can also select the video quality 
before download. The website also offers a browser extension for the Chrome browser.
Figure 4-35.  Greenshot can perform different annotation actions on captured 
images and is easy to use
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

198
Dredown
At https://www.dredown.com, you can download videos from all major video-sharing 
sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Keek, Twitter, Twitch, Vimeo, Vevo, Tumblr, 
and more.
You can find other websites for downloading video contents online at  
http://deturl.com.
Video/Audio Converter
You may encounter cases—during your search for videos—where you cannot open a 
specific video/audio file because of its file format type. To counter such issues, you can 
use software to convert a video file from its current file format to another one so it can 
work on supported devices.
•	
HandBrake (https://handbrake.fr): This is an open source 
program for processing multimedia files and any DVD or Blu-ray 
disc into a readable format on supported devices; it also supports 
encoding different audio file types.
•	
Convert2mp3 (www.convert2mp3.net): This is an online service that 
converts videos with different file formats into MP3 and other audio 
file formats.
Warning!  There are many web extensions already available to download/convert 
media files from the Internet. However, we prefer not to use such add-ons as 
they can gain access to our browser web history, and this may result in a privacy 
invasion, especially when working on sensitive cases that require secrecy.
Using online services should be more secure when you use these two precaution 
measures:
A.	 Do not supply information when using this service (e.g., e-mail, phone  
number, etc.)
B.	 Access such services over a VPN connectio n (or using the Tor Browser).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

199
File Search Tools
After collecting a large number of files as part of your online investigation, you may 
have difficulty finding one specific piece of information when you need it. All operating 
systems have a built-in search function to locate files and folders on the computer drive. 
However, they lack an advanced search feature like those offered by some dedicated 
tools. They are also known to be time-consuming especially when using the Windows 
search feature on computers with old hardware. (Windows performs background 
search indexing and consumes a considerable amount of system RAM because it 
performs thousands of write operations on the hard drive, resulting in slowing down the 
computer; this problem appears clearly on Windows Vista.) 
Being able to search through the files you have collected is an integral part of your 
OSINT analyzing skills. Your ability to find files fast through automated search will save 
considerable time than when conducting such searches manually.
To speed up file searches on your computer, you need to have an index of your stored 
files. The idea is like how people query search engines. When someone queries Google 
for a search term, Google will search for this term in its index database. When a match 
is found, the URLs associated with the index search results get retrieved and displayed 
on the user’s browser. Searching for files on computers is similar. You need to have an 
index of all file names and their locations on your computer hard drives. The list (index) 
will get stored in a database. Whenever you search for something, you will query the 
database instead of asking Windows to search manually across all files and folders on the 
drive. This will effectively give you the fastest results, especially if you have millions of 
files on your computer hard drive.
Windows can create such an index to locate files faster. However, there are better 
programs that can do the job better and have more advanced search features. These are 
some of them:
•	
Locate32 (http://locate32.cogit.net): Upon the first run, you 
need to go to the File menu and select Update Databases. This will 
create the database file that contains the names of all files/folders 
along with their locations on all hard drives (see Figure 4-36).
Chapter 4  Search Engine Techniques

200
•	
Everything (www.voidtools.com): This is a small program that 
consumes very little system resources; it creates an index database 
automatically upon start and can index files very fast (it needs one 
minute to index 1,000,000 files) and can search within file contents. 
You can search using different methods such as Boolean, regex, 
wildcards, file types, and macros.
•	
FileSeek (free edition) (https://www.fileseek.ca): This uses 
multithreading technology to speed up searches and can synchronize 
search results across different computers in addition to searching 
within the file’s contents using regular expressions.
•	
Open Semantic Search (https://www.opensemanticsearch.org): 
This open source search engine comes with integrated research 
tools for easier searching, monitoring, analytics, discovery, and text 
mining of heterogenous and large document sets and news. It can 
be installed on your own server or enterprise server and comes with 
plenty of excellent search features. It is suitable for teams conducting 
OSINT research on a large volume of datasets.

Summary
In this chapter, we thoroughly covered how to use basic and advanced search engine 
techniques to locate information online. Although most of your work in this chapter was 
focused on retrieving data from the surface web, we showed techniques for extracting 
data from the deep web and provided direct links to a variety of deep web repositories to 
retrieve information from it.
Major search engines allow its users to search for multimedia content such as 
videos and images. However, there are specialized search engines for FTP servers and 
multimedia contents that can return even more results. Bear in mind that images and 
videos retrieved from the Web can contain useful information associated with them—
known as metadata—that should be retrieved first. These files must also be investigated 
using specialized tools to make sure that they have not been manipulated in any way 
before considering them valid.
In the next chapter, we will continue our discussion of online search techniques, but 
there we will focus on using different techniques and services to find information about 
specific people using social media sites and other specialized people-searching engines.

CHAPTER 5
Social Media Intelligence
In today’s digital age, it is rare to meet a person who is connected to the Internet who 
doesn’t have an account on one or more social media sites. People use social sites to 
socialize, play games, shop, communicate online, and seek information about anything 
you can imagine. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and Google have become 
integral parts of our lives, and hundreds of millions of people spend considerable 
amounts of time on these platforms daily.
Check out these statistics about the global usage of social media sites:
•	
As of October 2017, the total worldwide population was 7.6 billion.i 
Of those, 3.5 billion people have an Internet connection, and 3.03 
billion of those connected users have an active presence on one or 
more social media platform.ii
•	
Each Internet user has an average of seven social media accounts.iii
•	
Facebook has 2.07 billion monthly active users as of the third quarter 
of 2017.iv
•	
As of the third quarter of 2017, Twitter has 330 million monthly active 
users.
•	
As of April 2017, LinkedIn has 500 million users in 200 countries.v
Social media sites open numerous opportunities for any investigation because 
of the vast amount of useful information that can be found on them. For example, 
you can get a great deal of personal information about any person worldwide by just 
checking this person’s Facebook page. Such information often includes the person of 
interest’s connections on Facebook, political views, religion, ethnicity, country of origin, 
personal images and videos, spouse name (or marital status), home and work addresses, 
frequently visited locations, social activities (e.g., sports, theater, and restaurant visits), 

204
work history, education, important event dates (such as birth date, graduation date, 
relationship date, or the date when left/start a new job), and social interactions. This 
can all be found in one Facebook profile, for example. Facebook also helps an outside 
observer to understand how a particular Facebook user perceives life by just checking 
the user’s current activities and social interactions.
Many estimates show that 90 percent of useful information acquired by intelligence 
services comes from public sources (OSINT), and the rest comes from traditional covert 
spying intelligence. Security services gather information in bulk from social sites to 
gain insight about possible future events worldwide and to profile people on a national 
scale.
Aside from intelligence gathering, law enforcement uses social media sites as 
investigative resources to fight crimes. For instance, checking a suspect’s Facebook 
page—or his relatives’ and friends' pages—may reveal important information about a 
criminal case. Sometimes the suspect could be anonymous, but the police could have 
a picture of him taken by surveillance cameras. In such cases, police use social media 
sites to engage the public in identifying suspects. Social sites can also be used to track 
and locate suspects in addition to understanding their behaviors. However, bear in mind 
that using the information gathered from social media sites in a legal case is generally 
allowed under these two conditions:
•	
When acquiring permission from a court to gather information about 
a specific user, a court order is sent to the intended social media site 
to hand the information to authorities officially.
•	
If the information is available publicly (e.g., public posts, images, or 
videos), then law enforcement can acquire it without a permit, which 
is the essence of the OSINT concept.
Intelligence gathered from social media can also be useful in the corporate world. 
For instance, employers can conduct a background check about prospective candidates 
before offering them a vacancy. The same applies to insurance companies and banks 
before offering some services (e.g., an insurance contract or a bank loan) to their clients. 
Global companies—operating in different countries—need to have some form of 
intelligence about new markets before entering them. Indeed, social media exploitation 
has become integrated into the majority of businesses to support the decision-making 
process.
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

205
Warning!  Using the information published on social sites to acquire intelligence 
about a prospect employee should be handled carefully in accordance with the law 
to avoid triggering a claim of discrimination by the prospective employee.
In this chapter, we will show investigators how to find information on social 
media sites. There are a plethora of tools and online services to dive beyond basic the 
search functions available for each social site. We will demonstrate how to use such 
services/tools to aggregate information about any target online, but before we begin 
our discussion about how to retrieve information from the most popular social media 
sites, we’ll first explain the term social media intelligence and differentiate between the 
different types of social media sites currently available.
What Is Social Media Intelligence?
Social media intelligence (SOCMINT) refers to the information gathered from social 
media platforms. The resources available on social media sites can be either open 
to the public (e.g., public posts on Facebook) or private. Private information cannot 
be accessed without proper permission (e.g., Facebook private messages or posts 
shared with friends). There is a debate between privacy advocates and other security 
experts about whether information available on social media sites is OSINT. Although 
the majority of social media sites require their users to register before accessing site 
contents in full, many surveys show that social media users expect to have some form 
of privacy for their online activities (even when posting content with public access). 
However, security experts generally consider information shared on social media sites as 
belonging to the OSINT domain because it is public information shared on public online 
platforms and thus can be exploited for different purposes.
Note!  Many U.S. states (about 25 states in 2017vi) imposed different restrictions 
regarding employers’ access to workers’ (applicants or employees) social media 
accounts. However, this does not mean that your social media interactions will not 
get observed—secretly—in one way or another.
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

206
There are different types of social media sites, but before listing them, let’s first see 
what content people can publish on social media platforms to get to know the types of 
information that you can expect to gather.
Social Media Content Types
Aside from browsing the content, people interact with social media sites for different 
purposes. The following are the general interactions used across different social media 
sites:
•	
Post/comment: People access social sites to post or write paragraphs 
of text that can be seen by other users. Each social platform has its 
own name. On Twitter it’s called a tweet, while on Facebook it’s called 
a post or a comment when commenting on other user post. This text 
can be combined with images, videos, and URLs. See Figure 5-1 for a 
sample LinkedIn post.
•	
Reply: This is a text message (can also be an image, video, or URL) 
that replies to another user’s post, update status, or comment.
Figure 5-1.  Sample post on LinkedIn, which can be associated with either an 
image or video. The same post can also be shared on Twitter (which requires 
connecting your Twitter account with your LinkedIn profile).
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

207
•	
Multimedia content (images and videos): Multimedia is popular; 
a user can upload a video or image as a part of their post. Many 
social platforms allow their users to upload multiple images/videos 
to form an album. Live streams also are available on many social 
platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. This feature allows a user 
to broadcast live videos and display the recording on their profiles for 
later viewing.
•	
Social interactions: This is the essence of social media sites, where 
people get connected online by sending/responding to friend 
requests sent by their friends, work and study colleagues, roommates, 
neighbors, family members, and favorite celebrities or actors. The set 
of online relationships forms what is known as social networking.
•	
Metadata: The results from the sum of user interactions with the 
social platform. Examples include the date and time when a video/
image was uploaded, the date and time when a friend request was 
accepted, geolocation data—if enabled—of the uploaded multimedia 
file or post, and the type of device used to upload the contents 
(mobile or a standard computer).
Online investigators want to acquire all these content types—if possible—when 
conducting their investigations. This ability to do this depends on the privacy control 
level set by each user when publishing posts/updates online. For example, it is not 
possible to see other people’s updates on Facebook (see Figure 5-2) if they restrict a 
post’s visibility to some friend circles or set it to “Only me.”
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

208
Bear in mind that information shared on social media sites with family or friend 
circles cannot be guaranteed to remain private. For example, when you share a personal 
photo of yourself with a friend and this friend shares this photo in a public status, then 
others can see your personal photo even though you shared it privately at first.
Classifications of Social Media Platforms
Many people use the terms social media and social networking interchangeably to refer 
to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and related social platforms. This is not absolutely 
wrong, but it is not accurate because social media is the main umbrella that contains 
other categories like “social networking” that holds sites like Facebook. Social media 
contains other types that have similar roles in facilitating interactions between people 
online.
The following are the main social media types classified according to function:
•	
Social networking: This allows people to connect with other people 
and businesses (brands) online to share information and ideas.  
The most obvious examples of this type are Facebook and LinkedIn. 
(The latter is more focused on the corporate world but shares many 
similar features with Facebook.)

•	
Photo sharing: Such websites are dedicated to sharing photos between 
users online. The most popular ones are Instagram (https://www.
instagram.com) and Flicker (https://www.flickr.com).
•	
Video sharing: Such websites are dedicated to sharing videos, 
including live video broadcasts. The most popular one is https://
www.youtube.com. Sharing multimedia content is feasible via social 
networking sites such as Facebook (which offers live video broadcast) 
and LinkedIn. However, video-sharing sites—like YouTube.com—
are dedicated to sharing multimedia content and contain a limited 
amount of text within them (mainly allowing users to comment on 
the uploaded videos).
•	
Blogs: This is a type of informational website containing a set of 
posts—belonging to one topic or subject—organized in descending 
order according to the publish date. A first blogs were based on 
static HTML content and created/operated by one author. With 
the advance of web publishing tools and the emergence of Web 
2.0 technology—which simplifies posting content online by 
nontechnical users—blog usage has been boosted and become 
available to anyone who wants to have a place online to share his/her 
ideas. The most popular blogging platforms are WordPress (https://
wordpress.com) and Blogger (https://www.blogger.com), which is 
powered by Google.
•	
Microblog: This allows users to publish a short text paragraph (which 
can be associated with an image or video) or a link (URL) to be shared 
with other audience online. The most popular microblogs are Twitter 
(https://twitter.com) and Tumbler (https://www.tumblr.com).
•	
Forums (message board): This is one of the oldest types of social 
media. It allows users to share ideas, opinions, expertise, information, 
and news and discuss it with other users in a form of posted messages 
and replies. Forums usually come organized into topics. The most 
popular ones now are Reddit (https://www.reddit.com) and Quora | 
(https://www.quora.com).

Social gaming: This refers to playing games online with other players 
in different locations. Social games allow users to collaborate from 
different parts around the world to form teams or to challenge other 
individuals/groups. Facebook has many social games that can be 
played within a user’s web browser; you can check them out at 
https://www.facebook.com/games.
•	
Social bookmarking: These websites offer a similar function to your web 
browser’s typical bookmark. However, they allow you to do this online 
and share your Internet bookmarks among your friends in addition 
to adding annotations and tags to your saved bookmarks. Many 
bookmarking services allow their users to sync the bookmarks with 
any device or browser, making your bookmarks accessible on multiple 
devices at the same time. The most popular bookmarking services 
are Atavi (https://atavi.com), Pinterest (www.pinterest.com), and 
Pocket (https://getpocket.com).
•	
Product/service review: These websites allow their users to review—
give feedback—about any product or service they have used. Other 
people will find such reviews useful to aid them in their buying 
decisions. The most popular review sites are Yelp (https://www.
yelp.com) and Angie’s List (www.angieslistbusinesscenter.com).
Popular Social Networking Sites
Not all social media sites have the same popularity among users worldwide. Figure 5-3 
shows statistics published by Statista.com in September 2017 listing the most popular 
social media sites ranked by number of active users (in millions). The nature of social 
media sites is changing rapidly, so such statistics are expected to change frequently 
during the course of the year. However, the major players are expected to continue 
dominating the social media market for the near future.
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

Investigating Social Media Sites
In this section, we discuss the most popular social media sites and demonstrate how 
to conduct a smarter search on each one to extract useful and hidden information 
that cannot be fetched using each site’s standard search function. The focus will be on 
social networking sites because searching within multimedia content was covered in 
the previous chapter. These sites contain a wealth of personal information and social 
interactions that can be useful for online investigations.
Facebook
Facebook (www.facebook.com) is the most popular social networking site with the 
largest active user base on Earth. Facebook has currently more than 2 billion active users 
worldwide. Facebook is an American company; founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, 
it was originally developed for Harvard University students to share social information. 
However, it expanded its membership later to accept students from different U.S. 
universities. In 2006, Facebook allowed anyone—older than 13 years old with a valid 
email address—to become a registered member and use its service.

Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

212
Facebook is so popular that anyone who have an Internet connection worldwide 
is expected to have a Facebook account! Facebook facilitates sharing different types 
of online content (images, videos, text messages, live broadcast, check-ins) between 
people, which is what makes it popular among varied user groups around the globe.
A lot of information can be found in each Facebook user account. For instance, to create 
a Facebook account, you need to supply your email (or phone number) as a username, a 
password, your date of birth, and your gender. After creating and activating your Facebook 
account, you can add more information about yourself such as work and education 
information, places you have lived in, contact information (email, phone number, address, 
a public key for receiving encrypted messages), religious and political views, languages, 
other social accounts (Twitter and LinkedIn), your personal blog or website, family and 
relationships, and other information about you in addition to live events.
Facebook allows its registered users to do different social interactions such as the 
following:
•	
Share updates, photos, videos, and geolocation data (e.g., your 
current location using the check-in feature) with friends
•	
See friends’ updates/posts, respond with comments, and like or share 
their updates
•	
Invite your friends to join groups and attend events
•	
Chat using Facebook Messenger and send direct private messages to 
another Facebook member
•	
Play online games within your web browser (multiplayers games are 
supported)
•	
Follow company/brand news
•	
Make connections with your favorite actors, celebrities, and other 
public entities
•	
Use Facebook account credentials to sign into different services 
across the Web
•	
Make live video broadcasts using Facebook Live (https://live.fb.com)
•	
Get Facebook support, which implements a variety of privacy settings 
on all content published by its users to restrict content visibility 
according to each user need
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

213
As noted, the sum of personal information and social interactions available publicly 
on Facebook provides a wealth of information for any OSINT gathering. As we already 
said, gathering personal information from Facebook about any target is dependent on 
the privacy controls set for their updates and social interactions. However, many studies 
show that the majority of Facebook users do not give much thought to privacy issues 
when using this platform.
The data volume stored within the Facebook database is huge. Facebook stores 
about 300 petabytes of data (in March 2017).vii This is equal to 300,000,000 gigabytes. 
Every minute on Facebook, 510,000 comments are posted, 293,000 statuses are updated, 
and 136,000 photos are uploaded.viii To locate information within this jungle, Facebook 
has developed its own search mechanism to simplify searching for different content 
types generated by its users’ interactions, and this what we will cover in the next section.
Facebook Graph Search
Facebook offers an advanced semantic search engine to locate anything within its 
database by using natural English language phrases and keywords. This semantic 
search engine is called Graph Search and was first introduced in early 2013; it allows 
Facebook users to type in their queries in the Facebook search box to return accurate 
results based on their questions/phrases or combined keywords. The returned results 
are quite informative and different from the traditional search approach, which works 
by returning lists of links based on searched keywords only. For example, you can type 
Pages liked by my friends and Facebook will return a list of pages liked by all your 
friends list, or you can simply type Pages liked by ********, replacing the asterisks with 
the target’s Facebook username, to return a list of pages liked by the specified user.
Note!  You must have a Facebook account to conduct the searches used in this 
chapter. It is advisable to use a dummy email account when creating this account 
to avoid revealing your true identity when conducting advanced searches on 
Facebook (specifically applicable to law enforcement).
Warning!  Facebook policy prohibits opening accounts with false identities. Take 
this into consideration when using visible Facebook data for a lawsuit.
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

214
Now, to use the Facebook Graph Search, you need first to sign into your Facebook 
account and then change your account language settings to use the English language 
(US). After doing this, your account is ready to use Facebook Graph Search. To change 
your Facebook account language, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Log in to your Facebook account and click the down arrow shown 
at the top-right corner of your screen.
	 2.	 Click Settings to access the account settings where you can change 
all your Facebook account settings (see Figure 5-4).
	 3.	 Click Languages on the left side of the page, and make sure that 
the option “What language do you want to use Facebook in?” is set 
to English (US), as shown in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-4.  Accessing Facebook account settings
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

215
After updating your Facebook account to use the English (US) language and thus 
activating Graph Search, you can type in Facebook search bar anything you want to 
search for. For instance, you can search for people, your target’s friends, places (towns, 
countries, historical places), things, photos, pages, groups, apps, events, and restaurants, 
in addition to entertainment such as music, movies or games. Once your search criteria 
is entered into the search bar, Facebook will show a list of suggestions; you can either 
select something from the list or opt for your entered one (see Figure 5-6).

search query
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

216
Knowing how to use Facebook Graph Search is important for online investigators 
to exploit Facebook’s repository of data. Each Facebook account—or page—is linked 
to its user social interactions (like, tag, share, friends list, work, university/school and 
education information, movie, song, events, geolocation data, and locations). The 
investigator has to type the right search query to fetch such results. In a nutshell, Graph 
Search helps you to map each Facebook account to its associated activities on Facebook.
Now we’ll give some examples of Facebook Graph Search queries to activate your 
imagination on how to build different search queries to extract accurate results from 
Facebook.
To search for people on Facebook, use these queries:
•	
Peoples named [FirstName LastName] who live in [City, State]. Here’s 
an example: people named Nihad Hassan who live in Buffalo, 
New York.
•	
People who live in [city, state] and are [single/married] and like 
[something]. Here’s an example: people who work in Seattle, 
Washington and are single and like Lebanese restaurants.
•	
People who are [Profession Name] and live in [City, State]. Here’s an 
example: People who are Programmer and live in London, UK.
•	
People who like [Page Name] and live in [Place]. Here’s an example: 
people who like apress and live in New York, USA.
•	
People who work at [Company]. Here’s an example: people who 
work at Apress. This query can be refined to search for people 
working at the Apress company as authors: people who work at 
Apress as author (see Figure 5-7).
•	
People who live in [Country] and like [Page Name]. Here’s an 
example: people who live in USA and like Al-Qaeda.
Figure 5-7.  Finding people who work at a specific company with a specific role
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

217
To search for specific pages on Facebook, try the following queries:
•	
Pages named [Name]. Here’s an example: pages named Al-Qaeda.
•	
Pages liked by [Name]. Here’s an example: Pages liked by Mark 
Zuckerberg.
•	
Pages liked by [Profession]. Here’s an example: pages liked by 
teachers.
To search for professions, businesses, or services, try the following search queries:
•	
Dentist in [City]. Here’s an example: Dentist in Manhattan, 
New York.
•	
[Profession Name] named [Name]. Here’s an example: Teachers 
named John Walker.
To search for posts, use these:
•	
Posts liked by people who like [Page]. Here’s an example: Posts liked 
by people who like Apress.
•	
Posts liked by people who live in [city, state] and work at [company]. 
Here’s an example: Posts liked by people who live in Dallas, Texas 
and work at Google.
•	
Posts by [FirstName LastName] from year. Here’s an example: Posts 
by Nihad Hassan from the year 2011.
Tip!  Monitoring a target’s “post time” on Facebook may reveal what time the 
person wakes up each day.
Note!  Using Facebook Graph Search may return a large number of results. To 
refine your search results, you can use the Graph Search filters on the left side of 
the page (see Figure 5-8).
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

218
To use the advanced Facebook Graph Search, you need to know the target’s 
Facebook profile ID (pages and groups also have their own IDs). To get the target’s 
Facebook profile ID manually, do the following:
	 1.	 Go to the target’s Facebook page, right-click the page and select 
View Page Source (see Figure 5-9).
Figure 5-8.  The Facebook Graph Search filters help you to refine your  
search results
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

219
	 2.	 Press Ctrl+F (in IE, Firefox, Chrome, or Opera) to search within 
the HTML source code. Enter profile_id as the search criteria.  
The number beside it is the target Facebook unique profile ID  
(see Figure 5-10).
After knowing how to find target Facebook profile ID (the same applies to Facebook 
pages and groups), let’s use it to find a list of publicly viewable photos of a target. This 
time, you will insert your search query in a browser’s address bar instead of using the 
Facebook search bar.
A Graph Search web address always starts with this: https://www.facebook.com/
search/.
To search for photos liked by a target Facebook user, type the query shown in 
Figure 5-11 in a browser’s address bar (the highlighted number points to the target’s 
Facebook profile ID).
Figure 5-9.  Viewing a target’s Facebook page HTML code to find their profile ID
Figure 5-10.  Finding the unique Facebook profile ID
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

220
In the same way, you can modify the query to return photos commented on or 
tagged by the target user.
Note!  Replace the number 100003886582037 with your target Facebook profile 
ID in all the following queries.
Use https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/photos-commented to 
find photos commented on by the target.
Use https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/photos-tagged to find 
all photos tagged with a target profile.
The photos-of query returns all photos uploaded by the target’s profile in addition to 
all photos where the target was tagged or mentioned; consider this query as a container 
for showing all publicly available photos of a target profile: https://www.facebook.com/
search/100003886582037/photos-of.
Note!  Facebook Photo queries also work for Videos. Replace photos with 
videos in your search query.
To see a list of places visited by your target profile, use this: https://www.facebook.
com/search/100003886582037/places-visited.
To see a list of places liked by target profile, use this: https://www.facebook.com/
search/100003886582037/places-liked.
To see a list of places checked in at, use this: https://www.facebook.com/
search/100003886582037/places-checked-in.
To see the target’s friend list (if it is set to public), use the following: https://www.
facebook.com/search/100003886582037/friends. This will also reveal when each 
Facebook friendship began (see Figure 5-12).
Figure 5-11.  Searching for photos liked by a target Facebook user
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

221
To see a list of events attended by target profile, use this: https://www.facebook.
com/search/100003886582037/events-joined.
If your target Facebook account has not restricted their friend list from public view, 
you can also conduct the following queries on your target Facebook friends:
•	
To see a list of photos uploaded by target friends, type the following 
query: https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/
friends/photos-uploaded.
•	
To see a list of photos liked by target friends, use this: ­https://www.
facebook.com/search/100003886582037/friends/photos-liked.
•	
To see a list of photos commented on by target friends, use this: 
https://www.facebook.com/search/100003886582037/friends/
photos-commented.
•	
To see the places visited by target friends, use this https://www.
facebook.com/search/100003886582037/friends/places-visited.
•	
To see the friends of target friends, use this: ­https://www.facebook.
com/search/100003886582037/friends/friends.

Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

222
Note!  Before using Facebook Graph Search, always begin your search on 
Facebook using your target’s full name (if you have it). Although Facebook prohibits 
registering with false names, there is a great number of Facebook accounts with 
false names, so you cannot always depend on searching by name. As a second 
option, try to search using the target’s Facebook email address and phone number 
(if you have them). Please note that searching using email and phone numbers 
will return no results if the target’s privacy control is set to prevent them from 
appearing on Facebook search. If nothing gives you the required results, try to 
access the target target’s known associate profiles; you may find something that 
can help you to find your target’s real profile.
Other Useful Facebook Graph Search Commands
To search for all people who like a specific page on Facebook, type the query shown in 
Figure 5-13 in your browser address bar, replacing the highlighted number with your 
target page profile ID.
Tracking Photos Downloaded from Facebook to Its Source Profile
When a user uploads a photo to Facebook, its name will get changed upon saving it in the 
Facebook database. The new name will usually consist of three long numbers, and the 
file will be in the JPG format. The second number is relevant to the Facebook profile that 
upload this image to Facebook originally. To know the source Facebook account behind 
this image, copy the second number and paste it after Facebook web address  
www.facebook.com/. This should take you to the source Facebook profile (see Figure 5-­14).  
For this tip to work, the image of interest should be posted publicly or your Facebook 
account must be a friend of the target profile if the image was originally shared with the 
friend circle.
Figure 5-13.  Finding all people who like a specific page on Facebook
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

223
Note!  Many Facebook users use the same profile photo across different social 
platforms. To conduct a reverse image search to see where a particular Facebook 
profile photo appears online, use a service like Google Images (https://
images.google.com) or Tineye (www.tineye.com).

224
Using Google to Search Facebook Content
Google can be used effectively to search within Facebook public pages using the 
site:facebook.com search operator, which limits a Google search to a specified website 
only. Other Google advanced search operators—already covered in Chapter 4—can be 
used to locate accurate information within Facebook. See Figure 5-15 for an example.
Search for Hashtags on Facebook
To search for posts, photos, or pages that have hashtags, type the Facebook address into 
the web browser address bar followed by the specified hashtag, as in https://www.
facebook.com/hashtag.
For example, entering https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/Terrorism will display 
related contents on Facebook that carry the #Terrorism hashtag.
Tip!  You can search multiple social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, 
Instagram) for a specific hashtag by going to https://www.hashatit.com.
Using Automated Services to Facilitate Facebook Graph Search
Searching using Facebook Graph Search is easy; you need to use your imagination and 
create queries that best suit your needs. There are online services that facilitate using 
Graph Search; all you need to do is to enter target Facebook username or profile ID, and 
the online service will conduct the advanced search queries—already discussed—for 
you (of course, only public viewable information will appear). The following are the most 
popular Facebook Graph Search generators.
Figure 5-15.  Using a Google advanced search operator to locate information 
within Facebook

225
Facebook Scanner
This website (https://stalkscan.com) allows you to investigate the public information 
of any Facebook user. To use this service, enter the Facebook URL of the target profile, 
and the site will populate the page with all the public social interactions produced by the 
profile of interest (see Figure 5-16).
Graph
This site (http://graph.tips) offers a simple graphical user interface to use the 
Facebook Graph Search to locate public information about any Facebook user. You 
need to supply the target’s Facebook username (which can be extracted from visiting 
the target’s Facebook profile page, as shown in Figure 5-17), and the website will do the 
remaining work for you.
Figure 5-16.  This site can reveal public information from any Facebook profile

peoplefindThor
This site (https://peoplefindthor.dk) is a Facebook Graph Search generator with the 
most commonly used filters (see Figure 5-18).
Socmint
This site (http://socmint.tools) facilitates fetching information using Facebook Graph 
Search.
Facebook Graph Search is continually evolving as are its commands. Success in 
exploiting this search engine requires trial and error to find the query that returns 
the best results. You can achieve this by trying different variations of the same query 
Figure 5-17.  The Facebook username (highlighted) is different from the name 
chosen by the user when creating an account (which appears in the Facebook 
search bar when visiting the target’s profile page)
Figure 5-18.  peoplefindThor Facebook search filter
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

227
(changing the query wording) to get the desired result. Bear in mind that Graph Search 
can be somehow dependent on your friend and mutual friend lists; the spread and 
diversity of your Facebook network can affect the overall Graph Search’s generated 
results.
Online Facebook Search Tools/Services
There are many online services that simplify the process of acquiring/analyzing 
information from Facebook accounts. The following are the most useful ones:
•

Collecting Local Copy of Target Facebook Data
If you are collecting evidence from Facebook for a lawsuit, make sure to save a copy of 
your findings (evidence) somewhere on your computer. Facebook is managed by its users, 
and any public post/photo can be suddenly deleted or become private by its owner. To 
save a copy of the posts or public profiles, save the page using your browser by selecting 
File and then Save Page As. Or you can simply print the specified page on paper. You can 
also take a screen capture of the page and save it as an image on your local computer.
OSINT analysts may need an offline version of the target’s Facebook data to make 
an advanced offline analysis or to create reports about a specific user profile or page. 
The Facebook native user interface does not provide any means of saving or printing a 
profile data for offline use, and saving a public profile page as an HTML page may not be 
a convenient solution, especially when you want to save a long page. http://le-tools.
com has developed a tool named ExtractFace to automate the extraction of data from 
Facebook profiles. To use this tool, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Download the tool from https://sourceforge.net/projects/
extractface/?source=typ_redirect. Currently, the following 
prerequisites should be implemented before using this tool:
•	
You need to access your Facebook account using the Firefox ESR 
edition, which can be downloaded from https://www.mozilla.
org/en-US/firefox/organizations/all/.
•	
You need the MozRepl add-on, which can be found at https://
addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mozrepl/. After 
installing this add-on, you need to start it or set the “Activate on 
startup” option to start it automatically when Firefox launches 
(see Figure 5-19).
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

229
•	
And of course you need to have a valid Facebook account, and 
you must sign into it when using this tool.
Warning!  Deactivate your firewall or allow connections to port 4242 before using 
this tool.
	 2.	 To begin harvesting the target’s Facebook data, go to the target’s 
profile and right-click the ExtractFace icon—which is located in the 
Windows taskbar—to launch its options menu (see Figure 5-20).
Figure 5-19.  Starting the MozRepl add-on or setting it to start automatically upon 
launching Firefox
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

230
	 3.	 The first option in the menu is Scroll and Expand. It is advisable to 
use this option first before collecting the target’s friends, timeline, 
and comments (posts, photos, and video comments) as it will 
automate the process of scrolling through the entire page until the 
end before harvesting its data. This is necessary to avoid acquiring 
partial results from this tool when visiting lengthy pages or when 
you have slow Internet connection.
For example, to harvest a target’s Facebook friend list, go first to the target’s 
Facebook friend page, click the Scroll and Expand option to begin scrolling across the 
entire page, and click Dump Friends. A pop-up menu will appear asking you to select 
where you want to store your dump files. Select the location, and finally click the “Dump 
now” button (see Figure 5-21).
Figure 5-20.  Viewing ExtractFace options
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

231
Most ExtractFace tool functions work with all people, pages, and group profiles.
Tip!  Facebook does not notify the user when someone visits their Facebook 
profile or views their photo or video.
If you come across a locked-down Facebook profile (we mean here an account that 
has tightened privacy controls by hiding its friend list), you can reverse engineer 
the list of friends from the likes and tags associated with this account.
Twitter
Twitter is the most popular microblogging social media platform with an average 330 
million active users monthly (as of the third quarter of 2017).ix It launched in 2006 with a 
main focus on sending SMS mobile communications messages online. Twitter allowed 
its users to post tweets with 140 characters. In 2017, Twitter expanded its characters 
count to allow 280 characters. Tweets can contain photos, short videos, and URLs in 
addition to text.
Figure 5-21.  Dumping a target’s Facebook friends list using the ExtractFace tool
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

232
Twitter is mainly used to connect people with the same interests based on the 
content posted. To build online communities, Twitter use hashtags (prefixed with pound 
symbol, #) to group similar topics or subjects. People—even when they do not know 
each other—can engage in conversation based on a hashtag.
To register on Twitter, you need to have a phone number or email address to activate 
your account. In addition to a password, Twitter does not enforce using real names when 
registering for an account. Twitter uses the name handle to mean a Twitter username. 
A Twitter handle begins with the @ sign followed by alphanumeric characters without 
spaces (e.g., @darknessgate). A Twitter handle can be used to mention someone in 
public tweets or to send someone a private message. When using Twitter, you can follow 
other Twitter public profiles, and their updates will appear in your timeline.
Twitter allows you to conduct live video broadcasts using the Twitter Periscope 
service; you need to use the Twitter official app for this to work using your Android or 
Apple device.
Although the nature of Twitter does not provide the wealth of personal information 
provided by Facebook or LinkedIn (covered next), it’s still considered a powerful social 
media platform that can reveal useful OSINT information about some targets when 
investigated properly. For instance, geolocation data, personal interests, political 
and religious views, trips, and friends can be revealed by checking someone’s Twitter 
account.
Twitter Search
Twitter has a simple search functionality located in the upper-right side of the screen—
when using the Twitter web interface—after logging into your Twitter account. A 
Twitter simple search allows you to perform a basic search within the Twitter database. 
However, do not underestimate this little box, as you can add advanced search 
operators—similar to Google advanced search operators—to your search query to force 
it to dive deep and return accurate results, as you are going to see next.
The best place to begin your Twitter search is to go to the Twitter search home 
at https://twitter.com/search-home (see Figure 5-22). From here, you can either 
conduct simple searches (e.g., search for Twitter profiles or tweets) or click “advanced 
search” to go to the Twitter advanced search page where you can set different filters on 
your search.

Twitter Advanced Search Operators
The Twitter database is getting larger daily. About 8,000 tweets are posted each second.x 
This is equal to 480,000 tweets each minute. To find your way within this huge volume 
of data, it is necessary to use advanced search operators to refine your searches. The 
following search operators can be incorporated into a Twitter simple search to find 
related tweets more precisely:
•	
Use the “” operator to search for an exact phrase or word. Here’s an 
example: “OSINT intelligence”.
•	
To search for more than one search term, use the OR operator. Here’s 
an example: OSINT OR intelligence (this will search for tweets 
containing either the word OSINT or the word Intelligence or both).
•	
The negation operator (-) is used to exclude specific keywords or 
phrases from search results. Here’s an example: virus -computer. 
(This will search for tweets with the word Virus but not related to 
computer viruses.) The negation query can be expanded to exclude 
more words/phrases using the OR operator like this: Eiffel tower-
(trip OR new year OR vacation). This will search for Eiffel tower and 
exclude tweets about trip and new year and vacation.
Figure 5-22.  Twitter home search page
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

234
•	
To search for tweets containing a specific hashtag, use the (#) pound 
sign. Here’s an example: #OSINT (this will search for all tweets 
containing the OSINT hashtag).
•	
To search for tweets sent from a specific Twitter account, use the 
operator from. Here’s an example: from:darknessgate (this will 
retrieve all tweets sent from the darknessgate account. You can filter 
the results based on people, photos, news, etc. (see Figure 5-23).
•	
The to operator followed by the Twitter handle will show all tweets 
sent to a specific person. Here’s an example: to:darknessgate (this 
will retrieve all tweets sent to the darknessgate account). You can 
filter the results based on people, photos, news, etc., as we did with 
the from operator.
•	
To find all tweets that reference a specific Twitter account, use the 
@ operator. Here’s an example: @darknessgate (this will retrieve all 
tweets that reference the darknessgate account).
•	
To search for tweets sent from a specific location, use the near 
operator followed by the location name. Here’s an example: “happy 
birthday” near New York (this will search for tweets containing the 
exact phrase happy birthday and sent from near New York).
•	
To search for tweets sent from within a specific distance from 
a specific location, use the within operator. Here’s an example: 
near:LA within:15mi (this will return tweets sent within 15 miles 
from Los Angeles).
Figure 5-23.  You can use Twitter default filters to narrow your search results 
within a specific result set after using the From operator
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

235
•	
To search for tweets sent since a specific date, use the since operator 
followed by the date. Here’s an example: OSINT since:2014-11-30 
(this will return all tweets containing OSINT and sent since 
November 11, 2014).
•	
To search for tweets sent up to a specific date, use the until operator. 
Here’s an example: OSINT until:2015-11-30 (this will return all 
tweets containing OSINT and sent until date November 30, 2015).
•	
To find all tweets that ask a question, use the ? operator. Here’s an 
example: OSINT ? (this will return all tweets containing OSINT and 
asking a question).
The Filter operator is powerful to filter results based on different criteria. The 
following are examples of the most popular filters:
•	
To search within a Twitter conversation, use the filter operator with 
the replies keyword. Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:replies (this 
will return all tweets that contain the keyword OSINT and are replies 
to other tweets).
•	
Use the images keyword to return tweets that contain an image within 
it. Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:images (this will return all tweets 
that contain the keyword OSINT and have an image embedded 
within them).
•	
To return tweets with video embedded with them, use the videos 
keyword (similar to the images filter). Here’s an example: OSINT 
Filter:videos.
•	
To return tweets containing an uploaded video, Amplify video, or 
Periscope video, use the native_video operator. Here’s an example: 
OSINT filter:native_video (this will return all tweets containing the 
search keyword OSINT that have an uploaded video, Amplify video, 
or Periscope video).
•	
To return tweets with either image or video, use the media operator. 
Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:media.
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

236
•	
To return tweets with a news URL linked to them, use the news 
keyword. Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:news (this will return 
tweets containing OSINT within them that are mentioned by a news 
source).
•	
To return tweets that contain a link (URL) within them, use the links 
keyword. Here’s an example: OSINT Filter:links.
•	
To return text-only tweets, use the text keyword. Here’s an example: 
OSINT Filter:text.
•	
To return tweets from verified users only (verified accounts have a 
blue check mark near their names), use the Verified operator. Here’s 
an example: OSINT Filter:verified.
Tip!  You can use the negation operator (-) with the Filter operator to reverse 
the examples already mentioned. For example, typing OSINT -Filter:images will 
return all tweets containing the OSINT search keyword but not containing images 
embedded within them.
•	
To search for video uploaded using the Twitter Periscope service, 
use the Periscope filter. Here’s an example: OSINT filter:periscope 
(this will search for all tweets containing the OSINT keyword with a 
Periscope video URL).
To search for tweets according to the number of likes, replies, and retweets, use the 
following operators:
•	
Use the min_retweets: operator followed by a number. Here’s an 
example: OSINT min_retweets:50 (this will return all tweets 
containing the OSINT search keyword that have been retweeted at 
least 50 times).
•	
Use the min_replies: operator followed a number to return all tweets 
with NUMBER or more replies. Here’s an example: OSINT min_
replies:11 (this will return all tweets containing the OSINT search 
keyword that have 11 or more replies).
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

237
•	
Use min_faves: followed by a number to return all tweets with 
NUMBER or more likes. Here’s an example: OSINT min_faves:11 
(this will return all tweets that have at least 11 or more likes and that 
contain the OSINT search keyword).
•	
To exclude retweets, use the -RT operator. Here’s an example: 
OSINT—RT (this will search for all tweets containing the OSINT 
search keyword but exclude all retweets).
•	
To search for tweets from a specific source, use the source 
operator followed by the source name. Here’s an example: OSINT 
source:tweetdeck (this will return all tweets containing OSINT and 
sent from tweetdeck (common sources are tweetdeck, twitter_for_
iphone, twitter_for_android, and twitter_web_client).
•	
To limit Twitter returned results to a specific language, use the lang 
operator. Here’s an example: OSINT lang:en (this will return all 
tweets containing OSINT in the English language only). To see a list 
of Twitter-supported language codes, go to https://dev.twitter.
com/web/overview/languages.
Note!  Twitter allows you to save up to 25 saved searches per account. To save 
your current search result, click “More search actions” at the top of your results 
page and then click “Save this search.”
Please note that you can combine more than one Twitter advanced search 
operator to conduct a more precise search. For example, type “OSINT intelligence” 
from:darknessgate -Filter:replies lang:en to get only the tweets containing the exact 
phrase OSINT intelligence from the user darknessgate that are not replies to other users 
and in the English language only.
Twitter Advanced Search Page
The Twitter advanced search page (https://twitter.com/search-advanced) allows you 
to set different filters (language, location, keywords, date/time range) to return the best 
results. You can search for people, hashtags, and photos in any topic (see Figure 5-24).
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

238

require access to your account (see Figure 5-25).
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

241
Google+
This is a social networking site owned by Google. It is theoretically considered the 
second largest social media site—after Facebook—in terms of number of registered 
users. (Google has more than 1.2 billion active monthly users of its free Gmail email 
service.)However, we cannot conclude that the same number of users is really using the 
social platform Google+.
The most popular service offered by Google is Gmail, which gives free email service 
to any Google registered user around the globe, with excellent features in terms of 
reliability, availability, and storage space. To use any of Google products (e.g., YouTube, 
Google Drive, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Docs), you need to have a Google account. 
After signing up for a Google account, you can activate a Google+ account with one click. 
The nature of this means that the actual number of Google+ users may be much less 
than the announced statistics. In fact, a study conducted in 2015xi shows that the number 
of active users on Google+ is less than 1 percent of the total Google users. A recent 
statistic conducted in September 4, 2017,xii showed that the total number of unique 
Google+ monthly visits is 34 million, which is far less than its direct rival Facebook.
Figure 5-25.  Sample warning issued by Twitter about a third party that requires 
wide access permission to your account
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

242
Google+ offers similar social interactions to Facebook; people can post status 
updates, and these updates can be text only or contain—in addition to text—a photo, 
poll, link (URL), or location. The privacy level of each post can be adjusted according 
to a user’s needs. The Google+ approach to privacy controls is through circles. Contrary 
to Facebook, anyone can add someone to their circle (which is conceptually a list of 
people) without the need for the other person to add the requester back. This approach 
is similar to Twitter; people can follow each other to see their updates, but a follow 
relationship can occur in one direction only (e.g., Nihad can follow Susan, but Susan 
does not have to follow Nihad).
The Google+ default circle names are Friends, Family, and Acquaintances. The user 
can create as many circles as needed and can add other people to them. When posting 
updates to Google+, a user selects which circles they want to share these updates with 
(see Figure 5-26). Please note that circles are private, so other people will not know in 
which circle you have put them.
We will not delve deeply into Google+ as the actual number of active users is 
significantly small. In the next section, we will show some techniques to search for 
people within this platform.
Figure 5-26.  Google+ privacy controls
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

243
Searching Google+
Similar to other social networks, Google+ allows its users to have a profile that shows 
some personal information about them. They can adjust the privacy settings of each 
section of the profile. Some Google+ profile information will also appear across all 
Google services. The shared data with other Google services includes the following: 
contact information, education, places (similar to the Facebook check-in feature), links 
(e.g., personal blog or LinkedIn profile), personal information (gender, birthday), skills, 
and personal photos.
To begin your search, start with the search bar located at the top of the page and type 
the person you want to search for. Google+ will give suggestions while you type. The 
returned results—on the next page—will be grouped into four categories: Communities, 
People and Pages, Collections, and Posts (see Figure 5-27).
Google+ Advanced Search Operator
Like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, Google+ has specialized search operators to help 
you find precise results easily. The following are the most popular ones.
Note!  Before using the Google+ advanced search operators, you need to know 
how to find a Google+ profile ID of any user (the username).
	1.	 Log in to your Google+ profile.
	2.	 Click the Profile tab on the left side of the screen.
	3.	 Look at the URL in the address bar. The set of characters after  
http://plus.google.com/ is your Google ID (see Figure 5-28).
Figure 5-27.  Searching within Google+ using its built-in search functionality
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

244
	4.	 To see other users’ Google IDs, go to each user profile and check the URL in the 
address bar for the target Google profile ID.
Please note that many Google+ profiles are still using numbers. However, active 
users have the option to use a customized URL that reflects their real names. 
Fetching Google+ IDs composed of letters is similar to ones with numbers; you 
need to copy the letters from the URL (beginning at the +sign).
•	
To search for hashtags—similar to Twitter—use the pound (#) 
symbol. Here’s an example: #OSINT.
•	
Use the form operator to search for posts posted by a specific user. 
Here’s an example: from: 106061931199710505959 (replace the 
number with your target Google ID, which can also be composed of 
letters for some accounts).
•	
To search for posts by specific type of content, uses the has search 
operator. Here’s an example: OSINT has:photo (this will return all 
posts containing OSINT that have an image embedded within them). 
The photo part can be replaced with any of the following types: 
attachment, poll, video, doc, slides, spreadsheet.
Figure 5-28.  Extracting the Google+ ID from a URL
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

245
•	
To search for posts before or after a specific date, use the before 
or after operator. The date format should be as follows: YYYY-­
MM-­DD. Here’s an example: OSINT before:2017-01-16 | OSINT 
after:2018-01-01.
•	
To find posts commented on by a specific user, use the commenter 
operator followed by the target Google ID. Here’s an example: 
commenter:106061931199710505959.
•	
To find all posts that mention a specific user, use the mention 
operator. Here’s an example: mention: 106061931199710505959.
•	
To search for posts in a specific community or collection, use 
the in operator. Before giving examples on how to search within 
communities/collections, follow these steps to find the community 
or the collection ID on Google+.
	 1.	
Log in to your Google+ profile.
	 2.	
Go to the target community/collection, check the browser 
address bar, and copy the string of numbers and letters at the 
end of the URL (see Figure 5-29).
•	
To search within Google+ communities, use [Search 
Keyword] in:community (replace the word community with 
the target’s community ID). Here’s an example: pentesting 
in:112627574116901792152 (this will search for the keyword 
pentestingin the target’s community, which has the Google+ ID 
112627574116901792152).
Figure 5-29.  Community ID (highlighted in colors) extracted from Google+ 
community URL
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

246
•	
To search within Google+ collections, use [Search keyword] 
in:collection (replace the word collection with the target’s collection 
ID). Here’s an example: hacking in:gAAAZ (this will search for 
hacking within a collection named gAAAZ).
•	
Google+ allows you to use the three logical operators (AND, OR, 
NOT), but you must write them in capital letters. Here’s an example 
for using each one:
•	
Use the NOT operator for negation. Here’s an example: 
from:106061931199710505959 NOT has:photo (this 
will search for all posts sent by the user whose Google ID 
106061931199710505959 and not containing a photo). Please 
note that the NOT operator can be replaced with the minus sign 
(-) (from:106061931199710505959—has:photo).
•	
The AND operator is used to search for multiple search keywords. 
Google+ will automatically add it when separating your search 
keywords with a space, so there is no need to add it manually. 
Here’s an example: from:106061931199710505959 AND 
from:101607398135470979957 (this will search for posts from 
two Google+ accounts).
•	
The OR operator is used to search posts for one or more search 
keywords. Here’s an example: OSINT has:doc OR has:photo OR 
has:spreadsheet (this will search for the keyword OSINT in posts 
that contain doc or photo or spreadsheet within it).
Using Google to Search Within Google+
The Google search engine can be used effectively to search within Google+. As you 
have done many times before, use the site operator to limit your search to Google+ only 
(site:plus.google.com). Here are some examples:
•	
“PERSON NAME” site:plus.google.com (replace PERSON NAME 
with target name)
•	
“Work at COMPANY NAME” site:plus.google.com (replace 
COMPANY NAME with target company)
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

247
Searching Google+ Using a Google Custom Search Engine
Here are the most popular Google custom search engines to search within Google Plus 
profiles:
•	
Google+ Collections & Communities (http://goo.gl/A8MB7z)
•	
Google Plus Stalker (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=0
01394533911082033616%3Asvzu2yy2jqg)

•	
Google-Plus Profiles (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=
009462381166450434430:cc5gkv2g7nk)
•	
Retrieve Google+ profiles that have an email address and phone 
number shared publicly (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?
cx=009462381166450434430:cotywcrgpru)
Other Useful Services for Google+
Here are some more sites to check out:
•	
Google+ to RSS (https://gplusrss.com): Create an RSS feed of any 
Google+ profile or page. The free version allows for two feeds.
•	
Google+ User Feed (http://plusfeed.frosas.net): With this site, 
you can monitor the feeds of Google+ users. It’s useful to monitor 
your target’s posts without visiting their Google+ page.
LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a social networking service dedicated to professional interactions in the 
business world. Individuals maintain a profile—similar to a résumé—where they present 
their skills, employment history, and work/project achievements, while corporations 
maintain a page to promote their business activities and announce vacancies.
LinkedIn started in 2003, so it is considered among the older social media sites. 
LinkedIn offers its service in 200 countries, and its interface supports 20 languages. 
The majority of LinkedIn users are in the United States; the second largest segment 
comes from India followed by Brazil. In December 2016, Microsoft acquired LinkedIn. 
Currently, LinkedIn has more than 546 million active users worldwide.xiii
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

248
To have a LinkedIn profile, you must supply your first and last names, email, and a 
password. LinkedIn has a policy to enforce using real names only; actually it does not 
make sense to have a false profile here as the essence of LinkedIn is to make connections 
in the business world, and you need to offer real information to make useful business 
connections. For privacy-minded people, LinkedIn offers different access permissions 
that allow each user to tailor their profile’s viewable data.
The majority of LinkedIn contents cannot be seen without first logging into your 
LinkedIn account. If you try to see a LinkedIn profile while you are not logged in, you 
will encounter a page asking you to register or sign into your account (see Figure 5-30). 
Some LinkedIn users set high privacy control settings on their accounts to prevent other 
LinkedIn members from viewing parts of their profile—including the profile picture—
unless they become connected on LinkedIn.
Individual profiles on LinkedIn (see Figure 5-31) hold their name, profession, 
education, job history (current and previous employment), featured skills and 
endorsements, recommendations, accomplishments, languages spoken, honors and 
Figure 5-30.  A profile view when the requester is not logged into LinkedIn

awards, projects, and interests. People can connect with other professionals on LinkedIn; 
they can also follow other people or corporate pages, and their updates will appear in the 
user timeline feed.
LinkedIn Search
While you are not logged into LinkedIn, you can perform a simple search for people 
using their first and last names. The search form is located at the bottom of the home 
page (see Figure 5-32).
Figure 5-31.  Sample LinkedIn individual profile showing author profile on 
LinkedIn
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

250
The result of a LinkedIn search—while you are not logged—is a list of matched 
names with a summary for each one. If you want to access more information about any 
profile, you need to log in to LinkedIn.
For logged-in users, LinkedIn provides a search bar on top of the page to search for 
people, jobs, posts, companies, groups, and schools. Using this search bar, you can begin 
your simple search, and after fetching the results, you can refine your results set using 
LinkedIn advanced filters.
For example, to search for the keyword Apress, type the search keyword Apress in 
the search bar and hit the Enter button. (Note that while typing your search keywords, 
LinkedIn will give search suggestions that appear in the drop-down list as you type.) 
Look at the top of the results page and click All Filters (see Figure 5-33) to filter the 
results according to your needs (see Figure 5-34). Please note that some LinkedIn pages 
may display LinkedIn search filters on the right side of the page.

251
Warning!  Whenever you visit someone’s profile on LinkedIn, your visit gets 
recorded, and the visited profile will know about it. You can surf LinkedIn 
anonymously—after changing your privacy setting (profile viewing options), but 
you will in turn lose the ability to know who viewed your profile. Please note that 
users with premium LinkedIn accounts will know who viewed their profile even 
when the visitor uses LinkedIn in private mode.
LinkedIn advanced search allows you to search according to the target’s first and 
last names, company, school, and title. You can also specify the geographical location of 
the target to limit your search to one area only. The search can be refined to add other 
LinkedIn members who might have a connection with this target. In addition, you can 
filter according to profile language and target current/previous work.

Advanced LinkedIn Search Operators
Similar to Twitter, LinkedIn allows you to use advanced search operators to refine your 
search. The following are the most popular ones:
•	
To search for an exact phrase, enclose it in quotation marks. The 
same technique can be used to search for profiles that have multiple 
words. Here’s an example: “OSINT intelligence” (this will search for 
the exact phrase enclosed within the quotes).
•	
Use the NOT operator to exclude a particular term. Here’s an 
example: developer NOT designer.
•	
Use the OR operator to include one or more terms together. Here’s an 
example: developer OR designer (searches for either a developer or 
a designer or both).
•	
Use the AND operator to include two or more terms together. Here’s 
an example: developer AND designer (searches for both designer 
and developer). There’s no need to use the AND operator in your 
search because LinkedIn will add it automatically when you search 
for more than one term together; just enter a space between your 
search terms.
•	
Use parentheses to combine search terms. Here’s an example: 
penetration tester NOT (developer OR designer). This will search 
for a penetration tester and ignore both developer and designer from 
search results.
•	
You can leverage Google to search within LinkedIn using the Google 
site operator. Here’s an example: “Nihad Hassan” site:linkedin.com.
Searching LinkedIn Using a Google Custom Search
Google custom search engines can become handy to retrieve some results that cannot 
be fetched easily using typical search engines. The following are a selected set of Google 
custom searches that prove useful in retrieving data from LinkedIn:
•	
Recently Updated Profiles (https://cse.google.com/cse/public
url?cx=009462381166450434430:luit7gbqx2a): This will retrieve 
recently updated profiles from LinkedIn.
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

253
•	
LinkedIn Contact Extractor (https://cse.google.com/cse/publi
curl?cx=001394533911082033616:tm5y1wqwmme): This will extract 
LinkedIn profiles that have their contacts publicly accessible. The 
extracted information includes the Contact, Email, Email2, and 
Email3 fields.
•	
LinkedIn Résumés (https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=0
10561883190743916877:qa_v6ioerxo#gsc.tab=0): This will search 
for updated LinkedIn profiles that have been updated within the past 
month or two.
•	
LinkedIn People Finder (International) (https://cse.google.com/
cse/home?cx=009679435902400177945:psuoqnxowx8): Filter the 
results according to the following countries: United States, Canada, 
United Kingdom, Ireland, India, New Zealand, China, and Australia.
For your OSINT search work, LinkedIn is considered the first place to search for 
people who work in a particular profession to find their employment history. For 
instance, you can figure out a user’s experience by seeing their endorsement skills and 
employment history. The people who endorse the target can also become a target for 
your search to see their relationship with the main target (e.g., their work relationships, 
date when worked together, and which projects they worked on). Remember to adjust 
your account privacy settings to prevent others from knowing your identity when 
conducting searches on LinkedIn.
General Resources for Locating Information 
on Social Media Sites
There are many online services that can be used—in accordance with the search 
techniques already discussed—to find useful information about any target who has a 
presence on one or more of the social media sites.
•	
Buzz Sumo (http://buzzsumo.com): Find the most shared topic or 
subject that is currently trending on major social media platforms.
•	
Key Hole (http://keyhole.co): This offers hashtag and keyword 
tracking across different social media sites; you can track Twitter 
accounts, mentions, and URLs.
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

254
•	
MIT PGP Public Key Server (http://pgp.mit.edu): Search on the 
PGP Public Key Server, which can reveal the target’s email address. 
You can use it to conduct further investigations if a target uploaded 
their public key to such servers.
Note!  You can see a list of all PGP public key servers and check their status at 
https://sks-keyservers.net/status.
Other Social Media Platforms
We mentioned the most popular social media sites in this chapter. However, talking about 
all social platforms that exist in the world today would require a book on its own. There are 
hundreds of active social media sites in the world, and some of them are popular within 
their own societies only (like the Chinese sites). Table 5-1 lists the other—less popular—
social media sites that must also be considered when conducting online investigations.

Pastebin Sites
Pastebin is a text-sharing service; it allows any Internet user to post a large amount of 
text data without even registering at the Pastebin site. Although it is intended to share 
legitimate data, many black hat hackers are using it to distribute stolen data such as 
compromised social media accounts (username and passwords), private IP addresses 
and subnets belonging to various corporations around the world, and user credentials 
taken from different breached online services.

Social Media Psychological Analysis
Social media sites have become integrated into our daily lives. People are using them 
increasingly to publish all types of digital contents online. Up until now, we have focused 
on harvesting data from social sites. However, there is a point that we should not omit 
when conducting analysis of the harvested data: the psychological status of the person 
posting the contents on their profile can also give important information, even more 
than the content itself (in some cases). For instance, the true identity of an anonymous 
Twitter account can be revealed by performing linguistic analysis of the suspect account. 
In addition, suspects can be tracked online by examining the way they use language 
when they chat or when they broadcast their thoughts online (for example, the way a 
target uses capitalization, omits or includes words , and pronounces some words). The 
advances in artificial intelligence systems will make analyzing social media accounts 
more effective and will help investigators uncover the true identity of anonymous social 
media accounts.
Note!  Analyzing online content—especially content found on social media 
platforms—becomes important to the forensic context of crime investigation, 
OSINT intelligence, cyber-exploits, trials, and judicial procedures. This science is 
known as forensic linguistics.
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

257
Analyzing the target’s psychological status of their online content is outside this 
book’s scope. However, there are some online services that can aid you to analyze online 
contents and predict the psychological status of the target upon posting it.
Tone Analyzer
This online service (https://tone-analyzer-demo.mybluemix.net) offers free linguistic 
analysis to detect human feelings—such as joy, fear, sadness, anger, analytical, confident, 
and tentative tones—found in text such as tweets, emails, and Facebook messages  
(see Figure 5-35).
Watson Tone Analyzer
This (https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/) is a cloud-based 
server created by IBM. It analyzes emotions and tones in online content (e.g., Facebook 
posts, reviews, and tweets) to predict the emotional status of the writer. This service can 
be used in different scenarios—other than intelligence—such as understand customer 
needs to better serve them.

258
Facebook and Twitter Prediction
This site (https://applymagicsauce.com/demo.html) predicts your psycho-­
demographic profile. The service can analyze your Facebook and Twitter posts and give 
insight about your personality, which is useful to see what your current social profile says 
about you or about any target. You can also insert any text in the website to predict the 
psycho-demographic profile of its author.
Fake Sport
This site (https://www.fakespot.com) analyzes Amazon, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Apple 
App store user reviews to check the credibility of them.
Review Meta
With this site (https://reviewmeta.com) you can investigate user reviews on Amazon to 
check which one is likely to be fake or misleading.
TweetGenie
This (www.tweetgenie.nl/index.php) is a Dutch project that predicts the target’s age 
and gender from a Twitter username.
Summary
In this chapter, we covered the most popular social media sites worldwide, focusing on 
the one with the highest number of monthly active visitors. In today’s digital age, it is 
rare to see an Internet user who does not have at least one account on one or more social 
media site. People use social media services to post all types of contents online such as 
photos, videos, text messages, and geolocation data. They also mention their education, 
employment history, and the addresses where they live. Personal information such as 
social connections, places visited, habits, likes and dislikes, family members, spouse, 
and more can all be found easily. Although social networking sites allow their users to 
tighten their privacy controls to prevent others from seeing posted content, few people 
care about such issues and post many of their activities—especially text posts and  
Chapter 5  Social Media Intelligence

259
check-­ins—in public status. This makes a large volume of accessible data readily 
available to different kinds of online investigations.
This chapter explained how to search popular social media sites to locate 
information beyond the typical search functionality offered by each service. In the next 
chapter, we will continue the discussion of how to locate information about people 
online by focusing on a specific type of search engines known as people search engines. 
These engine are similar to typical search engines. However, they index content related 
to individuals only. The next chapter will also cover government records (also known 
as public records). These are confidential records produced by local governments, and 
they contain valuable information about specific country citizens. By combining the 
information from people search engines and government records with the information 
harvested from social media sites, you can—almost—find all the information available 
about a specific person online.

CHAPTER 6
People Search Engines 
and Public Records
In today’s digital age, most people have some kind of online presence, either directly or 
indirectly. Other entities—such as government and local authorities—also store some 
type of information about their citizens in publicly accessible databases. Searching for 
someone is not always as easy as typing their name into Google or Facebook; people 
with a small online presence will not appear easily when searching for them online. 
In the previous chapter, we demonstrated the importance of social media sites to find 
people online. In this chapter, we will continue our discussion of how to find people 
online using specialized websites known as people search engines in addition to looking 
up people in government records (also known as public records).
Covering these topics in one chapter is convenient because when you search for 
people online, a considerable amount of information is derived from public databases.
In this chapter, we will list the main people search engines currently available 
(focusing on the free services) and talk briefly about the distinct features offered by 
each one. We will also cover government record sites and categorize them according to 
the information offered. The information in this chapter combined with the previous 
chapter will help you find information about most targets online.
What Is a People Search Engine?
People search engines are similar to typical search engines; people search engines 
index online content but focus on people’s personal details and store the results in huge 
databases to return information upon request. Different parameters are used to search 
for people on these sites such as target e-mail address, phone number, social username, 
and full name. Some websites offer additional search parameters such as relative 

262
names, mailing address, date of birth, known aliases, ages, and even photographs 
using a reverse image search technique. The databases used by people search engines 
to locate information are diverse. For instance, many people search engines search 
within the deep web to extract information from source databases that typical search 
engines cannot reach; these include birth and death databases, public records (such 
as criminal and tax records), and other overlooked sources (such as information stored 
in proprietary databases). Please bear in mind that the people search engines will also 
index results from social media platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn, making them 
a convenient solution to return comprehensive result sets.
Online investigators (such as law enforcement and intelligence services) need 
people search engines to acquire accurate information about their targets; other 
parties are also interested in using such services. For example, employers can conduct 
background checks on their perspective employees, and individuals can look up the 
amount of personal information that is revealed about themselves online.
What Are Public Records?
We already talked about people search engines; these sites derive part of their results 
from public repositories. So, what do we mean when we say public records?
Public records consist of information that has been—mostly—produced by 
government entities and is meant to be nonconfidential.
Every person on Earth has a set of public records. For example, the most important—
mandatory—public records of every human is their birth and death records! Different 
countries handle public records differently, as public records will contain personally 
identifiable information (PII) about people, and exposing such details to the public is 
subject to law.
In the United States, access to national public records is governed by the Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA),i which clearly states that any person has the right to obtain 
access to government information in executive branch agency records. Until now, the 
United States was the only country in the world that gives unrestricted access to public 
records of its citizens. This means searching for United States citizens and residents 
returns richer results compared with other countries.
Government records come in different types such as text, photographs, and maps, 
and they are stored in paper and electronic formats as well such as CD/DVDs, tapes, and 
computer databases.
Chapter 6  People Search Engines and Public Records

263
Aside from laws regulating access to public records, what you need to know is that 
many online services offer access to such data for free or in exchange for a small fee.
Example of Public Records

Online Registries
An online registry is a kind of wish list published online. The most obvious example of 
such registries is when a couple formulates a list of things they need to purchase for their 
marriage. They compile a list and publish it online publicly. When one of their friends or 
relatives buys them an item from the list, the registry provider will remove this item from 
the list and ship the purchased item to the couple.
For the purpose of OSINT investigation, online registries are useful to uncover 
personal details/wishes of the people of interest in addition to close friends (as many 
registries allow friends to post their wishes to the wall of the registry owner), especially 
after knowing that many people leave their registries available online after the 
ceremony’s end.
Chapter 6  People Search Engines and Public Records

269
There are different types of online registries. The most well-known types are 
wedding, baby, graduation, birthday, holiday, and gift registries. The following list the 
most popular online registries:
•

Vital Records
Vital records are government records usually created by local authorities. They include 
birth and death records, marriage licenses, and divorce decrees. When searching for 
vital records, the returned result will usually come with the target’s personal details. For 
instance, a birth record will usually come with the parent’s full name, the child’s name, 
and the place where the event took place. The death record will come with the location 
where the person buried, a death certificate, and the name of the person who reported 
the event to the authorities. Marriage records will hold the couple’s parents’ names 
and the place where the marriage was registered. Finally, the divorce record will hold 
information about the couple’s children’s names. Other related records such as ancestry 
records (offered by some databases) and the mailing address of the person of interest 
can also appear when searching in vital records.
Chapter 6  People Search Engines and Public Records

270

Data Compromised Repository Websites
These sites hold a list of websites that have suffered from a data breach in the past. 
When a site suffers from a data breach, registered user details—especially usernames 
and passwords—usually get revealed to the public. Many people have a bad practice 
of using the same password for more than one account (e.g., using the same password 
for Facebook and for an e-mail account), so knowing one password may grant access to 
other social accounts/services belonging to the same user.

in data breaches. You can also download the Pwned Passwords list, 
which contains additional data about each breached account (such 
as the number of times that password had been seen in the source 
data breaches). This site can be searched using a target e-mail 
address or the password itself to see whether it appears in plain 
text on any public password dump list (see Figure 6-3). This is a 
recommended site.

private details. For example, you can find out the type of hardware and software 
implemented in the company of interest by looking at the technical vacancies posted 
by it (e.g., posting a technical vacancy for an IT administrator with experience in 
Windows Server technology means that the target company is using Windows OS in 
its infrastructure). A person’s expertise, education, and job history can be found easily

because each service aggregates its information from different databases. The indexing 
mechanisms also differ between sites. It is also advisable to begin your search on social 
media; if you find useful information about the target, you can conduct a more thorough 
search using the sites covered in this chapter.
In the next chapter, we will continue our discussion of how to locate people online, 
but this time using the geographical information that comes with people’s Internet usage 
and social media activities.

CHAPTER 7
Online Maps
Tracking users’ geolocation information has become increasingly popular with the 
advance of computing devices, mobile communications, and social media platforms 
because these technologies make posting someone’s current location online a matter of 
clicking one button.
Nowadays, many types of electronic devices come equipped with satellite tracking 
sensors to determine their location on the map. Almost all handheld devices—such 
as smartphones and wearable devices—are now location aware. Many apps in major 
software stores such as Apple and Google Play have the ability to use the geolocation 
sensor of the smartphone/tablet to offer a customized experience or to offer certain 
functions to the device’s user. In fact, most applications, online services, and social 
media platforms can track a user’s location in one way or another.
In this chapter, we will demonstrate how you can exploit the geolocation information 
that comes with many users’ online activities to determine their current and previous 
locations. We will also cover many useful online services that can help you to track 
everything online including vehicles, ships, shipments, airplanes, and people. You’ll also 
learn how to research different online map repositories to gather intelligence.
But before we begin, we will describe in simple terms how navigation systems—
which are responsible for determining people’s current locations—work.
The Basics of Geolocation Tracking
Most people do not care about the underlying technology responsible for delivering 
location-based services to them. People enter the address of the location they need to 
look up on the map, or they use the built-in feature available in smartphones to geotag 
digital files (such as images and videos) so they record the current location of images/
videos as a meta tag automatically. In other instances, many social media platforms, 

286
especially Facebook and Twitter, allow their users to post their current location online 
(called a check-in on Facebook) with just a single click, and the rest is handled by the 
electronic device.
To determine someone’s current geographical spot, location-aware devices need 
to communicate with a satellite navigation system that is in turn is responsible for 
delivering the exact coordinates of the location on Earth.
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is an American satellite navigation system 
developed and operated by the U.S. government; it is considered the most popular 
navigation system on Earth and is used by a large number of electronic devices 
worldwide. Of course, there are other navigation systems such as the Russian system 
named GLONASS, the BeiDou system owned by China, or the Galileo run by the 
European Union. These systems are supported by different device manufacturers.
For GPS to know your current location, it needs to determine the exact coordinate 
where you are currently standing. So, what do we mean by the geographic coordinate?
A geographic coordinate system is a system that locates points on Earth using two 
coordinate values: latitude and longitude. By knowing the two values, you can visualize 
any point on Earth on a map.
How to Find the GPS Coordinates of Any Location 
on a Map
To find the GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) of any geographical spot on Earth 
using Google Maps, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Go to Google Maps at https://maps.google.com.
	 2.	 Click anywhere on the map where you want to see the GPS 
coordinates. A small box appears in the bottom of the Google 
Maps page showing the current location GPS coordinates  
(see Figure 7-1).
	 3.	 To further investigate a selected location, click the coordinate 
numbers, and Google will take you to a closer view of the target 
location in addition to giving you its mailing address  
(if applicable).
Chapter 7  Online Maps

287
Note!  The first GPS number represents the latitude, and the second represents 
the longitude.
Note!  You can also find the latitude and longitude of a point by going to  
http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html. Click the map and drag the marker 
to the desired location. You can also enter the address (street, city, state, and 
country) in the search box to look up the GPS coordinates on map.
To convert latitude and longitude to decimal, go to https://andrew.hedges.

How to Find the Geocode Coordinates from a Mailing  
Address

its geocode coordinates on the map, go to the following free services:
•	
Batch Geocoding (https://www.doogal.co.uk/BatchGeocoding.
php): This service converts multiple address at the same time into 
their equivalent geocode coordinates (latitude and longitude) using

Location-Based Social Media
Major social media platforms allow their users to geotag some of their activities when 
using them. In this section, we will discuss how you can use the geolocation feature 
offered by major social media platforms to collect intelligence about a specific target or 
subject.
YouTube
To search for videos tagged with geocoordinates on YouTube, you can use a dedicated 
tool called Geo Search Tool (https://youtube.github.io/geo-search-tool/search.
html). You can search for videos at a given address and in a given timeframe. You can 
also specify a distance from the location entered; hence, the search can be as broad as 
1,000 KM or as narrow at 1 KM. The returned results can be filtered according to each 
video upload time. Final results appear graphically on a map as a red marker (see 
Figure 7-4).

298
Twitter
Twitter allows users to post tweets combined with current location data (see Figure 7-­5).  
Such tweets can help investigators to determine the current/previous locations of a 
target at a specific point in time. In this section, we will cover how to locate tweets based 
on their geolocation information.
Search for Tweets in a Specific Geographical Location
The Twitter search functionality allows you to search for tweets posted within a specific 
location using GPS coordinates. To locate all tweets posted from a specific location on 
Earth, follow these steps:
	 1.	 Open Google Maps, navigate to the target location, and click the 
exact point on the map to see its GPS coordinates (see Figure 7-6).
Figure 7-5.  Posting a tweet with location information
Chapter 7  Online Maps

299
	 2.	 Go to the Twitter search box and type near: followed by the 
target’s latitude and longitude enclosed in quotation marks  
(see Figure 7-7).
	 3.	 You can add more advanced Twitter search operators to the 
previous search to further filter its results (see Figure 7-8).
Figure 7-6.  Extracting the GPS coordinates of the target on Google Maps
Figure 7-7.  Searching for all tweets that match the entered GPS coordinates
Chapter 7  Online Maps

300
As shown in Figure 7-8, note that three filters are applied on the previous location 
search.
•	
Within:3mil: This limits the results to three miles from the target GPS 
coordinates.
•	
Filter:images: This returns tweets that contain images within it.
•	
Since:2018-03-18: The tweet’s date must be from the date specified 
and later.
To see the exact time when any tweet was posted, hover your mouse over its 
timestamp (see Figure 7-9). Please note that the date/time that appears is according to 
the time zone of your Twitter account settings, not the uploader’s date/time.
Tweet Mapper
Tweet Mapper (https://keitharm.me/projects/tweet) is a free service that lists all 
geotagged tweets (all tweets posted while the location feature is ON). All you need to do 
is to enter the target’s Twitter handle and then press Enter. A map will appear showing 
red markers (see Figure 7-10) over all the geographical locations where this target posts 
their geotagged tweets. Click any marker to see related tweets below the map.

Other Social Media Platforms
There are hundreds of social media services, and many of them allow users to geotag 
published contents, but in this chapter we focused on the most popular two: Facebook 
and Twitter.
To enrich your thinking about the wide possibilities of OSINT gathering offered by 
geo-enabled social media services, we will briefly cover an additional service that uses 
users’ geolocation data to offer functions. This service is called Strava, and it is used 
mainly as a social networking app for athletes to measure and share their activities.
Strava Heat Map
A Strava heat map (https://www.strava.com/heatmap) is a performance measurement 
sporting app for athletes; it works by monitoring athletic activities through the GPS 
sensor existing within their smartphone (supports Apple and Android) or any other 
supported device like GPS watches and head units and uploading such data to its 
servers to make it available for sharing. This is a free app, but it reserves some premium 
features for paying users (e.g., showing advanced statistics about user activities). The 
most popular usage of this app is tracking users’ activities while cycling and running.
A Strava heat map shows “heat” made by aggregated, public activities over the last 
two years; this map is updated monthly. At the beginning of 2018, Strava revealed several 
military base locations in Syria and Afghanistan because the military personals inside 
these—secret—bases were using this app to measure and track their fitness exercises. 
Base locations appeared clearly as the soldiers were moving around inside the base, 
drawing a clear border of each base.
What happened with Strava shows clearly that despite all security measures, the 
lack of user security training can lead to revealing military secrets that are available for 
intelligence gathering.
Chapter 7  Online Maps

303
Note!  Investigating a Strava heat map can reveal important information about 
users’ sporting activities and the run routes they use.
You can view photos uploaded to Flickr on a map by going to https://www.

news, and more from around the world at https://map.snapchat.com.
Conducting Location Searches on Social Media Using 
Automated Tools
There are many tools that can prove useful when searching for data (both geotagged 
and nongeotagged) online. In this section, we will briefly mention some popular OSINT 
gathering tools for gathering different kinds of public information, including geolocation 
content, from both Internet and social media platforms.

the BBC service.
Transport Tracking
With the advancement of communication technology, most vehicles and public/
private transportation are location aware, meaning they come with a GPS or other 
satellite tracking system sensor to identify its current location. Tracking systems offer a 
comprehensive picture of the subject vehicle location in addition to other information 
about it such as vehicle name (if applicable), type, cargo, destination, owner, and many 
other technical details. Many free services online facilitate access to tracking information 
about land vehicles, ships, and airplanes; such information can prove extremely useful 
during any type of online investigation, especially when knowing that many sites also list 
previous tracking records of vehicles, ships, and vessels in its public databases.

As we mentioned in Chapter 4, Google can also be used to locate publicly accessible 
webcams online. The best place to make such a search is the Google Hacking Database 
(GHDB) at https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database13/.
Digital File Metadata
We already covered in Chapter 2 how to investigate the metadata of digital files (such as 
images, videos, Microsoft Office files, and PDF). Some digital files—especially geotagged 
images and videos—can contain GPS coordinates. Investigating such files is easy; all you 
need to do is copy the GPS coordinates and use the services in this chapter to locate the 
address on a map of the subject photo or video.
Summary
Most user online activities can be associated with geolocation information. Locating 
information online through location-based searches can narrow down the results 
returned and make your investigation more focused.
In the next chapter, we will talk about something different from everything 
already mentioned. You will learn how to use different tools and techniques to gather 
intelligence—mostly technical information—about target IT infrastructure and websites.

CHAPTER 8
Technical Footprinting
Footprinting is the first task that hackers—both black and white hats—do before 
initiating their attacks against computerized systems. It is the act of using different tools 
and techniques to acquire as much information as they can before attacking the target. 
In the previous chapters, we covered how to use a wide array of tools and techniques to 
collect data online about different entities (such as people and organizations). However, 
we did not cover how to investigate a target’s own web pages and network to acquire 
technical information.
In Chapter 1, we defined OSINT as referring to all information that is publicly 
available. This means OSINT sources are distinguished from other forms of intelligence 
in being legally accessible by the public without breaching any privacy or copyright laws. 
This legal definition also applies to technical footprinting when identifying a target’s IT 
technologies, services, and networks.
In Chapter 1, we differentiated between three types of information gathering: 
passive, semipassive, and active. In this chapter, we are concentrating on the passive 
reconnaissance techniques only, as the other two methods may have a legal implication 
if applied without proper permission. Thus, you cannot consider them as belonging to 
the OSINT-gathering scope.
In passive reconnaissance, the target will know nothing about your information-­
gathering activities. You will not send any packets of data to target servers. Instead, you 
will browse the target website like any regular Internet visitor to look for interesting 
information. The amount of information gathered in this way is limited to what is 
presented on the target website. In semipassive reconnaissance, you are sending limited 
traffic to the target server. However, this traffic will not launch any alarm by the security 
systems implemented by the target organization’s network (firewall and IDS) because 
this traffic will resemble any regular Internet traffic behavior.

314
Both passive reconnaissance and semipassive reconnaissance are allowed by law 
in major countries (without obtaining a permit), although some countries may also 
consider some sorts of semipassive activities as a kind of illegal footprinting.
Note!  Active reconnaissance involves interacting directly with the target system; 
you can achieve this in various ways. For example, you can use social engineering 
techniques to acquire information from a target’s help desk.
By doing passive reconnaissance, you can gather some useful technical information 
such as identifying the target organization’s IP addresses, extracting domain name 
information, identifying its subdomain names, and identifying the IT devices and 
technologies in use. In addition, you can collect traditional types of information (for 
example, employee names and e-mails and document metadata) from the target website 
that can be used to profile target employees.
Investigate the Target Website
The first place you need to go when beginning your technical footprinting is the targeted 
company’s web pages. Investigating a company’s website will give you excessive 
amounts of useful information from a security perspective. The following are just some 
examples:
•	
Company address
•	
Branch office locations
•	
Key employees
•	
Open vacancies and job offers (job offers may reveal technologies 
used in the company)
•	
E-mail schema (by looking at staff e-mail addresses)
•	
Phone numbers
•	
Partner companies—or any company with a close business 
relationship
•	
Open hours and holidays
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

315
•	
News about target organization (merger or acquisition news)
•	
Technology used in building the target website
•	
E-mail system used (many organizations use open source technology 
like Horde and Roundcube)
•	
IT technologies (hardware and software) used by target organization
•	
VPN provider (if any)
•	
Digital files (such as PDF files and spreadsheets) and metadata (some 
organizations even post their inventory list, including IT equipment, 
on their websites)
•	
Privacy or security policy that lists IT security controls (for example, 
such documents may contain a password creation policy)
•	
Information about the organization’s employees
Web pages are composed of HTML code, so it is advisable to begin there. You can 
view the HTML source to see whether the developers left any useful information in the 
HTML comments. You need also to check the head section of the HTML source code 
for attached documents such as CSS and JavaScript files. These files may also contain 
comments by their developers.
Note!  To view the HTML source code of any web page using Firefox, right-click 
the target page and select View Page Source. You can find useful information 
within HTML comment tags that look like this: <!-- this is a comment -->.
Many companies outsource their website design to foreign companies. Discovering 
this issue from the HTML source code will make the outsourced company part of your 
investigation endeavor.
Note!  Firefox has a built-in utility for aiding web developers. The Firefox 
Developer Tools are a set of web development tools that can be used to analyze the 
HTML source code of web pages. To launch the tool, press Ctrl+Shift+I or simply 
go to the Tools menu, select Web Developer, and then select Developer Toolbar.
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

316
Investigate the Robots.txt File
Web robots—also known as crawlers or spiders—are used by search engines to scan the 
Web automatically to discover new content. They are used by all search engines such 
as Google and Yahoo to index web contents. Web site owners use the robots.txt file in 
their website root directory to give instructions to web robots on what pages they want 
to include or exclude during the crawling process. When a robot reads Disallow: in the 
robots.txt file, it will ignore the file path after it. For intelligence purposes, checking 
this file will reveal what the website owner wants to hide from the public. To view the 
robots.txt file of any website, type in your browser address bar the target domain name 
followed by a forward slash and then robots.txt. See Figure 8-1 for a sample robots.
txt file for the Apress.com domain name.
Note!  RobotsDisallowed is a project on GitHub (https://github.com/
danielmiessler/RobotsDisallowed) that harvests the “Disallow” directories 
from the robots.txt files of the world’s top websites (taken from an Alexa 100K 
global ranking).

by web robots
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

317
Mirror the Target Website
Sometimes it is more convenient—when reviewing the HTML code—to download the 
entire target website for offline viewing/parsing, and there are automated tools for 
performing this task. The following are the most popular:
•	
HTTrack (https://www.httrack.com): Here you can copy a website 
for offline view.
•	
GNU Wget (www.gnu.org/software/wget): Here you can retrieve files 
using the HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS Internet protocols.
•	
BlackWidow (www.softbytelabs.com/en/BlackWidow): Here you can 
download a complete site or part of it. You can also download any 
kind of files including YouTube videos embedded within a site.
Extract the Links
A target website can be linked with other applications, web technologies, and related 
websites. Dumping its links will reveal such connections and give the URLs of other 
resources (such as CSS and JavaScript files) and domains connected with it. There are 
many online services to extract the URLs, images, scripts, iframes, and embeds of target 
websites. The following are the most popular (use more than one service as they do not 
return the same results):
•	
Link Extractor (www.webtoolhub.com/tn561364-link-extractor.
aspx): You can export the results to an Excel file.
•	
Free URL Extractor (www.bulkdachecker.com/url-extractor): 
Extract Links from URL/Domain (e.g. Links, images, scripts and 
Embeds).
•	
Link Gopher (https://sites.google.com/site/linkgopher): This is 
a Firefox add-on that extracts all the links from web pages, including 
embedded ones, and displays them in a new web page.
Note!  To see where a target website URL redirects to, use the following service: 
http://redirectdetective.com.
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

318
Check the Target Website’s Backlinks
You should also consider checking all backlinks to a target organization’s domain, as 
some linked websites may reveal useful information about the target. To see all linked 
websites to a specific domain name, type the following into Google: site:* darknessgate.
com (there should be a space between the asterisk and the domain name).
This will return all sites that link to www.DarknessGate.com. To refine the search and 
return only the results from other domain names, exclude all links to the target domain 
from itself (see Figure 8-2).
Monitor Website Updates
You should monitor web updates of the target website regularly. Of course, it is not 
convenient to monitor a website with hundreds of pages, so there are tools to automate 
this task. A popular tool for this is WebSite-Watcher (http://aignes.com/index.htm), 
which is a commercial program. This software will monitor web pages, forums, and RSS 
feeds for new postings and replies (even the password-protected pages) and report the 
changes.
Check the Website’s Archived Contents
OSINT investigators should remember that the Web is always changing. Organizations 
update their websites regularly, and past versions of the target website may leak 
important information. Therefore, make sure to take a look at the previous versions of 
the target website using the Wayback Machine (www.archive.org).
Note!  To discover who is hosting any website, go to https://www.
whoishostingthis.com.
Figure 8-2.  Finding backlinks to a specific domain name using Google advanced 
operators
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

319
Identify the Technologies Used
There are different ways to discover the type of technology used in a target organization. 
For instance, job postings offered on the target organization’s site—and on other 
specialized job websites—are a valuable source of information (you can find the type 
of skills needed, required IT certifications, past experience with specific products/
vendors), and from that you can easily identify the type of IT infrastructure, the OS, and 
other software used.
Tip!  If a target organization has more than one branch office, the type of skills 
needed—as listed in job posts—for a specific branch could be an indicator of the 
activities taking place in that branch.
To identify the technologies used to build a target website, there are many online 
services and tools available for this task. The most popular service is Built With 
(https://builtwith.com). To use this service, enter the target domain name to view its 
technology profile and relationship profile. The technology profile will show detailed 
information about target websites such as analytics and tracking codes, widgets, website 
languages, whether it is optimized for mobile views, content delivery network (CDN), 
JavaScript libraries, advertising networks, e-mail services, name server provider, SSL 
certificate, web server type, encoding, and document information. A relationship profile 
view offers important information about the target domain; it shows the historical usage 
of identifiers (such as Google AdSense identifiers) that are shared with other websites. 
By knowing this information, you can uncover which websites are also controlled by the 
same company/individual (see Figure 8-3).
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

320
Another tool to identify the web technologies used on target websites is Wappalyzer 
(https://www.wappalyzer.com). You can install it as an add-on to your Firefox or 
Chrome browser to investigate the technologies used on any website you visit.
Identifying the key technologies used—both software and hardware—will help you 
do some focused research to identify any vulnerabilities in the target organization’s 
software, identify product-specific defects, and identify application-specific 
configuration problems. In the coming section, we will demonstrate how to identify a 
target OS server using an online tool.
Note!  To find domains sharing the same Google Analytics ID, go to  
https://dnslytics.com/reverse-analytics.

321
Note!  A lot of IT equipment (such as routers, managed switches, firewall 
solutions, servers, access controls, Internet surveillance camera, and even 
software packages) comes preconfigured with a default username and password. 
If the IT person who installs such devices forgets to update/remove the default 
credentials, such devices are vulnerable. The following sites list hundreds of IT 
equipment’s default credentials:
•

Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

322
Web Scraping Tools
There are automated tools that can help you to collect various types of information 
from the target website easily. Such tools are known as web scraping tools or web data 
extraction tools. Imagine you want to collect e-mails from a big website (with thousands 
of pages). Doing this manually would be a daunting task, but when using automated 
tools, you can do it with a single click.
theHarvester
theHarvester (https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) is a tool for gathering 
subdomain names, e-mail addresses, virtual hosts, open ports/banners, and employee 
names from different public sources such as Google, Bing, LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo, pgp, 
and more. The search conducted using this tool is passive, meaning that the target will 
not notice any reconnaissance activities from your side.
theharvester comes preinstalled on Kali Linux. However, you can install it on any 
Linux-based OS by entering the following command in terminal:
apt-get theharvester
To collect the target organization’s e-mails, open the program and type the following:
theharvester -d springer.com -b all -l 500 -f results.txt
theharvester is used to execute the tool, and these are some options:
•	
-d specifies the domain to search or the company name.
•	
-b specifies a data source such as google, googleCSE, bing, bingapi, 
pgp, linkedin, google-profiles, jigsaw, twitter, googleplus, and all.
•	
-l limits the number of results to work with.
•	
f- saves the results into an HTML or XML file.
In the previous script, we are asking the tool to pull results from all data sources 
and to limit the result to 500 results. Also, the generated results should be saved in a file 
named results.txt in the same working directory (see Figure 8-4).
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

323

com using theHarvester. The tool also resolves the target domain name into its IP 
address and discovers many virtual hosts related to the target domain name.
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

324
The previous example is the simplest usage of this tool; we were able to collect target 
e-mail addresses in addition to discovering many subdomain names of the target main 
domain. This search also discovers virtual hosts (meaning multiple websites hosted on 
the same server). After getting some target e-mail addresses, you can use the techniques 
in previous chapters to build a profile for each one.
Web Data Extractor
Web Data Extractor (www.webextractor.com) is a commercial program that collects 
various types of data including URLs, phone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses, and 
meta tag information and body text.
Email Extractor
Email Extractor (https://www.email-extractor.io) is a Chrome add-on that extracts 
all e-mails from currently visited web pages.
Investigating the company domain name is the second task after the initial web page 
exploration. Different types of searches can be conducted on domain names. Let’s start 
by finding the WHOIS information of the target domain.
Investigate the Target Website’s File Metadata
When browsing a target company’s website, you may encounter different types of files 
posted on it, such as files advertising products in JPEG or PDF format, spreadsheets 
containing product catalogs, and others. These files must be downloaded and 
investigated offline to extract their metadata. We already covered metadata in Chapter 2. 
In this section, we will list additional tools to analyze metadata in digital files:
•	
Metagoofil (https://code.google.com/archive/p/metagoofil): 
You can extract the metadata of public documents from a target 
company’s website.
•	
OOMetaExtractor (https://archive.codeplex.
com/?p=oometaextractor): You can extract an OpenOffice 
document’s metadata.
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

325
•	
Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives (https://www.
elevenpaths.com/labstools/foca/index.html): This is a metadata 
analysis tool; it harvests public files from the Internet using three 
search engines: Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. Then you can search 
them for metadata and hidden information.
Website Certification Search
To show cryptographic certifications associated with any domain name, use these search 
services:
•	
Censys (https://censys.io)
•	
Certificate Search (https://crt.sh)
Website Statistics and Analytics Tools
Website statistics tools provide useful marketing, technical, and historical information 
about any domain name. You need to supply the target domain name only, and a 
detailed report is generated. The following are the most popular tools in this area:
•	
Alexa (https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo): Offers rich websites 
statistics and analytical info.
•	
Moon Search (http://moonsearch.com): Offers websites analytical 
services and Backlinks checker service.

•	
Security Headers (https://securityheaders.io): Here you can 
analyze HTTP response headers of target websites.
Website Reputation Checker Tools
There are many organizations that offer free online services to check whether a specific 
website is malicious. Some of these sites also offer historical information about a target 
website. The following are the various web reputation analysis services:
•	
Threat Miner (https://www.threatminer.org/index.php): This site 
offers domain threat intelligence analysis.
•

check a suspicious website or IP address here.
•	
Scumware (https://www.scumware.org): This is a list of malicious 
websites.
Note!  To see a list of websites that have been hacked before, go to http://
zone-h.org/archive and search for the target domain name. If there is a 
previous hack, it will show you the hacked page (which replaces the original main 
home page), the hacker team responsible of this hack if available, and the date/
time when the hack took place.
Passive Technical Reconnaissance Activities
Conducting passive reconnaissance activities for technical information means you are 
trying to identify subdomains, IP addresses, doing DNS footprinting, and getting WHOIS 
information of the target domain. 
WHOIS Lookup
With a WHOIS lookup, you can find out who registered the target domain name in 
addition to other useful information such as the domain name owner and personal 
information, billing contact, and technical contact address (see Figure 8-5). This 
information is public and required to be so by the ICANN organization responsible 
for overseeing the domain name system. WHOIS information about each domain is 
stored within public central databases called WHOIS databases. These databases can be 
queried to fetch detailed information about any registered domain name. Please note 
that some domain registrants may opt to make their domain registration information 
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

328
private. (This service is called something different by each domain register and require 
paying additional fee, but the most common terms are domain privacy or WHOIS 
protection.) In these cases, the personal information of the domain registrant will be 
hidden in the WHOIS databases.
Numerous sites offer WHOIS information. However, the main one responsible for 
delivering this service is ICANN. ICANN and its local regional Internet registries manage 
the allocation and registration of IP addresses and domain names for the entire world.
•	
ICANN (https://whois.icann.org/en): This is the head 
organization responsible for coordinating the Internet DNS and IP 
addresses.
•	
AFRINIC (https://www.afrinic.net): This is responsible for the 
Africa region.
•	
APNIC (https://www.apnic.net): This is responsible for the Asia-­
Pacific region.
•	
LACNIC (www.lacnic.net): This is responsible for the Latin 
American and the Caribbean.
Figure 8-5.  Partial WHOIS report about the DarknessGate.com domain name 
retrieved from https://whois.icann.org
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

329
Many other online services give more information about registered domain names, 
listed here:
•	
Domain History (www.domainhistory.net): This shows archived 
domain name information.
•	
Whoisology (https://whoisology.com/#advanced): This is a domain 
name ownership archive.
•	
Robtext (https://www.robtex.com): This contains various 
information about domain names.
•	
Who (https://who.is): This offers a WHOIS search for domain 
name, website, and IP tools.
•	
Operative Framework (https://github.com/graniet/operative-­
framework): Here you can find all domains registered by the same 
e-mail address.
•	
URL Scan (https://urlscan.io): This shows different information 
about the target website such as IP detail, subdomains, domain trees, 
links, certificates, and technologies used to build it.
Now, after finding out who is responsible for the target domain name, you can begin 
discovering how the target company organizes its Internet resources through web hosts 
and subdomains.
Subdomain Discovery
A subdomain is a web address created under the current domain name address. It is 
usually used by website administrators to organize their content online. For example, 
www.darknessgate.com can use the subdomain http://shop.darknessagte.com for 
shopping and the subdomain http://blog.darknessgate.com for housing a blog.
Many website administrators may create subdomains to test new technology 
before applying it to the main site. Such sites are insecure because they are used in 
the development stage and could be left open to attack. Discovering such insecure 
subdomains can provide important information about the target company (for example, 
it may reveal the website code or leak documents forgotten on the server).
There are many tools/techniques for subdomain discovery. The following are the 
most popular ones.
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

330
Using Google Search Operator
Use site:target.com -inurl:www and Google will show all the related subdomain names of 
the target. For example, typing site:yahoo.com -inurl:www will show all the subdomains 
of the target domain name yahoo.com using the Google search page (see Figure 8-6).
Figure 8-6.  Using Google advanced search operators for subdomain name 
discovery
Using VirusTotal.com
The VirusTotal service checks suspicious files and URLs for malicious code. This service can 
be used for subdomain discovery. Go to https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/search 
(make sure to select the Search tab if it is not already selected). Enter the target domain name 
and press Enter. Scroll to the end of the page to find the “Observed Subdomains” section  
(see Figure 8-7).
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

331
DNSdumpster
With DNSdumpster (https://dnsdumpster.com), you can find domain name 
information about subdomains, DNS servers, and MX records.
Here are other tools and services for subdomain discovery:
•	
Dnsmap (https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/
dnsmapComes): This is preinstalled on Linux Kali. It performs 
subdomain name discovery and shows the associated IP addresses 
for each subdomain name found.
•	
Certificate Search (https://crt.sh): This service also discovers 
subdomain names of the target domain.
Figure 8-7.  VirusTotal showing the “Observed Subdomains” section for 
Apress.com
Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

332
•	
Gobuster (https://github.com/OJ/gobuster): This site discovers 
subdomains and files/directories on target websites. This tool is used 
as an active reconnaissance technique to collect information.
•	
Bluto (https://github.com/darryllane/Bluto): Here you can 
gather subdomain names passively via Netcraft.
•	
PenTest Tools (https://pentest-tools.com/information-­
gathering/find-subdomains-of-domain): Here you can discover 
subdomain names, find virtual hosts, and do website reconnaissance 
and metadata extraction from a target website.
•	
Sublist3r (https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r): Here you 
can discover subdomain names using both passive and active 
reconnaissance techniques.
Tip!  Use more than one service for subdomain discovery because some services 
may return partial results based on their discovery method.
DNS Reconnaissance
After gathering information about the WHOIS records and target subdomain names, you 
can acquire more passive information about the target domain. In this section, we will 
list passive reconnaissance techniques to gather information regarding the DNS servers 
and the DNS records. The next stage is port scanning and other active reconnaissance 
techniques, which are considered outside our book’s scope of OSINT-gathering activities.
Route Mapping
To determine the path to the target network, you need to use the tracert command. 
Please note that when information goes through networks, it does not follow the same 
path every time; it passes through different routers, firewalls, and other computing 
devices before reaching its destination. For high-value websites, the tracert command 
will be disabled, but it does not hurt to test it for your target website. There are many 
tools to perform tracerouting. On the Windows OS, open a command line prompt and 
type tracert followed by the target domain name (see Figure 8-8).

Common DNS Record Types
Before collecting information from the target DNS, you need to know the main DNS 
record types. The domain name system has many records associated with it. Each one 
gives a different set of information about the related domain name. These are the most 
common DNS records:
•	
A is usually used to map hostnames to an IP address of the host. It is 
used for IPv4 records.
•	
AAAA is the same as record type A but used for IPv6 records.
•	
CNAME is the canonical name record. This record is often called an 
alias record because it maps an alias to the canonical name.
•	
MX is the mail exchange record. It maps domain names to its mail 
server responsible for delivering messages for that domain.
•	
NS is the name server record. It handles queries regarding different 
services related to the main domain name.
•	
TXT is the text record. It associates arbitrary text with a domain 
name.

334
nslookup Command
This command helps you discover various DNS information about the target domain 
name in addition to its resolved IP address. The command is available on both Windows 
and Linux. Let’s begin by finding the A record of the target domain name (see Figure 8-­9).
To see the MX records (mail server records) associated with the target domain name, 
type the command shown in Figure 8-10.
In the same way, you can extract the IP address from any mail exchange server of the 
target domain name by typing set type=a and then entering the mail server address to 
resolve it into an IP address (see Figure 8-11).

Chapter 8  Technical Footprinting

335
By knowing the mail exchange server IP address, you can further implement IP 
searching techniques on this IP address to locate more information about it, as you will 
see next.
You can use nslookup in the same way as using web tools; let’s practice it using the 
MXtoolbox website.
Go to https://mxtoolbox.com and enter the target domain name in the search box. 
The site gives DNS information about a target domain name such as DNS lookup, MX 
lookup, WHOIS lookup, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) lookup, and DNS propagation. 
All this information is shown in a graphical user interface. An important feature of this 
site is that it gives you the authoritative name server of the target domain name (see 
Figure 8-12). Authoritative means the DNS server is the one that holds the actual DNS 
records (A, CNAME, MX, and so on) for the target domain name. Please note that during 
our previous nslookup tests, we were receiving a “nonauthoritative answer” when 
querying the target domain name. This because we are receiving a response from a 
cached version or from a local DNS server (your ISP’s DNS server).

any website. To use it, go to https://searchdns.netcraft.com, enter the target domain 
name in the text box, and click the lookup button (see Figure 8-13). Netcraft will generate 
a detailed security report about the target website that includes the following (and more):
•	
Network information (IPv6, domain register, name server, DNS 
admin contact, hosting company, and more)

Summary
Gathering technical information about a target website and network system is known 
as technical footprinting. During this book we focused on passive reconnaissance 
techniques, as the essence of OSINT gathering is concerned with acquiring publicly 
available information that does not need a permit in order to collect it. In this chapter, 
we covered tools and techniques that can be used to acquire OSINT intelligence about 
the target’s website and network infrastructure passively.
In the next chapter, we will talk about the future and how the widespread use of the 
Internet, mobile communications, and social media platforms will impact the future of 
OSINT-gathering techniques.

CHAPTER 9
What’s Next?
OSINT has become the preferred information-gathering method for intelligence 
agencies around the world. Traditionally, intelligence services relied on other channels 
to acquire information with varying degrees of reliability and usefulness; however, 
as computing technology continues to advance and the Internet and social networks 
are even more widely accessible around the globe, intelligence services have shifted a 
large percentage of their intelligence-gathering activities into the OSINT scope. Some 
intelligence experts estimate that more than 90 percent of intelligence information is 
coming now from OSINT sources.
OSINT is not limited to intelligence services, law enforcement, and military 
agencies. OSINT has become an integral component in the decision-making process 
for governments, business corporations, UN agencies, nongovernmental organizations, 
academia, the media, and civil societies such as citizen advocacy groups and labor 
unions. Nowadays, corporations use OSINT to investigate internal leakages, collect 
competitor intelligence, and predict trends in foreign markets. OSINT is also used by 
black hat hackers and criminal organizations to explore data that could be used to better 
attack or socially engineer a target.
Where Will OSINT Go Next?
The information age has resulted in an explosive amount of potential intelligence 
sources and will shape the future of OSINT gathering. In the intelligence arena, it is 
predicted that the practice of harvesting online data to counter terrorism and solve 
crime will increase. In addition, OSINT will continue to offer a cheap method to acquire 
intelligence about any community around the globe. For example, many studies show 
that recent protests in Arab countries were predicted by western security services after 
analyzing Arabic users’ behaviors on social platforms at that time.

342
In the civil area, businesses will be more willing to develop their own OSINT 
capabilities to gain competitive advantages and to secure their investments in an ever-­
changing world. Large organizations will work to have their own OSINT teams, while 
commercial OSINT providers will continue to offer their services to small and medium 
corporations that cannot afford to have an independent OSINT-gathering department.
Note!  Many corporations already use OSINT for risk prediction, which they call 
competitive intelligence or business intelligence.
From an information security perspective, OSINT gathering will continue to be a 
stepping stone for most penetration testing assessments to evaluate system weaknesses 
and work to fix them quickly. Organizations will work to integrate their OSINT 
intelligence into an organization’s overall cyber-defense strategy to protect their assets 
and to strength their security posture.
The main obstacle against OSINT gathering is the mass volume of data that needs to 
be processed. Indeed, the huge advancements in mobile computing and the increased 
speed of the Internet will make people more willing to post a considerable volume 
of data to the Internet. This tremendous stream of public data will make analyzing it 
extremely time-consuming. Governments and giant corporations are continually testing 
new technologies to overcome this. Investments in analytic technology have become 
a priority by many governments and giant IT corporations as it will lead to processing 
huge volumes of data in order to turn it into data that can be queried and modeled to 
build conclusions quickly.
Note!  Data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) devices is also considered 
a major challenge. In the near future, it is expected that we will have billions of 
working IoT devices. The resulting data/metadata from these devices is huge and 
requires sophisticated analytical tools to gain useful intelligence from them.
Another challenge to OSINT gathering is the predicted growth of “fake news” online. 
Currently major social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter face a real challenge 
to counter such activities. New algorithms—and usage policies—should be developed to 
verify news sources automatically before considering them valid OSINT sources.
Chapter 9  What’s Next?

343
Advancements in computing technology will certainly lead to creating efficient 
algorithms to handle the massive volume of data and to separate the irrelevant data from 
the target data. The advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies 
will again transform OSINT in the coming years.
OSINT Process
During this book, we did not explicitly talk about the process—or specific flow of steps—
that should be followed to gather OSINT. The OSINT-gathering activities can take place 
in no particular order according to each case or purpose. However, the flow of chapters 
in this book can also considered a good way to organize your OSITN searching activities.
In general, there are five main stages for any OSINT-gathering activity, as explained 
here:
	 1.	 Identify the sources: You identify the sources where you want 
to collect this data (e.g., the Internet, newspapers, magazines, 
commercial databases, and so on).
	 2.	 Harvest the data: You use different tools and techniques to gather 
data from the target sources; bear in mind that you should follow 
passive techniques to gather this data.
	 3.	 Process and verify the data: You process the gathered data and 
verify uncertain data from the data from more than one source if 
possible. You should also identify current and outdated data and 
exclude the irrelevant data from further analysis.
	 4.	 Analyze the data: You analyze the data and try to find connections 
between it to formulate a complete picture about the target.
	 5.	 Deliver the results: You present a report of your findings to the 
relevant party. This step is important and usually overlooked by 
many OSINT gatherers. It is necessary to present your key findings 
in an easy-to-understand format for any end user.
Chapter 9  What’s Next?

344
Final Words
To conclude, we think the future of OSINT is extremely bright! Both public and private 
organizations will work to integrate OSINT gathering into their overall decision-making 
processes. New industries will be eager to exploit the huge data resulting from the 
information revolution to support their business strategies and intelligence.
We hope this book was successful in shedding light on this important concept that 
have been widely used since the dawn of history under different names.
