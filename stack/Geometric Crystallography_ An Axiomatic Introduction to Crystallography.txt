Preface 
In 
the 
last 
decade 
mathematical 
crystallography has 
found increasing interest. Siginificant results have 
been 
obtained 
by 
algebraic, 
geometric, 
and 
group theoretic 
methods. Also classical 
crystallography 
in 
three-dimen-
sional 
Euclidean space has been extended to higher dimen-
sions 
in 
order 
to 
understand 
better 
the 
dimension 
independent 
crystallographic 
properties. The aim of this 
note is to introduce the reader 
to 
the 
fascinating 
and 
rich world of geometric crystallography. The prerequisites 
for 
reading 
it 
are 
elementary geometry and topological 
notations, and basic knowledge of group theory and 
linear 
algebra. 
Crystallography 
is 
geometric 
by 
its 
nature. In many 
cases, geometric arguments are the 
most 
appropriate 
and 
can 
thus 
best be understood. Thus the geometric point of 
view is emphasized here. 
The approach is axiomatic start-
ing from discrete point sets in Euclidean space. 
Symmetry 
comes in very soon and plays a central role. Each 
chapter 
starts with the necessary definitions and then the subject 
is treated in two- and three-dimensional space. Subsequent 
sections 
give 
an 
extension 
to higher dimensions. Short 
historical remarks added at the end of the 
chapters 
will 
show the development of the theory. The chapters are main-
ly 
self-contained. 
Frequent cross references, as well as 
an extended subject index, will help 
the 
reader 
who 
is 
only interested in a particular subject.

1. Basic Definitions 
The regular shape of crystals 
suggests 
that 
within 
a 
crystal 
atomic 
building 
units, congruent to each other, 
are regularly arranged. Assuming the crystal to 
be 
infi-
nite 
and 
the 
atoms 
to 
be points, an infinite discrete 
point set, called a discontinuum, results which 
plays 
an 
essential 
role 
in 
crystallography. Moreover, such point 
sets are of great importance in several branches of 
math-
ematics 
and physics. Whereas the existence of a continuum 
in nature cannot be shown, the discontinuum has an assured 
position in natural sciences. In this chapter some general 
properties of discrete point sets will be discussed. 
1.1. 
Axioms of geometrjc crYstallography 
We consider a point set 
X 
in 
n-dimensional 
Euclidean 
space 
En 
which fulfils, following Hilbert (Hilb2), three 
conditions: 
1.1. The point set X is discrete, 
that 
is, 
around 
each 
point of the set an open ball of fixed radius r>O can 
be drawn which contains no other point of X. 
1.2. Every 
interstitial 
ball, 
that 
is, every open ball 
which can be embedded into En such that it avoids all 
points of X, has a radius less than 
or 
equal 
to 
a 
fixed finite R. 
1.3. The 
point 
set 
X 
looks the same if seen from every 
point of X. 
The second condition ensures that the points are 
spread 
uniformly 
over 
the whole space. For example they may not 
lie all on one side of a hyperplane. 
This signifies 
that 
the 
number 
of 
points 
within 
any 
ball of radius L > R 
increases with the n-th power of L. 
A point set X which fulfils the fIrst two conditions 
is 
called 
i 
discontinuum 
or, following Delaunay (Delo4), a 
(r,R)-system. This more 
general 
kind 
of 
point 
set 
is 
important 
in 
the theory of amorphous mater and of quasi-
crystals. 
Following 
Sohncke 
(Sohn2), 
the third condition can be 
made more precise if we consider the set of straight 
line 
segments 
drawn 
from 
any 
point 
of the set X to all the

The third condition ensures that a largest 
interstitial 
ball 
of 
radius R exists. 
In a (r,R)-system the radius R 
is the supreme of radii of all interstitial 
balls 
and 
a 
ball of radius R not necessarily exists. 
A 
point 
set 
X 
which 
fulfils all three conditions is 
called a regular point system 
by 
Sohncke 
(SohnZ) 
or 
a 
homogeneous discontinuum by Niggli (Nigg1). 
Regular point systems have applications in the theory of 
ideal 
crystals. 
Any 
ideal 
crystal 
structure 
can 
be 
described as a union of 
one 
ore 
several 
regular 
point 
systems. 
Each 
regular 
point 
system 
corresponds to one 
atomic species.

Euclidean vector space 
We will assume that the reader is familiar with standard 
linear theory of En and elementary topological 
notations. 
We 
also 
assume 
familarity 
with 
convex 
sets. The main 
purpose of this section is to give a brief 
survey 
of 
an 
Euclidean 
vector 
space. 
The following definitions are 
standard. 
In order to describe the properties of a point set X 
in 
n-dimensional 
Euclidean 
space 
En, where n is finite, we 
have to introduce the concept of a real vector 
space. 
As 
origin 
we 
choose a point O~En; it need not belong to the 
point set 
X. 
Then 
we 
consider 
the 
translation 
which 
carries a 
to some other point x. This translation can be 
identified with the vector x from 
the 
origin a 
to 
the 
point 
x. 
Selecting 
n 
linearly 
independent 
vectors 
a1, ... ,a n as basis vectors, every 
vector 
x 
is 
uniquely 
represented 
by 
its components 
~1' ••• '~n referred to this 
basis, 
The components 
~1' ••• '~n can also 
be 
considered 
as 
the 
coordinates of the point x. 
The 
dimension 
n 
is 
defined 
as the maximal number of 
linearly independent basis vectors. 
We represent a vector by a column: 
X := 
Defining the sum of two vectors to be 
x + y = 
+ 
: = 
and multiplication by a real scalar A by

The vector space vn is called Euclidean if we define the 
scalar 
product of two vectors, referred to the coordinate 
system a1' .... ,an' to be 
and the length of a vector to be

The metric tensor C=CC;j) is a symmetric matrix with coef-
ficients 
where U;j is the angle between the basis

vectors .. a; 
and 
If 
the basis vectors a; 
have unit length and are mutu-
ally perpendicular, then C is the identity matrix 
and 
it 
follows that 
such a basis is called a cartesian coordinate system. 
In 
crystallography 
the periodicity of an ideal crystal 
is used to define a crystal coordinate 
system 
which, 
in 
general, is not a cartesian one. 
Frequently 
the 
reciprocal 
or 
dual basis r1, ... ,rn is 
used. 
For 
a 
vector 
x:=~1a1+"'+~nan

a

Rigid motions 
A motion in En can be represented by a non-singular

matrix

and a shift vector 5; it transforms the coordi-
nates of of a point

into

We 
assume that the point x is moved referred to a fixed 
coordinate system. 
Using the 
Frobenius 
symbol 
(Frob1) 
this equation can be abreviated as 
x' := (5,5) x. 
The 
matrix 
5 is called the rotation part and the shift 
vector 5 is called the 
translation 
part 
of 
the 
motion 
(5.5). Every motion that brings x into coincidence with x' 
has also to bring an arbitrary point y~En into coincidence 
with some point y'~En. 
For 
a 
rigid 
vector xY = y-it 
motion 
we require that the length of the 
is conserved:

A rigid motion is also called an isometry. 
Since detCC) equals det(StCS)=det(C)det 2 (S) 
the 
result 
det(S) 
=±1 
follows. 
The two values -1 and 1 for detCS) 
are connected to the chirality character of the 
isometry. 
In oder to understand the chirality character of an isome-
try 
(5,5) 
we 
take 
a subset MCEn of at least n+1 points 
which not all lie in a hyperplane. In the 
two-dimensional 
case 
we take three points which determine a triangle R in 
the plane as shown in Figure 1.2. In 
general 
n+1 
points 
determine a simplex in En. It is always possible to deter-
mine 
a 
simplex 
which 
exhibits 
chirality, that is, the 
mirror image of the simplex is not directly 
congruent 
to 
the 
original 
simplex. 
The 
simplex 
and 
its 
mirror 
congruent copy are said to be enantiomorph to each 
other. 
In Figure 1.2 the triangles R" and Rm are enantiomorh. 
If detCS)=+1 then the isometry (S,s) carries the simplex 
into a direct congruent copy. Such an isometry is called a 
proper 
isometry. 
Particularly 5 is called a proper rota-
tion. If "I" designates the identity operation then 
(1,5) 
is a translation. 
Otherwise 
if 
det(5)=-1 
then (S,s) carria~ the simplex 
into a mirror congruent copy, that 
is~ 
the simplex changes. Such an isometry is 
er isometry. Particularly 5 is called an

a 
rotoreflection or, if it leaves a 
hyperplane fixed, a reflection.

SYmmetry operations 
Let 
M be 
any 
subset of En. We look at the Isometrles 
which map M onto itself. 
Definition 1.1: 
A symmetry operation acting on a set M is 
an isometry which maps M onto itself. 
The symmetry operations of a set M have 
two 
properties:

Symmetry groups correspond to linear representations 
of 
abstract 
groups 
in 
Euclidean 
vector 
spaces. 
Thus we 
consider (S.s) as a representation in En. 
We 
note 
that 
different 
symmetry 
groups 
may 
correspond 
to different 
representations of the same abstract 
group 
(cf. 
section 
6.6), 
Definition 
1.2: 
Every 
group 
P of symmetry operations 
acting on a set M and which leaves 
at 
least 
one 
point z~En fixed is called a point group. 
Example 
1.2: 
Let 
~ be the equilateral triangle shown in 
Figure 1.3. There exist six symmetry 
operations 
which 
map 
~ onto 
itself. These are three rotations 51' 52' 
and 53 having rotation angles a1' a2' 
and 
a3 
respec-
tively 
and 
three 
reflections in the mirror lines mi' 
m2' and m3' The center of gravity 
of 
the 
triangle 
~ 
remains fixed under all these symmetry operations. 
We 
now 
look 
at 
the 
symmetry operations of a regular 
point system X. By 
the 
regularity 
condition 
1.3 
there 
exists 
for 
every 
pair 
x.y€X a symmetry operation (S,s) 
which carries x into y and thereby maps X onto itself. 
It 
follows 
that all x~X are connected through symmetry oper-
ations acting on X. 
If this is fulfilled we say that 
the 
group of symmetry operations acts transitively on X. 
Definition 
1.3: 
Every 
group 
G of symmetry operations 
acting transitively on a regular point 
system 
in 
En is a n-dimensional space group. 
Synonymous 
with space group also crystallographic group 
is used. 
Definition 1.4: 
The set of all symmetry operations 
of 
a 
group 
r 
which 
map a set M onto itself is called 
the stabilizer of M in r. 
Synonymous with stabilizer also site symmetry 
group 
or 
isotropy group are used.

Classifjcations 
We will make frequent use of 
classifying 
objects 
into 
similarity classes. 
Such classifications are based on the 
following definition: 
Definition

a -

is called an equivalence relation. 
Each equivalence relation on a 
set 
M divides 
Minto 
disjoint 
subsets, 
called equivalence classes. Synonymous 
with equivalence class also type will be used in order 
to 
be 
in 
accordance 
with 
the nomenclature of the Interna-
tional Tables, Vol. A (Hahn1). 
1.6. 
Hjstorical remarks 
The study of discrete point sets is intimately connected 
with the investigation of the 
geometrical 
properties 
of 
crystals, 
which 
began 
in the 16 th century with Georgius 
Agricola (1494-1555), Conrad Gessner 
(1516-1565), 
Johann 
Kepler 
(1571-1630), 
and 
Christian 
HUygens (1629-1695). 
Remarkably, the ancient Greeks and Romans did not investi-
gate crystal forms. Detailed descriptions 
of 
the 
begin-
nings 
of 
crystallography 
are 
contained in the books of 
Lenz (Lenz1), Marx (Marx1) and Burke (Burk1). 
The first important crystal law was discovered by 
Niels 
Stenson 
(1636-1686) 
in 
1669 
when 
he stated the law of 
constancy of interfacial angles which he had observed 
for 
quartz crystals. 
"ad evincendum, in plano axis laterum et 
numerum et longitudinem varie mutari, non mutatis angulis" 
(Sten1). In its full generality this law was asserted only 
after 
Jean 
Baptiste Louis Rome de l'Isle (1736-1790) had 
measured many different crystal species (Rome1). 
Further 
progress 
was 
achieved 
by 
Rene 
Just 
HaUy 
(1743-1822) who explained the crystal forms by stacking of 

BASIC DEFINITIONS 
11 
equal 
parallelepipedal 
building bricks called "mol'cules 
soustractives" which themselves were constructed by "mol'-
cules integrantes". 
A modern atomistic theory was introduced in 1824 by 
the 
physicist 
Ludwig August Seeber (1793-1855) who postulated 
small spherical atoms which remain in a stable equilibrium 
by the balance of attractive and repulsive 
forces. 
These 
atoms 
were 
assumed 
to be situated at the nodes of three 
mutually intersecting sets of equidistant parallel 
planes 
thus 
forming 
a 
point 
lattice (Seeb1). Independently in 
1843 Gabriel Delafosse (1796-1878) 
considering 
only 
the 
centers 
of 
gravity 
of 
the molecules, argued that these 
centers have to form a point lattice (Dela1). 
These ideas of Seeber and Delafosse opend a new area 
in 
crystallography: the investigation of discrete point sets. 
At that time it was assumed that the atoms or molecules in 
a 
crystal would have to be arranged parallel in space and 
thus the mass centers would form 
a 
point 
lattice. 
An 
extension 
of 
this arbitrary assumption of point lattices 
was proposed in 1863 by Christian Wiener 
(Wien1). 
Taking 
up 
the 
ideas 
of 
Wiener 
in 1867 the physicist Leonhard 
Sohncke (1842-1897) proposed 
that 
an 
infinite 
discrete 
point 
system 
is one which shows the same distribution of 
points about each of its points 
(Sohn1). 
Later 
in 
1874 
Sohncke gave a rigourous definition (Sohn2): 
A dicrete 
point 
system 
is 
regular 
if from any two 
points of the system straight lines are 
drawn 
to 
all 
the 
other 
points 
of 
the 
system 
and these two line 
systems are directly or mirror congryent. 
Sohncke 
explicitly 
considered 
direct 
and 
mirror 
congruent 
line systems. 
But then he arbitrarily assumed 
that in nature only direct congruence occurs. 
This 
ques-
tion 
was 
settled 
correctly 
only after several crystals 
were described whose shape could only 
be 
explained 
with 
improper 
symmetry operations. In 1885 Pierre Curie (1859-
1906) gave an example of a crystal form (he 
did 
not 
say 
what crystal species it was) which could only be generated 
by 
a 
fourfold rotoreflection (Curi1). 
In 1887 Leonhard 
Wulff 
showed 
that 
also 
for 
the 
minerals 
dioptase, 
Cu&(Si&01s)e6H20, 
and 
phenakite 
Be2(Si04), 
improper 
rotations are required (Wulf1). 
We notice that Sohncke already 
used 
explicitly 
condi-
tions 1.1 and 1.3 and implicitly he assumed condition 1.2. 
The 
complete 
set 
of 
conditions was enumerated by David 

12 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Hilbert (1862-1943) in his lecture on 
intuitive 
geometry 
(Hilb2). 
Sohncke 
investigated 
the 
regular point systems in the 
plane using only geometric arguments. For the 
first 
time 
he enumerated the 13 different construction types of regu-
lar point systems in the plane which are no~ called the 13 
types of eigensymmetry groups in the plane. 
At that time the successful I determination of the space-
group 
types 
simultaneouslY 
by 
Arthur 
Schonflies 
(1853-1928) and by Evgraph Stepanovich von Fedorov 
(1853-
1919) 
interrupted 
the geometric investigation of regular 
point sets (Scho3, 
Fedo2). 
These 
investigations 
were 
taken 
up again by the crystallographer Paul Niggli (1888-
1953) and by the mathematician Boris 
Nikolaevi~ Delaunay 
and his school. 
Leonhard Sohncke was born in Halle (Germany) in 1842. He 
studied 
at 
Halle and got his theses in 1866. He became a 
lecturer in Konigsberg and in 
1871 
he 
was 
appointed 
a 
professor 
in 
physics 
at the Poly technical Highschool of 
Karlsruhe. Later he went 
to 
Jena 
and 
in 
1888 
he 
was 
appointed 
a 
professor 
in 
physics 
at the Poly technical 
Highschool of Munich where he remainded the 
rest 
of 
his 
life. He died in 1897. 
Evgraph 
Stepanovich 
von 
Fedorov 
was born in Orenburg 
(Russia) in 1853. His father was a military engineer. 
The 
family 
moved 
to St. Petersburg (Leningrad) where the boy 
visited the German school and then he attended the 
school 
of 
military 
engineering. Between 1872 and 1874 he was an 
active officer 
in 
the 
Ukraine. 
He 
then 
resigned 
and 
continued his studies at the medical school of St. Peters-
burg. 
There, he was imprisoned because of his revolution-
ary activities against the 
tsar 
regime. 
He 
managed 
to 
escape 
to 
Germany 
and 
Switzeriand. 
Later 
in 
1880 he 
continued his studies at the Mining-academy of St. Peters-
burg. In 1895 he became 
a 
professor 
in 
mineralogy 
and 
geology at the Highschool for agriculture of Moscow and in 
1905 
he 
was 
appointed director of the Mining-academy of 
St. Petersburg. He died there in 1919. 

2. Dirichlet Domains 
We 
continue 
the 
investigation 
of point sets. In this 
chapter the set X is assumed to be a (r,R)-system. General 
properties of X will 
be 
discussed. 
More 
examples 
and 
results will be 
pr~sented in chapter 9. 
2.1. 
Definition of the Dirichlet domain 
The 
Dirichlet 
domain 
(after 
the 
mathematician Peter 
Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet) 
is 
an 
important 
mathematical 
tool for investigating point sets. 
The metrical and topo-
logical 
properties of a point set X C En can best be seen 
from the Dirichlet domain partition. 
Definition 2.1: 
For 
xo~X the Dirichlet domain 
D{xo) C En 
is 
the 
part of space containing all points which 
are closer to Xo than to any other point 
Xi~X. 
The point Xo is called the reference point of the 
Diri-
chlet domain D(xo). 
Synonymous 
with 
Dirichlet 
domain also Vorono! region, 
Wigner-Seitz cell, 
Brillouin 
zone 
(used 
in 
reciprocal 
space), domain of influence, or plesiohedron are used. 
The reference point Xo is identified with the origin. We 
take 
any 
other 
point 
Xi~X and determine the bisecting 
hyperplane H~ which is normal to the straight line segment 
j("(j'Xt=Xi' 
By 
construction 
all 
points 
p~Hol 
have 
equal 
distance 
from 
Xo and Xi' The hyperplane Hi separates the 
space into two open half-spaces H~ and Hi. We assume Hi to 
contain Xo. It follows that all points p~H~ lie closer 
to 
Xo than to Xi as is shown in Figure 2.1. 
We determine the open half-space for each point x;~X'xo. 
Thus 
the 
open Dirichlet domain Dexo) is the intersection 
of all half-spaces Hi, 
D (X 0) = 
n 
Hi. 
Xt~X'xo 
The half-spaces Hi are convex hence, D(xo) is convex.

Some properties of Dirichlet domains 
For any point p~D(xo) we consider the open ball B(p,lpl) 
with center in p and radius Ipl. We take such a 
ball 
for 
each point p~D(xo) and obtain the region 
Qo = 
U 
B(p, Ipl). 
p~D(xo) 
Theorem 
2.1: 
All 
points x;~X which generate facets of 
D(xo) lie on the boundary of Qo. 
Proof: Suppose there exists a point 
Xj~X 
inside 
a 
ball 
B(p,lpl). 
Then 
the point p would be closer to Xj than 
to Xo. Therefore, p could not belong to D(xo) which 
is 
a contradiction. A point Xj outside of Qo is outside of 
any 
ball 
B(p, Ipl) C Qo 
hence, 
for 
every p"£D(xo) it 
follows that IXjPI>IX;P1 and therefore 
the 
hyperplane 
Hj bisecting XQXj does not intersect O(xo).

Theorem 
2.2: 
In a (r,R)-system X every Dirichlet domain 
D(x;), 
XI~X, is a bounded convex polytope 
with 
a 
finite number of boundary facets. 
D(x;) is deter-
mined 
through 
all points within a ball of radius 
2R and center x;. 
Proof: By theorem 2.1, all points of X generating 
facets 
of 
D(x;) 
lie 
on the boundary of Q;. By condition 1.2 
the radius R is the supreme of radii of 
all 
intersti-
tial 
balls. 
Therefore Q; is contained within a ball 
B(x;,2R). By condition 1.1 
there 
are 
only 
a 
finite 
number of points of X within 
the ball B(x;,2R). 
We 
denote 
by 
cID(x;) 
the 
closure 
of D(x;). A point 
p~clD(x;) is called an extreme point if p is not 
a 
rela-
tive 
interior 
point 
of any closed straight line segment 
[P1,P 2 1 C cIDex,). 
(For details the reader is referred to 
Bron1). 
For a bounded convex polytope the vertices 
Vj 
are 
the 
extreme 
points. 
If the number of facets is finite then 
also the number of vertices is finite. The following theo-
rem holds. 
Theorem 2.3: 
In a er,R)-system X the 
region 
Qi 
of 
any 
Dirichlet 
domain 
D(Xi)' 
Xi~X, 
is 
determined 
through the union of all balls at the vertices 
Vj 
of cID(xi)' 
QI= U B(vj,lXiV'jl) 
vj~clD(xl) 
Proof: 
For 
any 
point 
p(Dexl) 
there 
exists 
a 
closed 
straight line segment [P1,Pzl, P1,p2~cIDex;), such that 
p(int[p1 ,P2]. We have that 
Every point p~D(x;) can 
be 
represented 
as 
a 
linear 
combination 
of 
the 
vertices 
vj~cID(xl) (cf. section 
9.1). 
From the observation that the 
vertices 
Vj 
are 
the 
only points which are not relative interior points 
of cIDex;) the above theorem follows. 
Theorem 2.4: 
In a (r,R)-system X 
the 
Dirichlet 
domain 
O(x;) of any point Xi(X is contained within a ball 
of radius R and center XI'

Hence

2.3. 
Dirichlet domain partition 
We construct the Dirichlet domain D(x;) for 
each 
point 
x;~X. 
This results in a partition of space which has the 
following properties (cf. section 9.1): 
2.1. The union of all 
closed 
Dirichlet 
domains 
cID(x;) 
cover the space, 
U cID(x;) 
En. 
X ;~X 
2.2. The intersection of the interior of any two Dirichlet 
domains is empty, 
intD(x;) n intD(xj)=0, i¢j. 
2.3. The 
intersection 
of two closed Dirichlet domains is 
either empty or a d-face of each. 
The following theorem 2.5 reveals the important covering 
property of the balls B(x;,R). 
Theorem 2.5: 
If 
we 
attach 
at 
each 
point 
Xi 
of 
a 
(r,R)-system X a closed ball of radius R then 
U cIB(xpR) = En.

2.4. 
A practical method to calculate Dirichlet domains 
A closed 
Dirichlet domain clD C E3 is a convex polyhe-
dron P consisting of 0-, 1-, 
and 
2-dimensional 
elements 
called 
vertices 
Vh' edges EI , and faces Fj respectively. 
Among 
these 
elements 
exists 
a 
partial 
order, 
veE C F C P, 
which allows a hierarchical structure (for 
details the reader is referred to Nef2). 
Figure 2.2. Hierarchical structure of a tetrahedron 
Figure 2.2 illustrates the hierarchical structure 
of 
a 
polyhedron. 
The 
elements of a polyhedron are arranged in 
different levels. The zero level 
contains 
the 
vertices. 
The 
first 
level 
contains 
the 
edges. 
Ea~r edge has two 
subordinate vertices. A subordinate ~elationship is 
indi-
cated in the scheme with a line segment connecting an edge 
E; with a subordinate vertex Vh' The second level contains 
the 
faces. If the face F, is a k-gon then F, has k subor-
dinate edges. On the other hand two faces 
meet 
in 
every 
edge. 
A 
vertex 
is 
determined 
by 
at least three faces 
therefore, every vertex must be subordinated to 
at 
least 
three faces. Finally the third level element is called the 

18 
head 
of 
faces. 
the 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
polyhedron 
P. The head has all subordinate 
In a similar way the hierarchical structure of 
a 
n-di-
mensional 
convex polytope PeEn, n~2, can be set up. The 
d-dimensional elements of P are 
called 
d-faces. 
Partic-
ularly 
the 
O-faces 
are called vertices, the 1-faces are 
called edges, 
and 
the 
(n-1)-faces 
are 
called 
facets. 
Every 
d-face 
Fh 
is 
a d-dimensional convex polytope. To 
each 
d-face 
Fh 
are 
subordinated 
all 
the 
(d-1)-faces 
Fj C Fh • 
In Figure 2.3 such subordinate relationships are 
indicated with line segments connecting the 
d-faces 
with 
the 
subordinate 
(d-1)-faces. Again we observe that every 
1-face is 
subordinated 
by 
two 
O-faces. 
In 
general 
a 
d-face, 
d=O, •.• ,n-2, is determined by at least n-d facets 
therefore, every d-face is subordinated to 
at 
least 
n-d 
facets. 
Finally, 
every 
(n-Z)-face 
is 
subordinated 
to 
exactly two facets.

In 
order 
to 
calculate 
the polytope P we start from a 
sufficiently large simplex An C En such that P C An. 
The 
simplex 
in E3 is the tetrahedron. Generally, a simplex in 
En is the convex hull of n+1 points not all of them 
lying 
in 
a 
hyperplane. 
The 
simplex has a particularly simple 
hierarchical structure 
which 
is 
easily 
set 
up. 
The 
simplex 
An 
is 
intersected 
with 
all 
half-spaces 
Ht, 
i=1, ... ,m, which define the polytope P, 
P=A n n H; n ... n H~. 
The calculation of P proceeds along the following steps: 
1. We set up 
the 
hierarchical 
structure 
of 
a 
simplex 
An C En. 
To 
do 
this 
we 
take n+1 points in En and 
assign them to the n+1 vertices of An. In reference 
to 
a 
cartesian 
coordinate 
system 
with origin O(intP we 
assign for the vertices Vi' i=1, ... ,n, the 
coordinates 
(0, ..• ,0'-~i'0, ... ,0) and for the vertex Vn+1 the coor-
dinates 
(t1" .. ,tn)' where ti=t is a real number. 
For 
the remaining 
steps 
we 
have 
to 
consider 
only 
two 
levels, 
say 
d and d-1, d=1, ... ,n, at a time. Ad-face 
Fh C An is determined through d+1 points out of the n+1 
points. There 
are 
(~:~) 
different 
possibilities 
to 
select 
d+1 
points 
out 
of n+1 points. Thus there are 
(~;~) different 
d-faces. 
Recall 
that 
the 
binominal 
coefficient, 
!h\:=h(h-1) ... (h-k+1) , 
k 
1 2 ... k 
is 
defined 
for 
integers 
h~k>O. To each d-face Fh we 
subordinate the adjacent (d-1)-faces. Every 
(d-1)-face 
Fj C Fh 
is 
determined through d points out of the d+1 
points of Fh . There are d+1 possibilities for Fj 
which 
we 
connect 
to Fh . After having performed the subordi-
nation for all Fh we proceed to the next 
higher 
level 
until we have processed level n. 
As an example of this 
step 
we 
may look at Figure 2.2. There, the numbers in 
each box indicate the vertices which are 
contained 
in 
the 
corresponding d-face. 
For computational purposes 
we 
connect 
the 
d-faces 
Fh 
within 
each 
level 
d, 
d=O, •.. n-1, in order to process every level directly. 
2. We 
take the half-space H; and determine the half-space 
intersection An n H;. 
We assume the half-space 
to 
be 
given 
by 
the facet vector 11 orthogonal to the hyper-
plane H~ and by the distance 0>0 of H~ from the origin. 
The hyperplane H~ divides the 
space 
into 
two 
half-

20 
spaces H; 
contain the 
each 
vertex 
assign to it 
tively. This 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
and H; respectively, where H~ is assumed to 
origin. 
In a first step we 
calculate 
for 
Vh if it is contained in H;, 
H~ or H; and 
the code '001', '010', 
or 
'100' 
respec-
is decided upon 
Because 
of rounding errors we use a small limit £>0. 
The following cases may occur: 
.6.?:£ 
if Vh 
abs(.6.)<£ if Vh 
if Vh 
code '001' 
code '010' 
code '100' 
If the code is '100' then the corresponding vertex Vh 
is cut off by H~ and therefore, it is bypassed 
in 
the 
O-level. 
The 
operations 
which 
have 
to 
be performed on the 
higher level elements 
now 
depend 
on 
the 
operations 
applied 
to 
the lower level elements. In the remaining 
steps we have to consider at most 
three 
levels 
at 
a 
time, 
say d, d-1, and d-2 (only in the case that d>1), 
for d=1, •.• , n. 
The code of ad-face Fh is the 
Boolean 
"or" union of the codes of the subordinate (d-1)-faces. 
If 
all 
(d-1)-faces 
F~ C Fh lie in H~, or H; that is, 
the resulting code of Fh is '010', or '110' respective-
ly, then Fh is cut off 
by 
H~ 
and 
therefore, 
it 
is 
bypassed 
in 
the 
d-Ievel. 
If there exist (d-1)-faces 
Fj C Fh on both sides of H~ that is, the resulting code 
is '101' or '111' respectively then a new (d-1)-face F~ 
is generated by H~. 
We add 
F~ with initial code 
'010' 
to the scheme at level d-1 and connect 
F~ to Fh • 
We 
now 
look 
in 
detail 
at each of the (d-1)-faces 
Fj C Fh . If the code of Fj is '100', or 
'110' 
respec-
tively then the corresponding subordination is removed. 
If 
the 
code 
is '001','011', '101', or '111' then two 
cases have to be considered. 
First 
if 
d=1 
then 
the 
intersection 
of the edge Eh:=Fh with the hyperplane H~ 
has to be calculated, 
vn:=F~=Eh n 
H~. 
Second 
if 
d>1 
then 
we 
have 
to consider the (d-2)-faces Fk C Fj. If 
the code of F'k is '010' that is, Fk C H~, then 
F'k 
has 
to 
be connected to the new (d-1)-face F~. This process 
is illustrated in Figure 2.4. 
In a similar way we process all 
we 
proceed to the next h, h:=h+1, 
Fj C Fh' 
Afterwards 
until the level d is

finished. Then we proceed to the next level d, 
d:=d+1, 
unti 1 
level 
.[l 
is 
finished. 
This way the half-space 
intersection is completed.

sections are completed.

This routine is 
very

and 
gives 
a

result within the 
~-limit also in cases, where many redun-
dant 
coincidences 
occur. The procedure is independent of 
the dimension n, however, even for low dimensions, n=5, or 
n=6, the number of d-faces may become very large so that a 
complete calculation of a polytope is beyond any 
existing 
computer 
capabilities. 
A computer program to calculate 
Dirichlet domains of regular point systems has been devel-
oped accord i ng to th is procedure ,e Enge5) . 

3. Lattices 
In 
this chapter X C En is assumed to be a regular point 
system. 
We investigate the periodic property of X. 
3.1. 
The theorem of Bieberbach 
For a given regular point 
system 
X 
we 
construct 
the 
Dirichlet 
domain 
partition T. 
We choose 
xo~X as origin. 
By condition 1.3 and by 
theorem 
2.1, 
every 
D(x; )~T 
is 
congruent 
to 
D(xo). 
By 
theorem 2.2, D(xo) has a finite 
number of facets, hence there exists a point 
group 
P(xo) 
of 
finite order which maps T onto itself and thereby maps 
D(xo) onto itself. 
Condition 1.3 requires a space group G which acts 
tran-
sitively 
on 
X hence, G also acts transitively on T, that 
is, for every pair Dex;), 
DeXj)~T there exists a 
symmetry 
operation 
e5,5)~G 
which 
carries 
Dex;) 
onto 
Dexj) and 
thereby maps T onto itself. 
Theorem 
3.1: 
The 
rotation parts of the symmetry oper-
ations 
(5,5)~G generate a point 
group 
of 
finite 
order. 
Proof: From the observation that D(xo) has a finite number 
of 
facets F; it follows that there exists a finite set 
M of symmetry operations (5;,51)~G each of 
which 
maps 
Dexo) onto a facet sharing Dex;), 
M:={(5j15i)

For further developments the theorem 
of 
Bieberbach 
is 
fundamental (Bieb1). 
Theorem 
3.2: 
Every 
group of symmetry operations in En 
which acts transitively on a regular point 
system 
X contains n linearly independent translations. 
Proof: 
The 
space 
group G contains an infinite number of 
symmetry operations. By theorem 3.1, the rotation parts 
generate a point group of finite 
order 
therefore, 
at 
least 
two different symmerty operations (5,5), (S,r)EG 
exist which have the same rotation part S. 
It 
follows 
that 
where t:=S-1 s -S-1 r , is a translation. Let (I,t1) be the 
smallest 
such 
translation. It generates a subgroup of 
infinite order, 
If we apply T1 to D(xo) a linear array 
of 
equidistant 
Dirichlet 
domains is generated. We determine the right 
coset T1(S,s). It generates a parallel array 
of 
Diri-
chlet 
domains. 
The 
number of such arrays is infinite 
hence, there exists an infinite number of cosets. 
It 
follows 
that 
two 
symmetry 
operations 
belonging 
to 
different cosets exist which 
have 
the 
same 
rotation 
part. 
As 
before, a 
second 
translation (I,t) results 
which is linearly independent of (I,t1)' Let (I,t2) 
be 
the 
shortest such translation. The translation vectors 
t1' t2 generate a subgroup of infinite order 
Similar arguments

that 
n 
linearly

We consider ad-dimensional sUblattice Td of Tn. 
Definition 3.2: 
For a lattice vector t

Tn 
the 
coset 
t+Td is a d-dimensional lattice plane. 
Particularly 
and, if d=n-1, 
if 
d=1 the coset is called a lattice line 
it is called a lattice

if 
n=3, a lattice plane.

Dirichlet parallelotopes 
If we take the point Xo as origin then the action of the 
lattice 
on 
Xo 
generates a point lattice. Around the origin Xo we 
construct the Dirichlet domain P(xo) (cf. section 2.1). It 

34 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
has the property that translates of clP(xo) cover Euclide-
an space En. 
Definition 
3.3: 
A parallelotope P is a convex polytope 
congruent copies of which tile Euclidean space 
En 
by translation. 
The Dirichlet domain P(xo) is a special kind of paralle-
lotope; we call it a Dirichlet parallelotope. 
There 
are 
two 
combinatorial types of parallelogons in 
the plane 
E2 
which 
were 
used 
since 
the 
antique 
for 
pavings. 
These 
are 
the 
centrosymmetric hexagon and the 
rectangle. 
An example of a paving with hexagons, which is 
inspired from the honycombe, is shown in 
Figure 
3.3. 
An 
other example of a tessellation with squares is the chess-
board.

More 
examples and results will be 
presented in chapter 9. 
Although we restrict ourselves to 
Dirichlet parallelotopes most 
results 
remain

for 
general parallelotopes. Voronol (Voro1) implicitly conjec-

If 
the 
lattice 
vector f carries P(xo) onto P(Xj) such 
that clP(xo) n clP(xj)=F is a facet of P(xo), 
then 
f 
is 
called a facet vector. 
We 
now 
give 
conditions 
for 
a lattice vector to be a 
facet vector. Let T' be the sUblattice 
of index 2n. Then Tn can be written as the union of 
h:=2n 
cosets, 
The following theorem of Varano! (Voro1, No. 48) complete-
ly characterizes the facet vectors of P(xo). 
Theorem 
3.5: 
The 
lattice 
vectors 
f and -f are facet 
vectors of P(xo) if and

if 
f 
and 
-f

the

means 
that the bisecting hyperplane HO

the only shortest vectors in their coset f+T' then they 
are 
facet vectors. 
In the limiting case that 111=lf'l 
then neither f nor f' is a facet vector. 
Un upper limit for the number 
of 
facets 
of 
P(xo) 
is 
given by the following theorem due to Minkowski: 
Theorem 3.6: 
The number of facets of a Dirichlet paralle-
lotope P is less or equal to 2(2 n-1). 
Proof: 
The 
following proof of Vorono! (Voro1, No. 55) is 
based on theorem 3.5. The number of cosets of T' in 
Tn 
is 2n. Excluding the coset T' there remain 2n-1 cosets. 
If 
each 
of 
these 
co sets 
has 
exactly 
two shortest 
lattice vectors, 1 and -1 respectively, then there 
are 
2(2 n-1) facet vectors. 
Ad-face 
F 
of a polytope in En is defined by at least 
n-d facets (cf. section 2.4). 
It follows that in a 
face-
to-face 
tiling 
of En at least n-d+1 contiguous polytopes 
meet in every d-face. Using this property Voronol

exactly one of the Pv say Pn does not contain

of shortest linearly independent

vectors.

Therefore, 
i(f1+f2)~intP hence, 
11+12 
is 
a

If 1 1 -1 2>0 then by the same argument 11+12 
is 
no 
facet vector. 
By theorem 3.4, the Dirichlet paral-
lelotope P is centrosymmetric hence, 
there 
exist, 
if

four or, if 11-12~0, six facet vectors in the

Let F1, ••. ,Fk,Fk+1=F 1 , k=4 
or 
k=6, 
be 
the facets of a belt. If F1 n F2=F; is a (n-2)-face 
of P then F~ defines a belt. By theorem 3.4, each facet 
is centrosymmetric therefore, 
also 
F; n F;+1=Fi, 
for 
i=2, •• ,k. 
The Fi are perpendicular to the supporting 
plane. 
The more general result that every convex polytope which 
fulfils the conditions of theorem 3.4 and 3.9 is a 
paral-
lelotope was proved by Venkov (Venk1) and independently by 
McMullen (McMu1). 
The 
following theorem only holds for Dirichlet paralle-
lotopes. 
Theorem 3.10: 
Each belt of a Dirichlet parallelotope P is 
contained in a rotation cylinder which is orthogo-
nal to the corresponding supporting plane. 
Proof: This theorem immediately follows from the 
property 
that the facets are orthogonal to the facet vectors.

LATTICES 
41 
Proof: 
Let If1IS ... Slfnl be shortest linearly independent 
lattice vectors. We assume that 
f;-fj<O 
for 
i~j. 
By 
theorem 3.8, f;,fj are facet vectors hence, by theorem 
3.9 f;+fj is also a 
facet 
vector 
(we 
note 
that 
if 
f; ·f j > 0 
then 
f; -f· i s a fa c e t v e c tor). It follow s, i n 
general, that also l;+fj+ ... +fk' i~j~ .•• ~k, is a 
facet 
vector. 
1. The lattice vectors f;,fj generate a belt. There are 
(~) 
such 
belts. 
The 
lattice 
vectors fl+fj' 
fk+fl 
i,j~k,l generate a belt. There are 
(~) lattice 
vectors 
f;+f j . To each such lattice vector exists (n22) differ-
ent 
lattice 
vectors fk+fl' 
Thereby, we have counted 
every combination twice hence, there are i(1)(ni 2 ) such 
belts. 
2. Suppose the lattice vectors f;, fj+fk+fl' i=j 
or 
k 
or 
1, 
generate 
a belt. There are 
(~) lattice vectors 
fj+fk+fl' To 
each 
such 
lattice 
vector 
exist 
three 
vectors f;, 
i=j,k,l. 
Therefore, 
there are 3(~) such 
belts. (The case that 
i~j,k,l is contained in the 
next 
step where f;, fj+fk+fl+fm' i=j or k or 1 or m generate 
a 
belt). 
Suppose the lattice vectors f;+fj' fk+fl+fm, 
i.j~k,l,m generate 
a 
belt. 
There 
are 
(~) 
lattice 
vectors 
fk+fl+fm. 
To 
each 
such lattice vector exist 
(n 23) lattice vectors f;+fj. Hence, there are 
at 
most 
(~)(n23) 
such 
belts. 
Suppose 
the 
lattice 
vectors 
fl+fj+f k • f1+fm+f n , 
i,j,k~l,m,n generate a belt. 
There 
are 
(3) lattice vectors f;+fj+fk' 
To each such lattic 
vector exists (n~3) vectors fl+fm+f n . TherRby, we 
have 
counted 
every 
combination 
twice 
hence, 
there 
are 
i(~)(n33) such belts. 
3. Finally suppose f;, f1+ ... +fn generate a belt. There 
is

There 
exist

The next theorem reveals 
the 
important 
property 
that 
always 
a 
lattice 
basis 
can 
be 
found 
among the facet 
vectors of a Dirichlet parallelotope P(xo). 
For a 
vertex 
vhE:cIP(xo) 
we 
assign the ball B(Vh' lithl) of radius lithl.

The

hyperplanes 
H; 
of 
all 
lattice 
vectors

i=1, ••• ,1, 
contain the vertex Vh' Let k 
of these 
lattice 
vectors, 
1 1 , ••• ,1 k ,1 k + 1 =1 1 , 
be 
facet 
vectors. 
We cyclically order these facet vectors by the 
requirement that for the corresponding facets we obtain 
where 
F~ is a (n-2)-face of cIP(xo). Such an 
ordered 
set 
of 
facet vectors we call a cycle of facet vectors belong-
ing to a vertex v. 
We generate the orbit of Vh under 
the 
group 
G 
of all isometries of the lattice Tn (cf. section 
8.1 ) , 
Let D(vh) be the Dirichlet domain of Vh with respect 
to 
O(G,Vh)' Let Rm be the radius of a maximal ball of D(Vh)' 
Theorem 
3.12: 
If 
IVhl>Rm 
then 
in the cycle of facet 
vectors 1 1 " 
•• ,1 k ,1 k + 1 =1 1 , belonging to the vertex 
vh~cIP(xo) any sequence 
of 
n 
consecutive

vectors forms a lattice basis of Tn. 
Proof:

First we show

Suppose 
that

becomes 
that the lattice T' generated by 
is 
not 
a 
sublattice 
of 
Tn. 
The 
coset 
decomposition of Tn 
We attach at each vertex vv~O(G,Vh) a ball 
Bevv,lvhlJ. 
By 
the 
covering property (cf. theorem 2.5) it follows 
that 
U cIB(vv,R m ) 
En. 
vv~O(G,Vh) 
By the condition IVhl>Rm 
U B(vv,lvhl) = En. 
vv~O(G,Vh) 
it follows that 
Therefore, a v exists such that 
the 
coset 
represent-
ative b; is contained in B(vv' IVhl). Since Vv is equiv-
alent 
to Vh under G there exists an isometry a~G which 
carries bl into b'~B(Vh' IVhl). Therefore, the bisecting 
hyperplane HO of b' cuts off Vh hence, vh(cIP(xo) which 

LATIICES 
43 
contradicts the assumption that vh~cIP(xo). It 
follows 
that T'=Tn. 
2. 
Next 
we 
show 
that 
any sequence of n consecutive 
facet vectors among the cycle f1' ..• ,fk,fk+1=f1 form 
a 
lattice 
basis. 
Always n among them are linearly inde-
pendent because otherwise Vh cannot be a 
vertex 
of 
a 
convex 
polytope. 
We 
choose 
any 
sequence of n facet 
vectors which we designate with a1, •.. ,an • 
The 
corre-
sponding 
facets 
are 
called 
F1, ... ,F n • 
We 
take a1' 
Translates of cIP(xo) by a1 form a prism

A1 
is a free parameter. In general, the number of free 
paramters A; is defined as the extent of 
C', 
abbrevi-
ated as ext(C'). In this case ext(C')=1. 
By assumption 
F1 n F2=F;. The (n-2)-face F; defines a belt. 
By theo-
rem 3.8. the projection of the belt into the supporting 
plane 
~(a1,a2) 
is either a centrosymmetric hexagon or 
rectangle. Both are parallelogons. Translates of 
these 
with 
a1 
and 
a2 
cover the plane ~(a1.a2)' The corre-
sponding Dirichlet parallelotopes form a prism C(a1.a2) 
of extent 2. We take a3' By assumption F2 n F3=F2' 
The 
(n-2)-face F2 defines a belt. 
The parallelogons in the 
supporting 
plane 
~(a2.a3) cover the plane. The corre-
sponding 
Dirichlet 
parallelotopes 
form 
a 
prism 
C(a2.a3)' 
By 
multiples 
of the translation a1 this is 
true for every P~C(a1)' Thus we get a prism C(a1,a2.a3) 
of extent 3. This process is continued until an' Final-
ly we 
have 
C(a1 ••••• an)=En. 
Thus 
a1 ••••• an 
form 
a 
lattice basis. 
Let 
R 
be the radius of a maximal ball of the Dirichlet 
parallelotope 
P(xo). 
R=max(\v,\, v;(cIP(xo». 
As 
D(vh)CP(vh)' 
P(Vh):=P(XO)+Vh' it follows that Rm~R there-
fore. for every lattice Tn there exists a lattice basis of 
facet vectors. 
For Rm=R the equal sign holds 
in 
theorem 
3.12. 

4. Reduction of Quadratic Forms 
For 
applications 
it 
is important to decide wether two 
different lattice bases belong to one and the same lattice 
Tn. This problem is solved through the determination of an 
integral reduced form denoted here as ~-reduced. 
4.1. 
Defjnitjon of the ~-reduced form 
In section 3.2 we 
have 
defined 
the 
positive-definite 
n-nary quadratic form 
n 
n 
xtCx = r 
~ c;jm;mj = f(m1, ••• ,m n ), 
1=1 
j=1 
where 
C 
is 
the 
metric tensor of a lattice basis of Tn. 
Under a change of lattice basis the 
metric 
tensor 
C 
is 
transformed according to (cf. section 3.2) 
C':= ACAt, 
where 
A 
is a unimodular nxn matrix with integral coeffi-
cients. 
This is an equivalence relation and C' is said to 
be equivalent to C (cf. section 1.5). 
Definition 4.1: 
In a class of equivalent 
positive-defin-
ite 
n-nary 
quadratic 
forms 
a 
form 
is 
called 
~-reduced if it assumes successive minima for 
the 
n-tuples (1,0, .•. ,0), ••• ,(0, ••. ,0,1) and, if some 
of 
the 
minima are not unique, the form fulfils a 
system of selection rules. 
The following theorem is due to Lagrange (for 
n=2), 
to 
Seeber 
(for 
n=3) 
and, in the general case, to Minkowski 
(Mink1). 
Theorem 4.1: 
In each class of equivalent 
positive-defin-
ite 
n-nary 
quadratic 
forms 
exists 
a 
unique 
~-reduced form. 
Proof: Each class of equivalent 
positive-definite 
n-nary 
quadratic 
forms represents a lattice Tn. Let Po be the 
parallelotope of Tn and let R be the radius of a 
maxi-
mal 
interstitial 
ball 
of 
Tn. For n=1 the theorem is 
evident. Take n>1. We assume the theorem to be 
correct 
44 

REDUCfrON OF QUADRATIC FORMS 
45 
for 
n-1. 
Let 
P' be the parallelotope of Tn-1 and let 
R'<R be the radius of a maximal 
interstitial 
ball 
of 
Tn-1. 
Within 
a layer spacing of 2R from Tn-1 at least 
another coset U:=t+Tn-1 exists. 
There exists a lattice 
vector an~U such that the orthogonal projection 
of 
an 
falls 
into 
the 
interior or on the boundary of P'. It 
follows that lanl~V4R2+R'2 <VSR. 
Within 
a 
ball 
of 
radius 
VSR 
only 
a 
finite 
number of lattice vectors 
exists therefore, a lattice vector an of minimal length 
can be found. If In is not unique then a finite 
number 
of selection rules can specify a unique solution. 
In 
the 
following 
sections 
we 
will 
discuss 
various 
reduction schemes. There are other possibilities to define 
a 
~-reduced form. 
Such an alternative definition is given 
in section 4.4. 
4.2. 
The reduction scheme of Lagrange 
The reduction scheme of Lagrange is based on the follwo-
ing theorem: 
Theorem 4.2: 
In a lattice T2 two shortest linearly 
inde-
pendent lattice vectors form a lattice basis. 
Proof: 
Let 
la11~1121 be two shortest linearly independent 
lattice vectors. 
Suppose they generate a lattice 
T'2. 
We 
construct the Dirichlet para I Ie logon Po of T'2. Let 
Vh be a vertex of clPo. 
By theorem 3.10, all 
vertices 
of 
clP o lie on a circle hence, R=lvhl is the radius of 
the maximal interstitial ball. 
If 1 1 ,1 2 do not form 
a 
lattice 
basis 
of 
T2 
then necessarily there exists a 
further lattice 
vector 
t~cIPo. 
By 
theorem 
2.4, 
it 
follows that 
Hence, Itl<la21 which is a contradiction. 
For the derivation of Lagrange's reduction conditions we 
can assume that 

46 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Then necessarily, as can be seen from Figure 4.1, it holds 
that 
because otherwise 
would be shorter than a2 since 
by the law of cosines. The expression Sgn(c12) denotes the 
sign of C12 and may assume the values +1 if 
C12>O, 
0 
if 
C12=O, 
or 
-1 
if 
C12<O. 
If further we require that the 
angle U12 is acute then according to 
Lagrange 
(Lagr1) 
a 
complete system of reduction conditions in E2 is obtained. 
Definition 4.2: 
A positive-definite binary quadratic form 
is 
called 
~-reduced according to Lagrange if the 
following conditions are fulfilled:

The reduction scheme of Seeber is based on the following 
theorem: 
Theorem 4.3: 
In a lattice 
T3 
three 
shortest 
linearly 
independent lattice vectors form a lattice basis. 
Proof: Let la11Sla21Sla 3 1 be three shortest linearly inde-
pendent

Suppose 
they 
generate a 
lattice T'3. 
Let Po be the 
Dirichlet 
parallelohedron 
of

and let R be the radius of a maximal intersti-
tial ball. 
If a1' a2' and a3 do 
not 
form 
a 
lattice 
basis 
of 
T3 
then 
necessarily there exists a further 
lattice vector t~cIPo. By theorem 2.4, it follows that 
Hence. Itl<la31 which is a contradiction. 

REDUCfION OF QUADRATIC FORMS 
47 
If some of the successive minima of 
the 
form 
are 
not 
unique 
then 
a 
rather 
complicated 
set of specification 
rules is needed in order to obtain a 
complete 
system 
of 
reduction 
conditions. 
The following reduction scheme in 
E3 is due to Seeber (Seeb2. No. 26). 
The 
angles 
between 
the 
basis 
vectors can be chosen either all acute or else 
all obtuse or right. Correspondingly a l-reduced 
form 
is 
called here acute or obtuse respectively (Seeber called it 
"positive" 
or 
"negative" 
respectively 
which however is 
confusing with the expression positive-definite). 
Defjnitjon 4.3: 
A positive-definite 
ternary 
quadratic 
form is called l-reduced according to Seeber (also 
Niggli-reduced)

the

This system of reduction conditions determines for 
each 
class 
of 
equivalent 
forms 
a 
unique 
l-reduced lattice 
basis. 
A geometric interpretation of Seeber's reduction 
condi-
tions 
was 
given 
by Dirichlet (Diri1) who introduced the 

48 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Dirichlet domain. By theorem 4.2, 
two 
shortest 
linearly 
independent 
lattice 
vectors a1' a2 generate a sublattice 
T2 
with 
Dirichlet 
parallelogon 
P. 
The 
orthogonal 
projection of a shortest lattice vector a3' which is line-
arly 
independent of a1 and a2' has to fall into the inte-
rior or on the boundary of P because otherwise 
a 
shorter 
lattice 
vector would exist in the coset a3+T2. It follows 
that the boundary of P gives the required conditions for a 
shortest lattice vector a3' If 1 generates an 
edge 
of 
P 
then necessarily 
By 
theorem 
3.9, the parallelogon P has four or six edges 
only. It follows that for acute reduced forms with a1-a2>O 
only the two conditions 
have to be considered for 
a3' 
In 
terms 
of 
the 
metric 
tensor these conditions are written as 
For obtuse reduced forms with a1-a2<O also the edge deter-
mined 
by 
the vector a1+a2 gives a possible condition for 
a3 hence, in addition we have 
In terms of the metric tensor this condition can be 
writ-
ten as 
If 
the 
orthogonal projection of aJ falls on the boundary 
of P then auxilIary conditions are needed in order to make 
a unique choice (for details the reader is referred to the 
International Tables Vol. A). 
4.3.2. Determination of the Seeber reduced form 
Seeber described the following 
algorithm 
to 
determine 
the reduced lattice basis (Seeb2, No. 27). 
If 
21c121 > C11 then a reduction step in Seeber's algo-
rithm is as follows: We set

Krivy and Gruber in 1976 (Kriv1). 
Using 
Seeber's 
reduction 
conditions 
Niggli 
(Nigg3) 
investigated the lattices in EJ and distinguished 44 types 
of Seeber ~-reduced forms which are given in Table 4.2. 
For the reduction of positive-definite ternary quadratic 
forms 
a 
computer program has been developed (Enge6). The 
program gives after m reduction steps the final 
transfor-
mation 
where 
the 
AI 
are 
the transformations given in Seeber's 
algorithm. The program then assigns the ~-reduced form 
to 
one 
of 
Niggli's 
44 types and gives the transformation W 
into the conventional crystallographic unit cell according 
to the International Tables Vol. A (Hahn1).

An 
alternative reduction scheme in El, which however is 
not conform to our definition 4.1, was described by 
Sell-
ing (SeI11). Selling introduced a fourth lattice vector 
so that the vector sum becomes zero, 
The 
four 
lattice 
vectors define six homogeneous coeffi-
cients C12' C13' C14' C23' C24' and C34' 
Defioi:tion 4.4: 
The six homogeneous 
coefficients 
in 
E3 
are 
if-reduced 
according 
to Selling (also Delau-
nay-reduced) if 
is minimal. 
The minimum of a is 
obtained 
if 
all 
six 
homogeneous 
coefficients are negative, 
Indeed, if for example 

60 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
then we set 
a~ : = -a- l' a ~ : = it 2 , 
so 
that 
the 
angle 
between a1 and a2 becomes obtuse. In 
order to keep the vector sum zero we set 
It follows that 
= a -2C12' 
Hence, a' is reduced by 2C12' The number of such reduction 
steps is finite because within a ball of radius va 
only 
a 
finite number of lattice vectors exists. Such a minimum 
is asserted for every lattice. 
Figure 4.2. The Delaunay tetrahedron 
4.4.2. Determination of the Selling reduced form 
De1aunay (De102) has visualized such a reduction step on 
a tetrahedron as shown in Figure 4.2. 
The vertices of the 
tetrahedron are identified with the four 
lattice 
vectors 
ah,a"aj1 and ak' 
The edge connecting a, with aj is iden-
tified with the coefficient Cfj. If one of the six coeffi-

We 
set

six derived coefficients become: 
The results of this computations may be summerized in 
the 
following rules. If Cij>O then we proceed as follows: 
1. Add Cij to all coefficients whose edge meet the edge of 
c i j • 
2. Subtract 
Cij 
from the coefficient whose edge does not 
meet the edge of Cij. 
3. Exchange the coefficients Cih and Cik. 
4. Change the sign of Cij. 
Two lattice bases are equivalent if they 
agree

reduced 
homogeneous 
coefficients 
Cij. On the other 
hand the six homogeneous coefficients do not 
determine 
a 
unique 
lattice 
basis. 
Patterson and Love (Patt1) gave 
examples where different lattice bases, belonging 
to 
the 
same lattice, result in the same reduced homogeneous coef-
ficients c\j. 
The basis vectors a1' a2' and aJ determined from the six 
reduced 
homogeneous 
coefficients 
not always include the 
three 
shortest 
linearly 
independent 
lattice 
vectors. 
However, these are included amongst the lattice vectors 
Delaunay 
(Delo2) 
has described- the 24 various kinds of 
Selling reduced lattice types.

GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
4.5. 
The reduction scheme of Minkowski 
Contrary 
to 
the two- and three-dimensional lattice, it 
is remarkable that in higher dimensional lattices n short-
est linearly independent lattice vectors do not 
necessar-
ily 
form 
a 
lattice 
basis. 
This is demonstrated in the 
following example due to Bieberbach and Schur (Bieb3). 
Example 
4.1: 
In 
ES 
consider 
the 
following 
referred to a cartesian coordinate system, 
... ai : = (1,0.0.0.0) 
a2 : = (0,1,0,0,0) 
a3 : = (0,0.1.0.0) 
... 
(0.0,0,1,0) 
a4. : = 
as : = (~d,~,~d). 
vectors. 
They 
form 
a lattice basis of a lattice TS. 
The length 
of as is VS/2. We determine the lattice vector b~Ts, 
Although b is shorter than as it does not form 
together 
with a1'" .,a4 a lattice basis of TS because the volume of 
the corresponding parallelepiped is twice as large as that 
of 
ai" ..• as. 
The 
basis 
vectors a1' .••• a4 generate a 
sUblattice T4. The co sets t;+T4 generate an infinite stack 
of parallel lattice hyperplanes F; which can be labeled in 
the following way (cf. section 3.4). 
The basis vector as 
ends 
in 
F1 
whereas 
the 
shorter 
lattice 
vector b ends in the second lattice plane F2' 
We 
encounter here for the first time the 
phenomenon 
that 
a 
shortest 
linearly independent lattice vector does not end 
in a lattice hyperplane which has the smallest 
interlayer 
spacing from the sublattice T4. 
A general 
reduction scheme applicable to any dimension 
was proposed by Minkowski 
(Mink1). 
The 
above 
example 
shows 
that 
a 
shortest 
lattice vector which is linearly 
independent 
of 
the 
a1' .•.• ak-1 
does 
not 
necessarily 
belongs 
to a lattice basis in the sublattice Tk. However. 
if we take a 
shortest 
lattice 
vector 
among 
all 
those 
lattice 
vectors t:=mia1, ... ,mnan which form together with 
ai' •.•• ak-i a basis in the sUblattice Tk then a 
~-reduced 

REDUCTION OF QUADRATIC FORMS 
63 
lattice 
basis 
is obtained. 
Ihe following theorem is due 
to Mi nkowsk i . 
Iheorem 4.4: 
Let ai, ••• ,an be a lattice basis of In. 
Ihe 
lattice 
vector 
t:=mia1+ ••• +mnan 
forms 
together 
with the lattice 
vectors 
a1, ... ,ak-i' 
1<k$n, 
a 
lattice basis of the sublattice Ik if the greatest 
common 
divisor 
of 
mk' .••• mn • gcd(mk, •.. ,m n ), is 
equal to 1. 
Proof: Ihe basis vectors a1, ••• ,ak-i generate the 
sublat-
tice I'. As gcdCmk, .•. ,mn)=1 it follows that not all of 
the 
mk ••••• mn 
can 
be 
zero. Iherefore, t is linearly 
independent of a1 ••.•• ak-i. Further it follows that for 
every integer Ihl>1 the vector t/h 
is 
not 
a 
lattice 
vector. 
Iherefore. the cosets mt+I'. 
m~~. generate the 
sUblattice Ik. 
When 
setting 
up the reduction conditions Minkowski did 
not consider the special case 
that 
ak 
is 
not 
uniquely 
determined. 
Ihis is the case if the orthogonal projection 
of 
ak 
onto 
T' 
falls 
on 
the boundary of the Dirichlet 
parallelotope P' of I'. 
Also Van der Waerden (Waer2) 
and 
Weber 
(Webe2) 
gave 
only 
the 
main 
conditions 
for the 
reduced form. 
In order 
to 
make 
the 
reduction 
scheme 
complete selection rules have to be appended. 
Defjnition 4.5; 
A positive-definite n-nary quadratic form 
is ~-reduced according to Minkowski if the follow-
ing conditions are fulfilled: 
Main conditions: 
1. Ckk $ f(mi' •••• mn). gcdCmk •••• ,m n)=1, 
ml~~ 
2. 
Ckk+1~O 
We 
now 
give sel~ction rules to make the ~-reduced form 
unique. 
Selection rules: 
Let Mi be the set of all lattice vectors r1l of

GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
gcdCm3, ..• ,m n )=1 and 
length 
la31, 
and 
with 
maximal 
CZ;3j' 
Among 
these 
we 
take 
all 
those with maximal 
C1;3j' Continuing in this way we end up with a 
set 
Mn 
of 
~-reduced lattice bases Bn. By construction, all of 
them have the same metric 
tensor 
C 
hence, 
they 
are 
related through a symmetry operation of Tn. 
Even for low dimensions n=5 or n=6 the number of sets Bk 
may 
become 
very large. Therefore, the a priori knowledge 
of the symmetry of the lattice Tn drastically 
can 
reduce 
the calculations envolved. 
The 
above 
definition 
4.5 contains an unlimited set of 
reduction conditions. 
Therefore, 
the 
first 
finiteness 
theorem of Minkowski (Mink1, Bieb3) is decisive. 
Theorem 
4.6: 
The 
reduction 
conditions 
according 
to 
Minkowski all arise from a finite 
number 
amongst 
them. 
Proof: 
Let 
t:=m1a1+ ..• +mnan' 
bdcCmk, ••. ,mn)=1. 
Assume 
that a1'" .,ak-1 is a ~-reduced basis in the sublattice 
T' and let P' be its Dirichlet parallelotope. 
A short-
est lattice vector r of the coset t+T' has an 
orthogo-
nal projection onto T' which falls into the interior or 
on 
the 
boundary 
of 
P' 
because 
otherwise a shorter 
lattice vektor r'£t+T' would exist. 
It 
follows 
that 
the facets of P' give the necessary restrictions for r. 
Let 
f:=h1a1+ ••• ~hk-1ak-1 
be a facet vector of P'. 
By 
theorem 2.2, the parallelotope P' 
has 
only 
a 
finite 
number of facets hence, a finite number of inequalities 
of the form 
determine r. 
Minkowski 
proved 
that 
for 
n 
~ 4 
it is sufficient to 
consider the values -1, 0, 1 for the mi' This 
corresponds 
Ito 
the 
observation 
that 
up 
to T3 only lattice vectors 
f=m1a1+mZaZ+m3aJ' 
m;=-1,0,1, 
referred 
to 
a 
l-reduced 
lattice basis, 
are facet vectors. 
For the determination 
of a4 in T4 the coefficient m4 is 1 by definition. 
In two- and 
three-dimensional 
space 
two 
respectively 
three shortest linearly independent lattice vectors form a 
lattice 
basis. 
It 
follows 
from 
theorem 3.8 that these 
basis vectors are facet vectors of the Dirichlet 
paralle-
lotope. 
In 
higher 
dimensional 
spaces this is no longer

Historical remarks 
The mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736-1813) 
was 
the 
first 
to show that in each class of equivalent posi-
tive-definite binary quadratic forms 
a 
unique 
~-reduced 
form 
exists 
which fulfils a set of inequalities (Lagr1). 
The binary and ternary quadratic forms were also 
investi-
gatedbyl~mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) in 
his 
"Disquisitiones arithmeticae". However, the difficult 
problem to extend Lagrange's theory 
to the ternary 
forms 
was achieved by the physicist Ludwig August Seeber in 1831 
(Seeb2). 
Gauss had reviewed Seeber's book and has appri-
ciated his results although he mentioned that 
the 
proofs 
were very lengthy and cumbersome (Gaus1). Seeber had stat-
ed 
the 
auxilIary 
conditions 
in 
terms 
of 
the adjoint 
lattice 
which 
is 
called 
now 
the 
dual 
or 
reciprocal 
lattice. 
This 
is 
the 
first 
time that the reciprocal 
lattice is used in 
crystallography. 
The 
present 
formu-
lation 
of 
the 
auxilIary 
conditions 
is due to Gotthold 
Eisenstein (1823-1852) (Eise1). In 1850 the 
mathematician 
Peter 
Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1805-1859) gave a 
geomet~ 
ric 
interpretation 
of 
Seeber's 
reduction 
conditions 
through 
the 
construction 
of the Dirichlet parallelogon. 
The general case of the positive-definite n-nary quadratic 
forms was solved in 
1905 
by 
the 
mathematician 
Hermann 
Minkowski 
(1864-1909) 
(Mink1). 
Dirichlet's 
method 
was 
further developed by M. Georges 
Voronol 
(1868-1908) 
who 
investigated the parallelotopes in higher dimensions. 
In 
1824 Seeber proposed to represent the atoms or mole-
cules by a system of small spherical balls 
which 
form 
a 
space lattice (cf. section 1.6), With his reduction condi-
tions 
he 
was able to classify the possible lattice types 
according to their ~-reduced forms. Seeber hoped that this 
classification would describe all possible crystal 
struc-
tures. 
However, 
Seeber's 
work on crystal lattices was 
largely overlooked by crystallographers at that time. Only 
in 1928 Niggli introduced the reduction theory 
of 
Seeber 
into 
crystallography 
and he completely enumerated the 44 
types of ~-reduced forms (Nigg3). But again Niggli's 
work 
was 
overlooked 
for a long time. In 1932 Boris Nikolaevi~ 
Delaunay introduced the reduction scheme of 
Selling 
into 
crystallography 
and 
he 
developed 
a simple algorithm to 
obtain the Selling reduced homogeneous coefficients 
which 
is 
based 
on 
a representation of these coefficients in a 
tetrahedron (Del02). However, the Selling 
reduction 
does 
not give a unique lattice basis. Because of this disadvan-
tage 
simplified versions of Seeber's reduction conditions 

REDUCTION OF QUADRATIC FORMS 
67 
were 
again 
used 
to find a reduced lattice basis. In the 
years 1960 to 1978 many incomplete results were 
published 
in the crystallographic literature. It is due to K~ivy and 
Gruber 
that 
the work of Niggli was rediscovered in 1978. 
However, these authers, as 
well 
as 
the 
previous 
ones, 
overlooked 
that 
already 
Seeber 
in 1831 gave a complete 
reduction algorithm. 
Ludwig August Seeber was born in Karlsruhe (Germany) 
in 
1793. 
Between the years 1819-1822 he was a teacher at the 
Military School in Karlsruhe. 
He 
was 
then 
appointed 
a 
professor in physics at the University of Freiburg (Germa-
ny). 
In 
the 
year 
1834 
he was appointed a professor in 
physics at the Poly technical School in Karlsruhe. However, 
he was not very successful there and had 
severe 
problems 
of 
discipline 
so 
that 
in 1840 he had to retire in good 
time. 
He died in 1855. 

5. Crystallographic Symmetry Operations 
In 
this chapter we investigate the restrictions imposed 
by a lattice on the symmetry operations acting on a 
regu-
lar point system X C En. 
5.1. 
Definitions 
Let 
G be a space group acting transitively on a regular 
point system X. By theorem 3.2, the existence of a lattice 
Tn < G is asserted, 
The lattice vectors a1" .. ,an form a lattice 
basis. 
In 
order to get the possible symmetry operations (5,s) ~ G we 
have 
to 
determine within the Euclidean group IE(n) of all 
isometries those symmetry operations which map the lattice 
Tn onto itself. 
Definition 5.1: 
A crystallographic symmetry operation 
is 
an 
isometry 
which brings a lattice Tn into self-
coincidence. 
Every translation (I,t) 
of 
Tn 
is 
a 
crystallographic 
symmetry operation. We take a conjugate of (I,t) in G. For 
a symmetry operation (S,s) ~ G we calculate 
= (I.,St). 
We require that the symmetry operation (I,St) again is a 
translation of Tn. 
It follows that the rotation part 5 of 
the 
symmetry 
operation 
maps the lattice onto itself and 
thereby leaves the origin fixed. A necessary condition for 
a symmetry operation (S,s) to have this property is 
given 
in the following theorem. 
Theorem 5.1: 
The rotation part 5 of every crystallograph-
ic 
symmetry 
operation has a representation in En 
through a unimodular nxn matrix with integer coef-
ficients. 
68 

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC SYMMETRY OPERA nONS 
69 
Proof: The rotation 5 is an isometry therefore, the repre-
sentation matrix is unimodular (cf. section 
1.3). 
5 
carries 
the 
lattice 
basis a1'" .,an into the lattice 
vectors t1, •.. ,t n • 
In reference to the 
lattice 
basis 
a1, ••• ,an , 
every lattice vector has integer components 
therefore, the representation matrix has integer 
coef-
ficients Sij' 
Every 
rotation 5 ~ G maps a lattice vector t onto a new 
lattice vector t' of equal length It I • 
By condition 
1.1 
only 
a 
finite 
number 
of 
lattice vectors o'f length It I 
exists 
within 
a 
ball 
of 
radius 
It I • 
Therefore, 
the 
original 
system 
of 
basis 
vectors has to be identically 
restored after a finite 
number 
of 
repetitions. 
If 
the 
integer k is the smallest such number then 
Sk = I. 
The 
integer k is called the order of the rotation S. We 
calculate 
The screw vector t:=Sk- 1 S+ .•• +Ss+s again 
is 
a 
lattice 
vector of Tn, which poses restrictions on the shift vector 
S. 
These 
restrictions 
will 
be 
considered 
later 
in 
sections 5.5 and 8.2. 
The following definitions and results 
are 
standard 
in 
linear 
algebra. If for x 
~ En, 
X~O, we have 
Sx = AX, 
then X is 
the eigenvector and A the eigenvalue of S. We 
rewrite this equation in the form 
CS-AI)x = O. 
In order that A is an eigenvalue of S it is necessary that 
det(S-AI) = O. 
The determinant detCS-AI) 
polynom of S. 
is 
called 
the 
characteristic 
Theorem 
5.2: 
The 
characteristic 
polynom detCS-AI) is 
invariant under a transformation of the basis. 

70 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Proof: Under a change of basis 5 is transformed into AtSAo 
Ccf. section 3.2). 
We recall that 
detCAS)=detCA)detCS), detCA-1)=1/detCA), and AI=IA. 
Referred to the new basis, the 
characteristic 
polynom 
becomes 
detc S-AI) . 
The characteristic polynom is of degree n in A, 
We 
note 
that ~n is equal to the determinant detCS) and 
t hat ~ n _ 1 i seq u a 1 tot h e t r ace t r C 5) : = ~.s; ;. 
The 
i n v a r i -
ance of the characteristic polynom requires the invariance 
of 
the 
coefficients 
~n""'~O' In particular detCS) and 
trCS) are invariant under a change of basis. 
5.2. 
Rotat ions in E2 
In the plane E2 we consider a rotation 5 
which 
carries 
the point x over to the point x'. In reference to a carte-
sian 
coordinate system, the rotation 5 can be represented 
through a 2x2 matrix 
cos~ -sin~ 
5+ : = 
sin~ 
cos~ 
if 5 is a proper rotation, or 
-1 
: I 
5-
: = 
0 
if 5 is a reflection. 

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC SYMMETRY OPERATIONS 
71 
5+ 
is 
an anticlockwise rotation with rotation angle ~. 
The determinant of 5+ is 
detCS+) = cos2~ + sin2~ = 1. 
5- is a reflection in the second 
coordinate 
axis. 
The 
determinant detCS)=-1. 
We 
now determine among all rotations in the plane those 
rotations which leave the lattice T2 invariant. By theorem 
5.1, these are just the rotations which allow an 
integral 
representation 
by 2x2 matrices. 
The characteristic ploy-
nom of 5 becomes, 
detCS-AI) = A2-
2ACOS~ + 1. 
We require that 5 
assumes 
an 
integral 
representation 
therefore, 
it 
follows 
from theorem 5.2 that the coeffi-
cients of the characteristic polynom have to be integers. 
We calculate the trace of 5+ and 
set 
integer p. 
trCS+) = 2cos~ = p.

an 
From 
this equation follow the allowed rotation angles ~ 
for the crystallographic rotations in the 
plane 
E2. 
The 
results are shown in Table 5.1.

5.3. 
Rotations in En 
The procedure described in section 5.2. can 
be 
applied 
to 
spaces 
of 
any finite dimension. 
In order to get an 
insight into the rotations in En the theorem 
of 
5chlafli 
(5chI2) is of importance. 
Theorem 
5.3: 
Every rotation 5 in En can be represented 
through rotations in a set of mutually 
perpendic-
ular one- and two-dimensional subspaces. 
Proof: 
The 
following 
proof 
is due to Buser (Buse1). In 
order to show that En, under the action 
of 
5, 
splits 
into invariant one- or two-dimensional subspaces we use 
the property that a point x on the unit sphere covers a 
minimal 
distance 
under 
the 
rotation 
5 
if 
it 
is 
contained in an invariant subspace. We 
choose 
a 
unit 
vector 
x~En for which the angle ~:=~(1,5x) is minimal. 
If ~=Oo or ~=1800 then x determines 
a 
one-dimensional 
invariant subspace UCEn. We take the orthogonal comple-
ment 
E~ and determine again a vector 1~E~ such that the 
angle 
~:=~(x,51) is minimal. 
Suppose now that ~iOo or 
~i1800. We have to 
show that x and 51 span an 
invari-
ant 
two-dimensional 
subspace 
U'. 
We take any other 
unit 
vector 
y~U' 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure 
5.1. 
Let 
~':=~(y,5y) be the angle between y and 5Y. Because 5 is 
an 
isometry 
it follows that o:=~{x,y) =~(5x,5Y). If y 
lies between x and 
5x 
then 
the 
triangle 
inequality 
implies 
As 
~ is minimal 
has to lie in the 
lie 
between 
x 
~':=1800-~', and 
then implies 
it follows that ~'=~ and therefore, 5y 
subspace U'. Otherwise if y does 
not 
and 
51 
then 
we 
take 
~:=1800-~, 
0:=180 0-0. 
The 
triangle 
inequality 
As 
~ is now maximal it follows that ~'=~ and therefore, 
5Y~U'. 
Hence, 
U'CE~ is an invariant subspace. 
Repeat-
ing this step we see that En can be 
completely 
decom-
posed. 
The 
two-dimensional 
invariant 
subspaces 
were 
called 
principal planes by 5chlafli. 

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC SYMMETRY OPERA TrONS 
73 
Figure 5.1 
Referred to a cartesian coordinate system assumed within 
these invariant subspaces the matrix representation 
rotation 5 has a block-diagonal structure: 
S 
: = 
o 
of 
a 
where 
Ih' 
Ik 
are identity matrices of dimension hand k 
respectively and 5 i , i=1, .•. ,m, is a 
proper 
rotation 
of 
the form 
COS<Pi -sin<pi 
sin<pi 
cos<p; 
Each 
Si 
represents 
in the principal plane ni a rotation 
through the angle <Pi. 
The decomposition of En into 
principal 
planes 
is 
not 
unique. 
If two or more among the angles <Pi are equal then 
the linear combination of any two vectors 
in 
the 
corre-
sponding 
principal 
planes 
is 
again an invariant plane. 
However, the parts Ih' -I k are unique and the 
correspond-
ing subspaces are mutually orthogonal and both are orthog-
onal to the principal planes ni. 

74 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
For 
the 
determination of those rotations which leave a 
lattice Tn invariant we have to introduce the 
concept 
of 
~-irreducible matrices. 
The 
rotations 
sm, 
m=1, .•• ,k, 
are represented through 
unimodular 
nxn 
matrices. 
These 
matrices 
are 
called 
~-reducible if 
every matrix sm can be represented in the 
same 
block-diagonal 
form, 
where 
all 
submatrices 
WI' 
i=1, ••• ,v, 
are 
unimodular with integer coefficients, and 
the remaining coefficients outside 
of 
these 
blocks 
are 
zero. 
o 
, m=1, ... , k. 
o 
Each 
submatrix 
WI' 
i=1, ... ,v, 
maps the corresponding 
sublattice T; of dimension n; onto itself. We require that 
these submatrices have integer 
coefficients 
hence, 
they 
are referred to a lattice basis. 
If 
no such representation exists simultaneously for all 
rotation matrices sm, m=1, •.. ,k, then these 
matrices 
are 
called 
~-irreducible. 
~-irreducible matrices 
map the 
lattice Tn onto itself 
and 
leave 
no 
proper 
sublattice 
invariant. 
Example 
5.1: 
All 
matrices representing the rotations of 
order k=3 in the lattice T3 can 
be 
brought 
into 
the 
following ~-reduced form:

this

the

TJ is decomposed into two 
mutual orthogonal invariant sublattices

dimensions 
two and one respectively.

the rotations of order k=5 are ~-irreducible.

In 
this 
case 
there exists no sublattice T'C T4 which 
remains invariant. 
We note that in general, the 
prin-
cipal planes are not lattice planes. 
For 
a given lattice Tn the allowed orders of a crystal-
lographic rotation S are given by 
the 
following 
theorem 
due to Hermann (Herm3): 
Theorem 5.4: 
A rotation S of order k with integral matrix 
representation 
exists 
only 
in 
a 
lattice Tn of 
dimension n~~(k). 
Proof: 
Assume 
that 
the 
representation 
~-irreducible. 
Then 
the rotation angles 
the form 
~; :=2rrl;/k. By theorem 5.2, 
the 
of the characteristic polynom 
of 
Sis 
~; are all of 
coefficients 
have 
to 
be integers. From analysis it is known that a 
solution only exists if n=~(k). 
The number-theoretic Euler totient function 
~(k) 
gives 
the 
number 
of integers less than and relatively prime to 
k. 
An 
integer 
is 
called 
relatively prime 
to 
k 
if 
gcdCi,k)=1. 
Alternatively, if 
k 
is 
decomposed 
into 
a 
product of prime factors 
then 
~Ck) := kIT (1-1/Pf)' 
p I I k 
where the product extends over all different proper 
prime 
factors P1lk of k (for a proof see Hil11). 

76 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
The trace of S, 
tr(S) = 2cos2rrl1/k + ... + 2cos2rrls/k, s:=in, 
must 
be 
integral. 
This 
is fulfilled if the Ii are less 
than k/2 and are 
relatively 
prime 
to 
k. 
There 
exists 
exactly 
s 
such 
integers (using k-l, instead of I, gives 
the same rotation because no absolute orientation 
of 
the 
space is assumed), Therefore, the integers I; are uniquely 
determined for a crystallographic symmetry operation. 
The 
formula for the Euler totient function reveals that 
it assumes even values if k>2. From this another 
theorem, 
due to Schlafli (Schl2), follows: 
Theorem 
5.5: 
The 
representations 
of crystallographic 
Proof: 
only 
rotations S, which 
leave 
a 
lattice 
Tn 
of 
odd 
dimension n>1 invariant, are ~-reducible. 
For 
k>2 the Euler totient function '\IICk»O assumes 
even values. This proves the theorem 5.5.

The chirality of a rotation in En (cf. section

Let the matrix representation of a crystal-
lographic rotation S be Z-reduced. 
Then 
if 
the 
number of submatrices of order 2 is even the rota-
tion 
S 
is 
a proper rotation. otherwise it is an 
improper rotation. 
Proof: By assumption the matrix 
representation 
of 
S 
is 
Z-reduced. The determinant deteS) is the product of the 
determinants 
of 
the 
individual 
submatrices 
in each 
block. Z-irreducible submatrices of even dimension 
n>1 
always 
represent proper rotations with positive deter-
minant. The 
one-dimensional 
submatrices 
representing 
rotations of order 2 have negative determinant. 
This 
allows 
us 
to 
find 
the allowed crystallographic 
rotations in lattices Tn of any finite 
dimension. 
First, 
all 
different 
decompositions 
of 
Tn into sublattices Tt 
with dimensions n, are determined where all n,>1 are even. 
Second, from Table 5.3 we find, for every 
sublattice 
Tt, 
the 
allowed orders of the rotation matrices. The order of 
the rotation S is then the smallest common multiple of the 
orders of all its submatrices. In Table 5.4 are shown 
the 
permissible 
rotations 
of the three-dimensional lattices. 
Each rotation is represented with respect to 
its sublat-
tice 
decomposition. 
The rotations are arranged according 
to their orders k. Each small box represents a sublattice. 
The dimension n; for each sublattice 
is 
not 
explicitely 
stated 
but 
with 
the 
help of Table 5.2 it can easily be 
deduced from the order of the submatrices WI given in each 

7R 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
box. If the rotation order 2 occurs in an 
odd 
number 
of 
times the rotation is an improper rotation. This is marked 
with 
an "I" in Tables 5.4 to 5.6. 
We note that in spaces 
of odd 
dimension 
the 
numbers 
of 
proper 
and 
improper 
rotations are equal.

In three-dimensional space the 
improper 
rotations 
may 
either be visualized as rotoreflections or else as rotoin-
versions. 
The 
rotoreflection Sk is a rotation with rota-
tion angle ~= 360 o/k followed by a reflection in a 
mirror 
plane 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
rotation 
axis. This is the 
appropriate description of the improper rotation if We

inversion 
center. Both notations are contrasted in Table 5.5.

Example 5.2: The rotation ~ 
of 
order 
12 
leaves 
two 
two-dimensional 
sublattices 
invariant. 
This rotation 
can be visualized as a rotation by 90 0 in 
one 
sUblat-
tice 
and 
a simultaneous rotation by 120 0 in the other 
sUblattice. Because both rotation angles are 
different 
the sublattices are mutual orthogonal. The rotation DO 
of 
order 5 leaves no sublattice invariant. However, we 
may visualize the rotation in the two principal planes. 
An integral matrix representation of this rotation 
was 
given in Example 5.1. 
From 
representation theory it is known that for a group 
H a projection operator 
P y 
which 
projects 
the 
lattice 
basis a1' ... ,a n 
into 
the principal plane ~y is obtained 
through the formula:

Therefore,

lattice points. Only for rotations of order 3, 4. 
the principal planes are sublattices too. 
Referred to a cartesian coordiante system within 
the 
principal 
planes. 
the 
rotation 
of

The 
rotation 
may 
be 
visualized 
by two simultaneous 
rotations in two mutual 
orthogonal 
principal 
planes. 
The 
first principal plane is rotated in itself through 
the angle of 72° leaving 
the 
second 
principal 
plane 
invariant. 
The 
second 
principal 
plane is rotated in 
itself through the angle 
of 
144 0 
leaving 
the 
first 
principal 
plane 
invariant. 
Only 
after repeating the 
rotation five times is 
the 
original 
status 
of 
both 
principal planes restored. 
5.4. 
Symmetry support 
A 
rotation 
S in En leaves at least the origin 0 fixed. 
We obtain the set of 
all 
fixed 
points 
of 
S 
from 
the 
following equation, 
This equation is written in the form 
(S-I)x = O. 
The 
solutions 
of this equation form a subspace UCEn of 
dimension d=n-m, where m is the rank of the matrix 
(S-I). 
OnlY for the identity I, d=n holds. 
Definition 
5.2: 
The subspace U which remains fixed under 
the action of the rotation S is called the 
symme-
try support of S. 
The 
symmetry 
support together with the coefficients of 
the characteristic polynom are important invariants 
which 
help to identify symmetry operations. 
In 
what follows we give a practical method to calculate 
the symmetry support of S. 
We set A:=S-I. 
The 
equation 
Ax=O can be written in form of a scheme as follows: 
/.t1 

82

If a;j~O then 
~; can be exchanged by ~j using the

Hence, the symmetry 
support of 5 is the rotation axis [1,1,-1). 
5.5. 
General symmetry operations in En 
We now consider the general symmetry operation (5,5) 
in 
En. 
The shift vector 5 depends on the choice of origin O. 
Suppose that O':=O+v is an alternative origin. 
We 
calcu-
late the transformation of (5,5) under a change of origin. 
The symmetry operation (S,s) carries the point x into y, 
y = (5,s)x. 
In 
reference 
to 
the new origin 0', the coordinates of 
the point x transform according to 
x= x'+v. 
and therefore, 
y'= Sx'+Sv-v+s = (5,5v-v+s)x'. 
Thus the shift vector 5', referred to the new 
origin 
0', 
is 
5'= Sv-v+s. 
In 
what 
follows we determine properties of (S,s) which 
are independent of the choice of origin. 
Let k be the order of S. In section 
5.1 
we 
calculated 
the screw vector 
t:= 5 k - 1 s+ ••• +55+5. 
Theorem 
5.7: 
The 
screw 
vector t is invariant under a 
change of origin. 
Proof: In reference to a 
new 
origin 
O':=O+v 
the 
shift 
vector 5 is transformed according to 
5'= 5v-v+s. 
We 
calculate 
the 
screw vector t' with respect to the 
new origin 0', 

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC SYMMETRY OPERATIONS 
85 
= 5 k - 1 S+ ... +55+5 = t. 
Thus t has the required property. 
By theorem 5.1, the rotat i on part 5 of a crys,ta!lograph-
ic symmetry operation has an integral 
representation, 
if 
referred 
to a lattic basis. 
In the following theorem the 
corresponding 
restriction 
for 
the 
shift 
vector 
5 
is 
revealed. 
Theorem 
5.8: 
If 
k is the order of the rotation S of a 
crystallographic 
symmetry 
operation 
(5,5) 
then 
there 
exists a representation of (5,5) in En such 
that the shift vector 5 
has 
rational 
components 
with denominator k. 
Proof: 
By 
theorem 3.1. the rotation S generates a cyclic 
group of finite order. Let the 
d-dimensional 
subspace 
UCEn, 
O~d<n, 
be 
the 
symmetry 
support 
of S. We can 
decompose En into U and its orthogonal 
complement 
U~. 
With 
respect 
to 
U 
and 
U~ the shift vector 5 has a 
unique decomposition 
where S° and s~ are the 
orthogonal 
projections 
of 
5 
into U and U~ respectively. 
Referred to this decompos-
ition 
the 
rotation 
5 
has a representation in block-
diagonal form 
lId 0 I 
o 
S~. 
We determine the fixed 
point 
p~~U~ of 
the 
symmetry 
operation (5~,s~) by setting 
It follows that 
By 
construction 
of 
U~ the 
rank 
of (I-S~) is m=n-d 
therefore, this equation has a unique solution 

86 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
We 
now 
choose 
the 
alternative origin 0' :=O+P~. With 
respect to the new 
origin 
the 
shift 
vector 
s=s"+s~ 
becomes 
Therefore, 
the 
symmetry operation (S,s') with respect 
to the new origin 0' is 
(S,s')= (S,s"). 
Because 5" remains fixed under the rotation 5 the screw 
vector t' is, 
t'= ks". 
It follows that 5"= t'/k. 
By 
left 
multiplication 
of 
(5,5") with an appropriate translation, (I,V)(S,s"), we 
can always find a symmetry operation (5,1") where 
The following definition generalizes the definition 5.2. 
Let U be the symmetry support of the rotation 5 and U~ its 
orthogonal 
complement. 
With 
respect to U and U~ we have 
the 
following 
decomposition 
of 
the 
representation 
of 
(5,5) , 
lId 0 
J 15"1 
o 
5~, s~ . 
With p~ we designate the fixed point of the symmetry oper-
ation (S~,s~) in U~. 
Definition 
5.3: 
The 
coset p~+U is called the symmetry 
support of the symmetry operation (5,5). 
Definition 5.4: 
If the screw vector t=O then the symmetry 
operation (5,5) is called a rotation or, if d=n-1, 
a reflection. If t¢O then (S,s) is called a 
screw 
rotation or, if d=n-1, a glide reflection. 
We give in the following a practical method to calculate 
the 
symmetry 
support 
of 
a 
general 
symmetry operation

Let 
k 
be the order of the rotation S. 
vector t is given by 
The screw 
t:=Sk-1 S+ ... +Ss+s. 
If t=O then (S,s) has at least one fixed point. 
Otherwise 
if 
t¢O 
then 
(S,s-t/k) 
has at least one fixed point. In 
order to calculate the fixe~ points we set 
It follows that 
We set A:=I-S and v:=-s+t/k. Thus we have 
Aihv=O. 
We use the method of section 5.4 to solve 
this 
equation.

support of (S,s) then is the coset 1 1 +u. 

6. Crystallographic Point Groups 
We now use 
the 
important 
concept 
of 
a 
mathematical 
group. The group elements are the symmetry operations. The 
group 
multiplication is the composition of symmetry oper-
ations as described in section 1.4. 
6.1. 
Definitions 
Let X C En be a regular point system

If P is a 
theorem 
Theorem 
6.1: 
The symmetry operations (5,5) of a subgroup 
P of G of finite order have a common 
fixed 
point 
z. 
Proof: 
Let 
h 
be 
the 
order of P. As 
~ is finite Pacts 
transitively only on a 
finite 
subset 
M of 
X. 
It 
follows 
that 
M is bounded and can be enclosed inside 
some ball of radius L. The centroid z of M is given by 
Z:=~1:Xi' 
x ;E.":M 
The centroid z remains invariant under the action of 
P 
because 
every 
symmetry 
operation. (5,s)E.":P 
merely 
permutes the points x;E.":M, 
(5,s)z = ~ 1: (5,s)x; = z. 
x ;E.":M 
Hence, the centroid z has the required property. 
Clearly the fixed point z need not belong to the regular 
point system X. We can assume that the origin 0 is in 
the 
fixed point z. In reference to this origin, 
~very symmetry 
operation 
of 
P 
must have the form 45,0) sihce otherwise 
the origin 0 would not remain fixed. In 
what 
follows 
we 
always assume the origin to be in the fixed point z and we 
only 
consider 
the rotation part 5 of the symmetry opera-
tion. 
By definition 1.2, a group of symmetry operations 
which 
leaves at least one point fixed is called a point group. 
89

GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Definition 6.1: 
A crystallographic point group in En is a 
group of symmetry operations which brings a trans-
lation lattice Tn into self-coincidence and leaves 
at least one point fixed. 
By theorem 3.1. the crystallographic 
point 
groups 
are 
groups of finite order. 
For each rotation S; of a point group P we can determine 
the 
symmetry 
support 
U; 
(cf. 
section 
5.4). 
Several 
rotations St~P may have identical symmetry supports. 
We 
take the weighted union of all UtI 
M': = U Ut. 
S; ~P 
Weighted 
means 
that 
for 
each subspace UCM' a weight is 
assigned which counts the number of occurrences of identi-
cal symmetry supports. If the symmetry support U occurs 
k 
times then we say that U is a k-fold symmetry support. 
Definition 6.2: 
The symmetry scaffolding of a point group 
P 
is 
the weigthed union of the symmetry supports 
of all symmetry operations S~P. 
In crystallography the term "symmetry element" 
is 
used 
for 
the 
symmetry scaffolding of a cyclic group. We avoid 
this 
term 
because 
of 
its 
confusion 
with 
the 
group 
elements. 
We 
note that the symmetry support of a point group P is 
the intersection of the symmetry supports of all 
symmetry 
operations S~P. 
We 
represent 
the rotation S in En through a unimodular 
nxn matrix which carries the point x into y. 
y = Sx. 
In this way a point group P 
is 
represented 
through 
a 
matrix group. The coefficients of these matrices depend on 
the 
choice 
of the basis vectors. If a11 ...• a~ is another 
choice with 
= 

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC POINT GROUPS 
91 
where A is a non-singular nxn matrix, then the coordinates 
of the point x' referred to the new basis are 
transformed 
with the contragredient matrix AO, 
The 
rotation 
matrix 
S, referred 
to 
the new basis,is 
transformed according to (cf. section 3.2) 
Because of physical reasons we require 
that 
det(A)=+1. 
The 
transformation 
A thus conserves the chirality of the 
basis. We say that S' and S are equivalent representations 
of one and the same symmetry operation. 
This 
transforma-
tion 
is 
applied 
to 
all symmetry operations S~P. We say 
that A transforms Ponto P' and we write 
We have to emphasize that every symmetry operation 
maps 
En 
onto 
itself through its matrix representation. There-
fore, equivalence of symmetry groups 
corresponds 
to 
the 
equivalence 
of their matrix representations. This distin-
guishes symmetry groups from abstract groups (cf. 
section 
6.6). 
Definition 
6.3: 
Two point groups P and P' are equivalent 
and belong to the same geometric 
class 
if 
there 
exists 
a 
non-singular matrix W that transforms P 
onto P', 
P' = WPW-1. 
Synonymous to geometric class ~-class is used. 
An important property 
of 
equivalent 
point 
groups 
is 
stated in the following theorem. 
Theorem 
6.2: 
If two point groups P and P' are equivalent 
then they are orthogonal equivalent, 
Proof: We use the fact that every 
non-singular 
matrix 
W 
can 
be written as a product W=RC, where R is an isome-
try and C is a positive-definte quadratic form 
(for 
a 
proof see Burc2). It follows that for every S~P we have

From the condition that C=stcs 
follows that SOC=CS hence,

it 
This 
is 
true for every S~P hence we have the required 
property. 
P= RPR-1. 
Theorem 6.3: 
Equivalent 
point 
groups 
have 
congruent 
symmetry scaffoldings. 
Proof: 
By 
theorem 
6.2, 
that P'= RPR-1 holds. 
So then we have 
there exists an isometry R such 
If U is the symmetry 
support 
of 
It follows that 
S'RU=RU 
hence, 
RU 
is the symmetry support of 5'. Because R is 
an isometry the theorem 6.3 follows. 
The above theorem 6.3 reveals that 
the 
symmetry 
scaf-
folding can be used to identify point groups. 
A 
group 
of finite order is completely specified by its 
multiplication table. 
In general however, 
a 
few 
group 
elements are sufficient to generate the whole group. 
Definition 
6.4: 
A set M of symmetry operations is called 
a generating set of the point 
group 
P 
if 
every 
symmetry 
operation 
of 
P 
can 
be 
obtained as a 
product of symmetry operations of M. 
Point groups may contain proper 
and

Definition 6.5: 
Point groups of the first kind are groups 
which 
contain 
only 
proper 
symmetry operations. 
Point groups of the second kind are 
groups 
which 
also contain improper symmetry operations.

Theorem 
6.4: 
Every 
point 
group 
P of the second kind 
contains a point group P+ of the first kind 
as 
a 
normal subgroup of index 2. 
Proof: Every point group of the second kind contains prop-
er 
rotations 
because 
the 
product 
of 
two 
improper 
rotations is a proper rotation. 
The 
proper 
rotations 
form 
a 
subgroup 
of the first kind. 
For any improper 
rotation S-~P it 
holds 
that 
S-P=P. 
Therefore, 
the 
numbers of proper and improper rotations must be equal. 
It follows that P+ is of index 2 hence, it is normal in 
P. 
6.2. 
Point groups in E2 
We 
use 
the 
Schonflies notation to designate the point 
groups. 
In 2-dimensional space E2 the proper rotation 
S+ 
generates 
the 
cyclic 
group 
Ck' 
where 
"C" 
stands for 
"cyclic" and the subscript k gives the order 
of 
S+ 
(for 
point groups in E2 we use the symbols of the 2+1 reducible 
point groups in El). 
The cyclic group Ck is a point group 
of the first kind. 
Next 
we 
include the reflection and construct the point 
groups of the second kind. Let S- represent the reflection 
in a 
mirro~ line m. 
The 
reflection 
S-
generates 
the 
cyclic 
group Cs of order IC s l=2. The subscript "s" stands 
for the german word "Spiegel" (mirror). A point 
group 
of 
the 
first 
kind 
Ck may be combined with S- to give a new 
group P of the second kind. The reflection S-
necessarily 
must 
leave 
the 
origin 
fixed but otherwise there are no 
restrictions in E2. 
By theorem 6.4, the cyclic 
group 
Ck 
is 
a 
subgroup 
of 
P of index 2. The coset decomposition 
becomes 
The 
symmetry 
operations 
of 
the 
coset 
CkS-
are 
reflections. 
Each coset has the same number of symmetry 
operations hence, the 
order 
of 
the 
point 
group 
P 
is 
IPI=2k. 
Let ~=360o/k be the angle of rotation of S+. Then 
the symmetry support of 5+5-
is a mirror line 
m' 
rotated 
through 
the angle ~/2 out of the first mirror line m. The 
successive reflections in both mirror lines correspond 
to 
a proper rotation with rotation aogle ~,

The

Among all point groups in E2 we now determine the 
crys-

point 
groups and we classify them according 
to the geometric crystal classes. 
By 
theorem 
5.4, 
only 
rotations of orders 2,3,4, and 6 respectively are crystal-
lographic 
rotations 
in E2. It follows that there are ten 
non-equivalent geometric crystal classes in the 
plane 
E2 
which are shown in Figure 6.1.

The 
cyclic 
group generated by S+ has order ICkl=k. The 
symmetry scaffolding of Ck is 
called 
a 
k-fold 
rotation 
axis (cf. section 5.4). 
In 
order 
to derive all point groups in E3 we determine 
first the point groups 
of 
the 
first 
kind. 
Two 
cyclic 
groups Ck and Cl may be combined to give a new point group 
P+ 
of 
the 
first 
kind. 
Let Q+ and R+ be the generating 
rotations of Ck and Cl respectively and let A, 
B 
be 
the 
corresponding 
rotation 
axes. 
By theorem 6.1, the point 
group P+ has at least one 
f~xed point z which we assume to 
be the origin. It follows that the rotation axes A 
and 
B 
must 
have the origin 0 in common. If A is not parallel to 
B then A intersects B in 0 and P+ has 
exactly 
one 
fixed 
point. 
The possible combinations of intersecting rotation 
axes are obtained through the following construction which 
is due to Euler. 
By 
the group property we have that Q+R+=S+. The result-
ing rotation S+ has order m 
and 
rotation 
axis 
C 
which 
recessarily 
must 
go through the origin O. 
The action of 
the three rotations on a point x can be 
obtained 
through 
successive 
reflections 
in 
three 
mirror planes each one 
containing two of the rotation axes as can 
be 
seen 
from 
Figure 6.2.

The 
various 
types of point groups of the first kind as 
they result from Table 6.1 are illustrated in Figures 6.3, 
a)-d)' They are: 
a) The dihedral group Dk of 
all 
proper 
rotations 
of 
a 
regular k-faced prism. 
b) The 
tetrahedral group T of all proper rotations of the 
regular tetrahedron. 
c) The octahedral group a of all proper rotations 
of 
the 
regular octahedron. 
d) The 
icosahedral group I of all proper rotations of the 
regular icosahedron. 
e) For non-integral values of k.l. or m the group K of all 
proper rotations of the sphere results. This group 
has 
infinite order. 
The tetrahedron. octahedron. and icosahedron 
are 
three 
among 
the 
five Platonic solids. 
Two of them have a dual

counterpart. The octahedron is dual to the cube hence, its 
group of proper rotations is also o. 
The 
icosahedron 
is 
dual to the dodecahedron. 
We 
now 
determine 
the point groups of the.second kind. 
By theorem 6.4, a point group P of the.second ~ind 
has 
a 
point 
group 
P+ of the first kind as a normal subgroup of 
index 2. The coset decomposition becomes: 
P = P+ u p+s-. 

98 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
As a representative S-
we choose 
the 
reflection 
in 
a 
mirror 
plane m. 
Necessarily m contains the origin o. The 
reflection S- generates the cyclic group Cs of order 2. 
Because P+ is a normal subgroup of P we have to 
require 
that S-
leaves P+ invariant. 
Geometrically 
this 
means that S-
maps the symmetry scaf-
folding of P+ onto itself. It follows that there are 
only 
a few non-equivalent possibilities to add a mirror plane m 
to the symmetry scaffolding of P+. 
We take the cyclic group Ck. The k-fold rotation axis is 
assumed to be vertical. 
There exist two possible settings 
of 
m. Either it can be perpendicular two the k-fold rota-
tion axis. In this case it is called a "horizontal" mirror 
plane mho The point group Ckh results. Or it 
can 
contain 
the 
k-fold 
rotation axis. It is then called a "vertical" 
mirror plane my. The point group Cky results. If S+ is the 
generating rotation of Ck then 
the 
symmetry 
support 
of 
5+S-
is 
the mirror plane m~ which is rotated through the 
angle 180 o /k out of the mirror plane my. 
We take the dihedral group Ok. The k-fold rotation 
axis 
is assumed to be vertical. 
Either we can add a horizontal 
mirror 
plane mho The point group Okh results. Because the 
twofold rotation axes 
are 
prependicular 
to 
the 
k-fold 
rotation axis also vertical mirror planes my are generated 
which intersect mh along the twofold axes. Or we can add a 
mirror 
plane 
md 
which contains the k-fold rotation axis 
and which bisects the angle between two 
adjacent 
twofold 
rotation axes. Thus the mirror plane md is "diagonal" with 
respect 
to the twofold rotation axes. The point group Dkd 
results. 
The tetrahedral group T is set up with a 
twofold 
rota-
tion 
axis vertical. Either we can add a horizontal mirror 
plane mh perpendicular to 
the 
twofold 
axis. 
The 
point 
group 
Th results. 
Or we can add a mirror plane md which 
contains a threefold axis and which 
is 
diagonal 
to 
two 
adjacent twofold axes. The point group Td results. 
The 
octahedral 
group 
0 is set up with a fourfold axis 
vertical. We can add a horizontal mirror plane mh 
perpen-
dicular 
to the fourfold axis. The point group Oh results. 
The other possibilities are equivalent and do not give new 
groups. 

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC POINT GROUPS 
99 
The icosahedral group 1 is set up with 
a 
twofold 
axis 
vertical. 
We can add a horizontal mirror plane mh perpen-
dicular to the twofold axis. The point group 
Ih 
results. 
There is no other possibility. 
To 
the 
group 
K of all proper rotations of a sphere we 
can add a mirror plane of arbitrary orientation 
which 
we 
call mho The point group Kh results. 
Finally 
we 
have to consider the general rotoreflection 
5-
(cf. section 5.4). 
A possible representation is: 
5 - : = 
cos2rr/k -sin2rr/k 
sin2rr/k 
o 
cos2rr/k 
o 
o 
o 
-1 
The rotoreflection 5- generates a cyclic point group Sk' 
For k=2 the rotoreflection S-
is the 
central 
inversion 
-1. It generates the cyclic group C; of order 2 represent-
ing a center of symmetry. 
For 
k=4m+2, 
mE:IN, 
the cyclic group Sk can be generated 
through the cyclic group Cl of order l=k/2 and the central 
inversion -I. Thus Sk=Cl;' if k=4m+2. 
If k is odd then Sk can be generated through the 
cyclic 
group Ck and a reflection in a horizontal mirror plane mho 
Thus Sk=Ckh' if k is odd. 
Only if k=4m then Sk cannot be generated by other cyclic 
groups.

There 
exists 
an 
infinite number of point groups in E3 
yet, these may be grouped into a few series as is shown in 
the flow chart of Table 6.2 which helps to 
determine 
the 
pOint 
groups 
in E3. 
This flow chart uses the concept of 
generating symmetry operations and therefore, only 
a 
few 
steps 
are necessary to completely determine a point group 
in E 3. 
Among all point groups in E3 we now determine the 
crys-
tallographic 
point 
groups and we classify them according 
to the geometric crystal classes. In E3 we have 
the 
same 
orders 
of 
rotations as in E2, viz.: 2,3,4, and 6 respec-
tively. This criterion is sufficient to 
characterize 
the 
crystallographic point groups in E3. 
Among 
the 
cyclic 
point 
groups 
we 
find 
the following 
geometric crystal classes: 
and, if we add a mirror plane, we get in addition 
Among the dihedral point 
groups 
we 
have 
the 
following 
geometric crystal classes: 
We 
note 
that D4d and Dbd have rotoreflections of order 8 
and 12 respectively therefore, 
they 
are 
not 
crystallo-
graphic. 
The 
tetrahedral and octahedral point groups belong to the 
geometric crystal classes: 
Altogether there exist 32 geometric crystal 
classes 
in 
El. The relation between these crystal classes can be seen 
from the group-subgroup diagram in Figure 6.4. 
Alternatively 
to 
the 
Schonflies 
notation 
for 
point 
groups also the 
international 
notation 
of 
Hermann 
and 
Mauguin is used (for details the reader is referred to the 
International 
Tables, 
Vol. 
A, 
Hahn1l. 
Both 
kinds 
of 
symbols have in common that they specify for each 
geomet-
ric crystal class a set of generating symmetry operations.

Point groups in En 
In 
spaces of higher dimensions the point groups may not 
as easily be visualized as in two-
and 
three-dimensional 
space. 
In what follows we present a geometric derivation 
of the point groups in En. 
By theorem 5.3, every proper rotation S+ in 
En 
can 
be 
represented through rotations in a set of mutually perpen-
jicular 
principal 
planes 
~1' ••• '~m 
with 
rotations 
P1' ••. '~m respectively

subspaces.

In section 6.2 we had replaced S+ through the successive 
reflection in two mirror lines m and m'. In 
an 
analogous 
way we now replace ',U1 by two successive involutions Z1 and 
Z2 
which we construct in the following way (an involution 
is a symmetry operation of order 2). We 
choose 
in 
~1 
a 
vector 
of 
unit 
length which we call the root vector r1. 
The involution Z1 is determined in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
leaves 
r1 
fixed and inverts the orthogonal complement U~ 
of r1 in En. 
We are free to choose r1=e1' The 
involution 
Z1 
is 
then 
represented through a diagonal matrix of the 
following form, 
1

For the involution Z2 we determine the root 
vector

such 
a way that the angle ~(r1,r2) is ',U1/2. By conju-
gation of Z1 with

In 
a 
similar 
way 
the remaining rotations ~2' ... '~m are 
replaced by involutions. As a result we have that 
S+ 
can 
be written as a product of 2m involutions, 
By 
the

Let Q+, R+ be generating rotations of a point group P+ 
of 
finite order. 
We denote by rr1i' rr2i' rr3i' i=1, ... ,h~m the 
principal 
planes 
of Q+, R+, S+, and by ~1i' ~2i' ~3i the 
cprresponding rotation angles. If Q+ and R+ have identical 
principal planes then so does S+. We now 
assume 
that 
Q+ 
and R+ have different principal planes. 
Two cases have to 
be considered. 
1. 
The 
principal 
planes 
intersect in straight lines. 
Assume that rr11 and rr21 intersect in a straight 
line. 
We 
are free to choose rr11nrr21=Ar1. Thus the root vector r1 is 
common 
to 
both 
principal 
planes. 
The 
other 
two root 
vectors r2£rr11 and r3£rr21 are now determined by the angles 
~11/2 and ~21/2 respectively. 
Let Z1' 
Z2' and Z3 be 
the 
corresponding involutions. From Q+R+=S+ it follows that 
hence, 
r2 
and 
r3 
determine the principal plane rr31. We 
have that rr11nrr31=Ar2 and rr21nrr31=Ar3. The 
carrier 
space 
of "11' rr21' and "31 is a 
t~ree-dimensional subspace UCEn. 
Let 
5 n - 1 
be 
the 
unit 
sphere 
in 
En 
(it 
is 
the 
(n-1)-dimensional surface of the 
unit 
ball 
in 
En). 
It 
follows 
that 
Uns n - 1 =s2. Thus the involutions Z1' Z2' and 
23 leave a sphere S2 invariant and therefore, they have to 
belong either to the dihedral (D), tetrahedral (T), 
octa-
hedral 
(0), 
or 
icosahedral (I) point group. 
It follows 
that the angles ~(r\lrj)' i,j=1,2,3, i<j, must 
have 
well 
defined values. 

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC POINT GROUPS 
105 
We 
now 
look at the second set of principal planes rr12' 
rr22' rr32 which are orthogonal to rr11' rr21' and rr31 respec-
tively. Let U~ be the orthogonal complement of U. 
There 
exists 
a 
unique vector p~U orthogonal to rr12' It follows 
that rr12 intersects 
U~ at 
least 
in 
a 
one-dimensional 
subspace. 
The 
same 
holds 
for 
rr22 
and 
rr32' 
We have 
rr12nrr22=Ar4' rr12nrr32=ArS' and rr22nrr32=Ar6' At least one of 
these principal planes has to be a subspace of U~ because 
otherwise 
at 
least two of the root vectors r4' r5' or r6 
are not contained in U~ and therefore, one of these 
prin-
cipal 
planes 
does 
not intersect U~ in a one-dimensional 
subspace which is a contradiction. 
It 
follows 
that 
the 
carrier 
space of r1, ... ,r6 is at least a five dimensional 
subspace of En. In a similar way we can 
account 
for 
the 
remaining 
principal 
planes. The distribution of the root 
vectors 
r; 
on 
the 
sphere 
sn-1 
gives 
the 
necessary 
restrictions 
for 
possible 
point groups of finite order. 
We have to require that 
always 
k 
of 
the 
corresponding 
involutions Z; leave a sphere Sk-1 invariant. 
2. 
The 
principal 
planes intersect only in the origin. 
This can occur if two or more principal planes 
rr1; 
of 
a 
rotation 
Q+ 
have a congruent system of foot vectors. 
In 
this case there exists an involution Y which 
interchanges 
these 
principal 
planes. 
Assume Y interchanges rr11 with 
rr12 then, referred to a cartesian coordinate system within 
these principal planes, the 
involution 
Y 
may 
have 
the 
following form

In 
Among 
all point groups P in En we have to determine the 
crystallographic point groups. 
The following two criteria 
can be used to decide if a point group is 
crystallograph-
i c: 
1. Every 
rotation 
section 5.3), 
S~P 
has 
to 
be crystallographic (cf. 
2. A crystallographic point group cannot 
contain 
involu-
tions 
Z; 
which 
are 
in 
principal planes of rotation 
orders h=5, or h>6. 
Example 6.1: We now give some examples of point groups 
in 
four-dimensional 
space E4. 
Assume that the principal 

106 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
planes 
~11' 
~21' 
and 
~l1 
intersect, 
~11n~21=Ar1' 
~11n~31=Ar2 
and 
~21n~31=Arl' 
The root vectors r1' r2 
and rl span a three-dimensional carrier space UCE4. The 
corresponding involutions are Z1' Z2 and Zl respective-
ly. Let AP be the orthogonal complement of U in E4. 
It 
follows 
that in E4 at most one of the rotations Q+, R+ 
and 5+ 
can 
have 
a 
second 
principal 
plane 
because 
suppose 
two of them have a second principal plane then 
these necessarily intersect in 
AP. 
Hence, 
a 
further 
principal 
plane 
would 
exist which does not contain P 
which is a contradiction. Assume 
that 
the 
additional 
principal 
plane 
is 
~12' 
We 
have 
two 
further root 
vectors r4 and r5 in ~12 with involutions 
Z4 
and 
Z5. 
The 
root 
vectors 
r1, ... ,rs 
determine 
two 
adjacent 
spherical tetrahedra on the sphere 5 l . We 
now 
require 
that 
always three of these involutions Z1' •.• ,2 5 leave 
a sphere 52 invariant. Therefore, 
the 
angles 
between 
these root vectors must correspond to the angles in the 
point 
groups 
D, 
T, 
0, or I. Always four among these 
involutions leave a sphere 5 l invariant. Thus they 
are 
generators 
of 
a point group in E4. Possible solutions 
are shown in Figures 6.5, a)-d) which show the distrib-
ution of the root vectors on the sphere 5 l • 
The inter-
section of the root vectors r;, i=1, ... ,5, with 53 
are 
identified 
with 
the points r;. 
These points are the 
vertices of two adjacent 
spherical 
tetrahedra. 
The 
lines 
represent 
great 
circles, 
viz.: C11=~11ns3 and 
C12=~12n5J. 
We refer the root vectors to 
a 
cartesian 
coordinate 
system e1' .•• ,e4' 
For a given root vector 
r:=[P1,P2,Pl,P4) 
the 
involution 
Z 
is 
obtained 
as 
follows: 
We 
determine 
a new basis e;, •.. ,e4 with the 
transformation A where e;:=r and e2' el' e4 are orthog-
onal to r. In reference to the new 
coordinate 
system, 
the involution 2' has the form

The point 
group 
generated 
from the involutions Z1' Z2' l3' and l4 is the group A4 
of 
order 120. 
It is the group of the regular simplex 
{3,3,3}. 
We denote by A~ the group of order 240 gener-
ated by A4 and the central inversion 
-I. 
The 
point 
group generated from the involutions l1' Z2' Z3' and Z5 
is 
the 
group G4 of order 14400. It is the point group 
of the regular 600-cell {3,3,5} which is 
dual 
to 
the 
120-cell {S,3,3}. 
We 
observe 
that 
in E4 a combination of the octahedral 
and the icosahedral point groups 
is 
not 
possible. 
It 
means 
that 
there 
exists 
no 
combination 
of 
spherical 
octahedra and icosahedra which tessellate the sphere 53. 
Remarkably in spaces of higher dimensions n>4 only three 
regular polytopes occur, viz.: the 
regular 
simplex 
with 
point 
group An of order (n+1)! and the regular crosspoly-
tope and its dual counterpart the regular 
hypercube 
with 
point group Cn of order 2nn!. 
The point groups derived in case 1 can also be generated 
by 
reflections 
in 
a set of hyperplanes. The relation to 
the involutions Z; is given by the property that -Ill is a 
reflection in 
a 
hyperplane 
perpendicular 
to 
the 
root 
vector r; (for details on groups generated by reflections 
the reader is referred to Coxeter (Coxe1». 
We note that in spaces of 
even 
dimension 
the 
central 
inversion -I is a proper and li is an improper involution. 
In 
spaces 
of odd dimension -I is an improper and li is a 
proper involution. 
Similarly, as it was done in three-dimensional space, we 
can group the four-dimensional point groups 
in 
a 
finite 
number 
of series. A possible way to do this will be shown 
in the next section when discussing the root classes. 
Among all point groups in E4 we have 
to 
determine 
the 
crystallographic 
point 
groups 
and to classify them into 
the geometric crystal classes. 
The actual 
derivation 
of 
the 
crystal classes in E4 however. started from the maxi-

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC POINT GROUPS 
111 
mal irreducible integral matrix groups. In E2 the 
crystal 
classes 
C4v 
and C6v are maximal. In EJ the crystal class 
Oh is maximal. To Oh belong three non-equivalent 
integral 
matrix groups. There are three irreducible maximal crystal 
classes 
in 
E4 
having orders 1152, 288, and 240. Each of 
these gives rise to 
two 
non-equivalent 
integral 
matrix 
groups. 
The 
latter 
were 
determined 
by Dade CDade1). 
Plesken and Pohst determined the maximal irreducible inte-
gral matrix groups up till n=9 CPles1). 
The 
results 
of 
these calculations are given in Table 6.3.

The subgroups of 
the 
maximal 
integral 
matrix 
groups 
yield 
all geometric crystall classes. In four-dimensional 
space they were calculated by BUlow 
CBUlo1) 
using 
group 
theoretical computer programs. 
The 
results of these calculations are summerized in the 
following theorem. 
Theorem 6.5:

32 in three-dimensional, and 227

in

space. 
Root classes 
The 
root 
vectors r; were introduced in section 6.4. as 
unit vectors in the principal planes. 
If 
two 
principal 
planes 
intersect along a one-dimensional subspace then we 
can choose a root vector in this subspace. However, for 
a 
given 
point 
group 
p, not all intersections of principal 
planes determine root vectors. We further require that the 
corresponding involutions Z leave the point group P invar-
iant that is, 

112 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Example 6.2: In EJ we consider the 
icosahedral 
group 
I. 
The root vectors lie in the twofold rotation axes which 
are 
given by the intersections of the principal planes 
corresponding to the rotations of order three and five. 
However, the 
intersections 
of 
the 
principal 
planes 
corresponding 
to 
different 
rotations 
of order three 
determine no root vectors as is shown in Figure 6.6 . 
• 
Figure 6.6. Root vectors in the icosahedral group I 
Besides the involutions Z each of which leaves a one-di-
mensional subspace fixed there can exist other involutions 
in a point group. 
For example the central inversion -I is 
such an involution. 
In section 
6.4 
we 
introduced 
the 
involution 
Y 
which 
interchanges 
different 
principal 
planes. 
Another possible involution, we call 
it J, 
has 
the following form 
J : = 
where h,k>1 (if h=1 then J is an involution Z, if k=1 then 
J is a reflection in a hyperplane and -IJ is an involution 
Z). We do not write these involutions as products of addi-
tional 
involutions 
Zi 
because, in this case, the Zi are 
not uniquely defined. We only consider this kind of 
invo-
lutions 
if 
they 
are 
essential 
generators of the point 
group. 
To every point group P of finite order we can 
assign 
a 
root system R which contains all root vectors, 
R:={r1' .•. ,r s }' 

CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC POINT GROUPS 
113 
Thus 
we 
obtain 
a 
natural 
classification 
of the point 
groups. 
Definjtjon 6.6: 
Two point groups belong to the same 
root 
class 
if they have congruent root systems. 
Point 
groups having in addition essential involutions 
V 
or J are assigned to separate root classes. 
That 
this 
definition 
makes 
sense 
is revealed in the 
following theorem. 
Theorem 6.6: 
Equivalent point groups belong to 
the 
same 
root class. 
Proof: By theorem 6.2, equivalent point groups are orthog-
onal 
equivalent. 
It 
follows that they have congruent 
root systems. 
Therefore, root classes contain full equivalence classes 
of point groups. 
A set M of involutions corresponds to ev~ry root system, 
M : = { Z 1 , • • • , Z 5' - I, ( Y 1 , • • • , Y v , J 1 , • • • , J w) } • 
Each root class is characterized through a point group 
maximal order. 
Definitjon 
6.7: 
The 
point group of maximal order 
root class is called the holohedry 
of 
that 
class. 
of 
in a 
root 
The 
holohedry 
of a root class contains all involutions 
of M. 
Theorem 6.7: 
Point groups belonging to a root class K are 
normal in the holohedry H of that root class. 
Proof: Assume that the point group P<H belongs 
to 
K. 
We 
have 
to show that for every symmetry operation S~H the 
relation S-1PS=P is 
fulfilled. 
Essential 
involutions 
y,J~H are 
by 
definition 
6.6 
common to ~oth P and H 
hence, they fulfil this relation. 
The 
same 
does 
the 
central 
inversion 
-I~H. 
Now 
let S:=Z,Zj' 
ZI,Zj~M. 
Because for every ZI~M we have Z,PZI=P it follows that 
which proves the above theorem.

This is an equivalence relation and we can classify

spaces of even dimension the rotation S; :=2, is an improp-

Let 
P+ be a point group of the first

If 2, and 2j are not related under P+ then 
are non-equivalent point groups. 
In 
what 
follows we derive the root classes and we will 
propose a possible nomenclature for the root classes.

we denote by the symbol "1".

In two-dimensional space the number of root

The symbol "111" indicates that there are 
two 
linearly

directions, 
and that only the central inver-

that 
there

We note that the symbol "211" does not represent 
a 
root 
class 
because 
the central inversion -I generates a 
second involution Zz. The symbol "m", 
m€~, m>2, represents 
a principal plane (it is a two-dimensional space) 
with 
a 
rotation 
of 
order 
m. 
The 
rotation is generated by two 
involutions Z1 and Zz having their 
root 
vectors 
in 
the 
principal 
plane. 
The 
root 
vectors 
enclose an angle of 
180 o /m. 
It gives no difficulty to derive 
the 
root 
classes 
in 
three-dimensional space. The result is shown in Table 6.5.

symbols "0" and "I" denote root classes having irreducible 
point groups. In the symbols of reducible root 
classes 
a 
single 
odd number is not possible e.g. "21211", "312", or 
"411" are not root classes.

every 
crystal 
system 
corresponds 
to a full root 
class (for a definition 
of 
crystal 
system 
and 
crystal 
family the reader is referred to the International Tables, 
Vol. 
A). 
In 
higher dimensional spaces this is no longer 
true. 
The root system belonging to the root class "0" is shown 
in Figure 6.7. The point group 
T 
has 
a 
congruent 
root 
system 
hence, 
it 
belongs 
to 
the 
same root class. The 
corresponding set of involutions fall, under T, 
into 
two 
classes 
of 
related involutions. One class of involutions 
corresponds to the twofold axes of the symmetry 
scaffold-
ing 
of T. The other class corresponds to the root vectors 
which are determined 
through 
the 
intersections 
of 
the 
principal 
planes 
belonging 
to the threefold axes. Hence 
there exist two non-equivalent point groups of the 
second 
kind, viz.: Th and Td
• 
The 
root classes in four-dimensional space are given in 
Table 6.6 (the crystal families in four- dimensional space 
are taken from Brow1). There is no agreement between 
root 
classes 
and 
crystal 
families in four-dimensional space. 
The assignment of the four-dimensional point groups to the 
root classes is not yet accomplished. 
This will 
be 
the 
task 
of future research. Also a suitable nomenclature for 
point groups in higher dimensional spaces which shows 
the 
relation 
to 
the root classes is still missing. Proposals 
for a nomenclature of the crystal classes in 
four 
dimen-
sional 
space 
were 
made by Whittacker (Whit1) and Weigel 
(Weig1)'

Isomorphism types of point groups 
The classification of crystal classes is 
equivalence 
of their matrix representations 
natively we may classifY the 
point 
groups 
their isomorphism type. 
based 
on 
the 
in En. Alter-
according 
to 
Definition 
6.9: 
Two 
groups 
G and G' are isomorph and 
belong to the same isomorphism type if there is 
a 
bijective mapping of G onto G' which conserves the 
composition. 
Example 
6.3: In E3 the point groups of order 2, viz.: C;, 
CS ' 
and C2' which correspond to a center of symmetry, a 
mirror plane, and a twofold axis respectively represent 
geometrically completely different 
symmetry 
scaffold-
ings. However, they are isomorph to the unique abstract 
group of order 2, viz.: {a,a 2 =1}. 
The results of this classification are summerized in the 
following theorem: 
Theorem 
6.7: 
There exist 2 in 1-dimensional, 9 in 2-di-
mensional, 18 in 3-dimensional and 117 isomorphism 
types of crystallographic point groups in 4-dimen-
sional space. 
The isomorphism 
types 
of 
the 
crystallographic 
point 
groups are listed in Table 6.8 for the 2-dimensional space 
and in Table 6.9 for the 3-dimensional space. In Table 6.7 
are 
listed 
the numbers of non-isomorphic abstract groups 
of order h up to h=48. 
6.7. 
Historical remarks 
In 1815 the mineralogist Samuel Weiss (1780-1856) intro-
duced the seven crystal systems (Weis1). This 
classifica-
tion implicitly contained the crystallographic restriction 
which forbides a crystal symmetry of order five.

The 32 crystal classes in E3 
were 
determined 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
1826 
by 
the 
mineralogist Moritz Ludwig 
Frankenheim (1801-1872) (Fran1) as it was recently 
disco-
vered 
by 
J.J. Burckhardt CBurc4). They were redetermined 
again in 1830 by the mineralogist Johann Friedrich 
Chris-
tian 
Hessel 
(1796-1872) (Hess1, Hess2). 
Frankenheim and 
Hessel both derived the 32 possible symmetries of 
polyhe-
dra whose faces fulfil the law of rationality Ccf. section 
3.4). 
In the same year the mathematician Evariste Galois 
(1811-1832) published his treatise 
"Sur 
la 
thiorie 
des 
nombres" in which he introduced the concept of a mathemat-
ical 
group which later became so important in crystallog-
raphy 
(Galo1). 
The 
work 
of 
Frankenheim 
and 
Hessel 
remainded 
unnoticed and independently the crystal classes

were redetermined in 1849 by 
August 
Bravais 
(1811-1863) 
who however missed the rotoreflection (Brav1). 
A complete 
list 
was 
provided 
again 
in 
1867 
by 
Axel 
Gadolin 
(1828-1892) (Gado1). 
The 
crystallographic 
point 
groups 
were subsequently derived in various other ways. Non-crys-
tallographic 
point 
groups 
were 
investigated 
by Werner 
Nowacki (Nowa1). 
Four-dimensional groups were investigated by the 
mathe-
matician 
Eduard 
Goursat (1858-1936) CGour1). 
His paper 
contains three parts. In part II he determined four-dimen-
sional point groups through direct products 
of 
two-
and 
three-dimensional 
point 
groups. 
However. some of these 
groups have no 
real 
representation 
in 
four-dimensional 
space. 
In 
part III he generated four-dimensional point 
groups by reflections on the walls of a 
sphe~ical tetrahe-
dron. Point groups generated by refl~ctions were 
further 
investigated 
by 
H.M.S. 
Coxeter 
whose book on regular 
poytopes has 
become 
standard 
(Coxe1). 
Four-dimensional 
groups 
were 
also 
derived using quaternions (for details 
the reader is referred to DuVa1). 
In 
1949 
Carl 
Hermann 
(1898-1961) described the symmetry operations in spaces of 
arbitrary 
dimensions (HermS). 
The four-dimensional crys-

122 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
tal 
classes 
were 
investigated 
by 
A.C. 
Hurley in 1951 
(Hurl1, Hurl2). A complete list of four-dimensional 
crys-
tal 
classes 
was 
compiled 
by 
BUlow in 1967. 
They are 
contained in the book of Harold Brown, Rolf BUlow, Joachim 
NeubUser, Hans Wondratschek, and Hans Zassenhaus (Brow1). 
As already mentioned Weiss empirically derived the seven 
crystal systems. 
However, he used orthogonal axes for the 
triclinic and monoclinic system considering 
these 
to 
be 
subsystems of the orthogonal crystal system. 
This classi-
fication 
was 
based 
on 
the 
external shape of crystals. 
Gadolin emphasized that the point 
group 
symmetry 
deter-
mines 
the physical properties of a crystal. The tensor of 
a physical property remains invariant under a point group. 
It is 
by 
chance 
that 
in 
three-dimensional 
space 
the 
lattice 
symmetries 
are root class holohedries. In higher 
dimensional spaces this is no longer 
true. 
Unfortunately 
the holohedries in three-dimensional space were defined by 
Niggli as beeing lattice symmetries (Nigg3). For the defi-
nition 
of 
crystal systems in higher dimensions NeubUser, 
Wondratschek, and BUlow also used the 
lattice 
symmetries 
(Neub1). 
However, 
lattice 
symmetries 
have 
no physical 
significance. 
Because of the different definitions 
there 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
correspondence between root classes and 
crystal systems or crystal families in higher 
dimensional 
spaces. 

7. Lattice Symmetries 
We investigate in this chapter the action of a 
crystal-
lographic point group P on a lattice Tn. 
7.1. 
Definitions 
In section 3.1 it was proved that a regular point system 
X 
consists of a finite set of congruent point lattices L; 
each parallelly placed in space. 
Let 
LCX 
be 
a 
point 
lattice 
in 
En. We choose a point xo~L as an origin a and 
then we identify each point xj~L through 
its 
vector 
Xj. 
Thus 
a lattice Tn is obtained. 
Among the lattice vectors 
of Tn we choose a lattice 
basis a1, ... ,an 
(cf. 
section 
3.2). 
We consider a crystallographic point group P which 
maps the lattice Tn onto itself. 
By 
theorem 
5.1, 
the 
group 
P has a representation in En through unimodular nxn 
matrices with integral 
coefficients, 
if 
referred 
to 
a 
lattice 
basis. In section 6.1 the point groups were clas-
sified into geometric classes. A finer 
classification 
of 
the 
crystallographic 
point groups is obtained if we take 
into account the lattices Tn on which the groups 
act 
and 
the way a group acts on a lattice. 
Definition 
7.1: 
Two crystallographic point groups P and 
P' with lattices Tn and Tn. 
are 
called 
arithme-
tically equivalent and belong to the same arithme-
tic 
crystal 
class 
if 
there 
exists 
an 
affine 
mapping 
~ which maps Ponto P' and thereby maps Tn 
onto Tn., 
Synonymous to arithmetic crystal class, ~-class is used. 
Because the point lattices L;CX are parallelly placed in 
space it follows that 
the 
symmetry 
of 
a 
single 
point 
lattice 
L 
is 
equal 
or 
higher than the symmetry of the 
regular point system X of which L is a subset only. 
Among 
all crystallographic point groups P; which map the lattice 
Tn onto itself the one of highest order 
is 
distinguished 
to 
contain 
all 
origin preserving symmetry operations of 
the lattice Tn. 
123 

124 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Definition 
7.2: 
A Bravais point group B is a crystallo-
graphic point group which contains all 
isometries 
that map a lattice Tn onto itself. 
In 
a 
similar 
way as we have classified the crystallo-
graphic point groups the Bravais point groups may be clas-
sified into geometric or arithmetic Bravais classes. 
The Bravais point 
groups 
enable 
us 
to 
classify 
the 
lattices Tn. 
Definition 
7.3: 
Two 
lattices 
Tn and Tn' with Bravais 
point groups Band B' belong to the 
same 
Bravais 
type of lattices if there exists an affine mapping 
~ which 
maps 
B onto B' and thereby maps Tn onto 
Tn' , 
By this definition there exists a one-to-one correspond-
ence between the Bravais types of lattices and the 
arith-
metic 
Bravais 
classes. 
In spaces of even dimension the 
central inversion -I 
is 
a 
proper 
rotation 
hence, 
the 
lattice Tn may have a definite chirality. Because of phys-
ical 
reasons it is useful to consider only special affine 
transformations ~+ which conserve 
the 
chirality 
of 
Tn. 
Thus 
more 
special 
Bravais types of lattices are distin-
guished (cf. section 8.1). 
7.2. 
Bravais point groups 
In what follows we characterize the Bravais point groups 
among the crystallographic point groups. In terms 
of 
the 
positive-definite 
n-nary 
quadratic 
form as described in 
section 4.1, a Bravais point 
group 
B 
corresponds 
to 
a 
group 
of linear substitutions which transform a quadratic 
form onto itself. Each such transformation corresponds 
to 
a symmetry operation of the corresponding lattice. We look 
at these symmetry operations in a geometric way. 
Theorem 7.1: 
A Bravais point group B contains the central 
inversion -I. 
Proof: From the definition of a lattice it follows that if 
t is a lattice vector then also -t is a lattice vector. 

LATIICE SYMMETRIES 
125 
We consider a lattice Tn with Bravais point group B. Let 
S~B 
be a symmetry operation of Tn with symmetry support U 
(cf. section 5.4). Let d be the dimension of U with 
O~d~n. 
The space En is 
decomposed 
into 
U 
and 
its 
orthogonal 
complement 
V of dimension h:=n-d. En is the direct sum of 
U and V, En=u+v. 
Because the subspace 
U 
remains 
fixed 
under 
the 
symmetry 
operation 
S 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
subspace V is an invariant subspace under S. 
Theorem 7.2: 
If the Bravais point group B of Tn 
contains 
a 
symmetry 
operation 
S of order k wit~ d-dimen-
sional symmetry support U, and if V, 
the orthog-
onal complement of U in En, then there 
exists 
in 
each of these subspaces a basis of lattice vectors 
b;E:Tn. 
Proof: 
Let a1'" .,a n be a lattice basis in Tn. For d=O or 
d=n the above theorem is evident. Assume O<d<n. 
Among 
the 
basis 
vectors 
a1"" ,an we find at least d basis 
vectors, say a1', .. ,ad which have linearly 
independent 
non-zero 
components 
U1'" .,Ud 
in 
U 
and 
components 
V1" ",Vd in V. 
Let S~B be of order k. We calculate 
= ku;+v;+Sv;+ ..• +Sk-1 v ; = ku;, 
for i=1, ••• ,d. The b; are lattice vectors 
remain fixed under S because 
in 
U 
which 
Similarly, 
there 
exist 
at least h:=n-d basis vectors 
aj, say ad+1' ••. ,a n , which 
have 
linearly 
independent 
non-zero components Vj in V. We calculate 
for 
j=d+1, .•• ,n. 
Because 
V 
is 
invariant under S it 
follows that SVj~V. Hence the bj are lattice vectors in 
V. 
We note that in general the lattice vectors b1, ••• ,b n do 
not form a lattice basis of 
Tn. 
From 
theorem 
7.2 
it 
follows that there exists in each of the subspaces U and V 
a 
sUblattice 
TdCT" 
and 
ThCTn 
respectively 
which 
are

As 
above let U be the symmetry support of 5~B and V its 
orthogonal complement in En. 
Theorem 7.3: 
If the Bravais point group B 
of 
Tn 
has 
a 
symmetry 
operation 
5 
of 
order 
k>1 
and if the 
invariant subspace 
V

into 
mutual 
orthogonal Z-irreducible subspaces VI then

Proof: 
Let 
h:=n-d be the dimension of V. By theorem 7.2. 
the 
subspace 
V 
has 
a 
basis 
of 
lattice 
vectors 
b1 ••.•• bh. 
Let b1 be a shortest lattice vector in V. 
We assume b1 has non-zero components in 
the 
subspaces 
V1 ••••• Vv • 
v~s. 
Equivalent 
lattice 
vectors 
are 
obtained through the action of 51 
on 
b1' 
b,:=5'-1b1' 
i=2 •.••• k. 
Assume 
that 
among 
these 
h' are linearly 
independent and span the subspace V'. If dimeV')<dimeV) 
then we take a shortest lattice vector say b~+1 in 
the 
orthogonal 
complement 
of 
V' 
in 
V and determine the 
equivalent lattice vectors. We 
continue 
in 
this 
way 
until for bh it holds that V'=V. Under the action of 5' 
the 
component 
Yj1 in the principal plane ~j generates 
in ~j a regular mj-gon as is shown in Figure 
7.1. 
The 
mj-gon 
has C~v-symmetry. 
Therefore. there exists for 
each principal plane ~j 
a 
hyperplane 
Hj 
with 
plane 
normal 
rj 
(root 
vector) 
in ~j such that the line of 
intersection 
uj:=Hj n ~l 
bisects 
Vj1 
and 
Yj2. 
The 
reflection 
Rj in Hj maps Yj1 onto Yj2 and thereby maps 
~j onto itself and leaves the orthogonal complement 
of 
rj 
in 
En fixed (for a one-dimensional subspace Vi the 
root 
vector r, 
is 
in 
V,>. 
By 
assumption 
the 
Z-irreducible 
subspaces 
Vi are mutual orthogonal. 
It 
follows that the root vectors r,. i=1 ••••• s. are mutual 
orthogonal hence. the product of the R, is 
an 
involu-
tion. 
The symmetry support W of Z is given through the inter-
section of all hyperplanes Hj. j=1 ••••• s. 
The action of Z on b1 is given by

Every lattice vector q~Th is

v 
in V. 
We calculate 
t':= Zt = Zu + Zv = u + Zv. 
We have to determine Zv. By theorem 7.2. there exists a 
basis of lattice vectors in the symmetry support W of Z 
and 
in 
its orthogonal complement in En. Therefore. we 
can determine v' :=V-d, d~Th such that 
Sv'-v' = Sv-v -
(Sd-d) := W~Th 
is a lattice vector orthogonal to W. Therefore, 
Zv'-v' = W = Zv-v -
(Zd-d). 
Hence, Zv=v+x, where X:=W+Zd-d~Th. It follows that

Remark: 
In 
the 
case 
that 
two ore more ~-irreducible 
subspaces have the same rotations 
then 
the 
principal 
planes within these subspaces are not uniquely defined. 
It follows that the root vectors need not be orthogonal 
and hence, there exists no involution Z. 
Applying 
theorems 
7.1 and 7.3 the Bravais point groups 
can be found among the crystallographic point 
groups 
and 
we 
classify 
them into geometric Bravais classes. In two-
dimensional space the geometric Bravais classes are 
found 
to be 
In three-dimensional space it is easily verified that 
are 
geometric Bravais classes. In four-dimesnsional space 
the geometric Bravais classes 
were 
calculated 
by 
BUlow 
(BUlo1,BUlo2). 
The 
results 
of 
these 
calculations 
are 
summerized in the following theorem: 
Theorem 7.4: 
There are 1 in 1-dimensional, 4 in 
2-dimen-
sional, 
7 
in

and 
33 
geometric 
Bravais classes in 4-dimensional space. 
7.3. 
Bravais types of lattices 
For each geometric Bravais class a Bravais point group B 
is taken as a representative 
and 
we 
have 
to 
find 
the 
possible 
lattices 
which 
are 
invariant 
under 
B. 
The 
lattices are then classified according to their arithmetic 
Bravais point groups. 
Thereby, we have to consider for 
a 
given 
Bravais point group B affine transformations ~ only 
which map B onto iteslf hence, 
~ belongs 
to 
the 
affine 
normalizer 
of 
B,

(cf. 
section 
8.3). 
Let 
M:={S1" .. ,Sm} be a set of generating symmetry 
operations 
of 
B (cf. section 6.1). For a symmetry operation S,€M let 
r(S,) be the set of all lattices invariant under 51'

Theorem 7.5:

which 
are

T(S~) = T(S;).

Since every symmetry operation SE:B can 
be 
represented 
as a product 
---
S = II 5;

the above theorem follows. 
For a symmetry operation S1E:B let {V 1 , ..• ,V s } be the set 
of

In 
what follows we 
determine the set of all lattices T(5 1 ). 
To begin with we 
determine a lattice for a

sion

Let k be the order of the symmetry operation S1

it 
follows 
that

Because Pi' i=2, .. ,m, leaves U fixed it follows 
that Ck leaves U fixed which is a contradiction.

GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
By theorem 5.4, the dimension 
of 
V 
is 
n=~(k). 
Since 
(1-1/p;)<1 
it 
follows 
that 
n<k. 
There exists a unique 
decomposition 
of 
V 
into 
principal 
planes 
~j' 
j=1, ... ,s:=n/Z. Referred to a 
cartesian coordinate system 
e1' ... ,e n assumed within these pricipal planes, the symme-
try operation 51 has the following representation, 
cosZ~h1/k -sin2~h1/k 
sin2~h1/k 
cos2~h1/k 
o 
o 
cos2~hs/k -sin2~hs/k 
sin2~hs/k 
cos2~hs/k 
where 
the 
integers 
h1< .•. <h s 
are less than k/2 and are 
relatively prime to k, that is gcd(h;,k)=1. 
By 
theorem 
5.4, 
there 
exist 
exactly 
s 
such integers (cf. section 
5.3). If k=1 or k=2 then n=1 and we can choose any 
vector 
b1 
in 
V 
as a lattice vector. If k>2 then by theorem 7.3 
the Bravais point group B also contains an involution Z as 
a generating symmetry operation. Let 
W be 
the 
symmetry 
support 
of 
Z. 
By 
theorem 7.2, W has a basis of lattice 
vectors. 
If k=3,4, or 6 then n=2 hence, 
there 
exists 
a 
single 
principal 
plane 
~. 
We 
can 
choose an arbitrary 
vector b1€W as a lattice vector. If k=5, ork>6 then V 
is 
decomposed into s principal planes ~j which, in this case, 
cannot 
contain a lattice vector because 2cos2~hl/k is not 
integral. We have to choose a 
lattice 
vector 
b1€W 
such 
that 
b1 
has 
non-zero 
components 
Vj1 in each principal 
plane ~j because otherwise V" would be ~-reducible. 
Under 
the 
action 
of 51 lattice vectors b; equivalent to b1 are 
obtained, b; :=S;-1b1' i=Z, ... ,k. Because 
n<k 
it 
follows 
that 
the 
b; 
generate a lattice Tn. Depending on the the 
choice of the components Vj1 the angle fl between b1 and ba 
is 360 o/k<fl<360 oh s /k. 
Therefore, the b; 
not 
necessarily 
are 
shortest 
lattice vectors of Tn. 
Only for n~2 the b, 
are always shortest lattice vectors. 
By theorem 
3.12, 
a 
lattice 
basis 
a1' ... ,a n 
of 
Tn can be found through the 
construction of the Dirichlet 
parallelotope 
of 
Tn 
(for 
dimensions 
up 
to n=30 it was found that always b1, •.• ,b n 
is a lattice basis 
of 
Tn). 
Using 
the 
transformation 
A=(alj) we express the basis vectors a1, ... ,a n referred to 
the cartesian coordinate system e1, ... ,e n , 

LATTICE SYMMETRIES 
131 
In reference to the lattice basis a1, ... ,a n , the 
symmetry 
operation 
51 
has 
a 
representation with integer coeffi-
cients (cf. section 3.1), 
5 1 ,1 : = A 0 5 1,0 At. 
If b1' ... ,b n are taken 
as 
a 
lattice 
basis 
then 
the 
representation of 51 has the form 
o 0 0 ... 0 A1 
100 
010 
001 
o 
Up to dimension n=30 it was found that A; only assumes the 
integers 
-1,0,1. 
It is not proved that this is true in 
general. If k is prime then A;=-1, i=1, •.. ,n. 
All lattic-
es obtained in this way are equivalent 
under 
the 
affine 
normalizer N~CB). 
We now assume that 51 has two ~-irreducible subspaces V1 
and Vz of dimensions h1 and h z • 
The symmetry operation 51 
is represented, referred to a cartesian coordinate system, 
by 
o 
Let 
k1' 
kz 
be the orders of R1 and Rz respectively with 
k1<kz. 
It 
follows 
that 
the 
order 
of 
51 
is 
k=Ck1kz)/gcdCk1,kz). Two cases have to be considered: 
1. We can determine a lattice basis in each subspace V; as 
described above. 
2. Another 
lattice 
basis which, in general, is not equi-
valent to the first one under N~CB), is obtained if the 

132 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
lattice vector 
b1 
has 
non-zero 
components 
in 
both 
subspaces 
V1 
and 
V2 • 
Then 
necessarily b1 must have 
non-zero components in 
each 
principal 
plane 
because 
otherwise 
one 
or 
both 
of 
the subspaces V; would be 
~-reducible. 
Equivalent lattice vectors 
are 
obtained 
through 
the action of 51, b;:=5;-1b1' i=2, ... ,k. Among 
these h' are linearly independent and span 
a 
subspace 
V'. 
If dim(V')<dim(V) then we take a shortest lattice 
vector in the orthogonal complement of 
V' 
in 
En 
and 
determine again the equivalent lattice vectors. 
We 
note 
that 
if 
k1~k2 then 5 k leaves the subspace V1 
fixed hence, V1 and V2 are orthogonal and by 
theorem 
7.2 
there 
exists a basis of lattice vectors in V1 and V2' The 
correspond i ng sub latt ices Th1 and Th2 are mutual 
orthogonal

• 
I f k 1 = k 2 the n 
the principal planes are 
pairwaise 
not

deter-
mined. 
In this case there exist invariant sublattices Th. 
and Thz which are not orthogonal to each other. 
If there are more than two ~-irreducible subspaces addi-
tional 
combinations 
occur. 
For 
instance, 
the 
lattice 
vector 
b1 
may 
have 
non-zero components in one, two, or 
more ~-irreducible subspaces. 
The next step is to determine for each lattice as deter-
mined above the set of all lattices 
which 
are 
invariant 
under 
S~M. 
In 
order 
to 
do 
this 
we 
consider 
the 
n 2 -dimensional space r of all nxn matrices. In the space r 
the positive-definte n-nary quadratic forms are 
contained 
within some cone. 
Since the quadratic forms are symmetric 
it 
follows 
that 
r 
can 
be 
reduced 
to r ' of dimension 
n(n+1)/2. However, the following results are more 
conven-
iently 
formulated if we use r instead of r'. Each quadra-
tic form C=(c;j) corresponds 
to 
a 
lattice 
basis 
of 
a 
lattice 
Tn. 
The quadratic form C is identified through a 
point ~~r. 
The 
coordinates 
tk 
of 
~, 
k=1, ••• ,n 2 , 
are 
defined by tk:=Clj' where k=(i-1)n+j. Equivalent quadratic 
forms 
C' of Tn correspond to equivalent points ~'~r. Thus 
a lattice Tn corresponds to an infinite set of 
equivalent 
points 
in r. 
Within 
this set of equivalent points by 
theorem 4.1 one point ~o is distinguished to correspond to 
the reduced form. Thus, the lattice Tn is uniquely repres-
ented by ~o. 
Because the symmetry operation 5 is an isometry 
it 
has 
to leave a quadratic form C invariant (cf. section 1.3), 

LATTICE SYMMETRIES 
133 
c = stcs. 
We rewrite this equation in the form, 
where 
stxst 
is the direct product (Kronecker product) of 
st with itself. It has a representation 
through 
a 
n 2 xn 2 
matrix. 
The 
form 
C 
is 
considered as a point 7~r. Thus 
a:=stxst is a mapping of r onto itself and 7 
is 
a 
fixed 
point 
of a. Let U be the symmetry support of a. It corre-
sponds to the set of all nxn matrices which are 
invariant 
under 
a 
certain 
representation 
of S. Under a change of 
lattice basis with transformation A, the quadratic form 
C 
is 
transformed 
according 
to 
C':=ACAt. 
An 
equivalent 
lattice basis gives rise to an equivalent symmetry support 
U':=AxAU. 
Thus we obtain an 
infinite set 
of 
symmetry 
supports 
U; 
which 
we 
call 
a star. 
Among the symmetry 
sup p 0 r t s Uj 0 f a s tar a s y m met r y sup p 0 r t U 0

contains at least one reduced quadratic 
form. 
A lattice 
basis 
which 
is 
not equivalent under 
N~(B) gives rise to 
another star in r. Therefore, the set of all lattices T(S) 
which are invariant under S is represented 
in 
r 
through 
the 
union of a finite number of stars. Among each star we 
have to take the symmetry support Uo • 
In section 5.4 an arithmetic method was used 
to 
calcu-
late 
the 
symmetry support of a symmetry operation S. 
We 
now give an alternative method which is based on represen-
tation theory. 
Theorem 7.7: 
For a symmetry operation S of 
order 
k 
the 
dimension d of the symmetry support of a:=StxSt is 
given by 
k 
d = i-
~ tr2(SI). 
; =1 
( 7 .1 ) 
Proof: Through the direct product a:=stxst we get a repre-
sentation 
of 
S in r. 
The dimension d of the symmetry 
support U of a is equal to 
the 
number 
of 
times 
the 
identical 
irreducible 
representation 
occurs 
in 
the 
representation of a. We use the orthogonality 
relation 
between 
the 
irreducible 
representations 
in order to 
obtain the dimension d v corresponding to the v-th irre-
ducible representation,

cal

because 
tr(S~xSt)=tr2eS) 
the

is inevitable. 
The Bravais types of lattices in 
three-dimensional space were determined 
geometrically 
by 
Frankenheim 
(Frank2) 
and Bravais (Brav2). In four-dimen-
sional space the Bravais types of lattices were determined 
by calculating the subgroups of the maximal groups of 
4x4 
integral 
matrices 
(BUlo2). In five-, and six-dimensional 
space first the geometric Bravais classes were 
determined 
and 
then 
splitted 
into 
l-classes (Ples2, Ples3). 
The 
results 
of 
these 
calculations 
are 
summerized 
in 
the 
following theorem: 
Theorem 
7.8: 
There are 1 in 1-dimensioanl, 5 in 2-dimen-
sional, 14 in 3-dimensional, 64 in 
4-dimensional, 
189 
in

and 
826 Bravais types of 
lattices in 6-dimensional space. 
7.4. 
Arithmetic crystal classes 
The arithmetic crystal classes arising from a 
geometric 
crystal 
class 
K can be determined in the same way as the 
Bravais types of lattices. 
Indeed there is 
a 
one-to-one 
correspondence 
between 
the Bravais types of lattices and 
the arithmetic Bravais classes. 
For

However, 
knowing 
the arithmetic Bravais classes in En, 
group-subgroup relations can be used to find all 
arithme-
tic 
crystal 
classes. 
A 
representative of an arithmetic 
Bravais class is given through an ordered pair (B,Tn) of a 
Bravais point group B and a lattice Tn on 
which 
B 
acts. 
Let 
Bs~B 
be the Bravais point group of Tn. If Bs>B, then 
Tn is called non-characteristic with respect to B. 
Other-
wise 
if 
Bs=B, 
then Tn is called characteristic. In what 
follows we consider for B 
both 
characteristic 
and 
non-
characteristic lattices (cf. section 7.3). 
Every 
crystallographic point group P can be assigned to 
a minimal Bravais point group B, PSB, such that 
there 
is 
no 
other 
Bravais 
point 
group B' between P and B. For a 
certain lattice Tn~T(B) with Bravais 
point 
group 
Bs 
we 
split 
up P into arithmetic crystal classes. The non-equi-
valence of two arithmetic 
crystal 
classes 
geometrically 
corresponds 
to 
a different setting of the symmetry scaf-
folding of P with respect to the lattice Tn. The group 
of

We do this step for a representative Tn 
of 
each 
Bravais 
type 
of lattices belonging to B. Therewith all arithmetic 
crystal classes arising from P are obtained.

hand C6v<C12v of index 2. It follows that two non-equi-
valent arithmetic crystal classes arise out of C3v' For 
the

lattice is rotated by 30 0 with 
respect to the symmetry scaffolding of C3v as shown

The 
arithmetic 
crystal 
classes 
in 
three-dimensional 
space were determined by Niggli and Nowacki (Nigg4). These 
correspond 
to the tree-dimensional symmorphic space-group 
types determined by Fedorov (Fedo2, Fedo3). The arithmetic 
crystal classes in four-dimensional space were 
calculated 
by 
BUlow (BUlo1,BUlo2). The results of these calculations 
are summerized in the following theorem: 
Theorem 7.9: 
There are 2 in 1-dimensional, 13 in 2-dimen-
sional, 73 in 3-dimensional and 710+70 
arithmetic 
crystal classes in 4-dimensional space. 
In 
spaces 
of 
dimension 
n~4 pairs 
of enantiomorphic 
arithmetic crystal classes occur (cf. 
section 
1.3). 
For 
n=4 
the notation 710+70 indicates that there are 70 en an-
tiomorphic pairs.

Crystal forms 
According to the correspondence rule 
the 
facets 
of 
a 
crystal 
are parallel to lattice planes (cf. section 3.4). 
The growth of a crystal facet 
with 
facet 
vector f. 
in 
general, 
is 
not the same in the positive or in the nega-
tive direction of f. Therefore. we assign by f 
an 
orien-
tation 
to 
a 
set of parallel lattice planes. 
By theorem 
3.3. the facet 
vector 
~f has 
integral 
components.

referred 
to 
the reciprocal lattice basis. A facet vector 
f1' together with a finite positive real number~. deter-
mine 
a 
hyperplane 
H~ having distance ~ from the origin. 
H~ separates the space into two 
half-spaces 
H; 
and 
H1' 
where 
H~ 
is 
assumed 
to contain the origin (cf. section 
2.1). Under the action of a crystallographic 
point 
group 
Po 
facet 
vectors 
f; 
equivalent 
to 
f1 
are generated, 
f; :=S;f1' SI~PO' 
Each facet vector f;. together with 
the 
distance ~. determine an equivalent half-space H~. 
Definition 7.4: 
A crystal form is the intersection of all 
half-spaces 
H~ which are equivalent under a crys-
tallographic point group Po. 
A crystal form is called open or 
closed 
if 
it 
is 
an 
unbounded 
or 
a bounded set respectively. 
The stabilizer 
p. of a crystal form (cf. section 1.4) may 
be 
of 
higher 
order 
than the generating point group Po, 
Ps~Po. 
A crys-
tal form is called 
characteristic 
or 
non-characteristic 
with respect to Po if Ps=Po or p.>Po respectively. 
With 
the following definition crystal forms are classi-
fied into types of crystal forms: 
Definition 7.5: 
Two crystal forms F and F', 
with 
stabi-
lizers 
Ps 
and 
P~ respectively, are called equi-
valent and belong to 
the 
same 
type 
of 
crystal 
forms if F is combinatorially equivalent to F' and 
if Ps is equivalent to P~. 
Let Sto(f1)<PO be the stabilizer of the facet vector f1' 
The 
crystal 
form 
generated 
by 
f1 ~ calle~ general or 
special in Po if St O(f1)=C1 
or 
StO(f1»C1 
respectively. 
Let 
the 
d-dimensional subspace U, OSdSn. be the symmetry 
support of StO(f1)' Let sn-1 be a sphere of 
radius 
If1l. 
We say that the facet vector f1 has (d-1) degrees of free-
dom in S':=Unsn-1. Suppose now that d>1. We vary the facet 
vector 
f1 
by 
small amounts df~S' and then verify if the 
type of crystal forms has changed. 
In 
this 
way 
S' 
is 

LATTICE SYMMETRIES 
145 
divided into fields of existence each having the same type 
of 
crystal 
forms. 
Two 
neighbouring 
(d-1)-dimensional 
fields of existence are separated by 
a 
(d-2)-dimensional 
field of existence which corresponds to a limiting type of 
crystal forms. 
In 
three-dimensional 
space 
we observe that a limiting 
type of crystal forms always exhibits 
a 
higher 
symmetry 
than the types of crystal forms in both adjacent fields of 
existence. 
It 
is 
not proved that this is true in higher 
dimensions. 
The following methoj, based on this observation, 
allows 
us 
to find in a systematic way all types of crystal forms 
occuring in a crystallographic point group Po Ccf. section 
8.5). 
The way to do it is to determine for 
Po 
all 
non-
characteristic 
crystal forms. 
Let P1 be a supergroup of 
Po of index k and let StOCf1) and St1Cf1) be the stabiliz-
ers of f1 in Po and P1 respectively. The facet 
vector 
f1 
belongs 
to 
a non-characteristic crystal form only if the 
index [St1(f1):StoCf1) I 
is equal to the index 
k 
because 
otherwise 
P1 would generate more facet vectors than Po. 
Each pair 
of 
subgroups 
Sto(f)<P o 
and 
St1(f)<P1 
which 
satisfies this 
condition is a solution for a non-charac-
teristic crystal form. If there 
are 
no 
subgroups 
which 
fulfil 
this condition then P1 and any supergroup P2>P1 do 
not occur as a stabilizer of a crystal form 
generated 
by 
Po. 
For each facet vector f there exists a maximal super-
group 
Ps~Po which still fulfils the condition. 
Thereby, 
we 
restrict 
ourselves 
to 
crystallographic point groups 
because, for non-crystallographic point groups, the 
facet 
vectors do not have rational components. Moreover, we need 
consider 
only 
supergroups which are non-equivalent under 
the orthogonal normalizer NoCPo). 
The results of these calculations are summerized in 
the 
following theorem: 
Theorem 
7.10: 
There are 2 in 1-dimensional, 9 in two-di-
mensional, and 47 types of crystal forms in three-
dimensional space. 
Example 7.3: We consider in 
three-dimensional 
space 
the 
crystallographic 
point 
group 
T (cf. section 6~3). We 
choose the 
conventional 
lattice 
basis 
having 
basis 
vectors in the three mutual orthogonal twofold axis.

Hjstorjcal remarks 
The 
characterization 
of space lattices through ternary 
quadratic forms was pointed out in 1831 by 
Ludwig 
Seeber 
(Seeb2). 
In 
1842 
Moritz 
Ludwig Frankenheim (1801-1872) 
determined fifteen types of space lattices 
(Frank2). 
One 
type 
of 
lattice 
he listed twice. 
A complete derivation 
was later given 
by 
Bravais 
(Brav2). 
These 
types 
of 
lattices 
are 
now 
called 
the Bravais types of lattices. 
The Bravais types of lattices 
in 
four-dimensional 
space 
were 
geometrically 
investigated 
in 1958 by Alen Lindsay 
Mackay and 
G. 
Stuart 
Pawley 
(Mack1). 
Additions 
and 
corrections to their list by A.M. Zamorzaev and B.V. Tsek-
inovski i and by N.V. Belov (1891-1982) and T.S. Kuntsevich 
still 
did 
not gave the final result. A complete list was 
compiled by Rolf BUlow in 1967 (BUlo1). The Bravais 
types 
of 
lattices 
in 
five-dimensional 
space were compiled in 
1980 by Wilhelm Plesken (Ples2) and in 
1984 
the 
Bravais 

150 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
types of lattices in six-dimensioal space were compiled by 
Plesken and Hanrath (Ples3). 
The 
symmorphic 
space 
groups, 
which 
are 
in one-to-one 
correspondence to the 
arithmetic 
crystal 
classes, 
were 
derived 
in 
three-dimensional 
space by Fedorov. The term 
arithmetic crystal classes and its 
significance 
for 
the 
derivation 
of 
space 
groups 
was 
indroduced 
in 1934 by 
Johann Jakob Burckhardt (Burc1). 
Paul Niggli 
and 
Werner 
Nowacki 
determined 
the 
arithmetic 
crystal 
classes 
in 
three-dimensional space. 
Already Rene Just Hally 
(1743-1822) 
observed 
that 
the 
crystal 
forms could be related by integral proportions to 
a "primitive crystal form". 
In 
1816 
Christian 
Samuel 
Weiss 
(1780-1856) 
showed 
how 
crystal 
faces 
could 
be 
referred to a system 
of 
axes. 
He 
discovered 
that 
the 
intercepts 
of 
different 
crystal 
faces 
relative to the 
crystal axes are related by small whole 
numbers 
(Weis2). 
The 
indices used now are inversely proportional to Weiss' 
indices. They were proposed in 1825 by the mineralogist W. 
Whewell. 
A systematic description of 
crystal 
forms 
was 
performed 
in 
1830 by Carl Friedrich Naumann (1797-1873). 
The present nomenclature of the crystal forms is a 
slight 
modification, due to R.L. Parker, of the one given by Paul 
Groth 
(Grot1). 
A different nomenclature was proposed by 
Martin Buerger (Buer1). 

8. Space Groups 
Up till now symmetry groups were considered 
only 
which 
leave 
at 
least 
one point fixed. This restriction is now 
removed and we investigate groups of 
symmetry 
operations 
which act transitively on a regular point system XCEn. 
8.1. 
Definitions 
Space 
groups 
were 
defined in section 1.4 as groups of 
symmetry operations acting transitively on a regular point 
system XCEn. 
The space groups are classified 
into 
space 
group types according to the following definition: 
Definition 
8.1: 
Two space groups G and G' belong to the 
same space group type if there 
exists 
an 
affine 
mapping ~ which maps G onto G', 
Because 
of 
physical 
reasons 
it is useful to consider 
only affine transformations ~+ of the special affine group 
~+Cn), which conserve 
the 
chirality 
of 
the 
coordinate 
system. 
For 
dimensions 
n>2 
the number of special space 
group types thus obtained is larger 
than 
the 
number 
of 
space group types. 
Definition 8,2: 
An orbit OCH,xo) is the set of all points 
equivalent 
to 
a 
point 
xo~En under a group H of 
symmetry operations, 
If H is a space group G then by definition 1.3 an 
orbit 
OeG,xo) 
corresponds 
to a regular point system XCEn. 
Let 
Stexo)<H be the stabilizer of the point Xo in H (cf. defi-
nition 1.4). An orbit OeH,xo) is called general or special 
if SteXO)=C1 or SteXO»C1 respectively, where 
C1 
is 
the 
trivi~l group containing the identity only. 
Definjtjon 8.3: 
A fundamental region F of a space group G 
is any simply connected region which contains from 
each orbit of G exactly one point. 
Synonymous to fundamental region also asymmetric unit is 
used.

GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Since each orbit O(G,xo) corresponds to a regular 
point 
system 
there 
exists 
for 
O(G,xo) a maximal interstitial 
ball of radius R. It follows 
that 
the 
Dirichlet 
domain 
D(xo) is bounded. Remembering the properties 2.1 to 2.3 of 
Dirichlet 
domain partitions (cf. section 2.3) we see that 
the Dirichlet domain of a general orbit 
can 
be 
used 
to 
define 
a fundamental region of G. The following relations 
hold: 
intD(xo) C F, 
F C clD(xo). 
Thus only part of the boundary of clD(xo) belongs 
to 
the 
fundamental 
region 
F 
of 
G. 
Since D(xo) is bounded it 
follows that F is bounded. 
Fundamental 
regions 
for 
the 
two-
and 
three-dimensional space groups are given in the 
International Tables, Vol. A (Hahn1).

However, 
as G is an infinite group, some special considerations are 
necessary. 
By definition 5.3 the symmetry 
support 
of 
a 
general 
symmetry operation (S,s)~G was defined as a coset 
p~+U. The number of 
symmetry 
operations 
which 
have 
an 
identical 
symmetry 
support 
may 
be infinite in the case 
that d>O hence, we choose 
one 
symmetry 
operation 
among 
them 
for 
which 
S 
has maximal order k and for which the 
screw vector 
t 
= Sk-1 s + ... +Ss+s 
has minimal length. Such a symmetry operation 
we 
call 
a 
minimax 
symmetry operation. 
Let t' be a shortest lattice 
vector such that t=mt'. For a minimax 
symmetry 
operation 
it 
follows that OSm<k/2. 
If d=1 and m>O it may be neces-
sary to distinguish between right- and 
left-handed 
screw 
rotations. 
Let 
U~ be the orthogonal complement of U. If 
there 
exists 
a 
vector 
V1~U~ such 
that 
the 
vectors 
V; :=S;-1 y1 , i=1, .•• ,n-1, form a basis of U~ then (5,5) has 
a

chirality. Let the nxn matrix A b~ defined by 
the components

Th~ minimax

(S,s) is called a right- or a left-handed screw 
rotation 
if 
det(A»O 
or 
det(A)<O 
respectively 
(cf. 
sections 
1.3 
and 
5.5). 
We can assign to each symmetry 
support a double weight (±m,k), where + or -
represents 
a 
right-

allows us to define the symmetry scaffolding 
of 
a

Derivation of space groups 
By 
theorem 
3.2, 
every 
space group G in n-dimensional 
Euclidean space En contains n linearly independent 
trans-
lations 
which 
generate 
a free abelian translation group 
Tn. Let P be a crystallographic point group which maps 
Tn 
onto itself. 
The ordered pair (p,Tn) determines an arith-
metic 
crystal 
class 
(cf. section 7.1). 
We ask for the 
possible space groups which can be derived from (p,Tn). 
8.2.1. Derivation by the congruences of Frobenius 
The coset decomposition of G with respect to Tn is 
where the shift vectors 5, can be chosen 
modulo 
Tn. 
For 
the 
identity 
operation always (1,0) is assumed. In order 
to construct a space group G it is 
necessary 
and 
suffi-
cient 
to 
specify for each coset representative (S"s,) a 
shift vector Sf such that (S"s,)E:G. This 
choice 
is 
not 
arbitrary. 
Using a geometric argument a direct method to 
determine the shift vectors is given in the third part 
of 
this section. 
Two 
properties 
of 
space 
groups 
are 
revealed by the 
following theorems. 
Theorem 8.1: 
The translation group Tn is normal in G 
and 
is a maximal free abelian subgroup of G. 
Proof: 
Tn 
is 
a 
free 
abelian 
group. It is normal 
because for any 
symmetry 
operation 
(S,s)E:G 
and 
translation tE:Tn we obtain 
in G 
any 
By requirement SE:P maps Tn onto itself hence, StE:Tn for 
every 
tE:Tn. 
Suppose

in Tn we obtain as above

Because G' is abelian we also have

(I,St)=(I,t) for all t£Tn. 
Since Tn has n line-
independent 
translations 
it 
follows 
that

(s,s)~Tn. Thus Tn is a maximal abelian 
subgroup 
Theorem 
8.2: 
The quotient group G/Tn is isomorphic to a 
crystallographic point group P. 
Proof: Suppose that (S"SI) and (Sj,Sj) are 
in 
the 
same 
coset 
of 
G with respect to Tn. 
It follows that there 
exists a translation t~Tn such that 
From 
it follows that Sj1S;=I hence, Sj=S;. Inversely (S;,s;) 
and (S;,Sj) are in the same coset because 
Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between 
the cosets and the symmetry operations S;~P. 
By theorem 3.1, a 
crystallographic 
point 
group

hence,

parts on both sides of the above 
equation have to be equal up to a translation t;j(Tn. Thus 
we get a Frobenius congruence (Frob1), 
A similar congruence is set up for each pair S;,Sj(P. 
The 
shift 
vector 
of the identity operation always is assumed 
to be zero. A set of shift vectors S1, ... ,Sh which fulfils 
all h 2 congruences is called a solution of 
the 
Frobenius 
congruences 
and gives rise to a possible space group. 
If 
r1, ... ,rh is another solution then also the 
sum 
of 
both 
solutions S1+r1"",Sh+rh is a solution. 
Particularly the 
set 
of 
shift 
vectors 
S1=",=Sh=O is always a solution, 
called the zero-solution. 
Defjnjtion 8.5: 
The space 
group

of

8.2.2. Derivation by ~roup extension 
Space groups can be considered as extensions of a 
crys-
tallographic 
point group P by a lattice Tn. 
In extension 
theory the property of theorem 8.2 is expressed as a short 
exact sequence of group homomorphisms, 
a 
{3 
o _ 
Tn _ 
G _ 
P _ 
1, 
where 0 and 1 are the trivial groups 
for 
the 
additively 
written 
group Tn and the multiplicatively written group P 
respectively. The sequence is 
called 
exact 
because 
the 
image 
of each homomorphism is isomorphic to the kernel of 
its successor. Thus we have 
image(a) 
1:.1 Tn 
image({3) 
1:.1 P 
= kernel({3) 
= kernel(l'), 
where a is injective and {3 is surjective. It follows 
that 
G/T"I:.IP. 
In extension theory a Frobenius congruence is written as 

156 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
The function f(S; ,Sj) is called a factor and has values in 
Tn. 
It 
is 
independent 
of 
the 
choice of origin. 
The 
normalizing condition is 
f(I,S;) = f(S;,I) = O. 
A set of factors fCS;,Sj}' i,j=1, ... ,h is called a normal-
ized 2-cocycle. It is a solution of the Frobenius 
congru-
ences and corresponds to a mapping f: PxP 
~ Tn. The set of 
all 
2-cocycles is denoted by Z2(P,Tn). They form an addi-
tive abelian group. 
The 2-cocycles depend on 
the 
choice 
of 
coset 
representatives. 
If 
we 
change the represent-
atives, 
then a 2-cocyle changes by a 2-coboundary,

B2(p,Tn).

Each element of the second 
gives an extension G of P 
by 
Tn. 
T~e extension 
theory 
provides 
no 
procedure 
to determine the shift vectors 5; 
such that the Frobenius congruences are fulfilled for each 
pair S, ,Sj~P. Only the rather weak result 
is 
known 
that 
the 
origin 
can be chosen such that the shift vectors are 
multiples of 1/h, where h is the order of 
the 
crystallo-
graphic 
point 
group 
P 
(Frob1). 
We note that in higher 
dimensions the order h can become very large. 
8.2.3. Derivation by orbit splitting 
The above theory cannot explain the remarkable 
observa-
tion 
that 
the 
number 
of 
space 
groups derived from an 
arithmetic crystal class may 
vary 
drastically 
from 
one 
class 
to 
another. 
The 
following geometric construction 
gives a basic insight into the structure of 
space 
groups 
and allows a direct determination of the shift vectors ll,. 
Let 
~ be a symmorphic space group with crystallographic 
point group P and lattice Tn. We consider a general 
orbit 

SPACE GROUPS 
157 
O(~,xo) 
which we represent as the union of all translates 
of an orbit of P Ccf. Figure 1.1), 
U 
O(P,xo)+t,. 
t,€:Tn 
Each space group G, derived from CP,Tn), we consider 
as 
a splitting of the orbit O(P,xo) in the following way: 
Definition 
8.6: 
A partition of an orbit O(P,xo) into k 
disjoint subsets M" 
i=1, •.. ,k, is called a 
regu-
lar 
splitting 
of OCP,xo) if there exists a point 
group P'<P which acts transitively on 
the 
points 
of 
a subset M, and another point group C'<P which 
acts transitively on the k subsets M,. 
The 
group 
C' is called the complement of P' in P. 
Theorem 
8.3: 
A necessary and sufficient condition for a 
regular splitting of OCP,xo) is that at least 
one 
of 
the groups P' or C' is normal in P and that P' 
and C' only have the identity operation in common. 
Proof: Let h be the order of P. 
Suppose P' is normal in P 
of index k. 
The coset decomposition of P with 
respect 
to P' becomes, 
P = P'W 1 U ... U P'W k , 
where 
W1 
is 
the 
identity 
operation. 
Because P' is 
normal in P the co sets P'W, form a 
group 
under 
coset 
mUltiplication 
which is isomorphic to C'. The group C' 
is not uniquely determined in 
P. 
It 
depends 
on 
the 
choice 
of 
coset representatives. 
Under P' the orbit 
OCP,xo) splits up into 
k 
different 
orbits 
OCP' ,Xi)' 
with 
x;=W;xo. 
Each 
orbit 
O(P',X,) 
corresponds to a 
subset M, as introduced above and C' acts 
transitively 
on the k subsets M;. By requirement P' and C' have only 
the identity operation in common hence, the subsets are 
disjoint. 
For 
each 
C' 
there is the possibility that 
OCP,xo) splits up under C' into 
h/k 
different 
orbits 
M,:=O(C',x,), with x,=R,xo' R,€:P'. In this case P' acts 
transitively 
on 
the 
h/k subsets M,. 
Therefore, the 
action of P' and C' on O(P,xo) can be interchanged. 
The importance of the regular splitting 
revealed in the following theorem: 
of 
O(P,xo) 
is 

158 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Theorem 8.4: 
Every space group G derived from an arithme-
tic 
crystal class (p,Tn) corresponds to a regular 
splitting of O(P,xo). 
Proof: Suppose G has a maximal point group P'<P 
of 
index 
k. 
Under P' the orbit O(P,xo) splits up into k differ-
ent orbits O(P' ,XI)' with Xi :=WiXO' where Wi is a coset 
representative 
of P with respect to P'. All translates 
O(P',Xi)+t, t<'OTn, 
generate 
an 
orbit 
OCE',Xi) 
of 
a 
symmorphic space group E' corresponding to (p',Tn). 
In 
order to obtain a space group G we have to place trans-
lates 
O(E',Xi)+5i' 
i=1, ... ,k, 
in space in such a way 
that their union forms a regular point system X in En, 
k 
X:= u O(E',Xi)+5i' 
i= 1 
on which G acts transitively. 
This 
implies 
that 
all 
sets O(E',X;)+5i have to be disjoint and congruent to a 
regular 
point 
system 
X'. 
Hence, 
the 
cosets 
P'W i , 
i=1, •.. ,k, have to form a group under 
coset 
multipli-
cation 
which is isomorphic to C'<P. It follows that at 
least P' or C' have to be normal in P hence, the split-
ting of O(P,xo) is regular. 
Following Weissenberg, the point group P' 
is

Theorem 
8.5: 
If P',C'<P determine a regular splitting of 
O(P,xo) then the shift vectors of a space group 
G 
derived 
from 
an 
arithmetic crystal class (P,Tn) 
are among the translations of T'/Tn, where 
T' 
is 
the translation subgroup of N which is defined as 
N: =NfA (E' ) if P' is normal 
N: =NfA (F ' ) if C' is normal 
N: =NfA (E' ) n NfA ( F ' ) if P' 
normal 
Proof: 
Suppose 
P'<P 
is of index k. 
ition of G with respect to Tn is 
in P, or 
in P, or 
and C' are 
in P. 
The coset decompos-
where h is the order of P. We are free 
to 
choose 
the 
coset 
representatives, 
belonging to P', to have shift 
vectors 5=0 thus defining the 
origin 
to 
lie 
on 
the 
symmetry 
support of P'. The union of these cosets form 

SPACE GROUPS 
159 
a symmorphic space group E'<G. 
The 
coset 
represent-
atives 
belonging 
to C', appart of the identity opera-
tion, all have shift vectors 5~O modulo Tn. Because 
C' 
is a group the union of these cosets form a space group 
F'<G. 
Since C' is the complement of P' in P the space 
group G is generated by the union of E' 
and 
F'. 
By 
requirement G acts transitively on 
k 
X:= U OCE' ,XI )+5;. 
1=1 
Suppose 
P' 
is normal in P. The symmetry operations of 
F' have to map the 
symmetry 
scaffolding 
of 
E' 
onto 
itself. 
This 
implies 
that 
F' 
is 
a subgroup of the 
affine normalizer Ccf. section 8.3), 
F ,< N/A ( E ' ) • 
Since F' U E' generates G it follows that 
The Symmetry scaffolding of E' is mapped onto itself by 
the translations of N. 
By assumption P' is normal in P 
therefore, the symmetry scaffolding of E' is 
invariant 
under 
P 
hence, 
it is invariant under C'<P. Thus, the 
translations of N determine the possible shift 
vectors 
of 
F'. 
Suppose now that C' is normal in P. The same 
arguments show that 
G< N: = N/A C F ' ) . 
The translations of N map the symmetry 
scaffolding 
of 
F' onto itself. 
Suppose that both P' and C' are normal 
in P then 
hence, 
The 
translations 
of N map the symmetry scaffolding of 
E' and of F' respectively onto itself. 
Let T' 
be 
the 
translation 
subgroup 
of N. Two translations 51' s2<T' 
such that 

160 
give rise 
restrict 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
to equivalent space groups. Therefore, we can 
ourselves to the translations of the quotient 
group T'/Tn. 
Among the translations of T'/Tn only those 
have 
to 
be 
considered 
which 
are not equivalent under the normalizer 
of P in the general linear group GL(n,~). 
For decomposable groups the group N can 
have 
infinitly 
small 
translations. 
Suppose 
P 
is decomposable. There 
exists a symmetry operation S~P 
such 
that 
the 
symmetry 
support 
U of S is an invariant subspace of P. Suppose the 
group N has infinitely small translations in U. By theorem 
7.2, there exists a basis of lattice vectors in U. 
Let 
m 
be 
the 
order of S. By theorem 5.8, there exists a repre-
sentation of (S,s) such that 
s 
has 
rational 
components 
with 
denominator m. 
Particularly if P',C' define a regu-
lar splitting of O(P,xo) and 
S~C' then 
s 
can 
be 
chosen 
such that 
where 
k is the index of P' in P and t is a lattice vector 
in U. 
If P',C' determine a regular splitting of 
O(P,xo) 
then 
some 
of 
the 
shift vectors s~T'/Tn may determine a space 
group G which belongs 
to 
another 
regular 
splitting 
of 
O(P,xo). 
This can be seen as follows: Suppose that W~C', 
W~I, has shift vector v modulo Tn. We can assume that 
the 
shift 
vectors of the 
R,~P' are zero modulo Tn. It follows 
that 
(W,v)(R, ,O)=(WR, ,v) 
for 
R,E:P'. 
If 
the 
symmetry 
support 
U1 
of 
WR1 is orthogonal to v then (WR 1 ,v) has a 
symmetry support P1+U1 which remains pointwise fixed 
(cf. 
section 
5.5). 
Let M:={(WR1'V), ... ,(WRk'V)} be a set of 
symmetry operations which leave at least one common 
point 
fixed then M is the generating set of a finite subgroup of 
G 
equivalent 
to 
P"<P. 
The 
group P" may define another 
regular splitting of O(P,xo). From 
this 
immediately 
the 
following theorem is deduced: 
Theorem 
8.6: 
If a crystallographic point group P has a 
symmetry 
operation 
SE:P 
which 
leaves 
only 
the 
origin 
fixed 
then any space group G derived from 
an arithmetic crystal class (p,Tn) 
has 
a 
finite 
subgroup 
equivalent 
to the point group generated 
by S. 

SPACE GROUPS 
161 
Proof: By assumption the symmetry support of 5 is O-dimen-
sional hence, it is orthogonal to every shift vector s. 
It 
follows that (5,5) leaves a point fixed. Thus (5,5) 
generates a point group of finite order. 
Theorem 8.7: 
From a cyclic ~-irreducible crystallographic 
point group P with arithmetic crystal class (P,T") 
arises only the symmorphic space group type. 
Proof: Let P',C' be a regular splitting of O(P,xo)' 
5ince 
P is cyclic and P',C' have only the identity 
operation 
in 
common 
it 
follows 
that there exists at least one 
coset P'W i 
having a symmetry operation 5 
which 
gener-
ates 
P. 
5ince 5 is ~-irreducible it leaves only the 
origin fixed. Therefore, the symmetry support of 
5 
is 
orthogonal 
to every vector v. 
It follows that for any 
shift vector 5, the symmetry operation (5,5) 
generates 
a finite subgroup of G equivalent to P. Thus G is equi-
valent to the symmorphic space group of (p,Tn). 
According to Plesken each ~-irreducible crystallographic 
point 
group 
in dimensions up to n=21 only determines one 
arithmetic crystal class (Ples4). 
The following theorem is due to Schwarzenberger (5chw1), 
and Michel and Mozrzymas (Mich1): 
Theorem 8.8: 
If the crystallographic point 
group 
P 
has 
the 
central inversion -I then for any space group 
G derived from (P,T") the shift vectors 5 
can 
be 
chosen such that s=t/2, t~Tn. 
Proof: 
The 
central 
inversion 
-I leaves only the origin 
fixed. 
Hence, the origin of G can be chosen such 
that 
(-I,O)~G. For any symmetry operation 
(S,s)~G it follows 
that 
(-1,0)(5,5)(-1,0)(5,5)-1= (1,25) 
is a translation which proves theorem 8.8. 
Example 
8.1: 
There 
are 13 arithmetic crystal classes in 
two dimensional space E2 (cf. section 7.4). Considering 
these arithmetic crystal 
classes 
in 
turn 
the 
space 
group 
types 
in 
E2 can be derived. 5pace groups in E2 
are called plane groups. For the plane group types 
the 
nomenclature 
of 
Hermann-Mauguin 
is used (for details

A, Hahn1). 
1. From the arithmetic crystal classes (C 1 ,T2) and (C 2 ,T2) 
only the symmorphic plane groups p1 and p2 respectively 
arise because by theorem 8.6 every plane group 
derived 
from 
these 
classes contains points of symmetry C1 and 
C2 respectively 
hence, 
they 
are 
equivalent 
to 
the 
symmorphic plane groups.

the 
arithmetic crystal classes (C 3 ,T2), (C 4 ,T2),

the

P':=C1' 
C' :=C s • 
We 
determine 
N:=N~(~')nN~(F'). 
The quotient T'/Ti has 
translations 
51:=0, 
52:=~b and 
53:=ia (cf. Figure 7.3). The shift 
vector 51 gives the symmorphic 
plane 
group 
type 
pm. 
Since P' is of index 2 in P it follows that 52:=ib is a 
possible 
shift 
vector giving the plane group type pg. 
The shift vector 53 is orthogonal to 
the 
mirror 
line 
therefore, 
an equivalent mirror line is generated thus 
the derived space group is equivalent to the zero-solu-
tion. 
Similarly, T'/Tt contains the possible shift 
vectors 
51 :=0, 
52:=i(a1-a2). 
The 
shift vector 51 gives the 
symmorphic space group type cm. Because 52 is 
orthogo-
nal 
to the mirror line m it follows that an equivalent 
mirror line is generated hence, the 
space 
group 
thus 
generated is equivalent to the zero-solution. 
4. Two 
arithmetic 
crystal 
classes 
belong 
to C2Y viz.: 
( C 2v , T t) and (C 2 Y , Tl) (c f. Fig u r e 7. 2), The 
cry s tall 0-
graphic 
point group C2Y contains the central inversion 
-I hence, by theorem 8.6 every space group derived from 
C2v contains a subgroup equivalent to C2. Thus we 
only 
have 
to consider the regular splitting P':=C 2 , C':=C s ' 
Both groups P' and C' are normal 
in 
P. 
We 
calculate 
N:=N~CE')nN~(F'). 
The 
qoutient 
group T'/T: has the 
shift vectors 51:=0, 52:=ia, 
53:=ib, 
and 
54:=iCa+b). 
The 
shift 
vector 
51 gives the symmorphic plane group 
type p2mm. 
The shift vectors 52 and 53 are 
equivalent 
under 
the 
normalizer of C2v therefore, they give rise 
to the same space group type p2mg. The shift vector 
54 
gives rise to the plane group type p2gg.

Similarly, 
for 
T'/T/ the possible shift vectors are 
51:=0, 52:=iCa1-a2)' 
The shift vector 
S1 
gives 
the 
symmorphic plane group type c2mm. Because 52 is orthog-
onal to the mirror line m it follows that an equivalent 
mirror 
line 
is 
generated hence. the space group thus 
generated is equivalent to the zero-solution. 
5. Two arithmetic crystal classes 
belong 
to 
Cl v ' 
viz.: 
(Clv,T~) 
and 
(Clv,Tl) 
(cf. Figure 7.4). 
By theorem 
8.6. every plane group 
derived 
from 
Cl v 
oontains 
a 
subgroup 
equivalent to Cl' 
Therefore, we only have to 
consider the regular splitting P':=C l , C':=C •• Only 
Cl 
is normal in Clv ' 
We determine N:=N~(~'). The quotient 
group 
T'/T~ 
has 
shift 
vectors 
51:=0, 
52:=;a1+~a2' 
5l:=~a1+~a2' 
The shift vector 51 gives the 
symmorphic 
plane group p31m. The shift vectors 52 and 5l are equi-
valent 
under 
the 
normalizer 
of Cl v ' None of them is 
compatible 
with 
a 
symmetry 
operation 
of 
order 
2. 
Therefore, 
no further solution results. Similarly, for 
(CJv,Ti) we obtain only the symmorphic plane group type 
p3m1. 
6. We consider the arithmetic crystal class 
CC4v.T2). 
By 
theorem 
8.6, 
every 
plane 
group 
derived 
from 
C4v 
contains a subgroup equivalent to C4' 
Therefore, 
only 
the 
regular splitting P':=C4' C':=C s has to be consid-
ered. 
Only 
C4 
is 
normal 
in 
C4v ' 
We 
determine 
N:=N~(~'). 
The 
quotient 
group 
T'/T2 
has 
the shift 
vectors 51:=0, 52:=i(a1+a2)' The shift vector 51 
gives 
the symmorphic plane group type p4mm. 
The shift vector 
52 gives the plane group type p4gm. 
7. We 
consider 
the arithmetic crystal class (C 6v ,T2). By 
theorem 
8.6, 
every 
plane 
group 
derived 
from 
C6v 
contains 
a 
subgroup equivalent to C6' Therefore. only 
the regular splitting P':=C6' C':=C s has to be 
consid-
ered. 
Only 
C6 
is 
normal 
in 
C6v' 
We 
determine 
N:=N~(~'). The quotient group T'/T2 has only the 
shift 
vector 
51:=0. 
Thus 
only the symmorphic plane group 
type p6mm results. 
The three-dimensional space groups 
were 
determined 
by 
Schonflies 
(Scho2) 
and Fedorov (Fedo3). 
The four-dimen-
sional space 
groups 
were 
determined 
by 
Brown 
et 
ale 
(Brow1). 
The results of these calculations are summerized 
in the following theorem: 

SPACE GROUPS 
165 
Theorem 8.9: 
There exist 2 in 1-dimensional, 17 in 
2-di-
mensional, 
219+11 
in 
3-dimensional and 4783+112 
space group types in 4-dimensional space. 
In spaces of higher dimensions only partial results 
are 
known. 
Schwarzenberger 
has 
investigated 
the 
"primitiv 
orthogonal" and the "primitiv tetragonal" groups 
using 
a 
graphical method (Schw1). 
8.3. 
Normalizers of symmetry groups 
For 
many 
theoretical investigations of symmetry groups 
their normalizers play an important role. 
Definjtion 8.7: 
For a group r with subgroup G the 
norma-
lizer 
of 
G 
in r, Nr(G), is the group of all "ucO:r 
under which G is conjugated to itself, 
The name "normalizer" indicates that the subgroup 
G 
is 
normal 
in Nr(G). 
For most applications the normalizer is 
taken in the Euclidean group ~(n) of all isometries, or in 
the affine group ~Cn) of all affine transformations. 
In section 7.4 use was made of the normalizer No(P) of a 
point 
group 
P 
in 
the 
orthogonal 
group 
OCn) 
of 
all 
rotations. 
Necessarily 
the 
normalizer 
No(P) 
maps 
the 
symmetry scaffolding of P onto itself. However, the stabi-
lizer of the symmetry scaffolding of P in OCn) may 
be 
of 
higher 
order 
than 
NoCP) 
because 
if 
U is an invariant 
subspace of P then U is 
also 
an 
invariant 
subspace 
of 
NoCP). For each "ucO:NoCP), "uP=P"u implies that "uU is an inav-
riant 
subspace of P. 
If the invariant subspaces of Pare 
uniquely determined 
it 
follows 
that 
<pU=U. 
For 
cyclic 
groups U need not belong to the symmetry scaffolding of P. 
The 
normalizers NoCP) of the three-dimensional crystallo-
graphic point groups were determined by Galiulin 
CGali1). 
The 
normalizers 
of the four-dimensional crystallographic 
point groups were determined by Brown (Brow1). 
In 
section 
8.2 
the affine normalizers of space groups 
were used. 
Since space groups in En 
contain 
n 
linearly 
independent 
translations 
it 
follows 
that 
they have no

proper invariant subspace. Therefore, the normalizer of 
a 
space group G in the affine group ~(n) is the group of all 
affine 
mappings ~~~(n) which map the symmetry scaffolding 
of G onto itself. 
This gives a simple 
way 
to 
determine 
the normalizer of a space group.

Example 
8.2: 
We 
consider 
the 
plane group type p4gm. A 
fragment of the symmetry scaffolding of p4gm 
is 
shown 
in Figure 8.2 a). The normalizer

By definition 8.7 the normalizer Nr(G) is defined for an 
individual group 
G 
only. 
In 
general 
the 
normalizers, 
belonging 
to an equivalence class of space groups, do not 
belong to one equivalence class. This is only true if 
the 
equivalence 
class 
of G and the normalizer of G are taken 
in the same group r. Thus for the space groups G;

Following 
Schwarzenberger 
(Schw1) 
there 
exists in each type of space groups a minimal group 
G such that the lattice of each space group equivalent 
to 
G 
has 
at 
least the symmetry of the lattice of G. Now we 
can take out of each type of space groups such

In general, the normalizer of a space 
group 
is 
not 
a 
space 
group. 
It 
may contain 
infinitely small trans-
lations of length c in d linearly independent 
directions. 
The lattice thus generated is denoted by 
Zd or Zd for the 
normalizers of the two- and three-dimensional space groups 
respectively. 
Normalizers of space groups in the affine 
group ~ may also contain point groups of infinite order.

8.4. 
Subgroups of space groups 
For many applications the subgroups G' of a space 
group 
G 
in 
En 
are required. 
We consider for the moment only 
subgroups of finite index that is 
G' 
is 
again 
a 
space 
group 
in 
En (for subgroups of infinite index see section 
8.7). 
Let P'SP be the crystallographic point 
groups 
and 
T'ST 
be 
the lattices of G' and G respectively. Following 
Hermann (Herm2), three 
kinds 
of 
subgroups 
are 
distin-
guished: 
-translation equivalent subgroups with T'=T, 
-class equivalent subgroups with p'=p, 
-general subgroups with T'<T and P'<P. 
The following two theorems are due to Hermann (Herm2): 
Theorem 
8.10: 
For 
each 
space 
group G there exists a 
translation equivalent subgroup H 
such 
that 
any 
subgroup G' of G is a class equivalent subgroup of 
H, 
G' S H S G. 
Proof: The theorem follows from the fact that the subgroup 
H is uniquely determined by G' and T. 
A 
subgroup 
G'<G is called maximal in G if there exists 
no other subgroup G" such that 
G' < G" < G. 
Theorem 8.11: 
Every maximal subgroup G' of a space 
group 
G 
is either translation equivalent or class equi-
valent. 
Proof: 
Because G' is maximal either 
G'<H=G 
class 
equivalent or else G'=H<G then G' 
equivalent. 
8.4.1. Derivation of subgroups 
then 
G' 
is 
is translation 
We now describe a procedure to determine 
the 
subgroups 
of 
a 
space 
group. 
Following Senechal (SeneZ), a space 
group G is written as a union of cosets with respect to T. 

SPACE GROUPS 
171 
and T is written as a union of cosets with respect to T'. 
We 
are 
free 
to choose the shift vectors Si modulo T and 
the lattice vectors Vi modulo T'. 
Combining 
both 
coset 
decompositions yields 
G = 
T' 
U T'CS2,S2) 
U 
U T'CSs'ss ) 
U T'V2 UT'CS2,S2+V2) U 
U T'CSs ,Ss +V2) 
A subgroup G' having crystallographic point group P' and 
lattice 
T' is the union of some of these cosets under the 
conditions that the group is closed under coset 
multipli-
cation and that P' maps the lattice T' onto itself. 
The 
invariance 
of 
T' under P' requires that for every 
Si~P' and each basis vector Sj~T'. j=1 •..•• n. 
Let h' be the order of P'. 
multiplication requires that 
The 
closure 
of 
the 
coset 
where Sk=SiSj' i.j=1 ••••• h'. It follows that 
The 
translation parts on both sides of this equation have 
to be equal up to a translation 
tij~T'. 
Thus 
we 
get 
a 
Frobenius subgroup congruence. 
A similar congruence is set up for each pai~ Si,Sj~P'. 
A 
set of shift vectors 51+v ....... sh+v'" which fulfils all 
h'2 
congruences gives a possible subgroup G'<G. 
From 
a 
group 
theoretic point of view two subgroups G' 
and G" are equivalent if there exists 
an 
affine 
mapping 
~~N~CG) such that

However, if we consider the action of a space group G on a 
regular point system X then two 
subgroups 
G',G"<G 
which 
are 
equivalent 
under 
N~(G) may act differently on X. In 
this case only 
the 
equivalence 
under 
the 
group 
G 
is 
allowed. 
Thus, 
depending on the problem we are treating, 
different definitions of the equivalence of subgroups 
are 
required. Therefore, we may consider the equivalence under

problems usually the equivalence under G is

Each ~~Nr(G) is written as 
From the above congruence it follows that

The

t1i :=C1-SiC1'" .,tni :=Cn-SiCn' 
i=1, ••. ,h', 
generate a lattice T", called the weight lattice of L with 
respect 
to 
P'. 
As 
the above congruence has to be taken 
modulo T' we only need consider vectors t 
in the 
quotient 
group 
T"/T'. Thus the equivalence of two subgroups G' and 
G" can be verified. 
Special care has to be taken if Nr(G) 
has a point group of infinite 
order 
or 
if 
it 
contains 
infinitely small translations. 
The 
number 
of subgroups G' of a space group G is infi-
nite. However, these may be grouped into a 
finite 
number 
of 
series, 
each 
containing 
only 
subgroups of the same 
space group type, which are 
obtained 
by 
increasing 
the 
index 
of 
the 
sublattice T' in T. For a given crystallo-
graphic point group P'<P this requires 
the 
determination 
of 
all 
lattices

which are invariant under P'. Let

The

of

bases belonging to a lattice T' is infinite. They 
all fall into one equivalence class (cf. section 3.2). 
We 
have to restrict the coefficients aij such that 
for 
each 
sUblattice T' only one lattice basis is obtained. This can 
be 
achieved 
by 
considering the transformations into the 
different Bravais lattices belonging to P'. Thereby, 
also 
unconventional 
Bravais 
types 
of lattices occur. Finally 
among all lattices T' thus obtained we have 
to 
determine 
those which are not equivalent under NrCG). 
In what follows we give the necessary transformations to 
obtain 
the 
required sublattices of the three-dimensional

7.1,

The 
groups

are called Laue groups (after the physicist Max von Laue). 
The

8.4.2. Topological characterization of subgroups 
The determination 
of 
subgroups 
requires 
a 
procedure 
which 
allows 
a 
quick 
identification of the space group 
type. Such a procedure should be independent on the choice 
of lattice basis and of the origin. Therefore, only geome-
tric properties of a 
space 
group 
are 
considered 
which 
remain invariant under affine transformations. Thus we get 
a topological characterization of a space group. 
Let G be a space group with point group P and lattice T. 
Properties of G which remain invariant under affine trans-
formations are the order of P and the occurence or absence 
of 
rotations 
or 
screw 
rotations in G. We identify each 
minimax symmetry operation (S; ,Si)(G 
through 
its 
double 
weighted 
symmetry support p;+U, (cf. section 8.1). There-
by, it is 
sufficient 
to 
consider 
only 
those 
symmetry 
supports 
Pi+Ui which have a non-empty intersection with a 
fundamental region F of G. Since F is bounded we obtain 
a 
finite set of symmetry supports. The occuring subspaces Ui 
are 
completely 
determined 
through 
the crystallographic 
point group P. Besides the symmetry supports 
we 
have 
to 
determine their mutual intersections. 
Thereby, for dimen-
sions n>2, also the intersections of the symmetry supports 
of 
screw rotations or glide reflections are needed. More-
over, if a subspace UI has dimension d>1 and screw 
vector 
t; 
then 
the 
orientatin 
of t;, relative to the symmetry 
scaffolding of G, may be important. A similar case 
occurs 
if two symmetry operations, having different screw vectors 
t1 
and tz respectively, belong to'two cosets of the same 
subspace U;. 
Thus a set of distinct 
topological 
proper-
ties 
of 
a 
space 
group can be determined which uniquely 
identifies the space group type. 

SPACE GROUPS 
181 
Example 8.4: We consider 
the 
17 
plane 
group 
types. 
A 
possible 
set 
of 
topological 
properties of the plane 
groups is given in the headline of Table 8.4. For 
each 
plane group type the occurence or absence of a property 
is 
indicated 
by 
1 
or 0 in the corresponding column. 
Thus every plane group type is 
uniquely 
characterized 
through a binary bit string of length 9.

Crystallographic orbits 
Orbits of symmetry groups were defined in 
section 
8.1. 
Particularly an orbit generated by a space group is called 
a 
crystallographic 
orbit 
because of its discrete nature 
and its periodicity. In section 7.5 we investigated orbits 
of crystallographic point groups. 
These 
were 
classified 
according to their adjoint crystal forms. In a similar way 
we now classify crystallographic orbits. 
8.5.1. Classifications of crystallographic orbits 
In 
n-dimensional Euclidean space En we consider a crys-
tallographic orbit O(G,xo). The space group 
G 
is 
called 
the 
generating 
space 
group and the point Xo is called a 
representing point 
of 
the 
crystallographic 
orbit. 
Let 
St(xo)<G 
be 
the 
stabilizer 
of the point Xo in G. Equi-
valent points XjE:O(G,xo), 
Xj:=(S"Sj)xo, 
have 
conjugate 
stabilizers in G, 
St (x i ) = (5 i ,5 i ) St (x 0) C 5 j ,5 j ) - 1, C 5; ,5 j )( G. 
In the International Tables, Vol. A, the crystallograph-
ic 
orbits 
of a space group G are classified according to 
the stabilizer of the representing point in the 
following 
way: 
Definition 8.8: 
The set of all points y which have conju-
gate 
stabilizers 
StCy) 
in G is called a Wyckoff 
position, if conjugation is 
taken 
in 
G. 
It 
is 
called 
a 
Wyckoff set, if conjugation is taken in 
the affine normalizer N~(G). 
The above definition can be visulized if we consider the 
symmetry support Po+Uo of 
StCxo). 
The 
subspace 
Uo 
has 
dimension 
d, 
O~d~n. 
We identify a Wyckoff position or a 
Wyckoff set with the set of all 
symmetry 
supports 
PI+Uj 
which are equivalent to Po+Uo under G or N~CG) respective-
ly. 
Wyckoff positions or 
lographic 
orbits 
of 
ordered pairs (G,W) of 
belonging to G. 
Wyckoff sets only classify crystal-
one 
space 
group. 
We now consider 
a space group G and a Wyckoff set W 

184 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
Definition 8.9: 
Two ordered pairs (G1,W1) and (G2,W2) are 
called equivalent and belong to the same 
type 
of 
Wyckoff 
sets if there is an affine mapping ~€~(n) 
which maps G1 onto G2 and simultaneously 
maps 
W1 
onto W2 , 
Because of physical reasons it may be useful to consider 
only 
affine mappings 
~+ of the special affine group ~+(n) 
which conserve the chirality of a crystallographic orbit. 
In three-dimensional space the 
types 
of 
Wyckoff 
sets 
were 
determined by Koch and Fischer (Koch2) by inspection 
of the space group Table. The results 
are 
summerized 
in 
the following theorem: 
Theorem 8.13: 
There exist 3 in 1-dimensional, 51 in 2-di-
mensional 
and 
1128+29 
types 
of Wyckoff sets in 
3-dimensional space. 
Each crystallographic orbit 
corresponds 
to 
a 
regular 
point system XCEn. 
The types of Wyckoff sets do not clas-
sify regular point systems because a certain regular point 
system 
X 
may 
be 
generated 
from 
points 
belonging 
to 
different types of Wyckoff sets. 
A classification of 
the 
set 
of all regular point systems is obtained by consider-
ing the stabilizer of X in the Euclidean group ~(n) of all 
isometries. By definition 1.3 the stabilizer of X in 
~(n) 
is 
a 
space group called the eigensymmetry space group of 
X. The stabilizer G5 
of a crystallographic 
orbit 
OCG,xo) 
may be a supergroup of the generating space group G, 
Gs~G. 
A 
crystallographic orbit is called characteristic or non-
characteristic with respect to G if Gs=G or 
Gs>G 
respec-
tively. 
Each regular point system X can be assigned to a 
stabilizer Gs and a unique Wyckoff set Ws in Gs • 
Definition 8.10: 
Two regular point systems X1 and X2 with 
stabilizers 
and 
Wyckoff 
sets 
(G s1 'W s1 ) 
and 
(G s2 'W s2 ) 
respectively 
are called e~uivalent and 
belong to the same orbit type~f theri exists 
an 
affine 
mapping 
~~~(n) which maps Gs 1 onto Gs 2 and 
simultaneously maps Ws 1 onto Ws 2' 
A still finer classification of crystallographic 
orbits 
is 
obtained 
if we consider their topological properties. 
We define the topology of a regular point system X through 

SPACE GROUPS 
185 
its Dirichlet domain partition ecf. sections 2.1 
to 
2.3, 
and 
9.2). 
In 
complete 
analogy to definition 7.5 this 
allows us to classify regular point systems in topological 
types of orbits. Results on 
Dirichlet 
domain 
partitions 
will be given in section 9.2. 
8.5.2. Determination of crystallographic orbits 
In order to determine the non-characteristic orbits of a 
space 
group 
G 
an 
analogous 
procedure, as described in 
section 7.5, can be applied. 
Let OeG,xo) be a non-charac-
teristic orbit with stabilizer Gs>G of index k. 
Suppose 
the point Xo has stabilizer Stexo) in G and stsexo) in Gs • 
The ratio of the orders of Sts(xo) and of Stexo) has to be 
equal to the index k, 
k. 
(8.5) 
Istexo) I 
because 
otherwise 
the 
stabilizer Gs would generate more 
points than are contained in 
OeG,xo). 
Thus 
the 
special 
Wyckoff 
positions 
Ws 
in 
the stabilizer Gs which fulfil 
equation 8.5 are solutions for 
non-characteristic 
orbits 
of 
G. 
Among the infinite number of supergroups of G we 
have to find the stabilizers Gs of O(G,xo). 
This 
can 
be 
done 
in 
the following way: If there exists another space 
group G' between G and Gs ' 
G<G'<G s ' 
then 
OeG',xo) 
must 
also 
have the stabilizer Gs since OCGs'xo) does not split 
into two orbits when going from Gs to G. 
Hence, 
if 
no 
special 
Wyckoff 
position 
exists 
in 
G' which satisfies 
equation 8.5 then G' and any supergroup G">G' cannot be 
a 
stabilizer 
of 
OeG,xo). Therefore, all solutions for non-
characteristic orbits of G are already 
contained 
in 
the 
minimal 
supergroups G' of G. From theorem 8.11 it follows 
that every minimal supergroup G' 
is 
either 
class 
equi-
valent 
or 
translation 
equivalent to G. 
If G' is trans-
lation equivalent then the index k' of G' in G is less 
or 
equal 
to 
p, 
where 
p is the largest prime factor in the 
order h of the crystallographic point group P of G. If 
G' 
is 
class 
equivalent 
then 
k'$h/ISt(xo)l. 
Thus ~nly a 
finite number of supergroups 
have 
to 
be 
considered 
in 
order 
to 
find 
all 
non-characteristic orbits of G. 
The 
range of supergroups 
can 
be 
further 
restricted 
if 
we 
compare 
the 
affine normalizers of G and G'. We determine 
the intersection

If 
N=N~(G) 
then 
we 
find 
in G' all solutions which are 
equivalent under 
N~(G). 
However, if N<N~(G) with index 
v 
then we have to consider also supergroups conjugated under 
N~(G). 
We determine the coset decomposition of N~(G) with 
respect to N, 
U PvN. 
The 
required 
conjugated 
supergroups 
are 
given 
by 
G'j:=pjG'pj1, 
j=2, ... ,v. 
If 
several 
supergroups 
G'i' 
i=1, ... ,m, 
have 
a 
common supergroup G" then we find all 
solutions in G" 
by 
intersecting 
the 
solutions 
in 
G~, 
i=1, ... ,m. 
Finally the stabilizer Gs of X is the highest 
supergroup which still contains a solution for X. 
Usually 
there 
are 
several 
paths 
from 
the space group G to the 
stabilizer Gs • It is sufficient to determine one. 
Example 8.4: We consider the plane group p2mg. The 
stand-
ard 
setting 
of 
the 
International 
Table, Vol. A, is 
assumed. The required group-supergroup relations 
which 
lead to the non-characteristic orbits of p2mg are shown 
in 
Figure 
8.3. 
The 
supergroups are given with the 
Hermann-Mauguin symbol followed, between 
brackets, 
by 
the 
origin 
and 
the 
basi5 
vectors, 
referred to the 
original plane group p2mg. Beneath each supergroup 
are 
listed 
the 
solutions 
for 
non-characteristic 
orbits 
according to the Wyckoff positions of p2mg. Each set of 
solutions is followed by the symbol of the Wyckoff 
set 
in 
the 
supergroup. 
The affine normalizer of p2mg is 
p2mm[ta,tbl. 
We determine the intersection 
Since N<N~(p2mg) of index 
2 
we 
determine 
the 
coset 
decopmosition 
of N~(2pmg) with respect to N and obtain 
as a coset representative P2:=ib. 
Similarly, we 
deter-
mine 
N : = N'A ( p 2 m g) n N'A ( p 6 m m [ a , - a' 1) = c 2 m m [ a , b 1 , 
where 
a·=~(a-b). 
N is of index 2 in N~(p2mg) and we 
obtain P2:=ib as a coset representative. 
In the plane E2 only 13 
out 
of 
17 
plane-group 
types

as 
stabilizers

correspond to Sohncke's 13 construction types (Sohn2). The

8.5.3. Determination of congruent crystallographic orbits 
For a given crystallographic orbit OCG,xo) we now deter-

exists

teristic in G, Gs=G, then we obtain all congruent crystal-
lographic orbits through the application of the 
Euclidean 
normalizer N~CG). We determine the coset decomposition 
N~CG) = G u P2 G u 
Since N~CG) contains all isometries which map the symmetry 
scaffolding 
of 
G 
onto 
itself it follows that the coset 
representatives Pi' i=2, ••• ,k, give all congruent crystal-
lographic orbits 
OCG,yo;) 
with 
YOi:=PiXO' 
However, 
if 
OCG,xo) 
is 
non-characteristic with stabilizer Gs1 >G then 
additional congruent crystallographic orbits may occur. We

8.5.4. Principal points of space groups 
A crystallographic

O(G,xo) 
is 
called 
a 
point 
lattice 
if 
all 
of 
its points are translationally equi-
valent under some space group Gs~G. The point 
lattice 
is 
called 
a 
real point lattice if its points are equivalent 
under the translations of the generating 
point 
group 
G. 
Otherwise 
it 
is called an apparent point lattice. It was 
shown by Nowacki (Nowa4) that in 
three-dimensional 
space 
groups, except of those of type P4 1 32 (P4332) at least one 
real 
or 
apparent 
point 
lattice exists. 
Points which 
generate a point lattice in a space 
group 
G are 
called 
principal points in the sense of Fedorov. 
We consider a space group G with point 
group 
P. 
Let 
P'<G be a maximal point group of G such that P' determines 
a regular splitting of O(P,xo) (cf. section 8.2). 
Follow-
ing 
Weissenberg P' is called a principal point group of G 
CWeis3). Let U be the symmetry support of Pl. A point xoE:U 
is called a pricipal point of G in the sense 
of 
Weissen-
berg.

Colour groups and colourings 
8.6.1. Colour groups 
In

tively, 
M: = {~1 '~2 , ••• } , 
such 
that

The concept of a symme-

be 
extended

considering 
ordered

The action of the

Suppose 
the

the colour C1 unchanged. In general each of the m differ-
ent

The permutations Pea) give a representation of H by permu-
tations. 
The group of permutations is a homomorphic image 
of H. 
Thus each colour group is determined by an 
ordered 
pair (H,H') of a group and a subgroup. 
Definition 
8.12: 
Two colour groups (H 1 ,H;) and (H 2 ,Hi) 
are equivalent and belong to th! same ~blour-group 
type if 
there 
exists 
an 
affine 
transformation 
~~~(n) 
which 
maps 
H1 onto H2 and simultaneously 
maps 
H~ onto Hi,

we,e determined by Harker (Hark1). In Table 8.7 are listed 
the 
numbers 
of colour-group types of the plane groups up 
to subgroups of index 15. They were determined 
by 
Jarrat 
and 
Schwarzenberger (Jarr1). A few corrections were added 
and the list was extended to subgroups up to index 
60 
by 
Wieting (Wiet1). The 1191 colour-group types of the three-
dimensional 
space groups with subgroups of index two were 
determined by Zamorzaev (Zamo1). Harker enumerated the 423 
colour-group types with subgroups of index 3 (Hark2). 
8.6.2. Perfect colourings 
In most 
works 
cited 
above 
only 
colour 
groups 
were 
considered 
but 
not colourings. 
Perfect colourings were 
discussed by Senechal (Sene3). It was already mentioned in 
section 8.4, that two subgroups of a space group 
G 
which 
are equivalent under 
N~(G) may act differently on a set M. 
Therefore, in order to determine different colourings of M 
we may have to consider the equivalence of subgroups under 
H. 
Moreover 
the 
stabilizers 
of 
the uncoloured and the 
coloured set M have 
to 
be 
compared. 
Let 
Hs~H 
be 
the 
stablizer 
of the uncoloured set M. 
We consider an ordered 
pair (Hs,H') of a group Hs and a subgroup H' of 
index 
k. 
The 
left 
coset 
decomposition 
of 
Hs with respect to H' 
becomes 
where P1 is the identity operation. Under H' 
the 
objects 
~;=P;~1' i=1, .•. ,k, belong in general to different transi-
tivity 
classes. 
Let 
Sts(~;)<Hs 
and St'(~;)<H' be the 
stabilizers of the objects ~;~M in Hs and H' 
respectively 
with 
St'(~;)~St,,(~;) of index 1;. If we require that each 
object ~;~M has only one colour and that H' 
acts 
transi-
tively 
on 
the objects of the same colour then it follows 
that 1; of the cosets pjH' must 
correspond 
to 
the 
same 
colour 
hence, 
the 
number 
m of different colours in the 
perfect colouring of M becomes 
k 
m = 
~ 1/1; 
(8.6) 
;= 1 
Using m different 
colours 
C1'" "C m 
we 
perform 
the 
colouring 
of 
M and 
determine 
the 
stabilizer 
of 
the 
coloured set. 
The colour-group type assigned to M is 
the 
ordered 
pair 
(Hs,H~). 
In 
general 
we 
consider 
two 
colourings of M, 
(Hs,H~1) and 
(Hs,H~2) as different if H~~ 
and H~2 are not equival~nt under Hs.'

Example 8.5: A black-white tessellation is shown in Figure 
8.6. 
The 
stabilizer of the tessellation is p4gm, if 
uncoloured,

c2mmla,b),

coloured. 
Two

perfect 
black-white

are 
possible 
having

both 
of index 8. 
Since 1;=4, for i=1, ..• ,8, it follows from 

SPACE GROUPS 
195 
Figure 8.6. Mosaic in the Roman thermae at Nora (Sardinia) 
equation 
8.6 that the number of colours is m=2. 
There 
are other remarkable features in this tessellation. 
It 
is tile-, 
edge-, and vertex-transitive. Moreover, the 
stabilizer of the set of all vertices is 
a 
supergroup 
of 
p4gm viz.: 
p4mml~(a-b,,~(a+b)1. It is this super-
group which, in this case, determines 
the 
equivalence 
of the colourings. 
We 
note 
that 
for 
the 
related chessbord 9 perfect 
black-white colourings 
are 
possible. 
Thereby, 
two 
colourings 
which 
differ only by a change of black and 
white are considered to be equivalent. 
It 
is 
a 
nice 
exercise to find these 9 perfect colou~ings. 
8.7. 
Sybperjodjc groups 
We now leave the concept of a discontinuum and 
consider 
more 
general 
symmetry groups. 
A symmetry group in n-di-
mensional space En is called a 
subperiodic 
group 
if 
it 
contains 
less 
than 
n linearly independent translations. 
Following Bohm (Bohm1', we denote 
subperiodic 
groups 
by 
the symbol

Historical remarks 
Space 
groups 
with 
proper 
motions 
only -
those which 
conserve the chirality of an object 
-
were 
investigated 
first 
by 
the 
mathematician 
Camille 
Jordan (1838-1922) 
(Jord1). Using the results of Jordan, Sohncke later deter-
mined in a 
systematic 
way 
the 
54+11 
three-dimensional 

SPACE GROUPS 
199 
space-group types with proper motions only. (The 
notation 
54+11 
indicates 
that 
there 
are 
11 enatiomorphic pairs 
which are mirror images of each other). Originally Sohncke 
listed one space-group 
type 
twice. 
Soon 
however, 
it 
became 
evident 
that 
also improper motions are important 
such as mirror planes, glide planes, 
and 
rotoinversions, 
which change the chirality of a molecule within a crystal. 
This was emphasized in 1885 by Pierre Curie (Curi1) and in 
1887 
by 
Leonhard 
Wulff 
(Wulf1). 
This 
latter work led 
Sohncke to extend his theory on crystal structure 
(Sohn4) 
but he did not complete the enumeration of all space-group 
types. 
In 
the 
meantime 
Fedorov, 
using 
the results of 
Sohncke, derived 218+11 space-group 
types. 
Independently 
the 
mathematician 
Schonflies, 
prompted 
by Felix Klein, 
obtained 216+11 space-group types. 
Only 
after 
comparing 
their 
results 
the 
correct 
number of 219+11 space-group 
types was established (Scho3). 
In 
subsequent 
years 
the 
space 
groups 
were 
again 
derived 
by 
William 
Barlow 
(1845-1934) (BarI1). 
The 
interesting 
history 
of 
the 
discovery 
of the space groups was described by Burckhardt 
(Burc3). 
The regular point systems in the plane were investigated 
by Sohncke in 1874 in a purely geometric way without using 
group theory. He found 13 
different 
construction 
types. 
These correspond exactly to the 13 types of stabilizers of 
regular 
point 
systems 
in the plane. By specializing the 
construction conditions Sohncke also 
found 
all 
possible 
orbit 
types in the plane. These results are summerized in 
Table 8.5. 
In 1891 Fedorov derived 
the 
17 
plane-group 
types 
from 
the 
three-dimensional 
space groups (Fed04). 
This result remainded unknown and in 1924 the 
plane-group 
types were again determined by Georg Polya (Poly1). 
In 
1900 
the 
mathematician 
David 
Hilbert (1862-1943) 
presented ten of his 23 unsolved problems at the 
interna-
tional 
mathematical 
congress in Paris. In the first part 
of the 18 th problem Hilbert asked whether, in n-dimension-
al Euclidean space, only a finite number of non-isomorphic 
space 
groups 
with 
finite 
fundamental 
region 
exists 
(Hilb1). 
In 
1910 
Ludwig 
Bieberbach proved that for any 
dimension this number is finite (Bieb1) and in 1911 Ferdi-
nand Georg Frobenius (1849-1917) showed that the number of 
space groups 
which 
are 
not 
affine-equivalent 
is 
also 
finite (Frob1). Finally Bieberbach proved that in n-dimen-
sional 
space 
non-affine 
space 
groups are also non-iso-
morphic (Bieb2)' 

200 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
The methods used by Frobenius and Bieberbach were futher 
developed by 
Johann 
Jakob 
Burckhardt 
in 
a 
series 
of 
papers, 
and 
in 
his 
influencel 
book (aurc1, Burc2). An 
analogous algorithm was also developed by Hans 
Zassenhaus 
(Zass1). The application of group extensions to the deter-
mination of space .groups was developed by Edgar Ascher and 
Alois Janner (Asch1, Asch2). 
The 
investigation 
of four-dimensional space groups was 
started in 1930 by Heinrich Heesch (Hees1) while 
investi-
gating 
three-dimensional 
black-white groups. 
In 1978 a 
complete 
list 
of 
the 
4789+112 
four-dimensional 
space 
groups 
was 
achieved by Harold Brown, Rolf BUlow, Joachim 
NeubUser, Hans Wondratschek, and Hans Zassenhaus (Brow1). 
Crystallographic orbits were investigated by Paul Niggli 
who 
synonymously 
used 
the 
term 
"lattice 
complex" 
(Nigg1,Nigg2). 
A 
systematic 
investigation of crystallo-
graphic orbits was done by Hans Wondratschek (Wond2). 
The 
concept of lattice complex was developed 
in 
a 
different 
way by several authors (cf. Burz1). 
Coloured 
plane 
tessellations 
can 
be found already in 
ancient civilisations. 
Particularly the ancient 
Agyptian 
and 
Islamic 
culture have a very rich ornamental art (the 
reader is referred to Jone1). In our century the 
ornamen-
tal 
art 
was revived again by the Dutsch artist Mauritius 
Cornelius Escher (1898-1972) whom we 
owe 
many 
beautiful 
tessellations 
(Erns1,Fuij1). 
The 
term 
"black-white" 
groups was introduced by L. Weber in 1929 
(Webe1). 
The 
generalization 
to more than two colours and the theory of 
colour groups was published in 1956 by 
the 
mathematician 
Andreas 
Speiser (1885-1970). Uncorrectly this development 
is often attributed to 
van 
der 
Waerden 
and 
Burckhardt 
(Waer2). 
Indepentently 
polycolour 
symmetry 
was 
also 
investigated by N. V. Belov and E. N. Belova (Belo1). 
Examples for subperiodic groups are frequent in 
ancient 
ornamental art. 
The border groups were derived in 1926 by 
Paul Niggli. 

9. Space Partitions 
The 
investigation of space partitions permits us to get 
a better insight into the discontinuum. The most important 
result of this chapter will be 
the 
regularity 
condition 
which is discussed in section 9.4. 
9.1. 
Definitions 
9.1.1. Space partition 
In 
Euclidean 
space En we consider a family of n-dimen-
sional tiles 
{Tv I vE:I}, 
where each tile Tv is a bounded closed subset of Euclidean 
space, TvCEn, and I is an infinite set of indices. 
Definition 9.1: 
A fa mil y 
0 f til e s { Tv I vt: I }, i s 
c a.ll e d 
a 
space partition 
1. if the union of all tiles fills space complete-
ly, 
2. if the intersection of the interiors of any two 
tiles is empty 
intTI n intTj = 0, i¢j. 
Following GrUnbaum and Shephard (GrUn2), the space parti-
tion is called monohedral if all its tiles are directly or 
mirror congruent to a prototile To. It is called isohedral 
if there exists a space group G which acts transitively on 
the tiles. Synonymous to isohedral also regular or homoge-
neous 
is used. 
An isohedral space partition necessarily 
is monohedral. A space partition is called face-to-face if 
the intersection of any two tiles is 
either 
empty 
or 
a 
d-face 
of 
each. 
It 
is called normal if there exist two 
balls, B1 of radius P1>O, and B2 of finite radius P2 
such 
201 

202 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
that 
for 
each 
tile 
Tv it holds that B1CTvCB2' From the 
definition of a space group (cf. section 1.4) 
it 
follows 
that an isohedral space partition 
is 
normal. 
A 
space 
partition 
is 
called locally finite if around every point 
in En there exists a ball of radius p>O which is part only 
of a finite

9.1.3. Characterization of polytopes 
In the topological morphology of polytopes each polytope 
is 
characterized 
by 
its 
hierarchical 
structure 
(cf. 
section 2.4). Metrical properties such as the d-dimension-
al volume of a d-face. or the dihedral angles between 
the 
facets are not considered. 
Definjtion 
9.2: 
Two polytopes P1 and P2 in n-dimensional 
space are called isomorphic and belong to the same 
combinatorial type if P1 and 
P2 
have 
isomorphic 
hierarchical structures. 
The 
isomorphism 
of 
two polytopes is not easily recog-
nized. In what follows a sequence of gradually finer clas-
sifications is given. 
A rough classification of a polytope is obtained by 
the 
numbers Nd of d-faces. d=O •.••• n. 
A 
finer 
classification is obtained by the d-subordina-
tion symbol. d=1 •••.• n. 
Let M:={F1 ••..• F~} be the set 
of 
d-faces of a polytope P. The d-subordination symbol 
gives 
the 
numbers 
m, 
of 
those d-faces FjEM which have 
subordinated fl (d-1)-faces. i=1 ••••• k. 
It follows 
that 
the number Nd of d-faces is given by

In a similar way we define the d-superordination symbol, 
d=O, ... ,n-1,

where 
m; 
is 
the number of those d-faces Fj~M which have 
superordinated f; (d+1)-faces, i=1, .•• ,1. 
The numbers Nd of d-faces of a polytope are connected by 
Euler's relation (Eule1). 
In three-dimensional· space this 
relation is given by

A 
unique classification of a polytope P is given by the 
unified polytope scheme. It is obtained 
by 
labeling 
the 
d-faces 
of 
a polytope in a unified way. 
Thereby, we use 
the fact that there 
exists 
a 
partial 
order 
among 
the 
elements of a polytope and that each (n-2)-face is exactly 
contained 
in 
two 
facets (cf. section 2.4). 
For d>1 the 
(d-1)-faces F;, ... ,F k,F k + 1 =F; contained in ad-face F 
can 
be cyclically ordered by the condition that for i=1, .•• ,k, 
F';nFi+1=Fi', where F'i is a (d-2)-face of F. We say ad-face 
to be ordered or unordered jf its subordinated (d-1)-faces 
are cyclically ordered or not. An ordered pair (F'eF) of a 
(d-1)-face 
F' contained in ad-face F is called a d-flag. 
The unified labeling of a polytope P is proposed with 
the 
following algorithm: 
1. We choose among the facets of P which contain the larg-
est 
numbers 
of (n-2)-faces a (n-1)-flag, say (F;CF1)' 
where the labeling shall start, together with the sense 
of the cyclic enumeration. 
The (n-2)-faces 
contained 
in 
F1 are labeled in cyclic order and the cycle for F1 
is written down. 
2. The enumeration continues in that unordered facet which 
contains 
the 
(n-2)-face 
with 
the 
smallest 
number. 
Starting 
from 
this 
(n-2)-face, 
but 
in 
the oposite 
sense, the cyclic labeling is p~rformed and 
the 
cycle 
is 
written down. Thereby, those (n-2)-faces which were 
not 
labeled 
priviously 
are 
labeled 
by

Finally 
the

3. Suppose the d-faces F1 , ••• ,FNd 
have been 
labeled. 
The 
enumeration of the (d-1)-faces F' is performed for each 
F;. 
i=1, ••. ,N d • 
We choose as starting d-flag (F~CFI) 
such that for 
F~=FinFj' j is minimal. 
Given 
F~, 
the 
sense 
of 
the 
cyclic enumeration is determined by the 
condition that for F~+1=F.nFk' k is 
minimal. 
Now 
the 
(d-1)-faces of F; are labeled in cyclic order. Thereby, 
those (d-1)-faces which were not labeled prevjously are 
labeled 
by 
successive 
numbers. 
The cycle for F, is 
written down. 
4. Step 3 is repeated until the edges (1-faces) have 
been 
labeled. This completes the polytope scheme. 
We recall 
that each edge contains exactly two vertices. Since the 
sense of enumeration in each cycle is given, every edge 
has 
a relative orientation with respect to that cycle. 
Thus relative to a cycle one vertex of every 
edge 
can 
be 
uniquely 
assigned 
as 
the first vertex. The first 
vertices of each edge 
are 
now 
labeled 
in 
the 
same 
cyclic 
order as the edges. Thereby, a vertex which was 
not labeled 
priviously 
is 
labeled 
by 
a 
successive 
number. 
5. The polytope scheme thus obtained depends only upon the 
starting 
(n-1)-flag 
and 
the 
sense of cyclic enumer-
ation. 
In o~der to make the polytope scheme unique 
we 
write 
down 
the schemes for each (n-1)-flag and both 
directions 
of 
cyclic 
enumeration. 
but 
only 
those 
schemes 
are 
retained 
which 
have 
the longest second 
cycle. Amongst these all those with the 
longest 
third 
cycle 
and 
further 
with 
the 
longest 
ith 
cycle are 
retained. 
Amongst the remaining schemes one is 
chosen 
wherein a smaller number first occurs. 
With 
this 
algorithm 
a 
unique 
polytope scheme can be 
assigned to each convex 
polytope. 
Two 
isomorphic 
types 
yield 
always the same scheme. If the sense of enumeration 
is defined. enantiomorphic 
polytopes 
are 
distinguished. 
If 
both 
directions 
of 
enumeration 
are considered. the 
number of equal polytope schemes corresponds to the 
order 
of 
the 
automorphism 
group 
aut(P) 
of 
the hierarchical 
structure of P. 

20() 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
The unified polytope 
scheme 
allows 
us 
to 
order 
the 
elements 
of 
P. We say F'<F if in the polytope scheme the 
cycle of F' is situated after the cycle of F. 
For two-dimensional 
polygons 
the 
polytope 
scheme 
is 
trivial. 
The combinatorial type is uniquely characterized 
by the number of edges of a polygon. 
The polytope schemes for three-dimensional polyhedra are 
easily set up. 
In spaces of higher dimensions 
the 
poly-
topes 
have 
a 
large 
number 
of 
elements therefore, the 
application of this algorithm is limited, even 
for 
large 
computers. 
Compared 
to 
the two- and three-dimensional 
space little is known on polytopes in 
higher 
dimensions. 
In Table 9.1 are listed the numbers of combinatorial types 
of 
three-dimensional 
polyhedra 
with 
up 
to 
11

9.1.4. Characterization of space partitions 
The combinatorial type of stereotopes, in general, 
does 
not 
determine 
the 
type 
of space partition. There exist 
stereotopes congruent copies of which can 
fill 
space 
in 
infinite 
many 
different 
ways. 
Even if we require the 
space partition to be isohedral, then different 
types 
of 
space partitions are possible. In the plane, using a brick 
with 
edge ratio 1:2 as a prototile, 9 different isohedral 
tessellations 
can 
be 
obtained 
which 
are 
shown 
in 
Figure 9.2, 
a-i. 
Thereby, 
tessellations 
which 
are 
obtained by interchanging the short with the long edge 
of 
the brick are not considered as different.

of 
an

face-to-face

partition. In order to obtain a topo-
logical characterization of 
such

we 
propose an adjacency scheme with the following algorithm:

Po in FOil PonPj=F o;. By NCF o;) we denote the number of 
such stereotopes. 
2. To 
make 
this 
adjacency scheme unique we have also to 
consider the automorphism groups autCP o ) 
and 
autCP j ). 
We 
require that NCF01) is maximal. Among the remaining 
schemes we retain those with maximal NCF02) etc. Second 
we require that the labels of all faces Fj assigned 
to 
FOI are minimal for i=1, ... ,v. 
This 
algorithm allows us to classify isohedral face-to-
face space partitions according to their topological 
type 
with the following definition. 
Definition 
9.3: 
Two isohedral face-to-face space parti-
tions T and T' are isomorphic and

to

type

T~T' such that for T;ET, it holds that 
T; and ~CTi) have identical 
polytope 
shemes 
and 
adjacency shemes. 
We note that the adjacency scheme does not determine the 
isohedral 
type, that is, the type of stabilizer Gs of the 
space partition. In general, under a 
continuous 
deforma-
tion of the space partition also the stablilizer Gs chang-
es. 
A 
finer 
classification 
is obtained if we consider the 
stabilizer Gs of the space partition and the way 
Gs 
acts 
on the tiles.

Dirichlet domain partitions 
The 
construction 
of the Dirichlet domains of a regular 
point system in Euclidean space En 
is 
a 
very 
efficient 
method 
to 
obtain isohedral face-to-face space partitions 
which are of particular interest in crystallography. 
9.2.1. Dirichlet domain partitions in the plane E2 
The isohedral face-to-face tessellations in the plane E2 
are well known. An important property is 
reveald 
by 
the 
following theorem due to Reinhardt (Rein1). 
Theorem 
9.1: 
In a normal face-to-face tessellation in E2 
with stereogons, all of 
which 
are 
of 
the 
same 
combinatorial 
type, only three-, four-, five-, or 
six-gons are possible. 
Proof: Let p be the number of edges of a stereogon. Clear-
ly p~3. We determine the least upper bound 
for 
p. 
By 
the 
normal condition, there exist two fixed radii, P1' 
Pz. 
For any circle 51 in E2 of radius vpz we denote by 
a v the number of all stereogons which intersect 51 
and 
by 
AvaIl 
stereogons which lie in the interior of S1 
but do not touch 51. It follows that 

210 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
< 
-+ 0, 
for 11 
.. 00. 
Hence, the topological properties of 
the 
tessellation 
are 
determined by the stereogons in the interior of S1 
only, as 11 goes to infinity. 
From this, 
and 
because 
the 
tessellation 
is face-to-face, it follows that the 
corresponding edge graph fulfils Euler's relation, 
Every edge belongs 
exactly 
to 
two 
stereogons, 
having p vertices hence, 
each 
The 
number 
of vertices in an edge graph is maximal if 
in every vertex exactly three edges meet. 
Since 
every 
edge has two vertices it follows that in this case 
Substitution of No and N1 in Euler's relation gives 
From this follows that p=6(1-2/N2). For N2-+00 the result 
p=6 follows which proves the theorem. 
The normal condition in theorem 9.1 is essential because 
each 
face-to-face 
tessellation in the plane with p-gons, 
where p>6, necessarily is not 
normal 
as 
was 
proved 
by 
Laves (Lave2). 
Remarkably 
theorem 
9.1 
does 
not require an isohedral 
tessellation. 
However, for the derivation of the topolog-
ical types of tessellations we replace the 
normal 
condi-
tion 
by the stronger isohedral condition in order to keep 
their number finite. 
The adjacency scheme 
for 
a 
plane 
tessellation T is trivial. Let Po be a stereogon of T. 
It 
is 
sufficient to specify for each vertex Vf~PO the number 
N(Vi) of stereogons P j for which PjnPO=Vi. 
We 
note 
that 
the 
number 
of 
stereogons meeting in VI is N(Vi)+3. 
The 
adjacency scheme has the form 

SPACE PARTITIONS 
211 
In order to get a complete 
description 
of 
the 
type 
of 
tessellation the adjacency scheme is extended by the poly-
tope scheme (cf. section 9.1.3). Thus we obtain 
piN (v 1 ) -N (v 2) - ••• -N (vp ) . 
We 
call 
a 
stereotope 
in 
En maximal, if it cannot be 
derived from another stereotope in En by 
reduction 
proc-
esses. 
A 
primitive 
stereotope in the sense of Voronoi 
(cf. Definition 3.4) necessarily is maximal. 
The topological types of isohedral face-to-face 
tessel-
lations 
in 
the 
plane 
E2 
can 
be determined using this 
concept of maximal stereogons as follows: 
1. In the plane E2 there exists 
one 
maximal 
topological 
type 
of 
isohedral 
face-to-face 
tessellation, 
viz.: 
610-0-0-0-0-0 (cf. Figure 9.3,1). 
This 
type 
allows 
several different isohedral face-to-face tessellations. 
Actually, 
every centrosymmetric hexagon is a primitive 
parallelogon. In space partitions of higer 
dimensional 
spaces 
the 
maximal 
stereotopes, 
in general, are not 
primitive parallelotopes and they not necessarily allow 
an isohedral tiling. 
2. All the other topological types of 
isohedral 
face-to-
face 
tessellations 
having 
stereogons with less edges 
can be obtained by edge reduction, that is, an edge E;j 
is shrunk up until both subordinated vertices v; and Vj 
fall together. 
Thereby, 
both 
stereogons 
which 
are 
adjacent 
to 
E;j 
are 
reduced 
by 
one edge. 
By the 
valence V(v;), we denote the number of edges meeting in 
v; . 
The 
valence 
of 
the 
new 
vertex 
becomes 
V(v; )+V(vj)-2. 
In order to obtain the reduced types we 
can 
make 
either single edge reductions such that each 
p-gon is reduced to a (p-1)-gon, or else 
we 
can 
make 
simultaneous edge reductions such that a complex of one 
or 
several 
stereogons, 
at 
a 
time, 
shrinks up to a 
vertex. Thereby, all p-gons P j 
which share an edge with 
this complex are reduced to (p-1)-gons. 
The 
isohedral 
condition 
requires 
that 
each 
stereogon P;~T has the 
same adjacency scheme. This poses 
severe 
restrictions 
on the possible edge reductions. 
Example 9.1: 
We derive the 11 topological types of isohe-
dral face-to-face tessellations in the plane E2. 
From 
the maximal type 610-0-0-0-0-0 we obtain by single edge 
reduction 
the 
types 511-0-1-0-0 and 511-1-0-0-0 shown 
in Figures 9.3,h,i. By reduction of hexagons we get the

reduction 
the 
type 
411-1-1-1 (Figure 9.3,e). We note 
that the reduction of pentagons does not 
result 
in 
a 
monohedral 
tessellation. 
From the type 513-1-0-0-0 we 
obtain by single 
edge 
reduction 
the 
type 
413-1-0-0 

SPACE PARTITIONS 
213 
(Figure

From 
the 
type 
411-1-1-1 
we derive 
either by single edge reduction, 
or 
by 
reduction 
of 
quadrangles 
the 
type 315-5-1 (Figure 9.3,b). From the 
type 413-1-0-0 
we 
obtain 
the 
type 
314-3-1 
(Figure 
9.3,c) 
by 
simultaneous 
reduction of complexes of six 
stereOgonS, at a time, which form together 
a 
hexagon. 
Finally from the type 413-0-3-0 we get the type 319-9-1 
(Figure 
9.3,d) 
by simultaneous reduction of complexes 
of three stereogons, at a time, which form 
together 
a 
hexagon. 
The 
result of these reductions may be summerized in the 
following theorem due to Laves (Lave2). 
Theorem 9.2: 
In the plane E2 there exist 
11 
topological 
types of isohedral face-to-face tessellations. 
We 
note 
that 
each 
of 
these 
11 topological types of 
isohedral face-to-face tessellations can be realized by 
a 
Dirichlet domain partition (Lave1). 
Considering 
the 
stabilizer of the tessellation and the 
symmetry of the tiles a refined classification into isohe-
dral types of face-to-face tessellations was performed 
by 
GrUnbaum and Shephard (GrUn1). 
Theorem 
9.3: 
In 
the plane E2 there exist 47 isohedral 
types of face-to-face tessellations. 
It is still unknown, if each of these 47 isohedral types 
of face-to-face tessellations can be realized by 
a 
Diri-
chlet domain partition. 
Also 
more 
general 
monohedral 
tessellations have been 
considered. We note that every triangle and 
every 
convex 
quadrangle 
can 
tile 
the plane monohedrallY. 
Also every 
centrosymmetric hexagon has this property. Moreover, there 
exist three families of 
convex 
hexagons, 
discovered 
by 
Reinhardt 
(Rein1), 
which 
show this property. Monohedral 
tessellations with pentagons are more intriguing. 
Up till 
now 13 families of convex pentagons were 
discovered, 
but 
there 
is 
no prove tat this list is complete (for details 
the reader is referred to GrUn2, GrUn3).

9.2.2. Dirichlet domain partitions in E3 
Only a few general results on space partitions in E3 are 
known. The maximal number of faces of 
a 
stereohedron 
P, 
which 
allows 
a 
normal face-to-face space partition with 
tiles, all of which are combinatorially equivalent 
to 
P, 
is still unkown. 
Delone and Sandakova, considering isohedral space parti-
tions 
in 
n-dimensional 
space 
En, 
proved the following 
theorem which we state without 
proof 
(for 
a 
proof 
see 
Del03, 
~tog1). 
Theorem 9.4: 
Let T be an isohedral 
space partition in En 
with 
stabilizer 
Gs • 
having 
a 
stereotope 
P as 
prototile. The number of facets of P is at most 
p S 2"(1+h)-2, 
where h is the order of the crystallographic point 
group belonging to the stabilizer Gs • 
In three-dimensional space h=48 is maximal hence, pS390. 
To our knowledge this upper bound is much too high. 
In three-dimensional space EJ the primitive parallelohe-
dron is a maximal stereohedron (cf. 
sections 
3.5, 
9.3). 
But more complicated maximal stereohedra exist in E3 which 
are 
not yet known. Most results available up till now are 
obtained by calculating the Dirichlet domains of 
crystal-
lographic orbits (Lock1, Koch1, Enge1, Enge2). 
The calcu-
lations required are performed as follows: 
Let 
G 
be a space group with origin 0 and lattice basis 
a1' a2' aJ. 
First we determine the radius R' of a maximal 
interstitial ball of the lattice T3, generated by a1' 
a2' 
and a3' Since every crystallographic orbit OeG,xo) is the 
union of a finite set of lattices, each parallelly 
placed 
in 
space, 
it follows that a maximal interstitial ball of 
OCG,xo) has a radius RSR'. For some point Xo we 
determine 
the crystallographic orbit OeG,xo) within a ball of radius 
2R' 
and 
center 
Xo. 
Since RSR', it follows from theorem 
2.2, that these 
points 
determine 
the 
Dirichlet 
domain 
Dexo) 
(cf. 
sections 2.2, 2.4). If the coordinates of the 
reference point Xo 
are 
continuously 
changed, 
then 
the 
elements 
of 
the Dirichlet domaih D(xo) undergo a contin-
uous alteration. The region of the

sional. Two contiguous d-dimensional existence regions are 
separated 
by a ed-1)-dimensional existence region. called 
a boundary region. The corresponding Dirichlet 
domain 
is 
called a limiting type. 
A 
two-dimensional 
boundary 
region is characterized by 
the condition that at least four faces of Dexo) 
intersect 
in 
a common vertex 
vh~D(xo). This provides an approach to 
calculate the boundary region. Let HI be the

This determinant provides the equation of a two-dimension-
al 
boundary 
region. We express this equation through the 
coordinates t, n, 
~ of the reference point Xo. 
Theorem 9.5: 
In three-dimensional space E3 every 
two-di-
mensional boundary region is determined by a poly-
nom of highest degree four in t. n, and 
~. 
Proof: We choose q, :=iexo+x,), As f=X,-xo it follows that 
f,-qi = ielxd 2 -
IXoI2). 
Since 
the 
symmetry operation (Si'5,)~G is an isometry 
it holds that Is,xoI2=lxoI2 hence, 
Thus 
~I is linear in t, n. and 
~ which proves the above 
theorem.

Example 9.2: We determine the isohedral types of Dirichlet 
domain partitions for the space group G:=I23 (the stan-
dard 
setting 
of 
the 
International Table, Vol. A, is 
used). It is sufficient to consider as parameter 
space 
the 
fundamental 
region of the corresponding Euclidean 
normalizer. From Table 8.3 we 
take 
~E(I23)=Imlm. 
The 
fundamental region is the tetrahedron determined by the 
four 
vertices 
(0,0,0), (t,O,O), (t,t,O), and (a,a,a). 
We choose a grid, 
having 
a 
sufficiently 
small 
grid 
interval, 
and 
determine 
the Dirichlet domain at each 
grid point. 
Knowing the 
Dirichlet 
domains 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
a 
two-dimensional 
boundary 
region, we can 
deduce the limiting Dirichlet domain and calculate 
the 
equation 
of the boundary region. 
The results of these 
calculations are given in Table 9.2. There the type 
of 
space 
partition 
is 
denoted 
by a short symbol, viz.: 
f.v-m, where f, v are the numbers of faces and vertices 
respectively of the Dirichlet domain, and m is an inte-
ger specifying its combinatorial type.

9.3. 
Parallelotopes 
General 
properties 
of 
Dirichlet 
parallelotopes 
were 
discussed in section 3.5. 
The concept of maximal 
stereo-
topes 
can again be used to derive the combinatorial types 
of parallelotopes in the following way: 
1. The primitive parallelotopes are maximal ons. 
However, 
in 
dimensions n~4 there exist non-primitive parallelo-
topes which are maximal. A unique 
characterization 
of 
the 
maximal 
parallelotopes 
for 
dimension n>4 is not 
known. 
2. All the other parallelotopes are obtained by successive 
zone-reductions. 
Let P be a 
parallelotope 
in 
En. 
A 
zone 
Z 
of 
P (cf. definition 3.5) is called closed if 
every 2-face of P 
that 
contains 
an 
edge 
Ej~Z also 
contains another edge 
Ek~Z. 
A reduced parallelotope P' 
is obtained through the reduction of a closed zone Z of 
P. 
Let E1 be a shortest edge of Z. Every edge Ej~Z is 
reduced by E1 • Thereby, the properties of a 
parallelo-
tope 
are conserved. If P collapses under a zone-reduc-
tion then P' is a (n-1)-dimensional parallelotope. 
Example 
9.4: In 
two-dimensional 
space 
E2 
the 
convex 
centrosymmetric 
hexagon is the only maximal parallelo-
gon. By a zone-reduction we obtain the 
centrosymmetric 
quadrilateral.

GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
In three-dimensinal space E3 there exists one type of 
primitive parallelohedra, viz.: 14-1, which is a 
maxi-
malone 
(cf. 
Table 
9.3, and Figure 3.6). It has six 
equivalent zones. By a zone-reduction we get 
the 
type 
12-1. 
The latter type has two non-equivalent zones. By 
reduction of the fourfold zone we obtain the type 12-2, 
and by reduction of the sixfold zone we 
get 
the 
type 
8-1. 
From the types 12-2 and 8-1 we obtain the minimal 
type 6-1 by a zone-reduction. 
The five 
combinatorial 
types 
of 
parallelohedra 
were 
derived 
by 
Fedorov 
(Fedo1). 
A 
finer 
classification, 
considering 
their 
stabilizers, was performed by Delaunay (Delo2). 
In 
four-dimensional space E4 there exist three types 
of primitive parallelotopes which 
were 
determined 
by 
Voronol 
(Voro1), viz.: 30-2, 30-3, and 30-4 (cf. Table 
9.4). Necessarily these are maximal. But also the 
type 
30-1 
is maximal although it is not primitive. 
Remark-
ably it has the maximal number of 
facets 
but 
it 
has 
twelve 
vertices 
which are six-valent. From these four 
maximal types we can derive 48 
reduced 
parallelotopes 
by 
zone-reductions 
as 
is 
shown in Figure 9.7. 
They 
were 
determined 
by 
Delaunay 
(Delo1) 
and 
~togrin 
(~tog1).

there exist 221 combinatorial types of primitive paral-

The regularity cOLdition 
We now consider a (r,R)-system X. From each 
point 
Xi~X 
we draw the straight line segments to all the other points 
of 
X. 
The 
regularity 
condition 1.3 requires that these 
line systems are directly or symmetrically congruent 
(cf. 
section 
1.1). 
This 
condition 
can 
be 
weakened if we 
consider the local properties of X. 
In this 
section 
it 
will 
be 
shown that the regularity already is asserted if 
these line systems for every point 
Xi~X are 
directly 
or 
symmetrically congruent within a given "sphere of regular-
ity" centered at Xi' 
To 
every 
(r,R)-system 
corresponds 
a unique Dirichlet 
domain partition (cf. 
section 
2.3). 
We 
will 
use 
this 
construction 
to 
investigate 
the 
local properties of X. 
However, to begin with, we 
consider 
more 
general 
space 
partitions 
and 
only at the end we come back to the Diri-
chlet domain partition. In 
what 
follows 
we 
consider 
a 
normal space partition T with tiles T;, 
i~I. 
The 
cell complex of all tiles Tj~T which touch the tile 
T i , 
C 1 (T i ) : = {T j IT j nT i #0} , 
is called the first corona of T i . 
Similarly, 
C k ( T ; ) : = {T j I T j nC k - 1 C T i ) #0} , 
is called the k-corona of Ti . 
We define 
CO(T;):=Ti' 
We 
say 
CkCT i ) 
is 
congruent 
to 
CkCTj) 
if there exists an 
isometry 'P;j~IECn), 'P;j: C"CT;)-+CvCT j ), v=k,k-1, .... ,O. 
Let KIT;]:={O"vIO"v: T;-+T;} be the stabilizer of T; in the 
E u eli de a n 
g r 0 up 
IE C n ) • 
S i mil a r I y 
let 
KIC1CT;)]:={O"vIO"v: C1(T;)-+C1CT;), TI-+T;} be the stabilizer 
of 
C1(T i ). 
It follows that KIC1(T;)]SKIT;] because every 
a~KIC1 (Td] 
maps Ti onto itself. We 
write 
KIT;] 
as 
a 
union of cosets with respect to KIC1CT;)], 
where 01 is the identity operation. 
Let 
now To be a fixed normal space partition, such that 
all tiles T;~TO have 
congruent 
first 
coronas. 
By 
this 
clearly To is monohedral. 
We take the tiles of To and try

Figure 9.8. The first corona of a tile Ti 
to 
assemble 
them in a different way, under the condition 
that each tile obtains a congruent first corona. 
This 
is 
like 
putting 
together a puzzle. In the following we have 
to formalize this game introducing the concept 
of 
geome-
tric extension. 
De fin i t ion 9. 5 :

extension if the overlap domain Oij:=c1(T i )nC1(T j ) 
is a subcomplex of C1(T 1)' 
A geometric extension 'Yij requires that for 
TinTj¢0 
it 
holds 
that 
'YiijeTj)=Tl' 
'Yi~eTi)=Tk' 
Since 
'Yi~(TinTj)=TknTi;i0 it 
follows 
that 
T k €C1(TI)' 
Hence 
'YiijeOij)=OikCC1(TI)' 
where Olk is a subcomplex of C1(Ti). 
The overlap domain Olk may be identical 
to 
Oij 
but, 
in 
general, this is not required.

geometric extension with overlap domain O;j. 
In 
what 
follows 
we 
assume that K[C1CT;) 1 is a proper 
subgroup of K[T;]. 
If for 
some 
A

in Figure 9.9. In general, Ojh is not required to be iden-
tical 
to 
Oij' 
For 
all 
such 
A 
let 
Slj:={(T1K[C1(Tj)], ... ,OlK[C1(Tj)]} 
be 
the 
union 
of the 
corresponding cosets of K[T j ]. We call 
jJv~;j' 
jJv~S;j' 
a 
multivaried 
S;j-extension, 
if Slj contains more than one 
coset. Clearly multivaried ~;j-extensions only 
occur 
if 
K[C1 CT;) ]<K[T j
). 
We 
next 
consider two geometric extensions ~;j and 
~;k' 
We choose TkCC1(T j ), k¢j, such that TknTj¢0. Then ~;j 
and 
~ik are 
called 
contiguous 
geometric 
extensions. For a 
given jJv~;j' jJv~S;j' we say jJ~~;k' jJ~~S;k' can be realized 
if Ojk:=C~CTj)nCA(Tk) is a subcomplex of C~CTj). 
Other-
wise 
jJ~~;k 
cannot be realized. In general two contiguous 
multivaried extensions can only be realized 
for 
some 
of 
the cosets say S;jCS;j and SikCSlk respectively. 

228 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
We 
say that two contiguous multivaried geometric exten-
sions Py~;j and PP~;k are not coupled if for every 
py~S;j 
the 
geometric 
extensions 
PP~;k 
can be realized for all 
PP~Stk' Otherwise they are 
called 
coupled. 
We 
have 
to 
consider this two cases separately. 
1. We 
assume 
that 
all pairs of contiguous multivaried 
extensions are not coupled. 
Theorem 9.6: 
If in a normal space partition Tq all tiles 
T;~TO 
have congruent first coronas and only if no 
coupled extensions occur then the assemblage of To 
is unique. 
Proof: Starting from the tile TO~TO we assemble the 
space 
partition 
under the condition that every tile Tt, 
i~I, 
has a congruent 
first 
corona. 
We 
perform 
geometric 
extensions along all possible chains To,T j , ..•• Suppose 
we 
thereby 
encounter 
a multivaried Say-extension. By 
the congruence of the 
first 
coronas 
there 
exists 
a 
multivaried 
SOk-extension. 
We 
prove 
that 
we 
can 
uniquely 
build 
up 
chains 
To,T 1 , •.•• T. 
such 
that 
T;nT k¢0, 
i¢k, 
for 
i=0.1, •.• ,s. 
The 
overlap 
domain 
OOkCC1(To) is given. 
It 
contains 
at 
least 
a 
tile 
T1¢T o,Tk. 
We 
take T1 • By assumption Py~01 and Rp~Ok 
are not coupled. Thus for every Pp~SOk we 
can 
realize 
all 
extensions

this means that 01k remains 
conserved 
and 
hence. 
is 
uniquely 
determined. 
By 
the same argument as above 
there exists a tile T2~01k such that T2¢T o.T1 .Tk' 
As 
before we can show that 02k is uniquely determined etc. 
In 
this 
way 
we construct all such chains and finally 
C1(T k ) becomes uniquely determined. This proves theorem 
9.6. 
2. We now consider the second case that 
coupled 
exten-
sions 
occur. Starting from the tile To~To suppose that we 
have made all unique extensions along all possible 
chains 
ending up with a cell complex Ao. Clearly AonC1(To)¢C1(To) 
because otherwise. by the congruence of the first coronas. 
Ao 
could 
be extended to To. 
Let AH be a parallel set of 
Ao, that is, AH is the union of all balls BC~,H) of radius 
H which are attached at all points p~Ao. Similarly. let EH 
be a parallel set of a plane E. 
If 
for 
a 
finite 
real 
costant 
H there 
exists a plane E of dimension d but not 
d+1 such that AoCEH and ECAH then we say that 
Ao 
has 
an 
extent 
d. 
extCAo)=d. We call a layer L a cell complex of 
extent n-1 which consists locally of a minimum 
number 
of 

SPACE PARTITIONS 
229 
tiles Ti~To such that L separates En into 
two 
components 
C-
and 
C+ which have distance ~>O. 
For a given layer Lo 
the adjacent layer L1 is defined as 
For a cell complex A we define the 
first 
corona 
as 
the 
cell complex 
Conjecture 9.7: 
If in a normal space partition To coupled 
extensions 
occur 
then 
the 
assemblage 
of TO is 
uniquely 
determined 
if all tiles 
Ti~To 
have 
congruent second coronas. 
Sketch

Suppose

exists a plane E of dimension d and a finite

that

Because 
d'>1 we find in M at least one closed chain W1

Ao. 
For 
T1.T2~W1 
let Ti~Ao be adjacent to both T1 and T2 . 
By assumption the contiguous extensions Pv~i1' 
Pv~S;1' 
and 
P~~;2' 
P~~S;2' are coupled. For a given choice of 
Pv~;1 we perform the 
geometric 
extensions 
along 
the 
chain 
W1. 
Let Tj.Tk~W1 be two successive tiles of W1' 
j = 1 •••.• s. E i the r for so m e j. 
P" ~ j k •

not 
coupled 
then 
by theorem 9.6 Ojk remains conserved. In 
this case. by the congruence of the first 
coronas. 
Ao 
can be extended further. Or else PA~jk is coupled. that 
is. the chain can be extended in at least two different 
ways. Thus. for j=1 ••••• s. we can perform the geometric 
extensions 
along the chain W1 
in at least 2s different 
ways. 
Since the chain W1 is closed. we have 
that 
for 
each 
possibility 
the 
overlap 
domain 
0 51 
must 
be 
conserved because of the given choice of Pv~;1. 
Hence. 
at least 2 5 
overlap 
domains 
of 
C1(To) 
have 
to 
be 
congruent 
to 
0s1. 
Since 
there 
are 
only 
s overlap 
domains along the chain W1 it is 
therefore 
impossible 
that 
all 
of 
them can be coupled. 
The same argument 
holds until extCAo)=n-1. The cell complex Ao may not be 
a single layer because the first corona 
C1(To) 
deter-
mines 
both 
adjacent 
layers 
uniquely and hence TO is 

230 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
determined uniquely. If Ao is a double layer 
then 
the 
adjacent 
double 
layer 
is 
not 
uniquely 
determined 
because the first 
corona 
is 
part 
of 
exactly 
three 
layers. Ao may not contain more than two layers because 
otherwise 
C1(To)CAo and by the congruence of the first 
coronas TO is uniquely determined. 
The cell complex Ao consists of a double layer. By 
the 
congruence 
of the second coronas, both adjacent double 
layers A_1 and A1 are uniquely 
determined. 
Therefore, 
the 
stacking 
of six layers is uniquely determined. It 
follows that C2(T o )C[A- 1uA oUA 1 ]. By the 
congruence 
of 
the 
second 
coronas 
this 
is true for all tiles Tv(TO 
hence, the stacking of all layers 
is 
uniquely 
deter-
mined.

Theorem 
9.8. 
A normal space partition To is regular if 
every tile of TO has a congruent second corona. 
Proof: By theorem 9.7 the assemblage is 
unique 
if 
every 
tile 
Tv~TO 
has 
a congruent second corona. We have to 
prove that there exists an infinite group of isometries 
which acts transitively on the tiles 
of 
To. 
Let 
the 
space 
partition TO be assembled in a unique way start-
ing from the tile TI~To. For any other 
tile 
Tj~TO 
as 
starting point, we can assemble the same tiling TO in a 
unique 
way. 
We 
show 
that there exists an isometry ~ 
which maps T; onto Tj and thereby maps TO onto 
itself. 
Indeed, 
for 
any 
T.~To we can find a chain from TI to 
Ts. Because of 
the 
unique 
assemblage 
at 
least 
one 
congruent 
chain 
exists from Tj 
to some Tv~To. Hence ~ 
maps Ts onto Tv' This is true for every pair 
of 
tiles 
T, and Tj and all tiles T •. This proves theorem 9.8. 
Theorem 
9.9. 
A 
(r,Rl-system 
X is regular if at every 
point x,~X, the system of straight 
line 
segments 
drawn 
from 
XI 
to all other points Xj~X within a 
ball of radius 6R and center Xi 
is 
congruent 
to 
the corresponding system of straihgt line segments 
at Xo. 
Proof: 
The 
(r,Rl-system 
determines 
a 
unique Dirichlet 
domain partition. By theorem 2.4 and condition 
1.1 
it 
is normal. 
By theorem 9.8 the congruence of the second 
coronas 
is sufficient that the Dirichlet domain parti-
tion is regular, and 
therefore, 
the 
(r,Rl-system 
is 
regular. 
By 
theorem 
2.2 
the Dirichlet domain of the 
point x;~X is determined through all points Xj~X within 
a ball of radius 2R and center Xi' It follows that 
the 
first 
corona 
is determined trough all points within a 
ball of radius 4R and a ball of radius 6R is sufficient 
to determine the second corona. 
The ball of radius 6R is an upper bound. In most cases a 
ball of radius 4R or even 2R is sufficient to ensure regu-
larity. Since the Dirichlet domains are 
convex 
polyhedra 
and the Dirichlet domain partition is a very special face-
to-face 
tiling 
we 
still 
have 
to show that the ball of 
radius 6R is necessary. 
Indeed in the plane 
E2 
we 
can 
easily 
show 
that 
no 
face-to-face 
tiling exists which 
requires the congruence of the second corona in 
order 
to 
establish 
the 
regularity. 
However. in three-dimensional 
space EJ such face-to-face tilings exist. The first 
known 
example of a Dirichlet domain partition which requires the 
congruence 
of 
the second corona is shown in Figure 9.11. 

232 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
The Dirichlet domain is a square 
prism 
with 
a 
slanting 
roof. 
Translates of the Dirichlet domain are assembled to 
form a layer. 
Two congruent layers are put together head-
to-head 
to 
form a double layer. 
Congruent double layers 
are stacked one upon the other. Each double layer 
can 
be 
rotated 
by ±90 0 with respect to the previous one. Thereby 
the congruence of the first coronas is 
conserved. 
If 
we 
rotate 
always 
by 
+90 0 
then 
a regular Dirichlet domain 
partition results with space group 
P4122 
(P4322 
respec-
tively 
if 
we rotate always by -90°). If we rotate alter-
nately by +90 0 and -90° then 
again 
a 
regular 
Dirichlet 
domain 
partition 
results 
which has congruent (direct or 
symmetric) first coronas but different second coronas with 
respect to the first partition. The space group 
is 
C2/c. 
Both 
space partitions belong to the same topologicl type. 
The second space partition can be obtained from the 
first 
one by a continuous deformation. Besides these two regular 
partitions 
an 
infinite 
number 
of 
different 
irregular 
partitions exist,where the sense of rotation is 
arbitrar-
ily 
changed. 
All 
these 
partitions have congruent first 
coronas.

Dissectjons of polytopes 
We consider closed polytopes in Euclidean 
space 
En. 
A 
polytope 
P 
is 
said 
to 
be 
dissected into P1 and P2 if 
P=P1UP2 and the interiors 
of 
P1 
and 
P2 
are 
disjoint. 
Following 
Sah 
CSah1), we will write P1ilP 2 to denote the 
pairwise interior disjoint union of P1 and P2. 
A polytope 
P1 is said to be congruent to the 
polytope 
P2 
if 
there 
exists an isometry ~€~Cn), such that P2=~P1. We define the 
volume 
of 
P 
through the additive function foCP):=volCP) 
having values in ~ Cset of real 
numbers) 
such 
that 
the 
following conditions hold: 
1. foCP1)=foCP2), if P1 is congruent to P2' 
2. foCP11lP2)=foCP1)+foCP2)' 
3. foCPHO. 
In 
the theory of volume the equidissection is of impor-
tance. 
Definitjon 9.6: 
Two polytopes P and Q are called equidis-
sectable, 
P~Q, 
if 
P 
and 
Q 
can 
be 
finitely 
dissected 
into 
P1 , .•• ,P s ' 
and Q1, ••. ,Qs respec-
tively, such that 
PI 
is 
congruent 
to 
QI' 
for 
i = 1, ... , s • 
Necessarily 
equidissectable 
polytopes 
have 
the 
same 
volume. 
From elementary geometry in the plane 
E2 
it 
is 
known 
that 
two 
polygons 
P and Q are always equidissectable if 
they have equal areas. However, in spaces of higher dimen-
sions, in general, this is no longer true. This means that 
the theory of volume depends upon the axiom of continuity. 
In answering Hilbert's third problem, Dehn gave 
necessary 
conditions 
for 
two polyhedra in EJ to be equidissectable 
CDehn1).

where the summation extends over the N (n-2)-faces 
Ft 
of 
P. 
Here vol(F;) is the (n-2)-dimensional volume of Ft and 
a,CF;) is the interior dihedral angle, measured 
in 
radi-
ans, 
between both adjacent facets which meet in F,. Nowa-
days the first Dehn function 
is 
expressed 
as 
a

fi~st Dehn 
function thus becomes,

It has values in IRxIR/~7r. We now consider a certain

is invariant (modulo 
~rr) 
of 
the 
particular 
dissection 
chosen. 
Sydler 
and Jessen proved that Dehn's function is 
sufficient for equidissection in 
three-
and 
four-dimen-
sional 
space. 
We state the Dehn-Sydler theorem without 
proof (for a proof see Sydl1, Jess1, Sah1). 
Theorem 9.10: 
Let P and Q be two polytopes 
in 
Euclidean 
space 
En, 
n$4. 
If 
P 
and Q agree in their Dehn 
functions fo and f1 (modulo 
~rr), 
then 
they 
are 
equidissectable. 
In 
spaces 
of 
dimension 
n>4 
necessarily h~gher order 
Dehn's functions have to be 
considered. 
Yet 
there 
is 
still no proof that such conditions are sufficient. 
The importance of the Dehn-Sydler theorem is revealed in 
the 
following 
theorem, 
due to Debrunner, which we state 
without proof (for a proof see Debr2). 
Theorem 9.11: 
Let T be a normal 
space 
partition 
in 
En 
with 
stereotopes Py , 
u~I, all of which (except of 
a finite number) are 
similar 
to 
Po, 
Py=~yAyPo' 
~y€~(n), O<Ay~~<OO. Then Po has first Dehn function 
f1(Po)=0 
mod(~rr). 
The hypercube Hn in En has first Dehn function f1(H n}=0. 
Under 
the condition of theorem 9.11 it follows from theo-
rem 9.10 that every stereotope in En, n$4, is equidissect-
able to a hypercube Hn of equal volume. 
In the following we state 
some 
results 
on 
dissection

between regular simplices An and crosspolytopes 
Cn in En. 
The dihedral angles of these regular 
polytopes 
are given by C9xeter (Coxe1) as follows: 
An: cosan=1/n,

Cn: cosPn=(2-n)/n, tgPn=2Vn-1/(2-n).

9.6. 
Hjstorical remarks 
Tessellations 
of 
the plane by polygons are known since 
the antique. The 
ancient 
Greeks 
associated 
a 
Platonic 
solid 
to 
each of their four elements. viz.; fire, earth. 
air. water. and they asked wether it is possible 
to 
fill 
space 
completely by congruent copies of these fundamental 
particals. Aristotle taught that two of the five 
Platonic 
solids. 
the 
cube 
and. incorrectly. the tetrahedron. are 
space fillers. He thus rejected the other Platonic 
solids 
as 
fundamental 
particles because in his opinion a vacuum 
does not exist in nature. 
Since these 
early 
beginnings. 
the 
problem 
of filling space with polyhedra had occupied 
many scientists up to our time. and still there 
are 
many 
open and difficult problems. 
Particularly. in crystallography space partitions always 
were 
considered important for the description of crystals 
and 
their 
atomic 
structure. 
Domenico 
Guglielmini 
(1655-1710) 
proposed four polyhedral particals. viz.: the 
cube. the hexagonal prism. the ~hombohedron. and the octa~ 
hedron which combine to form the crystals. For 
octahedral 
crystals 
he 
assumed 
tetrahedral interstices in order to 
get a complete space filling. 
The parallelepipedal build-
ing bricks of HaUy were already mentioned in section 1.6. 
By the beginning of the 19 th century the lattice hypoth-
eses was established by Seeber. Frankenheim. and 
Bravais. 

238 
GEOMETRIC CRYSTALLOGRAPHY 
and 
in 
1850 
Dirichlet 
introduced 
his 
important 
construction of the Dirichlet 
parallelogon 
(cf. 
section 
4.6). 
The 
concept 
of 
space filling polyhedra was again 
taken up by Fedorov who discovered in 1885 the five combi-
natorial 
types 
of 
parallelohedra 
in 
three-dimensional 
space. 
According to Fedorov a crystal consits of identi-
cal polyhedral particals which fill space completely 
when 
arranged in parallel position (Fed05). 
Parallelotopes 
in higher dimensional spaces were inves-
tigated in 1908 by Vorono'. He also found the 
four-dimen-
sional 
primitive 
parallelotopes 
(Voro1). 
These results 
were taken up in 1929 by Delaunay who determined 51 combi-
natorial types 
of 
four-dimensional 
parallelotopes. 
The 
missing 
one 
was 
discovered 
in 
1973 
by 
M.I. 
~togrin 
(~tog1). 
Only after Max von Laue's (1879-1960) discovery 
of 
the 
diffraction 
of 
X-rays 
by 
crystals 
in 1912 the lattice 
hypotheses was proved and soon afterwards a lot of 
struc-
tural 
information 
became 
available. 
Based on these new 
results the crystallographer Paul Niggli 
in 
1927 
intro-
duced the topological structure analysis. 
He investigated 
the 
topological 
connectivity 
by constructing aroud each 
atomic position its Dirichlet domain which he 
called 
the 
domain 
of 
influence 
(~igg5). 
This idea of Niggli was 
taken up by the crystallographer Fritz 
Laves 
(1906-1978) 
who 
determined in 1931 the topological types of Dirichlet 
domain partitions in the plane (Lave1,Lave2). 
More gener-
al results on plane tessellations were already obtained by 
the mathematician Karl Reinhardt in 1918 (Rein1). 
Diri-
chlet 
domains in three-dimensional space were constructed 
by Nowacki in 1935 (Nowa3). 
Due to the 
limited 
accuracy 
he 
attained at that time it was not possible to determine 
the more complicated Dirichlet domains. This could only be 
achieved in recent years by the use of computers as it was 
done by H.-D. Lockenhoff and Erwin Hellner 
(Lock1), 
Elke 
Koch 
(Koch1), 
Peter 
Engel 
(Enge1,Enge2), 
and Zbigniew 
Dauter (Daut1). 
The regularity condition of a regular point system is of 
fundamental importance in order to understand the crystal-
line state of matter. 
In 1888 Schonflies stated, 
without 
proof, 
that 
a 
monohedral 
space 
partition 
is 
regular 
(isohedral), if all its tiles 
are 
surrounded 
by 
its 
"neigbouring" 
tiles in a congruent way (Sch62). In gener-
al, this statement is false. First results concerning 
the 
local properties of regular point systems were obtained in 
1976 
by B.N. 
Delaunay and his colleagues (Delo3). In the

239 
endeavour to improve their upper bound, (v+2)2R, 
Galiulin 
incorrectly 
stated in 1980 that 4R is a sufficient radius 
for a sphere of regularity (Gali3). The 
Dirichlet 
domain 
partitions 
which 
require 
a regularity radius of 6R were 
recently discovered by the author. 
According to Euclid, the volumes of triangular 
pyramids 
of 
equal altitude are to each other as the areas of their 
bases. Hilbert did not believe that the theory 
of 
volume 
can 
be 
based on dissection of polytopes and in his third 
problem he sought for two terahedra of equal altitude 
and 
equal base area which are not equidissectable (Hilb1) (cf. 
section 
8.8). 
Such 
a counterexample and the necessary 
conditions 
were 
established 
by 
the 
mathematician 
Max 
Wilhelm Dehn (1878-1952). The theory of volume was further 
developed 
by 
the mathematician Hugo Hadwiger (1908-1981) 
(Hadw1). In 
1965 
the 
mathematician 
Jean-Pierre 
Sydler 
could 
prove that Dehn's functions are also sufficient for 
the equidissection of polyhedra. 
The 
important 
property 
that 
every 
prototile of a monohedral normal space parti-
tion has vanishing first Dehn function was proved 
by 
the 
mathematician 
Helmut 
Groemer 
in 
1964 
(Groe1) and more 
generally by the 
mathematician 
Hans 
Debrunner 
in 
1980 
(Debr2). 

10. Packings of Balls 
Atoms may be considered as small rigid balls. The 
pack-
ing 
of 
balls 
i~ an important concept in crystallography 
for the description of crystal structures, 
that 
is, 
the 
arrangement 
of atoms in a crystal. Many inorganic crystal 
structures are based on densest packings of balls. 
10.1. 
Definitions 
In Euclidean space En we consider a family 
of 
n-dimen-
sional closed balls, 
IC:= {cIBexv'J.£v) 
liE: I} , 
where 
Xv 
and 
J.£v 
are 
the 
center and the radius of the 
closed ball clB, and I is an infinite set of indices. 
If 
two 
balls cIBex"J.£,) and cIBexj,J.£j) touch each other then 
we join their centers with a straight line segment. 
Definition 10.1: 
A family of balls IC is said 
to 
form 
a 
packing into En 
1. if the intersection of the interiors of any two 
balls of IC is empty, 
i n t B ( x; , J.£,) n i n t Be x j , J.£ j ) =0, i"# j • 
2. if 
there exists for any two balls of IC a chain 
of joins connecting them. 
A packing of balls into En is 
called 
monospherical 
if 
all 
of 
its 
balls 
have 
the same finite radius J.£. It is 
called regular or homogeneous 
if 
there 
exists 
a 
space 
group 
G 
which 
acts transitively on the balls. A regular 
packing of balls 
necessarily 
is 
monospherical. 
It 
is 
called 
a 
lattjce 
packjng 
of 
balls 
if the translation 
subgroup Tn of G acts transitively on the balls. 
A 
regu-
lar 
packing 
of 
balls is called stable if no ball can be 
moved without disturbing some other balls. The set of 
all 
centers

PACKINGS OF BALLS 
241 
In what follows we only 
consider 
regular 
packings 
of 
balls. 
The 
set 
of 
all 
centers Xv form a regular point 
system 
X in En. 
Clearly, by the condition of regularity, 
the packing graph 
is 
vertex-transitive. 
By 
DCx v ) 
we 
denote the 
Dirichlet domain of the center Xv with respect 
to X Ccf. section 2.1). It holds that BCxv,~)CcIDCxv). The 
density pC~) of a regular packing of balls is defined by 
pC~):= vol(BCxv,~))/vol(DCxv)). 
It can be regarded as the proportion of the whole of space 
covered 
by the family of balls. 
The volume of a n-dimen-
sional ball of radius ~ is given by 
1T~n 
vol (B) 
~n, 
r(~n+1) 
where the gamma function is given 
by 
r(1)=1, 
rCk+1)=k!, 
rn)=-J7T, and rn+k)=C~+k-1)(i+k-2). .. ci)-J7T, kE:IN. 
Definition 
10.2: 
Two regular packings of balls ~ and 
~, 
are isomorphic and belong to the same 
topological 
type 
of 
regular 
packing if they have isomorphic 
packing graphs. 
It may be very difficult to verify 
the 
isomorphism 
of 
two 
packing 
graphs. 
No 
algorithm which allows a unique 
classification of packing graphs has been described 
hith-
erto. 
A possible way to do it would be to look at certain 
polyhedral cells PI determined by the packing graph. Since 
the packing graph is vertex-transitive it is sufficient to 
consider those cells only 
which 
meet 
in 
a 
vertex 
xv. 
Generally, 
these 
cells are not convex. 
Only for n=2 the 
cells PI are always bounded polygons because of the 
pack-
ing 
conditions. 
In this case it is sufficient to specify 
in cyclic order the s polygons which meet in the vertex Xv 
in the following way: 
P1-P2-·· .-p", 
where PI' i=1, •.. ,s, gives the number of vertices 
of 
the 
polygon 
PI. 
In 
order 
to 
make 
this scheme unique we 
require that P1 is maximal. 
Among the 
remaining 
schemes 
we retain those with maximal P2 etc. 
A 
finer 
classification 
is obtained if we consider the 
stabilizer Gs of the regular packing of balls and the 
way 
Gs acts on the balls.

Definition 
10.3: 
Two regular packings of balls K and K' 
are isomorphic and belong 
to 
the 
same 
type 
of

1. if K and K' belong to the same topological type 
of regular packing. 
2. if 
K and K' have equivalent stabilizers Gs 
and

lizers StCB v ) and StCB~) in Gs

Following 
Niggli, the conditions for the existence of a 
regular packing K 
of 
balls 
are 
determined 
as 
follows 
CNiggS): 
Let 
G 
be 
the 
generating space group of K. We 
consider the set of all crystallographic orbits OCG,xo) of 
G Ccf. section 8.1). 
Let H be a certain 
cyclic 
subgroup 
of 
G. 
With 
respect 
to 
H each 
crystallographic orbit 
OCG,xo) can be devided into two disjoint subsets,

Xj(O' 
We note that the symmetry domain ~CH) not necessarily is 
bounded. 
For some cyclic subgroups H'<G it also 
may 
be 
empty. 
For a given space group G with metric tensor C the 
space 
En 
is 
uniquely partitioned into symmetry domains. 
The boundary regions between two adjacent symmetry domains

We note 
that 
the

In 
order to obtain a regular packing

Packing of disks into E2 
The types of regular packings of disks into the plane E2 
were 
determined 
by 
Niggli (Nigg5). The results of these 
calculations are summerized in the following theorem. 
Theorem 10.1: 
There exist 31 types of regular packings of 
disks into the plane E2. 
From the 31 types of regular packings of 
disks 
we 
can 
deduce 
the 
11 
topological 
types of regular packings of 
disks which are shown in Figure 10.1. The type 3-3-3-3-3-3 
(cf. Figure 10.1a) is a densest lattice packing 
of 
disks 
with 
density 
p=rr/V12. 
Its 
stabilizer 
is 
p6mm. It was 
proved by Toth (Toth1) that this is the closest packing of 
disks into E2. The type 12-12-12 (cf. 
Figure 
10.11) 
has 
the lowest density, p-0.3907. Its stabilizer is also p6mm. 
Nowacki 
investigated 
regular packings of ellipses into 
E2 CNowa6). 
His 
list 
was 
corrected 
and 
extended 
by 
GrUnbaum 
and 
Shephard (Grlin3). 
The result is summerized 
in the following theorem. 
Theorem 10.2: 
There exist 57 types of regular packings of 
ellipses into the plane E2.

tant in crystallography. 
We consider in E3 a plane with a

densest packing of disks and replace each disk 
through 
a 
ball thus obtaining a densest layer of balls. 
The densest 
lattice

of 
balls 
is generated by stacking such 
layers as closely as possible, that is, the 
second

fits into the voids of the first layer etc. We denote by v

The 
lattice 
packing thus obtained is called the cubic closest packing. 
It 
corresponds 
to 
the 
cubic face-centered lattice with 
stabilizer Fm3m. Other 
stacking 
sequences 
do 
not 
give 
lattice 
packings.

V1 and V2 the

results. 
The 
packing 
thus 
obtained 
is 
regular 
and is called the hexagonal closest 
packing. 
Its stabilizer is P63/mmc~ 
All 
other 
stacking 
sequences are not regular. The density of such packings by 
stacking 
densest 
layers of balls is p=n/V18. There is no 
proof that this is the densest possible packing 
of 
balls 
into E3. 
The 
numbers 
of 
different 
stacking sequences having a 
given repeat period were determined 
by 
Iglesias 
and 
by 
McLarnan (Igle1, McLa1). 
The 
packings 
of 
balls by stacking densest layers have 
two different voids. 
The larger void is called the 
octa-
hedral 
void. It can obtain a ball of radius ~({2-1) which 
will be in contact with six balls situated at the vertices 
of an octahedron. 
The smaller void is called the tetrahe-
dral void which is coordinated by four balls 
situated 
at 
the 
vertices 
of 
a regular tetrahedron. A ball of radius 
~(V3/2-1) can be fitted into this void. There exist 
twice 
as 
many tetrahedra than octahedra. Tetrahedra and octahe-
dra together completely fill the space. In the cubic clos-
est packing the octahedra 
only 
share 
common 
edges 
and 
vertices 
whereas, 
in 
the 
hexagonal closest packing the 
octahedra form columns along the c-axis by sharing 
common 
faces 
as can be seen in Figure 10.2. Two adjacent columns 
only share common edges and vertices.

Regular packings of balls into EJ were 
investigated 
by 
5inogowitz 
who 
found 
681 
types 
of regular packings of 
balls generated by space groups belonging to the 
triclin-
ic, 
monoclinic, and orthorhombic crystal systems (5in01). 
Fischer determined 593 types of regular packings generated 
by space groups of the tetragonal and cubic crystal system 
(Fisc1)' 
Regular packings of balls of low density 
were 
investi-
gated 
too. 
The packing of lowest density was discovered 
by Heesch and 
laves 
in 
the 
space 
group 
14132 
(Hee1, 
Fisc2). 
Regular packings of ellipsoids into EJ were investigated 
by Matsumoto and Nowacki (Mats1). 
10.4. 
Lattice packings of balls jn En 
In 
spaces 
of higher dimensions mainly lattice packings 
of balls were investigated. The stacking process described 
in section 10.3 can be used to generate 
lattice 
packings 
of balls in any dimension (leec1, Conw1). lattice packings 
of 
balls 
were 
determined 
up to dimensions 60. However, 

PACKINGS OF BALLS 
247 
little 
is 
known on general regular packings of balls. It 
was proposed by Rogers that probably for 
n~5 the 
densest 
packings 
of balls are not lattice packings (Roge1). Leech 
and Sloane have found in E10 and 
E11 
packings 
of 
balls 
which are denser than the densest lattice packing (Leec1). 
An upper bound 0 for the density of packings of balls into 
En was given by Rogers in the following way (Roge1): In En 
a 
system 
of 
(n+1) 
balls are densest packed if they are 
situated at the vertices of a regular simplex 
An 
in 
En. 
Let 
On 
denote the ratio of the volume of the part of the 
simplex covered by the balls to the volume 
of 
the 
whole 
simplex. For 
n~2 congruent copies of a regular simplex can 
tile 
space. 
It 
follows 
that o=on for 
n~2. By theorem 
9.12, regular simplices in spaces of 
dimensions 
n~3 are 
not 
space fillers. 
Thus o<on for 
n~3. In Table 10.2 are 
listed the known densest packings of balls into En 
up 
to 
dimension n=12 according to Leech and Sloane (Leec1).

Remarkably, in 
E8 
the densest lattice packing of balls 
has a density very close 
to 
the 
upper 
bound. 
This 
is 
because 
by 
theorem 
9.12, 
there 
exists 
a 
dissection 
relation between the regular simplices An and the crosspo-
lytopes en.

Historical remarks 
The first treatise on packings of balls is considered to 
be 
Johann 
Kepler's 
remarkable 
speculation on the forms 
displayed by snowflakes in 1611. 
Kepler discussed 
simple 
cubic 
packing, 
face and body centered cubic packings and 
simple hexagonal packing. Robert Hook (1635-1703), 
howev-
er, seems to have been the first to consider the spherical 
particals 
to 
be 
atoms. He proposed that all crystalline 
forms can be explained by a few basic packing arrangements 
of balls. 
Similarly, Christian Huygens (1629-1695) postu-
lated 
ellipsoidal 
atoms 
to 
explain 
the 
cleavage 
of 
calcite. 
Packings 
of balls were futher investigated by 
William Barlow (1845-1934) who listed five packing 
types; 
one 
of 
these was the hexagonal closest packing, which he 
was the first to introduce. 
A systematic investigation 
of 
packings 
of 
balls 
was 
started 
by 
the crystallographer Paul Niggli in his trea-
tise on topological structure analysis. In 1927 he derived 
the 31 types of regular packings of disks. 
Extending 
the 
ideas 
of 
Niggli, 
Ulrich 
Sinogowitz 
determined in 1944 
packings of balls in 
three-dimensional 
space 
for 
space 
groups 
of low symmetry. In a series of papers, 1970-1975, 
Werner Fischer determined the types of regular packings of 
balls for space groups of tetragonal and cubic symmetry. 
Packing of ellipsoids were again investigated by 
Werner 
Nowacki in 1948. 
The 
mathematical 
theory of packing goes back to Ludwig 
August Seeber (Seeb2) and to Carl Friedrich Gauss (Gaus1). 
Important contributions to the theory of lattice 
packings 
of balls were achieved by Hermann Minkowski in 1905 giving 
an 
upper bound for the density and by H. F. Blichfeldt in 
1934 who found the densest lattice packing of balls in Ea. 
The best upper bound for the density of packings of 
balls 
is due to Claude Ambrose Rogers. Lattice packings of balls 
were 
futher 
investigated 
by 
John 
Leech in a series of 
papers from 1964-1971.
