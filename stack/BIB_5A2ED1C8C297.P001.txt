Abstract 
 
ABSTRACT 
Implementation of Bayesian Therapeutic Drug Monitoring In 
Modern Patient Care 
The variability observed in drug exposure has a direct impact on the overall response to drug. The 
largest part of variability between dose and drug response resides in the pharmacokinetic phase, 
i.e. in the dose-concentration relationship. Among possibilities offered to clinicians, Therapeutic 
Drug Monitoring (TDM; Monitoring of drug concentration measurements) is one of the useful tool 
to guide pharmacotherapy. TDM aims at optimizing treatments by individualizing dosage regimens 
based on blood drug concentration measurement. Bayesian calculations, relying on population 
pharmacokinetic approach, currently represent the gold standard TDM strategy. However, it 
requires expertise and computational assistance, thus limiting its large implementation in routine 
patient care. 
The overall objective of this thesis was to implement robust tools to provide Bayesian TDM to 
clinician in modern routine patient care. To that endeavour, aims were (i) to elaborate an efficient 
and ergonomic computer tool for Bayesian TDM: EzeCHieL (ii) to provide algorithms for drug 
concentration 
Bayesian 
forecasting 
and 
software 
validation, 
relying 
on 
population 
pharmacokinetics (iii) to address some relevant issues encountered in clinical practice with a focus 
on neonates and drug adherence. 
First, the current stage of the existing software was reviewed and allows establishing specifications 
for the development of EzeCHieL. Then, in close collaboration with software engineers a fully 
integrated software, EzeCHieL, has been elaborated. EzeCHieL provides population-based 
predictions and Bayesian forecasting and an easy-to-use interface. It enables to assess the 
expectedness of an observed concentration in a patient compared to the whole population (via 
percentiles), to assess the suitability of the predicted concentration relative to the targeted 
concentration and to provide dosing adjustment. It allows thus a priori and a posteriori Bayesian 
drug dosing individualization.  
Implementation of Bayesian methods requires drug disposition characterisation and variability 
quantification trough population approach. Population pharmacokinetic analyses have been 
performed and Bayesian estimators have been provided for candidate drugs in population of

Abstract 
interest: anti-infectious drugs administered to neonates (gentamicin and imipenem). Developed 
models were implemented in EzeCHieL and also served as validation tool in comparing EzeCHieL 
concentration predictions against predictions from the reference software (NONMEM®).  
Models used need to be adequate and reliable. For instance, extrapolation is not possible from 
adults or children to neonates. Therefore, this work proposes models for neonates based on the 
developmental pharmacokinetics concept. Patients’ adherence is also an important concern for 
drug models development and for a successful outcome of the pharmacotherapy. A last study 
attempts to assess impact of routine patient adherence measurement on models definition and 
TDM interpretation.  
In conclusion, our results offer solutions to assist clinicians in interpreting blood drug 
concentrations and to improve the appropriateness of drug dosing in routine clinical practice.

Résumé 
RÉSUMÉ 
Implémentation du suivi thérapeutique des médicaments dans 
la prise en charge moderne du patient 
La variabilité observée dans l’exposition au médicament a un impact direct sur la réponse globale à 
celui-ci. La majeure partie de la variabilité entre la dose et la réponse au médicament se situe au 
niveau de la phase pharmacocinétique, c'est-à-dire au niveau de la relation dose – concentration. 
Parmi les possibilités offertes au clinicien, le suivi thérapeutique des médicaments (TDM) est un 
des outils avantageux pouvant aider à la prise en charge au niveau du médicament. Le TDM a pour 
but d’optimiser les traitements en individualisant les posologies en fonction des concentrations de 
médicaments mesurées dans le sang. Le calcul Bayesien, basé sur l’approche de pharmacocinétique 
de population, représente actuellement la méthode de référence pour l’application du TDM. Il 
nécessite néanmoins une certaine expertise et une assistance informatique, limitant la possibilité 
de sa large implémentation en routine. 
L’objectif global de cette thèse etait l’implémentation d’outils robustes en routine afin d’offrir un 
TDM Bayesien au clinicien pour une prise en charge moderne du patient. A cette fin, les objectifs 
concrets ont été (i) de concevoir un logiciel efficace et ergonomique pour la réalisation du TDM 
Bayesian : EzeCHieL (ii) de fournir les algorithmes de calcul des médicaments pour la prédiction 
Bayesienne des concentrations des médicaments et la validation du logiciel en s’appuyant sur 
l’approche de population (iii) de résoudre certaines questions rencontrées en pratique clinique en 
s’intéressant tout particulièrement aux nouveau-nés et à l’adhésion thérapeutique. 
Un état des lieux des logiciels existants a d’abord été réalisé, et a permis de définir les spécifications 
nécessaire à l’élaboration d’EzeCHieL. Par la suite, en collaboration étroite avec les ingénieurs en 
informatique, la réalisation d’EzeCHieL, un logiciel intégré, a débuté. EzeCHieL offre des prédictions 
bayesiennes basées sur l’approche de population et une interface utilisateur intuitive. Il permet 
d’évaluer si une concentration observée chez un patient est attendue, en comparaison à une 
population (via les percentiles), d’établir si la concentration prédite est adaptée à la concentration 
visée et de fournir une adaptation posologique. Il propose donc une individualisation posologique a 
priori et a posteriori.  
L’implémentation d’une méthode de TDM Bayesienne nécessite de caractériser la disposition du 
médicament et de quantifier sa variabilité selon une approche de population. Des analyses de

pharmacocinétique de population ont été réalisées et les estimateurs Bayesiens fournis, pour des 
médicaments candidats dans les populations d’intérêt : anti-infectieux chez les nouveau-nés 
(gentamicine et imipenème). Les modèles ainsi développés ont été implémentés dans EzeCHieL et 
servent également d’outils de validation en comparant les concentrations prédites par EzeCHieL 
aux concentrations prédites par le programme de référence (NONMEM®). 
Les modèles nécessitent d’être adéquats et fiables. L’extrapolation n’est, par exemple, pas possible à 
partir des adultes ou nouveau-nés. Ce travail propose donc des modèles pour les nouveau-nés, 
basés sur le concept de la pharmacocinétique développementale. L’adhésion thérapeutique est 
aussi un problème majeur dans le développement de modèle et dans la réussite de la thérapie 
médicamenteuse. Une dernière étude a tenté d’évaluer l’impact de l’adhésion thérapeutique 
mesurée en routine sur la caractérisation des modèles et sur l’interprétation des concentrations 
sanguines de médicament.  
En conclusion, nos résultats proposent des solutions pour assister les cliniciens dans 
l’interprétation des concentrations sanguines de médicament et pour améliorer l’adéquation des 
posologies dans la pratique clinique quotidienne.

RÉSUMÉ LARGE PUBLIC 
Implémentation du suivi thérapeutique des médicaments dans 
la prise en charge moderne du patient 
Les individus ne sont pas égaux face aux traitements qui leur sont prescrits. Ainsi pour la même 
dose d’un médicament administré, l’exposition, caractérisée par la concentration sanguine du 
médicament, sera variable d’un individu à l’autre. La majeure partie de cette variabilité réside dans 
la phase pharmacocinétique (processus d’absorption, de distribution et d’élimination du 
médicament), c'est-à-dire au niveau de la relation dose – concentration. Parmi les possibilités 
offertes au clinicien, le suivi thérapeutique des médicaments (TDM) est un des outils avantageux 
pouvant aider à la prise en charge médicamenteuse. Le TDM a pour but d’optimiser les traitements 
en proposant des posologies (quelle dose, à quel intervalle?) individualisée, en fonction des 
concentrations du médicament mesurées dans le sang. Pour tenir compte de ces mesures de 
concentration, le calcul Bayesien peut être employé. Il se base sur les données pharmacocinétiques 
en rassemblant des données des individus au sein d’une population. Il représente actuellement la 
méthode de référence pour l’application du TDM mais nécessite néanmoins une certaine expertise 
et une assistance informatique, ce qui limite son application dans la pratique quotidienne. 
L’objectif global de cette thèse était l’implémentation d’outils robustes en routine afin d’offrir un 
TDM Bayesien au clinicien pour une prise en charge moderne du patient. A cette fin, les objectifs 
concrets étaient (i) de concevoir un logiciel efficace et ergonomique pour la réalisation du TDM 
Bayesien : EzeCHieL (ii) de fournir les algorithmes de calcul pour la prédiction Bayesienne de la 
concentration des médicaments, en s’appuyant sur l’approche de population (iii) de résoudre 
certaines questions rencontrées en pratique clinique, (cas des nouveau-nés et de l’adhésion 
thérapeutique càd prise correcte de son traitement par le patient). 
Après avoir réalisé un état des lieux des logiciels existants a pour fournir les spécifications 
nécessaires à l’élaboration d’EzeCHieL, une collaboration étroite avec les ingénieurs en 
informatique a permis la réalisation d’EzeCHieL. EzeCHieL permet d’évaluer si une concentration 
observée chez un patient est « normale », en comparaison avec ce qui serait attendu dans la 
population, si la concentration est adaptée par rapport à la concentration de médicament visée et 
de fournir une adaptation posologique si nécessaire.

Résumé large public 
L’implémentation d’une méthode de calcul Bayesienne pour le TDM nécessite de caractériser la 
pharmacocinétique du médicament et de quantifier la variabilité observée entre les individus et 
chez un même individu. Une approche de population est alors de rigueur. Des analyses de 
population ont été réalisées et les estimateurs nécessaires au calcul Bayesien fournis pour des 
médicaments candidats. Ce travail s’est particulièrement intéressé aux anti-infectieux chez les 
nouveau-nés (gentamicine et imipenème), en se basant sur le développement physiologique.  
Une dernière étude a tenté également d’évaluer l’impact de l’adhésion thérapeutique mesurée en 
routine sur la caractérisation des modèles pharmacocinétiques et sur l’interprétation des 
concentrations sanguines de médicament.  
 
En conclusion, nos résultats proposent des solutions pour assister les cliniciens dans 
l’interprétation des concentrations sanguines de médicament et pour améliorer l’adéquation des 
posologies dans la pratique clinique quotidienne.

CHAPTER I. GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
From Bayesian estimators to dosage individualization

Introduction 
I.1. Drugs and variability in the therapeutic response 
Drug development progressively reaches a fair degree of reliability regarding standard dosage 
recommendations. However, it still devotes insufficient attention to heterogeneity in drug response 
among individuals in terms of both efficacy and safety, which is common and noticed for a long 
time. In 1923, Banting and Macleod were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for 
the discovery of insulin, and the modern era of tailored therapy started when they administered the 
first insulin doses to a patient adjusted to blood sugar level [1]. Already in 1785, William Withering 
titrated the dose of foxglove, against its clinical effects and toxicity [2]. Formal individualization of 
digitalis treatment by drug concentration measurement began in the end of the 60’s [3, 4] when 
drug assays became available. These are only typical examples among many others. Sources of 
variability are multiple including genetic polymorphisms, drug-drug interactions, disease 
conditions, specific patients’ characteristics, etc. In the differences observed in drug response, 
pharmacokinetic (PK) considerations, related to drug disposition and metabolism, are of major 
importance. PK describes the fate of drugs in the body by quantifying the absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion processes. It allows to devise the time-course of systemic exposure of a 
drug (and/or its metabolites) reflected by plasma concentration curves. The relationship between 
plasma drug concentrations and reproduction of a clinically relevant outcome, either the 
pharmacodynamic (PD) phase, or response biomarkers (as PD surrogate) is called PK/PD [5]. 
The largest part of variability in drug response resides in the PK phase, i.e. in the dose-
concentration relationships. In a population, the total variability is made-up of predictable and 
unpredictable variability. The unpredictable variability, i.e. the random variability, is in turn made 
up of both inter-individual -which is not predictable from patients’ characteristics and describes 
variability between individuals- and intra-individual variability – which describes the variability 
around each individual average parameter [6]. 
To consider variability in drug response is not so important for drugs with a wide therapeutic 
interval in which case the “one size fits all” approach holds. However, this issue is particularly acute 

 
4 
Introduction 
for drugs with a therapeutic window narrower than the random population variability [6]. This 
situation often leads to challenges in optimizing a dosage regimen for an individual patient (figure 
1.1). Drug therapy individualization aims of both optimizing drug efficacy and minimizing its 
harms, by prescribing the right drug at the right dose to the right patient [7]. Thus, it also belongs to 
what has been recently called personalized medicine. An approach to drug therapy 
individualization is to design an appropriate dosage regimen for a given patient, based on dose-
concentration relationship. Dosage individualization based on the measurements of drug 
concentration gave rise to the process of what is now called Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM). 
However, in day-to-day practice, drug individualization is often left to prescribers based on their 
own experience, and patient’s clinical status and characteristics, relying on empirical drug 
monitoring procedure [5].

design of dosage regimen (blue dashed arrows) and relationship with drug

Introduction 
I.2. Therapeutic Drug Monitoring 
I.2.1. Basic concepts 
As mentioned above, TDM represents the feedback strategy of tailoring dosing regimen based on 
plasma drug concentration measurements, representing additional information to guide drug 
therapy. It is indeed established that for selected drugs, response can be optimised using this 
approach. For instance, this is current practice for lithium, digoxin, aminoglycosides, 
immunosuppressants, and antiepileptics. Monitoring of protease inhibitors (PI), non- nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and other anti-infectious 
drugs is also progressively adopted in some institutions including ours [8]. Drug candidates for 
TDM need to satisfy a number of criteria [8, 9] as presented in table 1.1.  
Table 1.1. Characteristic requirements for a drug to be a candidate for TDM 
Analytical criteria 
Sensitive and specific analytical method available 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) criteria 
Good knowledge of the PK of the drug of interest 
Large interindividual variability 
Low intraindividual variability 
Low predictability of PK from dose 
Pharmacodynamic (PD) criteria 
Good knowledge of the PD properties of the drug of interest 
Good relationship between drug concentrations and pharmacological effect 
Narrow therapeutic index 
Known target concentrations 
Clinical criteria 
Adequate and easily monitored biomarker not available 
Clinical drug response not easily assessable or not sufficient alone 
Duration of therapy of a sufficient length 
Good interpretation of concentration measurements available 
 
More precisely, TDM can be divided in two types [10]: 
- a priori TDM based on prior knowledge on the patient characteritics to define initial dosage 
regimen and relying on population PK/PD relationships

Introduction 
Figure 1.2. Major steps in TDM 
- a posteriori TDM based on plasma drug concentrations, in order to achieve plasma concentration 
within a target range [11, 12]. As illustrated in figure 1.2, it includes: 
 
A pre-analytical step: blood sample and request on a laboratory form with essential 
information (dosage regimen, time of sampling, last time of dosing, patients characteristics, 
other administered drugs). 
 
An analytical step: rapid, sensitive and specific analytical methods and instruments are key 
for providing reproductible and reliable data that can be used for individualization. 
 
A clinical step: drug concentration are interpreted together with target range and clinical 
individual situation. Dosage adjustment can be advised if the concentration is out of target
 
I.2.2. Pharmacokinetic targets 
A target concentration represents the value, or the range of value, with the greatest probability of 
therapeutic success at a given time [13]. The pharmacokinetic targets depend of the considered 

 
7 
Introduction 
drugs. The most common target is the trough concentration (Ctrough), just before the next dose. For 
anti-infectious drugs, target also depends of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): for 
instance, peak concentration over MIC (aminoglycosides), percentage of time over the MIC 
(carbapenems). For immunosuppressants, although it is debated, many studies suggested that Area 
Under the Curve (AUC) is a better predictor of success than Ctrough [14]. Average concentration can 
also be considered (digoxin). The target concentration may also depend on the indication. This is 
the case for digoxin depending whether it is being used for atrial fibrillation or congestive heart 
failure. For some antibiotics, it may depend of the severity and the site of infection additionally to 
the pathogen involved. 
Thus, for drug concentration interpretation, it requires to sample at an optimal time, which is 
linked to the PK target and it should be performed at steady-state. In practice, this is not always 
possible to sample patient at optimal time, and in this case, concentration prediction at the time of 
interest may be beneficial. 
I.2.3. Methods for dosage regimen initiation and adjustment 
Rather than identical standard dose for all individual patients, nomograms have been proposed to 
facilitate the determination of initial dosing. The sources of variability in the response are 
anticipated. When a plasma concentration is available, the proportional method can be used to 
calculate an adjusted dosage to reach the desired concentration, from the initial observed 
concentration. This method relies on a simple rule of three, but it assumes that kinetics is linear, 
steady-state is achieved, and that either nominal dose or dosage interval would be modified [15-
17]. Regression methods have also been proposed, that consist of determining the slope of 
elimination (in time-1) from at least two measured concentrations during the post-distributive 
phase, from the same interval of dose. The most popular example is certainly the Sawchuk-Zaske 
method for aminoglycosides [18]. Finally, the most recent pharmacokinetic method based on 
Bayesian approach is generally more accurate and more robust [19-21]. The Bayesian strategy 
relies on the population PK/PD studies which is further developed below. A modern trend of TDM 
is given in figure 1.3.

Introduction 
I.3. Population approach and modeling: concept and benefits 
I.3.1. Models and compartments theory 
Model is useful as a representative description of a system, especially designed to facilitate 
calculation and prediction. In pharmacokinetics, it aims to show the dose-concentration 
relationship over time of the drug. Compartment theory is often used in PK, in order to describe the 
fate of a drug: in this case, drug distribution within the body is approximated by a model 
constituted of compartments, represented by boxes. In the boxes, the drug appears kinetically 
distributed. It provides a means for estimating the associated parameters such as clearance and 
volume of distribution. An example of a two-compartment model is given in figure 1.4 that includes 
a central compartment, of which plasma is a part and a peripheral compartment, but do not 
necessarily represent any anatomical region of the body [22, 23]. In the population approach, it is 
called the structural model and it can be stated as differential equations (see below).

administration with pharmacokinetic parameters: Vc = Central 
volume of distribution, Vp = peripheral volume of distribution, Q = 
intercompartmental clearance, CL = total clearance 
 
I.3.2. Population pharmacokinetic modeling 
In the early 70’s, clinical PK largely benefited of population PK modeling emergence. Its objective is 
to describe plasma concentration-time profile with mathematical and statistical models using 

 
10 
Introduction 
sparse blood samples in a whole population. Development of the fixed-effects model allows indeed 
simultaneous analysis of data collected in a population. However, most of the models used in PK are 
nonlinear with time, and in such cases, mathematical calculation is complicated. In the 70’s and 
early 80’s, Sheiner and Beal developed the first method adapted to nonlinear mixed effect model, at 
the University of California, San Francisco: here was born population PK. They also proposed the 
first nonlinear mixed effect modeling software: NONMEM® [24]. In addition to providing the 
average behaviour of the group (the mean plasma concentration-time course), population PK 
provides an opportunity to estimate variability on various PK parameters, identify its sources and 
quantify the unexplained part of variability [25]. 
Population PK is usually characterized in terms of: 
(i) 
Fixed effects: representing the population average of the model parameters θ 
(clearance and volume of distribution). These parameters are susceptible to various 
factors, such as physiological characteristics (age, gender, body weight, renal status, 
etc), genetic characteristics, or drug-drug interactions. These last factors are the fixed 
effect covariates, zi. 
(ii) 
Random effects: this is the part of the variability that is not explained by the above 
fixed effect and permits quantification of: 
 
The interindividual variability (also called the between subject variability), which is 
the variability between two different individuals. It is expressed by ω2, which is the 
variance of the fixed effect parameter θ. For an individual i, θi = θ + ηi where ηi 
follows a normal distribution with a variance ω2. 
 
The intraindividual variability (also called the residual unexplained variability), 
which is the variability within the same individual over time i.e. between two given 
moments. It is expressed by σ2. For an observation j, the corresponding prediction ŷ 
by     = ŷ + εij where εij follows a normal distribution with a variance of σ2. 

 
11 
Introduction 
Thus, the general mixed effects model is written: 
    =                
And the parameter model: 
   = g           
Where     is the jth observation in an individual i,     is a known quantity (time or dose),    is the 
pharmacokinetic parameter vector for an individual i, and     represents the residual error; g is a 
structural model which is function of fixed effects covariates zi, and fixed effects parameters θ; 
finally,   represents the pharmacokinetic model (like one, two or three compartments, linear or 
non-linear kinetics). In this general model, residual error     is additive, and means that each 
measurement is assumed to be equally precise for all values of    . When error changes with 
differing values of    ,      is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with median 1 and a 
constant coefficient of variation. Combinations of additive and log-normal errors can also be used 
[26]. 
The model that best fits the analyzed data is determined by the maximum likelihood approach. 
NONMEM® estimates the best values of θ, ω2, σ2 that give the lowest value of the objective function 
(OF). Complementary to the maximum likelihood approach, diagnostics graphics and values of 
coefficients of variation will be analyzed to determine the final model [26]. 
The advantages of population PK reside in being able to treat sparse data, and thus the possibility to 
use the information generated during patient routine care. Estimation of random and fixed effects 
allows development and improvement in dosing strategies for specific population of patients 
(neonates, paediatrics, elderly, dialysis, disease,…) who will eventually received the drug of interest. 
As it will be presented in the following paragraph, it permits Bayesian feedback analysis to be 
performed for TDM [25]. 
 
 

 
12 
Introduction 
I.4. From population to individual: Bayesian forecasting 
To forecast individual PK parameters with precision in a given patient is central to make optimal 
dosage decision. The Bayesian approach is more accurate and precise for this purpose as it 
estimates individual PK parameters that will be most consistent with serum level predicted by the 
model and the actual measured concentration. It balances deviation of the individual’s model-
predicted concentration (  ) from observed concentration (Cobs) and the deviation of the 
individual’s estimated parameters values (  ) from the population parameter value (  
 ). It uses the 
prior probability distribution of the individual’s parameters set in the light of the observed 
concentration to give the posterior distribution. The posterior distribution has a different mode than 
the prior one, and its new mode is used for the next forecasting round (figure 1.5). It takes into 
account uncertainty over individual parameters and measurements error [27-29].

Introduction 
Bayesian optimization criterion is based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP), for normal 
distribution assumption, and minimizes the following expression [29] for estimates of parameters

Individual parameters values, individual-predicted concentrations and residuals-parameters values 
are thus estimated by the so-called post hoc estimation (or empirical bayes estimates (EBE) 
estimation). It is used for the refinement of a patient dosage regimen that can be based only on one 
measured concentration. This process is presented in figure 1.6.

Introduction 
I. 5. Implementation of Bayesian estimator for dosage individualization 
 I. 5.1. Computer tools and new technologies 
Bayesian forecasting method is computational demanding and necessitates intensive numerical 
integration [30]. Thus, its implementation in the health care system context requires appropriate 
computing platforms for integrating all information gathered, adequate resources and effective 
communication. The 20th century saw the advent of computer, and computerization in medicine has 
evolved with time and the modernization of health care facilities since the 60’s [31]. It also 
benefited from the development of Internet and the Web. As we have moved to the 21st century, we 
have come to rely more and more on the Internet and Web 2.0. Medicine is not left behind, witness 
of the development of Health 2.0, eHealth, Health Information Technology (HIT), mobile Health 
(mHealth) [32, 33]. HIT can be defined as a diverse set of technologies for transmitting and 
managing health information for use by consumers, providers, and all other groups with an interest 
in health and health care, such as payers and insurers. HIT displays a variety of systems, such as 
computerized storage and reporting of laboratory results, electronic health records, or novel 
systems that permit interoperability, i.e. permit clinicians to share information about patients 
across institutional boundaries and even all over the globe. HIT has improved quality and efficiency, 
and eventually reduced health care costs. Its effective use also resides in its ability to retrieve data, 
organize them, apply algorithms, and provide the results to clinicians when and where they need it 
[34]. Products and services based on HIT remains relatively small and undeveloped in medicine 
compared to most other sectors of the economy [35]. The most advanced progression into these 
new possibilities is represented by mHealth. mHealth technology that encompass Smartphone and 
embedded tablets are slowly changing healthcare, with more than 17,000 applications today 
available for mobile devices, for a large panel of tasks either for clinicians, hospitals or directly for 
patients [36]. Use of mHealth technology leads to “put doctor in patients pocket and to jump to 
personalized medicine” [35].

Introduction 
The present thesis focuses only on the contribution of the Division of Clinical Pharmacology (CHUV) 
to this project. Our division has a longstanding experience on drug dosage individualization, along 
with technical competences in population PK/PD. As previously mentioned, monitoring relies 
almost exclusively on empirical procedure in the medical community, and drug monitoring still 
represents a significant challenge for modern health care. Translation of concentration 
measurements values into personalized treatment advices requires yet the integration of efficient 
and ergonomic computer tools into the system, with communication capabilities, which are 
nowadays becoming a standard in many aspects of medical care. Thus, development of an easy-to-
use and efficient clinical decision support system (CDSS) [37] for health care providers appears 
crucial and lead to EzeCHieL subproject in 2010. It results from close collaboration between the 
division of Clinical Pharmacology and the software engineers from HEIG-VD, who are in charge of 
software development. Figure 1.8 represents CHUV contribution to ISyPeM and especially where 
EzeCHieL realization currently stands. Later, it will be integrated into others ISyPeM devices, once 
available.

Introduction 
I. 6. Examples of some pharmacokinetic issues in clinical practice 
I. 6.1. Special group of patients: focus on neonates 
Certain patients’ group (elderly, pediatrics, critically ill, patients with renal failure, obese) are 
difficult to study because of ethical and logistic issues. During drug development, studies deal with 
more or less selected subgroups, most of the time quite homogenous (healthy volunteer, patient 
with few associated co-morbidities). Much of the drug PK is thus unknown once it is released on the 
market [38]. 
For instance, no consensus has been reached for dose selection in children but this is often obtained 
from extrapolation in another population of reference, where the relations between covariates and 
parameters is characterised. Implicitly, this means that the following hypotheses are accepted: the 
structural model, variability and covariance are identical; there is continuous covariate-parameters 
relationship; the correlation between covariate and parameters is identical in the new population; 
and there is no other significant covariate in the population of extrapolation. However, it does not 
take into account the developmental change across paediatric populations [39] [40]. There are 
biological basis for using size and maturation to describe PK in this population and, actually, size 
and age are considered as primary covariates for PK model.  
Body size (body weight (BW)) is the most important predictor for elimination process [41]. Most 
body size relation is often described following an allometric relation:            
   
      
    
. 
Volume shows direct proportionality to body weight:          
   
      
 
 [42]. The value of the 
coefficient of 0.75 used to scale the process of clearance is an empirically derived constant that has 
also been discussed throughout the literature, and it cannot be applied solely for infants without a 
maturation function. Maturation (Age) is used to describe processes that are associated with time 
course and not dependent of size. Maturation of clearance starts before birth, taking into account 
gestational age, additionally to age, thus often leads to better prediction, especially because birth 
may occur prematurely [43]. There are examples of allometric extrapolation from adult to teenager 
or children. But there is no universal method of extrapolation in infants (< 2 to 5 years old) due to

Introduction 
Figure 1.9. Adherence in the PK/PD picture 
growth and organ maturation process. Regarding the important need of information for these 
groups, use of information generated during the routine care of patient to obtain estimates is 
advocated and is facilitate by population method and modeling [44]. Neonates are of particular 
interest; since birth seems also to have consequences on maturation that is poorly documented [41, 
42]. 
I. 6.2. Medication adherence 
Medication adherence implies persistence, which refers to continuing the treatment for the 
prescribed duration and, execution which refers to the patterns of patient adherence behavior 
(percentage of days with correct dosing, percentage of correct dosing intervals, drug holidays) [45]. 
The ultimate consequence of poor medication adherence is its contribution to a negative 
therapeutic outcome, especially in chronic disease. While a number of covariates related to the 
clinical response are studied to the clinical response, patient adherence is rarely measured or taken 
into consideration. However, addition of adherence in the PK/PD picture shows how it complicates 
both: drug pharmacokinetic characterization and dosage regimen definition (figure 1.9. adherence 
in the PK/PD concept).  
 
Deviation from taking medication as prescribed is a source of variation in drug exposure and thus 
in the global pharmacotherapy. It can lead to an incorrect description of the PK/PD models. 
Assuming that medications are taken exactly as prescribed when it is not the case can lead to biased 
model parameter estimates and to misleading clinical outcome interpretation. Quantitative 

 
19 
Introduction 
measurement of medication adherence can decrease the residual variability up to 50% [46] and can 
substantially remove noise in the PK/PD models [47]. 
Patterns of non adherence also influence TDM intervention. Most TDM intervention assumes a full 
adherence and steady-state condition and the “white coat compliance” (defined as an improved 
medication adherence just before a clinic visit) makes less reliable TDM measurements [48]. 
Individual Bayesian calculations are affected if a wrong dosing history is assumed. In returns, it can 
biased dosage recommendation [49]. 
Consequences of poor adherence depend of drug’s PK and PD properties. Antimicrobials and 
antivirals are frequently unforgiving. Half-life is often quite short, and the rate of potential mutation 
in pathogens is high, which makes essential to maintain an effective concentration throughout the 
dosing interval. Even so, there is a lack of research combining medication adherence variables with 
PK, and a poor understanding of the impact of such model [50].  
I. 7. Objectives of the thesis 
The overall objective of this research is to provide advances in Bayesian drug dosage 
individualization and to allow its implementation in the routine care. 
To that endeavour, the purposes of this thesis are: 
i. 
To elaborate an efficient and ergonomic computer tool for TDM, EzeCHieL (chapter II), by: 
 
Systematically reviewing currents programs available in practice, in order to 
evaluate needs, to provide specifications and to support development of EzeCHieL. 
 
Participating actively in the elaboration of EzeCHieL particularly in the conception, 
testing and validation of the software, in close collaboration with the engineers. 
ii. 
To provide drugs’ algorithms for Bayesian forecasting and validation, relying on population 
approach (chapter III). 
iii. 
To address some practical issues met during TDM intervention such as better 
understanding causes of variability in drug exposure (specific population, adherence), and 
to optimise TDM intervention via EzeCHieL (Chapter III and Chapter IV).

Chapter II in the thesis context 
The global project of this thesis arose from the observation that an adequate tool to offer Bayesian 
TDM at large scale was missing 
The first part of this chapter is presenting a review of the current software tools available regarding 
TDM. In the last decades, several programs have yet been designed to assist clinicians in 
interpreting blood drug concentrations and to improve the appropriateness of drug dosing in 
routine clinical practice. The purpose of this review was to establish the current stage of the 
existing software to evaluate the limits of these current tools and to propose specifications for the 
development of our new tool, EzeCHieL. 
Following this review, the question was “what can we do yet”? The second part of this chapter is 
presenting the concept of EzeCHieL, and intuitive and flexible software intended to assist clinicians 
in TDM interpretation. Different capabilities embeds by the software regarding drug exposure 
prediction, drug treatment indication and interoperability amongst others are under elaboration. 
Its current stage of realization, since the beginning of its development in 2010 is given.

ABSTRACT 
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) aims to optimize treatments by individualizing dosage 
regimens based on the measurement of blood concentrations. Dosage individualization to maintain 
concentrations within a target range requires pharmacokinetic and clinical capabilities. Bayesian 
calculations currently represent the gold standard TDM approach but require computation 
assistance. In recent decades computer programs have been developed to assist clinicians in this 
assignment. The aim of this survey was to assess and compare computer tools designed to support 
TDM clinical activities. The literature and the Internet were searched to identify software. All 
programs were tested on personal computers. Each program was scored against a standardized 
grid covering pharmacokinetic relevance, user friendliness, computing aspects, interfacing and 
storage. A weighting factor was applied to each criterion of the grid to account for its relative 
importance. To assess the robustness of the software, six representative clinical vignettes were 
processed through each of them. Altogether, 12 software tools were identified, tested and ranked, 
representing a comprehensive review of the available software. Numbers of drugs handled by the 
software vary widely (from two to 180), and eight programs offer users the possibility of adding 
new drug models based on population pharmacokinetic analyses. Bayesian computation to predict 
dosage adaptation from blood concentration (a posteriori adjustment) is performed by ten tools, 
while nine are also able to propose a priori dosage regimens, based only on individual patient 
covariates such as age, sex and bodyweight. Among those applying Bayesian calculation, MM-
USC*PACK© uses the non-parametric approach. The top two programs emerging from this 
benchmark were MwPharm© and TCIWorks. Most other programs evaluated had good potential 
while being less sophisticated or less user friendly. Programs vary in complexity and might not fit 
all healthcare settings. Each software tool must therefore be regarded with respect to the individual 
needs of hospitals or clinicians. Programs should be easy and fast for routine activities, including 
for non-experienced users. Computer assisted TDM is gaining growing interest and should further

improve, especially in terms of information system interfacing, user friendliness, data storage 
capability and report generation. 
II.1.1. Introduction 
The monitoring of drug therapy aims to forecast treatment success, failure or toxicity, and to adjust 
prescriptions as a consequence. Circulating drug concentration is a traditional pharmacokinetic 
surrogate used for this purpose, in what is called therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) [1]. TDM 
assumes that circulating drug concentrations better predict the effect of pharmaceutical agents and 
clinical outcome than doses. Practically, TDM approaches attempt to optimize individual dosage 
regimens through the maintenance of concentrations within a given therapeutic range [2]. Dosage 
individualization consists either of a priori adjustment (without blood drug concentration 
measurement) based on demographic, biological, pharmacogenetic and clinical covariates, or of a 
posteriori adjustment based on drug concentration determination [3]. TDM-guided dosage 
individualization is currently applied to a number of drugs such as antibacterials, anticonvulsants, 
digoxin and immunosuppressants [4]. Major benefits for patients reside in optimizing the drug 
concentration exposure, leading to more rapid and sustained therapeutic control and to improved 
safety, which might even reduce the duration of hospitalization [1, 5]. Maintaining optimal drug 
concentrations is, however, a complex and demanding task. It requires solid knowledge of 
evidence-based clinical guidelines, clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, as well as definite 
mathematical skills for dosage calculation [5]. It therefore represents a time-consuming activity for 
healthcare professionals and often requires the intervention of a specialist [1]. In such 
circumstances, computer-assisted decision making [6] is advantageous, as algorithms implemented 
enable the automated calculation of doses, while integrating patients’ individual factors such as age, 
bodyweight, sex, kidney function, disease and drug interactions along with drug concentration 
results [7, 8]. Whereas most industries have experienced an information technology revolution 
since the 1980s, healthcare systems are generally moving rather slowly in that direction [9]. The 

 
30 
Computer Tools 
main healthcare domain currently undergoing profound transformation is the field of electronic 
medical records and of networks to share these medical data [9, 10]. Dispensation and dosing of 
drugs also represent a field of interest in which intelligent technologies could be useful [10]. In 
parallel, technological efforts towards the miniaturization of monitoring tests (e.g. TDM 
determinations) are necessary [11], along with the development of robust and user-friendly 
computer tools to provide seamless monitoring services in clinics [1]. Indeed, in recent decades, 
several programs have been designed to assist clinicians in interpreting blood drug concentrations 
and to improve the appropriateness of drug dosing in routine clinical practice [12-19]. Recently, 
computer-assisted decision tools for monitoring gained renewed attention, holding further 
potential for TDM-guided dosing optimization. In 1993, Buffington et al. [12] published a review of 
computer programs designed for TDM-guided dosage optimization available in the USA. Since then, 
however, few evaluations on this type of software have been presented, and no further review has 
ever been published to our knowledge. The aim of this survey is to provide an updated comparative 
evaluation of all software designed for routine TDM-guided dosage adjustment that is widely 
available throughout the world. 
II.1.2. Search strategy and selection criteria 
A literature search for clinical pharmacokinetic software programs was performed through 
MEDLINE (1966 to October 2012) and Google using the following keywords: therapeutic drug 
monitoring, software, program, computerized, clinical pharmacokinetics, computer assisted 
decision-making, dosing, drug dosage. The web portal of David Bourne’s pharmPK forum [20]  was 
also used as a resource for program identification. As programs widely differ in their features, their 
expected characteristics had to be assessed along multiple axes. This led to the design of a 
comprehensive evaluation grid to standardize the comparison of software. Criteria were defined 
based on the authors’ experience in routine TDM practice. General characteristics addressed were 
as follows: user interface, visual aspect, user friendliness; possibility of interfacing with other 

 
31 
Computer Tools 
hospital software (e.g. laboratory software or patient’s medical records); possibility to store 
patient’s or user’s information; the quality of report generated for physicians; the cost; and 
computational aspects such as import and export functions. To take into account the variety of fee 
schemes, prices were calculated for a 5-year annual subscription. Pharmacokinetic aspects 
addressed were as follows: drugs and type of population covered by the programs; type of models, 
calculation approaches, simulation capabilities; modularity; quality of pharmacokinetic plots 
generated; and further utilities such as creatinine clearance calculation. The full grid of criteria is 
available in Tables 2.SI and 2.SII of the Online Resource. The evaluation of all software programs 
was performed on a standard personal computer by one pharmacist user, backed up by two clinical 
pharmacologists experienced in computing and the clinical practice of TDM. A score was assigned 
to each criterion, ranging from 1 (for the lowest performance) to 5 (for the highest performance). 
For binary items (yes/no), a score of either 2 or 4 was allocated and for ternary criteria a score of 1, 
3 or 5 was allocated to balance the marks attributed. Scoring definitions are detailed in the Online 
Resource (Table 2.SI). The scoring approach had to be balanced, since criteria obviously differ in 
their importance. In that endeavour, five physicians, five pharmacists and five computer engineers 
were asked to attribute a weight from 1 to 3 to each criterion (1 for low importance, 2 for useful but 
not essential and 3 for essential). A final weighting factor for each criterion was then calculated by 
arithmetic average. Finally, a ranking of the software programs could be established by summing 
the weighted scores to obtain a global score for each program. Scores by category were also 
calculated in order to appraise more finely the various facets of the programs. When characteristics 
of programs were unclear, contact with the authors or developers was sought to clarify relevant 
points. Validation by the author or by the software developing company was proposed and the grid 
was distributed to those willing to participate. They were asked to fill it in using the explanatory 
table sent along with the grid (Table 2.SI). This allowed a double-control and confirmation of 
missing information. To improve the robustness of our evaluation, six clinical vignettes, inspired by 

 
32 
Computer Tools 
real clinical TDM cases encountered in our routine activity, were also tested. These cases aided the 
evaluation of the software based on systematic testing of real-life situations. They also provided an 
insight of a priori and a posteriori predictions offered, and of the type of specific cases that could 
typically be handled by the programs. 
II.1.3. Therapeutic drug monitoring software 
II.1.3.1. History and evolution 
USC*PACK© was the first available software dedicated to monitoring and dosage adjustment. 
Developed by the Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics at the University of Southern California 
(Los Angeles, CA, USA) and launched in 1973 [21], it is still in use and evolving. It represents a 
comprehensive software that includes MM-USC*PACK© (now called RightDoseTM) and is designed 
for clinical practice and dosage adjustment. Later, in 1982, the Department of Pharmacology and 
Pharmacotherapy at the University of Groninigen (Groningen, The Netherlands) developed 
MwPharm©. MediWare (Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic), now hosting the program, 
was established in 1987. Abbott Laboratories also developed a software package in the early 1990s 
called Abbottbase Pharmacokinetic Systems or PKS [18]. It was widely used, at least in the USA, 
during the 1990s [12]. The program distribution has, however, been discontinued for some years. 
Similarly, there are other programs that existed in the 1990s but are no longer available (e.g. 
SeBAGEN [22], ATM [13], Simkin [23]). Either they are not marketed any more, or their 
development was merged with other software. For example, Kinetidex® has been Thomson Reuters’ 
software since 2001, resulting from a merge between Simkin and Micromedex®. In the meantime, 
other initiatives have appeared, mostly from the academic field. A pharmacist from Creighton 
University (Omaha, NB, USA) developed multiple programs dedicated to assisting hospital 
pharmacy practice under the global name RxKinetics© Software. Among them, three programs are 
intended for dosage adjustment, with the first one, Kinetics©, launched in 1986. More recently, 
programs have been developed in Asia. JPKD® for desktop and TDM for R (which is a variant of 

 
33 
Computer Tools 
JPKD® developed as a plug-in for the R statistical program) were both developed by Kaoshiung 
Medical University (Kaoshiung, Taiwan) and released in 2006. New initiatives are still emerging, 
the latest of which comes from the University of Otago (Dunedin, New Zealand) and the University 
of Queensland (Brisbane, QLD, Australia), which released the first version of TCIWorks in 2011. 
II.1.3.2. Widely available software packages 
Twelve clinical pharmacokinetic programs were identified: MM-USC*PACK©, MwPharm©, 
TCIWorks, JPKD®, TDM for R, Antibiotic Kinetics©, APK©, Kinetics©, Kinetidex®, T.D.M.S. 2000TM, 
DataKineticsTM, RADKinetics. Antibiotic Kinetics©, APK© and Kinetics© belong to the RxKinetics© 
programs. Specific versions reviewed are indicated in Table 2.1.1. Moreover, major features are 
described for each software in Tables 2.1.2 and 2.1.3. All criteria considered are presented in the 
detailed evaluation grid accessible in the Online Resource (Table 2.SII), with their associated 
weight. A summary of the results, scored by category and ranked, is shown in Table 2.1.4. We were 
able to contact authors or the developing company for 11 of the 12 programs (only developers from 
RADKinetics could not be reached because of broken links on their website and unavailability of 
contact information). Some developers declined participation, considering either that it was 
difficult to self-rate items or that our demand included requests for information viewed as 
proprietary. Eventually, five developers provided feedback for MM-USC*PACK©, MwPharm©, 
Antibiotic Kinetics©, APK©, Kinetics©, JPKD®, TDM for R, and T.D.M.S. 2000TM. Among these 12 
programs, DataKineticsTM is no longer marketed. A website still exists for RADKinetics and the 
program can be downloaded, but there is apparently neither support nor updates anymore. There 
has been no update for JPKD® since 2007, but support is still available.

II.1.3.3. Software requirements and individual characteristics 
General characteristics 
Nowadays, all of the recent program versions run on the Windows® operating system (Microsoft 
Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). Kinetidex® runs only on US-English Windows®. Kinetics© is sold only in 
the USA, Canada and the UK (as it uses a dot to separate decimals instead of a comma as in other 
countries). As users of personal digital assistants, smartphones and Mac® computers (Apple, 
Cupertino, CA, USA) dramatically increased over the last few years; this should also be taken into 
consideration. At present, JPKD®, APK© and Kinetics© have developed an application for mobile 
devices. TCIWorks, JPKD® and TDM for R can be run on Mac OS X® environment (Apple). The 
Internet is the most rapid and convenient media for presentation and distribution of software. All of 
the software packages are hosted on websites, ranging from a simple advertisement for Kinetidex® 
to a comprehensive source of information with technical information, including teaching topics 
and/or screenshots, for JPKD® or MM-USC*PACK©. Most programs are easy to download through 
the Internet, at least as demonstration versions. The importance of support documentation should 
not be underestimated and a user manual should be part of the software bundle. Technical and 
sometimes clinical manuals are included with most software packages. However, there is a large 
discrepancy between software, ranging from a ‘getting started’ guide for T.D.M.S. 2000TM, 
MwPharm© or TCIWorks, to a comprehensive manual directly integrated into the software 
withword search capability for the RxKinetics©, DataKineticsTM and Kinetidex® programs. In 
addition to documentation, JPKD® and TDM for R publish video demonstrations on their respective 
websites. Kinetidex® and DataKineticsTM also provide sample cases that are included in their 
documentation. Only a few of the programs include information on drugs’ pharmacokinetics, or 
even sometimes TDM itself (e.g. the RxKinetics© programs and DataKineticsTM). In addition, 
convenient contact details for support are important. The RxKinetics© programs and the new 
version of MM-USC*PACK© (now known as RightDoseTM) also offer access to a users’ forum for 

 
38 
Computer Tools 
questions and discussions. Another requirement for TDM software is the ability to interface with 
laboratory information management systems, especially for collecting blood drug concentrations, 
receiving administrative and clinical patient data, and sending reports to patient’s electronic 
records. Although interfacing with hospital information systems may be challenging, since they 
differ worldwide, initiatives such as Health Level Seven International (HL7; http://www.hl7.org/) 
aim to standardize electronic health data transfer. Additionally, interfaces have been developed in 
recent years for applications that do not support HL7 standard and thus allow interoperability. 
MwPharm© is the only program that can be relatively easily interfaced with hospital information 
systems through the MirthTM Connect technology (Mirth Corp., Irvine, CA, USA). For administrative 
and some demographic data, the software designers behind RxKinetics© have developed a basic 
interface to allow a health information system to dump such data into the software. Users may 
ideally wish to record their patients’ administrative and clinical data, as well as concentration 
measurements and predictions issued. MwPharm©, TCIWorks, Kinetics©, Kinetidex® and T.D.M.S. 
2000TM have full patient databases that store patients’ administrative data, as well as dosages and 
drug concentration results that were entered for dosage individualization. USC*PACK© does not 
have a fully integrated database but can save patients’ data on a local file on the user’s personal 
computer. Some other programs only have an administrative database that records patients’ basic 
data. Another issue is the confidentiality of data: APK®, Kinetics© and MwPharm© use an 
encrypted database. Software must be able to generate reports that can be transmitted to 
physicians and have the ability to save the possible associated advice consultation into the patient’s 
medical records. Quality and readability of the report generated vary widely between programs, 
from TDM reports that are not transmissible to physicians to clear, printable reports with a highly 
structured core (it should be noted that TDM for R does not generate any kind of report). Essential 
information comprises patient administrative and clinical data, history of drug dosages and 
concentration measurements, and a clearly readable pharmacokinetic interpretation. In addition, 

 
39 
Computer Tools 
some reports can include a free text field that can be filled in by the consultant. Reports ideally need 
to be customizable to better meet each institution’s visual identity guidelines. Another important 
issue that users face during the choice of software is its cost. Surprisingly, costs are not consistently 
weighted with regards to software capabilities. Some are free (TCIWorks, JPKD®, TDM for R), others 
are subject to a one-off donation (MM-USC*PACK©), while others require a first-year subscription 
fee followed by a license charge for subsequent years, which basically includes provision for 
updates. Graphical user interface (GUI) is a must-have nowadays. Each program has a unique 
graphical design that makes it more or less user-friendly but definitely facilitates navigation across 
windows, files or menus. Only TDM for R is based on a command-line interface. For research 
purposes, import/export capabilities could represent a valuable feature. Few programs offer this 
facility: JPKD® allows for exporting data in comma-separated variables (CSV) format; MwPharm© 
offers import and export possibilities in structured text (TXT) format; extraction of administrative 
data is possible from APK©, in CSV format, but as it concerned only administrative data, it was not 
considered as data exportation for the purpose of this evaluation. APK© was noted to have the best 
result in the ‘general characteristics’ category, closely followed by MwPharm© (Table 2.1.4). APK© 
offers a simple solution and is remarkably flexible, particularly for non-experienced users, while 
having a favourable cost–quality ratio. MwPharm© and TCIWorks also offer many interesting 
features but represent more sophisticated tools.

Pharmacokinetic aspects 
The number of drugs covered by each program varies from two for RADKinetics to more than 180 
for MwPharm© (Table 2.1.5). The drug of interest can be chosen in the library offered by the 
program. For some programs, even definitions of specific populations for drug use are available 
(e.g. neonates). Few programs take into account drug and/or disease interactions: T.D.M.S. 2000TM, 
MwPharm©, JPKD® and Kinetidex®. Moreover, in the last decade, important progress has been 
achieved in the field of pharmacogenetics, which can be used for a priori dosage regimen 
adaptation in some clinical situations [24]. Integrating a TDM and pharmacogenetics approach 
therefore appears more and more suitable for optimization of pharmacotherapy in the context of 

 
41 
Computer Tools 
personalized medicine [25, 26]. Additionally, some food-drug interactions are progressively being 
discovered, which involve various mechanisms such as an increase or decrease of bioavailability or 
an induction or inhibition of metabolism [27, 28]. The most famous examples are probably those 
involving grapefruit or alcohol [29]. When sufficiently described and quantified, pharmacogenetic 
features and these interactions should certainly be included in TDM programs in the near future. A 
fundamental pharmacokinetic aspect of programs concerns the possibility for the user to add their 
own drug models. In eight programs (MwPharm©, MM-USC*PACK©, TCIWorks, Antibiotic 
Kinetics©, APK©, Kinetics©, JPKD®, T.D.M.S. 2000TM), a new model for a drug or a population can 
be defined within an ‘add drug model interface’ provided, by entering model parameters either 
from a single population pharmacokinetic study or from a systematic pharmacokinetic review of 
studies. For example, APK© offers pre-defined parameter fields using a one-compartment model 
where the values have to be entered, whereas some other programs can handle 
multicompartmental models or different types of administration. USC*PACK© employs a non-
parametric adaptive grid (NPAG) program[30], which makes it more complicated for non-
experienced users but has the great advantage of accommodating any kind of model of up to three 
compartments. Conversely, TCIWorks offers a very simple and intuitive tool for the user to add 
his/her own model of up to two compartments. Moreover, it offers the possibility to freely import 
and export drug models plugged in as extensible markup language (XML) data format and thus 
easily shares drugs models. APK©, Antibiotic Kinetics© and RADKinetics account only for 
intravenous administration owing to the fact that drugs handled by these programs are only given 
through this route of administration. Only the more sophisticated packages (i.e. MM-USC*PACK©, 
TCIWorks, MwPharm©, Kinetidex®, T.D.M.S. 2000TM) are able to handle data for drugs 
administered by continuous intravenous infusions. Those same programs are also able to deal with 
non-steady state and irregular regimens, which represents a substantial feature. In fact, they offer a 
convenient interface to enter concentrations with detailed information on dosage history. It is 

 
42 
Computer Tools 
worth noting that APK© and Kinetics© can deal with non-steady state situations, but require three 
concentration–time data points. APK© is also able to deal with a first dose, but requires at least two 
concentration–time data points to perform calculations, and would not use a Bayesian analysis in 
that case, but rather a simple regression approach. It is crucial that programs document the 
prediction and individualization methods employed to ensure accuracy and appropriateness. 
Equations are, however, detailed in only a minority of support sources, namely in T.D.M.S. 2000TM, 
DataKineticsTM, MwPharm© or RxKinetics©. Whereas in the 1990s only half of the programs 
offered Bayesian prediction [12], nowadays such approaches are widely implemented; ten of 12 
programs offer such techniques. This is particularly convenient for routine practice because of the 
limited number of samples required and the flexibility of sampling times. It is worth noting that 
only MM-USC*PACK© uses a non-parametric approach, which provides the advantage of assuming 
no distribution and of allowing subpopulation clusters[31], which is not easily achievable with 
normal or log-normal distribution assumptions [32]. Nine of the computer tools are able to 
compute an a priori regimen and, among those, seven are also able to estimate a loading dose. For 
users who would not know concentration targets, default therapeutic range targets are often 
provided by the software. To be easily used according to up-to-date institution recommendations 
or specific patient cases, therapeutic targets should be readily modifiable, which is the case in most 
software packages. Pharmacokinetic curve plotting is offered by all software except JPKD® (which 
proposes it only for aminoglycosides), RADKinetics and TDM for R. Only MM-USC*PACK© offers the 
option to include the population variability through adding percentiles to plots.  From a clinical 
point of view, it is essential that clinicians be aware of the creatinine clearance of certain drugs. 
Many programs, in addition to Cockroft-Gault, suggest other creatinine clearance calculations such 
as Schwartz, Cockroft-Gault adjusted to bodyweight, MDRD or Jelliffe’s equations. TDM for R and 
JPKD® do not provide this parameter. Regarding this ‘pharmacokinetic aspects’ category, the most 

 
43 
Computer Tools 
sophisticated programs had the highest scores: MwPharm©, MM-USC*PACK© and TCIWorks 
(Table 2.1.4). 
Authors 
All programs have been developed by pharmacists and/or medical doctors, usually supported by 
skilled computer specialists. They were all developed in an academic environment (except perhaps 
for Kinetidex®, for which no information could be obtained). TCIWorks received grant support from 
a pharmaceutical company (Pfizer) among other academic sponsors. Only two programs have been 
described in the literature in the past (USC*PACK© [21] and MwPharm© [19]), but the publications 
concern old versions. Literature regarding the use of the programs is also quite poor. However, 
among the literature that does exist, USC*PACK© is the best furnished, particularly regarding its 
use in clinical practice [33-36]. TCIWorks has also recently started to be documented as well [37, 
38].  
2.1.3.4. Clinical vignettes 
Clinical vignettes were tested in each program whenever possible (see Table 2.SIII in the online 
Resource), in order to again insight into dose adjustments and predicted concentrations. These 
results are only presented for descriptive purposes. As much as possible, vignettes were entered 
into each program in the same manner. However, difficulties were encountered, such as (i) 
introduction of a first dose or interruption of treatment, especially when a dosing interval or a 
delay before restarting treatment was indicated; (ii) drug administered in neonates and low 
bodyweight patients; and (iii) administration by continuous intravenous infusions. Nevertheless, 
when vignettes were able to be processed, most of them roughly converged to a similar prediction, 
except for phenytoin (a drug characterized by non-linear kinetics), where extrapolated 
concentrations were aberrant in some programs.

II.1.3.5. Overall classification 
From a global benchmarking point of view, MwPharm© and TCIWorks turned out to be the best 
ranked TDM programs. Because they represent sophisticated tools, they fulfil many of the criteria 
considered: both are complete software offering calculation of patient parameters, a priori and a 
posteriori dose suggestions, a structured patient database and good quality reports. However, such 
tools can be rather complex to use, which is especially true for MwPharm©, whereas TCIWorks is 
more intuitive. MwPharm© benefits from a large drug library, but, unfortunately, no description of 
the drug models is available, which means that not all drugs are easily usable. TCIWorks does not 
have a drug library yet. USC*PACK© should also be considered as a comprehensive software; 
however, despite its large number of users worldwide, it lacks user friendliness and flexibility 
compared with other programs and provides no structured database or report transmissible to 
practitioners. The success of the software definitely lies in its good pharmacokinetic capabilities 
and its long experience. The three RxKinetics© programs, Antibiotic Kinetics©, APK© (the third 
best classified program) and Kinetics©, offer simpler but very flexible solutions, particularly for 
non-experienced users, with a good cost/capabilities ratio. Antibiotic Kinetics© is the least 
sophisticated of the three, and is unable to save any patient or consultation data. APK© and 
Kinetics© provide patient records and reports of good quality. These computer tools aim to deal 
with daily clinical practice. T.D.M.S. 2000TM and Kinetidex® also offer nice features with Bayesian 
analysis, a database, and the ability to detail complete patient dose administration and 
concentration measurements. However, these programs are expensive. User friendliness could be 
improved for most software, especially T.D.M.S. 2000TM. JPKD® and TDM for R allow a simple 
adaptation from a single measurement at steady state. JPKD® is a simple, intuitive, convenient and 
free tool. Conversely, TDM for R requires the user to already be an experienced R user.

II.1.4. Discussion 
Overall, for many years now, lots of effort has been put into the development of computer tools 
throughout the world to facilitate the practice of TDM and to provide reliable dosing optimization 
advice with convenient and complete software. This article presents a comprehensive review of the 
characteristics of the available software. From simple, efficient and low-cost programs (JPKD®, 
APK©) to comprehensive packages (MwPharm©, TCIWorks, USC*PACK©), the panel of available 
tools is fairly variable. Each software tool must be regarded with respect to the individual needs of 
hospitals or clinicians. Major limitations to achieve this benchmark probably reside in the 
uniqueness associated with each of these programs. Depending on the intended users, specific TDM 
practice, whether it is to be used in clinical research or not, etc., a certain tool would better fit one 
institution than another. In this article, we followed a general and consensual strategy, and our grid 
focuses on all aspects that we considered, as clinical pharmacologists, as being required by an 
‘ideal’ TDM software tool for a large population of potential users. The weight assigned, by three 
different types of professionals (physicians, pharmacists, computer engineers), attempts to balance 
these aspects of the tools. This should, however, not prevent individual users from defining their 
own weighting factors (even 0) for Table 2.SII in the Online Resource and to obtain a global score 
that would better reflect their own needs. Our grid, used to rank the software, is a complete and 
detailed list describing characteristics of the programs assessed; however, it only focuses on dosage 
optimization in the context of TDM. Thus, it may possibly have missed some features that make 
each program unique. MwPharm© and TCIWorks were found to provide optimal characteristics for 
TDM but to represent sophisticated tools that offer detail beyond the traditional needs for drug 
adjustment. For simple adaptation based on one concentration, simpler tools such as JPKD® or 
APK© may be sufficient for many clinicians. TCIWorks is in an early stage of its development and 
looks promising. It has more flexibility and is more intuitive for users than most other programs 
presented in this review. Its developers aimed to implement target concentration intervention 

 
48 
Computer Tools 
(TCI) rather than TDM. TCI is an evolving concept that proposes targeting of a concentration 
associated with a desired effect rather than a traditional therapeutic range [39]. Moreover, future 
versions of TCIWorks should include the possibility to add a pharmacodynamic block to models. 
Although MM-USC*PACK© was not among the best ranked programs, it is used worldwide and is 
still often considered as a reference for precision and prediction (MwPharm© [40] or Abbottbase 
PKS [41] were previously compared to it). Moreover, in addition to the clinical interface for dosage 
adjustment, USC*PACK© offers a full modeling tool employing the NPAG algorithm. Customized 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models can be built up through a graphical approach by 
placing boxes on the screen and connecting them with arrows (USC*PACK BOXES). Additionally, 
USC*PACK© also offers programs for infectious disease and cardiology. Finally, new features are 
under development (interfacing, database search function, and drug and disease interactions). It is 
also worth noting that other types of tools than stand-alone TDM programs do exist. A good 
example is the ISBA ImmunoSuppressant Bayesian dose Adjustment) web portal from Limoges 
University Hospital in France (https://pharmaco.chu-limoges.fr/), which proposes TDM adaptation 
for ciclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and, coming soon, for aminoglycosides and 
glycopeptides, methotrexate and anticancer agents. When dosage adjustment for one of these drugs 
is desired, the user fills in a data entry sheet on the portal to give information about patient clinical 
evolution, the context of the request, drug intake and blood drug concentration. Adaptation is then 
proposed based on Bayesian estimation and validated by a pharmacologist. It is then sent to the 
applicant via an electronic standardized report, normally in 24 h. A similar portal exists for 
fluorouracil dosage optimization, called ODPM (Onco Drug Personalized Medicine), which has been 
developed by the Cancerology Institute of the West Paul Papin and University of Angers, France 
(http://www.odpm.fr/). Web portals could therefore represent an alternative to autonomous 
software despite their requirement of remote human third-party intervention. Bayesian dosing 
optimization is widely applied now, being considered the gold standard. For instance, the 

 
49 
Computer Tools 
pharmacokinetic Bayesian method is recommended in the ‘‘Australian Therapeutic Guidelines: 
Antibiotics’’ [42, 43] . The use of this approach allows computation of a priori dosage regimens 
based on the individual’s characteristics, the use of random time sampling, performance of clinical 
interpretation in non-steady-state situations, and more accurate predictions [44]. However, such 
complex mathematical calculations would not be possible without computer tools, and this is why 
all currently marketed TDM programs now integrate it. To date, the usefulness of TDM remains 
controversial, with studies showing positive, negative or no significant impact on patient outcomes 
[45]. Despite the heterogeneity of the data, TDM services have been used since the 1970s in clinical 
practice, after some early trials with lithium and digoxin in the 1960s [1, 45]. This has been 
encouraged by the introduction of computerization, especially in Europe (notably in The 
Netherlands [46] ), Australia [47] and the USA [48, 49]. Computer-assisted advice should indeed be 
part of a global multidisciplinary TDM strategy, as foreseen some decades ago [50]. Even though it 
was reported that unassisted clinicians tend to use suboptimal loading, maintenance and total 
doses than when computer support is available [5, 51], dosage optimization programs do not 
replace clinicians with pharmacokinetic skills. Physicians and other specialists involved in patient 
care should be aware of the potential of TDM and increasingly take advantage of these powerful 
computer tools. In the late 1990s, Bates emphasised the importance of educational approaches to 
change physicians’ opinions and interventions, in addition to the efficiency of computer tools [52]. 
Despite the growing availability of dosage adjustment tools, there is still room for improvement. 
Programs should ensure user friendliness through smart design and flexibility, enabling easy and 
quick use in routine activities, including by non-experienced users. Expected pharmacokinetic 
variability should be displayed, e.g. via visual representation of percentiles. More importantly, to be 
used in hospitals, the program should interface with other applications, in particular with 
laboratory information management systems, patient administrative databases and electronic 
medical records. Moreover, the ability to export data should enable further research. Accurate 

 
50 
Computer Tools 
Bayesian approaches should be routinely preferred for optimal dosing regimen prediction. 
Comprehensive but clear and pedagogical printed reports, customizable for institutions, should be 
produced. Support should ideally be provided both by the developers and by a community users 
group, with access to clinical and technical documentation. Finally, TDM applications should 
become easily portable to ubiquitous and user-friendly mobile devices, in order to be used directly 
at the point of care, at the patient’s bedside [53] or even by the patients themselves.  
II.1.5. Conclusion 
While the 12 presently available TDM programs reviewed here reveal an encouraging evolution, 
none of them yet fulfils all of the requirements of an ideal tool [8]. The major challenge currently is 
to develop programs with comprehensive clinical and research capabilities, while still showing 
simplicity, flexibility and user friendliness that would make these tools easy to run by all types of 
users.

Clinical vignette presentation 
Gentamicin Vignette (1) 
SL is a 15-year old girl (born July, 1997) with cystic fibrosis. She weights 49.5 kg and is 155 cm tall. 
Her serum creatinine is 0.6 mg/dl. She was started on gentamicin 500 mg IV every 24 hours 3 days 
ago. Her serum drug level measured just before the 4th dose is 0.27 mg/L and 34.9 mg/L 30 min after 
the infusion end.  
What is the posology recommendation given by the program after fitting these serum 
concentrations? 
What would be the Cmax and Cmin extrapolated for a dose of 400 mg every 24 hours after fitting 
these serum concentration, for a target peak concentration of 25 mg/l and a target trough 
concentration of 0.5 mg/l? 
Gentamicin Vignette (2) 
ZS is a newborn girl (gestational age of 37 weeks). She weights 2.27 kg and she is 40 cm tall. Her 
serum creatinine is 0.25 mg/dl. Because of suspicion of neonatal infection, she received 9 mg 
gentamicin at her birthday, synergistically with amoxicillin. 30 min and 11 hours after the infusion 
end, her serum drug levels are respectively 8 mg/L and 3 mg/L. 
What is the posology recommendation given by the program after fitting these serum concentrations 
measured after a first dose and not at steady state, for a target peak concentration of 6 mg/l and a 
target trough concentration of 1 mg/l? 
What would be the Cmax and Cmin extrapolated for a dose of 8 mg every 24 hours after fitting serum 
concentration? 
Digoxin Vignette 
VC is a 73-year old patient (born April, 1939) suffering from atrial fibrillation. He weights 92.7 kg and 
is 182 cm tall. His serum creatinine is 1.93 mg/dl. He is treated by digoxin 0.250 mg once a day for 
several months. At time of a routine control, 23h45 after his last dose, his serum drug level is 0.9 µg/l.  
What is the a priori posology recommendation from the programs (before fitting any concentration) 
for a target average concentration of 1 µg/l (Cmin = 0.8 µg/l and Cmax = 2 µg/l)? 
After fitting serum concentration, what is the extrapolated concentration if a dose of 0.125 mg every 
24 hours is imposed? 
Vancomycin Vignette 
PJ is a 57-year old patient (born July, 1955) with ruptured infra-aortic aneurysm and amputation of 
both legs. He weights 62.5 kg and he is 172 cm tall. His serum creatinine is 3 mg/dl. He was started 

 
65 
Computer Tools 
vancomycin IV 1000 mg every 24 hours for 3 doses. Afterward vancomycin was stopped. 35h45 
hours after the last administration, his serum drug level is 20.2 mg/l.  
When should the treatment be started again if the target residual concentration is 15 mg/l? 
What is the posology recommendation given by the programs after fitting this serum concentration? 
Tacrolimus Vignette 
BI is a 57-year old patient (born January, 1955) that had a kidney transplant 2 days ago. He weights 
82.2 kg and is 175 cm tall. He is receiving 6 mg of tacrolimus per 24 hours in continuous infusion. 
Treatment started 2 days ago at 1 pm. His albumin concentration is 36 g/l, his hematocrite is 31 % 
and his creatinine clearance is 1.93 mg/dl. The patient is also receiving diltiazem. Today, at noon, his 
serum drug level is 19.1 µg/l.  
What is the posology recommendation given by the programs, after fitting this serum concentration, 
for a target concentration of 10 µg/l? 
Phenytoin Vignette 
CA is a 10-year old girl (born May, 2002) suffering from emphysema. She weights 37.6 kg and is 140 
cm tall. Her albumin is 38 g/l, her hematocrite 34% and her creatinine is 0.4 mg/dl. She is receiving 
oral phenytoin for 7 days at a regimen of 150 mg every 12 hours. 12 hours after her last dose intake, 
her serum level is 34.7 mg/l. 
What is the posology recommendation given by the programs after fitting this serum concentration 
for a target concentration of 15 mg/l? 
What would be the extrapolated concentration Cmin for a dose of 125 mg every 12 hours after fitting 
serum concentration?

ABSTRACT 
EzeCHieL is a program that aims to support clinicians in the clinical interpretation of blood drug 
concentration measurements. It is designed to be an easy-to-use pharmacokinetic tool for 
experienced as well as inexperienced users to tailor drug dosing regimen to specific patient, either 
based or not on blood drug concentration measurements in the frame of therapeutic drug 
monitoring. With the program, the user is able (i) to assess the expectedness of an observed 
concentration in a patient compared to the population via percentiles (ii) to assess the suitability of 
the predicted concentration at a time of interest according to the therapeutic interval (iii) to 
provide dosing adjustment advice if appropriate. EzeCHieL provides population-based predictions 
and Bayesian forecasting for routine use. The realization of the program is still under development. 
It will be a fully integrated software, affording powerful calculation, interactive graphical display, 
interfacing capabilities with hospital information system compliant with HL7 language, a local 
patient and drug history database, a central database for data collection in the research framework, 
report generation and useful extra tools. The tool is almost accomplished. We present the current 
stage of development of EzeCHieL and expected coming features.

II.2.1. Introduction 
The aim of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) is to optimise dosing regimens for individual 
patients based on the determination of plasma drug levels, in order to ensure effective drug 
concentration exposure whilst avoiding toxicity. TDM has been recognised to be beneficial in the 
management of various medical conditions, and dosage individualization guided by plasma drug 
measurement is currently applied to a number of drugs [1-3]. Additionally, recent refinements of 
analytical techniques increase the availability of drug assays, therefore putting an increasing 
emphasis on the value of TDM. The number of drug measurements performed in medical 
laboratories is globally expanding. However, measuring drug concentrations without providing 
appropriate clinical interpretation of the results leads to poor benefit to the patient. 
TDM necessitates consistent concentration–effect relationships and is best suited for drugs with a 
narrow therapeutic index that demonstrate a high inter-individual variability. It requires a good 
understanding of the relationship between drug dosing regimens and resulting blood concentration 
profiles, namely pharmacokinetics (PK).  
While most TDM interventions still rely on an empirical approach in daily practice, during the last 
decades it greatly gained from the emergence of population PK. From reference population data, a 
population PK model for a drug can incorporate patients’ descriptors (for instance body weight, 
creatinine clearance, disease, etc) and be fitted to drug concentration values (making it possible to 
quantify the residual unexplained variability). Once well characterized, such a model can be used as 
a prior to build up a formal interpretation of a given patient’s concentration value, as it allows 
individual Bayesian parameter estimation, simulations, concentration predictions and ultimately 
dosing suggestions. Another advantage of this approach is the possibility to accommodate random 
concentration values, which can be then extrapolated at a specific time for comparison with the 
desired targets. Population-based interpretation and Bayesian forecasting rest on mathematical 
modeling and non-trivial calculations. Thus it requires appropriate computing facilities, which are 
however largely available nowadays.  

 
76 
Computer Tools 
A number of more or less sophisticated programs have been proposed during the past years to 
perform this task [4]. It appears however that there is still an important room for improvement in 
this type of software for routine use. Clinicians without special training in PK need a simple, user-
friendly and easily accessible informatics tool. Additionally, such a program should provide 
accurate Bayesian predictions, interfacing with information systems, data storage capabilities and 
automatic report generation [4]. Computer assisted TDM is gaining growing interest, in parallel 
with the expansion of drug measurements. 
Like other institutions, the University Hospital of Lausanne has faced the need of a computer tool to 
assist TDM intervention. In the early 1990s, Borradori et al. showed an association between high 
aminoglycoside exposure and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in preterm infants [5], stressing 
the importance of monitoring carefully the concentration exposure to these antibiotics. It led to the 
design of a small PC program locally available, that helped in the calculation of dosage adaptations 
for aminoglycoside antibiotics and vancomycin. The proposed program, written in Microsoft Visual 
Basic for DOS, implemented a classical two-points approach: it was able to compute individual 
values of clearance and distribution volume from peak and trough concentrations measured after 
first dosing or during a repeated doses regimen. These estimates served to determine the dose 
amounts and dosing intervals required to bring the steady-state peak and trough levels near preset 
target values considered as usually efficient and safe.  
Further initiatives have then been undertaken with regard to antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART 
substantially improves survival in patients infected with HIV. A relationship between plasma levels 
and efficacy/toxicity has been established for certain classes of antiretroviral drugs. Drug 
concentration measurement is recognised as providing useful information to guide therapy for 
these antiretroviral agents, known for a high pharmacokinetic variability, potential interactions and 
complexity of use in polytherapy. Trough concentrations (Ctrough) are traditionally preferred for 
interpretation, as target values have been proposed for them. However, in practice, blood samples 
are often drawn at various times due to modalities of treatment intake and medical visit schedules. 

 
77 
Computer Tools 
To overcome this issue, in the end of the 1990s, our institution undertook further initiatives to 
provide assistance in the interpretation of plasma levels. From in-house developed population 
models, percentiles curves covering the whole dosing interval were established to propose 
reference concentration values under standard dosage regimens at steady-state [6]. In the absence 
of better validated therapeutic intervals, this did help to at least evaluate the expectedness of an 
observed concentration under a given dosage regimen at any time between two dose intakes. This 
represents a rudimentary TDM referring to population PK [7]. It has been applied to a various 
number of antiretrovirals as well as to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). A more formal Bayesian 
approach has been developed for efavirenz using a simple nomogram, taking advantage from the 
fact that all inter-individual PK variability for this drug could be assigned to its relative 
bioavailability [8]. 
Further efforts have been made to improve the interpretation of randomly measured 
concentrations while ensuring accurate prediction of Ctrough using a Bayesian approach. For 
imatinib, the first commercialized TKI, a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method 
base on a population pharmacokinetic model was developed and implemented in Excel (Microsoft® 
Office 2007, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) [9]. Additionally to prediction, it was used 
with success to optimize dosages when necessary [10, 11]. 
In the spirit of the last decades of innovative improvements to develop TDM for new drugs and to 
support clinicians in TDM interpretations, our division is now at the initiative of the development of 
a new computer program, called EzeCHieL. The main goal of EzeCHieL is to support the medical 
community for the clinical interpretation of randomly measured drug concentrations, using 
population-based reference percentiles and Bayesian predictions. Moreover, this computer tool 
aims to suggest individualised dosing adjustments if necessary, and should straightforwardly 
accommodate any candidate drug. Such aspirations require an easily accessible, integrated and 
user-friendly tool implementing Bayesian MAP estimation that can be used by inexperienced as 
well as experienced users.  

 
78 
Computer Tools 
The objectives of this paper are to provide an outline of the desired tool and to present the 
pharmacological specifications required to succeed in the aforementioned tasks. We will then 
report on the state of progression of EzeCHieL development since the beginning of the project in 
2010. 
II.2.2. General conceptual approach 
EzeCHieL is designed to address three major questions which should be raised following drug 
concentration measurement, and which delineate the intellectual process behind therapeutic drug 
monitoring:  
 Is the patient’s concentration expected? To answer this question, EzeCHieL shall locate the 
patient’s concentration value within the percentiles of distribution of concentrations expected 
under the given dosage, which graphically summarize the variability in drug exposure among the 
population. EzeCHieL will compute population, individual a priori percentiles, from a given 
population pharmacokinetic model, using simulation algorithms. In addition, once one or several 
blood samples of a patient have been measured, the program will confront them to prior 
individual patient’s parameters and compute a posteriori percentiles deduced from Bayesian 
MAP estimation. The expectedness of a concentration can thus be evaluated at different levels: 
either compared to the population or to the patient him- or herself. Moreover, besides this 
empirical Bayesian approach, a full Bayesian approach should be made available, which 
incorporates not only reference population PK parameters (average values, covariates 
coefficients and variability) but also an estimation of their own uncertainty (standard errors and 
correlations between estimates).  
 Is the patient’s concentration suitable? To answer this question, EzeCHieL shall assess whether 
the patient’s concentration profile meets, at a time of interest, the targeted therapeutic value and 
interval. Based on a concentration measurement, Bayesian prediction allows to extrapolate the 
concentration at the time referred for defining target exposure (e.g. peak or trough time, or 
average concentration i.e. AUC). This extrapolation can then be compared to the target 

 
79 
Computer Tools 
concentration or interval. EzeCHieL should accommodate not only standard target ranges, but 
also values depending on a defined covariate or entered specifically for a given patient (e.g. 
minimum inhibitory concentration for anti-infective drugs) 
 How should the dosing regimen be adjusted? To answer this question, EzeCHieL will help the 
prescribed to choose the most appropriate dosing schedule to reach and to maintain the patient’s 
concentration profile within the targeted therapeutic range. EzeCHieL thus offers a reverse PK 
calculation algorithm that starts from concentrations to derive dosages, so to suggest an 
appropriate dosing schedule for the desired target. 
All the above mentioned capabilities should largely rely on data visualisation with generation of 
concentration curves and target ranges. Other desired aspects include an easy-to-use interface and 
a flexible architecture allowing evolutions. EzeChieL will be able to handle various types of 
pharmacokinetic models, so that it can include a large library of drugs, and the users can add their 
own drug models. Interfacing with laboratory and patient information systems is also a major 
aspect of the development. Generation of high quality reports enabling a clear rendering of the 
results is a must-have. Finally, pharmacokinetic data gathered during the daily practice of TDM 
should be saved and used to continuously increase our knowledge and refine our drugs model 
through further research. 
II.2.3. Software Development 
Platform supported and installation requirement 
EzeCHieL is designed to be a stand-alone cross-platform application that runs on any modern 
system (Windows, Mac and Linux, and soon on iOS and Android platforms). It is written in C++ 
using the Qt framework. The program is available in English or French and updates are easily 
downloaded on its the website (http://www.ezechiel.ch/).

User interfaces 
The program is intended to provide a user-friendly tool that uses a graphical user interface (GUI), 
menu-driven with docks and panels (figure 2.2.1). It offers a step by step wizard (figure 2.2.2) 
that facilitates navigation for inexperienced users. Control via the command line interface is also 
however possible. From the GUI, patients and physician are added into the suitable panel.  
To handle a TDM intervention, EzeCHieL starts by creating a concentration profile curve. The first 
step consists in indicating the drug of interest and the appropriate reference population. Then the 
user enters dosing regimen information, covariates (patient descriptors) for the chosen drug and 
measured drug concentration. The program will then calculate the patient’s PK parameters for the 
given drug through MAP Bayesian estimation and draw the corresponding PK curve. Further 
actions encompass the localisation of the patient within the population (percentiles display), the

comparison of extrapolated concentration with reference target, the provision of dosage 
adjustment suggestions, and the generation of an intervention report. Further features of the 
program and more details regarding these steps are given in the next paragraphs.

Modular architecture 
EzeCHieL architecture is designed to be very flexible. A concept of plugins which articulate around a 
central core has been chosen. These plugins implement various components such as PK model 
calculation, percentiles calculation, Bayesian derivation algorithms, reverse calculation for 
individualised dosage suggestion.  
Pharmacokinetic models and drug description 
In the software, a PK model is made up of a set of parameters either defined for integrated closed-
form PK equations in terms of clearance, volume of distribution, constant of absorption, etc. or in 
terms of microconstants used for the integration of differential equations. Inter-individual 
variability can be associated with each parameter. Correlation between parameters is also 
supported by the program. Parameters are then used to calculate the predicted concentration 
profile and to build up a curve. All type of PK models will be handled by EzeCHieL including: one- 
two- three- linear and non-linear compartment model with first or zero order absorption and 
double gamma absorption for extravascular and intravenous administrations. Further PK models 
could be implemented upon request to the developers.  
An extended markup language (XML) file is written for each drug and is associated with a type of 
aforementioned PK model. This XML file specifies the set of parameters for the drug and the 
population considered, along with both inter- and intra-patient variability stemming from the 
population analysis. In addition, it contains information on drug dosage forms available, resulting 
dosage steps considered reasonable, acceptable intervals of time, usual infusion time if appropriate, 
and drug concentration targets. The XML file also includes the full covariate model description. In 
case of missing data for a given patient, default values, corresponding to the mean value from the 
original population data, can be assigned. EzeCHieL will include a rich library of drugs but users will 
be able to implement their own drugs, either directly into a drug XML file template or using a 
dedicated drug model editor made available. The architecture of calculation is given in figure 2.2.3.

Population prediction and Bayesian individualization 
Individualization is based on the availability of a reference population PK model including 
assumptions of parameters’ distribution. Once a concentration measurement is available its clinical 
interpretation relies on Bayes’ theory. Several steps are outlined here for this interpretation: 
- typical patient 
From the prior knowledge of the distribution of PK model parameters in the general population of 
interest (i.e. the original population dataset previously mentioned), the average typical patient is 
represented (this patient usually corresponds to the reference values of covariates relevant for the 
model). The typical patient is thus representative of a patient whose characteristics affecting the 
drug kinetics (i.e. covariates) are not known. 
- a priori 
The prior knowledge of the distribution of PK model parameters now incorporates the knowledge 
of the patient’s covariates relevant for the model, in order to determine the patient’s a priori 
Figure 2.2.3. Layers architecture of prediction calculation and drugs descriptors 

 
84 
Computer Tools 
parameters (i.e. before any concentration is evaluated). The resulting predicted PK profile allows 
for example planning the initial dosing regimen. 
 
- a posteriori: Bayesian estimation 
Once one or several drug concentration measurements are available, individual PK parameters can 
be estimated by Bayesian calculations based on their maximum a posteriori probability (MAP). This 
approach combines the measured drug concentration(s) and the prior knowledge of the 
distribution of model parameters estimated in the population of interest. It searches for the best 
combination of parameters that can account for the concentration(s) observed in the given patient, 
weighted by the prior knowledge of their respective variability in the population. This approach can 
be applied with any number of drug concentration measurements. 
At each level, starting from the typical patient to the a posteriori analysis, the degree of uncertainty 
regarding the fate of drug concentrations is reduced for a given patient.  
Percentiles 
Around all the above PK model based predictions, percentiles of distribution can be generated, 
which describe the respective spread of their uncertainty. Thus, a typical patient exposure profile 
should be complemented with the variability observed in terms of concentration over time 
exposure in the whole population, which encompasses both explained and unexplained between-
patient variability, along with the within-patient or inter-occasion or residual variability. Individual 
a priori percentiles are based on the knowledge of covariates and do not incorporate anymore the 
population variability explained by the covariates. Individual a posteriori percentiles still reduce 
the role of unexplained between-patient variability, since the patient has now been characterized 
by individual monitoring. In case of a large number of concentration measurements, these 
individual a posteriori percentiles end up in containing only the residual variability. The former two 
percentiles can be used to compare the adequacy of a single individual random concentration with 
the population of reference [7, 12], while the latter one rather informs about the expectedness of a 
new concentration value for a given individual having already been sampled. Percentiles are 

 
85 
Computer Tools 
implemented in the program under two distinct methods of calculation, named “Monte Carlo” and 
“Taylor-inspired”. The Monte Carlo method is based on a large number of simulations of 
concentrations from random patients drawn from a probability distribution relying on both inter- 
and intra-individual variability. The Taylor method uses error propagation calculations via the first 
(and possibly via the second) order approximations of the Taylor series. Monte-Carlo tends to 
rebuild the true distribution of concentrations (when N is sufficiently large), while the Taylor-
inspired methods are less accurate but faster. Methods of percentiles calculation are also 
implemented as plugins in the program. 
Curve fitting and prediction engine 
A PK model for a given drug is originally defined by a system of differential equations. Solving the 
system of differential equations allows fitting a curve and so predicting a patient’s concentration 
over time. The curve to fit can be calculated either by the Runge Kutta integration method, using the 
original differential equations plus a set of initial conditions (at time t=0), or by the calculation of 
the analytical solution (closed-form equation) of the differential equation if it exists; this is typically 
not the case for non-linear kinetics, which make TDM of additional value for the corresponding 
drugs (e.g. phenytoin). Analytical solutions are preferable when they are available, for speed 
calculation considerations, but EzeCHieL offers both approaches. 
Drug dosing regimen calculation and targets 
Finally, from the individualized PK parameters, EzeCHieL will generate drug dosing suggestions to 
reach drug target concentration. It displays a certain number of acceptable dosing regimens that 
can achieve the desired PK target exposure. Nominal dose and time interval suggestions are 
constrained to satisfied only relevant combinations based on practical and galenic consideration 
entered in the drug’s XML file. The user can evaluate the choice on a chart that displays the result of 
the dosing suggestions. Relevant predicted concentration at steady-state are calculated and 
displayed. Population target values (and intervals) are handled, including with possible dependence 
on pharmacodynamic covariates, but the user can also define a patient’s own desired target. 

 
86 
Computer Tools 
Drug dosing, measure history 
The dosing regimen and concentration measurements values are displayed on the GUI. Drug dosing 
can easily be modified to fit all actions taken for a patient (missed dose, treatment, interruption, 
nominal dose and/or interval modification). A new drug concentration measurement can readily be 
added. Any covariates value modification can be simply handled via this panel as well.  
Covariates 
Covariate values are also displayed in a tab on the GUI. Similarly, they can easily be modified or 
added. EzeChieL aims at defining global covariates, i.e those most commonly encountered in PK 
models, that could thus be used in different drug model for a given patient (like body weight or 
glomerular filtration rate, etc). More specific covariates are requested according to the chosen drug. 
Regarding covariates derived from other parameters, the program will offer interactive calculations 
directly accessible for: creatinine clearance, body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), or 
different type of body weight (BW). 
Graphical display 
Drug concentration over time is displayed on dynamic graph from the fitted model. Changes in 
covariates or drug dosing (dose, interval) are clearly labelled. Multiples curves can be added, as 
well as percentiles. Targets are clearly depicted. Cursor can be moved along the patient curve, 
indicating the predicted concentration at any time. User can choose between linear and logarithmic 
scale. A colour code is set up for different elements. 
Report 
Reporting and saving results is of major importance. Comprehensive reports, customizable for a 
given institution or practitioner, can be generated to document TDM intervention. They shall 
include administrative information regarding patient, physician and user, laboratory data, dosing 
recommendations if appropriate, dosing regimen graphs, population and individual PK data, and 
free text that can be added by the user. As most of the data used in the reports is already stored in 

 
87 
Computer Tools 
the database and they can be retrieved to prefill many of a report's fields. Customization of the 
report as a shorter version is also possible, through the masking of selected segments. The report is 
implemented using a combination of HTML5 technology, CSS and Qt's webkit features. 
Database 
All clinical useful data need to be saved. Data such as patient data (personal information, some from 
medical records) and practitioner data are stored in a local SQLite database. Patient data are saved 
and current dosing adjustment can also be saved for a future dosage monitoring. It is also 
possible to interface EzeCHieL with the hospital information system (see below). 
For research purpose, EzeCHieL shall also transfer any collected data regarding drug concentration 
and useful PK information (essentially covariates) to be aggregated in a remote central database. 
Such sharing feature will be used to develop and continuously improve existing models. 
Data interoperability and confidentiality 
Seven International (HL7; http://www.hl7.org/), the standard language for electronic health data 
transfer and probably the most commonly encountered in the medical field, is supported by 
EzeCHieL trough the MirthTM Connect technology (Mirth Corp., Irvine, CA, USA). It enables data to 
be interfaced with hospital information system including laboratory systems and the patient 
electronic medical records. To satisfy privacy and security requirements, all data stored locally are 
encrypted, and data transferred will be digitally signed. Regarding data aggregated for research 
purpose, the following approaches will be combined: pseudonymization (by applying the multi-key 
searchable encryptation scheme to the identifiable patient’s information) and anonymization, using 
generalization technique.

Export functions 
Curves can be exported as points, with 
many exportation options to satisfy 
user’s preference (figure 2.2.4). Graphs 
can be exported as image or PDF 
documents, reports as PDF or ODT. 
Support 
First, a user manual is provided (free 
access on the program’s website) made 
up of a quick start guide to rapidly 
handling a TDM intervention. It is worth 
noting that EzeCHieL is probably 
intuitive enough to handle a TDM 
intervention without going through the user manual. The second part of the manual gives deeper 
information on all aspects of the program: calculation motor and equations, drugs library, model 
edition, validation of the program, interoperability, database, export, etc. A website and a user 
group are under realization. Finally, the long term support will be ensure via a system of start up, to 
continuously maintain and develop the program, and will offer to users an opportunity for contact 
and request.

Assessment of the predictive performance for concentration predictions 
To ensure that EzeCHieL is 
numerically 
accurate 
and 
precise 
in 
terms 
of 
concentration 
prediction, 
predictive performances [13] 
are evaluated and graphical 
inspections are performed. Bias 
(MPE: 
mean 
prediction 
error) and precision (RMSE: 
root mean squared error) are calculated by comparing EzeCHieL predicted drug concentrations 
against those predicted from the non-linear mixed effect modeling software (NONMEM®) 
considered as the reference method for population analysis and individual prediction, or against 
measured concentrations if existing.  
An automated tool in order to compare EzeCHieL predictions to the reference method, based on 
simulated data, as described figure 2.2.5, has been developed.  
Assessment of dosing regimen recommendation 
Further validation test need to be performed in real clinical setting to demonstrate the capacity of 
the program to suggest suitable dosing regimen recommendation. Predictive performances (bias 
and precision) will be assessed by predicted drug concentration against those observed after 
applying dosing recommendation for individualization.

Regulatory approval requirement 
Overall, a more general validation process will be performed to meet regulatory requirements for 
dissemination of such tool. It requires evaluating the testing methodology and the results. European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) define criteria to be met for 
medical devices [14, 15]. A registration dossier also represents one of the next stages of the project.  
II.2.6. Discussion 
EzeCHieL will offer a powerful resource to support clinicians in therapy individualization based on 
TDM. It will allow a priori and a posteriori Bayesian dosing adjustment, based on the knowledge of 
drug behaviour in the population of interest. This is a fully integrated tool dedicated to the optimal 
patients care (figure 2.2.6). Its main benefits, additionally to its numerical background, will reside 
in its intuitive user interface and its user-friendliness, mostly suited for non experienced users. The 
program affords also educational opportunities. Its modular implementation largely based on 
plugins make it very flexible, able to evolve and readily customizable for any institution. 
Alpha testing of EzeCHieL, i.e. an internal testing at the developers’ site, is currently ongoing. The 
release of a beta version is now expected in a short time. This means that the software will be 
released for a small group of targeted users, outside of the developer’s team, for further tests and 
validation  
The software will keep evolving from a user perspective. To ensure the continued existence and the 
development of the software and its wide use in the future, issues should be fixed and the tool 
should be able to be modified and improved; addition of novel functionalities should be allowed as 
well. Support of the software will gently slide towards a semi-private business. Our aim is to set up 
a flexible structure in order to collect resources for promoting efficiency, development and 
ensuring financial support, to maintain and disseminate it.  
In the future, EzeCHieL will be able to embark into a point-of-care system for bioanalysis of drugs in 
blood, currently under development [16]. It will also provide the medical doctor with information

which in turns could be directly sent back to the patient. 
In a World more and more connected and miniaturized, development of an embedded light version 
of EzeCHieL is also underway, to be used at anytime and anywhere either by the medical doctor or 
by the patient itself. It could be then synchronised with the standard version of EzeCHieL.

Population Pharmacokinetics 
Chapter III in the thesis context 
Implementation of a Bayesian approach for TDM requires provision of appropriate PK models. The 
general concept to support this development is the non-linear mixed effects modeling. Because some 
subpopulation may present specific characteristics in terms of drug disposition, specific models are 
needed such as for neonates. This chapter handles these two aspects for candidate drugs.  
Sepsis continues to be one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in newborns admitted in a 
neonatal intensive care unit. 
Gentamicin remains one of the most frequently administered antibacterial drugs in the neonates for 
proven or suspected neonatal infection. A TDM of this drug has been advocated for a long time now 
as a consequence of a large PK variability as well as well-defined concentration-efficacy and toxicity 
relationships. The collection of PK and clinical data in a large cohort of premature and term 
neonates allowed conducting a population PK study of gentamicin, which represents, to the best of 
our knowledge, the largest study ever done in such population. This study aimed to identify 
important predictors of drug exposure. Concretely, the study permitted to reassess the necessity of 
a systematic drug monitoring in the light of shorter treatment duration. Our simulations supported 
current a priori dosage recommendations. Our results were incorporated in EzeCHieL for the 
development of Bayesian TDM for this drug.  
This model was used to re-evaluate the potential association of gentamicin exposure with 
sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Under the supervision of Dr E. Giannoni, that initiates this work, 
Lara Zimmerman collected and analyzed all demographic, clinical and therapeutic data (including 
aminoglycoside treatment course) to conduct a case-control study. A brief overview of our 
contribution in this work is given after the model description.  
In contrast, imipenem is administered in complex and critical situations, often in very premature 
neonates. Our institution offers a TDM for this drug. Standard recommended dosage seems leading 

 
102 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
to sub-therapeutic exposure in many of those patients in this subpopulation. Only one population 
PK study has been published in neonates so far (Yoshizawa et al. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2013). This 
study has the advantage to present blood and urinary data, but with only a limited number of 
covariates of importance retained for such population (body weight, age). Once again, this study 
aimed to identify important predictors of drug exposure, and to quantify their impact. Simulation 
will provide dosage recommendation that should further be validated in a real clinic care setting. 
Our result will be incorporated in EzeCHieL.

Population Pharmacokinetics 
ABSTRACT 
Aim: This study aims to investigate the clinical and demographic factors influencing gentamicin 
pharmacokinetics in a large cohort of unselected premature and term newborns and to evaluate 
optimal regimens in this population. 
Method: All gentamicin concentration data, along with clinical and demographic characteristics, 
were retrieved from medical charts in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit over 5 years within the frame 
of a routine therapeutic drug monitoring programme. Data were described using non-linear mixed-
effects regression analysis (NONMEM®). 
Results: A total of 3039 gentamicin concentrations collected in 994 preterm and 455 term 
newborns were included in the analysis. A two compartment model best characterized gentamicin 
disposition. The average parameter estimates, for a median body weight of 2170 g, were clearance 
(CL) 0.089 l h−1 (CV 28%), central volume of distribution (Vc) 0.908 l (CV 18%), 
intercompartmental clearance (Q) 0.157 l h−1 and peripheral volume of distribution (Vp) 0.560 l. 
Body weight, gestational age and post-natal age positively influenced CL. Dopamine co-
administration had a significant negative effect on CL, whereas the influence of indomethacin and 
furosemide was not significant. Both body weight and gestational age significantly influenced Vc. 
Model-based simulations confirmed that, compared with term neonates, preterm infants need 
higher doses, superior to 4mg kg−1, at extended intervals to achieve adequate concentrations. 
Conclusion: This observational study conducted in a large cohort of newborns confirms the 
importance of body weight and gestational age for dosage adjustment. The model will serve to set 
up dosing recommendations and elaborate a Bayesian tool for dosage individualization based on 
concentration monitoring.

Population Pharmacokinetics 
III.1.1. Introduction 
The use of aminoglycosides is limited by their potential ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, consequent 
to drug accumulation in the inner ear and kidney [1-5]. Despite their toxicity, aminoglycosides are 
widely used in clinical practice. In recent guidelines, gentamicin remains the first line of treatment 
for suspected early-onset neonatal sepsis [6, 7]. Pharmacodynamic investigations have shown a 
concentration-dependent activity, mainly related to the ratio of peak plasma concentration over 
minimum inhibitory concentration (Cmax : MIC), which should exceed 8 to 10 for optimal efficacy 
[8]. Gentamicin is essentially eliminated by renal excretion through glomerular filtration and binds 
to only a limited extent to plasma proteins (between 0–15% [9, 10], and up to 30% according to 
some authors [11]). The majority of nephrons are formed in the third trimester of pregnancy and 
nephrogenesis is complete between 32 to 36 weeks of gestation [12, 13]. In the last decade, 
preterm births (below 37 weeks of gestation) have constituted about 10% of total births worldwide 
[12] and the survival rates of these extremely preterm infants have particularly increased. Infants 
born at 25 weeks of gestation now have up to 80% chance of survival [14]. In this subpopulation, 
the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is quite low at birth, but this is also typical in term newborns. 
During the first weeks of life, there is a progressive rise in GFR resulting from an acute increase in 
cardiac output and renal blood flow induced by birth and a decrease in renal vascular resistance 
[15]. Thus, renal elimination of gentamicin in neonates is largely linked to both gestational age and 
post-natal (PNA) age. It is worth noting that, as creatinine crosses the placental barrier, blood 
creatinine concentrations are not a reliable indicator of renal function in the first days of life as they 
reflects maternal rather than neonate concentrations [13]. Gentamicin is a polar molecule and is 
distributed predominantly in extracellular fluid, which varies inversely with gestational age [16, 
17]. The large amount of extracellular body water in neonates and young infants results in lower 
plasma concentrations compared with adults for a given body weight-adjusted dosage regimen 
[18]. Therefore, because of age-associated changes in organ function and body composition, 

 
106 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
gentamicin treatment regimens must be individualized appropriately to reflect maturation 
(increase in age) and growth (increase in size). Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), involving a 
close monitoring of the exposure of drug plasma concentrations so as to prevent toxicity and lack of 
efficacy, is the standard of care to optimize the dosage of aminoglycosides. A Bayesian forecasting 
approach for estimation of individual pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters currently represents the 
gold-standard approach for TDM [19]. It is becoming increasingly advocated for treatment 
individualization in neonates [20, 21]. The purpose of this study was to characterize the population 
PK parameters of gentamicin in a large cohort of preterm and term neonates and to investigate the 
influence of clinical, physiological and environmental factors on the disposition of the drug. The 
second objective was to evaluate the achievement of target concentrations according to dosage 
regimen recommendations based on simulations. These recommendations will retrospectively be 
compared with a dosing regimen based on a two point adjustment approach performed routinely in 
our hospital within the framework of TDM. The results should ultimately serve to build up 
gentamicin Bayesian-inspired TDM tools for dosage individualization in patients who need 
monitoring [22]. 
III.1.2. Method 
Study population 
All neonates admitted in the Service of Neonatology of the Lausanne University Hospital between 
December 2006 and October 2011 and receiving gentamicin were eligible for the study. This 
retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Lausanne University 
Hospital. Initially, 3168 gentamicin concentration measurements collected from 1500 subjects, 
were retrieved using the clinical information system (MetaVision, iMDsoft, Massachussetts, USA) 
and the routine TDM database. Of these, 129 samples were excluded from analysis for the following 
reasons: missing information on drug administration or sampling times, inconsistencies in dosing 
interval or administered dose or unclear dosing schedules. The following characteristics were 

 
107 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
systematically collected: gender, body weight (BW) at the time of blood sampling, gestational age 
(GA), PNA, concomitant treatment with furosemide, dopamine and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (ibuprofen and indomethacin), presence of a patent ductus arterious (PDA) and concomitant 
respiratory support with invasive or non-invasive ventilation. 
Drug administration and serum concentrations 
Gentamicin (Garamycin®, Hexal, Holzkirchen, Germany) was administered intravenously over a 30 
min infusion, most of the time in association with amoxicillin. The conventional initial dose was 
3mg kg−1 from December 2006 until April 2011, followed by 4mg kg−1 from May 2011 to October 
2011 according to a change in local guidelines. Within the framework of a routine TDM programme 
in our hospital, plasma drug concentrations were drawn twice, 1 h and 12 h after the first 
gentamicin dose, in order to individualize the dosage regimen based on a classical two point 
approach linear regression [23]. Further concentration measurements could be requested by the 
physician if the treatment was prolonged. 
Analytical assay 
Serum concentrations were determined by fluorescent polarization immunoassay (Cobas Integra 
400 Plus, Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Lower limits of detection and quantification 
were, respectively, 0.04 and 0.5 mg l−1. Coefficients of variation (CV) for imprecision were ≤2.5% at 
0.9 and 7.8 mg l−1 within run and ≤3.1% at 1.5, 4.4 and 7.0 mg l−1 between runs. 
Model-based pharmacokinetic analysis 
Base model: The population PK analysis was performed using a non-linear mixed-effect modelling 
approach with NONMEM® (version 7.1.0, ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA), 
using first order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI). A stepwise procedure was used to 
identify the model that best fitted the data comparing one and two compartment open models. 
Exponential errors were used for the description of the between subject variability (BSV) of PK 

 
108 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
parameters. Proportional, additive and mixed error models were compared which describe the 
residual variability.  
Covariate model: At first, the graphical exploration of continuous covariates (BW, GA, PNA, 
postmenstrual age (PMA) defined as the sum of PNA and GA) and categorical covariates (gender, 
co-treatment with furosemide, dopamine and indomethacin, PDA, invasive and non-invasive 
ventilation) effects were carried out to visualize the relationship between the PK parameters and 
the covariates. Potentially influencing covariates were then included in the model following a 
sequential forward selection and backward elimination. Ibuprofen and vancomycin, which can 
affect renal function, were not administered in this population and their influence could thus not be 
investigated. The influence of body weight on gentamicin PK parameters was used as a first 
covariate characterized using allometric scaling [24].

Population Pharmacokinetics 
Since PMA represents the sum of GA and PNA, PNA or GA were not considered if PMA was already 
included in the model and vice versa. 
Parameter estimation and model selection:  Difference in objective function value (ΔOF), 
NONMEM® goodness-of-fit statistics, along with diagnostic goodness-of-fit plots, were used for 
model comparison. Since ΔOF between any two hierarchical models approximates a χ2 distribution, 
it was considered statistically significant if it exceeded 3.8 (P < 0.05) and 6.6 (P < 0.01) points 
respectively, for one additional parameter during model building and backward deletion 
procedures. Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) was used for non-hierarchical models. Shrinkage 
was also examined. When more than one covariate describing the same effect (GA, PNA and PMA) 
was found significant, the covariate causing the largest drop in objective function was preferred. A 
sensitivity analysis was performed for patients with absolute values for conditional weighted 
residuals (CWRES) greater than 5 to test for potential bias in parameter estimation and in covariate 
exploration. It concerned eight data points for six patients. Four observations were excluded for 
suspected error in administered dose, one observation for suspected error in time recording and 
one observation for suspected sampling bias. No obvious reason could plain high CWRES (6.3 and 
5.8) associated with the two remaining observations and they were thus kept in the analysis. The 
sensitivity analysis showed that none of these concentration values affected the PK estimates (data 
not shown). Parameters estimates, when scaled on BW, are reported for the median BW, i.e. 2170 g.  
Model validation and simulation: The final model stability was assessed by the bootstrap method 
using the PsNToolkit [25] (version 3.5.3, Uppsala, Sweden). Mean parameter values with their 95% 
confidence interval (95% CI) estimated from 2000 re-sampled data sets were compared with the 
original model estimations. In addition, prediction-corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPC) [26] 
were performed with PsN-Toolkit and Xpose4 [27] (version 4.3.5, Uppsala, Sweden) by simulations 
based on the final PK estimates using 1000 individuals. Mean prediction corrected concentrations 

 
110 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
with their 95% percentile interval (95% PI) at each time point were retrieved. Eventually, an 
independent set of 71 premature and term newborns recruited through TDM between January 
2013 and April 2013 was employed for external model validation. From this external dataset, two 
individuals were excluded for an inconsistent dosing record. Population and individual post hoc 
concentrations were derived from the final model to assess the accuracy and the precision by 
means of the mean prediction error (MPE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) [28], using log-
transformed concentrations. Goodness-of-fit plots of population and individual predictions 
obtained in the final model vs. the observations were generated using R (version 2.15.1, R 
Development Core Team, Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Finally, observed 
and simulated concentrations were also compared by the normalized prediction distribution error 
(NPDE) method where each observation was simulated 3000 times (supporting information Figure 
3.SI). Average concentration−time profiles, with their 90% prediction interval (90% PI), were 
simulated for five representative patients (with a GA of 26, 30, 34, 37 and 40 weeks and a BW of 
890, 1080, 2120, 2950 and 3580 g respectively, chosen as illustrative from the original dataset) 
using different dosage regimens, without dopamine co-administration. Dosage regimens evaluated 
were any combination of 4mg kg−1, 4.5 mg kg−1 or 5mg kg−1 any 24 h, 36 h or 48 h. 
Comparison of dosage adjustment methods 
The achievement of target concentrations was evaluated by comparing (i) dosing regimen 
recommendations based on the previously presented simulations and (ii) by TDM using the 
classical linear regression [23]. The external validation dataset was used for the comparison 
between both approaches. Peak and trough concentrations were predicted based on our final 
model (i) with dosing regimens adjusted for GA and BW according to our recommendations and (ii) 
based on individual dosage regimens derived from the linear regression method in the frame of 
TDM. Each set of patients was simulated 1000 times per method. For each set of patients simulated,

the proportion of subjects meeting concentration targets at steady-state was retrieved. The mean 
with the 95% CI of the proportions were calculated. 
III.1.3. Results 
Gentamicin concentration data were collected from 1449 neonates, including 994 preterm (median 
gestational age 32 2/7 weeks, range 24 2/7–36 5/7 weeks) and 455 term newborns, representing a 
total of 1449 neonates who provided 3039 concentration measurements. A summary of the 
patients’ characteristics for the model building and validation datasets is presented in Table 3.1.1. 
Peak concentrations represented 42% of samples (measured between 0.5 and 1.5 h after the start 
of infusion), while 40% were sampled about 12 h after the first dose (between 11.5 and 12.5 h after 
the start of infusion). Most drug measurements (86%) were performed after the first gentamicin 
dose and only 3% of concentrations were sampled beyond 72 h of treatment. The majority of the 
measurements (98%) were performed within the first week of life. Gentamicin concentration 
measurements ranged between 0.5 and 22.1 mg l−1 (one subject had a concentration of 29 mg l−1 
because he received accidentally 10 times the usual prescribed dose).

Base model 
A two compartment model parameterized in terms of clearance (CL), inter-compartmental CL (Q), 
volume of distribution of the central compartment (Vc) and peripheral volume of distribution (Vp) 
best described the data (ΔOF from the one compartment model was −280.0, P < 0.001). In addition 
to CL, an improvement of the fit was observed while including BSV on Vc (ΔOF = −252.8, P < 0.001) 
and a correlation of 87% was estimated between CL and Vc (ΔOF = −186.8, P < 0.001). Intrapatient 
variability was best described by a combined additive and proportional residual error model. The 
final base population parameters with their BSV were a CL of 0.087 l h−1 (CV 65%), a Vc of 0.825 l 
(CV 45%), a Q of 0.185 l h−1 and a Vp of 0.714 l. Additive and proportional residual error were 0.89 
mg l−1 and 18%, respectively. 
Covariate model 
Figure 3.1.1 summarizes the model-building steps performed for the covariate analysis. The 
assignment of BW on CL, Vc, Q and Vp, following an allometric equation with a power of 0.75 on CL 
and Q and 1 on the volume parameters, markedly improved the description of the data (ΔOF = 
−3391.5, P < 0.001). The comparison of a one compartment allometric with a two compartment 
allometric model for BW showed that the latter provided a better fit of the data (supporting 
information Table 3.SI). The use of a power function of 0.66 for BW on CL parameters was also 
investigated [29] but was significantly worse than the model with a power of 0.75 (ΔOF = 99.8, P < 
0.001). Estimates of CL and Q increased by 68% whilst Vc and Vp on BW doubling increased by 100 
%. This explained 45% of the intervariability in CL and 55% in Vc. Owing to the very large effect of 
BW on these parameters, this variable was kept in the model for further covariates searches. The 
sequential addition of GA, PNA and PMA using a linear function on CL and Vc resulted in a better 
description of the data. PMA was the most important covariate on CL (ΔOF = −658.1, P < 0.001) and 
on Vc (ΔOF = −214.6, P < 0.001). Since PMA is the sum of GA and PNA, we searched which 
combination of these latter variables provided the best description of the data. Comparing PMA 

 
113 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
with GA + PNA on CL showed a significant drop in the OF value (ΔOF = −750.8 P < 0.001) in favour 
of the model with the two distinct covariates GA and PNA. PMA was slightly more significant than 
GA on Vc (ΔOF = −206.1 for PMA compared with ΔOF = −201.8 for GA, P < 0.001 with the AIC 
difference between the two models 4.3 points in favour of PMA). However, PNA did not show any 
influence on Vc in the univariate analysis 
(ΔOF = −1.9, P = 0.16). Following the 
parsimony principle, GA alone was preferred 
to PMA as a covariate on Vc. Eventually, PMA 
was also retested in the final model in 
replacement of GA, confirming that it was not 
a better predictor than GA (ΔOF = 0.14, P = 
0.70, and AIC was 1964 for both models). CL 
was reduced by 12% and 18% by co-
administration of dopamine (ΔOF = −11.3, P < 
0.001) and indomethacin (ΔOF = −7.8, P = 
0.005), respectively. Although not statistically 
significant, 
furosemide 
co-administration 
reduced CL by 34% (ΔOF=−6.3, P = 0.012). No 
other covariates showed any significant effect 
on gentamicin disposition (ΔOF > −6.1, P > 
0.01).  
Model validation and simulation 
The parameter estimates of the final population PK model, except for indomethacin, remained 
within the bootstrap 95% CI and differed by less than 9% from the median parameters obtained 
with the bootstrap analysis, suggesting that the model was acceptable. Since the indomethacin

Population Pharmacokinetics 
coefficient 95% CI included 0, it was omitted from the final model. It appeared that it did not affect 
the model as the relative difference in parameter estimates between the model with and without 
indomethacin was less than 3% (data not shown). The structural and the final model parameter 
estimates as well as the bootstrap are presented in Table 3.1.2. The results of pcVPC supported the 
predictive performance of the model and are presented in Figure 3.1.2. Goodness-of-fit plots are 
presented in Figure 3.1.3. The external validation showed a small bias of −3% (95% CI −1, −4%) in 
the individual predictions, with an imprecision of 12% (supporting information Figure 3.SII). A 
similar bias of −6% (95% CI −3, −9%) was calculated for population predictions, with an 
imprecision of 22%. Only one patient received dopamine among the newborns of the validation 
dataset. Average concentration−time profiles for the different GAs and dosing schedules are 
presented in Figure 3.1.4. These results 
confirm that higher doses and longer dosage 
intervals 
are 
needed 
in 
very 
preterm 
newborns compared with term infants to reach 
target concentrations (Cmin ≤ 1mg l−1 and 
Cmax ≈ 8mg l−1). The dosing recommendations 
that came forth from these simulations were 
identical to those proposed by reference drug 
guidelines used in neonatology, namely 5mg 
kg−1 every 48 h for GA ≤ 29 weeks, 4.5 mg kg−1 
every 36 h for 30 ≤ GA ≤ 34 and 4mg kg−1 every 
24 h in the first days of life [30].

Table 3.1.3 presents the proportion of subjects reaching target trough and peak concentrations at 
steady state, according to both methods (i.e. the guidelines and the two point linear regression). 
One subject was excluded because the C12h concentration was missing and the dosage adjustment 
using the two points approach could not be performed. A broader range of target concentrations 
was also considered in this comparison to account for different thresholds proposed in the

III.1.4. Discussion 
To our knowledge, this is the largest study evaluating the population PK of gentamicin in a cohort of 
unselected neonates covering a wide range of body weight and gestational age. The PK of 
gentamicin has been previously described using one [33-46] two [47-50] and three [51, 52] 
exponential disposition terms, which probably illustrate the deep compartments and tissue 
accumulation of gentamicin. Our PK estimates of CL and Vc are in good accordance with previously 
published studies in a similar population [34, 35, 37, 38, 43, 46]. The half-life of the terminal phase 
was estimated to be 12.5 h, much lower than the values derived by others based on three 
compartment models (87 to 173 h [48], 27 to 693 h [49], 94 h [51] in adults and 425 h [52] in 
neonates). This discrepancy is most probably related to differences in study design, with short 
treatment courses and lack of gentamicin concentration measurements beyond 72 h, preventing 
adequate characterization of the slowest distribution component of the drug in peripheral tissues 
and thus, of a third exponential term. Description of gentamicin PK confirmed that the primary 
factors influencing newborns’ exposure are size and age (BW, GA and PNA) [53]. Gentamicin is a 
hydrophilic drug that is rapidly and predominantly distributed into extracellular fluid. Extracellular 
fluid represents approximately 65% of BW at 35 weeks of gestation and falls to 40% at term [16]. 
At the same time, fat mass and intracellular water increase. Decrease in body water also continues 
after birth and extracellular fluid becomes closely related to BW [54], supporting our observations 
of an effect of body weight on Vc. Gentamicin CL increases with age. Because renal maturation 
progresses before birth [18], it was advocated that PMA would be a better predictor than PNA [53, 
55, 56]. In the present study, PMA was found to be a good predictor of gentamicin CL, but the use of 
GA and PNA described gentamicin disposition better than PMA alone. Our results are in excellent 
agreement with the study of Nielsen et al. [52], who found an influence of both GA and PNA on CL 
and GA on Vc. Dopamine was found to be a relevant factor associated with a 12% decrease in CL. 
The impact of dopamine on GFR in neonates is not well documented [57-59] and, has never been 
observed for gentamicin in others studies. Only a few patients were treated with dopamine (9%). 
Its influence on gentamicin elimination appears small and of limited clinical significance in this

analysis. It might principally reflect cardiovascular instability in critically ill newborns. Several 
studies have shown the potential effect of ibuprofen and indomethacin on glomerular filtration 
reflected by a reduction of renal excretion of drugs such as aminoglycosides [15, 42, 60-62]. Our 
results also suggest an influence of indomethacin on gentamicin CL, although this effect was not 
validated. The small number of patients (n = 27) might have limited the power to detect true effect. 
It is also possible that confounding factors were reflected this way, since those newborns had a very 
low body weight, (mean 852 g, range 440–1390 g), as well as haemodynamically significant PDA, 
which is associated with poor renal perfusion [63]. Even so, PDA had no significant impact on CL 
per se in this analysis. Furosemide was not found to significantly reduce gentamicin CL, as opposed 
to one study which suggested an increase in gentamicin concentrations as a result of furosemide co-
administration [64]. Only five patients received it, four of whom were on concomitant dopamine 
treatment. This might have limited the possibility to detect an independent effect of furosemide. In 
addition, some studies found a relation between respiratory disorders or invasive and non-invasive 
ventilation with gentamicin CL or V [34, 65, 66]. No influence of respiratory support on gentamicin 
kinetics was observed in our study. Several limitations of this analysis should be acknowledged, in 
particular the use of routine TDM data involving for the most part only two concentration 
measurements collected after the first dose, thus limiting the possibility to characterize deep 
compartment kinetics. In addition, due to the retrospective design, errors coming from inaccurate 
times or dosage recording could not be systematically traced and corrected. Model-based 
simulations suggest that most infants born at a GA above 34 weeks are expected to reach target 
concentrations (peak above 8mg l−1 and Cmin below 1mg l−1 [67, 68]) with a standard dosage of 
4mg kg−1 once daily. Preterm neonates require longer dosing intervals, up to 48 h and extremely 
preterm neonates (below 28 weeks of GA) will also require higher doses of 5mg kg−1. These 
observations are in accordance with dosing recommendations issued since the mid-1990s [30, 69] 
that advocate high doses and extended intervals to reach sufficient peak concentrations whilst 
minimizing toxicity. Proposed dosing regimens were designed assuming fixed values of 
concentration thresholds for effect and toxicity, in accordance with numerous studies

demonstrating the importance of a high ratio Cmax: MIC for aminoglycosides. One study suggested 
that the area under the curve (AUC) might be of clinical importance for extreme preterm newborns 
[70]. Target concentrations can also be challenged, as adaptive resistance can arise within the first 
hours of therapy, probably through a down regulation of the active transport of gentamicin into the 
bacteria. The use of extended interval dosing seems thus preferable to improve clinical efficacy, as it 
allows adaptive resistance to resolve while taking advantage of the post-antibiotic effect [31, 70, 
71]. Considering that a priori dosage regimen recommendations [30] appear appropriate to ensure 
effective and safe concentration exposure, and that most gentamicin treatments will be stopped 
after 48 h, TDM has a limited role at treatment initiation in this population. However, the use of 
TDM to optimize target achievement will still be needed for some patients, since a large variability 
in drug exposure remains after adjustment for age and body weight, and a proportion of patients 
will still fail to reach adequate PK targets. This should be particularly considered for those patients 
receiving prolonged treatment. In conclusion gentamicin kinetics in newborns are very variable and 
mostly dependent on growth status (represented by BW) and maturation (represented by GA and 
PNA). The influence of comedications, such as dopamine, as direct or indirect factors influencing 
renal function should be confirmed. Recent dosing recommendations showed a benefit in terms of 
target concentration achievement and reduction of TDM need at treatment initiation. Our model 
will serve to elaborate a Bayesian tool for dosage individualization based on a single measurement 
[72], that could be ideally suited for dosage individualization of neonates at particular risk of sub-
optimal dosing during prolonged therapy.

Population Pharmacokinetics 
III.2.1. Objective 
The association between gentamicin treatment and development of sensorineural hearing loss 
(SNHL) is controversial in newborns. Early studies have found an association between 
aminoglycoside treatment and SNHL in newborn infants [1, 2]. However, since the early 1990s, a 
number of studies have suggested that gentamicin administered in controlled therapeutic doses is 
not associated with ototoxicity in newborn infants [3-9]. Gentamicin is still a first-line treatment for 
infection suspicion: for instance, about 3000 newborns received it between 2000 and 2010 in the 
service of neonatology of Lausanne. A systematic Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) was 
performed after first dose administration. Safety use appears as a public health issue. Our main 
contribution was to evaluate the role of gentamicin exposure in SNHL in preterm neonates. 
III.2.2. Method 
Infants that presented a SNHL during the first 5 years of life, born between 1993 and 2010 at a 
gestational age < 32 weeks and/or with a birth weight < 1500g and hospitalized at Lausanne 
University Hospital during their neonatal period were identified. For each case, two controls 
matched for gender, gestational age, birth weight, and date of birth were retrieved. 
Gentamicin administration and TDM measurements were recovered from medical records. 
Different parameters reflecting gentamicin exposure were determined. Cumulative dose, 
cumulative dose per kg were then calculated. Based on the previously described population 
pharmacokinetic (PK) model, gentamicin individual PK parameters were retrieved by maximum a 
posteriori Bayesian estimation. Calculated parameters were: cumulative area under the curve 
(AUC), maximum predicted trough concentration (Ctrough) during treatment, clearance per kg with:  
AUC =                   
Additionally, weighted AUC for a saturable accumulation in the inner ear was also calculated, 
according to Michaelis constant (KM) defined as 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/l, as follow: 

 
133 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
AUCear =  
                
                    
Possible contribution of gentamicin exposure 
was analysed by logistic regression. Odds ratio 
and p-value were generated based on the z score.  
III.2.3. Results 
Twenty-five infants diagnosed with a SNHL were 
identified for the period of search. The 
proportion of patient treated with gentamicin 
was 76% in the study group and 70% in the 
control group. Patients’ characteristics are 
shown in table 3.2.1. Individual concentrations 
predicted by the population PK model were 
consistent with observations as shown in figure 
3.2.1.

Cumulative doses and individual pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Table 3.2.2, and a 
visual comparison per group is proposed in figure 3.2.2.  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The univariate analysis did not show any significant difference between two groups, neither in 
cumulative dose nor in the derived PK parameters.  Finally, effect of a saturable accumulation in the 
inner ear at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l (AUC0.5), 1 mg/l (AUC1) and 2 mg/l (AUC2) did not show any 
difference between the two groups. Statistics are presented in table 3.2.2.

One may notice two higher cumulative doses in the control group due to two patients that received 
a second subsequent treatment of gentamicin. Analysis was also performed ignoring these two 
individuals to assess if they could have influenced our results. Again, no statistical difference was 
observed between the two groups (data not shown). Consequently, no further analyses were 
undertaken. 
III.2.4. Conclusion 
While multiple risk factors have been identified in SNHL [10-18], the association with gentamicin 
exposure was not confirmed in our study.

Population Pharmacokinetics 
ABSTRACT 
Imipenem is administered to critically ill neonates with severe infections after failure of first lines 
antibiotic treatments. The objectives of our study was to evaluate imipenem pharmacokinetic (PK) 
in a cohort of neonates treated in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of the Lausanne University 
Hospital in order to characterize the relationship between imipenem disposition and patients’ 
characteristics. PK data were analyzed using non linear mixed-effect modeling. Infants who had at 
least one imipenem concentration measurement between 2002 and 2013 were retrieved. A total of 
144 plasma samples from 68 neonates was collected. Infants were predominantly preterm 
newborns, with a median gestational age of 27 weeks (range: 24 – 41 weeks) and a median 
postnatal age of 21 days (range: 2 – 153 days). A two-compartment model best characterized 
imipenem disposition Population PK parameters estimates for clearance, central volume of 
distribution, intercompartmental clearance, peripheral volume of distribution were 0.27 L/h/kg0.75, 
0.57 L/h, 0.05 L/h/kg0.75, 0.18 L/h. Actual body weight exhibited the greatest impact on PK 
parameters, followed by age (gestational age and postnatal age) and serum creatinine on clearance. 
It explains 19%, 9%, 14% and 9% of the interindividual variability in clearance respectively. The 
elimination half-life was estimated to 3.3 hours for a typical patient.  
Imipenem is characterized by an important variability, and dosage adjustment according to body 
weight and age is recommended in premature and septic neonates. Further work will assess 
adequate imipenem dosing regimen for this population.

Population Pharmacokinetics 
III.3.1. Introduction 
Imipenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibiotic, active against a wide range of Gram-positive, 
Gram negative and anaerobic organisms. Carbapenems are used in severe and complicated 
bacterial infections that are encountered in neonatal intensive care units [1-4]. The drug is 
distributed into tissues compartment [1, 5] and protein binding is only about 20%. [6, 7]. Imipenem 
is mostly eliminated by renal pathway, essentially by glomerular filtration and to some extent by 
tubular secretion. About 25% of a dose is eliminated by non renal pathway. Because imipenem is 
rapidly hydrolysed by a brush border dehydropeptidase I of the renal proximal tube, it is 
administered in combination with cilastatin, a dehydropeptidase I inhibitor, to increase urinary 
recovery and plasma concentration [8, 9].  
It has been well described that developmental physiology, related to age and size dependant 
factors, [10, 11] have an impact on drug absorption, disposition, metabolism and excretion in 
neonates and children. Such considerations are important for the safe and effective management of 
imipenem. Seizure, a serious side effect of imipenem, has been previously associated with 
inadequate dosing adjustment in adult patients with renal impairment and pre-existing 
neurological disorder [12, 13]. A correlation between high imipenem concentration and seizure 
apparition has also been suggested in a case report of an adult patient with mild renal dysfunction 
[14]. In terms of efficacy, beta-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems, requires that free-drug 
concentrations stay above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for at least 40% of the 
dosing interval [1, 3, 15], but 50 – 60% is sometimes preferred in neonates due to the immaturity of 
their immunity [16]. Although imipenem dosing is well established in adults, in patients with 
impaired renal function, in geriatric patients and in infants ≥ 3 months of age [17], only few studies 
have evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of imipenem in neonates [18-23]. In the present work, 
we aimed at characterizing imipenem PK in a larger cohort of neonates and to define clinical and 

 
142 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
demographic factors that might influence the disposition of this drug in this fragile population of 
premature and severely ill infants.  
III.3.2. Method 
Study population 
All neonates admitted in the Service of Neonatology of the Lausanne University Hospital that had at 
least one imipenem concentration measurement within the framework of a routine therapeutic 
drug monitoring (TDM) program were retrieved between 2002 and 2013 from the laboratory and 
medical charts. Imipenem co-formulated with cilastatin (Tienam®, MSD Merck Sharp & Dohme AG, 
Kenilworth, USA) was administered intravenously over a 30 min infusion. The conventional initial 
dosing regimen was 15 to 20 mg/kg every 8 to 24 hours according to birth weight and postnatal 
age. Individualized dosage regimen could be applied for maintenance dose, according to imipenem 
concentration measurements. 
For each patient, time of sampling, time of last dose preceding blood sampling and dosing history 
was collected. Blood samples were collected at peak (29%) with sampling made between 1 and 2 
hours after the start of infusion and at trough (71%) between 5 to 24 hours after the start of 
infusion. The median number of samples per patient was 2 (range 1 - 8) for a median number of 
occasion of 1 (range 1 - 4). One patient was removed because of missing information on dosing time 
and two concentrations were discarded due to suspected sampling bias. The following clinical and 
demographic characteristics were collected: sex, birth body weight (bBW), body weight at the time 
of blood sampling (BW), birth height (bHT), height at the time of blood sampling (HT), gestational 
age (GA), postnatal age (PNA), creatininemia (CRT), concomitant treatment with furosemide, 
spironolactone, hydrochlorothiazide, vancomycine, metronidazole and erythromycin. If CRT or HT 
were not available on the day of sampling, they were calculated by linear interpolation between 
two closest known adjacent values of PK sampling. For 3 patients, interpolation was not possible 

 
143 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
and the CRT value of the previous day was used. For 7 patients, interpolation was not possible to 
obtain HT. Since BW and HT were highly correlated (R2 = 0.88), we derived HT based on the linear 
regression model of BW and HT. This retrospective study was approved by the ethics committee of 
the Faculty of Biology and Medicine of the University of Lausanne.  
Bioanalytical Assays 
From 2002 until March 2010, free fraction of imipenem plasma concentrations was determined by 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The calibration curves were linear in the range of 
0.25 to 200 mg/L and coefficient of variation (CV) was < 5%. After March 2010, total plasma 
imipenem concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg/L and the 
method was precise (inter-day CV < 7%) and accurate (biais <12%). 
Plasma creatinine measurements were performed using the modified Jaffe reaction on a Cobas 
8000 analyser (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). The LOQ was 15 μmol/L and the CV was 
3.0%.  
Pharmacokinetic modeling 
Base model 
The population PK analysis was performed using a nonlinear mixed effect modeling approach with 
NONMEM® (version 7.1.0, ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA). Free and total 
plasma imipenem concentration were analysed together considering that imipenem is little bound 
to proteins, that total serum concentration protein is low and binding affinity is reduced in 
neonates [24] and from the observation that free and total plasma concentrations were within the 
same range. Analytical method was also evaluated as covariate in the model. Additionally stepwise 
procedure was used to identify the model that best fitted the data. One-, two- and three-
compartment model were tested with linear and nonlinear elimination. Inter-individual variability 

 
144 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
was modeled on the PK parameters assuming exponential errors following a log-normal 
distribution. Additive, proportional and combined proportional and additive error model were 
tested to describe the intra-individual (residual) variability.  
Covariate model 
The correlation between individual PK parameter estimates and the available covariates was first 
explored graphically. Potentially influencing covariates were then included in the model. The 
rationale for covariate modeling was elaborated based on developmental pharmacokinetics [24, 25] 
and include size, age in the initial model developments.  
Since BW is obtained more reliably and easily than HT [26, 27], and considering the good 
correlation between both parameters, BW was used as a proxy of HT. Its influence on the PK 
parameters was quantified using an allometric power model defined as      B P  , where    is 
the typical value of the parameter P, and PWR was set to 0.75 for clearance parameters (clearance 
and intercompartmental clearance) and 1 for volume parameters (central and peripheral volume of 
distributions). Other covariates: GA, PNA, postmenstrual age (PMA) defined as GA plus PNA in 
weeks, 
CRT, 
concomitant 
treatment 
(furosemide, 
spironolactone, 
hydrochlorothiazide, 
vancomycine, metronidazole and erythromycin), gender and analytical method were included in 
the model following a sequential forward selection and backward elimination. Continuous 
covariates were tested for potential relationship using linear, exponential and power model, except 
for CRT for which only a power function of CRT was used to quantify its influence on clearance (CL). 
Postnatal age was also tested using a piece-wise function on clearance CL and PMA was tested as 
well using a Hill equation [28, 29]. When more than one covariate describing totally or partially the 
same age effect was included (GA and PNA versus PMA), the second age variable was not 
investigated. Concomitant treatment, gender and analytical method were evaluated using a 
categorical model. 
 

 
145 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
Parameter Estimation and Model Selection 
Model estimation was performed using the first-order conditional estimation with interaction 
(FOCE-I). Imipenem concentration measurements below the LOQ were handled with the M3 
likelihood based approach described by Ahn et al [30]. As a goodness-of-fit statistic, NONMEM® 
uses an objective function. The likelihood ratio test, based on the difference in objective function 
value (ΔOF) was used to compare two models. Since -2 log likelihood, approximate χ2 distribution, 
it was considered statistically significant if it exceeded 3.8 (p<0.05) and 6.6 (p<0.01) points, for one 
additional parameter during model-building and backward deletion procedures, respectively. 
Model assessment was also based on goodness-of-fit plots along with precision of the PK 
parameters estimations, and the reduction of inter- and intra- individual variability of the 
population PK parameters. Apart from BW and age that were initially introduced in the model, 
covariates were retained if they were judged clinically significant based on an effect of at least 20% 
and on the importance of the reduction in inter-individual and/or residual variability. Besides, 
shrinkage was examined. A sensitivity analysis was performed for patients with absolute values for 
conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) greater than 3 to test for potential bias in parameter 
estimation and in covariate exploration. Because creatinine often reflects maternal creatinine 
during the first days of life, another sensitivity analysis was performed ignoring patients that had 
imipenem concentration measurements during the first 3 days after birth [31]. 
Evaluation method 
The final model stability was assessed by the bootstrap method using the PsN-Toolkit [32] (version 
3.5.3, Uppsala, Sweden). The median and the 95% confidence interval (CI95%) estimated from 
2000 re-sampled data sets were compared to the original model estimations. In addition, 
prediction-corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPC) [33] were performed with PsN-Toolkit and 
Xpose4 [34] (version 4.3.5, Uppsala, Sweden) by simulations based on the final pharmacokinetic 
estimates using 2000 individuals. To perform the pcVPC, imipenem below the LOQ were recorded 

 
146 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
as half of the LOQ. Mean prediction-corrected concentrations with their 95% percentile interval 
(PI95%) at each time point were retrieved. Plot was generated using R (version 2.15.1, R 
Development Core Team, Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 
III.3.3. Results 
Study data 
A total of 144 imipenem plasma concentrations were obtained from 68 babies of whom 59 (87%) 
were preterm babies (median gestational age 26.7 weeks, range 24.3 – 35.6 weeks; median birth 
body weight 800 g, range 500 – 2500 g) and 9 (13%) were term newborns (median gestational age 
38.7 weeks, range 37.1 – 41.4 weeks; median birth body weight 3540 g, range 2300 – 3720 g). 
Plasma concentrations were comprised between 0.1 and 57.9 ng/mL. Data below the LOQ 
constituted 15% of the samples. Most patients were critically ill and previously treated with various 
other antibiotics before switching to imipenem and therefore mean postnatal age at first 
concentration measurement was 21 days. Characteristics of the study data are presented in Table 
3.3.1. 
Base model 
The data were best described by a two-compartment open model parameterized in terms of 
clearance (CL), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), volume of distribution of the central 
compartment (Vc) and peripheral volume of distribution (Vp) (ΔOF from the one-compartment 
model was -38.0, p<0.001).  An interindividual variability was assigned to CL and no further 
variability on any other parameters could be detected (ΔOF<-0.9, p>0.3). Intrapatient variability 
was best described by a proportional residual error model. The final base population parameters 
with interindividual variability (CV%) were a CL of 0.311 L/h (43%), a Vc of 0.519 L, a Q of 0.077 
L/h and a Vp of 0.427 L. Residual unexplained variability was 47%.

Covariate model 
The incorporation of BW on all parameters following an allometric model markedly improved the 
description of the data (ΔOF=-55.3, p<0.001). It explains 19% of the interindividual variability on 
CL. Among age parameters tested, significant linear relationships were observed between PNA 
(ΔOF=-21.0, p<0.001) and GA and CL (ΔOF=-22.1, p<0.001) that provided a further improvement of 
the model fit. GA was centred on 40 weeks, representing the full term GA. PMA also showed a 
significant linear relationship with CL, providing the same parameters estimation with the same 
drop of objective function as PNA and GA. The model integrating PMA according to the Hill equation 
did not converge. Separating the influence of each age component was rather preferred, and PMA 

 
148 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
was thus discarded from the model. Addition of age-dependant covariates explains 23% of the 
interindividual variability on CL. Creatininemia was a significant covariate on CL (ΔOF=-9.1, 
p=0.002), explaining 9 % of the remaining interpatient variability. An additional improvement of 
the data description was observed by introducing vancomycin coadministration in the model (ΔOF 
= -9.2, p=0.002). However, its effect was of limited clinical relevance, since the reduction CL was 
only of 14%, with almost no impact on reducing the inter-individual or residual unexplained 
variability. It was thus no kept in the final model. No other covariates showed any significant effect 
on imipenem disposition, including different analytical methods over time. Extend of ƞ-shrinkage 
was low (11% in the final model, which was the highest value observed during model-building). 
The model described the observed data well, as indicated by the goodness-of-fit plots in Figure 
3.3.1. A summary of the major step during covariate building is given in Table 3.3.2. According to 
the model, a term neonate (GA 40 weeks, PNA 3 weeks, BW 3.1 kg, CRT=46 μmol/l) would have a 
clearance of 0.76 L/h, while a very preterm neonate (GA 24 weeks, PNA 3 weeks, BW 0.520 kg, 
CRT=46 μmol/l) would have a clearance of 0.14 L/h (81% reduction). The half-lives of the 
disposition phase and of the terminal phase for a typical individual (GA 27 weeks, PNA 3 weeks, BW 
1.2 kg, CRT=46 μmol/l) are 1.1 and 3.3 hours, based on an estimated clearance of 0.28 L/h. Renal 
failure in a typical patient, with CRT=200 μmol/l, would decrease clearance to 0.21 L/h (20 % 
reduction).

Model Evaluation 
The median parameter estimates obtained with the bootstraps with the 95% CI are presented in 
Table 3.3.3. Median parameters differed in less than 1% from those obtained with the original 
dataset. The parameter estimates of the final population pharmacokinetic model lied within the 
95% CI of the bootstrap results suggesting that the model was acceptable. The sensitivity analysis 
concerned 2 data points. It showed that none of these concentration values affected the 
pharmacokinetic estimates with a maximum difference in parameter estimates of 14% for 
creatinine factor (data not shown). Impact of the 4 patients that received treatment during the first 
3 days of life was of little importance. A maximum difference of 21% was observed on Q estimate 
when they were removed. The results of pcVPC supported the predictive performance of the model 
and are presented in Figure 3.3.2.

III.3.4. Discussion 
This study is the first population pharmacokinetic study of imipenem performed in a cohort of 
mostly very preterm neonates suffering from severe clinical conditions. It allows identification of 
key pathophysiological factors, BW, age, and renal function status, which showed clinically 
important influence on imipenem disposition in this fragile population. This is of major importance 
in order to define adequate dosage regimen for neonates, which have been little studied.  
The primary factor influencing imipenem PK was BW, which explained an important percentage of 
the interpatient variability in drug concentrations. An allometric model described the effect of BW 

 
152 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
at best, accounting for the gradual increase in imipenem distribution and elimination with body 
weight and thus size [35, 36]. Since neonates have an immature organ system and nephrogenesis is 
incomplete in preterm newborns below 36 weeks [37], renal function is expected to influence 
imipenem elimination. Although quite low at birth, renal function changes rapidly after birth, even 
in preterm neonates [38, 39]. Inclusion of age descriptors (GA and PNA) allowed accounting for this 
maturation process starting before birth, apart from size effect. It showed that both GA and PNA are 
good predictors of concentrations and that they both should be used for initial dosage adjustment. 
Eventually, creatininemia seems to have an additional impact on imipenem elimination. Although 
CRT is generally a good predictor of GFR in adults, it is not considered a good predictor in very 
preterm neonates due to differences in muscle, age, or size compared to older infants [40, 41]. The 
use of GFR estimators such as Schwartz formulae was thus not possible in our study population. 
Nevertheless, creatininemia seemed to influence imipenem PK in addition to growth and 
maturation components, offering further description of the effect of acute renal failure on 
imipenem elimination in neonates with high CRT levels. 
None of the other covariates tested had a relevant impact on drug disposition. No difference was 
found according to the analytical methods used, confirming the very low protein binding of 
imipenem. Finally a small effect of vancomycin could be observed based on statistical criterion that 
was considered marginal once other covariates were included in the model.  
To our knowledge, only one population analysis of imipenem PK has been published in term 
neonates so far [23]. Our results suggest a reduction by about half of imipenem elimination in 
premature neonates (1.5 h vs 3.3 hours) compared to term neonates, which is mostly related to a 
larger volume of distribution (0.466 L/kg vs 0.75 L/kg for a typical patient: GA 27 weeks, PNA 3 
weeks, BW 1.2 kg). The volume of distribution is also larger than in older children (0.46 L/kg for a 
mean age of 3 years old [42] or 0.260 L/kg for a mean age of 9 years old [23] and in adult patients 
(about 0.22 L/kg) [43-47]. Changes in the ratio between total body water and fat tissue occurs 

 
153 
Population Pharmacokinetics 
during gestation and continues after birth. Since imipenem is a polar drug that is predominantly 
distributed in the intra- and extra- vascular fluid, the larger volume of distribution might thus the 
be the consequence of the larger extracellular fluid in neonates [9]. In addition, the high prevalence 
of sepsis can explain the larger distribution due to increased capillary permeability during the 
inflammatory response, fluid flow to the extracellular compartment and third spacing [48]. 
Compared to adult and children for which imipenem half-life range from 1 to 3 hours [43-47, 49-
52] and from 0.5 to 1.2 hours, respectively [23, 53]. Our study shows that elimination is lower in 
our population of neonates, which seems to be explained by the immaturity and small size of 
elimination organs and to a larger volume of distribution in preterm infants.  
The main limitation of our results is the retrospective design, fostering errors in the recollection of 
information. In addition, concentration samples were measured within the routine clinical setting 
and few samples per patient and on very limited occasion were available, thus limiting the power to 
differentiate inter from intra-individual variability. Finally, cilastatin concentration was measured 
only since 2012, and its influence could not be evaluated. 
In conclusion, the present study described the disposition of imipenem in a cohort of 
predominantly premature neonates. The large variability in its concentrations could be explained 
by physiologic and pathologic variables, including body weight, gestational age, post-natal age and 
organ capacity based on creatininemia. This model will serve to simulate concentration-time 
profiles for various dosage regimens in order to provide a priori dosing recommendations to reach 
predefined target concentration, with respect to relationship with the MIC of the most often 
organism encountered in nosocomial infections and sepsis. The results will be implemented in 
EzeCHieL, a Bayesian computer tool for dosage individualization based on a single measurement.

Adherence 
Chapter IV in the thesis context 
The benefits of a Bayesian TDM approach rely on accurate popPK models. Most of popPK models 
use data gathered during routine TDM, and assume steady-state and full adherence. However, non-
adherence might be common, particularly in chronic diseases, and thus represent an additional 
cause of unexplained variability. 
In the other side, interpretation of a single patient concentration may also suffer from ignoring 
adherence issues. 
Only a limited number of studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics in relation to adherence 
data, in particular the influence of poor adherence on population model elaboration or its impact on 
TDM measurement interpretation. In our institution, patient at risk of non-adherence for their 
antiretroviral therapy are addressed to the adherence-enhancing program of the Outpatient 
Medical Clinic, which recourse to electronic monitoring. TDM along with electronic monitoring offer 
a unique opportunity to evaluate impact of the precise drug dosing history on population model 
development and thus its reliability for concentration forecasting. It also gives the possibility to 
assess its impact on sample interpretation against patient self-reported data.

Adherence 
 
ABSTRACT 
Non-adherence is common during chronic diseases, such as HIV infection. Therapeutic drug monitoring is 
one way of monitoring antiretroviral therapy that usually relies on steady-state and full adherence 
assumptions, while neglecting non- or partial medication adherence. This study evaluates the impact of 
adherence measurement by electronic monitoring, which allows recording of longitudinal adherence data. 
Precise dosing history was compared with patient self-reported information on the estimation of lopinavir, 
atazanavir, efavirenz and etravirine population pharmacokinetic parameters. Influence of “pocket-doses” 
escaping electronic monitoring was also searched. In addition, the study evaluates the impact of adherence 
issues on clinical interpretation of individual drug levels. Population pharmacokinetic modeling, based on 
previously published studies, was performed with NONMEM® on paired datasets i.e. dosing times based on 
steady-state with full adherence assumption versus electronic dosing history, from 140 HIV-patients taking 
part in a medication-adherence enhancing program, providing 384 drug concentrations. Clearance 
estimates and likewise predicted concentrations did not markedly differ between approaches. Self-reported 
last dose intake appears to be reliable enough for concentration prediction in most patients. However, 
specific patterns of non-adherence lead to suboptimal exposure that will escape to TDM interpretation.  
  
 
 

 
165 
Adherence 
IV.1. Introduction 
Non-adherence is a common issue in the treatment of chronic diseases: up to 40% of patients who begin a 
long-term treatment stop it during the first year [1, 2]. In HIV infection management, medication adherence 
is crucial to control the viral load, to limit the emergence of resistant strains and to prevent the 
dissemination of the virus throughout the community [3-6]. Poor adherence is a significant problem in this 
population with 40% patients, who do not achieve 90% adherence worldwide[7]. Indeed, this often 
stigmatized population has to cope with a lifelong and sometimes complex treatment, associating several 
pills with up to two daily administrations. The actual clinical consequences of insufficient adherence vary 
depending on drug regimens and non-adherence patterns [8-10]. 
Although no gold standard method is universally established for the assessment of adherence, electronic 
monitoring of medication events is considered among the most reliable approaches. It records pill bottle 
openings, assumed to correspond to the times of dose intake by the patient. However, electronic monitoring 
may still underestimate adherence [11]. Actually, a not infrequent misuse of this system consists in the 
removal of more than one dose per opening for later use, called pocket-doses (PDs). Therefore, a 
combination of several adherence measurement methods probably represents the best option to assess the 
patient’s medication behaviour [12-15].  
To support patient adherence to treatment, the Community Pharmacy of the Department of Ambulatory 
Care & Community Medicine in Lausanne (Switzerland) has implemented an adherence-enhancing 
program, as previously described [16, 17]. Briefly, it combines (i) electronic recording of bottle openings 
with a Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMSTM, Aardex, MWV Healthcare, Switzerland), (ii) manual 
pill count, (iii) regular motivational interviews and (iv) feed-back to physicians and nurses. Eligible patients 
are referred to the program by their physician; all drugs prescribed in their combined antiretroviral 
therapy are monitored individually, which allows the collection of medication adherence data for each 
single molecule. At each interview and before showing the adherence electronic report to the patient, this 
latter is asked about the time usually elapsing between electronic monitor opening and medication

swallowing, whether any PDs were taken during the last period, and if so when they were actually 
swallowed.  
The use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) has been advised and incorporated into guidelines to watch 
over and possibly optimize antiretroviral therapy (ART). Actually, consistent concentration-efficacy and -
toxicity relationships have been shown for both protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) [18, 19], while their pharmacokinetics (PK) are characterised by large 
inter-individual variability for PIs and in a less extend for NNRTIs. Although evidence to support routine 
TDM use is still debated, particularly in ART-naive patients, it is generally admitted that individual patients 
can benefit from this intervention in specific clinical situations [20, 21], to ensure desired drug exposure 
and response. The Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology in Lausanne offers the determination of numerous 
antiretrovirals including ritonavir boosted-PIs (e.g. lopinavir and atazanavir) and NNRTIs (e.g. efavirenz 
and etravirine). This service is complemented with the interpretation of concentration measurements with 
a Bayesian-inspired approach based on population pharmacokinetic (popPK) models, applicable to 
concentrations measured at random sampling times [22].  
Population pharmacokinetic modeling has been largely applied to ART, mostly to relate treatment 
outcomes with pharmacokinetic variations [23]. Among other advantages, popPK approaches can handle 
sparse data, such as those collected from TDM interventions. However, this requires reliable information 
about the time of last dose intake. Moreover, it generally assumes full adherence in patients under steady-
state regimen. Thus, knowing in particular that a frequent reason for TDM request is uncertain adherence, 
popPK models built up on TDM data may be flawed due to inaccurate dosing history [23-25]. Biases due to 
adherence issues may thus occur both during the elaboration of reference information for TDM 
interpretation, and during the specific interpretation of a single patient sample.  
Therefore, we aimed to evaluate whether electronic measurement of adherence would influence popPK 
parameter estimation, compared with the mere assumption of steady-state with full adherence. We also 
wanted to determine to what extent neglecting PDs might impact on parameter estimation that

incorporates electronic adherence data. Our second objective was to assess the importance of adherence 
measurement in terms of individual concentration prediction, as it is usually performed during TDM 
interpretation. 
IV.2. Method 
Study and subjects 
This retrospective observational study included all naïve or experienced patients enrolled in the Swiss HIV 
Cohort Study (SHCS, www.shcs.ch) and referred to the above mentioned adherence-enhancing program 
between 2004 (establishment of the program) and 2011, who had at least one TDM measurement for any of 
the following antiretroviral agent: Lopinavir (LPV) co-formulated with ritonavir, Atazanavir (ATV) co-
prescribed with ritonavir, Efavirenz (EFV) and Etravirine (ETV). It received approval from the local Ethics 
Committee for clinical research number 25/14.  
Analytical method 
Blood samples (5ml) were collected into lithium-heparinate or potassium-EDTA syringes (Monovette®, 
Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Plasma was isolated by centrifugation, virus inactivated in a 60°C water 
bath for 60 min, and stored at -20°C until analysis. Total plasma drug concentrations were determined by 
liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) according to validated 
methods [26-29]. Calibration curves are linear up to 20 μg/ml for LPV, up to 10 μg/ml for ATV and EFV, and 
up to 4 μg/ml for ETV.

Patient self-reported last drug intake before TDM was recorded on the day of blood sampling. In parallel, 
electronic monitor data were retrieved on a period of 5  literature half-lives before each blood sample[25], 
a sufficient time to assume steady-state in case of full adherence, i.e. 10 days for LPV, ATV and ETV and 15 
days for EFV. This period thus always included a weekend, when drug intake is known to be less accurate 
[30, 31]. Electronic data were reconciled with interview notes and pill count according to an operational 

 
168 
Adherence 
manual. PDs identified during the reconciliation process were added into electronic monitor dosing history. 
We thus obtained three paired datasets for each molecule considered: (A) a first one assuming steady-state 
with full adherence, with the time of last dose intake before drug level measurements as reported by the 
patient, and (B) a second one built up with the detailed history of drug intake over the last 10 to 15 days, 
reconciled from electronic monitor records and patients’ allegations. The last dataset (C) was built up , 
incorporating exclusively the raw electronic monitor information on dosing history but disregarding 
patients’ information on PDs.  
Data analysis 
Time differences between self-reported and electronic monitor recorded times of last dose intake before 
blood sampling for TDM were evaluated by calculating: 
Time interval difference (∆t) = Patient self-reported time – electronic monitor recorded time 
Population PK model parameters were estimated by nonlinear mixed effect modeling with NONMEM® 
(version 7.3.0, ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA), using first-order conditional estimation 
with interaction (FOCEI). PopPK models were chosen based on previously published studies [32-35], 
without consideration for covariates. 
Shortly, all molecules were described according to a one compartment-model parameterized in terms of 
clearance (CL) and distribution volume (Vd). Absorption was described by a first order-process (constant 
Ka), except for ETV assumed to follow a zero-order process (constant D1). A lag time (ALAG) was defined 
for ATV. Residual variability was deemed proportional for EFV and ETV, while a mixed error model 
(combining proportional and additive residual variability) was used for LPV and ATV. Inter-individual 
variability on PK parameters was described with exponential errors.  
To evaluate the influence of pocket-doses (PDs) on PK parameter estimation, the use of PDs if any by 
patients was entered in the model as an index or dummy variable (Q1) as follow: 

 
169 
Adherence 
                
where    is the typical value of the PK parameter  ,    is the fractional change in parameter   associated 
with PDs use, and Q1 is equal to either 0 or 1. Different criteria were tried sequentially for coding PDs use 
with Q1 = 1: 
(i)  when PDs were identified at anytime during the recovered dosing history; 
(ii)  when PDs were identified in the two days preceding TDM; 
(iii) when identified PDs represented at least 50% of recovered dosing history. 
From the retained model, popPK estimation was compared between two types of datasets: (A) steady-state 
and full adherence assumption with self-reported last dosing time, versus (B) reconciliated adherence data 
from electronic monitors and patient interviews. A third, considering raw electronic data (C) was also 
analyzed, neglecting all PDs recovered from interviews and considering them merely as missed doses. The 
95% confidence intervals (CI95%) for parameters were estimated using the bootstrap method on 2000 re-
sampled data sets. Model-based population concentration profiles with their 95% prediction interval 
(PI95%) were generated as well from 2000 simulations for each drug, for the 3 types of datasets described 
above. 
Differences in post hoc Bayesian individual parameter estimates between dataset types A and B, and 
between dataset type A and C, were evaluated by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for paired observations. 
Individual predicted concentrations (Cipred) based on both dataset types were compared with actual 
observations, and relative predictions errors (PEi) were computed as the difference of both these prediction 
errors. Relative bias was computed as the mean relative prediction error (MPE), and relative imprecision 
was calculated from the difference in mean squared error (MSE), expressed as root mean squared error 
(RMSE) [36]:

IV.3. Results 
A total of 384 blood samples were collected in 140 patients. Data by drug are detailed in Table 4.1. The 
number of missed doses was higher for PIs than for NNRTIs but globally low, below 5% for all drugs. Time 
interval differences between both dosing data collection methods was almost centred around 0 and 
symmetrically distributed for all drugs, with a mean and standard deviation for LPV: -0.6 ± 4.7 hours, for 
ATV: 0.3 ± 7.9 hours, for EFV: 0.4 ± 3.4 hours, for ETV: -1.1 ± 5.7 hours. Histogram plots of time interval 
differences are depicted in Figure 4.1. The time interval difference was greater than ± 3 hours for 48 blood 
samples (LPV: 22 (17%); ATV: 13 (14%); EFV: 5 (9%) and ETV: 8 (28%)).

PDs did not affect significantly the estimation of parameters for all drugs, irrespective of the way it was 
taken into account, and the corresponding term was thus not kept in the models. 
 
Population PK parameters estimates with their CI95% are presented in Table 4.2. Comparing the results 
from self-reported data and steady-state full adherence assumption with those from reconciled electronic 
data, population clearance (CL) was similar no matter the dosing history input, with a maximum difference 
of 4% for ETV. Conversely, population volume of distribution (Vd) could differ largely according to the 
dosing history input (discrepancy for LPV: 39%, for EFV: 47% and for ETV: 87%), which was also the case 
for absorption constant (discrepancy for LPV: 48% and for ETV: 24%). Only ATV retained similar 
population volume of distribution (relative difference of 3%), while its absorption parameters were fixed. 

 
173 
Adherence 
For all other population parameters, estimation was essentially similar whatever the dosing input (relative 
differences <20%), except for inter-individual variability on CL for ATV (difference of 80%). When the raw 
electronic monitor data were considered, without addition of the doses identified during the reconciliation 
procedure, LPV parameters where particularly affected regarding Vd, absorption constant and above all, 
residual error. By contrast, estimates did not vary so drastically for the other drugs.

Based on the final models estimated from each dosing history input, concentration profiles were simulated

ranges, independently of the method used to record the dosing history.

estimates did not reach statistical significance for LPV and ATV (median ∆CL= 0.0 L/h, P=0.06 and median 
∆CL= 0.1 L/h, P=0.07 respectively), while they did so for EFV and ETV (median ∆CL= - 0.1 L/h and -1.1 L/h 
respectively, P=0.02 for both drugs) if a level α=5% is considered. Using the raw electronic data, with all 
PDs considered as missed doses, only LPV showed a difference in individual clearance estimation (median 
∆CL = 0.1 L/h, P=0.001).  
A summary of the MPE between predictors calculated under steady-state full adherence assumption and 
reconciled electronic data is presented Table 4.3. All CI95% included 0, indicating no systematic differences 
of prediction between both approaches, neither did predictions with the raw electronic data. The 
comparison of MSE shows that reconciled electronic data produced more precise predictions than patient 
self-reporting for LPV, ATV and ETV, and particularly LPV. Only EFV predictions were slightly better with 
patient self-reported data. Predictions for all drugs based on raw electronic monitor data remained slightly 
more precise than those based on patient self-reporting.

Even though predictions appear globally similar between the different methods used to record dosing 
histories in our datasets, they may significantly differ for specific patients according to their adherence 
patterns. To illustrate this issue, representative patient profiles, taken from the dataset used for this 
analysis, for LPV (patients 1, 2 and 3) and EFV (patients 4, 5 and 6) are depicted in Figure 4.3. 
 

 
177 
Adherence 
In the case of a large number of doses consecutively missed few days before the visit (patient 1and patient 
4), despite similar time interval  with respect to last dose intake according to self-report and electronic 
record, the predicted Ctrough vary greatly between the steady-state with full adherence assumption and the 
reconciled electronic monitor record. This is in accordance with individual CL estimation: for patient 1, the 
difference in predicted trough concentration (∆Ctrough) was 2380 ng/ml and a difference in individual CL 
was 0.74 L/h, while patient 4 showed ∆Ctrough of 1202 ng/ml and a difference in individual CL of 1.12 L/h. If 
a sparser pattern of missed dose is examined (one missed dose at a time), the differences in predicted 
trough concentration become much smaller: patient 2 and 5 had respectively a ∆Ctrough of 242 ng/ml and ∆C 
of 77 ng/ml. However, even one missed dose can show a drastic though transient drop in drug exposure. 
The last examples illustrate patients well adherent, taking all their doses regularly, but the time interval 
between dosing and sampling reported by the patient differ from the value recorded by the electronic 
monitor by more than 2 hours. The resulting differences on predicted Ctrough were of little importance for 
LPV and insignificant for EFV: patient 3 and patient 6 had a ∆Ctrough of 727 ng/ml and ∆Ctrough of 84 ng/ml, 
respectively. Difference in individual CL between both approaches for patients 3, 4, 5 and 6 were always 
smaller than 0.28 L/h. 
IV.4. Discussion 
In this observational study, popPK models based on dosing data either assuming steady-state with perfect 
adherence or using precise electronic monitor dosing records resulted in very similar estimations of 
population CL, which is the most important pharmacokinetic parameter determining average concentration 
exposure. Conversely, the type of dosing data tended to affect the population Vd as well as absorption 
parameters, known to correlate with one another. This was not the case for EFV and ATV, whose absorption 
constants were fixed according to the referred publication in order to achieve convergence. In contrast, for 
LPV, electronic monitor records revealed several measurements occurring in the first hours after the last 
dose intake, which were not reported by the patients. This probably explains the noticeable changes in 
absorption parameters and Vd estimation. Within-patient variability was said to be highly sensitive to 

 
178 
Adherence 
variable adherence [24]. In this study though, intra-individual variability seemed not affected by the type of 
dosing input. However, we had only few patients with several samplings. A study design that could collect 
several samples per patients would be of interest to evaluate this issue. 
The procedure of reconciliation of electronic monitor records with patients’ allegations, set up in the frame 
of our adherence program, made it possible to capture the majority of the PDs made by the patients, 
compared to raw electronic monitor data. This gives a more realistic picture of the patients’ adherence in 
routine care. In our observations however, only lopinavir popPK parameters estimation would have been 
largely affected by missing patient information about dosing history, even though the frequency of PDs was 
in the same range for the other drugs (see Table 4.1). Neglecting PDs and merely treating them as missing 
doses for popPK analysis is expected to overestimate inter-individual variability and to bias PK parameters. 
The underestimation of adherence by electronic monitor might be of importance for certain drugs, 
particularly those with a shorter half-life. Thus, as LPV typically exhibits a rather short half-life even with 
ritonavir boost, a thorough estimation of adherence taking PDs into account is of importance. The concept 
of forgivingness was invoked to account for viral suppression despite incomplete adherence under 
combined antiretroviral treatments. While an adherence rate of at least 95% was formerly advocated to 
achieve sustained viral suppression and to prevent the emergence of resistance mutations [37, 38], the 
advent of ritonavir-boosted PI regimens as well as more potent NNRTIs might alleviate this constraint to 
some extent [39-41]. Improved potency and longer half-lives of boosted-PIs and NNRTIs are indeed among 
the reasons for improved forgiveness [42], as these agents produce exposure levels much higher than HIV 
replication inhibiting concentrations (IC90), less likely to drop down to subtherapeutic levels with 
infrequent missed doses. Yet despite these considerations, any increase in the degree of adherence 
increases the probability of viral suppression [39, 43]. 
TDM is one tool among others that can support physicians in patient’s care, to prevent therapeutic failure 
due to insufficient drug exposure or limited adherence. The pre-dose concentration Ctrough is the classical 

 
179 
Adherence 
parameter to optimize by TDM interventions for PIs and NNRTIs. Target trough concentrations have indeed 
been proposed for most anti-HIV drugs in the control of wild-type HIV-1 infection [44]. Others predictors of 
efficacy have been promoted, such as maximal concentration (Cmax) or area under the curve (AUC)[45]. The 
inhibitory quotient (IQ), derived from the ratio of Ctrough over virological sensitivity (IC90), probably 
represents a promising alternative [19].  
Measuring true trough concentrations may be impractical in outpatients, hence the interest of Bayesian 
prediction of Ctrough based on popPK models. Still the interpretation of a concentration measurement 
requires a precise knowledge of the times of sample collection and of last dose intake. As expected, a small 
variation in the dosing to sampling interval showed no significant impact on concentration prediction. 
Conversely, some specific patterns of poor adherence may have an important impact on the estimation of 
individual PK parameters and thus on prediction, as shown by patients 1 and 4 in our examples. In general, 
TDM is not ideally suited as a measure of adherence, as it essentially reflects the intake of one or a few 
previous doses. The monitoring of pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic (viral load and CD4 count) 
markers may increase health literacy and patient adherence by impacting on patient’s motivation and 
management of treatment if such data are discussed emphatically with patients[46]. It has also been said 
that pharmacodynamic markers might benefit from more accurate recording of dosing history [47]. 
A major limitation of our study was the limited amount of data available, which prevented extensive 
modeling of the results. Still our analysis shows that, even though electronic monitor records are usually 
assumed to provide more reliable information on adherence than other methods, this information should 
be interpreted with caution, as it relies on uncertain assumptions: e.g. that each opening corresponds to a 
removed and directly ingested dose; or that the dose removed corresponds to the nominal dose prescribed 
(for instance, a nominal prescription of 400 mg of lopinavir q.d. means to remove and to ingest 2 pills of 
200 mg from the electronic monitor bottle). Thus, the approach of reconciling electronic monitor data with 
patients’ allegations should be privileged in such studies.  

 
180 
Adherence 
Another limitation was possibly that the study subpopulation did not reflect the overall population 
receiving ART. Patients referred to the adherence enhancing program have different characteristics than 
the entire HIV population: for example, besides problematic adherence, they were more often women with 
lower CD4 count [48]. The program showed successful results with 87% of persistence and 88% of 
execution [16].  
Patient non-adherence issues are tackled during the medication adherence program to ensure adherence 
and success of treatment. Therefore, monitored patient adherence is quite high with restrained deviation 
from prescription and few nonadherent patients, which is probably closer from the behaviour of the 
population under ART.  
In conclusion, this observational study showed that popPK analysis assuming steady-state with full 
adherence produced results similar to those based on precise electronic monitor recorded dosing history 
reconciled with patients’ allegations. This reconciliation is important to identify PDs and correct the raw 
electronic monitor data according to a standardized procedure. Some drugs, less forgivable, may specially 
suffer from unrecorded PDs. Self-reported last dose intake appears to be reliable enough for concentration 
prediction in most patients. However, specific patterns of non-adherence lead to suboptimal exposure that 
will escape to TDM interpretation. Thus, especially in problematic patients, it is probably a combination of 
monitoring methods that best captures the complementary aspects of patients’ exposure to therapeutic 
agents in routine care: longitudinal follow up of medication behaviour through electronic monitoring and 
actual quantitative measurement through TDM.

CHAPTER V. DISCUSSION AND PERSPECTIVES 
 
 
 
 

 

 
Discussion & Perspectives 
187 
V.1. Discussion 
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring relying on population PK/PD currently represents the state-of-the-art 
of drug dosage individualization. Concentration measurement without clinical interpretation is of 
poor value. Because of limited data availability (one concentration marred by uncertainty) and 
difficulties to obtain exact Ctrough in clinical practice, PK interpretation largely benefits from 
Bayesian approach. Whereas, Bayesian forecasting can be mathematically demanding, we present 
the development of a new tool, EzeCHieL, to be used in clinical routine dedicated to this task. 
EzeCHieL provides essential information about expectedness and suitability of blood drug 
concentrations and gives dosage adjustment suggestion if needed. It offers a simple solution to 
develop patient tailored dosage regimen based on Bayesian feedback, which represents the gold-
standard currently. In the emerging field of personalized medicine, it allows maximising 
therapeutic benefits for patient being treated with drugs candidate for TDM. 
Implementation of Bayesian methods has also some limitations. It requires the right definition of 
the model, accurate and precise estimates of the PK model parameters, appropriate parameters 
distribution assumption, no change in individual PK parameters over time to trust a posteriori 
information, as well as quality of dosage. Finally, estimates should be obtained from data arising 
from the specific patient population, except if modeling and simulation allows extrapolating [1, 2]. 
Regarding special subpopulation, extrapolation cannot be performed for patients in early stage of 
life. There are also ethical and practical constraints related to the investigation of the fate of the 
drugs in this population. Therefore, dosing requirement and pharmacotherapy management 
continue to be a challenge in neonates. We present two population studies performed with data 
generated during routine clinical practice, providing in-house models to overcome those problems 
since it permits to characterise the PK of drugs and factors influencing drug exposure in this 
subpopulation. Their implementation in EzeCHieL allows Bayesian forecasting and drug dosage 

 
188 
Discussion & Perspectives 
regimen suggestion. Such quantitative pharmacological approaches have been recognised as a 
concept to enhance drugs development and appropriate routine use of drugs. In the last decade, 
regulatory agencies have recognized the role of modeling and simulations. In paediatrics, drug 
development programs have been growing and a number of initiatives have been undertaken [3, 4]. 
The reliability of the population models used along with adherence has been investigated in this 
thesis. In our study, Bayesian forecasting supported the use of population PK model and 
implementation in EzeCHieL. Since population PK models implemented in the software and 
simulations enable to derive expected concentration range (percentiles), it also allows evaluating 
some issues such as drug-interaction, specific individual PK characteristics or adherence. 
Practice of TDM relies on the correlation between plasma drug concentration and therapeutic 
outcomes. An important limitation of this work was the lack of pharmacodynamics (PD) data. Thus, 
the association between plasma concentration and therapeutic endpoints was not investigated. In 
the scope of anti-infective agents or other drugs, this following hypothesis is accepted, but not yet 
supported, that target concentration is the same in infants, children and adults [5]. Reason to not 
support entirely this theory yet is the lack of adequate PD studies in paediatric population (the MIC 
are often determined in vitro or in adults), the stage of development that can alter PK (absorption, 
elimination, protein binding, etc.) and response to drug, as well as differences in organ penetration 
of the drug. 
A number of issues arise from the development of new technologies in medicine. Acceptance among 
clinicians, in large and small facilities, has encountered considerable resistance [6]. Moreover, 
concerns for ethics and patient privacy are often raised [7, 8]. From the economic point of view, 
setting up Health Information Technology (HIT) would cause massive expenditure but it is believed 
that it would be compensate with the net saving awarded. So far, cost effectiveness has however not 
been demonstrated [9]. Use of new technologies should be adapted to literacy skills of the potential

users, and creating an intuitive interface appears to be critical. Ultimately, there is currently a lack 
of appropriate infrastructure and connectivity for a successful implementation [7, 10]. During the 
conception of EzeCHieL, we keep in mind those issues and as its development is performed in the 
scope of a multidisciplinary project, we attempt to address them at different levels (acceptance, 
privacy, user-friendliness, appropriate implementation in the existing structure, cost). 
V.2. Perspectives 
Since 1950, rate of drug introduction on the market remains constant, but drug industry is 
progressively less innovative [11] and more and more drugs are administered on long term. This 
largely fosters current TDM expansion. Monitoring of existing or new critical therapies and dosage 
individualization will transform clinical practice and patients care. There is a cultural change 
occurring. Particularly with the progress of embedded, miniaturized devices able to measure drug 
concentration of biomarkers directly on hand of the clinician and the availability of novel 
computing tools to support interpretation, drug monitoring will spread out.  
However, there are still room for improvements in monitoring drug therapy for practical care 
management of patients. Many monitoring strategies have been set up without critical assessment. 
There is a need for prospective controlled clinical trial [12]. Clinical research has not yet devoted 
sufficient attention to evaluate monitoring procedure. Improvement of concentration monitoring 
strategy will gain in increasing the aggregation of concentration and effect data at large scale and by 
redirecting PK/PD modeling towards monitoring question compared to sole clinical trial purpose. 
Such data should be aggregated in systematic reviews to retrieve the more information possible 
[13]. It would support better definition of necessary criteria for monitoring and rationalise the 
procedure. Central coordination and repositories should allow dissemination and facilitate clinical 
use. Efficient monitoring tool, such as EzeCHieL, will ensure wide access to monitoring procedure 
and to conceptual criteria of TDM application [14]. At the current stage, EzeCHieL is almost fully 

 
190 
Discussion & Perspectives 
developed software that will be under beta testing shortly. Larger diffusion is expected and support 
via a semi-private structure will ensure continuous evolution. Later, it will be embedded, to point-
of-care system currently under development in the frame of ISyPeM project.  
This work focus mostly on neonates, but in the other side, the population is aging and this trend is 
accelerating in the world. Elderly people are often neglected during drug development. Variability 
in drug response is increased at both sides of these age spectrum and that may warrant precise 
dosing modification also in older adults. Older adults also undergo age-specific change in 
physiological parameters that influence their pharmacokinetic profile. Frail geriatric patients are 
associated with polymorbidity and multiple treatments. There is no appropriate model using scaled 
parameters to describe the non linearity observed in this population as well. Modeling can provide 
the link necessary for developing safe and efficient treatments to those patients. Further studies 
should thus also focus on elderly [15, 16]. 
Current practice uses dosage regimen defined for population target intervals. However there is a 
lack of PD studies to define rational dosing, as, for example, for those subpopulation described 
above. PK variability is recognised as an important source of variability in drug response, but the 
inter-individual differences in PD aspects of drug response need also to be considered. Thus, the 
following step is to take into account individual PD sensitivity rather than the expected population 
response and the use of individual target along with individual TDM observation represents 
another move in the personalized medicine [17]. The concept of target concentration could be 
defined as the optimal concentration for achieving efficacy with the lower possible toxicity for an 
individual. This more active approach is already advocated and has been named Target 
Concentration Intervention (TCI) [18]. 
Thus, progress in many facets of drug monitoring is ongoing and represents a desired extension of 
drug development. In that context, the outcomes represent possible solutions to improve TDM.
