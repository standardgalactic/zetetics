Deﬁnition of Intelligence
▶Intelligence has many deﬁnitions in diverse
disciplines.
▶The most comprehensive collection of deﬁnitions of
intelligence to date: (Legg and Hutter, 2007).
▶A widely accepted deﬁnition of General Intelligence
in AGI circles:
The ability to achieve complex goals in complex
environments. (Goertzel, 2012)
Let us refer to this kind of intelligence as
Goal Oriented Intelligence (GOI)

Goal-oriented Intelligence is a measure of an agent’s
competence to match actions to observations such that it
will achieve optimal rewards in a variety of environments.

Critique of Goal-oriented Intelligence
The deﬁnition is based on a few presumptions:
▶A sharp agent-environment distinction;
▶that imply well deﬁned interactions.
▶The environment is initially unknown but is observer
independent and a priori given;
▶Goals given in terms of reward functions are a priori
given and unchanging;
▶The agent’s computational capacities;
These presumptions appeal strongly to common sense
and frame the concept of intelligence in a reasonable and
pragmatic manner.

Limits of the deﬁnition
However, these presumptions also limit the generality of
the concept in at least three profound ways:
▶They disregard processes of agent-environment
differentiation and boundary formation;
▶They disregard processes of goal and value
formation – intelligence never starts with solving a
problem but much earlier in the formation of the
problematic situation;
▶They also disregard reﬂexivity: interactions with other
intelligent agents whose goals are unknown and their
behaviors are not yet determined.

Going beyond the limits
In short:
▶The current deﬁnition of intelligence covers only a
well determined kind of intelligence;
▶But neglects the more profound and difﬁcult to deﬁne
process of the emergence of intelligent behaviors.
▶Therefore, it would be interesting to ask:
What is intelligence prior to anything intelligible?

Minimizing Constraints
What if we give up:
▶the clear boundaries and distinctions between agent
and environment;
▶the implied observations and actions that are made
possible by such boundaries and distinctions;
▶and ﬁnally, the deﬁnite goals with their associated
mapping of rewards.
It seems as if nothing is left to build upon:
▶If there are no prior distinctions,
▶how is one to make sense out of a non-sense
situation where no agents or objects can be
identiﬁed to begin with?

A truly general kind of intelligence
▶By reducing to the minimum the presumptions that
constrain the conventional concept, we develop the
new concept of Open-ended Intelligence (OEI):
Open-ended Intelligence (OEI) precedes the well char-
acterized concept of Goal-oriented Intelligence (GOI), it
makes fewer presumptions and therefore is
fundamentally more general.

A Conceptual Leap
A conceptual leap needs to be taken here:
While the concept of Goal-oriented Intelligence answers
the question “what does it mean to be intelligent?”,
the concept of Open-ended Intelligence focuses on a
prior question: “what does it mean to become
intelligent?”.
Open-ended Intelligence:
The process of becoming intelligent –
the sense-making that precedes clear distinctions and
goals and brings them forth.

Ontology of Individuals
▶To develop a theory of Open-ended Intelligence a
new ontology is required.
▶Our conventional system of thought is grounded in
entities called Individuals.
▶Individuals are primary ontological elements.
▶Unambiguously deﬁnable (Aristotle’s principle of the
excluded middle).
▶We understand the world by identifying individuals
and relations among them.
▶Everything starts and ends with individuals.
▶The genesis of individuals is merely the manner by
which one individual transitions into another.
▶Stable entitites are primary; change is secondary.

Ontology of Individuation
We base the concept of Open-ended Intelligence on a
radically different ontology:
▶Individuals are replaced with individuation.
▶The theory of individuation is an ontological
paradigm shift developed by G. Simondon.
▶Instead of positing individuals as the primary
ontological elements,
▶It posits as primary the process of their becoming i.e.
their individuation.
Individuation:
Individuation is the formation or becoming of individuals.
It is a primal formative process whereas boundaries and
distinctions arise without assuming any individual(s) that
precede(s) them.

The metastable individual
In the new ontology:
▶Individuals are merely temporarily stable phases
within a continuous process of transformation.
▶An individual is always pregnant with not yet
actualized and not yet known potentialities and
tensions that may determine future states.
▶Three overlapping conditions of individuation:
metastability, intensity, incompatibility.

Metastability
▶Metastability is the condition of a ﬂuid state-space topology where
changes in the number of state variables and their relations reform the
location and shape of attractors that signify relatively stable individuals.
Intensity
▶Intensity is a general term for differences that drive structural and state
changes in a system.
▶Intensities are context speciﬁc and depend on the nature of the system
(e.g. temperature, chemical concentration, economic resources
distribution, psychological needs, distribution of populations etc.)
Incompatibility
▶Incompatibility is the situation where a set of interacting elements pose
to each other problems that prompt resolution.
▶The problematic situation is unstable, non-organized, and lacks
coordinated interactions. Does not give itself to a systematic description.
▶Predator-prey relationships is an exemplar of a problematic situation.

Example: an argument
▶An argument is an individuating system.
▶It goes through various semi-stable states such as partial agreements or
crises and therefore it is a metastable situation harboring unrealized
potentials of change in personal relations.
▶The parties desire to each hold to her own convictions and persuade the
other to change his. This desire is the intensity that drives and animates
the interaction.
▶Thinking differently about a situation that requires a joint coordinated
action is a problematic situation. The incompatibility in perspective
between the parties must be resolved at least to a degree that allows the
necessary joint action.

Transduction - the mechanism of individuation
▶Consider interactions among a collection of initially incompatible agents.
▶The outcome of interactions is unpredictable as they do not follow
systemic development.
▶Prior to, and in the course of the actual interactions, the outcome is said
to be determinable but not yet determined.
▶Transduction is a process of ongoing progressive co-determination
among agents.
▶Progressive determination necessitates the actual localized and
contextualized interactions where the participating agents reciprocally
determine the behavioral and structural aspects of each other.
▶As incompatibilities are resolved and intensities are relaxed, coherent
structure and dynamics stabilize and an individual emerges as an
assemblage of simpler agents.

From individuation to individuals
Assemblages
Networks of interacting heterogeneous individuals that
have established partial compatibility among them.
(Developed by Deleuze and Guattari (1987) and further extended by De Landa (2006))
▶Assemblages possess an intrinsic though metastable
individuality; an individuality that does not depend on
an external observer but only on the relations that
have been stabilized among their elements.
▶Individuals as assemblages are characterized by:
▶Identifying properties – that deﬁne them as the
individuals that they are (and subject therefore to
their own individuation).
▶Capacities to interact– to affect and be affected by
other external elements.

The open-endedness of individuals
▶While the individual’s properties are more or less
stable and independent, the set of its interactive
capacities is open and inexhaustible.
▶It depends on the actual and contingent encounters
with other individuals and the relations formed as a
consequence.
▶Since there is no limit to the number and kind of
relations, the set of capacities to interact is
open-ended and unpredictable.
▶What becomes determined in transduction are the
actual interactive capacities.
▶This is why the actual interaction is necessary for the
determination and why the resulting relations cannot
be predicted a priori.

Implication: The individuation of knowledge
▶Individuation has a profound impact on epistemology:
▶According to the ontology of individuation,
knowledge is not discovered but individuates.
▶Acquiring knowledge involves the formation of a new
assemblage:
▶The subject of knowledge, the object of knowledge
and the relations between them arise together in the
course of a process where incompatibilities are
resolved and coherent relations are established.
▶These come to constitute individuated knowledge as
both object and subject co-determine each other.

Open-ended Intelligence (OEI)
Our thesis:
The formative processes that bring forth individuals as
‘solutions’ to problematic situations that are initially
unformed, are manifesting Open-ended Intelligence
(OEI).
From a philosophical perspective:
Open-ended Intelligence manifests all around us and at
many scales. General systems whether natural like
galaxies, stars, rivers, chemical compounds, weather
systems etc., or artiﬁcial such as tools, machines, wars,
mathematical algorithms, AIs etc. are formed individuals
that manifest an intrinsic and identiﬁable intelligence
(GOI).

▶Preindividual boundaries arise due to the
non-uniformity of affective interactions within a
population of agents.
▶Information integration can be used to delineate
boundaries: the information integration of a set of
interacting agents is a relative measure of how
strongly their states have become mutually
correlated in comparison to their correlation with the
rest of the population.
▶Groups of agents that contingently affect each other
more strongly or frequently than they are affected by
the rest of the agents in the population, tend to clamp
together and form a boundary that distinguishes
them from the rest of the population (that becomes
their environment).

Fully formed individual identities
The consolidation of individual identities requires
interdependent closures between agents and recurrence
in their interactions:
Interdependent closure:
An identity is generated as a network of interdependent
agents become operationally closed. The conditions
necessary for the existence of each agent critically
depend on the interactions with other agents in the
network.
Recurrence:
For an identity to become stable, the state transitions and
interactions must become recurrent by that allowing the
continuity of the closure.

Feedback:

▶If agent A affects the behavior of agent B, but is not affected by the
modiﬁcations of behavior it has initiated, there is no real sense in
speaking about progressive resolution of incompatibility.
Recurrence:

is not given a priori.

Scalable recursive structure
▶The hierarchical relation of assemblages unfolds

▶Lower strata are populated by successively simpler
elements and higher strata are populated by
successively more complex elements so different
strata in the hierarchy are of a different scale of
complexity both in structure and dynamics.
▶There is no end, in principle, to the possible
expansion of Open-ended Intelligence via the
emergence of new strata of individuation.
▶The emergence of every new stratum is a phase
transition in sense-making. A new plane of
’sense-objects’ becomes available to cognition.
