Preface
THIS introductory textbook provides an overview of the broad fi eld of 
audiology, a clinical profession devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of 
communication disorders that result from hearing impairment. The aim 
of the book is to provide general familiarization with the many different 
assessment and treatment technologies and to demonstrate how these 
technologies are integrated into answering the many challenging clini-
cal questions facing an audiologist.
It is the intention of this book to introduce audiology as a clinical pro-
fession, to introduce the clinical questions and challenges that an au-
diologist faces, and to provide an overview of the various technologies 
that the audiologist can bring to bear on these questions and challenges. 
It is hoped that this type of approach will be of benefit to all students 
who might take an introductory course. For those students who will not 
pursue a career in audiology, the book will provide an understanding of 
the nature of hearing impairment, the challenges in its assessment and 
treatment, and an appreciation of the existing and emerging technolo-
gies related to hearing. For those who will be pursuing the profession, 
the book will also provide a basis for more advanced classes in each of 
the various areas, with the added advantage of a clinical perspective on 
why and how such information fi ts into the overall scheme of their pro-
fessional challenge.
Rather than writing another introductory textbook focused on rudimen-
tary details, I have attempted in this book to provide a big picture of the 
fi eld of audiology. My assumptions were: (1) that the basics of hearing 
and speech sciences are covered in other textbooks and in other classes; 
(2) that teaching a basic skill in one of the audiometries is not as use-
ful as a broader perspective; (3) that each of the topic areas in the book 
will be covered in signifi cant depth in advanced classes; and (4) that by 
introducing young students to the broad scope of the fi eld, they will be 
better prepared to understand the relevance of what they learn later. 

xx  PREFACE
For the nonaudiology major, this will promote an understanding of the 
clinical usefulness of audiology, without undue attention to the details 
of implementation.
In some of  the clinical areas, I have included clinical notes that give 
descriptions of particular techniques that the student might consider 
using. Knowing that there are as many ways to establish a speech thresh-
old as there are people teaching the technique, for example, I was reluc-
tant to burden the beginning student with arguments about the merits 
of the various methods. Rather, I used the notes to express an opinion 
about clinical strategies that I have used successfully. I would expect that 
the contrary opinions of a professor would serve as an excellent teach-
ing opportunity.
This publication is intended primarily for beginning-level students in the 
fi elds of audiology and speech-language pathology. It is intended for the 
fi rst major course in audiology, whether it be at the undergraduate or 
graduate level. Both intentions challenged the depth and scope of the 
content, and I can only hope that I reached an appropriate balance.
Ten years have passed since the fi rst edition of this textbook. Revising it 
gave me an inspiring view of the progress made in hearing health care 
over those years. When the book was fi rst written, the profession of au-
diology was just beginning its transition to the doctoral level. Newborn 
hearing screening had not yet been fully implemented, and we did not 
yet have clear insight into the diagnosis of auditory neuropathy and sim-
ilar disorders. All of that has changed. Advances on the treatment side 
have been even more stunning, from the dramatic changes in hearing 
aid technology to the remarkable impact of early cochlear implantation. 
I am impressed, as I look back, that the questions an audiologist faces 
have not really changed much over the years, but the ability to address 
those questions has changed substantially. I hope that the second edition 
conveys this progress effectively.

Acknowledgments
DR. JAMES JERGER has had the biggest single infl uence on my career. 
He has the best clinical mind that I have ever known. The historical per-
spective in Chapter 1 is his, and his infl uence permeates the remainder 
of the book.
Sadanand Singh and Jeff Danhauer talked me into this project a decade 
ago. I have always appreciated them for the opportunity and for their 
friendship.
I have worked with a number of remarkably talented clinicians, clinical 
supervisors, and professors in my career. Each has contributed in some 
way to the knowledge base necessary to write a textbook of this breadth. 
I am grateful to all of them.
Gus Mueller contributed substantially to the fi rst edition of this project 
by providing suggestions for the organization and content of the hear-
ing aid chapters. He tolerated a lot of questions for the second edition as 
well. I appreciate his insight and friendship.
I am also grateful to my colleagues at the Henry Ford Hospital who 
assisted in one way or another in the preparation of the second edition. 
Christine Paul, Adrianne Fazel, and Melanie Shelburg were particularly 
helpful in providing clinical perspective. Lynn Alvord and two groups of 
externs, including Elizabeth Gray, Tiffany Harvey, Allison Ivey, Jordan 
Kotrba, Mori Plackman, Virginia Ramachandran, Michelle Vogel, and 
Kate Wagner, tolerated numerous discussions of  the book’s content 
and covered for me whenever asked. The others, Patty Aldridge, Noreen 
Gibbens, Kristen Huizdos Graham, Nancy Maranto, Wendy Rizzo, Heidi 
Sedaros, and Karrie Slominski, were always generous in their support.
Virginia Ramachandran, a rather capable student at Wayne State 
University, wrote the learning objectives and study questions for each

chapter. She also provided invaluable insight about level and depth 
of  content from a student perspective. I am grateful to her for her 
willingness to help.
Delmar Cengage enlisted the help of fi ve reviewers to provide perspective 
on the second edition. Jackie Clark, Thomas Froelich, Elaine Mormer, 
Greg Noel, and Lauren Shaffer provided excellent reviews of the manu-
script. This book is a better one because of their thoughtful comments 
and suggestions.
A number of friends in industry were called upon to fi nd me pictures of 
equipment and hearing instruments. They did, and I appreciate their 
efforts.
Juliet Steiner at Delmar Cengage was responsible for the initial orchestra-
tion of the project. Her encouragement and patience were remarkable. 
Laura Wood aptly saw it to its completion.
Casey Stach contributed to this project in a number of ways. She gener-
ated the original margin notes, tried to update my knowledge about co-
chlear implants, and made innumerable suggestions that improved this 
textbook. She also provided the support necessary for completion of the 
project and understood its value, despite the considerable toll it took on 
early mornings, late evenings, and weekends. Thanks Casey.

2  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
Audiology is the health-care profession devoted to hearing. It 
is a clinical profession that has as its unique mission the evalua-
tion of hearing ability and the amelioration of impairment that 
results from hearing disorders. Most practitioners in the fi eld of 
audiology practice their profession in health-care settings or in 
private practice. Others practice in educational settings, rehabili-
tation settings, and industry. Regardless of setting, the mission 
of the audiologist is the prevention of hearing loss, diagnosis of 
hearing loss, and treatment of communication disorders that 
may result from hearing loss. Specifi cally, audiologists play a cru-
cial role in early identifi cation of hearing impairment in infants, 
evaluation of hearing ability in people of all ages, and assessment 
of  communication disorders that may result from hearing im-
pairment. In addition, audiologists evaluate the need for hearing 
devices and assess, fi t, and dispense hearing aids and other as-
sistive listening devices. Audiologists are also involved in postfi t-
ting treatment and in educational programming and facilitation. 
Many audiologists also carry out testing designed to quantify bal-
ance function.
Relative to many health professions, audiology is a young pro-
fession. Its roots took hold following World War II, when clinics 
were developed to test the hearing of soldiers returning from the 
front lines who developed hearing loss as a result of exposure to 
excessively loud sounds. In those days, audiologic services con-
sisted of measuring how much hearing impairment was present

language, or hearing 
disorder.

Physiologic refers to 
measuring the electrical 
activity of the brain 
and body.
The portion of the ear from 
the tympanic membrane (or 
eardrum) to the oval window 
is called the middle ear.
The inner ear contains the 
sensory organs of hearing.
The portion of the hearing 
mechanism from the 
auditory nerve to the 
auditory cortex is called the 
central auditory nervous 
system. 
and instruction in lipreading and auditory rehabilitation. Hearing 
aid technology was in its early stages of development. If we fast-
forward to today, the profession’s challenges remain the same, but 
its ability to meet them has changed dramatically.
Today, using physiologic techniques, audiologists screen the 
hearing of infants on their fi rst day of life. Today audiologists rou-
tinely assess middle ear function, inner ear function, and central 
auditory nervous system function with ever-evolving precision. 
Questions about hearing aid amplification now go well beyond 
that of yes or no. Audiologists can measure, with great precision, 
the amount of amplifi cation delivered to an eardrum. And they 
can alter that amplifi cation in a number of ways to tailor it to the 
degree and nature of an individual’s hearing loss.
But the main questions remain the same:
Does a hearing loss exist?
• 
What is the extent of the hearing loss?
• 
Is the loss causing impairment in communication ability?
• 
Can the impairment be overcome to some extent with hear-
• 
ing aid amplifi cation?
What are the amplifi cation needs of the patient?
• 
How can success with this amplifi cation be verifi ed?
• 
How much additional treatment is necessary?
• 
These questions form the basis for the profession of audiology. 
They encompass the issues that represent the unique purview of 
the profession.
WHAT IS AN AUDIOLOGIST?
An audiologist is a professional who, by virtue of academic de-
gree, clinical education, and appropriate licensure or other cre-
dential, is uniquely qualifi ed to provide a comprehensive array of 
professional services relating to the prevention of hearing loss and 
the audiologic identifi cation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients 
with impairments in hearing and balance function.

4  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
The audiologist may play a number of different roles: 
clinician,
• 
teacher,
• 
research investigator,
• 
administrator, and
• 
consultant. 
• 
The audiologist provides clinical and academic training in all aspects 
of hearing impairment and its treatment to students of audiology 
and personnel in medicine, nursing, and other related professions.
WHAT IS AN AUDIOLOGIST’S ROLE?
The central focus of audiology is auditory impairment and its re-
lationship to disordered communication. The audiologist identi-
fi es, assesses, diagnoses, and treats individuals with impairments 
of hearing and/or vestibular function. The audiologist also eval-
uates and fi ts hearing aids, and assists in the implementation of 
hearing loss treatment.
According to the American Academy of Audiology (AAA) 
Scope of  Practice, “An audiologist is a person who, by vir-
tue of  academic degree, clinical training, and license to practice 
and/or professional credential, is uniquely qualifi ed to provide 
a comprehensive array of  professional services related to the 
prevention of  hearing loss and the audiologic identification, 
assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of  persons with impair-
ment of  auditory and vestibular function, and to the prevention 
of  impairments associated with them.” 
According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing As-
sociation (ASHA) Scope of  Practice, “Audiologists are pro-
fessionals engaged in autonomous practice to promote healthy 
hearing, communication competency, and quality of  life for 
persons of  all ages through the prevention, identifi cation, as-
sessment, and rehabilitation of  hearing, auditory function, bal-
ance, and other  related systems.”
The vestibular system is 
a biological system that, in 
conjunction with vision and 
proprioception, functions 
to maintain balance and 
equilibrium.

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  5
Identification
The audiologist develops and oversees hearing screening pro-
grams designed to detect hearing loss in patients. Although iden-
tifi cation programs are used in patients of all ages, they are most 
commonly used to identify hearing loss in infants, children enter-
ing school, and in aging patients. An audiologist may also screen 
for speech and language disorders to identify and refer patients 
with other communication disorders.
Assessment and Diagnosis
The audiologist serves as the primary expert in the assessment 
and audiologic diagnosis of auditory impairment. Assessment in-
cludes, but is not limited to, the administration and interpretation 
of behavioral, electroacoustic, and electrophysiologic measures 
of the status of the peripheral and central auditory nervous sys-
tems. Evaluation typically involves assessment of both the type of 
hearing loss and the extent or degree of hearing loss. The evalu-
ation process reveals whether a hearing loss is of a type that can 
be medically treated with surgery or drugs or of a more perma-
nent type that can be treated with personal amplifi cation. Once 
the nature of the loss is determined, the extent of the impairment 
is evaluated in terms of both hearing sensitivity and the ability 
to use hearing for the perception of speech. Results of this evalu-
ation are then placed into the context of the patient’s lifestyle and 
communication demands to determine the extent to which a loss 
of hearing has become an impairment and might impact commu-
nication function.
Assessment of the vestibular system includes administration and 
interpretation of behavioral and electrophysiologic tests of bal-
ance function.
Treatment
Academic preparation and clinical experience qualify the audi-
ologist to provide a full range of auditory treatment services to 
patients of all ages. Treatment services include those relating to 
hearing aids, cochlear implants, audiologic rehabilitation, ceru-
men removal, and tinnitus management.
Behavioral measures 
pertain to the observation 
of the activity of a person in 
response to some stimuli.
Nerve endings in the inner 
ear and the VIIIth nerve 
constitute the peripheral 
auditory nervous 
system.
Hearing sensitivity is the 
ability of the ear to detect 
faint sound.
A cochlear implant is 
a device that is implanted 
in the inner ear to provide 
hearing for individuals with 
profound deafness.

6  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
The audiologist is the primary individual responsible for the eval-
uation and fi tting of all types of amplifi cation devices, including 
hearing aids and assistive listening devices. The audiologist de-
termines whether the patient is a suitable candidate for amplifi -
cation devices, evaluates the benefi t that the patient may expect 
to derive, and recommends an appropriate system to the patient. 
In conjunction with these recommendations, the audiologist will 
take ear impressions, fi t the hearing-aid devices, provide counsel-
ing regarding their use, dispense the devices, and monitor prog-
ress with the hearing aids.
The audiologist is also the primary individual responsible for the 
audiologic evaluation of candidates for cochlear implants. Co-
chlear implants provide direct electrical stimulation to the in-
ner ear of hearing, or the cochlea, and to the neural system of 
hearing. They are used for individuals with severe-to-profound 
hearing loss. Prior to implant surgery, the audiologist carries out 
audiologic testing to determine patient candidacy and provides 
counseling to the candidate and family members about appro-
priateness of implantation and viability of other amplification 
options. After implant surgery, the audiologist is responsible for 
programming implant devices, providing auditory training and 
other treatment services, troubleshooting and maintaining im-
plant hardware, and counseling implant users, their families, and 
other professionals such as teachers.
The audiologist also provides treatment services and education to 
individuals with hearing impairment, family members, and the 
public. The audiologist provides information pertaining to hear-
ing and hearing loss, the use of prosthetic devices, and strategies 
for improving speech recognition by exploiting auditory, visual, 
and tactile avenues for information processing. The audiologist 
also counsels patients regarding the effects of auditory disorder 
on communicative and psychosocial status in the personal, social, 
and vocational arenas.
In addition, the audiologist may be involved in the treatment of 
patients with vestibular disorders as a participant in a balance-
treatment team that recommends and carries out treatment and 
rehabilitation of impairments of vestibular function.
The portion of the inner ear 
that consists of a ﬂ uid-ﬁ lled 
shell-like structure is called 
the cochlea.
A neural system is a 
system containing nerve 
cells, in this case the VIIIth 
cranial nerve or auditory 
nerve.
A hearing loss of 70 dB HL or 
greater, typically considered 
deaf, is called a severe-to-
profound hearing loss.
Auditory training is 
a rehabilitation method 
designed to train people to 
use their remaining hearing.
A device that assists or 
replaces a missing or 
dysfunctional system is 
called a prosthetic device.

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  7
Education
Audiologists may provide clinical and academic education in 
audiology. Audiologists teach audiology students, physicians, 
medical students, medical residents, fellows, and other stu-
dents about the auditory and vestibular systems and their dis-
orders. They may also be involved in educating the public, the 
business community, and related industries about hearing and 
balance, hearing loss and disability, prevention of hearing loss, 
and treatment strategies, particularly those pertaining to hear-
ing aids and other assistive devices. In the field often referred 
to as forensic audiology, audiologists may also serve as expert 
witnesses in court cases, which usually involve issues pertain-
ing to the nature and extent of  hearing loss caused by some 
compensable action.
Audiologists involved in educational settings administer screen-
ing and evaluative programs in schools to identify hearing impair-
ment and ensure that all students receive appropriate follow-up 
and referral services. The audiologist also trains and supervises 
nonaudiologists who perform hearing screening in educational 
settings. The audiologist serves as the resource for school per-
sonnel in matters pertaining to classroom acoustics, assistive lis-
tening systems, and communicative strategies. The audiologist 
maintains both classroom assistive systems and personal hearing 
devices. The audiologist serves on the team that makes decisions 
concerning an individual child’s educational setting and special 
requirements. The audiologist also participates actively in the 
management of all children with hearing disorders of all varieties 
in the educational setting.
Prevention
The audiologist designs, implements, and coordinates industrial 
and military hearing conservation programs in an effort to pre-
vent hearing loss that may occur from exposure to excessively 
loud noises. These programs include identification and amelio-
ration of hazardous noise conditions, identification of hearing 
loss, employee education, fi tting personal hearing protection, and 
training and supervision of nonaudiologists performing hearing 
screening in the industrial setting.
Referral means to direct 
someone for additional 
services.

8  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
Multimodality sensory 
evoked potentials is 
a collective term used to 
describe the measurement of 
electrical activity of the ears, 
eyes, and other systems of 
the body.
Research
The audiologist may be actively involved in the design, implemen-
tation, and measurement of the effectiveness of clinical research 
activity relating to hearing loss assessment and treatment.
Related Activities
Some audiologists, by virtue of employment setting, education, 
experience, and personal choice, may engage in other health-care 
activities related to the profession. For example, some audiologists 
practice in hospital operating rooms, where multimodality sensory 
evoked potentials are used to monitor the function of sensory sys-
tems during surgery.  In such settings, an audiologist administers 
and interprets electrophysiologic measures of the integrity of sen-
sory and motor neural function, typically during neurosurgery.
Scope of Practice
It is incumbent on all professions to defi ne their boundaries. They 
must delineate the professional activities that lie within their 
education and training and, by exclusion, the activities outside 
their territory. Two examples of the audiology scope of practice, 
one from the American Academy of  Audiology and the other 
from the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, are 
included in Appendix A.
It is important to understand scope of practice issues. Audiology is 
an autonomous profession. As long as audiologists are practicing 
within their boundaries, they are acting as experts in their fi eld. 
Decisions about diagnostic approaches and about hearing aids 
and other treatment strategies are theirs to make. A patient with 
a hearing loss can choose to enter the health-care door through 
the audiologist, without referral from a physician or other health-
care provider. This is a very important responsibility to have and 
to uphold. Audiologists should be very familiar with their scope of 
practice along with their code of ethics.
Defi ning the scope of practice for any profession remains a fairly 
dynamic process. Not so very long ago, in the 1970s, offi cial scope 
of practice guidelines for the profession of audiology did not delin-
eate the dispensing of hearing aids as being within the scope of 
Approximately 85% of all 
audiologists today in the U.S. 
dispense hearing aids.

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  9
Cerumen is earwax, 
the waxy secretion in the 
external ear canal. When it 
accumulates, it can become 
impacted and block the 
external ear canal.
An ear impression is a cast 
made of the ear and ear canal 
for creating a customized 
earplug or hearing aid.
Otoscopic pertains to an 
otoscope. An otoscope 
is an instrument used to 
visually examine the ear 
canal and eardrum.
Electronystagmography 
measures eye movements to 
assess vestibular (balance) 
function.
An auditory brainstem 
response is an 
electrophysiologic response 
to sound, consisting of ﬁ ve to 
seven identiﬁ able peaks that 
represent neural function of 
auditory pathways.
The VIIIth cranial nerve 
refers to the auditory and 
vestibular nerves.
Neurology is the medical 
specialty that deals with the 
nervous system.
Neurosurgery is the 
medical specialty that deals 
with operating on disorders 
of the nervous system.
Otolaryngology is the 
medical specialty that deals 
with the ear, nose, and throat.
Techniques used to view 
the structures of the body 
through X-rays are called 
radiographic techniques.
the profession. Because the dispensing of hearing aids was such a 
natural extension of the central theme of the profession, audiolo-
gists began expanding their practices into this area as a routine 
matter of course. Soon, it became a common part of professional 
practice, and today dispensing hearing aids is considered an inte-
gral part of an audiologist’s responsibilities.
Professional practices have also expanded in other ways. One 
example of an expanding activity is in the area of ear canal in-
spection and cerumen management. In order to evaluate hear-
ing, make ear impressions, and fi t hearing protection devices and 
hearing aids, the ear canals of patients need to be relatively free of 
debris and excessive cerumen. Otoscopic examination and exter-
nal ear canal management for cerumen removal have become a 
routine part of many audiologists’ practices.
 Another example is in the assessment of vestibular function. The 
most common type of testing is called electronystagmography, 
or ENG. Today, ENG testing is commonplace in audiology offi ces 
and is considered an integral part of the scope of practice.
A further example of expanding roles is in the area of auditory 
electrophysiology. Since the late 1970s, audiologists have used 
what are termed electrophysiologic procedures to estimate hear-
ing ability in infants and other patients who could not cooperate 
with behavioral testing strategies. The main electrophysiologic 
procedure is termed the auditory brainstem response, or ABR. 
This technique measures electrical activity of  the brain in re-
sponse to sound and provides an objective assessment of hearing 
ability. Audiologists have embraced this technology as an excel-
lent means of helping them to assess hearing ability. But the ABR 
is useful for something else as well. It provides an exquisite means 
for evaluating the functional integrity of the neural elements of 
the VIIIth cranial nerve and the auditory brainstem. Thus, it is a 
technique that is very useful to the medical professions that diag-
nose and treat brain disease, such as neurology, neurosurgery, 
and otolaryngology. Although imaging and radiographic 
techniques have supplanted the ABR in diagnosis, the use of ABR 
as a screening tool for neurologic diagnostic purposes remains in 
widespread use.

10  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
Multisensory modality 
means incorporating the 
auditory, visual, and tactile 
senses.
Screening the hearing of 
an infant during the ﬁ rst 
4 weeks of life is called 
newborn hearing 
screening. 
Another direction that audiologists have taken is in the area of 
multisensory modality monitoring in the operating room. This 
practice was an extension of the use of ABR for assisting in the 
diagnosis of neurologic impairment. Because the ABR is useful for 
evaluating function of the VIIIth cranial nerve and the auditory 
brainstem, surgeons found that, if they monitored function of the 
VIIIth nerve and other nerves during surgery for removal of a tu-
mor on that nerve, they could often preserve the nerve’s function. 
Because audiologists know how to use the equipment and because 
of their technical expertise, often they are asked to participate in 
the surgical monitoring of patients undergoing tumor removal.
What, then, is the scope of practice of audiology? Audiologists are 
uniquely qualifi ed to evaluate hearing and hearing impairment 
and to ameliorate communication disorders that result from that 
impairment. To do this, audiologists may be involved in:
hearing loss prevention programs,
• 
newborn hearing screening
• 
,
ear canal inspection and cleaning,
• 
pediatric and adult assessment of hearing,
• 
determination of hearing impairment, disability, or 
• 
handicap,
fi tting of hearing aids,
• 
audiologic rehabilitation, and
• 
educational programming.
• 
In addition, some audiologists engage in other activities, includ-
ing evaluation and rehabilitation of vestibular disorders and oper-
ating room monitoring of multisensory evoked potentials.
WHERE DO AUDIOLOGISTS PRACTICE?
Audiologists practice their profession in a number of different set-
tings. The largest growth area over the past two decades has been 
in the area of private practice and other non-residential health-
care facilities. Because audiology is primarily a health-care pro-
fession, most audiologists practice in health-care settings. An 
estimate of the distribution of settings is shown in Figure 1-1. 

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  11
Over half of all audiologists work in some type of non-residential 
health-care facility, such as a private clinic, a community speech 
and hearing center, or a physician’s practice. Over 20% of audi-
ologists work in a clinic or medical center facility, and about 5% 
of audiologists work in a school setting. The remaining 20% of 
audiologists work in university settings, government health-care 
facilities, and industry.
With regard to primary employment function, most audiologists, 
nearly 80%, are clinical service providers, regardless of employ-
ment setting. Nearly 10% are involved primarily in administra-
tion, and about 5% are college or university professors. The 
remaining audiologists serve as researchers, consultants, and in 
other related capacities. Thus, a typical audiologist would provide 
clinical services in a private practice, hospital, or other health-
care facility.
Private Practice
Nearly 40% of all audiologists have some type of private practice 
arrangement. Of those, over 60% are in private practice on a full-
time basis; the rest have a part-time practice, typically as a supple-
ment to their primary employment.

practice. (Data source: American Academy of Audiology, 2005.)

12  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
Private-practice arrangements take on a number of forms. Some 
audiologists have their own stand-alone offices. The offices are 
often located in commercial offi ce space that is oriented to out-
patient health care. In other instances, the offi ces are located in 
retail shopping space to provide convenient access for patients. 
Some private practices are located adjacent to or within prac-
tices of related health-care professionals. For example, some au-
diologists have practices in conjunction with speech-language 
pathologists. More often, though, audiologists have practices in 
conjunction with otolaryngologists. This type of  arrangement 
is of practical value in that some patients who have hearing im-
pairment for which they would visit an audiologist also have ear 
disease for which they would visit an otolaryngologist, and vice 
versa. Thus, offi ces that are in close proximity allow for easy and 
convenient referrals and continuity of care.
Audiologists in private practices typically provide a wide range of 
services, from diagnostic audiology to the fi tting and dispensing 
of hearing aids. If there is an emphasis for private practitioners, 
it is usually on the treatment rather than the diagnostic side, al-
though that may vary depending on the location of the practice. 
Private practices may serve as the entry point for a patient into 
the health-care system, or they may serve as consultative services 
after the patient has entered the system through a primary-care 
physician or a specialist. Audiologists in private practice, then, 
work closely with gerontologists, pediatricians, family-practice 
physicians, and otolaryngologists to assure good referral relation-
ships and good lines of communication. Audiologists in private 
practice also provide contract services to hospitals, clinics, school 
systems, nursing homes, retirement centers, and physicians’ of-
fices. Services that are contracted range from specialty testing, 
such as infant hearing screening in a hospital intensive care nurs-
ery, to hearing screening of children in school or preschool set-
tings. Some private practitioners also contract with industry to 
provide screening and testing of individuals who are exposed to 
potentially damaging levels of noise.
The challenges and risks associated with private practice are often 
high, but so are the rewards. Private practices are small businesses 
that carry all of  the responsibilities and challenges associated 
with small-business ownership. Sound business practices related

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  13
to cash management, personnel management, accounting, mar-
keting, advertising, and so on are all essential to the success of a 
private practice. Successful private practices are usually more fi -
nancially rewarding than other types of practices. But if you talk 
with audiologists in private practice, you will learn that perhaps 
the greatest rewards are related to being an autonomous practi-
tioner, without the institutional and other constraints related to 
working for hospitals or physicians’ practices.
Also emerging are group practices that represent a different type 
of private-sector practice. Group practices may be local in nature, 
made up of a network of independent practitioners, or they may 
be regional or national, owned by corporations. The former usu-
ally exist for providing coverage for third-party contracting and 
to enhance purchasing power for buying hearing aids. The lat-
ter resemble “chains” or “franchises,” and are usually focused on 
hearing aid dispensing. This corporate structure takes advantage 
of group marketing and purchasing and is a growing infl uence in 
the distribution of hearing aids.
Physician’s Practices
Many audiologists are employed by physicians, predominantly oto-
laryngologists, to provide audiologic services. Audiologists work-
ing in physicians’ offices can be private practitioners, but more 
often are employees of the corporation. Physicians’ offi ces range 
in size considerably, and audiology practices can vary from single 
audiologist arrangements to audiology-clinic arrangements.
Audiologic services provided within a physician’s practice are 
usually strongly oriented to the diagnostic side of the profession. 
This relates to the nature of medical practices as the entry point 
for all types of disorders, including both ear disease and commu-
nication complaints. In many cases, however, hearing aid ser-
vices are included as a means of maintaining continuity of care 
for patients.
Audiologists providing services in physicians’ practices are usu-
ally compensated on a salaried basis. Some practices also provide 
incentives based on performance of the overall practice or perfor-
mance of the audiologic aspects of the practice.

Chemotherapy refers to 
treating a disease, such as 
cancer, with chemicals or 
drugs.
The hospital unit designed 
to take care of newborns 
needing special care is the

The hospital unit designed 
to take care of normal 
newborns is called the 
regular-care nursery.
The facial nerve is the 
VIIth cranial nerve.
The vestibular nerve is 
part of the VIIIth cranial 
nerve.
Hospitals and Medical Centers
Approximately one quarter of all audiologists work in a clinic, 
hospital, or medical center facility. Of those in hospital settings, 
most (70%) work in general medical hospitals; the remainder 
work in rehabilitation hospitals or other specialized facilities. 
Within a hospital or medical center structure, audiology services 
can stand alone as their own administrative entities or can fall un-
der the auspices of a more general medical department, typically 
otolaryngology or surgery. Audiologists may be employees of the 
hospital or, in the case of a medical center, may be faculty mem-
bers of a medical school department and part of a medical group, 
participating in a professional practice plan.
Audiologic activities in a hospital facility can be nearly as broad 
as the fi eld. Because of the nature of the setting, emphasis in most 
hospitals is on the diagnostic side of the profession. Audiologists 
evaluate the hearing of patients who have complaints such as 
hearing impairment, ear disease, ear pain, and dizziness. They 
also evaluate patients who are undergoing chemotherapy that 
is potentially toxic to the auditory system. Most hospital settings 
also provide in-depth electroacoustic, electro-physiologic, and be-
havioral assessment of infants and children. In many hospitals, 
audiologists are also responsible for carrying out or directing the 
hearing screening of newborns in intensive care nurseries or 
regular-care nurseries.
Audiologists also provide a number of services related to assisting 
physicians in the diagnosis of ear disease and neurologic disorder. 
In addition, some audiologists monitor auditory or other sensory 
function during surgery. An example of this is the electrophysi-
ologic monitoring of auditory nerve and facial nerve function 
during surgical removal of a tumor that impinges on the auditory 
and vestibular nerves.
Although the major emphasis is diagnostic, many hospital set-
tings provide hearing-device services as well. It is not uncommon 
for audiologists to dispense hearing aids either through the hos-
pital or through a for-profit practice within a hospital setting. 
Many hospital and medical center facilities serve as the centers for 
cochlear-implant evaluation, surgery, and device programming. 
A for-proﬁ t practice is a 
privately owned commercial 
business.

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  15
For patients of all ages, audiologists have the primary role in de-
termining implant candidacy and in programming the implant 
device as a fi rst step in the rehabilitative process.
Audiologists in these settings are also involved in the develop-
ment and implementation of  outreach programs so that pa-
tients who receive diagnostic and hearing aid services can be 
referred appropriately for any necessary rehabilitative services. 
Most outreach networks include local educational audiologists, 
schools for the deaf, vocational rehabilitation counselors, and 
self-help groups.
Hearing and Speech Clinics
In the 1950s and 1960s, a number of prestigious speech and hear-
ing centers were developed and built that provided a wide range 
of communication services to their communities. These centers 
were often associated with universities, and many were partially 
supported with funding from organizations such as Easter Seals or 
the United Way. Clinics such as these remain today, and audiologic 
practices are usually broadly based and include a full range of diag-
nostic and treatment activities. If there is an emphasis, it is usually 
on the rehabilitative side. One common strength of such a setting is 
a commitment to the team approach to evaluation and treatment. 
This is particularly important for children who have both hearing 
and speech-language disorders. Approximately 6% of audiologists 
work in a speech and hearing clinic.
Schools
Over 5% of audiologists work in an educational setting. In most 
cases, educational audiologists work in public schools at the 
primary-grade level. Some also work at the preschool level. 
Responsibilities of the educational audiologist are not unlike those 
of  audiologists in general, except that they are oriented more 
toward a consultative role in assuring optimal access to education 
by students with hearing impairment.
Educational audiologists’ roles in the schools range from the actual 
provision to the overall coordination of services. For example, in 
some settings the educational audiologist may be responsible for 
diagnostic audiology services, whereas in others the audiologist is 

16  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
responsible for ensuring that those services are adequately  provided 
through resources within the community.
The role of educational audiologists usually begins with oversight 
of hearing screening programs, which are commonplace in school 
settings. The role extends to the provision of diagnostic audiologic 
services to children who have failed the screening or, on an an-
nual basis, to those who have been identifi ed with hearing impair-
ment. Educational audiologists are also responsible for ensuring 
that  students have proper amplifi cation devices and that those 
devices are functioning appropriately in the classroom. One ma-
jor role of an educational audiologist is the education of school 
personnel about:
the nature of hearing impairment,
• 
the effects of hearing impairment on learning,
• 
the effects of room acoustics on auditory perception,
• 
the way that amplifi cation devices work, and
• 
the fundamentals of hearing device troubleshooting.
• 
Audiologists who work in educational settings serve as advocates 
for students with hearing impairment and are involved in deci-
sions about appropriate classroom placement and the necessity 
for itinerant assistance.
Universities
Eight percent of audiologists are employed in university settings, 
either as professors of audiology or clinical educators. Many audi-
ology faculty members have teaching and research as their main 
responsibilities. Their primary roles are:
the graduate-level education of audiology students,
• 
the procurement and maintenance of grant funds,
• 
the provision of audiologic research, and
• 
community education and outreach.
• 
Other faculty members have as their primary role the clinical 
 education of students in the university clinical setting. It is usually 
these individuals who provide students with their fi rst exposure to 
the clinical activities that constitute their future profession.

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  17
Hearing Instrument Manufacturers
Some audiologists work for manufacturers of hearing devices or 
audiometric equipment. They tend to work in one of two areas: 
research and development; or professional education and sales. 
Those who work in research and development are responsible for 
assisting engineers and designers in the development of products 
for use in hearing diagnosis or treatment. They bring to the devel-
opmental process the expertise in clinical matters that is so criti-
cal to the design of instrumentation and hearing devices. Those 
who work in professional education and sales typically represent 
a single manufacturer and are responsible for educating clini-
cal audiologists in the types of devices available, new technolo-
gies that have been developed, and new devices that have been 
brought to market.

conservation is the area 
of audiology devoted to 
protecting the ears from 
hearing loss due to exposure 
to noise in the workplace.
An individual hired on an 
hourly or contract basis for 
expertise in a profession is 
called a consultant.
The role of audiologists in this area has been expanding over the 
past few decades. Audiologists bring to the design and manufac-
turing process an understanding of the needs of both clinical au-
diologists and patients with hearing impairment. This has greatly 
enhanced the applicability of instruments and devices to the clini-
cal setting. In addition, the complexity and sophistication of hear-
ing instruments have grown dramatically over the years, and the 
need for professional education has grown accordingly. As a re-
sult, manufacturers’ representatives provide important continu-
ing education to audiology practitioners.
Industry
Audiologists often play an important role in what is known as 
 industrial hearing conservation. Exposure to noise in job settings 
is pervasive. According to the National Institute for Occupational 
Safety and Health, as many as 30 million workers in the United 
States are exposed to hazardous levels of noise. As a result, oc-
cupational safety and health standards have been developed to 
protect workers from noise exposure, and audiologists are often 
involved in assisting industry in meeting those standards. Audi-
ologists’ roles in hearing conservation include:
assessment of noise exposure,
• 
provision or supervision of baseline and annual audiometric 
• 
assessment,
provision of appropriate follow-up services,
• 
recommendations about appropriate noise protection 
• 
devices,
fi tting hearing protection, and
• 
employee education about noise exposure and hearing loss 
• 
prevention.
Audiologists also work with industry personnel to devise methods 
for engineering or administrative controls over noise exposure.
The majority of  audiologists who work in industry do so on a 
consultative basis. Some audiologists contract to provide a full 
range of services to a particular company. Others contract only 
to provide hearing-test review or follow-up audiologic services. 
Regardless, hearing conservation is a very important aspect of

comprehensive hearing health care, and audiologists often play a 
major role in the provision of these services.
RELATION TO OTHER PROFESSIONS
As broadly based health-care professionals diagnosing and treat-
ing hearing impairment, audiologists come into contact with 
many other professionals on a daily basis. Much of their work in 
assessment involves referrals from and to physicians in various 
specialties and other health-care professions. Much of the work 
in treatment involves referrals from and to social services, edu-
cational personnel, and other professionals involved in outreach 
programs. The following is an overview of the professions that are 
most closely related to audiology.
Otolaryngology
Otolaryngology, or otorhinolaryngology, is the medical specialty 
devoted to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the ear, nose, 
and throat. The focus of the profession has evolved over the years, 
and now it is routinely referred to as otolaryngology—head and neck 
surgery, which is a title that accurately refl ects the current em-
phasis of the specialty. Physicians who are otolaryngologists have 
completed medical school and at least a four- or fi ve-year residency 
in the specialty. The residency program usually includes a year or 
two in general surgery, followed by an emphasis on surgery of the 
head and neck. One subspecialty of otolaryngology is otology.
Otology is the subspecialty devoted to the diagnosis and treat-
ment of ear disease. In contrast, audiology is the profession de-
voted to the diagnosis and treatment of communication disorders 
that results from hearing loss. Although the roles are clearly de-
fi ned, the overlap between the professions in daily practice can be 
substantial. As a result, the two professions are closely aligned.
The relationship between audiology and otology is perhaps best 
defi ned by considering the route that patients might take if they 
have hearing problems. If a patient has a complaint of hearing 
impairment, that patient is likely to seek guidance from a general 
medical practitioner, who is likely to refer the patient to either an 
audiologist or an otologist. If the general practitioner does not

Approximately 5–10% of 
individuals with hearing 
impairment have treatable 
medical conditions.
detect any ear disease, the patient is likely to be referred to the au-
diologist, who will evaluate the hearing of the patient in an effort 
to determine the need for treatment. The audiologist’s fi rst ques-
tion is whether or not the hearing loss is of a nature that might 
be treatable medically. If any suspicion of ear disease is detected, 
the audiologist will recommend to the general practitioner that 
the patient receive an otologic consultation to rule out a treatable 
condition. If the general practitioner detects the presence of ear 
disease at the initial consult, the patient is likely to be referred fi rst 
to the otologist, who will diagnose the problem and implement 
treatment as necessary. As part of the otologic assessment, the 
otologist may consult the audiologist to determine if the medical 
condition is resulting in a hearing loss and if that hearing loss is 
of a medically treatable nature. If ear disease is present, the otolo-
gist will treat it with appropriate drugs or surgery. The audiologist 
may be involved in quantifying hearing ability before and after 
treatment. If ear disease is not present, the otologist will consult 
with the audiologist to determine the extent of hearing impair-
ment and the prognosis for successful hearing aid use.
From these examples, it is easy to see how the professions of audi-
ology and otology are closely related. Many patients with ear disease 
have hearing impairment, at least until the ear disease is treated. 
Thus, otologists will diagnose and treat the ear disease. They will 
consult with audiologists to evaluate the extent to which that ear 
disease affects hearing and the extent to which their treatment 
has eliminated any hearing problem. Conversely, many patients 
with hearing impairment have ear disease. Estimates suggest that 
as many as 5–10% of individuals with hearing impairment have 
treatable medical conditions of the ear. Thus, the medical profes-
sion of otology and the hearing profession of audiology are often 
called on to evaluate the same patients.
Understanding the unique contributions of the two professions is 
important in defi ning territories and roles in the assessment and 
treatment of patients with hearing impairment. Overlap of roles 
can occur in some patients with hearing loss complaints. For ex-
ample, audiologists call on otologists to rule out or treat active ear 
disease in patients with hearing impairment. Once completed, the 
audiologists can continue their assessment and treatment of any 

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  21
residual auditory communication disorder that may be present. 
Similarly, otologists call on audiologists to provide pre- and post-
treatment assessment of hearing sensitivity in patients with ear 
disease. Thus, the two disciplines work together to help patients 
who have complaints related to ears or hearing.
Other Medical Specialties
Audiologists also work closely with other medical specialists who 
treat patients at risk for hearing impairment. These specialties 
include:
pediatrics,
• 
neonatology,
• 
neurology,
• 
neurosurgery,
• 
oncology,
• 
infectious diseases,
• 
medical genetics,
• 
community and family medicine, and
• 
gerontology.
• 
Many infants in intensive-care nurseries are at risk for signifi-
cant hearing impairment. As a result, audiologists work closely 
with neonatologists to provide or oversee hearing screening and 
 follow-up hearing assessment of infants who might be at risk. 
Screening efforts have been extended to regular-care nurseries, and 
audiologists work closely with all medical personnel who have the 
nursery as part of their professional territory. As children get older, 
their pediatricians are among the fi rst professionals consulted by 
parents if a hearing problem is suspected. As a result, audiologists 
often have close referral relationships with pediatricians.
Patients with neurologic disorders sometimes have hearing 
 impairment as a result. Tumors, cerebrovascular accidents, or 
trauma to the central nervous system can affect the central audi-
tory system in ways that result in hearing and balance problems. 
Audiologists may be called on by neurologists or neurosurgeons to 
assist in diagnosis, monitor cranial nerve function during  surgery, 
or manage residual communication disorders.
A neonatologist is a 
physician specializing in the 
care of newborns.
A tumor is an abnormal 
growth of tissue, which 
can occur on or around the 
auditory nerve.
A cerebrovascular 
accident (CVA) is an 
interruption of the blood 
supply to the brain resulting 
in a loss of function, a stroke 
for example.

22  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
An oncologist is a 
physician specializing in the 
treatment of cancer.
When a substance is 
poisonous to the ear, it is 
ototoxic.
Audiologists also work closely with oncologists and specialists in 
infectious diseases to monitor hearing and balance functions in 
patients undergoing certain types of drug therapies. Some che-
motherapy drugs and antibiotics are toxic to the auditory system, 
or ototoxic. Ingestion of high doses of these drugs may result in 
permanent damage to the hearing mechanism. Sometimes this is 
an inevitable consequence of saving someone’s life. Drugs used to 
treat cancer or serious infections may need to be administered in 
doses that will harm the hearing mechanism. But in many cases, 
the dosage can be adjusted to remain effective in its purpose with-
out causing ototoxicity. Patients undergoing such treatment will 
often be referred to the audiologist for monitoring of  hearing 
function throughout the treatment.
Audiologists also work closely with primary-care physicians and 
those specializing in aging, the gerontologists. One pervasive 
consequence of the aging process is a loss in hearing sensitivity. 
Estimates of prevalence suggest that over 20% of all individuals 
over the age of  65 years have at least some degree of  hearing 
impairment, and the prevalence increases with increasing 
age. Primary-care physicians are often the first professionals 
consulted by patients who have hearing impairment. As a result, 
audiologists often develop close referral relations with physicians 
who work with aging individuals.
Speech-Language Pathology
Audiology and speech-language pathology evolved from the disci-
pline of communication disorders and were considered to be one 
profession in the early years. This evolved from the educational 
model in which one individual would be responsible for hearing, 
speech, and language assessment and treatment in school-age 
children. Some professionals are actually certifi ed and licensed in 
both audiology and speech-language pathology. Today, although 
some overlap remains, the two areas have evolved into separate 
and independent professions. Nevertheless, because of historical 
ties and because of a common discipline of communication disor-
ders, the two professions remain linked.
The unique role of speech-language pathology is the evaluation and 
rehabilitation of communication disorders that result from speech 

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  23
A speech-language 
pathologist is a 
professional who diagnoses 
and treats speech and 
language disorders.
A disorder of the central 
auditory structures, which 
can result in difﬁ culty 
understanding speech in the 
presence of noise, is called 
an auditory processing 
disorder (APD). 
A stroke is a

and/or language impairment. Speech-language pathologists are 
responsible for evaluation of disorders in:
articulation,
• 
voice and resonance,
• 
fl uency,
• 
language,
• 
phonology,
• 
pragmatics,
• 
augmentative/alternative communication,
• 
cognition, and
• 
swallowing
• 
in patients of all ages. Following assessment, speech-language pa-
thologists design and implement treatment programs for individu-
als with impairments in any of these various areas.
There are at least three groups of patients with whom audiolo-
gists and speech-language pathologists work closely together. 
First, because good speech and oral-language development re-
quires good hearing, auditory disorders in children often result 
in speech and/or language developmental delays. Thus, children 
with hearing impairment are usually referred to speech-language 
pathologists for speech and language assessment and treatment 
following hearing aid fi tting. Second, some children have auditory 
perceptual problems as a consequence of impaired central audi-
tory nervous systems. These problems result, most importantly, in 
diffi culty discerning speech in a background of noise. The prob-
lem is usually referred to as auditory processing disorder (APD). 
Many children with APD have concomitant receptive language 
processing problems, learning disabilities, and attention defi cits. 
As a result, adequate diagnosis of APD usually requires a multi-
disciplinary assessment. Third, many older individuals who have 
language disorders due to stroke or other neurologic insult also 
have some degree of hearing sensitivity loss or auditory process-
ing problem. The audiologist and speech-language pathologist 
work together in such instances in an effort to determine the 
 extent to which hearing impairment is impacting on receptive 
language ability.

24  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
The American Speech-
Language-Hearing 
Association (ASHA) was 
founded in 1925. The original 
name of the Association 
(used from 1927–1929) 
was the American Academy 
of Speech Correction. The 
25 charter members were 
primarily university faculty 
members in Iowa and 
Wisconsin. The primary 
professional focus of 
the Association was on 
stuttering.
With these exceptions, the majority of  individuals who have 
 hearing impairment do not have speech and language disorders. 
Similarly, the majority of individuals who have speech and lan-
guage disorders do not have hearing impairment. Nevertheless, 
professionals in both audiology and speech-language pathology 
understand the interdependence of  hearing, speech, and lan-
guage. Thus, during audiologic evaluations, particularly in chil-
dren, it is important to include an informal screening of speech 
and language. During speech-language evaluations, it is impor-
tant to include a screening of hearing sensitivity.
Nonaudiologist Hearing Aid Dispensers
Prior to 1977, it was against the Code of Ethics of the American 
Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) for audiologists 
to dispense hearing aids. At the time, hearing aids were dispensed 
mostly by hearing aid dispensers. Nonaudiologist hearing aid dis-
pensers are individuals who dispense hearing aids as their main 
focus. Most states have developed licensure regulation of hearing 
aid dispensers, and requirements vary signifi cantly across states.
In the 1970s, audiologists began assuming a greater role in hear-
ing aid dispensing. By the 1990s, audiologists who were licensed 
to dispense hearing aids outnumbered hearing aid dispensers in 
many states. Most individuals wishing to dispense hearing aids 
as a career now pursue the profession of audiology as the entry 
point. Nevertheless, there remain many individuals who began 
dispensing hearing aids before these trends were pervasive.
Although the number of  traditional hearing aid dispensers is 
 diminishing in proportion to the number of dispensing audiolo-
gists, there is considerable overlap in territory. In many settings, 
audiologists and hearing aid dispensers work together in an effort 
to provide comprehensive hearing treatment services.
Other Professionals
Audiologists work with many other professionals to ensure that 
patients with hearing impairment are well served. For children, 
audiologists often work with educational diagnosticians, 
neuropsychologists, and teachers to assure complete assessment for 
educational placement. Audiologists also refer parents of children 
with hearing impairment to geneticists for counseling regarding

professional specializing

hereditary diseases. 
possible familial causes of hearing loss. Family counselors, whether 
social workers, psychologists, or other professionals, are often 
called on to assist families of children with hearing impairment. 
For adults with hearing impairment, referrals are often made to 
professionals for counseling about vocational or emotional needs 
related to the hearing loss.
THE EVOLUTION OF AUDIOLOGY
Audiology has evolved over the last 50 years clinically, academically, 
and professionally. The professional evolution has changed the 
practice of audiology from a largely academic discipline, conjoined 
with speech-language pathology and modeled after teacher 
training and certifi cation, to an independent health-care profession 
with doctoral-level education and licensure. The clinical evolution 
has changed the practice from a rehabilitative emphasis to one of 
 diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss.
The Professional Heritage of Audiology
The profession of audiology has progressed over the last 50 years 
in several important ways that have both promoted and neces-
sitated dramatic change in academic preparation, governmental 
and regulatory recognition, and professional responsibility and 
status. This evolution in the professional makeup of audiology 
has resulted from at least four important infl uences: 
 1. the evolution of audiology from primarily an academic dis-
cipline into a health-care profession; 
 2. the evolution from a communication disorder profession 
into a hearing profession; 
 3. the evolution from a teacher-training model of education 
into a health-care model of education; and 
 4. the evolution from a certifi cation model to a licensure model 
of defi ning the privilege and right to practice. 
From Academic Discipline to Health-Care Profession
While the clinical roots of  the profession were taking hold in 
 government hospitals as a result of World War II, the academic 
roots were growing in the discipline of communication sciences. 
The communications sciences and disorders discipline had evolved 
away from the fi eld of general communications. Speech-language

ﬁ eld of audiology.
pathology was an extension of the scientifi c interest in the anatomy 
and physiology of speech and its disorders, and the fl edgling neuro-
science of language and its development and disorders. Audiology, 
emerging later, was an extension of general communication, bio-
acoustics, psychoacoustics, and auditory neurosciences.
Change occurred in audiology throughout the 1980s and 1990s. 
Emphasis began to shift from the discipline to the profession. Edu-
cational models began to emerge that emphasized the training of 
skillful practitioners. By the early twenty-fi rst century, the profes-
sion had begun to converge on the use of a single designator, the 
Au.D., for those students interested in becoming audiologists. 
From Communication Disorders 
to Hearing Profession
The profession of  audiology has its roots in the discipline of 
communication sciences and disorders, and the profession of 
speech-language pathology. Professionals in the early years were 
knowledgeable in both speech and hearing and were recognized 
providers in both areas. The strength of the academic programs 
lay in the overall discipline, and the distinction of two professions 
took many years to evolve.
By the 1970s, the bodies of knowledge in both speech and hear-
ing had expanded to an extent that academic specialization began 
to emerge. On the clinical side, the distinction between professions 
became clearer. Speech-language pathologists most often practiced 
their profession in the schools, while audiologists were in hospitals, 
clinics, and private practices. But even in hospital settings, distinc-
tions emerged. Speech-language pathology programs began to align 
with other therapies, such as physical therapy and occupational 
therapy, and were commonly more comfortably associated with re-
habilitation medicine or neurology. Audiology emerged as more of 
a diagnostic profession, most often aligned with otolaryngology.
During the 1980s, the divergence of two distinct clinical profes-
sions became apparent. Practitioners were primarily practicing in 
one profession or another. As the fi rst decade of the twenty-fi rst 
century drew to a close, audiology and speech-language pathol-
ogy had clearly become independent professions. 

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  27
From Teacher-Training Model to 
Health-Care Model of Education
The evolution of audiology education to the doctoral level is per-
haps the most important and far-reaching development in the 
modern era of the profession. The early model of education for 
speech-language pathologists and audiologists has its roots in the 
education of classroom teachers. The model was one of didactic 
education for content learning, with a student-teaching assign-
ment for developing skills in teaching.
By the late 1980s, the fi eld of audiology began to restructure its ac-
ademic model by converting it into a fi rst-professional-degree model 
of doctoral-level professional education. The first- professional-
degree designation is one used by the United States Department 
of Education to defi ne certain entry-level professional degree pro-
grams. The profession agreed on a degree designator, the Au.D., and 
embarked on the process of reengineering its programs to a doctoral 
level, designed to graduate skilled practitioners in audiology.
The change to doctoral-level professional education had many 
 advantages, foremost among them that the model of education 
fi t the desired outcome. Graduate education is now separated into 
two tracks: professional studies and research studies. The current 
Au.D. model falls under the category of professional studies; the 
Ph.D. under research studies. Professional studies prepare stu-
dents for careers as competent, licensed practitioners. Research 
studies culminate in degrees (Ph.D., Sc.D., and Ed.D.) that are 
awarded for demonstration of independent research. The educa-
tion system recognizes the research degree as preparing gradu-
ates to engage in scientifi c endeavors; the professional degree as 
preparing graduates for clinical practice.
From Certiﬁ cation to Licensure Model
The question of  what defines someone as an audiologist has 
changed over the last decade. Under the old educational model, a 
graduate degree in audiology was not the end of the educational 
process. Students would graduate with any one of a number of 
degrees, including M.A., M.S., M.C.D., Ph.D., and Sc.D. Following 
 completion of the degree program, the graduate would engage in 
9 months of supervised clinical work, pass the national examination 

28  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
in audiology (Praxis Examination in Audiology, administered by the 
Educational Testing Service), and become certifi ed and/or licensed 
in audiology. The certificate that most audiologists held for many 
years was ASHA’s Certifi cate of Clinical Competence in Audiology, 
or the CCC-A. More recently, the American Academy of Audiology 
began offering another certifi cate created by the American Board of 
Audiology (ABA).
Certifi cation is the process by which a nongovernment agency or 
association grants recognition to an individual who has met cer-
tain predetermined qualifi cations specifi ed by that institution. It 
is a voluntary credential awarded by professional associations or 
certifi cation bodies. It is generally not legally mandatory for prac-
tice of a profession. Rather, it serves as the self-governing aspect of 
professional activity. By contrast, licensure is the process by which 
a government agency grants individuals permission to engage in a 
specifi ed profession. Licensure provides the legal right to practice 
in a state; it is mandatory in order to practice legally. By 2006, all 
states and the District of Columbia had some form of regulation, 
nearly all requiring an audiology license (48 via licensure; 2 via 
registration). Nearly 60% of states permit audiologists to dispense 
hearing aids without additional licensure.
In the modern context of audiology as an autonomous health-
care profession, licensure has largely replaced the need for entry-
level certification. The academic transition to the Au.D. degree 
and the proliferation of licensure laws throughout the country 
helped to transform the profession from certifi cation to licensure. 
Once students earn an Au.D. and pass the national examination, 
they are granted the privilege to practice through state licensure.
Many audiologists fi nd additional value in certifi cation for the self-
governing of professional activity on a voluntary basis and may 
hold either or both of the CCC-A and ABA certifi cates.
The Clinical Heritage of Audiology
The defi nition of audiology as the health-care profession devoted 
to hearing has its roots in clinical activities that go back as far as 
the 1920s and 1930s. The term audiology can be traced back to 
the 1940s when it was used to describe clinical practices related

to serving the hearing care needs of  soldiers returning from 
World War II. Following the war, graduate training programs 
were developed to teach the academic discipline of  audiology. 
Definitions of audiology during the 1950s and 1960s reflected 
this academic perspective in which audiology was often defi ned 
as the study of  hearing and hearing disorders. Tremendous 
strides were made in the 1970s in the technologies available for 
evaluating hearing. Similarly, tremendous strides were made in 
the 1980s and 1990s in hearing-aid amplifi cation technologies. 
As the decades progressed, the number of  practitioners of  the 
profession of audiology grew substantially. Audiology had evolved 
from an academic discipline to a doctoral-level clinical profession.
Audiology’s Beginnings (Before 1950)
Credit for the genesis of audiology should be given to a number of 
individuals, but a few stand out as true leaders in the early years 
of  the profession. Perhaps the first individual to whom credit 
should go is C. C. Bunch. Bunch, first at the University of Iowa 
and later at Washington University in St. Louis, used the newly 
developed Western Electric 1-A audiometer to assess the hearing 
of patients with otologic problems. He did so in the 1920s and 
1930s. Working with an otologist, Dr. L. W. Dean, he showed how 
the electric audiometer could be used as an enhancement to tuning 
forks to quantify hearing loss. In doing so, he developed what we 
now know as the pure-tone audiogram and was the fi rst to describe 
audiometric patterns of many different types of auditory disorders.
The profession of  audiology can be traced back to the 1940s. 
Near the end of World War II, the Army established three aural 
rehabilitation centers to provide medical and rehabilitative 
services to returning soldiers who had developed hearing 
impairment during the war. The three centers were the Borden 
General Hospital in Chickasha, Oklahoma; Hoff General Hospital 
in Santa Barbara, California; and Deshon General Hospital in 
Butler, Pennsylvania. The Navy also established a center at the 
Naval Hospital in Philadelphia. Perhaps the most notable of 
the centers was Deshon hospital, where a young captain in the 
Army Medical Corps, Raymond Carhart, developed a protocol for 
the fitting and evaluation of hearing aids that became a model 
for clinical practice for many years. Carhart had been a student 

30  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
of C. C. Bunch at Northwestern University, where Bunch was a 
visiting professor late in his career.
Following World War II, Carhart returned to Northwestern Uni-
versity, where he developed a graduate training program that was 
to produce many of the leaders of the audiology profession for the 
remainder of the century. Other leaders emerged from the aural 
rehabilitation centers as well. Grant Fairbanks, from the Borden 
Hospital, went to the University of Illinois and established a model 
program for the training of hearing scientists. William G. Hardy, 
from the Naval Hospital, went to Johns Hopkins Medical School 
and pioneered pediatric hearing testing. Also during the post-war 
era, three pioneers joined together at the Central Institute for the 
Deaf in St. Louis. Hallowell Davis, a physiologist from Harvard, 
S. Richard Silverman, an educator of  the deaf, and Ira Hirsh, 
from the psychology department at Harvard, created a powerful 
program of basic and applied research that provided the basis for 
many clinical concepts in use today.
Audiology as an Academic Discipline 
(1950s and 1960s)
In the early 1950s, fewer than 500 individuals considered them-
selves audiologists. Most worked in otologists’ offi ces, Veteran’s 
Administration hospitals, universities, and speech and hearing 
centers. The graduate programs at Northwestern University and 
then at other midwestern universities dominated the academic 
scene. In 1958, the first textbook on audiology was written by 
Hayes Newby of Stanford University. In parallel developments in 
Washington, D.C., Kenneth O. Johnson, the Executive Secretary of 
the ASHA, was working to establish the profession of speech and 
hearing in the political realm. During the 1960s, the quality of 
academic programs was measured by the number and productiv-
ity of Ph.D. students.
Practitioners were beginning to expand services, although hearing 
aid dispensing was considered to be unethical. In the 1960s, James 
Jerger, a student of Carhart’s at Northwestern, traveled south to 
Houston, where his clinical efforts ushered in the concept of di-
agnostic audiology. In those days, radiographic techniques were 
still relatively crude and not very sensitive to neurologic disorders. 

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  31
Speech audiometry 
pertains to measurement 
of the hearing of speech 
signals. 
Impedance audiometry 
is now referred to as 
immittance audiometry.
The American Academy 
of Audiology was 
established in 1988, as an 
organization of, by, and for 
audiologists.
Jerger led the way in showing how behavioral measures of audi-
tory function could be used to assist in the diagnosis of these disor-
ders. His highly innovative work, beginning in the middle 1950s, 
continued throughout the century. In the 1960s, he ushered in 
new concepts in speech audiometry and other diagnostic tech-
niques. In the 1970s, he brought clinical relevance to impedance 
audiometry. In the 1980s, he started the American Academy of 
Audiology. In the 1990s, he established the fi rst Au.D. program. 
His tireless work over these years will undoubtedly be remembered 
for its infl uence on the clinical practice of audiology.
Audiology as a Clinical Profession 
(1970s and Beyond)
By the 1970s, clinical audiology began to fl ourish. Major tech-
nological advances helped to enhance both diagnostic and treat-
ment efforts. Impedance audiometry, later to become known as 
immittance audiometry, enhanced the testing of  middle ear 
function substantially. Discovery of the auditory brainstem re-
sponse led to major breakthroughs in diagnostic measures and in 
pediatric audiology.
Another milestone also occurred in the 1970s. Hearing devices, 
once relegated to the retail market, were declared to be medical 
devices by the United States Food and Drug Administration. This 
had a substantial impact on the nature of devices and delivery 
systems. In the latter part of the 1970s, ethical restrictions to au-
diologists dispensing hearing aids fell to the concept of compre-
hensive patient care, and audiologists began dispensing hearing 
devices routinely.
If the 1970s was the decade of  diagnostic breakthroughs, the 
1980s was the decade of  treatment breakthroughs. Hearing-
 device amplifi cation improved dramatically. In-the-ear devices that 
were both reliable and of good sound quality were introduced early 
in the decade and were embraced by hearing aid users. Computer-
based hearing devices that permitted programmability of features 
were introduced later in the decade and began to set new standards 
for amplifi cation. By the end of the decade, cochlear implants were 
becoming routine care for adults with profound hearing loss and 
were beginning to be used successfully by young children.

32  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
Otoacoustic emissions 
(OAEs) are measurable 
sounds emitted by the 
normal cochlea, which are 
related to the function of the 
outer hair cells. 
The 1990s brought other successes. The introduction of clini-
cally feasible measures of otoacoustic emissions led to the notion 
of hearing screening of all infants born in the United States. By 
the mid-1990s, efforts to achieve this goal were well under way. 
Also on the evaluative side, a great deal more attention was being 
focused on disorders of auditory processing abilities. As diagnos-
tic strategies were enhanced, the practicality of measuring these 
abilities became apparent.
On the treatment side, the 1990s brought renewed enthusiasm 
for hearing device dispensing as user satisfaction grew dramati-
cally with enhancements in sound processing technology. The 
1990s also brought a healthy emphasis on consumerism, which 
led to renewed calls by the Food and Drug Administration and the 
Federal Trade Commission for enhanced delivery systems to con-
sumers and a crackdown on misleading advertising by some man-
ufacturers. Programmable and digital hearing devices began to 
impact the market in a signifi cant way. Cochlear implants  became 
increasingly common in young children.
The early years of the twenty-fi rst century turned the diagnostic 
challenge from pediatric audiology to infant audiology. Newborn 
hearing screening became commonplace across the United States, 
and the age of hearing loss identifi cation began to drop accord-
ingly. Electrophysiologic prediction of hearing sensitivity gained 
renewed importance and was buoyed by the clinical introduction 
and acceptance of  auditory steady-state response techniques. 
Also on the diagnostic front, the differentiation of  primary ef-
fects of nervous system lesions on auditory nerve function from 
secondary effects of such lesions on cochlear function made for 
a fascinating reevaluation and invigoration of the usefulness of 
functional measures as a supplement to structural imaging of the 
nervous system.
Technology continued to progress on the treatment side as well. 
Hearing aids were now exclusively digital in their signal process-
ing, and the distinction between analog and digital became insig-
nifi cant. Directionality in hearing aid microphones improved to a 
point of relevancy and became commonplace. Cochlear implant 
candidacy expanded to increasingly less hearing loss, and distinc-
tions began to blur between candidacy for powerful hearing aids 

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  33
versus implants. Meanwhile, cochlear implants were being used 
in the pediatric population at ever-younger ages, with speech, lan-
guage, and reading outcomes continuing to show proof that the 
earlier was the intervention, the better the fi nal result.
As the new century progresses, the profession of audiology can 
look forward with great expectations. The identifi cation of hear-
ing loss in ever-younger babies is leading to signifi cant changes 
in early childhood education. Growth in the aging population 
is occurring at a time when hearing aid technological advances 
promise to extend acceptable hearing for many years. Audiology 
has progressed to a doctoral-level profession and advanced signifi -
cantly in its recognition as an autonomous and important pro-
vider of health care.
PROFESSIONAL REQUIREMENTS
A typical new audiology graduate in the 2000s:
holds a bachelor’s degree in communication disorders or 
• 
another health- or science-related area,
has earned an Au.D. degree,
• 
has passed a national examination in audiology, and
• 
has a state license to practice audiology, which includes the 
• 
dispensing of hearing aids.
Becoming an Audiologist
To become an audiologist, an individual must be granted a 
 doctoral degree (Au.D.) from an academic institution that meets 
accreditation requirements set forth by an accrediting agency 
 recognized by the U.S. Department of  Education. The agency 
responsible for accrediting audiology and speech-language 
 pathology programs is the Council on Academic Accreditation 
(CAA) in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology. During the 
course of the Au.D. program, and in addition to routine clinical 
rotations, the candidate must complete an externship, which is 
typically a fourth-year full-time clinical experience under the 
guidance and direction of a preceptor. The candidate must also 
pass the national examination in audiology. On completion of the 
Au.D. and after passing the national examination, the candidate 

34  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
becomes eligible for state  licensure. The candidate will also be 
eligible for certifi cation by the ASHA or ABA as desired. Licensure 
is usually renewed on an  annual basis and typically requires 
evidence of active involvement in continuing education. Some 
audiologists are exempt from state licensure because of the nature 
of  their employment setting. As a general rule, audiologists 
who work in public school settings or who work for government 
agencies are exempt from state licensure, although most seek 
licensure regardless of their exemption status.
Requirements necessary to dispense hearing aids vary across 
states. In most states, licensure in audiology also automatically 
grants licensure to dispense hearing aids. Although there is 
a growing trend for this type of  arrangement, many states 
still require a separate license to dispense hearing aids. Most 
dispensing-licensure requirements are less stringent than 
requirements to practice audiology. Thus, most individuals who 
meet requirements for audiology licensure have the necessary 
requirements for a  dispensing license. Nonetheless, a separate 
examination, usually written and practical, may be required by 
state dispensing boards.
Academic and Clinical Requirements
Academic and clinical requirements for audiology are deter-
mined by individual academic institutions, based on guidelines 
offered by an accreditation agency, the CAA. In order for students 
to be considered for licensure, they must graduate from an insti-
tution that is accredited by the agency. These requirements are 
intended to ensure educational quality and provide uniformity 
across programs.
Academic requirements include minimum number of classroom 
hours of exposure to different aspects of audiology and related bod-
ies of knowledge. In general, audiology students are required or en-
couraged to take classes in general science areas such as acoustics, 
anatomy and physiology, electronics, and computer technology. 
Classes are required in normal processes of hearing, speech, and 
language development as well as in pathologies of the auditory sys-
tem. Audiologic diagnosis is usually covered in a number of classes, 

CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES  35
including those on basic testing, electroacoustic and electrophysio-
logic measurement, and pediatric  assessment. Audiologic treatment 
is usually covered in classes on audiologic rehabilitation, amplifi ca-
tion, pediatric intervention, and counseling.
Clinical requirements include a minimum number of hours of 
hands-on diagnosis and treatment in a variety of settings. Some 
minimum requirements of speech and language evaluation and 
remediation serve as a precursor to the audiologic experience. 
In audiology, clinical hours are necessary in basic and advanced 
 assessment of children and adults and in hearing aid assessment 
and fi tting.
Following classroom education and clinical rotations, the aspir-
ing audiologist usually embarks on an externship year as a part of 
the academic program. This is a focused clinical rotation during 
which the Au.D. candidate serves in a clinical capacity under the 
direction of a licensed audiologist serving as a preceptor. The goal 
of the externship is to enhance and polish the clinical abilities of 
the audiology candidate.
Summary
Audiology is the health-care profession devoted to hearing. It is 
• 
a clinical profession that has as its unique mission the diagno-
sis of hearing loss and the treatment of impairment that results 
from hearing disorders.
An audiologist is a professional who, by virtue of academic and 
• 
clinical training, and appropriate credentialing, is uniquely 
qualified to provide a comprehensive array of  professional 
services related to the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment 
of  hearing impairment and its associated communication 
disorder.
The audiologist assesses hearing, evaluates and fits hearing 
• 
aids, and assists in the implementation of treatment.
The audiologist may also engage in the evaluation of dizziness 
• 
and balance disorders and the monitoring of  multisensory 
evoked potentials.

36  CHAPTER 1  THE PROFESSION OF AUDIOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES
Audiology is an autonomous profession. A patient with a hear-
• 
ing loss can choose to enter the health-care door through the 
audiologist, without referral from a physician or other health-
care provider. Audiologists are practitioners qualifi ed to assess 
hearing and provide hearing treatment services and are af-
forded the autonomy to do so.
Audiologists are employed in a number of different settings, in-
• 
cluding private practices, physicians’ practices, hospitals and 
medical centers, hearing and speech clinics, schools, universi-
ties, hearing instrument manufacturers, and industry.
As broadly based health-care professionals diagnosing and 
• 
treating hearing impairment, audiologists come into contact 
with many other professionals on a daily basis, including oto-
laryngologists, other physicians, speech-language pathologists, 
non-audiologist hearing aid dispensers, and other health-care 
and education professionals.
Audiology has evolved over the past 50 years clinically, aca-
• 
demically, and professionally. The professional evolution has 
changed the practice of  audiology from a largely academic 
discipline to an independent health-care profession with 
doctoral-level education and licensure. The clinical evolution 
has changed the practice from a rehabilitation emphasis to 
one of diagnosis and treatment of hearing loss.
In the grand scheme of things, audiology is a relatively young 
• 
profession. The term audiology can be traced back to the 1940s 
when it was used to describe clinical practices related to serv-
ing hearing care needs of soldiers returning from World War II. 
Tremendous strides were made in the 1970s in the technologies 
available for evaluating hearing and in the 1980s in hearing aid 
amplifi cation technologies. As the decades progressed, the num-
ber of practitioners of the profession of audiology grew sub-
stantially, and audiology evolved from an academic discipline to 
a clinical profession.
A typical new audiology graduate in the first decade of  the 
• 
twenty-fi rst century holds a bachelor’s degree in communica-
tion disorders or another health- or science-related area, has 
earned an Au.D. degree, has passed a national examination in 
audiology, and has a state license to practice audiology, which 
includes the dispensing of hearing aids.

THE NATURE OF HEARING

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  41
THE hearing mechanism is an amazingly intricate system. 
Sound is generated by a source that sends out air pressure waves. 
These pressure waves reach the eardrum, or tympanic mem-
brane, which vibrates at a rate and magnitude proportional to 
the nature of  the waves. The tympanic membrane transforms 
this  vibration into mechanical energy in the middle ear, which 
in turn converts it to hydraulic energy in the fl uid of the inner 
ear. The hydraulic energy stimulates the sensory cells of the in-
ner ear, which send electrical impulses to the auditory nerve, 
brainstem, and cortex. But the passive reception of auditory in-
formation is only the beginning. The listener brings to bear upon 
these acoustic waves attention to the sound, differentiation of 
the sound from background noise, and experience with similar 
sounds. The listener then puts all of these aspects of audition into 
the context of the moment to identify the nature of a sound.
That simple sounds can be identified is testimony to the exquisite 
sensitivity of the auditory system. Now imagine the intricacy of 
identifying numerous sounds that have been molded together to cre-
ate speech. These sounds of speech are made up of pressure waves 
that by themselves carry no meaning. When they are put together 
in a certain order and processed by a normally functioning auditory 
system, they take on the characteristics of speech, which is then 
 processed further to reveal the meaning of what has been said.
When you think about the auditory system, it is easy to become 
amazed that it serves both as an obligatory sense that cannot be

turned off and as a very specialized means of communication. 
That is, the auditory system simultaneously monitors the envi-
ronment for events that might alert the listener to danger, oppor-
tunity, or change, while focusing on the processing of acoustic 
events as complicated as speech. The importance of  continual 
environmental monitoring, the intricacy of  turning pressure 
waves into meaningful constructs, and the complexity of doing 
all of this at once speaks to the extraordinary capability of the 
auditory system.
This chapter provides an overview of the nature of sound and its 
characteristics, the structure and function of the auditory and 
vestibular systems, and the way in which sound is processed by 
the auditory system to allow us to hear.
THE NATURE OF SOUND
You have undoubtedly heard the question about whether or not a 
tree that falls in a forest makes a sound if no one is around to hear 
it. The question is of interest because it serves to illustrate the dif-
ference between the physical properties that we know as sound 
and the psychological properties that we know as hearing.
What Is Sound?
Sound is a common type of  energy that occurs as a result of 
pressure waves that emanate from some force being applied to 
a sound source. For example, a hammer being applied to a nail 
results in vibrations that propagate through the air, the ham-
mer, the nail, and the wood. Sound results from the compres-
sion of molecules in the medium through which it is traveling. 
In this example, the sound that emanates through the air re-
sults from a disturbance of air molecules. Groups of molecules 
are compressed, which, in turn, compress adjacent groups of 
molecules. This results in waves of pressure that emanate from 
the source.
There are several requirements for sound to exist. Initially there 
must be a source of vibratory energy. This energy must then be 
delivered to and cause a disturbance in a medium. Any medium 
will do, actually, as long as it has mass and is compressible, or 
Sound is vibratory energy 
transmitted by pressure 
waves in the air or other 
media.
Hearing is the perception 
of sound.

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  43
During condensation, the 
density of air molecules is 
increased, causing increased 
pressure.
During rarefaction, the 
density of air molecules 
is decreased, causing 
decreased pressure.
elastic, which most are. The disturbance is then propagated in the 
medium in the form of sound waves that carry energy away from 
the source. These waves occur from a compression of the medium, 
or condensation, followed by an expansion of  the medium, or 
 rarefaction. This compression and expansion of particles results 
in pressure changes propagated through the medium. The waves 
are considered longitudinal in that the motion of the medium’s 
particles is in the same direction as the disturbance.
Thus, sound results from a force acting on an elastic mass that is 
then propagated through a medium in the form of longitudinal 
condensation and rarefaction waves that create pressure changes 
and create sound. Perhaps an example will clarify.
Suppose for a moment that you are an air molecule. You are sur-
rounded on all sides by other air molecules. Your position in space 
is fixed (the analogy is not perfect, but bear with me). You are 
free to move in any direction, but because of your elasticity, you 
always move back to your original position after you have been 
displaced. That is, your movement will always be opposed by a 
restoring force that will bring you back to where you were. This 
movement of yours is illustrated in Figure 2-1.
Okay, now an earphone diaphragm moves outward from behind 
you. You and your neighbors to your left and right get pushed 
from behind by those neighbors behind you. This causes you to 
bump into your neighbors in front of you, who in turn push those 
in front of them. Your elasticity keeps you from moving too far, 
and so basically, you get squished or compressed in the crowd. You 
haven’t really moved much, but the energy from the loudspeaker 
has been passed by the action of you bumping into those in front 
of you, who bump into those in front of them, and so on. Thus the 
pressure caused by the loudspeaker movement is passed on in a 
wave of compression. But wait, now the diaphragm moves back 
and you are pulled backwards by a low pressure area, resulting in 
an expansion (rarefaction) of space between you and the neigh-
bors behind and in front of  you. Then, just as the elbow room 
is feeling good, the diaphragm moves back the other way and 
squishes you back together, and so on. This series of compression 
and expansion waves is depicted in Figure 2-2.

44  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
As mentioned, the analogy is not perfect. Air molecules are con-
stantly moving in a random manner. You do not move along be-
cause your net displacement, or movement from your original 
place, is zero (i.e., you are going nowhere) due to the elasticity 
restoring your original position; rather the energy in the wave 
of disturbance gets passed along as a chain reaction. That is, it 
is your motion that is passed on to your neighboring molecule 
rather than you being displaced. You pass on the wave of distur-
bance rather than move with it.
You have mass, you are elastic, and you pass energy along in the 
form of pressure waves.

to elasticity, PI moves back to its original position after 
displacement, and P2 continues the energy transfer by 
moving into P3. The small inset shows the displacement

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  45
The continuous, periodic 
back and forth movement of 
an object is called simple 
harmonic motion. 
Sinusoidal motion is 
harmonic motion plotted as 
a function of time. 
A waveform is a form or 
shape of a wave, represented 
graphically as magnitude 
versus time.
Properties of Sound
The back and forth movement is referred to as simple harmonic 
motion, or sinusoidal motion. Now suppose that we were to 
graph the movement. We give you a pencil and ask you to hold 
it as we plot your movement over time. The result is shown in 
 Figure 2-3. This graphic representation is called a sinusoid, and 
the simple harmonic motion produces a sinusoidal waveform, or 
sine wave. Because the displacement as an air molecule is propa-
gated, or passed on, through the pressure wave, the simple har-
monic motion also describes the pressure changes of the sound 
wave over time. Thus, a sine wave is a graphic way of representing 
the pressure waves of sound. This is illustrated in Figure 2-4.
This sinusoidal waveform is used as a means of describing the var-
ious properties of sound, as shown in Figure 2-5. The magnitude

or amplitude of displacement dictates the intensity of the sound. 
How often a complete cycle of displacement occurs dictates the 
frequency of  a sound. The point along the displacement path 
 describes the phase element of a waveform.
Intensity
The magnitude of a sound is described as its intensity. Intensity 
is related to the perception of loudness. As described above, an air 
molecule that is displaced will be moved a certain distance, return 
past its original location to an equal displacement in the oppo-
site direction, and then return to its original location. The total 
displacement can be thought of as one cycle in the movement of 
the molecule. The magnitude of the cycle, or the distance that 
the molecule moves, is called its intensity. The higher the force or

magnitude of the compression wave, the higher the intensity of 
the signal. Figure 2-6 illustrates two waveforms that are identical 
in frequency and phase but vary in amplitude or intensity.
The range of intensity of sound is quite large. For example, the 
pressure level of  a sound that is just barely audible is approxi-
mately 20 μPa (or microPascals, a unit of measure of pressure).

level in absolute units is intractable. Instead, intensity has come 
to be described in units called decibels (dB).
The decibel was derived to describe the magnitude of  sound in 
the early days of telephone. The convention described intensity 
as the logarithm of  the ratio of  a measured power to a refer-
ence power. Power was used rather than pressure because of 
the nature of measuring the output of telephone lines. But the 
concept held, and the unit of measure used was referred to as a 
Bel, named after Alexander Graham Bell. By using logarithms, 
the large intensity range was made to vary between 1 and 14 
Bels. This proved to be too small a resolution, and the notion of a 
decibel was created so that 1 Bel would equal 10 decibels, 2 Bels 
would equal 20 decibels, and so on.
Today, we most often express intensity in decibels (dB) sound 
pressure level, or dB SPL. Here’s how we got there. First, inten-
sity level (IL), or the magnitude of sound expressed as power, is 
described by the following formula:
dB IL = 10 log (power/reference power)
But we don’t want to measure power, we want to measure sound 
pressure. Well, it turns out that power is proportional to pressure 
squared, so the formula that applies is:
dB SPL = 10 log (pressure/reference pressure)2
Of course, the log of something squared is 2, so we can restate the 
formula as:
dB SPL = 2 × 10 log (pressure/reference pressure)
And, of course, we all know that 2 × 10 equals 20, so the decibel 
formula that we use to describe intensity in sound pressure level 
is, fi nally:
dB SPL = 20 log (pressure/reference pressure)
where pressure is the measured pressure and reference pressure is a 
chosen standard against which to compare the measured pressure. 
A decibel (dB) is one tenth 
of a Bel.
The exponent expressing 
the power to which a ﬁ xed 
number, the base, must be 
raised to produce a given 
number is the logarithm.
A Bel is a unit of sound 
intensity relative to a 
reference intensity.
Alexander Graham Bell, 
who invented the telephone, 
also championed aural 
education of the deaf. The 
A.G. Bell museum is located 
in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.
Sound pressure level 
(SPL) = magnitude of sound 
energy relative to a reference 
pressure .0002 dyne/cm2 or 
20 μPa. 

50  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
This reference pressure is expressed in various units of measure as 
described in Table 2-1.
This is probably not as diffi cult as it seems. There are at least two 
important points to remember that should make this easier and 
more useful to comprehend.

Important Point #1. The logarithm idea is a way of reducing 
the range of pressure levels to a tractable one. By using this 
approach, pressures that vary from 1:1 to a hundred-million: 1 
can be expressed as varying from 0 to 140 dB.
Important Point #2. Decibels are expressed as a ratio of a mea-
sured pressure to a reference pressure. This means that 0 dB 
does not mean no sound. It simply means that the measured 
pressure is equal to the reference pressure, as follows: 
dB SPL = 20 log (20 μPa/20 μPa)
dB SPL = 20 log (1)
dB SPL = 20 × 0
dB SPL = 0
So, if the measured pressure is 20 μPa, and 20 μPa is the standard 
reference pressure, then 20/20 equals 1, and we all remember 
that the log of 1 is 0 and that 20 times 0 equals 0. Therefore, as 

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  51
you can see, 0 dB SPL does not mean no sound. It also means that 
having a sound with an intensity of −10 dB is possible.
As you will learn later in this section when we get to the 
 audiogram, we are not content to stop with SPL as a way of ex-
pressing decibels. In fact, one of the most common referents for 
decibels in audiometry is known as hearing level (HL), which rep-
resents decibels according to average normal hearing. Thus, 0 dB 
HL would refer to the intensity of a signal that could just barely be 
heard by the human ear. Human hearing ranges from the thresh-
old of audibility, around 0 dB HL, to the threshold of pain, around 
140 dB HL. Normal conversational speech occurs at around 40 to 
50 dB HL, and the point of discomfort is approximately 90 dB HL.
Frequency
The second major way that sound is characterized is by its fre-
quency. Frequency is the speed of vibration and is related to the 
perception of  pitch. Recall that, as an air molecule, you were 
pushed in one direction, pulled in the other, and then returned to 
your original position. This constitutes one cycle of displacement. 
Frequency is the speed with which you moved. One way to describe 
this speed is by the time elapsed for one complete cycle to occur. 
This is called the period. Another way is by the number of cycles 
that a molecule moves in a specifi ed period of time, which can be 
calculated as 1/period. Figure 2-8 illustrates three waveforms that 
are identical in amplitude and phase but vary in frequency.
Frequency is usually expressed in cycles-per-second or Hertz (Hz). 
Human hearing in young adults ranges from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. 
Middle C on the piano has a frequency of 250 Hz. For audiomet-
ric purposes, frequency is not expressed in a linear form (i.e., with 
equal intervals), rather it is partitioned into octave intervals. An 
octave is simply twice the frequency of a given frequency. For au-
diometry, convention sets the lowest frequency at 125 Hz. Octave 
intervals then are 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000 Hz.
Phase
Phase is the location at any point in time in the displacement of an 
air molecule during simple harmonic motion. Phase is  expressed 
in degrees of a circle, as shown in Figure 2-9. That back and forth 
An audiogram is a graph 
of thresholds of hearing 
sensitivity as a function of 
frequency.
Hearing level (HL) 
refers to the dB level of 
a sound referenced to 
audiometric zero.
Frequency is the number of 
cycles occurring in 1 second, 
expressed in Hertz (Hz).
Pitch is the perception of 
frequency.
The length of time for a sine 
wave to complete one cycle 
is called the period.
Hertz (Hz) is unit of 
measure of frequency, 
named after physicist 
Heinrich Hertz.
The frequency interval 
between one tone and a 
tone of twice the frequency 
is called an octave.

52  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
vibratory motion can be equated to circular motion may not be 
altogether intuitive. Figure 2-10 shows what would happen to 
an air molecule if it were being moved by the motion of a wheel. 
As the wheel approached 90°, it would be maximally displaced 
away from the vibrating source; as the wheel approached 270°, 
it would be maximally displaced toward the vibrating source, 
and so on.
One important aspect of phase is in its description of the starting 
point of a waveform. Figure 2-11 illustrates two waveforms that are 
identical in amplitude and frequency but vary in starting phase.
Spectrum
Thus far, sound has been described in it simplest form, that of a 
sinusoid or pure tone of one frequency. Simplifying to this level 
is helpful in describing the basic aspects of sound. Although pure 
tones are not commonly found in nature, they are used exten-
sively in audiometry as a method of assessing hearing sensitivity.

54  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
A sinusoid is a periodic wave in that it repeats itself  at regular 
 intervals over time.
Waves that are not sinusoidal are considered complex, as they are 
composed of  more than one sinusoid that differ in amplitude, 
frequency, and/or phase. Complex waves can be periodic, in 
which some component repeats at regular intervals, or they can 
be aperiodic, in which the components occur randomly.
Sounds in nature are usually complex, and they are rarely suffi -
ciently described on the basis of the intensity of a single frequency. 
For these more complex sounds, the interaction of intensity and 
frequency is referred to as the sound’s spectrum. The spectral 
content of a complex sound can be expressed as the intensity of 
the various frequencies that are represented at a given moment in 
time. An example is shown in Figure 2-12.

Acoustic pertains to sound.
THE AUDITORY SYSTEM
Hearing is an obligatory function; it cannot be turned off. Hearing 
is also a distance sense that functions mostly to monitor the exter-
nal environment. In most animals, hearing serves a protective func-
tion, locating potential predators and other danger. It also serves a 
communication function, with varying levels of sophistication.
The auditory system is an amazingly intricate system, which has 
high sensitivity, sharp frequency tuning, and wide dynamic range. 
It is sensitive enough to perceive acoustic signals with pressure wave 
amplitudes of minuscule magnitudes. It is very fi nely tuned to an ex-
tent that it is capable of resolving, or distinguishing, frequencies with 
remarkable acuity. Finally, it is able to process acoustic signals vary-
ing in magnitude, or intensity range, in astonishing proportion.
FIGURE 2-12 The spectral content of a single-frequency tone (top) and of a complex sound 
 (bottom) are expressed as amplitude spectra, or amplitude of the individual 
 frequency components.

The outer ear includes the 
auricle, external auditory 
meatus, and lateral surface 
of the tympanic membrane. 
The physical processing of acoustic information occurs in three 
groups of structures, commonly known as the outer, middle, and 
inner ears. Neural processing begins in the inner ear and contin-
ues, via the VIIIth cranial nerve, to the central auditory nervous 
system. Psychological processing begins primarily in the brain-
stem and pons and continues to the auditory cortex and beyond. 
A useful diagrammatic representation of the auditory system is 
shown in Figure 2-13.
Outer Ear
The outer ear serves to collect and resonate sound, assist in sound 
localization, and function as a protective mechanism for the mid-
dle ear. The outer ear has three main components: the auricle, the 
ear canal or meatus, and the outer layer of the eardrum or tym-
panic membrane.
The auricle is the visible portion of  the ear, consisting of  skin-
covered cartilage. It is also known as the pinna and is shown in 
the drawing of the anatomy of the ear in Figure 2-14. The up-
per rim of the ear is often referred to as the helix and the lower 
FIGURE 2-13 Schematic representation of structures and function of the auditory system, showing 
both afferent and efferent pathways. (Adapted from “Cochlear Neurobiology: Revolutionary 
Developments,” by P. Dallos, 1988, ASHA, 30, p. 55.)

portion of the ear is called 
the auricle.

fl abby portion as the lobule. The bowl at the entrance to the ex-
ternal auditory meatus is known as the concha.
The auricles serve mainly to collect sound waves and funnel them 
to the external auditory canal. In humans, the auricles serve a 
more minor role in sound collection than in other animals. The 
auricles are important for sound localization in the vertical plane 
(ability to locate sound above and below) and for protection of 
the ear canal. The auricles also serve as resonators, enhancing 
sounds around 4500 Hz.
The external auditory meatus is a narrow channel leading from 
an opening in the side of  the head that measures 23–29 mm 
in length. The outer two thirds of  the canal is composed of

 skin-covered  cartilage. The inner one third is skin-covered bone. 
The canal is elliptical in shape and takes a downward bend as it 
approaches the tympanic membrane. The skin in the cartilagi-
nous portion of  the canal contains glands that secrete earwax 
or cerumen.
The external auditory meatus directs sound to the eardrum or 
tympanic membrane. It serves as a resonator, enhancing sounds 
around 2700 Hz. It also serves to protect the tympanic mem-
brane by its narrow opening. Cerumen in the canal also serves 
to protect the ear from intrusion by foreign objects, creatures, 
and so on.
The tympanic membrane lies at the end of the external audi-
tory canal. It is a membrane made of several layers of skin em-
bedded into the bony portion of the canal. The membrane is fairly 
taut, much like the head of a drum. Its shape is concave, curving 
slightly inward.
A schematic of the tympanic membrane is shown in Figure 2-15. 
There are two main sections of the tympanic membrane, the pars 
ﬂ accida and the pars tensa. The pars fl accida is the smaller and

more compliant section of the drum, located superiorly and con-
taining two layers of tissue. The pars tensa is the larger portion lo-
cated inferiorly. It contains four membranous layers and is stiffer 
than the pars fl accida.
The tympanic membrane is set into motion by acoustic pressure 
waves striking its surface. The membrane vibrates with a magni-
tude proportional to the intensity of the sound wave at a speed 
proportional to its frequency.
Middle Ear
The middle ear is an air-fi lled space located within the temporal 
bone of the skull. It contains the ossicular chain, which consists of 
three contiguous bones suspended in space, linking the tympanic 
membrane to the oval window of  the cochlea. The middle-ear 
structures function as an impedance matching device, providing a 
bridge between the airborne pressure waves striking the tympanic 
membrane and the fl uid-borne traveling waves of the cochlea.
Anatomy
The middle ear begins most laterally as the inner layers of  the 
 tympanic membrane. Beyond the tympanic membrane lies the 
middle-ear cavity. A schematic representation of the middle-ear 
cavity and its contents can be seen in Figure 2-14. The cavity is 
air-fi lled. Air in the cavity is kept at atmospheric pressure via the 
Eustachian tube, which leads from the cavity to the back of the 
throat. If air pressure changes suddenly, such as it does when as-
cending or descending in an airplane, the cavity will have rela-
tively more or less pressure than in the ear canal, and a feeling of 
fullness will result. Swallowing often opens the Eustachian tube, 
allowing the pressure to equalize.
Attached to the tympanic membrane is the ossicular chain 
 (Figure 2-16). The ossicular chain is a series of three small bones 
or ossicles. The ossicles, called the malleus, incus, and stapes, 
transfer the vibration of  the tympanic membrane to the inner 
ear or cochlea. The malleus consists of a long process called the 
 manubrium that is attached to the tympanic membrane and 
a head that is attached to the body of the incus. A short process 
or crus (leg) of the incus is fi tted into a recess in the wall of the 

60  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
 tympanic cavity. The long crus of the incus attaches to the head 
of the stapes. The stapes consists of a head and two crura that at-
tach to a footplate. The footplate is fitted into the oval window 
of the cochlear wall, held in place by the annular ligament. The 
ossicular chain is suspended in the middle-ear cavity by a num-
ber of ligaments, allowing it freedom to move in a predetermined 
manner. Two muscles also influence the ossicular chain, the 
tensor tympani muscle, which attaches to the malleus, and the 
stapedius muscle, which attaches to the stapes. Thus, when the 
tympanic membrane vibrates, the malleus moves with it, which 
vibrates the incus and, in turn, the stapes. The stapes footplate is 
loosely attached to the bony wall of the fluid-filled cochlea and 
transmits the vibration to the fl uid.
Physiology
Although it is by no means the entire story, the function of the 
middle ear can probably best be thought of as a means of match-
ing the energy transfer from air to fl uid. That is, the middle ear acts 
as an impedance matching transformer. Briefl y, the ease (or diffi culty) 
of energy fl ow is different through air than it is through fl uid. Pres-
sure waves propagating through air are substantively refl ected by

a fl uid-fi lled space because of the difference in which energy fl ows 
through the two media. The different impedances of these two me-
dia need somehow to be matched or the functional gap between 
them bridged. The ossicular chain serves this purpose.
Air pressure waves vibrate the tympanic membrane, which vi-
brates the ossicles and sets the fl uid of the cochlea into motion. 
If the middle ear did not exist, the air pressure waves would have 
to set the fl uid of the cochlea into motion directly, and a substan-
tial amount of energy would be lost in the process. Perhaps the 
best way to understand this is to understand that fi sh do not need 
a middle ear. Because the sounds that fish hear are propagated 
through water, the energy waves travel as fl uid motion and set the 
inner-ear fl uids into motion directly. Very little loss of energy re-
sults. But in humans, the energy waves are airborne and need to 
be transformed into mechanical energy before being converted to 
hydraulic energy. The mechanical energy of the middle ear serves 
as an effi cient energy converter from air to fl uid.
The middle ear is designed to accomplish this in several ways. 
First, there is a substantial area difference between the tympanic 
membrane and the oval window. This area difference serves much 
the same purpose as the head of a nail. Pressure applied on the 
large end results in substantially greater pressure at the narrow 
end. The ossicles also act as a lever, pivoting around the incudo-
malleolar joint, which contributes to an increase in vibrational 
amplitude at the stapes.
Inner Ear
The inner ear consists of the auditory and vestibular labyrinths. 
The term labyrinth is used to denote the intricate maze of connect-
ing pathways in the petrous portion of each temporal bone. The 
osseous labyrinth is the channel in the bone; the membranous labyrinth 
is composed of soft-tissue fl uid-fi lled channels within the osseous 
labyrinth that contain the end-organ structures of the hearing and 
vestibular systems. The auditory labyrinth is called the cochlea 
and is the sensory end-organ of hearing. It consists of fl uid-fi lled 
membranous channels within a spiral canal that encircles a bony 
central core. Here the sound waves, transformed into mechanical 
energy by the middle ear, set the fl uid of the cochlea into motion in 

62  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
a manner consistent with their intensity and frequency. Waves of 
fl uid motion impinge on the membranous labyrinth and set off a 
chain of events that results in neural impulses being generated at 
the VIIIth cranial nerve.
Anatomy
The cochlea is a fl uid-fi lled space within the temporal bone, which 
resembles the shape of a snail shell with 2.5 turns. An illustra-
tion of the bony labyrinth is shown in Figure 2-17. Suspended

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  63
The middle channel of the 
cochlear duct is called the 
scala media and is ﬁ lled 
with endolymph. 
The uppermost channel of 
the cochlear duct is called the 
scala vestibuli and is ﬁ lled 
with perilymph.
The lowermost channel of the 
cochlear duct is called the 
scala tympani and is ﬁ lled 
with perilymph.
Perilymph is cochlear ﬂ uid 
that is high in sodium and 
calcium.
The passage connecting 
the scala tympani and the 
scala vestibuli is called the 
helicotrema.
within this fl uid-fi lled space, or cochlear duct, is the membranous 
 labyrinth, which is another fl uid-fi lled space often referred to as 
the cochlear partition or scala media. An illustration of the mem-
branous labyrinth is shown in Figure 2-18.
The cochlear partition separates the scala vestibuli from the scala 
tympani, as shown in Figure 2-19. The scala vestibuli is the up-
permost of two perilymph-filled channels of the cochlear duct 
and terminates basally at the oval window. The scala tympani is the 
lowermost channel and terminates basally at the round  window. 
Both of these channels terminate at the apical end of the cochlea 
at the helicotrema.
The cochlear partition or scala media is an endolymph-fi lled 
channel that lies between the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. 
It is cordoned off  by two membranes. Reissner’s membrane 
serves as the cover of the partition, separating it from the scala 
vestibuli. The basilar membrane serves as the base of the partition,

separating it from the scala tympani. Riding on the basilar 
membrane is the organ of  Corti, which contains the sensory 
cells of hearing. Illustrations of the cochlear duct and organ of 
Corti are shown in Figures 2-20 and 2-21. It is obvious from 
the  latter illustration that the microstructure of  the organ of 
Corti is complex, containing numerous nutrient, supporting, 
and sensory cells.
There are two types of  sensory cells, both of  which are unique 
and very important to the function of hearing. These are termed 
the outer hair cells and inner hair cells. Outer hair cells are 
elongated in shape and have small hairs, or cilia, attached to 
their top. These cilia are embedded into the tectorial membrane, 
which covers the organ of  Corti. There are three rows of  outer 
hair cells throughout most of  the length of  the cochlea. The 
outer hair cells are innervated mostly by efferent, or motor, fi bers 
of the nervous system. There are about 13,000 outer hair cells 
in the cochlea. Outer hair cells and their innervation are shown 
in Figure 2-22.
Inner hair cells are also elongated and have an array of cilia on 
top. Inner hair cells stand in a single row, and their cilia are in 
proximity to, but not in direct contact with, the tectorial mem-
brane. The inner hair cells are innervated mostly by afferent, or 
sensory, fi bers of the nervous system. There are about 3,500 in-
ner hair cells in the cochlea. An illustration of inner hair cells is 
shown in Figure 2-23.

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  65
The blood supply to the inner ear structures is from arteries 
that branch from the vertebral arteries. The vertebral arteries 
course up both sides of  the vertebral column, enter the skull, 
and merge to form the basilar artery. One branch of the basilar 
artery is the internal auditory artery, also known as the labyrin-
thine artery. The internal auditory artery courses up through 
the internal auditory meatus, supplying blood to the auditory 
and vestibular portions of  the VIIIth cranial nerve and the fa-
cial (VIIth cranial) nerve. The artery then branches again into 
cochlear and vestibular arteries. The cochlear artery branches 
further to provide independent blood supply to the basal and 
apical turns of the cochlea.

66  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
Physiology
Vibration of the stapes in and out of the oval window creates fl uid 
motion in the cochlea, causing the structures of the membranous 
labyrinth to move, resulting in stimulation of the sensory cells 
and generation of neural impulses.
As the stapes moves in and out of the oval window vibrating the 
fl uid, the basilar membrane is set into a wavelike motion. This mo-
tion is referred to as the traveling wave and is depicted in Figure 2-24. 
This so-called traveling wave proceeds down the course of the basi-
lar membrane, growing in magnitude, until it reaches a certain 
point of maximum displacement. For higher frequencies, this oc-
curs closer to the oval window, nearer the basal end of the  cochlea. 
For lower frequencies, it occurs farther from the oval window, at 
the apical end of the cochlea. Thus, the basilar membrane is ar-
ranged tonotopically in that each frequency stimulates a different 
place along its course.

When the traveling wave reaches its point of maximum displace-
ment, the inner hair cells are stimulated, sending neural impulses 
to the auditory nerve.
The traveling wave by itself does not explain the extraordinary 
sensitivity and frequency selectivity of the cochlea. This concept

is illustrated in Figure 2-25. This fi gure shows the “tuning” of an 
inner hair cell versus the tuning that can be explained by the trav-
eling wave. Clearly some process must be intervening to turn the 
basilar membrane displacement by the traveling wave into a sen-
sitive, sharply tuned response at the inner hair cell.
The mechanism for this active process is beginning to be well 
understood. In brief, the sensitivity of  the inner hair cells is 
controlled to some extent by the outer hair cells. Recall that the 
outer hair cells are embedded in the tectorial membrane and 
that they receive most of  their innervation from efferent fibers 
of  the brain. It appears that low-intensity sounds trigger the

their sensitivity.
Regardless, when the traveling wave reaches its maximum 
 displacement, the inner hair cells are stimulated, resulting in the 
secretion of neurotransmitters that stimulate the nerve endings 
of the cochlear branch of the VIIIth nerve.
Where I Live: Seattle, Washington
Where I Work: University of  Washington. The Uni-
versity of Washington has a long history of training audi-
ologists and hearing scientists and is consistently ranked as 
one of the top fi ve graduate programs in the nation when 
it comes to graduate training programs in speech and hear-
ing. With a population of almost 45,000 students, the Univer-
sity of Washington is a large public education facility that is 
nestled between the Cascade Mountain Range and the Puget Sound.
What I Do: I am an associate professor who spends much of her time in the classroom, in 
the research laboratory, and writing/speaking for the many hearing-related professional or-
ganizations. I try to advance the fi eld of audiology by asking clinically related research ques-
tions that pertain to rehabilitating people with hearing loss. Although my approach to these 
research questions involves physiological methods, and most people think of me as a hearing 
scientist, I enjoy spending time in the classroom, conveying information about the many ways 
we can improve the quality of life for people with hearing loss. I am very grateful for the years 
I spent as a practicing clinician, and my current interactions with clinicians and patients, be-
cause they provide the foundation for the work I am doing today.
Why Audiology? Audiology is a career that I accidentally stumbled upon when deciding 
between medicine and teaching. Just as I suspected, it turned out to be the perfect blend of pa-
tient care and science. Because the nature of hearing loss impacts communication, the ability 
to improve people’s quality of life and teach people how to advocate for themselves is truly a 
gift that comes with the job.

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  71
Auditory Nervous System
The auditory nervous system is a primarily afferent system that 
transmits neural signals from the cochlea to the auditory cortex. 
Like other nervous system activity, the auditory mechanism is func-
tionally crossed, so that information from the right ear is transmit-
ted primarily to the left cortex and information from the left ear 
primarily to the right cortex.
The auditory system also has an efferent component, which has 
multiple functions, including regulation of the outer hair cells 
and general inhibitory action throughout the central auditory 
nervous system.
Neurons leave the cochlea in a rather orderly manner, as shown 
in Figure 2-26, and synapse in the lower brainstem. From that 
point on, the system becomes richly complex, with multiple 
crossing pathways and substantial efferent and intersensory 
interaction.
The VIIIth Cranial Nerve
Nerve fibers from the inner hair cells exit the organ of  Corti 
through the osseous spiral lamina beyond which their cell bod-
ies cluster to form the spiral ganglion in the modiolus. The 
nerve  fi bers exit the modiolus in an orderly manner, so that the 
frequency arrangement of the cochlea is preserved anatomically. 
This so-called tonotopic arrangement is preserved throughout 
the primary auditory pathways all the way to the cortex.
 The cochlear branch of the VIIIth cranial nerve exits the modio-
lus, joins the vestibular branch, and leaves the cochlea through 
the internal auditory canal of  the temporal bone. The cochlear 
branch of the nerve consists of some 30,000 nerve fi bers, which 
carry information to the brainstem.
The VIIIth nerve codes auditory information in several ways. 
In general, intensity is coded as the rate of  neural discharge. 
Frequency is coded as the place of  neural discharge by fibers 
that are arranged tonotopically. Frequency may be addition-
ally coded by temporal aspects of  the discharge patterns of 
neuronal firing.
Neurons are the basic 
unit of the nervous system 
containing axons, cell bodies, 
and dendrites.
A synapse is the point of 
communication between 
neurons.
The bony shelf in the cochlea 
onto which the inner margin 
of the membranous labyrinth 
attaches and through which 
the nerve ﬁ bers of the hair 
cells course is called the 
osseous spiral lamina.
The spiral ganglion is a 
collection of cell bodies of 
the auditory nerve ﬁ bers, 
clustered in the modiolus. 
The modiolus is the central 
bony pillar of the cochlea 
through which the blood 
vessels and nerve ﬁ bers of 
the labyrinth course.
Tonotopic means arranged 
according to frequency.

72  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
The Central Auditory Nervous System
The central auditory nervous system is best described by its various 
nuclei. Nuclei are bundles of cell bodies where nerve fi bers synapse. 
Each nucleus serves as a relay station for neural information from 
the cochlea and VIIIth nerve to other nuclei in the auditory ner-
vous system and to nuclei of other sensory and motor systems. 
The nuclei involved in the primary auditory pathway of the central 
auditory nervous system are:

• 
lateral lemniscus,
•

inferior colliculus, and
• 
medial geniculate.
• 
A schematic representation of these various way stations in the 
brain is shown in Figure 2-27.
All VIIIth-nerve fibers have an obligatory synapse at the cochlear 
 nucleus on the same, or ipsilateral, side of the brain. Fibers enter-
ing the cochlear nucleus bifurcate, with one fi ber synapsing in the 
primary auditory portion of the nucleus and the other synapsing in 
portions of the nucleus that spawn secondary or parallel pathways.
From the cochlear nucleus, approximately 75% of the nerve fi bers 
cross over to the contralateral side of the brain. Some fi bers ter-
minate on the media nucleus of the trapezoid body and some on the 
medial superior olive. Others proceed to nuclei beyond the superior 
olivary complex. Of the 25% that travel on the ipsilateral side of 
the brain, some terminate at the media superior olive, some at the 
lateral superior olive, and others at higher level nuclei.
From the superior olivary complex, neurons proceed to the lateral 
lemniscus, the inferior colliculus, and the medial geniculate. Nerve fi -
bers may synapse on any of these nuclei or proceed beyond. Also, 
at each of these nuclei, some fi bers cross over from the contral-
ateral side of the brain. From the medial geniculate, nerve fi bers 
proceed in a tract called the auditory radiations to the auditory cor-
tex in the temporal lobe.
The blood supply to the auditory nervous system is primarily from 
two sources: one that supplies the brainstem structures and the 
other the cortical structures. The auditory brainstem receives its 
primary blood supply from the basilar artery. Different branches 
of the basilar artery supply the various auditory nuclei:
anterior inferior cerbral artery – cochlear nucleus
• 
pontine arteries – superior olivary complex
• 
superior cerebellar artery – inferior colliculus and lateral 
• 
lemniscus
The auditory subcortex and cortex receive blood supply from a 
branch of the carotid artery known as the middle cerebral artery.
Ipsilateral pertains to the 
same side.
Bifurcate means to divide 
into two branches.
Contralateral pertains to 
the opposite side.

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  75
Processing of speech 
information occurs in the 
left temporal lobe in 
most people.
The corpus callosum 
is the white matter that 
connects the left and right 
hemispheres of the brain.
This simplifi ed explanation of the central auditory nervous  system 
belies its rich complexity. For example, sound that is processed 
through the right cochlea has multiple, redundant pathways to 
both the right and left cortices. What begins as a pressure wave 
striking the tympanic membrane sets into motion a complex series 
of neural responses spread throughout the auditory system.
Much of the rudimentary processing of sound begins in the lower 
brainstem. For example, initial processing for sound localization 
occurs at the superior olive complex where small differences be-
tween sound reaching the two ears are detected. As another 
example, a simple reflex arc that triggers a contraction of  the 
stapedius muscle occurs at the level of the cochlear nucleus. This 
acoustic refl ex occurs when sound reaches a certain loudness and 
causes the stapedius muscle to contract, resulting in a stiffening 
of the ossicular chain.
Processing of speech information occurs throughout the central 
auditory system. Its primary location for processing, however, oc-
curs in the left temporal lobe of most humans. Speech that is 
detected by the right ear proceeds through the dominant contral-
ateral auditory channels to the left temporal lobe. Speech that is 
detected by the left ear proceeds through the dominant contralat-
eral channel to the right cortex and then, via the corpus callosum 
to the left auditory cortex. Thus, in most humans, the right ear is 
dominant for the processing of speech information.
Our ability to hear relies on this very sophisticated series of struc-
tures that process sound. The pressure waves of sound are col-
lected by the pinna and funneled to the tympanic membrane by 
the external auditory canal. The tympanic membrane vibrates 
in response to the sound, which sets the ossicular chain into mo-
tion. The mechanical movement of the ossicular chain then sets 
the fl uids of the cochlea in motion, causing the hair cells on the 
basilar membrane to be stimulated. These hair cells send neural 
impulses through the VIIIth cranial nerve to the auditory brain-
stem. From the brainstem, networks of neurons act on the neural 
stimulation, sending signals to the auditory cortex.
Although the complexity of  these structures is remarkable, so 
too is the complexity of their function. All of this processing is 

76  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
obligatory and occurs constantly. The system is very sensitive in 
its ability to detect soft sounds, is very sensitive in its ability to de-
tect small changes in sound characteristics, and has a very large 
dynamic range. And when we call on our auditory system to do 
the complicated tasks of listening to speech, it does so even under 
extremely adverse acoustic conditions.
THE VESTIBULAR SYSTEM
The way we maintain our balance and equilibrium is through 
complex interaction of  the visual, somatosensory/propriocep-
tive, and vestibular systems of  the body. Although a complete 
treatment of balance function is beyond the scope of this intro-
ductory textbook, it is important for the student of audiology to 
understand the function of  the vestibular system and its rela-
tion to the auditory mechanism. One important reason is that 
the auditory and vestibular systems share the inner ear bony 
labyrinth, and the vestibular and auditory nerves join to form 
the VIIIth cranial nerve. As a result of this proximity, disorders 
often affect both systems, and knowledge of  their interaction 
is often helpful in the evaluative process. In addition, some au-
diologists are routinely involved in the assessment of  patients 
with balance disorders and evaluate vestibular function as part 
of that assessment.
The role of the balance systems is to provide accurate informa-
tion about our position in space and about the direction and 
speed of  our movement. It also serves to prevent falling by 
rapidly correcting for any changes that might occur in body 
position with respect to gravity. Finally, the system functions 
to control eye movement to maintain accurate vision during 
movement. Our ability to maintain balance is primarily the re-
sult of  three systems of  the body that work together. The con-
tributions of  the systems vary as a function of  what we are 
doing at the moment. For example, if we are standing still, pro-
prioception plays an important role, with vision helping out. 
The vestibular system rests relatively quietly. When we are in 
motion, however, the vestibular system contributes substan-
tially to our stability, with vision and proprioception playing a 
smaller role.
The range between the 
threshold of sensitivity and 
the threshold of discomfort is 
called the dynamic range.

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  77
The saccule and utricle 
are responsive to linear 
acceleration.
The superior, lateral, and 
posterior semicircular 
canals are three canals 
in the osseous labyrinth 
of the vestibular (balance) 
apparatus containing 
sensory epithelia that 
respond to angular motion.
Sensory epithelia are 
groups of sensory and 
supporting cells.
Anatomy
The vestibular portion of the inner ear also consists of a membra-
nous labyrinth within the fl uid-fi lled bony labyrinth of the tem-
poral bone. The membranous labyrinth consists of fi ve groups of 
sensory receptors: two otoliths and three semicircular canals. The 
two otoliths are known as the saccule and utricle. The three semi-
circular canals are known as the superior, lateral, and posterior 
semicircular canals. At the entrance to each of these canals is an 
enlarged portion of the tube called an ampulla. The vestibular 
labyrinth is shown in Figure 2-28. 
Like the auditory system, the sensory cells of the vestibular  system 
are known as hair cells. Each hair cell has a fi ber bundle protrud-
ing from the top known as stereocilia. Unlike the auditory sys-
tem, these stereocilia are bound together by a taller fi ber known 
as a kinocilium, as shown in Figure 2-29. The arrangements of 
sensory epithelia that provide input to the vestibular nerve are

known as the crista of the ampulla of each semicircular canal 
and the macula of each otolith. The arrangement of the sensory 
receptors is slightly different in the cristae and maculae.
The utricle is a membranous tube that plays a role in orientation to 
gravity and in horizontal movement. The saccule is an ovoid struc-
ture that is oriented in the vertical plane. The hair cells of the utricular 
macula and saccular macula are similar in organizational structure. 
Both are covered with a gelatinous membrane, the otolithic mem-
brane, that contains calcium carbonate crystals called otoconia. The 
otoconia give the otolithic membrane a density that is greater than the 
surrounding endolymph, making the hair cells sensitive to gravity.
The semicircular canals are arranged at right angles to each other 
and are responsible for detecting head movement. The ampullae are 
enlarged portions of the membranous tubes located at the entrance 
to each canal. Within each ampulla, the hair cells are arranged 
on the crista. The hair cells project into a gelatinous membrane 
called the cupula. Unlike the otolithic membrane, the cupula has a 
density that is the same as the surrounding endolymph, and the hair 
cells of the ampulae are not responsive to gravitational infl uences.
Nerve fi bers leave the maculae and the cristae through two branches 
of the vestibular nerve, the superior and inferior vestibular nerves. 
The superior vestibular nerve carries fi bers from the cristae of the 
superior and lateral semicircular canals and from the macula of 
the utricle. The inferior vestibular nerve carries fibers from the 
crista of the posterior canal and the macula of the saccule. The 
nerve fi bers meet at the lateral end of the internal auditory ca-
nal, with the cell bodies of the nerve clustering to form Scarpa’s 
ganglion. From there the nerve fibers join the auditory branch 
of the VIIIth cranial nerve and course through the internal au-
ditory canal. Upon entering the brainstem, the nerve divides into 
ascending and descending branches. Fibers eventually synapse at 
various vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum.
Physiology
The vestibular system acts as a motion detector. The utricle and 
 saccule are responsive to linear acceleration in the horizontal and 
vertical planes, respectively. The ampullae of the semicircular canals 
are responsive to angular acceleration. As the head turns or body

end of each of the three 
semicircular canals is called

80  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
moves, the fl uid in these structures fl ows in a direction opposite to the 
movement, resulting in stimulation of the sensory epithelium and in-
creased neural activity of the vestibular branch of the VIIIth nerve.
The vestibular hair cells are responsive to both movement and 
to the influences of gravity. The stereocilia of the hair cells are 
bundled with a kinocilium that is moved one way or the other by 
the relative motion of the otolithic membrane or the cupula. Any 
motion that causes the stereocilia to move toward the kinocilium 
results in an increase in electrical activity and has an excitatory 
infl uence on nerve function. Any motion that causes the stereo-
cilia to move away from the kinocilium results in a reduction in 
electrical activity and has an inhibitory infl uence on nerve func-
tion. This relationship is depicted in Figure 2-30.

Psychoacoustics is the 
branch of psychophysics 
concerned with the 
quantiﬁ cation of auditory 
sensations and the 
measurement of the 
psychological correlates of 
the physical characteristics 
of sound.
The structures of the vestibular system essentially work in pairs 
to provide information about gravity and movement. When the 
head is turned, fl uid in the structures on one side move in opposite 
direction to fl uid on the other side. This results in corresponding 
excitatory and inhibitory signals presented to the vestibular nu-
clei for comparison.
HOW WE HEAR
As mentioned previously, the auditory system is an obligatory one. 
We simply cannot turn it off. In simpler life forms, the main func-
tion of the auditory system is protection. Because it is obligatory, 
it serves to constantly assess the surroundings for danger, as prey, 
and opportunity, as predator. In more evolved life forms, it takes 
on an increasingly important communication function, whether 
that be for mating calls or for talking on the telephone.
As you have seen, the auditory system is highly complex. It is a 
sensitive system that can detect the smallest of pressure waves. It 
also is a precise system that can effectively discriminate very small 
changes in the nature of sound, with a large dynamic range. Re-
member that the difference in the magnitude of sound that can 
just barely be detected and the magnitude of sound that causes 
pain is on the order of 100 million to one.
Describing the function of such a rich, complex system is an academic 
discipline in and of itself, called psychoacoustics. Psychoacoustics 
is a branch of psychophysics concerned with the quantifi cation of 
auditory sensation and the measurement of the psychological cor-
relates of the physical characteristics of sound. The knowledge base 
of this fi eld is broad and well beyond the scope of this text. However, 
there are some fundamentals that are necessary for you to under-
stand as you pursue the study of clinical audiology. Much in the way 
of quantifi cation of disordered systems stems from our knowledge 
of the response of normal systems and the techniques designed to 
measure those responses.
Absolute Sensitivity of Hearing
As you will learn later in this textbook, one of  the hallmarks 
of audiology is the assessment of hearing sensitivity. Sensitivity 
is defined as the capacity of a sense organ to detect a stimulus. 

82  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
Differential threshold is 
the smallest difference that 
can be detected between 
two signals.
It is quantifi ed by the determination of threshold of audibility or 
threshold of  detection of change. There are at least two kinds of 
sensitivity, absolute and differential. Absolute sensitivity per-
tains to the capacity of the auditory system to detect faint sound. 
Differential sensitivity pertains to the capacity of the auditory 
system to detect differences or changes in intensity, frequency, or 
some other dimension of a sound.
Hearing sensitivity most commonly refers to absolute sensitivity 
to faint sound. In contrast, hearing acuity most accurately refers 
to the differential sensitivity, usually to the ability to detect differ-
ences in signals that differ in the frequency domain.
Inherent in the description of  hearing sensitivity is the notion 
of  threshold. A threshold is the level at which a stimulus or 
change in stimulus is just suffi cient to produce a sensation or an 
effect. Here again, it is useful to differentiate between absolute 
and differential threshold. In hearing, absolute threshold is the 
threshold of audibility, or the lowest intensity level at which an 
acoustic signal can be detected. It is usually defi ned as the level 
at which a sound can be heard 50% of  the times that it is pre-
sented. Differential threshold, or difference limen, is the smallest 
difference that can be detected between two signals that vary in 
some physical dimension.
The Nature of Hearing Sensitivity
Absolute sensitivity of hearing for humans varies as a function of 
numerous factors, including psychophysical technique, whether 
ears are tested separately or together, whether testing is done 
under earphones or in a sound fi eld, the type of earphone that is 
used, the type of cushion on that earphone, and so on. Once these 
variables are defi ned and controlled, a consistent picture of hear-
ing sensitivity emerges.
Figure 2-31 shows a graph of hearing sensitivity, defi ned as the 
threshold of  audibility of  pure-tone signals, graphed in sound 
pressure level (SPL) across a frequency range that encompasses 
most of human hearing. This curve representing hearing sensitiv-
ity is often referred to as the minimum audibility curve. The mini-
mum audibility curve is clearly not a straight line, indicating that 
Absolute sensitivity is 
the ability to detect faint 
sound.
Differential sensitivity 
is the ability to detect 
differences or changes in 
intensity, frequency, or other 
dimensions of sound.
Threshold is the level at 
which a stimulus is just 
sufﬁ cient to produce a 
sensation.
Absolute threshold is 
the lowest level at which a 
sound can be detected.

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  83
hearing sensitivity varies as a function of signal frequency. That is, 
it takes more sound pressure at some frequencies to reach thresh-
old than at others. You can see that hearing in the low-frequency 
and high-frequency ranges is not as sensitive as it is in the mid-
frequency range. It should probably be no surprise that human 
audibility thresholds are best at frequencies corresponding to the 
most important components of speech.
The minimum audibility curve will vary as a function of measure-
ment parameters. If it is determined by delivering signals to one 
ear via an earphone, it is referred to as the minimum auditory pres-
sure response. If it is determined by delivering signals to both ears 
via loudspeaker, it is called the minimum audible fi eld response.
Also shown on Figure 2-31 is the threshold of feeling, at which 
a tactile response will occur if the subject can tolerate sounds of 
this magnitude. This is the upper limit of hearing and has a clearly 
fl atter profi le across the frequency range. The area between the

the auditory response area and represents the range of  human 
hearing. You will notice that the range varies as a function of 
frequency, so that the number of decibels of difference between 
audibility and feeling is substantially less at the low frequencies 
than at the high frequencies.
The minimum audible pressure curve serves as the basis for pure-
tone audiometry, in which a patient’s threshold of audibility is mea-
sured and compared to this normal curve. For clinical purposes, 
this curve is converted into a graph known as the audiogram.
The Audiogram
The audiogram is a graphic representation of the threshold of 
audibility across the audiometric frequency range. It is a plot of 
absolute threshold, designated in dB hearing level (HL), at octave or 
mid-octave intervals from 125 to 8000 Hz.
The designation of intensity in dB HL is an important one to un-
derstand. Recall from the minimum audibility curve that hearing 
sensitivity varies as a function of frequency. For clinical purposes, 
this curve is simply converted into a straight line and called audio-
metric zero. Audiometric zero is the sound pressure level at which 
the threshold of audibility occurs in average normal listeners. We 
know from the minimum audibility curve that the SPL required to 
reach threshold will vary as a function of frequency. If a standard 
SPL level is applied at each frequency, and threshold for the aver-
age normal listener is designated as 0 dB HL for each frequency, 
then we have effectively fl attened out the curve and represented 
average normal hearing sensitivity as a fl at line of 0 dB.
The concept of designating audiometric zero as different sound 
pressure levels across the frequency range is shown in Figure 2-32. 
Here you see the average normal threshold values, or audiometric 
zero plotted in SPL. When this curve is fl attened by designating each 
of these levels as 0 dB HL and then the entire graph is fl ipped over, 
an audiogram results. The conversion is shown in Figure 2-33.
Figure 2-34 is an audiogram. The abscissa on the graph is fre-
quency in Hz. It is divided into octave intervals, ranging from

250 Hz to 8000 Hz. The ordinate on the graph is signal intensity 
in dB HL. It is divided into 10 dB segments, usually ranging from 
−10 dB to 120 dB HL. Typically on an audiogram, the HL will be 
further referenced to a standard, such as ANSI 2004. This stan-
dard, from the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), 
relates to the SPL assigned to 0 dB HL, depending on the type of 
earphone and cushion used.
An audiogram will usually also have a shaded area, designating 
the range of normal hearing. You will learn in the next section 

86  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
that there is some variability in determining hearing threshold and 
that normal responses can vary by as many as 10 decibels around 
audiometric zero. It is not uncommon then to have a shaded range 
from −10 to +10 dB to designate the normal range of hearing. On 
some audiograms, that range will be extended to 25 dB or so. This 
idea defi nes the normal range not in statistical terms, but in some 
notion of functional terms. The assumption here would be that, for 
example, 20 dB is not enough of a hearing loss to be considered 
meaningful, therefore it should be classifi ed as normal. As you will 
learn in subsequent chapters, impairment cannot be defined by 
the audiogram alone, and increasingly the shaded range is either 
being defi ned by a statistical approach or being eliminated.
An audiogram is obtained by carrying out pure-tone audiom-
etry to determine threshold of audibility. The techniques used to

do this are described in detail in Chapter 6. Basically, signals are 
presented, and the patient responds to those that are audible. The 
level at which the patient can just barely detect the presence of a 
pure-tone signal 50% of the time is determined. That level is then 
marked on the audiogram. Figure 2-35 shows the audiogram of 
someone with normal hearing. Note that all of the symbols fall 
within the normal range. Figure 2-36 shows the audiogram of 
someone with a hearing loss. Note that, at each frequency, the 
intensity of the signal had to be increased signifi cantly before it 
became audible. This represents a hearing sensitivity loss as a 
function of the normal, audiometric zero range.
There are two main ways to deliver signals to the ear, and they 
are plotted separately on the audiogram. One way is by the use 
of earphones. Here signals are presented through the air to the

tympanic membrane and middle ear to the cochlea. Signals 
presented in this manner are considered air-conducted, and 
thresholds are called air-conduction thresholds. The other way 
is by use of  a bone vibrator. Signals are delivered via a vibra-
tor, usually placed on the forehead or on the mastoid process 
behind the ear, through the bones of  the skull directly to the 
cochlea. Signals presented in this manner are considered bone-
conducted, and thresholds are called bone-conduction thresh-
olds. Because bone-conducted signals bypass the outer and 
middle ear, thresholds determined by bone conduction repre-
sent sensitivity of the cochlea. When the outer and middle ears 
are functioning normally, air-conduction and bone-conduction 
thresholds are the same, as shown in Figure 2-37. If there is a 
hearing loss of cochlear origin, a so-called sensorineural hear-
ing loss, then both air and bone conduction thresholds will be

affected similarly, as shown in Figure 2-38. When the outer or 
middle ears are not functioning normally, the intensity of  the 
air-conducted signals must be raised before threshold is reached, 
although the bone-conduction thresholds will remain  normal, 
as shown in Figure 2-39. You will learn more about this type of 
conductive hearing loss in the next chapter.
Differential Sensitivity
Differential sensitivity is the capacity of the auditory system to 
detect change in intensity, frequency, or some other dimension of 
sound. It is usually measured as the differential threshold or dif-
ference limen (DL), defi ned as the smallest change in a stimulus 
that is detectable. When we measure absolute threshold, we are 
trying to determine the presence or absence of a stimulus.

When we measure differential threshold, we are trying to deter-
mine how small a change in some parameter of the signal can be 
detected. Another term that is often used to describe differential 
threshold is just noticeable difference, a term that accurately de-
scribes the perception that is being measured.
The difference limens for intensity and frequency have been stud-
ied extensively. A typical paradigm for determining difference 
 limen would be to present a standard stimulus of a given inten-
sity, followed by a variable stimulus of a slightly different intensity. 
The intensity of the variable stimulus would be manipulated over 
a series of trials until a determination was made of the intensity

level at which a difference could be detected. An example of the 
difference limen for intensity is shown in Figure 2-40. The differ-
ence limen for intensity varies little across frequency. However, 
it is  signifi cantly poorer at levels near absolute threshold than at 
higher intensity levels.
An example of  the difference limen for frequency is shown in 
 Figure 2-41. In general, the difference limen for frequency in-
creases with increasing frequency, so that a larger change is re-
quired at higher frequencies than at lower frequencies. As with 
intensity, the ability to detect changes becomes significantly 
poorer at intensity levels near absolute threshold.

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  93
An audiometer is an 
electronic instrument used to 
measure hearing sensitivity.
Earlier you learned about the physical properties of  intensity 
and frequency of  an acoustic signal. The psychological cor-
relates of  these physical measures of  sound are loudness and 
pitch, respectively.
Loudness refers to the perception that occurs at different sound 
intensities. Low intensity sounds are perceived as soft sounds, 
while high intensity sounds are perceived as loud sounds. As in-
tensity increases, so too does the perception of loudness.
Pitch refers to the perception that occurs at different sound fre-
quencies. Low-frequency sounds are perceived as low in pitch, and 
high-frequency sounds as high in pitch. As frequency increases, 
so does the perception of pitch.
Understanding of these basic aspects of hearing, absolute threshold, 
differential threshold, and perception of pitch and loudness, is, of 
course, only the beginning of understanding the full nature of 
how we hear. Once sound is audible, the auditory mechanism is 
capable of processing complex speech signals, often in the pres-
ence of similar, yet competing, background noise. The auditory 
system’s ability to process changes in intensity and frequency in 
rapid sequence to perceive speech is truly a remarkable processing 
accomplishment.
Measurement of Sound
The accurate measurement of  sound is an important compo-
nent of  hearing assessment. The standard audiogram is a plot 
of  frequency versus intensity. The intensity level is referenced 
to a standard sound pressure level. Specifi cations for this sound 
pressure level are based on internationally accepted standards. 
To meet those standards, the instrumentation that produces the 
signals, the  audiometer, must do so in an accurate and consis-
tent manner.
The output of any audiometer is periodically checked to ensure 
that it meets calibration standards. An audiometer is considered to 
be calibrated if the pure tones and other signals emanating from 
the earphones are equal to the standard levels set by the American 
National Standards Institute or the International Organization for 
Intensity translates to the 
perception of loudness.

94  CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING
Standardization (ISO). To ensure calibration, the output must be 
measured. The instrument used to measure the output is called a 
sound level meter.
A sound level meter is an electronic instrument designed specifi -
cally for the measurement of acoustic signals. For audiometric 
purposes, the components of a sound level meter include:
a standard coupler to which an earphone can be attached,
• 
a sensitive microphone to convert sound from acoustical to 
• 
electrical energy,
an amplifi er to boost the low-level signal from the 
• 
microphone,
adjustable attenuators to focus in on the intensity range of 
• 
the signal,
fi ltering networks to focus in on the frequency range of the 
• 
signal, and
a meter to display the measured sound pressure level.
• 
As you might expect, all of  these components must meet cer-
tain specifi cations as well to ensure that the sound level meter 
maintains its accuracy. Sound level meters are used for pur-
poses other than audiometric calibration. Importantly, sound 
level meters are used to measure noise in the environment and 
are an important component of  industrial noise measurement 
and control.
For audiometric calibration purposes, the sound level meter is 
used to measure the accuracy of  the output of  the audiometer 
through its transducers, either earphones or a bone-conduction 
vibrator. The process is one of  placing the earphone or vibra-
tor onto the standard coupler and turning on the pure tone or 
other signal at a specifi ed level. The sound level meter is set to 
an intensity and frequency range, and the output level of  the 
earphone is read from the meter. The output is expressed in 
dB SPL. Standard output levels for audiometric zero have been 
 established for the earphones that are commonly used in audio-
metric testing. If the output measured by the sound level meter 
is equal to the standard output, then the audiometer is in cali-
bration. If it is not in calibration, the output of the audiometer

shown in Table 2-2 for two common types of earphones, supra-
aural and insert earphones. You will learn more about the audi-
ometer and earphones in Chapter 6.

Summary
Sound is a common type of energy that occurs as a result of 
• 
pressure waves that emanate from some force being applied to 
a sound source. A sine wave is a graphic way of representing 
the pressure waves of sound.
The magnitude of a sound is described as its intensity. Intensity is 
• 
related to the perception of loudness. Intensity is expressed in deci-
bels sound pressure level, or dB SPL. One of the most common ref-
erents for decibels in audiometry is known as hearing level (HL), 
which represents decibels according to average  normal hearing.
Frequency is the speed of vibration and is related to the percep-
• 
tion of pitch. Frequency is usually expressed in cycles-per-second 
or Hertz (Hz).
The physical processing of acoustic information occurs in three 
• 
groups of structures, commonly known as the outer, middle, 
and inner ears.
The outer ear has three main components: the auricle, the ear 
• 
canal or meatus, and the outer layer of the eardrum or tympanic 
membrane. The outer ear serves to collect and resonate sound, 
assist in sound localization, and function as a protective mecha-
nism for the middle ear.
The middle ear is an air-fi lled space located within the temporal 
• 
bone of the skull. It contains the ossicular chain, which consists 
of three contiguous bones suspended in space, linking the tym-
panic membrane to the oval window of the cochlea. The middle 
ear structures act as an impedance matching device, providing a 
bridge between the airborne pressure waves striking the tympanic 
membrane and the fl uid-borne traveling waves of the cochlea.
The inner ear contains the cochlea, which is the sensory end-
• 
organ of  hearing. The cochlea consists of  fluid-filled mem-
branous channels within a spiral canal that encircles a bony 
central core. Here the sound waves, transformed into mechani-
cal energy by the middle ear, set the fl uid of the cochlea into mo-
tion in a manner consistent with their intensity and frequency. 
Waves of fl uid motion impinge on the membranous labyrinth 
and set off a chain of events that result in neural impulses be-
ing generated at the VIIIth cranial nerve.

CHAPTER 2  THE NATURE OF HEARING  97
The auditory nervous system is primarily an afferent system 
• 
that transmits neural signals from the cochlea to the auditory 
cortex. Neurons leave the cochlea via the VIIIth nerve in an or-
derly manner and synapse in the lower brainstem. From that 
point on, the system becomes richly complex, with multiple 
crossing pathways and plenty of opportunity for efferent and 
intersensory interaction.
Absolute threshold of hearing is the threshold of audibility, or 
• 
the lowest intensity level at which an acoustic signal can be 
detected.
The standard audiogram is a plot of absolute threshold, desig-
• 
nated in dB HL, at octave or mid-octave intervals from 125 to 
8000 Hz. The intensity level is referenced to a standard sound 
pressure level. Specifi cations for this sound pressure level are 
based on internationally accepted standards.

THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  101
HEARING disorder results from a number of causes and is usu-
ally characterized by the type and degree of hearing loss. Type 
of  hearing loss is related to the site of  the disorder within the 
auditory system, and degree of loss is related to the extent that 
the disorder is infringing on normal function. Defi ning both the 
type and degree of  hearing loss is a cornerstone of  audiology. 
This chapter covers types of hearing disorder and their functional 
consequences.
TYPES OF HEARING DISORDER
Hearing disorders are of two major types:
hearing sensitivity loss, and
• 
suprathreshold hearing disorders.
• 
Hearing sensitivity loss is the most common form of hearing disor-
der. It is characterized by a reduction in the sensitivity of the audi-
tory mechanism so that sounds need to be of higher intensity than 
normal before they are perceived by the listener. Suprathreshold dis-
orders are less common, may or may not include hearing sensitivity 
loss, and often result in reduced ability to perceive speech properly. 
A third type is known as functional hearing loss. Functional hearing 
loss is the exaggeration or fabrication of a hearing loss.
In addition to type of loss, a hearing disorder can be described in 
terms of time of onset, time course, and whether one or both ears 
is involved.
Describe the differences between hearing 
• 
sensitivity loss and suprathreshold hearing 
disorders.
Explain the breakdown of function in the 
• 
various types of hearing sensitivity losses 
(conductive, sensorineural, and mixed).
Explain the consequences of each type of 
• 
hearing sensitivity loss.

factors that play a role in the impact of 
hearing impairment on communication.

102  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
A hearing disorder can be described by the time of onset:
• congenital: 
present at birth
• acquired: 
obtained after birth
• adventitious: 
not congenital; acquired after birth
Hearing disorder can also be described by its time course:
• acute: 
of sudden onset and short duration
• chronic: 
of long duration
• sudden: 
having a rapid onset
• gradual: 
occurring in small degrees
• temporary: 
of limited duration
• permanent: 
irreversible
• progressive: 
advancing in degree
• fl uctuating: 
aperiodic change in degree
In addition, hearing disorder can be described by the number of 
ears involved:
• unilateral: 
pertaining to one ear only
• bilateral: 
pertaining to both ears
Hearing Sensitivity Loss
The major cause of hearing disorder is a loss of hearing sensitivity. 
A loss of hearing sensitivity means that the ear is not as sensitive 
as normal in detecting sound. Stated another way, sounds must be 
of a higher intensity than normal to be perceived.
Hearing sensitivity loss is caused by an abnormal reduction 
of  sound being delivered to the brain by a disordered ear. This 
reduction of  sound can result from a number of  factors that 
affect the outer, middle, or inner ears. When sound is not con-
ducted well through a disordered outer or middle ear, the result 
is a  conductive hearing loss. When the sensory or neural cells or 
their connections within the cochlea are absent or not functioning, 
A conductive hearing 
loss is a reduction in hearing 
sensitivity due to a disorder 
of the outer or middle ear.

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  103
the result is a sensorineural hearing loss. When structures of 
both the conductive mechanism and the cochlea are disordered, 
the result is a mixed hearing loss.
A sensorineural hearing loss can also be caused by a disorder of 
the VIIIth nerve or auditory brainstem. That is, a tumor on the 
VIIIth nerve or a space-occupying lesion in the brainstem can 
result in a loss of hearing sensitivity that will be classifi ed as sen-
sorineural, rather than conductive or mixed. Generally, however, 
such disorders are treated separately as retrocochlear disorders, 
because their diagnosis, treatment, and impact on hearing abil-
ity can differ substantially from a sensorineural hearing loss of 
cochlear origin.
Conductive Hearing Loss
A conductive hearing loss is caused by an abnormal reduction or 
attenuation of sound as it travels from the outer ear to the co-
chlea. You will recall that the outer ear serves to collect, direct, 
and enhance sound to be delivered to the tympanic membrane. 
The tympanic membrane and other structures of the middle ear 
transform acoustic energy into mechanical energy in order to 
serve as a bridge from the air pressure waves in the ear canal to 
the motion of fl uid in the cochlea. These outer and middle-ear sys-
tems can be thought of collectively as a conductive mechanism, or 
one that conducts sound from the atmosphere to the cochlea.
If a structure of the conductive mechanism is in some way impaired, 
its ability to conduct sound is reduced, resulting in less sound being 
delivered to the cochlea. Thus, the effect of any disorder of the outer 
or middle ear is to reduce or attenuate the energy that reaches the 
cochlea. In this way, a soft sound that is perceptible by a normal ear 
might not be of suffi cient magnitude to overcome the conductive 
defi cit and reach the cochlea. Only when the intensity of this sound 
is increased can it overcome the conductive barrier.
Perhaps the simplest way to think of a conductive hearing loss is 
by placing earplugs into your ear canals. Sounds that would nor-
mally enter the ear canal are attenuated by the earplugs, result-
ing in reduced hearing sensitivity. The only way to hear the sound 
normally is to get closer to its source or to raise its volume.
A sensorineural hearing 
loss is a reduction in 
hearing sensitivity due to a 
disorder of the inner ear.
A mixed hearing loss 
is a reduction in hearing 
sensitivity due to a 
combination of a disordered 
outer or middle and inner ear.
A lesion is the structural or 
functional pathologic change 
in body tissue.
A retrocochlear lesion 
results from damage to the 
neural structures of the 
auditory system beyond the 
cochlea.
Attenuation means a 
decrease in magnitude.

104  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
A conductive hearing loss or the conductive component of a hear-
ing loss is best measured by comparing air- and bone-conduction 
thresholds on an audiogram. Air-conduction thresholds repre-
sent hearing sensitivity as measured through the outer, middle, 
and inner ears. Bone-conduction thresholds represent hearing 
sensitivity as measured primarily through the inner ear. Thus, 
if  air-conduction thresholds are poorer than bone-conduction 
thresholds, it can be assumed that the attenuation of sound is oc-
curring at the level of the outer or middle ears.
An example of a conductive hearing loss is shown in Figure 3-1. 
Note that bone-conduction thresholds are at or near audiometric 
zero, but air-conduction thresholds require higher intensity levels 
before threshold is reached. The ear is acting as if the sound  being 
Audiometric zero is the 
lowest level at which normal 
hearers can detect a sound.

delivered has been attenuated by, in this case, 30 dB. The size of 
the conductive component, often referred to as the air-bone gap, is 
described as the difference between the air- and bone-conduction 
thresholds. In this case, the conductive component to the hearing 
loss is 30 dB.
A conductive hearing loss is often described by its degree and au-
diometric confi guration. The degree is the size of the conductive 
component and relates to the extent or severity of the disorder 
causing the hearing loss. As you will learn in Chapter 4, a number 
of disorders of the outer and middle ears can cause conductive 
hearing loss. Whether the disorder causes a conductive hearing 
loss and the degree of the loss that it causes are based on many 
factors related to the impact of the disorder on the functioning of 
the various parts of the conductive mechanism.
Audiometric configuration of  a conductive hearing loss varies 
from low frequency to flat to high frequency depending on 
the physical obstruction of  the structures of  the conductive 
mechanism. In general, any disorder that adds mass to the 
conductive system will differentially affect the higher audiometric 
frequencies; any disorder that adds or reduces stiffness to the 
system will affect the lower audiometric frequencies. Any disorder 
that changes both mass and stiffness will affect a broad range of 
audiometric frequencies.
Because a conductive hearing loss acts primarily as an attenuator 
of sound, it has little or no impact on suprathreshold hearing. That 
is, once sound is of a suffi cient intensity, the ear acts as it normally 
would at suprathreshold intensities. Thus, perception of loudness, 
ability to discriminate loudness and pitch changes, and speech-
recognition ability are all normal once the conductive hearing loss 
is overcome by raising the intensity of the signal.
Sensorineural Hearing Loss
A sensorineural hearing loss is caused by a failure in the co-
chlear transduction of  sound from mechanical energy in the 
middle ear to neural impulses in the VIIIth nerve. You will recall 
that the  cochlea is a highly specialized sensory receptor organ 
that converts hydraulic fl uid movement, caused by mechanical 
An attenuator is 
something that reduces or 
decreases the magnitude.

106  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
energy from stapes movement, into electrical potentials in the 
nerve endings on the hair cells of the organ of Corti. The intri-
cate sensory system composed of receptor cells that convert this 
fl uid movement into electrical potentials contains both sensory 
and neural elements.
When a structure of this sensorineural mechanism is in some way 
damaged, its ability to transduce mechanical energy into electrical 
energy is reduced. This results in a number of changes in cochlear 
processing, including:
a reduction in the sensitivity of the cochlear receptor cells,
• 
a reduction in the frequency-resolving ability of the 
• 
cochlea, and
a reduction in the dynamic range of the hearing 
• 
mechanism.
A sensorineural hearing loss is most often characterized clinically 
by its effect on cochlear sensitivity and, thus, the audiogram. If the 
outer and middle ears are functioning properly, then air-conduction 
thresholds accurately represent the sensitivity of the cochlea and are 
equal to bone-conduction thresholds. An example of a sensorineu-
ral hearing loss is shown in Figure 3-2. Note that air-conduction 
thresholds match bone-conduction thresholds, and both require 
higher intensity levels than normal before threshold is reached.
A sensorineural hearing loss is often described by its degree and 
audiometric confi guration. The degree is based on the range of 
decibel loss and relates to the extent or severity of the disorder 
causing the hearing loss. As you will learn in Chapter 4, a num-
ber of disorders of the cochlea and peripheral auditory nervous 
system can cause sensorineural hearing loss. Whether the disor-
der causes a sensorineural hearing loss, and the degree of the loss 
that it causes, is based on many factors relating to the impact of 
the disorder on the functioning of the various components of the 
sensorineural mechanism.
Audiometric confi guration of a sensorineural hearing loss varies 
from low frequency to fl at to high frequency depending on the loca-
tion along the basilar membrane of hair cell loss or other damage. 

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  107
Various causes of sensorineural hearing loss have characteristic 
confi gurations, which will be shown later in this section.
The complexity of a sensorineural hearing loss tends to be greater 
than that of a conductive hearing loss because of its effects on 
frequency resolution and dynamic range. Recall that one im-
portant processing component of cochlear function is to provide 
fi ne tuning of the auditory system in the frequency domain. The 
broadly tuned traveling wave of cochlear fl uid is converted into 
fi nely tuned neural processing of the VIIIth nerve by the active 
processes of the outer hair cells of the organ of Corti. One effect 
of the loss of these hair cells is a reduction in the sensitivity of the 
system. Another is broadening of the frequency-resolving ability. 
An example is shown in Figure 3-3.

resolving ability of the auditory system following outer 
hair cell loss. The thick line represents normal tuning; the 
thin line represents reduced tuning capacity.
Another important effect of cochlear hearing loss is that it reduces 
the dynamic range of cochlear function. Recall that the auditory 
system’s range of perception from threshold of sensitivity to pain 
is quite wide. Unlike a conductive hearing loss, a sensorineural 
hearing loss reduces sensitivity to low intensity sounds but has lit-
tle effect on perception of high intensity sounds. The relationship 
is shown in Figure 3-4. A normal dynamic range exceeds 100 dB; 
the dynamic range of an ear with sensorineural hearing loss can 
be considerably smaller.
Because of  these complex changes in cochlear processing, a 
sensorineural hearing loss can have a significant impact on

suprathreshold hearing. That is, even when sound is of  a suf-
ficient intensity, the ear does not necessarily act as it normally 
would at suprathreshold intensities. Thus, for example, speech 
recognition ability does not necessarily return to normal at in-
tensity levels sufficient to overcome the sensitivity loss.
Mixed Hearing Loss
A hearing loss that has both a sensorineural component and 
a conductive component is considered a mixed hearing loss. A 
mixed hearing loss results when sound being delivered to an im-
paired cochlea is attenuated by a disordered outer or middle ear.
Figure 3-5 shows an example of  a mixed hearing loss. Bone-
conduction thresholds reflect the degree and configuration of 
the sensorineural component of the hearing loss. Air-conduction 
thresholds refl ect both the sensorineural loss and an additional 
conductive component.
The causes of mixed hearing loss are numerous and varied. In 
some cases, a mixed loss is simply the addition of a conductive

hearing loss, due for example to active middle-ear disease, to a 
longstanding sensorineural hearing loss of unrelated etiology. In 
other cases, the disease process causing middle-ear disorder can 
also cause cochlear disorder and results in a mixed hearing loss 
of common origin. The causes of mixed hearing loss will be de-
scribed in more detail in Chapter 4.
Suprathreshold Hearing Disorder
Although there is a tendency to think of hearing disorder as the 
sensitivity loss that can be measured on an audiogram, there are 
other types of hearing disorders that may or may not be accompa-
nied by sensitivity loss. These other disorders result from disease or 
damage to the central auditory nervous system in adults, or delayed 
or disordered auditory nervous system development in children.
The etiology of a hearing 
loss is its cause.

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  111
A disordered auditory nervous system, regardless of cause, will 
have functional consequences that can vary from subclinical to 
a substantial, easily measurable auditory deficit. Although the 
functional consequences may be similar, we tend to divide audi-
tory nervous system disorders into two groups, depending on the 
nature of the underlying disorder.
 1. When a disorder is caused by an active, measurable 
disease process, such as a tumor or other space-
occupying lesion, or from damage due to trauma or 
stroke, it is often referred to as a retrocochlear disorder. 
That is, retrocochlear disorders result from structural 
 lesions of the nervous system.
 2. When a disorder is due to developmental dysfunction or 
delay or from diffuse changes such as the aging process, it 
is often referred to as a auditory processing disorder. That 
is, auditory processing disorders results from “functional 
 lesions” of the nervous system.
The consequences of both types of disorder can be remarkably 
similar from a hearing perspective, but they are treated differently 
because of the consequences of diagnosis and the likelihood of a 
signifi cant residual communication disorder.
Retrocochlear Hearing Disorder
A retrocochlear disorder is caused by a change in neural struc-
ture and function of some component of the peripheral or central 
auditory nervous system. As a general rule, the more peripheral 
a lesion, the greater its impact will be on auditory function. Con-
versely, the more central the lesion, the more subtle its impact will 
be. One might conceptualize this by thinking of the nervous sys-
tem as a large oak tree. If you were to damage one of its many 
branches, overall growth of the tree would be affected only sub-
tly. Damage its trunk, however, and the impact on the entire tree 
could be signifi cant. A well-placed tumor on the auditory nerve 
can substantially impact hearing, whereas a lesion in the  midbrain 
is likely to have more subtle effects.
A retrocochlear lesion may or may not affect auditory sensitiv-
ity. This will depend on many factors, including lesion size, loca-
tion, and impact. A tumor on the VIIIth cranial nerve can cause 

112  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
a  substantial sensorineural hearing loss, depending on how 
much pressure it places on the nerve, the damage that it causes 
to the nerve, or the extent to which it interrupts cochlear func-
tion. A tumor in the temporal lobe, however, is quite unlikely to 
result in any change in hearing sensitivity. This relationship is 
shown in Figure 3-6.
More subtle hearing disorders from retrocochlear disease are  often 
noted in measures of suprathreshold function such as speech 
recognition ability. Using various measures that stress the audi-
tory system, the audiologist can detect some of the more subtle 
changes resulting from retrocochlear lesions.
Speech recognition is 
the ability to perceive and 
identify speech.

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  113
Auditory Processing Disorder
Disorders of  central auditory nervous system function occur 
 primarily in two populations:
young children and
• 
the elderly.
• 
APD in Children. The vast majority of childhood auditory pro-
cessing disorders do not result from documented neuropathologic 
conditions. Rather, they present as communication problems that 
resemble hearing sensitivity loss. The specifi c hearing disorder is 
related to an idiopathic dysfunction of the central auditory ner-
vous system and is commonly referred to as auditory processing 
disorder. Although the auditory symptoms and clinical fi ndings 
in children with APD may mimic those of children with auditory 
disorders due to discrete pathology in the central auditory ner-
vous system, they result from no obvious pathological condition 
that requires medical intervention.
APD can be thought of as a hearing disorder that occurs as a result 
of dysfunction of the central auditory nervous system. Although 
some children may be genetically predisposed to APD, it is more 
likely to be a developmental delay or disorder, resulting from in-
consistent or degraded auditory input during the critical period for 
auditory perceptual development. APD is symptomatic in nature 
and is often confused with an impairment of hearing sensitivity. It 
can be an isolated disorder, or it can co-exist with attention  deﬁ cit 
disorders, learning disabilities, and language disorders. Func-
tionally, children with APD act as if they have hearing-sensitivity 
defi cits, although they are usually capable of hearing faint sounds. 
In particular, they exhibit diffi culty in  perceiving spoken language 
or other sounds in hostile acoustic environments. Thus, APD is 
commonly identifi ed early in children’s academic lives, when they 
enter a conventional classroom situation and are unable to under-
stand instructions from the teacher.
As our understanding of APD has progressed, we have begun to 
better define its true nature and to agree on clinical, operational 
defi nitions of the disorder. Consensus is beginning to emerge on a 
definition of APD that distinguishes it from language processing 
Neuropathologic 
conditions are those that 
involve the peripheral or 
central nervous systems.
When a hearing loss is 
idiopathic, it is of an 
unknown cause.
When a person is 
genetically predisposed, 
he or she is susceptible to a 
heredity condition.
When a person is 
symptomatic, he or she is 
exhibiting a condition that 
indicates the existence of a 
particular disease.
An attention deﬁ cit 
disorder results in reduced 
ability to focus on an activity, 
task, or sensory stimulus.
A learning disability is 
the lack of skill in one or 
more areas of learning that 
is inconsistent with the 
person’s intellectual capacity.
A hostile acoustic 
environment is a difﬁ cult 
listening environment, such 
as a room with a signiﬁ cant 
amount of background noise.

114  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
disorders and other neuropsychological disorders. One useful 
classifi cation scheme for categorizing disorder types is shown in 
Table 3-1. Under this scheme,
APD
• 
 is defi ned as an auditory disorder that results from 
 defi cits in central auditory nervous system function.
Receptive language processing disorders
• 
 are defi ned as defi cits 
in linguistic-processing skills and may affect language com-
prehension and vocabulary development.
Supramodal disorders
• 
, such as auditory attention and audi-
tory memory, are defi ned as defi cits in cognitive ability that 
cross modalities.
Clearly, overlap exists among these disorders, they may co-exist, 
and they are often diffi cult to separate. For example, the change 
from perception to comprehension must occur on a continuum, 
and deciding where one ends and the other begins can only be de-
fi ned operationally. Similarly, the relation of memory and atten-
tion to either perception or comprehension is diffi cult to separate. 
Nevertheless, distinguishing among these classes of disorders is 
important clinically because they tend to have different sequelae 
and to be treated differently.
APD, then, can be thought of  as an auditory disorder that oc-
curs as a result of dysfunction in the manipulation and utiliza-
tion of acoustic signals by the central auditory nervous system. 
Sequelae are conditions 
following or occurring as 
a consequence of another 
condition.

It is broadly defined as an impaired ability to process acoustic 
 information that cannot be attributed to impaired hearing sensi-
tivity,  impaired language, or impaired intellectual function.
Auditory processing disorders have been characterized based on 
models of defi cits in children and adults with acquired lesions of 
the central auditory nervous system. Such defi cits include reduced 
ability to understand in background noise, to understand speech 
of reduced redundancy, to localize and lateralize sound, to sepa-
rate dichotic stimuli, and to process normal or altered temporal 
cues. Children with APD exhibit defi cits similar to those with ac-
quired lesions, although they may be less pronounced in severity 
and are more likely to be generalized than ear-specifi c.
APD in the Elderly. Changes in structure and function occur 
throughout the peripheral and central auditory nervous systems 
as a result of the aging process. Evidence of neural degeneration 
has been found in the auditory nerve, brainstem, and cortex.
Whereas the effect of structural change in the auditory periphery is 
to attenuate and distort incoming sounds, the major effect of struc-
tural change in the central auditory nervous system is the degrada-
tion of auditory processing. Hearing impairment in the elderly, then, 
can be quite complex, consisting of attenuation of acoustic informa-
tion, distortion of that information, and/or disordered processing of 
neural information. In its simplest form, this complex disorder can 
be thought of as a combination of peripheral cochlear effects (atten-
uation and distortion) and central nervous system effects (auditory 
processing disorder). The consequences of peripheral sensitivity loss 
in the elderly are similar to those of younger hearing-impaired in-
dividuals. The functional consequence of structural changes in the 
central auditory nervous system is auditory processing disorder.
Auditory processing ability is usually defi ned operationally on the 
basis of behavioral measures of speech recognition. Degradation 
in auditory processing has been demonstrated most convincingly 
by the use of sensitized speech audiometric measures. Age-related 
changes have been found on degraded speech tests that use both 
frequency and temporal alteration. Tests of dichotic performance 
have also been found to be adversely affected by aging. In addition, 
aging listeners do not perform as well as younger listeners on tasks 
Reduced redundancy 
means less information is 
available.
To lateralize sound means 
to determine its perceived 
location in the head or ears.
Dichotic stimuli are 
different signals presented 
simultaneously to each ear.
Temporal cues are timing 
cues.
Neural degeneration 
occurs when the anatomic 
structure degrades.
Sensitized speech 
audiometric measures are 
measures in which speech 
targets are altered in 
various ways to reduce their 
informational content in an 
effort to more effectively 
challenge the auditory system.
Temporal alteration 
refers to changing the speed 
or timing of speech signals.

that involve the understanding of speech in the presence of back-
ground noise.
Functional Hearing Loss
Functional hearing loss is the exaggeration or feigning of hear-
ing impairment. Many terms have been used to describe this type 
of  hearing “impairment,” including nonorganic hearing loss, 
pseudohypacusis, malingering, factitious hearing loss, and so on. 
Since there may be some organicity to the hearing loss, it is proba-
bly best considered as an exaggerated hearing loss or a functional 
overlay to an organic loss. The term functional hearing loss is the 
general term most commonly used to describe such outcomes.
A better way to understand functional hearing loss is to defi ne it 
by a patient’s motivation (Austen & Lynch, 2004). This is depicted 
in Figure 3-7. Here motivation is defi ned by two factors: the intent

of the person in creating the symptoms and the nature of the gain 
that results. Thinking of functional hearing loss in this way results 
in a continuum that can be divided into at least three categories: 
malingering, factitious disorder, and conversion disorder.
Malingering occurs when someone is feigning a hearing loss, typi-
cally for fi nancial gain. In many cases of malingering, particularly 
in adults, an organic hearing sensitivity loss exists but is willfully ex-
aggerated for compensatory purposes. In other cases, often second-
ary to trauma of some kind, the entire hearing loss will be willfully 
feigned. Malingering occurs mostly in adults. For example, an em-
ployee may be applying for worker’s compensation for hearing loss 
secondary to exposure to excessive sound in the workplace. Or some-
one discharged from the military may be seeking compensation for 
hearing loss from excessive noise exposure. Although most patients 
have legitimate concerns and provide honest results, a small per-
centage tries to exaggerate hearing loss in the mistaken notion that 
they will receive greater compensation. There are also those who 
have an accident or altercation and are involved in a lawsuit against 
an insurance company or someone else. Some may think that feign-
ing a hearing loss will lead to greater monetary award.
A factitious disorder is one in which the feigning of a hearing loss 
is done to assume a sick role, where the motivation is internal 
rather than external. Children with functional hearing loss are 
more likely to have factitious disorder, using hearing impairment 
as an explanation for poor performance in school or to gain at-
tention. The idea may have emerged from watching a classmate 
or sibling get special treatment for having a hearing impairment. 
It may also be secondary to a bout of otitis media and the conse-
quent parental attention paid to the episode.
A conversion disorder is a rare case in which the symptom of a hearing 
loss occurs unintentionally with little or no organic basis. A conver-
sion disorder results following psychological distress of some nature.
IMPACT OF HEARING DISORDER
Defi ning the impact of a hearing disorder is complicated by the many 
factors involved in the hearing loss itself and in the patient who has the 
hearing loss. Hearing sensitivity loss varies in degree from minimal to 

118  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
profound. Similarly, speech perception defi cits vary from mild to severe. 
The extent to which these problems cause a communication disorder 
depends on a number of factors, including:
degree of sensitivity loss,
• 
audiometric confi guration,
• 
type of hearing loss, and
• 
degree and nature of a speech perception defi cit.
• 
Confounding this issue further are individual patient factors that 
are interrelated to these auditory factors, including:
age of onset of loss,
• 
whether the loss was sudden or gradual, and
• 
communication demands on the patient.
• 
Patient Factors
One of  the most important factors determining the impact of 
hearing loss in children is the age of onset. When a hearing loss is 
congenital, it occurs before linguistic development or prelinguis-
tically. If the degree of loss is severe enough, and intervention is 
not implemented early enough, the prognosis for developing ade-
quate spoken language is diminished. Conversely, when a hearing 
loss is acquired after spoken language development, or postlin-
guistically, the prognosis for continued speech and language de-
velopment is signifi cantly better.
An important factor in the impact of  hearing loss on adults is 
the speed with which a hearing loss occurs. Sudden hearing 
loss has a significantly greater impact on communication than 
a gradual hearing loss. Those who develop hearing loss slowly 
over many years tend to develop compensatory strategies, such 
as speechreading, and implement environmental alteration. 
This concept seems to hold even for mild hearing loss. The grad-
ual development of a mild hearing loss has little impact on most 
patients, and many will not seek treatment for a mild disorder. 
However, the same mild hearing loss of sudden onset can cause 
signifi cant communication disorder for that patient.
Another patient factor that infl uences the impact of hearing loss is 
the communication demands a patient faces in everyday life. Two pa-
Congenital means present 
at birth.
Prelinguistic means 
occurring before the 
time of spoken language 
development.
Prognosis is a prediction of 
the course or outcome of a 
disease or treatment. 
Postlinguistic means 
occurring after the time 
of spoken language 
development.
Compensatory strategies 
are skills that a person learns 
in order to compensate for 
the loss or reduction of an 
ability.
Speechreading is the 
ability to understand speech 
by watching the movements 
of the lips and face; also 
known as lipreading.
Environmental 
alteration refers to the 
manipulation of physical 
characteristics of a room or a 
person’s location within that 
room to provide an easier 
listening situation.

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  119
tients with the same type, degree, and confi guration of hearing loss 
will have signifi cantly different perceptions of the impact of the hear-
ing loss if their communication demands are substantially different. 
The active businesswoman who spends most of her days in meetings 
and on the telephone will fi nd the impact of a moderate hearing loss 
to be much greater than the retired person who lives alone.
Although these patient factors will influence the extent of im-
pairment, there are, nevertheless, some general rules about the 
impact of degree, confi guration, and type of hearing loss on com-
munication ability.
Degree and Configuration of Hearing 
Sensitivity Loss
Degree of hearing sensitivity loss is commonly defi ned on the basis 
of the audiogram. Table 3-2 provides a general guideline for de-
scribing degree of hearing loss. Normal hearing is defi ned as audi-
ometric zero, plus or minus two standard deviations of the mean. 
Thus, normal sensitivity ranges from −10 to +10 dB HL. All other 
classifi cations are based on generally accepted terminology.
These terms might be used to describe the pure-tone thresholds 
at specifi c frequencies, or they might be used to describe the pure-
tone average or threshold for speech recognition. In this way, the 
audiogram in Figure 3-8 might be described as a mild hearing loss 
through 1000 Hz and a moderate hearing loss above 1000 Hz, 
or, based on the pure-tone average, a moderate hearing loss for 
the speech frequencies. It is important to remember that these 
Pure-tone average is the 
mean of thresholds at 500, 
1000, and 2000 Hz.
The term speech 
frequencies generally refers 
to 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz.

descriptions are just words and that “mild is in the ear of the lis-
tener.” What might truly be a mild problem to one individual with 
a mild loss can be a severe communication problem for another 
patient with the same mild degree of sensitivity loss. Nevertheless, 
these terms serve as a means for consistently describing the de-
gree of sensitivity loss across patients.
In terms of communication, the degree of hearing loss might be 
considered as follows:
Minimal 
diffi culty hearing faint speech in noise
Mild 
 diffi culty hearing faint or distant speech, even 
in quiet

Another important aspect of the audiogram is the shape of the 
audiometric configuration. In general, shape of the audiogram 
can be defi ned in the following terms:
Flat 
 thresholds are within 20 dB of each 
other across the frequency range
Rising 
 thresholds for low frequencies are 
at least 20 dB poorer than for high 
frequencies
Sloping 
 thresholds for high frequencies are 
at least 20 dB poorer than for low 
frequencies
Low-frequency 
 hearing loss is restricted to the low-
frequency region of the audiogram
High-frequency 
 hearing loss is restricted to the high-
frequency region of the audiogram
Precipitous 
 steeply sloping high-frequency hear-
ing loss of at least 20 dB per octave
Examples of these various confi gurations are shown in Figure 3-9.
The shape of the audiogram combined with the degree of the loss 
provides a useful description of hearing sensitivity. How a par-
ticular hearing loss might affect communication can begin to be 
understood by assessing the relationship of the pure-tone audio-
gram to the intensity and frequency areas of speech sounds dur-
ing normal conversations. Figure 3-10 shows an example. Here,

conversational levels are plotted as a function of frequency and 
 intensity on an audiogram. Next, three examples of audiograms 
are superimposed on these symbols.
Figure 3-11 shows a mild, low-frequency hearing loss. In this 
case, nearly all the speech sounds would be audible to the lis-
tener. Some of the lower frequency sounds, such as the vowels, 
may be less  audible, but because they do not carry nearly as much 
meaning as consonant sounds, suprathreshold speech perception 
should not be affected.
Figure 3-12 shows a moderately severe, fl at hearing loss. In this ex-
ample, none of the speech signals of normal conversational speech 
Audible is “hearable.”

would be perceived. In order for perception of speech sounds to oc-
cur, the intensity of the speech sounds would have to be increased 
by moving closer to the sound source or by amplifying the sound.
Figure 3-13 shows a moderate high-frequency hearing loss. In 
this case, low-frequency sounds are perceived adequately, but 
high-frequency sounds are imperceptible. Again, because the 
high-frequency sounds are consonant sounds, and because con-
sonant sounds carry much of  the meaning in the English lan-
guage, this patient would be at a disadvantage for perceiving 
speech adequately.
It is not quite this simple, of course. Perception of speech in the 
real world is made easier by built-in redundancy of information.

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  125
For example, co-articulation from one sound to the other can 
provide enough information about the next sound that the lis-
tener does not even need to hear it to accurately perceive what 
is being said. As another example, many consonant sounds are 
visible on the speaker’s lips, so that the combination of hearing 
some  frequencies of speech and seeing others can provide enough 
 information for adequate understanding.
Although redundancy in the communication process makes per-
ception easier, noise and reverberation make it more difficult. 
Those important high-frequency consonant sounds have the least 
acoustic energy of any speech sounds. As a consequence, noise 
of any kind is likely to cover up or mask those signals fi rst. Add a 
high-frequency sensitivity loss to the mix, and the most important 
speech sounds are the least likely to be perceived.
Co-articulation refers to 
the inﬂ uence of one speech 
sound on the next.
Reverberation is the 
prolongation of a sound by 
multiple reﬂ ections, more 
commonly termed an echo.

126  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
Type of Hearing Loss
The type of hearing loss is also a factor in the impact that a hear-
ing loss has on communication ability. For example, the simple 
attenuation created by a conductive hearing loss has less of an 
impact than the more complex impairment that can result from a 
retrocochlear disorder.
Conductive Hearing Loss
The effects of conductive hearing loss are probably the easiest to 
understand. The confi guration of a conductive hearing loss is gen-
erally either fl at or low-frequency in nature. In addition, conductive 
hearing loss has a maximum limit of approximately 60 dB HL. This 
represents the loss due to both the lack of impedance-matching 
function of the middle ear and additional mass and stiffness compo-
nents related to the nature of the disorder.

FIGURE 3-13 The selective audibility of speech sounds in the 
 presence of a moderate, high-frequency audiometric 
conﬁ guration.

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  127
As a general rule, a conductive hearing loss simply reduces the vol-
ume of the incoming signal. Although too much attenuation makes 
the hearing of speech diffi cult, it can be fairly easily overcome by 
increasing the intensity level of the speech. At suprathreshold level, 
the ear with a conductive hearing loss acts quite normally. As long 
as sound can be made suffi ciently loud, hearing will be normal.
Most conductive hearing loss results from auditory disorders that 
can be treated medically. As a result, conductive loss is seldom of a 
longstanding duration. Thus, its impact on communication is usu-
ally transient. Under some circumstances, however, conductive 
hearing loss can have a more long-term effect. Occasionally, a pa-
tient will have chronic middle-ear disorder that has gone untreated. 
In some cases, this will lead to permanent conductive hearing loss 
that can only be treated with hearing aid amplifi cation.
But there is also a more insidious effect of conductive hearing loss. 
Some children have chronic middle-ear disorder that results in fl uc-
tuating conductive hearing loss throughout much of their early 
lives. Evidence suggests that some children who experience this 
type of inconsistent auditory input during their formative years will 
not develop appropriate auditory and listening skills. Such children 
may be at risk for later learning and achievement problems.
Sensorineural Hearing Loss
As you learned earlier, a sensorineural hearing loss has at least 
three fundamentally important effects on hearing: a reduction in 
the cochlear sensitivity, a reduction in frequency resolution, and 
a reduction in the dynamic range of the hearing mechanism. In 
many ways, the reduction in hearing sensitivity can be thought 
of as having the same effects as a conductive hearing loss in terms 
of reducing the audibility of speech. That is, a conductive hear-
ing loss and a sensorineural hearing loss of the same degree and 
configuration will have the same effect on audibility of speech 
sounds. The difference between the two types of hearing loss oc-
curs at suprathreshold levels.
One of the consequences of sensorineural hearing loss is recruit-
ment, or abnormal loudness growth. Recall from Figure 3-4 that 
loudness grows more rapidly than normal at intensity levels just 
In this context, transient 
means short-lived or not 
long term.
When something is more 
dangerous than seems 
evident, it is insidious.

128  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
above threshold in an ear with sensorineural hearing loss. This re-
cruitment results in a reduced dynamic range from the threshold 
level to the discomfort level.
Reduction in frequency resolution and in dynamic range affect 
the perception of speech. In most sensorineural hearing loss, this 
effect on speech understanding is predictable from the audiogram 
and is poorer than would be expected from a conductive hearing 
loss of similar magnitude. At the extreme end of the audiogram 
the reduction in frequency resolution and dynamic range can se-
verely limit the usefulness of residual hearing.
Retrocochlear Hearing Loss
In general, hearing loss from retrocochlear disorder is distin-
guishable from cochlear or conductive hearing loss by the extent 
to which it can adversely affect speech perception. Conductive 
loss impacts speech perception only by attenuating it. Cochlear 
hearing loss adds distortion, but it is reasonably minimal and 
predictable. Retrocochlear disorder can cause severe distortion 
of  incoming speech signals in a manner that limits the useful-
ness of hearing.
In addition to speech-recognition defi cits, other suprathreshold 
abnormalities can occur. Loudness growth can be abnormal in 
patients with retrocochlear disorder. Instead of the abnormally 
rapid growth of loudness characteristic of cochlear hearing loss, 
retrocochlear disorder can show no recruitment or decruitment, 
an abnormally slow growth in loudness with increasing intensity. 
Another abnormality that can occur as a result of retrocochlear 
disorder is abnormal auditory adaptation. The normal auditory sys-
tem tends to adapt to ongoing sound, especially at near-threshold 
levels, so that, as adaptation occurs, an audible signal becomes in-
audible. At higher intensity levels, ongoing sound remains  audible 
without adaptation. However, in an ear with retrocochlear disor-
der, the audibility may diminish rapidly due to excessive auditory 
adaptation, even at higher intensity levels.
The impact of retrocochlear disorder often depends on the level in 
the auditory nervous system at which the disorder is occurring. A 
disorder of the VIIIth nerve may have a signifi cant impact on the 
audiogram and on speech perception. A disorder of the brainstem

to the remaining hearing 
ability in a person with a 
hearing loss.

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  129
may spare the audiogram and negatively infl uence only hearing 
of speech in noisy or other complex listening environments.
Auditory Processing Disorder
Consequences of APD can range from mild diffi culty understand-
ing a teacher in a noisy classroom to substantial difficulty un-
derstanding speech in everyday listening situations at home and 
school. One of the most important defi cits in children with APD is 
diffi culty understanding in background noise. In an acoustic en-
vironment that would be adequate for other children, a child with 
APD may have substantial diffi culty understanding what is being 
said. Thus, parents will often complain that the child cannot un-
derstand them when the television is on, while riding in the car, or 
when the parents are speaking from another room. The teacher 
will complain of the child’s inability to follow directions, distract-
ibility, and general unruliness. In effect, the complaints will be 
similar to those expressed by parents or teachers of children with 
impairments of hearing sensitivity. In a quiet environment, with 
one-on-one instruction, a child with APD may thrive in a manner 
consistent with his or her academic potential. In a more adverse 
acoustic environment, a child with APD will struggle.
In general, children with APD will act as if they have a hearing 
sensitivity loss, even though most will have normal audiograms. 
They will ask for repetition, fail to follow instructions, and so on, 
particularly in the presence of background noise or other factors 
that reduce the redundancy of the acoustic signal. To the extent 
that such difficulties result in frustration, secondary problems 
may develop related to their behavior and motivation in the class-
room. Some children with APD will have concomitant speech and 
language defi cits, learning disabilities, and attention defi cit disor-
ders. Thus, APD may be accompanied by distractibility, attention 
problems, memory defi cits, language comprehension defi cits, re-
stricted vocabulary, and reading and spelling problems.
In general, elderly patients with APD will experience substantially 
greater diffi culty hearing than would be expected from their de-
gree and confi guration of hearing loss. This diffi culty will be ex-
acerbated in the presence of background noise or competition. As 
a result, disorders in auditory processing may adversely impact 
benefi t from conventional hearing aid use.

130  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
Summary
Hearing disorders are of two major types: hearing sensitivity 
• 
loss and suprathreshold hearing disorders.
The major cause of  hearing disorder is a loss of  hearing 
• 
 sensitivity. A loss of hearing sensitivity means that the ear is 
not as sensitive as normal in detecting sound. Hearing sen-
sitivity losses are of  three types: conductive, sensorineural, 
and mixed.
A conductive hearing loss is caused by an abnormal reduc-
• 
tion or attenuation of  sound as it travels from the outer ear 
to the cochlea. A sensorineural hearing loss is caused by a 
failure in the cochlear transduction of sound from mechani-
cal energy in the middle ear to neural impulses in the VIIIth 
nerve. A mixed hearing loss results when sound being de-
livered to an impaired cochlea is attenuated by a disordered 
outer or middle ear.
Auditory nervous system disorders are of two types, depending 
• 
on the nature of the underlying disorder: retrocochlear disor-
ders and auditory processing disorders.
Retrocochlear disorders result from structural lesions of the 
• 
nervous system, such as a tumor or other space-occupying le-
sions or damage due to trauma or stroke.
Auditory processing disorders result from “functional le-
• 
sions” of the nervous system, such as developmental disorder 
or delay or diffuse changes such as those related to the aging 
process.
Functional hearing loss is the exaggeration or feigning of hear-
• 
ing impairment. In many cases of functional hearing loss, par-
ticularly in adults, an organic hearing sensitivity loss exists but 
is willfully exaggerated.
The impact of  hearing disorder on communication depends 
• 
on factors such as age of  onset of  loss, whether the loss was 
sudden or gradual, and communication demands on the 
patient.
The impact of  hearing disorder on communication also de-
• 
pends on hearing-loss factors, including degree of sensitivity 
loss, audiometric confi guration, type of hearing loss, and de-
gree and nature of speech perception defi cits.

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  131
Short Answer Questions
 1. Type of hearing loss is related to 
 of disorder 
within the auditory system. Degree of hearing loss is related 
to the 
 that the disorder is impacting normal 
function.
 2. The two major types of hearing loss include hearing 
 loss and 
 hearing disorders.
 3. The time of 
 refers to when a hearing loss 
fi rst occurs. A 
 hearing loss refers to one that 
is  present at birth, while 
 and 
 
 hearing losses are obtained after birth.
 4. When describing the ear specifi city of a hearing loss, a 
 hearing loss, pertaining to one ear only, has 
 impact on communication that a 
 
hearing loss, in which both ears are involved.
 5. A 
 hearing loss is a reduction of hear-
ing sensitivity due to disorder of outer or middle ear. 
The functional  problem of this type of hearing loss is 
an 
of sound energy as it travels from outer 
ear to cochlea. It is demonstrated by the presence of an 
-
 gap.
 6. The 
, or shape, of a hearing loss varies depend-
ing on attenuating characteristics of physical obstruction. 
Disorders adding mass to the system affect 
frequencies. Disorders affecting stiffness affect 
 
frequencies.
 7. A 
 hearing loss results from an inner-ear 
 disorder. The confi guration of the hearing loss depends on 
the  location along the 
 
 of hair 
cell loss or other damage. 
 8. The outcomes of sensorineural hearing loss can include 
reduction in 
 of cochlear receptor cells, reduc-
tion in 
-resolving capability of the cochlea, and 
reduction in the 
 
 of the hearing 
mechanism.
 9. A 
 hearing loss has both 
 and 
 components, whose etiologies may or not be 
the same.

132  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
 10. A 
 hearing disorder may be either a 
 hearing disorder, caused by an active, 
measurable disease process, or an 
 
 
disorder, caused by developmental disorder or delay.
 11. Characteristics of auditory processing disorders in 
 children often include: a reduced ability to understand in 
 noise; reduced ability to understand speech 
of reduced 
; reduced ability to 
 
and 
 the source of sound; reduced ability to 
separate 
 stimuli (different signals presented 
simultaneously to each ear); and reduced ability to process 
normal or altered
 (timing) cues.
 12. A 
 hearing loss is an exaggeration of fabrication 
of a hearing loss. It often co-occurs with an 
 
hearing loss of some degree.
 13. The time of 
 of a hearing loss has important 
implications for the impact of the disorder on function-
ing. Hearing loss can be described relative to the timing of 
language development. A 
 hearing loss occurs 
prior to the onset of spoken language development, while a 
 hearing loss occurs following the majority of 
language acquisition.
 14. With a gradual onset of hearing loss, 
  strategies 
are often developed, which allow the individual to cope with 
their reduction in ability. Strategies such as 
, 
where the individual with hearing loss relies on visual cues 
from the face and lips, and 
 alterations, where 
the individual manipulates characteristics of the auditory 
environment or location to facilitate easier listening, are 
 examples of compensation.
 15. The 
 of hearing sensitivity loss has implica-
tions for communication ability, with greater amounts of 
loss generally resulting in greater communication diffi culty. 
 16. The 
 of hearing loss describes its shape. 
A 
 confi guration occurs when all thresholds 
are within 20 dB of each other. In a 
 confi gura-
tion, the lower frequency thresholds are at least 20 dB poorer 
than the higher frequencies. Conversely, for a 
 

CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER  133
confi guration, the higher frequency thresholds are at least 
20 dB poorer than the lower frequencies. A 
 
hearing loss has a steeply sloping shape with high-frequency 
thresholds much poorer than low frequency.
 17. The prolongation of sound due to refl ections of sound from 
surfaces in a room, known as 
, contributes to 
decreased ability to perceive speech by adding 
 
to the acoustic signal.
 18. A 
 hearing loss, which changes over time, com-
monly occurs with conductive hearing losses, and causes 
 auditory input during speech and language 
learning.
 19. A 
 hearing loss has numerous consequences 
for hearing including: reduction in cochlear sensitivity; 
reduction in 
 resolution; and reduction in the 
 range of the hearing mechanism.
 20. Consequences of a 
 hearing loss can include 
severe distortion of incoming auditory signals, 
 
(an abnormally slow growth of loudness with increasing 
intensity), and abnormally excessive auditory 
 
(diminished audibility).
Discussion Questions
 1. How might the transient nature of conductive losses have 
implications for the development of auditory and listening 
skills? How might hearing loss and patient factors contrib-
ute to poorer outcomes in these areas?
 2. How might the consequences of auditory processing dis-
orders in children make it initially diffi cult for parents and 
teachers to distinguish it from other disorders such as 
 attentional disorders, language impairment, and learning 
disabilities?
 3. The primary function of a hearing aid is to make sound 
louder, to make the auditory signal audible for a person 
with a hearing impairment. How might the consequences 
of a sensorineural hearing loss impact on the outcomes of 
hearing aid use?

134  CHAPTER 3  THE NATURE OF HEARING DISORDER
 4. Discuss the roles of gain and intent in defi ning the motiva-
tion for a functional hearing loss.
 5. How might a mild hearing loss result in signifi cant func-
tional impact for an individual?

136  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
THERE are a number of causes of hearing disorder, some affect-
ing the growing embryo, some the newborn and young child, oth-
ers adults and the elderly. Some of the causes affect the outer- or 
middle-ear conductive mechanisms. Others affect only the sensory 
system of the cochlea or the auditory nervous system. Still others 
can affect the entire auditory mechanism. This section provides a 
brief overview of the various pathologies that can cause auditory 
disorder.
AUDITORY PATHOLOGY
There are several major categories of  pathology or noxious 
 infl uences that can adversely affect the auditory system, includ-
ing developmental defects, infections, toxins, noise exposure and 
trauma, vascular disorders, neural disorders, immune-system 
disorders, bone disorders, aging, and tumors and other neoplastic 
growths.
Potential developmental defects are numerous, and many of them 
are inherited. Hereditary disorders, both dominant and  recessive, 
are a signifi cant cause of sensorineural hearing loss. Some inher-
ited disorders result in congenital hearing loss; others result in 
progressive hearing loss later in life. Other developmental defects 
result from certain maternal prenatal infections such as maternal 
rubella, or from maternal ingestion of teratogenic drugs, such as 
thalidomide or accutane. A number of other outer-, middle-, and 
Toxins are poisonous 
substances.
Vascular disorders are 
disorders of blood vessels.
Neoplastic pertains to a 
mass of newly formed tissue 
or tumor.
If only one gene of a pair is 
needed to carry a genetic 
characteristic or mutation, 
the gene is dominant.
If both genes of a pair are 
needed to carry a genetic 
characteristic or mutation, 
the gene is recessive.
Maternal prenatal 
infections are infections 
such as rubella that a 
pregnant mother contracts 
that can cause abnormalities 
in her unborn fetus.
Teratogenic drugs are 
drugs that if ingested by the 
mother during pregnancy 
can cause abnormal 
embryologic development.
Describe the different categories of pathol-
• 
ogy or inﬂ uences that can adversely affect 
the auditory system.
Identify and describe the various outer-, 
• 
middle-, and inner-ear anomalies that 
 contribute to hearing loss.
Identify the various infections, both mater-
• 
nal and acquired, that cause hearing loss.
Explain the mechanism causing otitis media 
• 
and describe its effect on hearing.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Explain how hereditary factors are related 
• 
to hearing loss, including syndromic and 
nonsyndromic disorders.
Describe the effects of ototoxic drugs on 
• 
acquired and congenital hearing loss.

• 
contribute to the occurrence of hearing 
loss.
Identify and describe common vestibular 
• 
disorders.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  137
inner-ear anomalies can occur in isolation during embryologic de-
velopment or as part of a genetic syndrome.
Infections are a common cause of outer- and middle-ear disor-
der and, in some cases, can result in sensorineural hearing loss. 
Bacterial infections of the external ear and tympanic membrane 
are not uncommon, though usually treatable and of little con-
sequence to hearing. Infections of the middle ear are quite com-
mon. Although treatable, chronic middle-ear infections can 
have a long-lasting impact on hearing ability. Bacterial infec-
tions of the brain lining, or meningitis, can affect the cochlear 
labyrinth, resulting in severe sensorineural hearing loss. Viral 
and other infections, resulting in measles, mumps, cytomegalo-
virus, and syphilis can all result in substantial and permanent 
sensorineural hearing loss.
Certain types of bone disorders can affect the auditory system. 
Otosclerosis is a common cause of middle-ear disorder and may 
also cause sensorineural hearing loss. Other bone defects, both 
developmental and progressive, can impact on auditory function.
Certain drugs and environmental toxins can cause temporary 
or permanent sensorineural hearing loss. A group of  antibiot-
ics known as aminoglycosides are ototoxic, or toxic to the ear. 
Other drugs including aspirin, quinine, and lasix are associated 
with ototoxicity. Certain solvents used for industrial purposes 
and additives used in commercial products can be toxic to the 
ear of a person exposed to high levels. In addition, certain com-
ponents of the drugs used in chemotherapy treatment of cancer 
are ototoxic.
Exposure to excessive levels of sound and other trauma to the au-
ditory system, both physical and acoustic, can cause temporary 
or permanent damage to hearing. Excessive noise exposure is a 
common cause of permanent sensorineural hearing loss. Physical 
trauma can cause tympanic membrane perforation, ossicular dis-
ruption, and fracture of the temporal bone. Trauma to the hear-
ing mechanism can also occur because of changes in air pressure 
that occur when rapidly ascending or descending during diving or 
fl ying. Hearing can also be affected by radiation trauma used in 
the treatment of cancer.
Meningitis is a bacterial 
or viral inﬂ ammation of the 
membranes covering the 
brain and spinal cord that can 
cause signiﬁ cant hearing loss.
Cochlear labyrinth is 
another term for inner ear.
Otosclerosis is a disorder 
characterized by new bone 
formation around the stapes 
and oval window, resulting 
in stapes ﬁ xation and related 
conductive hearing loss.

138  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
Hearing loss can occur from vascular disorders. Interruption or 
diminution of blood supply to the cochlea can cause a loss of hair 
cell function, resulting in permanent sensorineural hearing loss. 
Causes of blood supply disruption include stroke, embolism, other 
occlusion, or diabetes mellitus.
Immune system disorders have been associated with hearing loss. 
Hearing disorder due specifi cally to autoimmune disease has been 
described. Other hearing disorders that occur secondarily to sys-
temic autoimmunity, such as AIDS, have also been described.
Neural disorders can affect the auditory system. Auditory neu-
ropathy is a hearing disorder that interferes with the synchronous 
transmission of signals from cochlear hair cells to the VIIIth cra-
nial nerve. Neoplasms, or tumors, can also affect the auditory sys-
tem. One of the more common neoplasms, the cochleovestibular 
schwannoma or acoustic tumor, is an important cause of retro-
cochlear hearing disorder. Neuritis, or infl ammation of the audi-
tory nerve can cause a temporary or permanent hearing disorder. 
Other disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or brainstem gliomas, 
can also affect hearing function. 
Other hearing disorders are of unknown origin. Idiopathic endo-
lymphatic hydrops is an excessive collection of endolymph in the 
cochlea of unknown origin. It is the underlying cause of  Ménière’s 
disease and can result in permanent sensorineural hearing loss. 
Other idiopathic disorder, particularly sudden hearing loss, is not 
an uncommon fi nding clinically.
CONDUCTIVE HEARING DISORDERS
Disorders of the outer and middle ear are commonly of two types, 
either structural defects due to embryologic malformations or 
structural changes secondary to infection or trauma. Another 
common abnormality, otosclerosis, is a bone disorder.
Congenital Outer- and Middle-Ear Anomalies
Microtia and atresia are congenital malformations of the auricle 
and external auditory canal. Microtia is an abnormal smallness 
of the auricle. It is one of a variety of auricular malformations. 
An embolism is an occlusion 
or obstruction of a blood 
vessel by a transported clot 
or other mass.
Neuritis is inﬂ ammation of 
a nerve with corresponding 
sensory or motor 
dysfunction.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) 
is a demyelinating disease 
in which plaques form 
throughout the white matter 
of the brain, resulting in 
diffuse neurologic symptoms, 
including hearing loss and 
speech recognition deﬁ cits.
A brainstem glioma is 
any neoplasm derived from 
neuroglia (non-neuronal 
supporting tissues of the 
nervous system) located in 
the brainstem.
When a hearing loss is 
idiopathic, it is of an 
unknown cause.
Congenital is present at 
birth.
Auricular pertains to the 
outer ear or auricle.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  139
Others that fall into the general category of congenital auricular 
malformations include:
accessory auricle: 
 an additional auricle or additional 
 auricular tissue
anotia: 
congenital absence of an auricle
auricular aplasia: 
anotia
cleft pinna: 
congenital ﬁ ssure of the auricle
coloboma lobuli: 
congenital fi ssure of the earlobe
macrotia: 
 congenital excessive enlargement of 
the auricle
melotia: 
congenital displacement of the auricle
low-set ears: 
congenitally displaced auricles
polyotia: 
 presence of an additional auricle on 
one or both sides
preauricular pits: 
 small hole of variable depth lying 
 anterior to the auricle
preauricular tags: 
 small appendage lying anterior to the 
auricle
scroll ear: 
 auricular deformity in which the rim 
is rolled forward and inward
Microtia in isolation may not affect hearing in any substantial 
way. The auricle serves an important purpose in horizontal sound 
localization and in providing certain resonance to incoming sig-
nals. But the absence of auricles, or the presence of auricles that 
are deformed, does not in itself create a signifi cant communica-
tion disorder for patients. Ears with microtia or other deformities 
will often be surgically corrected at an early age.
Atresia is the absence of an opening of the external auditory me-
atus. An ear is said to be atretic if the ear canal is closed at any 
point. Atresia is a congenital disorder and may involve one or both 
ears. Bony atresia is the congenital absence of the ear canal due to 
a wall of bone separating the external auditory meatus from the 
middle ear. Membranous atresia is the condition in which a dense 
soft tissue plug is obstructing the ear canal.
A ﬁ ssure is a narrow slit or 
opening.
Atresia is the congenital 
absence or pathologic 
closure of a normal 
anatomical opening.

140  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
Although atresia can occur in isolation, the underlying embryo-
logic cause of  this malformation can also affect surrounding 
structures. So it is not unusual for atresia to be accompanied by 
microtia or other auricular deformity. Atresia can also occur with 
middle-ear malformations, depending on the cause.
Atresia causes a signifi cant conductive hearing loss, which can be 
as great as 60 dB. An example of an audiogram obtained from an 
atretic ear is shown in Figure 4-1. The additional bone or mem-
branous plug adds mass and stiffness to the outer ear system, re-
sulting in a relatively fl at conductive hearing loss.
Middle-ear anomalies include malformed ossicles (ossicular dys-
plasia), malformed openings into the cochlea (fenestral malforma-
tions), and congenital cholesteatoma. Ossicular dysplasia can result 
in fi xation of the bones, deformity of the bones, and disarticulation 
of the bones, especially the incus and stapes. In cases of congenital 
stapes fi xation, the stapes footplate is fi xed into the bony wall of the 
cochlea at the oval window. Lack of oval window development is an 
example of fenestral malformation. Congenital cholesteatoma is a 
cyst that is present in the middle-ear space at birth.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  141
There are a number of causes of microtia, atresia, and other mal-
formations of the outer and middle ears. They often occur as part of 
genetic syndromes, associations, or anomalies that are inherited. 
Impacted Cerumen
One common cause of transient hearing disorder is the accumula-
tion and impaction of cerumen in the external auditory canal. As 
you learned earlier, the ear canal naturally secretes cerumen as a 
mechanism for protecting the ear canal and tympanic membrane. 
Cerumen has a natural tendency to migrate out of the ear canal 
and, with proper aural hygiene, seldom interferes with hearing.
In some individuals, however, cerumen is secreted excessively, a 
condition known as ceruminosis. In these patients, routine ear 
canal cleaning may be required to forestall the effects of excessive 
cerumen accumulation.
Regardless of  whether a patient experiences ceruminosis, oc-
casionally excessive cerumen can accumulate in the ear canal 
and become impacted. The problem can occur gradually, and 
the impaction can become fairly signifi cant before a patient will 
seek treatment.
Figure 4-2 demonstrates the effect of a moderate level of impacted 
cerumen on hearing sensitivity. Not unlike atresia, the effect is one 
of both mass and stiffness, resulting in attenuation across the fre-
quency range, giving a fl at audiogram.
Although impacted cerumen often results in only a mild conduc-
tive hearing loss, the loss can have a signifi cant impact on chil-
dren in a classroom or on patients with preexisting hearing loss.
Sometimes cerumen is pushed down into the ear canal and onto 
the tympanic membrane without occluding the ear canal. This 
results in an increase in the mass of  the tympanic membrane, 
resulting in a high-frequency conductive hearing loss, as shown 
in Figure 4-3.
Impacted cerumen is often managed fi rst by a course of eardrops 
to soften the impaction, followed by irrigation of the ear canal to 
remove it.
Ceruminosis is the 
excessive accumulation 
of cerumen (wax) in the 
external auditory meatus 
(ear canal).
Attenuation means 
to reduce or decrease in 
magnitude.
When something is 
occluding, it is blocking or 
obstructing.

Other Outer-Ear Disorders
Other disorders of the outer ear are caused by infections, cancer, 
and other neoplastic growths. In general, outer-ear disorders do 
not impact hearing ability unless they result in ear canal stenosis 
or blockage.
Infections of the ear canal or auricle are referred to collectively as 
otitis externa, or infl ammation of the external ear. They are often 
caused by bacterium, virus, or fungus cultivated in the external 
ear canal. One common type is known as swimmer’s ear, or acute 
diffuse external otitis, and is characterized by diffuse reddened 
pustular lesions surrounding hair follicles in the ear canal due to 
a gram-negative bacterial infection during hot, humid weather 
and often initiated by swimming.
Carcinoma of the auricle is not uncommon. Basal-cell, epidermoid, 
and squamous-cell carcinoma can all occur around the auricle and 
external auditory meatus. In addition, tumors of various types can 
proliferate around the external auditory meatus and auricle.
Otitis Media with Effusion
The most common cause of transient conductive hearing loss in 
children is otitis media with effusion. Otitis media is inflamma-
tion of the middle ear. It is caused primarily by Eustachian tube 
dysfunction. When it is accompanied by middle-ear effusion, otitis 
media often causes conductive hearing loss.
Recall that the Eustachian tube is a normally closed passageway 
that permits pressure equalization between the middle ear and 
the atmosphere. Sometimes the Eustachian tube is restricted 
from opening by, for example, an upper respiratory infection that 
causes edema of the mucosa of the nasopharynx. When this oc-
curs, oxygen that is trapped in the middle-ear space begins to be 
absorbed by the mucosa of the middle-ear cavity. This creates a 
relative vacuum in the cavity and results in signifi cant negative 
pressure in the middle ear. The lining of the middle ear then be-
comes infl amed. If allowed to persist, the infl amed tissue begins 
the process of transudation of fl uid through the mucosal walls 
into the middle-ear cavity. Once this fl uid is suffi cient to impede 
Stenosis is a narrowing of 
the diameter of an opening 
or canal.
External otitis is an 
inﬂ ammation of the external 
auditory meatus, also called 
otitis externa.
Basal-cell carcinoma is a 
slow-growing malignant 
skin cancer that can occur 
on the auricle and external 
auditory meatus.
Epidermoid carcinoma 
is a cancerous tumor of the 
auricle, external auditory 
canal, middle ear, and/or 
mastoid.
Squamous-cell 
carcinoma is the most 
common malignant 
(cancerous) tumor of 
the auricle.
Effusion is the escape of 
ﬂ uid into tissue or a cavity.
Edema = swelling
Mucosa is any epithelial 
lining of an organ or 
structure, such as the 
tympanic cavity, that 
secretes mucus; also called 
the mucous membrane.
The passage of a body 
ﬂ uid through a membrane 
or tissue surface is called 
transudation.

144  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
normal movement of  the tympanic membrane and ossicles, a 
conductive hearing loss occurs.
Eustachian tube dysfunction is a common problem in young chil-
dren. The opening to the Eustachian tube is surrounded by the 
large adenoid tissue in the nasopharynx. An upper respiratory 
infection or infl ammation causes swelling of this tissue and can 
block Eustachian tube function. The infl ammation can also travel 
across the mucosal lining of the tube. Children seem to be par-
ticularly at risk because their Eustachian tubes are shorter, more 
horizontal, and more compliant.
There are a number of  ways to classify otitis media, including 
by type, effusion type, and duration. Various descriptions are 
provided in Table 4-1. Otitis media without effusion is just that, 
infl ammation that does not result in exudation of fl uid from the 
mucosa. Adhesive otitis media refers to infl ammation of the middle 
ear caused by prolonged Eustachian tube dysfunction, resulting 
in severe retraction of the tympanic membrane and obliteration 
of the middle-ear space. Otitis media with effusion has already been 
described, although there are a number of types of effusion.
Serous effusion is a common form of effusion and is characterized 
as thin, watery, sterile fl uid. Purulent effusion contains pus. Sup-
purative is a synonym of purulent. Nonsuppurative refers to serous 
fl uid or mucoid fl uid. Mucoid refers to fl uid that is thick, viscid, and 
mucuslike. Sanguineous fl uid contains blood.
Otitis media is also classifi ed by its duration. The following may be 
used as a general guideline. Acute otitis media is a single bout lasting 
fewer than 21 days. Chronic otitis media refers to that which persists 
beyond 8 weeks or results in permanent damage to the middle-ear 
mechanism. Subacute refers to an episode of otitis media that lasts 
from 22 days to 8 weeks. Otitis media is considered unresponsive if it 
fails to resolve after 48 hours of antibiotic therapy, and persistent if 
it fails to resolve after 6 weeks. Recurrent otitis media is often defi ned 
as three or more acute episodes within a 6-month period. Finally, 
someone is said to be otitis prone if otitis media occurs before the age 
of 1 year or if six bouts occur before the age of 6 years.
Otitis media is a common middle-ear disorder in children. Esti-
mates are that from 76 to 95% of all children have one episode 
76 to 95% of all children 
have one episode of otitis 
media by 6 years of age.

of  otitis media by 6 years of age. The prevalence of otitis media 
is highest during the fi rst 2 years and declines with age. Approxi-
mately 50% of those children who have otitis media before the age 
of 1 year will have 6 or more bouts within the ensuing 2 years. 
 Otitis media is more common in males, and its highest occurrence 
is during the winter and spring months. Certain groups appear to 
be more at risk for otitis media than others, including children with 
cleft palate or other craniofacial anomalies, children with Down 
syndrome, children with learning disabilities, Native populations, 
children who live in the inner city, those who attend day-care cen-
ters, and those who are passively exposed to cigarette smoking.
One of the consequences of otitis media with effusion is conductive 
hearing loss. An illustrative example of an audiogram is shown in 
Figure 4-4. The degree and confi guration of the loss depends on 
the amount and type of fl uid and its infl uence on functioning of 
the tympanic membrane and ossicles. This hearing loss is transient 
and resolves along with the otitis media. In cases of chronic otitis 
media, damage to the middle-ear structures can occur, resulting in 
more permanent conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss.
Recurrent or chronic otitis media can also have a far reaching 
impact on communication ability. For example, in studies of 
children with auditory processing disorders or children with 
learning disabilities, there is evidence of a higher prevalence of 
chronic otitis media. It appears likely that children who have 
aperiodic disruption in auditory input during the critical period

for auditory development may be at risk for developing auditory 
processing disorder or language and psychoeducational delays.
Otitis media is usually treated with antibiotic therapy If it is un-
responsive to such treatment, then surgical myringotomy and 
pressure-equalization tube placement is a likely course of action. 
In myringotomy, an incision is made in the tympanic membrane 
and the effusion is removed by suctioning. A tube is then placed 
through the opening to serve as a temporary replacement of the 
Eustachian tube in its role as middle-ear pressure equalizer.
Complications of OME
Tympanic-Membrane Perforation
Perforation of the tympanic membrane is a common complica-
tion of middle-ear infection. Sometimes, in the later stages of an 
acute attack of otitis media, the fl uid trapped in the middle-ear 
space is so excessive that the membrane ruptures to relieve the 
pressure. In other cases, chronic middle-ear infections erode 
portions of the tympanic membrane, weakening it to the point 
that a perforation forms.
Myringotomy involves an 
incision through the tympanic 
membrane to remove ﬂ uid 
from the middle ear.
PE tube, or pressure 
equalization tube, is a small 
tube inserted in the tympanic 
membrane following 
myringotomy to provide 
equalization of air pressure 
within the middle-ear space 
as a substitute for a non-
functional Eustachian tube.

The tympanic membrane can also be perforated by trauma. Trau-
matic perforation can occur when a foreign object is placed into the 
ear canal in an unwise effort to remove cerumen. It can also oc-
cur with a substantial blow to the side of the head.
Perforations of the tympanic membrane are of three types, defi ned 
by location. A central perforation is one of the pars tensa portion of 
the tympanic membrane, with a rim of the membrane remaining 
at all borders. An attic perforation is one of the pars ﬂ accida por-
tion. A marginal perforation is one located at the edge or the mar-
gin of the membrane.
A perforation in the tympanic membrane may or may not result 
in hearing loss, depending on its location and size. In general, if 
a perforation causes a hearing loss, it will be a mild, conductive 
hearing loss. An example of an audiogram from an ear with a per-
foration is shown in Figure 4-5.
Regardless of type, most perforations heal spontaneously. Those 
that do not are usually too large or are sustained by recurrent 
The pars tensa is the larger 
and stiffer portion of the 
tympanic membrane.
The pars ﬂ accida is 
the smaller and more 
compliant portion of the 
tympanic membrane, located 
superiorly.

infection. In such cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or 
replace the membrane.
Cholesteatoma
Following chronic otitis media, a common pathologic occurrence is 
the formation of a cholesteatoma. A cholesteatoma is an epithelial 
pocket that forms, usually in the epitympanum. Typically, a weak-
ened portion of the tympanic membrane becomes retracted into 
the middle-ear space. The outer layer of the membrane then sheds 
the cells naturally, and they become entrapped in the pocket formed 
by the retraction, resulting in growth of the cholesteatoma. As the 
cholesteatoma grows, it can begin to erode adjacent structures with 
which it has contact. The result can be substantial erosion of the 
ossicles and even invasion of the bony labyrinth.
Depending on the location of cholesteatoma growth, the magnitude 
of conductive hearing loss can vary from nonexistent to substan-
tial. Typically, the cholesteatoma will impede the ossicles, resulting 
in a signifi cant conductive hearing loss. An illustrative example of a 
hearing loss caused by cholesteatoma is shown in Figure 4-6.
Epithelial pertains to cell 
layer covering skin.
The attic of the middle-
ear cavity is called the 
epitympanum.

150  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
Cholesteatoma, once detected, is removed surgically, with or with-
out ossicular replacement, depending on the disease process.
Tympanosclerosis
Another consequence of chronic otitis media, is tympanosclerosis. 
Tympanosclerosis is the formation of whitish plaques on the tym-
panic membrane, with nodular deposits in the mucosal lining of 
the middle ear. These plaques can cause an increased stiffening 
of the tympanic membrane and ossicles and even fi xation of the 
 ossicular chain in rare cases. Conductive hearing loss can occur, 
depending on the severity and location of the deposits.
Otosclerosis
Otosclerosis is a disorder of bone growth that affects the stapes and 
the bony labyrinth of the cochlea. The disease process is character-
ized by resorption of bone and new spongy formation around the 
stapes and oval window. Gradually the stapes becomes fi xed within 
the oval window, resulting in conductive hearing loss.
Otosclerosis is a common cause of middle-ear disorder. A family 
history of the disease occurs in over half of the cases. Women are 
more likely to be diagnosed with otosclerosis than men, and its 
onset can be related to pregnancy.
Otosclerosis usually occurs bilaterally, although the time course 
of  its effect on hearing may differ between ears. The primary 
symptom of otosclerosis is hearing loss and the degree of loss ap-
pears to be directly related to the amount of fi xation.
An audiogram characteristic of otosclerosis is shown in Figure 4-7. 
The degree of the conductive hearing loss varies with the progres-
sion of  fixation, but the configuration of  the bone- conduction 
thresholds is almost a signature of  the disease. Note that the 
bone-conduction threshold dips slightly at 2000 Hz, refl ecting 
the elimination of  factors that normally contribute to bone-
 conducted hearing due to the fi xation of the stapes into the wall 
of the cochlea. This 2000 Hz notch is often referred to as “Car-
hart’s notch,” named after Raymond Carhart who fi rst described 
this characteristic pattern.
Nodular means a small 
knot or rounded lump.
When a disorder involves 
both ears, it is bilateral.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  151
Otosclerosis is usually treated surgically. The surgical process frees 
the stapes and replaces it with some form of prosthesis to allow 
the ossicular chain to function adequately again.
Other Middle-Ear Disorders
Physical trauma can cause middle-ear disorder. One consequence 
of  trauma is a partial or total disarticulation of  the ossicular 
chain. Ossicular discontinuities include partial fracture of the incus 
with separation of the incudostapedial joint, complete fracture 
of the incus, fracture of the crura of the stapes, and fracture of 
the malleus. Any of these types of ossicular disruptions can result 
in substantial conductive hearing loss. An example of an audio-
gram from an ear with a disarticulated ossicular chain is shown in 
Figure 4-8. A complete disarticulation terminates the impedance-
 matching capabilities of the middle ear by eliminating the stiff-
ness component. In addition, the remaining unattached ossicles 
add mass to the system, resulting in a maximum, fl at conductive 
hearing loss.
The point of articulation 
of the incus and stapes is 
called the incudostapedial 
joint.

152  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
Another form of insult to the middle ear results from barotrauma, 
or trauma related to a sudden, marked change in atmospheric 
pressure. This often occurs when an airplane descends from al-
titude too fast without proper airplane cabin pressure equaliza-
tion or when a diver ascends too rapidly in the water. It can also 
occur under more normal ascending and descending conditions 
if a person’s Eustachian tube is not providing adequate pressure 
equalization. Under both circumstances, a severe negative air 
pressure is created in the middle-ear space due to failure of the 
Eustachian tube to open adequately. If air pressure changes are 
sudden and intense, the tympanic membrane may rupture. If not, 
it is stretched medially, followed by increased blood fl ow, swelling, 
and bruising of the mucosal lining of the middle ear. Effusion then 
forms within the middle ear from the traumatized tissue.
Tumors may also occur within the middle ear. One neoplasm com-
monly found in the middle ear is a glomus tumor, or glomus tym-
panicum. A glomus tumor is a mass of cells with a rich vascular 
supply. It arises from the middle ear and can result in signifi cant

neoplasms of paraganglionic 
tissue with a rich vascular 
supply located near or within

vessels.

conductive hearing loss. One distinctive symptom of this tumor is 
that it often causes pulsatile tinnitus. An untreated glomus tumor 
can encroach on the cochlea, resulting in mixed hearing loss.
SENSORY HEARING DISORDERS
Sensory hearing disorders result from impaired cochlear function. 
Congenital disorders are present at birth and result from structural 
and functional defects of the cochlea, secondary to embryologic 
malformation. Congenital disorders are a common form of sen-
sorineural hearing loss in infancy. Inherited hearing disorders can 
be present at birth or can manifest in adulthood. Acquired sensory 
auditory disorders occur later in life and are caused by excessive 
noise exposure, trauma, infections, ototoxicity, endolymphatic 
 hydrops, presbyacusis, and other infl uences.
Congenital and Inherited Sensory 
Hearing Disorders
Congenital sensory hearing disorders are present at birth. There 
are a number of  causes, both exogenous and endogenous, of 
congenital disorders. Exogenous conditions are those that are not 
necessarily intrinsic to the genetic makeup of an individual. The 
teratogenic effects on the developing infant of certain maternal 
infections or drug ingestion are examples. Endogenous conditions 
are those that are inherited. The actual change in cochlear struc-
ture or function may be identical, whether the cause is exogenous 
or endogenous. In this section, we will first review the actual 
anomalies of the inner ear, followed by a summary of teratogenic 
causes. Endogenous causes are separated into two categories, 
those inherited disorders that occur in syndromes and those in-
herited disorders that appear as hearing loss alone.
Inner-Ear Anomalies 
Inner-ear malformations occur when development of the mem-
branous and/or bony labyrinth is arrested during fetal develop-
ment. Although in many cases the arrest of development is due to 
genetic cause, some cases are the result of teratogenic infl uences 
during pregnancy, including viral infections such as  rubella, 
drugs such as thalidomide, and fetal radiation exposure. Inner-
ear  malformations can be divided into those in which both the 
Pulsatile tinnitus is the 
perception of a pulsing 
sound in the ear that results 
from vascular abnormalities.

154  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
osseous and membranous labyrinths are abnormal and those in 
which only the membranous labyrinth is abnormal. Anomalies 
of the bony labyrinth are better understood because they can be 
readily identifi ed with scanning techniques.
Malformations of both membranous and osseous labyrinths are:
complete labyrinthine aplasia (Michel deformity), 
• 
common cavity defect, 
• 
cochlear aplasia and hyopaplasia, and 
• 
Mondini defect. 
• 
Michel deformity is a very rare malformation characterized by com-
plete absence of membranous and osseous inner-ear structures, re-
sulting in total deafness. The common-cavity malformation is one 
in which the cochlea is not differentiated from the vestibule, usually 
resulting in substantial hearing loss. Cochlear aplasia is a rare mal-
formation consisting of complete absence of the membranous and 
osseous cochlea, with no auditory function, but presence of semi-
circular canals and vestibule. Cochlear hypoplasia is a malformation 
in which less that one full turn of the cochlea is developed. Mondini 
malformation, an incomplete partition of the cochlea, is a relatively 
common inner-ear malformation, in which the cochlea contains 
only about 1.5 turns, and the osseous spiral lamina is partially or 
completely absent. The resulting hearing loss is highly variable. 
Other abnormalities of both the osseous and membranous laby-
rinth include anomalies of the semicircular canals, the internal 
auditory canal, and the cochlear and vestibular aqueducts. One 
example of the latter is large vestibular aqueduct syndrome, a 
malformation of the temporal bone that is associated with early 
onset hearing loss and vestibular disorders. Hearing loss is usually 
progressive, profound, and bilateral. Large vestibular aqueduct 
syndrome is often associated with Mondini malformation.
Malformations limited to the membranous labyrinth are:
complete membranous labyrinth dysplasia (Bing 
• 
Siebenmann),
cochleosaccular dysplasia (Scheibe), and
• 
cochlear basal turn dysplasia (Alexander). 
• 

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  155
The Bing Siebenmann malformation is a rare malformation  resulting 
in complete lack of development of the membranous labyrinth. 
Scheibe aplasia, or cochleosaccular dysplasia, is a common  inner-ear 
abnormality in which there is failure of the organ of Corti to fully de-
velop. Alexander aplasia is an abnormal development of the basal 
turn of the cochlea, with normal development in the remainder 
of the cochlea, resulting in low-frequency residual hearing.
Teratogenic Factors
Sensorineural hearing loss can result from teratogenic effects of 
congenital infections on a mother during embryologic development 
of a fetus.
Congenital infections most commonly associated with sensorineu-
ral hearing loss include:
cytomegalovirus
• 
 (CMV),
human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV),
• 
rubella,
• 
syphilis, and
• 
toxoplasmosis.
• 
CMV is the leading cause of nongenetic congenital hearing loss in 
infants and young children. CMV is a type of herpes virus that can 
be transmitted in utero. Infants with congenital CMV infections are 
most often asymptomatic at birth. In those who develop hearing loss, 
the loss is usually of delayed onset, often asymmetric, progressive, 
and sensorineural. Other complications can include neurodevelop-
mental defi cits, including microcephaly and mental retardation.
HIV is the virus that causes acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome 
(AIDS). Congenital HIV infections are increasingly common and 
can result in substantial neurodevelopmental defi cits. Hearing is 
at risk mostly from opportunistic infections such as meningitis 
that are secondary to the disease or from ototoxic drugs used to 
treat the infections.
Rubella, or German measles, is a viral infection. Prior to vacci-
nation against the disease, congenital infections resulted in tens 
of thousands of children born with congenital rubella syndrome, 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
is a viral infection usually 
transmitted in utero, which 
can cause central nervous 
system disorder, including 
brain damage, hearing loss, 
vision loss, and seizures.
If a person has a moderate 
hearing loss in one ear 
and a severe hearing loss 
in the other, the hearing is 
asymmetric. If the degree 
of hearing loss is the same 
in both ears it is considered 
symmetric.
Microcephaly is an 
abnormal smallness of the 
head.
Measles is a highly 
contagious viral infection, 
characterized by fever, 
cough, conjunctivitis, and 
a rash, which can cause 
signiﬁ cant hearing loss.

156  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
with characteristic features including cardiac defects, congeni-
tal cataracts, and sensorineural hearing loss. In the 1960s and 
1970s, it was the leading nongenetic cause of hearing loss. In 
countries where vaccinations are routine, rubella has been nearly 
eliminated as a causative factor.
Syphilis is a venereal disease, caused by the spirochete Treponema 
pallidum, that can be transmitted from an infected mother to the fe-
tus. Although most children with congenital syphilis will be asymp-
tomatic at birth, a late form of the disease, occurring after 2 years 
of age, can result in progressive sensorineural hearing loss.
Toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite infection, contracted mainly 
through contaminated food or close contact with domestic ani-
mals carrying the infection. Congenital toxoplasmosis can result 
in retinal disease, hydrocephalus, mental retardation, and sen-
sorineural hearing loss.
In addition to infections, some drugs have a teratogenic effect on 
the auditory system of the developing embryo when taken by the 
mother during pregnancy. Ingestion of  these drugs, especially 
early in pregnancy, can result in multiple developmental abnor-
malities, including profound sensorineural hearing loss. These 
drugs include accutane, dilantin, quinine, and thalidomide.
Syndromic Hereditary Hearing Disorder
Hereditary factors are common causes of sensorineural hearing 
loss. Hearing loss of this nature is one of two types. Syndromic 
hearing disorder occurs as part of a constellation of other medical 
and physical disorders that occur together commonly enough to 
constitute a distinct clinical entity. Nonsyndromic hearing disorder 
is an autosomal recessive or dominant genetic condition in which 
there is no other signifi cant feature besides hearing loss.
Genetic inheritance is either related to non-sex-linked (auto-
somal) chromosomes or is linked to the X-chromosome. In au-
tosomal dominant inheritance, only one gene of  a pair must 
carry a genetic characteristic or mutation in order for it to be 
expressed; in autosomal recessive inheritance, both genes of  a 
pair must share the characteristic. X-linked hearing disorder is a 
A spirochete is a slender, 
spiral, motile microorganism 
that can cause infection.
Hydrocephalus is the 
excessive accumulation of 
cerebrospinal ﬂ uid in the 
subarachnoid or subdural 
space of the brain.
Accutane is a retinoic 
acid drug prescribed for 
cystic acne that can have 
a teratogenic effect on 
the auditory system of the 
developing embryo.
Thalidomide is a 
tranquilizing drug that can 
have a teratogenic effect on 
the auditory system of the 
developing embryo.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  157
genetic condition that occurs due to a faulty gene located on the 
X chromosome.
Some of the more common syndromic disorders that can result in 
congenital hearing loss in children are:
Alport syndrome
• 
: genetic syndrome characterized by pro-
gressive kidney disease and sensorineural hearing loss, 
probably resulting from X-linked inheritance through a 
gene that codes for collagen;
Branchio-oto-renal syndrome
• 
: autosomal dominant disorder 
consisting of branchial clefts, ﬁ stulas, and cysts, renal malfor-
mation, and conductive, sensorineural, or mixed hearing loss;
Cervico-oculo-acoustic syndrome
• 
: congenital branchial arch 
syndrome, occurring primarily in females, characterized by 
fusion of two or more cervical vertebrae, with retraction of 
eyeballs, lateral gaze weakness, and hearing loss;
CHARGE association
• 
: genetic association featuring 
coloboma, heart disease, atresia choanae (nasal cavity), 
retarded growth and development, genital hypoplasia, and 
ear anomalies and/or hearing loss that can be conductive, 
sensorineural, or mixed;
Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome
• 
: autosomal recessive car-
diovascular disorder accompanied by congenital bilateral 
profound sensorineural hearing loss;
Pendred syndrome
• 
: autosomal recessive endocrine metabo-
lism disorder resulting in goiter and congenital, symmetric, 
moderate-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss;
Usher syndrome
• 
: autosomal recessive disorder characterized 
by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and progressive 
loss of vision due to retinitis pigmentosa;
Waardenburg syndrome
• 
: autosomal dominant disorder char-
acterized by lateral displacement of the medial canthi, in-
creased width of the root of the nose, multicolored iris, white 
forelock, and mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss.
Although these syndromes are commonly associated with hear-
ing loss, there are over 400 syndromes identifi ed that claim audi-
tory disorder as a component.
Collagen is the main 
protein of connective tissue, 
cartilage, and bone, the age-
related loss of which can 
reduce auricular cartilage 
strength and result in 
collapsed ear canals.
Branchial clefts are a 
series of openings between 
the embryonic branchial 
arches. Branchial arches are a 
series of ﬁ ve pairs of arched 
structures in the embryo that 
play an important role in the 
formation of head and neck 
structures. 
An abnormal passage or 
hole formed within the body 
by disease, surgery, injury, 
or other defect is called a 
ﬁ stula.
Renal pertains to the 
kidneys.
A coloboma is a congenital 
ﬁ ssure (cleft or slit).
Hypoplasia is the 
incomplete development or 
underdevelopment of tissue 
or an organ.
Retinitis pigmentosa is a 
chronic progressive disease 
characterized by retinal-
tissue degeneration and 
optic-nerve atrophy.

158  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
Nonsyndromic Hereditary Hearing Disorder
Approximately 30 percent of hereditary hearing disorders occur 
as part of a syndrome; the other 70 percent are nonsyndromic. 
In fact, nonsyndromic hereditary hearing loss is a primary cause 
of sensorineural hearing loss in infants and young children and 
probably contributes substantially to much of the acquired hear-
ing loss in aging patients. 
The genetic basis for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss is 
becoming increasingly well understood. A number of genes have 
been identifi ed as being associated with hearing loss. Despite size-
able genetic heterogeneity, however, one gene locus, known as 
GJB2 or connexin 26, has been implicated in up to half of prelin-
guistic, nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss.
Hereditary hearing disorder may be present at birth, or it may have 
a delayed onset and be progressive in nature. The majority of non-
syndromic hereditary hearing disorders are autosomal recessive, 
and the hearing loss is predominantly sensorineural in nature. 
An example of a hereditary hearing loss is shown in  Figure 4-9.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  159
 Although not all hereditary hearing losses have this classic confi g-
uration, when this pattern is encountered in the clinic it can most 
often be attributable to a congenital loss of  genetic origin.
Nonsyndromic hearing disorders can be classifi ed in a number of 
ways. Following are general patterns of hereditary hearing loss:
Dominant hereditary hearing loss
• 
: hearing loss due to trans-
mission of a genetic characteristic or mutation in which 
only one gene of a pair must carry the characteristic in 
 order to be expressed, and both sexes have an equal chance 
of being affected;
Dominant progressive hearing loss
• 
: genetic condition in which 
sensorineural hearing loss gradually worsens over a period 
of years, caused by dominant inheritance;
Progressive adult-onset hearing loss
• 
: autosomal recessive non-
syndromic hearing loss with onset in adulthood, character-
ized by progressive, symmetric sensorineural hearing loss;
Recessive hereditary sensorineural hearing loss
• 
: most common 
inherited hearing loss, in which both parents are carriers of 
the gene but only 25% of offspring are affected, occurring in 
either nonsyndromic or syndromic form;
X-linked hearing disorder
• 
: hereditary hearing disorder due 
to a faulty gene located on the X chromosome, such as that 
found in Alport syndrome.
Acquired Sensory Hearing Disorders
Perinatal Factors
Infants who have a traumatic perinatal period are at a signifi cant 
risk for hearing loss. The underlying cause of  the hearing loss 
may be unknown, but hearing loss has been associated with a his-
tory of low birth weight, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, and expo-
sure to potentially ototoxic drugs. Indeed, mere length-of-stay in 
the intensive care nursery (ICN), with all the various potential ad-
verse infl uences on the auditory system, has been associated with 
increased risk for hearing loss. Of all factors, one that has been 
clearly linked to hearing loss is severe respiratory distress at birth.
Persistent pulmonary hypertension of  the newborn (PPHN) is 
a condition in which an infant’s blood flow bypasses the lungs, 

160  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
thereby eliminating oxygen supply to the organs of  the body. 
PPHN is associated with perinatal respiratory problems such as 
meconium aspiration or pneumonia. Sensorineural hearing loss is 
a common complication of PPHN and has been found in approxi-
mately one third of surviving children. Hearing losses range from 
high-frequency unilateral loss to severe-to-profound bilateral loss 
and are progressive in many cases.
PPHN is treated by administration of oxygen or oxygen and nitric 
oxide via a mechanical ventilator. Extracorporeal membrane oxy-
genation (ECMO) is a treatment for PPHN that involves diverting 
blood from the heart and lungs to an external bypass where oxy-
gen and carbon dioxide are exchanged before the blood is reintro-
duced to the body. When ECMO is applied as part of respiratory 
management, it has been associated with hearing loss in up to 
75% of cases. Hearing loss is often progressive. 
Noise-induced Hearing Loss
Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common cause 
of  acquired sensorineural hearing loss other than presbyacu-
sis. NIHL can be temporary or permanent. Exposure to excessive 
sound results in a change in the threshold of hearing sensitivity 
or a threshold shift. If a noise-induced hearing loss is temporary, 
it is referred to as a temporary threshold shift or TTS. If the hearing 
loss is permanent, it is called a permanent threshold shift or PTS.
You have probably experienced TTS. It is a common occurrence fol-
lowing exposure to loud music at a concert or following exposure 
to nearby fi ring of a gun or explosion of fi reworks. The experience 
is usually one of sound seeming to be muffl ed, often accompanied 
by tinnitus. If you listen to your radio or MP3 player while you 
have TTS, you may notice that it just does not sound right.
If the loud sounds to which you were exposed were not of suffi -
cient intensity, or the duration of your exposure was not exces-
sive, your hearing loss will be temporary, and hearing sensitivity 
will return to normal over time. However, if the signal intensity 
and the duration of exposure were of a suffi cient magnitude, your 
hearing loss will be permanent. Repeated exposure will result in a 
progression of the hearing loss.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  161
PTS is typically a gradual hearing loss that occurs from repeated 
exposure to excessive sound. It occurs as a result of outer hair cell 
loss in the cochlea due to metabolic changes from repeated ex-
haustion of the cells. PTS caused by acoustic trauma from a sin-
gle exposure results from mechanical destruction of the organ of 
Corti by excessive pressure waves.
There are several important acoustic factors that make sound po-
tentially damaging to the cochlea:
the intensity of the sound,
• 
the frequency composition of the sound, and
• 
the duration of exposure to the sound.
• 
In general, higher frequency sounds are more damaging than 
lower frequency sounds. Whether or not a particular intensity of 
sound is damaging to an ear depends on the duration of exposure 
to that sound. For example, a broad-spectrum noise with an in-
tensity of 100 dBA is not necessarily dangerous if the duration of 
exposure is below 2 hours per day. However, exposure duration of 
greater than that can result in permanent damage to the ear.
Damage-risk criteria have been established as guidelines for this 
tradeoff between exposure duration and signal intensity. An exam-
ple of commonly accepted damage risk criteria for industry is shown 
in Table 4-2. Exposure above these levels over prolonged periods in 
the workplace will most likely result in signifi cant PTS. Exposure to 
sound below these levels is considered safe by these standards.
Other factors also infl uence the risk of permanent noise-induced 
hearing loss. For example, some individuals are more susceptible 
than others, so that safe damage risk criteria for the population in 
general will not be safe levels for some individuals who are unusu-
ally susceptible. Also, the damaging effects of a given noise can be 
exacerbated by simultaneous exposure to certain ototoxic drugs 
and industrial chemicals.
The most common type of permanent hearing loss from noise 
 exposure is a slowly progressive high-frequency hearing loss that 
occurs from repeated exposure over time. An example of a noise-
induced hearing loss is shown in Figure 4-10. Typically, with TTS

or with PTS in its early form, the confi guration will have a notch 
that peaks in the 4000 to 6000 Hz region of the audiogram. This 
is sometimes referred to as a noise notch or a 4K notch, consistent 
with exposure to excessive noise. As additional exposure occurs, the 
threshold in this region will worsen, followed by a shift in threshold 
at progressively lower frequencies. Figure 4-11 shows the progres-
sion of hearing loss from industrial noise exposure over a period of 
four decades.
Hearing loss that occurs from acoustic trauma as a result of a sin-
gle exposure to excessive sound may resemble the noise-induced

resulted from a single exposure to an early cordless telephone 
that rang as the user held the phone up to his ear. The level of the 
sound was estimated to be over 140 dB SPL, resulting in a rela-
tively fl at, moderate sensorineural hearing loss.
Trauma
In addition to acoustic trauma, other insults to the auditory sys-
tem can cause signifi cant hearing loss. Physical trauma that re-
sults in a transverse fracture of the temporal bone can cause 
extensive destruction of the membranous labyrinth. This type of 
trauma is often caused by a blow to the occipital region of  the 
skull. Recall that a longitudinal fracture can result in damage to 
the middle-ear structures, but seldom to the cochlea. Conversely, 
a transverse fracture tends to spare the middle ear and damage 
the cochlea. Depending on the extent of  the labyrinthine de-
struction, the sensorineural hearing loss can be quite severe.
Another form of trauma occurs as a result of radionecrosis, or 
the death of tissue due to excessive exposure to radiation. Injury 
to the auditory system secondary to X-ray irradiation occurs as 
Transverse means a slice in 
the horizontal plane.
Longitudinal means 
lengthwise.
When tissue dies due 
to excessive exposure 
to radiation it is called 
radionecrosis, which in 
the auditory system may 
occur immediately following 
exposure or have a later 
onset.

a result of atrophy of the spiral and annular ligaments causing 
degeneration of the organ of Corti. Hearing loss of this nature is 
sensorineural, progressive, and usually has a delayed onset.  X-ray 
irradiation injury is increasingly common as radio-surgery is used 
in an effort to irradiate acoustic tumors.
Infections
Sensorineural hearing loss can result from acquired infections, 
the pathogens from which can directly insult the membranous 
labyrinth of children or adults.
Infections from bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause sen-
sorineural hearing loss. Bacterial infections can cause in-
flammation of  the membranous labyrinth of  the cochlea, or 
labyrinthitis, through several routes. Serous or toxic labyrinthi-
tis is an infl ammation of the labyrinth caused by bacterial con-
tamination of  the tissue and fl uids, either by invasion through 
the middle ear (otogenic) or via the meninges (meningogenic). 
Serous labyrinthitis may be transient, resulting in mild hearing 
loss and dizziness. In more severe forms, however, it can be toxic 
to the sensory cells of  the cochlea, causing substantial sen-
sorineural hearing loss. Serous labyrinthitis sometimes occurs 
secondary to serous otitis media, presumably from the bacterial 
toxins traveling through the membranes of  the oval or round 
windows. It may also occur secondary to meningitis, with the 
inflammation traveling along the brain’s linings to the mem-
branous labyrinth of the cochlea.
Bacterial infections can also cause otogenic suppurative labyrinthitis. 
In this type of infection, bacteria invade the cochlea from the tem-
poral bone. The pus formation in the infection can cause permanent 
and severe damage to the cochlear labyrinth, resulting in substan-
tial sensorineural hearing loss.
Meningitis is an infl ammation of the membranes that surround 
the brain and spinal cord caused by bacteria or viruses. The 
greatest frequency of  hearing loss occurs in cases of  bacterial 
meningitis, with estimates ranging from 5 to 35% of  cases. 
Other common signs and symptoms of bacterial meningitis in-
clude  fever, seizures, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. 
Hearing disorder ranges from mild to profound sensitivity loss or 
Atrophy is the wasting 
away or shrinking of a 
normally developed organ 
or tissue.
The three membranes of the 
brain and spinal cord, the

pia mater, are called the 
meninges.

166  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
total deafness and may be progressive. Cochlear osteoneogenesis, 
or bony growth in the cochlea, may occur following meningitis.
Some of  the more common acquired viral infections that can 
cause sensorineural hearing loss include herpes zoster oticus, 
mumps, and measles.
Herpes zoster oticus, or Ramsay Hunt syndrome, is caused by a vi-
rus that also causes chicken pox. The virus, often acquired during 
childhood, can lie dormant for years in the central nervous sys-
tem. At some point in time, due to changes in the immune sys-
tem or to the presence of systemic disease, the virus is reactivated, 
causing burning pain around the ear, skin eruptions in the exter-
nal auditory meatus and concha, facial nerve paralysis, dizziness, 
and sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing loss is of varying degree 
and often has a high-frequency audiometric confi guration.
Mumps, or epidemic parotitis, is an acute systemic viral disease, 
most often occurring in childhood after the age of 2 years. De-
pending on severity, it usually causes painful swelling of  the 
 parotid  glands and can cause a number of  complications re-
lated to encephalitis. Despite the systemic nature of the disease, 
hearing loss is peculiar in that it is almost always unilateral in 
nature. Because of this, it often goes undiagnosed until later in 
life. Mumps is probably the single most common cause of unilat-
eral sensorineural hearing loss, and the loss is usually profound.
Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that characteristically 
causes symptoms of rash, cough, fever, conjunctivitis, and white 
spots in the mouth. Hearing loss is a common complication of 
the measles virus. Prior to widespread vaccination in the United 
States, measles accounted for 5 to 10% of all cases of profound, 
bilateral, sensorineural hearing loss. Measles is still a signifi cant 
cause of hearing loss and deafness in other parts of the world.
Another cause of hearing loss from acquired infection is syphilis, a 
venereal disease that can also cause congenital hearing loss. Syphi-
lis is usually described in terms of clinical stages, from primary in-
fection, through secondary involvement of other organs, to tertiary 
involvement of the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Hearing 
loss from otosyphilis occurs in the secondary or tertiary stages and 
Mumps is a contagious 
systemic viral disease, 
characterized by painful 
enlargement of the parotid 
glands, fever, headache, 
and malaise, that can 
cause sudden, permanent, 
profound unilateral 
sensorineural hearing loss.
The parotid glands are the 
salivary glands near the ear.
Encephalitis is 
inﬂ ammation of the brain.
Syphilis is a congenital 
or acquired disease caused 
by a spirochete, which in 
its secondary and tertiary 
stages can cause auditory 
and vestibular disorders.
Tertiary means third in 
order.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  167
results from membranous labyrinthitis associated with acute men-
ingitis or osteitis of the temporal bone. Hearing loss from syphilis is 
not unlike that from Ménière’s disease, characterized by fl uctuation 
attacks and progression in severity. An example of a hearing loss 
from otosyphilis is shown in Figure 4-13. Besides the fl uctuation 
and progression, another common finding is disproportionately 
poor speech recognition ability.
Ototoxicity
Certain drugs and chemicals are toxic to the cochlea. Ototoxicity 
can be acquired or congenital. Acquired ototoxicity results from 
the ingestion of certain drugs that are administered for medical 
purposes, such as in the treatment of infections and cancer. Oto-
toxicity can also result from excessive exposure to certain environ-
mental toxins. Congenital ototoxicity, as discussed earlier, results 
from the teratogenic effects of drugs administered to the mother 
during pregnancy.
The aminoglycosides are a group of  antibiotics that are often 
 ototoxic. They are used primarily against bacterial infections. 
Osteitis is inﬂ ammation of 
the bone.

Some of the aminoglycosides have a predilection for hair cells of 
the cochlea (cochleotoxic), while others have a predilection for hair 
cells of the vestibular end-organs (vestibulotoxic). Most of these an-
tibiotics can be used in smaller doses to effectively fi ght infection 
without causing ototoxicity. Sometimes, however, the infections 
must be treated aggressively with high doses, resulting in signifi -
cant sensorineural hearing loss. Ototoxic antibiotics include:
amikacin,
• 
dihydrostreptomycin,
• 
garamycin,
• 
gentamicin,
• 
kanamycin,
• 
neomycin,
• 
netilmicin,
• 
streptomycin,
• 
tobramycin, and 
• 
viomycin.
• 
Other drugs that are ototoxic have been developed in the fi ght 
against cancer. Carboplatin and cisplatin are antimitotic and 
antineoplastic drugs often used in cancer treatment. It is not 
unusual for patients who undergo chemotherapy regimens that 
contain either or both of these drugs to develop permanent sen-
sorineural hearing loss.
Hearing loss from ototoxicity is usually permanent, sensorineu-
ral, bilateral, and symmetric. The mechanism for damage varies 
depending on the drug, but, in general, hearing loss results ini-
tially from damage to the outer hair cells of the cochlea at its basal 
end. Thus, the hearing loss typically begins as a high-frequency 
loss and progresses to lower frequencies with additional drug ex-
posure. An example of a hearing loss resulting from ototoxicity 
due to cisplatin chemotherapy is shown in Figure 4-14.
Some drugs cause ototoxicity that is reversible. Antimalarial drugs, 
including chloroquine and quinine, have been associated with 
ototoxicity. Typically, the hearing loss from these drugs is tempo-
rary. However, in high doses the loss can be permanent.
Predilection means a 
partiality or preference.
Antineoplastic refers to 
an agent that prevents the 
development, growth, or 
proliferation of tumor cells.
Quinine is an antimalarial 
drug that can have a 
teratogenic effect on the 
auditory system of the 
developing embryo.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  169
Drugs known as salicylates can also be ototoxic. Salicylates such 
as acetylsalicylic acid and aspirin are used as therapeutic agents 
in the treatment of arthritis and other connective tissue disorders. 
Hearing loss is usually reversible and accompanied by tinnitus. In 
the case of salicylate intoxication, the hearing loss often has a fl at 
rather than a steeply sloping confi guration. An example is shown 
in Figure 4-15.
Loop diuretics, including ethacrynic acid, furosemide, and lasix, 
are used to promote the excretion of urine by inhibiting resorp-
tion of sodium and water in the kidneys. Hearing loss from loop 
diuretics may be reversible or permanent.
Other ototoxic substances include industrial solvents, such as 
 styrene, toluene, and trichlorethylene, which can be ototoxic 
if inhaled in high concentrations over extended periods. Potas-
sium bromate, a chemical neutralizer used in food preservatives 
and other commercial applications, has also been associated 
with ototoxicity.
Lasix is an ototoxic 
loop diuretic used in 
the treatment of edema 
(swelling) or hypertension, 
which can cause a 
sensorineural hearing loss 
secondary to degeneration 
of the stria vascularis.

Ménière’s Disease
A common disorder of the cochlea is endolymphatic hydrops. En-
dolymphatic hydrops is a condition resulting from excessive accu-
mulation of endolymph in the cochlear and vestibular labyrinths. 
This excessive accumulation of endolymph often causes Ménière’s 
disease, a constellation of symptoms of episodic vertigo, hearing 
loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. The name of this syndrome is 
derived from the French scientist, Prosper Ménière, who in 1861 
fi rst attributed the diverse symptoms of dizziness, vomiting, and 
hearing loss to a disorder of the inner ear rather than the central 
nervous system.
The classic symptoms of Ménière’s disease are an attack of ver-
tigo with hearing loss, tinnitus, and pressure in the involved ear. 
The hearing loss is typically unilateral, fl uctuating, progressive, 
and sensorineural. The feeling of pressure, the sensation of tin-
nitus, and hearing loss often build up before an attack of vertigo, 
which is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The spells 
can last from minutes to 2 or 3 hours and often include unsteadi-
ness between spells. In the early stages of the disease, attacks are 
dominated by vertigo, and recovery can be complete. In the later 
Ménière’s Disease, 
named after Prosper 
Ménière, is idiopathic 
endolymphatic hydrops, 
characterized by ﬂ uctuating 
vertigo, hearing loss, 
tinnitus, and aural fullness.
Episodic vertigo is the 
repeated occurrence of 
dizziness.

stages, attacks are dominated by hearing loss and tinnitus, and 
permanent, severe hearing loss can occur.
The underlying cause of  Ménière’s disease is endolymphatic 
 hydrops. The underlying cause of endolymphatic hydrops is most 
often unknown, although sometimes it can be attributed to allergy, 
vascular insult, physical trauma, syphilis, acoustic trauma, viral in-
sult, or other causes. In the early stages of Ménière’s disease, the 
buildup of endolymph occurs mainly within the cochlear duct and 
saccule. Essentially, these structures distend or dilate from an in-
crease in fl uid and cause ruptures of the membranous labyrinth.
Although Ménière’s disease usually involves both the auditory 
and vestibular mechanisms, two variant forms exist, so-called 
cochlear Ménière’s disease and vestibular Ménière’s disease. In the 
cochlear form of  the disease, only the auditory symptoms are 
present, without vertigo. In the vestibular form, only the vertigi-
nous episodes are present, without hearing loss.
Hearing loss from Ménière’s disease is most often unilateral, sen-
sorineural, and fl uctuating. In the early stages of the disease, the 
hearing loss confi guration is often low frequency in nature. An 
example is shown in Figure 4-16. After repeated attacks, the loss 
usually progresses into a fl at, moderate-to-severe hearing loss, as 
shown in Figure 4-17. One common feature of Ménière’s disease 
is poor speech-recognition ability, much poorer than would be ex-
pected from the degree of hearing sensitivity loss.
Presbyacusis
Presbyacusis (or presbycusis) is a decline in hearing as a part of the 
aging process. As a collective cause, it is the leading contributor to 
hearing loss in adults. Estimates suggest that from 25 to 40% of 
those over the age of 65 years have some degree of hearing loss. 
The percentage increases to approximately 90% of those over the 
age of 90 years.
All hearing loss that is present in aging individuals is not, of course, 
due to the aging process per se. During a lifetime, an individual can 
be exposed to excessive noise, vascular and systemic disease, dietary 
infl uences, environmental toxins, ototoxic drugs, and so on. Add to 
these any genetic predisposition to hearing loss, and you may begin 
to wonder how anyone’s hearing can be normal in older age. If you

were able to restrict exposure to all of these factors, you would be 
able to study the specifi c effects of the aging process on the auditory 
structures. What you would likely fi nd is that a portion of hearing 
loss is attributable to the aging process, and a portion is attributable 
to the exposure of the ears to the world for the number of years it took 
to become old. How much is attributable to each can be estimated, 
although it will never be truly known in an individual. Regardless, if 
we think of living as a contributing factor to the aging process, then 
the hearing loss that occurs with aging, which cannot be attributed 
to other causative factors, can be considered presbyacusis.
Structures throughout the auditory system degenerate with age. 
Changes in cochlear hair cells, the stria vascularis, the spiral 
ligament, and the cochlear neurons all conspire to create senso-
rineural hearing loss. Changes in the auditory nerve, brainstem, 
and cortex conspire to create auditory processing disorder.
Hearing sensitivity loss from presbyacusis is bilateral, usually 
symmetric, progressive, and sensorineural. An example of  the 
effects of aging is shown in Figure 4-18. The systematic decline

ferences in the audiometric confi gurations of males and females 
attributable to aging. As shown in Figure 4-19, men tend to have 
more high- frequency hearing loss, and women tend to have fl at-
ter audiometric configurations. When noise exposure is con-
trolled, the amount of high-frequency hearing loss is similar in 
the two groups, but women tend to have more low-frequency 
hearing loss.

changes in the central auditory nervous system. An example is 
shown in Figure 4-20.
Autoimmune Inner-Ear Disease
Autoimmune inner-ear disease (AIED) is an auditory disorder 
characterized by bilateral, asymmetric, progressive, sensorineural 
hearing sensitivity loss in patients who test positively for autoim-
mune disease. It tends to be diagnosed on the basis of exclusion 
of other causes, but it is increasingly attributed as the causative 
factor in progressive sensorineural hearing loss. An example of 
AIED hearing loss is shown in Figure 4-21. The asymmetry and 
progression are the signature characteristics of the disorder. The 
hearing sensitivity loss may be responsive to immunosuppressive 
drugs, such as steroids.
Autoimmune refers to 
a disordered immunologic 
response in which the body 
produces antibodies against 
its own tissues.

Cochlear Otosclerosis
The same otosclerosis that can fi x the stapes footplate into the 
oval window can occur within the cochlea and result in sen-
sorineural hearing loss. Recall that otosclerosis is a disorder of 
bone growth that affects the stapes and the bony labyrinth of 
the cochlea. The disease process is characterized by resorption 
of bone and new spongy formation around the stapes and oval 
window. Depending on the extent of  cochlear involvement, a 
sensorineural hearing loss can occur. Although there is some 
debate about whether a sensorineural hearing loss can occur 
in isolation, it is certainly theoretically possible. Nevertheless, 
 cochlear otosclerosis is commonly accompanied by fi xation of the 
stapes, resulting in a mixed hearing loss. An example of this type 
of hearing loss is shown in Figure 4-22.

Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss
Idiopathic sudden hearing loss is a term that is used to describe a 
sudden, often unilateral, sensorineural hearing loss. Idiopathic 
sudden hearing loss is often noticed upon awakening and is usu-
ally accompanied by tinnitus. The extent of  the sensorineural 
hearing loss ranges from mild to profound. Partial or full recov-
ery of hearing occurs in approximately 75% of patients. The term 
idiopathic is used because the cause is often unknown, although 
viral or vascular infl uences are usually suspected.
NEURAL HEARING DISORDERS
Any disease or disorder process that affects the peripheral and 
central nervous system can, of course, result in auditory disorder 
if the auditory nervous system is involved. Neoplastic growths on 
the VIIIth nerve or in the auditory brainstem, cranial nerve neu-
ritis, multiple sclerosis, and brain infarcts can all cause some form 
of auditory disorder.
Idiopathic is of an 
unknown cause.
Infarcts are localized areas 
of ischemic necrosis.
An infarction is the sudden 
insufﬁ ciency of blood supply 
due to occlusion of arterial 
supply or venous drainage.

178  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
The nature of hearing impairment that accompanies central au-
ditory nervous system disorder varies as a function of location of 
the disorder. A disorder of the VIIIth nerve is likely to result in a 
sensorineural hearing loss with poor speech understanding. The 
likelihood of a hearing sensitivity loss diminishes as the disorder 
becomes more central, so that a brainstem lesion is less likely than 
an VIIIth nerve lesion to cause a sensitivity loss, and a temporal 
lobe lesion is quite unlikely to cause such a loss. Similarly, dis-
orders of speech perception become more subtle as the disorder 
 becomes more central.
Auditory Neuropathy
Auditory neuropathy is a term that is used to describe a dis-
order in the synchrony of  neural activity of  the VIIIth cranial 
nerve. It is operationally defined based on a constellation of 
clinical findings that suggest normal functioning of  some co-
chlear structures and abnormal functioning of the VIIIth nerve 
and brainstem.
In reality, the term auditory neuropathy as it is defi ned clinically 
probably describes two fairly different disorders, one sensory and 
the other neural. The auditory neuropathy of sensory origin—
AN(S)—is a sensory hearing disorder that represents a transduc-
tion problem, with the failure of the cochlea to transmit signals 
to the auditory nerve. The most likely origin of AN(S) is the in-
ner hair cells of the cochlea with normally functioning outer hair 
cells serving little or no purpose. The hearing loss from AN(S) acts 
like any other sensitivity loss in terms of its infl uence on speech 
and language acquisition and its amenability to hearing aids and 
cochlear implants.
Auditory neuropathy of  neural origin—AN(N)—was first de-
scribed as a specific disorder of the auditory nerve that results 
in a loss of synchrony of neural fi ring. Because of the nature of 
the disorder, it is also referred to as auditory dys-synchrony. The 
cause of auditory neuropathy is often unknown, although it may 
be observed in cases of syndromic peripheral pathologies. The age 
of onset is usually before 10 years. Hearing sensitivity loss ranges 
from normal to profound and is most often fl at or reverse-sloped 

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  179
in configuration. The hearing loss often fluctuates and may be 
progressive. Speech perception is often substantially poorer than 
what would be expected from the audiogram.
VIIIth Nerve Tumors and Disorders
The most common neoplastic growth affecting the auditory nerve 
is called a cochleovestibular schwannoma. The more generic 
terms acoustic tumor or acoustic neuroma are typically referring to 
a cochleovestibular schwannoma. Other terms used to describe 
this tumor are acoustic neurinoma and acoustic neurilemoma.
A cochleovestibular schwannoma is a benign, encapsulated tu-
mor composed of Schwann cells that arises from the VIIIth cranial 
nerve. Schwann cells serve to produce and maintain the myelin 
that ensheathes the axons of the VIIIth nerve. This tumor aris-
ing from the proliferation of Schwann cells is benign in that it is 
slow growing, is encapsulated, thereby avoiding local invasion of 
tissue, and does not disseminate to other parts of the nervous sys-
tem. Acoustic tumors are unilateral and most often arise from the 
vestibular branch of the VIIIth nerve. Thus, they are sometimes 
referred to as vestibular schwannomas.
The effects of a cochleovestibular schwannoma depend on its size, 
location, and the extent of  the pressure it places on the VIIIth 
nerve and brainstem. Auditory symptoms may include tinnitus, 
hearing loss, and unsteadiness. Depending on the extent of the 
tumor’s impact, it may cause headache, motor incoordination 
from cerebellar involvement, and involvement of adjacent cranial 
nerves. For example, involvement of the Vth cranial nerve can 
cause facial numbness, involvement of the VIIth cranial nerve 
can cause facial weakness, and involvement of the IVth cranial 
nerve can cause diplopia.
Among the most common symptoms of  cochleovestibular 
schwannoma are unilateral tinnitus and unilateral hearing loss. 
The hearing loss varies in degree depending on the location and 
size of the tumor. An example of a hearing loss resulting from an 
acoustic tumor is shown in Figure 4-23. Speech understanding 
typically is disproportionately poor for the  degree of hearing loss.
Cochleovestibular 
schwannoma is the proper 
term for acoustic neuroma.
When a tumor is benign, 
it is nonmalignant or 
noncancerous.
The tissue enveloping the 
axon of myelinated nerve 
ﬁ bers is called myelin.
Axons are the efferent 
processes of a neuron that 
conduct impulses away from 
the cell body and other cell 
processes.
Diplopia means double 
vision.

180  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
One other important form of schwannoma is neurofi bromatosis. 
This tumor disorder has two distinct types. Neurofibromatosis 1 
(NF-1), also known as von Recklinghausen’s disease, is an auto-
somal dominant disease characterized by café-au-lait spots and 
multiple cutaneous tumors, with associated optic gliomas, pe-
ripheral and spinal neurofi bromas, and, rarely, acoustic neuro-
mas. In contrast, Neurofi bromatosis 2 (NF-2) is characterized by 
bilateral cochleovestibular schwannomas. The schwannomas are 
faster growing and more virulent than the unilateral type. This is 
also an autosomal dominant disease and is associated with other 
intracranial tumors. Hearing loss in NF-2 is not particularly dif-
ferent from the unilateral type of schwannoma, except that it is 
bilateral and often progresses more rapidly.
In addition to cochleovestibular schwannoma, a number of other 
types of tumors, cysts, and aneurysms can affect the VIIIth nerve 
and the cerebellopontine angle, where the VIIIth nerve enters the 
brainstem. These other neoplastic growths, such as lipoma and 
meningioma, occur more rarely than cochleovestibular schwan-
noma. The effect of these various forms of tumor on hearing is 
usually indistinguishable.
Café-au-lait spots are 
brown birthmarklike spots 
that appear on the skin.
Tumors on the skin are called 
cutaneous tumors.
Cerebellopontine angle 
is the anatomical angle 
formed by the proximity 
of the cerebellum and the 
pons from which the VIIIth 
cranial nerve exits into the 
brainstem.
Meningiomas are benign 
tumors that may encroach 
on the cerebellopontine 
angle, resulting in a 
retrocochlear disorder.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  181
In addition to acoustic tumors, other disease processes can affect 
the function of the VIIIth nerve. Two important neural disorders 
are cochlear neuritis and diabetic cranial neuropathy.
Not unlike any cranial nerve, the VIIIth nerve can develop neu-
ritis, or infl ammation of the nerve. Although rare, acute cochlear 
neuritis can occur as a result of a direct viral attack on the co-
chlear portion of the nerve. This results in degeneration of the 
cochlear neurons in the ear. Hearing loss is sensorineural and 
often sudden and severe. It is accompanied by poorer speech un-
derstanding than would be expected from the degree of hearing 
loss. One specifi c form of this disease occurs as a result of syphilis. 
Meningo-neuro-labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the membra-
nous labyrinth and VIIIth nerve that occurs as a predominant le-
sion in early congenital syphilis or in acute attacks of secondary 
and tertiary syphilis.
Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder caused by a defi ciency of 
insulin, with chronic complications including neuropathy and 
generalized degenerative changes in blood vessels. Neuropathies 
can involve the central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous sys-
tems. When neuropathy from diabetes affects the auditory system, 
it usually results in vestibular disorder and hearing loss consistent 
with retrocochlear disorder.
Brainstem Disorders
Brainstem disorders that affect the auditory system include in-
farcts, gliomas, and multiple sclerosis. Brainstem infarcts are lo-
calized areas of ischemia produced by interruption of the blood 
supply. Auditory disorder varies depending on the site and extent 
of the disorder. Two syndromes related to vascular lesions that in-
clude hearing loss are inferior pontine syndrome and lateral inferior 
pontine syndrome. Inferior pontine syndrome results from a vascu-
lar lesion of the pons involving several cranial nerves. Symptoms 
include ipsilateral facial palsy, ipsilateral sensorineural hearing 
loss, loss of taste from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, and 
paralysis of lateral conjugate gaze movement of the eyes. Lateral 
inferior pontine syndrome results from a vascular lesion of the in-
ferior pons, with symptoms that include facial palsy, loss of taste 
from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, analgesia of the face, 
Ischemia results from a 
localized shortage of blood 
due to obstruction of blood 
supply.
Analgesia means the 
reduction or abolition of 
sensitivity to pain.

182  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
paralysis of lateral conjugate gaze movements, and sensorineural 
hearing loss.
A glioma is a tumor composed of neuroglia, or supporting cells of 
the brain. It comes in various forms, depending on the types of 
cells involved, including astrocytomas, ependymomas, glioblas-
tomas, and medulloblastomas. Any of these can affect the au-
ditory pathways of the brainstem, resulting in various forms of 
retrocochlear hearing disorder, including hearing sensitivity loss 
and speech perception defi cits.
Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease. It is caused by an 
autoimmune reaction of the nervous system that results in small 
scattered areas of demyelination and the development of demy-
elinated plaques. During the disease process, there is local swell-
ing of tissue that exacerbates symptoms, followed by periods of 
remission. If the demyelination process affects structures of the 
auditory nervous system, hearing disorder can result. There is 
no characteristic hearing sensitivity loss that emerges as a conse-
quence of the disorder, although all possible confi gurations have 
been described. Speech perception defi cits are not uncommon in 
patients with multiple sclerosis.
Temporal-Lobe Disorder
Cerebrovascular accident, or stroke, is caused by an interruption of 
blood supply to the brain due to aneurysm, embolism, or clot. This 
results in sudden loss of function related to the damaged portion 
of the brain. When this occurs in the temporal lobe, audition may 
be affected, although more typically, receptive language process-
ing is affected while hearing perception is relatively spared. Indeed, 
hearing ability is seldom impaired except in the case of bilateral 
temporal lobe lesions. In such cases, “cortical deafness” can oc-
cur, resulting in symptoms that resemble auditory agnosia.
Other Nervous System Disorders
Any other disease processes, lesions, or trauma that affect the cen-
tral nervous system can affect the central auditory nervous sys-
tem. For example, AIDS is a disease that compromises the effi cacy 
of the immune system, resulting in opportunistic infectious dis-
eases that can affect central auditory nervous system structures. 
Astrocytoma is a central 
nervous system tumor 
consisting of astrocytes, 
which are star-shaped 
neuroglia cells.
Glioblastoma is a rapidly 
growing and malignant 
tumor composed of 
undifferentiated glial cells.
Medulloblastoma is a 
malignant tumor that often 
invades the meninges.
A demyelinating disease 
is an autoimmune disease 
process that causes scattered 
patches of demyelination 
of white matter throughout 
the central nervous system, 
resulting in retrocochlear 
disorder when the auditory 
nervous system is affected.
Agnosia means the lack of 
sensory-perceptual ability to 
recognize stimuli.
Opportunistic 
Infections are those that 
take advantage of the 
opportunity afforded by a 
weakened physiologic state 
of the host.
Ependymoma is a 
glioma derived from 
undifferentiated cells from 
the ependyma, the cellular 
membrane lining the brain 
ventricles

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  183
When these structures are affected, auditory disorder occurs, usu-
ally resembling retrocochlear or auditory processing disorder.
VESTIBULAR DISORDERS
The auditory and vestibular endorgans are neighbors, housed 
within the same bony labyrinth of the temporal lobe. By proximity 
alone, it is easy to understand why a disorder that affects one may 
affect the other. A number of conditions that cause hearing loss 
can also cause balance disorders of a vestibular nature. Although 
the two often occur together, they can occur in isolation.
One of  the hallmarks of  vestibular disorder is vertigo, or the 
 abnormal sensation of motion. Recall from Chapter 2 that the 
 vestibular system serves to orient the head in space by responding 
to movement. The vestibular system serves as the internal moni-
tor for motion, just as the visual and somatosensory systems serve 
as the external monitors for movement. A disordered vestibular 
system either sends signals to the brain of head movement that 
is not occurring or sends inaccurate signals about the nature and 
extent of head movement. In either case, the confl ict between re-
ality and this misinformation causes a misperception of motion, 
or an illusion of movement. A patient with a disorder of the ves-
tibular labyrinth is likely to experience true vertigo. Other forms 
of balance disturbance, such as lightheadedness, loss of balance, 
and nonspecifi c dizziness are more likely caused by central or sys-
temic disorders than by vestibular disorders.
Some hearing disorders are accompanied by vestibular disor-
ders. Recall that many of the congenital inner-ear anomalies af-
fect the membranous and bony labyrinths of both the auditory 
and vestibular systems. Similarly, a number of syndromes with 
characteristic hearing disorders include a disturbance of  the 
vestibular mechanism. Some acquired etiologies, such as menin-
gitis or syphilis, can affect both auditory and vestibular systems 
simultaneously.
In other cases, vestibular disorders can occur in isolation. The 
primary disorders causing vertigo without hearing loss include 
benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), semicircular canal 
Vertigo is the perception of 
the sensation of spinning or 
whirling.
Paroxysmal refers to the 
abrupt, recurrent onset of a 
symptom.

184  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
dehiscence, vestibulotoxicity, and vestibular neuritis. In addition, 
Ménière’s disease is a signifi cant cause of vestibular disorder with 
or without accompanying hearing loss.
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo
BPPV is a disorder characterized by an abrupt onset of vertigo in 
response to a positional change of the head. It usually occurs in 
episodes that last only a short duration. It is not uncommon for 
Dehiscence is the 
formation of a separation, 
slit, or cleft.
Where I Live: Nashville, Tennessee
Where I Work: The Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Center 
(VBWC). The VBWC is located within the Vanderbilt Univer-
sity Medical Center, a large tertiary medical center serving 
middle Tennessee. The VBWC serves patients with diseases 
of the ear, nose, throat, head, and neck, and with hearing, 
speech, language, and related disorders. Thousands of patients 
are served every year by the VBWC through patient care, pro-
fessional education, and clinical research. The Center is comprised of Vanderbilt’s Department 
of Otolaryngology and Department of Hearing and Speech Sciences.
What I Do: My primary responsibility is as co-director of the Vanderbilt Bill Wilkerson Bal-
ance Disorders Laboratory, which is a diagnostic clinic where I conduct tests, the results of 
which help physicians determine the cause of dizziness, disequilibrium, and vertigo. I also con-
duct assessments of patients who may be at risk for falling. Through this assessment, I can 
determine what factors place a patient most at risk for falls and make recommendations to the 
referring physician for reducing that risk. I am actively involved in clinical research focusing 
on patients suffering from dizziness, and I teach graduate classes covering the electrophysi-
ological assessment of the vestibular and auditory systems to audiology doctoral students.
Why Audiology? Two reasons. First, my mother is an audiologist, and early on in life I 
was afforded the opportunity to see the positive impact that this profession has on people and 
how helping them resulted in a great deal of personal satisfaction. Secondly, there is always an 
opportunity to keep learning. Whether your primary interest lies in diagnostics or rehabilita-
tion, there is always more you can learn, whether through reading or observation, to make 
yourself a better clinician and/or researcher.

the condition to be worse in the morning and be precipitated by 
turning over in bed, getting out of bed, or walking up stairs. BPPV 
is by far the most common cause of vertigo of vestibular origin.
In some patients BPPV is transient, lasting several months, and 
resolves spontaneously. In others, this acute condition occurs in-
termittently with active and inactive periods over a span of years. 
BPPV is also chronic in some patients, with symptoms lasting over 
long durations.
BPPV can result from definable causes, including viral labyrin-
thitis, otitis media, or head trauma. However, in most cases it oc-
curs spontaneously due to a condition known as canalithiasis. 
Canalithiasis occurs when free-fl oating otoconia, dislodged from 
the utricle, gravitate abnormally to the cupula of  the superior 
semicircular canal. The cupula, which is not normally sensitive to 
gravitational forces, is stimulated abnormally by the debris with 
changes in head position. This condition may affect the lateral 
 canal as well.
Superior Canal Dehiscence
Superior canal dehiscence results from erosion of the bone overly-
ing the superior semicircular canal. This has the effect of adding 
a third window to the inner ear, along with the normal oval and 
round windows.
Patients with canal dehiscence can experience vertigo in re-
sponse to loud sound, changes in middle-ear pressure, or changes 
in intracranial pressure. The window created by the dehiscence 
acts to transduce these pressure changes into fl uid motion in the 
vestibular membranous labyrinth, resulting in the abnormal 
perception of movement.
Vestibulotoxicity 
As you learned earlier in this chapter, various drugs and chemical 
agents can be toxic to the hair cells of the auditory or the vestibu-
lar system or both. Those that primarily affect the auditory sys-
tem are known as cochleotoxic, and those that primarily affect the 
vestibular system are known as vestibulotoxic. Although certain 
drugs have a predilection for one system or another, those that are 

186  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
particularly harmful, the aminoglycocide antibiotics, are likely to 
cause permanent, mixed toxicity if given in high enough doses.
Vestibulotoxicity causes reduced vestibular function bilaterally. 
Because the disorder is symmetric, it seldom results in vertigo be-
cause both sides are responding equally poor. Instead, symptoms 
usually include ataxia and oscillopsia.
Vestibular Neuritis
Vestibular neuritis is an infl ammation of the vestibular nerve. The 
infl ammation may have a viral or vascular cause and it most often 
affects the superior division of the nerve.
Vestibular neuritis is characterized by a sudden onset of vertigo 
without auditory symptoms. The vertigo is usually severe and pro-
longed, resulting in nausea and vomiting. Another symptom of ves-
tibular neuritis is postural instability, resulting in an unsteady gait.
Ménière’s Disease
As described earlier, Ménière’s disease is a disorder of the inner ear 
caused by excessive buildup of endolymph within the membranous 
labyrinth. The classic symptoms of the disorder are episodes of ver-
tigo, fl uctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. The au-
ditory symptoms are usually unilateral. Variations of the disorder 
have been reported that include symptoms isolated to the auditory 
system, so-called cochlear Ménière’s disease, or symptoms isolated 
to the vestibular system, vestibular Ménière’s disease.
The vertigo associated with Ménière’s disease is often severe and 
debilitating. Attacks are frequent and can last for hours. The ver-
tigo is most often rotatory in nature.
Summary
There are several major categories of pathology or noxious in-
• 
fl uences that can adversely affect the auditory system, includ-
ing developmental defects, infections, toxins, trauma, vascular 
disorders, neural disorders, immune system disorders, bone 
disorders, aging disorder, tumors and other neoplastic growths, 
and disorders of unknown or multiple causes.
Ataxia is abnormal gait 
and balance.
Oscillopsia is a blurring of 
vision during movement.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  187
Disorders of  the outer and middle ear are commonly of two 
• 
types, either structural defects due to embryologic malforma-
tions or structural changes secondary to infection or trauma. 
Another common abnormality, otosclerosis, is a bone disorder.
Microtia and atresia are congenital malformations of the au-
• 
ricle and external auditory canal. Microtia is an abnormal 
smallness of the auricle. It is one of a variety of auricular mal-
formations. Atresia is the absence of an opening of the external 
auditory meatus.
One common cause of transient hearing disorder is the accumu-
• 
lation and impaction of cerumen in the external auditory canal.
The most common cause of transient conductive hearing loss 
• 
in children is otitis media with effusion. Otitis media is infl am-
mation of the middle ear. It is caused primarily by Eustachian 
tube dysfunction.
Otosclerosis is a disorder of bone growth that affects the stapes 
• 
and the bony labyrinth of the cochlea.
A cholesteatoma is a growth in the middle ear that forms as a 
• 
consequence of epidermal invasion through a perforation or a 
retraction of the tympanic membrane.
Hereditary factors are common causes of sensorineural hear-
• 
ing loss.
Acoustic trauma is the most common cause of sensorineural 
• 
hearing loss other than presbyacusis.
Congenital infections most commonly associated with sen-
• 
sorineural hearing loss include: cytomegalovirus (CMV), hu-
man immunodeficiency virus (HIV), rubella, syphilis, and 
toxoplasmosis.
Acquired bacterial infections can cause inflammation of the 
• 
membranous labyrinth of the cochlea, or labyrinthitis.
Some of the more common acquired viral infections that can 
• 
cause sensorineural hearing loss include herpes zoster oticus 
and mumps.
Certain drugs and chemicals are toxic to the cochlea. Ototoxicity 
• 
can be acquired or congenital.
A common disorder of the cochlea is endolymphatic hydrops, a 
• 
condition resulting from excessive accumulation of endolymph 
in the cochlear and vestibular labyrinths, which often causes 

188  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
Ménière’s disease, a constellation of  symptoms of  episodic 
 vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness.
Presbyacusis is a decline in hearing as a part of  the aging 
• 
 process. As a collective cause, it is the leading contributor to 
hearing loss in adults.
Other causes of sensorineural hearing loss include autoimmune 
• 
hearing loss, cochlear otosclerosis, and sudden hearing loss.
Neoplastic growths on the VIIIth nerve or in the auditory 
• 
brainstem, cranial nerve neuritis, multiple sclerosis, and brain 
infarcts can all result in some form of auditory disorder.
The most common neoplastic growth affecting the auditory 
• 
nerve is called a cochleovestibular schwannoma.
Some hearing disorders are accompanied by vestibular disorders. 
• 
Many of the congenital inner-ear anomalies affect the membra-
nous and bony labyrinths of both the auditory and vestibular 
systems, and some acquired etiologies, such as meningitis or 
syphilis, can affect both auditory and vestibular systems simul-
taneously. In other cases, vestibular disorders can occur in isola-
tion. The primary disorders causing vertigo without hearing loss 
include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), semicircu-
lar canal dehiscence, vestibulotoxicity, and vestibular neuritis.
Short Answer Questions
 1. Hereditary disorders are a signifi cant cause of sensorineural 
hearing loss. A 
 disorder occurs when only one 
gene of a pair is needed to carry a genetic characteristic or 
mutation. A 
 disorder occurs when both genes of 
a pair are needed to carry a genetic characteristic or mutation.
 2. Drugs or other nongenetic factors that cause abnormal 
 embryological development are known as 
.
 3. Numerous types of physical trauma can cause hearing loss. 
Another type of trauma is 
, which is a result of 
excessive noise exposure.
 4. A hearing disorder that interferes with the synchronous 
transmission of signals from cochlear hair cells to the VIIIth 
cranial nerve is known as 
.

CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER  189
 5. A hearing loss is termed 
 when its cause is 
unknown.
 6. The absence of an ear canal, called 
, and the 
abnormal smallness of the auricle, known as 
, 
are two examples of congenital outer ear anomalies.
 7. Middle-ear congenital anomalies typically cause a 
 hearing loss. An example is congenital 
 fixation, wherein the stapes footplate is 
 attached to the oval window.
 8. When an accumulation of ear wax, also called 
 
completely occludes the ear canal, it is called an 
. This type of block most typically causes a 
  conductive hearing loss, although high fre-
quencies may be involved if cerumen adheres to the tym-
panic membrane.
 9. A tympanic membrane 
 occurs when damage 
creates a hole in the eardrum. This is typically found when 
foreign objects are placed in the ear canal, when a blow to 
the head occurs, or as a complication of 
 in the 
middle ear.
 10. The term 
 
 refers to infl ammation 
of the middle-ear space. It is often used in conjunction with 
the term 
, which describes the escape of fl uid 
into tissue or a cavity. 
 11. Otitis media with effusion is typically the result of dysfunction 
of the 
. Failure of this structure to open appro-
priately results in 
 middle-ear pressure, which 
ultimately causes the buildup of fl uid in the middle-ear space.
 12. A consequence of otitis media, known as a 
, 
 occurs when a weakened portion of the tympanic membrane 
is drawn into the middle-ear space, causing a pocket to form. 
The 
 lining of this pocket grows into the middle-
ear space and can erode the ossicles and invade the bony 
labyrinth.
 13. Sensory hearing disorders can be 
, meaning 
that they are present at birth; 
, being present 
at birth or occurring later in life; or 
, occurring 
only later in life after birth.

190  CHAPTER 4  CAUSES OF HEARING DISORDER
 14. Causes of sensory disorders may be 
, meaning 
that the disorder is a characteristic of the inherited traits of 
the individual, or may be 
, resulting from con-
ditions not necessarily intrinsic to the genetic makeup of the 
individual.
 15. A malformation of the 
 bone, known as en-
larged 
 
 syndrome, is associated 
with early onset of progressive, profound, bilateral hearing 
loss and vestibular disorders. 
 16. In cases of 
 hereditary hearing disorders, there 
is no other feature besides hearing loss. Some hereditary 
hearing losses may be present at birth, while others are 
, occurring gradually over time, and still others 
have onset in adulthood.
 17. A very common cause of acquired hearing loss is 
-
 hearing loss that occurs as 
a result of traumatic exposure to sound. Such a hearing 
loss can be temporary in nature, and is demonstrated by 
a 
 
 
 (TTS), or per-
manent in nature, being demonstrated by a 
 
 
 (PTS).
 18. Medications that are toxic to the cochlea are called 
. 
 19. The decline in hearing function that occurs as a conse-
quence of aging is known as 
.
 20. Brainstem infarcts, gliomas, and 
 
, 
a demyelinating disease, are examples of brainstem disorders 
that cause neural hearing losses.
 21. Vestibular disorders may or may not occur in conjunction 
with hearing disorders. A hallmark of vestibular disorders 
is the presence of 
, an abnormal sensation of 
motion. 
 22. The most common cause of vestibular vertigo is 
 
 
 
 
(BPPV). The typical cause is 
, when free fl oat-
ing otoconia migrate to the superior semicircular canal 
and stimulate the vestibular system with changes in head 
position.

Discussion Questions
 1. Discuss why it may be important to identify and understand 
the underlying cause of a hearing loss.
 2. Explain Eustachian tube dysfunction and how it contributes 
to the occurrence of otitis media with effusion. Why is this 
condition so much more prevalent in children?
 3. Compare and contrast syndromic and nonsyndromic 
 inherited disorders.
 4. Explain why the effects of presbyacusis on hearing are 
 diffi cult to determine exactly.
 5. Explain the concepts of time-intensity tradeoff and damage-
risk criteria and how they relate to noise-induced hearing loss.
 6. Discuss how the effects of certain causes of hearing loss are 
compounded by exposure to ototoxic medications.
 7. The underlying cause of “dizziness” is often diffi cult to 
 determine in patients. Speculate as to why this might be true.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  197
THE main purpose of a hearing evaluation is to defi ne the nature 
and extent of hearing disorder. The hearing evaluation serves as a 
fi rst step in the treatment of hearing loss. Toward this end, there 
are some common questions to be answered as a part of any au-
diologic evaluation. They include:
Why is the patient being evaluated?
• 
Should the patient be referred for medical consultation?
• 
What is the patient’s hearing sensitivity?
• 
How well does the patient understand speech?
• 
How well does the patient process auditory information?
• 
Does the hearing loss cause a communication problem?
• 
Patients have their hearing evaluated for a number of reasons. The 
focus of a particular hearing evaluation, as well as the types and 
nature of tests that are used, will vary as a function of the reason. 
For example, many patients seek the professional expertise of an 
audiologist because they feel that they have hearing loss and may 
need hearing devices. In such cases, the audiologist seeks to defi ne 
the nature and extent of the disorder, in a thorough manner, with 
an emphasis on factors that may indicate or contraindicate suc-
cessful hearing-device use.
As another example, patients may be referred because they are 
seeking compensation for hearing loss that is allegedly caused

198  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
by exposure to noise in the workplace, by an accident, or by 
other means that may be compensible. In these cases, the audi-
ologist must focus on hearing sensitivity, with suspicion aroused 
for exaggeration of  the hearing impairment. The audiologist 
must use acceptable cross-checks to verify the extent of identi-
fi ed hearing impairment.
Audiologists are often called upon to evaluate the hearing of 
young children. In many cases, children are evaluated at an age 
when they are not able to cooperate with behavioral hearing as-
sessment. In these cases, the audiologist must use behavioral, 
electroacoustic, and electrophysiologic measures as cross-
checks in identifi cation of hearing sensitivity levels.
Other children are evaluated not because of  suspicion of  a 
hearing sensitivity loss, but because of  concerns about prob-
lems in the processing of  auditory information. Here the em-
phasis is not on quantification of  hearing sensitivity but on 
careful quantification of speech perception. Because time is of-
ten limited with younger children, the approach that is used by 
the audiologist is critical in terms of  focusing on the nature of 
the concern.
Patients are often evaluated in consultation with otolaryngolo-
gists to determine the nature and extent of  hearing loss that 
results from active disease processes. In such cases, the otolar-
yngologist is likely to treat the disease process with drugs or 
surgery and is interested in evaluating hearing before and  after 
treatment. Careful quantification of  middle-ear function and 
hearing sensitivity are often important features of the pre- and 
post-treatment assessment.
Some patients are evaluated simply to assure that they have nor-
mal hearing sensitivity. Newborns, children entering school, 
adults in noisy work environments, and a number of other indi-
viduals have their hearing sensitivity screened in an effort to rule 
out hearing disorder. The focus of the screening is on the rapid 
identification of  those with normal hearing sensitivity, rather 
than the quantifi cation of hearing loss.
Behavioral measures = 
pure-tone audiometry, speech 
audiometry.
Electroacoustic 
measures = immittance 
audiometry and otoacoustic 
emissions.
Electrophysiologic 
measures = auditory 
brainstem response.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  199
Thus, although the fundamental goal of  an audiologic assess-
ment is similar for most patients, the specifi c focus of the eval-
uation can vary considerably, depending on the nature of  the 
patient and problem. As a result, a very important aspect of 
the audiologic evaluation is the fi rst question, Why is the patient 
 being evaluated?
THE FIRST QUESTION
Why is the patient being evaluated? It sounds like such a simple ques-
tion. Yet the answer is a very important step in the assessment 
process because it guides the audiologist to an appropriate evalu-
ative strategy. There are usually two main sources of information 
for answering this question. One source is the nature of the refer-
ral. This alone often provides suffi cient information to understand 
what the expected outcome of the evaluation will be. The other is 
the case history.
Referral-Source Perspective
There are many reasons for evaluating hearing and several cat-
egories of referral sources from which patients come to be eval-
uated by audiologists. Referral sources include the patient, the 
patient’s parents, the patient’s children, the patient’s spouse, 
otolaryngologists, pediatricians, gerontologists, oncologists, neu-
rologists, speech-language pathologists, other patients, attorneys, 
teachers, and nurses. The nature of the referral source is often a 
good indicator of why the patient is being evaluated.
Self-referrals or referrals from family members usually indicate 
that the patient has a significant communication disorder 
resulting from hearing loss. If  it is a self-referral, the patient 
probably has been concerned about a problem with hearing 
for some time and has conceded to the possibility of  hearing-
device use. If  it is a family referral, it is likely that the family 
members have noticed a decline in communication function and 
have urged the patient to seek professional consultation. In all 
cases of  direct referrals, the audiologic evaluation proceeds by 
fi rst addressing the issue of whether the disorder is of a nature

aid or assistive listening 
device.

200  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
that can be treated medically. Once established, the evaluation 
proceeds with a focus on hearing assessment for the potential 
fi tting of hearing devices.
Referrals from physicians and other health-care professionals do 
not always have as clear a purpose. That may seem unusual, but 
few days pass by in a busy clinic without some patients expressing 
that they have no idea why their doctors wanted them to have a 
hearing evaluation. In these cases, the specialty of the physician 
making the referral is usually helpful in determining why the pa-
tient was referred. For example, an adult referred by a neurologist 
is likely to be under suspicion of having some type of brain dis-
order. The neurologist is seeking to determine whether a hearing 
sensitivity loss exists, either for purposes of additional testing by 
auditory evoked potentials or to address whether the central au-
ditory nervous system is involved in the dysfunction. As another 
example, a child referred by a speech-language pathologist has 
probably been referred either to rule out the presence of a hear-
ing sensitivity loss as a contributing factor to a speech and lan-
guage disorder or to assess auditory processing status. As a fi nal 
example, when an otolaryngologist refers a patient for a hearing 
consultation, it will be for one of several reasons including:
the patient has a hearing disorder and entered the health-
• 
care system through the otolaryngologist;
the patient is dizzy or has 
• 
tinnitus, and the physician is 
concerned about the possibility of a tumor on the VIIIth 
cranial nerve;
the patient has ear disease, and the physician is interested in 
• 
pretreatment assessment of hearing;
the patient is seeking compensation for a trauma-related 
• 
 incident that has allegedly resulted in a hearing problem, 
and the physician is interested in the nature and degree of 
that problem; or
the physician has determined that the patient has a hearing 
• 
problem that cannot be corrected medically or surgically and 
has sent the patient to the audiologist for evaluation and fi tting 
of hearing aid amplifi cation or other treatment as necessary.
An auditory evoked 
potential is a measurable 
response of the electrical 
activity of the brain in 
response to acoustic 
stimulation.
The sensation of ringing 
or other sound heard in 
the ears or head is called 
tinnitus.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  201
It is important to understand why the patient is being evaluated 
because it dictates the emphasis of the evaluative process. Oc-
casionally, the interest of the referral source in the outcome of a 
hearing consultation is not altogether clear, and the audiologist 
must seek that information directly from the referral source prior 
to starting an evaluation.
Importance of the Case History
An important starting point of any audiologic evaluation is the 
case history. Sample adult and child case histories are shown on 
the pages that follow. An effective case history guides the expe-
rienced audiologist in a number of ways. It provides necessary 
information about the nature of auditory complaints, including 
whether it is in one ear or both; whether it is acute or chronic; 
and the duration of  the problem. All of  this information is im-
portant because it helps the audiologist to formulate clinical 
testing strategies.
Case histories are also important because they shed light on pos-
sible factors contributing to the hearing disorder. In adult case 
histories, questions are asked about exposure to excessive noise, 
family history of hearing loss, or the use of certain types of med-
ication. This information serves at least three purposes. First, it 
begins to prepare the audiologist for what is likely to be found 
during the audiologic evaluation. As you learned in the last 
chapter, certain types of hearing loss confi gurations are typical 
of certain causative factors, and knowledge of the potential con-
tribution of these factors is useful in preparing the clinician for 
testing. Second, knowledge about preventable factors in hearing 
loss, particularly noise exposure, will lead to appropriate recom-
mendations about ear protection and other preventive measures. 
Third, some hearing loss is temporary in nature. Reversible hear-
ing loss may result from recent noise exposure. It may also result 
from ingestion of  high doses of  certain drugs, such as aspirin. 
It is important to know whether the hearing impairment being 
quantifi ed is temporary in nature or is the residual defi cit that 
remains after reversible changes.

202  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
The Case History
Following are examples of case histories, one for adults and 
one for children. The adult form is for use by the patient; the 
pediatric form is for use by the parent. Regardless of which 
form is used, there are some commonalities of purpose:
to secure proper identifying information;
• 
to provide information about the nature of auditory 
• 
complaints; and
to shed light on possible factors contributing to the 
• 
hearing impairment.
Adult case histories also include information about:
warning signs that may lead to medical referral;
• 
whether and under what circumstances a hearing 
• 
 disorder is restrictive; and
whether consideration has been given to potential use 
• 
of hearing aid amplifi cation.
Case histories for children also include information about:
speech and language development;
• 
general physical and psychosocial development; and
• 
academic achievement.
• 
In addition, if the child has a history of otitis media, an in-
depth case history into the nature of the disorder may be of 
interest to both the audiologist and the managing physician.
There are almost as many examples of case histories as there 
are clinics using them. Some important factors that you 
should keep in mind when considering a case history form:
keep it at a simple reading level;
• 
keep it as concise as possible; and
• 
translate it into other languages common to your region.
• 
The case history form should be designed not as an end in 
itself but as a form that will lead you into a discussion of the 
reasons that the patient is in your offi ce and the nature of 
the auditory complaint.

206  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
Also included on adult case histories are questions relating to gen-
eral health and to specifi c problems that can accompany hearing 
disorder. These questions are important because the audiologist is 
often the entry point into health care and must be knowledgeable 
about warning signs that dictate appropriate medical referral. 
This cannot be understated. As a nonmedical entry point into the 
health-care system, audiologists must maintain a constant vigil 
for warning signs of medical problems. Thus, questions are asked 
about dizziness, numbness, weakness, tinnitus, and other signs 
that might indicate the potential for otologic, neurologic, or other 
medical problems.
Another very important aspect of the case history involves ques-
tions about communication ability. The goal here is to obtain in-
formation about whether the patient perceives that the hearing 
problem is resulting in a communication disorder and whether 
the patient has or would consider use of personal amplifi cation. 
The questions about communication disorder begin to give the 
audiologist an impression of the extent to which a hearing prob-
lem is restrictive in some way and the circumstances under which 
the patient is experiencing the greatest diffi culty. The questions 
about hearing devices are intended to “break the ice” on the issue 
and promote discussion of potential options for the fi rst step in the 
treatment process.
Case histories for children are oriented in a slightly different way. 
Questions are asked of  the parents about the nature and any 
problems associated with pregnancy and delivery. Case histories 
for children also include a checklist of known childhood diseases 
or conditions. These questions about health of the mother and 
the developing child are aimed at obtaining an understanding of 
factors that might impact hearing ability. They also provide the 
clinician with a better understanding of any factors that might 
infl uence testing strategies.
Case histories for children must also include inquiries about 
overall development and, specifically, about speech and lan-
guage development. Children with hearing disorders of  any 
degree should be considered at risk for speech and language de-
lays or disorders. Screening for speech and language problems 
during an audiologic evaluation is an important role of  the 

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  207
audiologist, and that screening should begin with the case his-
tory. Questions relating to parental concerns and developmen-
tal milestones can serve as important aspects of  the screening 
process. In addition, such information can provide the clinician 
with valuable insight about which test materials might be ap-
propriate linguistically.
Another important aspect of a case history for children relates to 
academic achievement. Answers to questions about school place-
ment and progress will help the audiologist to orient the evalua-
tion and consequent recommendations toward academic needs.
One main benefi t of the case history process is that the interac-
tion with patients can reveal substantial information about their 
general health and communication abilities. For example, experi-
enced clinicians will observe the extent to which patients rely on 
lipreading and will notice any speech and language abnormali-
ties. They will also attend carefully to patients’ physical appear-
ance and motoric abilities.
Once the reason for referral is known and the case history is re-
viewed with the patient, the evaluative challenge begins. Prepared 
with a knowledge of why the patient is being evaluated and what 
information the patient hopes to gain, the audiologist can orient 
the evaluative strategy appropriately.
THE AUDIOLOGIST’S CHALLENGES
Regardless of the techniques that are used, the audiologist faces a 
number of clinical challenges during any audiologic evaluation. 
One of the fi rst challenges is to determine whether the problem 
is strictly a communication disorder or whether there is an un-
derlying active and/or treatable disease process that requires the 
patient to be referred for medical consultation. Treatable disor-
ders of the outer and middle ears are common causes of audi-
tory complaints. Thus, the fi rst question in the evaluative process 
is whether these structures are functioning properly. Following 
that question, the evaluative strategy includes the determination 
of hearing sensitivity and type of hearing loss, measurement of 
speech perception, assessment of auditory processing ability, and 
estimate of hearing handicap.
Motoric abilities are 
muscle movement abilities.

208  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
Evaluating Outer- and Middle-Ear Function
As you have learned, structural changes in the outer and middle 
ears can cause functional changes and result in hearing impair-
ment. Problems associated with the outer ear are usually related 
to obstruction or stenosis (narrowing) of the ear canal. The most 
common problem is an excessive accumulation or impaction of 
cerumen. When changes such as this occur, sound can be blocked 
from striking the tympanic membrane, and a loss in the conduc-
tion of sound will occur. The function of the tympanic membrane 
can also be reduced by either perforation or sclerotic tissue add-
ing mass to the membrane. These changes result in a reduction in 
appropriate tympanic membrane vibration and a consequent loss 
in conduction of sound to the ossicular chain.
The first step in the process of assessing outer- and middle-ear 
 function is inspection of the ear canal. This is achieved with oto-
scopy. Otoscopy is simply the examination of the external auditory 
meatus and the tympanic membrane with an otoscope. An oto-
scope is a device with a light source that permits visualization of 
the canal and eardrum. Otoscopes range in sophistication from a 
handheld speculum like instrument with a light source, as shown 
in Figure 5-1, to a video otoscope, as shown in Figure 5-2. The ear 
canal is inspected for any obvious infl ammation, growths, foreign 
objects, or excessive cerumen. If  possible, the tympanic mem-
brane is visualized and inspected for infl ammation, perforation, or 
any other obvious abnormalities in structure. If an abnormality is 
noted during inspection, the patient should be referred for medi-
cal assessment following the audiologic evaluation.
If excessive or impacted cerumen is noted, the audiologist may 
choose to remove it or refer the patient to appropriate medical per-
sonnel for cerumen management. Cerumen management involves 
removal of the excessive or impacted wax in one of three ways:
mechanical removal,
• 
suction, or
• 
irrigation.
• 
Mechanical removal is the most common method and involves 
the use of small curettes or spoons to extract the cerumen. This 
is usually done using a speculum to open and straighten the ear

canal. Suction is sometimes used, especially when the cerumen is 
very soft. Irrigation is commonly used when the cerumen is im-
pacted and is hard and dry. Irrigation involves directing a stream 
of water from an oral jet irrigator against the wall of the ear canal 
until the cerumen is loosened and extracted.
Following otoscopic inspection of the structures of the outer ear, 
the next step in the evaluation process is to assess the function of 
the outer- and middle-ear mechanisms. Problems in function of

210  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
the middle ear can be classifi ed into four general categories. Func-
tional defi cits can result from:
signifi cant negative pressure in the middle-ear cavity,
• 
an increase in the mass of the middle-ear system,
• 
an increase in the stiffness of the middle-ear system, and
• 
a reduction in the stiffness of the middle-ear system.
• 
Negative pressure in the middle-ear space occurs when the Eusta-
chian tube is not functioning appropriately, usually due to some 
form of upper respiratory blockage. Pressure cannot be equalized, 
and the trapped air is absorbed by the mucosal lining of the mid-
dle ear. This results in a reduction in air pressure in comparison to 
atmospheric pressure and can reduce the transmission of sound 
through the middle ear.

Allyn, Inc.)

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  211
Increase in the mass of the middle-ear system usually occurs as 
a result of a fl uid accumulation behind the tympanic membrane. 
Following prolonged negative pressure, the mucosal lining of the 
middle ear begins to excrete fl uid that can block the effects of the 
tympanic membrane and ossicular chain. Mass increases also can 
occur as a result of cholesteatoma and other growths within the 
middle ear, which can have an infl uence similar to the presence of 
fl uid. Any increase in the mass of the system can affect transmis-
sion of sound, particularly in the higher frequencies.
Increase in the stiffness of the middle-ear system results from some 
type of fi xation of the ossicular chain. Usually this fi xation is the 
result of a sclerosis of the bones that results in a fusion of the 
stapes at the oval window. Increases in stiffness of the ossicular 
chain can also affect transmission of sound, particularly in the 
lower frequencies.
Decrease in the stiffness can have a similar affect. Abnormal reduc-
tion usually results from a break or disarticulation of the ossicular 
chain, which signifi cantly reduces sound transmission.
It is important to evaluate outer- and middle-ear function for at 
least two reasons. First, a reduction in function usually occurs as 
a result of structural changes that are amenable to medical man-
agement. That is, the causes of structural and functional changes 
in the outer and middle ear usually can be treated with drugs or 
surgical intervention. Second, the changes in function of the outer- 
and middle-ear structures often lead to conductive hearing impair-
ment. Because the ultimate goal of any hearing assessment is the 
amelioration of hearing loss, an important early question in the 
evaluation process is to what extent any disorder is the product of a 
disease process that can be effectively treated medically. Thus, one 
of the audiologist’s fi rst challenges is to assess outer- and middle-
ear function. If conductive function is normal, then any hearing 
disorder is due to changes in the sensory mechanism. If this func-
tion is abnormal, then it remains to quantify the extent to which 
changes in its function contribute to the overall hearing disorder.
The best means for assessing outer- and middle-ear function is the 
use of immittance audiometry. Immittance audiometry, as you will 
learn, is an electroacoustic assessment technique that measures the 
Sclerosis is the hardening 
of tissue.
Immittance audiometry 
is a battery of measurements 
that assesses the ﬂ ow 
of energy through the 
middle ear, including static 
immittance, typanometry, and 
acoustic reﬂ ex thresholds.

212  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
extent to which energy fl ows freely through the outer- and middle-
ear mechanisms. Its use in the evaluation of middle-ear function 
developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s. It has gained 
widespread application both for screening middle-ear function and 
for more in-depth assessment. In fact, many clinicians embrace im-
mittance audiometry to the extent that they begin every audiologic 
assessment with it. They believe that the assessment of outer- and 
middle-ear function is among the most important fi rst steps in the 
hearing evaluation process.
Estimating Hearing Sensitivity
One of  the best ways to describe hearing ability is by its sen-
sitivity to sound. Similarly, one of  the best ways to describe 
hearing disorder is by measuring a reduction in sensitivity to 
sound. Hearing sensitivity is usually defi ned by an individual’s 
threshold of  audibility of  sound. Measurements are made to 
determine at what intensity level a tone or a word is just barely 
audible. That level is considered the threshold of  audibility of 
the signal and is an accepted way of  describing the sensitivity 
of hearing.
Substantial progress has been made in understanding hearing 
and in measuring hearing ability over the past half century. Yet 
to this day, the best single indicator of hearing loss, its impact on 
communication, and the prognosis for successful hearing-device 
use is the pure-tone audiogram. The audiogram is a graph, which 
depicts thresholds of hearing sensitivity, determined behaviorally, 
as a function of pure-tone frequency. It has become the corner-
stone of audiologic assessment and, as a consequence perhaps, 
the generic indicator of what is perceived to be an individual’s 
hearing ability. Because the audiogram is such a pervasive means 
for describing hearing sensitivity, it has become the icon for hear-
ing sensitivity itself. It has provided a common language with 
which to describe an individual’s hearing. As a result, when we 
characterize the hearing ability of an individual, we are likely to 
think in terms of the pure-tone audiogram.
The audiologist’s role in assessment of hearing sensitivity is most 
 often determination of the pure-tone audiogram. In some instances, 
Threshold is the level at 
which a stimulus is just 
audible.
Prognosis is the prediction 
of the course or outcome of 
a disease or treatment.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  213
however, particularly in infants and young children or in individu-
als who are feigning hearing loss, a reliable pure-tone audiogram 
cannot be obtained. In these cases, other techniques for estimating 
hearing sensitivity must be used. Regardless, even in these cases, 
the challenge remains to try to “predict the audiogram.”
The measurement of  hearing sensitivity provides a means for 
describing degree and configuration of hearing loss. If normal 
listeners have hearing thresholds at one level and the patient be-
ing tested has thresholds at a higher level, then the difference is 
considered the amount of hearing loss compared to normal. By 
its nature then, a pure-tone audiogram provides a depiction of the 
amount of hearing loss.
Measurements of sensitivity provide a substantial amount of in-
formation about hearing ability. Estimates are made of degree of 
hearing loss, providing a general statement about the severity of 
sensitivity impairment. Estimates are also made of degree of loss 
as a function of frequency, or confi guration of hearing loss. The 
confi guration of a hearing loss is a critical factor in speech under-
standing and in fi tting personal amplifi cation.
There are several ways to measure hearing sensitivity. Typically, 
sensitivity assessment begins with the behavioral determination 
of a threshold for speech recognition. This speech threshold pro-
vides a general estimate of sensitivity of hearing over the speech 
frequencies, generally described as the pure-tone average of 
thresholds at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz. Sensitivity assessment 
proceeds with behavioral pure-tone audiometry for determina-
tion of the audiogram. Pure-tone thresholds provide estimates of 
hearing sensitivity at specifi c frequencies.
In some cases, behavioral testing cannot be completed. In these 
instances, estimates can be made via auditory evoked potential 
measurements. Auditory evoked potentials are responses of the 
brain to sound. Electrical activity of the nervous system that is 
evoked by auditory stimuli can be measured at levels very close to 
behavioral thresholds. Thus, for infants or those who will not or 
cannot cooperate with behavioral testing, these electrophysiologic 
estimates of hearing sensitivity provide an acceptable alternative.
The speech frequencies 
are 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz.

214  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
Determining Type of Hearing Loss
Another challenge to the audiologist is the determination of the 
type of hearing loss. If a loss occurs as a result of changes in the 
outer or middle ear, it is considered a loss in the conduction of 
sound to the cochlea, or a conductive hearing loss. If a loss oc-
curs as a result of changes in the cochlea, it is considered a loss in 
function at the sensory-neural junction, or a sensorineural hear-
ing loss. If a loss occurs as a result of changes in both the outer 
or middle ear and the cochlea, it will have both a conductive and 
a sensory component and be considered a mixed hearing loss. 
 Finally, if a loss occurs as a result of changes to the VIIIth nerve or 
auditory brainstem, it is considered a retrocochlear disorder.
Determination of the type of hearing loss is an important contri-
bution of the audiologic assessment. A crucial determination is 
whether a conductive hearing loss is present. Although the func-
tion of outer- and middle-ear structures is readily determined by 
immittance audiometry, the extent that a disorder in function re-
sults in a measurable hearing loss is not. Therefore, one important 
aspect of the audiologic assessment is measurement of the degree 
of conductive and sensorineural components of the hearing loss. 
As stated earlier, knowledge of this is valuable because conduc-
tive loss is caused by disorders of the outer or middle ear, most of 
which are treatable medically. Knowledge of the extent to which 
a loss is conductive will provide an estimate of the residual sen-
sorineural defi cit following medical management. For example, if 
the loss is entirely conductive in nature, then treatment is likely 
to return hearing sensitivity to normal. If the loss is partially con-
ductive and partially sensorineural, then a residual sensorineural 
defi cit will remain following treatment. If the loss is entirely sen-
sorineural, then medical treatment is unlikely to be of value.
As you learned in Chapter 3, to evaluate the type of hearing loss, 
hearing sensitivity is measured by presenting sounds in two ways. 
The most common way is to present sound through an earphone 
to assess hearing sensitivity of the entire auditory mechanism. 
This is referred to as air-conduction testing. The other way to 
present sound to the ear is by placing a vibrator in contact with 
the skin, usually behind the ear or on the forehead. Sound is then 
directed to the vibrator, which transmits signals directly to the 
A conductive hearing 
loss is one that occurs as a 
result of outer- or middle-ear 
disorder.
A sensorineural hearing 
loss is one that occurs as a 
result of cochlear disorder.
A mixed hearing loss 
is one that has both a 
conductive and sensorineural 
component.
A retrocochlear disorder 
is one that occurs as a result 
of VIIIth nerve or auditory 
brainstem disorder.
The transmission of sound 
through the outer and 
middle ear to the cochlea 
is by air conduction.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  215
 cochlea via bone conduction. Direct bone-conduction stimula-
tion virtually bypasses the outer and middle ears to assess sensi-
tivity of the auditory mechanism from the cochlea and beyond. 
The difference between hearing sensitivity as determined by air 
conduction and the sensitivity as determined by bone conduction 
represents the contribution of the function of the outer and mid-
dle ear. If sound is being conducted properly by these structures, 
then hearing sensitivity by air conduction is the same as hear-
ing sensitivity by bone conduction. If a hearing loss is present, 
that loss is attributable to changes in the sensory mechanism of 
the cochlea or neural mechanism of the auditory nervous sys-
tem and is referred to as a sensorineural hearing loss. If sound is 
not being conducted properly by the outer and middle ear, then 
air-conduction thresholds will be poorer than bone-conduction 
thresholds (i.e., an air-bone gap will be present), refl ecting a loss 
in conduction of sound through the outer and middle ears, or a 
conductive hearing loss.
One other question about type of hearing loss relates to whether 
the site of disorder is in the cochlear or retrocochlear structures. 
Retrocochlear disorders result from tumors or other changes in 
the auditory peripheral and central nervous systems. The under-
lying disease processes that result in nervous system disorders 
are often life-threatening. For example, as you learned in Chap-
ter 4, one of the more common retrocochlear disorders results 
from a tumor growing on the VIIIth cranial nerve, referred to as 
a  cochleovestibular schwannoma. A cochleovestibular schwan-
noma is a benign growth that often emerges from the vestibular 
branch of  the VIIIth nerve. As it grows, it begins to challenge 
the nerve for space within the internal auditory canal, resulting 
in pressure on the nerve that can affect its function. As it grows 
into the brainstem, it begins to compete for space, which results in 
pressure on other cranial nerves and brainstem structures. If an 
acoustic tumor is detected early, the prognosis for successful sur-
gical removal and preservation of hearing function is good. Delay 
in detection can result in substantial permanent neurologic disor-
der and reduces the prognosis for preservation of hearing.
Neurologic disorders of the peripheral and central auditory ner-
vous system may result in hearing loss or other auditory complaints 
such as tinnitus or dizziness. It is not uncommon for a patient with

nerve.

216  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
an acoustic tumor to report a loss of hearing sensitivity, muffl ed 
sound, vertigo, or tinnitus as a fi rst symptom of the effects of the 
tumor. That patient may seek assistance from a physician or from 
an audiologist. Thus, the audiologist’s responsibility in all cases of 
patients with auditory complaints is to be alert for factors that may 
indicate the presence of a retrocochlear disorder. If the audiologic 
evaluation reveals results that are consistent with retrocochlear 
site of disorder, the audiologist must make the appropriate referral 
for medical consultation.
On most of the measures used throughout the audiologic evalu-
ation, there are indicators that can alert the audiologist to the 
possibility of retrocochlear disorder. Acoustic refl ex thresholds, 
symmetry of hearing sensitivity, confi guration of hearing sen-
sitivity, and measures of speech recognition all provide clues as 
to the nature of the disorder. Any results that arouse suspicion 
about the integrity of  the nervous system should serve as an 
 immediate indicator of the need for medical referral.
Prior to the advent of  sophisticated imaging and radiographic 
techniques, specialized audiologic assessment was an integral part 
of the differential diagnosis of auditory nervous system disorders. 
Behavioral measures of differential sensitivity to loudness, loud-
ness growth, and auditory adaptation were designed to assist in 
the diagnostic process. As imaging and radiographic techniques 
improved, the ability to visualize ever-smaller lesions of the audi-
tory nervous system was enhanced. These smaller lesions were 
less likely to have an impact on auditory function. As a result, the 
sensitivity of the behavioral audiologic techniques diminished.
For a number of years in the late 1970s and early 1980s, audi-
tory evoked potentials were used as a very sensitive technique for 
assisting in the diagnosis of neurologic disorders. For a time, these 
measures of neurologic function were thought to be even more 
sensitive than radiographic techniques in the detection of lesions. 
However, the advent of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tech-
niques, permitting the visualization of even smaller lesions, re-
duced the sensitivity of these functional measures once again.
Today, auditory evoked potentials, particularly the auditory brain-
stem response, remains a valuable indicator of VIIIth nerve and 

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  217
auditory brainstem function. Audiologists are often consulted to 
carry out evoked-potential testing as a fi rst screen in the process 
of neurologic diagnosis. Many neurologists and otologists con-
tinue to seek an assessment of neural function by evoked poten-
tials to supplement the assessment of structure provided by the 
MRI procedures.
Measuring Speech Recognition
Once a patient’s hearing thresholds have been estimated, it is 
 important to determine suprathreshold function, or function of 
the auditory system at intensity levels above threshold. Threshold 
assessment provides only an indicator of the sensitivity of hear-
ing, or the ability to hear faint sounds. Suprathreshold measures 
provide an indicator of how the auditory system deals with sound 
at higher intensity levels.
The most common suprathreshold measure in an audiologic eval-
uation is that of speech recognition. Measures of speech recogni-
tion provide an estimate of how well an individual uses residual 
hearing to understand speech signals. That is, if speech is of suf-
fi cient intensity, can it be recognized appropriately?
Measurement of speech recognition is important for at least two 
reasons. The most important reason is that it provides an esti-
mate of  how well a person will hear speech at suprathreshold 
levels, thereby providing one of the fi rst estimates of how much 
a person with a hearing loss might benefit from a hearing de-
vice. In general, if  an individual has a hearing sensitivity loss 
and good speech-recognition ability at suprathreshold levels, the 
prognosis for successful hearing-aid use is good. If  an individ-
ual has poor speech-recognition ability at suprathreshold levels, 
then making sound louder with a hearing device is unlikely to 
provide as much benefi t.
Measurement of speech recognition is also important as a screen 
for retrocochlear disorder. In most cases of  hearing loss of  co-
chlear origin, speech-recognition ability is predictable from the de-
gree and confi guration of the audiogram. That is, given a hearing 
sensitivity loss of a known degree and confi guration, the ability 
to recognize speech is roughly equivalent among individuals and 
Evoked potentials assess 
neural function.
An intensity level that is 
above threshold is termed 
suprathreshold.
The ability to perceive and 
identify speech is called 
speech recognition.
MRI assesses neural 
structure.

218  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
nearly equivalent between ears within an individual. Expectations 
of speech-recognition ability, then, lie within a certain predictable 
range for a given hearing loss of cochlear origin. In many cases 
of hearing loss of retrocochlear origin, however, speech-recognition 
ability is poorer than would be expected from the audiogram. 
Thus, if performance on speech-recognition measures falls below 
that which would be expected from a given degree and confi gura-
tion of hearing loss, suspicion must be aroused that the hearing 
loss is due to retrocochlear rather than cochlear disorder.
Speech-recognition ability is usually measured with monosyl-
labic word tests. Several tests have been developed over the years. 
Most use single-syllable words in lists of 25 or 50. Lists are usually 
developed to resemble, to some degree, the phonetic content of 
speech in a particular language. Word lists are presented to pa-
tients at suprathreshold levels, and the patients are instructed to 
repeat the words. Speech recognition is expressed as a percentage 
of correct identifi cation of words presented.
Measuring Auditory Processing
Another suprathreshold assessment is the evaluation of auditory 
processing ability. Auditory processing ability is usually defi ned as 
the process by which the central auditory nervous system trans-
fers information from the VIIIth nerve to the auditory cortex. The 
central auditory nervous system is a highly complex system that 
analyzes and processes neural information from both ears and 
transmits that processed information to other locations within the 
nervous system.
Much of our knowledge of the way in which the brain processes 
sound has been gained from studying systems that are abnormal 
due to neurologic disorders. The central auditory nervous system 
plays an important role in comparing sound at the two ears for 
the purpose of sound localization. The central auditory nervous 
system also plays a major role in extracting a signal of interest 
from a background of noise. While signals at the cochlea are an-
alyzed exquisitely in the frequency, amplitude, and temporal do-
mains, it is in the central auditory nervous system where those 
fundamental analyses are eventually perceived as speech or some 
other meaningful nonspeech sound.
Monosyllabic word tests 
are tests that consist of 
one-syllable words typically 
containing speech sounds 
that occur with similar 
frequency as those of 
conversational speech.
Phonetic pertains to an 
individual speech sound.
Auditory processing is 
how the auditory system 
utilizes acoustic information.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  219
If we understand the role of audiologic evaluation as the assess-
ment of hearing, then we can begin to understand the importance 
of evaluating more than just the sensitivity of the ears to faint 
sounds and the ability of the ear to recognize single-syllable words 
presented in quiet. Although both measures provide important in-
formation to the audiologic assessment, they stop short of offer-
ing a complete picture of an individual’s auditory ability. Certainly, 
as we think of the complexity of auditory perception, the ability 
to follow a conversation in a noisy room, the effortless ability to 
localize sound, or even the ability to recognize someone from the 
sound of footsteps, we begin to understand that the rudimentary 
assessments of hearing sensitivity and speech recognition do not 
adequately characterize what it takes to hear. Neither do they ad-
equately describe the possible disorders that a person might have.
Techniques that were once used to assist in the diagnosis of neu-
rologic disease are now used in the assessment of communication 
problems that occurs as a result of auditory processing disorder. 
Speech audiometric measures that are sensitized in certain ways 
are now commonly used to evaluate auditory processing ability. A 
typical battery of tests might include:
the assessment of speech recognition across a range of 
• 
 signal intensities;
the assessment of speech recognition in the presence of 
• 
competing signals; and
the measurement of 
• 
dichotic listening, which is the ability to 
process two different signals presented simultaneously to the 
two ears.
Results of such an assessment provide an estimate of auditory 
processing ability and a more complete profi le of a patient’s audi-
tory abilities and impairments. Such information is often useful in 
providing guidance regarding appropriate amplifi cation strategies 
or other rehabilitation approaches.
Measuring the Impact of Hearing Loss
Assessment of hearing sensitivity, measurement of speech under-
standing, and estimates of auditory processing abilities are all mea-
sures of a patient’s hearing ability or hearing disorder. The question 
Competing signal is 
background noise.
Listening to different 
signals presented to each 
ear simultaneously is called 
dichotic listening.

220  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
that remains to be asked is whether a hearing sensitivity loss, re-
duction in speech understanding, or auditory processing disorder 
is having an impact on communication ability. Asked another way, 
is a hearing disorder causing limitations on a patient’s activity or 
restrictions on that patient’s involvement in life activities?
The traditional approach to describing the impact of hearing loss 
is in terms of  impairment, disability, and handicap. A hearing 
  impairment is the actual dysfunction in hearing that is described 
by the various measures of hearing status. Hearing disability can 
be thought of as the functional limitations imposed by the hearing 
impairment. Hearing handicap can be thought of as the obstacles 
placed on psychosocial functions imposed by the disability.
A more modern approach to describing the impact that hearing 
loss is having on communication is in terms of how changes in 
structure and function (impairment) limit activities (disability) or 
restrict participation in activities (handicap). In these terms, re-
duced hearing function constitutes a disorder. The impact of that 
disorder can be described in three components. The disorder is 
caused by a problem in body structure and function, resulting in 
an impairment. The impairment may result in activity limitations, 
or diffi culties a person has in executing activities. The impairment 
may also result in participation restrictions, or problems a person 
has in involvement in life situations. Perhaps a simple example 
will help to clarify the terminology. If a person has a sensorineu-
ral hearing loss (impairment), it will cause diffi culty hearing soft 
sounds (activity limitation) and may cause a problem with the 
ability to interact with grandchildren (participation restriction).
Audiologists know that the mere presence of hearing loss does not 
necessarily result in activity limitations or participation restric-
tions. Although there is a relationship between degree of loss and 
activity limitation or participation restriction, it is not necessarily a 
close one in individual patients. For example, a mild hearing sensi-
tivity loss of gradual onset may not result in activity limitations for 
an 80-year-old with limited communication demands. The same 
mild sensitivity loss of sudden onset in a person whose livelihood 
is tied to verbal communication could impose substantial activity 
limitations and participation restrictions. Thus, the presence of 
Impairment refers to 
abnormal or reduced function.
Disability refers to a 
functional limitation 
imposed by an impairment.
Handicap refers to the 
obstacles to psychosocial 
function resulting from a 
disability.
Activity limitations are 
difﬁ culties an individual has 
in executing activities.
Participation restrictions 
are problems an individual 
experiences in involvement 
in life situations.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  221
a mild disorder can impose a signifi cant handicap to one person, 
whereas the presence of a substantial impairment may be only 
mildly restrictive to another.
Because of the disparity among impairment, activity limitation, and 
participation restriction, it is important to assess the extent of limita-
tion and restriction that results from impairment. Such an assess-
ment often leads to a clear set of goals for the treatment process. If 
the goal of audiologic assessment is to defi ne hearing disorder for the 
purpose of providing appropriate strategies for amelioration of the 
resultant communication limitations and restrictions, then there is 
no better way to complete the assessment process than with an eval-
uation of the nature and extent of the consequences of the disorder.
The most efficacious way of measuring activity limitations and 
participation restrictions is by self-assessment scales. Several scales 
have been developed that are designed to assess both the extent 
of hearing disability and the social and emotional consequences 
of hearing loss. That is, the scales were designed to determine the 
extent to which an auditory disorder is causing a hearing problem 
and the extent to which the hearing problem is affecting quality of 
life. Generally, these scales consist of a series of questions designed 
to provide a profi le of the nature and extent of activity limitation 
and participation restriction. The patient is typically asked to com-
plete the questionnaire prior to the audiologic evaluation. These 
scales have also been used following hearing aid fi tting in an effort 
to assess the impact of hearing aids on the limitation or restriction. 
Audiologists also use these scales with spouses or other signifi cant 
individuals in the patient’s life as a way of assessing the impact of 
the disorder on family and other social interactions. An example of 
a self-assessment scale is shown in Figure 5-3. Scales have also been 
developed to assess handicap related to tinnitus and dizziness.
Screening Hearing Function
One other challenge that an audiologist faces involves the screening 
of hearing function.  Hearing screening is designed to separate those 
with normal auditory function from those who need additional 
testing. The challenge of the audiologist in the screening process is 
usually different than the challenges faced in the conventional au-
diologic assessment. Typical screening measures are simplified to

an extent that the actual procedures can be carried out by techni-
cal personnel. The audiologist’s role includes education and training 
of technical staff,  continual monitoring of screening results, and 
follow-up audiologic evaluation of screen ing referrals.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  223
Screening programs are usually aimed at populations of  indi-
viduals who are at risk for having hearing disorder or individu-
als whose undetected hearing disorder could have a substantive 
negative effect on communication ability. There are three major 
groups that undergo hearing screening:
newborns,
• 
school-age children, and
• 
adults in occupations that expose them to potentially dan-
• 
gerous levels of noise.
Where I Live: The San Francisco Bay Area
Where I Work: The California Newborn Hearing 
Screening Program. The Newborn Hearing Screening Pro-
gram (NHSP) in California is under the Children’s Medical 
Services Branch of  the California Department of  Health 
Care Services.
What I Do: I am the program audiologist for the NHSP. My position is different from many 
audiologists in that I no longer have direct patient contact. While I enjoyed clinical practice, 
and pediatrics in particular, my current position has a greater impact on the early identifi ca-
tion of infants with hearing loss than I was making in my clinical role. As the program audi-
ologist, I create statewide policies for both the NHSP and ongoing audiologic care for children 
with hearing loss through the California Children’s Services (CCS) Program. I work one-on-
one with audiologists throughout the state to ensure that infants are receiving the current 
standard of care for audiology. I act as a liaison between hospital screening programs, audi-
ology providers, and the county CCS program staff. I represent the NHSP at local, state, and 
national meetings and conferences. The position has afforded me the opportunity to meet 
clinicians, researchers, and state-level audiologists from around the country that I wouldn’t 
have met otherwise. I could not have asked for a better opportunity.
Why Audiology? I wanted a career in which I felt like I was making a difference. I have 
found both my clinical and administrative experiences to be very rewarding. Audiology is one 
of the few professions in which you can actually see the positive impact that your interactions 
can have on an individual or family.

224  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
Newborn Hearing Screening
The goal of newborn hearing screening is to identify any child 
with a signifi cant sensorineural, permanent conductive, or neu-
ral hearing loss and to initiate treatment by 6 months of age. To 
achieve this goal, the hearing of newborns is screened before they 
leave the hospital.
Newborn hearing screening became fairly common in the 1970s 
and 1980s for infants who were determined to be at risk for poten-
tial hearing loss. Risk factors, or indicators, presented in Table 5-1, 
place an infant in a category that requires hearing screening and 
follow-up.
Although these early programs were effective in identifying at-risk 
infants with hearing disorder, it became apparent that as many as 
half of all infants with signifi cant sensorineural hearing loss do 
not have any of the risk-factor indicators. As of the early 1990s, 
the average age of identifi cation of children with signifi cant hear-
ing loss was estimated to be an alarming 2.5 years in many areas 
of the United States. Because of the failure of the system to iden-
tify half of the children with hearing loss and because of the ex-
tent of delay in identifying those children who were not detected 
early, comprehensive, or universal, newborn hearing screening 
programs were implemented. Today, early hearing detection and 
intervention (EHDI) systems exist throughout the United States. 
Newborn hearing screening is now common practice and is com-
pulsory in many states.
Newborn screening has as its goal the hearing screening of all chil-
dren, at birth, before discharge from the hospital. Infant hearing 
screening is usually carried out by technicians, volunteers, or nurs-
ing personnel, under the direction of hospital-based audiologists.
The screening of newborns requires the use of techniques that 
can be carried out without active participation of  the patient. 
Two techniques have proven to be most useful. The auditory 
brainstem response (ABR) is an electrophysiologic technique 
that is used successfully to screen the hearing of  infants. It in-
volves attaching electrodes to the infant’s scalp and recording 
An ABR or auditory 
brainstem response 
is an electrophysiological 
response to sound, 
consisting of ﬁ ve to seven 
identiﬁ able peaks that 
represent neural function of 
auditory pathways.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  225

226  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
Principles of Universal Newborn 
Hearing Screening
All infants have access to hearing screening using a 
• 
physiologic measure by 1 month of age. Newborns 
who receive routine care have access to hearing 
screening during their hospital birth admission. 
Newborns in alternative birthing facilities, includ-
ing home births, have access to and are referred 
for screening before 1 month of age. All newborns 
or infants who require neonatal intensive care 
 receive hearing screening before discharge from the 
hospital.
All infants who do not pass the birth admission screen 
• 
and any subsequent rescreening begin appropriate 
audiologic and medical evaluations to confi rm the 
presence of hearing loss before 3 months of age. 
All infants with confi rmed permanent hearing loss 
• 
 receive services before 6 months of age in interdisci-
plinary intervention programs.
EHDI systems should be family centered, and families 
• 
should have access to information about all forms of 
intervention and treatment.
The child should have immediate access to all forms of 
• 
hearing technology, including hearing aids, cochlear 
implants, and other assistive devices.
All infants and children, regardless of screening 
• 
outcome or risk indicators, should be monitored for 
hearing loss in the medical home. This monitoring 
should include regular surveillance of developmen-
tal milestones, auditory skills, parental concerns, 
and middle-ear status. The medical home concept 
refers typically to the pediatrician or other primary-
care physician.
(From the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, 2007, Year 2007 position statement:

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  227
electrical responses of  the brain to sound. It is a reliable mea-
sure that is readily recorded in newborns. For screening pur-
poses, the technique is often automated (automated ABR or 
AABR) to limit testing interpretation errors. Another technique 
is the measurement of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). OAEs are 
small-amplitude sounds that occur in response to stimuli being 
delivered to the ear. A sensitive microphone placed into the ear 
canal is used to monitor the presence of  the response follow-
ing stimulation. OAEs are reliably recorded in most infants who 
have normal cochlear function. There are various advantages 
and disadvantages to these two techniques. Most successful pro-
grams have developed strategies to incorporate both techniques 
in the screening of all newborns.
School-Age Screening
Not all children who have signifi cant hearing disorder are born 
with it. Some develop it early in childhood and will be missed by 
the early screening process. As a result, for many years efforts 
have been made to screen the hearing of  children as they en-
ter school. School screening programs are aimed at identifying 
children who develop hearing loss later in childhood or whose 
hearing disorder is mild enough to have escaped early detection. 
School screenings are usually carried out by nursing or other 
school personnel under the direction of an educational audiolo-
gist. It is not uncommon for screenings to occur upon entry into 
school, annually from kindergarten through grade 3, and then 
again at grades 7 and 11.
Screening the hearing of  children in schools is usually accom-
plished with behavioral pure-tone audiometry techniques. 
Typically, the intensity level of  the audiometer is fixed at 20 
to 30 dB, depending on the acoustic environment, and re-
sponses are screened across the audiometric frequency range. 
Children who do not pass the screening are referred to the au-
diologist for a complete audiologic evaluation. Most screening 
of  school-age children also includes an assessment of  middle-
ear function. Because young children are at risk for developing 
middle-ear diseases, some of  which can go undetected, efforts 
Otoacoustic emissions 
(OAEs) are measurable 
echoes emitted by the 
normal cochlea related to 
the function of the outer 
hair cells.

228  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
are made to evaluate middle-ear status with immittance audio-
metry screening.
Workplace Screening
Screening programs have also been developed for adults who are 
at risk for developing hearing loss, usually due to noise exposure. 
Two such groups are:
individuals who are entering the military or
• 
employees who are starting jobs in work settings that will 
• 
expose them to potentially damaging levels of noise.
These people are usually subjected to preenlistment or preemploy-
ment determination of baseline audiograms. In addition, they 
are reevaluated periodically in an effort to detect any changes that 
may be attributable to noise exposure in the workplace.
Screening of adults is usually accomplished by automated audi-
ometry. Automated screening makes use of computer-based in-
struments that are programmed to establish hearing sensitivity 
thresholds across the audiometric frequency range. These auto-
mated instruments have proven to be effective when applied to 
adult populations with large numbers of individuals who have 
normal hearing sensitivity.
The audiologist’s role is usually to coordinate the program, ensure 
the validity of the automated screening, and follow up on those 
who fail the screening and those whose hearing has changed on 
reevaluation. 
Summary
The main purpose of a hearing evaluation is to defi ne the na-
• 
ture and extent of hearing disorder.
The hearing evaluation serves as a fi rst step in the treatment of 
• 
hearing loss that results from the disorder.
Although the fundamental goal of an audiologic assessment 
• 
is similar for most patients, the specifi c focus of the evaluation 
can vary considerably, depending on the na ture of the patient 
and problem.
An initial audiogram 
obtained for comparison 
with later audiograms to 
quantify any change in 
hearing sensitivity is called a 
baseline audiogram.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  229
The answer to the question 
• 
Why is the patient being evaluated? is 
an important step in the assessment process because it guides 
the audiologist to an appropriate evaluative strategy. The na-
ture of the referral source is often a good indicator of why the 
patient is being evaluated.
An important starting point of any audiologic evaluation is the 
• 
case history. An effective case history guides the experienced 
audiologist in a number of ways.
One of the fi rst challenges an audiologist faces is to determine 
• 
whether a patient’s problem is strictly a communication dis-
order or if there is an underlying disease process that requires 
medical consultation.
The audiologic evaluation strategy includes determination 
• 
of hearing sensitivity and type of hearing loss, measurement 
of  speech understanding, assessment of  auditory process-
ing ability, and estimate of  communication limitations and 
restrictions.
The best single indicator of hearing loss, its impact on commu-
• 
nication, and the prognosis for successful hearing aid use is the 
pure-tone audiogram.
Suprathreshold measures provide an indicator of how the au-
• 
ditory system deals with sound at higher intensity levels. The 
most common suprathreshold measure in an audiologic evalu-
ation is that of speech recognition.
Another suprathreshold assessment is the evaluation of audi-
• 
tory processing ability, or the process by which the central au-
ditory nervous system transfers information from the VIIIth 
nerve to the auditory cortex.
Because of  the disparity among impairment, disability, and 
• 
handicap, it is important to assess the degree of activity limita-
tion and participation restriction that results from the impair-
ment. The most efficacious way of measuring limitation and 
restriction is by self-assessment scales.
One other challenge that an audiologist faces involves the 
• 
screening of hearing function of newborns, children entering 
school, and adults in occupations that expose them to poten-
tially dangerous levels of noise.

Short Answer Questions
 1. The purposes of hearing assessment are to determine the 
 and 
 of hearing loss.
 2. Information regarding auditory complaints, possible con-
tributing factors to a hearing loss, communication diffi culty, 
and information regarding development may be obtained 
during the 
 
.
 3. Inspection of the ear canal for evidence of infl ammation, 
foreign objects, excessive cerumen, and other abnormalities 
is known as 
. This is generally performed using 
an 
, a device with a light source and magnifi ca-
tion that permits visualization of the ear canal.
 4. Three types of procedures for removal of 
 from 
the ear canal are mechanical removal, 
, and 
suction.
 5. The use of 
 audiometry allows for assessment 
of the fl ow of energy through the middle ear. Three mea-
sures that can be obtained are 
 immittance, 
tympanometry, and acoustic refl ex thresholds.
 6. Immittance audiometry may reveal changes in fl ow of 
energy through the middle ear with various conditions. 
A signifi cant 
 pressure may be found with 
Eustachian tube dysfunction. Increases in 
 
in the system may be found with fl uid accumulation or 
growths behind the tympanic membrane. Increases in the 
 of the system may be found with 
 
chain fi xation, while decreases may be found with 
 of the ossicular chain.
 7. Hearing sensitivity is typically defi ned by determination of 
the 
 of audibility of sound. This information is 
typically obtained using 
-
 stimuli. 
 8. Hearing thresholds are charted on a graph of inten-
sity as a function of pure-tone frequency, known as an 
.
 9. The 
-recognition threshold provides the 
 lowest level at which speech can be perceived. It provides 
an estimate of thresholds for the “speech frequencies”: 
, 
, and 
 Hz.

CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT  231
 10. In order to separate conductive and sensorineural compo-
nents of hearing loss, different presentation of stimuli are 
utilized. In 
-
 (AC) presentation, 
sound is presented through the air to the tympanic mem-
brane. In 
-
 (BC) presentation, 
sound is presented via a vibrator, which directly transmits 
sounds through the bones of the skull to the cochlea, 
 bypassing the outer- and middle-ear systems.
 11. A signifi cant difference between bone-conduction and 
air-conduction thresholds is termed an 
-
 
. This represents a conductive 
component of a hearing loss.
 12. Major types of hearing loss can be determined from the 
thresholds represented on the audiogram. A 
 
hearing loss is demonstrated by the presence of an air-bone 
gap. A 
 hearing loss has elevated thresholds 
with no air-bone gap. Elevated bone-conduction thresh-
olds and the presence of an air-bone gap characterize a 
 hearing loss.
 13. Measurements of 
 function demonstrate how 
the auditory system performs at intensity levels greater than 
threshold.
 14. Speech-
 testing is a type of suprathreshold 
test in which 
 (single-syllable) word lists are 
 presented to listeners.
 15. Abnormal or reduced function of hearing is known as 
. The functional limitation imposed by a hearing 
loss is termed a 
. Obstacles to psychosocial func-
tion resulting from a disability are referred to as a 
. 
 16. Hearing 
 is a method of separating those indi-
viduals with normal auditory function from those who need 
additional testing.
 17. The goal of hearing screening in 
 is to deter-
mine presence of signifi cant sensorineural hearing loss for 
the purpose of providing treatment by 
 of age.
 18. Two measures commonly used for the purpose of
 
newborn hearing screening include automated 
 
 
 (AABR) testing and testing of 
 
 (OAEs).

232  CHAPTER 5  INTRODUCTION TO HEARING ASSESSMENT
 19. Screening of 
-
 children is aimed at 
identifi cation of children who develop hearing loss later in 
childhood. This type of screening is typically accomplished 
using 
 audiometry techniques.
 20.  Screening of adults who are at-risk for development 
for hearing loss as a consequence of work-related noise 
 exposure are typically involved in 
 hearing 
screenings.
Discussion Questions 
 1. Hearing screening of newborns is not universally applied 
in all areas. Given the goals of universal newborn hearing 
screening, discuss why it may not be utilized everywhere.
 2. Why is assessment of hearing limitations and restrictions so 
important in assessment? What factors other than charac-
teristics of the hearing loss itself might contribute to hear-
ing limitations and restrictions?
 3. Discuss why the “fi rst question,” asking why the patient is 
being evaluated, is so critical to hearing assessment.
 4. Explain the principle of cross-checking, and provide exam-
ples in which this principle may be used.
 5. Discuss why objective measures of auditory system func-
tion, such as auditory-evoked responses and otoacoustic 
emissions, may be benefi cial in some cases. What are the 
limitations of objective measures?

236  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
EQUIPMENT AND TEST ENVIRONMENT
The Audiometer
AN audiometer is an electronic instrument used by an audiolo-
gist to quantify hearing. An audiometer produces pure tones of 
various frequencies, attenuates them to various intensity levels, 
and delivers them to transducers. It also produces broad-band 
and narrow-band noise. In addition, the audiometer serves to 
attenuate and direct signals from other sources, such as a micro-
phone or compact disc player.
There are several types of audiometers, and they are classified 
primarily by their functions. For example, a clinical audiometer 
includes nearly all of  the functions that an audiologist might 
want to use for behavioral audiometric assessment. In contrast, a 
screening audiometer might generate only pure-tone signals de-
livered to earphones.
Regardless of audiometer type, there are three main components 
to any audiometer, as shown schematically in Figure 6-1. The pri-
mary components are
an 
• 
oscillator,
an 
• 
attenuator, and
an 
• 
interrupter switch.
The oscillator generates pure tones, usually at discrete frequen-
cies at the octave and mid-octave frequencies of 125, 250, 500, 
750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz. 
Broad-band noise is sound 
with a wide bandwidth, 
containing a continuous 
spectrum of frequencies 
with equal energy per cycle 
throughout the band.
Narrow-band noise is 
bandpass-ﬁ ltered noise that 
is centered at one of the 
audiometric frequencies.
There are three main 
components to any 
audiometer: an oscillator, 
an attenuator, and an 
interrupter switch.
Describe the uses, types, and components 
• 
of audiometers.
Explain what is meant by a “threshold” of 
• 
hearing sensitivity.
Understand the pure-tone audiogram.
• 
Explain how a description of a hearing loss 
• 
is derived from the audiogram.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
List the steps taken in establishing a pure-
• 
tone audiogram.
Describe the differences between air- and 
• 
bone-conduction hearing thresholds.
Explain the use of masking. Know why and 
• 
when it is used.

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  237
Some audiometers do not include all of these frequencies; other 
audiometers extend to higher frequencies. The oscillator is con-
trolled by some form of frequency-selector switch.
The attenuator controls the intensity level of the signal, usually 
in 5 dB steps from –10 dB HL to a maximum output level that 
varies by frequency and transducer type. Typical maximum out-
put levels for earphones are: 85 dB at 125 Hz, 105 dB at 250 Hz, 
120 dB from 500 through 4000 Hz, and 110 dB at 6000 and 
8000 Hz. Typical maximum output levels for bone-conduction 
vibrators are 65 dB at 500 Hz and 80 dB from 1000 to 4000 Hz. 
Some audiometers permit dB step sizes smaller than 5 dB. The 
attenuator is controlled by some form of intensity-selector dial 
or push button.
The interrupter switch controls the duration of the signal that is 
presented to the patient. The interrupter switch is typically set to 
the off position for pure-tone signals and is turned on when the 
presentation button is pressed. The interrupter switch is typically 
set to the on position for speech signals.
A photograph of an audiometer is shown in Figure 6-2. The ap-
pearance of an audiometer and the layout of its dials and buttons 
vary substantially across manufacturers. Features that are found 
on clinical audiometers include:
signal selector to choose the type of signal to be presented;
• 
signal router to direct the signal to the right ear, left ear, 
• 
both ears, bone vibrator, loudspeaker, etc.;
microphone to present speech;
• 
Oscillator
Interrupter
Switch
Attenuator
FIGURE 6-1 Components of an audiometer. 

238  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
VU meter to monitor the output of the oscillator, microphone, 
• 
CD player, etc.;
external input for CD player or other sound sources;
• 
auxiliary output for loudspeakers or other transducers; and
• 
patient response indicator to monitor when the patient 
• 
pushes a patient response button.
The type of audiometer described and shown here is considered a 
manual audiometer because control over the signal presentation 
is in the hands of the tester. Automatic audiometers also exist. Sig-
nal presentation in automatic audiometers is typically under com-
puter control. These devices are often used for screening purposes. 
As mentioned in Chapter 2, audiometers must meet calibration 
specifi cations set forth by the American National Standards Insti-
tute (ANSI S3.6-2004).
Transducers
Another important component of the audiometer system is the 
output transducer. Transducers are the devices that convert the 
A transducer is a device 
that converts one form of 
energy to another, such 
as an earphone or bone 
vibrator.

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  239
electrical energy from the audiometer into acoustical or vibratory 
energy. Transducers used for audiometric purposes are earphones, 
loudspeakers, or bone-conduction vibrators. Earphones are of 
three varieties, insert, supra-aural, and circumaural. An insert 
earphone is a small earphone coupled to the ear canal by means 
of an ear insert, which is made of pliable, soft material used to pro-
vide the acoustic coupling between an earphone and the ear ca-
nal. A photograph is shown in Figure 6-3. A supra-aural earphone 
is one mounted in a standard cushion that is placed over the ear. 
A photograph is shown in Figure 6-4. A circumaural earphone is 
one in which the transducer is mounted in a larger dome-shaped 
cushion that sits over and around the ear. The circumaural ear-
phone is used exclusively for extended high- frequency testing and 
uncommonly for routine threshold testing.
Although supra-aural earphones were the standard transduc-
ers for many years, in the 1980s, insert earphones arrived on 
the scene and, in many clinics, became the earphone of choice. 
There are several important clinical advantages to using insert 
earphones over supra-aural earphones. They are:
No more collapsing canals
• 
Placement of  supra-aural earphones can cause the ear 
 canals to collapse or close. This is especially true in older 
 patients whose ear canal cartilage is more pliable. Collapsed 
canals generally cause high-frequency conductive hearing

loss on the audiogram, a condition that is not experienced in 
real life without earphones. The alert audiologist will catch 
this, but it can cause signifi cant consternation during test-
ing.  Insert earphones eliminate this audiometric challenge.
Reduced need for masking
• 
Earphones deliver sound to the ear canal, but they also de-
liver vibration to the skull through the earphone cushion. 
The more contact the cushion has with the head, the more 
readily the vibration is transferred. This causes crossover to 
the other ear, a condition that creates the need to mask or 
keep the nontest ear busy during audiometric testing. Sound 
that is delivered to one ear is attenuated or reduced by the 
head as it crosses over to the other ear. This is referred to 
FIGURE 6-4 Photograph of supra-aural earphones. (Courtesy of Telephonics Corporation.)

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  241
as interaural attenuation (IA), or attenuation between the 
ears. The amount of IA is greater for insert earphones than 
for  supra-aural earphones. This means that crossover is less 
likely, thereby reducing the need to mask.
Enhanced placement stability
• 
Earphone placement affects the sound delivered to the ear. 
The size of this effect is smaller with properly placed insert 
earphones than with supra-aural earphones.
There are a few conditions in which supra-aural earphones are 
necessary, such as in those patients with atresia, a stenotic ear 
 canal, or a badly draining ear. For these patients, it is important to 
have supra-aural earphones available and calibrated for use.
Another transducer used routinely in clinical testing is a bone-
conduction vibrator. A bone vibrator is secured to the forehead or 
mastoid and used to stimulate the cochlea by vibrating the bones 
of the skull. A photograph is shown in Figure 6-5.

242  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
Test Environment
The testing environment must be particularly quiet to obtain valid 
hearing sensitivity thresholds. The American National Standards In-
stitute (ANSI, 2003) specifi es maximum permissible noise levels for 
audiometric test rooms. In order for these guidelines to be met, special 
rooms or test booths are used to provide suffi cient sound isolation.
THE AUDIOGRAM
Threshold of Hearing Sensitivity
The aim of pure-tone audiometry is to establish hearing thresh-
old sensitivity across the range of audible frequencies important 
for human communication. Threshold sensitivity is usually mea-
sured for a series of discrete sinusoids or pure tones. The object 
of pure-tone audiometry is to determine the lowest intensity of 
such a pure-tone signal that the listener can “just barely hear.” 
When thresholds have been measured at a number of different 
sinusoidal frequencies, the results are illustrated graphically, in 
a frequency-versus-intensity plot, to show threshold sensitivity 
across the frequency range. This graph is called an audiogram. In 
clinical pure-tone audiometry, thresholds are usually measured at 
sinusoidal frequencies over the range from 250 Hz at the low end 
to 8000 Hz at the high end. Within this range, thresholds are de-
termined at octave intervals in the range below 2000 Hz and at 
mid-octave intervals in the range above 2000 Hz. Thus, the audio-
metric frequencies for conventional pure-tone audiometry are 250, 
500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000 Hz.
The concept of threshold as the “just-audible” sound intensity is 
somewhat more complicated than it seems at fi rst glance. The prob-
lem is that, when a sound is very faint, the listener may not hear it 
every time it is presented. When sounds are fairly loud, they can be 
presented repeatedly, and the listener will almost always respond to 
them. Similarly, when sounds are very faint, they can be presented 
repeatedly, and the listener will almost never respond to them. But 
when the sound intensity is in the vicinity of threshold, the listener 
may not respond consistently. The same sound intensity might pro-
duce a response after some presentations but not after others. There-
fore, the search is for the sound intensity that produces a response 
from the listener about 50% of the time. This is the classical notion of 
An audiogram depicts the 
hearing sensitivity across a 
frequency range of 250 to 
8000 Hz.

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  243
a sensory threshold. Within the range of sound intensities over which 
the listener’s response falls from 100% to 0%, threshold is designated 
as the intensity level at which response accuracy is about 50%.
The Audiogram
In clinical audiometry, intensity is expressed on a decibel (dB) 
scale relative to “average normal hearing.” The zero point on this 
scale is the sound intensity corresponding to the average of thresh-
old intensities measured on a large sample of people with normal 
hearing. This decibel scale of sound intensities is called the hearing 
level scale, and is abbreviated as the HL scale. An audiogram is a 
plot of the listener’s threshold levels at the various test frequencies, 
where frequency is expressed in Hertz, or Hz, units, and the thresh-
old intensity is expressed on the HL dB scale. Figure 6-6 shows an 
example of such a plot. The zero line, running horizontally across 
the top of the graph, is sound intensity corresponding to average 
A decibel is a unit of sound 
intensity.

normal hearing at each of the test frequencies. Figure 6-7 shows 
that, for this listener, the threshold at 1000 Hz is 45 dB HL. This 
means that when 1000 Hz sinusoidal signals were presented to the 
listener and the intensity was systematically altered, the threshold, 
or intensity at which the sound was heard about 50% of the time 
was at an intensity level 45 dB higher than would be required for a 
person with average normal hearing.
Modes of Testing
There are two modes by which pure-tone test signals are presented 
to the auditory system: through the air via earphones or directly 
to the bones of the skull via a bone vibrator. When test signals are 
presented by earphones, via the air route, the manner of determining 
the audiogram is referred to as air-conduction pure-tone audiometry. 
Pure-tone test signals are usually  presented either to the right ear or

to the left ear independently. An audiogram is  generated separately 
for each ear. When test signals are presented via the bone route 
through a bone vibrator, the manner of determining the audiogram 
is referred to as bone-conduction  pure-tone audiometry.
The complete pure-tone audiogram, then, consists of four differ-
ent plots, the air-conduction and bone-conduction curves for the 
right ear and the air-conduction and bone-conduction curves for 
the left ear. Figure 6-8 illustrates how air- and bone-conduction 
thresholds are plotted on the audiogram form.
The two ears are not completely isolated from one another. 
 Signals presented to one ear can be transmitted, via bone con-
duction, to the other ear. Therefore, special precautions must be 
taken when testing one ear to be certain that the other ear is not 
participating in the response. This is particularly the case with 
unilateral hearing losses in which one ear has a greater hearing 
loss than the other. In such a case, the better ear may hear loud

sounds presented to the poorer ear. The most common method of 
prevention is to mask the nontest ear with an interfering sound 
so that it cannot hear the test signal being presented to the test 
ear. In the case of air-conduction testing, this is done whenever 
large ear asymmetry exists. In the case of bone-conduction test-
ing, however, masking is more often required because of the min-
imal isolation between ears via bone conduction.
Audiometric Symbols
The most commonly used symbols are based on guidelines from the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA, 1990), 
which are derived primarily from the American National Stan-
dards Institute (ANSI S23.21-1978). These symbols are shown 
in Figure 6-9. A different symbol is used to designate unmasked 
from masked responses from the right and left ears when signals 
are presented by air conduction or bone conduction. Different 
symbols are used for bone conduction, depending on placement 
To mask is to introduce 
sound to one ear while 
testing the other in an effort 
to eliminate any inﬂ uence of 
crossover of sound from the 
test ear to the nontest ear.

of the bone  vibrator. Symbols are also designated when thresholds 
are obtained to sound presented via loudspeaker in the sound fi eld. 
There are also recommended symbols for thresholds of the acous-
tic refl ex, which you will learn more about in Chapter 8.
Although these symbols are commonly used, there is a wide range 
of variation in the symbols and the way they are used across clin-
ics. Fortunately, it is standard for all audiogram forms to have 
symbol keys to reduce the risk of misinterpretation. Probably the 
most common variant of the symbol guidelines is the use of sepa-
rate graphs for results from each ear. This is quite common clini-
cally and is used in this text for the purposes of clarity.
Separate symbols may also be used when a patient does not re-
spond at the intensity limits of the equipment. The convention for 
a no-response symbol is a downward pointing arrow from the re-
sponse symbol, directed right for the left ear and left for the right 
ear, at the intensity level of the maximum output of the trans-
ducer at the test frequency. Care must be taken in the use of no-
response symbols to ensure that they are not misinterpreted as 
responses. Many audiologists opt to note no-responses in a man-
ner that more clearly guards against misinterpretation.
Audiometric Descriptions
The pure-tone audiogram tells us a number of important things 
about a person’s hearing loss. First, it provides a metric for degree 
of loss, whether it is:
minimal (11–25 dB),
• 
mild (26–40 dB),
• 
moderate (41–55 dB),
• 
moderately severe (56–70 dB),
• 
severe (71–90 dB), or
• 
profound (more than 90 dB).
• 
Figure 6-10 shows these ranges.
Second, the audiogram describes the shape of loss or the audio-
metric contour: a hearing loss may be the same at all frequencies 
and have a flat configuration; the loss may also increase as the 

248  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
curve moves from the low-frequency region to the high-frequency 
region and have a downward sloping contour; or the degree of 
loss may decrease as the curve moves from the low- to the high-
frequency region and have a rising contour (Figure 6-11).
Third, the audiogram provides a measure of interaural symmetry, 
or the extent to which hearing sensitivity is the same in both ears 
or better in one than the other (Figure 6-12).
Fourth, the combination of air- and bone-conduction audiometry 
allows the differentiation of hearing loss into one of three types 
(Figure 6-13):
 1. conductive,
 2. sensorineural, or
 3. mixed.
Interaural means between 
the ears.

These are the three major categories of peripheral hearing loss.

more typically, from disorders of the middle-ear vibratory system.

tory nerve. The audiometric signature of a conductive hearing

loss is reduced sensitivity via the air-conduction route, but rela-
tively normal sensitivity via the bone-conduction route.
Remember that the air-conduction loss refl ects disorders along the 
entire conductive and sensorineural systems, from middle ear to 
cochlea to auditory nerve. The bone-conduction loss, however, re-
fl ects only a disorder in the cochlea and auditory nerve. The bone-
conducted signal goes directly to the cochlea, in effect by-passing the 
external and middle-ear portions of the auditory system. Strictly 
speaking, this is not quite true. Changes in middle-ear dynamics do 
affect bone-conduction sensitivity in predictable ways, but as a fi rst 
approximation, this is a useful way of thinking about the difference 
between conductive and sensorineural  audiograms. Comparisons

however, both air-conduction and bone-conduction sensitivity are 
reduced equally. If there is a loss by both air and bone conduction, 
but more loss by air than by bone, then the loss is categorized as 
mixed. In a mixed loss, there is both a conductive and a sensorineu-
ral component.
ESTABLISHING THE PURE-TONE 
AUDIOGRAM
Establishing a pure-tone audiogram is the cornerstone of  a 
hearing evaluation. Simple in concept and strategy, it can also 
be the most difficult of  all measures in the audiologic battery. 
The paradox is complete. On one hand, pure-tone audiometry 
is so structured and rule-driven that it can be automated easily 
for computer-based testing. Such automated testing works well 
and is quite appropriate for testing large numbers of cooperative 
adults. On the other hand, in the clinic, the audiologist evaluates

(AENT) Clinic. AENT Clinic was established over 30 years ago 
by two otolaryngologists: Dr. Butler and Dr. Burns. Today the 
clinic has grown to12 physicians and 10 audiologists. In ad-
dition to our fi ve main clinics, AENT Clinic has four satellite 
offi ces serving patients in communities surrounding Austin.
What I Do: I am a clinical audiologist. My responsibilities include pediatric and adult au-
diological assessments, hearing aid evaluations and fi ttings, and fi tting of hearing protection 
devices.
Why Audiology? Working with patients and their families during the process of fi tting 
hearing aids is very challenging and rewarding. I enjoy knowing patients on a personal level 
and learning that their quality of life has improved because of my services. It is a luxury to love 
one’s work; and my fellow audiologists and physicians I work with make that possible for me.

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  253
patients of all ages, with varying degrees and types of hearing 
loss. Establishing a pure-tone audiogram can be quite challeng-
ing, and the nuances of testing require substantial experience.
Patient Preparation
It is important to prepare the patient properly for testing, and 
that begins with correct placement within the test room. In most 
cases, the patient is seated in a sound-treated room or booth and 
is observed by the audiologist from an adjoining room through a 
window. The experienced audiologist gains considerable insight 
from observing patients as they respond to sounds. It is most com-
mon to face the patient at an angle looking slightly away from the 
window. This is important to avoid the possibility of any inadver-
tent facial or other physical cuing that a sound is being presented. 
An alternative is to arrange the lighting so that the audiologist is 
not altogether visible through the window. Regardless, the audi-
ologist should be in a position to observe the response of the pa-
tient, whether it be the raising of a hand or fi nger, or the pressing 
of a response button.
The next step in the preparation process is inspection of the ear 
canals. As discussed in Chapter 5, otoscopic inspection of the ear 
canal is an important prerequisite to earphone placement and 
testing. If the ear canal is free of occluding cerumen, testing may 
proceed. If the ear canal is occluded with wax, it is far better to 
proceed only after it has been removed.
Once the ear canal has been inspected and prior to earphone 
placement, the patient should be instructed about the nature of 
the test and the audiologist’s expectation of the patient. Every au-
diologist has a slightly different way of saying it, but the instruc-
tions are essentially these: Following earphone placement, you will 
be hearing some tones or beeps. Please respond each time you hear the 
sound by raising a fi nger or pressing a button for as long as you hear 
the sound. Stop responding when you no longer hear the sound. We are 
interested in knowing the softest sound that you can hear, so please re-
spond even if  you just barely hear it. You should also instruct the 
patient that you will be testing different tones and in both ears. It 
is important that the patient understands the overt response that 
you are expecting. Appropriate responses include raising a fi nger 

254  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
or hand, pressing a response switch, or saying yes when a tone 
has been perceived.
Proper earphone placement is an important next step in the pro-
cess. A misplaced earphone will result in elevation of  hearing 
thresholds in the lower frequencies. Insert earphones are placed 
by compressing the pliable cuff, pulling up and back on the exter-
nal ear, and placing the cuff fi rmly into the ear canal. It is helpful 
to hold the cuff in place momentarily while it expands to fi ll the 
ear canal. If you are using supra-aural earphones, care must be 
taken to ensure that the earphone speaker is directed over the ear 
canal opening.
Audiometric Test Technique
The establishment of  pure-tone thresholds is based on a psy-
chophysical paradigm that is a modifi ed method of limits. Modern 
audiometric techniques are based on a consensus of recommen-
dations that trace back to pioneering efforts of Reger (1950) and 
especially Carhart and Jerger (1959). Although the precise strat-
egy may vary among audiologists, the following strategies and 
conventions generally apply:
 1. Test the better ear fi rst. Based on the patient’s report, the 
better ear should be chosen to begin testing. Knowledge of 
the better-ear thresholds becomes important later for mask-
ing purposes. If hearing is reported to be the same in both 
ears, begin with the right ear.
 2. Begin threshold search at 1000 Hz. This is a relatively easy 
signal to perceive, and it is often a frequency at which bet-
ter hearing occurs. You must begin somewhere, and clinical 
 experience suggests that this is a good place to start.
 3. Continuous or pulsed tones should be presented for about 
1 second. Pulsed tones are often easier for the listener to 
perceive and can be achieved manually or, on most audio-
meters, automatically.
 4. Begin presenting signals at an intensity level at which the 
patient can clearly hear. This gives the patient experience 
listening to the signal of interest. If you anticipate from 
the case history and from conversing with the patient that 
hearing is going to be normal or near normal, then begin 

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  255
testing at 40 dB HL. If you anticipate that the patient has a 
mild hearing impairment, then begin at a higher intensity 
level, say 60 dB, and so on.
 5. If the patient does not respond, increase the intensity level 
by 20 dB until a response occurs. Once the patient responds 
to the signal, threshold search begins.
 6. Threshold search follows the “down 10, up 5” rule. This 
rule states that if the patient hears the tone, intensity is 
 decreased by 10 dB, and if the patient does not hear the 
tone, intensity is increased by 5 dB. This threshold search is 
illustrated in Figure 6-14.
 7. Threshold is considered to be the lowest level at which the 
patient perceives the tone about 50% of the time (either 
2 out of 4 or 3 out of 6 presentations).
 8. Once threshold has been established at 1000 Hz, proceed to 
test 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, 8000, 1000 (again), 500, 
and 250 Hz. Repeat testing at 1000 Hz in the fi rst ear tested 
to ensure that the response is not slightly better now that 
the patient has learned the task.
 9. Test the other ear in the same manner.

Air Conduction
Hearing thresholds by air conduction are established to describe 
hearing sensitivity for the entire auditory system. Air-conduction 
testing provides an assessment of the functional integrity of the 
outer, middle, and inner ears. The term air conduction is used be-
cause signals are presented through the air via earphones.
As you learned earlier, there are two major types of air-conduction 
transducers, supra-aural earphones and insert earphones. 
Examples are shown previously in Figures 6-3 and 6-4. Supra-
aural earphones are mounted in cushions that are placed over the 
outer ear. This type of earphone was the standard for many years. 
It had as its advantages ease of placement over the ears and ease 
of calibration.
The newer type of earphone is called an insert earphone. An insert 
earphone consists of a loudspeaker mounted in a small box that 
sends the acoustic signal through a tube to a cuff that is inserted 
into the ear canal. Insert earphones are now the standard for clin-
ical use. As you learned earlier, insert earphones have several ad-
vantages related to sound isolation and interaural attenuation.
If a patient has normal outer- and middle-ear function, then air-
conduction thresholds will tell the entire story about hearing 
sensitivity of  the cochlea. If  a patient has a disorder of  outer- 
or middle-ear function, then air-conduction thresholds refl ect 
the additive effects of  (1) any sensorineural loss due to inner-
ear disorder and (2) any conductive loss imposed by outer- or 
middle-ear disorder. Bone-conduction testing must be completed 
to separate the contribution of  the two disorders to the overall 
 extent of the loss.
Bone Conduction
Bone-conduction thresholds are established in a manner simi-
lar to air-conduction thresholds, but with a different transducer. 
In this case, a bone vibrator (shown previously in Figure 6-5) 
is used to generate vibrations of the skull and stimulate the co-
chlea directly. Theoretically, thresholds by bone conduction re-
fl ect function of the cochlea, regardless of the status of the outer

or middle ears. Therefore, if  a person has normal middle-ear 
function on one day and middle-ear disorder on the next, hear-
ing by bone conduction will be unchanged, while hearing by air 
conduction will be adversely affected.
The bone-conduction transducer has changed little over the years, 
and the only real decisions that have to be made are related to vi-
brator placement and masking issues. Some clinicians choose to 
place the vibrator on the mastoid-bone prominence behind the 
pinna, so called mastoid placement. Others choose to place it on 
the forehead.
Regardless of where the bone vibrator is placed on the skull, both 
cochleas are likely to be stimulated to the same extent. Actually, 
there is a little interaural attenuation of high-frequency signals 
when the bone is placed on the mastoid, but it is negligible for 
lower frequencies.
One advantage of mastoid placement is that, because there is a 
little interaural attenuation of the high frequencies, the cochlea 
on the side with the bone vibrator is at least partially isolated. This 
may reduce the need to mask or make it easier in some situations. 
Another advantage is that thresholds are slightly better with mas-
toid placement, an important factor when a hearing loss is near 
the level of maximum output of the bone vibrator. In such a case, 
you may be able to measure threshold with mastoid placement 
and not be able to do so with forehead placement.
Forehead placement also has its advantages. Some are simply 
practical. The forehead is an easier location to achieve stable 
vibrator placement, enhancing test-retest reliability. It is also 
easier to prepare the patient by putting on the bone vibrator and 
earphones at the start of  testing and not having to move back 
and forth from room to room to switch ears. The assumption of 
forehead bone-conduction placement is that bone-conduction 
thresholds are always masked, which is probably good practice in 
all cases.
Most seasoned audiologists are prepared to use either mastoid or fore-
head placement, depending on the nature of the clinical question.

258  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
Masking
Air-conduction and bone-conduction pure-tone audiometry are 
often confounded by crossover or contralateralization of the signal. 
A signal that is presented to one ear, if it is of suffi cient magni-
tude, can be perceived by the other ear. This is known as cross-
over of the signal. Suppose, for example, that a patient has normal 
hearing in the right ear and a profound hearing loss in the left ear. 
When tones presented to the left ear reach a certain level, they 
Crossover results when 
sound presented to one 
ear through an earphone 
crosses the head via bone 
conduction and is perceived 
by the other ear.
Contributors to Bone-Conduction Hearing
When a sound is delivered to the skull through a bone vibra-
tor, the cochlea is stimulated in several ways. The primary 
stimulation of the cochlea occurs when the temporal bone 
vibrates, causing displacement of the cochlear partition. A 
secondary stimulation occurs as a result of the middle-ear 
component, due to a lag between the vibrating mastoid pro-
cess and the vibrating ossicular chain. This is referred to as 
inertial bone conduction. That is, the ossicles are moving rela-
tive to the head, thereby stimulating the cochlea. A third, and 
minor, component of bone-conducted hearing is sometimes 
referred to as osseotympanic bone conduction. Here, the vi-
bration of the external ear canal wall is radiated into the ear 
canal and tranduced by the tympanic membrane.
The result of  all of  this is that most of  the hearing mea-
sured by bone conduction is due to direct stimulation of the 
cochlea—most, but not all. Therefore, in certain circum-
stances, a disorder of the middle ear can reduce the inertial 
and osseotympanic components of bone conduction, result-
ing in an apparent sensorineural component to the hearing 
loss. We often see this in patients with otosclerosis. They 
show a hearing loss by bone conduction around 2000 Hz, 
the so-called Carhart’s notch. Once surgery is performed to 
free the ossicular chain, the “sensorineural” component to 
the loss disappears. Actually, what appears to occur is that 
the inertial component to bone-conducted hearing that was 
reduced by stapes fi xation is restored.

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  259
will cross over the head and be heard by the right ear. As a result, 
although you may be trying to test the left ear, you will actually be 
testing the right ear because the signal is crossing the head.
When crossover has occurred, you need to isolate the ear that you 
are trying to test by masking the other (nontest) ear. Masking is a 
procedure wherein noise is placed in one ear to keep it occupied 
while the other ear is being tested. In the current example, the 
right, or normal hearing, ear would need to be masked by intro-
ducing suffi cient noise to keep it occupied while the left ear is be-
ing tested. With appropriate masking noise in the right ear, the 
left ear can be isolated for determination of thresholds.
One of the most important concepts related to masking is that 
of interaural attenuation. The term interaural attenuation was 
coined to describe the amount of reduction in intensity (attenua-
tion) that occurs as a signal crosses over the head from one ear to 
the other (interaural or between ears). Using our example, let us 
say that the right ear threshold is 10 dB and the left ear threshold 
is 100 dB at 1000 Hz. As you try to establish threshold in the left 
ear, the patient responds at a level of, say, 70 dB, because the tone 
crosses the head and is heard by the right ear. The amount of in-
teraural attenuation in this case is 60 dB (70 dB threshold in the 
unmasked left ear minus 10 dB threshold in the right ear). That is, 
the signal level being presented to the left ear was reduced or at-
tenuated by 60 dB as it crossed the head.
The amount of  interaural attenuation depends on the type of 
transducer used. Table 6-1 shows the amount of interaural attenu-
ation for two different types of transducers: supra-aural earphones 
and insert earphones. Insert earphones have the highest amount 
of interaural attenuation and, thus, the lowest risk of crossover. 
This is related to the amount of vibration that is delivered by the 
transducer to the skin surface. An insert earphone produces sound 
vibration in a loudspeaker that is separated from the insert portion 
by a relatively long tube. Very little of the insert is in contact with 
the skin, and the amount of vibration transferred from it to the 
skull is minimal. Supra-aural earphones are in contact with more 
of the surface of the skin, thereby reducing the amount of inter-
aural attenuation and increasing the risk of crossover.
Interaural attenuation 
(IA) is the reduction in 
sound energy of a signal 
as it is transmitted by bone 
conduction from one side of 
the head to the opposite ear.

260  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
A bone-conduction transducer vibrates the skin and skull directly, 
resulting in the lowest amount of interaural attenuation and the 
highest risk of crossover. Interaural attenuation by bone conduc-
tion is negligible in the low frequencies and ranges from 0 to 15 dB 
at 4000 Hz.
The need to mask the nontest ear is related to the amount of in-
teraural attenuation. If the difference in thresholds between ears 
exceeds the amount of  interaural attenuation, then there is a 
possibility that the nontest rather than the test ear is responding. 
Minimum levels of interaural attenuation are usually set to pro-
vide guidance as to when crossover may be occurring. These lev-
els are set as a function of transducer type as follows:
Supra-aural earphones: 
40 dB
Insert earphones: 
50 dB
Bone-conduction vibrator: 
0 dB
Thus, if you are using supra-aural earphones, crossover may oc-
cur when the threshold from one ear exceeds the threshold from 
the other ear by 40 dB or more. If you are using insert earphones, 
crossover may occur if inter-ear asymmetry exceeds 50 dB. If you 
are using a bone-conduction vibrator, crossover may occur at any 
time, since the signal is not necessarily attenuated as it crosses the 
head. These minimum interaural attenuation levels dictate when 
masking should be used.

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  261
Air-Conduction Masking
Masking should be used during air-conduction audiometry when-
ever the air-conducted threshold of  the ear under test exceeds 
the bone-conduction threshold of the nontest ear by more than 
the minimum interaural attenuation levels. For example, say you 
have established air-conduction thresholds in the right ear to be 
0 dB throughout the frequency range. Because bone-conduction 
thresholds cannot be poorer than air-conduction thresholds, then 
bone-conduction threshold for that ear is considered 0 dB. If you 
are using insert earphones and are testing the left ear, you know 
that thresholds are valid for the left ear if they are within 50 dB of 
the right-ear bone-conduction thresholds. You know this because 
50 dB is the minimum interaural attenuation for insert earphones. 
Therefore, if a threshold in the left ear is 50 dB or better, you can 
safely assume that no masking is needed and that the response is 
truly a threshold from the left ear. If, however, the threshold ex-
ceeds 50 dB, then it could be a response from the right ear due to 
crossover, and masking is necessary.
The rule for air-conduction masking is relatively simple: if  the 
thresholds from the test ear exceed the bone-conduction thresholds 
of  the nontest ear by the amount of  minimum interaural attenua-
tion, then masking must be used. An important caveat is that, even 
though you are testing by air conduction, the critical difference 
is between the air-conduction thresholds of the test ear and the 
bone-conduction thresholds of the nontest ear. Remember that 
the signal crossing over is from vibrations transferred from the 
transducer to the skull. These vibrations are perceived by the op-
posite cochlea directly, not by the opposite outer ear. Therefore, if 
the nontest ear has an air-conduction threshold of 30 dB and a 
bone-conduction threshold of 0 dB, then masking should be used 
if the test ear has a threshold of 50 dB, not 80 dB.
It is typical in pure-tone audiometry to establish air-conduction 
thresholds in the better ear fi rst, followed by air-conducted thresh-
olds in the poorer ear. In many instances this procedure works 
well. Problems arise when the better ear has a conductive hearing 
loss, and the air-conduction thresholds are not refl ective of the 
bone-conduction thresholds for that ear. Once bone-conduction 
thresholds are ultimately established, air-conduction thresholds 

262  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
may need to be re-established if the thresholds from one ear turn 
out to have exceeded the bone-conduction thresholds from the 
other ear by more than minimum interaural attenuation.
Bone-Conduction Masking
Masking should be used during bone-conduction audiometry 
 under most circumstances, because the amount of interaural at-
tenuation is negligible. For example, if you place the bone vibrator 
on the right mastoid, it may stimulate both cochleas identically 
because there is no attenuation of  the signal as it crosses the 
head. In reality, there is some amount of interaural attenuation of 
the bone-conducted signal. However, the amount is small enough 
that it is safest to assume that there is no attenuation and sim-
ply always mask during bone-conduction testing. Some clinicians 
choose to surrender to this notion and test with the bone vibrator 
placed on the forehead, always masking the nontest ear.
The rule for bone-conduction masking is very simple: always use 
masking in the nontest ear during bone conduction testing. It is safest 
to assume that no interaural attenuation occurs and that the risk 
of testing the nontest ear is omnipresent.
Masking Strategies
Students who become audiologists will eventually learn how to 
mask. This will be no easy task at fi rst. The idea seems simple—
keep one ear busy while you test the other. But there is a sig-
nifi cant challenge in doing that. You must ensure that you have 
enough masking to keep the nontest ear busy, but you must also 
ensure that you do not have too much masking in the nontest ear 
or you will begin to mask the ear you are trying to test.
There are a number of different approaches to determine what is 
effective masking. One that has stood the test of time is called the 
plateau method. A graphic representation of the plateau method 
is shown in Figure 6-15.
Briefl y, threshold for a given pure tone is established in the test ear, 
narrow-band noise is presented to the nontest ear, and threshold 
is reestablished in the test ear. If the nontest ear is responding, 
under masking is occurring. The presence of masking noise in 
The plateau method is 
a method of masking the 
nontest ear in which masking 
is introduced progressively 
over a range of intensity levels 
until a plateau is reached, 
indicating the level of masked 
threshold of the test ear.

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  263
that ear will shift the threshold in the test ear, and the patient will 
stop responding. The level of the pure tone is then increased and 
presented. If the patient responds, the masking level is increased 
and so on. Eventually a level of effective masking will be reached 
where increasing the masking noise will no longer result in a shift 
of threshold in the test ear. This is referred to as the plateau of the 
masking function and signifi es that the nontest ear has been effec-
tively masked and that responses are truly from the test ear. When 
masking is raised above this level, the masking noise itself may ex-
ceed the interaural attenuation value and actually cross over to 
interfere with the test ear. This is referred to as overmasking.
There are a number of  other techniques used in masking the 
nontest ear. One popular method is referred to as step masking 
(Katz & Lezynski, 2002). In this procedure, an initial masking 
Overmasking results 
when the Intensity level of 
masking in the nontest ear is 
sufﬁ cient to cross over to the 
test ear, thereby elevating 
the threshold in the test ear.
FIGURE 6-15 Schematic representation of the plateau method of masking. The patient responds 
to a pure-tone signal presented at 30 dB with no masking in the nontest ear. When 
30 dB of masking is introduced, the patient no longer responds, indicating that 
the initial response was heard in the nontest ear. During the undermasking phase, 
the patient responds as the pure-tone level is increased but discontinues respond-
ing when masking is increased by the same amount. Threshold for the test ear is at 
the level of the plateau, or 60 dB. At the plateau, the patient continues to respond 
as masking level is increased in the nontest ear. During overmasking, the patient 
 discontinues responding as masking level is increased.

level of 30 dB SL (i.e., 30 dB above the patient’s air-conduction 
threshold in the ear being masked) is used. If the patient’s thresh-
old in the test ear does not change with this masking noise in 
the nontest ear, the threshold is considered to be accurate with 
no evidence of crossover. If the threshold in the test ear changes 
signifi cantly, then a subsequent masking level, usually of an ad-
ditional 20 dB, is used. This process is continued until an accu-
rate threshold is determined.
One other masking technique that is used for establishing bone-
conduction thresholds is the sensorineural acuity level (SAL) test. 
For conventional bone-conduction testing, pure tones are pre-
sented through the bone vibrator and masking noise through an 
earphone. The bone vibrator is often placed on the forehead, and 
noise is presented to the nontest ear to mask it. The SAL test is 
done in the opposite manner. Threshold is established in the test 
ear by air conduction. Bone-conducted noise is then introduced 
to the bone vibrator on the forehead at a maximum level, and air-
conduction thresholds are reestablished. The amount of threshold 
shift that occurs is then compared to a normative level, and the 
conductive component is calculated. The SAL test is a very useful 
clinical technique for at least three reasons:
 1. it is often a much easier task for young children than con-
ventional masked bone conduction,
 2. it may be more accurate for small air-bone gaps, and
 3. it serves as a valuable cross-check for conventional masked 
bone-conduction audiometry.
The Masking Dilemma
A point can be reached where masked testing cannot be completed 
due to the size of the air-bone gap. This is often referred to as a 
masking dilemma. A masking dilemma occurs when the difference 
between the bone-conduction threshold in the test ear and the air-
conduction threshold in the nontest ear approaches the amount 
of interaural attenuation. An example of such an audiogram is 
shown in Figure 6-16. Unmasked bone-conduction thresholds for 
the right ear are around 0 dB. Unmasked air-conduction thresh-
olds for the left ear are around 60 dB. If we wish to mask the left ear 
and establish either air-conduction or bone-conduction thresholds 
A masking dilemma 
occurs when both ears 
have large air-bone gaps, 
and masking can only be 
introduced at a level that 
results in overmasking.

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  265
in the right ear, we are in trouble from the start, because we need to 
introduce masking to the left ear at 70 dB, a level that could cross 
over the head and mask the ear that we are trying to test. When a 
masking dilemma occurs, threshold may not be determinable by 
conventional audiometric means.
Audiometry Unplugged: Tuning Fork Tests
Prior to the advent of  the electronic audiometer, tuning forks 
were used to screen for hearing loss and to predict the presence 
of middle-ear disorder. Most otologists still use tuning forks today 
to assess the probability of conductive disorder. Most audiologists

still use the audiometric equivalent of at least one or two of the 
old tuning-fork tests as a cross-check for the validity of their bone-
conduction audiometric results.
A tuning fork is a metal instrument with two prongs and a shank 
that is designed to vibrate at a fi xed frequency when struck. Tun-
ing forks of 256 and 512 Hz are commonly used. Because the in-
tensity can vary considerably depending on the force with which 
the fork is struck, estimating threshold levels can be diffi cult. But 
in the hands of a skilled observer, tuning fork tests can be quite 
accurate at assessing the presence of conductive disorder. There 
are four primary tuning fork tests: the Schwabach, Rinne, Bing, 
and Weber.
The Schwabach test is done by placing the shank of the tuning fork 
on the mastoid. The patient is instructed to indicate the presence 
of sound for the duration that it is perceived, while the examiner 
does the same. If the patient perceives the sound longer than the 
examiner, the result is consistent with conductive disorder. If the 
examiner perceives the sound longer than the patient, the result is 
consistent with sensorineural disorder.
The Rinne test is carried out by comparing the length of time that 
a tone is perceived by air conduction in comparison to bone con-
duction. If the tone is heard for the same duration by air and bone 
conduction, it is considered a positive Rinne, consistent with sen-
sorineural disorder. If the tone is heard for a longer duration by 
bone conduction than by air, it is considered a negative Rinne, 
consistent with conductive disorder.
The Bing test is done by comparing the perceived loudness of 
a bone-conducted tone with the ear canal unoccluded and oc-
cluded. In an ear with a conductive hearing loss, occluding the 
ear canal should not have much of an effect on loudness percep-
tion of the tone, due to the already-present occlusion effect of the 
middle-ear disorder. If the tone is perceived to be louder with the 
ear canal occluded, results are consistent with normal hearing 
or a sensorineural hearing loss. If the tone is not perceived to be 
louder, results are consistent with a conductive hearing loss. An 
audiometric variation of the Bing test is often referred to as the 
occlusion index. The occlusion index is calculated by measuring 

CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY  267
bone-conduction thresholds at 250 or 500 Hz with and without 
the ear canal occluded. A signifi cant improvement in threshold 
with the ear canal occluded rules out conductive hearing loss.
The Weber test is carried out by placing the tuning fork in the cen-
ter of the forehead and asking the patient to indicate in which ear 
the sound is perceived. If one ear has a conductive hearing loss, the 
sound will lateralize to that side. If both ears have a conductive hear-
ing loss, the sound will lateralize to the side with the largest conduc-
tive component. Perception of the sound at midline suggests normal 
hearing, sensorineural hearing loss, or symmetric conductive loss. 
Said another way, if the Weber lateralizes to the better ear, the loss in 
the poorer ear is sensorineural. If the Weber lateralizes to the poorer 
ear, the loss in the poorer ear is conductive. The Weber is most effec-
tive with low-frequency stimulation. The audiometric Weber is carried 
out in the same manner, except the stimulation is done with a bone 
vibrator rather than a tuning fork.
Most seasoned audiologists are well versed at carrying out audio-
metric Weber testing and measurement of the occlusion index. 
Both measures can be very useful in verifying the presence of an 
air-bone gap.
Summary
An audiometer is an electronic instrument used by an audiologist 
• 
to quantify hearing.
An audiometer produces pure tones of various frequencies and 
• 
other signals, attenuates them to various intensity levels, and 
delivers them to transducers.
An important component of  the audiometer system is the 
• 
output transducer, which converts electrical energy from the 
audiometer into acoustical or vibratory energy. Transducers 
used for audiometric purposes are earphones, loudspeakers, 
and bone-conduction vibrators.
The aim of  pure-tone audiometry is to establish hearing 
• 
threshold sensitivity across the range of audible frequencies 
important for human communication.
Establishing a pure-tone audiogram is the cornerstone of  a 
• 
hearing evaluation.

268  CHAPTER 6  PURE-TONE AUDIOMETRY
The establishment of pure-tone thresholds is based on a psy-
• 
chophysical paradigm that is a modifi ed method of limits.
Hearing thresholds by air conduction are established to  describe 
• 
hearing sensitivity for the entire auditory system.
Hearing thresholds by bone conduction refl ect function of the 
• 
cochlea, regardless of the status of the outer or middle ears.
Air-conduction and bone-conduction pure-tone audiometry 
• 
are often confounded by crossover or contralateralization of 
the signal.
When crossover has occurred, the test ear needs to be isolated 
• 
by masking the other (nontest) ear.
Tuning fork tests and their audiometric equivalents can be 
• 
helpful in elucidating the presence of conductive disorder.

274  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
SPEECH AUDIOMETRY
SPEECH AUDIOMETRY is a key component of audiologic as-
sessment. Because it uses the kinds of auditory signals present 
in everyday communication, speech audiometry can tell us, in a 
more realistic manner than with pure tones, how an auditory dis-
order might impact communication in daily living. Also, the infl u-
ence of disorder on speech processing can be detected at virtually 
every level of the auditory system. Speech measures can thus be 
used diagnostically to examine processing ability and the man-
ner in which it is affected by disorders of the middle ear, cochlea, 
auditory nerve, brainstem pathways, and auditory centers in the 
cortex. In addition, there is a predictable relation between a per-
son’s hearing for pure tones and hearing for speech. Thus, speech 
audiometric testing can serve as a cross-check of the validity of 
the pure-tone audiogram.
In many ways, speech audiometry can be thought of as our best 
friend in the clinic. Young children usually respond more easily to 
the presentation of speech materials than to pure tones. As a result, 
estimates of thresholds for speech recognition are often sought fi rst 
in children to provide the audiologist guidance in establishing pure-
tone thresholds. In adults, suprathreshold speech understanding 
may be a sensitive indicator of retrocochlear disorder, even in the 
presence of normal hearing sensitivity. A thorough assessment of 
speech understanding in such patients may assist in the diagnosis 
of neurologic disease. In elderly individuals, speech audiometry

is a vital component in our understanding of  the patient’s 
communication function. The degree of  hearing impairment 
described by pure-tone thresholds often underestimates the amount 
of communication disorder that a patient has, and suprathreshold 
speech audiometry can provide a better metric for understanding 
the degree of hearing impairment resulting from the disorder.
Uses of Speech Audiometry
Speech audiometric measures are used routinely in an audio-
logic evaluation and contribute in a number of important ways, 
including:
measurement of threshold for speech,
• 
cross-check of pure-tone sensitivity,
• 
quantifi cation of suprathreshold speech-recognition ability,
• 
assistance in differential diagnosis,
• 
assessment of auditory processing ability, and
• 
estimation of communicative function.
• 
Speech Thresholds
The term speech threshold (ST) refers to the lowest level at which 
speech can be either detected or recognized. The threshold of de-
tection is referred to as the speech detection threshold (SDT) or the 
speech awareness threshold (SAT). Although synonymous, the term 
SDT is probably more accurate and will be used here to designate 
the lowest level at which speech is perceived. The threshold of 
recognition is referred to as the speech-recognition threshold, speech 
reception threshold, or spondee threshold. Historically, speech recep-
tion threshold was the more common term; spondee threshold the 
more accurate one. Here the term speech-recognition threshold (SRT) 
will be used to designate the lowest level at which spondee words 
can be identifi ed.
The speech threshold is a measure of the threshold of sensitiv-
ity for hearing or identifying speech signals. Even in isolation, a 
speech threshold provides significant information. It estimates 
hearing sensitivity in the frequency region of the audiogram where 
the major components of speech fall, thereby providing a useful esti-
mate of degree of hearing loss for speech.
SRT is the threshold level 
for speech recognition, 
expressed as the lowest 
intensity level at which 50% 
of spondaic words can be 
identiﬁ ed.

276  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
Pure-tone Cross-check
Often the audiologist will establish an SRT fi rst to provide guidance 
as to the level at which pure-tone thresholds are likely to fall. The 
SRT should agree closely with the pure-tone thresholds averaged 
across 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz (pure-tone average or PTA). That 
is, if both the pure-tone intensity levels and the speech intensity 
levels are expressed on the dB HL scale, the degree of hearing loss 
for speech should agree with the degree of hearing loss for pure 
tones in the 500 through 2000 Hz region. In practice, speech sig-
nals seem to be easier to process and sometimes result in lower ini-
tial estimates of threshold than testing with pure tones. In such a 
case, the audiologist will be alerted to the fact that the pure-tone 
thresholds may actually be suprathreshold and that the patient will 
need to be reinstructed. The extreme case of this is the patient who 
is feigning a hearing loss, often called malingering. In the case of 
malingering, the SRT may be substantially better than the PTA.
Speech Recognition
Pure-tone thresholds and speech detection thresholds character-
ize the lowest level at which a person can detect sound, but they 
provide little insight into how a patient hears above threshold, at 
suprathreshold levels. Speech recognition testing is designed to 
provide an estimate of suprathreshold ability to recognize speech. 
In its most fundamental form, speech recognition testing involves 
the presentation of single-syllable words at a fi xed intensity level 
above threshold. This is referred to as word-recognition testing or, 
more colloquially, as speech discrimination testing. The patient is 
asked to repeat the words that are presented, and a percentage-
correct score is calculated.
Results of  word-recognition testing are generally predictable 
from the degree and confi guration of the pure-tone audiogram. 
It is in this predictability that the value of the test lies. If word-
recognition scores equal or exceed those that might be expected 
from the audiogram, then suprathreshold speech recognition 
ability is thought to be normal for the degree of hearing loss. If 
word recognition scores are poorer than would be expected, then 
suprathreshold ability is abnormal for the degree of hearing loss. 
Abnormal speech recognition is often the result of cochlear dis-
tortion or retrocochlear disorder.
The pure-tone average 
is the average of thresholds 
obtained at 500, 1000, and 
2000 Hz, and should closely 
agree with the ST or SRT.

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  277
Thus, word-recognition testing can be useful in providing 
estimates of communication function and in identifying patients 
with speech perception that is poorer than might be predicted 
from the audiogram.
Differential Diagnosis
Speech audiometric measures can be useful in differentiating 
whether a hearing disorder is due to changes in the outer or mid-
dle ear, cochlea, or auditory peripheral or central nervous systems. 
Again, in the cases of cochlear disorder, word-recognition ability 
is usually predictable from the degree and slope of the audiogram. 
Although there are some exceptions, such as hearing loss due to 
endolymphatic hydrops, word-recognition ability and perfor-
mance on other forms of speech audiometric measures are highly 
correlated with degree of hearing impairment in certain frequency 
regions. When performance is poorer than expected, the likely cul-
prit is a disorder of the VIIIth nerve or central auditory nervous 
system structures. Thus, unusually poor performance on speech 
audiometric tests lends a measure of suspicion about the site of the 
disorder causing the hearing impairment.
Auditory Processing
Speech audiometric measures also permit us to evaluate the ability 
of the central auditory nervous system to process acoustic signals. 
As neural impulses travel from the cochlea through the VIIIth 
nerve to the auditory brainstem and cortex, the number and com-
plexity of neural pathways expands progressively. The system, in 
its vastness of pathways, includes a certain level of redundancy 
or excess capacity of processing ability. Such redundancy serves 
many useful purposes, but it also makes the function of the cen-
tral auditory nervous system somewhat impervious to our efforts 
to examine it. For example, a patient can have a rather substantial 
lesion of the auditory brainstem or auditory cortex and still have 
normal hearing and normal word-recognition ability. As a result, 
we have to sensitize the speech audiometric measures in some 
way before we can peer into the brain and understand its function 
and disorder.
With the use of advanced speech audiometric measures, we are 
able to measure central auditory nervous system function,  often 
Endolymphatic hydrops 
is the cause of Ménière’s 
disease.

278  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
referred to as auditory processing ability. Such measures are often 
useful diagnostically in helping to identify the presence of neuro-
logic disorder. They are also helpful in that they provide insight 
into a patient’s auditory abilities beyond the level of cochlear pro-
cessing. We are often faced with the question of how a patient will 
hear after a peripheral sensitivity loss has been corrected with 
hearing aids. Estimates of auditory processing ability are useful in 
predicting suprathreshold hearing ability.
Estimating Communicative Function
Speech thresholds tell us about a patient’s hearing sensitivity and, 
thus, what intensity level speech will need to reach to be made 
audible. Word-recognition scores tell us how well speech can be 
recognized once it is made audible. Advanced speech audiometric 
measures tell us how well the auditory nervous system processes 
auditory information at suprathreshold levels. Taken together, 
these speech audiometric measures provide us with a profi le of 
a patient’s communication function. If we know only the pure-
tone thresholds, we can only guess as to the patient’s functional 
impairment. If, on the other hand, we have estimates of the ability 
to understand speech, then we have substantive insight into the 
true ability to hear.
Speech Audiometry Materials
The goal of speech audiometry is to permit the measurement of 
patients’ ability to understand everyday communication. The 
question of whether patients can understand speech seems like 
an easy one, but several factors intervene to complicate the issue.
You might think that the easiest way to assess a person’s speech 
understanding ability would be to determine whether the person 
can understand running speech or continuous discourse. The 
problem with such an assessment lies in the redundancy of infor-
mation contained in continuous speech. There is simply so much 
information in running speech that an adult patient with nearly 
any degree of disorder of the auditory system can extract enough 
of it to understand what is being spoken. On the other hand, you 
might think that the easiest way to assess speech understanding is 
by determining whether a patient can hear the difference between 
two phonemes such as /p/ and /g/. The problem with this type of 
Continuous discourse is 
running speech, such as a 
talker reading a story, used 
primarily as background 
competition.
A phoneme is the smallest 
distinctive class of sounds in 
a language.

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  279
assessment is that there is so little redundancy in the speech target, 
that a patient with even a mild disorder of the auditory system may 
be unable to discriminate between the sounds.
In reality, different types of speech materials are useful for  different 
types of speech audiometric measures. The materials of speech 
audiometry include nonsense syllables, single-syllable or mono-
syllabic words, two-syllable words, sentential approximations, 
sentences, and sentences with key words at the end.
Types of Materials
The materials used in speech audiometry vary from nonsense 
 syllables to complete sentences. Each type of material has unique 
attributes, and most are used in unique ways in the speech audio-
metric assessment.
Nonsense syllables, such as pa, ta, ka, ga, have been used as a 
means of  assessing a patient’s ability to discriminate between 
phonemes of spoken language. Ability to discriminate small dif-
ferences relies on an intact peripheral auditory system, somewhat 
limiting the applicability of such measures clinically, where many 
individuals have disordered peripheral systems.
Single-syllable or monosyllabic words, such as cat, tie, lick, have 
been used extensively in the assessment of word recognition abil-
ity. In fact, the most popular materials for the measurement of 
suprathreshold speech understanding have been monosyllabic 
words, grouped in lists that were designed to be phonetically 
balanced across the speech sounds of  the English language. 
These 50-word lists were compiled during World War II as test 
materials for comparing the speech transmission characteristics 
of aircraft radio receivers and transmitters. The words were se-
lected from various sources and arranged into 50-word lists so 
that all of the sounds of English were represented in their rela-
tive frequency of  occurrence in the language within each list. 
Hence the lists were considered to be phonetically balanced and 
became known as PB lists.
Spondaic words, or spondees, are two-syllable words, such as 
northwest, cowboy, and hotdog, that are used routinely in speech 
Sentential 
approximations are 
contrived nonsense 
sentences, designed to be 
syntactically appropriate but 
meaningless.
Phonetically balanced 
word lists contain speech 
sounds that occur with the 
same frequency as those of 
conversational speech.
Spondaic words are two-
syllable words spoken with 
equal emphasis on 
each syllable.

280  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
audiometric assessment. Spondees can be spoken with equal em-
phasis on both syllables and have the advantage that, with only 
small individual adjustments, can be made homogeneous with 
 respect to audibility. That is, they are all just recognizable at about 
the same speech intensity level.
Sentences and variations of sentence materials are also used as 
speech audiometric measures. For example, the Central Insti-
tute for the Deaf (CID) Everyday Sentences (Silverman & Hirsh, 
1955) is a test that contains 10 sentences per list, with com-
mon sentences varying from 2 to 12 words per sentence. The 
test is scored by calculating the percentage of  key words that 
are recognized correctly. A more modern variation of  the sen-
tence test is the Connected Speech Test (Cox et al., 1987).
A novel procedure employing sentences with variable context is the 
Speech-Perception-in-Noise (SPIN) test (Kalikow et al., 1977; Bilger 
et al., 1984). In this case, the test item is a single word that is the 
last of a sentence. There are two types of sentences, those having 
high predictability in which word identifi cation is aided by context 
(e.g. “They played a game of cat and mouse”) and those having 
low predictability in which context is not as helpful (e.g. “I’m glad 
you heard about the bend”). Sentences are presented to the listener 
against a background of competing multitalker babble. Another 
sentence-based procedure is the Synthetic Sentence Identifi cation 
(SSI) test (Jerger et al., 1968). Artifi cially created, seven-word sen-
tential approximations (e.g., “Agree with him only to fi nd out”) are 
presented to the listener against a competing background of single-
talker continuous discourse.
Redundancy in Hearing
There is a great deal of redundancy associated with our ability to 
hear and process speech communication. Intrinsically, the central 
auditory nervous system has a rich system of anatomic, physi-
ologic, and biochemical overlap. Among other functions, such 
intrinsic redundancy permits multisensory processing and simul-
taneous processing of different auditory signals. Another aspect 
of intrinsic redundancy is that the nervous system can be altered 
substantially by neurologic disorder and still maintain its ability 
to process information.
Multitalker babble is 
a recording of numerous 
people talking at once 
and is used as background 
competition.
Intrinsic redundancy 
is the abundance of 
information present in the 
central auditory system 
due to the excess capacity 
inherent in its richly 
innervated pathways.

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  281
Extrinsically, speech signals contain a wealth of information due 
to phonetic, phonemic, syntactic, and semantic content and 
rules. Such extrinsic redundancy allows us to hear only part of 
a speech segment and still understand what is being said. We are 
capable of perceiving consonants from the coarticulatory effects 
of vowels even when we do not hear the acoustic segments of the 
consonants. We are also capable of perceiving an entire sentence 
from hearing only a few words that are imbedded into a seman-
tic context. Extrinsic redundancy increases as the content of the 
speech signal increases. Thus, a nonsense syllable is least redun-
dant; continuous speech is most redundant. The immunity of 
speech perception to the effects of hearing sensitivity loss varies 
directly with the amount of redundancy of the signal. The rela-
tionship is shown in Figure 7-1. The more redundancy inherent in 
the signal, the more immune that signal is to the effects of hear-
ing loss. Stated another way, perception of speech that has less re-
dundancy is more likely to be affected by the presence of hearing 
loss than is perception of speech with greater redundancy.
The issue of redundancy plays a role in the selection of speech ma-
terials. If you are trying to assess the effects of a cochlear hearing 
impairment on speech perception, then signals that have reduced 
redundancy should be used. Nonsense syllables or monosyllable 
words are sensitive to peripheral hearing impairment and are useful 
in quantifying its effect. Sentential approximations and sentences, 
on the other hand, are not. Redundancy in these materials is simply 
too great to be affected by most degrees of hearing impairment.
Phonetic pertains to an 
individual speech sound.
Phonemic pertains to the 
smallest distinctive class 
of sounds in a language, 
representing the set of 
variations of a speech sound 
that are considered the same 
sound and represented by 
the same symbol.
Syntactic refers to the 
arrangement of words in a 
sentence.
Semantic refers to the 
meaning of words.

information present in the

282  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
If you are trying to assess the effects of a disorder of the central 
auditory nervous system on speech perception, the situation be-
comes more diffi cult. Speech signals of all levels of redundancy 
provide too much information to a central auditory nervous sys-
tem that, itself, has a great deal of redundancy. Even if the intrin-
sic redundancy is reduced by neurologic disorder, the extrinsic 
redundancy of speech may be suffi cient to permit normal process-
ing. The solution to assessing central auditory nervous system 
disorders is to reduce the extrinsic redundancy of the speech infor-
mation enough to reveal the reduced intrinsic redundancy caused 
by neurologic disorder. This concept is shown in Table 7-1. Nor-
mal intrinsic redundancy and normal extrinsic redundancy result 
in normal processing. Reducing the extrinsic redundancy, within 
limits, will have little effect on a system with normal intrinsic re-
dundancy. Similarly, a neurologic disorder that reduces intrinsic 
redundancy will have little impact on perception of speech with 
normal extrinsic redundancy. However, if a system with reduced 
intrinsic redundancy is presented with speech materials that have 
reduced extrinsic redundancy, then the abnormal processing 
caused by the neurologic disorder will be revealed.
To reduce extrinsic redundancy, speech signals must be sensitized 
in some way. Table 7-2 shows some methods for reducing redun-
dancy of test signals. In the frequency domain, speech can be sen-
sitized by removing high frequencies (passing the lows and cutting 
out the highs or low-pass fi ltering), thus limiting the phonetic con-
tent of the speech targets. Speech can also be sensitized in the time 
domain by time compression, a technique that removes segments 
of  speech and compresses the remaining segments to increase

speech rate. In the intensity domain, speech can be presented at 
suffi ciently high levels at which disordered systems cannot seem 
to process effectively. Another very effective way to reduce redun-
dancy of a signal is to present it in a background of competition. 
Yet another way to challenge the central auditory system is to 
present different but similar signals to both ears simultaneously in 
what is referred to as a dichotic measure.
One confounding variable in the measurement of auditory ner-
vous system processing is the presence of cochlear hearing im-
pairment. In such cases, signals that have enhanced redundancy 
need to be used so that hearing sensitivity loss does not interfere 
with interpretation of the measures. That is, you want to use ma-
terials that are not affected by peripheral hearing loss so that you 
can assess processing at higher levels of the system. Nonsense-
syllable perception would be altered by the peripheral hearing 
impairment, and any effects of central nervous system disorder 
would not be revealed. Use of sentences would likely overcome the 
peripheral hearing impairment, but their redundancy would be 
too great to challenge nervous-system processing, even if it is dis-
ordered. The solution is to use highly redundant speech signals to 
overcome the hearing sensitivity loss and then to sensitize those 
materials enough to challenge auditory processing ability.
Other Considerations
Another factor in deciding which speech materials to use is 
whether the measure is open set or closed set in nature. Open-set 
speech materials are those in which the choice of a response is lim-
ited only to the constraints of a language. For example, PB-word 
Open set means the 
choice can be from among 
all available targets in the 
language.

lists are considered open set because the correct answer can be any 
single-syllable word from the English language. Closed-set speech 
materials are those that limit the possible choices. For example, pic-
ture-pointing tasks have been developed, mostly for pediatric test-
ing, wherein the patient has a limited number of foils from which 
to choose the correct answer.
Some speech materials have been designed specifi cally to evaluate 
children’s speech perception. Children’s materials must be 
carefully designed to account for language abilities of children and 
to make the task interesting. Specific target words or sentences 
must be of  a vocabulary level that is appropriate, defined, and 
Closed set means the 
choice is from a limited set; 
multiple choice.
Where I Live: Laurel, Maryland
Where I Work: The Hearing and Speech Center at 
Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C. Wash-
ington Hospital Center is the largest private hospital in the 
nation’s capital. The Hospital Center, a member of  Med-
Star Health, is a 900-bed acute care not-for-profi t hospital. 
The Hearing and Speech Center is a freestanding department 
within the hospital that has a large staff: fi ve audiologists, two 
audiology interns, one PRN audiologist, fi ve speech-language pathologists, six PRN speech-
language pathologists, and three administrative staff members.
What I Do: I am the director of the Hearing and Speech Center. I am responsible for the 
professional, administrative, and fi nancial functions of the department. My time is mostly ad-
ministrative; however, I do see patients two days a week. My clinical work includes performing 
hearing evaluations and various auditory evoked potential measures. I am active in local and 
national professional organizations.
Why Audiology? Audiology is an exciting and fascinating fi eld. I enjoy the interaction 
with patients and family members, as well as working with other health-care professionals 
in order to make a difference in the quality of life for my patients. What could be better and 
more rewarding?

confi ned so that any reduction in performance can be attributable 
to hearing disorder and not to some form of language disorder. 
The task must also hold a child’s interest for a time suffi cient to 
complete testing. Closed-set picture-pointing tasks have been 
developed that effectively address both of these issues.
Clinical Applications of Speech Audiometry
For clinical purposes, speech audiometric measures fall into one 
of four categories:
 1. speech-recognition threshold,
 2. speech-awareness threshold,
 3. word-recognition score, or
 4. sensitized-speech measures.
In a typical clinical situation, a speech threshold (awareness or 
recognition) will be determined early as a cross-check for the va-
lidity of pure-tone thresholds. Following completion of pure-tone 
audiometry, word-recognition scores will be obtained as estimates 
of suprathreshold speech understanding in quiet. Finally, either 
as part of a comprehensive audiological evaluation or as part of 
an advanced speech audiometric battery, sensitized speech mea-
sures will be used to assess processing at the level of the auditory 
nervous system.
Speech-Recognition Threshold
The fi rst threshold measure obtained during an audiological eval-
uation is usually the spondee or speech-recognition threshold, 
also known as the speech reception threshold. The SRT is the low-
est level at which speech can be identifi ed. The main purpose of 
obtaining an SRT is to provide an anchor against which to com-
pare pure-tone thresholds.
The preferred materials for the measurement of  a speech-
recognition threshold are spondaic words. In theory, almost any 
materials could be used, but the spondees have the advantage 
of being homogeneous with respect to audibility, or just audible 
at about the same speech intensity level. This helps greatly in 
establishing a threshold for speech.

286  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
The original spondee words were developed at the Harvard 
Psychoacoustic Laboratory and included 42 words (Hudgins et al., 
1947). The list was later streamlined into 36 words at CID (Hirsh 
et al., 1952) and recorded into the CID W-1 and CID W-2 tests 
that were used for many years. In current clinical practice, a list of 
15 words is commonly used. Table 7-3 lists the 15 spondees that have 
been found to be reasonably homogenous for routine clinical use.
Early recordings of spondee words used a carrier phrase “Say the 
word …” to introduce to the patient that a word was about to be 
presented. Although the use of a carrier phrase remains quite 
common and is recommended for word-recognition testing, it is 
now seldom used in establishing an SRT because it was found to 
have little infl uence on test outcome.
Another clinical practice that has changed over the years is the use 
of monitored live voice for spondee presentation rather than the use 
of recorded materials. Again, although the use of recorded materi-
als is important for word-recognition testing, it has been found to 
have little infl uence on SRT outcome. Because monitored live-voice 
testing is more effi cient than the use of recorded materials, clini-
cians have adopted it as standard practice for determining an SRT.
One other aspect of  speech threshold testing that varies from 
word-recognition testing is that of familiarization with the test 
materials. The goal of  SRT testing is to determine a threshold 
for speech recognition. The use of  words that are equated for 
audibility is one important component of the process. But if one 
word is familiar to a listener and another is less so, audibility is

likely to be infl uenced. One easy way around this issue is simply 
to familiarize the patient with the spondee words before testing 
begins. Familiarization is a common and recommended practice 
in establishing an SRT.
Although every audiologist has a slightly different way of saying 
it, the instructions are essentially these: “The next test is to deter-
mine the lowest level at which you can understand speech. You will be 
hearing some two-syllable words, such as baseball and hotdog. Your job 
is simply to repeat each word. At first these will be at a comfortable 
level so that you become familiar with the words. Then they will start 
getting softer. Keep repeating what you hear no matter how soft they 
become, even if you have to guess at the words.”
The procedure for determining the SRT is essentially one of pre-
senting a series of spondaic words and systematically varying the 
intensity to determine the lowest level at which the patient can 
identify about 50% of the test items. A number of different proce-
dures have been developed and recommended over the years, and 
most of them can be used to establish a valid SRT. Two procedures 
are presented in the accompanying box as examples for you to 
consider for clinical use.
Techniques for Establishing an SRT
Technique A (after Downs & Dickinson Minard, 
1996):
• Familiarize the patient with the spondees.
• Present one spondee at the lowest attenua-
tor setting (or 30 dB below an SRT established 
during a previous evaluation). Ascend in 10 dB 
steps, presenting one word at each level, until 
the patient responds correctly.
• Descend 15 dB.
• Present up to ﬁ ve spondees until: (a) the patient 
misses three spondees, after which you should 
ascend 5 dB and try again; or (b) the patient 
ﬁ rst repeats two spondees correctly. This level is 
the SRT.

Clinical Note

288  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
An important clinical value of  this SRT is that it should agree 
closely with the pure-tone thresholds averaged across 500, 1000, 
and 2000 Hz. If both the pure-tone intensity levels and the speech 
intensity levels are expressed on a hearing level (HL) decibel scale, 
then the degree of hearing loss for speech should agree with the 
degree of hearing loss for pure tones in the 500 through 2000 Hz 
region. In clinical practice, the SRT and the PTA should be in fairly 
close agreement, differing by no more than ± 6 dB. If, for example, 
the SRT is 45 dB, the PTA should be at some level between 39 and 
51 dB. If there is a larger discrepancy between the two numbers, 
then one or the other is probably an invalid measure.
Speech Detection Threshold
A speech detection threshold (SDT), sometimes referred to as 
speech awareness threshold, is the lowest level at which a patient 
can just detect the presence of a speech signal. Determination of 
SDT is usually not a routine part of the audiometric evaluation 
and is used only when an SRT cannot be established.
An SDT is determined in place of  an SRT in patients who do 
not have the language competency to identify spondaic words, 
especially in young children who have not yet developed the

Technique B (after Huff & Nerbonne, 1982).
• Familiarize the patient with the spondees.
• Present one spondee at a level approximately 
30 dB above estimated threshold. If the patient 
does not respond correctly, increase the inten-
sity by 20 dB. If the patient responds correctly, 
decrease the level by 10 dB.
• Continue to present one word until the patient 
does not respond correctly. At this level, present 
up to ﬁ ve words. If the patient identiﬁ es fewer 
than three words, increase the level by 5 dB. If 
the patient identiﬁ es three words, decrease the 
level by 5 dB.
• Threshold is the lowest intensity level at which 
three out of ﬁ ve words are identiﬁ ed correctly.

vocabulary to identify words or pictures representing words. 
It may also be necessary to establish SDTs rather than SRTs in 
patients who do not speak a language for which spondees have 
been recorded or in patients who have lost language function due 
to a cerebrovascular accident or other neurologic insult.
Speech detection threshold testing is carried out in a manner 
similar to pure-tone threshold testing. When testing younger pa-
tients, procedural adaptations need to be made and are discussed 
in greater detail in Chapter 10.
The SDT is established by presenting some form of  speech. 
Commonly used speech signals include familiar words, connected 
speech, spondaic words, or even repeated nonsense syllables, such 
as “ba ba ba ba ba.” As with SRT measure, the use of monitored 
live voice for speech presentation rather than the use of recorded 
materials has been found to have little infl uence on SDT outcome. 
Because monitored live-voice testing is more efficient than the 
use of recorded materials, clinicians have adopted it as standard 
practice for determining an SDT.
The procedure for determining the SDT is one of  presenting 
the speech target and systematically varying the intensity to 
determine the lowest level at which the patient can just detect 
the speech. The most common clinical procedure is a descending 
technique similar to that used in pure-tone threshold testing:
Present a speech signal at a level at which the patient can 
• 
clearly hear. If normal hearing is anticipated, begin testing 
at 40 dB HL.
If the patient does not respond, increase the intensity level 
• 
by 20 dB until a response occurs. Once the patient responds, 
threshold search begins.
Follow the “down 10, up 5” rule by decreasing the intensity 
• 
by 10 dB after each response and increasing the intensity by 
5 dB after each no-response.
Threshold is considered to be the lowest level at which the 
• 
patient responds to speech about 50% of the time.
The important clinical value of the SDT is that it should agree 
closely with the best pure-tone threshold within the audiometric 
frequency range. For example, if the best pure-tone threshold is 

290  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
at 0 dB at 250 Hz, then the SDT should be around 0 dB. Or, if the 
best pure-tone threshold is 25 dB at 1000 Hz, then the SDT should 
be approximately 25 dB. Because speech is composed of a broad 
spectrum of frequencies, speech detection thresholds will refl ect 
hearing at the frequencies with the best sensitivity.
The SDT will occur at a lower intensity level than the SRT, because 
the SDT depends on audibility alone, whereas the SRT requires 
that a patient both hear and identify the speech signal. Threshold 
of detection can be expected to be approximately 5 to 10 dB better 
than threshold of recognition.
Word Recognition
The most common way that we describe suprathreshold hearing 
ability is with word-recognition measures. Word-recognition test-
ing, also referred to as speech discrimination, word discrimina-
tion, and PB-word testing, is an assessment of a patient’s ability 
to identify and repeat single-syllable words presented at some su-
prathreshold level.
The words used for word-recognition testing are contained in lists 
of 50 items that are phonetically balanced with respect to the 
relative frequency of occurrence of phonemes in the language. 
 Raymond Carhart, one of the early pioneers of audiologic evalua-
tion, adapted these so-called PB lists to audiologic testing. He rea-
soned that if you fi rst established the threshold for speech, the SRT, 
then presented a PB list at a level 25 dB above the SRT, the percent 
correct word repetition for a PB list would tell you something about 
how well the individual could understand speech in that ear. This 
measure, the PB score at a constant suprathreshold level, came 
to be called the discrimination score, on the assumption that it was 
proportional to the individual’s ability to “discriminate” among the 
individual sounds of speech. This basic speech audiometric para-
digm, a percent-correct score at a defi ned sensational level above 
the SRT, formed the framework for audiologic and aural rehabilita-
tion procedures that remain in use today.
Materials
The fi rst monosyllabic word lists used clinically were those devel-
oped at the Harvard Psychoacoustics Laboratory (PAL). They were

threshold.

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  291
called the PAL PB-50 test (Egan, 1948). These 20 lists of 50 words 
each were designed to be phonetically balanced within each list. 
The PAL PB-50 test served as the precursor for materials used to-
day. Subsequent modifi cations of the original PB lists include the 
CID W-22 test (Hirsh et al., 1952) and the NU-6 test (Tillman & 
Carhart, 1966).
The CID W-22 word lists were designed to try to improve the materials 
by using words that were more familiar and more representative of 
the phonetic content of spoken English. The W-22 test contains 
four 50-word lists that are arranged in six different randomizations. 
The Northwestern University Auditory Test Number 6, or NU-6 
test, was developed using consonant-nucleus-consonant (CNC) 
words. Four lists of 50 words each were used based on the notion 
of phonemic balance rather than phonetic balance. The idea here 
was that the lists should represent the spoken phonemes or groups 
of speech sounds in the language, rather than all of the individual 
phonetic variations.
A number of other word-list materials have been developed over 
the years in an effort to refi ne word-recognition testing. Despite 
these efforts, however, the W-22 and especially the NU-6 lists 
 enjoy the most widespread clinical use.
Procedural Considerations
Most recordings for word-recognition testing use a carrier phrase 
“Say the word …” to introduce to the patient that a word is about 
to be presented. The use of a carrier phrase remains quite com-
mon and is recommended for word-recognition testing as it has 
been found to have an infl uence on test outcome.
One of the most important considerations in word-recognition 
testing is the use of  recorded materials. Although monitored 
live-voice testing is more efficient than the use of  recorded 
materials and enjoys widespread clinical acceptance as a 
result, the advantages of  using recorded speech are numerous 
and important. Perhaps most importantly, interpretation of 
word-recognition testing outcome is based on results from 
data collected with recorded materials. Diagnostically, word-
recognition testing is carried out as a matter of routine for the 

292  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
times when results are not predictable or signifi cant changes in 
functioning have occurred. In both cases, the underlying cause 
of the result may signal health concerns that alert the audiologist 
to make appropriate medical referrals. The fi rst question, then, 
is whether results are predictable from the degree of  hearing 
loss. For example, is a score of  68% normal for a patient with 
a moderate hearing loss? This can be assessed by comparing 
the score to published data for patients with known cochlear 
hearing loss. If  the score falls within the expected range, then 
it is consistent with degree of  hearing loss. If  not, then there 
is reason for concern that the underlying cause of the disorder 
is retrocochlear in nature. These published data are based on 
standard recordings of word-recognition tests, and comparisons 
to scores obtained with live-voice testing are not valid. A similar 
problem occurs when observing changes in performance. On 
many occasions as an audiologist, you will encounter patients 
who are being monitored for one reason or another. The question 
is often whether the patient is getting worse. If  you encounter 
a signifi cant decline on recorded speech measures, you can be 
fairly confident that a real change has occurred. If  the same 
decline is noted on live-voice testing, you will have no basis for 
making a decision. There are other advantages to the use of 
recorded materials that relate to inter-patient and inter-clinic 
comparisons. As a result, recorded word-recognition testing has 
become an important audiologic standard of care.
Another important procedural consideration is presentation 
level. Early in the development of  word-recognition testing as 
a clinical tool, the choice of an intensity level to carry out test-
ing was based on the performance of normal-hearing listeners. 
Data from groups of subjects with normal hearing showed that, 
by 25–40 dB above the SRT, most subjects achieved 100% word 
recognition. As a result, the early clinical standard was to test 
patients at 40 dB sensation level or 40 dB above the pure-tone 
average or SRT. Over the years, this notion of testing at 40 dB SL 
began to be questioned as clinicians realized that the audibility 
of speech signals varied with both degree and confi guration of 
hearing loss. If a patient has a fl at hearing loss in both ears, then 
the parts of speech that are audible to the listener are equal for 
both ears at 40 dB SL. If, however, one ear has a fl at loss and the 

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  293
other a sloping hearing loss, the one with the sloping loss is at a 
disadvantage in terms of the speech signals that are audible to 
that ear, and the word-recognition score would be poorer for that 
ear. In this case, the differences between scores from one ear to 
the other could be accounted for on the basis of the audiometric 
confi guration, and little is learned diagnostically.
Modern clinical practice has largely abandoned the notion of 
equating the ears by using equal SL, or even equating the ears 
using comfort level. Instead these strategies have been replaced 
with the practice of testing and comparing ears at equal SPL and 
in searching for the maximum word-recognition scores at high-
intensity levels. The notion is a simple one. If the best or maximum 
score is obtained from both ears, then intensity level is removed 
from the interpretation equation. Maximum scores can then be 
compared between ears and to normative data to see if they are 
acceptable for the degree of hearing loss.
This thinking has led to an exploration of  speech recognition 
across the patient’s dynamic range of  hearing rather than 
at just a single suprathreshold intensity level (Jerger & Jerger, 
1971). The goal in doing so is to determine a maximum score, 
regardless of  test level. To obtain a maximum score, lists of 
words or sentences are presented at three to five different in-
tensity levels, extending from just above the speech thresh-
old to the upper level of  comfortable listening. In this way, a 
 performance-intensity function is generated for each ear. The 
shape of this function often has diagnostic signifi cance. Figure 7-2 
shows examples of  PI functions. In most cases, the PI function 
rises systematically as speech intensity is increased, to an as-
ymptotic level representing the best speech recognition that 
can be achieved in that ear. In some cases, however, there is a 
paradoxical rollover effect, in which the function declines sub-
stantially as speech intensity increases beyond the level produc-
ing the maximum performance score. In other words, as speech 
intensity level increases, performance rises to a maximum level 
then declines or “rolls over” sharply as intensity increases. This 
rollover effect is commonly observed when the site of  hearing 
loss is retrocochlear, in the auditory nerve or the auditory path-
ways in the brainstem.
Performance-intensity 
function (PI function) is a 
graph of percentage-correct 
speech recognition scores 
plotted as a function of 
presentation level of the 
target signals.
Rollover is a decrease in 
speech recognition ability 
with increasing intensity 
level.

294  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
The use of  PI functions is a way of  sensitizing speech by chal-
lenging the auditory system at high-intensity levels. Because of 
its ease of administration, many audiologists use it routinely as 
a screening measure for retrocochlear disorders. The most ef-
fi cacious clinical strategy is to present a word list at the high-
est intensity level (usually 80 dB HL). If the patient scores 80%, 
then potential rollover of  the function is minimal, and testing 
can be terminated. If  the patient scores below 80%, then roll-
over could occur, and the function is completed by testing at 
lower intensity levels.
Other modifi cations of word-recognition testing involve the use of 
half lists of 25 words each or the use of lists that are rank-ordered 
in terms of diffi culty. Both of these modifi cations are designed to 
enhance the effi ciency of word-recognition testing. They are prob-
ably best reserved for rapid assessment of those patients with nor-
mal performance.
Procedure
Although every audiologist has a slightly different way of saying it, 
the instructions are essentially these: “You will now be hearing some 
single-syllable words following the phrase, ‘Say the word.’ For example,

you will hear, ‘Say the word book.’ Your job is simply to repeat the fi nal 
word ‘book.’ If you are not sure of the word, please make a guess at what 
you heard.”
The procedure for determining the word-recognition score is quite 
simple. Once a level has been chosen, the list of words is presented. 
The audiologist then scores each response as correct or incorrect. 
The word-recognition score is then calculated as the percentage 
correct score. For example, if a 50-word list is presented and the 
patient misses 10 words, then the score is 40 out of 50 or 80% 
correct. Testing is then completed in the other ear.
Interpretation
Interpretation of word-recognition measures is based on the pre-
dictable relation of maximum word-recognition scores to degree 
of hearing loss (Yellin et al., 1989; Dubno et al., 1995). If the 
maximum score falls within a given range for a given degree of 
hearing loss, then the results are considered to be within expecta-
tion for a cochlea hearing loss. If the score is poorer than expected, 
then word-recognition ability is considered to be abnormal for the 
degree of hearing loss and consistent with retrocochlear disorder. 
Table 7-4 can be used to determine whether a score exceeds ex-
pectations based on degree of hearing loss, in this case the PTA or 
pure-tone average of thresholds at 500,1000, and 2000 Hz. The 
number represents the lowest maximum score that 95% of indi-
viduals with hearing loss will obtain on this particular measure, 
the 25-item NU-6 word lists. Any score below this number for a 
given hearing loss is considered to be abnormal.
Sensitized Speech Measures
Some problems in speech understanding appear to be based not 
on the distortions introduced by peripheral hearing loss, but on 
defi cits resulting from disorders in the auditory pathways within 
the central nervous system. Revealing these disorders relies on the 
use of sensitized speech materials that reduce the extrinsic redun-
dancy of the signal. Although redundancy can be reduced by low-
pass fi ltering or time compression, these methods have not proven 
to be clinically useful because of their susceptibility to the effects 
of cochlear hearing loss. Perhaps the most successfully used sensi-
tized speech measures are those in which competition is presented

the auditory system.
There are any number of measures of speech-in-noise that have 
been developed over the years, among them, for example, the SPIN 
and HINT. The SPIN, or Speech-Perception-in-Noise Test (Kalikow 
et al., 1977), has as its target a single word that is the last in a sen-
tence. In half of the sentences, the word is predictable from the con-
text of the sentence; in the other half the word is not predictable. 
These signals are presented in a background of multitalker com-
petition. The HINT, or Hearing in Noise Test (Nilsson et al., 1994),

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  297
uses sentence targets and an adaptive paradigm to determine the 
threshold for speech recognition in the presence of background 
competition. These and numerous other measures are useful in as-
sessing speech recognition in competition.
One measure of suprathreshold ability that has stood the test of 
time is the SSI, or Synthetic Sentence Identifi cation Test (Jerger 
et al., 1968). The SSI uses sentential approximations that are 
presented in a closed-set format. The patient is asked to identify 
the sentence from a list of  ten. Sentences are presented in the 
presence of single-talker competition. Testing typically is carried 
out with the signal and the competition at the same intensity 
level, a message-to-competition ratio of 0 dB. The SSI has some 
advantages inherent in its design. First, because it uses sentence 
materials, it is relatively immune to hearing loss. Said another 
way, the infl uence of mild degrees of hearing loss on identifi ca-
tion of  these sentences is minimal, and the effect of  more se-
vere hearing loss on absolute scores is known. Second, it uses 
a closed-set response, thereby permitting practice that reduces 
learning effects and ensures that a patient’s performance defi cits 
are not task related. Third, the single-talker competition, which 
has no infl uence on recognition scores of those with normal au-
ditory ability, can be quite interfering to sentence perception in 
those with auditory processing disorders. Reduced performance 
on the SSI has been reported in patients with brainstem disor-
ders and in the aging population.
Another effective approach for assessing auditory processing abil-
ity is the use of dichotic tests. In the dichotic paradigm, two differ-
ent speech targets are presented simultaneously to the two ears. 
The patient’s task is usually either to repeat back both targets in 
either order or to report only the word heard in the precued ear. In 
this latter case, the right ear is precued on half the trials and the 
left on the other half. Two scores are determined, one for targets 
correctly identifi ed from the right ear, the other for targets cor-
rectly identifi ed from the left ear. The patterns of results can reveal 
auditory processing defi cits, especially those due to disorders of 
the temporal lobe and corpus callosum.
Dichotic tests have been constructed using nonsense syllables 
 (Berlin et al., 1972) and digits (Musiek, 1983). Although valuable

measures in patients with normal hearing, interpretation can 
be difficult in patients with significant hearing sensitivity loss. 
Two other tests that have enjoyed widespread use over the years 
are the Staggered Spondaic Word (SSW) test (Katz, 1962) and 
the Dichotic Sentence Identifi cation (DSI) test (Fifer et al., 1983). 
The SSW is a test in which a different spondaic word is presented 
to each ear, with the second syllable of the word presented to the 
leading ear overlapping in time with the fi rst syllable of the word 
presented to the lagging ear. Thus, the leading ear is presented with 
one syllable in isolation (noncompeting), followed by one syllable in 
a dichotic mode (competing). The lagging ear begins with the fi rst 
syllable presented in the dichotic mode and fi nishes with the second 
syllable presented in isolation. The right ear serves as the leading ear 
for half of the test presentations. Error scores are calculated for each 
ear in both the competing and noncompeting modes. A correction 
can be applied to account for hearing sensitivity loss. Abnormal SSW 
performance has been reported in patients with brainstem, corpus 
callosum, and temporal lobe lesions. The DSI test uses synthetic 
sentences from the SSI test, aligned for presentation in the dichotic 
mode. The response is closed set, and the subject’s task is to identify 
the sentences from among a list on a response card. The DSI was 
designed in an effort to overcome the infl uence of hearing sensitivity 
loss on test interpretation and was found to be applicable for use in 
ears with a pure-tone average of up to 50 dB HL and asymmetry 
of up to 40 dB. Abnormal DSI results have been reported in aging 
patients.
Speech Recognition and Site of Lesion
Speech audiometric measures can be useful in predicting where 
the site of lesion might be for a given hearing loss. A summary is 
presented in Table 7-5.
If  a hearing loss is conductive due to middle-ear disorder, the 
effect on speech recognition will be negligible, except to elevate 
the SRT by the degree of hearing loss in the ear with the disorder. 
Suprathreshold speech recognition will not be affected.
If a hearing loss is sensorineural due to cochlear disorder, the SRT 
will be elevated in that ear to a degree predictable by the pure-
tone average. Suprathreshold word-recognition scores will be 
predictable from the degree of hearing sensitivity loss. Sensitized 
Staggered spondaic 
words are used in tests of 
dichotic listening, in which 
two spondaic words are 
presented so that the second 
syllable delivered to one ear 
is heard simultaneously with 
the ﬁ rst syllable delivered to 
the other ear.

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  299
speech measures will be normal or predictable from degree of 
loss. Dichotic measures will be normal. One exception is in the 
case of endolymphatic hydrops or Ménière’s disease, in which the 
cochlear disorder causes such distortion that word-recognition 
scores are poorer than predicted from degree of hearing loss.
If a hearing loss is sensorineural due to an VIIIth nerve lesion, the 
SRT will be elevated in that ear to a degree predictable by the pure-
tone average. Suprathreshold word-recognition ability is likely to 
be substantially affected. Maximum scores are likely to be poorer 
than predicted from the degree of hearing loss, and rollover of 
the performance-intensity function is likely to occur. Speech-in-
competition measures are also likely to be depressed. Abnormal 
results will occur in the same, or ipsilateral, ear in which the lesion 
occurs. Dichotic measures will be normal.
If a hearing disorder occurs as a result of a brainstem lesion, the 
SRT will be predictable from the pure-tone average. Suprathresh-
old word-recognition ability is likely to be affected substantially. 
Word-recognition scores in quiet may be normal, or they may be 
depressed or show rollover. Speech-in-competition measures are 
likely to be depressed in the ear ipsilateral to the lesion. Dichotic 
measures will likely be normal.
If a hearing disorder occurs as the result of a temporal lobe lesion, 
hearing sensitivity is unlikely to be affected, and the SRT and word 
recognition scores are likely to be normal. Speech-in-competition 
measures may or may not be abnormal in the ear contralateral to 
the lesion. Dichotic measures are the most likely of all to show a 
defi cit due to the temporal lobe lesion.

300  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
Predicting Speech Recognition
As you learned earlier, word-recognition ability is predictable from 
the audiogram in most patients. This has been known for many 
years. Essentially, speech recognition can be predicted based on 
the amount of speech signal that is audible to a patient. The origi-
nal calculations for making this prediction resulted in what was 
referred to as an articulation index, a number between 0 and 
1.0 that described the proportion of the average speech signal 
that would be audible to a patient based on his or her audiogram 
(French & Steinberg, 1947).
Over the years, the concept and clinical techniques have evolved 
into the measurement that is now referred to as the audibility in-
dex, refl ecting its intended purpose of expressing the amount of 
speech signal that is audible to a patient. From the audibility index 
(AI), an estimate can be made of recognition scores for syllables, 
words, and sentences.
The audibility index is a measure of the proportion of speech cues 
that are audible. The AI is usually expressed as the proportion, 
between 0 and 1.0, of the average speech signal that is audible 
to a given listener. Calculations for determination of  the AI 
are based on dividing the speech signal into frequency bands, 
with various weightings attributed to each band based on their 
likely contribution to the ability to hear speech. For example, 
consonant sounds are predominantly higher frequency sounds, 
and because their audibility is so important to understanding 
speech, the higher frequencies are weighted more heavily in the 
AI calculation.
The concept of audibility of average speech has not had much im-
pact clinically, where word-recognition testing has prevailed as a 
means of estimating the ability to recognize speech. Among prob-
lems with clinical use of the AI is that it is not well understood, 
and it has been rather cumbersome to calculate.
Some simplified ways to calculate audibility have made the AI 
much more accessible clinically (Pavlovic, 1988; Mueller & 
 Killion, 1990). One method is known clinically as the count-the-
dots procedure. An illustration of  a count-the-dots audiogram 
Articulation index is also 
known as audibility index 
and speech intelligibility 
index.

form is shown in Figure 7-3A. Here the weighting of frequency 
components by intensity is shown as the number of dots in the 
range on the audiogram.
Calculating AI from this audiogram is simple. Figure 7-3B shows 
a patient’s audiogram superimposed on the count-the-dots audio-
gram. Those components of average speech that are below (or at 
higher intensity levels than) the audiogram are audible to the pa-
tient, and those that are above are not. To calculate the AI, simply 
count the dots that are audible to the patient. In this case, the AI is 
60 (or 0.6). This essentially means that 60% of average speech is 
audible to the patient.
The AI has at least three useful clinical applications. First, it can 
serve as an excellent counseling tool for explaining to a patient 
the impact of hearing loss on the ability to understand speech. 
Second, the AI has a known relationship to word-recognition abil-
ity. Thus word-recognition scores can be predicted from the AI or, 
if measured directly, can be compared to expected scores based on 
the AI. Third, the AI can be useful in hearing aid fi tting in serv-
ing as a metric of how much average speech is made audible by a 
given hearing aid.
The strategy of using the AI to describe communication impair-
ment is a useful one. In many ways, the idea of audibility of speech 
information is a more useful way of describing the impact of a 
hearing loss than the percentage correct score on single-syllable 
word-recognition measures.
OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
A number of  other behavioral measures are used for various 
purposes in the audiologic evaluation. For example, you will 
learn in Chapter 10 about some behavioral techniques that 
are useful in identifying and quantifying hearing loss that is 
functional, or exaggerated. In addition, a number of behavioral 
measures have been used over the years diagnostically in an 
effort to contribute information about the site of  an auditory 
disorder.

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  303
Traditional Site-of-Lesion Measures
One special class of behavioral measures is important to be aware 
of from an historic perspective. Prior to the discovery of the objec-
tive measures that you will learn about in Chapters 8 and 9 and 
prior to the development of modern imaging and radiographic 
techniques, a battery of psychophysical measures was used to dif-
ferentiate cochlear from retrocochlear disorder. This has become 
known as the classic test battery, and it is based primarily on mea-
sures of auditory adaptation and recruitment (Jerger, 1987).
Recall from Chapter 3 that one of the consequences of cochlear 
hearing loss is recruitment, or abnormal loudness growth. That is, 
loudness grows more rapidly than normal at intensity levels just 
above threshold in an ear with cochlear site of disorder. Clinically 
this means that if recruitment is present, then the site of disor-
der is cochlear rather than retrocochlear. Two measures, loudness 
balancing and difference limen for intensity, were used to assess 
recruitment as part of the classic test battery.
One popular measure of recruitment was the alternate binaural 
loudness balance (ABLB) test. The ABLB was designed to be used in 
patients with unilateral hearing loss. To carry out the ABLB test, 
the same tone is presented alternately between ears. The intensity 
level in the impaired ear is fi xed at a level above threshold of 20 dB 
SL. The patient’s task is to adjust the level of the normal hearing 
ear until the sounds in the two ears are of equal loudness. The 
intensity level in the impaired ear is then increased by 10 or 20 dB 
and the loudness matching is repeated. The ABLB is interpreted 
by assessing the nature of loudness differences at high-intensity 
levels. If the perception of loudness is at the same intensity level 
(in HL or SPL) for both ears, then complete recruitment occurred in 
the impaired ear, because the loudness caught up to the normal 
ear at high levels. This finding is consistent with cochlear site 
of  disorder. In cases of  retrocochlear disorder, the opposite, or 
decruitment, might occur. Here the loudness in the impaired ear 
grows more slowly than in the normal ear.
The measurement of difference limen for intensity was another 
method used to take advantage of the recruitment phenomenon. 

304  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
The clinical measure was known as the Short Increment Sensitivity 
Index (SISI). To carry out the SISI test, a constant tone is presented 
to the ear at 20 dB SL. Superimposed on that tone is a series of 20 
increments of 1 dB. The patient’s task is to count the number of 
increments that are perceived. A patient with cochlear hearing 
loss can perceive those increments, whereas a patient with 
retrocochlear site of disorder cannot. One successful modifi cation 
of the SISI involves the presentation of the signal at a high level, 
75 dB HL or 20 dB SL, whichever is higher. A positive SISI, in 
which 70 to 100% of the increments are identifi ed, is consistent 
with cochlear hearing loss or normal hearing. A negative SISI, in 
which only 0 to 30% of the increments are identifi ed, is consistent 
with retrocochlear site.
You may also recall from Chapter 3 that one of the consequences 
of retrocochlear hearing loss is abnormal auditory adaptation. The 
normal auditory system tends to adapt to ongoing sound, espe-
cially at near-threshold levels, so that, as adaptation occurs, an 
audible signal becomes inaudible. At higher intensity levels, ongo-
ing sound tends to remain audible without adaptation. However, 
in an ear with retrocochlear disorder, the audibility may diminish 
rapidly due to excessive auditory adaptation even at higher inten-
sity levels.
Two popular measures of adaptation from the classic test battery 
are the tone decay test (TDT) and diagnostic Békésy audiometry.
The tone decay test is essentially a measure of the intensity level at 
which the perception of a tone can be sustained for 60 seconds. 
In its original form, a tone is presented at 5 dB SL, and the pa-
tient is asked to respond for as long as it is audible. If the patient 
responds for 60 seconds, testing is stopped. If not, the intensity 
level is increased by 5 dB and the process repeated. Tone decay is 
quantifi ed in dB as the fi nal test level minus the threshold level. 
Tone decay is considered positive for retrocochlear disorder if it 
exceeds 30 dB.
One modifi cation of the tone decay test that is still sometimes use-
ful today is the suprathreshold adaptation test (STAT). The STAT is 
carried out by presenting a tone at 110 dB SPL and determining 
if patient can hear it for 60 seconds. If not, adaptation occurred, 

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  305
consistent with retrocochlear disorder. The STAT test is useful as 
a screening measure for retrocochlear disorder in patients with 
hearing loss severe enough to preclude testing with objective au-
diometric measures.
Another way to measure auditory adaptation is with diagnostic 
Békésy audiometry. Békésy audiometry is an automated form of 
hearing sensitivity assessment in which the patient controls the 
attenuation of the signal. By pushing a button, the patient in-
creases intensity of the signal until it is audible. The patient then 
releases the button until the signal is inaudible, presses it until it 
is audible again, releases it, presses it, and so on. These tracking re-
sponses are displayed on a computer screen or plotter, and thresh-
old is calculated as the midpoint of the excursion between audible 
and inaudible. While the tracking occurs, the frequency of the 
signal is slowly swept from low to high, so that an audiogram is 
measured across the frequency range.
In diagnostic Békésy audiometry, both continuous (C) and inter-
rupted (I) tones are presented. If adaptation occurs, it will affect 
the continuous tone but not the interrupted tone. Results fall into 
one of 5 classic types. Békésy Type I, in which the I and C tracings 
are overlapped, is consistent with cochlear site of disorder, as is 
Békésy Type II, in which the C tracing is only slightly worse than 
the I tracing. Békésy Type III, in which the C tracing drops off the 
graph due to adaptation to the continuous signal, is consistent 
with retrocochlear site of disorder. So is Békésy Type IV, in which 
the C tracing is more that 20 dB below the I tracing. In Békésy 
Type V, the I tracing is poorer than the C tracing, indicating that 
the patient is probably exaggerating a hearing loss.
All of these measures, ABLB, SISI, TDT, and Békésy audiometry, 
were useful in the diagnosis of  retrocochlear site in the days 
when tumors or other disorders had to reach a substantial size 
before they could be diagnosed radiographically. As imaging and 
radiographic techniques improved, smaller lesions that had less 
functional impact on the auditory system could be visualized, 
and the sensitivity of the classic test battery diminished. Today, 
these measures are relegated mostly to history, although, as 
noted above, results can occasionally be useful in patients with 
severe hearing loss.

306  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
Masking Level Difference
One behavioral diagnostic measure that has stood the test of time 
is a measure of lower brainstem function known as the masking 
level difference (MLD). The MLD measures binaural release from 
masking due to interaural phase relationships (Licklider, 1948). 
The binaural auditory system is an exquisite detector of differ-
ences in timing of sound reaching the two ears. This helps in lo-
calizing low-frequency sounds, which reach the ears at different 
points in time. An illustration may help you to understand how 
sensitive the ears are to these timing, or phase, cues. Suppose that 
identical low-frequency tones are presented to both of your ears 
and those tones are adjusted so that the phase is identical. Enough 
noise is then added to both ears to mask the tones. If the phase of 
the tone delivered to one earphone is then reversed, the tone will 
becomes audible again. This is called binaural release from masking, 
and it occurs as a result of processing in the brainstem at the level 
of the superior olivary complex.
The MLD test is the clinical strategy designed to measure binaural 
release from masking. To carry out the MLD, a 500 Hz interrupted 
tone is split and presented in phase to both ears. Narrow band noise 
is also presented, at a fixed level of 60 dB HL. Using the Békésy 
tracking procedure, threshold for the in-phase tones is determined 
in the presence of the noise. Then the phase of one of the tones is 
reversed, and threshold is tracked again. The MLD is the difference 
in threshold between the in-phase and the out-of-phase conditions. 
For a 500 Hz tone, the MLD should be greater than 7 dB and is 
usually around 12 dB.
The binaural masking level difference is often abnormal in pa-
tients with multiple sclerosis or other disorders that affect the 
auditory brainstem processing of phase differences between ears 
(Olsen et al., 1976). The MLD is not affected by disorders at the 
level of the auditory cortex.
Pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and these other proce-
dures constitute the basic behavioral measures available to quantify 
hearing impairment and determine the type and site of auditory 
disorder. In the next chapters, you will learn about the objective 
measures that are used for the same purposes.

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  307
Summary
Speech audiometric measures are used to measure threshold 
• 
for speech, to cross-check pure-tone sensitivity, to quantify su-
prathreshold speech-recognition ability, to assist in differential 
diagnosis, to assess auditory processing ability, and to estimate 
communicative function.
The goal of speech audiometry is to measure patients’ ability to 
• 
understand everyday communication.
Different types of speech materials are useful for different types 
• 
of speech audiometric measures. The materials used in speech 
audiometry vary from nonsense syllables to complete sentences.
Speech audiometric measures fall into one of four outcome cate-
• 
gories: speech-recognition thresholds, speech awareness thresh-
olds, word-recognition scores, and sensitized speech measures.
The fi rst threshold measure obtained during an audiological eval-
• 
uation is usually the spondee or speech-recognition threshold.
A speech detection threshold, sometimes referred to as speech 
• 
awareness threshold, is the lowest level at which a patient can 
just detect the presence of a speech signal.
The most common way to describe suprathreshold hearing 
• 
ability is with word-recognition measures. Sensitized speech 
audiometric measures are used to quantify deficits resulting 
from disorders in the central auditory pathways.
Speech audiometric measures can be useful in predicting where 
• 
the site of lesion might be for a given hearing loss.
Other behavioral measures are also helpful in diagnostic audi-
• 
ology. Special tests of auditory adaptation and recruitment can 
contribute to the identifi cation of cochlear and retrocochlear 
disorders. Binaural release from masking can be used to assess 
brainstem disorder.

 2. A speech 
 
 or speech 
 
 is the lowest level at which speech can be detected.

308  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
 3. The speech-recognition threshold is the 
 level at 
which speech can be 
.
 4. The 
 - 
 
 is the average 
of the threshold levels for the 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz 
frequencies.
 5. The 
 
 
 is the percentage of 
correct repetitions of single-syllable words at a fi xed intensity 
level above threshold. It provides an estimate of 
 
ability to recognize speech.
 6. If the word-recognition score is 
 than expected, 
this may be consistent with retrocochlear disorder or 
 cochlear distortion.
 7. Speech audiometry is most often used as a measure of 
 function. Speech 
 measures demon-
strate what intensity level is needed for speech to be audible. 
Word- 
 scores demonstrate how well speech can 
be recognized, once made audible. Advanced speech audio-
metric measures demonstrate how the auditory nervous 
system 
 auditory information at suprathreshold 
levels.
 8. Single-syllable words, also called 
, are generally 
used to measure speech 
. Word lists containing 
these materials are 
 
 (PB) word lists. 
This means that the lists contain speech sounds that oc-
cur with the same frequency of occurrence as those speech 
sounds in 
 speech.
 9. Speech thresholds are generally determined using two-
syllable words. When these words have equal stress on both 
syllables, they are known as 
.
 10. Sentence speech audiometry materials may have either or 
both high 
 or 
 predictability of target 
words.
 11. Sentence speech audiometry materials may be presented in 
quiet, or against a 
 message such as multitalker 
babble. The level of the signal compared to the level of the com-
petition is known at the 
 -to- 
 ratio.
 12. Sentence materials may also be 
 sentences, 
which do not have meaning. These types of materials, 

CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES  309
such as the Synthetic Sentence 
 test, provide 
 measures of speech recognition without the listener’s use of 
linguistic 
.
 13. Methods of reducing 
 redundancy, such as 
frequency fi ltering, time  
, high-level testing, 
speech-in-noise testing, and dichotic measures are used to 
assess central auditory nervous system disorders.
 14. A different, but similar, signal presented to both ears simul-
taneously is known as a 
 listening condition.
 15. Response sets for speech audiometry materials may be 
 set, where the response set is all available tar-
gets in a language, or 
 set, where the response 
set is limited to choices provided.
 16. Speech 
 threshold measures may be used 
in cases where there is a lack of language competency. 
These thresholds are typically 5-10 dB better than speech- 
 thresholds.
 17. The use of a 
 phrase, such as “Say the word…,” 
is shown to improve word-recognition scores.
 18. The use of 
 materials is preferred over moni-
tored live-voice presentation of speech audiometry ma-
terials. Because speech audiometry materials are often 
compared over time, recorded materials provide 
, 
which is not available with monitored live-voice testing.
 19. The 
/
 (PI) function is a plot of word-
recognition scores as a function of presentation intensity 
level. The shape of the PI function may have diagnostic 
signifi cance.
 20. When speech recognition decreases from maximum score at 
higher intensity, 
 
 is said to occur. This 
phenomenon may occur in cases of retrocochlear disorder.
 21. The 
 
 is a number between 0 & 1 
that describes the proportion of average speech signals that 
would be audible to a patient based on the audiogram.
 22. With a “
- 
-
” audio-
gram, the weighting of frequency components of speech by 
 intensity is determined by the number of dots in the audible 
range on an audiogram. This type of measure can serve as a 

310  CHAPTER 7  SPEECH AUDIOMETRY AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL MEASURES
 tool to explain impact of hearing loss on speech 
understanding.
 23. An abnormal growth of loudness due to cochlear hearing 
loss is known as 
.
 24. The presence of recruitment indicates a 
 
disorder.
 25. When the perception of sound is diminished over time at near-
threshold levels, 
 
 is said to occur.
Discussion Questions
 1. Compare and contrast the various types of speech audiometry 
measures used clinically.
 2. What is the benefi t of using speech-recognition threshold 
measures as a cross-check for pure-tone threshold measures?
 3. Explain why the use of recorded materials is preferred over 
monitored live voice for presentation of speech audiometry 
materials.
 4. Explain why sensitized speech measures are used to assess 
auditory processing abilities.
 5. How do the qualities of speech audiometry materials used 
for testing impact outcome of scores?

314  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
IMMITTANCE AUDIOMETRY
IMMITTANCE audiometry is one of the most powerful tools 
available for the evaluation of auditory disorder. It serves at least 
three functions in audiologic assessment:
 1. it is sensitive in detecting middle-ear disorder,
 2. it can be useful in differentiating cochlear from retroco-
chlear disorder, and
 3. it can be helpful as a cross-check to pure-tone audiometry.
As a result of its comprehensive value, immittance audiometry 
is a routine component of the audiologic evaluation and is often 
the first assessment administered in the test battery. When im-
mittance audiometry was first introduced into clinical practice 
during the 1970s, the tendency was to use it to assess middle-
ear function only if  the possibility of  middle-ear disorder was 
indicated by the presence of an air-bone gap on the audiogram. 
That is, the audiologist would assess pure-tone audiometry by air 
conduction and bone conduction. If an air-bone gap did not ex-
ist, the loss was thought to be purely sensorineural. The assump-
tion was made that middle-ear function was normal. In contrast, 
if an air-bone gap existed, indicating a conductive component to 
the hearing loss, the assumption was made that middle-ear dis-
order was present and should be investigated by immittance au-
diometry. As the utility of immittance measures became clear, 
however, this practice changed. The realization was made that the 
presence of middle-ear disorder and the existence of a conductive

component to the hearing loss, although related, are independent 
phenomena. That is, middle-ear disorder can be present without a 
measurable conductive hearing loss or, the opposite, a minor ab-
normality in middle-ear function can result in a signifi cant con-
ductive component.
As a result of the relative independence of the measurement of 
middle-ear function and that of air- and bone-conducted hear-
ing thresholds, immittance audiometry became a routine com-
ponent of the audiologic assessment. In fact, many audiologists 
choose to begin the evaluation process with immittance mea-
sures, before pure-tone or speech audiometry. The overall strategy 
is a simple one: the goal of audiologic testing is to rehabilitate; the 
fi rst question is whether the problem is related to middle-ear dis-
order that is medically treatable; the best measure of middle-ear 
disorder is immittance audiometry; therefore, the fi rst question is 
best addressed by immittance audiometry. If middle-ear disorder 
is identifi ed, the next question is whether it is causing a conduc-
tive hearing loss, which is determined by air- and bone-conduction 
testing. If  middle-ear function is normal, the next question is 
whether a sensorineural hearing loss exists, which is determined 
by air-conduction testing. Some audiologists even take the ap-
proach that if immittance measures are normal, there is no need 
to test by bone conduction.
One other benefi t of starting with immittance audiometry is that 
results can provide a useful indication of  what to expect from 
pure-tone audiometry. This can be particularly valuable when 
evaluating pediatric patients or other patients who might be dif-
fi cult to test behaviorally.
INSTRUMENTATION
An immittance meter is used for these measurements. A 
simplified schematic drawing of  the components is shown in 
Figure 8-1, and a photograph of an immittance meter is shown 
in Figure 8-2.
One major component of  an immittance meter is an oscillator 
that generates a probe tone. The probe-tone frequency used

most commonly is 226 Hz, or for newborns or very young 
infants, 1000 Hz. 
The probe tone is delivered to a transducer that converts the 
electronic signal into the acoustic signal, which in turn is 
delivered to a probe that is sealed in the ear canal. The probe also 
contains a microphone that monitors the level of the probe tone. 
The immittance instrument is designed to maintain the level of 
the probe tone in the ear canal at a constant SPL and to record 
any changes in that SPL on a meter or other  recording device.
Another major component of  the immittance meter is an air 
pump that controls the air pressure in the ear canal. Tubing from 
the probe is attached to the air pump. A manometer measures the 
air pressure that is being delivered to the ear canal.
An immittance meter also contains a signal generator and trans-
ducers for delivering high-intensity signals to the ear for eliciting 
acoustic refl exes, which you will learn about later in this chapter. 
The signal generator produces pure tones and broad-band noise. 
The transducer that is used is either an earphone on the ear oppo-
site to the probe ear or a speaker within the probe itself.
MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE
Immittance is a physical characteristic of all mechanical vibra-
tory systems. In very general terms, it is a measure of how readily 
a system can be set into vibration by a driving force. The ease with 
which energy will fl ow through the vibrating system is called its 
admittance. The reciprocal concept, the extent to which the sys-
tem resists the fl ow of energy through it, is called its impedance. 
If a vibrating system can be forced into motion with little applied 
force, we say that the admittance is high and the impedance is low. 
On the other hand, if the system resists being set into motion un-
til the driving force is relatively high, then we say that the admit-
tance of the system is low and the impedance is high. Immittance 
is a term that is meant to encompass both of these concepts.
Immittance audiometry can be thought of as a way of assessing the 
manner in which energy fl ows through the outer and middle ears 
Admittance is the total 
energy ﬂ ow through a system.
Impedance is the total 
opposition to energy ﬂ ow or 
resistance to the absorption 
of energy.

to the cochlea. The middle-ear mechanism serves to transform en-
ergy from acoustic to hydraulic form. Air-pressure waves from the 
acoustic signal set the tympanic membrane into vibration, which 
in turn sets the ossicles into motion. The footplate of the stapes vi-
brates and sets the fl uids of the cochlea into motion.
Immittance measurement serves as an indirect way of assessing 
the appropriateness of energy flow through this system. If the 
middle-ear system is normal, energy will fl ow in a predictable way. 
If it is not, then energy will fl ow either too well (high admittance) 
or not well enough (high impedance).
Immittance is measured by delivering a pure-tone signal of a con-
stant sound pressure level into the ear canal through a mechani-
cal probe that is seated at the entrance of the ear canal. The signal, 
which is referred to by convention as the probe tone, is a 226 Hz 
pure tone that is delivered at 85 dB SPL. The SPL of the probe tone 
is monitored by an immittance meter, and any change is noted as 
a change in energy fl ow through the middle-ear system.
BASIC IMMITTANCE MEASURES
Three immittance measures are commonly used in the clinical as-
sessment of middle-ear function:
 1. tympanometry,
 2. static immittance, and
 3. acoustic refl ex thresholds.
Tympanometry
Tympanometry is a way of  measuring how acoustic immit-
tance of  the middle-ear vibratory system changes as air pres-
sure is varied in the external ear canal. Transmission of sound 
through the middle-ear mechanism is maximal when air pres-
sure is equal on both sides of  the tympanic membrane. For a 
normal ear, maximum transmission occurs at, or near, atmo-
spheric pressure. That is, when the air pressure in the external 
ear canal is the same as the air pressure in the middle-ear cav-
ity, the immittance of  the normal middle-ear vibratory system 
is at its optimal peak, and energy flow through the system is 
maximal. Middle-ear pressure is assessed by varying pressure 

CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES  319
in the sealed ear canal until the SPL of  the probe tone is at its 
minimum, refl ecting maximum transmission of sound through 
the middle-ear mechanism. But, if the air pressure in the exter-
nal ear canal is either more than (positive pressure) or less than 
(negative pressure) the air pressure in the middle-ear space, the 
immittance of  the system changes, and energy fl ow is dimin-
ished. In a normal system, as soon as the air pressure changes 
even slightly below or above the air pressure that produces max-
imum immittance, the energy fl ow drops quickly and steeply to 
a minimum value. As the pressure is varied above or below the 
point of  maximum transmission, the SPL of  the probe tone in 
the ear canal increases, refl ecting a reduction in sound trans-
mission through the middle ear (Figure 8-3).

320  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
The clinical value of tympanometry is that middle-ear disorder 
modifi es the shape of the tympanogram in predictable ways. Vari-
ous patterns of tympanometric shapes are related to various audi-
tory disorders. The conventional classifi cation system designates 
three tympanogram types, Types, A, B, and C (Jerger, 1970).
Figure 8-4 is an example of the results of tympanometry from a 
person with normal middle-ear function. Air pressure is expressed 
as negative or positive relative to atmospheric pressure. The unit 
of measure of air pressure is the decaPascal, or daPa. The unit of 
measure of immittance is the millimho, or mmho.
This plot of immittance against air pressure is referred to as a tym-
panogram. In the case of the normal system, the tympanogram 
has a characteristic shape. There is a sharp peak in immittance 
decaPascals or daPa = 
unit of pressure in which 
1 daPa equals 10 Pascals.
millimho or mmho = 
one-thousandth of a mho, 
which is a unit of electrical 
conductance, expressed as 
the reciprocal of ohm.

in the vicinity of 0 daPa of air pressure and a rapid decline in im-
mittance as air pressure moves away from 0, either in the negative 
or positive direction. This characteristically normal shape is desig-
nated Type A.
If the middle-ear space is filled with fluid, as is an ear with otitis 
media with effusion, the tympanogram will lose its sharp peak and 
become relatively fl at or rounded. This is due to the mass added to 
the ossicular chain by the fl uid. This tympanogram’s shape is desig-
nated Type B and is depicted in Figure 8-5. In this case, the SPL in 
the ear canal remains fairly constant, regardless of the change in 
air pressure. Because of the increase in mass behind the tympanic 
membrane, varying the air pressure in the ear canal has little effect 
on the amount of energy that fl ows through the middle ear, and the 
SPL of the probe tone in the ear canal does not change.

322  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
A common cause of middle-ear disorder is faulty Eustachian tube 
function. The Eustachian tube connects the middle-ear space to 
the nasopharynx and is ordinarily closed. The tube opens briefl y 
during swallowing, and fresh air is allowed to reach the middle 
ear. Sometimes the tube does not open during swallowing. This of-
ten occurs as a result of swelling in the nasopharynx that blocks 
the orifi ce. When the Eustachian tube does not open, the air that 
is trapped in the middle ear is absorbed by the mucosal lining. This 
results in a reduction of air pressure in the middle-ear space rela-
tive to the pressure in the external ear canal. This pressure differ-
ential will retract the tympanic membrane inward. The effect on 
the tympanogram is to move the sharp peak away from 0 daPa and 
into the negative air pressure region. The reason for this is simple. 
Remember that energy fl ows maximally through the system when 
the air pressure in the ear canal is equal to the air pressure in the 
middle-ear cavity. In normal ears this occurs at atmospheric pres-
sure. But, if the pressure in the middle-ear space is less than at-
mospheric pressure, because of the absorption of trapped air, then 
the maximum energy fl ow will occur when the pressure in the ear 
canal is negative and matches that in the middle-ear space. When 
this balance has been achieved, energy fl ow through the middle-
ear system will be at its maximum and the tympanogram will be 
at its peak. This tympanogram, normal in shape, but with a peak 
at substantial negative air pressure, is designated Type C.
 Anything that causes the ossicular chain to become stiffer than 
normal can result in a reduction in energy fl ow through the mid-
dle ear. The added stiffness simply attenuates the peak of the tym-
panogram. The shape will remain normal Type “A,” but the entire 
tympanogram will become shallower. Such a tympanogram is des-
ignated Type As to indicate that the shape is normal, with the peak 
at or near 0 daPa of air pressure, but with signifi cant reduction in 
the height at the peak. The subscript “s” denotes stiffness or shal-
lowness. The disorder most commonly associated with a Type As 
tympanogram is otosclerosis, a disease of the bone surrounding the 
footplate of the stapes.
Anything that causes the ossicular chain to lose stiffness can re-
sult in too much energy fl ow through the middle ear. For example, 
if there is a break or discontinuity in the ossicles connecting the 
Type As = normal shape, 
but height is signiﬁ cantly 
decreased or shallow.
Type C = negative pressure.

CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES  323
tympanic membrane to the cochlea, the tympanogram will retain 
its normal shape, but the peak will be much greater than normal. 
With the heavy load of the cochlear fl uid system removed from 
the chain, the tympanic membrane is much more free to respond 
to forced vibration. The energy flow through the middle ear is 
greatly enhanced, resulting in a very deep tympanogram. This 
shape is designated Ad to indicate that the shape of the tympano-
gram is normal, with the peak at or near 0 daPa of air pressure, 
but the height is signifi cantly increased. The subscript “d” denotes 
deep or discontinuity.
The four abnormal tympanogram types are shown in Figure 8-6. 
Their diagnostic value lies in the information that they convey 
about middle-ear function, which provides valuable clues about 
changes in the physical status of the middle ear. The usefulness 
of tympanometry is enhanced when it is viewed in combination 
with two other components of the total battery, static immittance 
and the acoustic refl ex.
Classifying tympanograms based on descriptive types is a simple, 
effective approach to describing tympanometric outcomes. There 
are, however, other ways to analyze the tympanogram with more 
refi nement. For example, a tympanogram can be described by its 
peak pressure (tympanometric peak pressure or TPP), which is 
simply the number in daPa that corresponds to the peak of the 
tympanogram trace. Another way is to try to describe the ac-
tual shape of the tympanometric curve, which is done either by 
quantifying its gradient, which is the relationship of its height 
and width, or by measuring the tympanometric width. Tympa-
nometric width is measured by calculating the daPa at the point 
corresponding to 50% of the static immittance value, as shown 
in Figure 8-7. This is a very effective way to describe a rounded 
tympanogram, and excessive widths are often found in ears with 
middle-ear effusion (Koebsell & Margolis, 1986).
One other important consideration in tympanometry is probe-tone 
frequency, especially in the testing of infants. The use of multifre-
quency, multicomponent tympanograms has been studied for a 
number of years (Vanhuyse et al., 1975; Margolis & Hunter, 1999). 
The addition of tympanograms obtained with high-frequency probe

but height is signiﬁ cantly 
increased or deep.

324  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
tones has been shown to enhance the sensitivity of tympanometry to 
certain middle-ear disorders. The value of high-frequency tympano-
grams has become increasingly clear in the measurement of middle-
ear function in infants. Indeed, it is now common clinical practice 
to use a 1000 Hz probe tone when testing newborns and young in-
fants (Baldwin, 2006). The reason is probably best demonstrated by 
the results shown in Figure 8-8. Tympanograms from a 5-week-old 
infant, measured with both 226 Hz and 1000 Hz probe tones, are

is clear, as judged by otoscopy. Results show fairly normal, peaked 
tympanograms in both ears with the 226 Hz probe but a clearly dif-
ferent picture with the 1000 Hz probe. The use of higher frequency 
probe tones has become routine in modern audiology practice.
Static Immittance
In contrast to the dynamic measure of  middle-ear function 
represented by the tympanogram, the term static immittance 
refers to the isolated contribution of the middle ear to the overall 
acoustic immittance of the auditory system. It can be thought 
of as simply the absolute height of the tympanogram at its peak. 
The static immittance is measured by comparing the probe-tone 
SPL or immittance when the air pressure is at 0 daPa, or at the air 
pressure corresponding to the peak, with the immittance when 
the air pressure is raised to positive 200 daPa. It is convenient to 
express these immittance measures as equivalent volumes of air 
in cubic centimeters (cc). The idea is a simple one. When a signal 
of equivalent intensity is placed into different sized cavities, the 
SPL of the signal varies. The SPL of the signal in a small cavity is 
Static immittance is the 
measure of the contribution 
of the middle ear to acoustic 
impedance.

relatively higher and in a large cavity is relatively lower. Therefore, 
if the probe-tone SPL increases when the air pressure is raised to 
+200 daPa as less energy fl ows through the middle ear, it is as if 
the cavity is smaller. Conversely, if the SPL decreases at 0 daPa as 
more energy fl ows through the middle ear, it is as if the cavity is 
larger. Thus these changes in SPL can be converted to the notion 
of volume changes and expressed in units of equivalent volume. 
It is important to remember that little actual volume change 
occurs. Only the SPL of  the probe-tone changes due to energy 
fl owing through the middle ear, as if the volume changed. When 
the air pressure is at +200 daPa, this measure is equivalent to the 
volume of air in the external ear canal. The contribution from the 
middle-ear system is negligible. Volume of air in the external ear 
canal varies from 0.5 cc to 1.5 cc in children and adults. When 
the air pressure is at 0 daPa, however, the measured volume is 
larger because it includes the equivalent volume of the middle-ear 
system. Remember that, as the air pressure is adjusted from +200

to 0, the energy flow through the normal middle-ear system is 
enhanced, resulting in a decrease in probe-tone SPL, as if  the 
volume of the system had increased. The static immittance, then, 
is the difference between the volume measurement at the two 
different air pressures. In adults with normal middle-ear function, 
the difference ranges from 0.3 to 1.6 cc.
There are two diagnostic applications of the static immittance. 
First, values lying below 0.3 cc or above 1.6 cc are strong evi-
dence of middle-ear disorder. This information is useful in decid-
ing whether a Type A tympanogram is normal, shallow, or deep. 
For example, if the tympanogram is Type A and the static immit-
tance is 0.2, then the tympanogram can be considered shallow 
and indicative of increased stiffness of the middle-ear mechanism. 
Unfortunately, the range of normal static immittance is so large 
that many of  the milder forms of  middle-ear disorder will fall 
within the normal boundaries. Thus, the test lacks transitivity in 
that only one outcome is meaningful. That is, if the static immit-
tance falls outside the normal range, it is safe to predict middle-ear 
disorder. But, values within the normal range do not necessarily 
exclude the possibility of middle-ear disorder.
The second, and perhaps more useful clinical application of the 
static immittance measure lies in its ability to detect small perfo-
rations of the tympanic membrane. Recall that the fi rst volume 
measurement taken, with the air pressure in the external canal 
at +200 daPa, is indicating the equivalent volume of air in the 
external ear canal. If there is any hole in the tympanic membrane 
through which air can travel, then the measurement will be of both 
the ear canal and the much larger volume of air in the middle-ear 
space. Therefore, if the initial volume measurement in the static 
immittance procedure is considerably larger than 1.5 cc, such as 
4.5 or 5.0 cc, it means that there is a perforation in the tympanic 
membrane through which air can pass. This method for detect-
ing perforations can be more sensitive to small perforations than 
visual inspection of the tympanic membrane.
Acoustic Reflexes
When a sound is of sufficient intensity, it will elicit a reflex of the 
middle-ear musculature. In humans, the refl ex consists primarily of 

328  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
the stapedius muscle. In other animals, the tensor tympani muscle 
contributes to a greater degree to the overall refl ex.
The stapedius muscle is attached by a tendon from the posterior 
wall of the middle ear to the head of the stapes. When the muscle 
contracts, the tendon exerts tension on the stapes, stiffens the os-
sicular chain, and reduces low-frequency energy transmission 
through the middle ear. The result of this reduced energy trans-
mission is an increase in probe-tone SPL in the external ear canal. 
Therefore, when the stapedius muscle contracts in response to 
high-intensity sounds, a slight change in immittance can be de-
tected by the circuitry of the immittance instrument.
Both the right and left middle-ear muscles contract in response 
to sound delivered to either ear. Therefore, ipsilateral (un-
crossed) and contralateral (crossed) refl exes are recorded with 
sound presented to each ear. For example, when a signal of suf-
fi cient magnitude is presented to the right ear, a stapedius refl ex 
will occur in both the right (ipsilateral or uncrossed) and the 
left (contralateral or crossed) ears. These are called the right un-
crossed and the right crossed refl exes, respectively. When a signal 
is presented to the left ear and a refl ex is measured in that ear, it 
is referred to as a left uncrossed refl ex. When a signal is presented 
to the left ear and a refl ex is measured in the right ear, it is re-
ferred to as a left crossed refl ex.
Threshold Measures 
The threshold is the most common measure of  the acoustic 
stapedial reflex and is defined as the lowest intensity level 
at which a middle-ear immittance change can be detected 
in response to sound. In people having normal hearing and 
normal middle-ear function, reflex thresholds for pure tones 
will be reached at levels ranging from 70 to 100 dB HL. The 
average threshold level is approximately 85 dB (Wiley et al., 
1987). These levels are consistent across the frequency range 
from 500 to 4000 Hz. Threshold measures are useful for at least 
two purposes: (1) differential assessment of  auditory disorder 
and (2) detection of hearing sensitivity loss.
Reflex threshold measurement has been valuable in both the as-
sessment of middle-ear function and the differentiation of cochlear

Contralateral = crossed

the middle ear are the 
stapedius and the tensor 
tympani.

CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES  329
from retrocochlear disorder. In terms of the latter, whereas refl ex 
thresholds occur at reduced sensation levels in ears with cochlear 
hearing loss, they are typically elevated or absent in ears with VIIIth 
nerve disorder (Anderson et al., 1970). Similarly, refl ex thresholds 
are often abnormal in patients with brainstem disorder. Compari-
son of crossed and uncrossed thresholds has also been found to 
be helpful in differentiating VIIIth nerve from brainstem disorders 
(Jerger & Jerger, 1977).
Although threshold measures are valuable, interpretation of the 
absence or abnormal elevation of an acoustic refl ex threshold can 
be diffi cult because the same refl ex abnormality can result from a 
number of pathologic conditions. For example, the absence of a 
right crossed acoustic refl ex can result from:
a substantial conductive loss on the right ear that keeps 
• 
sound from being suffi cient to cause a refl ex,
a severe sensorineural hearing loss on the right ear that 
• 
keeps sound from being suffi cient to cause a refl ex,
right VIIIth nerve tumor that keeps sound from being suf-
• 
fi cient to cause a refl ex,
a lesion of the crossing fi bers of the central portion of the 
• 
refl ex arc,
left facial nerve disorder that restricts neural impulses from 
• 
reaching the stapedius muscle, or 
left middle-ear disorder that keeps the stapedius contraction 
• 
from having an infl uence on middle-ear function.
A schematic example of these six possibilities is shown in Figure 8-9. 
It is for this reason that the addition of uncrossed refl ex measure-
ment, tympanometry, and static immittance is important in refl ex 
threshold interpretation.
Acoustic refl ex thresholds have also been used for the detection of 
cochlear hearing loss (Niemeyer & Sesterhenn, 1974). Cochlear 
bandwidth effects on the acoustic reflex have been exploited to 
predict the presence of hearing loss and have been applied success-
fully in the clinic. Although not altogether precise, use of acoustic 
refl exes for the general categorization of normal versus abnormal 
cochlear sensitivity is clinically useful as a powerful cross-check to 
behavioral audiometry, especially in children.

330  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
Suprathreshold Measures 
Suprathreshold analysis of the acoustic refl ex includes such mea-
sures as decay, latency, and amplitude. Acoustic refl ex decay 
is often a component of routine immittance measurement used 
to differentiate cochlear from VIIIth nerve disorder (Anderson 
et al., 1970). Although various measurement techniques and 
criteria for abnormality have been developed, refl ex decay test-
ing is typically carried out by presenting a 10-second signal at 
10 dB above the refl ex threshold. Results are considered abnormal if 
amplitude of the resultant refl ex decreases to less than half of its 
initial maximum value, refl ecting abnormal auditory adaptation 
(Figure 8-10). Refl ex decay has been shown to be a sensitive mea-
sure of VIIIth nerve, brainstem, and neuromuscular disorders. 
One of the problems associated with refl ex decay testing, how-
ever, is a high false-positive rate in patients with cochlear hearing 
loss (Jerger & Jerger, 1983). For example, positive refl ex decay has 
been reported in as many as 27% of patients with cochlear loss 
due to Ménière’s disease. This is considered a false-positive result 
in that it is positive for retrocochlear disorder when the actual 
disorder is cochlear in nature.
Decay is the diminution of 
the physical properties of a 
stimulus or response.
Latency is the time interval 
between two events, as a 
stimulus and a response.
Amplitude is the 
magnitude of a sound wave, 
acoustic reﬂ ex, or evoked 
potential.

CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES  331
Other suprathreshold measures include latency and amplitude. 
Various studies have suggested that these measures may pro-
vide additional sensitivity to the immittance battery, especially 
in the differentiation of retrocochlear disorder (for a review, see 
Stach & Jerger, 1984; Stach, 1987). Refl ex latency and rise time 
have been used as diagnostic measures and have been shown to 
be abnormal in ears with VIIIth nerve disorder, multiple scle-
rosis, and other brainstem disorders. Similarly, depressed refl ex 
amplitudes have been reported in patients with VIIIth nerve tu-
mors, multiple sclerosis, and other brainstem disorders.
PRINCIPLES OF INTERPRETATION
The key to the successful interpretation of immittance data lies 
not in the examination of individual results, but in the exami-
nation of the pattern of results characterizing the entire audio-
metric assessment. Within this frame of reference the following 
observations are relevant.
FIGURE 8-10 Examples of no acoustic reﬂ ex decay and abnormal 
acoustic reﬂ ex decay. Abnormal decay occurs when the 
amplitude of the reﬂ ex decreases to at least half of its 
initial maximum value.

 1. Certain tympanometric shapes are diagnostically 
 useful. The Type C tympanogram, for example, clearly indi-
cates reduced air pressure in the middle-ear space. Similarly 
the Type B tympanogram suggests mass loading of the vibra-
tory mechanism. The Type A tympanogram, however, may 
be ambiguous to interpret.
 2. Static immittance is also subject to ambiguous 
 interpretation. Certain pathologies of the middle-ear act 
to render the static immittance abnormally low, while oth-
ers should have the opposite effect. But the distribution of 
static immittance in normal ears is so broad (95% interval 
from 0.3 to 1.6 cc) that only very extreme changes in im-
mittance are suffi cient to drive the static immittance outside 
the normal boundaries.
 3. The acoustic refl ex is exceedingly sensitive to middle-
ear disorder. Only a 5 to 10 dB air-bone gap is usually 
 suffi cient to eliminate the refl ex when the immittance probe 
is in the ear with conductive loss. As a corollary, the most 
common reason for an abnormality of the acoustic refl ex 
is middle-ear disorder. Thus, the possibility of middle-ear 
disorder as an explanation for any refl ex abnormality must 
always be considered.
 4. Crossed refl ex threshold testing is usually carried out 
at frequencies of  500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. How-
ever, even in normal ears, results are unstable at 4000 Hz. 
Apparent abnormality of the refl ex threshold at this test 
frequency may not be diagnostically relevant. Uncrossed re-
fl ex threshold testing is usually carried out at frequencies of 
1000 and 2000 Hz.
 5. Refl ex-eliciting stimuli should not exceed 110 dB 
HL, for any signal, unless there is clear evidence of  a 
substantial air-bone gap in the ear to which sound is 
 being delivered. Duration of presentation must be carefully 
controlled and kept short (i.e., less than 1 second). There is 
a danger that stimulation at these exceedingly high levels 
will be upsetting to the patient. Several case reports have 
documented temporary or permanent auditory changes 
in patients following refl ex testing. It is for this reason that 
very judicious use be made of the refl ex decay test, in which 
stimulation is continuous for 5 to 10 seconds.

CLINICAL APPLICATIONS
Middle-Ear Disorder
Principles of Clinical Application
Middle-ear function is assessed by measurement of static immit-
tance, tympanometry, and acoustic reflexes. Each measure is 
evaluated in isolation against normative data and then in combi-
nation to determine the pattern. The typical immittance pattern 
associated with middle-ear disorder includes:
 1. some abnormality of the normal tympanometric shape,
 2. some abnormality of the static immittance, and
 3. no observable acoustic refl ex to either crossed or uncrossed 
stimulation when the probe is in the affected ear.
In addition, if the middle-ear disorder results in a substantial con-
ductive hearing loss, no crossed refl ex will be observed when the 
refl ex-eliciting signal is presented to the affected ear. Patterns fall 
into one of six categories, which are described in Table 8-1. The 
six patterns include:
 1. results consistent with normal middle-ear function,
 2. results consistent with an increase in the mass of the middle-
ear mechanism,
 3. results consistent with an increase in the stiffness of the 
middle-ear mechanism,

Normal Middle-Ear Function 
Figure 8-11 shows immittance results on a young adult. Both ears 
are characterized by Type A tympanograms, normal static immit-
tance, and normal refl ex thresholds.
Increased Mass 
Figure 8-12 shows immittance results on a young girl. The right 
ear results are characterized by a Type B tympanogram, exces-
sively low static immittance, and absent right uncrossed and left 
crossed acoustic reflexes. These results are consistent with in-
creased mass of the right middle-ear mechanism. The left ear im-
mittance results are normal. The tympanogram is a Type A, static 
immittance is within normal limits, and left uncrossed refl exes are 
present. The absence of right crossed refl exes in the presence of 
left uncrossed refl exes suggests that the right middle-ear disorder 
has produced a substantial conductive hearing loss on the right 
ear. The middle-ear disorder characterized here was caused by oti-
tis media with effusion.
Increased Stiffness 
Figure 8-13 shows immittance results on a middle-aged woman. 
Both the right and left ears are characterized by Type A tympano-
grams, relatively low static immittance, and absent acoustic re-
flexes. These results are consistent with an increase in stiffness 
of  both middle-ear mechanisms. This middle-ear disorder was 
caused by otosclerosis.
Excessive Immittance
Figure 8-14 shows immittance results on a 24-year-old man who 
was evaluated following mild head trauma. The left ear results are 
characterized by a Type A tympanogram, excessively high static 
immittance, and absent acoustic refl exes, probe left (left uncrossed 
and right crossed). The right ear immittance results are normal. 

CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES  335
The tympanogram is a Type A, static immittance is within nor-
mal limits, and right uncrossed refl exes are present. The absence 
of left crossed refl exes in the presence of right uncrossed refl exes 
suggests that the left middle-ear disorder is causing a substantial 
conductive hearing loss on the left ear. This middle-ear disorder 
was caused by ossicular discontinuity.

The left ear immittance results are normal. The tympanogram 
is a Type A, static immittance is within normal limits, and left

refl exes in the presence of normal left uncrossed refl exes suggests 
that the right middle-ear disorder is causing a mild conductive

Refl ex thresholds will only be normal, however, as long as the sen-
sitivity loss by air conduction does not exceed 50 dB HL. Above 
this level, the refl ex threshold is usually elevated in proportion to 
the degree of loss. Once a behavioral threshold exceeds 70 dB, the 
absence of a refl ex is equivocal, because it can be due to the de-
gree of peripheral hearing loss as well as to retrocochlear disorder 
(Jerger et al., 1972).

CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES  341
In ears with cochlear hearing loss, acoustic reflex thresholds 
are present at reduced sensation levels. In normal-hearing 
ears, behavioral threshold to pure tones are, by defi nition, at or 
around 0 dB HL. Acoustic refl ex thresholds occur at or around 
85 dB HL, or at a sensation level of  85 dB. In a patient with 
a sensorineural hearing loss of  40 dB, reflex thresholds still 
occur at around 85 dB HL, or at a sensation level of  45 dB. 
This reduced sensation level of  the acoustic refl ex threshold is 
characteristic of cochlear hearing loss.
Several methods have been developed for using acoustic refl ex 
thresholds to detect hearing loss. One method that has gained 
some popularity is the Sensitivity Prediction by the Acoustic 
Refl ex (SPAR) test (Jerger et al., 1974). The SPAR test is based 
on the well-documented difference between acoustic reflex 
thresholds to pure tones versus broad-band noise (BBN) and 
on the change in BBN thresholds but not pure-tone thresholds 
as a result of  sensorineural hearing loss. That is, thresholds 
to BBN signals are lower (better) than thresholds to pure-tone 
signals. However, sensorineural hearing loss has a differential 
effect on the two signals, raising the threshold to BBN signals, 
but not to pure-tone signals. The SPAR test capitalizes on this 
effect to provide a general prediction of the presence or absence 
of hearing loss.
To compute the SPAR value, the BBN threshold is subtracted 
from the average refl ex threshold to pure tones of  500, 1000, 
and 2000 Hz. The magnitude of  this difference will vary 
according to the specific equipment used to carry out the 
measures. A correction factor is then applied to yield a SPAR 
value of 20 in normal hearing subjects. If a patient’s SPAR value 
is less than 15, there is a high probability of  a sensorineural 
hearing loss. An example of  the SPAR calculation in a normal 
hearing individual is shown in Figure 8-17. Note the low value 
of  the BBN threshold in comparison to the thresholds for pure 
tones. The difference between the average pure-tone thresholds 
and BBN threshold is large, resulting in a large or normal 
SPAR. An example of  the SPAR calculation in a patient with a 
high-frequency sensorineural hearing impairment is shown in 
Figure 8-18. Note the higher BBN threshold and how it affects 
the SPAR value.
SPAR = Reﬂ ex PTA – BBN

342  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
Use of  the SPAR or other techniques based on acoustic reflex 
thresholds is only effective at predicting general degree of hearing 
loss. Clinical application of such techniques appears to be most ef-
fective when used to predict presence or absence of a sensorineu-
ral hearing loss.
Prediction of hearing sensitivity by acoustic refl ex thresholds can 
be very valuable in testing a child on whom behavioral thresholds 
cannot be obtained. Figure 8-19 shows immittance results of 
a 2-year-old child who fits this description. Regardless of  the 
nature or intensity of effort, behavioral audiometry could not be 
completed, and a startle refl ex could not be elicited at equipment 
intensity limits. Tympanograms were Type A, with maximum 
immittance at 0 daPa. Static immittance was symmetric and 
within normal limits. Crossed acoustic reflex thresholds were 
present and normal at 500 and 1000 Hz, elevated at 2000 Hz, 
and absent at 4000 Hz, bilaterally. The SPAR value was only 4 dB 
bilaterally, suggesting a sensorineural hearing loss. Based on the 
SPAR and on the confi guration of the crossed threshold pattern,

in the low.

diction is in the case of  a patient who is feigning hearing loss.

were all within normal limits. SPARs of 20 and 22 dB and a fl at 
refl ex threshold confi guration predicted normal hearing sensi-
tivity bilaterally.
Retrocochlear Disorder
Acoustic reflex threshold or suprathreshold patterns can be 
helpful in differentiating cochlear from retrocochlear disorder. 
The typical immittance pattern associated with retrocochlear 
disorder includes:
normal tympanogram,
• 
normal static immittance, and
• 
abnormal elevation of refl ex threshold, or absence of refl ex 
• 
response, whenever the refl ex-eliciting signal is delivered to 
the suspect ear in either the crossed or the uncrossed mode.
For example, in the case of a right-sided acoustic tumor, the tym-
panograms and static immittance would be normal. Abnormal-
ity would be observed for the right uncrossed and the right-to-left 
crossed refl ex responses. The key factor differentiating retrocochlear 
from cochlear elevated reflex thresholds is the audiometric level 
at the test frequency. As you learned previously, in the case of co-
chlear loss, refl ex thresholds are not elevated at all until the audio-
metric loss exceeds 50 dB HL, and even above this level the degree 
of elevation is proportional to the audiometric level. In the case of 
retrocochlear disorder, however, the elevation is more than would 
be predicted from the audiometric level. The refl ex threshold may 
be elevated by 20 to 25 dB even though the audiometric level shows 
no more than a 5 or 10 dB loss. If the audiometric loss exceeds 70 
to 75 dB, then the absence of the acoustic refl ex is ambiguous. The 
abnormality could be attributed either to retrocochlear disorder or 
to cochlear loss.
For diagnostic interpretation, acoustic refl ex measures are probably 
best understood if viewed in the context of a three-part refl ex arc:
 1. the sensory or input portion (afferent),
 2. the central nervous system portion that transmits neural 
information (central), and
 3. the motor or output portion (efferent).

346  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
An afferent abnormality occurs as the result of  a disordered 
sensory system on one ear. An example of a pure afferent effect 
would result from a profound unilateral sensorineural hearing 
loss on the right ear. Both reflexes with signal presented to the 
right ear (right uncrossed and right-to-left crossed) would be 
absent. An efferent abnormality occurs as the result of a disordered 
motor system or middle-ear mechanism on one ear. An example 
of a pure efferent effect would result from right unilateral facial 
nerve paralysis. Both refl exes measured by the probe in the right 
ear (right uncrossed and left-to-right crossed) would be absent. 
A central pathway abnormality occurs as the result of brainstem 
disorder and is manifested by the elevation or absence of one or 
both of the crossed acoustic reflexes in the presence of normal 
uncrossed refl ex thresholds.
Cochlear Hearing Loss
Figure 8-21 shows the immittance results of a patient with a sen-
sorineural hearing loss. The patient was diagnosed as having acute 
labyrinthitis resulting in a unilateral hearing loss and dizziness. 
Tympanograms, static immittance, and acoustic refl ex thresholds 
are within normal limits. Even though the patient has a substantial 
sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear, refl ex thresholds remain 
within normal limits. The presence of left uncrossed and left-to-
right crossed refl exes argues for a cochlear site of disorder.
Afferent Abnormality
Figure 8-22 shows the immittance results of a patient with an 
afferent acoustic refl ex abnormality resulting from retrocochlear 
disorder. The patient was diagnosed as having a right acoustic 
tumor. Tympanograms and static compliance are normal. Acous-
tic reflexes, with sound presented to the left ear (left uncrossed 
and left-to-right crossed), are normal. However, reflexes with 
sound presented to the right ear (right uncrossed and right-to-left 
crossed) are absent. This pattern of abnormality suggests an affer-
ent disorder which, in the absence of a severe degree of hearing 
loss, is consistent with retrocochlear disorder.

cial paralysis of  unknown etiology. She had no history of  pre-
vious middle-ear disorder and no auditory complaints. The 
tympanogram and static immittance are normal on both ears. 
Acoustic refl exes are present at normal intensity levels when re-
corded from the right probe (right uncrossed and left-to-right 
crossed). However, no refl exes could be measured from the left

Uncrossed refl exes are normal for both ears. In addition, right-to-
left crossed refl exes are present at normal levels. However, left-to-
right crossed refl exes are absent. The presence of a left uncrossed 
refl ex rules out the possibility of either a substantial hearing loss 
or an acoustic tumor on the left side. The presence of a right un-
crossed refl ex rules out the possibility of middle-ear disorder on the 
right side. The absence of a left crossed refl ex, then, can only be 
explained as the result of a brainstem disorder.

CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES  351
Summary
Immittance is a physical characteristic of  all mechanical 
• 
 vibratory systems. In very general terms, it is a measure of how 
readily a system can be set into vibration by a driving force.
Immittance audiometry is a way of assessing the manner in 
• 
which energy fl ows through the outer and middle-ears to the 
cochlea.
Immittance audiometry is a powerful tool for the evaluation of 
• 
auditory disorder.
Three immittance measures are commonly used in the clinical 
• 
assessment of middle-ear function: tympanometry, static im-
mittance, and acoustic refl ex thresholds.
The key to successful use of the immittance battery in clinical 
• 
evaluation is to view the results in combination with the total-
ity of the audiometric examination rather than in isolation. 
Immittance measures are useful in quantifying middle-ear disor-
• 
ders and in differentiating cochlear from retrocochlear disorders.
Short Answer Questions
 1. The functions of 
 audiometry include: the 
detection of 
 ear disorder; differentiation of 
cochlear from 
 disorder; and a cross-check of 
pure-tone audiometry.
 2. The term 
 describes the total fl ow of energy 
through a system. The term 
 describes the 
 opposition to energy fl ow through a system. The term 
 encompassing both concepts is 
 .
 3. Immittance measures provide an indirect way of assessing 
appropriateness of energy fl ow through the 
 
 mechanism.
 4. The basic immittance measures consist of 
,  
 immittance, and acoustic 
.
 5. The measure of how acoustic immittance of the middle-ear 
system changes as air pressure is varied in the external ear 
canal is known as 
.
 6. A 
 is a graph of the level of immittance mea-
sured as a function of air pressure in daPa.

352  CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES
 7. The conventional classifi cation of tympanograms depends 
on the 
 of the tympanogram, and is classifi ed 
as being Type 
, Type B, or Type 
.
 8. In the case of a Type 
 tympanogram, peak im-
mittance occurs at normal atmospheric pressure. This rep-
resents 
 middle-ear function.
 9. In the case of a Type 
 tympanogram, there is a 
loss of a sharp peak due to added mass in middle-ear system. 
This type of tympanogram is consistent with 
 
in the middle-ear space.
 10. In the case of a Type 
 tympanogram, the 
peak immittance occurs at a value negative to atmospheric 
pressure. This type of tympanogram is consistent with 
 dysfunction.
 11. The most common cause of middle-ear disorder is 
 
 dysfunction. As the Eustachian 
tube does not open properly to 
 the middle-ear 
space, trapped air is absorbed by mucosal lining. The rela-
tively negative pressure in this space causes the tympanic 
membrane to retract in toward middle-ear space.
 12. When the peak immittance of a tympanogram occurs 
at normal atmospheric pressure, but its height is signifi -
cantly decreased or 
, it is classifi ed as a Type 
 tympanogram. This type of tympanogram 
is consistent with a middle-ear disorder of increased 
, such as otosclerosis.
 13. When the peak immittance of a tympanogram occurs at 
normal atmospheric pressure but its height is signifi cantly 
increased or deep, it is classifi ed as a Type 
 
tympanogram. This type of tympanogram is consistent 
with a middle-ear disorder of increased energy fl ow 
through system, such as a 
 of the ossicular 
chain.
 14. The value that corresponds to the pressure level where 
the peak of a tympanogram trace occurs is known as the 
 
 
.
 15. The value of relative pressure in daPa at the point corre-
sponding to 50% of static immittance value is known as the  
 
 .

CHAPTER 8  IMMITTANCE MEASURES  353
 16. The frequency of the probe tone that is typically used for 
immittance testing is 
 Hz. In infants and very 
young newborns, it is necessary to use a 
 Hz 
probe tone.
 17. The difference between volume measurement of space 
 between +200 daPa and immittance peak is known as the 
 
 measurement.
 18. The use of the 
 
 measurement can 
help to provide information regarding the presence of a per-
foration in the tympanic membrane.
 19. The 
 
 occurs when a sound 
of suffi cient intensity elicits a refl ex of the middle-ear 
musculature.
 20. In humans, the acoustic refl ex is primarily caused by activa-
tion of the 
 muscle.
 21. The acoustic refl ex is a 
 response, meaning that 
both ears respond refl exively, even when the sound is only 
heard in one ear.
 22. Ipsilateral (
) refl exes occur when the sound 
is presented and the refl ex is measured in the same ear. 
Contralateral (
) refl exes occur when the 
sound is presented to one ear, and the refl ex is measured 
in the opposite ear.
 23. The acoustic refl ex arc can be divided into 
 
(sensory), central, and 
 (motor) components.
 24. The 
 
 
 is the lowest 
intensity level at which middle-ear immittance change can 
be detected in response to sound that elicits an acoustic 
refl ex.
 25. Above the level of a 50 dB cochlear hearing loss, the acous-
tic refl ex is usually 
 in proportion to degree of 
hearing loss. At threshold levels above 
 dB HL, 
absence of refl ex is equivocal.
 26. The 
 
 by the 
 
 test compares the acoustic reflex 
thresholds of broad-band noise signals to pure-tone 
signals in order to predict the presence or absence of a 
cochlear hearing loss.

Discussion Questions
 1. Many audiologists conduct immittance measures as the fi rst 
component of the hearing test battery. Why might this be 
benefi cial?
 2. Considering the goal of audiologic testing, what role do 
 immittance measures play in achieving that goal?
 3. Describe the instrumentation that is used in making immit-
tance measurements.
 4. How does middle-ear dysfunction affect the immittance of 
the middle ear?
 5. What type of tympanometric fi ndings might be character-
istic of Eustachian tube dysfunction? How does Eustachian 
tube dysfunction result in these characteristic tympanomet-
ric fi ndings?
 6. Describe the pathway involved in the acoustic refl ex response.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  357
AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIALS
BY means of computer averaging, it is possible to extract the tiny 
electrical voltages, or potentials, evoked in the brain by acoustic 
stimulation. These electrical events are quite complex and can be 
observed over a fairly broad time interval after the onset of stim-
ulation. An auditory evoked potential (AEP) is a waveform that 
reflects the electrophysiologic function of  a certain portion of 
the central auditory nervous system in response to sound (for an 
overview, see Burkard et al., 2007, Hall, 2007). 
For audiologic purposes, it is convenient to group the AEPs into 
categories based loosely on the latency ranges over which the 
potentials are observed. The earliest of  the evoked potentials, 
 occurring within the fi rst 5 msec following signal presentation, 
is referred to as an electrocochleogram (ECoG) and refl ects activity 
of the cochlea and VIIIth nerve. The most commonly used evoked 
potential is referred to as the auditory brainstem response (ABR) 
and occurs within the fi rst 10 msec following signal onset. The 
ABR refl ects neural activity from the VIIIth nerve to the midbrain. 
The middle latency response (MLR) occurs within the fi rst 50 msec 
following signal onset and refl ects activity at or near the auditory 
cortex. The late latency response (LLR) occurs within the fi rst 250 
msec following signal onset and refl ects activity of the primary-
auditory and association areas of the cerebral cortex.
These measures, the EcoG, ABR, MLR, and LLR are known as tran-
sient potentials in that they occur and are recorded in response to a

single stimulus presentation. The response is allowed to end before 
the next signal is presented. The process is then repeated numerous 
times, and the responses are averaged. A different type of evoked po-
tential, called the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), is measured 
by evaluating the ongoing activity of the brain in response to a mod-
ulation, or change, in an ongoing stimulus. The ASSR refl ects activ-
ity from different portions of the brain, depending on the modulation 
rate used. Responses from slower rates emanate from more central 
structures of the brain, while responses from faster rates emanate 
from the more peripheral auditory nerve and brainstem structures.
Auditory evoked potentials provide an objective means of assess-
ing the integrity of the peripheral and central auditory systems. 
For this reason, evoked potential audiometry has become a pow-
erful tool in the measurement of hearing of young children and 
others who cannot or will not cooperate during behavioral test-
ing. It also serves as a valuable diagnostic tool in measuring the 
function of auditory nervous system structures.
There are four major applications of auditory evoked potential 
measurement:
 1. prediction of hearing sensitivity,
 2. infant hearing screening,
 3. diagnostic assessment of central auditory nervous system 
function, and
 4. monitoring of auditory nervous system function during 
surgery.
The use of auditory evoked potentials for prediction of hearing 
sensitivity and infant hearing screening has had a major impact 
on our ability to identify hearing impairment in children. The 
ABR is used to screen newborns to identify those in need of addi-
tional testing. Both the ABR and ASSR are used to predict hearing 
sensitivity levels in children with suspected hearing impairment.
Diagnostic assessment is usually made with the ABR, MLR, and 
LLR. The ABR is highly sensitive to disorders of the VIIIth nerve 
and auditory brainstem and is often used in conjunction with 
imaging and radiologic measures to assist in the diagnosis of 
acoustic tumors and brainstem disorders. Surgical monitoring

of evoked potentials is usually carried out with ECoG and ABR. 
These evoked potentials are monitored during VIIIth nerve tumor 
removal surgery in an effort to preserve hearing.
Measurement Techniques
The brain processes information by sending small electrical 
impulses from one nerve to another. This electrical activity can be 
recorded by placing sensing electrodes on the scalp and measuring 
the ongoing changes in electrical potentials throughout the brain. 
This technique is called electroencephalography, or EEG, and is the 
basis for recording evoked potentials. The passive monitoring 
of EEG activity reveals the brain in a constant state of activity; 
electrical potentials of  various frequencies and amplitudes 
occur continually. If a sound is introduced to the ear, the brain’s 
response to that sound is just another of  a vast number of 
electrical potentials that occur at that instant in time. Evoked 
potential measurement techniques are designed to extract those 
tiny signals from the ongoing electrical activity.
Recording evoked potentials requires sophisticated amplifi cation of 
the electrical activity, computer signal averaging, proper stimuli to 
evoke an auditory response, and precise timing of stimulus delivery 
and response recording. A schematic representation of the instru-
mentation is shown in Figure 9-1. Basically, at the same moment in 
time that a stimulus is presented to an earphone, a computer mea-
sures electrical activity from electrodes affi xed to the scalp over a 
fi xed period of time. The process is repeated many times, and the 
computer averages the responses. This results in a series of wave-
forms that reflect synchronized electrical activity from various 
structures of the peripheral and central auditory nervous system.
Recording EEG Activity
To record EEG activity, electrodes are affi xed to the scalp. These 
electrodes are usually gold or silver plated and are pasted to the 
scalp with a gel that facilitates electrical conduction. For measur-
ing auditory evoked potentials, electrodes are placed on the center 
of the scalp, called the vertex, and on both earlobes, in the ear ca-
nals, or behind the ears on the mastoid area. A ground electrode 
is usually placed on the forehead. The electrical activity measured 
at the vertex is compared to that measured at the earlobe.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  361
Electrical potentials related specifically to an auditory signal are 
quite small in comparison to other electrical activity that is occur-
ring at the same moment in time. The electrodes pick up all electri-
cal activity, and activity related to the auditory stimulation need to 
be extracted from the other activity. The process involved is designed 
to enhance the signal in relation to the noise or the signal-to-noise 
ratio (SNR). The fi rst step in the extraction process occurs at the pre-
amplifi er stage. The preamplifi er is known as a differential amplifi er, 
and is designed to provide common-mode rejection. A differential 
amplifier cancels out activity that is common to both electrodes. 
For example, 60 Hz noise from lights or electrical fi xtures is quite 
large in amplitude in comparison to the auditory evoked potential. 
This noise will be seen identically at both the vertex and the earlobe 
electrodes. The differential amplifi er takes the activity measured at 
the earlobe, inverts it, and adds it to the activity measured at the 
vertex. If the activity is identical or common to both electrodes, it 
will be eliminated. This process is shown in Figure 9-2. So the fi rst 
step in the process of extracting the auditory evoked potential is to 
The difference in dB between 
a sound of interest and 
background noise is called 
the signal-to-noise ratio.
Common-mode rejection 
is a noise-rejection strategy 
used in electrophysiologic 
measurement in which 
noise that is identical at two 
electrodes is subtracted by a 
differential ampliﬁ er.

differentially amplify in a way that eliminates some of the potential 
background noise. The remaining electrical activity is then ampli-
fi ed signifi cantly, up to 100,000 times its original voltage.
The next step in reducing electrical noise not related to the 
auditory evoked potential is to filter the EEG activity. Electrical 
potentials that emanate from the structures of the brain cover 
a wide range of  frequencies. For each of  the auditory evoked 
potentials, we are interested in only a narrow band of frequencies 
surrounding those that are characteristic of that evoked potential. 
For example, the auditory brainstem response has five major 
peaks of interest, referred to as waves I through V, which occur 
about 1 msec apart. Any waveform that repeats every 1 msec has 
a frequency component of 1000 Hz. Similarly, the largest peaks 
of the ABR are I, III, and V, which occur at 2 msec intervals. Any 
waveform that repeats every 2 msec has a frequency component 
of  500 Hz. As a result, the ABR has two major frequency 
components, approximately 500 and 1000 Hz. By filtering, 
electrical activity that occurs above and below these frequencies 
is reduced in a further effort to focus on the response of interest. 
Even after differentially amplifying the signal and fi ltering around 
the frequencies of interest, the auditory evoked responses remain 
buried in a background of ongoing electrical activity of the brain. 
It is only through signal averaging of  the response that these 
potentials can be effectively extracted.
Signal Averaging
Signal averaging is a technique that extracts a signal from a 
background of noise. The signal that we are pursuing here is a 
small electrical potential that is buried in a background of ongo-
ing electrical activity of the brain. The purpose of signal averag-
ing is to eliminate the unrelated activity and reveal the auditory 
evoked potential.
Signal averaging is a computer-based technique in which multiple 
samples of electrical activity are taken over a fi xed time base. A key 
component of the signal averaging process is time-locking of the 
signal presentation to the recording of the response. That is, a stim-
ulus is delivered to the earphone at the same moment in time that 
electrical activity is recorded from the electrodes. The sequence is 
The averaging of samples 
of EEG activity designed 
to enhance the response is 
called signal averaging.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  363
then repeated. For example, when recording an ABR, a click stimu-
lus is presented, and the electrical activity is recorded for 10 msec 
following stimulus onset. Another click is then presented, and an-
other 10 msec segment of electrical activity is recorded. This pro-
cess is repeated 1000 to 2000 times.
The segment of time that is designated for electrical-activity re-
cording is sometimes referred to as an epoch, after the Greek word 
meaning a period of  time. Some prefer a more common term 
such as window to describe the time segments. The number of 
time segments that are signal averaged are often referred to as 
samples or sweeps.
During each sampling period, the EEG activity is preamplified, 
filtered, and amplified. It is then converted from its analog (A) 
form to digital (D) form by analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion. 
Essentially, the A/D converter is activated at the same instant 
that the stimulus is delivered to the earphone. The A/D converter 
samples the amplifier and converts the amplitude of  the EEG 
activity at that moment in time to a number. The converter 
then dwells momentarily and samples again. This continues for 
the duration of  the sample. The process is then repeated for a 
predetermined number of samples. In the case of the ABR, 1000 
to 2000 samples are collected and then averaged.
The averaging process is critical to measuring evoked potentials. 
The concept is a fairly simple one. EEG activity that is not related 
to the auditory stimulus is being measured at the electrodes along 
with the EEG activity that is related to the stimulus. This activ-
ity is expressed in microvolts and will appear as either positive or 
negative voltage, centering around 0 μV. The unrelated activity 
is much larger in amplitude, but it is occurring randomly with 
regard to the stimulus onset. The related activity is much smaller, 
but it is time-locked to the stimulus. Therefore, over a large num-
ber of samples, the randomly occurring activity will be averaged 
out to near 0 μV. That is, if the activity is random, it is as likely to 
have a positive voltage as a negative voltage. Averaging enough 
samples of random activity will result in an average that is nearly 
zero. Alternatively, if a response is occurring to the presentation 
of the signal, that response will occur each time and will begin 
to add to itself with each successive sample. In this way, any true 
Microvolts = μV 

364  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
auditory activity that is time-locked to the stimulus will begin to 
emerge from the background of random EEG. Figure 9-3 shows 
the concept of signal averaging. Here, sequential ABRs are shown 
that were collected with progressively greater numbers of sam-
ples. As the number of samples increases, the noise is reduced, 
and the waveform becomes increasingly apparent.
The result of all of this signal averaging will be a waveform that 
refl ects activity of auditory nervous system structures. The wave-
form has a series of identifi able positive and negative peaks that 
serve as landmarks for interpreting the normalcy of a response.
The Family of Auditory Evoked Potentials
For audiologic purposes, it is convenient to group the transient 
auditory evoked potentials into four categories, based loosely on 
the latency ranges over which the potentials are observed. The 
earliest is the ECoG, and it refl ects activity of the most peripheral 
structures of the auditory system. The remaining three catego-
ries are often labeled as early, middle, and late. These responses

measure neural function at successively higher levels in the audi-
tory nervous system.
Electrocochleogram
The ECoG is a response comprised mainly of the compound  action 
potential (AP) that occurs at the distal portion of  the VIIIth 
nerve (Figure 9-4). A click stimulus is used to elicit this response. 
The rapid onset of the click provides a stimulus that is suffi cient 
to cause the fi bers of the VIIIth nerve to fi re in synchrony. This 
synchronous discharge of nerve fibers results in the AP. There 
are two other, smaller components of the ECoG. One is referred 
to as the cochlear microphonic (CM), which is a response from 
the cochlea that mimics the input stimulus. The other is the 
summating potential (SP), which is a direct current response that 
refl ects the envelope of the input stimulus.
The ECoG is best recorded as a near-field response, with an 
electrode close to the source. Unlike the ABR, MLR, LLR, and 
ASSR, which can readily be recorded as far-fi eld responses with 
remote electrodes, it is more difficult to record the ECoG from 
surface electrodes. Thus, the best recordings of the ECoG are made 
from electrodes that are placed, invasively, through the tympanic 
membrane and onto the promontory of the temporal bone. An 
alternative arrangement is the use of an electrode in the ear canal 
placed near the tympanic membrane. Regardless, because of

the relatively invasive nature of this technique and because the 
ECoG measures only the most peripheral function of the auditory 
system, its clinical use remains limited to a small number of 
specialized diagnostic applications. However, it has proven to be 
a very useful response for monitoring cochlear function in the 
operating room where electrode placement is simplifi ed.
Auditory Brainstem Response
The ABR occurs within the fi rst 10 msec following signal onset 
and consists of a series of five positive peaks or waves. An ABR 
waveform is shown in Figure 9-5. The ABR has properties that 
make it very useful clinically:
the response can be recorded from surface electrodes;
• 
the waves are robust and can be recorded easily in patients 
• 
with adequate hearing and normal auditory nervous system 
function;
the response is immune to the infl uences of patient state, so 
• 
that it can be recorded in patients who are sleeping, sedated, 
comatose, etc.;
the latencies of the various waves are quite stable within 
• 
and across people, so that they serve as a sensitive measure 
of brainstem integrity;
the time intervals between peaks are prolonged by auditory 
• 
disorders central to the cochlea, which makes the ABR 
useful for differentiating cochlear from retrocochlear sites 
of disorder; and
the most robust component, wave V, can be observed at lev-
• 
els very close to behavioral thresholds so that it can be used 
effectively to estimate hearing sensitivity in infants, young 
children, and other diffi cult-to-test patients.
The ABR is generated by the auditory nerve and by structures in 
the auditory brainstem. Wave I originates in the distal, or periph-
eral, portion of the VIIIth nerve near the point at which the nerve 
fi bers leave the cochlea. Wave II originates from the proximal por-
tion of the nerve near the brainstem. Wave III has contribution 
from this proximal portion of the nerve and from the cochlear 
nucleus. Waves IV and V have contributions from the cochlear 
nucleus, superior olivary complex, and lateral lemniscus.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  367
Middle Latency Response
The middle latency response (MLR) is characterized by two succes-
sive positive peaks, the fi rst (Pa) at about 25 to 35 msec and the 
second (Pb) at about 40 to 60 msec following stimulus presenta-
tion. The MLR is probably generated by some combination of pro-
jections to the primary auditory cortex and the cortical area itself.

368  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
Although the MLR is the most diffi cult AEP to record in clinical 
patients, it is sometimes used diagnostically and as an aid to the 
identifi cation of auditory processing disorder.
Late Latency Response
The late latency response (LLR) is characterized by a negative peak 
(N1) at a latency of  about 90 msec followed by a positive peak 
(P2) at about 180 msec following stimulus presentation. This 
potential is greatly affected by subject state. It is best recorded 
when the patient is awake and carefully attending to the sounds 
being presented. There is an important developmental effect on 
the LLR during the fi rst 8 to 10 years of  age. In older children 
or adults, however, it is robust and relatively easy to record. In 
children or adults with relatively normal hearing sensitivity, ab-
normality or absence of the LLR is associated with auditory pro-
cessing disorder.
Auditory Steady-State Response
The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is an auditory 
evoked potential, elicited with modulated tones that can be used 
to predict hearing sensitivity in patients of all ages (Dimitrijevic 
et al., 2002; Rance & Rickards, 2002). The response itself is an 
evoked neural potential that follows the envelope of  a complex 
stimulus. It is evoked by the periodic modulation of a tone. The 
neural response is a brain potential that closely follows the time 
course of  the modulation. The response can be detected objec-
tively at intensity levels close to behavioral threshold. The ASSR 
can yield a clinically acceptable, frequency-specifi c prediction 
of behavioral thresholds.
The ASSR is elicited by a tone. In clinical applications, the fre-
quencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz are commonly used. 
The pure tone is either modulated in the amplitude domain or 
modulated in both the amplitude and frequency domains; you 
might think of amplitude modulation as turning the tone on and 
off  periodically and frequency modulation as warbling it. The 
concept of  modulation is shown in Figure 9-6. Electrodes are 
placed on the scalp at locations typical for the recording of other 
auditory evoked potentials. Brain electrical activity is preampli-
fi ed, fi ltered, sampled, and then subjected to automated analysis. 

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  369
The frequency of interest in the brain waves is that corresponding 
to the modulation rate. For example, when a tone of any frequency 
is modulated periodically at a rate of 90/s, the 90 Hz component 
of the brain electrical activity is measured. Measurement is of the

amplitude or variability of the phase of the EEG component to see 
if it is “following” the modulation envelope. When the modulated 
tone is at an intensity above threshold, the brain activity at the 
modulation rate is enhanced and time-locked to the modulation. 
If the tone is below a patient’s threshold, the brain activity is not 
enhanced and is random in relation to the modulation.
The ASSR has several properties that make it useful clinically:
If the modulation rate is high enough (over 60/s), the ASSR 
• 
response is present and readily measurable in newborns, 
sleeping infants, and sedated babies.
The stimulus is a tone that is only slightly distorted by mod-
• 
ulation, so it can be useful in predicting an audiogram.
The tone can be presented at high intensity levels, which 
• 
makes the ASSR useful in predicting hearing of patients 
with severe and profound hearing loss.
The response is periodic in nature and can therefore be 
• 
objectively detected by the computer.
Taken as a whole, this family of evoked potentials is quite versatile. 
The ABR, ASSR, and LLR can be used to estimate auditory sensitivity 
independently of behavioral response. In addition, ABR can be used 
to differentiate cochlear from retrocochlear site of disorder. Finally, 
the array of ABR, MLR, and LLR is an effective tool for exploring 
auditory processing disorders.
Clinical Applications
Evoked potentials are used for several purposes in evaluat-
ing the auditory system. Because early evoked potentials can 
be recorded without regard to subject state of  consciousness, 
they have become an invaluable part of  pediatric assessment. 
The ABR is now used routinely to screen the hearing of  babies 
who are at risk for hearing loss. The ABR and ASSR are used 
to assess the degree of  hearing loss in those who have failed a 
screening or are otherwise at risk for hearing loss. The ABR also 
provides a window for viewing the function of  the brain’s re-
sponse to sound, which has proven to be useful in the diagnostic 
assessment of neurologic function. Finally, auditory evoked po-
tentials can be recorded during surgery to provide a functional

measure of  structural changes that occur during VIIIth nerve 
tumor removal.
Prediction of Hearing Sensitivity
The audiologist is faced with two challenges that often require the 
use of auditory evoked potentials to predict hearing sensitivity. 
The main challenge is trying to measure the hearing sensitivity 
of infants or young children who cannot or will not cooperate 
enough to permit assessment by behavioral techniques. The other 
challenge is assessing hearing sensitivity in older individuals who 
are feigning or exaggerating some degree of hearing impairment. 
Regardless, the goal of testing is to obtain an electrophysiologic 
prediction of both degree and slope of hearing loss.

372  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
The process in hearing-sensitivity prediction is simply determin-
ing the lowest intensity level at which an auditory evoked poten-
tial can be identifi ed. Click or tone-burst stimuli are presented at 
an intensity level that evokes a response. The level is then lowered, 
and the response is tracked until an intensity is reached at which 
the response is no longer observable (Figure 9-7). This level cor-
responds closely to behavioral threshold.
Evaluation of infants and young children must be carried out in 
natural sleep or with sedation. Thus, testing is best accomplished 
with use of the ABR or ASSR, which are not affected by patient 
state. There are several approaches that can used to predict an 
audiogram. The goal is to predict both the degree and slope of the 
hearing loss. Audiologists will often use click-evoked ABR thresh-
olds to estimate higher frequency hearing in the 2000 to 4000 Hz 
region of the audiogram and tone-burst ABR to estimate lower 
frequency hearing. For example, once an ABR click threshold has 
been established, an ABR tone-burst threshold at 500 or 1000 Hz 
can be obtained. If time permits, of course, tone-burst ABR thresh-
olds can be obtained across the frequency range. The accompany-
ing Clinical Note describes a clinical technique for rapid estimation 
of thresholds with the ABR.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  373
A Rapid Approach to Threshold 
Prediction
When testing young children, the challenge is 
simple: get as much information as you can as 
quickly as possible before the baby wakes up 
from natural sleep or before the sedation wears 
off. Many a clinician has been caught with only 
partial ABR information about one ear when 
a child awakened. No one wants to repeat the 
pediatric ABR procedure, especially if sedation is 
involved. Clinical techniques designed for rapid 
assessment are important in this population.
One technique that works particularly well is 
the binaural approach to ABR threshold predic-
tion. The idea here is simple. If you establish an 
ABR threshold with clicks presented to both ears 
and the baby wakes up, at least you know the 
hearing of the better-hearing ear. For example, 
suppose that a child has no cochlear function in 
the left ear, but the right ear is normal. The bin-
aural ABR threshold search will yield a prediction 
of normal hearing because of responses from 
the good right ear. If the baby wakes up at that 
point, you at least know how the better-hearing 
ear is functioning. If you had the misfortune of 
testing the left ear fi rst, you would still prob-
ably be searching for a threshold when the baby 
awakened, and you would have learned little 
about the baby’s overall hearing ability.
Once you have established the binaural threshold, 
the next step is to test each ear independently at 
10 to 20 dB above the binaural threshold. If the 
waveforms are present and symmetric, you are 
fi nished testing. If responses are obtained in only

Another approach to audiogram estimation in infants and young 
children is the use of ASSR. With this technique, tonal thresholds 
can be estimated across the audiometric frequencies. An example of 
threshold estimation with ASSR in an infant is shown in Figure 9-9. 
At each frequency, an ASSR threshold is established by determining 
the lowest level at which a response can be detected. A correction

one ear, then the binaural threshold refl ects that 
ear, and you can spend the rest of your time pur-
suing threshold in the other ear.
An example of the binaural approach is shown in 
Figure 9-8. You can learn a lot about a child’s hear-
ing in a short period of time using this approach.

factor is then applied to predict the audiometric threshold. ASSR 
may provide a more accurate estimation of the confi guration of a 
hearing loss than tone-burst ABR because of the nature of the sig-
nal used. This is because a modulated tone usually has a narrower 
spectrum than a tone-burst, thus providing a more frequency-
specifi c audiometric prediction.
Evaluation of  older patients is probably best accomplished 
by use of  the late latency response to tonal stimuli. A typical 
strategy is to determine LLR thresholds to tonal stimuli across 
the audiometric frequency range. A response is usually identifi ed 
at some suprathreshold level and then tracked as the intensity 
level is lowered until the response can no longer be identified 
(Figure 9-10). This level is considered threshold and corresponds 
well with behavioral thresholds. LLR testing is relatively time

consuming, and some clinicians opt for using a combined 
approach wherein click ABR thresholds are used to predict high-
frequency hearing and ASSR or LLR thresholds to predict low-
frequency hearing.
Infant Hearing Screening
The goal of  infant hearing screening is to categorize auditory 
function as either normal or abnormal in order to identify infants 
who have signifi cant permanent hearing loss. By screening hear-
ing, those with normal auditory function are eliminated from fur-
ther consideration, and those with a suspicion of hearing loss are 
referred for clinical testing.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  377
The ABR is the evoked-potential method of choice for infant hear-
ing screening (for a review, see Sininger, 2007). Surface electrodes 
are used to record the ABR and can easily be affi xed to the infant’s 
scalp. Because of its immunity to subject state, the ABR can be 
recorded reliably in sleeping neonates.
A typical screening strategy is to present click stimuli at a fi xed 
intensity level, usually 30 to 40 dB, and determine whether a reli-
able response can be recorded. If an ABR is present, the child is 
likely to have normal or nearly normal hearing sensitivity in the 
1000 to 4000 Hz frequency region of the audiogram. The under-
lying assumption here is that such hearing is suffi cient for speech 
and oral language development and that children who pass the 
screening are at low risk for developing communication disorders 
due to hearing loss. If an ABR is absent, it is concluded that the 
child is at risk for signifi cant sensorineural hearing loss and fur-
ther audiologic assessment is warranted.
Conventional ABR testing of infants has been largely replaced by 
automated ABR testing. The driving force behind the development 
of automated testing is that the number of babies who require 
screening far exceeds the highly skilled personnel available to carry 
out conventional ABR measures. One commonly used automated 
screener is designed to present click stimuli at fi xed intensity levels, 
record ABR tracings, and compare the recorded tracings to a tem-
plate that represents expected results in infants. The system was 
designed with several fail-safe mechanisms that halt testing in the 
presence of excessive environmental or physiologic noise. When all 
conditions are favorable, the device proceeds with testing until it 
reaches a decision regarding the presence of an ABR. It then alerts 
the screener as to whether the infant has passed or needs to be re-
ferred for additional testing. This automated system has proven to 
be a valid and reliable way to screen the hearing of infants.
In the early days of newborn screening, ABR testing was restricted 
largely to those infants in the intensive care nursery (ICN), where 
the prevalence of auditory disorder is much higher than in the 
newborn population in general. Although children in the ICN are 
at increased risk for hearing loss, estimates suggest that risk factors 
alone identify only about one half of all children with signifi cant 
sensorineural hearing loss. As a result, screening is now carried

378  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
out on all newborns in many countries, regardless of whether the 
infant is in the regular care nursery or the ICN. Automated ABR 
strategies are an integral part of the comprehensive screening 
process and are often used in conjunction with otoacoustic-
emissions screening for identifi cation purposes.
Two variables unrelated to signifi cant sensorineural hearing loss 
can interfere with correct identifi cation of these infants. One is the 
presence of middle-ear disorder that is causing conductive hear-
ing loss. If the loss is of a suffi cient magnitude, the infant may fail 
the screening and be referred for additional testing. The other is 
neuromaturational delay or disorder that results in an abnormal 
ABR. That is, some children’s brainstem function has not matured 
to a point, or is disordered to an extent, that it cannot be measured 
adequately to provide an estimate of hearing sensitivity. These 
children will also fail the screening and be referred for additional 
testing. Although their problems may be important, they are con-
sidered false-alarms from the perspective of identifying signifi cant 
sensorineural hearing loss. In these cases, follow-up services are 
important to identify normal cochlear function as soon as possible 
following discharge from the hospital.
The opposite problem, failure to identify a child with signifi cant 
hearing loss, or false negative, is seldom an issue with ABR test-
ing. If it does occur, it is usually in children who have reverse-slope 
hearing loss, wherein low-frequency hearing is poorer than high-
frequency hearing. The click stimulus used in ABR measurement 
is effective in assessing higher audiometric frequencies. Thus, an 
infant with normal high-frequency hearing and abnormal low-
frequency hearing would likely pass the screening, and the loss 
would go undetected. Such losses are rare and are considered to 
have minimal impact on communication development. Thus, the 
failure to identify these children, although important, is a small 
cost in comparison to the value of identifying those with signifi -
cant high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss.
Diagnostic Applications
One of the most important applications of evoked potentials is in 
the area of diagnosis of disorders of the peripheral and central 
auditory nervous system (for a review, see Musiek et al., 2007). 
Neuromaturational 
delay occurs when a 
nervous system function has 
not developed as rapidly as 
normal.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  379
In fact, at one time in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the ABR 
was probably the most sensitive diagnostic tool available for iden-
tifying the presence of VIIIth nerve tumors. However, imaging 
and radiographic assessment of structural changes has advanced 
to a point where functional measures such as the ABR have lost 
some of their sensitivity and, thus, importance. That is, imaging 
studies have permitted the visualization of ever smaller lesions 
in the brain. Sometimes the lesions are of a small enough size or 
are in such a location that they result in little or no measurable 
functional consequence. Thus, measures of function, such as the 
ABR, may not detect their presence. Although this trend has been 
occurring over the past several decades, evoked potentials are still 
used for diagnostic testing, often for screening purposes.
The ABR is a sensitive indicator of  functional disorders of  the 
VIIIth nerve and lower auditory brainstem. It is often the first 
test of choice if such a disorder is suspected. For example, a coch-
leovestibular schwannoma is a tumor that develops on the VIIIth 
nerve. A patient with a cochleovestibular schwannoma will often 
complain of tinnitus, hearing loss, or both, in the ear with the tu-
mor. Based on audiometric data and a physical examination, fur-
ther testing to rule out this tumor may be pursued. It is likely that 
the physician who is making the diagnosis will request a magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, which is sensitive in 
identifying these space-occupying lesions. However, depending on 
the level of suspicion of a tumor, ABR testing may be carried out 
as a screening tool to decide on further imaging studies or as an 
adjunct to these studies. These basic strategies also apply to other 
types of disorders that affect the VIIIth nerve or auditory brain-
stem, such as multiple sclerosis or brainstem neoplasms.
The ABR component waves, especially waves I, III, and V are eas-
ily recordable and are very reliable in terms of their latency. For 
example, depending on the equipment and recording parameters, 
we expect to see a wave I at about 2 msec following signal presen-
tation, a wave III at 4 msec, and a wave V at 6 msec. Although 
these absolute numbers will vary across clinics, the latencies are 
quite stable across individuals. The I-V interpeak interval in most 
adults is approximately 4 msec, and the standard deviation of this 
interval is about 0.2 msec. Thus, 95% of  the adult population 

380  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
have I-V interpeak intervals of 4.4 or less. If the I-V interval ex-
ceeds this amount, it can be considered abnormal.
These latency measures are amazingly consistent across the popula-
tion. In newborns, they are prolonged compared to adult values, but 
in a reasonably predictable way. Once a child reaches 18 months, 
we expect normal adult latency values that continue throughout 
life. Because of the consistency of latencies within an individual 
over time and across individuals in the population, we can rely con-
fi dently on assessment of latency as an indicator of integrity of the 
VIIIth nerve and auditory brainstem. The decision about whether 
an ABR is normal is usually based on the following considerations:
interaural difference in I-V interpeak interval,
• 
I-V interpeak interval,
• 
interaural difference in wave V latency,
• 
absolute latency of wave V,
• 
interaural differences in V/I amplitude ratio,
• 
V/I amplitude ratio,
• 
selective loss of late waves, and
• 
grossly degraded waveform 
• 
morphology.
Again, the ABR is used to assess integrity of the VIIIth nerve and 
auditory brainstem in patients who are suspected of having acous-
tic tumor or other neurologic disorders. In interpreting ABRs, we 
exploit the consistency of the response across individuals and ask 
whether our measured latencies compare well between ears and 
with the population in general. With this strategy, the ABR has 
become a useful adjunct in diagnosis of neurological disease.
The MLR and LLR are less useful than the ABR in identifying dis-
crete lesions. Sometimes the infl uence of an acoustic tumor that af-
fects the ABR will also affect the MLR. Also, sometimes a cerebral 
vascular accident or other type of discrete insult to the brain will 
result in an abnormality in the MLR. However, these measures have 
tended to be more useful as indicators of generalized disorders of 
auditory processing ability than in the diagnosis of a specifi c disease 
process. For example, MLRs and LLRs have been found to be abnor-
mal in patients with multiple sclerosis (Stach & Hudson, 1990) and 
Parkinson’s disease. Although neither response has proven to be

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  381
particularly useful in helping to diagnose these disorders, the fact 
that MLR and LLR abnormalities occur has proven to be valuable 
in describing the resultant auditory disorders. That is, patients with 
neurologic disorders often have auditory complaints that cannot 
be measured on an audiogram or with simple speech audiometric 
measures. The MLR and LLR are sometimes helpful in quantifying 
such auditory complaints.
Surgical Monitoring
Auditory evoked potentials are also useful in monitoring the func-
tion of the cochlea and VIIIth nerve during surgical removal of a 
tumor on or near the nerve (for a review, see Martin & Yong-bing 
Shi, 2007). Surgery for removal of acoustic tumors often results 
in permanent loss of hearing due to the need to remove the co-
chlea to reach the tumor. If the tumor is small enough, however, a 
different surgical approach can be used that may spare hearing in 
that ear. During this latter type of surgery, monitoring of auditory 
function can be very helpful to the surgeon.
During surgical removal of an acoustic tumor or other mass that 
impinges on the VIIIth nerve, hearing is quite vulnerable. One po-
tential problem is that the blood supply to the cochlea can be in-
terrupted. Another is that the tumor can be intertwined with the 
nerve, resulting in damage to or severing of the nerve during tu-
mor removal. Sometimes, however, hearing can be spared by care-
fully monitoring the nerve during the course of such a surgery.
Auditory evoked potential monitoring involves measurement of the 
compound action potential (AP) of the VIIIth nerve. This is the ma-
jor component of the ECoG and corresponds to wave I of the ABR. 
The AP is usually measured using one of two approaches, ECoG or 
cochlear nerve action potential (CNAP) measures. Both approaches 
measure essentially the same function. The ECoG approach uses 
a needle electrode that is placed on the promontory outside of the 
cochlea. The CNAP approach uses a ball electrode that is placed di-
rectly on the VIIIth nerve. In either case, click stimuli are presented 
to the ear throughout surgery, and the latency and amplitude of 
the AP are assessed. Because the recording electrode is so close to 
the source of the potential, especially in the case of CNAP measure-
ment, the function of the cochlea and VIIIth nerve can be assessed 

382  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
rapidly, providing valuable feedback to the surgeon about the effects 
of tumor manipulation or other surgical actions.
SUMMARY
An auditory evoked potential is a waveform that refl ects the 
• 
electrophysiologic function of a certain portion of the cen-
tral auditory nervous system in response to sound.
For audiologic purposes, it is convenient to group the AEPs 
• 
into categories based loosely on the latency ranges over 
which the potentials are observed.
The earliest of the evoked potentials, occurring within the 
• 
fi rst 5 msec following signal presentation, is referred to as 
an electrocochleogram (ECoG) and refl ects activity of the 
cochlea and VIIIth nerve.
The most commonly used evoked potential is referred to as 
• 
the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and occurs within the 
fi rst 10 msec following signal onset. The ABR refl ects neural 
activity from the VIIIth nerve to the midbrain.
The middle latency response (MLR) occurs within the fi rst 
• 
50 msec following signal onset and refl ects activity at or 
near the auditory cortex.
The late latency response (LLR) occurs within the fi rst 
• 
250 msec following signal onset and refl ects activity of the 
primary-auditory and association areas of the cerebral cortex.
The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is measured by 
• 
evaluating the ongoing activity of the brain in response to a 
modulation, or change, in an ongoing stimulus. The ASSR 
refl ects activity from different portions of the brain, depend-
ing on the modulation rate used.
One of the most important applications of auditory evoked 
• 
potentials is the prediction of hearing sensitivity in infants 
and young children.
The ABR is the evoked-potential method of choice for infant 
• 
hearing screening.
Another important application of evoked potentials is the 
• 
diagnosis of disorders of the peripheral and central auditory 
nervous system.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  383
Auditory evoked potentials are also useful in monitoring the 
• 
function of the cochlea and VIIIth nerve during surgical re-
moval of a tumor on or near the nerve.
OTOACOUSTIC EMISSIONS
We tend to think of  sensory systems as somewhat passive re-
ceivers of information that detect and process incoming signals 
and send corresponding neural signals to the cortex. We know 
that sound impinges on the tympanic membrane, setting the 
middle-ear ossicles in motion. The stapes footplate, in turn, cre-
ates a disturbance of  the fl uid in the scala vestibuli, resulting 
in a traveling wave of  motion that displaces the basilar mem-
brane maximally at a point corresponding to the frequency of 
the signal. The active processes of the outer hair cells are stimu-
lated, translating the broadly tuned traveling wave into a nar-
rowly tuned potentiation of the inner hair cells. Inner hair cells, 
in turn, create neural impulses that travel through the VIIIth 
nerve and beyond.
The active processes of the outer hair cells make this sensory sys-
tem somewhat more complicated than a passive receiver of infor-
mation. These outer hair cells are stimulated in a manner that 
causes them to act on the signal that stimulates them. One by-
product of that action is the production of a sound, which travels 
back out of the cochlea, through the middle ear, and into the ear 
canal. This sound is referred to as an otoacoustic emission or OAE 
(Kemp, 1978).
Otoacoustic emissions are low-intensity sounds that are generated 
by the cochlea and emanate into the middle ear and ear canal. 
They are frequency specifi c in that emissions of a given frequency 
arise from the place on the cochlea’s basilar membrane respon-
sible for processing that frequency. OAEs are probably not essen-
tial to hearing, but rather are the by-product of active processing 
by the outer hair cell system. Of clinical interest is that OAEs are 
present when outer hair cells are healthy and absent when outer 
hair cells are damaged. Thus, OAE measures have tremendous 
potential for revealing, with exquisite sensitivity, the integrity of 
cochlear function.

384  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
Types of Otoacoustic Emissions
There are two broad categories of otoacoustic emissions, sponta-
neous OAEs (SOAEs) and evoked OAEs (EOAEs) (for an overview, 
see Lonsbury-Martin et al., 1993; Robinette & Glattke, 1997; 
Hall, 2000).
Spontaneous Otoacoustic Emissions
Spontaneous OAEs are narrow-band signals that occur in the ear 
canal without the introduction of an eliciting signal. Spontaneous 
emissions are present in 50 to 70% of all normal-hearing ears and 
absent in all ears at frequencies where sensorineural hearing loss 
exceeds approximately 30 dB (Penner et al., 1993). It appears that 
spontaneous OAEs originate from outer hair cells corresponding 
to that portion of the basilar membrane tuned to their frequency.
A sensitive, low-noise microphone housed in a probe is used to 
record spontaneous OAEs. The probe is secured into the external 
auditory meatus with some type of fl exible cuff. Signals detected 
by the microphone are routed to a spectrum analyzer, which is 
a device that provides real-time frequency analysis of the signal. 
Usually the frequency range of  interest is swept several times, 
and the results are signal averaged to reduce background noise. 
Spontaneous OAEs, when they occur, appear as peaks of energy 
along the frequency spectrum.
Because spontaneous OAEs are absent in many ears with normal 
hearing, clinical applications have not been forthcoming. Efforts 
to relate SOAEs to tinnitus have revealed a relationship in some, 
but not many, subjects who have both. Other clinical applications 
await development. Evoked OAEs, in contrast, enjoy widespread 
clinical use.
Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions
Evoked OAEs occur during and after the presentation of a stimu-
lus. That is, an EOAE is elicited by a stimulus. There are several 
classes of evoked OAEs, two of which have proven to be useful 
clinically, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and 
distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE).
TEOAEs are elicited by a transient signal or click. A schematic repre-
sentation of the instrumentation used to elicit a TEOAE is shown in 

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  385
Figure 9-11. A probe is used to deliver the click signal and to record 
the response. The probe is secured into the external auditory meatus 
with some type of fl exible cuff. Series of click stimuli are presented, 
usually at an intensity level of about 80–85 dB SPL. Output from 
the microphone is signal averaged, usually within a time window of 
20 msec. In a typical clinical paradigm, alternating samples of the 
emission are placed into separate memory locations, so that the fi nal 
result includes two traces of the response for comparison purposes.
TEOAEs occur about 4 msec following stimulus presentation 
and continue for about 10 msec. An example of  a TEOAE is 
shown in Figure 9-12. Depicted here are two replications of

the signal-averaged emission, designated as A and B. Because a 
click is a broad-spectrum signal, the response is similarly broad 
in spectrum. By convention, these waveforms are subjected to 
spectral analysis, the results of which are often shown in a graph 
depicting the amplitude-versus-frequency components of  the 
emission. Also by convention, an estimate of  the background 
noise is made by subtracting waveform A from waveform B, 
and a spectral analysis of  the resultant waveform is plotted on 
the same graph. Another important aspect of  TEOAE analysis 
is the reproducibility of  the response. An estimate is made of 
how similar A is to B by correlating the two waveforms. This 
similarity or reproducibility is then expressed as a percentage, 
with 100% being identical. If  the magnitude of  the emission 
exceeds the magnitude of the noise and if the reproducibility of 
the emission exceeds a predetermined level, then the emission 
is said to be present. If  an emission is present, it is likely that 
the outer hair cells are functioning in the frequency region of 
the emission.
Distortion-product OAEs occur as a result of  nonlinear pro-
cesses in the cochlea. When two tones are presented to the 
cochlea, distortion occurs in the form of  other tones that are 
not present in the two-tone eliciting signals. These distortions 
are combination tones that are related to the eliciting tones in 
a predictable mathematical way. The two tones used to elicit 
the DPOAE are, by convention, designated f1 and f2. The most 
robust distortion product occurs at the frequency represented 
by the equation 2f1 – f2. A schematic representation of  the in-
strumentation used to elicit a DPOAE is shown in Figure 9-13. 
As with TEOAEs, a probe is used to deliver the tone pairs and to 
record the response. The probe is secured into the external au-
ditory meatus with a fl exible cuff. Pairs of  tones are presented 
across the frequency range to elicit distortion products from ap-
proximately 1000 to 6000 Hz. The tone pairs that are presented 
are at a fi xed frequency and intensity relationship. Typically, the 
pairs are presented from high frequency to low frequency. As 
each pair is presented, measurements are made at the 2f1 – f2 
frequency to determine the amplitude of  the DPOAE and also 
at a nearby frequency to provide an estimate of  the noise fl oor 
at that moment in time. An example of  a DPOAE is shown in 
Figure 9-14.

DPOAEs are typically depicted as the amplitude of  the distor-
tion product (2f1 – f2) as a function of  frequency of  the f2 tone 
(Figure 9-15). The shaded area in this fi gure represents the es-
timate of background noise. If the amplitude exceeds the back-
ground noise, the emission is said to be present. If an emission 
is present, it is likely that the outer hair cells are functioning in 
the frequency region of the f2 tone.
Results of TEOAE and DPOAE testing provide a measure of the 
integrity of outer hair cell function. Both approaches have been 
successfully applied clinically as objective indicators of cochlear 
function. TEOAEs are likely to be used when rapid assessment is 
necessary, such as in infant hearing screening. DPOAEs are also 
used in infant testing and when frequency information is impor-
tant, such as during the monitoring of cochlear function.
Relation to Hearing Sensitivity
Assuming normal outer- and middle-ear function, OAEs can be 
consistently recorded in patients with normal hearing sensitivity. 
Once outer hair cells of the cochlea sustain damage, OAEs begin 
to be affected. A rule of thumb for comparing OAEs to hearing 
thresholds is that OAEs are present if thresholds are better than

about 30 dB HL and absent if thresholds are poorer than 30 dB 
HL. Although this varies among individuals, it holds generally 
enough to be a useful clinical guide (Probst & Harris, 1993).
OAEs are present if hearing thresholds are normal and disappear 
as hearing thresholds become poorer. As a result, OAEs tend to be 
used for screening of cochlear function rather than for prediction 
of degree of hearing sensitivity. Efforts to predict degree of loss have 
probably been most successful with use of DPOAEs (Gorga et al., 
1997). In general, though, they tell us more about the degree of 
hearing loss that a patient does not have than about the degree of loss 
that a patient has. For example, if a patient has a DPOAE amplitude 
of 10 dB SPL at 1000 Hz, it is likely that hearing sensitivity loss at 
that frequency does not exceed 20 dB HL. Although this information 
is quite useful, the absence of an OAE reveals little about degree 
of loss. Recent efforts to harness OAE technology to provide more 
information about hearing loss prediction have been encouraging, 
particularly with the use of  DPOAEs. If  patients have normal 
hearing or mild sensitivity loss, thresholds can be predicted with a 
fair degree of accuracy. However, presently OAEs are not generally 
applied as threshold tests.
Clinical Applications
OAEs are useful in at least four clinical areas:
 1. infant screening,
 2. pediatric assessment,
 3. cochlear function monitoring, and
 4. certain diagnostic cases.
Infant Screening
OAEs are used most effectively as a screening measure and have 
been used in infant screening programs (Maxon et al., 1995). 
Several test characteristics make OAEs particularly useful for this 
clinical application. First, the very nature of OAEs makes the tech-
nique an excellent one for screening. When present, OAEs provide 
an indicator of normal cochlear function or, at most, a mild sensi-
tivity loss. When absent, OAEs provide an indicator that cochlear 
function is not normal, although degree of abnormality cannot be 
assessed. Second, measurement techniques have been simplifi ed 

390  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
to an extent that screening can be carried out simply and rapidly. 
Third, OAEs are not affected by neuromaturation of the central 
auditory nervous system and can be obtained in newborns re-
gardless of gestational age.
There are two drawbacks to OAE use in infant screening. One is 
that outer- and middle-ear disorders often preclude measurement 
of an OAE. Thus, if an infant’s ear canal is obstructed or if the 
infant has middle-ear effusion, OAEs will not be recorded even 
though cochlear function may be normal. This results in a large 
number of false-positive errors, in that children who have nor-
mal hearing fail the screening. Perhaps an even greater drawback 
is one related to false-negative errors, or those infants who have 
signifi cant sensorineural disorder but who pass the OAE screen-
ing. These are infants who have significant permanent hearing 
loss due to inner hair cell disorder or auditory neuropathy. In both 
cases, outer hair cells may be functioning, producing OAEs, even 
though the child has a signifi cant loss in hearing sensitivity. For 
these reasons, OAE screening is usually done in combination with 
ABR screening rather than as the only screening technique.
Pediatric Assessment
One of  the most important applications of  OAEs is as an addi-
tional part of the pediatric audiologic assessment battery. Prior to 
the availability of OAE measures, the audiologist relied on behav-
ioral assessment and immittance audiometry in the initial pediat-
ric hearing consultation. In a cooperative young child, behavioral 
measures could be obtained that provided adequate audiometric 
information. When these results were corroborated by SPAR test-
ing, assessment was completed without the need for additional 
testing. Unfortunately, many young children are not altogether 
cooperative, and failure to establish audiometric levels by behav-
ioral means usually led to AEP testing that required sedation. OAE 
measures have reduced the need for such an approach. 
In typical clinical settings, many of  the children who undergo 
audiometric assessment have normal hearing sensitivity. They 
are usually referred for assessment due to some risk factor or con-
cerns about speech and language development. As audiologists, 

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  391
we are interested in identifying these normal-hearing children 
quickly and getting them out of the system prior to the need for 
sedated AEP testing. That is, we are interested in concentrating 
the resources required to carry out pediatric AEP measures only 
on children with hearing impairment and not on normal-hearing 
children who cannot otherwise be tested. OAE measures have had 
a positive impact on our ability to identify normal-hearing children 
in a more cost- and time-effi cient manner, which has led, in turn, 
to more effi cient clinical application of AEP measures. With OAE 
testing, behavioral and immittance results can be cross-checked 
in a very efficient and effective way to identify normal hearing 
(e.g. Stach et al., 1993). If such measures show the presence of 
a hearing loss, then AEP testing can be implemented to confi rm 
degree of impairment. On the other hand, if these measures show 
normal cochlear function, the need for additional testing is elimi-
nated. Many audiologists have modifi ed their pediatric protocols 
to initiate testing with OAEs followed by immittance and then by 
traditional speech and pure-tone audiometry. In many cases, the 
objective information about the peripheral auditory mechanism 
gained from OAEs and immittance measures, when results are 
normal, is suffi cient to preclude additional testing.
Cochlear Function Monitoring
Otoacoustic emission measures have also been used effectively to 
monitor cochlear function, particularly in patients undergoing 
treatment that is potentially ototoxic. Many drugs used as che-
motherapy for certain types of cancer are ototoxic, as are some 
antibiotics used to control infections. Given in large enough doses, 
these drugs destroy outer hair cell function, resulting in perma-
nent sensorineural hearing loss. Often, drug dosage can be ad-
justed during treatment to minimize these ototoxic effects. Thus, 
it is not unusual for patients undergoing chemotherapy or other 
drug treatment to have their hearing monitored before, during, 
and after the treatment regimen. High-frequency pure-tone au-
diometry is useful for this purpose. In addition, DPOAE testing is 
now being used as an early indicator of outer hair cell damage 
in these patients. The combination of pure-tone audiometry and 
DPOAE measures is quite accurate in determining when drugs are 
causing ototoxicity.
Ototoxic means it is 
poisonous to the ear.

392  CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES
Diagnostic Applications
Otoacoustic emission can also be useful diagnostically. Some pa-
tients have hearing impairment that is caused by retrocochlear 
disorder, such as tumors impinging on VIIIth nerve or brainstem 
lesions affecting the central auditory nervous system pathways. 
Sometimes these patients will have measurable sensorineural hear-
ing loss but normal OAEs (Kileny et al., 1998; Stach et al., 1998). 
In such cases, outer hair cell function is considered normal, and the 
hearing loss can be attributable to the neurologic diseases process.
Otoacoustic emissions are also useful for evaluating patients with 
functional or nonorganic hearing loss. In a short period of time, 
the audiologist can determine whether the peripheral auditory 
system is functioning normally without voluntary responses 
from the patient. If OAEs are normal in such cases, their use can 
reduce the time and frustration often experienced with other 
measures in the functional test battery. Remember, however, that 
most functional hearing loss has some organicity as its basis, and 
OAEs are likely to simply reveal that fact.
One other aspect of otoacoustic emissions that is quite interesting 
from a diagnostic perspective is that the amplitude of a TEOAE is 
suppressed to a certain extent by stimulation of the contralateral 
ear (Berlin et al., 1993). This contralateral suppression is a small but 
consistent effect that occurs when broad spectrum noise is pre-
sented to one ear and transient emissions are recorded in the other. 
The effect is mediated by the medial olivocochlear system, which is 
part of the auditory system’s complex efferent mechanism. In some 
cases of peripheral and central auditory disorder, contralateral 
suppression is absent, so that the TEOAE is unaffected by stimula-
tion of the contralateral ear. Thus, use of contralateral suppression 
can be useful for assessing auditory nervous system function.
Summary
One by-product of the active processes of the cochlear outer hair 
• 
cells is the generation of a replication of a stimulating sound, 
which travels back out of the cochlea, through the middle ear, 
and into the ear canal. This response is a low-intensity sound 
referred to as an otoacoustic emission or OAE.

CHAPTER 9  PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES  393
Evoked OAEs occur during and after the presentation of a stim-
• 
ulus. Two classes of evoked OAEs have proven to be useful clini-
cally, transiently-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) and 
distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE).
OAEs are useful in at least four clinical areas: infant screening, 
• 
pediatric assessment, cochlear function monitoring, and certain 
diagnostic cases.
OAEs are used most effectively as a screening measure.
• 
One of the most important applications of OAEs is as an addi-
• 
tional part of the pediatric audiologic assessment battery.
Otoacoustic emission measures have been used effectively to 
• 
monitor cochlear function, particularly in patients undergoing 
treatment that is potentially ototoxic.
Otoacoustic emission can also be useful diagnostically.

DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES 
FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  399
ALTHOUGH the overall goal of an audiological evaluation is 
to characterize hearing ability, the approach used to reach that 
goal can vary considerably across patients. The approach cho-
sen to evaluate a patient’s hearing is sometimes related to pa-
tient factors such as age and sometimes related to the reason that 
the patient has sought services or has been referred for services. 
For example, the strategy used for a patient who is seeking oto-
logic care is different in some ways from the strategy used for a 
patient who is seeking audiologic care. In the former, emphasis 
is on determination of degree and site of disorder; in the latter, 
emphasis is on degree of impairment and prognosis for successful 
hearing aid use. Within these broad categories, the approach may 
also vary depending on a patient’s age. Quantifi cation of degree 
of hearing loss in a 2-week-old requires a different strategy than 
that in a 20-year-old. Similarly, testing an 80-year-old patient can 
require different techniques and an expanded approach from the 
testing of a 40-year-old. Finally, there are patients who exagger-
ate or feign hearing loss, requiring an entirely different approach 
to assessment.
Although assessment must be adapted to the needs and expecta-
tions of individual patients, there are several broad categories of 
patients that present common challenges and can be approached 
in a similar clinical manner, including pediatric patients, those

being assessed for otologic reasons, those being assessed for 
 audiologic reasons, and patients with functional hearing loss.
OTOLOGIC REFERRALS
An otologist’s evaluation of a patient, aimed at diagnosing and 
treating ear disease, often includes ancillary testing, such as im-
aging studies, laboratory tests, and audiologic evaluations. Au-
diologic assessment in this context serves to provide additional 
information to the physician to aid in diagnosis. In addition, be-
cause hearing loss is often a quantifi able consequence of auditory 
disorder, results can serve as a metric for the success or failure of 
treatment approaches.
In general, otologists are faced with three main categories of pa-
tients: those with outer- or middle-ear disorders, those with co-
chlear disorders, and those with neurologic disorders affecting 
the peripheral or central auditory nervous system.
Outer- or Middle-Ear Disorders
Evaluative Goals
Physicians who note the presence of an outer- or middle-ear dis-
order are likely to refer the patient for an audiologic consultation. 
For the audiologist, there are two primary goals in the assessment 
of outer- and middle-ear disorders:
 1. investigation of the nature of the disorder and
 2. assessment of the impact of that disorder on hearing 
sensitivity
Audiologic determination of the nature of the disorder relates to 
the consequence that a disorder has on the function of the outer- 
and middle-ear structures. For example, excessive cerumen in the 
ear canal may or may not impede the transduction of sound to 
the tympanic membrane. Similarly, tympanosclerosis may or 
may not reduce the functioning of the tympanic membrane. The 
fi rst goal is to determine whether these structural changes result 
in a disorder in function.
The second goal of the evaluation is to determine whether and 
how much this disorder in function is causing a hearing loss. 
Tympanosclerosis is 
the formation of whitish 
plaques on the tympanic 
membrane, which can result 
in membrane stiffness.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  401
In some circumstances, a structural change in the outer and 
middle ear can result in outer- or middle-ear disorder without 
causing a measurable loss of hearing. For example, a tympanic 
membrane can be perforated, resulting in a disorder of eardrum 
function, without causing a meaningful conductive hearing loss. 
On the other hand, a similar perforation in the right location on 
the tympanic membrane can result in a substantial conductive 
hearing loss. Similarly, blockage of the Eustachian tube can re-
sult in signifi cant negative pressure in the middle-ear space that 
may result in hearing loss in one case but not in another.
In some cases, the referring physician may not be able to detect a 
structural change in the middle-ear mechanism and will be refer-
ring the patient to rule out middle-ear disorder as the cause of the 
patient’s complaint. The approach in such cases is the same. First, 
you must assess the normalcy of middle-ear function and then the 
degree to which any disorder is infl uencing hearing ability.
The importance of your assessment of hearing sensitivity in these 
cases cannot be overstated. If the patient has an outer- or middle-ear 
disorder, the degree of hearing loss that it is causing will serve as an 
important metric of the success or failure of the medical treatment 
regimen. If the physician prescribes medication to treat otitis media 
or performs surgery to mitigate the effects of otosclerosis, the pure-
tone audiogram will often be the metric by which the outcome of 
the treatment is judged. That is, the pretreatment audiogram will be 
compared to the post-treatment audiogram to evaluate the success 
of the treatment.
Test Strategies
Immittance audiometry is used to evaluate outer- and middle-ear 
function, and pure-tone audiometry is used to evaluate the  degree 
of conductive component caused by the presence of middle-ear 
disorder. In most cases, rudimentary speech audiometry will be 
carried out as a cross-check of pure-tone thresholds and as a gross 
assessment of suprathreshold word recognition ability.
Immittance Audiometry. The fi rst step in the evaluation process 
is immittance audiometry. Because it is the most sensitive indica-
tor of middle-ear function, a full battery of tympanometry, static 
Otosclerosis is the 
formation of new bone 
around the stapes and oval 
window, resulting in stapes 
ﬁ xation and conductive 
hearing loss.

402  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
immittance, and acoustic refl ex thresholds should be carried out. 
Results will provide information indicating whether a disorder is 
due to:
an increase in the mass of the middle-ear mechanism,
• 
an increase or decrease in the stiffness of the middle-ear 
• 
system,
the presence of a perforation of the tympanic membrane, or
• 
signifi cant negative pressure in the middle-ear space.
• 
If all immittance results are normal, any hearing loss measured 
by pure-tone audiometry can be attributed to sensorineural hearing 
loss. If immittance results indicate the presence of a middle-ear 
disorder, pure-tone audiometry by air- and bone-conduction must 
be carried out to assess the degree of conductive component of 
the hearing loss attributable to the middle-ear disorder.
Pure-Tone Audiometry. Pure-tone audiometry is used to quan-
tify the degree to which middle-ear disorder is contributing to a 
hearing sensitivity loss. If  immittance audiometry shows any 
 abnormality in outer- or middle-ear function, then complete air- 
and bone-conduction audiometry must be carried out on both 
ears to determine the degree of conductive hearing loss.
It is important to carry out both air and bone conduction in order 
to quantify the extent of the conductive component. It is impor-
tant to test both ears because the presence of conductive hearing 
loss requires the use of masking in the nontest ear and that ear 
cannot be properly masked without knowing its air- and bone-
conduction thresholds.
Speech Audiometry. In cases of outer- and middle-ear disorder, 
the most important component of speech audiometry is determi-
nation of the speech-recognition threshold as a cross-check of the 
accuracy of pure-tone thresholds. Many audiologists prefer to es-
tablish the SRT before carrying out pure-tone audiometry so that 
they have a benchmark for the level at which pure-tone thresh-
olds should occur. Although this is good practice in general, it is 
particularly useful in the assessment of young children. SRTs can 
also be established by bone conduction, permitting the quantifi ca-
tion of an air-bone gap to speech signals.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  403
Assessment of word recognition is also often carried out, though 
more as a matter of  routine than importance. Conductive 
hearing loss has a predictable influence on word-recognition 
scores, and if such testing is of value, it is usually only to confi rm 
this expectation.
Illustrative Cases
Illustrative Case 10-1. Case 1 is a patient with bilateral, acute 
otitis media with effusion. The patient is a 4-year-old boy with a 
history of recurring upper-respiratory infections, often accompa-
nied by otitis media. The upper-respiratory infection often inter-
feres with Eustachian-tube functioning, thereby limiting pressure 
equalization of the middle-ear space. The patient had been experi-
encing symptoms of a cold for the past 2 weeks and complained to 
his parents of diffi culty hearing.
Immittance audiometry, shown in Figure 10-1A, is consistent 
with middle-ear disorder, characterized by fl at, Type B tympano-
grams, low static immittance, and absent crossed and uncrossed 
refl exes bilaterally. These results are consistent with an increase 
in the mass of the middle-ear mechanism, a result that often indi-
cates the presence of effusion in the middle-ear space.
Results of pure-tone audiometry are shown in Figure 10-1B. Re-
sults show a mild conductive hearing loss bilaterally, with slightly 
more loss in the left ear. Bone-conduction thresholds indicate nor-
mal cochlear function bilaterally.
Speech audiometric results indicate speech thresholds that are 
consistent with pure-tone thresholds. In addition, suprathreshold 
understanding of words (PSI-W) and sentences (PSI-S) is excel-
lent, as expected.
This child’s ear problems have not responded well in the past to 
antibiotic treatment. The child’s physician is considering the 
placement of pressure-equalization tubes into the eardrums to 
help overcome the effects of the Eustachian-tube problems.
Illustrative Case 10-2. Case 2 is a patient with bilateral otoscle-
rosis, a bone disorder that often results in fi xation of the stapes

loss. (PSI-Wm = Pediatric Speech Intelligibility test maximum word score; PSI-Sm = PSI

into the oval window. The patient is a 33-year-old woman who 
developed hearing problems during pregnancy. She describes her 
problem as a muffl ing of other people’s voices. She also reports 
tinnitus in both ears that bothers her at night. There is a family 
history of otosclerosis on her mother’s side.
Results of immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-2A, are 
consistent with middle-ear disorder, characterized by a Type A 
tympanogram, low static immittance, and absent crossed and un-
crossed acoustic refl exes bilaterally. This pattern of results suggests 
an increase in the stiffness of the middle-ear mechanism and is of-
ten associated with fi xation of the ossicular chain.
Pure-tone audiometric results are shown in Figure 10-2B. The pa-
tient has a moderate, bilateral, symmetric, conductive hearing loss.

As is typical in otosclerosis, the patient also has an apparent hear-
ing loss by bone conduction at around 2000 Hz in both ears. This 
so-called Carhart’s notch is actually the result of an elimination 
of the middle-ear contribution to bone-conducted hearing rather 
than a loss in cochlear sensitivity.
Speech audiometric results show speech thresholds consistent 
with pure-tone thresholds. Suprathreshold speech recognition 
ability is normal once the effect of the hearing loss is overcome by 
presenting speech at higher intensity levels.
The patient is scheduled for surgery on her right ear. The surgeon 
will likely remove the stapes and replace it with a prosthesis. The 
result should be restoration of nearly normal hearing sensitivity.

408  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Cochlear Disorder
Evaluative Goals
When an otologist refers a patient with a suspected cochlear dis-
order, the physician is interested in the answers to several ques-
tions, including:
Is there a hearing loss and what is the extent of it?
• 
Is the loss truly of a cochlear nature or is there also a con-
• 
ductive component?
Is the loss truly of a cochlear nature or is it retrocochlear?
• 
Is the loss fl uctuating or stable?
• 
Could the loss be due to a treatable condition such as endo-
• 
lymphatic hydrops or autoimmune disorder?
The goals of the audiologic evaluation, then, pertain to these ques-
tions. The fi rst goal is to determine whether a middle-ear disorder 
is contributing to the problem. The second goal is to determine the 
degree and type of hearing loss. The third goal is to scrutinize the 
audiologic fi ndings for any evidence of retrocochlear disorder.
Test Strategies
Immittance audiometry is used to evaluate outer- and middle-ear 
function, to indicate the presence of cochlear hearing loss, and to 
assess the integrity of VIIIth nerve and lower auditory brainstem 
function. Pure-tone audiometry is used to evaluate the degree 
and type of hearing loss. Speech audiometry is used as a cross-
check of pure-tone thresholds and as an estimate of suprathresh-
old word recognition ability.
Immittance Audiometry. A complete immittance battery will 
provide valuable information about the cochlear hearing loss. 
If a loss is truly cochlear in origin, then the tympanograms will 
be normal, static immittance will be normal, and acoustic refl ex 
thresholds will be consistent with the degree of  sensorineural 
hearing loss. For example, if a cochlear hearing loss is less than 
approximately 50 dB HL, then acoustic refl ex thresholds to pure 
tones should be at normal levels. If the loss is greater than 50 dB, 
refl ex thresholds will be elevated accordingly. In either case, a co-
chlear hearing loss will cause an elevation of the acoustic refl ex 

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  409
thresholds to noise stimuli relative to pure-tone stimuli, resulting 
in a reduced SPAR value.
If immittance audiometry suggests the presence of middle-ear 
disorder, then any cochlear loss is likely to have a superimposed 
conductive component that must be quantifi ed by pure-tone au-
diometry. If immittance audiometry is consistent with normal 
middle-ear function, but acoustic reflexes are elevated beyond 
that which might be expected from the degree of sensorineural 
hearing loss, then suspicion is raised about the possibility of ret-
rocochlear disorder.
Pure-Tone Audiometry. Pure-tone audiometry is used to quantify 
the degree of sensorineural hearing loss caused by the cochlear 
disorder. If  all immittance measures are normal, then air-
 conduction testing must be completed on both ears. Bone conduc-
tion will not be necessary because outer- and middle-ear function 
are normal, and air-conducted signals will properly evaluate the 
sensitivity of the cochlea. If all immittance measures are not nor-
mal, then air- and bone-conduction thresholds must be obtained 
for both ears to assess the possibility of the presence of a mixed 
hearing loss. In either case, both ears must be tested, because the 
use of masking is likely to be necessary and cannot be properly 
carried out without knowledge of the air- and bone-conduction 
thresholds of the nontest ear.
Pure-tone audiometry is also an important measure for assessing 
symmetry of hearing loss. If a sensorineural hearing loss is asym-
metric, in the absence of other explanations, suspicion is raised 
about the possibility of the presence of retrocochlear disorder.
There are other ways in which pure-tone audiometry can be use-
ful in the otologic diagnosis of cochlear disorder. Some types of 
cochlear disorder are dynamic and may be treatable at various 
stages. One example is endolymphatic hydrops, a cochlear disorder 
caused by excessive accumulation of endolymph in the cochlea. 
In its active stage, otologists will attempt to treat it in various ways 
and will often use the results of pure-tone audiometry as both 
partial evidence of the presence of hydrops and as a means for as-
sessing benefi t from the treatment regimen.
The SPAR test is designed 
to predict the presence or 
absence of cochlear hearing 
loss by comparing the 
difference between acoustic 
reﬂ ex thresholds elicited by 
pure tones and by broad-
band noise.

410  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Speech Audiometry. Speech audiometry is used in two ways in the 
assessment of cochlear disorder. First, speech recognition thresh-
olds are used as a cross-check of the validity of pure-tone thresholds 
in an effort to ensure the organicity of the disorder. Second, word-
recognition and other suprathreshold measures are used to assess 
whether the cochlear hearing loss has an expected influence on 
speech recognition. That is, in most cases, suprathreshold speech-
recognition ability is predictable from the degree and configura-
tion of a sensorineural hearing loss if the loss is cochlear in origin. 
Therefore, if word-recognition scores are appropriate for the degree 
of hearing loss, then the results are consistent with a cochlear site 
of disorder. If scores are poorer than would be expected from the 
degree of hearing loss, then suspicion is aroused that the disorder 
may be retrocochlear in nature.
Otoacoustic Emissions. Otoacoustic emissions can be used in the 
assessment of sensorineural hearing loss as a means of verifying 
that there is a cochlear component to the disorder. For example, 
if the cochlea is disordered, OAEs are expected to be abnormal or 
absent. Although this does not preclude the presence of retroco-
chlear disorder, it does implicate the cochlea. Conversely, if OAEs 
are normal in the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss, a ret-
rocochlear site of disorder is implicated.
Auditory Evoked Potentials. Auditory evoked potentials can be 
used for two purposes in the assessment of cochlear disorder. First, 
if there is suspicion that the hearing loss is exaggerated, evoked 
potentials can be used to predict the degree of organic hearing 
loss. Second, if there is suspicion that the disorder might be retro-
cochlear in nature, the auditory brainstem response can be used 
in an effort to differentiate a cochlear from a retrocochlear site.
Illustrative Cases
Illustrative Case 10-3. Case 3 is a patient with bilateral sen-
sorineural hearing loss of cochlear origin, secondary to ototox-
icity. The patient is a 56-year-old man with cancer who recently 
fi nished a round of chemotherapy with a drug regimen that in-
cluded cisplatin.
Immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-3A, is consis-
tent with normal middle-ear function bilaterally, characterized 

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  411
by Type A tympanograms, normal static immittance, and normal 
crossed and uncrossed acoustic refl ex thresholds. You will note 
that the SPARs, or sensitivity prediction by acoustic reflexes, 
predict the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss, as they are 
FIGURE 10-3 Hearing consultation results in a 56-year-old man with hearing loss resulting from 
ototoxicity. Immittance measures (A) are consistent with normal middle-ear function. 
SPARs predict the presence of hearing loss. Pure-tone audiometric results (B) show a 
high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally. Speech audiometric results are 
consistent with the degree and conﬁ guration of the hearing loss.

 below the score of  15, which is the lower limit for normal co-
chlear function.
Pure-tone audiometry is shown in Figure 10-3B. Results show bi-
laterally symmetric, high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, 
progressing from mild levels at 2000 Hz to profound at 8000 Hz.
Further doses of chemotherapy would be expected to begin to af-
fect the remaining high-frequency hearing and progress down-
ward toward the low frequencies.
Speech audiometric results are consistent with the degree and 
confi guration of cochlear hearing loss. First, the speech thresholds 
match the pure-tone thresholds. Second, the word-recognition 
scores are consistent with this degree of hearing loss. You can

degree of loss or by calculating the audibility index and predicting 
the score from that calculation as described in Chapter 7.
This patient may well be a candidate for high-frequency amplifi -
cation, if the hearing loss is causing a communication disorder 
for him. Caution should also be taken to monitor hearing sensi-
tivity if the patient undergoes additional chemotherapy. He is at 
risk for additional hearing loss, and the physician may be able to 
alter the dosage of  cisplatin to reduce the potential for further 
cochlear damage.
Illustrative Case 10-4. Case 4 is a patient with unilateral sen-
sorineural hearing loss secondary to endolymphatic hydrops. 
The patient is a 45-year-old woman who, 2 weeks prior to the 
evaluation, experienced episodes of hearing loss, ear fullness, tin-
nitus, and severe vertigo. After several episodic attacks, hearing 
loss persisted. A diagnosis of Ménière’s disease was made by her 
otolaryngologist.
Immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-4A is consistent 
with normal middle-ear function bilaterally, characterized by 
Type A tympanograms, normal static immittance, and normal 
crossed and uncrossed refl ex thresholds.
Pure-tone audiometry is shown in Figure 10-4B. Results show a 
moderate, rising, sensorineural hearing loss on the left ear and 
normal hearing sensitivity on the right.
Speech audiometric results were normal for the right ear. On the 
left, although speech thresholds agree with the pure-tone thresh-
olds, suprathreshold speech-recognition scores are very poor. 
This performance is signifi cantly reduced from what would nor-
mally be expected from a cochlear hearing loss. These results are 
 unusual for cochlear hearing loss, except in cases of Méniére’s 
disease, where they are characteristic.
Because of the unilateral nature of the disorder, the physician was 
interested in ruling out an VIIIth nerve tumor as the causative factor. 
Results of an auditory brainstem response assessment are shown in 
Figure 10-4C. Both the absolute and interpeak latencies are normal 
and symmetric, supporting the diagnosis of cochlear disorder.

The physician may recommend a course of diuretics or steroids and 
may recommend a change in diet and stress level for the patient. 
From an audiologic perspective, the patient is not a good candidate 
for amplifi cation because of the normal hearing in the right ear and 
because of the exceptionally poor speech recognition ability in the 
left. Presenting amplifi ed sound to an ear that distorts this badly is 
unlikely to result in a favorable reaction. Monitoring of hearing is 
indicated to assess any changes that might occur in the left ear.
Retrocochlear Disorder
Evaluative Goals
Sometimes the patient history or physical examination will lead 
the otologist to suspect that a patient might have a retrocochlear 
disorder. In most cases, the physician will be concerned about the 
presence of a space-occupying lesion on the VIIIth nerve. This often

occurs when a patient reports the presence of unilateral hearing 
loss, unilateral tinnitus, unexplained dizziness, or other neurologic 
symptoms. In such cases, the physician is interested in several as-
pects of the audiologic evaluation, including:
Is there a hearing loss, and what is the extent of it?
• 
Is the loss 
• 
unilateral or asymmetric?
Is speech understanding asymmetric or poorer than pre-
• 
dicted from the hearing loss?
Are acoustic refl exes normal or elevated?
• 
Is there other evidence of retrocochlear disorder?
• 
One goal of the audiologic evaluation is to determine the degree 
and type of hearing loss. Another goal is to scrutinize the audio-
logic fi ndings for any evidence of retrocochlear disorder. Often a 
third goal is to assess the integrity of the VIIIth nerve and audi-
tory brainstem with electrophysiologic measures.
Unilateral pertains to one 
side only; bilateral pertains 
to both sides.
Symmetric means there is a 
similarity between two parts; 
asymmetric means there is 
a dissimilarity between two 
parts.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  417
Test Strategies
Immittance audiometry is used to evaluate outer- and middle-
ear function and to assess the integrity of the VIIth and VIIIth 
cranial nerves and lower auditory brainstem function. Pure-tone 
audiometry is used to evaluate the extent of any hearing asym-
metry. Speech audiometry is used as a cross-check of pure-tone 
thresholds, as an estimate of suprathreshold speech recognition 
ability, as a measure of hearing symmetry, and as an assessment 
of  any abnormality of  hearing under adverse listening condi-
tions. Electroacoustic and electrophysiologic measures are used 
in an effort to assess integrity of the cochlea, VIIIth nerve, and 
auditory brainstem.
Immittance Measures. A complete immittance battery may pro-
vide valuable information about the nature of  a retrocochlear 
hearing disorder. Assuming normal middle-ear function, the ab-
sence of crossed and uncrossed refl exes measured from the same 
ear may be indicative of facial nerve disorder on that side. The ab-
sence of crossed and uncrossed refl exes when the eliciting signal 
is presented to one ear may be indicative of VIIIth nerve disorder 
on that side.
If the disorder is truly cochlear in origin, the tympanograms will 
be normal, static immittance will be normal, and acoustic refl ex 
thresholds will be consistent with the degree of  sensorineural 
hearing loss. Immittance audiometry is also important in assessing 
middle-ear function in cases of suspected retrocochlear disorder, 
because middle-ear disorder and any resultant conductive hearing 
loss can affect interpretation of other audiometric measures.
Pure-Tone Audiometry. Pure-tone audiometry is used to quantify 
the degree of sensorineural hearing loss caused by a retrocochlear 
disorder. If all immittance measures are normal, only air-conduction 
testing need be completed on both ears. Bone conduction will not 
be necessary because outer- and middle-ear function is normal, 
and air-conducted signals will properly evaluate the sensitivity of 
the cochlea. If all immittance measures are not normal, air- and 
bone-conduction thresholds must be obtained for both ears to as-
sess the possibility of the presence of a mixed hearing loss. In ei-
ther case, both ears must be tested, because the use of masking 

418  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
is likely to be necessary and cannot be properly carried out with-
out knowledge of the air- and bone-conduction thresholds of the 
nontest ear.
Pure-tone audiometry is also an important measure for assessing 
symmetry of hearing loss. If a sensorineural hearing loss is asym-
metric in the absence of other explanations, suspicion is raised 
about the possibility of the presence of retrocochlear disorder.
Speech Audiometry. Speech audiometry is used in two ways in 
the assessment of retrocochlear disorder. First, as usual, speech-
recognition thresholds are used as a cross-check of the validity 
of pure-tone thresholds in an effort to ensure the organicity of 
the disorder. Second, word-recognition and other suprathresh-
old measures are used to assess whether speech-recognition 
is poorer than would be expected from the amount of  hearing 
loss. That is, in most cases of  cochlear disorder, suprathresh-
old speech-recognition ability is predictable from the degree 
and confi guration of  a sensorineural hearing loss. However, if 
speech-recognition ability is poorer than would be expected from 
the degree of hearing loss, suspicion is aroused that the disorder 
may be retrocochlear in nature.
Suprathreshold speech audiometric measures are very important 
in the assessment of patients suspected of retrocochlear disorder.
One useful technique is to obtain performance-intensity functions 
by testing word-recognition ability at several intensity levels and 
looking for the presence of rollover of the function. Rollover, as 
you will recall, is the unexpectedly poorer performance as intensity 
level is increased, a phenomenon associated with retrocochlear 
disorder. Often, however, such a disorder will escape detection of 
simple measures of word-recognition presented in quiet. Another 
technique is to evaluate speech recognition in background com-
petition. Although those with normal neurologic systems will 
perform well on such measures, those with retrocochlear disorder 
are likely to perform more poorly than would be predicted from 
their hearing sensitivity loss.
Otoacoustic Emissions. Otoacoustic emissions can be used in 
the assessment of  retrocochlear disorder, although the results 

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  419
are often equivocal. If a hearing loss is caused by a retrocochlear 
disorder due to the disorder’s primary effect on function of the 
VIIIth nerve, otoacoustic emissions may be normal despite the 
hearing loss. That is, the loss is caused by neural disorder, and 
the cochlea is functioning normally. However, in some cases 
a retrocochlear disorder can affect function of  the cochlea, 
secondarily resulting in a hearing loss and abnormality of 
otoacoustic emissions. Thus, in the presence of  a hearing loss 
and normal middle-ear function, the absence of OAEs indicates 
either cochlear or retrocochlear disorder. On the other hand, in 
the presence of a hearing loss, the preservation of OAEs suggests 
that the disorder is retrocochlear in nature.
Auditory Evoked Potentials. If suspicion of a retrocochlear dis-
order exists and if that suspicion is enhanced by the presence of 
audiometric indicators, it is quite common to assess the integrity 
of the auditory nervous system directly with the auditory brain-
stem response. The ABR is a sensitive indicator of the integrity of 
VIIIth nerve and auditory brainstem function. If it is abnormal, 
there is a very high likelihood of retrocochlear disorder.
In recent years, imaging techniques have improved to the point 
that structural changes in the nervous system can sometimes be 
identifi ed before those changes have a functional infl uence. Thus, 
the presence of a normal ABR does not rule out the presence of 
a neurologic disease process. It simply indicates that the process 
is not having a measurable functional consequence. The presence 
of an abnormal ABR, however, remains a strong indicator of neu-
rologic disorder and can be very helpful to the physician in the di-
agnosis of retrocochlear disease.
Illustrative Cases

mor on the left ear. The tumor is diagnosed as a cochleovestibular 
schwannoma. The patient is a 42-year-old man with a 6-month 
history of left-ear tinnitus. His health and hearing histories are 
otherwise unremarkable.

was relatively small and the hearing relatively good, the surgeon 
opted to try a surgical approach to remove the tumor and preserve 
hearing. Hearing was monitored throughout the surgery, and 
postsurgical audiometric results showed that hearing was 
effectively preserved.

Illustrative Case 10-6. Case 6 is a patient with auditory complaints 
secondary to multiple sclerosis. The patient is a 34-year-old 
woman. Two years prior to her evaluation, she experienced an 
episode of diplopia, or double vision, accompanied by a tingling 
sensation and weakness in her left leg. These symptoms gradually 
subsided and reappeared in slightly more severe form a year later. 
Ultimately, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Among 
various other symptoms, she had vague hearing complaints, 
particularly in the presence of background noise.
Immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-6A is consistent 
with normal middle-ear function, characterized by a Type A tym-
panogram, normal static immittance, and normal right and left 
uncrossed refl ex thresholds. However, crossed refl exes are absent 
bilaterally. This unusual pattern of results is consistent with a 
central pathway disorder of the lower brainstem.

Pure-tone audiometric results are shown in Figure 10-6B. The 
patient has a mild low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss 
bilaterally.
Speech thresholds match pure-tone thresholds in both ears. 
However, suprathreshold speech-recognition performance is 
abnormal in both ears. Although speech-recognition scores are 
normal when words are presented in quiet, they are abnormal 
when sentences are presented in the presence of  competition, 
as shown in Figure 10-6C. These results are consistent with 
retrocochlear disorder.

Auditory evoked potentials are also consistent with abnormality

responses for both ears. On the left, no waves were identifi able be-
yond component Wave I, and on the right, absolute latencies and

Multiple sclerosis is commonly treated with chemotherapy in an 
attempt to keep it in its remission stage. Although the patient’s 
auditory complaints were vague and subtle, she was informed of 
the availability of certain assistive listening devices that could be 
used if she was experiencing substantive diffi culty during periods 
of exacerbation of the multiple sclerosis.

ADULT AUDIOLOGIC REFERRALS
An audiologist’s evaluation of a patient is aimed at diagnosing 
and treating hearing impairments that are caused by a disordered 
auditory system. The purpose of the evaluation is to quantify the 
degree and nature of the hearing impairment, assess its impact 
on a patient’s communication ability, and plan and provide pros-
thetic and rehabilitative treatment for the impairment.
In some patients referred for audiologic purposes, the absence of 
active disease process has been determined. For example, some 
referrals for audiologic assessment are from otolaryngologists 
or other physicians who have ruled out the presence of active or 
medically treatable conditions. In other cases, the referral is a self-
referral or emanates from some source other than the medical

community. In both cases, the audiologic assessment is carried out 
with vigilance for indicators of medically treatable conditions. The 
focus, however, is on the impact of the hearing loss on the indi-
vidual’s communication ability.
In general, audiologists are faced with two main categories of 
adult patients, those who are younger and have signifi cant vo-
cational communication demands and those who are older and 
have more complex auditory problems. Of course, age is not nec-
essarily a factor, so that some of the older adults may fi t into the 
younger category and vice versa. However, often the approach 
that is appropriate for patients who are elderly is different from 
that necessary for those who are younger, and the distinction 
seems worth making.
Younger Adults
Evaluative Goals
The main goals of the audiologic evaluation of adult patients are 
to assess the degree and type of hearing loss and to assess the im-
pact that the hearing loss has on their communicative function. 
An important subgoal is to maintain vigilance for indicators of 
underlying conditions that might require medical attention.
Test Strategies
Immittance audiometry is used to evaluate outer- and middle-ear 
function, to indicate the presence of cochlear hearing loss, and to 
assess the integrity of VIIIth nerve and lower auditory brainstem 
function. Pure-tone audiometry is used to evaluate the degree and 
type of hearing loss. Speech audiometry is used as a cross-check 
of  pure-tone thresholds and as an estimate of  suprathreshold 
word-recognition ability. Both pure-tone and speech audiometric 
measures are used as prognostic indicators for the successful use 
of hearing aid amplifi cation. Self-assessment measures are used 
to quantify the impact that the hearing impairment is having on 
communication ability.
Immittance Measures. A complete immittance battery is an im-
portant fi rst step in the audiologic evaluation. It is important to 
assess the integrity of  middle-ear function for several reasons. 
If it is abnormal, proper medical referrals may need to be made, 

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  429
depending on the initial referral source. Also, results will di-
rect the audiologist as to the need for bone-conduction testing. 
Should a middle-ear disorder cause a conductive hearing loss, 
the degree of  the conductive component is likely to influence 
hearing aid fi tting.
Immittance audiometry also provides valuable information about 
the cochlear hearing loss. If a loss is truly cochlear in origin, the 
tympanograms will be normal, static immittance will be normal, 
and acoustic refl ex thresholds will be consistent with the degree of 
sensorineural hearing loss. A cochlear hearing loss will also cause 
an elevation of the acoustic refl ex thresholds to noise stimuli rela-
tive to pure-tone stimuli, resulting in a reduced SPAR value. This 
information serves as an important cross-check of the organicity 
of the hearing loss.
Finally, immittance audiometry allows an assessment of the in-
tegrity of the auditory nervous system. If immittance audiometry 
is consistent with normal middle-ear function, but acoustic re-
fl exes are elevated beyond a level that might be expected from the 
degree of sensorineural hearing loss, suspicion is raised about the 
possibility of retrocochlear disorder.
Pure-Tone Audiometry. Pure-tone audiometry is used to quan-
tify the degree of conductive, sensorineural, or mixed hearing loss 
caused by the auditory disorder. If all immittance measures are 
normal, only air-conduction testing is necessary. Bone- conduction 
testing will not be necessary because outer- and middle-ear func-
tion are normal, and air-conducted signals will properly evaluate 
the sensitivity of the cochlea. If all immittance measures are not 
normal, air- and bone-conduction thresholds must be obtained for 
both ears to assess the possibility of the presence of a conductive 
or mixed hearing loss.
Correctly or incorrectly the audiogram itself has become the sin-
gle most important metric in an audiologic evaluation. Nearly all 
estimates of hearing impairment, activity limitations and partici-
pation restrictions begin with this measure of hearing sensitivity 
as their basis. Gain, frequency response, and sometimes output 
limitations of hearing aids are also estimated based on the result 
of pure-tone audiometry.

430  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Pure-tone audiometry is also an important measure for assessing 
symmetry of hearing loss. If a sensorineural hearing loss is asym-
metric, in the absence of other explanations, then suspicion is raised 
about the possibility of the presence of retrocochlear disorder.
Speech Audiometry. Speech audiometry is used in several ways in the 
audiologic assessment of hearing disorder. First, speech- recognition 
thresholds are used as a cross-check of the validity of pure-tone 
thresholds in an effort to ensure the organicity of the disorder.
Second, word-recognition and other suprathreshold measures 
are used to assess whether the hearing loss has an expected infl u-
ence on speech recognition. That is, in most cases, suprathresh-
old speech-recognition ability is predictable from the degree and 
confi guration of a hearing loss if the loss is due to conductive or 
cochlear disorders. If not, then suspicion is aroused that the disor-
der may be retrocochlear in nature.
Third, speech-recognition measures are used for assessing the 
amount of impairment caused by a hearing loss and for assess-
ing prognosis for successful hearing aid use. If a patient’s speech-
 recognition ability is signifi cantly reduced, he or she is likely to 
have greater impairment and reduced success with conventional 
hearing aid amplifi cation.
Communication Needs Assessment. One fi nal important aspect 
of the audiologic evaluation is an assessment of the impact that 
a hearing loss has on self-perception of communication ability 
(Ventry & Weinstein, 1982; Newman et al., 1991; Gate house, 
1999). If the hearing loss is perceived to be limiting or restrictive, 
motivation for treatment and rehabilitation will be signifi cantly 
higher than if the hearing loss is perceived to have little infl uence 
on communication. Thus, hearing self-assessment tools can be 
useful as prognostic indicators of hearing aid success. In addition, 
they can be used before and after intervention as a way of quanti-
fying benefi t received from the treatment.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 10-7. Illustrative Case 7 is a patient with a his-
tory of exposure to excessive noise. The patient is a 54-year-old 

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  431
man with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss that has progressed 
slowly over the last 20 years. He has a positive history of noise 
exposure, fi rst during military service and then at his workplace. 
In addition, he is an avid hunter. The patient reports that he has 
used hearing protection on occasion in the past, but has not done 
so on a consistent basis. He was having his hearing tested at the 
urging of family members who were having increasing diffi culty 
communicating with him.
Immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-7A, is consistent 
with normal middle-ear function, characterized by a Type A tym-
panogram, normal static immittance, and normal crossed and 
uncrossed refl ex thresholds bilaterally.
Pure-tone audiometric results are shown in Figure 10-7B. The pa-
tient has a bilateral, fairly symmetric, high-frequency sensorineu-
ral hearing loss. The loss is greatest at 4000 Hz.
Speech audiometric results are consistent with the degree and 
confi guration of cochlear hearing loss. First, the speech thresholds 
match the pure-tone thresholds. Second, the word-recognition 
scores, although reduced, are consistent with this degree of 
hearing loss.
The patient also completed a communication needs assessment. 
Results showed that he has communication problems a signifi cant 
proportion of the time that he spends in certain listening environ-
ments, especially those involving background noise.
The hearing loss is sensorineural in nature, resulting from expo-
sure to excessive noise over long periods of time. It is not amenable 
to surgical or medical intervention. Because the patient is experi-
encing signifi cant communication problems due to the hearing 
loss, he is a candidate for hearing aid amplifi cation. A hearing aid 
consultation was recommended.
Older Adults
Evaluative Goals
The goals in evaluating older adults are similar to those in younger 
adults. However, the complexity of auditory disorders experienced 

432  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
by many older people suggests the need for more rigor in the as-
sessment of their communication function (Stach, 2007).
Test Strategies
Strategies used for immittance audiometry, pure-tone audiometry, 
and communication needs assessment are similar to those used 
FIGURE 10-7 Hearing consultation results in a 54-year-old man with noise-induced hearing loss. 
Immittance measures (A) are consistent with normal middle-ear function. Pure-tone 
audiometric results (B) show high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally, 
greatest at 4000 Hz. Speech audiometric results are consistent with the degree and 
conﬁ guration of cochlear hearing loss.

for younger adults. The major difference in assessment strategy is 
in speech audiometry.
Speech Audiometry. The aging of the auditory mechanism results 
in complex changes in function of the cochlea and central auditory 
nervous system (Willott, 1996). These changes appear to have 
an important negative infl uence on hearing of older individuals, 
particularly in their ability to hear rapid speech (Fitzgibbons & 
Gordon-Salant, 1996) and to hear speech in the presence of 
background competition (Jerger et al., 1989). Assessment of older 
people should include quantifi cation of such changes.
In addition to routine speech audiometric measures, speech recog-
nition in background competition should be assessed. If a patient

has diffi culty identifying speech under fairly easy listening condi-
tions, the prognosis for successful use of conventional hearing aids 
is likely to be reduced. Older individuals may also have reduced abil-
ity in using both ears (Jerger et al., 1993). Assessment of dichotic 
speech recognition provides an estimate of their ability to use two 
ears to separate different signals. Patients with dichotic defi cits may 
fi nd it diffi cult to wear binaural hearing aids (Jerger et al., 1995). 
Finally, older people seem to have greater diffi culty processing rapid 
speech. Assessment of this ability may help to understand the infl u-
ence that their hearing disorder has on communication ability.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 10-8. Illustrative Case 8 is an elderly patient 
with a long-standing sensorineural hearing loss. The patient is 
a 78-year-old woman with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss 
that has progressed slowly over the last 15 years. She has worn 
hearing aids for the last 10 years, and has an annual audiologic 
re-evaluation each year. Her major complaints are in communi-
cating with her grandchildren and trying to hear in noisy cafete-
rias and restaurants. Although her hearing aids worked well for 
her at the beginning, she is not receiving the benefi t from them 
that she did 10 years ago.
Immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-8A, is consistent 
with normal middle-ear function, characterized by a Type A tym-
panogram, normal static immittance, and normal crossed and 
uncrossed refl ex thresholds bilaterally.
Pure-tone audiometric results are shown in Figure 10-8B. The pa-
tient has a bilateral, symmetric, moderate, sensorineural hearing 
loss. Hearing sensitivity is slightly better in the low frequencies 
than in the high frequencies.
Speech audiometric results are consistent with those found in older 
patients. Speech thresholds match pure-tone thresholds. Word-
recognition scores are reduced, but not below a level predictable 
from the degree of hearing sensitivity loss. However, speech rec-
ognition in the presence of competition is substantially reduced, 
as shown in Figure 10-8C, consistent with the patient’s age.

as is dichotic performance.

She also shows evidence of a dichotic defi cit, with reduced perfor-
mance in the left ear.
Results of the communication needs assessment show that she 
has communication problems a significant proportion of  the 
time in most listening environments, especially those involving 
background noise.
The patient currently uses hearing aid amplifi cation with some 
success, especially in quiet environments. Output of the hearing 
aids showed them to be functioning as expected. This patient may 
benefi t from the use of assistive listening devices, and a consulta-
tion to discuss these alternatives was recommended.

PEDIATRIC AUDIOLOGIC REFERRALS
An audiologist’s evaluation of an infant or child is aimed fi rst at 
identifying the existence of an auditory disorder and then quan-
tifying the degree of  impairment resulting from the disorder. 
Once the degree and nature of the hearing impairment have been 
quantifi ed, the goal is to assess its impact on the child’s communi-
cation ability and plan and provide prosthetic and rehabilitative 
treatment for the impairment.
In general, the audiologist is faced with three main challenges 
in the assessment of infants and children. The fi rst challenge is 
to identify children who are at risk for hearing loss and need

further evaluation. Infant hearing screening takes place shortly 
after birth, and pediatric hearing screening usually occurs at 
the time of  enrollment in school. The goal here is to identify, 
as early as possible, children with hearing loss of  a magnitude 
suffi cient to interfere with speech and language development or 
academic achievement.
The second challenge is to determine if the children identifi ed as 
being at risk for auditory disorder actually have a hearing loss and, 
if so, to determine the nature and degree of the loss. The goal here 
is to differentiate outer- and middle-ear disorder from  cochlear 
disorder and to quantify the resultant conductive and sensorineu-
ral hearing loss.
The third challenge is to assess the hearing ability of preschool 
and early school-age children suspected of having auditory pro-
cessing disorders. The goal here is to try to identify the nature 
and quantify the extent of  suprathreshold hearing deficits in 
children who generally have normal hearing sensitivity but ex-
hibit hearing diffi culties.
Infant Screening
Evaluative Goals
The goal of an infant hearing screening program is to identify in-
fants who are at risk for signifi cant permanent hearing loss and 
require further audiologic testing. The challenge of any screening 
program is to both capture all children who are at risk and, with 
similar accuracy, identify those children who are normal or not at 
risk. Several methods have been employed in an effort to meet this 
challenge, some with more success than others.
Test Strategies
Two approaches are taken to screening: (1) to identify those chil-
dren who have signifi cant sensorineural, permanent conductive, 
or neural hearing loss at birth; and (2) to identify those children 
who are at risk for delayed-onset or progressive hearing loss. Efforts 
to identify children who are at risk involve mainly an evaluation 
of prenatal, perinatal, and parental factors that place a child at 
greater risk for having delayed-onset or progressive sensorineural 
hearing loss. To identify those with hearing loss at birth, current 
Prenatal pertains to the 
time period before birth.
Perinatal pertains to the 
period around the time of 
birth, from the 28th week of 
gestation through the 7th 
day following delivery.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  439
practice in the United States is to screen the hearing of all babies 
before they are discharged from the hospital or birthing center. 
Those who pass the screening and have no risk factors are gener-
ally not re-screened but are monitored for communication develop-
ment during childhood evaluations in their medical home. Those 
who pass the initial screening but have risk factors are tested pe-
riodically throughout early childhood to ensure that hearing loss 
has not developed. Those who do not pass the initial screening are 
re-screened or scheduled to return for re-screening. A failed re-
screening leads to a more thorough audiological evaluation. The 
goal of the initial screening, then, is to identify those infants who 
need additional testing, some percentage of whom will have per-
manent, sensorineural, conductive, or neural hearing loss.
Another perspective on the screening strategy is to view it as a 
way, not of identifying those who might have signifi cant hearing 
loss, but of  identifying those who have normal hearing. That 
is, most newborns have normal hearing. Hearing loss occurs in 
1 to 3 of  1,000 births annually (Finitzo et al., 1998). Thus, if 
you were attempting to screen the hearing of all newborns, you 
might want to develop strategies that focus on identifying those 
who are normal, leaving the remainder to be evaluated with a full 
audiologic assessment.
Initial hearing screening is now accomplished most successfully 
with automated ABR testing (Sininger, 2007). A description of 
the screening techniques can be found in Chapter 9. A summary 
of the benefi ts and challenges of these techniques as they relate 
specifi cally to the screening process follows.
Risk Factors. Several factors have been identified as placing a 
newborn at risk for sensorineural hearing loss. A list of those fac-
tors was delineated previously in Table 5-1. For many years, such 
factors were used as a way of reducing the number of children 
whose hearing needed to be screened or to be monitored care-
fully over time. Applying risk factors was successful in at least 
one important way. The percentage of the general population of 
newborns who have risk factors is reasonably low, and the relative 
proportion of those who actually have hearing loss is fairly high. 
Conversely, the number of infants in the general population who 
do not have risk factors is high, and the proportion with hearing 

440  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
loss is relatively much lower. So if you were to concentrate your 
efforts on one population, it makes sense to focus on the smaller, 
at-risk population, because your return on investment of time and 
resources would be much higher.
The major problem with using risk factors alone is that there are 
probably as many children with signifi cant sensorineural hear-
ing loss who fall into the at-risk category as there are children 
who do not appear to have any risk factors. Thus, although the 
prevalence of hearing loss in the at-risk population is signifi cantly 
higher than in the nonrisk population, the numbers of children 
are the same. Thus, limiting your screening approach to this pop-
ulation would identify only about half of those with signifi cant 
sensorineural hearing loss.
The current practice in the United States is to screen hearing of 
all newborns. Infants who fail are considered necessarily at risk 
for hearing loss and are referred for re-screening. Those who have 
risk factors for progressive hearing loss are also referred for re-
screening and periodic follow-up testing. Risk factors for progres-
sive hearing loss are delineated in Table 5-1 and include:
family history,
• 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and
• 
syndromes associated with progressive loss.
• 
Behavioral Screening. Early efforts to screen hearing involved the 
presentation of relatively high-level acoustic signals and the obser-
vation, in one manner or another, of outward changes in an infant’s 
behaviors. Typical behaviors that can be observed include alerting 
movements, cessation of sucking, changes in breathing, and so on.
Although successful in identifying some babies with signifi cant 
sensorineural hearing loss, the approach proved to be less than 
adequate when viewed on the basis of  its test characteristics. 
From that perspective, too many infants with signifi cant hearing 
loss passed the screening, and too many infants with normal hear-
ing sensitivity failed the screening. Applied to a specifi c high-risk 
population and carried out with suffi cient care, the approach was 
useful in its time. Applied generally to the newborn population, 
this approach no longer meets current screening standards.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  441
Auditory Brainstem Response Screening. For a number of 
years, measurement of  the auditory brainstem response has 
been used successfully in the screening of newborns. Initial ap-
plication of this technology was limited mainly to the intensive 
care nursery, where risk factors were greatest. The cost of  the 
procedure and the skill level of the audiologist needed to carry 
out such testing simply precluded its application to wider popu-
lations. Nevertheless, its accuracy in identifying children with 
signifi cant sensorineural hearing loss made it an excellent tool 
for screening hearing.
Limitations to using the ABR for screening purposes are few. One 
is the cost of widespread application as described above. Another 
is the occasional problem of  electrical interference with other 
equipment, which is especially challenging in an environment 
such as an intensive care unit. One other limitation is that, due 
to neuromaturational delays, especially in infants who are at risk, 
the auditory brainstem response may not be fully formed at birth, 
despite normal cochlear hearing function. Thus an infant might 
fail an ABR screening and still have normal hearing sensitivity. 
The other side of that coin is that the ABR is quite good at not 
missing children who have signifi cant hearing loss.
Automated ABR (AABR) strategies have now been implemented 
which address the issue of widespread application of the tech-
nology for infant screening. These automated approaches are de-
signed to be easy to administer and result in a “Pass” or “No-Pass” 
decision (for a review, see Sininger, 2007). Automation allows the 
procedure to be administered by technical and support staff in a 
routine manner that can be applied to all newborns.
Otoacoustic Emissions Screening. In general, otoacoustic emis-
sions are present in ears with normally functioning cochleas 
and absent in ears with more than mild sensorineural hearing 
losses. In this way, OAE measurement initially appeared to be an 
excellent strategy for infant hearing screening. When OAEs are 
absent, a hearing disorder is present, making it useful in iden-
tifying those who need additional assessment. When OAEs are 
present, it generally means that the outer, middle, and inner ears 
are functioning properly and that hearing sensitivity should be 
normal or nearly so.

442  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Limitations to using OAEs for screening purposes are few, but 
 important. One is that they are more easily recorded in quieter 
environments. This can be challenging in a noisy nursery. An-
other is that the technique is susceptible to obstruction in sound 
transmission of the outer and middle ears. Thus, an ear canal of a 
newborn that is not patent or contains fl uid, as many do, will re-
sult in the absence of an OAE, even if cochlear function is normal. 
The result is similar for middle-ear disorder. This susceptibility to 
these peripheral infl uences can make OAE screening challenging, 
 resulting in too many normal children failing the screen.
A more important limitation to OAE use in screening is that some 
infants with signifi cant auditory disorder have quite normal and 
healthy OAEs. Recall from the discussion in Chapter 4, that there 
is a group of disorders termed auditory neuropathy that share the 
common clinical signs of absent ABR, present OAE, and signifi -
cant hearing sensitivity loss. Perhaps as many as one in four in-
fants with signifi cant hearing loss, presumably of inner hair cell 
origin, has preserved outer hair cell function and measurable 
OAEs. These children would be missed if screened exclusively with 
OAE measure.
Combined Approaches. There are advantages and disadvantages 
to all screening techniques. Most of  the disadvantages can be 
overcome by combining techniques in a careful and systematic 
way. Current practice relies on automated ABR as the initial 
screening technique in regular care nurseries and regular, 
nonautomated ABR in intensive care nurseries. If there is evidence 
of neural synchrony in an infant during the initial screening, for 
example, a response recorded in one ear or at higher intensity 
levels, then follow-up screening can be safely accomplished with 
OAE measures. This type of combined strategy can help to reduce 
the problems of overreferral for additional testing.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 10-9. Illustrative Case 9 is an infant born in a 
regular-care nursery. She was the product of a normal pregnancy 
and delivery. There is no reported family history of hearing loss, 
and the infant does not fall into any of the risk-factor categories 
for hearing loss. She was tested within the first 24 hours after 
When something is open or 
unobstructed, it is patent.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  443
birth as part of a program that provides infant hearing screening 
for all newborns at her local hospital.
The child was screened with automated ABR. The automated in-
strument delivered what was judged to be a valid test and could not 
detect the presence of an ABR to clicks presented at 35 dB HL.
Results of an ABR threshold assessment are shown in Figure 10-9. 
ABRs were recorded in both ears down to 60 dB by air conduction. 
No responses could be recorded by bone conduction at equipment 
limits of 40 dB. These results predict the presence of a moderate, 
primarily sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally.
This child is not likely to develop speech and language normally 
without hearing aid intervention. Ear impressions were made, 
and a hearing aid evaluation was scheduled.

444  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Pediatric Evaluation
Evaluative Goals
The goals of a pediatric evaluation are to (1) identify the existence 
of an auditory disorder, (2) identify the nature of the disorder, 
and (3) identify the nature and extent of the hearing impairment 
caused by the disorder. Although these goals are not unlike those 
of the adult evaluation, infants and young children present spe-
cial challenges in reaching them.
A child who has been referred for an audiologic consultation has 
usually been screened and determined to be at risk for hearing im-
pairment. Infants are usually referred because they have failed a 
hearing screening or have some other known risk factor for hear-
ing loss. Young children are usually referred either because their 
speech and language are not developing normally or because they 
have otologic disease, and a physician is interested in understand-
ing its effect on hearing. Older children are usually referred be-
cause of an otologic problem, because they have failed a school 
screening, or because they are suspected of having auditory pro-
cessing disorder.
The goals of the evaluation for each of these groups will vary de-
pending on the reason for referral and the nature of the referral 
source. The approach can vary depending on the nature of the 
goal. For example, in young infants, the question is often an audi-
ologic one, not an otologic one. In young children, it can be either. 
In older children, it might not even be related to hearing sensitiv-
ity, but rather to suprathreshold auditory ability.
Test Strategies
The following are guidelines for test strategies based on chrono-
logic age. Because the relationship of chronologic age to func-
tional age varies from child to child, there may be considerable 
overlap in these age categories.
In most clinical settings, despite whatever screening might have 
led to a referral, many if not most children who are evaluated end 
up having normal hearing sensitivity. As unusual as it may seem, 
much of a pediatric audiologist’s time is spent evaluating children 
with normal hearing. As such, test strategies tend to be designed 

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  445
around quickly identifying normal-hearing children so that re-
sources can be committed to evaluating children who truly have 
hearing impairment. So the process of pediatric assessment may 
begin with more of a screening approach, again aimed at eliminat-
ing from further testing those individuals who do not require it.
Infants 0 to 6 Months. Infants are usually referred for audiologic 
consultation because they failed a hearing screening or because 
they have been identifi ed as being at risk for hearing loss. Many of 
these patients have normal hearing. Thus, the approach to their 
assessment is usually one of re-screening, followed by assessment 
and confi rmation of hearing loss in those who fail the re-screening. 
A diagram of the approach is shown in Figure 10-10.
A productive approach to the initial re-screening is to combine 
tympanometry, ABR screening, and/or OAE measurement

446  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
in combination with behavioral observation audiometry in 
an effort to identify those with normal hearing. With proper 
preparation, infants are likely to sleep through ABR re-
screenings. In cases when they will not sleep, OAEs can be 
used as an alternative. Precautions must be taken, however, 
to ensure that the child has the requisite neural synchrony to 
have normal hearing sensitivity. OAE measurement alone will 
not suffice. In these cases, the wise audiologist will insist on 
some other evidence of  adequate hearing such as behavioral 
observation audiometry.
Otoacoustic emissions can be carried out routinely in this popu-
lation. Tympanometry is a bit more challenging, however, due 
mostly to ear canal size. Results of tympanometry are more valid 
with use of a higher frequency probe tone than is customary for 
older children and adults (Baldwin, 2006). Nevertheless, tympa-
nometry can give a general impression of the integrity of middle 
ear function at this age, especially if it is abnormal.
Behavioral observation audiometry involves the controlled pre-
sentation of signals in a sound ﬁ eld and careful observation of 
the infant’s response to those signals (Madell, 1998). Minimal 
response levels to signals across a frequency range can be de-
termined with a fair degree of accuracy and reliability, even in 
young infants.
The combination of OAEs, tympanometry, ABR screening, and be-
havioral audiometry should determine the need for additional au-
diologic testing. If an infant is found to have normal cochlear and 
middle-ear function, the child passes the hearing screening, and 
no further testing is required. If the child does not pass the screen-
ing, then a hearing loss may exist, and the child should be evalu-
ated further with auditory evoked potentials.
Auditory brainstem response audiometry is used to verify the ex-
istence of a hearing loss, help determine the nature of the hear-
ing loss, and quantify the degree of  loss. Judicious use of  ABR 
measures will provide an estimate of the type, degree, and slope 
of the hearing loss. In addition, auditory steady-state responses 
can be used effectively at this age to predict an audiogram with 
adequate precision.
Sound ﬁ eld is an area or 
room into which sound is 
introduced via a loudspeaker.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  447
Children 6 Months to 2 Years. Young children are usually re-
ferred to an audiologist (1) because they have risk factors for 
progressive hearing loss, (2) as part of an otologic evaluation of 
middle-ear disorder, (3) for audiologic consultation because the 
parents or caregivers are concerned about hearing loss, or (4) the 
child has failed to develop speech and language as expected. Many 
of these patients have middle-ear disorder, and many have normal 
hearing. Thus, the fi rst step in their assessment is again almost a 
screening approach, followed by assessment and confi rmation of 
middle-ear disorder and hearing loss in those who fail the screen-
ing. A diagram of the approach is shown in Figure 10-11.
A useful way to begin the assessment is by measuring otoacoustic 
emissions. If emissions are normal, the middle-ear mechanism is 
normal. If a sensorineural hearing loss exists, it is no more than a 
FIGURE 10-11 A pediatric hearing consultation model for assessing children age 6 months to 2 years.

mild one and, in general, should not preclude speech and language 
development. If otoacoustic emissions are absent, the cause of that 
absence must be explored because the culprit could be anything from 
mild middle-ear disorder to profound sensorineural hearing loss.
Immittance audiometry is an important next step in the evalua-
tion process. If otoacoustic emissions are normal, prediction of 
hearing loss by acoustic refl exes can be used as a cross-check for 
normal hearing sensitivity. If emissions are abnormal, immittance 
audiometry can shed light as to whether their absence is due to 
middle-ear disorder. If immittance measures indicate middle-ear 
disorder, the absence of  otoacoustic emissions is equivocal in 
terms of predicting hearing loss.
In the absence of otoacoustic emissions information, immittance 
audiometry is a good beginning. Normal immittance measures 
suggest that any hearing problem that might be detected is due to 
sensorineural rather than conductive impairment. Normal immit-
tance measures also allow assessment of acoustic refl ex thresh-
olds as a means of screening hearing sensitivity. If prediction of 
hearing level by acoustic refl exes suggests normal hearing sen-
sitivity, the audiologist has a head start in knowing what might 
be expected from behavioral audiometry. Similarly, if the predic-
tion is that a hearing loss might be present, the audiologist is so 
alerted. Abnormal immittance measures indicating middle-ear 
disorder suggest that any hearing problem that might be detected 
has at least some conductive component. The conductive compo-
nent may be the entire hearing loss or it may be superimposed on 
a sensorineural hearing loss. Immittance audiometry provides no 
insight into this issue. If immittance measures are abnormal, little 
or no information can be gleaned about hearing sensitivity.
Depending on a child’s functional level, behavioral thresholds can 
often be obtained by visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) 
(Moore et al., 1975; Madell, 1998; Gravel & Hood, 1999). VRA is 
a technique in which the child’s behavioral response to a sound, 
usually a head turn toward the sound source, is conditioned 
by reinforcement with some type of  visual stimulus. Careful 
conditioning and a cooperative child may permit the establishment 
of threshold or near-threshold levels to speech and tonal signals. 
A typical approach is to obtain speech thresholds in a sound fi eld, 
followed by thresholds to as many warble-tone stimuli as possible. 
Visual reinforcement 
audiometry (VRA) is an 
audiometric technique used 
in pediatric assessment 
in which an appropriate 
response to a signal 
presentation, such as a head 
turn toward the speaker, is 
rewarded by the activation 
of a light or lighted toy.
A warble tone is a 
frequency-modulated pure 
tone used in sound ﬁ eld 
testing.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  449
If a young child will wear earphones, and many will tolerate insert 
earphones, ear-specific information can be obtained to assess 
hearing symmetry. If a child will tolerate wearing a bone vibrator, a 
speech threshold by bone is often a very valuable result to obtain.
As in any testing of children, the assessment becomes somewhat 
of a race against time, as attention is not a strong point at this age. 
Although the goal of behavioral audiometry is to obtain hearing 
threshold levels across the audiometric frequency range in both 
ears, this can be a fairly lofty goal for some children. The approach 
and the speed at which information can be gathered is the art of 
testing this age group. It is probably far better to understand hear-
ing in the sound fi eld, which in general refl ects hearing in the bet-
ter ear, and have an estimate of hearing symmetry than to have a 
complete audiogram in one ear only.
In many children of this age group, a defi nitive assessment can 
be made of hearing ability by the combined use of OAEs, immit-
tance measures, and behavioral audiometry, especially if hearing 
is  normal. However, in some cases, due to the need to confi rm a 
hearing loss or because the child was not cooperative with such 
testing, auditory evoked potentials are used to predict hearing sen-
sitivity. Specifi cally, the auditory brainstem response is measured 
to verify the existence of a hearing loss, help determine the nature 
of the hearing loss, and quantify the degree of loss. Judicious use 
of ABR and ASSR measures will provide an estimate of the type, 
degree, and slope of hearing loss in both ears and may be the only 
reliable measure attainable in some children of this age group.
You will recall that ABR and ASSR measures require that a patient be 
still or sleeping throughout the evaluation. Children in this younger 
age group, and, indeed, some children up to 4 or 5 years of age, can 
seldom be effi ciently tested in natural sleep. Therefore, pediatric ABR 
assessment is often carried out while the child is under sedation 
or general anesthesia. Sedation techniques vary, and all pose an 
additional challenge to evoked potential measurement. However, 
once the child is properly sedated, the AEP measures provide the best 
confi rmation available of the results of behavioral audiometry.
Children Older than 2 Years. Not unlike their younger counterparts, 
children in this age group are usually referred to an audiologist 
either as part of an otologic evaluation of middle-ear disorder or 

450  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
for audiologic consultation because the parents or caregivers are 
concerned about hearing loss or the child has failed to develop speech 
and language as expected. Many of these patients have middle-ear 
disorder, and many have some degree of hearing impairment.
Otoacoustic emissions can be used very effectively as an initial 
screening tool in this population. Normal emissions indicate a 
middle-ear mechanism that is functioning properly and sug-
gest that any sensorineural hearing impairment that might exist 
would be mild in nature. Absent otoacoustic emissions are consis-
tent with either middle-ear disorder or some degree of sensorineu-
ral hearing loss.
Immittance audiometry in this age group, as in all children, can 
provide a large amount of useful information. If tympanograms, 
static immittance, and acoustic reflexes are normal, middle-ear 
disorder can be ruled out, and a prediction can be made about the 
presence or absence of sensorineural hearing loss. Combined with 
the results of OAE testing, the audiologist will begin to have an ac-
curate picture of hearing ability, especially if all results are normal. 
If immittance audiometry is abnormal, the nature of the middle-
ear disorder will be apparent, but no predictions can be made about 
hearing sensitivity.
At this age, children can often be tested with conditioned play 
audiometry, in which the reinforcer is some type of play activity, 
such as tossing blocks in a box or putting pegs in a board (Madell, 
1998; Gravel & Hood, 1999). Usually under earphones, the 
typical first step is to establish speech-recognition or speech 
awareness thresholds, depending on language skills, in both ears. 
Speech awareness thresholds can be obtained by conditioning the 
child to respond to the presence of the examiner’s voice. Speech-
recognition thresholds are obtained in the youngest children by, 
for example, pointing to body parts; in young children, by pointing 
to pictures presented in a closed-set format; and in older children 
by having them repeat familiar spondaic words. The next step is 
to try to establish pure-tone thresholds at as many frequencies 
as possible. Behavioral bone-conduction thresholds are also 
attainable in this age group. Again, a successful strategy is to 
begin with speech thresholds and move to pure-tone thresholds.
Conditioned play 
audiometry is an 
audiometric technique used 
in pediatric assessment in 
which a child is conditioned 
to respond to a stimulus by 
engaging in some game, 
such as dropping a block in a 
bucket, when a tone is heard.
Closed-set means the 
choice is from a limited set; 
multiple choice.
A spondee is a two-syllable 
word spoken with equal 
emphasis on each syllable.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  451
If reliable behavioral thresholds can be obtained, especially in com-
bination with immittance and OAE measures, results of the audio-
logic evaluation will provide the necessary information about type 
and degree of hearing loss. Unfortunately, even in children of this 
age group, and especially in the 2- to 3-year-old group, cooperation 
for audiometric testing is not always assured, and reliability of re-
sults may not be acceptable. In these cases, auditory evoked poten-
tials can be used either to establish hearing levels or to confi rm the 
results of behavioral testing. Again in children of this age, judicious 
use of ABR measures will provide an estimate of the type, degree, 
and slope of the hearing loss. Once again as well, sedation is likely 
to be needed in order to obtain useful evoked potential results.
The Cross-Check Principle. There is a principle in pediatric testing 
that is worth learning early and demanding of yourself throughout 
your professional career known as the cross-check principle of pedi-
atric audiometry (Jerger & Hayes, 1976). The cross-check principle 
simply states that no single test result obtained during pediatric assess-
ment should be considered valid until you have obtained an independent 
cross-check of its validity. Stated another way, if you rely on one au-
diometric measure as the answer in your assessment of young chil-
dren, you will probably misdiagnose children during your career. 
Conversely, if you insist on an independent cross-check of your re-
sults, the odds against such an occurrence improve dramatically.
Practically, we do not use the cross-check principle when we are 
screening hearing. Here we simply assume a certain percentage 
of risk of being wrong. Such is the nature of screening. However, 
if a child has been referred to you for an audiologic evaluation be-
cause of a suspected hearing loss, then you have a professional 
obligation to be correct in your assessment. That is not always 
easy, and it is certainly not always effi cient, but if you do not get 
the answer right, then who does? Perhaps an example will serve 
to illustrate this point.
The patient was 18 months old and enrolled in a multidisciplinary 
treatment program for pervasive delays in development. The 
speech-language pathologist suspected a hearing loss because of 
the child’s behavior. A very experienced audiologist evaluated the 
child. Immittance measures showed patent pressure-equalization 

452  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
tubes in both ears, placed recently due to chronic middle-ear 
 disorder. No other information could be obtained from immit-
tance testing because of the tubes. Results of visual-reinforcement 
audiometry to warble tones presented in a sound field showed 
thresholds better than 20 dB HL across the frequency range. The 
audiologist concluded that hearing was normal in at least one ear 
and dismissed the speech-language pathologist’s concern about 
hearing. Six months later, the speech-language pathologist asked 
the audiologist to evaluate again, certain that the audiologist 
was incorrect the fi rst time. On re-evaluation, immittance testing 
showed normal tympanograms, normal static immittance, and no 
measurable acoustic refl exes. OAEs were absent. Behavioral mea-
sures continued to suggest no more than a mild hearing loss. ABR 
testing revealed a profound sensorineural hearing loss. Behavioral 
testing in this case was misleading, due probably to undetectable 
parental cueing of the child in the sound fi eld.
This is just one of many examples of misdiagnosis that could have 
been prevented by insisting on a cross-check. In this case, results 
of behavioral audiometry were incorrect. There are also examples 
of cases in which ABR measures were absent due to brainstem 
disorder even though hearing sensitivity was normal or cases in 
which OAEs were normal but hearing was not. Although test re-
sults usually agree, these cases happen often enough that the best 
clinicians take heed. The solution is really rather simple. If you al-
ways demand from yourself a cross-check, then you can be confi -
dent in your results.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 10-10. Illustrative Case 10 is a young child with 
a fl uctuating, mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss bilater-
ally. The patient is a 4-year-old girl. The hearing loss appears to be 
caused by CMV or cytomegalic inclusion disease, a viral infection 
usually transmitted in utero. There is no family history of hearing 
loss and no other signifi cant medical history.
Immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-12A, is consistent 
with normal middle-ear function, characterized by a Type A tym-
panogram, normal static immittance, and normal crossed and 
uncrossed refl ex thresholds bilaterally. SPAR predicts sensorineu-
ral hearing loss bilaterally.

Otoacoustic emissions are present in the right ear in the 1000 Hz 
frequency region, but absent at higher frequencies. OAEs are ab-
sent in the left ear, as shown in Figure 10-12B.
Air-conduction pure-tone thresholds were obtained via play audi-
ometry and are shown in Figure 10-12C. The patient responded 
consistently by placing pegs in a pegboard.
Bone-conduction thresholds could not be obtained conventionally 
because the child had diffi culty responding to tones presented to 
the bone vibrator in the presence of masking noise presented to an 
earphone. However, the SAL technique was used to estimate the 
amount of air-bone gap. Bone-conduction thresholds estimated 
by the SAL test showed the loss to be sensorineural in nature.
Speech audiometric results were consistent with the hearing 
loss. Speech thresholds matched pure-tone thresholds. Word-
recognition scores were good, despite the degree of hearing loss.
This child is a candidate for hearing aid amplification and will 
likely benefit substantially from hearing aid use. A hearing aid 
consultation was recommended.

tests. Instead, its diagnosis relies on operational defi nitions, based 
mostly on results of  speech audiometry. Basing the diagnosis 
solely on behavioral measures such as these can be difficult 
because interpretation of  the test results can be influenced by 
nonauditory factors such as language delays, attentional defi cits, 
and impaired cognitive functioning (Cocace & McFarland, 1998). 
Thus, one important evaluative goal is to separate APD from 
these other disorders.
The importance of this evaluative goal cannot be overstated. One 
of the main problems with APD measures is that too many chil-
dren who do not have APD fail some of the tests. This results in a 
large number of false-positive test results, which not only burdens 

456  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
the health-care system with children who do not need further 
testing, but also muddles the issue of APD and its contribution to 
a child’s problems. The reason that so many children who do not 
have APD fail these tests is that nonauditory factors infl uence the 
interpretation of results.
This problem has been illustrated clearly in a number of  stud-
ies. For example, in one study (Gascon et al., 1986) children who 
were considered to be hyperactive and have attention defi cit dis-
orders were evaluated with several speech audiometric tests of 
auditory processing ability and a battery of tests aimed at mea-
suring attention ability.
Both the APD test battery and the attention test battery were 
administered before and after the children were medicated with 
stimulants to control hyperactivity. Results showed that most of 
the children improved on the APD test battery following stimu-
lant administration. What these results showed is that the APD 
tests are very sensitive to the effects of attention. Stated another 
way, children who have attention disorders often perform poorly 
on these APD measures even if they do not have APD, because 
they cannot attend to the task thoroughly enough for the audi-
tory system to be evaluated. As a result, the effects of auditory 
processing disorder cannot be separated from the effects that at-
tention defi cits have on a child’s ability to complete these particu-
lar test measures.
What this study and others suggest is that, if  our clinical goal 
is to test exclusively for APD, then the infl uences of  attention, 
cognition, and language skills must be controlled during the 
evaluation process.
Test Strategies
Well-controlled speech audiometric measures, in conjunction 
with auditory evoked potential measures, can be powerful diag-
nostic tools for assessing APD. Although there is no single gold 
standard against which to judge the effectiveness of APD testing, 
it can be operationally defi ned on the basis of behavioral and elec-
trophysiologic test results.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  457
Speech Audiometry. There are numerous speech audiometric 
measures of  auditory processing ability. Most of  them evolved 
from adult measures that were designed to aid in the diagnosis 
of  neurological disease in the pre-MRI era. The application of 
many of  these adult measures to the pediatric population has 
not been altogether successful, largely because of a lack of con-
trol over linguistic and cognitive complexity in applying them to 
young children.
Speech audiometric approaches have been developed that have 
proven to be valid and reliable (Jerger et al., 1988). When they are 
administered under properly controlled acoustic conditions, with 
materials of appropriate language age and testing strategies that 
control for the infl uences of attention and cognition, these mea-
sures permit a diagnosis with reasonable accuracy in most chil-
dren (Jerger et al., 1980; 1983).
Perhaps an example of a successful testing strategy will illustrate 
the challenges and some of the ways to solve them. One exam-
ple of a APD test battery is summarized in Table 10-1. The strat-
egy used with this test battery is to vary several parameters of 
the speech testing across a continuum in order to “sensitize” the 
speech materials or to make them more diffi cult. The parameters 
include intensity, signal-to-noise ratio, redundancy of informa-
tional content, and monotic versus dichotic performance.
The difference in dB between 
a sound of interest and 
background noise is called 
the signal-to-noise ratio.
Redundancy is the 
abundance of information 
available to the listener 
due to the substantial 
informational content of 
a speech signal and the 
capacity of the central 
auditory nervous system.
Monotic refers to different 
signals presented to the 
same ear.
Dichotic refers to 
different signals presented 
simultaneously to each ear.

458  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Suppose we are testing a young child. We might choose to use 
the Pediatric Speech Intelligibility (PSI) test (Jerger et al., 1980). In 
this test, words are presented with a competing message in the 
same ear at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) or message-to-
competition ratios (MCRs). Testing at a better ratio provides an 
easier listening condition to ensure that the child knows the vo-
cabulary, is cognitively capable of performing the task, and can 
attend adequately enough to complete the procedure. Then the 
ratio is made more diffi cult to challenge the integrity of the audi-
tory nervous system. At the more diffi cult MCR, a performance-
intensity (PI) function is obtained to evaluate for rollover of the 
function, or poorer performance at higher intensity levels. This 
assessment in the intensity domain is also designed to assess au-
ditory nervous system integrity.
Both words and sentences are usually presented with competition 
in the same ear and the opposite ear. The word-versus-sentence 
comparison is used to assess the child’s ability to process speech 
signals of different redundancies. The same-ear versus opposite-
ear competition comparison is used to assess the difference be-
tween monotic and dichotic auditory processing ability.
An illustration of the results of these test procedures and how 
they serve to control the nonauditory infl uences is shown in the 
speech audiometric results in Figure 10-13. The patient is a 4-year 
1-month-old child who was diagnosed with APD. Hearing sensitiv-
ity is within normal limits in both ears. However, speech audiomet-
ric results are strikingly abnormal. In the right ear, the PI functions 
for both words and sentences show rollover. Rollover of these func-
tions cannot be explained as attention, linguistic, or cognitive 
 disorders because such disorders are not intensity-level dependent. 
In other words, language, cognition, or attention defi cits are not 
present at one intensity level and absent at another. In addition, in 
the left ear, there is a substantial discrepancy between understand-
ing of sentences and understanding of words. This is obviously not 
a language problem, because, at 60 dB HL, the child understands 
all of the sentences correctly and, at an easier listening condition, 
the child identifi es all of the words correctly. The child is clearly ca-
pable of doing the task linguistically and cognitively. Thus, use of PI 
functions, various SNRs, and word-versus-sentence  comparisons 

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  459
permits the assessment of auditory processing ability in a manner 
that reduces the likelihood of nonauditory factors infl uencing the 
interpretation of test results.
Auditory Evoked Potentials. Auditory evoked potentials may 
be used to corroborate speech audiometric testing (e.g. Stach & 
 Loiselle, 1993). Specifi cally, the auditory middle latency response 
and late latency response have been found to be abnormal in chil-
dren who have APD. Although encouraging, a lack of suffi cient 
normative data on young children reduces the ease of interpreta-
tion of auditory evoked potentials on an individual basis at this 
point in time (Martin et al., 2007). Advances in evoked potential 
technologies are likely to enhance APD diagnosis.

In conjunction with thorough speech, language, and neuropsycho-
logical evaluations, the use of well-controlled speech audiometric 
measures and auditory evoked potentials can be quite powerful in 
defi ning the presence or absence of an auditory processing disorder.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 10-11. Illustrative Case 11 is a young child with 
normal hearing sensitivity but with auditory processing disorder. 
The patient is a 6-year-old girl with a history of chronic otitis me-
dia. Although her parents have always suspected that she had a 
hearing problem, previous screening results were consistent with 
normal hearing sensitivity. Previous tympanometric screening re-
sults showed either Type B tympanograms during periods of otitis 
media or normal tympanograms during times of remission from 
otitis media.
Immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-14A is consistent 
with normal middle-ear function, characterized by a Type A tym-
panogram, normal static immittance, and normal crossed and 
uncrossed refl ex thresholds bilaterally.
Pure-tone audiometric results are shown in Figure 10-14B. Hear-
ing sensitivity is normal in both ears.
Speech audiometry reveals a different picture. Results are shown 
in Figure 10-14C. For both ears, the pattern is one of rollover of 
the performance-intensity functions for both word recognition and 
sentence recognition in the presence of competition. In addition, 
she shows a dichotic defi cit, with poor performance in her left ear. 
These results are consistent with auditory processing disorder.
Auditory evoked potentials provide additional support for the di-
agnosis. Although ABRs are present and normal bilaterally, mid-
dle and late latency responses are not measurable in response to 
signals presented to either ear.
This child is likely to experience diffi culty in noisy and distract-
ing environments. She may be at risk for academic achievement 
problems if her learning environment is not structured to be a 
quiet one. The parents were provided with information about the 

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  461
nature of the disorder and the strategies that can be used to al-
ter listening environments in ways that will be useful to this child. 
The patient will be re-evaluated periodically, especially during the 
early academic years.

Immittance measures (A) are consistent with normal middle-ear function. Pure-
tone audiometric results (B) show normal hearing sensitivity in both ears. Speech 
audiometric results (C) show signiﬁ cant rollover of PI functions for both word and

on the left ear.

FUNCTIONAL HEARING LOSS
Exaggerated, functional, or nonorganic hearing loss is a timeless 
audiologic challenge. Functional hearing loss is the exaggeration 
or feigning of hearing impairment. In many cases, particularly in 
adults, an organic hearing loss exists (Gelfand & Silman, 1985) 
but is willfully exaggerated, usually for compensatory purposes. 
In other cases, often secondary to trauma of some kind, the entire 
hearing loss will be willfully feigned. This is commonly referred to 
as malingering.
Adults and children feign hearing loss for different reasons. Adults 
are usually seeking secondary or fi nancial gain. For  example, an em-
ployee may be applying for worker’s compensation for hearing loss 
secondary to exposure to excessive sound in the workplace. Or some-
one discharged from the military may be seeking compensation for

I also enjoy supervising students through their VA rotations.
Why Audiology? I like that audiology is a specialized science and profession, yet has 
a broad scope of practice. As an audiologist, I have the rewarding opportunity to improve 
 patients’ communicative abilities, which improves their quality of life.

hearing loss from excessive noise exposure. Although most  patients 
have legitimate concerns and provide honest results, a small per-
centage tries to exaggerate hearing loss in the mistaken notion that 
it will result in greater compensation. There are also those who have 
been involved in an accident or altercation and are involved in a 
lawsuit against an insurance company or someone else. Occasion-
ally such a person will think that feigning a hearing loss will lead to 
greater monetary award. In either case of malingering, the patient 
is wasting valuable professional resources in an attempt to reap fi -
nancial gain. Although these cases are always interesting and chal-
lenging to the audiologist, the clinical approach changes from one 
of caregiving to something a little more direct.
Children with functional hearing loss often are using hearing 
 impairment as an excuse for poor performance in school or to 

464  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
gain attention. This is often referred to as factitious hearing loss. 
The idea may have emerged from watching a classmate or sibling 
getting special treatment for having a hearing impairment or it 
may be secondary to a bout of otitis media and the consequent 
parental attention paid to the episode. The challenge is to identify 
this functional loss before the child begins to realize the secondary 
gains inherent in having hearing loss. This is challenging busi-
ness. Children feigning hearing loss need support. Their parents, 
on the other hand, may not be overly pleased to learn that they 
have taken time off of work and spent money to discover that their 
child was faking a hearing loss. Counseling is an important aspect 
following the discovery of a factitious hearing loss in a child.
Regardless of the reason for functional hearing loss, the role of 
the audiologist is (1) to detect that a functional component exists 
and (2) to resolve the true hearing sensitivity.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  465
Indicators of Functional Hearing Loss
The evaluation of functional hearing loss begins with identifi ca-
tion of the existence of the disorder. There are several indicators 
of the existence of a functional component, some of which are 
audiometric and some of which are nonaudiometric.
Nonaudiometric Indicators
Careful observation of a patient from the very beginning of the 
evaluation can often provide indications of  the likelihood of  a 
functional component to a hearing loss. For example, as a general 
rule, patients with functional hearing loss are late for appoint-
ments. Perhaps the thought is that the later they are, the more 
rushed will be the evaluation, and the greater the likelihood that 
their malingering will not be detected. It seems important to point 
out that the argument is not transitive. That is, clearly, not every-
one who is late has a functional hearing loss. Nevertheless, those 
who have functional hearing loss are often late.
Other signs of functional hearing loss can also be detected early. 
Patients with functional hearing loss will often exhibit behaviors 
that are exaggerated compared to what might be expected from 
someone with an organic loss. For example, patients with true 
hearing impairment are usually alert in the waiting room be-
cause of concern that they will not hear their appointment being 
called. Those with functional hearing loss may overexaggerate to 
the point that they will appear to struggle when they are being 
identifi ed in the waiting room. This exaggeration may continue 
throughout the process of greeting the patient and taking a case 
history. Experienced audiologists understand how individuals with 
true hearing impairment function in the world. For example, they 
seldom bring attention to themselves by purposefully raising their 
voices or by cupping their hands behind their ears. Those feigning 
hearing loss are likely to not handle this type of communication 
very subtly. As another example, the case history process is full of 
context that allows patients with true hearing impairment to an-
swer questions reasonably routinely and graciously. Patients with 
functional hearing loss will often struggle inappropriately with 
this task.
Other behaviors that are often attributable to patients with func-
tional hearing loss are excessive impatience, tension, and irritability.

466  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
One other nonaudiometric indicator that is not subtle but supris-
ingly often overlooked is the reason for the referral and evalua-
tion. Is the patient having a hearing evaluation for compensation 
purposes? This is a question that should be asked. Again, many 
who are seeking compensation will have legitimate hearing loss 
and will be forthcoming during the audiologic evaluation. But 
if compensation or litigation is involved, the audiologist must be 
alert to the possibility of functional hearing loss.
Audiometric Indicators
There are also several audiometric indicators of the presence of 
functional hearing loss. First, and perhaps most obvious, the ama-
teur malingerer will display substantial variability in response to 
pure-tone audiometry. However, the more malingerers are tested, 
the more consistent their responses become. An experienced ma-
lingerer will not demonstrate variability in responding.
One important audiometric indicator is a disparity between the 
speech-recognition threshold and pure-tone thresholds (Ventry & 
Chaiklin, 1965). In patients who are feigning or exaggerating hear-
ing loss, the speech recognition threshold is usually signifi cantly 
better than pure-tone thresholds. Thus, it is important to begin test-
ing with the SRT and then evaluate whether the pure-tone thresh-
olds match up appropriately.
These and other indicators alert the experienced audiologist to the 
possibility of functional hearing loss:
variability in response to pure-tone audiometry
• 
lack of correspondence of SRT to pure-tone thresholds
• 
bone conduction poorer than air conduction
• 
very fl at audiogram
• 
lack of a

Assessment of Functional Hearing Loss
If functional hearing loss is suspected but not confi rmed, audio-
metric measures should be carried out to confi rm the existence 
of a functional component. Once functional hearing loss is con-
fi rmed, several strategies can be used to determine the true na-
ture of hearing sensitivity (for a review, see Durrant et al., 1997; 
Gelfand, 2001).
Strategies to Detect Exaggeration
Sometimes a patient will feign complete deafness in one or both 
ears and behavioral audiometric measures will not be available 
to judge the validity of  responding. The most useful tools to 
detect functional hearing losses in these cases are the sensitivity 
prediction by acoustic refl exes and the use of otoacoustic emissions. 
If the results of these measures are normal, then functional loss 
has been detected and the search for true thresholds can begin. 
It is just that simple in patients who are truly malingering. The 
problem is that most feigned hearing loss is actually a functional 
overlay on an existing hearing loss. In such cases, both reflex 
predictions and OAEs will indicate the presence of hearing loss, 
and the functional component will not be detectable.
In cases where a patient is feigning complete bilateral loss, simple 
clinical strategies can be used to determine that the loss is func-
tional. One is to attempt to elicit a startle response by presenting 
an unexpected, high-intensity signal into the audiometric sound 
fi eld. Another is to present some form of an unexpected comment 
through the earphones and watch for the patient’s reaction. There 
are also some older formalized tests that were championed in the 
days before electrophysiologic measures. For example, one test, 
the Lombard voice intensity test, made use of the fact that a per-
son’s voice increases in intensity when masking noise is presented 
to both ears. In this case, the patient was asked to read a passage. 
Vocal level was monitored while white noise was introduced into 
the earphones. Any change in vocal level would indicate that the 

468  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
patient was perceiving the white noise and feigning the hearing 
loss. Another example is the delayed auditory feedback test. This test 
made use of the fact that patients’ speech becomes dysfl uent if the 
perception of their own voice is delayed by a certain amount. To 
test this patients were asked to read a passage. A microphone re-
corded the speech and delivered it back into the patients’ ears with 
a carefully controlled time delay. Any change in fl uency would in-
dicate that the patients were hearing their own voices and feign-
ing a hearing loss.
In cases where the patient is feigning a complete unilateral 
hearing loss, the best strategy to detect the malingering is 
the Stenger test (Altshuler, 1970). A detailed description of 
procedures for carrying out the Stenger test is presented in the 
following box. Briefl y, the test is based on the Stenger principle, 
which states that only the louder of identical sounds presented 
simultaneously to both ears will be perceived. For example, 
if  you have normal hearing, and I simultaneously present a 
1000-Hz tone to your right ear at 30 dB HL and to your left ear 
at 40 dB HL, you will only perceive the sound in your left ear. In 
the Stenger test, a tone is presented to the good ear at a level at 
which the patient responds. The signal in the poorer ear is raised 
until the patient stops responding. Patients who are feigning 
a hearing loss will stop responding as soon as they perceive 
sound in the suspect ear, unaware that sound is also still being 
presented to the good ear at a perceptible level. The Stenger test 
is so simple, valid, and reliable that many audiologists use it 
routinely in any case of unilateral hearing loss just to be sure of 
its authenticity.
Strategies to Determine “True” Thresholds
Once a functional hearing loss has been detected, the challenge 
becomes one of  determining actual hearing sensitivity levels. 
Sometimes this is very simply a matter of reinstructing the patient. 
Thus, the fi rst step is to make patients aware that you have detected 
their exaggeration, provide them with a reasonable “face-saving” 
explanation for why they may have been having difficulty with 
the pure-tone task, reinstruct them, and reestablish pure-tone 
thresholds. Some patients will immediately recant and begin 
cooperating. Others will not.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  469
The Stenger test: A Good Clinical 
Friend
A good clinical rule to live by: If a patient has a 
unilateral hearing loss or signiﬁ cant asymmetry, 
always do a Stenger test.
The Stenger test is a simple and fast technique 
for verifying the organicity of a hearing loss. If 
the hearing loss is organic, you will have wasted a 
minute of your life verifying that fact. If the hear-
ing loss is feigned or exaggerated, you will have 
rapid veriﬁ cation of the presence of a functional 
component.
The Stenger test is easy to do. A form is pro-
vided in Figure 10-15 to make it even easier.
Either speech or pure-tone stimuli are presented 
simultaneously to both, ears. Initially, the signal is 
presented to the good ear at a comfortable, audi-
ble level of about 20 dB SL and to the poorer ear 
at 20 dB below the level of the good ear. The pa-
tient will respond, because the patient will hear 
the signal presented to the good ear. Testing pro-
ceeds by increasing the intensity level of the sig-
nal presented to the poorer ear. If the loss in the 
poorer ear is organic, the patient will continue 
to respond to the signal being presented to the 
good ear. This is a negative Stenger. If the loss is 
functional, the patient will stop responding when 
the loudness of the signal in the feigned ear ex-
ceeds that in the other ear, because the signal 
will only be heard in the feigned ear due to the 
Stenger principle. Because you are still presenting 
an audible signal to the good ear, you know that 
the patient is not cooperating. This is a positive 
Stenger, indicative of functional hearing loss.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  471
For those who continue to exaggerate their hearing levels, there 
are several behavioral strategies that can be used. Children are the 
easiest under these circumstances, and some of the approaches to 
children work remarkably well with some adults. One particularly 
useful strategy in children is the yes-no test. For this test, children 
are instructed to indicate that they hear a tone by saying “yes” 
and that they do not hear the tone by saying “no.” In most cases, 
you will be able to track the “no” responses all the way down to 
the real threshold level. Another useful technique is to have the 
child “count the beeps” while presenting groups of two or more 
tones at each intensity level. As threshold approaches, the child 
will begin counting incorrectly, but will continue to respond.
In adults, one of the more productive approaches is to use a variable 
ascending-descending strategy to try to bracket the threshold. Many 
audiologists will adhere strictly to an ascending approach so that the 
patient does not have too many opportunities to judge suprathresh-
old loudness levels. If a patient is feigning a unilateral hearing loss, 
the Stenger test can be used to predict threshold levels generally.
In patients who simply will not cooperate, accurate pure-tone 
threshold levels might not be attainable despite considerable toil 
on the part of the audiologist. Many audiologists feel that their 
time is not being well spent by trying to establish a behavioral 
audiogram in patients who will not cooperate. Those audiolo-
gists are likely to stop testing fairly early in the evaluation process 
and move immediately to assessment by auditory evoked poten-
tials. The strategy is a good one in terms of resource utilization 
because, most likely, the patient will be undergoing evoked poten-
tial testing anyway. The art of audiometric testing in this case is to 
know quickly when you have reached a point at which additional 
testing will not yield additional results.
If valid and reliable behavioral thresholds cannot be obtained, 
current standard of care is to use auditory evoked potentials to 
predict the audiogram. Three approaches are commonly used. 
One approach is to establish ABR thresholds to clicks as a means 
of predicting high-frequency hearing and 500-Hz tone bursts as 
a means of predicting low-frequency hearing. The advantages to 
this approach are that testing can be completed quickly and the 

472  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
patient can be sleeping during the procedure. The disadvantages 
are that the audiogram is predicted in broad frequency categories, 
and low-frequency tone-burst ABRs can be diffi cult to record.
Another approach is to establish late latency response (LLR) 
thresholds to pure tones across the audiometric frequency range. 
The advantage of this approach is that an electrophysiologic au-
diogram can be established with frequency-specifi c stimuli. The 
disadvantage is that the procedure is rather time consuming.
A third approach is to use the auditory steady-state response to 
estimate hearing sensitivity. The advantages of ASSR testing are: 
(1) better frequency specifi city than the ABR; and (2) patients do 
not need to remain awake as they do for LLR testing.
Regardless of the test strategy, auditory evoked potentials are now 
commonly used as the method of choice for verifying and docu-
menting hearing thresholds in cases of functional hearing loss.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 10-12. Illustrative Case 12 is a patient who com-
plains of a hearing loss in his right ear following an automobile 
accident. The patient is a 30-year-old man with an otherwise un-
remarkable health and hearing history. Two months prior to the 
evaluation, he was involved in an automobile accident. He reports 
that he sustained injuries to his neck and head and that a blow to 
the right side resulted in a signifi cant loss of hearing in that ear.
Immittance audiometry, as shown in Figure 10-16A is consistent 
with normal middle-ear function bilaterally, as characterized by 
a Type A tympanogram, normal static immittance, and normal 
crossed and uncrossed refl ex thresholds. SPAR results predict nor-
mal hearing sensitivity bilaterally.
Pure-tone audiometry shows normal hearing sensitivity in the left 
ear. Results from the right ear show responses that were generally 
inconsistent in the 80 to 100 dB range. Air-conduction thresholds 
are above or close to acoustic refl ex thresholds. Admitted thresh-
olds are shown in Figure 10-16B. Bone-conduction thresholds 
are also inconsistent and suggest the presence of an air-bone gap 
in the poorer ear and a bone-air gap in the normal ear.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  473
As is customary in cases of unilateral hearing loss, a Stenger test 
was carried out to verify the authenticity of behavioral thresholds.

Word-recognition testing resulted in unusual responses with rhym-
ing words at levels at or below admitted pure-tone thresholds.
Otoacoustic emissions are shown in Figure 10-16C. OAEs are 
present bilaterally, indicating at most a mild hearing loss.

return for the evaluation.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  475
Summary
Although the overall goal of an audiological evaluation is to 
• 
characterize hearing ability, the approach used to reach that 
goal can vary considerably across patients.
The approach chosen to evaluate a patient’s hearing is some-
• 
times related to patient factors such as age and sometimes re-
lated to the reason that the patient has sought services or been 
referred for services.
Audiologic assessment of otologic referrals is aimed at provid-
• 
ing additional information to the physician to aid in diagnosis 
or to provide a metric for the success or failure of medical or 
surgical treatment.
Audiologists are faced with two main categories of adult pa-
• 
tients, those who are younger and have signifi cant vocational 
communication demands and those who are older and have 
more complex auditory problems.
The audiologist is faced with three main challenges in the as-
• 
sessment of infants and children.
The fi rst challenge in pediatric assessment is to identify children 
• 
who are at risk for hearing loss and need further evaluation.
The second challenge in pediatric assessment is to determine 
• 
if the children identifi ed as being at risk for auditory disorder 
actually have a hearing loss and, if so, to determine the nature 
and degree of the loss.

The third challenge in pediatric assessment is to evaluate the 
• 
hearing ability of preschool and early school-age children sus-
pected of having auditory processing disorders.
Regardless of the reason for functional hearing loss, the role of 
• 
the audiologist is to detect that a functional component exists 
and to resolve the true hearing sensitivity.
Short Answer Questions
 1. In determining an approach to evaluation, two important 
questions to be answered are: “What are the 
 for 
the evaluation?” and “What 
 will I use to test?”
 2. Evaluative goals for an otologic referral include determina-
tion of the 
 of the disorder and the impact of 
the disorder on hearing 
.
 3. Immittance audiometry is the most sensitive audiologic 
indicator of 
 disorder.
 4. Information about middle-ear dysfunction that can be 
determined from 
 audiometry includes: 
 and 
 of the middle-ear system; 
the presence of a 
 in the tympanic membrane; 
and the presence of signifi cant 
 pressure in the 
middle-ear space.
 5. Information about middle-ear dysfunction that can be 
determined from 
-
 audiometry is 
the presence of an 
-
 gap.
 6. Speech-
 
are primarily used as a 
cross-check for pure-tone thresholds.
 7. The 
 
 from 
 
 (SPAR) test is useful for predicting the pres-
ence of cochlear hearing loss by comparing the average of 
pure-tone acoustic refl exes to acoustic refl exes elicited by 
-
 signals.
 8. The 
 of a hearing loss is determined by com-
parison of pure-tone thresholds between the two ears.
 9. The 
 of a hearing loss is determined by com-
parison of the audiometric results to the results of previous 
audiometric evaluations.

CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  477
 10. Word-
 scores that cannot be predicted from the 
pure-tone audiogram raise suspicion for 
 disor-
der. When word-recognition scores are worse at high inten-
sities than at lower intensities, 
 is said to occur.
 11. Quantifying the impact of hearing impairment on communi-
cation ability is known as hearing 
 assessment.
 12. The primary goal for hearing screening of infants is to 
 infants at risk for signifi cant sensorineural 
hearing loss and who require further 
 testing. 
Additionally, children should be identifi ed who are at risk for 
 onset or 
 hearing loss.
 13. Signifi cant risk factors for hearing loss in children include: 
a 
 history of hearing loss; diagnosis of a 
 that has hearing loss as a characteristic fea-
ture; or infection with 
 (CMV).
 14. The use of 
 auditory brainstem response testing 
is common for screening of infants for hearing loss because it 
does not require signifi cantly skilled personnel for operation.
 15. The use of 
 
 is susceptible to false 
positives in screening the hearing of infants due to middle-
ear issues.
 16. To obtain accurate tympanograms in newborns and young 
infants, it is necessary to use a 
 Hz probe tone, 
rather than the typically used 
 Hz probe tone.
 17. 
 
 audiometry was historically used 
for testing of hearing in infants. In this testing approach, in-
fants are observed for subtle behavioral responses that occur 
in response to suprathreshold sounds.
Discussion Questions
 1. How might the strategy used to evaluate a patient who is 
seeking otologic care differ from the strategy used to evalu-
ate a patient who is seeking audiologic care?
 2. How might the strategy used to evaluate an adult patient 
differ based on age?
 3. How might the strategy used to evaluate a pediatric patient 
differ based on age?

478  CHAPTER 10  DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT APPROACHES  FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
 4. In what ways does the role of immittance audiometry 
change with patient population being assessed?
 5. In what ways does the role of auditory evoked potentials in au-
diologic evaluation change with the population being assessed?
 6. How might an audiologist’s knowledge of medical etiologies 
of hearing loss contribute to the audiologic assessment?

482  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
COMMUNICATING results of the audiologic evaluation is an 
important aspect of service provision. It is important for patients 
and families to understand the outcomes and implications of au-
diometric tests and any next steps that must be taken. It is also 
important for results to be accurately reported in the patient’s 
medical record, to the referral source, and to others as the patient 
requests. Finally, it is important to make proper referrals when in-
dicated based on the outcome of the audiologic consultation. In 
all cases, it is important to maintain confi dentiality of patient in-
formation in accordance with ethical and legal standards.
This chapter will provide a brief overview of the importance of com-
municating results to patients, some thoughts about effective re-
porting of results, and some strategies for making proper referrals.
TALKING TO PATIENTS
Once the evaluation process is completed, results must be conveyed 
to patients and, often, their families and signifi cant others. There 
is no set formula for this process, and common sense in communi-
cating results will serve you well as a clinician. Nevertheless, the 
beginning student will fi nd it valuable to think through the goals 
of effective communication and to understand some of the barri-
ers to achieving this effectiveness (for a complete review of coun-
seling in audiology, see Sweetow, 1999; Clark & English, 2004).
Goal of the Encounter
What should your goals be during informational counseling 
 following completion of the evaluation process? The fi rst step, of 
Describe the principles of communicating 
• 
audiologic results to patients.
Explain the difference between document-
• 
ing test results and reporting test results.
Describe how report writing goals will vary 
• 
depending on the source of the referral.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
List and explain the components of a typical 
• 
audiologic report.
Explain the concept of lines of referral and 
• 
the ethics relating to it.

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  483
course, is simply to help patients understand what it is you learned 
from all of the testing.
While it may not seem diffi cult to convey what you learned, you 
might have just fi nished gathering tympanograms, acoustic refl ex 
thresholds, static immittance, OAEs, air- and bone-conduction 
thresholds, speech thresholds, suprathreshold speech measures, 
an audiometric Weber, and who knows, maybe even a Stenger 
test. The bewildered patient is wondering about all of this, and 
your job is to make it simple and obvious.
As a new clinician, you will have a tendency to want to start at 
the beginning and explain the outcome of all of your testing. But 
the seasoned audiologist will start at the end of the story, provid-
ing the patient with a straightforward and simple statement of 
the overall outcome of the testing and then fi ll in the details about 
testing as needed, and only if needed.
There are at least three important goals that you should try to 
achieve during your informational counseling of patients:
 1. help them to understand the nature and degree of their 
hearing impairment and its likely effect on communication 
ability;
 2. give them words to use to describe their hearing loss, so that 
they can talk about and learn about the problem; and
 3. provide them with a clear understanding of the next steps 
that need to be taken.
Information to Convey
One of the challenges of communicating with patients is to con-
vey enough information for them to understand the nature of the 
problem without overburdening them with detail. Another chal-
lenge is to do so in a manner that is clear and that does not pre-
sume too much knowledge on the part of the patient.
Most audiologists begin discussing results by describing the type 
and degree of hearing loss. It is a rare audiology offi ce that will 
not have a simple diagram of the ear readily available to assist in 
explaining how the ear works and how a disorder occurs. It is im-
portant to remember that most patients will have been exposed 

484  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
to some rudimentary explanation of how the ear works at some 
point in school and that most will have long ago forgotten what 
they learned. Simplifying the explanation and using common 
terms for the anatomy and physiology will contribute to a better 
understanding on the part of the patient.
Audiologists differ on how to describe hearing sensitivity, but 
most of  them use the audiogram as a tool for the explanation. 
An effective explanation of  the audiogram follows much the 
same rules as an effective explanation of the anatomy of the ear. 
The simpler the language that is used, the more likely is the 
information to be conveyed. Words like intensity, frequency, and 
threshold are not always readily understood by patients, whereas 
loudness, pitch, and faint sound, while not precisely accurate, make 
a lot more sense to most people. The new student will benefit 
from trying to explain an audiogram to roommates, parents, 
and friends before he attempts his explanation on patients. 
There are tools available that can assist in the explanation of 
an audiogram, such as the speech-sound audiograms shown in 
Chapter 3 or the count-the-dots audiograms shown in Chapter 7. 
The aim of  these approaches is to help the patient understand 
the impact of  the sensitivity loss on the hearing of  speech to 
provide a more thorough understanding of its impact on overall 
communication ability. There are also some generic delineations 
of communication ability based on general degrees of hearing 
loss, as shown in Table 11-1. To most patients, these explanations 
will simply verify what they already know, but there is great value 
in helping them to understand why they are having the problems 
they are having.
Explanations of the outcomes of other test measures can often be 
helpful in making the results clear to patients. For example, results 
of immittance measures, with a very simple explanation, may be 
helpful in conveying to patients that outer and middle ears are 
working just fi ne, but the inner ear is not. Or it might be helpful 
to convey to the parents of an infant that the fl at tympanogram 
helps explain the mild sensitivity loss found on ABR testing. Simi-
larly, it may be valuable to explain to patients that although they 
can no longer hear soft sound, once sound is made loud enough, 
their ability to recognize speech is excellent, or poor, or whatever 
it may be.

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  485
It is usually not necessary to explain in detail the results of all test 
outcomes. Indeed, it is often counterproductive to burden the pa-
tient with excessive information. Rather, you should strive to em-
phasize the important summary information for them so that they 
leave with a clear understanding of the two or three most impor-
tant points you want them to remember. That said, you may fi nd 
that certain test outcomes help to explain their symptoms, and you 
may want to take time to provide validation of those symptoms.
Most audiologists fi nd it useful to give the patients the right words 
to use to describe their hearing loss. Again, that may sound obvi-
ous, but it can help in a number of ways. If your report says that 
the patient has a mild sensorineural hearing loss, there is a good 
chance that the primary-care physician reading your report will 
use those same words. If you have conveyed those same words to 
the patient, there will not be confusion. This may help to avoid use 
of some of the more oblique terms like nerve deafness or other col-
loquialisms that add confusion. Giving the correct terminology 
also allows the patient the opportunity to access accurate infor-
mation online more readily than the use of slang might.

486  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
One of the most important outcomes of this information coun-
seling is setting the stage for treatment. For those patient with 
middle-ear disorder and conductive loss, facilitating the proper 
referral and conveying the importance of  follow-up is crucial. 
For those patients with sensorineural hearing loss, it is at this 
point that you help the patient to understand how they might 
benefi t from hearing aid amplifi cation and other solutions. For 
the adult patient, a clear explanation of  their candidacy for 
hearing aids or a cochlear implant and an enthusiastic but re-
alistic prognostic statement about the potential benefits to be 
gained can be a very valuable fi rst step in the process. For infants 
and children, it is at this point that you begin working with the 
parents to garner the resources to move forward with treatment 
and educational options. Regardless, it is crucial to convey in a 
clear and defi nitive manner what the next steps will be.
Matching Patient and Provider Perspectives
The patient perspective is unique. Patients may be quite familiar 
with audiometric test results, somewhat familiar, or completely 
unfamiliar. They may know what caused their hearing loss, may 
have some idea, or may be completely worried about the cause. 
They may wear hearing aids, want hearing aids, or hope to avoid 
hearing aids. Parents may have other children with hearing loss, 
neighbors who have children with hearing loss, or may never 
have thought about childhood hearing loss or its consequences. 
And so it is diffi cult to know what your individual patient’s per-
spective might be. Nevertheless, there are some generalities that 
might help guide you.
The seasoned patient will require little explanation. Adult patients 
will want to know if the hearing has changed in any way or, if 
they already know that it has, will want to know to what extent 
it has changed. They will also be curious about technological en-
hancements in hearing aids and when to pursue a change.
First-time adult patients will want to understand the cause of the 
hearing loss, if it is not already known, and will want to ensure that 
it is not signaling a more signifi cant health problem. They will want 
to understand how bad their loss is compared to others and to learn 
if their spouses were, in fact, right about how much hearing loss 

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  487
they have. They will want to know if their loss is medically treatable 
and will come with a wide variety of levels of acceptance about the 
idea of hearing aid use. These patients will understand their prob-
lems and will want to understand why they are having them. They 
will not have a clue about the audiogram and will require time to 
understand the underlying nature of the disorder.
Parents of infants and young children identifi ed with hearing loss 
will want to know, fi rst and foremost it seems, what caused the loss. 
Although it may never be clear or it may take a multidisciplinary 
team approach with the neonatologist, otolaryngologist, and/or 
geneticist to determine the answer, the parents will ask you. So you 
need to be prepared to defer the question or discuss possibilities. 
Parents will be in varying stages of grief and possible denial about 
hearing loss, and you need to be prepared to understand this (for 
an overview, see Tanner, 1980; Clark & English, 2004). When 
they are prepared to deal with the issue, and for some parents 
it may be immediate, you need to be prepared to talk with them 
about eligibility for local and state services, educational services, 
and hearing aid or cochlear implant intervention. This is probably 
one of  the times that you will be most challenged in terms of 
fi nding a balance between providing adequate information and 
too much information. The parents may not hear much after you 
tell them that their baby has a hearing loss, and so providing them 
with written information, web site URLs, and other resources that 
they can access once the reality of hearing loss sinks in will be a 
very valuable approach.
In contrast to the patient’s unique perspective, your perspective 
on the patient’s hearing loss will not be unique. He or she may 
be the twentieth patient you have seen this week with bilaterally 
symmetric, mildly sloping sensorineural hearing loss. The ABR 
you have just done on the infant may be the tenth this week that 
demonstrated what will undoubtedly be transient conductive dis-
order. You may be hearing for the thirtieth time this month that 
someone’s spouse is making him or her get this hearing test and 
that if the spouse would only just quit mumbling. . .
One of the most challenging aspects of informational counseling 
of patients is remembering that this is each patient’s only hearing 
loss. One of your challenges will be to avoid treating patients as 

488  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
audiograms rather than for the unique communication disorders 
they present.
Another of  your challenges will be to say enough but not too 
much. You will have to fi nd the right blend of talking and listen-
ing for each patient. Newer providers have a tendency to fi ll silent 
gaps by talking a bit too much. Over time, it seems, it becomes eas-
ier to say less and still convey ample information adequately.
When you have fi nished providing information about the results 
of your evaluation, it is important that you clearly delineate next 
steps for patients. The next step may be as simple as sending the 
patient down the hall to the otolaryngologist. Or it may require 
coordinating services with the local school system, the state’s 
early childhood program, your cochlear implant program, and so 
on. Stating the disposition clearly, scheduling the appointment, 
and discussing the next steps with patients is an important fi nal 
step in the counseling process.
WRITING REPORTS
One important aspect in the provision of health care is the re-
porting of results of an evaluation or treatment outcome. The 
challenge of reporting is to describe what was found or what was 
done in a clear, concise, and consistent manner. The actual nature 
of a report can vary greatly depending on the setting and the re-
ferral source to whom a report is most often written.
In larger institutions, the report is placed in the electronic medi-
cal records for your later use or for review by the referral source, 
primary-care physician, or other health-care provider.
Documenting and Reporting
It is important to distinguish between documentation of test results 
and reporting of  test results. Documentation is a fundamental 
necessity of  patient care. It is important for continuity of  pa-
tient care, for billing purposes, and for legal reasons. Documen-
tation is simply the preservation of examination and test results 
in a patient fi le and must be maintained in all cases following the 

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  489
 provision of services. Reporting results is the summarizing of that 
documentation. As an example, when you carry out immittance 
testing, you will obtain a large amount of detailed information 
about the tympanogram, static immittance, refl ex thresholds, etc. 
This is important information to keep as part of the patient record. 
However, what you write in your report might be “normal middle-
ear function,” an important and clear summary statement about 
these test results. Once you have summarized your evaluation in 
this way, the resultant report actually becomes a part of the docu-
mentation of the patient visit.
Audiology reports are generally of two types. The type of report is 
usually dictated by the setting, and in some cases both types are 
used within a setting based on the nature of the referral source or 
documentation requirements. One type of report is the audiogram 
report. The audiogram report usually consists of an audiogram, a 
table of other audiometric information, and space at the bottom 
for summary and impressions. The audiogram report is often used 
for reporting in hospital settings, where the results are added to 
the patient’s electronic chart and may constitute both the docu-
mentation and the report for the medical record. The audiogram 
report is also often used in otolaryngology offi ces, where the au-
diometric evaluation is one component of the medical evaluation 
and is used to supplement the medical report generated by the 
physician. The great challenge in creating an appropriate audio-
gram report is to be thorough, since this may constitute the en-
tirety of the audiologic record in a patient chart, while at the same 
time being clear and concise. Certain necessary information must 
be included, but it needs to be presented in a way that promotes 
communication between the audiologist and the con sumers of 
the report.
The other common type of audiologic report is the letter report. 
This report is often dictated or computer generated. It is meant to 
either stand on its own or to accompany an audiogram and other 
test-result documentation. The report in this case serves as the 
sum mary of results and a statement of disposition of the patient. 
When written appropriately, it can be sent to a patient, a referral 
source, a school, or other interested parties without supporting 
documentation. It can also be used as a cover letter for supporting 

490  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
documentation when the report is sent to referral sources or oth-
ers who might understand what an audiogram, an immittance 
form, or a latency-intensity function represents. The great chal-
lenge in creating an appropriate letter report is to say enough, but 
not too much. The letter should state clearly the outcome of test 
results and the recommendations or other disposition related to 
the patient. In most cases, it should not serve as a lengthy descrip-
tion of the patient or the test procedures used to reach the out-
come conclusions.
Reporting of test results can be a relatively simple and efficient 
process. The most important aspects of report writing are probably 
consistency and clarity. The purpose is to communicate in a manner 
that describes the results and disposition effectively. A list of dos 
and don’ts for report writing can be found in the accompanying 
Clinical Note. These should serve as general guidelines for the 
generation of the majority of reports that you write. Remember 
that the reader is busy and wants your professional interpretation 
and impression. Three of the more important do’s are: (1) be clear, 
(2) be concise, and (3) be consistent.
Report Destination
The primary reason for report writing is to communicate results 
to the medical record or to the referral source. If the patient is 
self-referred, that is, she has come to you directly without refer-
ral, then your report may simply be the patient records that your 
offi ce retains. If the patient is referred to you, then the primary 
destination of the report is back to the referral source. In this case, 
as a rule, your only obligation as a professional is to report back to 
the referral source, because that person has requested a consulta-
tion from you.
The patient may also request a copy of the report or that a copy 
be sent to additional health-care providers, schools, and so on. It 
is customary and appropriate to address a letter report to the re-
ferral source, with additional copies sent to the other requested 
parties. On occasion, there are circumstances under which an ad-
ditional report is written to an individual or institution as a ser-
vice to the patient. It is appropriate to write such a report, as long 
as in doing so the lines of referral are not breached. The concept 
of referral lines is introduced later in this chapter.

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  491
Nature of the Referral
Reporting of audiometric test results should be done in a clear 
enough manner that the report can be generally understood, re-
gardless of the nature of the referral source. That is, the type and 
severity of the hearing loss are described the same whether the

Clinical Note

492  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
report is being sent to a patient, a parent, or an otolaryngologist. 
However, conclusions and recommendations may vary consider-
ably depending on the referral source.
Reports to the health-care community must be short and to the 
point. But even within that community there is often a need for 
different levels of explanation, particularly of the disposition of 
the patient. For example, the otolaryngologist will understand 
the steps that must be taken if the audiologist indicates that the 
patient is a candidate for hearing aid use. The oncologist may not. 
Reports to school personnel may include an explanation of the 
consequences of a hearing impairment. This same explanation 
might be unnecessary for, or certainly underutilized by, the 
medical community.
One of the important challenges in reporting, then, is to develop 
a strategy that combines consistency in the basic reporting of re-
sults with the fl exibility to adapt the implications and conclusions 
to meet the expectations of the reader.
Information to Convey
The goal of any report is to communicate the outcome of your 
evaluation and/or treatment. Reporting is just that simple. If you 
always strive to describe your results succinctly and to provide the 
referral source, patient, or parent with essential information and 
a clear understanding of what to do next, you will have succeeded 
in writing an effective report.
One of the biggest challenges in report writing is to provide all 
relevant information while only reporting relevant information. 
Although thoroughness is an important attribute of documenta-
tion, succinctness is an important attribute of reporting.
One of the most useful ways to judge the appropriateness of the 
information that you are communicating in a report is to put 
yourself in the reader’s shoes. As a reader, you probably lack one 
of two things, time or technical expertise. In either case, your in-
terest in lengthy, detailed reports will be limited. Perhaps some ex-
amples will make this clear.
An otolaryngologist is 
a physician specializing in 
the diagnosis and treatment 
of diseases of the ear, nose, 
and throat.
An oncologist is a physician 
specializing in the diagnosis 
and treatment of cancer.

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  493
Suppose for a moment that you are a physician. You refer a  patient 
to the audiologist to determine the extent to which the fl uid that 
you have observed behind the tympanic membrane is causing 
an auditory disorder. What might you want to know? You would 
probably want to know whether or not middle-ear disorder is de-
tected by immittance measures and, if so, what the nature of the 
results is. You would also probably want to know the degree of 
hearing loss the disorder is creating and the nature of the hear-
ing loss, for example, whether it is a conductive or mixed hearing 
loss. Finally, you would want to know if speech perception mea-
sures or any other auditory measures suggest any evidence of ad-
ditional cochlear or retrocochlear disorder. This is all information 
that would help you as a physician make appropriate decisions 
about diagnosis and treatment, and it should be summarized in a 
report. Okay, so what don’t you care about? First, you don’t care 
to hear about the patient’s medical history. Why? Because you 
already know all about it. Second, you probably do not want to 
hear about the nuances of the audiologic tests that were carried 
out. Although important to the audiologist and imperative for the 
audiologic records, their descriptions serve simply as extraneous 
information that obscures the results and conclusions of the au-
diologist’s evaluation or treatment. Third, you are probably not 
interested at this point in getting recommendations about non-
medical or nonsurgical intervention strategies.
Let us use another example. Suppose this time that you are the pa-
tient. You have decided to see the audiologist because your hear-
ing impairment has reached a point at which you feel that hearing 
aid use might be appropriate. You would like a report for your re-
cords, and you would like to have a copy sent to your primary-
care physician for hers. What do you care about? You are probably 
interested in a report describing the degree and type of hearing 
loss you have in both ears. You are also probably interested in 
written recommendations about the prognosis for pursuing hear-
ing aid use. What don’t you care about? Well, you don’t care to 
read about your own medical history. You already know that. You 
also don’t care about the specifi cs of the auditory tests. You simply 
want words to describe your problem and a cogent statement of 
the plans to fi x it.

494  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
What, then, should be communicated in a report? What are the 
best strategies for doing so? As a general rule, the report should 
be a summary of evaluative outcomes. What is the hearing like in 
the right ear? The left ear? Where do we go from here? As an other 
general rule, the report should not be a description of the testing 
that was done nor a description of the specifi c test results, except 
as they support the evaluative outcome. These are two important 
points. First, there is very seldom any reason to describe audio-
metric tests in a report. If the report is going to a referral source, 
it is safe to assume that the person receiving the report is familiar 
with the testing or does not care about the details. In most cases, 
an audiometric summary is sent with a report and provides all 
the details that anyone might want to see. Second, most audio-
metric test results are supportive of the general outcome and do 
not need to be described. For example, if a patient has a mild sen-
sorineural hearing loss and normal middle-ear function, there 
is no reason to describe pure-tone air conduction results, bone-
conduction results, the tympanogram, acoustic refl exes, speech 
audiometry, and so on. Simply stating the outcome is suffi cient in 
a vast majority of cases.
For audiologic evaluations, a report usually consists of  a brief 
summary of  testing outcomes, an audiogram form with more 
specifi c information, and additional supplemental information 
as necessary.
The Report
An audiologic report typically includes a description of the audi-
ometric confi guration, type of hearing loss, status of middle ear 
function, and recommendations. Under certain circumstances, it 
might also include case history information, speech audiometric 
results, auditory electrophysiologic results, and a statement about 
site of the auditory disorder.
Case History. Sometimes a description of relevant information 
from the case history is useful in the initial portion of a report. 
Again, it is clearly an important part of  the documentation in 
a patient record. But in most cases in a report, it should be very 
brief and serve more as an orientation as to why the consulta-
tion took place. Reports written to referral sources seldom need 

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  495
a summary of why a patient was evaluated because the referral 
source would obviously know, being the source of the referral. 
Similarly, a report written to a patient seldom requires this in-
formation, because, clearly, the patient already knows all of this 
information.
There are times when a succinct statement can be made about 
some aspect of a patient’s medical or communication history that 
might be new or relevant information to the person receiving the 
report. For example, for a patient who has suspected hearing loss 
secondary to noise exposure, a report might include a summary 
of relevant noise-exposure information.
The key to judging the need for extensive case history information 
lies in the nature of the referral source and the people or insti-
tutions to whom the report is being sent. In the vast majority of 
cases, reports are being sent either to the referral source, the pa-
tient, or the patient’s parents. In most of these cases, a summary 
of relevant history is all that is necessary.
Type of Hearing Loss. If a hearing loss exists, it should be described 
as conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. If it is conductive at some 
frequencies and sensorineural at others, it should be considered a 
mixed hearing loss.
Degree and Configuration of Hearing Loss. Most audiologists 
describe degree of hearing loss as falling into one of several cate-
gories, minimal, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe, or pro-
found. If the audiometric pattern or confi guration is that of a fl at 
loss, the loss is often described simply as, for example, a moderate 
hearing loss. If the loss is not relatively fl at, it is usually described 
by its confi guration as either rising, sloping, high-frequency, or 
low-frequency, depending on its shape.
Describing the degree and confi guration of hearing loss is not an 
exact science, and it should not be treated as such. Rather, the goal 
should be to put the audiogram into words that can be conveyed 
with relative consistency to the patient and among health-care 
professionals. To describe a hearing loss as a mild sensorineural 
loss at 500 Hz, moderately sloping mixed hearing loss in the mid-
frequencies, and moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss in 

496  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
the high frequencies, although perhaps accurate, is not very use-
ful. Providing the words moderate, mixed hearing loss is probably 
much more useful to all who might read the report.
Sample terminology that can be used to consistently describe type, 
degree, and confi guration of hearing loss is shown in Table 11-2.
Change in Hearing Status. When a patient has been evaluated 
a second or third time, it is important to include a statement of 
comparison to previous test results. This should be done even if 
the results have not changed. A simple statement such as, hearing

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  497
sensitivity is unchanged/has decreased/has improved since the previous 
evaluation on (date), will suffi ce and will be an important contribu-
tion to the report.
Middle-Ear Function. It is often important to state the status of 
middle-ear function based on results of immittance audiometry, 
even if that status is normal. Much of the direction and course of 
treatment relates to whether or not the function is normal. When 
middle-ear function is normal, it should be stated directly without 
a delineation of immittance results.
When middle-ear function is abnormal, the nature of  the im-
mittance results should be described. It is useful to limit the de-
scription of the disorder to a few categories that can be conveyed 
consistently to the referral source. Once the disorder is described, 
the specific immittance results that characterize the disorder 
can be delineated. In general, middle-ear disorders fall into one 
of fi ve categories:
 1. an increase in the mass of the middle-ear system, charac-
terized by a Type B tympanogram, low static immittance, 
and absent acoustic refl exes, often caused by otitis media 
with effusion and impacted cerumen; 
 2. an increase in the stiffness of the middle-ear system due to 
fi xation of the ossicular chain, characterized by a Type A 
tympanogram, low static immittance, and absent acoustic 
refl exes, often caused by otosclerosis;
 3. a decrease in the stiffness of the middle-ear system due to 
disruption of the ossicular chain, characterized by a Type A 
tympanogram, high static immittance, and absent acoustic 
refl exes, often caused by some form of trauma;
 4. signifi cant negative pressure in the middle-ear space, char-
acterized by a Type C tympanogram, caused by Eustachian 
tube dysfunction; or
 5. perforation of the tympanic membrane, characterized by a 
large equivalent volume and absent refl exes, often caused 
by tympanic membrane rupture secondary to oti tis media 
or to trauma.
In reporting these results, only the type of middle-ear disorder 
and the immittance results should be described. The underlying 

498  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
cause of the disorder is a medical diagnosis and is the purview of 
the physician. The audiologist’s task is to identify and describe the 
disorder, not its cause.
Sample terminoloy that can be used to consistently describe 
immittance-measurement outcomes is shown in Table 11-3.
Sometimes middle ear function will be normal, but acoustic refl ex 
measures will be elevated, consistent with sensorineural hearing 
loss or retrocochlear disorder. When the refl ex results might be 
useful to the referral source in helping to diagnose such a disor-
der, then they should be described. Otherwise, they simply con-
fi rm the description of the type of hearing loss and are probably 
redundant.
Speech Audiometric Results. Results of speech audiometry are 
seldom useful to describe in a report. As a general rule, conven-
tional speech audiometric measures are consistent with results of 
pure-tone audiometry. That is, the speech-recognition threshold is 
refl ective of the pure-tone average, and speech-recognition scores

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  499
are consistent with the degree and confi guration of hearing loss. 
As long as they are included on the audiogram form, there is no 
real need to describe them in a report because the information 
they provide is redundant and, thus, contributes little to the over-
all summary of results that you are trying to convey.
Sometimes speech audiometric results are poorer than would be 
expected from the results of pure-tone audiometry. In such cases, 
the results may be important to the diagnosis and should be in-
cluded in a report. Here again, rather than providing a specific 
score on a test, the results should be summarized in a meaning-
ful way. Statements such as word recognition scores were poorer than 
expected for the degree of hearing loss or speech audiometric measures 
showed abnormal rollover of the performance-intensity function serve 
to alert the informed reader to potential retrocochlear involve-
ment without burdening the report with details.
When advanced speech audiometric measures are used to as-
sess auditory processing ability, the same general rules apply. If 
results are normal, there is no need to describe them in a report. 
If results are abnormal, they should be described generally with-
out details of the test procedures or too much specifi c informa-
tion about test scores. Often, the report will be accompanied by 
an audiometric form that contains enough detail for readers with 
specific knowledge. Those without specific knowledge will not 
benefi t from this information regardless of its availability, so it is 
even more important to summarize the information in a succinct 
and meaningful way in the body of the report.
Electrophysiologic Results. A variety of strategies are used to de-
scribe the results of auditory electrophysiologic measures. As a 
general rule, the more complicated the technology, the more com-
pelled the writer seems to be to burden the reader with details of 
the testing itself. Again, however, you have the opportunity to treat 
this testing as any other audiometric measure by simply describ-
ing the outcome in your report. The details of how you reached 
that decision are better left as supplementary documentation for 
those who might understand it.
When auditory evoked potentials are used to predict hearing sen-
sitivity, the results can be summarized in a standard audiologic 

500  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
report. If results are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity, 
then a statement such as auditory brainstem response predicted 
hearing sensitivity to be within normal limits will suffi ce. If results 
are consistent with a hearing loss, then the report should state 
that these measures predict a mild, moderate, or severe, sen-
sorineural or conductive hearing loss. A latency-intensity func-
tion might be sent along with the report to provide more detail 
for the curious reader.
When auditory evoked potentials are used diagnostically, the 
same rules apply. A general statement should be made about the 
overall outcome of the testing. When results are normal, a state-
ment should be made that absolute and interpeak intervals are within 
normal limits and that these results show no evidence of VIIIth nerve 
or auditory brainstem response abnormality. When results are ab-
normal, they should also be described generally as, for example, 
the absence of a measurable response, a prolongation of wave I–V 
interpeak interval, a signifi cant asymmetry in absolute latency of 
wave V, and so on. The results should then be summarized by stat-
ing that they are consistent with VIIIth nerve or auditory brain-
stem response abnormality.
Sample terminology that can be used to consistently describe elec-
trophysiologic test results is shown in Table 11-4.
To some readers, the details of these evoked potential measures 
are important. They are interested in electrode montage, click 
rate, stimulus polarity, EEG fi ltering, etc. For these individuals, a 
summary containing this information as well as the waveforms 
may be useful. Most readers, however, are only interested in the 
outcome and your professional opinion about it. In a report, there 
is no need to burden this latter group because of the interests of 
the former. The report should summarize and make conclusions. 
Supplemental information can always be attached.
For an electronic patient record system, where the report and doc-
umentation may be combined, it is not a bad idea to sequence the 
report in such a way that the conclusions come fi rst and the docu-
mentation last. This way, anyone reading the report will be able to 
get to the conclusion without having to wade through the details.

Outcome
Results
Normal ABR
Auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing shows 
well-formed responses to click stimuli at normal ab-
solute latencies and interwave intervals. There is no 
electrophysiologic evidence of VIII nerve or auditory 
brainstem pathway disorder.
Abnormal ABR
Auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing shows 
abnormal responses to click stimuli. Both the absolute 
latency of wave V and the I to V interwave interval are 
signifi cantly prolonged.
Normal hearing
Auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing shows 
well-formed responses to click stimuli at intensity lev-
els consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in the 
1000 Hz to 4000 Hz frequency range.
Sensitivity Loss
Auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing shows 
well-formed responses to click stimuli down to ___ dB 
nHL. This is consistent with a ___ hearing loss in the 
1000 Hz to 4000 Hz frequency range.
Conductive loss
Auditory brainstem response (ABR) testing shows 
well-formed responses to click stimuli down to ___ dB 
nHL by air conduction and down to ___ dB nHL by 
bone conduction. This is consistent with a ___ hear-
ing loss in the 1000 Hz to 4000 Hz frequency range.
Normal OAEs
Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions are present 
and robust, suggesting normal cochlear function.
Absent OAEs
Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions are absent.
TABLE 11-4 Sample report writing terminology used to describe 
 results of ABR and OAE measurements
Site of Disorder. In general, there is no need to make a statement 
about site of disorder in a report. A conductive hearing loss is re-
lated to outer- or middle-ear disorder, and a sensorineural hearing 
loss is related to cochlear disorder. Occasionally, however, the audi-
ologist will fi nd it useful to give an overall impression of the possible 
site of disorder.
This is particularly useful if the patient has been referred for differ-
entiation of a cochlear versus retrocochlear disorder or if a parent 
or referral source is interested in knowing the status of auditory 
processing ability.

502  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
Any statement of site of disorder should be based on an overall 
impression of results of the test battery. If an VIIIth nerve tumor 
is suspected as the cause of an auditory disorder and the referral 
source is interested in the audiologist’s opinion, the report should 
state that the pattern of test results is consistent with cochlear 
disorder or consistent with retrocochlear disorder, depending on 
test outcomes. It should be emphasized that the site would be as-
sumed to be cochlear and that a statement about cochlear site 
would be unnecessary unless there is some concern about retro-
cochlear disorder. In some cases, there is no a priori concern about 
retrocochlear disorder, but various audiometric measures suggest 
otherwise. In such cases, it is valuable for the audiologist to make 
a statement about the pattern of test results.
The same general ideas hold for assessment of auditory process-
ing ability. If no concern is expressed, and routine testing is nor-
mal, no statement about site of disorder is necessary. However, if a 
diagnosis can be made based on routine testing, the report should 
state that the overall pattern of results is consistent with auditory 
processing disorder. Additionally, if a patient is referred for evalu-
ation of central auditory function, the reports should state that 
the pattern of test results is consistent with auditory processing 
disorder or that there is no evidence of such disorder, depending 
on test outcomes.
Recommendations. The recommendations section of a report is 
generally the fi rst section that is read by the reader. As in all other 
aspects of the report, recommendations should be clear, concise, 
and consistently stated. Recommendations generally fall into one 
of four categories:
 1. no recommendations,
 2. recommendations for re-evaluation,
 3. recommendations for additional testing, or
 4. recommendations for referral.
Sometimes there is no consequence to the audiometric test results, 
and no recommendations are necessary. For example, a patient 
with symptoms of  dizziness may be referred to the audiologist 
to rule out cochlear contribution to the dizziness. All pure-tone, 
immittance, and speech audiometric measures may be normal if 

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  503
the cochlea is not involved. As another example, a child may fail 
a school hearing screening because the testing was carried out in 
too noisy an environment. Results of the audiometric evaluation 
may be normal. What do you conclude? What do you recommend? 
Nothing. You can simply state that no audiologic recommendations 
are indicated at this time.
Occasionally there is a need to recommend audiologic re-
evaluation. For example, if a child is undergoing medical treat-
ment for otitis media, and you discover a conductive hearing loss, 
you may want to recommend that the child return for audiologic 
re-evaluation following the completion of medical management 
as a means of ensuring that there is no residual hearing loss that 
needs to be managed. As another example, an infant may have risk 
factors for progressive or delayed-onset hearing loss that requires 
periodic re-evaluation. Also, if a patient is exposed to damaging 
noise levels at work or recreationally, periodic assessment is 
indicated. In these cases, the recommendation of re-evaluation is 
appropriate and important.
Care should be taken to not overuse this recommendation. For ex-
ample, in a pediatric practice, a recommendation for re-evaluation 
at some later date should not serve as a substitute for completion 
of testing in the immediate future. 
Another common recommendation is for additional testing. For 
example, if behavioral testing could not be completed on a child 
or a patient with functional hearing loss due to a lack of coop-
eration, the audiologist may recommend additional testing with 
auditory evoked potentials.
Recommendations are also quite commonly made for referral 
purposes. The patient may be referred for a hearing aid consul-
tation, cochlear implant evaluation, speech-language evaluation, 
medical consultation, otologic consultation, and so on. Although 
the audiologist must always be cognizant of the rules of referral 
as discussed later in the chapter, the responsibility for making ap-
propriate referral recommendations is an important one.
Terminology that can be used to provide consistent recommenda-
tions is shown in Table 11-5.

504  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
The Audiogram and Other Forms
Under most circumstances it is customary to send an audiogram 
with a report. Because the audiogram has been a standard way to 
express hearing sensitivity for many years, it is widely recognized 
and generally understood by referral sources. As stated earlier, 
two strategies predominate, one the use of an audiogram form for 
both reporting and documenting and the other the use of a letter 
report with an audiogram and other forms attached.
The audiogram report is typically an audiogram, a table of infor-
mation, and a summary at the bottom. It often serves as both

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  505
a report and documentation in the patient record in a hospital 
or audiologist’s or physician’s offi ce. As such, it is often packed 
with information about the pure-tone audiogram as well as 
speech and immittance audiometry. Because it is so comprehen-
sive, it is often difficult to read and interpret and can defy the 
important requirement of clarity in reporting. The requirement 
for thoroughness inherent in the patient record makes it even 
more important that the summary and conclusions are concise 
and to the point.
An audiogram may also accompany a letter report. In this case, the 
report is usually going out of the offi ce or clinic, and a patient re-
cord is maintained electronically or in fi le form in the audiologist’s 
offi ce. The audiogram form can be designed to be less thorough, 
but clearer, to the reader. Detailed supporting documentation can 
be stored in the patient’s fi le. An example of an audiogram that 
might accompany a letter report is shown in Figure 11-1. 
It is not uncommon for an audiogram to include information 
about speech audiometry, either in tabular form, including 
speech-recognition threshold, word-recognition scores, and levels 
of testing, or in graphic form as a performance-versus-intensity 
function. The latter probably communicates better, although the 
former requires less space. Regardless, information about speech 
thresholds and word-recognition scores are often generally un-
derstood and should be included with the audiogram form.
Most audiologists also send information on results of immittance 
audiometry. Again, the form can vary from a tabular summary 
on an audiogram to a separate sheet of paper showing the tym-
panogram and acoustic reflex patterns, along with a space for 
sum mary information. An example is shown in Figure 11-2. As 
in all cases, this information will be understood by some who 
might receive a report and be quite foreign to others. Therefore, 
care should be taken to provide a clear and concise interpretation 
on the letter report.
If auditory evoked potentials have been carried out, it is not un-
common for the results to be summarized on an auditory brain-
stem response latency-intensity summary form. This form shows

Supplemental Material
Clinical reports are simply not the place to include lengthy descrip-
tions of testing procedures, outcomes, or rehabilitative strategies. 
Quite frankly, few people read lengthy reports; most just skip to 
the summary and recommendations. Nevertheless, there are im-
portant times to provide descriptive information, and it should be 
included as supplemental material to the main report and sent 
only to individuals who might read it.
Information that has proven to be useful as supplemental material 
includes, for example, pamphlets explaining:
the nature and consequence of hearing loss;
• 
the measurement and consequences of auditory processing 
• 
disorder;
home and classroom strategies for optimizing listening;
• 
the nature of tinnitus and its control; and
• 
the importance of hearing aids and how they can be obtained.
• 
Information such as this is less likely to be read if it is included in 
a report than if it is presented as supplemental material. It also 
helps to make reports clearer and more concise.
Sample Reporting Strategy
Experienced audiologists know that there is a finite number of 
ways they can describe the outcomes of their various audiometric 
measures. That is, there are only so many ways to describe an au-
diogram or the results of immittance audiometry. With a little dis-
cipline, over 90% of reports written can be generated from “stock” 
descriptions of testing outcomes.
An example of this strategy is shown in Figure 11-4. Results of the 
audiologic evaluation are shown in A and B. These results show 
a moderate, bilateral, symmetric, sensorineural hearing loss, with 
maximum word-recognition scores predictable from the degree of 
hearing loss and no evidence of abnormality. Results of immittance 
audiometry show normal Type A tympanograms and crossed and 
uncrossed acoustic refl exes within normal limits, suggesting nor-
mal middle-ear function. From these audiometric data, descriptors 
can be chosen that refl ect these results in a clear and concise way.

It is important to remember that not all reports can be written 
using this approach. For example, results on a patient who is ex-
aggerating a hearing loss need to be carefully crafted and do not 
lend themselves well to this type of standard reporting. Neither 
do some reports of pediatric testing. Nevertheless, the majority of 
outcomes and reports can be managed in this way.

Dear Dr. Referral
We evaluated your patient, B.S., on January 1. 
Audiometric results are as follows:
Right Ear
• Moderate sensorineural hearing loss.
• Acoustic immittance measures are consistent with 
normal middle-ear function.
Left Ear
• Moderate sensorineural hearing loss.
• Acoustic immittance measures are consistent with 
normal middle-ear function.
In view of the signiﬁ cant sensitivity loss, we recommend 
a hearing aid evaluation to assess the potential for 
successful use of ampliﬁ cation. Ear impressions were 
made, and a hearing aid consultation has been scheduled.
Sincerely,
Audiologist

The advantages of  using this approach are important. First, it 
is a very effi cient approach to report writing. In most cases the 
reporting can be completed before the patient leaves the clinic. 
Second, the accuracy of the report itself is enhanced by simply

Pediatric Hearing Consultation Results
Name: S.S.  Age: 2–3 years
Dear Dr. Referral,
Your patient, S.S., was evaluated on January 1. The 
patient was evaluated due to parental concerns about 
speech development. Results are as follows:
Right Ear
• Responses to speech were observed down to 5 dB HL. In 
addition, the patient responded to warble-tones in the 
soundﬁ eld down to 10 dB at 500 Hz, 5 dB at 1000 Hz, 
10 dB at 2000 Hz, and 10 dB at 4000 Hz. These results 
are consistent with normal hearing sensitivity in at least 
one ear.
• Acoustic immittance measures are consistent with 
normal middle-ear function
• Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) 
are present and robust, suggesting normal cochlear 
function.
Left Ear
• Responses to speech were observed down to 5 dB HL.
• Acoustic immittance measures are consistent with 
normal middle-ear function
• Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) 
are present and robust, suggesting normal cochlear 
function.
The overall pattern of results is consistent with normal 
hearing sensitivity and normal middle-ear function 
bilaterally. No audiologic recommendations are indicated 
at this time.
Sincerely,
Audiologist

516  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
MAKING REFERRALS
Patients arrive in the audiology clinic for a hearing consultation 
for many reasons. One reason is that they have a hearing prob-
lem, want to have it evaluated, and call to make an appointment. 
That is, they are self-referred. In other cases, family members and 
friends encourage patients to have a hearing evaluation and refer 
them to an audiologist. In many other cases, patients are referred 
for a hearing consultation by another health-care provider, such 
as an otolaryngologist, pediatrician, or primary-care physician.
The nature of the referral to an audiologist dictates many things. 
As delineated in earlier chapters, the audiometric testing itself 
may vary as a function of the referral source, as may the nature 
of a clinical report. In fact, the audiologist’s professional obliga-
tion varies depending on who is making the referral. The referral 
in dictates that obligation and infl uences the referral out.
Lines and Ethics of Referral
As a health-care provider, it is important to understand the lines 
of referral and the boundaries that are dictated by those lines. 
Audiologists play different roles in hearing health care, and those 
roles and their boundaries can vary signifi cantly as a function of 
the reason for a referral. In one case, a patient might come directly 
to you to evaluate and manage his or her hearing care. In another 
case, you might be consulted for an opinion on the nature and de-
gree of hearing loss as part of a patient’s medical workup. What 
you say, to whom you communicate, and how you proceed can 
be very different in these two cases. Some examples may help to 
illustrate this concept.
If a patient is self-referred and is paying for the evaluation, the au-
diologist’s complete obligation is to the patient. The outcome of 
testing and the disposition of a report are dictated by the interests 
of the patient. Therefore, if a patient does not want a report sent 
out, you are obligated to refrain from sending a report. There is 
an exception, of course, if the patient is not paying for the evalu-
ation. In that case, the audiologist may also be obligated to report 
to the third party. But, in general, the audiologist is free to evalu-
ate and manage the patient and to make whatever other referrals 
are deemed appropriate for the patient.

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  517
If a patient is referred to the audiologist by a physician for a hear-
ing consultation to assist the physician in the medical diagnosis 
and treatment of the patient, then the audiologist’s obligation is 
to the referral source. If the audiologist feels that the patient needs 
additional testing, needs to be referred to a medical specialist, 
needs hearing aids, and so on, the audiologist is obligated to make 
that recommendation to the referral source. This is an important 
concept and cannot be overstated. Under these circumstances, 
you as an audiologist are being consulted for your opinion, and 
that opinion should be given to the person who consulted you. 
You have not been asked to manage this patient, and you should 
not assume that authority.
If a patient is referred to the audiologist by a physician to assess 
the potential benefi t from amplifi cation and to provide it if neces-
sary, then the physician is making a referral to you to manage the 
patient. In this case, your obligation is once again to the patient, 
with consideration to the referral source in terms of re porting the 
outcome.
The concept of  lines of  referral and the ethics related to it 
are fairly simple to manage if  you know the answer to two 
questions: (1) who referred the patient? and (2) for what reason? 
The biggest challenge an audiologist faces is either not knowing 
the answer to one of these two questions or having the answer 
obscured for some reason. One of  the challenging situations 
for any practitioner is the secondary referral, or the consult 
within a consult, wherein the audiologist might follow the line 
of referral, but the referral source may not. The accompanying 
Clinical Note entitled “Did You Steal that Patient?” provides an 
example of an instance where this confusion might occur.
Another source of trouble occurs when the audiologist is challenged 
by the patient or by his or her knowledge to refer the patient for more 
specialized treatment. An example is given in the accompanying 
Clinical Note entitled “Should You Refer Onward?”. Here the audi-
ologist is challenged by confl icting ethical issues. One is the critical 
concept of making referrals back to the referral source. The other 
is the important concern for the welfare of the patient. In such in-
stances, the audiologist will do well to remember who is managing 
the patient and, thus, is ultimately responsible for the patient’s care.

518  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
Did You Steal that Patient?
One common source of confusion surrounding 
referral lines comes when there is a secondary 
referral, or a consult within a consult, and the au-
diologist is not clearly aware of the sequence that 
led to the patient sitting in the waiting room.
Let’s look at an example. Audiologist 1 is in pri-
vate practice in a professional building down the 
street from the medical center in which you work. 
She evaluates a patient who is interested in pur-
suing hearing aid use and notes the presence of 
a middle-ear disorder. The patient has signiﬁ cant 
sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally and will be a 
candidate for hearing aid ampliﬁ cation following 
management of the middle-ear disorder, but ﬁ rst 
things ﬁ rst. Audiologist 1 refers the patient down 
the street to an otolaryngologist who works in 
the same department that you do. The otolaryn-
gologist evaluates the patient and, as a matter of 
routine, refers to you for an audiologic consulta-
tion, and, if indicated, a hearing-aid consultation. 
You graciously receive the referral, evaluate the 
patient, and begin the hearing aid process.
The problem here is that you do not know about 
Audiologist 1. Somewhere in the sequence of re-
ferrals, the information about the original referral 
source is lost, and you assume that this is an oto-
laryngology referral just like any of the others that 
you have managed that day. The patient may be 
equally confused, not always understanding the 
sometimes obscure relationships among health-care 
providers. Regardless of the source of the confusion, 
it is difﬁ cult to reach any conclusion other than that 
this hearing aid patient was inadvertently stolen 
from Audiologist 1, who simply made a referral in 
the patient’s best interest for an otology consult.

continued
The lesson and course of action here are simple. 
The lesson is that you are obligated to under-
stand how this pa tient made it to your door. The 
course of action is to refer the patient back to 
 Audiologist 1 once you discover the error.
This type of dilemma becomes more difﬁ cult if 
the patient decides at this point that your services 
are more desirable than those of Audiologist 1. 
Your actual obligation is to the source of the re-
ferral to you, the otolaryngologist. But you also 
have a professional obligation to your colleague. 
These challenges are usually managed best with 
open dia logue among heath-care providers.
Should You Refer Onward?
A challenging referral dilemma often occurs when 
a patient who is referred to you by one medical 
practitioner requests that you provide referral in-
formation about more specialized medical care.
Perhaps the most common example of this occurs 
in the child who has chronic otitis media with ef-
fusion and is being treated by a pediatrician. In 
this example, the pediatrician refers to you as an 
audiologist to monitor the child’s hearing status 
and middle-ear function.
A typical medical treatment approach for otitis 
media is the initial use of antibiotics. If the treat-
ment fails to solve the problem, surgical placement 
of pressure-equalization tubes in the tympanic 
membrane may be indicated. The decision about 
how long to follow the antibiotic course and when 
to intervene with tube placement is often a dif-
ﬁ cult one for both pediatrician and otolaryngolo-
gist. Thrown into the mix may be an anxious

520  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
When to Refer
As a health-care provider, the audiologist is obligated to under-
stand when it is appropriate to refer a patient for additional as-
sessment or treatment. Again, it is important to remember that 
the recommendation for referral out should be made back to the 
original referral source, whether that be another health-care 
provider or the patient. For audiologists, the most common re-
ferrals are made to otolaryngologists because of  identification 
or suspicion of  active otologic disease and to speech-language 
patholo gists because of identifi cation or suspicion of speech and/
or language impairment.
Guidelines have been developed to assist health-care providers in 
identifying signs and symptoms of ear disease that warrant re-
ferral for otologic consultation. The American Academy of Oto-
laryngology suggests that there are seven signs of serious otologic 
continued
parent and an audiologist who is concerned about 
the long-term effects of otitis media.
At some point in the course of care, the par-
ent may want more aggressive treatment of her 
child’s problem. That parent may seek your opin-
ion for a referral to an otolaryngologist, because 
of an unfounded fear that to ask such a question 
of the pediatrician would be offensive.
What is your obligation here? You will do well to 
remember the original line of referral. Did you 
see this patient initially and refer to the pediatri-
cian? If so, your obligation is to the patient. Did 
the pediatrician initially refer the patient to you 
for an audiologic consult? If so, your obligation is 
to the referral source.
As in all things, dialogue among professionals is 
usually the best solution to referral issues.

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  521
disease that warrant referral for evaluation by an otolaryngologist. 
The seven signs are:
 1. ear pain and fullness;
 2. discharge or bleeding from the ear;
 3. sudden or progressive hearing loss, even with recovery;
 4. unequal hearing between ears or noise in the ear;
 5. hearing loss after an injury, loud sound, or air travel;
 6. slow or abnormal speech development in children; and
 7. balance disturbance or dizziness.
Based on the results of the audiologic evaluation, the audiologist 
should refer for otologic consultation if:
 1. otoscopic examination of the ear canal and tympanic 
membrane reveals infl ammation or other signs of 
disease;
 2. immittance audiometry indicates middle-ear disorder;
 3. acoustic refl ex thresholds are abnormally elevated;
 4. air- and bone-conduction audiometry reveals a signifi cant 
air-bone gap;
 5. speech recognition scores are signifi cantly asymmetric or 
are poorer than would be expected from the degree of hear-
ing loss or patient’s age; or
 6. other audiometric results are consistent with retrocochlear 
disorder.
There are also generally held guidelines for referring to the speech-
language pathologist due to suspicion of speech-language delays 
or disorder. These include:
 1. parental concern about speech and/or language 
 de velopment;
 2. speech-language development that falls below expected 
milestones, as delineated in the next box;
 3. observed defi ciency in speech production; or
 4. observed delays in expressive or receptive language 
ability.

Hearing, Speech, and Language 
Expectations
If a child is suspected of having a speech or lan-
guage problem, a referral should be made to a 
speech-language pathologist. The following ques-
tions reﬂ ect milestones in speech and language de-
velopment that parents can expect from their child. 
Parents should consider these questions in evaluat-
ing their child’s speech, language, and hearing de-
velopment. Failure to reach these milestones, or a 
“no” answer to any of these questions, is sufﬁ cient 
cause for a speech-language consultation.
Behaviors Expected by 6 Months of Age

524  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
Summary
Communicating results of the audiologic evaluation is an im-
• 
portant aspect of service provision.
Once the evaluation process is completed, results must be 
• 
conveyed to patients and, often, their families and signifi cant 
others.
One of  the challenges of  communicating with patients is to 
• 
convey enough information for them to understand the nature 
of the problem without overburdening them with detail.
One of the most important outcomes of information counsel-
• 
ing is setting the stage for treatment.
One of the most challenging aspects of informational counsel-
• 
ing of patients is remembering that this is each patient’s only 
hearing loss.
Another important aspect in the provision of audiologic care is 
• 
the documenting and reporting of results of the evaluation or 
treatment.
It is important to distinguish between documentation of test re-
• 
sults and reporting of test results.
The challenge of reporting is to describe what was found or 
• 
what was done in a clear, concise, and consistent manner.
The actual nature of a report can vary greatly depending on 
• 
the setting and the referral source to whom a report is most 
likely written.
The goal of any report is to communicate the outcome of your 
• 
evaluation and/or treatment.
One of  the biggest challenges in report writing is to pro-
• 
vide all relevant information while only reporting relevant 
information.
An audiologic report typically includes a description of the au-
• 
diometric confi guration, type of hearing loss, status of middle-
ear function, and recommendations.
Under certain circumstances, an audiologic report might also 
• 
include case history information, speech audiometric results, 
auditory electrophysiologic results, and a state ment about site 
of the auditory disorder.

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  525
Clinical reports should not include lengthy descriptions of test-
• 
ing procedures, outcomes, or rehabilitative strategies. Descrip-
tive information should be included as supplemental material 
and sent only to individuals who might read it.
As a health-care provider, it is important to understand the 
• 
lines of referral and the boundaries that are dictated by those 
lines.
The concept of lines of referral and the ethics related to it are 
• 
fairly simple to manage if you know the answer to two ques-
tions: Who referred the patient? And for what reason?
As a health-care provider, the audiologist is obligated to under-
• 
stand when it is appropriate to refer a patient for additional as-
sessment or treatment.
Referral challenges are usually managed best with open dia-
• 
logue among health-care providers.
Short Answer Questions
 1. Three components of communicating audiologic results are 
 to patients, writing 
, and making 
 to other health-care providers.
 2. The primary goal for talking with patients following au-
diologic testing is to help the patient understand what was 
learned from testing. This can be accomplished by helping 
the patient understand the 
 and 
 
of hearing impairment and its likely effect on communica-
tion ability; giving the patient 
 to use to de-
scribe their hearing loss; and providing the patient with a 
clear understanding of the next steps that need to be taken.
 3. An important task in talking to patients is to present infor-
mation in a manner that is 
 and does not pre-
sume too much 
 on the part of the patient.
 4. It is necessary to remember in talking with patients that 
each patient perspective is 
 and varies based 
upon the patient’s experience, knowledge, and motivation.
 5. Experienced patients typically wish to know whether their 
hearing has 
 and whether there are technologi-
cal 
 that may assist them with their hearing loss.

526  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
 6. Among other things, inexperienced patients typically want 
to know about the 
 of their hearing loss; how 
bad their hearing loss is; whether their hearing loss is medi-
cally 
; and whether the hearing loss is related 
to other health problems.
 7. Parents of children identifi ed with hearing loss typically 
want to know about the cause of the hearing loss. They are 
often in various stages of 
 regarding the hear-
ing loss. Upon learning that their child has a hearing loss, 
many patients are unable to cope with additional informa-
tion. However, some parents may wish to have immediate 
information about habilitation and 
 options.
 8. The 
 of results refers to the preservation of 
 examination and test results in a patient fi le.
 9. The 
 of results refers to the summarization of 
documentation.
 10. The 
 report is typically a stand-alone document 
that includes the audiogram, table of other audiometric 
 information, and summary and impressions.
 11. The 
 report may be accompanied by an audio-
gram. It typically includes a summary of results and the dis-
position of the patient. This type of document may be sent 
to the patient, an outside referral source, a school, or other 
interested parties.
 12. The three primary rules of report writing are to be 
, be 
, and be 
.
 13. In considering the report 
, it is typical to keep 
reports from self-referred patients in the offi ce, while reports 
from outside referrals are typically sent back to the referral 
source.
 14. In reporting on the case 
, the goal is to provide 
relevant information to orient the reader as to why consul-
tation took place.
 15. In describing the nature of the hearing loss, the terms con-
ductive, 
, or mixed should be used.
 16. The 
 and 
 of the hearing loss 
should be described. The terms chosen to describe these are 

CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS  527
meant to convey hearing sensitivity into words that can be 
used consistently for the patient.
 17. When previous hearing evaluation data are available, refer-
ence should be made to any 
 in hearing status.
 18. A statement regarding overall 
 
 
function should be made, followed by the specifi c 
 results that characterize the disorder.
 19. A description of 
 audiometric results is sel-
dom useful, unless these results are poorer than expected 
given the hearing loss, indicating a possible retrocochlear 
abnormality.
 20. Electrophysiologic results are most helpful when 
 are provided fi rst, followed by details about test 
results.
 21. A cochlear site of disorder is assumed in a sensorineural 
hearing loss, unless results are interpreted as being consist 
with a 
 or 
 
 disorder.
 22. A statement of 
 for patient’s is typically included 
so that patient’s knows what they should do following the 
 audiologic assessment.
 23. Supplementary materials, such as 
, are often 
given to patients to provide more information regarding the 
relevant disorder or treatment issue.
 24. The use of reporting 
 are helpful because they 
provide for greater consistency, reduce opportunities for 
 error, and facilitate the creation of a concise report.
 25. Two questions to be asked when determining the appropri-
ate line of referral for a patient are: “
 referred 
the patient?” and “For what 
 was the patient 
referred?”
 26. Guidelines for referral to an 
 include evidence 
of outer- or middle-ear disorder from patient complaints/ 
history, audiologic evidence of abnormal otoscopic exam, 
immittance measures, or pure-tone audiometry. Addition-
ally, evidence of 
 pathology, such as asym-
metric hearing loss, abnormally elevated acoustic refl ex 
thresholds, or abnormal word-recognition scores, requires 
referral for evaluation. 

528  CHAPTER 11  COMMUNICATING AUDIOMETRIC RESULTS
 27. Guidelines for referral to a 
-
 
 include parental concerns about speech-
language development, development that falls below 
expected 
, or observed defi ciencies in speech 
and/or language production.
Discussion Questions
 1. Why might it be important to provide less information, 
rather than more information, to parents who are fi rst being 
informed of their child’s hearing loss?
 2. How would you describe a conductive hearing loss to a 
patient?
 3. How would you describe a sensorineural hearing loss to a 
patient?
 4. In what ways would a report sent to an otolaryngologist 
 differ from a report sent to a school administrator?
 5. Explain the concept of lines of referral and obligation to 
 referral sources.
 6. Explain when it would be appropriate to refer a patient for 
additional assessment or treatment.

530  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
AS you have learned, the most common consequence of an audi-
tory disorder is a loss of hearing sensitivity. In most cases, the dis-
order causing the sensitivity loss cannot be managed by medical or 
surgical intervention. Thus, to ameliorate the impairment caused by 
hearing sensitivity loss, audiologic treatment must be implemented.
The fundamental goal of audiologic management is to limit the ex-
tent of any communication disorder that results from a hearing loss. 
The fi rst step in reaching that goal is to maximize the use of residual 
hearing. That is, every effort is made to put the remaining hearing 
that a patient has to its most effective use. Once this has been done, 
treatment often proceeds with some form of aural rehabilitation.
The most common first step in the management process is the 
use of hearing aids. More precisely, the most common treatment 
aimed at maximizing the use of residual hearing is the introduc-
tion of hearing aid amplifi cation. The most common form of am-
plifi cation is the conventional hearing aid. In some cases, other 
hearing assistive technology may be used to supplement or substi-
tute for hearing aid use. In individuals with a severe or profound 
loss of hearing, a cochlear implant may be indicated.
When hearing aids were fi rst developed, they were relatively large 
in size and infl exible in terms of their amplifying characteristics. 
Hearing aid use was restricted almost exclusively to individuals 
with substantial conductive hearing loss. Today’s hearing aids are 
much smaller, and their amplifi cation characteristics can be pro-
grammed at will. Hearing aids are now used almost exclusively by 
those with sensorineural hearing loss.
A cochlear implant is 
a device that is surgically 
implanted into the cochlea to 
deliver electrical stimulation 
to the auditory nerve.
Deﬁ ne the goal of audiologic management.
• 
List and describe methods for maximization 
• 
of residual hearing.
Describe who is a candidate for ampliﬁ cation.
• 
List and explain patient variables that relate 
• 
to prognosis for successful hearing aid use.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
Explain how the hearing needs assessment 
• 
relates to selection and ﬁ tting of hearing-
device technology.
Describe how hearing-device success may 
• 
be evaluated.

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  531
Candidacy for hearing aid amplification is fairly straightfor-
ward. If a patient has a sensorineural hearing impairment that 
is causing a communication disorder, the patient is a candidate 
for amplification. Thus, even when a hearing impairment is 
mild, if it is causing diffi culty with communication, the patient 
is likely to benefi t from hearing aid amplifi cation. If  a patient 
has a conductive hearing loss, it can usually be treated medi-
cally. If all attempts at medical treatment have been exhausted, 
then the same rule of candidacy applies for conductive hearing 
loss. Conductive hearing loss may also be treated with bone con-
duction devices, including surgically implanted, bone-anchored 
hearing aids.
If  a patient has hearing impairment in both ears that is fairly 
symmetric, it is a good idea to fi t that patient with two hearing 
aids. In fact, up to 95% of individuals with hearing impairment 
are binaural candidates. Benefi ts from binaural hearing aids in-
clude enhancements in:
audibility of speech originating from different directions,
• 
localization of sound, and
• 
hearing speech in noisy environments (for a review, see 
• 
 Davis & Mencher, 2006).
In addition, evidence exists that the use of only one hearing aid in 
patients with bilateral hearing loss may have a long-term detri-
mental effect on the ear that is not fi tted with an aid (Silman et al., 
1984; Silverman & Silman, 1990). Except for cost, there are no 
good reasons not to wear two hearing aids.
The process of  obtaining hearing aids begins with a thorough 
audiological assessment. Following the audiological assessment, 
prudent hearing health care dictates a medical assessment to rule 
out any active pathology that might contraindicate hearing aid 
use. Following medical clearance, impressions of the ears and ear 
canals are usually made for customizing earmolds or hearing aid 
devices. When the devices are received from the manufacturer, 
they are adjusted and fi tted to the patient, and an evaluation is 
made of the fi tting success. After successful fi tting and dispensing, 
the patient usually returns for any necessary minor adjustments 
or to discuss any problems related to hearing aid use. At that time, 
When a hearing loss is 
the same in both ears, it is 
considered symmetric.
When a hearing loss is 
moderate in one ear and 
severe in the other, it is 
considered asymmetric.
A person wearing two 
hearing aids is ﬁ tted 
binaurally. 
A person wearing one hearing 
aid is ﬁ tted monaurally.
When a hearing loss occurs 
in both ears, it is bilateral.
When hearing loss occurs in 
only one ear, it is unilateral.

532  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
self-assessed benefi t or satisfaction is often measured as a means 
of assessing treatment outcome.
Although the goal of audiologic management is relatively con-
stant, the approach can vary signifi cantly depending on patient 
age, the nature of  the hearing impairment, and the extent of 
communication requirements in daily life. For example, in in-
fants and young children, the extent of sensitivity loss may not 
be precisely quantifi ed, making hearing aid fi tting of children a 
more protracted challenge than it is in most adults. In addition, 
extensive habilitative treatment aimed at ensuring oral language 
development will be implemented in young children, whereas lit-
tle rehabilitation beyond hearing aid orientation may be required 
in adults.
Audiologic treatment will also vary based on the nature and de-
gree of hearing impairment. For example, patients with severe 
and profound hearing loss are likely to benefit more from a co-
chlear implant than from conventional hearing aid amplifi cation. 
As another example, patients with auditory processing disorders 
associated with aging may benefi t from the use of assistive listen-
ing devices or other hearing assistive technology as supplements 
to their conventional hearing aids.
Finally, hearing treatment can vary depending on the com-
munication demands that patients have in their daily lives. 
For example, an older patient who lives a solitary lifestyle 
will have different hearing needs than a patient with job-
related communication demands and an active lifestyle. The 
type of  amplification system required and the need for aural 
rehabilitation can vary considerably between these extremes of 
communication demand.
THE FIRST QUESTIONS
Audiologic management really begins with assessment—not only 
assessment of hearing but also assessment of treatment needs. 
The hearing evaluation serves as a first step in the treatment 

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  533
process. Toward this end, there are some important questions to 
be answered from the audiologic evaluation. They include:
Is there evidence of a hearing disorder?
• 
Can medically treatable conditions be ruled out?
• 
What is the extent of the patient’s hearing sensitivity loss?
• 
How well does the patient understand speech and process 
• 
auditory information?
Is the hearing disorder causing impairment?
• 
Does the hearing impairment cause activity limitations or 
• 
participation restrictions?
Are there any auditory factors that contraindicate success-
• 
ful hearing-device use?
Answers to these questions will lead to a decision about the 
patient’s candidacy for hearing aid amplification from an au-
ditory perspective. Equally important, however, are the ques-
tions to be answered from an assessment of  treatment needs. 
They include:
Why is the patient seeking hearing aid amplifi cation?
• 
How motivated is the patient to use amplifi cation 
• 
successfully?
Under what conditions is the hearing loss causing commu-
• 
nication diffi culty?
What are the demands on the patient’s communication 
• 
abilities?
What is the patient’s physical, psychological, and sociologi-
• 
cal status?
What human resources are available to the patient to sup-
• 
port successful amplifi cation use?
What fi nancial resources are available to the patient to sup-
• 
port audiologic treatment?
The answers to these questions help to determine candidacy for 
hearing aid amplification and begin to provide the audiologist 
with the insight necessary to determine the type and extent of the 
hearing treatment process.

534  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
The Importance of Asking Why
Why is the patient seeking hearing aid amplifi cation? It sounds like 
such a simple question. Yet the answer is a very important step 
in the treatment process because it guides the audiologist to an 
appropriate management strategy. There are usually two main is-
sues related to this why question, one pertaining to the patient’s 
motivation and the other pertaining to the need-specifi c nature of 
the amplifi cation strategy.
The fi rst reason for asking why a patient is pursuing hearing aid 
use is to determine, to the extent possible, the factors that moti-
vated the patient to seek your services. Motivation is important 
because it is highly correlated with prognosis; prognosis is impor-
tant because it is highly correlated with success and tends to dic-
tate the strength and direction of your efforts.
Do you want to see an audiologist wince? Watch as a patient states 
that the only reason he or she is pursuing hearing aid use is be-
cause his or her spouse is forcing the issue. If this truly is the only 
reason that the patient is seeking hearing aid amplifi cation, the 
prognosis for successful use is not positive.
A patient who is internally motivated to hear better is an excel-
lent candidate for successful hearing aid use. The breadth of am-
plifi cation options for such a patient is substantial. For example, 
patients with a moderate sensorineural hearing loss will benefi t 
from conventional hearing aids in many of their daily activities. 
They might also fi nd a telephone amplifi er to be of benefi t at home 
and work and are likely to avail themselves of the assistive listen-
ing devices available in many public theaters, churches, or other 
meeting facilities. Such a patient will use two hearing aids, per-
mitting better hearing in noise and better localization ability, and 
will probably want advanced features in their hearing aids to en-
sure better adaptation to changing acoustic environments.
In contrast, a patient who seeks audiologic care as a result of ex-
ternal factors will fi nd any of a number of reasons why hearing aid 
amplifi cation is not satisfactory. The patient will fi nd the sound of 
a hearing aid to be unnatural and noisy, the battery replacement

of the course or outcome of 
a disease or treatment.

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  535
costs to be excessive, and the gadgetry associated with assistive 
technology to be a nuisance. Such a patient will insist on wearing 
one hearing aid and will complain about the diffi culty hearing in 
noise when the aid is on. The patient will probably want a hearing 
aid with few processing features and be dissatisfi ed when it can-
not be adjusted limitlessly to address the patient’s hearing needs.
The contrast in motivation can be striking, as can the contrast in 
your ability as an audiologist to meet the patient’s needs and ex-
pectations. Knowing why, from a motivation viewpoint, is an im-
portant fi rst question.
Another reason that the why question is so important is that it 
can lead to successful yet unconventional solutions to the pa-
tient’s hearing needs. Thirty years ago, this did not really matter. 
Hearing aids varied little, and there was no need to distinguish 
between conventional and situation-speciﬁ c ampliﬁ cation, be-
cause situation-specifi c amplifi cation was not readily available. 
Today, amplification options are numerous and growing. You 
will learn more in the next chapter about the burgeoning tech-
nology available to those with hearing impairment. The grow-
ing advantage is that amplifi cation can be tailored to a patient’s 
communication needs rather than used generically for all hear-
ing losses and all individuals. The result is that patients can be 
treated more effectively by adapting the technology to the pa-
tient’s situation and needs rather than by asking the patient to 
adapt to the technology.
A simple example of situation-specifi c amplifi cation may serve to 
make the point. Suppose that a patient’s only hearing concern is 
that she cannot hear the television when it is set to a volume that 
is comfortable for her spouse. In the past, there was a tendency on 
the part of the audiologist to look fi rst to a general solution (i.e., 
conventional hearing aids) to this specifi c problem. The general so-
lution was helpful, of course, but it could have been much better 
if it had been tailored to the patient’s need to hear the television. 
Today’s technology is making need- and/or situation-specifi c am-
plifi cation so much of a reality that the question why is becoming 
ever more important.
Situation-speciﬁ c 
ampliﬁ cation, or hearing 
assistive technology, includes 
such devices as FM systems, 
TV ampliﬁ ers, doorbell and 
telephone ampliﬁ ers, and 
other assistive listening 
devices designed to meet a 
speciﬁ c need or situation.

536  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
Assessment of need can be carried out informally, or it can be carried 
out formally with a questionnaire. An example of a questionnaire 
that addresses the situational-specific needs of individuals with 
hearing impairment is shown in Figure 12-1. Either the formal 
or informal approach can lead the audiologist to an impression of 
whether the individual’s amplifi cation needs are general, requiring 
the use of conventional amplifi cation solutions, or more specifi c, 
requiring a more tailored solution.
Once a patient’s motivation and needs are known, the available 
audiometric and self-assessment data are used to determine 
candidacy for treatment and to help determine an effective am-
plifi cation approach.
Where I Live: Troy, Michigan
Where I Work: Detroit Public Schools. This large district 
has approximately 200 public schools and 150 nonpublic 
and private schools. Ten educational audiologists service the 
hearing needs of this district, including Early Intervention, 
Early-On, Head-Start, and four adjacent school districts lo-
cated within Wayne County. The Detroit Public Schools has 
a speech and hearing clinic where we provide diagnostic 
testing. We also have portable audiometric equipment for testing in the schools.
What I Do: As an educational audiologist, I spend most of my time identifying or monitor-
ing the hearing of Detroit-resident students ages 0–26 and determining and fi tting appropri-
ate FM amplifi cation for hearing impaired children. I work with the teacher consultants of 
the hearing impaired and school speech-language pathologists to support the IEP team. I also 
counsel and/or in-service parents, teachers, and other educational personnel on hearing and 
the utilization of amplifi cation equipment. I travel throughout the city of Detroit. 
Why Audiology? Practicing audiology in the educational setting is very rewarding. 
I have always enjoyed working with the pediatric population and can apply my diagnostic and 
habilitative skills to help provide an optiminal listening environment for education.

538  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
Assessment of Treatment Candidacy
The goal of assessment is to determine candidacy for audiologic 
management. The process for doing so includes several important 
steps. The fi rst step is often the audiologic evaluation, which will 
determine the type and extent of hearing loss. Following the audio-
logic evaluation, the patient is counseled about the nature of the re-
sults and recommendations to assist in the decision about whether 
to pursue amplifi cation. Once the decision is made to go forward, 
the assessment continues with an evaluation of the patient’s com-
munication needs, self-assessment of limitations and restrictions, 
psychosocial status, physical capacity, and fi nancial status.
If the decision is made to pursue hearing aid use, medical clear-
ance should be procured from a physician. This typically involves 
otoscopic inspection of the external auditory meatus and tym-
panic membrane, in an effort to ensure that no medical conditions 
exist that would contraindicate use of a hearing aid.
Audiologic Assessment
The audiologic assessment for treatment purposes is the same 
as that described in detail in Chapters 5 and 6. For the most part 
the strategies and techniques used for diagnostic assessment and 
treatment assessment are identical. The reasons for the assess-
ment are different, however, and that tends to change the manner 
in which the outcomes are viewed. For example, air-conduction 
and bone-conduction audiometry are used to determine the ex-
tent of any conductive component to the hearing loss. Diagnosti-
cally that information might be used to confi rm the infl uence of 
middle-ear disorder and for pre- and post-assessment of surgical 
success. From the audiologic treatment perspective, a conductive 
component to the hearing loss has a signifi cant impact on how 
much amplifi cation a hearing aid will need to deliver to the ear. 
Although the clinical strategy, instrumentation, and techniques 
are the same, the outcome has different meaning for medical di-
agnosis and audiologic treatment.
As always, assessment begins with the case history. The audiolo-
gist will begin here to pursue information about and develop im-
pressions of the patient’s motivation for hearing aid amplifi cation, 
should it prove to be indicated by the audiometric results.

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  539
The next step in the evaluation is the otoscopic inspection of the 
auricle, external auditory canal, and tympanic membrane. The 
fundamental reasons for doing this are to inspect for any obvious 
signs of ear disease and to ensure an unimpeded canal for insert 
earphones or immittance probe placement. In addition, if the pa-
tient appears to be a candidate for amplifi cation, the audiologist 
also uses this opportunity to begin to form an impression of the 
fi tting challenges that will be presented by the size and shape of 
the patient’s ear canal.
Immittance audiometry is used to assess middle-ear function in 
an effort to rule out middle-ear disorder as a contributing factor 
to the hearing loss. This is no different for treatment than for diag-
nostic assessment.
Air-conduction pure-tone audiometry is used to quantify hearing 
sensitivity across the audiometric frequency range. If immittance 
measures show middle-ear disorder, then bone-conduction audi-
ometry is used to quantify the extent of any conductive compo-
nent to the hearing loss. The air-conduction thresholds and the 
size of the conductive component are both crucial pieces of infor-
mation for determination of the appropriate hearing aid amplifi -
cation characteristics.
Speech audiometry is at least as important to the treatment as-
sessment as it is to the diagnostic assessment. Speech recognition 
ability is an important indicator of how the ear functions at su-
prathreshold levels. If speech perception is signifi cantly degraded 
or if it is unusually affected by the presence of background noise, 
the prognosis for successful conventional hearing aid use may be 
reduced. Conventional speech audiometric measures of  word-
 recognition ability in quiet may be useful in this context, but more 
sophisticated assessment of speech recognition in competition 
is probably a better prognostic indicator of benefi t from hearing 
aid use.
Determination of frequency-specifi c thresholds of discomfort can 
be an important component of the treatment assessment but is 
seldom carried out as part of a diagnostic assessment. A threshold 
of  discomfort (TD) is just as it sounds, the level at which a sound 
becomes uncomfortable to the listener. Many terms are used to 

540  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
describe this level, the most generic and perhaps useful of which is 
the threshold of discomfort. Some of the other terms and a tech-
nique for determining TDs are described in the accompanying 
Clinical Note. Determination of the TD across the frequency range 
is important because it provides guidance about the maximum 
output levels of a hearing aid that will be tolerable to the patient. 
This is particularly important in patients with tolerance problems 
and reduced dynamic range of hearing. More will be said about 
all of that in Chapters 13 and 14.
All of  the information gleaned from the case history and au-
diologic evaluation is taken together to determine the potential 
candidacy of the patient for hearing aid amplifi cation. Once the 
determination is made, a treatment assessment commences.
Treatment Assessment
The treatment assessment is carried out using a patient-centered 
approach and is designed to determine the self-perception and 
family-perception of communication needs; the patient’s physical, 
psychological, and sociological status; and the suffi ciency of hu-
man and fi nancial resources to support hearing treatment. Specif-
ically, the following areas are assessed in one manner or another:
informal and formal assessment of communication needs,
• 
self- and family-assessment of activity limitations or partici-
• 
pation restrictions,
selection of goals for treatment, and
• 
nonauditory needs assessment, including:
• 
 
– motoric and other physical abilities,
 
– psychosocial status, and
 
– fi nancial status.
Informal assessment of communication needs was discussed ear-
lier. Its importance is paramount in the provision of properly fo-
cused hearing treatment services. Communication needs should 
be thoroughly examined prior to determination of an amplifi ca-
tion strategy.
Formal assessment of  communication needs and function is 
an  important component of the treatment process. It is usually 

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  541
How to Determine a TD
Determination of a threshold of discomfort (TD) 
can be an important early step in the hearing aid 
ﬁ tting process. The purpose of determining dis-
comfort levels is to set the maximum output of a 
hearing aid at a level that permits the widest dy-
namic range of hearing possible without letting 
loud sounds be ampliﬁ ed to uncomfortable levels. 
This can be critical to the patient’s satisfaction, es-
pecially if the patient has tolerance problems.
Numerous terms have been used to describe the 
threshold of discomfort, including uncomfortable 
loudness (UCL), uncomfortable level (UL), upper 
limits of comfortable loudness (ULCL), uncomfort-
able loudness level (ULL), and loudness discomfort 
level (LDL). The term threshold of discomfort is a 
reasonable alternative to these because discom-
fort can be related, to quality of a signal as well 
as its loudness.
Many factors need to be considered in determin-
ing a discomfort level. Instructions to patients, 
type of signals used, and response strategies can 
all inﬂ uence the measurement of TDs.
Following is a protocol for determining threshold 
of discomfort (after Mueller & Bright, 1994);
1. Provide concise instructions to the patient 
about the purpose of the test and the desired 
response. You are trying to ﬁ nd a level that is 
somewhere between “initial discomfort” and 
“extreme discomfort.” That level is usually 
described as “deﬁ nite discomfort” or “uncom-
fortably loud.”
2. Provide patients with a list of descriptions, 
such as those in Figure 12-2, relating to the 
loudness of sounds that will be presented.

achieved with self-assessment measures of activity limitations (dis-
ability) or participation restrictions (handicap), many of which have 
been developed for this purpose. There are at least two important 
reasons for measuring the extent to which a hearing impairment 
is limiting or restrictive to a patient. One is that it provides the audi-
ologist with additional information about the patient’s communica-
tion needs and motivation. The other is that it serves as an outcome 
measure, that is, as a baseline assessment against which to compare 
the eventual benefi ts gained from hearing aid amplifi cation.

3. Use pure-tone signals of 500, 1000, 1500, 
2000, and 3000 Hz.
4. Use an ascending method, in 2 or 5 dB steps. 
Present the pure-tone signal to the patient and 
increase it until the  listener indicates uncom-
fortable loudness. Reduce the intensity to a 
comfortable level and then increase again until 
it is uncomfortable. The TD is taken as the level 
that gives the perception of loudness between 
“loud but O.K.” and “uncomfortably loud” on 
two out of three trials.

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  543
Many self-assessment and outcome measures are available (for an 
overview, see Johnson & Danhauer, 2002). Some are designed for 
specifi c populations, such as the elderly; others are more generally 
applicable. Although designed to assess communication needs, 
they can also be helpful in getting a feel for patient expectations of 
hearing aid use. 
One that is population specifi c is the HHIE, or Hearing Handicap 
Inventory for the Elderly (Ventry & Weinstein, 1982). The HHIE 
is a 25-item measure that evaluates the social and emotional as-
pects of hearing loss in patients who are elderly. An example of 
one of the questions that evaluates social impact is “Does a hear-
ing problem cause you to use the phone less often than you would 
like?” An example that evaluates emotional impact is “Does a 
hearing problem cause you to feel embarrassed when meeting 
new people?” Questions are answered on a three-point scale of 
yes, sometimes, and no. Points are assigned for each answer, and 
total, social, and emotional scores are calculated.
Another self-assessment measure that enjoys widespread use is 
the APHAB, or Abbreviated Profi le of Hearing Aid Benefi t (Cox & 
 Alexander, 1995). The APHAB consists of 24 items that describe 
various listening situations. A sample of these items is shown in 
Figure 12-1. The patient’s task is to judge how often a particular 
situation is experienced, ranging from never to always. Answers 
are assigned a percentage, and the scale is scored in terms of those 
percentages. Results can then be analyzed into four subscales: 
(1) communication effort in easy listening environments; (2) speech- 
recognition ability in reverberant conditions; (3) speech recognition 
in the presence of competing sound; and (4) aversiveness to sound. 
The Client Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) is another mea-
sure more tailored to individual communication needs (Dillon 
et al., 1997). The COSI consists of 16 standardized situations of 
listening diffi culty. In this measure, the patient chooses and ranks 
fi ve areas that are of specifi c interest at the initial evaluation and 
then judges the listening difficulty following hearing aid use. 
A variation on the same theme is the Glasgow Hearing Aid Ben-
efi t Profi le (GHABP) (Gatehouse, 1999), which measures the im-
portance and relevance of different listening situations in a more 
formal way. In this measure, patients are asked to select relevant 

544  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
situations, indicate how often they are in such situations, how dif-
fi cult the situation is, and how much handicap it causes. Follow-
ing treatment, patients are asked how often they used the hearing 
aids in these situations and the extent to which they helped.
Some measures are intended for use simply to measure outcome 
rather than to assess needs. The International Outcome Inven-
tory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) is a brief self-assessment scale that 
was carefully developed with good normative data for patients 
with hearing loss (Cox & Alexander, 2002). The IOI-HA consists 
of seven questions that explore various dimensions important to 
successful use of hearing aids. These include daily use, benefit, 
residual activity limitation, satisfaction, participation, impact 
on others and quality of life. As an example, the question that 
explores quality of life is: “Considering everything, how much 
has your present hearing aids changed your enjoyment of life?” 
 Responses are made on a fi ve-point scale, ranging from “worse” to 
“very much better.”
Some audiologists will ask a patient to have a spouse or signifi cant 
other complete an assessment scale along with the patient. By doing 
so, the audiologist can gain insight into communication needs that 
the patient may overlook or underestimate. The process has an added 
benefit of providing the family with a forum for communicating 
about the communication disorder.
The selection of  goals for treatment is another important as-
pect of  the audiologic management process. This is often ac-
complished informally or with measures such as the COSI and 
GHABP. One important purpose of  goal setting is to help the 
patient establish realistic expectations for what they wish to 
achieve. Goals can be related to better hearing, such as improved 
conversation with grandchildren, or more to quality of  life or 
emotional needs, such as feeling less embarrassed about not un-
derstanding a conversation. Setting of goals may also help in the 
selection process by emphasizing the need for a particular hear-
ing aid feature or assistive technology.
The other assessment that needs to be done is of  nonauditory 
 factors that relate to successful treatment.

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  545
Physical ability, particularly fi ne motor coordination, can be an 
important factor in successful use of hearing aid amplifi cation. 
Particularly in the aging population, reduced fi ne motor control 
can make manipulation of conventional hearing aids and hearing 
aid batteries a challenging endeavor. Assessment should occur 
prior to the time of fi tting a particular hearing device.
Visual ability is also an important component of the communica-
tion process and can have an impact on hearing treatment. Most 
people benefit to some extent from the compensation afforded 
high-frequency hearing loss through the use of speechreading of 
the lips and face. A reduction in visual acuity can reduce the prog-
nosis for successful hearing treatment.
Mental status, psychological well-being, and social environment 
can all have an impact on the success of a hearing management 
program. Memory constraints or other affected cognitive function-
ing can limit the usefulness of certain types of amplification ap-
proaches. Attitude, motivation, and readiness are all psychological 
factors that can impact hearing treatment. In addition, the avail-
ability of human resources, such as family and friends, can have a 
signifi cant positive impact on the prognosis for successful hearing 
aid use. Although most audiologists do not assess these factors di-
rectly, most do use directed dialogue techniques during the prelimi-
nary counseling to assess these various areas for obvious problems.
Hearing aid amplifi cation and fi tting are expensive. A frank dis-
cussion of the expenses related to hearing aids is an important 
component of any treatment evaluation.
Once the assessment is completed, the treatment challenge be-
gins. Prepared with a knowledge of the patient’s hearing ability, 
communication needs, and overall resources, the audiologist can 
begin the challenge of implementing audiologic management.
THE AUDIOLOGIST’S CHALLENGE
The audiologist faces a number of clinical challenges during the 
treatment process. One of  the first challenges is to determine 
whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for amplifi cation 

546  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
or whether the prognosis is such that hearing aids should not be 
considered. Certain types of disorders and audiometric confi gura-
tions pose daunting hearing aid challenges. Thus, the fi rst step in 
the treatment process is to determine whether the patient is likely to 
benefi t from amplifi cation. Once a decision has been made that the 
patient is a candidate, the treatment process includes a determina-
tion of type of amplifi cation system, implementation of the actual 
fi tting of the devices, validation of the fi t, and specifi cation of ad-
ditional treatment needs.
Amplification—Yes or No?
As a general rule, most patients who seek hearing aids can benefi t 
from their use. Thus, in most cases the answer to the question of 
whether a patient should pursue amplifi cation is an easy yes, and 
the challenges are related to getting the type and fi tting correct.
Even in cases in which the prognosis for successful hearing aid use 
is poor, most audiologists will make an effort to fi nd an amplifi ca-
tion solution if the patient is suffi ciently motivated. In the extreme 
case, however, the potential for benefit is sufficiently marginal 
that pursuit of conventional hearing aid use is not even recom-
mended. Some of the factors that negatively impact prognosis for 
success include:
patient does not perceive a problem,
• 
not enough hearing loss,
• 
too much hearing loss,
• 
a “diffi cult” hearing loss confi guration,
• 
very poor speech recognition ability,
• 
auditory processing disorder, and
• 
active disease process in the ear canal.
• 
Although none of these factors preclude hearing aid use, they can 
limit the potential that might otherwise be achieved by well-fi tted 
amplifi cation.
A patient who does not perceive the hearing loss to be a signifi cant 
problem is usually one with a slowly progressive, high-frequency 
hearing loss. This tends to be the patient who can “hear a (low-
frequency) dog bark three blocks away” or could understand his 

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  547
spouse “if she would just speak more clearly.” Some of this denial 
is understandable because the loss has occurred gradually and the 
patient has adjusted to it. Many people with a hearing loss of this 
nature will not view it as suffi ciently handicapping to require the 
assistance of hearing aids. As an audiologist, you might be able to 
show the patient that he will obtain signifi cant benefi t from hear-
ing aid use, and you probably should try. But the prognosis for 
successful use is limited by the patient’s lack of motivation and rec-
ognition of the nature of the problem. In this case, greatest suc-
cess will probably come with patience. It is a wise clinical decision 
to simply educate the patient about hearing loss and the potential 
benefi t of hearing aid use. Then, when the patient becomes more 
aware of the loss or it progresses and becomes a communication 
problem, he will be aware of his amplifi cation options.
Some patients have a hearing loss, but it is not sufficient in 
magnitude for hearing aid use. The defi nition of “suffi cient” has 
changed dramatically over the years. Currently, even patients 
with minimal hearing losses can wear mild gain hearing aids with 
success. As a general rule, if the hearing impairment is enough 
to cause a problem in communication, the patient is a candidate 
for hearing aids. Nevertheless, a certain minimum degree 
and configuration of  loss must occur before hearing aid use is 
warranted.
Some patients have too much hearing loss for hearing aid use. 
Severe or profound hearing loss can limit the usefulness of even 
the most powerful hearing aids. You will learn in the next chap-
ter that the amount of amplifi cation boost or gain that a hearing 
aid can provide has its limits. In many cases of profound hearing 
loss, a hearing aid can provide only environmental awareness or 
some rudimentary perception of speech. Many patients will not 
consider this to be valuable enough to warrant the use of hearing 
aids. In these cases, cochlear implantation is often the treatment 
strategy that is most benefi cial.
For some audiometric configurations, it is very challenging to 
provide appropriate amplification. Two examples are shown in 
Figure 12-3. One diffi cult confi guration is the high-frequency pre-
cipitous loss. In this case, hearing sensitivity is normal through 
500 Hz, and drops off dramatically at higher frequencies. There 

548  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
may even be “dead” regions in the cochlea, where hair cell loss 
is so complete that no transduction occurs. Trying to amplify the 
higher frequency sounds excessively presents a whole series of 
challenges, not the least of which is that the sound quality is usu-
ally not very pleasing to the patient. Depending on the frequency 
at which the loss begins and the slope of the loss, these types of 
hearing loss can be very diffi cult to fi t effectively. In some cases, 
patients with this confi guration of hearing loss are candidates for 
cochlear implants. The other extreme is the so-called reverse slope 
hearing loss, a relatively unusual audiometric configuration in 
which a hearing loss occurs at the low frequencies, but not the 
high frequencies. The fi rst problem with respect to amplifi cation is 
that this type of loss seldom causes enough of a communication 
problem to warrant hearing aid use. When it does, certain aspects 
of the fi tting can be troublesome, and the prognosis for successful 
fi tting is somewhat limited.

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  549
Some types of cochlear hearing loss, such as that due to endolym-
phatic hydrops, can cause substantial distortion of the incoming 
sound, resulting in very poor speech-recognition ability. If it is 
poor enough, hearing aid amplifi cation simply will not be effec-
tive in overcoming the hearing loss. Regardless of how much or 
what type of amplifi cation is used to deliver signals to the ear, the 
cochlea distorts the signal to an extent that hearing aid benefi t 
may be limited. Fortunately, this type of disorder is seldom bilat-
eral, but when it is, hearing aid use will contribute to audibility 
but may not be satisfactory overall.
Auditory processing disorders in young children and in aging 
adults can reduce the benefi t from conventional hearing aid am-
plifi cation. In fact, it is not unusual for geriatric patients who were 
once successful hearing aid users to experience increasingly less 
success as their central auditory nervous system changes with 
age. The problem is seldom extreme enough to preclude hearing 
aid use, but these patients may benefi t more from assistive tech-
nology to complement conventional hearing aid use.
There are some physical and medical limitations that can make 
conventional hearing aid use diffi cult. Occasionally a patient with 
hearing loss will have external otitis or ear drainage that cannot be 
controlled medically. Even if the patient has medical clearance for 
hearing aid use, placing a hearing aid in such an ear can be a con-
stant source of problems. Other problems that limit access to the 
ear canal include canal stenosis and certain rare pain disorders. 
In such cases, amplification strategies other than conventional 
hearing aids must be employed. For example, a bone-anchored 
hearing aid, which bypasses the outer and middle ears and stimu-
lates the cochlea directly, may be a very benefi cial option.
These are some of the factors that make hearing aid fi tting diffi -
cult. It should be emphasized again, however, that if a person is 
having a communication disorder from a hearing loss, there is a 
very high likelihood that the person can benefi t from some form 
of hearing aid amplifi cation. That is, the answer to the question of 
amplifi cation is usually yes, although the question of how to do it 
successfully is sometimes challenging.

550  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
Amplification Strategies
Once the decision has been made to pursue the use of hearing 
aid amplifi cation, the challenge has just begun. At the very be-
ginning of the hearing aid fi tting process, the audiologist must 
formulate an amplification strategy based on the outcome of 
the treatment assessment. Various patient factors will have an 
impact on the decisions made about amplifi cation alternatives. 
These include:
hearing loss factors, such as
• 
 
– type of loss
 
– degree of loss
 
– audiometric confi guration, and
 
– speech perception;
medical factors, such as
• 
 
– progressive loss
 
– fl uctuating loss, and
 
– auricular limitations;
physical factors; and
• 
cognitive factors.
• 
With these patient-related considerations in mind, the audiologist 
must make decisions about amplifi cation strategies, approaches, 
and options, including:
type of amplifi cation system
• 
 
– conventional hearing aids
 
– assistive technology
 
– middle-ear or cochlear implant
which ear
• 
 
– monaural versus binaural
 
– better ear or poorer ear
 
– contralateral routing of signals; and

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  551
conventional hearing aid options
• 
 
– signal processing strategy
 
– device style
 
– hearing aid features.
The type of amplifi cation strategy is dictated by various patient 
factors. Clearly though, the vast majority of patients with hearing 
impairment can benefi t from conventional hearing aid amplifi ca-
tion. It is only the exceptional patient that will go on to exclusive 
use of assistive technology or to a cochlear implant. And even in 
these cases, conventional hearing aids are likely to be tried as the 
initial amplifi cation strategy. In general then, except in the rare 
circumstances described in the previous section, the decision is 
made to pursue hearing aid use.
The second group of options tends to be an easy decision as well. 
In most cases, the best answer to the question of which ear to fi t 
is both. There are several important reasons for having two ears 
(Davis & Mencher, 2006). The ability to localize the source of a 
sound in the environment relies heavily on hearing with both 
ears. The brain evaluates signals delivered to both ears for differ-
ences that provide important clues as to the location of the source 
of a sound. This binaural processing enhances the audibility of 
speech originating from different directions. The use of two ears 
is also important in the ability to suppress background noise. 
This ability is of great importance to the listener in focusing on 
speech or other sounds of interest in the foreground. Hearing is 
also more sensitive with two ears than with one. All of these fac-
tors create a binaural advantage for the listener with two ears. 
Thus, if a patient has symmetric hearing loss or asymmetry that 
is not too extensive, the patient will benefi t more from two hear-
ing aids than from one hearing aid. There is one other compel-
ling reason to fi t two hearing aids. Evidence suggests that fi tting 
a hearing aid to only one ear places the unaided ear at a relative 
disadvantage. This asymmetry may have a long-term detrimental 
effect on the suprathreshold ability of the unaided ear (Silman et al., 
1984). Thus, in general, it is a good idea to fi t binaural hearing 
aids whenever possible.
Enhanced hearing with two 
ears is called a binaural 
advantage.

552  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
Sometimes it is not possible to fi t binaural hearing aids effectively. 
This usually occurs when the difference in hearing between the 
two ears is substantial. In cases where both ears have hearing 
loss, but there is signifi cant asymmetry between ears, it is gener-
ally more appropriate to fi t a hearing aid on the better hearing 
ear than on the poorer hearing ear. The logic is that the bet-
ter hearing ear will perform better with amplifi cation than the 
poorer hearing ear. Thus, fi tting of the better ear will provide the 
best aided ability of either monaural fi tting. There are exceptions, 
of course, but they relate mostly to diffi cult confi gurations on the 
better hearing ear.
The extreme case of asymmetry is in the case of unilateral hear-
ing loss, with the other ear being normal. If the poorer ear can be 
effectively fi tted with a hearing aid, then obviously a monaural fi t-
ting is indicated. If the poorer ear cannot be effectively fi tted, then 
another option is to use an approach termed contralateral routing 
of signals (CROS). This approach uses a microphone and hearing 
aid on the poorer or nonhearing ear and delivers signals to the 
other ear either through bone conduction or via a receiving de-
vice worn on the normal hearing ear. Although this type of fi tting 
is rare, it is often used effectively on patients with profound unilat-
eral hearing loss due, for example, to a viral infection or second-
ary to surgery to remove an VIIIth nerve tumor.
Once the ear or ears have been determined, a decision must be 
made about the type of signal processing that will be used and the 
features that might be included in the hearing aids. This decision 
relates to the acoustic characteristics of the response of the hear-
ing aids and includes:
how much amplifi cation gain to provide in each frequency 
• 
range;
whether the amount of amplifi cation varies with the input 
• 
level of the sound;
what the maximum intensity level that the hearing aids can 
• 
generate will be;
how the maximum level will be limited;
• 
whether the hearing aids will have one setting or multiple 
• 
settings;

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  553
whether the hearing aid will have directional microphones 
• 
and what kind;
whether the aids will have feedback cancellation; and
• 
whether a t-coil or other wireless technology will be 
• 
included.
Once the signal processing strategy and features have been deter-
mined, a decision must be made about the style of hearing aids 
to be fi tted. In reality, the decisions might not be made in that or-
der. Some patients will insist on a particular style of hearing aid, 
which may limit some of the features that can be included. In the 
best of all worlds, however, the audiologist would decide on pro-
cessing strategy and features fi rst and let that dictate the potential 
styles. There are two general styles of conventional hearing aids. 
One type is the behind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aid. It hangs over the 
auricle and delivers sound to the ear in one of three ways. One is 
the use of a custom-made earmold, referred to as a closed-fi t tech-
nique. Another is through the use of a thin tube or other noncus-
tom coupler, referred to as an open-fi t technique. The third is also 
an open-fi t strategy, but in this case the receiver of the hearing aid 
is placed into the ear canal with a custom or noncustom coupler. 
It is referred to as the receiver-in-the-canal (RIC) fi tting. The other 
type is the in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aid. An ITE hearing aid has all 
of its components encased in a customized shell that fi ts into the 
ear. Subgroups of ITE hearing aids include in-the-canal (ITC) hear-
ing aids and completely-in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids. The deci-
sion about whether to choose an ITE or BTE hearing aid is related 
to several factors, including degree and confi guration of hearing 
loss and the physical size and limitations of the ear canal and au-
ricle. You will learn more about these devices and the challenges 
of fi tting them in Chapter 13.
As you can see, the audiologist has a number of decisions to make 
about the amplifi cation strategy and a number of patient factors 
to keep in mind while making those decisions. The experienced 
audiologist will approach all of these options in a very direct way. 
The audiologist will want to fi t the patient with two hearing aids 
with superior signal processing capability, maximum program-
mable fl exibility, and an array of features, in a style that is accept-
able to the patient at a price that the patient can afford. That is 

554  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
the audiologist’s goal and serves as the starting point in the fi tting 
process. The ultimate goal may then be altered by various patient 
factors until the best set of compromises can be reached.
Approaches to Fitting Hearing Instruments
Preselection of an amplification strategy, signal processing op-
tions, features, and hearing aid style is followed by the actual 
fitting of a device. There are a number of approaches to fitting 
hearing instruments, but most share some factors in common. 
Fitting of hearing instruments usually includes the following:
estimating an amplifi cation target for soft, moderate, and 
• 
loud sounds;
adjusting the hearing aid parameters to meet the targets;
• 
ensuring that soft sounds are audible;
• 
ensuring that discomfort levels are not exceeded;
• 
asking the patient to judge the quality or intelligibility of 
• 
amplifi ed speech; and
readjusting gain parameters as indicated.
• 
The fi rst general step in the fi tting process is to determine target 
gain. Gain is the amount of amplifi cation provided by the hearing 
aid and is specifi ed in decibels. Target gain is an estimate of how 
much amplifi cation will be needed at a given frequency for a given 
patient. The target is generated based on pure-tone audiometric 
thresholds and is calculated based on any number of gain rules 
that have been developed over the years. A simple example is a 
gain rule that has been used since 1944, known as the half-gain 
rule (see Lybarger, 1988). It stated that the target gain should be 
one-half of the number of decibels of hearing loss at a given fre-
quency, so that a hearing loss of 40 dB at 1000 Hz would require 
20 dB of hearing aid gain at that frequency. A number of such 
gain rules have been developed to assist in the preliminary setting 
of hearing aid gain.
Current hearing aid technology permits the setting and achieving 
of targets in much more sophisticated ways. The audiologist can 
now specify targets for soft sounds to ensure that they are audible, 
for moderate sounds to assure that they are comfortable, and for 

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  555
loud sounds to ensure that they are loud, but not uncomfortable. 
Many of these types of targets can be calculated from pure-tone 
air-conduction thresholds alone or in conjunction with loudness 
discomfort levels.
Once a target or targets have been determined by the audiologist, 
the hearing aids are adjusted in an attempt to match those tar-
gets. Typically, this is done by measuring the output of the hear-
ing aids in a hearing aid analyzer or in the patient’s ear canal. The 
gain of the hearing aids is then adjusted until the target is reached 
or approximated across the frequency range.
One important goal of fi tting hearing aids is to make soft sounds 
audible. Often in the fi tting process this will be assessed by deliv-
ering soft sounds to the hearing aids and measuring the amount 
of amplifi cation at the tympanic membrane or, more directly, by 
measuring the patient’s thresholds in the sound fi eld.
Another important goal of  fitting hearing aids is to keep loud 
sounds from being uncomfortable. Again, this can be assessed in-
directly by measuring the output of the hearing aids at the tym-
panic membrane to high-intensity sound. Or it can be assessed 
directly by delivering loud sounds to the patient and having the 
patient judge whether the sound is uncomfortably loud.
Once the parameters of the hearing aids have been adjusted to 
meet target gains, the patient’s response to speech targets is as-
sessed. This can be accomplished in a number of ways, some of 
which are formal and some informal. The general idea, however, 
is the same: to determine whether the quality of amplifi ed speech 
is judged to be acceptable and/or whether the extent to which 
speech is judged to be intelligible is acceptable. Should either be 
judged to be unacceptable, modifi cations are made in the hearing 
aid response.
Challenges in the fi tting of hearing aids are numerous. Specifi c 
approaches, gain targets, instrumentation used, and verifi cation 
techniques can vary from clinic to clinic or from audiologist to au-
diologist within a clinic. The goal, however, is usually the same: to 
deliver good sound quality and maximize speech intelligibility.

556  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
Approaches to Defining Success
With so many hearing aid options and so many different fi tting 
strategies, one of the audiologists’ biggest challenges is knowing 
when they got it right. That is, how does the audiologist know that 
the fi tting was successful, and against what standards is it judged 
to be good enough?
Defining hearing aid success has been a challenging and elusive 
goal for many years. In the early years, when type of hearing aid 
and circuit selection were limited to a very few choices, the ques-
tion was often simply of a yes or no variety—yes, it helps, or no, it 
doesn’t. Today, there are so many options that validation of the ones 
chosen is much more diffi cult. In general, there are two approaches 
to verifying the hearing aid selection and fi tting procedures:
self-assessment outcome measures and,
• 
to a lesser extent, measurement of aided performance.
• 
One important method for defining amplification success is the 
use of self-assessment scales. Examples were described earlier in 
this chapter. One or more of these measures is usually given to the 
patient prior to hearing aid fi tting and then again at some later 
date after the patient has had time to adjust to using the hearing 
aids. The goal is to ensure that the patient is provided with some 
expected level of benefi t from the devices. Self-assessment mea-
sures are now used extensively as a means of judging clinical out-
comes of hearing aid fi tting.
Another approach is to measure aided performance directly. This 
can be done with aided speech-recognition measures to assess 
the patient’s ability to recognize speech targets with and with-
out hearing aids. These measures are typically presented in the 
presence of background competition in an effort to mimic real-
life listening situations. The goal of carrying out aided speech-
recognition testing is to ensure that the patient is provided some 
expected level of performance. These measures can also be used if 
there is an issue about the potential benefi ts of monaural versus 
binaural amplification fitting. Another approach is to measure 
sensitivity thresholds in the soundfi eld with and without hearing 
aids. The difference in threshold is known as the functional gain of 
the hearing aid.

CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT  557
Treatment Planning
The fi tting of hearing aids is the fi rst component of the treatment 
plan. The process attempts to address the fi rst goal, that of maxi-
mizing the use of residual hearing. From that point, the audiolo-
gist is challenged to determine the benefit of the amplification 
and, if it is inadequate, to plan additional intervention strategies. 
In all cases, the audiologist must convey to patients and families 
the importance of understanding the nature of hearing impair-
ment and the benefi ts and limitations of hearing aids.
The need for and the nature of additional intervention strategies 
are usually not a refl ection of the adequacy of the initial amplifi ca-
tion fi tting. Rather, needs vary considerably, depending on patient 
factors such as age, communication demands, and degree of loss.
Many patients do not require additional treatment. Theirs is a sen-
sory loss, the hearing aids ameliorated the effects of that loss, and 
their only ongoing needs are related to periodic reevaluations.
For other patients, the fi tting of hearing aids simply constitutes 
the beginning of a long process of habilitation or rehabilitation. 
Children may need intensive language stimulation programs, 
classroom assistive technology, and speech therapy. Adults may 
need aural rehabilitation, speechreading classes, telephone ampli-
fi ers, and other assistive technology.
Summary
The fundamental goal of audiologic management is to limit the 
• 
extent of any communication disorder that results from a hear-
ing loss.
The first step in reaching that goal is to maximize the use of 
• 
residual hearing, usually by the introduction of hearing aid 
amplifi cation.
If  a patient has a sensorineural hearing impairment that is 
• 
causing a communication disorder, the patient is a candidate 
for amplifi cation.
The goal of the assessment is to determine candidacy for audio-
• 
logic management.

558  CHAPTER 12  INTRODUCTION TO AUDIOLOGIC MANAGEMENT
The treatment assessment determines the self-perception and 
• 
family-perception of communication needs and function; the 
patient’s physical, psychological, and sociological status; and 
the sufficiency of human and financial resources to support 
hearing treatment.
The first step in the rehabilitative process is to determine 
• 
whether the patient is likely to benefi t from amplifi cation.
Patient factors, including hearing impairment, medical condi-
• 
tion, physical ability, and cognitive capacity, impact the deci-
sions made about amplifi cation alternatives.
Preselection of amplifi cation includes decisions about type of 
• 
amplification system, signal processing strategy, hearing aid 
features, and device style.
Fitting of hearing instruments usually includes estimation of 
• 
amplifi cation targets, adjustment of hearing aid parameters to 
meet those targets, and verifi cation of hearing aid performance 
and benefi t.
Many patients do not require additional treatment; for others, 
• 
hearing aid fitting is only the beginning of the rehabilitative 
process.
Short Answer Questions
 1. The goal for audiologic treatment is to limit the extent 
of any 
 disorder that results from a hear-
ing loss. This fi rst involves maximizing the use of any 
 hearing and then proceeding with some form

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  563
Hearing instrument technology advances at a rapid pace. To-
day’s hearing instruments use digital signal processing, provide 
high fidelity sound reproduction, have adaptive directionality 
and feedback control, have low battery drain, and are readily pro-
grammable, providing tremendous fl exibility for precise fi tting (for 
a complete review, see Dillon, 2002; Valente et al., 2008).
Some aspects of hearing aids have not changed over the years. 
There is still a microphone to convert acoustical energy to elec-
trical energy, an amplifi er to boost the energy, and a receiver or 
loudspeaker to turn the signal back from electrical to acoustical 
energy. We still discuss the output of a hearing aid in terms of the 
amplifi cation or gain that is provided across the frequency range 
and the maximum level of sound that is delivered to the ear. Simi-
larities to past technology end there, however, as many of the old 
rules have changed or are changing.
If you were a student in the not-so-distant past, you would prob-
ably learn about antiquities such as body-worn hearing aids and 
eye-glass hearing aids. Now you might see these instruments in 
a hearing-aid museum. Today when you look at a picture of an in-
the-ear (ITE) hearing aid, you may be looking at the next addition 
to that museum.
The burgeoning technological advances can make it difficult 
for beginning students to appreciate some of  the challenges 
A body-worn hearing 
aid has its components 
encosed in a small box worn 
on the chest with a cord 
connected to a receiver worn 
on the ear.
Eye-glass hearing aids 
were an were an early style 
of hearing aid in which the 
microphone and ampliﬁ er 
were built into one or both 
sides of the eyeglass frames 
with earmolds attached.

acoustic response characteristics of hearing 
aids, including frequency gain character-
istics, input-output characteristics, output

audiologists have faced over the years in the fi tting of hearing aids. 
When you look at a picture of an ITE hearing aid today, it may not 
look much different than it did 5 years ago, but its capacity has 
advanced remarkably in even that short a period of time.
One way to view the advances in amplification is in terms of the 
technology pyramid shown in Figure 13-1. At the bottom of the 
pyramid is standard technology with something called linear ampli-
fi cation and simple output limiting. Linear amplifi cation means that 
soft, medium, and loud sounds are all amplifi ed to the same extent. 
Output limiting is the way that the maximum output is capped. The 
next step up the pyramid is miniaturization. This has allowed even 
the most sophisticated signal processing circuits to be fi tted into a 
completely-in-the-canal (CIC) style of hearing aid. Above that is pro-
grammable technology, which provides extremely fl exible control of

different response parameters for different listening situations.
The next step up the pyramid is digital and directional tech-
nology. The change to digital processing brought tremendous 
advances in nonlinear ampliﬁ cation, output limiting, noise re-
duction, and feedback control, all with reduced power consump-
tion and signal distortion.
Digital signal processing permits the use of all technologies in the 
pyramid in a very fl exible manner, in a small package, to meet the 
needs of patients. Directional microphones allow hearing aids to 
focus in space by enhancing signals in front and reducing those 
coming from behind. Although an old concept, enhancement in 
technology made directionality a very useful reality. The next step 
up the pyramid is a burgeoning strategy of providing a more open 
fi tting of hearing aids to reduce the occluding effects of hearing 
aids and provide a more natural sounding amplifi cation, especially 
to those with high-frequency hearing loss. Here, instead of block-
ing the ear canal with an earmold or in-the-ear hearing aid, sound 
is delivered through thin tubing that is coupled to the ear canal in 
a more open fashion. In some cases the hearing aid’s loudspeaker 
has also been moved to the ear canal. Like directional technology, 
the idea comes from down low on the pyramid, but its routine ap-
plication was made possible by technological enhancement.
At the top of today’s hearing aid pyramid is the growing opportu-
nity for wireless connectivity of hearing aids, permitting commu-
nication from one hearing aid to another and from both hearing 
aids to other electronic devices and signal sources.
In this chapter, you will learn about the fundamental character-
istics of hearing aids and about some of the current signal pro-
cessing strategies. You will also learn about hearing assistive 
technology, which is often used to supplement conventional am-
plifi cation, and cochlear implants, which are the devices of choice 
for many patients with severe and profound hearing loss. Armed 
with a basic understanding, you should be able to appreciate the 
technological advances as they emerge into the reality of com-
mercially available hearing instruments.
Nonlinear ampliﬁ cation 
usually means that soft 
sounds are ampliﬁ ed more 
than loud sounds.

HEARING INSTRUMENT COMPONENTS
A hearing aid is an electronic amplifier that has three main 
components:
 1. a microphone,
 2. an amplifi er, and
 3. a loudspeaker.
A schematic of the basic components is shown in Figure 13-2. 
The microphone is a vibrator that moves in response to the pres-
sure waves of sound. As it moves, it converts the acoustical signal 
into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is boosted by the am-
plifi er and then delivered to the loudspeaker. The loudspeaker then 
converts the electrical signal back into an acoustical signal to be 
delivered to the ear. Power is supplied to the amplifi er by a battery, 
which in some cases is rechargeable. Most hearing aids have some 
form of external control, usually a volume control, and some have 
a remote control.
Microphone and Other Input Technology
A microphone is a transducer that changes acoustical energy 
into electrical energy. A microphone is essentially a thin 
membrane that vibrates in response to the wave of compression 
and expansion of air molecules emanating from a sound source. 
As the membrane of the microphone vibrates, it creates electrical 
energy flow that corresponds to the amplitude, frequency, and 
phase of  the acoustic signal. This energy is then preamplified 
before it is fi ltered.

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  567
Conventional hearing devices use an omnidirectional microphone. 
An omnidirectional microphone provides wide-angle reception of 
acoustic signals. That is, it is sensitive to sound coming from many 
directions. Think about the tympanic membrane as our natural 
microphone. Because of its location, it benefi ts from the acoustic 
characteristics of the pinna, concha, and ear canal, all of which are 
important in spatial hearing, or localizing sound sources in space. 
Imagine that when we place a hearing aid in the ear canal or we 
hang it over the ear, we are moving that natural microphone from 
the eardrum to the side of the head, thereby reducing the spatial 
cues of the outer ear. In an effort to compensate for this, a direc-
tional microphone, which has a more focused fi eld, is often substi-
tuted for the omnidirectional microphone. The purpose of using a 
directional microphone is to focus its sensitivity toward the front of 
the listener, thereby attenuating or reducing unwanted “noise” or 
competition emanating from behind the listener.
Microphone technology has also been designed that provides the 
capability of both directional and omnidirectional microphone 
reception in the same hearing device. This is accomplished by us-
ing two microphones in the same hearing aid. In some devices, 
the microphone can be switched from omnidirectional to direc-
tional with a control on the hearing aid or by remote control. The 
sophistication of directional microphones has changed dramati-
cally. The switching from omnidirectional to directional can now 
occur automatically and adaptively, so that the directionality is 
activated when the hearing aid senses background noise and 
changes the amount of directionality based on the extent of the 
noise (see, for example, Ricketts et al., 2005). Directional micro-
phones are a feature of  hearing aids designed to help patients 
hear in noisy environments.
There are also other ways that sound can be input into the ampli-
fi er of a hearing aid besides the conventional microphone. The idea 
here is to bypass the environmental microphone to deliver a signal 
directly to the hearing aid. One of the most basic techniques is di-
rect audio input (DAI). DAI is just as it sounds; sound from some 
source is input into the hearing aid directly via a wire connector or 
“boot” that connects to a BTE hearing aid. Although still available, 
more modern strategies use some form of wireless technology.
An omnidirectional 
microphone is sensitive to 
sounds from all directions.
A directional 
microphone focuses on 
sounds in front of a person.

568  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
One of the most common forms of alternative input technology 
is the telecoil or t-coil. A telecoil allows the hearing aid to pick up 
electromagnetic signals directly, bypassing the hearing aid micro-
phone. This allows for direct input from devices such as telephones 
receivers, thus the name telecoil. In addition to telephone signals, 
a t-coil can also pick up signals from other sources that are used 
for remote-microphone strategies. You will learn more about re-
mote microphones later in this chapter. A remote microphone is 
simply that, a microphone that is used by a talker, for example a 
teacher in a classroom. The signal from that remote microphone 
is then transmitted in some form to a loop of wire that then trans-
mits the signal electromagnetically to the t-coil of the hearing 
aid. A telecoil can be activated by a switch on the hearing aid, by 
remote control, or automatically when the hearing aid senses an 
electromagnetic fi eld. Today, when a patient holds a telephone up 
to a hearing aid, the hearing aid can automatically switch from the 
environmental microphone to the telecoil, thereby enhancing the 
sound from the telephone and eliminating the acoustic signals 
that would then be background noise.
A hearing aid may also have some other form of wireless receiver, 
such as a frequency-modulated (FM) receiver or other more mod-
ern wireless connectivity. An FM receiver can be built into a hear-
ing aid or attached as a boot on a BTE hearing aid. The FM receiver 
acts like an FM radio, receiving signals from a transmitter and 
directing them to the amplifi er of the hearing aid. Increasingly, 
modern hearing aids are equipped with other wireless connectiv-
ity solutions so that the hearing aid amplifi er can receive signals 
directly from mobile phones, computers, personal music players, 
and so on.
Amplifier
The heart of a hearing aid is its power amplifier. The amplifier 
boosts the level of the electrical signal that is delivered to the hear-
ing aid’s loudspeaker. The amplifi er controls how much amplifi -
cation occurs at certain frequencies. The amplifier can also be 
designed to differentially boost higher or lower intensity sounds. 
It also contains some type of limiting devices so that it does not 
deliver too much sound to the ear.

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  569
Most patients have more hearing loss at some frequencies than 
at others. As you might imagine, it is important to provide more 
amplifi cation at frequencies with more hearing loss and less am-
plifi cation at frequencies with less loss. Thus, hearing aids contain 
a fi ltering system, which is adjustable, that permits the “shaping” 
of frequency response to match the confi guration of hearing loss.
An example of  the effects of  shaping or filtering is shown in 
Figure 13-3. Here, the response of  the hearing aid varies as a 
function of the filter settings on the hearing aid. When little fil-
tering is used, the response of the device is relatively flat across 
the frequency range. When high-pass fi ltering is used (to pass the 
highs and cut the lows), the response of the hearing aid shows 
little amplification in the low frequencies and relatively greater 
amplification in the high frequencies.

570  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
An amplifi er can be designed to provide linear amplifi cation or 
nonlinear amplification. Linear amplification means that the 
same amount of  amplification, or gain, is applied to an input 
signal regardless of the intensity level of that signal. That is, if 
the gain of the amplifi er is, say, 20 dB, then a linear amplifi er will 
increase an input signal of 40 dB to 60 dB, an input of 50 dB to 
70 dB, an input of 60 dB to 80 dB, and so on. This relationship 
is shown in Figure 13-4. Nonlinear amplifi cation means that the 
amount of gain is different for different input levels. For example, 
a nonlinear amplifi er might boost a 30 dB signal to 65 dB, but 
a 70 dB signal to only 80 dB. This relationship is shown in 
Figure 13-5. The vast majority of modern hearing aids provide 
predominantly nonlinear gain.
An amplifier also contains circuitry that limits its output. In 
the early days of  hearing aids, the output was limited by sim-
ply putting a lid on it and not letting peaks of  signals exceed 
a certain  predetermined level. This output limiting technique,

known as peak clipping, is shown schematically in Figure 13-6. 
Current technology uses compression limiting. Here, the ampli-
fier is designed to become nonlinear as input signals reach a 
certain level, so that the amount of  gain is diminished signifi -
cantly at the maximum output level. This compression limiting 
technique is shown schematically in Figure 13-7. Compression

limiting introduces less distortion than peak clipping and has 
become the standard method of output limiting.
Modern hearing aid amplifi ers have frequency responses with a 
wide and smooth bandwidth. That is, the upper frequency limit 
is extended into high frequencies, and the amplifier provides a 
relatively smooth or constant output across the frequency range. 
The wider and smoother the aid’s frequency response is, the 
better the fi delity of signal reproduction and the better a person 
wearing the device will understand speech. In most patients, 
sensorineural hearing loss is greater in the higher frequencies. It 
is in these higher frequencies that consonant sounds, which carry 
so much of the meaning of speech, have most of their acoustic 
energy. In the early days of hearing aids, amplifi ers had limited 
capacity for boosting the higher frequencies of speech that are 
so critical for its perception. Problems arose due to an inability 
to reduce distortion in the amplifi cation of the high frequencies. 
This distortion made it difficult for hearing-device wearers to 
tolerate high-level speech or music, and there was a tendency to 
limit high-frequency amplifi cation, thereby sacrifi cing fi delity for 
tolerability. Much of the diffi culty in extending amplifi cation to 
the high frequencies without distortion related not to amplifi er 
limitations, but to the need to drive the amplifi ers with low-power 
batteries. To obtain reasonable battery life, amplifi ers were altered 
in ways that also exaggerated distortion. Enhancements in 
amplifi er technology now permit high-fi delity signal reproduction 
of the high-frequency range of amplifi cation without excessive 
power drain.

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  573
Receiver
The amplifier of  a hearing aid delivers its electrical signal to a 
receiver, or loudspeaker. The loudspeaker is a transducer that 
changes electrical energy back into acoustical energy. That is, it 
acts in the opposite direction of a microphone.
The loudspeaker is also an important component of  a hearing 
aid. Think for a moment what a good, high-fi delity stereo system 
sounds like when you are playing your favorite music through 
very good headphones or speakers. Now imagine what it would be 
like if you were to replace your good speakers with cheap ones. It 
would certainly be a waste of a good amplifi er.
The receiver, or loudspeaker, of a hearing aid must have a broad, 
fl at frequency response in order to accurately reproduce the sig-
nals being processed by the hearing aid amplifi er.
Controls
The various parameters of a hearing aid amplifi er are manipulated 
by software control. Older hearing aids had hardware controls, 
such as dials, switches, and potentiometers. Modern hearing 
aids usually have a hardware volume control and often a control 
for switching memory programs. Other parameters are adjustable 
by remote control or by computer-based software control.
A hearing aid amplifi er has a general response curve that charac-
terizes the circuit. This response curve can be manipulated, usu-
ally to reduce or enhance the low- and/or high-frequency range. 
Thus, a given hearing aid amplifier is capable of producing re-
sponses over a generalized range. From this range, projections are 
made as to the degrees and confi gurations of hearing losses that 
can be fi tted with the circuit. This is called a fi tting range. An ex-
ample is shown in Figure 13-8. The audiologist uses this kind of 
fi tting range to determine the potential appropriateness of the cir-
cuit for a patient’s audiogram. Under software control, the audi-
ologist then manipulates the response curve to match that needed 
for the patient’s hearing sensitivity.
Newer hearing aid circuits have a more generic frequency re-
sponse that can be controlled extensively. The response within a 
range can be adjusted to vary signifi cantly.
A potentiometer is a 
resistor connected across 
a voltage that permits 
variable change of a current 
or circuit. On a hearing aid, 
it is a small dial that can 
be rotated to change some 
parameter of the response.

574  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
Manual Control
A conventional hearing aid will usually have one or two controls 
that the patient can manipulate. Controls usually include a 
volume or gain control and a switch to control on-off  and/or 
memory selection.

gain to a power hearing device.

On-off  switches and volume controls can take many forms on 
a hearing aid. The classic on-off  switch is the MTO switch, 
and the classic volume control is a rotating wheel, as shown in 
Figure 13-9. The MTO switch stands for Microphone, Telecoil, 
Off. Microphone means on; telecoil means that the microphone 
is turned off  and that the telecoil of  a hearing aid is activated 
to pick up signals from a telephone or other electromagnetic 
transducer; off means off. If  a hearing aid does not have a 
telecoil, then the control is an M-O switch. In some hearing 
aids, the on-off  switch is contained as part of  the volume 
control wheel.
Modern hearing aids use a push button or other type of switch for 
changing settings, such as the t-coil or other memory options.
MTO means: 
M = microphone, 
T = telephone, and
O = off.

576  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
Programmable Control
Hearing aids are either completely digital in their control paths 
or have analog processing that is under digital control, allowing 
them to be programmable, or manipulable under computer control. 
Under such computer control, the response parameters of a hear-
ing device can be manipulated with fl exibility and relative ease. 
In some cases, the programming unit is a proprietary, stand-
alone instrument, but in most cases, it is one that can be used for 
various makes of hearing devices and is controlled by proprietary 
computer software. A software platform known as Noah has be-
come a standard interface for programming hearing aids. Hear-
ing aid manufacturers provide proprietary software based on this 
platform to permit programming of their particular devices.
Sophistication of programmable hearing devices varies substan-
tially. In its simplest form, a programmable hearing device is little 
more than a conventional linear hearing aid that allows computer 
control over variables that were formerly controlled by potenti-
ometers and screwdrivers. The most sophisticated programmable 
device has numerous frequency channels with nonlinear com-
pression circuitry that can be adjusted in all or some of the chan-
nels as well as several memories for storing responses programmed 
for different listening situations.
Programmability of modern hearing instruments provides sev-
eral benefi ts that lead to improved fi tting capability. Because the 
electroacoustic parameters of a programmable device can be ma-
nipulated over a fairly broad range at the time of fi tting, manu-
facturers can produce instruments in a one-size-fi ts-all manner. 
Flexibility and precision of electroacoustic adjustments can be 
made to fi t an individual’s particular hearing loss confi guration. 
All of these adjustments are made at the time of the fi tting or dur-
ing follow-up appointments in a manner that provides appropri-
ate amplifi cation for a patient.
Most hearing instruments have acoustic parameters that can be 
manipulated over a wide range, permitting gain and output modi-
fi cations as hearing loss progresses or fl uctuates. This is particu-
larly useful in fi tting young children whose hearing ability may 
not be precisely quantifi ed at the time of the initial evaluation.

such as a hearing instrument 
manufacturer.
A channel is a frequency 
region that is processed 
independently of other 
regions. 

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  577
Most hearing aids also have multiple memories that contain differ-
ent acoustic responses. For example, one response may be appropri-
ate for a certain acoustic environment such as telephone use, but 
inappropriate for listening in a noisy environment. Multiple memo-
ries make both responses available in the same hearing device.
ELECTROACOUSTIC CHARACTERISTICS
The acoustic response characteristics of hearing aids are described 
in terms of frequency gain, input-output, and output limiting. 
Gain of the hearing aid is the amount of sound that is added to 
the input signal. If a speech signal enters the hearing aid at 50 dB 
and is amplifi ed to 90 dB, the amount of gain is 40 dB. The fre-
quency gain response of a hearing aid is the amount of gain as a 
function of frequency. Because most hearing losses are greater at 
some frequencies than at others, the ability to manipulate gain se-
lectively in different frequency regions is important. Input-output 
characteristic of a hearing aid is the amount of gain as a function 
of the input intensity level. The input-output function can be lin-
ear or nonlinear. Output limiting refers to the maximum intensity 
of the amplifi ed signal. If a signal of 100 dB were delivered to a 
hearing aid that had 40 dB of gain, without a limiting circuit, the 
output would be 140 dB. Such a high-intensity signal would not 
only be intolerable, but would be damaging to the cochlea, so it 
is necessary to limit the maximum intensity level the hearing aid 
can generate.
Frequency Gain Characteristics
The most recognizable “signature” of a hearing aid is its frequency 
response. A frequency response curve is a graphic representation 
of the amplifi cation characteristics of a hearing aid in decibels as a 
function of frequency. It is determined by delivering to the hearing 
aid a signal at a fi xed-intensity level across the frequency range. 
Figure 13-10 illustrates the frequency response of a hearing aid.
The frequency response of a hearing aid is a standard that is used to 
describe its amplifi cation characteristics. Often, the fi rst step taken 
by an audiologist after receiving a hearing aid from the manufac-
turer is to evaluate the frequency response of the device on a hear-
ing aid analyzer to ensure that it meets specifi cations.

578  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
The frequency response curve provides information about the 
 absolute response of a hearing aid. Although important in describ-
ing the performance of an aid, we are usually more interested in the 
relative response of a hearing aid, or how much amplifi cation was 
added at each frequency by the hearing aid. The most common way 
of describing this relative response is by a frequency gain curve. The 
term gain refers to the magnitude of amplifi cation of sound by a 
hearing aid. In other words, gain represents how much the sound is 
boosted by the hearing aid amplifi er. A frequency gain response is a 
graph of the gain produced by a hearing aid to a specifi ed intensity 
level of a signal presented across the frequency range. Thus, it is a 
picture of the difference between the intensity level of the output of 
the hearing aid and the intensity level of the input. An example of a 
frequency gain response is shown in Figure 13-11.
The frequency gain characteristics are important to the audiolo-
gist in the hearing aid fi tting process. Most of the methods used 
for prescribing a hearing aid are based on providing a specified 
amount of gain at a given frequency, based on a patient’s pure-
tone audiogram. Thus, the audiologist is usually more interested 
Gain is the amount, 
expressed in dB, by which 
the output level exceeds the 
input level.

in knowing the amount of gain provided to a given input level 
than the decibel level of the device’s output.
Input-Output Characteristics
A frequency gain response provides information about the amount 
of gain produced for a given input intensity level. Now suppose 
you were interested in knowing the response at various input in-
tensity levels. Figure 13-12 shows frequency response curves to 
signals presented at several intensity levels. If you were to take a 
single frequency and plot the output intensity level as a function 
of the input intensity level, you would have an input-output func-
tion of the hearing aid at a specifi ed frequency.
The input-output characteristics of a hearing aid are important be-
cause they describe how a hearing aid functions at different inten-
sity levels. That is, they tell us how many decibels the amplifi cation 
increases with an increase in the input signal. For some hearing 
aids, this input-output relationship is a simple matter of a 1 dB in-
crease in output for every 1 dB increase in input until the hearing 
aid’s maximum level is reached. This is called a linear input-output 
relationship. For most hearing aids the input-output relationship 
changes throughout the intensity range in a nonlinear manner.

Linear Ampliﬁ cation
Linear amplification means that the relationship between input 
and output is proportional, so that low-intensity sounds are ampli-
fi ed to the same extent as high-intensity sounds. An example of a 
linear input-output function was shown previously in Figure 13-4. 
Here, for every dB increase in the input, there is a corresponding 
dB increase in the output.
Fitting of linear amplifi cation was a fairly standard approach in 
the early years of hearing aids and remains applicable for conduc-
tive hearing loss and some mild sensorineural hearing loss.
A problem with this type of linear amplifi cation is that it does not 
address the nonlinearity of loudness growth that occurs with sen-
sorineural hearing impairment. You will recall from Chapter 3 that 
many patients with sensorineural hearing loss do not hear soft 
sounds, but can hear loud sounds normally. A linear device amplifi es 
both soft and loud sounds identically. As a result, if a low-intensity 
sound is made loud enough to be audible, a high-intensity sound is

likely to be made too loud for the listener. This idea is shown sche-
matically in Figure 13-13.
Nonlinear Ampliﬁ cation
Nonlinear amplifi cation means that the relationship between input 
and output is not proportional, so that, for example, low-intensity 
sounds are amplifi ed to a greater extent than high-intensity sounds. 
An example of  a nonlinear input-output function was shown 
previously in Figure 13-5.
Nonlinear amplifi cation is achieved with something called com-
pression circuitry. Compression is a term that is used to describe 
how the amplifi cation of a signal is reduced as a function of its 
intensity. Compression techniques are used both to limit the maxi-
mum output of a hearing aid and to provide nonlinear amplifi ca-
tion across a wide range of inputs.
Wide-range nonlinear amplification is designed to “package” 
speech into a listener’s residual dynamic range. Dynamic range, 
in this case, is a term used to describe the decibel difference be-
tween the level of a person’s threshold of hearing sensitivity and 
FIGURE 13-13 Schematic representation of loudness as a function of

ral hearing loss. A linear hearing aid ampliﬁ es both

the level that causes discomfort. In a normal-hearing person, that 
range is from 0 dB HL to about 100 dB HL. In a patient with a 
sensorineural hearing loss, that range is reduced. For example, a 
patient with a 50 dB hearing loss and a discomfort level of 100 dB 
has a dynamic range of only 50 dB. Compression circuitry used 
in nonlinear amplifi cation is designed to fi t speech signals into 
this reduced dynamic range. The idea is to boost the gain of low-
intensity sounds so that they are audible but to limit the gain of 
high-intensity sounds so that they are not uncomfortable. The 
term dynamic range compression has been used to describe this 
nonlinear amplification process because it is meant to provide 
compression throughout a patient’s range of useable hearing.
The need for nonlinear amplifi cation is based on the knowledge 
that sensorineural hearing loss results in a reduced dynamic range 
and also on the knowledge that the loudness growth function in 
that ear is different from a normal ear. Again, the loudness growth 
of an ear with sensorineural hearing loss can be nonlinear, and 
the linearity may differ as a function of frequency. For example, 
our patient with the 50 dB hearing loss hears  moderate-
intensity sounds at reduced loudness but hears high-intensity 
sounds at normal loudness. A linear hearing aid amplifies all 
sounds to the same extent, so that low-intensity sounds become 
audible, moderate sounds become louder than desired, and high-
intensity sounds become intolerable. Nonlinear, dynamic-range 
compression devices, in contrast, are designed in various ways 
to account for the nonlinear nature of loudness growth resulting 
from hearing impairment. Figure 13-14 illustrates the difference 
between linear compression and dynamic-range compression as 
it relates to an ear with sensorineural hearing loss and nonlinear 
loudness growth.
A number of  nonlinear compression strategies have been de-
veloped to address the dynamic-range issue, and they vary in 
their approach and complexity. Some strategies are designed 
to provide compression over part of the dynamic range. Partial 
dynamic-range compression typically provides linear amplifi ca-
tion for low input signals and some level of  compression once 
the input reaches a certain level. Other strategies are designed to 
provide compression over a wider portion of the dynamic range. 

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  583
Wide dynamic-range compression has as its basis the enhanced 
amplification of  quiet sounds and relatively reduced amplifi-
cation of  loud sounds. A person with a sensorineural hearing 
loss cannot hear soft sounds; therefore, these sounds need to be 
amplifi ed. In contrast, at high levels, hearing may be essentially 
normal, and no amplifi cation is needed. Thus, gain is high for 
low-level sounds and low for high-level sounds. These changes 
in gain are gradual enough throughout the dynamic range that 
they cannot be perceived by the listener. The overall effect is to 
make soft sounds audible, moderate sounds comfortable, and 
loud sounds loud, but not too loud.

584  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
For most systems, dynamic-range compression can be altered in 
multiple frequency bands. In this way, if a patient’s dynamic range 
is reduced in one frequency range and nearly normal in another, 
the compression can be tailored to the frequency band where it is 
needed, and the other band can act as more of a linear amplifi er.
Output Limiting
It is important that the output level of a hearing aid be limited 
to some maximum because high-intensity sounds can be both 
damaging to the ear and uncomfortable to the listener. Output 
limiting strategies are of  two general types, peak clipping and 
compression limiting.
Peak Clipping
Peak clipping was a common early technique used to limit output. 
Peak clipping removes the extremes of alternating current ampli-
tude peaks at some predetermined level. A schematic representa-
tion of this output limiting technique was shown previously in 
Figure 13-6.
Although peak clipping was effective in limiting hearing aid 
output, it produced substantial distortion when saturation was 
reached at high input levels. An alternative method is the use of 
compression to limit output in a more gradual manner.
Compression Limiting
Compression circuitry was developed in response to limitations in-
herent in peak clipping. A schematic representation of this output 
limiting technique was shown previously in Figure 13-7.
Many terms are used to describe compression, and it is not always 
easy to sort them out. One of the older terms used is automatic 
gain control, or AGC. AGC is used to describe both partial dynamic-
range compression and output limiting compression.
The difference in these two types of compression strategies is in 
the threshold of activation, range over which compression occurs, 
ratio of input to output, and attack and release time.
Most compression parameters are adjustable, and some are auto-
matically adjustable. The result is that compression limiting, and 
Saturation is the level in 
an ampliﬁ er circuit at which 
an increase in the input 
signal no longer produces 
additional output.
Attack time is the 
amount of time it takes for 
compression to engage.
Release time is the 
amount of time it takes for 
compression to disengage.

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  585
compression in general, can be implemented in a fl exible manner 
that allows patients to benefi t from its effects without perception 
of its activation and functioning.
Signal Processing
Sophisticated, high-fi delity electronic processing of acoustic sig-
nals is commonplace in modern hearing aids. Hearing aids have 
progressed over the past decade from analog, to digitally con-
trolled analog, to digital signal processing.
In analog hearing aids, acoustic signals followed an analog path 
that was under analog control. In digitally controlled analog 
(DCA) hearing aids, acoustic signals followed an analog path 
that was under digital control. In digital signal processing (DSP) 
hearing aids, acoustic signals are converted from analog to digi-
tal and back again, with digital control over various amplifi cation 
parameters.
Modern hearing aids use DSP. The conversion from analog to digi-
tal occurred rapidly over the past few years but is now complete. 
Patients may still own older hearing aids that have analog pro-
cessing, and any analog hearing aids that are still being made are 
likely to be digitally controlled, so it is of value for you to have a 
general understanding of the differences and the progression.
Analog was the predominant signal processing strategy used in 
hearing aids from their inception until recently. The term analog 
means that a signal is processed in a manner that is continuously 
varying over time. It is used in contrast to the term digital, in which a 
signal is represented as discrete numeric values at discrete moments 
in time. A waveform represented in analog and digital form is 
shown in Figure 13-15. The term analog hearing aid is a neologism 
that was created to describe conventional hearing aids when digital 
processing was introduced.
In analog processing, an acoustical signal was converted by a 
microphone into electrical energy in a continuously variable 
manner. The energy was fi ltered, amplifi ed, and delivered to the 
hearing aid loudspeaker. Controls were mostly analog as well; for 
example, the volume or gain control provided adjustment along 
an uninterrupted continuum.
Neologism means a new 
word or a new meaning for 
an established word.

586  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
Analog signal processing was refi ned to deliver amplifi ed signals 
with high fi delity and low distortion and to incorporate sophisti-
cated compression-limiting and nonlinear dynamic-range com-
pression circuitry.
There was a brief interim period of time before DSP became com-
monplace that a hybrid strategy was used, wherein analog signal 
processing was used for amplification, with digital control over 
the amplifi cation parameters. Here, the acoustical-to-electrical-
to-acoustical fl ow of energy was identical to the analog hearing 
aid. The difference was that adjustments to the frequency gain 
response, compression parameters, and other electroacoustic pa-
rameters were made under digital control.
The main advantage that digital control brought was the fl exibil-
ity that resulted from the ability to program the devices. Digital 
control permited fi ne tuning of a hearing aid remotely via an in-
terface that communicated with a personal computer or dedicated 
hearing aid programmer. As a result, fi ne adjustments could be 
made to the electroacoustic parameters of the hearing aid in real 
time while the patient was wearing the device.
In addition to a greater range of control, digital processing permit-
ted a greater number of controls than the analog predecessor, so 
that gain control, frequency response, compression parameters,

output limiting, and other characteristics were under software 
rather than hardware control. Analog instruments, in contrast, 
were limited by size as to how many of these controls could be in-
cluded in a single device.
The fi rst commercially available DSP hearing aid was marketed 
in the late 1980s. However, due to size of  the device, battery 
consumption, and other technological constraints of  the time, 
the device did not gain widespread acceptance. During the same 
period, DCA devices were introduced, and their use became 
fairly routine.
In the latter part of the 1990s, DSP hearing aids were once again 
introduced to the market. This time, the design of the integrated 
circuit met the challenges of being small enough to fi t in an ear-
level hearing aid and having low enough power consumption to 
be practical.
A DSP hearing aid is different from an analog or DCA hearing 
aid in that the analog signals from the microphone are converted 
into digital form by an analog-to-digital converter. Once in digi-
tal form, the signals are manipulated by sophisticated processing 
algorithms and then converted back to analog form by digital-to-
analog conversion. A schematic of a modern hearing aid is shown 
in Figure 13-16.

588  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
Digital signal processing eliminated many of the barriers faced in 
trying to design analog circuits to fi t in a small hearing aid and 
run on low-powered batteries. Indeed, the degree of sophistication 
of signal processing that is used in modern hearing aids is limited 
only by our conceptual framework of how hearing aid amplifi ca-
tion should work.
The clinical value of real-time digital processing for achieving 
appropriate sound reproduction through a hearing aid became 
apparent quickly. Along with fl exibility inherent in enhanced pro-
grammability, modern devices provide more precise and fl exible 
frequency shaping, more sophisticated compression algorithms, 
better acoustic feedback reduction, and enhanced noise reduction 
algorithms (e.g. Kates, 2008).
Other Processing Features
Today’s hearing aids include at least three electroacoustic fea-
tures that make an important contribution to successful hearing 
aid fi tting:
 1. directionality,
 2. noise reduction, and
 3. feedback reduction.
We have already discussed directionality in terms of the use of two 
or more microphones. The actual hardware arrangement of these 
microphones allows for comparison of signals from the front and 
back. Under software control, decisions can be made about the 
strength and nature of sounds in front of and behind the patient, 
and the sensitivity of the microphones can be adjusted accordingly. 
As an example, if a patient is in a quiet environment, the aid can be 
programmed to be omnidirectional. When there is noise in the back-
ground, the relative sensitivity of the microphones can be adjusted 
to focus forward. This can be done automatically and adaptively, so 
that the directionality is activated when the hearing aid senses back-
ground noise and changes the amount of directionality based on the 
extent of the noise (e.g., Ricketts et al., 2005). Although directional-
ity varies greatly as a function of instrument design, overall it has 
been found to be a very helpful feature for patients in noise.
A design goal of modern hearing aid circuitry is to reduce un-
wanted background noise while enhancing the signal of interest. 

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  589
The biggest challenge faced in achieving this goal is that the sig-
nal of interest is usually speech but so is the background noise. All 
modern hearing aids have noise reduction circuitry that attempts 
to enhance speech and reduce noise. An example of one fundamen-
tal approach to this is that the sounds of ongoing speech are highly 
variable and of short duration, whereas some background noise is 
fairly constant in intensity and frequency. A simple DSP strategy is 
to reduce the gain of the hearing aid in the frequency band of the 
constant noise, while enhancing the gain in the frequency bands 
of the perceived speech. Modern strategies are gaining in sophis-
tication and effectiveness and have been found to reduce some of 
the challenges that patients have hearing in noise.
Another processing strategy that has had a major impact on the 
fitting of  modern hearing aids is acoustic feedback reduction. 
Acoustic feedback occurs when the amplifi ed sound emanating 
from a loudspeaker is directed back into the microphone of the 
same amplifying system. This results in feedback, or whistling of 
the hearing aid. Most students are familiar with this concept from 
their experiences listening to public address systems. If the ampli-
fi ed sound of a public address system gets routed back into the mi-
crophone, a rather loud and annoying feedback occurs. You will 
learn later in this chapter that one of the more effective ways to 
reduce feedback is to physically separate the microphone from the 
speaker to an extent possible. Even with the most appropriately fi t-
ted hearing aids, however, feedback can still occur under certain 
circumstances. For example, when putting a telephone up to an 
ear with a hearing aid, the phone tends to direct any sound escap-
ing from the ear canal back into the hearing aid microphone, re-
sulting in feedback. Feedback suppression circuitry is designed to 
reduce or eliminate feedback by essentially searching for its reso-
nating frequency and reducing amplifi cation dramatically at that 
particular frequency (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2000; Kates, 2008; 
Parsa, 2006).
HEARING INSTRUMENT SYSTEMS
Aids to hearing come in many varieties. For convenience, we 
tend to talk about them as conventional hearing aids, hearing 
assistive technology, and implantable hearing technology. 
A conventional hearing aid is any device with the basic 

590  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
microphone-amplifier-receiver components contained within 
a single package that is worn in or around the ear. An assistive 
device generally uses a remote microphone to deliver signals to 
an amplifi er worn by the patient. An implantable device consists 
of  an external microphone-amplifi er-transmitter package that 
sends electrical signals to a receiver or electrode that has been 
implanted into the skull, middle ear, or cochlea.
Conventional Hearing Aids
Conventional hearing aids come in several styles and with a 
range of functionality. The most common styles of hearing aids

are known as behind-the-ear (BTE) and in-the-ear (ITE) hearing 
aids. A BTE hearing aid consists of the microphone, amplifi er, and 
loudspeaker housed in a case that is worn behind the ear. Ampli-
fi ed sound is delivered to the ear canal through a tube that leads 
either to a custom-fi tted earmold, a receiver in the canal, or some 
form of open-fi t coupler. An ITE hearing aid has all of the compo-
nents contained in a custom-fi tted case that fi ts into the outer ear 
or ear canal. A device that fi lls the outer ear concha is known ge-
nerically as an ITE. One variation is a device that is smaller and fi ts 
into the ear canal, known as an in-the-canal, or ITC, hearing aid. 
Another is a device that is an even smaller version that fi ts deeply in 
the canal, called a completely-in-the-canal, or CIC, hearing aid.
Behind-the-Ear
Figure 13-17 shows a picture of BTE hearing aids. The aid itself 
contains the microphone-amplifier-receiver in a package that 
hangs behind a patient’s ear. The microphone is usually located 
on the top or on the back side of the device. External controls for 
patient manipulation, usually an on/off switch and volume con-
trol, are also located on the back side.
Sound emanating from the hearing aid receiver leaves through 
an earhook that extends over the top of the auricle and holds the 
hearing aid in place. From here, sound is directed through hollow 
tubing to some form of coupling in the ear canal.

592  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
The conventional approach to delivering sound to the ear canal is 
through use of an earmold. An earmold is a customized coupler 
formed to fi t into the auricle. It is designed to channel sound from 
the earhook and tubing into the external auditory meatus. Ear-
molds come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Illustrations of some 
of the available earmold styles are shown in Figure 13-18. The 
acoustical properties of the sound that leaves the hearing aid are 
altered signifi cantly by the tubing and earmold. Earmold and tub-
ing modifi cations are often used to alter the frequency gain char-
acteristics of the hearing aid in a controlled manner. The earmold 
may or may not be vented, depending on gain needs and require-
ments for ear canal ventilation.
An alternative to conventional BTE fi tting is known as open-fi t tech-
nology or open-canal fi ttings (for an overview, see Mueller, 2006). 
The term open fi t pertains generally to the coupling within the ear 
canal that leaves the canal relatively unobstructed. The ear canal 
coupler is usually nonoccluding so that it does not completely fi ll 
the ear canal, and it is usually not a custom-made coupler.
Open-canal fittings are designed to fit high-frequency hear-
ing loss in which hearing is normal in the low frequencies out to 
about 2000 Hz. The value of not occluding the ear canal is that 
low-frequency sound is free to pass through the ear canal in an 
unobstructed manner, permitting natural hearing in the lower fre-
quencies. The higher frequencies are amplifi ed and directed through 
a thin tube to a coupler in the ear canal. There is actually nothing

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  593
new about open-canal fi ttings. In the past they were known as tube 
fi ttings.  Although the same concept, the application was consider-
ably more diffi cult in the past due to technology limitations relating 
to limiting gain in the low frequency, feedback issues, and ease of fi t 
and retention. The newer open-canal technology has effectively ad-
dressed these issues and has been very successful in fi tting patients 
with milder, high-frequency hearing loss.
The open-fi t concept has two variations. The more conventional 
has the receiver in the hearing aid. An example of an open-canal 
fit hearing aid with the receiver in the hearing aid is shown in 
Figure 13-19. The actual coupler of the tubing into the ear canal 
is usually not a custom-made coupler; rather it usually is a small 
sleeve or a dome-shaped coupler that comes in various sizes to fi t 
different sized ear canals. If retention of the tubing or feedback is 
an issue, a custom-made coupler can be used. The more the ear 
canal is occluded, of course, the more the fi tting resembles that 
of a conventional BTE.
The alternative open-fi t variation has the receiver in the canal, 
the RIC fi tting. An example of  an RIC hearing aid is shown in 
Figure 13-20. The RIC fi tting can be an open-canal fi t, or it can 
be more of a conventional, occluded BTE fi t. The advantages of 
FIGURE 13-19 Photograph of an open-canal hearing aid. (Photograph

594  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
moving the receiver into the ear canal is the separation of  the 
receiver from the microphone, thereby reducing the potential for 
acoustic feedback and creating the opportunity for more hear-
ing aid gain. In an RIC device, the thin tubing that is used with 
conventional open-canal devices is replaced by a thin wire that 
directs the amplifi er output to the receiver.
In-the-Ear
ITE hearing aids are shown in Figure 13-21. Here, the microphone-
amplifi er-receiver are all contained in a custom-fi tted case that fi ts 
into the concha of the auricle.
The microphone port is located on the hearing aid faceplate. This 
provides an advantage over BTE hearing aids in that the microphone

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  595
is located in a more natural location on an ITE. This advantage 
increases with ITC and CIC devices. External controls for patient 
manipulation, including a selection switch and volume control are 
also located on the faceplate.
An ITC or canal hearing aid is a smaller version of an ITE that 
tends to be fi tted more deeply in the canal and extends outward 
into the concha to a lesser extent than an ITE. A canal hearing aid 
is shown in Figure 13-22.
Not unlike the ITE, the microphone ports and external controls 
are located on the hearing aid faceplate. Other controls, such as 
the computer interface port, are usually located in the battery 
compartment or on the inside surface of the case.
A CIC hearing aid is a small canal device that has its lateral end 
1 to 2 mm inside the opening of  the ear canal and terminates 
close to the tympanic membrane.
CIC hearing aids are shown in Figure 13-23. Here, the microphone-
amplifier-receiver are all contained in a custom-fitted case that 
fi ts deeply into the ear canal. The microphone port is located on 
FIGURE 13-21 Photograph of ITE hearing aids. (Photograph courtesy of

the faceplate. There is also a thin filament protruding from the 
faceplate that serves primarily as an extraction device for the 
aid. Some hearing aids have this attached to a volume control for 
 patient manipulation.

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  597
Style Considerations
Although the decision on which type of hearing aid to wear may 
be based on cosmetic considerations, several other factors must 
be considered.
Acoustic Feedback. First, there is the matter of acoustic feedback. 
As mentioned previously, if the amplifi ed sound emanating from 
a loudspeaker is directed back into the microphone of the same 
amplifying system, the result is acoustic feedback or whistling of 
the hearing aid. One way to control feedback on hearing aids is to 
separate the microphone and loudspeaker by as much distance as 
possible. This solution favors the BTE hearing aid, in which the 
output of the loudspeaker is in the ear canal, and the microphone 
is behind the ear. This advantage may be enhanced with the RIC 
device, in which the receiver is in the canal, further separating it 
from the microphone. Another solution is to attempt to seal off 
the ear canal so that the amplifi ed sound cannot escape and be 
re-amplifi ed. The tradeoff here is usually between isolation of the 
microphone from the sound port and amount of output intensity 
that is desired. The higher the intensity of output, the more likely 
it is that feedback will occur. Thus, if a person has a severe hearing 
loss, greater output intensity is required, and greater separation 
of the microphone and loudspeaker will be necessary. Although 
electronic feedback reduction has reduced this problem to an ex-
tent, canal hearing aids are generally restricted to milder hearing 
losses, and more severe hearing losses benefi t from the advantages 
of BTE hearing aids.
Occlusion. Placement of an earmold or hearing aid into the ear 
canal occludes the opening and creates three potentially detri-
mental problems. One is that it seals off the ear canal, reducing 
natural aeration of the external auditory meatus. In some pa-
tients, this can lead to problems associated with external otitis. 
Another problem is that plugging the ear canal creates an addi-
tional hearing loss, often referred to as insertion loss. This is par-
ticularly problematic in patients with normal hearing sensitivity 
in the low frequencies.
The third problem is the occlusion effect and its impact on pa-
tients’ perceptions of their own voices. Imagine if you plugged 
your ears and had to listen to yourself talk all day. Especially if you 
External otitis is 
inﬂ ammation of the outer ear.
The difference in SPL at the 
tympanic membrane with 
the ear canal open and the 
ear canal occluded by an 
earmold or hearing aid is 
called insertion loss.

598  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
have good hearing sensitivity in the low frequencies, your voice 
would be self-perceived as rather loud. This can be a signifi cant 
problem for some patients.
One solution to these problems is venting. Venting refers to the 
creation of a passageway for air and sound around or through a 
hearing device by the addition of a vent. A vent is a bore made in 
an earmold or in-the-ear hearing aid that permits the passage of 
sound and air into the otherwise blocked ear canal.
Venting creates both an opportunity and a challenge. The oppor-
tunity is that the electroacoustic characteristics of the hearing aid 
can be manipulated by the size and type of venting. Low-frequency 
amplifi cation can be eliminated and natural sound allowed to pass 
through the hearing aid for patients with normal low-frequency 
hearing and high-frequency hearing loss. Thus, venting can be used 
to shape the frequency gain response in very benefi cial ways. Gen-
erally, the larger the vent, the more pronounced is the effect. The 
challenge associated with this opportunity is related to feedback. 
The larger the vent, the more likely it is that amplifi ed sound will 
fi nd its way out of the ear canal and back into the microphone port. 
Various venting strategies can be used to reduce feedback prob-
lems, but there always remains some tradeoff between the amount 
of gain that can be delivered by the hearing aid and the amount of 
venting necessary to achieve a proper frequency gain response.
Another solution to the problems associated with occlusion is 
the use of open-canal fi ttings. Of course, the challenge of using 
open fi ttings and acoustic feedback is not unlike that encoun-
tered with venting.
Microphone Considerations
The choice of hearing aid style impacts both microphone place-
ment and the potential effectiveness of directionality. As men-
tioned earlier in this chapter, our tympanic membranes are our 
natural microphones. Our ability to localize sound, indeed our 
spatial hearing in general, benefits from the natural influences 
of the auricle and concha. In addition, the auricle and concha 
increase high-frequency hearing by collecting and resonating 
sound above 2000 Hz. Thus, the closer the microphone is to the

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  599
tympanic membrane, the more the hearing aid can benefi t from 
these natural infl uences. Conversely, the farther removed the mi-
crophone, the more the hearing aid will have to make up for the 
elimination of these infl uences.
In this way, CIC hearing aids can have a distinct advantage over 
other styles. In addition, by terminating close to the tympanic 
membrane, the residual volume of the ear canal between the end 
of  the device and the membrane increases the sound pressure 
level by a signifi cant amount across the frequency range. So the 
combination of the natural infl uences of the outer-ear structures 
and the deep insertion of a CIC requires less amplifi er gain than 
a larger device to produce the same amount of  amplification. 
 Because less amplifi er gain is required, feedback and distortion are 
reduced and battery life is increased.
Placing the microphone deeply in the ear canal has some other 
practical advantages, including the reduction of  wind noise, 
ease of  telephone use, and enhanced listening with headsets 
and stethoscopes.
One other microphone consideration relates to directionality. The 
best directionality is achieved in hearing aids by using two mi-
crophones, placed some distance apart. The effectiveness of di-
rectionality increases with distance, so that the farther apart the 
microphones are from each other, the better is the directional ef-
fect. This clearly favors larger hearing aids such as ITEs and BTEs. 
Because these larger devices have microphones that are farther 
removed from the tympanic membrane, directionality is more 
necessary than for CICs, so the increased effectiveness should pro-
vide some balance in terms of style consideration.
Durability
A fi nal style consideration relates to durability of the instruments. 
In ITC and CIC instruments, all of the electronic components are 
placed within the ear canal and subjected to the detrimental ef-
fects of perspiration and cerumen. As a result, repair rates and 
downtime can be considerably greater for these smaller devices. 
This is frustrating to many patients and must be considered in the 
selection process.

Hearing Assistive Technology
Amplifi cation systems other than conventional hearing aids have 
been designed for more specifi c listening situations. These devices 
are known collectively as hearing assistive technology (HAT) and 
include assistive listening devices (ALDs), alerting devices, signal-
ing devices, and telephone amplifi ers. Assistive devices are usually 
not used as general purpose amplifi cation devices; rather, they are 
used as situation-specifi c amplifi cation in a particular listening 
environment or situation.
Assistive Listening Devices
Among the devices considered to be ALDs are personal amplifi ers, 
FM systems, and television listeners. In general, these devices are 
designed to enhance an acoustic signal over background noise by 
the use of a remote microphone. That is, rather than the micro-
phone being built into the same case as the amplifi er and receiver, 
it is separated in some way to close the gap between the signal 
source and the listener.
At least three categories of patients benefi t from the use of ALDs. 
One category includes patients who simply do not receive suffi -
cient benefi t from their conventional hearing aids. As a general 
rule, individuals who have more severe hearing losses often fi nd 
that supplementing hearing aid use with ALDs is necessary under 
certain circumstances. Other individuals, because of communica-
tion demands in their workplace or social life, welcome the addi-
tional use of ALDs. A second category includes patients who have 
amplifi cation needs that are so specifi c that the general use of a 
hearing aid is not indicated. For example, some individuals feel as 
if their only communication problems occur when viewing televi-
sion or attending church. For those individuals, an ALD tailored 
to that particular need is often an appropriate alternative to a con-
ventional hearing aid. A fi nal category includes patients who have 
hearing disorders due to changes in central nervous system func-
tion. The resulting auditory processing disorder is not necessarily 
accompanied by a loss in hearing sensitivity, but rather is char-
acterized by diffi culty understanding speech in background noise. 
For these patients, use of a remote microphone for enhancement 
of signal-to-noise ratio is more appropriate than amplification 
from a conventional hearing aid.

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  601
Hearing in the presence of background noise remains a problem 
for individuals with hearing loss and for those who wear conven-
tional hearing devices. Strides have been made over the last few 
years to address this issue. In conventional ear-level hearing aids, 
the introduction of sophisticated compression strategies has en-
hanced listening in noise, as has the use of directional microphone 
systems. Despite this progress, some patients need additional as-
sistance with hearing in unfavorable listening situations. In these 
patients, use of remote-microphone technology can provide sub-
stantial assistance.
Personal FM Systems
One type of ALD is a personal FM system. A photograph of a per-
sonal FM system is shown in Figure 13-24. The system consists 
of two parts, a microphone-transmitter and an amplifi er-receiver. 
FIGURE 13-24 Photograph of a personal FM system, including a transmitter (A), an ear-level 
receiver (B), and a neck-loop receiver (C). (Photos courtesy of Phonak.)

602  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
The microphone is connected to, or is a part of, the case that con-
tains the FM transmitter. The person who is talking wears the mi-
crophone and transmitter. Signals from the transmitter are sent 
to a receiver via FM radio waves. The listener wears the amplifi er-
receiver, which acts like a FM radio and “picks up” the transmitted 
signal. The receiver is usually integrated into the hearing aid or 
coupled to the listener’s ear via earphones or to hearing aid t-coils 
via a neck loop that transmits the signal.
The obvious advantage of this type of remote-microphone, personal 
FM system is that the listener’s ear is no farther from the speaker 
than the microphone is from the speaker’s mouth. Thus, the gap 
from the speaker to the listener is bridged, thereby eliminating the 
infl uence of all the intervening noise. This idea of signal-to-noise 
ratio enhancement is shown in Figure 13-25.
By detaching the microphone from the remainder of the amplifi ca-
tion device, certain listening situations that can be very diffi cult for 
a patient using a conventional hearing aid are made much easier. 
These situations include listening in a classroom, restaurant, car 
church, theatre, or in a party situation.

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  603
Advances in both transmitter and receiver technology have placed 
remote-microphone  technology into the mainstream. Some trans-
mitters have sophisticated array microphones, which are designed 
for directionality. The transmitter can be enclosed in a small hand-
held case that can be directed at a sound source or handed to a 
speaker during communication in a noisy environment. FM trans-
mitters can also be included in hearing instrument remote con-
trols. Similar advances have been made on the receiver portion of 
the FM system. Entire FM receiver systems can be integrated into a 
conventional BTE or ITE hearing device or other coupler. An exam-
ple of an FM “boot” or coupler for a BTE is shown in  Figure 13-26. 
As these transmitters and receivers have become more practical 
and advanced, the use of remote-microphone technology has be-
come a more common option.
Other Remote Microphone Systems
Personal FM systems are considered general purpose remote-
microphone systems. Other systems are designed as instruments 
dedicated to a single purpose, such as television viewing. Television 
listeners are similar in concept to the FM system, except that the 
An array is an orderly 
grouping. An array 
microphone system 
contains multiple 
microphones aligned 
in a row, designed for 
directionality.

604  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
transmitter is connected directly to the television. Audio signals 
from the television are transmitted, either by FM or by infrared 
light waves, to a dedicated receiver that is worn by the patient.
These types of dedicated systems are installed in many theaters. 
The transmitter is interfaced to the sound system of the theater, 
and patrons can request the use of  a receiver during a perfor-
mance. Again, some of the systems use FM waves as the carrier 
of the signal, and others use infrared light waves. Regardless, the 
effect is to bring the sound source closer to the listener’s ear.
Personal Ampliﬁ ers
Another type of assistive listening device is called a personal am-
plifi er. A photograph is shown in Figure 13-27.
A personal amplifi er consists of a microphone that is connected to 
an amplifi er box, usually by a cord. The microphone is held by the 
person who is talking. The signal is then routed to a small case, 
which is often about the size of a deck of cards. The box contains 
the battery, amplifi er electronics, and volume control.
The loudspeaker is typically a set of lightweight headphones or an 
ear-bud transducer. By separating the microphone from the am-
plifi er, it can be moved closely to the signal of interest. In doing so, 
the signal-to-noise ratio is enhanced.
Personal amplifiers are often used as generic replacements for 
conventional hearing aids in acute listening situations. A com-
mon example of personal amplifi er use is in a hospital. Patients 
who are in the hospital without their hearing aids or who have de-
veloped hearing loss while in the hospital may need amplifi cation 
during their stay. The personal amplifi er provides a good tempo-
rary solution. A physician who specializes in geriatric treatment 
will often carry a personal amplifi er while making rounds in case 
it is needed to communicate with a patient. Another common use 
for a personal amplifier is the patient receiving palliative care 
who needs amplifi cation only on a temporary basis.
Other Assistive Technologies
Assistive devices come in other forms as well. Telephone amplifi ers 
are popular and are available in several forms. Some handsets have 
Palliate means to lessen the 
severity of without curing; 
Palliative care is that 
which is provided to patients 
with terminal illnesses.

built-in amplifi ers with a volume control. There are also portable tele-
phone amplifi ers that can be attached to any phone. The telephone 
receiver can also be adapted to transmit over FM waves to a personal 
FM system. There are also amplifi ed receivers for mobile phones that 
communicate by Bluetooth or other wireless technology.

606  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
Other assistive technology available to individuals with hear-
ing impairment has been designed to replace what is typically an 
acoustic signal with a different signal that can be perceived by 
one of the other senses. One of the most commonly used assis-
tive device is a text telephone, whereby communication over the 
telephone lines is achieved by typing messages. Another type of 
assistive device is closed captioning of television shows. Closed 
captioning presents the dialogue of  a television show as text 
along the bottom of the television screen. Other assistive technol-
ogy includes alerting devices, such as alarm clocks, fi re alarms, 
and doorbells, which are designed to fl ash a light or vibrate a bed 
when activated.
Implantable Hearing Technology
Three types of hearing devices are surgically implanted: cochlear 
implants, bone-anchored hearing aids, and middle-ear implants. 
In most cases, there are two components to the implant, one 
a device that is implanted in the ear or skull and the other an 
external device that delivers signals to the implant. The most 
common implantable device is the cochlear implant, which is used 
in patients who have hearing disorder severe enough to preclude 
successful use of  conventional hearing aids. Bone-anchored 
hearing aids are used for patients with inoperable conductive loss 
or for single-sided deafness. Middle-ear implants are an emerging 
technology aimed primarily at patients with moderately severe to 
severe hearing loss.
Cochlear Implants
Individuals who have severe or profound deafness and do not ben-
efi t from conventional amplifi cation are candidates for cochlear 
implants (for a comprehensive review, see Waltzman & Roland, 
2007). Profound deafness results from a loss of hair cell function 
in the cochlea. As a result, neural impulses are not generated, 
and electrical activity in the auditory nerve is not initiated. A co-
chlear implant is designed to stimulate the auditory nerve directly. 
An electrode array is surgically implanted into the cochlea. The 
electrode array is attached to a magnet that is implanted into the 
temporal bone. Acoustic signals are received via a microphone at-
tached to a sophisticated amplifi er. The amplifi er then sends sig-
nals to the electrode via the implanted magnet/receiver. When the 

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  607
electrode receives a signal, it applies an electrical current to the 
cochlea, thereby stimulating the auditory nerve.
Cochlear implants are different from conventional hearing aids 
in that hearing aids simply amplify sound, whereas cochlear im-
plants bypass the cochlear damage and stimulate the auditory 
nervous tissue directly. The potential advantages for patients with 
severe and profound hearing loss are numerous and include better 
high-frequency hearing, enhanced dynamic range, better speech 
recognition, and no acoustic feedback problems.
The major conceptual and technological advances in cochlear im-
plantation are shown schematically in the technology pyramid in 
Figure 13-28. The fi rst cochlear implant was a single electrode.

body-worn amplifi er. In the early days, the expectations were that 
the individual with deafness would benefi t from sound awareness 
and that the device would serve as a useful aid to lipreading. The 
next major step was technological, with the development of  a 
multichannel, multielectrode array with digital signal processing. 
With general technological advances relating to power supply and 
computer processing capacity and speed came more sophisticated 
algorithms for signal processing and for delivering the signals 
more effectively to the electrode array. The external processors 
also shrunk considerably in size. Along with these technological 
advances, it became apparent that the cochlear implant could be 
far more than just an aid to lipreading. Soon patients were able to 
have open-set speech recognition and even talk on the telephone 
with an implant. Success in adults lead to trials in children, and 
implants quickly became the standard of care for hearing treat-
ment of young children with deafness. Implant use became so 
generally successful and widely accepted that it came to be applied 
to some patients with less hearing sensitivity loss if they could not 
benefit from conventional amplification. Today, many patients 
seek binaural implantation, and devices have been developed for 
partial implantation of those with precipitous hearing loss. Fully 
implantable cochlear implants are emerging from clinical trials.
Over the years, cochlear implants have been shown to be valu-
able in two groups of patients. Adults who have lost their hearing-
adventitiously can derive substantial benefi t from a cochlear implant. 
Young children with adventitious hearing loss or with congenital 
hearing loss that is identifi ed early can also benefi t substantially from 
a cochlear implant, especially when implanted at an early age.
Internal Components
The surgically implanted portion of a cochlear implant has two 
components, a receiver and an electrode array. A photograph of 
the implant is shown in Figure 13-29. The receiver is surgically 
embedded into the temporal bone. The electrode array is inserted 
into the round window of the cochlea and passed through the 
cochlear labyrinth in the scala tympani, curving around the mo-
diolus as it moves toward the apex. A schematic drawing of the 
electrode array in the cochlea is shown in Figure 13-30.
A person who has lost his or 
her hearing adventitiously 
did so after acquiring speech 
and language.

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  609
The receiver is essentially a magnet that receives signals electro-
magnetically from the external processor. The receiver then trans-
mits these signals to the proper electrodes in the array. The electrode 
array is a series of wires attached to electrode stimula tors that are 
arranged along the end of a flexible tube. The electrodes are ar-
ranged in a series, with those at the end of the array nearer the 
apex of the cochlear and those at the beginning of the array nearer 
the  cochlea’s base.
External Components
The external components of  a cochlear implant are similar to 
those of a conventional hearing aid. The microphone is located in 
an ear-level device. Output from the microphone is routed to an 
amplifi er that uses digital signal processing. The amplifi ed signal 
is delivered to a receiver, which, in this case, delivers signals to a 
transmitter coil. The transmitter coil has a magnet which holds

Bionics® Corporation)

610  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
it against the skin opposite to the internal receiver. The signal is 
then transmitted electromagnetically across the skin.
Photographs of the external components of a cochlear implant 
are shown in Figure 13-31. Because of the sophisticated nature of 
signal processing and the power needed to drive the electromag-
netic coupling, these external components are often contained in 
a body-worn case. Ear-level processors can also be used, subject to 
processing and power consumption constraints.

cochlea. (Courtesy of Advanced Bionics® Corporation)

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  611
Signal Processing
Signal processing strategies used in cochlear implants are sophis-
ticated algorithms designed to analyze speech into salient features 
and deliver the relevant parameters to the electrode array.
The strategies are numerous and complex, but all are based on 
analyzing frequency, intensity, and temporal cues from the speech 
signals and translating them to the electrode array in a manner 
that can be effectively processed by the residual neurons of the 
auditory nerve.
A simple example of the processing that can be done may be help-
ful in understanding the potential of cochlear implant signal pro-
cessing. The spatial characteristics of the electrode array permit 
some degree of frequency translation to the ear. High-frequency 
information can be delivered to the basal electrodes, and low-
 frequency information can be delivered to the apical electrodes. 
The amount of stimulation of each electrode can be used to trans-
late intensity information to the ear. In this way, the speech pro-
cessor can detect and extract frequency and intensity information 
and deliver it at a specifi ed magnitude to an electrode correspond-
ing to the frequency range of the signal.

Bone-Anchored Hearing Aids
A bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is a very different strat-
egy from a cochlear implant and is intended for a very different 
population of patients. A BAHA consists of a titanium screw that 
is surgically placed into the mastoid bone. An external amplifi er 
that is essentially a bone vibrator is snapped into the screw and 
sends vibratory energy to the screw, which in turn stimulates the 
cochlea via bone conduction.
A schematic drawing of how a bone-anchored hearing aid works 
is shown in Figure 13-32. The external device has a microphone, 
a battery, an amplifi er, and a vibrating transducer. A basic linear 
amplifi er is used to stimulate a normal or near-normal cochlea. 
The implant itself is simply a piece of metal that is sunk into the 
skull to help the bone vibrate effi ciently.
At least two groups of patients benefi t from the BAHA, patients with 
intractable or inoperable conductive hearing loss and patients with 
single-sided deafness (McLarnon et al., 2004). Patients with conduc-
tive hearing loss include those with atresia that has not or cannot be 
FIGURE 13-32 Schematic drawing of the BAHA external ampliﬁ er and implantable transducer, 
stimulating both cochleae via bone conduction. (Photography courtesy of Cochlear Americas)

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  613
surgically repaired or patients whose conductive losses can no lon-
ger be surgically repaired, usually due to multiple operations or long-
standing disease process. Although the BAHA is an effi cient vibrator 
of the skull and, thus, stimulator of the cochlea, there are limits to 
how much gain it can provide. As a result, cochlear sensitivity has 
to be reasonably adequate for optimum effectiveness. When it is, the 
BAHA is a very benefi cial approach in these patients.
The other problem that can be addressed with a BAHA is profound 
unilateral hearing loss or single-sided deafness. Here the BAHA is 
acting as a CROS, or contralateral-routing-of-signal, hearing aid. 
That is, the device is implanted on the side with the hearing loss. 
Its microphone picks up sound on that side and transmits it to the 
other ear via bone conduction. To the extent that unilateral hear-
ing loss is troublesome to an individual patient, the BAHA can be 
a very effective amplifi cation solution.
Middle-Ear Implants
A third type of implantable hearing device is the middle-ear im-
plant (for a review, see Wiet et al., 2003). The implants are of 
several varieties but are intended for the same purpose, to treat 
sensorineural hearing loss. The basic strategy behind a middle-
ear implant is to drive the ossicles with direct stimulation so that 
they, in turn, deliver the vibratory energy to the cochlea.
Efforts have been made over the last few decades to perfect the 
technique for ossicular stimulation with varying degrees of suc-
cess. One approach to middle-ear implantation is to affi x a magnet 
to some portion of the ossicular chain and then drive the magnet 
to vibration through a neck loop or a coil worn on the head. The 
vibratory energy of the magnet sets the ossicles in motion and 
stimulates the cochlea.
Another approach is to place a small piston on the ossicles and 
drive them with the motion of the piston. There is a partially im-
plantable version of this device that has an external unit to receive 
sound and deliver it to the internal processor. There is also a fully 
implantable version of this middle-ear device.
Another approach to middle-ear implantation is a fully implant-
able strategy that essentially uses the tympanic membrane as 

614  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
the microphone. A small vibrator, called a piezoelectric crystal is 
 attached to the malleus and is stimulated by tympanic membrane 
movement. The signal from the vibrator is then amplifi ed and de-
livered to a similar driver that is attached to the stapes. A schematic 
of this middle-ear implant is shown in Figure 13-33.
Most patients who seek middle-ear implantation have mod-
erately severe or severe hearing losses, losses that are signifi-
cant enough to be a challenge for conventional hearing aids 
but not enough to require a cochlear implant. There are some 
real and some potential advantages to this approach. A totally 
 implantable hearing aid can be worn all of  the time (to bed, 
in the shower), cannot be seen, and has no acoustic feedback. 
The approach that uses the tympanic membrane as the micro-
phone has the added advantage of preserving the spatial hear-
ing cues of outer and middle ears. One advantage that seems to 
be universally applicable to this approach regardless of technique 
is that patients report that the devices delivery exceptional 
sound quality.
FIGURE 13-33 Schematic drawing of a fully implantable middle-ear device. (Courtesy of Envoy Medical)

CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS  615
Because middle-ear surgery of this nature is challenging and be-
cause of the costs and risks of surgery, middle-ear implantation does 
not yet enjoy widespread application. It seems only a matter of time 
before technological advances will make this a more readily available 
approach and one that is applicable to a wider range of patients.
Summary
A hearing aid is an electronic amplifier that has three main 
• 
components: a microphone, an amplifi er, and a loudspeaker.
A microphone is a transducer that changes acoustical energy 
• 
into electrical energy.
The heart of a hearing aid is its power amplifi er, which boosts 
• 
the level of the electrical signal that is delivered to the hearing 
aid’s loudspeaker. The amplifi er controls how much amplifi ca-
tion occurs at certain frequencies.
The loudspeaker is a transducer that changes electrical energy 
• 
back into acoustical energy.
The various output parameters of a hearing aid amplifi er can 
• 
be manipulated by software control.
The acoustic response characteristics of hearing aids are de-
• 
scribed in terms of frequency gain, input-output, and output 
limiting.
The frequency gain response of a hearing aid is the amount of 
• 
gain as a function of frequency.
The input-output characteristic of a hearing aid is the amount 
• 
of gain as a function of the input intensity level.
Output limiting refers to the maximum intensity of the ampli-
• 
fi ed signal and is controlled by compression limiting, which re-
duces output gradually as a function of its intensity.
In modern hearing aids, acoustic signals are converted from 
• 
analog to digital and back again, with digital control over vari-
ous amplifi cation parameters.
A conventional hearing aid is any device with the basic 
• 
microphone-amplifi er-receiver components contained within 
a single package that is worn in or around the ear. The most 
common styles of  conventional hearing aids are known as 
behind-the-ear and in-the-ear.

616  CHAPTER 13  THE AUDIOLOGIST’S TREATMENT TOOLS: HEARING INSTRUMENTS
An assistive listening device generally uses a remote microphone 
• 
to deliver signals to an amplifi er worn by the patient. Among 
the devices considered to be ALDs are personal amplifiers, 
FM systems, and television listeners.
A cochlear implant consists of an external microphone-amplifi er-
• 
transmitter package that sends electrical signals to a receiver or 
electrode that has been implanted into the cochlea.

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  621
The fundamental goal of audiologic management is to reduce the 
communication problems that result from hearing loss. The fi rst 
step in that process is to maximize the patient’s access to sound. 
Once that is achieved, audiologic management often proceeds 
with some form of aural rehabilitation.
As you learned in Chapter 13, there are innumerable options 
for audiologic treatment of hearing loss, including conventional 
hearing aids, cochlear implants, assistive listening devices, and 
so on. By far, the most common fi rst treatment option for making 
sound more accessible is the use of conventional hearing-aids.
Once the needs assessment has been done, the style and options 
for hearing aids are selected, and the process of  hearing aid 
fi tting begins.
HEARING AID SELECTION AND FITTING
Hearing aids are selected and fi tted based on an individual’s com-
munication needs, degree of hearing loss, audiometric confi gu-
ration of the loss, loudness discomfort levels, and other factors 
relating to style choice. Impressions are then made of the ear ca-
nal for custom earmolds or hearing aids. Once the hearing aids 
and/or earmolds are received from the manufacturer, the aids are 
subjected to quality control of both form and electroacoustic func-
tion. The hearing aids are then programmed based on the patient’s 
audiometric outcomes and needs. Verification of the frequency 
 response is usually made by probe-microphone measurement. 
Probe-microphone 
measurement is an 
electroacoustic assessment 
of the characteristics of a 
hearing aid at or near the 
tympanic membrane using a 
probe microphone.

• 
hearing aid selection.

622  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
A small microphone is placed near the tympanic membrane, and 
the responses of the hearing aids to speech or speech-like sounds 
are determined for different levels of input. The hearing aids are 
then adjusted so that the responses approximate the desired tar-
gets. The electroacoustic analysis is verifi ed further with formal or 
informal assessment of quality, loudness, and/or speech percep-
tion. The hearing aids may then be adjusted again if perceptual 
expectations are not met. Thus, the process of hearing aid selec-
tion and fi tting usually follows this course:
 1. selection
 2. quality control
 3. programming
 4. verifi cation
 5. adjustment
The Prescription of Gain
The process of  selection and fitting of  hearing aids changed 
abruptly with the advent of digital hearing aids. Because of the 
inherent flexibility of  the digital signal processing platform of 
modern hearing aids, a given hearing aid can be programmed to 
fi t a wide range of degree and confi guration of hearing loss. This 
was not always the case.
In the past, we selected the actual device or hearing aid circuit to 
match what we thought a patient’s hearing loss might require. The 
fi rst step in the hearing aid selection process back then was to deter-
mine the target frequency gain responses based on the audiogram. 
Once the target was determined, the audiologist would browse 
through a book of hearing aid specifications and find gain char-
acteristics that approximated the prescribed target. A hearing aid 
was then ordered with circuitry that seemed to have the best match.
Today, in general, the factor that separates one hearing aid from 
another is related to features and processor algorithms rather 
than to the frequency gain response of the hearing aid. This is a 
fundamental change. Now we select hearing aids based on their 
features and program them to deliver a response that matches the 
prescriptive targets.

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  623
The targets have changed as well, due in part to enhanced knowl-
edge and in part to enhanced opportunity. The opportunity to 
program hearing aids in a very fl exible way now permits targeting 
over a wide range, requiring us to understand better what those 
targets should be.
It is useful to have a basic understanding of the evolution of the 
prescriptive approach to better understand the approaches of today 
(for a review, see Sammeth & Levitt, 2000). The earliest approach 
to what was known as selective amplifi cation was to prescribe fre-
quency gain characteristics based on audiometric thresholds.
A threshold-based prescriptive method is designed to specify fre-
quency gain characteristics that will amplify average conversa-
tional speech to a comfortable or preferred listening level. The 
underlying assumption here is that the audiogram can be used 
to predict this comfort level. A number of prescriptive rules were 
developed over the years for this purpose. As an example, the 
half-gain rule prescribes gain equal to one-half the amount of 
hearing loss; a third-gain rule to one-third of the loss. Most pre-
scriptive rules started with this type of approach and then altered 
individual frequencies based on some empirically determined 
correction factors.
An example might be helpful. One popular early threshold-based 
procedure, which still serves as the basis for some approaches to-
day, was that of the National Acoustic Laboratory (NAL) (Byrne 
& Dillon, 1986). The early NAL-R formula expressed gain as the 
amount of hearing loss (HL) as follows:
 250 Hz = (0.31 × HL) − 17 dB
 500 Hz = (0.31 × HL) − 8 dB + (0.05 × HL)
1000 Hz = (0.31 × HL) + 1 dB + (0.05 × HL)
2000 Hz = (0.31 × HL) − 1 dB + (0.05 × HL)
3000 Hz = (0.31 × HL) − 2 dB
4000 Hz = (0.31 × HL) − 2 dB
6000 Hz = (0.31 × HL) − 2 dB

624  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
The result is the targeted gain at each frequency. Figure 14-1 
shows the amount of gain that would be prescribed for a hearing 
loss using this approach.
Efforts were also made to prescribe gain based on threshold and 
discomfort levels. One early notable effort that has also stood the 
test of time is the desired sensation level (DSL) method (Seewald, 
1992). The DSL was originally designed for fi tting hearing aids in 
children. It prescribed gain based on both thresholds and discom-
fort levels, which were predicted from those thresholds. A newer 
alternative, the DSL[i/o] was designed to enhance audibility of 
soft sounds (Cornelisse et al., 1995) and is used in many modern 
fi tting systems.
As signal processing technology improved, the need grew to de-
velop improved prescriptive formulas. For example, prescriptive 
procedures were developed in response to wide dynamic range 
compression amplifiers. In these approaches, targets were de-
termined for soft, moderate, and loud sound (VanVliet, 1995). 
More recent procedures combine the linear approach of the early 
threshold-based prescription methods with different prescription 
requirements for soft and loud sounds (Byrne et al., 2001).
Early digital signal processing hearing aids were designed to rep-
licate state of the art analog processing, such as wide dynamic 
range compression. As the strategies for DSP progressed beyond 
the simple replication of analog technology, the need has grown 
for enhanced targeting strategies. This has led to the development 
of processing-strategy-specifi c targets that are often proprietary 
for a given approach.
There are other considerations for determining targets, including 
the type of hearing loss and whether one or both ears are being 
fi tted. For example, when there is a conductive component to the 
hearing loss, target gain is usually increased by approximately 
25% of the air-bone gap at a given frequency. When the hearing 
aid fi tting is binaural, the target gain for each ear is usually re-
duced by 3 to 6 dB to account for binaural summation.
Modern hearing aids are programmed under computer control 
with software provided by the manufacturer of the device. Each

software program is slightly different, but most recommend a 
 prescriptive approach for their particular hearing aids. They also 
provide the audiologist with the flexibility to change gain and 
other parameters as might be indicated by the hearing loss, the 
audiologist’s preference, or other factors.
Hearing Instrument Selection
The process of hearing instrument selection is one of systemati-
cally narrowing choices until a reasonable approximation of the 
patient’s hearing and treatment needs are met. Once the decision 
has been made to pursue conventional hearing aid amplifi cation, 
the process begins by determining the style and features of the 
hearing aids that will be most appropriate for the patient’s hear-
ing loss and communication needs.
As you learned in Chapters 12 and 13, there are a number of 
challenges and options that need to be addressed during the hear-
ing aid selection process. These include:
binaural versus monaural fi tting,
• 
hearing aid style,
• 
number and size of user controls,
• 
occlusion issues,
• 
gain processing options,
• 
telecoil and other wireless options,
• 
remote-microphone options,
• 
noise reduction considerations,
• 
feedback suppression possibilities,
• 
directional microphone, and
• 
device costs.
• 
In reality, many of these factors interact with each other. Just as 
an example, if a decision is made to get a hearing aid with adaptive 
directionality, it is probably at a technology level in which all de-
vices will also have multiple memories and advanced processing.
Some of the decisions are made by the audiologist; others by the 
patient. If it were up to the audiologist, all patients would have 
binaural hearing aids with directionality, wireless connectivity, a 

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  627
remote microphone option, and every other feature that ensures a 
successful fi t and a happy patient. More often than not, however, 
reality plays a role in these decisions, and compromises are made. 
This speaks to the need for a communication needs assessment as 
part of the treatment evaluation process.
The selection process usually begins with a discussion of hearing 
aid style and the relative benefi ts and challenges of ITEs and BTEs. 
Although the hearing loss may dictate this decision, both types 
can be used to fi t a broad range of hearing loss. More often than 
not, the decision is one of patient preference, usually based on ap-
pearance, convenience issues, or past experience.
Once the style has been chosen, the feature/technology level must 
be determined. Hearing aid manufacturers tend to group features 
of hearing aids by levels of technology. The groupings vary among 
manufacturers and are by no means a static categorization; they 
may even vary among styles within a given manufacturer. The 
one constant, though, is that the higher the technology level, the 
higher the fi nancial cost of the device.
The selection of the appropriate feature and technology level be-
comes a negotiation with the patient about communication needs 
and the cost-effectiveness of the various solutions.
Once all of these decisions have been made, the audiologist will 
have narrowed the selection process down to a tractable set of 
device options. The audiologist will then compare these options 
against the knowledge of devices available from several manufac-
turers and make a decision about exactly which hearing aids to 
order for the patient.
Hearing Instrument Fitting and Verification
Hearing aid fi tting has two important components, getting the ac-
tual physical fi t of the device right and getting the electroacoustic 
characteristics of the device right. Both require signifi cant techni-
cal knowledge and skill, and both require a bit of artistic talent. 
The general process of fi tting and verifi cation includes:
ear impressions,
• 
quality control,
• 

628  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
device programming,
• 
verifi cation of fi t, and
• 
verifi cation of function.
• 
Ear Impressions
The fi tting process usually begins with the making of impressions 
of the outer ear and external auditory meatus. These impressions 
are used by the manufacturer to create custom-fi tted earmolds or 
in-the-ear hearing aids. The quality of the impression dictates the 
quality of the physical fi t of the hearing instruments.

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  629
The impression-making process is simple and systematic. The fi rst 
step is inspection of the ears and ear canals to ensure that they 
are clear for the introduction of impression material. The inspec-
tion process includes an evaluation of:
the skin of the canals to ensure that no infl ammation exists,
• 
the amount of cerumen in the canals to ensure that it is 
• 
not impacted or will not become impacted as a result of the 
process, and
the tympanic membranes to ensure that they can be visual-
• 
ized and do not have obvious perforations or disease process.
If excessive cerumen is present, it should be removed before pro-
ceeding with ear impressions.
If any concern exists about the condition of the outer-ear struc-
tures, it is prudent to seek a medical opinion before making the 
impression or, on occasion, even medical assistance while making 
the impression.
The next step in the process is to place foam or cotton blocks deep 
into the ear canals to protect the tympanic membranes from im-
pression material. These blocks should have a string attached for 
easy removal. Once the blocks are in place, the ear canals are fi lled 
with impression material. This is soft material that is mixed just 
before it is placed into the ear canals and sets shortly after it is in 
place. After a period of time suffi cient for the material to set, the 
ear impressions are removed from the ears, inspected for quality, 
and shipped to the manufacturer.
The nature of ear impressions is generally the same across ear-
molds and custom hearing aids, with a few exceptions. When ear 
impressions are being made for CIC hearing aids or earmolds for 
profound hearing loss, care must be taken to make very deep im-
pressions of the ear canal.
When ear impressions are being made into earmolds for use with 
behind-the-ear hearing aids, decisions will need to be made about 
the style of earmold, the material to be used, and the style and 
size of  tubing and venting. Earmold materials vary in softness 

630  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
and flexibility. Some materials are nonallergenic. The decision 
on which material to use is usually based on concerns relating 
to comfort and feedback. The decisions to be made on bore size, 
tubing, and venting will impact the frequency gain of the hear-
ing aid (Valente et al., 2000) and must be made with knowledge 
and care.
When ear impressions are being made for in-the-ear hearing 
aids that will have directional microphones, they may need to be 
marked for proper horizontal placement of the microphones.
Quality Control
When hearing aids are received from the manufacturer, they 
should be inspected immediately for the quality of appearance 
and function.
The fi rst step is to look at the hearing aids and assess their appear-
ance. Custom hearing aids or earmolds should be inspected to en-
sure that style, color, and venting are correct. The switches and 
controls should be checked to ensure that the proper ones were 
included and that they function.
Electroacoustic analyses of the hearing aids should be conducted 
to ensure that their output meets design parameters in terms of 
frequency gain, maximum output, and input-output characteris-
tics. In addition, hearing aids are required to meet specifi ed stan-
dards of  performance, including minimum hearing aid circuit 
noise and signal distortion. Measurement of these aspects of per-
formance should be included in any electroacoustic analysis.
A picture of a hearing aid analyzer is shown in Figure 14-2. The 
analyzer contains a test chamber in which the hearing aid is 
placed. The chamber has a loudspeaker to deliver test signals to the 
hearing aid. The hearing aid is placed into a specially designed 2cc 
coupler, which is attached to a microphone. The amplifi ed signal is 
sent to the analyzer, which is a sophisticated sound-level meter.
Hearing aid analyzers are designed to describe the acoustic output 
of a hearing aid in terms of specifi cations of the American National 
Standards Institute’s Standard for Characterizing Hearing Aid 
Performance (ANSI S3.2-2003). The standard electroacoustic 

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  631
analysis of a hearing aid provides information about the hearing 
aid’s gain, maximum output, and frequency response. It also 
provides a measure of circuit noise, distortion, and battery drain. 
The standard analysis runs two frequency response curves, one 
with a 60 dB SPL input and the hearing aid set at what is called 
reference test gain, and the other the output sound pressure level 
with a 90 dB SPL signal (OSPL90) with the volume control in 
its full-on position. Results of this analysis are compared to the 
hearing aid specifi cations provided by the manufacturer to ensure 
that the hearing aid is operating as expected.
Following the electroacoustic analysis, a listening check should be 
performed to rule out excessive circuit noise, intermittency, and 
negative impressions of sound quality. Any controls should also 
be manipulated to ensure that they work and do not add noise to 
the amplifi ed signal as they are changed.
Fitting and Veriﬁ cation
The first step in the fitting process is programming the hearing 
aids. This can be done immediately following the selection appoint-
ment but before the aid is ordered, or it can be done after the hear-
ing aids are received but before the patient arrives for the fi tting 
FIGURE 14-2 Photograph of a hearing-aid analyzer and test box.

632  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
appointment. Most hearing aid manufacturers preprogram the 
devices with their predictions of what will be the best hearing aid 
response for the patient’s hearing loss. Regardless, the audiologist 
will have a number of decisions to make in order to program the 
hearing aids to match what is already known about the patient’s 
communication needs.
Programming is accomplished via computer software that is 
proprietary for each manufacturer. A sample of  two software 
screens from the same manufacturer is shown in Figure 14-3. The 
fi rst screen (A) shows software options to illustrate some general 
categories of programming control. The second screen (B) shows 
the hearing aid response to different levels of input and illustrates 
some of the changes that can be made to the response.

gramming control and (B) hearing aid response curves. (With permission from Phonak)

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  633
The basic response of  the hearing aid will be derived from the 
patient’s audiogram based on a prescriptive target. Manufac-
turers normally use proprietary targets that match the as-
sumptions underlying their signal processing strategy. The 
audiologist can then adjust almost any parameter of  the re-
sponse as needed.
Most interface software is designed to guide the audiologist 
through the decision process. The actual interface can vary 
considerably across manufacturer software programs. Some 
decisions that are to be made are based on patient characteris-
tics, such as age or experience using a hearing aid. For example, 
beginning users seem to benefit initially from less gain than 
might be prescribed for their hearing losses once they adjust to 
the amplifi cation. For experienced users, response settings may 
B

634  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
vary depending on the type of processing used in the past. Other 
decisions that need to be made include:
Program Organization.
• 
 How are the memories or pro-
grams to be organized? Should multiple memories be used, 
or is the patient better off with just two?
Telecoil Preference.
• 
 Should the patient use auto or man-
ual telecoil? Should the telecoil be on both ears or on one ear 
with the other ear on microphone?
Power-on Delay.
• 
 Should the power come on immediately 
or be delayed so that the patient can insert the device with-
out feedback?
Manual Controls.
• 
 Should manual controls be activated or 
deactivated?
Response Review.
• 
 Are the gain response, maximum out-
put, and prescriptive formula appropriate?
The answer to all of these questions and more will depend on the 
style and feature/technology level of the device and on the age, 
hearing loss, experience, and communication needs of the patient.
Once the hearing aid has been programmed, preparation is com-
plete, and the fi tting process with the patient begins.
The fi rst step in the fi tting process with the patient is to assess the 
physical qualities of the devices, including their fi t in the ears, the 
patient’s perception of their appearance, and the patient’s ease in 
manipulating the devices. This should include an assessment of:
security of fi t,
• 
absence of feedback,
• 
appropriateness of microphone location,
• 
physical comfort,
• 
ease of insertion
• 
 and removal,
ease of 
• 
VC rotation, and
overall patient
• 
 manipulation.
Assessment of the physical fi t of the devices is important. They 
should fit securely without excessive patient discomfort, the 
gain should exceed the usable level before feedback occurs, and 
VC = volume control

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  635
the microphones should not be obstructed by any auricular 
structures. If the fi t is not adequate, the hearing aids or earmolds 
can be modifi ed to a certain extent.
Patient comfort with using the devices is equally important. The 
patient should be able to insert and remove the devices without ex-
cessive diffi culty and should be able to operate the controls easily.
Assessment should also be made of the occlusion effect. This can 
be done informally by having the patient speak and describe the 
quality of his or her voice. If the voice sounds hollow or muffl ed, 
alterations will need to be made to reduce the occlusion effect.
The general strategy of fi tting and verifi cation is one of
device programming,
• 
gain verifi cation,
• 
output verifi cation,
• 
feature verifi cation, and
• 
programming adjustment as indicated.
• 
Audiologists use a number of techniques to fi t hearing aids and 
verify their suitability. In general, the process includes placing 
the hearing aids in the patient’s ears, measuring their gain and 
frequency response in the ear canal, adjusting the parameters to 
meet targets, and then asking the patient to make a perceptual as-
sessment of the quality of the hearing experience with the aids.
Real-Ear Veriﬁ cation
The methods used to verify the electroacoustic output of the hear-
ing aids are generally designed to assess whether the targeted 
gains are achieved across the frequency range for a given input to 
the hearing aids. The procedures used to achieve this involve some 
form of real-ear testing, most commonly probe-microphone mea-
surements (for a review, see Mueller et al., 1992; Revit, 2000).
Probe-microphone measurements are made to assess real-ear 
gain characteristics. Figure 14-4 shows a photograph of a probe-
microphone system. The system is a sophisticated spectrum 
analyzer that permits the delivery of various types of signals to a 
The auricular structures are 
the external or outer ear.
Real-ear gain is the 
amount of gain delivered 
to the ear as opposed to a 
coupler; it is measured with 
a probe microphone or by 
functional gain assessment.

636  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
loudspeaker that is placed in proximity to a patient’s ears. A tube is 
inserted into the ear canal down close to the tympanic membrane. 
The other end of the tube is attached to a sensitive microphone. This 
is shown schematically in Figure 14-5. The strategy here is to make 
a measurement that accounts for all of the acoustic alterations that 
occur due to the resonances of a patient’s concha and ear canal and, 
once the hearing aid is in place, the effect of the aid or earmold.
To make a real-ear measurement, speech or speech-like sounds 
are presented through the loudspeaker at a given intensity level, 
FIGURE 14-4 Photograph of a real-ear measurement system. (Photograph

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  637
and measurements are made of sound in the ear canal without 
a hearing aid. The resultant measurement is known as the real-
ear unaided response or gain (REUR/G). The patient’s hear-
ing aid is then placed on the ear and activated, and the same 
sounds are presented. The resultant response from the probe-
microphone is the real-ear aided response or gain (REAR/G). 
The difference between the unaided response and the aided re-
sponse (REAG-REUG) is the real-ear insertion gain (REIG), or 
the amount that the hearing aid adds to the sound measured 
near the tympanic membrane.

Electronics, Inc. Tigard, OR.)

638  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
Strategies for the verifi cation process are numerous. One  successful 
approach is delineated in the accompanying clinical note. The 
basic idea, though, is the same regardless of  the nuances of 
technique. The hearing aid is programmed to amplify sound in a 
manner that is intended to match a target based on the patient’s 
audiometric results. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, modern 
targets are derived from formulas such as NAL-NL1 (Byrne et al., 
2001) and DSL[i/o] (Cornelisse et al., 1995). Speech or speech-
like sounds are played through the hearing aid, and the real-ear 
gain is measured. Usually a low-intensity sound is delivered to 
the hearing aid, and the response is compared to the prescriptive 
target. If the response does not match the target, the hearing aid 
is adjusted until the target is approximated. The process is then 
repeated with average-level signals and high-intensity signals. In 
each case, adjustments are made to the hearing aid, if necessary, 
to achieve the prescriptive target.
Speech Mapping
One clinical approach that combines probe-
 microphone measurement with hearing aid pro-
grammability is known as speech mapping. Here 
are the essentials of the speech mapping process:
• The patient is seated in front of the real-ear 
measurement computer screen, wearing hear-
ing aids, which are coupled to their program-
ming computer, with probe microphones 
placed in both ear canals.
• Ongoing speech is presented via the probe-
microphone system at a ﬁ xed intensity level, 
usually starting with low-intensity speech.
• The output of the probe microphones is dis-
played on the screen as the spectrum of the 
ongoing speech.
• Also displayed on the screen are the patient’s 
 audiogram, loudness discomfort levels, prescrip-
tive targets, and perhaps even a display of the 
speech spectrum at a typical conversational level.

This process results in the verification that the amplified signal 
 being delivered to a patient’s tympanic membrane meets prescrip-
tive targets for different input levels. If the targets are correct, 
then when the patient is wearing the hearing aids, soft sounds 
should be audible, average sounds should be comfortable, and 
loud sounds should be tolerable.
Behavioral Veriﬁ cation
Once the electroacoustic characteristics of the hearing aids are 
verifi ed in the ear canal, the actual quality of the amplifi ed sound 
is assessed with some form of quality or intelligibility judgment 
procedure. This is done simply to verify that the targets achieved 
electroacoustically in the ear canal are, in fact, meeting expecta-
tions perceptually. Perceptual verifi cation is done in a number of 
ways, both informally and formally. Strategies include speech per-
ception judgments, loudness judgment ratings, functional gain 
measurement , and speech-recognition measures.
Speech Perceptual Judgments. Once the parameters of the hear-
ing aids have been set to meet gain and prescriptive targets, the 
patient is often asked to make perceptual judgments about the na-
ture of the amplifi ed speech sound. Judgments are usually made 
along the perceptual dimensions of quality or intelligibility. For 
quality judgments, the patient is presented different speech signals 
and makes judgments about whether the speech sounds natural, 
continued
• With the ongoing ampliﬁ ed speech displayed, 
the audiologist adjusts the appropriate hearing 
aid parameters until the speech map approxi-
mates the prescriptive targets.
• The process is then repeated for a high-inten-
sity level of speech and any necessary adjust-
ments are made.
The advantages of this type of approach are 
numerous (Moore, 2006). The result is that the 
response of the hearing aids, as measured at the 
patient’s eardrum, are in close approximation to 
targeted responses for real speech input.
Clinical Note

640  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
clear, harsh, and so on. The hearing aids are then adjusted until 
the quality of speech is judged to be maximal. For intelligibility 
judgments, the patient is presented different speech signals, often 
in quiet and in noise, and makes judgments about the intelligibil-
ity of speech. The hearing aids are then adjusted until the intel-
ligibility of speech is judged to be acceptable.
Loudness Judgment Ratings. Another behavioral verifi cation strat-
egy that can be used is the determination of loudness judgments as 
a means for ensuring that speech is packaged appropriately within 
a patient’s dynamic range. The goal of loudness judgment ratings 
is to ensure that low-intensity sounds are audible and that high-
intensity sounds are not uncomfortable. Typically, the patient is 
asked to judge loudness for speech or speech-like sounds. The sig-
nals are presented at various intensity levels, and the patient is 
asked to rate the loudness at each level. For example, a speech sig-
nal presented at 45 to 50 dB SPL should be judged as soft, a speech 
signal presented at 60 to 65 dB SPL should be judged as comfort-
able, and speech signal presented at 80 to 85 dB SPL should be 
judged as loud but not uncomfortable. The hearing aids can then 
be adjusted until appropriate aided loudness judgments are ob-
tained for all three presentation levels of the speech signal.
Functional Gain Measurement. One of  the oldest behavioral 
verification strategies measures the hearing aids’ response to 
soft sounds and is known as functional gain. This measurement 
is made by presenting frequency-specifi c signals via loudspeaker 
to the patient. The patient is tested in both unaided and aided 
 conditions in the soundfield. The difference between aided and 
unaided thresholds is functional gain. These gain values are then 
compared to prescriptive target values. The hearing aids are then 
adjusted until the functional gain approximates the prescriptive 
target. Although fraught with measurement and conceptual prob-
lems, functional gain can occasionally be useful in the absence of 
other measures if interpreted carefully.
Speech-Recognition Measurements. Another technique that 
has been used for verifi cation over the years is speech-recogni-
tion measurement. Here, the patient is presented with one of 
several types of  speech materials, such as sentences or mono-
syllabic words, and performance scores are obtained. Testing is 

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  641
usually done in the presence of one or multiple levels of noise or 
competition.
The goal of evaluating speech recognition is to ensure that the pa-
tient is hearing and understanding speech in a manner that meets 
expectations of performance. Performance in absolute terms is 
usually measured against expectations related to a patient’s de-
gree and confi guration of hearing loss. Performance in relative 
terms is usually measured against unaided ability or as a compari-
son of monaural to binaural ability.
A number of strategies have been used over the years to assess 
aided speech-recognition performance. A common approach is to 
present speech signals at a fi xed intensity level from a loudspeaker 
placed in front of a patient, with background competition of some 
kind delivered from a speaker above or behind. Performance in 
recognizing the speech targets is then measured, and the intensity 
level of the competition is varied to assess ability at various target-
to-competition ratios.
Figure 14-6 provides an example of results from this type of speech-
recognition testing. Performance in the monaural aided condition

is compared to the binaural aided condition, and all are compared 
to normal performance. If speech-recognition performance meets 
expectations, then the fi tting is considered to be successful. If not, 
then the hearing aids can be adjusted or alternative amplifi cation 
methods pursued.
Although once a widely used technique, speech-recognition testing 
is seldom used routinely today with a couple of exceptions. One 
remaining benefi t of speech-recognition testing is that performance 
of  monaural hearing aid fitting can be compared to binaural 
fitting, and the ears can be compared to each other. This can be 
important in older patients, who may show marked asymmetry in 
their ability to use hearing aids. Verifi cation with other strategies 
will not reveal this problem. Another exception is the use of speech-
recognition measures for assessing performance with cochlear 
implants. Numerous tests have been developed for evaluating these 
patients, and speech-recognition testing is carried out routinely for 
verifi cation purposes. In addition, speech-recognition measures are 
used by some audiologists in pediatric settings.
ORIENTATION, COUNSELING, AND 
FOLLOW-UP
Following the completion of hearing aid fi tting and verifi cation, a 
hearing aid orientation program is implemented. An orientation 
program consists of informational counseling for both the patient 
and the patient’s family. Topic areas include of the nature of hearing 
and hearing impairment, the components and function of the hear-
ing aids, and care and maintenance of the hearing aids. One of the 
most critical aspects of the hearing aid orientation is a discussion of 
reasonable expectations of hearing aid use and strategies for adapt-
ing to different listening environments. The hearing aid orientation 
program also provides an opportunity to discuss and demonstrate 
other assistive devices that might be of benefi t to the patient.
In some settings, groups of  patients with hearing impairment 
are brought together for orientation. Such groups serve at least 
two important functions. First, they provide a forum for expanded 
dissemination of information to patients and their families. Sec-
ond, they provide a support group that can be very important for 

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  643
sharing experiences and solutions to problems. Regardless of the 
approach that is used, an effective orientation program will re-
sult in a higher likelihood of successful hearing aid use and fewer 
hearing aid returns (Kochkin, 1999).
The orientation process involves the dissemination of information 
on a number of topics and details about the hearing aid, its func-
tion, and its use. Topics that should be covered during the orienta-
tion period include:
features and components,
• 
insertion/removal,
• 
care and cleaning,
• 
storage,
• 
battery management,
• 
telephone use,
• 
feedback, and
• 
warranty information.
• 
It is important for the audiologist to recognize the likely novelty of 
this information and provide the patient with as much in the way 
of handout material as possible. In addition to the manufactur-
er’s manual for the hearing aids, the audiologists should provide 
written instructions on use and routine maintenance, including 
troubleshooting guidelines.
The orientation also provides an excellent opportunity to educate 
the patient and family about successful communication strategies 
for those with hearing impairment. Information about manipula-
tion of the acoustic environment for favorable listening and infor-
mation about how to speak clearly and effectively to those with 
hearing impairment will be invaluable to both patient and family.
During the orientation, the patient should also be familiarized 
with other assistive devices that might be valuable for his or her 
communication needs. Familiarity with telephone amplifiers 
and remote microphone systems will provide patients with a 
perspective on the options that are available to them beyond their 
hearing aids. It is also a good opportunity to inform patients about 
the public facilities that may be available to them such as group 

644  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
amplifi cation for theaters and churches. Patients will also benefi t 
from an understanding of any community resources that might 
be accessible to them.
The patient should also be counseled that the ultimate benefi t they 
will receive from the hearing aids might not be immediately appar-
ent. The patient is likely to experience some benefi cial adaptation 
to the hearing aids following a period of adjustment (Horowitz & 
Turner, 1997).
Perhaps one of the most valuable discussions to have with the 
patient is about reasonable expectations regarding the hearing 
aids. Actually, the setting of expectations is an ongoing process. It 
should begin the moment that the patient is being told that he or 
she is a candidate for hearing aids and continue throughout the 
entire hearing aid process.
If a patient expects hearing aids to restore hearing to normal simi-
lar to the way that eyeglasses restore vision to normal, then that 
patient may be disappointed with the hearing aids that you have 
worked so hard to get just right. Hearing aids amplify sound. Some 
hearing aids amplify sounds extremely well. Regardless, the sound 
is being delivered to an ear that is impaired, and amplifi ed sound 
cannot correct the impairment. If a patient has a reasonable un-
derstanding of that, and his or her expectations are in line with 
that understanding, then the prognosis for successful hearing aid 
use is good. Conversely, if patient expectations are unreasonable, 
the prognosis is guarded at best.
Patients should have the following expectations from hearing aid 
amplifi cation:
acceptable hearing in most listening
• 
 environments,
communication to improve but
• 
 not be perfect,
environmental sounds to not
• 
 be uncomfortably loud,
feedback-free amplifi cation,
• 
that hearing aids are
• 
 visible to some degree,
reasonable physical comfort but
• 
 not tactile transparency,
more benefi t in quiet than
• 
 in noise, and
that background noise will
• 
 be amplifi ed.

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  645
These expectations should be reviewed at the time of follow-up. If 
they are not being met, the hearing aids probably need to be ad-
justed. If they are being met and the patient accepts them as rea-
sonable, the likelihood is that the patient will be a satisfi ed hearing 
aid wearer.
At the end of the orientation and counseling session, patients are 
scheduled for a follow-up visit, usually within 30 days of the hear-
ing aid fi tting. At the follow-up appointment, the audiologist and 
patient review benefi t from and satisfaction with the hearing aids 
and make any necessary adjustments to them. It is often at this 
follow-up that the outcome measures are made to ensure that the 
patient’s communication needs are being met and to help in the 
planning of any additional rehabilitative services.
ASSESSING OUTCOMES
Outcome validation is important in the provision of any aspect 
of health care. Hearing aid treatment is no exception. It is com-
mon practice to evaluate the success of hearing aid fi tting at some 
point after the patient has had an opportunity to wear and adjust 
to the use of his or her hearing devices.
Validating the outcome of hearing aid fi tting means asking if the 
treatment, in this case hearing aid use, is doing what it is sup-
posed to do. To an extent, we have already provided some valida-
tion in the verifi cation process by ensuring that the hearing aid 
is producing the type of acoustic response that it is supposed to 
produce. But that is really only part of the story.
The goal of the hearing treatment process is to reduce the com-
munication disorder imposed by a hearing loss. We generally de-
fi ne success at reaching this goal in terms of whether the patient 
understands speech better with the hearing aids and whether the 
hearing aids help to reduce the handicapping infl uence of hear-
ing impairment. The best way to understand if this success has 
been achieved is to ask the patient.
Outcome measures are designed to assess the impact of hearing 
aid amplifi cation on self-perception of communication success. 
Results from self-assessment scales administered after amplifi cation 

646  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
use can be compared to pretreatment results to assess whether 
the hearing aids have had an impact on communication ability. 
Similarly, assessment can be done by spouses or others to verify 
the success of the treatment approach.
In Chapter 12, you learned about the self-assessment measures 
aimed at defining communication needs. Measures such as the 
Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE) (Ventry & 
Weinstein, 1982), the Abbreviated Profi le of Hearing Aid Benefi t 
(APHAB) (Cox & Alexander, 1995), and the Client Oriented Scale 
of Improvement (COSI) (Dillon et al., 1997) seek to defi ne patients’ 
perceptions of their own hearing ability and challenges in various 
listening situations. If these measures are given prior to hearing aid 
fi tting and then again at follow-up, results can be used as validation 
of treatment success. Figure 14-7 shows results from a patient on 
the APHAB. Here, pre- and post-fi tting results show a signifi cant 
improvement in hearing in three of four measurement categories.

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  647
They also show that in one category, aversiveness, the patient does 
not perceive improvement. The audiologist will work with the pa-
tient and the hearing aids to address this listening situation.
In addition to these self-assessment measures of communication 
needs, it is often useful to measure quality-of-life issues to determine 
how the addition of hearing aid amplifi cation is impacting overall 
well-being. Measures such as the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefi t Pro-
fi le (GHABP) (Gatehouse, 1999) and the International Outcome In-
ventory – Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) (Cox & Alexander, 2002) can help 
to measure the impact of audiologic treatment on quality of life.
Self-assessment validation of treatment outcome is a valuable way 
to measure success in the audiologic management process. Once 
these measures have been made and discussed with the patient, 
the audiologist then evaluates the need for any additional reha-
bilitative services for the patient.
POST-FITTING REHABILITATION
For many adult patients, the proper fi tting of appropriate hear-
ing aid amplifi cation, accompanied by effective orientation and 
follow-up, constitutes enough management to suffi ciently amelio-
rate their communication disorders. For others, however, hearing 
aid fi tting represents only the beginning of the process (for a com-
prehensive overview, see Tye-Murray, 2004).
Post-fi tting rehabilitation for adults may involve auditory training to 
maximize the use of residual hearing and speechreading training to 
maximize use of the visual channel to assist in the communication 
process. Post-fi tting rehabilitation for children is usually much more 
protracted. It often involves language stimulation, speech therapy, 
auditory training, and extensive educational programming.
Auditory Training and Speechreading
Auditory training and speechreading are treatment methods that 
are sometimes used following the dispensing of hearing aids. Audi-
tory training programs are designed to bring awareness to the hear-
ing task and to improve listening skills. Extensive focus is placed on 
maximizing the use of residual auditory function. Auditory training 

648  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
programs typically include structured exercises in speech detection, 
discrimination, identifi cation, and comprehension.
Speechreading programs are designed to enhance the skills of pa-
tients in supplementing auditory input with information that can 
be gained from lip movements and facial expressions.
Auditory training and speechreading services are provided in several 
different ways. Individual therapy sessions are a common fi rst step in 
the process. Group training has also proven to be valuable and gives 
patients the extra benefi t of supportive camaraderie. In addition to 
these approaches, computer-based home training programs have 
been developed for self-paced learning (Sweetow, 2005).
Educational Programming
The goal of any treatment program for children is to ensure op-
timal acquisition of speech and language. In children with mild 
hearing sensitivity losses, such a goal can be accomplished with 
careful fi tting of hearing aids, good orientation of parents to hear-
ing loss and hearing aids, and very careful attention to speech and 
language stimulation during the formative years. For more severe 
hearing losses the task is more diffi cult, and the decisions are more 
challenging.
For many years there has been controversy about the best 
method of  communication development training for children 
with severe and profound hearing losses. One school of thought 
champions the oral approach, in which the child is fi tted with 
hearing aids or a cochlear implant and undergoes very inten-
sive training in oral/aural communication. The goal is to help 
the child to develop oral skills that will allow for a mainstreamed 
education and lifestyle. Another school of thought champions 
the manual approach. The manual approach teaches the child 
sign language as the method of communication. The goal is to 
help the child develop language through a sensory system that 
is not impaired. Yet another school of  thought champions the 
idea of combining oral and manual communication in a total 
approach. The total approach emphasizes language develop-
ment without regard to the sensory system. This approach seeks 
to maximize both language learning and oral communication.
The oral approach is a 
method of communication 
that involves the use of 
verbal communication and 
residual hearing.
The manual approach is 
a method of communication 
that involves the use of 
ﬁ ngerspelling and sign 
language.
The total approach is a 
method of communication 
that incorporates both the 
oral and manual approaches.

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  649
Although the topic of education of the children with deafness has 
always been controversial, the tone of the discussion has changed 
in recent years with the advent of cochlear implantation. Implants 
are proving to be a successful alternative to conventional hearing 
aid use, particularly in terms of ease of learning language.
Regardless of the habilitation strategy, the most important com-
ponent of  a rehabilitation program is early identification and 
early intervention. The sooner a child is identifi ed, the sooner the 
channels of communication required for language development 
can be opened.
Summary
Hearing aids are selected and fitted based on an individual’s 
• 
communication needs, degree of  hearing loss, audiometric 
confi guration, and loudness discomfort levels.
The fi tting process usually begins with making impressions of 
• 
the outer ear and external auditory meatus. These impressions 
are used by the manufacturer to create custom-fi tted earmolds 
or in-the-ear hearing aids.
When hearing aids are received from the manufacturer, they 
• 
should be inspected immediately for the quality of appearance 
and tested for function.
The fi rst step in the fi tting process with the patient is to assess 
• 
the physical qualities of the devices, including their fi t in the 
ears, the patient’s perception of their appearance, and the pa-
tient’s ease in manipulating the devices.
The general strategy of fi tting and verifi cation is one of assess-
• 
ing the gain and frequency parameters, making adjustments, 
verifying that the responses meet targets, and verifying that the 
aids meet some defi ned perceptual expectations.
Verifi cation of the frequency response is usually made by probe-
• 
microphone measurement. A small microphone is placed near 
the tympanic membrane, and the responses of the hearing aids 
to sounds of various frequencies and intensities are determined.
Following verifi cation, a hearing aid orientation program is im-
• 
plemented, which consists of informational counseling about 

650  CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS
the nature of hearing and hearing impairment, the components 
and function of the hearing aids, and care and maintenance of 
the hearing aids.
One of the most critical aspects of the hearing aid orientation is 
• 
a discussion of reasonable expectations of hearing aid use and 
strategies for adapting to different listening environments.
It is common practice to evaluate the success of hearing aid fi t-
• 
ting after the patient has had an opportunity to wear and ad-
just to the use of the devices.
Success is usually defi ned by whether hearing aids are satisfac-
• 
tory in terms of fi t and function and whether they provide com-
munication benefi t and enhance quality of life.
Post-fi tting rehabilitation for adults involves auditory training 
• 
and speechreading training.
Post-fi tting rehabilitation for children involves language stimu-
• 
lation, speech therapy, auditory training, and extensive educa-
tional programming.
Short Answer Questions
 1. The 
 
 of a hearing aid is the 
amount of gain that a hearing aid should provide, based on 
the individual’s hearing loss.
 2. A 
-based prescriptive method specifi es the 
frequency gain characteristics that will amplify average 
conversational speech to a comfortable or preferred listening 
level. One commonly used method is the 
 
 Laboratory (NAL) method.
 3. Other prescriptive methods are based on both threshold 
and 
 levels. The 
 
 
 (DSL) formula is an example of this type of 
method.
 4. Additional considerations for determining prescriptive gain 
targets include the type of hearing loss, whether there is a 
 component to the hearing loss, and whether 
 or monaural hearing aids are used.
 5. One decision to be made regarding hearing aid selection 
is the 
 of the hearing aid. This choice may be 

CHAPTER 14  THE AUDIOLOGIC TREATMENT PROCESS  651
limited based on degree and confi guration of the hearing 
loss, patient dexterity, and patient preference.
 6. Another decision to be made regarding hearing aid selection 
is the 
 level of the hearing aid. These choices of 
technology options offered to patients are often divided into 
basic, 
, and advanced levels of technology, which 
provide progressively greater features for the hearing aid user.
 7. An 
 
 is taken for a patient to 
create custom-made hearing aids or earmolds. This is 
accomplished by placing a foam or cotton 
 
into a visually clear ear canal. Impression material is 
then injected into the ear canal and allowed to set. The 
impression is then sent to the manufacturer.
 8. Upon receipt of a hearing aid from a manufacturer,
 
 is often performed to determine 
appropriate output from the hearing aid.
 9. Hearing instrument 
  is accomplished using 
computer software that is proprietary for each manufacturer.
 10. In addition to prescriptive gain, programming includes ma-
nipulation of factors, including 
 organization, 
telecoil preference, use of 
-on delay, and use of 
manual controls.

 measures allows for 
electroacoustic assessment of the characteristics of a hear-

656  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
ALTHOUGH the overall goal of any audiologic treatment strat-
egy is to reduce hearing impairment by maximizing the auditory 
system’s access to sound, the approach used to reach that goal can 
vary across patients. The approach chosen to evaluate and fi t hear-
ing aids and/or other devices is sometimes related to patient fac-
tors such as age, sometimes to type of hearing disorder, and other 
times to communication needs. For example, the strategy used for 
an adult patient with a sensorineural hearing impairment is con-
siderably different from that used for a child with auditory process-
ing disorder. In the former, emphasis is placed on matching gain 
targets; in the latter, emphasis is placed on remote-microphone 
strategies. Within these broad categories, the approach may also 
vary depending on a patient’s age. For example, achieving hearing 
aid success in a geriatric patient may require a different approach 
than that used in a 20-year-old. Finally, there are patients with se-
vere and profound hearing loss who benefi t from cochlear implan-
tation, which requires an altogether different approach to fi tting.
Although audiologic treatment must be adapted to the needs and ex-
pectations of individual patients, several broad categories of patients 
present common challenges that can be approached in a similar 
clinical manner. These categories include adults with sensorineural 
hearing loss, aging patients, children with sensorineural hearing 
loss, children with APD, patients with conductive hearing loss, and 
patients with severe to profound hearing loss.

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  657
ADULT POPULATIONS
Adult Sensorineural Hearing Loss
Treatment Goals
The challenges of fi tting hearing aids to adults with sensorineu-
ral hearing impairment are, of course, related to the diffi culties 
that sensorineural hearing losses cause. To review, sensorineu-
ral hearing loss results in the following problems, to a greater or 
lesser extent:
loss of hearing sensitivity, so that soft sounds need to be am-
• 
plifi ed to become audible;
sensitivity loss that varies with frequency and is generally 
• 
greater in the higher frequencies;
reduced dynamic range from the threshold of sensitivity to 
• 
the threshold of discomfort;
nonlinearity of loudness growth;
• 
diminished speech-recognition ability, usually propor-
• 
tionate to the degree and configuration of the sensitivity 
loss; and
reduced ability to hear speech in background noise.
• 
Hearing aid amplifi cation, then, is targeted at these manifesta-
tions of sensorineural hearing loss. A hearing aid must amplify 
soft sounds to a level of audibility; must “package” the range of 
sound so that soft sounds are audible and loud sounds are not 
uncomfortable; must limit the maximum output to avoid dis-
comfort; must reproduce sound faithfully, without distortion, to 
ensure adequate speech perception; and must do so in a man-
ner that maintains or enhances the relation of the signal to the 
background noise.
Treatment Strategies
Adult patients with sensorineural hearing impairment tend to 
be both easy and challenging in terms of hearing aid selection 
and fi tting—easy because they are cooperative and can provide 
insightful feedback throughout the fi tting process and challeng-
ing because there is not much to limit the audiologist’s options. 

658  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Following are general guidelines for fi tting adults. The most im-
portant variables in this population are the degree and confi gu-
ration of hearing loss.
Hearing Aid Selection. The adult patient should be fitted with 
binaural hearing aids, unless contraindicated clinically or because 
of some substantial ear asymmetries. Most adults who are new to 
hearing aids believe that they prefer custom in-the-ear devices. 
When they are introduced to modern behind-the-ear technology, 
many are surprised by the style and appearance of newer devices. 
This seems especially true of newer open-canal BTEs. Although 
most features are available in most styles of  hearing aids, BTE 
hearing aids are the choice of many audiologists due to issues per-
taining to feedback and especially to maintenance and durability. 
Most patients with sensorineural hearing loss will benefi t from so-
phisticated compression strategies. Occasionally, long-term hear-
ing aid users will crave more gain that is linear in nature. Except 
with deep CIC fi ttings, patients will likely benefi t from adding back 
some directionality that is lost due to relocating the microphone 
from the tympanic membrane.
Hearing Aid Fitting and Verification. Gain targets should be 
matched and verified with probe-microphone measurements. 
Loudness judgments can be obtained reliably in adults and can 
be used to verify that soft sounds are audible and loud sounds 
not uncomfortable. Finally, verifi cation can be confi rmed in adult 
patients with sensorineural hearing loss with speech quality or 
speech intelligibility judgments.
Outcome Measurement. Self-assessment scales will be useful in 
pre- and post-fi tting assessment of communication abilities and 
needs. It is often helpful to address issues related to both hearing 
ability and quality of life when measuring outcomes.
Rehabilitation Treatment Plan. The treatment plan is usually 
uncomplicated in adult patients and consists of  thorough 
orientation and follow-up to fi ne tune the hearing aid’s functioning. 
Some patients, especially those with signifi cant hearing loss and 
communication demands, will benefit from hearing assistive 
technology, including the use of telephone amplifi ers and personal 
FM systems.

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  659
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 15-1 is a patient with a long-standing sen-
sorineural hearing impairment. The patient is a 54-year-old man 
with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss that has progressed 
slowly over the past 20 years. He has a positive history of noise 
exposure, fi rst during military service and then at his workplace. 
The patient reports that he has used hearing protection on occa-
sion in the past but has not done so on a consistent basis. In addi-
tion, there is a family history of hearing loss occurring in middle 
age. He was having his hearing tested at the urging of  family 
members who were having increasing diffi culty communicating 
with him.
An audiologic assessment revealed normal middle-ear function, a 
bilateral, fairly symmetric, high-frequency sensorineural hearing 
loss, and speech-recognition ability consistent with the degree of 
hearing loss.
A treatment assessment showed that the patient has signifi cant 
communication needs at work. Results of a communication needs 
assessment showed that he has communication problems a signif-
icant proportion of the time that he spends in certain listening en-
vironments, especially those involving background noise. He has 
no motoric and other physical disabilities and is fi nancially able to 
pursue hearing aid use. The patient expressed a preference for the 
“computerized hearing aids that are invisible in the ear.”
Based on the patient’s audiogram, it was determined that 
completely in-the-canal hearing aids should be appropriate for 
his degree and confi guration of hearing loss. His hearing loss is 
good enough in the high frequencies that suffi cient gain should be 
achievable without feedback issues. His hearing loss is bad enough 
in the low frequencies that he will benefi t from low-frequency gain 
and not require any sort of open-fi t strategy. Figure 15-1A shows 
the audiogram from each ear superimposed on the fi tting range 
of the hearing aid that was selected. Other than his preference for 
CICs, he had no real interest in advanced technology and was fairly 
price conscious about the devices. A basic feature/ technology 
level was chosen as a starting point. Ear impressions were made, 
and the hearing aids were ordered.

660  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
After the hearing aids were programmed, real-ear assessment of 
the output of the hearing aid was made with probe-microphone 
measurements. Figure 15-1B shows the responses of the right-ear 
hearing aid to three levels of input signals and how they compare 
to a targeted frequency gain. Verifi cation of the fi tting was made 
by asking the patient to judge the loudness  of speech presented 
at 45, 65, and 85 dB SPL. Adjustments were made to ensure that 
the patient heard the speech as soft, moderate, and loud, but not 
too loud.

sensorineural hearing loss. Pure-tone thresholds (A) are superimposed on the ﬁ tting 
range of the selected hearing aids. Probe-microphone measurements (B) from the

Outcome measurements were made after 1 month of hearing aid 
use. The self-assessment scale that was given at the time of the ini-
tial treatment assessment was readministered. Results were com-
pared to the earlier evaluation and showed that communication 
problems were reduced for him in most listening environments 
with the hearing aids.
Geriatric Sensorineural Hearing Loss
Treatment Goals
Hearing loss that occurs with aging is not necessarily different than 
that which occurs in younger adults. In some older patients, how-
ever, the sensitivity loss is confounded by changes in central audi-
tory nervous system function. As a consequence, in addition to the 
problems described above, hearing impairment may result in:
signifi cant reduction in ability to hear speech in background 
• 
noise;
diminished ability to use two ears for sound localization and 
• 
for separation of signals from noise; and
reduced 
• 
temporal processing of auditory information.
The ability of the auditory 
system to deal with timing 
aspects of sound is called 
temporal processing.

662  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Hearing aid amplifi cation, then, must be targeted either to overcome 
these problems or to reduce the impact of their influence. When 
fi tting hearing aids on older patients, the audiologist must remember 
that sound emanating from the hearing devices needs to be processed 
by the auditory nervous system. When the nervous system is intact, 
the hearing devices need to overcome the peripheral cochlear defi cit. 
However, as people age, so too do their auditory nervous systems, and 
this aging process is not without consequences. Audiologists are often 
confronted in the clinic with the impact of the aging auditory nervous 
system on hearing ability in general and on conventional hearing 
device use in particular. It appears that patients with demonstrable 
deficits from senescent changes in the auditory nervous system 
do not benefi t as much from conventional hearing devices as their 
younger counterparts (for a review, see Stach, 2000).
Treatment Strategies
Clinical experience with older people suggests that the more that 
can be done to ease the burden of listening in background noise, 
whether by sophisticated directional microphones and noise-
reduction processing in an ear-level hearing device or by use of a 
remote microphone, the more likely the patient will benefi t from 
hearing-device amplification. Another important challenge in 
fi tting hearing aids in older individuals is the diffi culty involved in 
the physical manipulation of the device.
Hearing Aid Selection. The technical advances designed to en-
hance signal-to-noise ratio are, of course, no different for the el-
derly than for younger patients, but their application is probably 
more important. The use of binaural hearing aids, directional mi-
crophones, and advanced signal processing appear to be key ele-
ments in successful fi tting. Gain and output characteristics should 
be similar to those prescribed for younger adults.
Choice of the style of hearing aids can be infl uenced by dexterity 
issues. For some older patients, ITE hearing aids are easier to insert 
and extract than BTE hearing aids with a custom earmold. On the 
other hand, the smaller the ITE device and its battery, the harder 
it is for some older patients to manipulate. Most ITE devices can be 
ordered with an extraction handle, which can be quite helpful to a 
patient with limited fi ne-motor control.
Senescent changes are 
changes that occur due to 
the aging process.

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  663
Remote controls can be quite useful to some older patients with 
poor dexterity but a burden to others who are not technologi-
cally oriented or who have diffi culty remembering where they 
place things.
Although binaural hearing aids are indicated in most cases, some 
older individuals have signifi cant ear asymmetries in speech per-
ception and cannot successfully wear two hearing aids. In fact, in 
some rare cases, fi tting a hearing aid on the poorly functioning 
ear can make binaural ability with hearing aids poorer than the 
best monaural performance.
Hearing Aid Fitting and Veriﬁ cation. As in younger adults, gain 
targets should be verifi ed with probe-microphone measurements. 
Loudness judgments can be obtained reliably in most older patients 
and can be used to verify that soft sounds are audible and loud 
sounds not uncomfortable. Finally, verifi cation can be confi rmed 
in many older adult patients with sensorineural hearing loss with 
speech quality or speech intelligibility judgments. However, this 
can be a diffi cult perceptual task for some older listeners, who may 
have diffi culty assigning a quality or intelligibility ranking.
Aided speech-recognition testing may also be helpful in some 
older patients to help determine if both ears can be aided effec-
tively. Here a comparison should be made of right monaural, left 
monaural, and binaural speech-recognition ability. If binaural 
ability is poorer than the best monaural ability, then consideration 
should be given to fi tting only one hearing aid. This, however, will 
be the exception rather than the rule. 
Outcome Measurement. A self-assessment scale should prove 
useful in pre- and post-fi tting assessment of communication abili-
ties and need. Assessment by a spouse or signifi cant other can also 
be quite useful in this age range.
Rehabilitation Treatment Plan. Despite all of the technical ad-
vances in conventional hearing aids, some older people cannot 
make use of  conventional hearing aids. In such cases, the use 
of remote-microphone technology for the enhancement of the 
signal-to-noise ratio has been a successful approach. Many audi-
ologists believe that it is good practice to familiarize older patients 

664  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
with personal FM systems and other ALDs during the orientation 
process so that if hearing aid benefi t declines, they will be aware of 
an alternative solution to their hearing problems.
Older patients may also benefi t from various forms of group or in-
dividual aural rehabilitation and speechreading classes. They may 
also fi nd value in the home programs developed to help them ad-
dress their communication needs.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 15-2 is an older patient with a long-standing sen-
sorineural hearing loss. The patient is a 70-year-old woman with 
bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment that has progressed 
slowly over the last 10 years.
An audiological assessment revealed normal middle-ear function 
and a bilateral, symmetric, sloping, sensorineural hearing loss.
Speech recognition ability is reduced in comparison to that which 
would be expected from the hearing loss. Word recognition in 
quiet was predictable, with maximum scores of 80% on the right 
ear and 76% on the left, but hearing in competition was reduced. 
Maximum scores for a measure of sentences in competition are 
only 50% on the right ear and 40% on the left ear. In addition, her 
dichotic performance showed a mild defi cit with scores of 70% on 
the left ear and 100% on the right. These results are not unusual 
for someone who is 70 years old and may contribute as much to 
her hearing diffi culties as the sensitivity loss.
A treatment assessment revealed that this was a very active older 
woman who participated in a number of activities in her life that 
created signifi cant communication demands. She served on the 
volunteer boards of a number of civic and charitable organiza-
tions. She was seen often on the society page of the newspaper at 
charity functions. She was a patron of the arts, with a particular 
fondness for the orchestra. She was beginning to feel embarrassed 
about her hearing loss and having to ask people to repeat them-
selves. She felt as if she were missing a lot of conversations at din-
ners. She also felt as if her hearing loss was making her appear 
old, a condition in which she had no interest. She felt as if she was 

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  665
able to hear well in quiet but had communication problems a sig-
nifi cant proportion of the time in noisy environments. She did not 
have fi nancial concerns over the costs of technology.
The first step in the selection process was to demonstrate to her 
how inconspicuous BTE hearing aids could be with her current 
hairstyle. Once that barrier was crossed, binaural hearing aids were 
chosen at the highest feature/technology level. Figure 15-2 shows 
the audiogram from each ear superimposed on the fitting range

of the hearing aids that were selected. The hearing aids included 
a wireless technology solution that allowed the instruments to 
communicate with each other and with other electronic devices, 
such as mobile phones, computers, and personal music players. The 
binaural communication technology is designed to improve spatial 
hearing and to deliver high fi delity sound in a realistic way.
Following programming of the devices, frequency gain was ad-
justed by measuring real-ear responses with a probe microphone to 
targets for soft and loud sounds. Loudness, quality, and intelligibil-
ity ratings were then made of speech signals and the gain adjusted 
slightly. Because of her dichotic defi cit, speech recognition was mea-
sured in the soundfi eld. Sentences were presented from a speaker 
in front and speech competition from behind. Results showed a 
slightly reduced performance on the left monaural condition, but a 
slight enhancement binaurally. These results suggested that the left 
ear was not interfering with her binaural ability.
Because of the wireless capability of the hearing aids, the patient 
was introduced to the ways her hearing aids could be connected to 
external electronic signals and to remote microphone technology. 
The patient seemed to enjoy the gadgetry and thought she might 
have the perfect purse for the remote microphone.
Outcome measures were given after one month of hearing aid use 
by re-administering the self-assessment scale that was given at the 
time of her hearing aid selection. Results showed that her com-
munication problems, particularly those in noise, were reduced 
signifi cantly. She reported using her hearing aids without the re-
mote microphone a signifi cant portion of the time but that she 
would use the microphone discretely in certain listening environ-
ments. She also thought that the interface to her car navigation 
system was particularly useful.
PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS
Pediatric Sensorineural Hearing Loss
Treatment Goals
The rehabilitative goal for young children is to maximize the au-
ditory system’s access to sound to ensure the best possible hear-
ing for the development of oral language and speech. The specifi c 

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  667
aims are to provide the best amplifi cation possible, supplemented 
with hearing assistive technology when indicated, and to provide 
maximum exposure to language stimulation opportunities.
Hearing impairment in children results in the following problems:
loss of hearing sensitivity, so that soft sounds need to be am-
• 
plifi ed to become audible;
degree of sensitivity loss that varies with frequency and is 
• 
generally greater in the higher frequencies;
reduced dynamic range from the threshold of sensitivity to 
• 
the threshold of discomfort; and
nonlinearity of loudness growth.
• 
You will notice immediately that these are the same problems 
faced by adults. Thus, in meeting the specifi c aim related to hear-
ing aids, the actual hearing loss challenges are not different than 
those of adults. That is, sensorineural hearing loss in young chil-
dren is essentially the same as sensorineural hearing loss in adults. 
That may well be where the similarity ends.
Treatment Strategies
Hearing aid selection and fi tting in children with sensorineural 
hearing impairment is a challenging business for various reasons 
(for a review, see Lewis, 2000). What makes children different? 
Well, for one, they are smaller and, for two, their smallness 
changes. The size of their ear canals results in a smaller volume 
of  space between the end of  the earmold or hearing aid and 
the tympanic membrane. This results in higher sound pressure 
levels than in adults. Children also have different resonance 
characteristics. These physical factors must be accounted for as 
they change over time.
Another thing that makes children different is that the informa-
tion we have about their hearing loss and ability may be known 
only generally at the beginning of the fi tting process. Audiograms 
may simply be estimates of degree and confi guration of the loss 
based on auditory evoked potential results. And we are unlikely to 
have any sense of discomfort levels through the fi rst few years of 
life. Children are also less likely or able to participate in the selec-
tion and fi tting process.

668  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Regarding the actual hearing devices, there are at least three factors 
that must be considered. First, children probably need undistorted 
auditory input more than anyone because they are learning speech 
and language. Whereas adult knowledge of speech and language 
can fi ll in for missing or distorted input, children learning language 
through the auditory system have no linguistic basis for doing so. 
Second, children cannot manipulate their hearing aids in the same 
way that adults can, and they can’t control their listening environ-
ment. Third, hearing may be more variable in young children due 
to progression or to fl uctuation secondary to otitis media.
All of these factors must be considered in the approach taken to 
hearing aid amplifi cation in children. Following are general guide-
lines for fi tting children.
Hearing Aid Selection. Children should always be fi tted with bin-
aural hearing aids unless contraindicated by medical factors or 
extreme hearing asymmetries. The goal is to maximize residual 
hearing, and two ears will accomplish that better than one. 
Because the auricle and ear canal grow in size, the custom part of 
the hearing aid will need to be changed frequently while the child 
is young. As a result, most audiologists choose to fi t BTE hearing 
aids and change the earmolds as indicated rather than having 
an ITE case changed. Soft materials should be used for earmolds, 
and the earmolds should be connected to pediatric earhooks for 
proper fi tting. 
Flexibility in the fi tting range of hearing devices is necessary for 
young children for at least three reasons. First, the degree and 
confi guration of hearing loss may be known only generally at the 
beginning of the fi tting process. The fi nal frequency gain charac-
teristics may only resemble those tried initially. Second, hearing is 
likely to fl uctuate if the child has bouts of otitis media with effu-
sion, and fl exibility again will be required. Third, hearing loss can 
be progressive in children, and the more fl exible the fi tting range, 
the more likely the hearing aids can be adjusted to some extent to 
keep up with the changes.
Gain and output characteristics should be similar to those in 
adults, but targets may be more diffi cult to determine because of 

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  669
limited audiometric data. Fortunately, algorithms have been de-
veloped to predict targets for frequency-specifi c gain to low-level 
and high-level input from audiometric data of children.
Another consideration for selecting hearing devices for chil-
dren is the capacity for access to the devices from remote mi-
crophones and other sources. Direct audio input, telecoils, and 
other wireless techniques are important for classroom and other 
listening environments.
One other consideration is the use of directional microphones. 
Because children are normally fi tted with BTE hearing aids, they 
necessarily lose some of their natural directionality when the mi-
crophone is moved from the tympanic membrane to the side of 
the head. Although directional microphone use in children has 
been controversial over the years, it seems intuitively appealing to 
want to give them back some of the lost directionality.
Hearing Aid Fitting and Veriﬁ cation. Fitting challenges start with 
the making of earmold impressions. The audiologist who is think-
ing ahead will make ear impressions while the child is undergoing 
ABR verifi cation of hearing loss and is sleeping or sedated. Other-
wise, the making of ear impressions in young children can be as 
much a matter of will as of technical ability.
Prescriptive targets have been developed for children. An example is 
the DSL[i/o] approach described in the previous chapter. Just as in 
adults, these targets can be verifi ed by probe-microphone measure-
ments. The case can easily be made that such measures are even 
more critical in children due to their ear canal size and variabil-
ity. Again, the challenge here is usually not the measurement, but 
maintaining the child’s cooperative spirit during the procedure.
It is not uncommon in pediatric fi tting to verify with functional 
gain measures. Functional gain targets for children have been es-
timated from threshold data and can be used to serve as a guide-
line for fi tting verifi cation. As children get older, comfort levels can 
be estimated similarly.
It is also not uncommon to measure speech recognition with 
the hearing aids. The procedure is not unlike that used in adults, 

670  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
wherein speech targets can be presented in the presence of back-
ground competition and the child attempts to identify the speech, 
usually through a picture pointing task. Aided results can be com-
pared to unaided results and to expectations for normal hearing 
ability under similar circumstances.
Outcome Measures. Validation of the success of hearing aid fi t-
ting depends on directed observation of hearing ability by parents, 
teachers, therapists, and audiologists. Outcome measurement 
scales have been developed for assessing hearing aid success in 
children (for a complete review, see Johnson & Danhauer, 2002). 
Examples include the Family Expectation Worksheet (Palmer & 
Mormer, 1997) and Children’s Outcome Worksheets (COWs). 
These measures identify children’s communication needs and are 
administered before hearing aid fi tting and periodically thereafter 
as a method of validating the amplifi cation success.
Rehabilitation Treatment Plan. Once the hearing aid has been fi t-
ted, treatment begins. Depending on the degree of hearing loss, 
intensive auditory training, language stimulation, and speech 
therapy are introduced in an effort to maximize language devel-
opment (for an overview, see Clark, 2007; Cole & Flexer, 2007).
Children are likely to use remote-microphone systems in class-
rooms at school, and proper fi tting and orientation are impera-
tive. Many parents fi nd that supplemental use of an FM system at 
home can greatly enhance the language stimulation opportuni-
ties as well.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 15-3 is a young child with a fl uctuating, mild-to-
severe sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally. The patient is a 4-year-
old girl. She is enrolled in speech-language therapy for receptive 
language delay and articulation disorder. The hearing impairment 
appears to be caused by CMV or cytomegalic inclusion disease, a 
viral infection usually transmitted in utero. There is no family his-
tory of hearing loss and no other signifi cant medical history.
An audiological evaluation shows normal middle-ear function; 
a bilateral, mild-to-severe, sensorineural hearing loss; and 

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  671
speech-recognition ability that is congruous with the degree and 
confi guration of hearing loss. Results are shown in Figure 15-3A.
The child’s age and the fluctuating nature of  the hearing loss 
were two major factors in the decision about type of amplifi cation 
device to use. The decision was made to fi t the child with binaural 
hearing aids, because nothing about her ears or hearing loss con-
traindicated the use of two devices. BTEs were chosen based on 
FIGURE 15-3 Hearing and hearing-aid consultation results in a 4-year-old child with hearing loss sec-
ondary to CMV infection. Pure-tone and speech audiometric results (A) show bilateral 
mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss and speech-recognition ability consistent with 
the loss. Aided speech-recognition results (B) show appropriate aided performance.

the practicality of replacing earmolds as her ears grow. Devices 
were chosen that have a wide fi tting range to permit changes in 
case her hearing loss continues to fl uctuate or progress.
With regard to the other characteristics of the hearing aid, a de-
cision was made to use directional microphones in an effort to 
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of sounds emanating from the 
front of the child. The hearing aids also included telecoils for use 
with neck-loop receivers of remote-microphone systems.

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  673
Fortunately for a 4-year-old child, real-ear assessment of the out-
put of the hearing aids could be made with probe-microphone 
measurements. Responses of both hearing aids to low and high 
input signals were compared to the targeted frequency gains 
based on the DSL[i/o] formula and adjusted to approximate them. 
Adjustments were also made to ensure that the patient was not 
provided with too much output for her comfort.
Aided speech-recognition ability was also assessed at the time of 
initial fi tting. The patient’s speech-recognition performance with 
the hearing aids is shown in Figure 15-3B. Here, materials were 
used that were age-appropriate for the child. Results show very 
good speech-recognition performance in the aided conditions.
Outcome assessment was also made as part of  an ongoing 
follow-up process to ensure that the child was receiving adequate 
aided gain and to assess the impact of any hearing fl uctuation on 
performance with the hearing aids. When this child enters school, 
the use of classroom amplification will become important. Her 
hearing aids have t-coils built in to be used with a neck loop on a 
remote-microphone system for classroom use.
This patient had normal speech and oral language development 
prior to the initial reduction in her hearing. However, she is now 
at risk for developing speech and academic-achievement problems 
and needs to be monitored carefully.
Auditory Processing Disorder
Treatment Goals
APD is an auditory disorder that has as one of its main compo-
nents difficulty in understanding speech in background noise. 
Treatment goals that focus on this component are often effective in 
forestalling academic achievement problems that may be related to 
the presence of APD (for a review, see Chermak & Musiek, 2007).
Intervention strategies directed toward enhancement of signal-
to-noise ratio have proven successful in the treatment of children 
with APD. There are at least two approaches to this type of inter-
vention. The fi rst approach is to alter the acoustic environment 
to enhance the listening situation. Environmental alterations 

674  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
include practical approaches such as preferential seating in the 
classroom and manipulation of the home environment so that 
the child is placed in more favorable listening situations. Altera-
tions may also include equipping the classroom with soundfi eld 
speakers to provide amplifi cation of the teacher’s speech.
It is not uncommon in children with APD for the diagnosis it-
self to serve as the treatment. That is, once parents and teachers 
become aware of the nature of the child’s problem and that the 
solution is one of enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio, they 
manipulate the environment so that the problem situations are 
eliminated, and the child’s auditory processing diffi culties become 
inconsequential.
In other cases, however, when severity of the auditory processing 
disorder is greater, the use of remote-microphone technology may 
be indicated.
Treatment Strategies
The main challenge in treating children with APD is to assist them 
in overcoming their diffi culties in understanding speech in back-
ground noise. The main focus of their problems is the classroom 
setting. In some areas, classrooms have amplifi cation systems that 
can be used to overcome these problems. If not, the child may bene-
fi t from amplifi cation designed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.
Hearing Aid Selection. Conventional hearing aids do not appear 
to be indicated for children with APD. Even mild gain amplifi ca-
tion with sophisticated signal processing and noise reduction 
circuitry may be insuffi cient to reduce background noise to the 
extent necessary for children with APD. Here the selection process 
is focused on fi nding the right remote-microphone confi guration 
for the child. Generally that means the use of a personal FM sys-
tem. These systems can be designed to provide a fl at frequency re-
sponse with minimal gain delivered to the ear and low maximum 
output levels to protect the normal hearing ear from damaging 
noise levels.
The amplified signal can be delivered to the ear through head-
phones or through an ear-level receiver.

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  675
Hearing Aid Fitting and Verification. Probe microphone mea-
surements can be made of the output of the remote-microphone 
device to ensure minimal gain and low maximum output.
Speech-recognition testing can also be used to verify that the child 
can take advantage of enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. A common 
approach is to present speech signals at a fixed intensity level 
from a loudspeaker placed in front of a patient, with background 
competition of some kind delivered from a speaker above or behind. 
Performance in recognizing the speech targets is then measured, 
and the competition intensity level is varied to assess ability at 
various signal-to-noise ratios. Testing is carried out without a 
device and with the remote microphone in close proximity to 
the loudspeaker from which the targets are being presented. 
Performance should increase substantially with the remote-
microphone device.
Outcome Measurement. Validation of success with this fitting 
strategy is made with teacher and parental questionnaires de-
signed to assess the benefi t of device use in the classroom and at 
home. Appropriate questionnaires include assessment of listen-
ing skills, general behavior, apparent hearing ability, and general 
academic achievement before and after implementation of device 
usage. The questionnaire also addresses the emotional impact of 
device use in the classroom.
Rehabilitation Treatment Plan. Children with APD may also ben-
efi t from auditory-training therapy directed toward enhancement 
of the ability to process auditory information and toward develop-
ment of compensatory skills (see Geffner & Ross-Swain, 2007).
Because children with APD often have concomitant deﬁ cits in 
speech, language, attention, learning, and cognition, comprehen-
sive approaches to treatment are recommended. Treatment for 
memory, vocabulary, comprehension, listening, reading, and spell-
ing are often necessary in children with multiple involvement.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 15-4 is a young child with auditory processing dis-
order. The patient is a 6-year-old girl with a history of chronic otitis 
Concomitant deﬁ cits are 
those that occur together.

676  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
media. Although her parents have always suspected that she had 
a hearing problem, pure-tone screenings in the past revealed hear-
ing sensitivity within normal limits. Tympanometric screenings 
revealed type B tympanograms during periods of otitis media and 
normal tympanograms during times of remission from otitis media.
An audiological evaluation showed normal middle-ear function, 
normal hearing sensitivity, abnormal speech-recognition ability, 
and abnormal auditory evoked potentials. Results are summa-
rized in Figure 15-4A.
Speech audiometric results show two indicators of APD. On the 
right ear, performance on measures of words and sentences in 
competition show rollover of the performance-intensity function; 
performance actually worsens as intensity is increased. On the left 
ear, performance on a measure of word recognition in competi-
tion is signifi cantly poorer than sentence recognition.
A treatment assessment showed that this child has substantial dif-
fi culty hearing in noisy and distracting environments. She is likely 
to be at risk for academic achievement problems if her learning 
environment is not structured to be a quiet one.
Initially, the parents were provided with information about the 
nature of the disorder and the strategies that can be used to alter 
listening environments in ways that might be useful to this child.
The parents found this information to be quite useful and to go 
a long way in solving the patient’s communication needs in the 
home environment. However, once the child entered school, the 
hearing problem resurfaced.
A re-evaluation showed little change in the patient’s processing 
ability. Consultation with the parents and teacher led to a decision 
to try the use of a personal FM system in the classroom.
Personal FM systems for use with those who have normal hearing 
sensitivity generally provide a fl at frequency response with very little 
gain across the frequency range. The input-output is generally lin-
ear. Output limiting is of little concern because of the minimal gain 
characteristics. A set of contemporary ear inserts were used, a solu-
tion that tends to be acceptable if not enviable in today’s classroom.

Performance with the FM system was assessed by measuring 
speech-recognition in the sound fi eld with the microphone located 
at the child’s ear and in proximity to the loudspeaker from which 
the target emanated. Results are shown in Figure 15-4B. As ex-
pected, the patient enjoys substantial benefi t from the enhance-
ment of signal-to-noise ratio.
The child uses the FM system in the classroom and under cer-
tain circumstances at home. Parent and teacher reports sub-

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  679
OTHER POPULATIONS
Conductive Hearing Loss
Treatment Goals
Conductive hearing loss results from disorders of the outer or mid-
dle ears. In most cases, these disorders can be treated medically 
or surgically, and little residual hearing impairment remains. In 
a small percentage of patients, however, the disorder cannot be 
treated. For example, a patient who has experienced multiple sur-
gical procedures for protracted otitis media and mastoiditis might 
end up with middle-ear disorder that is beyond surgical repair. 
In such cases, a hearing device might be the only realistic form 
of rehabilitation. As another example, patients with congenital  
atresia have hearing loss due to lack of an external auditory me-
atus. Although this condition is surgically treatable, it is usually 
not carried out in children until they are older. In such cases, 
hearing aid use will be necessary during the presurgical years.
The goal in the treatment of intractable conductive hearing loss 
is to maximize the auditory system’s access to sound with some 
form of amplifi cation. A conductive hearing loss acts as a sound 
attenuator, with little reduction in suprathreshold hearing once 
sound is made audible. Hearing aid amplifi cation, then, is targeted 
at this primary manifestation of conductive hearing impairment.
Treatment Strategies
Overcoming the attenuating effects of conductive hearing loss is 
relatively simple from a signal processing strategy. The challenge 
in this population is more often related to providing a satisfactory 
physical fi t for the amplifi cation device or deciding on the surgical 
solution of a bone-anchored hearing aid.
Recall from Chapter 13 that a BAHA consists of a titanium screw 
that is surgically placed into the mastoid bone. An external ampli-
fi er that is essentially a bone vibrator is snapped into the screw 
and sends vibratory energy to the screw, which in turn stimulates 
the cochlea via bone conduction. So at some point in the process, 
a patient needs to decide whether to pursue conventional hearing 
aid use or the use of a BAHA. Advantages of the BAHA include 
Inﬂ ammation of the bony 
process behind the auricle is 
called mastoiditis.
Congenital atresia is 
the absence at birth of the 
opening of the external 
auditory meatus.

680  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
ease and comfort of use, no feedback, and excellent sound quality 
delivered to the cochlea. Advantages of conventional hearing aids 
include considerably less cost than the BAHA, better directional 
hearing, and better binaural hearing.
Hearing-Device Selection. Patients with permanent conductive 
hearing loss in both ears should be fi tted with binaural hearing aids 
unless otherwise indicated.
A permanent conductive loss is usually fl at in confi guration, re-
quiring a broad, fl at frequency gain response. Loudness growth 
in a conductive hearing loss is equivalent to that of  a normal 
ear. Therefore, the device should be programmed to resemble 
linear gain. Also, because the conductive loss acts as an attenu-
ator, the hearing aid should be programmed to provide addi-
tional gain on the order of  25% of  the air-bone gap at a given 
frequency. There are few concerns regarding output limitation, 
because the attenuation effect of  the conductive hearing loss 
serves as a protective measure.
The style of hearing aid depends on the nature of the disorder 
causing the conductive hearing loss. For example, permanent 
conductive hearing loss secondary to chronically draining ears re-
quires a BTE hearing aid with suffi cient venting due to the drain-
age. Because a conductive hearing loss requires more gain than a 
sensorineural hearing loss, this venting must be done carefully to 
avoid feedback problems.
As another example, bilateral atresia requires the use of a bone-
conduction hearing aid or a BAHA. In a bone-conduction hear-
ing aid, the normal receiver is replaced with a bone vibrator that 
is designed to stimulate the cochlea directly, bypassing the closed 
ear canal.
Hearing Aid Fitting and Verification. The frequency gain and 
maximum output characteristics are programmed to meet target 
gain estimates. Fitting of a conventional device can then be done 
with probe-microphone measures, depending on the physical sta-
tus of the ear canal. Often there is some sensorineural component 
to the loss, and assessment of discomfort levels and speech per-
ception may add value to the verifi cation process.

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  681
Fitting of BAHA and bone-conduction hearing aids requires func-
tional gain measurement for output verification. The output of 
the hearing aid can be adjusted until targeted functional gain lev-
els are met.
Outcome Measurement. As with any hearing device, a self-
assessment scale will prove useful in pre- and post-fitting 
assessment of communication abilities and needs.
Rehabilitation Treatment Plan. Other rehabilitation needs are 
often unnecessary for those with permanent conductive hearing 
loss. The exception is the child with congenital, bilateral atresia, 
who, until proven otherwise, will need all of the intensive hearing 
and language stimulation training of children with sensorineural 
hearing impairment. The effi ciency with which such training can 
be accomplished is likely to be better in the child with atresia be-
cause of normal cochlear function.
Illustrative Case
Illustrative Case 15-5 is a young patient with bilateral conductive 
hearing loss due to long-standing untreated middle-ear disorder. 
The patient is a 19-year-old woman. As a child, she experienced 
chronic otitis media with effusion that was not treated because 
of restricted access to appropriate health care. As a result of the 
chronic nature of the disease process, her middle-ear structures 
eroded to a point that surgical attempts to reconstruct the middle 
ears failed. Although there was no longer any active disease pro-
cess, the conductive hearing loss remained. She had used binaural 
BTE hearing aids for the last several years but wanted to see if she 
was a candidate for a bone-anchored hearing aid.
An audiological assessment revealed a bilateral, symmetric, flat 
conductive hearing loss and good suprathreshold speech-recognition 
ability. Results are shown in Figure 15-5A.
A treatment assessment showed the patient to benefit signifi-
cantly from her BTE hearing aids. She was asked to compete a 
self-assessment of her communication with and without use of 
the devices, and the contrast was substantial in terms of ease of 
communication. However, she didn’t enjoy wearing BTE hearing 

682  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
aids, mostly from an appearance perspective. Her hearing aids 
were evaluated electroacoustically and shown to be function-
ing appropriately. Functional gain measures were made and are 
shown in Figure 15-5B. Results show that she was receiving ap-
propriate gain from the devices.
The otolaryngology consult showed that there was nothing to 
contraindicate the use of a BAHA nor to contraindicate surgery.

disorder. Pure-tone and speech audiometric results (A) show ﬂ at conductive hear-

The surgery was performed as an outpatient minor procedure and 
was deemed successful. Following a brief waiting period for heal-
ing, she returned for fi tting of the device.
The BAHA fi tting is relatively straightforward, providing essentially 
linear gain. Functional gain measures were again made to ensure 
adequacy across the frequency range. Results showed slightly bet-
ter functional gain than conventional hearing aids, as shown in 
Figure 15-5B. Quality and speech perception judgments suggested 
enhanced benefi t over her conventional hearing aids.
After one month of  BAHA use, the self-assessment scale that 
was given at the time of the initial treatment assessment was re-
 administered. Results were compared to the earlier evaluation and 
showed that the patient’s communication problems were reduced 
in most environments with the BAHA. Results compared favor-
ably with those of conventional hearing aid use. She reported that

she was very pleased with the quality of sound and the ease of use 
of the BAHA. At fi rst, she had a diffi cult time adjusting to a reduc-
tion in spatial hearing, but she reported that she was becoming 
increasingly accustomed to the change and that she perceived the 
problem to be somewhat minor in comparison to the benefi ts. She 
also reported that she still uses her conventional hearing aids on 
occasion, particularly in noisy environments.
Severe and Profound Sensorineural 
Hearing Loss
Treatment Goals
Severe and profound hearing impairment in children or adults can 
substantially limit the use of the auditory channel for communi-
cation purposes. Even with very powerful hearing aids, auditory 
function may be limited to awareness of environmental sounds.
In young children, the prognosis for learning speech and oral lan-
guage can be quite low. Most children born with profound hearing 
loss communicate in sign language and have little or no verbal com-
munication ability without audiologic treatment and rehabilitation.
In adults with adventitious severe to profound hearing impair-
ment, reception of  verbal communication can be limited, and 
speech skills can erode due to an inability to monitor vocal output.
The most common fi rst step in hearing treatment in this popula-
tion is trial use of conventional amplifi cation, followed by cochlear 
implantation. The treatment goal is the same: maximize access 
to sound in an effort to ameliorate the communication disorder 
caused by the hearing loss.
Treatment Strategies
Cochlear implantation is the primary hearing treatment strategy 
for patients with severe to profound hearing loss. In children un-
der 2 years of age, candidacy for cochlear implantation includes 
the following criteria:
profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss,
• 
little or no benefi t from hearing aid amplifi cation,
• 
no medical contraindications,
• 

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  685
educational placement in a program that emphasizes 
• 
audition,
family support, and
• 
appropriate expectations.
• 
In children older than 2 years of age, candidacy includes the fol-
lowing criteria:
severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss,
• 
minimal benefi t from hearing aid amplifi cation,
• 
no medical contraindications,
• 
educational placement in a program that emphasizes 
• 
audition,
family support, and
• 
appropriate expectations.
• 
In adults, candidacy is generally based more on speech perception 
than on the audiogram. Criteria include:
severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss,
• 
limited benefi t from hearing aids, defi ned as scores of 50% or 
• 
less on open-set sentence recognition measures on the ear to 
be implanted and 60% or less on the nonimplanted ear,
no medical contraindications, and
• 
appropriate expectations.
• 
Figure 15-6 shows four audiograms from ears that have been 
successfully implanted to give you a framework for the range of 
fi tting. It is important to emphasize that the criteria have shifted 
over the years, very appropriately, from those based on thresh-
olds to those based on suprathreshold outcomes. If a patient with 
severe-to-profound hearing loss is not getting speech perception 
benefi t from appropriately fi tted conventional hearing aids, he or 
she is now considered a candidate for implantation.
Patients with severe to profound hearing loss who are not can-
didates for cochlear implantation benefi t from powerful conven-
tional hearing aids. The selection and fi tting strategies for power 
hearing aids are challenging but straightforward. Binaural hear-
ing aids are used to provide the most gain possible. Hearing aids are 

686  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
BTE devices with tight-fi tting earmolds. Dynamic range is usually 
quite limited, and maximum output must be carefully adjusted. 
Because access to sound is limited to begin with, it is imperative 
to maximize it with features including directionality, noise reduc-
tion, and wireless connectivity for remote microphone use.

The remainder of this section will address cochlear implantation 
as the strategy for hearing treatment of this population.
Cochlear Implant Selection. Once candidacy has been deter-
mined, decisions related to strategy are limited mostly to which 
ear to implant and which brand of device to implant. The former 
decision is an important one. In general, there is a tendency to 
implant the better ear if there is a difference in function between 
ears, assuming that prognosis will be best for successful neural 
stimulation in that ear.
Most of the selection process is completed once this decision is 
made. Different manufacturers use different processing strategies, 
most of which have been implemented with equivalent success.
Device Fitting and Verification. Programming of the cochlear 
implant processor varies by manufacturer and by processing strat-
egy, but some generalizations can be made. One of the fi rst steps is 
to determine if activation of a given electrode in the implanted ar-
ray results in the perception of hearing. If so, then the threshold 
and dynamic range of that electrode are determined. Once this is 
done for the entire array, a “map” of these values is created across 
electrodes. From these basic data, determination is made of which 
electrodes are to receive frequency and intensity information, de-
pending on the processing strategy that is chosen.
This process of “mapping” the electrodes is an ongoing one that 
can take several sessions to complete in adults and can take 
months to complete in young children.
Verifi cation of the map is usually accomplished with the use of 
soundfi eld thresholds and speech-recognition testing. Several bat-
teries of tests have been developed for both children and adults 
to assess performance with the implant devices (for a review, see 
Zwolan, 2002).
Outcome Measurement. The self-assessment scales of commu-
nication abilities and needs that are used for assessing outcomes 
with conventional hearing aids are appropriate for cochlear im-
plants as well. Similarly, parental and teacher assessment scales 
designed for hearing aid outcomes in children are also appropri-
ate for cochlear implants.

688  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
Rehabilitation Treatment Plan. Rehabilitation treatment  planning 
is similar to that described for conventional hearing devices. Adults 
may benefi t from supplemental use of remote-microphone input 
and other assistive devices. They might also benefi t from courses 
in speechreading. For young children, implantation simply marks 
the beginning of the process of speech and language stimulation 
(see Clark, 2007; Cole & Flexer, 2007).
Illustrative Cases
Illustrative Case 15-6. Case 6 is an adult patient with profound 
bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment that has progressed 
over the last 10 years. The patient is a 44-year-old woman. 
Based on familial history, her hearing impairment is thought 
to be caused by dominant progressive hereditary hearing loss. 
She is an accountant in a large insurance firm and, although 
much of her work is computer based, she feels that she is being 
left behind professionally and socially because of her substantial 
hearing impairment.
Figure 15-7A shows the audiogram from each ear. Speech-
recognition ability is poor, consistent with the degree of  loss. 
Performance with binaural hearing aids shows some achievable 
gain, but virtually no benefi t in speech-recognition ability. Unaided 
and aided scores were 0% for both CNC words and Hearing in 
Noise Test (HINT) sentences presented in quiet.
A treatment assessment showed the patient to be an excellent 
candidate for implantation. She was in good health and has 
strong support from her family, friends, and employer. She judges 
her communication needs and her communication disorder to 
be substantial.
After evaluation of her unaided and aided performance, a deci-
sion was made to pursue the use of a cochlear implant. A device 
was selected and implanted in her right ear.
Approximately 4 weeks following implantation, the device was 
activated through the speech processor, and the processor was 
programmed to stimulate the electrodes that were considered 
distinctly usable. Programming was accomplished by setting 

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  689
thresholds of detectability of electrical currents delivered to each 
electrode. Comfort levels were also set for each electrode or group 
of electrodes. The exact processing strategy was determined from 
the proprietary strategies available for the specifi c implant that 
was chosen.
Performance with the device was assessed by soundfi eld threshold 
measures and by comparing pre- and post-implant performance

hearing loss. Pure-tone and speech audiometric results (A) show bilateral hearing 
loss and poor speech-recognition ability with or without conventional hearing aids. 
Pre- and post-implant results (B) show substantial improvements in audibility and in 
performance on selected speech-recognition measures.

on a range of  speech-recognition measures. Results of  the 
threshold measures and on several selected speech-recognition 
tests are shown in Figures 15-7B. Results indicated that the 
cochlear implant was providing very good hearing sensitivity 
thresholds and substantial improvement in speech-recognition 
over aided performance.
A self-assessment scale showed that the patient is receiving 
substantial benefit from the cochlear implant and that, with 
the implant, her communication problems are reduced in most 
listening environments.
Illustrative Case 15-7. Case 7 is a young boy with progressive bi-
lateral sensorineural hearing impairment, secondary to a bout 
of meningitis at age 12 months. The child passed a routine new-
born hearing screening at birth, and the parents had no reason 
to suspect a hearing loss prior to the meningitis.

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  691
An audiologic evaluation was carried out shortly after his recov-
ery from the medical aspects of meningitis, and he was found to 
have a moderate sensorineural hearing loss. If his loss had been 
profound or had there been evidence of cochlear ossifi cation, trial 
hearing aid use could have been skipped and implantation carried 
out immediately. Fortunately in this case, there was no evidence 
of ossifi cation, and his hearing loss was only moderate in degree. 
He was fi tted with binaural BTE hearing aids shortly thereafter 
and enrolled in an auditory habilitation program aimed at en-
hancing oral language development. The severity of his hearing 
loss progressed to moderately severe by 3 years of age and again 
to severe by 5 years of  age. Although he was participating in 
mainstream education, by 6 years of age he was struggling, and 
his parents were interested in understanding his alternatives re-
garding implantation.
An audiological assessment shows severe to profound, primarily 
sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally. An audiogram is shown in 
Figure 15-8A. Speech awareness thresholds were in agreement 
with pure-tone thresholds.
Without hearing aids, speech-recognition was negligible. Aided 
speech-recognition testing was carried out with the Lexical 
Neighborhood Test (LNT) (Kirk et al., 1995) and the Multi-Lexical 
Neighborhood Test (MLNT) (Kirk et al., 1995). Results showed 
poor aided performance, with scores of 8% on the LNT and 4% on 
the MLNT.
After careful consideration, the parents decided that the child 
should receive a cochlear implant. Following recovery from sur-
gery, the speech processor was programmed and reprogrammed 
in an effort to achieve the best speech and sound recognition abil-
ity available from the device. The programming efforts took ap-
proximately 3 months to complete.
During the programming period, the child showed substantial im-
provement in his ability to function with the implants. Speech recog-
nition results at 6 months post-implant are shown in Figure 15-8B. 
Substantial improvements were noted between the child’s ability to 
recognize speech with the cochlear implant over conventional hear-
ing aid amplifi cation.

The child is now 9 years old. His standard scores on vocabulary 
and language measures are within normal limits for his age. 
He remains in mainstream education and is doing very well in 
school.
Summary
Although the overall goal of any hearing treatment strategy is 
• 
to reduce hearing impairment by maximizing access to sound, 
the approach used to reach that goal can vary across patients.
The approach chosen to evaluate and fi t hearing aids can vary 
• 
with patient factors such as age, type of hearing disorder, and 
patient need.
Adult patients with sensorineural hearing loss tend to be 
• 
both easy and challenging in terms of  hearing aid selection 
and fi tting—easy because they are cooperative and can pro-
vide insightful feedback throughout the fi tting process and 
challenging because there is not much to limit the audiolo-
gist’s options.
With older individuals, the more that can be done to ease the 
• 
burden of listening in background noise, whether by sophisti-
cated signal processing in ear-level hearing devices or by use of 
a remote microphone, the more likely the patient will benefi t 
from hearing-device amplifi cation.
Another important challenge in fi tting hearing aids in older in-
• 
dividuals is the diffi culty involved in the physical manipulation 
of the device.
Hearing aid selection and fi tting in children with sensorineural 
• 
hearing impairment is a challenging business for various rea-
sons. One is that audiometric levels may be known only gener-
ally at the beginning of the fi tting process.
Another is that children are less likely or able to participate in 
• 
the selection and fi tting process.
Still another is that hearing may be more variable in young 
• 
children due to progression or to fluctuation secondary to 
otitis media.
The main challenge in treating children with APD is to assist 
• 
them in overcoming their diffi culties in understanding speech 
in background noise.

694  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
A child with APD may benefi t from amplifi cation designed to 
• 
enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.
Overcoming the attenuating effects of conductive hearing loss 
• 
is relatively simple from a signal processing strategy. The chal-
lenge in this population is more often related to deciding on the 
most appropriate transducer.
Cochlear implantation is the primary hearing treatment strat-
• 
egy for patients with profound deafness.
Short Answer Questions
 1. A major problem resulting from sensorineural hearing 
loss includes loss of hearing 
, typically in the
 frequencies.
 2. Individuals with sensorineural hearing loss of cochlear 
origin also tend to have a reduced 
 range and 
 growth of loudness.
 3. In the case of sensorineural hearing loss, 
 
recognition and ability to hear speech in 
 
 is typically diminished.
 4. A goal for treating sensorineural hearing loss is to amplify 
soft sounds so that they are 
, and ensure that 
loud sounds are not 
.
 5. For most populations, 
 amplifi cation is recom-
mended unless clinically contraindicated because of the 
numerous advantages to hearing with both ears.
 6. Nonlinear signal processing strategies using a 
 
circuit are helpful for fi tting the output of the hearing aid 
into the reduced dynamic range of the individual with 
 sensorineural hearing loss.
 7. The use of 
 microphones helps to increase the 
signal-to-noise ratio. This is done to increase speech percep-
tion in 
.
 8. Hearing aid fi ttings are typically verifi ed using 
- 
microphone measurements, subjective 
 
 judgments to determine that loud sounds are comfort-
able, and subjective 
 quality or intelligibility 
judgments.

CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS  695
 9. Outcome measurements are typically made using 
-
 scales that are completed both 
pre- and post-fi tting. Comparison of these measures is 
thought to refl ect changes due to hearing aid benefi t.
 10. Patients with sensorineural hearing loss should be pro-
vided information about other 
 
 
 technology, such as amplifi ed telephones, smoke alarms, 
and other specialized alerting devices.
 11. One consideration for hearing aid style for older individuals 
is the 
 of the patient. It is necessary for patients 
to be able to manipulate both the hearing aid and the battery 
for the hearing aid.
 12. Auditory rehabilitation plans may include 
 
training and/or speechreading training.
 13. The goal of audiologic treatment for the pediatric population 
is to ensure the best possible hearing for development of oral 
 and 
.
 14. The smaller ear canals of children results in a higher
 
 
 of the signal deliv-
ered to the tympanic membrane. In addition, the ear canals 
of children have different 
 characteristics than 
found in adult ears.
 15. The use of 
-
 measurements is 
 essential for pediatric patients because they are less able to 
provide information about hearing sensitivity and suprath-
reshold perception.
 16. Unless contraindicated, binaural amplifi cation with 
-
-
 hearing aids is 
 recommended for pediatric patients. Earmolds made of a 
soft material, such as 
 are typically used.
 17. The 
 prescriptive formula is most typically used 
for programming hearing aids in pediatric patients.
 18. Outcomes measurements specifi cally used for pediatric pa-
tients include the 
 
 Worksheet and 
the  Children’s 
 Worksheets.
 19. A rehabilitation treatment plan for a pediatric patient typi-
cally includes auditory training, 
 stimulation, 
and speech 
.

696  CHAPTER 15  DIFFERENT TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR DIFFERENT POPULATIONS
 20. A remote 
 system is often used in cases of 
 auditory 
 disorder, to provide a higher signal-to-
noise ratio in the classroom environment.
 21. Bone-anchored hearing aids are often a solution for 
 hearing loss.
 22. A hearing aid used for a conductive hearing loss typically 
requires an additional gain equal to 
 % of the 
air-bone gap.
 23. Both powerful conventional hearing aids and 
 
 are common treatment solutions for profound 
hearing loss.
Discussion Questions
 1. How does nonlinearity of loudness growth complicate fi t-
ting of hearing aids? What technology can be used to cope 
with this complication?
 2. For an older patient with good speech recognition in one ear 
and poor speech recognition in the other ear, should binau-
ral amplifi cation be used?
 3. Why are probe-microphone measures especially important 
for children?
 4. Describe treatment options that are appropriate for children 
with auditory processing disorder.
 5. What are the comparative advantages of binaural conven-
tional hearing aids and a bone-anchored hearing aid?
 6. Describe candidacy for cochlear implantation.

Appendix A
AUDIOLOGY SCOPE OF PRACTICE: AAA
Following is an excerpt from Audiology: Scope of  Practice 2004, according to the 
American Academy of Audiology (reprinted with permission).
Introduction
The Scope of Practice document describes the range of interests, capabilities 
and professional activities of audiologists. It defi nes audiologists as independent 
practitioners and provides examples of settings in which they are engaged. It is 
not intended to exclude the participation in activities outside of those delineated 
in the document. The overriding principle is that members of the Academy will 
provide only those services for which they are adequately prepared through their 
academic and clinical training and their experience, and that their practice is 
consistent with the Code of Ethics of the American Academy of Audiology.
I. Purpose
The purpose of  this document is to defi ne the profession of  audiology by its 
scope of practice. This document outlines those activities that are within the 
expertise of  members of  the profession. This Scope of  Practice statement is 
intended for use by audiologists, allied professionals, consumers of audiologic 
services, and the general public. It serves as a reference for issues of service de-
livery, third-party reimbursement, legislation, consumer education, regulatory 
action, state and professional licensure, and inter-professional relations. The 
document is not intended to be an exhaustive list of activities in which audiolo-
gists engage. Rather, it is a broad statement of professional practice. Periodic 
updating of any scope of practice statement is necessary as technologies and 
perspectives change.
II. Definition of an Audiologist
An audiologist is a person who, by virtue of academic degree, clinical training, 
and license to practice and/or professional credential, is uniquely qualifi ed to 
provide a comprehensive array of professional services related to the preven-
tion of hearing loss and the audiologic identifi cation, assessment, diagnosis, and 
treatment of persons with impairment of auditory and vestibular function, and 

APPENDIX A  AUDIOLOGY SCOPE OF PRACTICE: AAA  699
to the prevention of impairments associated with them. Audiologists serve in a 
number of roles including clinician, therapist, teacher, consultant, researcher 
and administrator. The supervising audiologist maintains legal and ethical re-
sponsibility for all assigned audiology activities provided by audiology assistants 
and audiology students.
The central focus of the profession of audiology is concerned with all auditory 
impairments and their relationship to disorders of communication. Audiolo-
gists identify, assess, diagnose, and treat individuals with impairment of either 
peripheral or central auditory and/or vestibular function, and strive to prevent 
such impairments.
Audiologists provide clinical and academic training to students in audiology. 
Audiologists teach physicians, medical students, residents, and fellows about 
the auditory and vestibular system. Specifi cally, they provide instruction about 
identifi cation, assessment, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of persons with 
hearing and/or vestibular impairment. They provide information and training 
on all aspects of hearing and balance to other professions including psychology, 
counseling, rehabilitation, and education. Audiologists provide information on 
hearing and balance, hearing loss and disability, prevention of hearing loss, and 
treatment to business and industry. They develop and oversee hearing conserva-
tion programs in industry. Further, audiologists serve as expert witnesses within 
the boundaries of forensic audiology.
The audiologist is an independent practitioner who provides services in hospitals, 
clinics, schools, private practices and other settings in which audiologic services 
are relevant.
III. Scope of Practice
The scope of practice of audiologists is defi ned by the training and knowledge base 
of professionals who are licensed and/or credentialed to practice as audiologists. 
Areas of practice include the audiologic identifi cation, assessment, diagnosis and 
treatment of individuals with impairment of auditory and vestibular function, 
prevention of hearing loss, and research in normal and disordered auditory and 
vestibular function. The practice of audiology includes:
A. Identifi cation
Audiologists develop and oversee hearing screening programs for persons of all 
ages to detect individuals with hearing loss. Audiologists may perform speech or 
language screening, or other screening measures, for the purpose of initial iden-
tifi cation and referral of persons with other communication disorders.
B. Assessment and Diagnosis
Assessment of  hearing includes the administration and interpretation of 
 behavioral, physioacoustic, and electrophysiologic measures of the peripheral 
and central auditory systems. Assessment of  the vestibular system includes 
administration and interpretation of behavioral and electrophysiologic tests of 
equilibrium. Assessment is accomplished using standardized testing procedures 

700  APPENDIX A  AUDIOLOGY SCOPE OF PRACTICE: AAA
and appropriately calibrated instrumentation and leads to the diagnosis of hear-
ing and/or vestibular abnormality.
C. Treatment
The audiologist is the professional who provides the full range of  audiologic 
treatment services for persons with impairment of hearing and vestibular func-
tion. The audiologist is responsible for the evaluation, fi tting, and verifi cation of 
amplifi cation devices, including assistive listening devices. The audiologist deter-
mines the appropriateness of amplifi cation systems for persons with hearing im-
pairment, evaluates benefi t, and provides counseling and training regarding their 
use. Audiologists conduct otoscopic examinations, clean ear canals and remove 
cerumen, take ear canal impressions, select, fi t, evaluate, and dispense hearing 
aids and other amplifi cation systems. Audiologists assess and provide audiologic 
treatment for persons with tinnitus using techniques that include, but are not 
limited to, biofeedback, masking, hearing aids, education, and counseling.
 
1. Audiologists also are involved in the treatment of persons with vestibular 
disorders. They participate as full members of balance treatment teams to 
recommend and carry out treatment and rehabilitation of impairments 
of vestibular function.
 
2. Audiologists provide audiologic treatment services for infants and 
children with hearing impairment and their families. These services 
may include clinical treatment, home intervention, family support, and 
case management.
 
3. The audiologist is the member of the implant team (e.g., cochlear im-
plants, middle-ear implantable hearing aids, fully implantable hearing 
aids, bone anchored hearing aids, and all other amplifi cation/signal pro-
cessing devices) who determines audiologic candidacy based on hearing 
and communication information. The audiologist provides pre and post 
surgical assessment, counseling, and all aspects of audiologic treatment 
including auditory training, rehabilitation, implant programming, and 
maintenance of implant hardware and software.
The audiologist provides audiologic treatment to persons with hearing impair-
ment, and is a source of information for family members, other professionals and 
the general public. Counseling regarding hearing loss, the use of amplifi cation 
systems and strategies for improving speech recognition is within the expertise 
of the audiologist. Additionally, the audiologist provides counseling regarding 
the effects of hearing loss on communication and psycho-social status in per-
sonal, social, and vocational arenas.
The audiologist administers audiologic identifi cation, assessment, diagnosis, and 
treatment programs to children of all ages with hearing impairment from birth 
and preschool through school age. The audiologist is an integral part of the team 
within the school system that manages students with hearing impairments and 
students with central auditory processing disorders. The audiologist participates 
in the development of Individual Family Service Plans (IFSPs) and Individual-
ized Educational Programs (IEPs), serves as a consultant in matters pertaining to 
classroom acoustics, assistive listening systems, hearing aids, communication, 

APPENDIX A  AUDIOLOGY SCOPE OF PRACTICE: AAA  701
and psycho-social effects of hearing loss, and maintains both classroom assistive 
systems as well as students’ personal hearing aids. The audiologist administers 
hearing screening programs in schools, and trains and supervises nonaudiolo-
gists performing hearing screening in the educational setting.
D. Hearing Conservation
The audiologist designs, implements and coordinates industrial and community 
hearing conservation programs. This includes identifi cation and amelioration 
of noise-hazardous conditions, identifi cation of hearing loss, recommendation 
and counseling on use of  hearing protection, employee education, and the 
training and supervision of nonaudiologists performing hearing screening in 
the industrial setting.
E. Intraoperative Neurophysiologic Monitoring
Audiologists administer and interpret electrophysiologic measurements of neural 
function including, but not limited to, sensory and motor evoked potentials, 
tests of nerve conduction velocity, and electromyography. These measurements 
are used in differential diagnosis, pre- and post-operative evaluation of neural 
function, and neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring of central nervous 
system, spinal cord, and cranial nerve function.
F. Research
Audiologists design, implement, analyze and interpret the results of research 
related to auditory and balance systems.
G. Additional Expertise
Some audiologists, by virtue of  education, experience, and personal choice 
choose to specialize in an area of practice not otherwise defi ned in this document. 
Nothing in this document shall be construed to limit individual freedom of 
choice in this regard provided that the activity is consistent with the American 
Academy of Audiology Code of Ethics.

Appendix B
AUDIOLOGY SCOPE OF PRACTICE: ASHA
Following is an excerpt from the Scope of  Practice in Audiology, according to the 
American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (reprinted with permission from Scope 
of Practice in Audiology. Available from the Website of the American Speech-Language-
Hearing Association: www.asha.org. All rights reserved.)
Statement of Purpose
The purpose of this document is to defi ne the scope of practice in audiology in 
order to (a) describe the services offered by qualifi ed audiologists as primary ser-
vice providers, case managers, and/or members of multidisciplinary and inter-
disciplinary teams; (b) serve as a reference for health care, education, and other 
professionals, and for consumers, members of the general public, and policy 
makers concerned with legislation, regulation, licensure, and third party reim-
bursement; and (c) inform members of ASHA, certifi cate holders, and students 
of the activities for which certifi cation in audiology is required in accordance 
with the ASHA Code of Ethics.
Audiologists provide comprehensive diagnostic and treatment/rehabilitative ser-
vices for auditory, vestibular, and related impairments. These services are provided 
to individuals across the entire age span from birth through adulthood; to individ-
uals from diverse language, ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds; and 
to indi viduals who have multiple disabilities. This position state ment is not intended 
to be exhaustive; however, the activities described refl ect current practice within 
the profession. Practice activities related to emerging clinical, tech nological, and 
scientifi c developments are not precluded from consideration as part of the scope 
of practice of an audiologist. Such innovations and advances will result in the pe-
riodic revision and updating of this document. It is also recognized that specialty 
areas identifi ed within the scope of practice will vary among the individual pro-
viders. ASHA also recognizes that credentialed professionals in related fi elds may 
have knowledge, skills, and experience that could be applied to some areas within 
the scope of audiology practice. Defi ning the scope of practice of audiologists is not 
meant to exclude other appropriately credentialed postgraduate professionals from 
rendering services in common practice areas.
Audiologists serve diverse populations. The patient/client population includes per-
sons of different race, age, gender, religion, national origin, and sexual orientation. 

APPENDIX B  AUDIOLOGY SCOPE OF PRACTICE: ASHA  703
Audiologists’ caseloads include individuals from diverse ethnic, cultural, or linguis-
tic backgrounds, and persons with disabilities. Although audiologists are prohibited 
from discriminating in the provision of professional services based on these factors, 
in some cases such factors may be relevant to the development of an appropriate 
treatment plan. These factors may be considered in treatment plans only when 
fi rmly grounded in scientifi c and professional knowledge.
This scope of practice does not supersede existing state licensure laws or affect

Framework for Practice
The practice of  audiology includes both the prevention of  and assessment 
of  auditory, vestibular, and related impairments as well as the habilitation/
rehabilitation and maintenance of persons with these impairments. The overall 
goal of the provision of audiology services should be to optimize and enhance the 
ability of an individual to hear, as well as to communicate in his/her everyday or 
natural environment. In addition, audiologists provide comprehensive services 
to individuals with normal hearing who interact with persons with a hearing 
impairment. The over all goal of audiologic services is to improve the quality of 
life for all of these individuals.
Deﬁ nition of an Audiologist
Audiologists are professionals engaged in autonomous practice to promote healthy 
hearing, communication competency, and quality of life for persons of all ages 
through the prevention, identifi cation, assessment, and rehabilitation of hearing, 
auditory function, balance, and other related systems. They facilitate prevention 
through the fi tting of hearing protective devices, education programs for industry 
and the public, hearing screening/conservation programs, and research. The au-
diologist is the professional responsible for the identifi cation of impairments and 
dysfunction of the auditory, balance, and other related systems. Their unique ed-
ucation and training provides them with the skills to assess and diagnose dysfunc-
tion in hearing, auditory function, balance, and related disorders. The delivery of 
audiologic (re)habilitation services includes not only the selecting, fi tting, and 
dispensing of hearing aids and other hearing assistive devices, but also the assess-
ment and follow-up services for persons with cochlear implants. The audiologist 
providing audiologic (re)habilitation does so through a comprehensive program 
of therapeutic services, devices, counseling, and other management strategies. 
Functional diagnosis of vestibular disorders and management of balance reha-
bilitation is another aspect of the professional responsibilities of the audiologist. 
Audiologists engage in research pertinent to all of these domains.
Professional Roles and Activities
Audiologists serve a diverse population and may function in one or more of a 
variety of activities. The practice of audiology includes:

ters; managed care systems; industry; the military; various state agencies; home 
health, subacute rehabilitation, long-term care, and intermediate-care facili-
ties; and school systems. Audiologists provide academic education to students 
and practitioners in universities, to medical and surgical students and residents, 
and to other related professionals. Such education pertains to the identifi cation, 
functional diagnosis/assessment, and non-medical treatment/management of 
auditory, vestibular, balance, and related impairments.

707
self-governed and establish their own boundaries for 
professional practice. It is incumbent upon members of 
the profession to understand and practice within the 
boundaries established by their peers when referring to 
themselves as audiologists.
Autonomous professionals collectively develop 
an ethical code of conduct to govern the behaviors 
of the practitioners representing their profession. 
 Because other professionals do not oversee the activi-
ties of  audiologists, audiologists are responsible for the 
 activities that they perform. As such, it is necessary for 
audiologists to have a thorough understanding of what 
constitutes ethical practice for the safety and concern 
of patients, as well as for professional protection.
 2. The scope of practice for a profession is developed by 
members of the profession. This is typically accom-
plished in the context of professional organizations, 
which are developed for the purpose of representing 
the interests of professionals and patients treated by 
such professionals. In addition, governmental licens-
ing bodies also participate in defi ning the scope of 
practice by delineating the activities that professionals 
are legally permitted to practice within a given state. 
Often, however, licensing bodies adopt much of the 
scope of practice for a given profession from that 
defi ned by those professional organizations representing 
the profession.
In the United States, the scope of practice of 
Audiology is defi ned by two major organizations rep-
resenting the practice of audiology: The American 
Academy of Audiology (AAA) and the American 
Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). Both 
organizations have drafted documents to provide spe-
cifi c information concerning the professional role and 
activities of audiologists.
 3. Certifi cation is the process by which a nongovernment 
agency or association grants recognition to an individ-
ual meeting qualifi cations specifi ed by that institution. 
Certifi cation is a voluntary credential that is ordinar-
ily not legally mandatory for practice of a profession.

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. An autonomous profession is one that is independent. 
It does not rely on the oversight of other professions in 
order to engage in professional activities. Because the 
profession of audiology is an autonomous profession, 
it is necessary for audiologists to thoroughly under-
stand the scope of practice and the code of ethics for 
the profession.
The scope of practice defi nes the roles and activi-
ties of audiology. Those roles and activities defi ned in 
the scope of practice are typically well established and 
understood within the professional community. Per-
forming activities outside of the scope of practice puts 
the professional at risk for making errors of judgment 
by utilizing a knowledge base outside of that provided 
by the academic and clinical education established for 
the training of professionals. In addition, performing 
activities outside of the scope of practice creates confu-
sion in understanding what separates one profession 
from another. As a profession that is not governed by 
outside professionals, audiologists as a group must be 
Appendix C

708  APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
 Certifi cation is typically granted by professional orga-
nizations, which specify certain criteria that individu-
als must demonstrate in order to present themselves as 
possessing the knowledge and skills to perform certain 
activities. For the profession of audiology, the Certifi -
cate of Clinical Competence in Audiology (CCC-A) 
from the American Speech-Language-Hearing As-
sociation (ASHA) and certifi cation from the American 
Board of Audiology (ABA) can be attained.
Licensure is the process by which a government 
agency grants permission to engage in a specifi ed 
profession. Licensure provides a professional with the 
legal right to practice. Like the process of certifi cation, 
the ability to obtain a license to practice audiology 
depends on the demonstration by an individual that he 
or she has obtained the necessary academic education 
and clinical skills necessary to be a competent practi-
tioner. Licensing boards for government institutions 
are largely composed of individuals who represent the 
professions in question. As such, these boards typically 
develop requirements for licensure that are very simi-
lar to those required for earning the Au.D. degree.
Historically, many state governments did not 
 require licensure to practice the profession of audio-
logy. Therefore, credentialing via certifi cation provided 
the best available means to identify those who com-
pleted requirements to carry out the activities in which 
audiologists engage. In recent years, licensure has 
largely replaced need for entry-level certifi cation in 
audiology. This means that it is not necessary for audio-
logists to obtain certifi cation in order to demonstrate 
competence to practice because the right to practice 
is conferred by the state government. However, many 
audiologists choose to obtain or maintain their certifi -
cation for professional reasons, such as to demonstra-
tion of support for their professional organizations.
In addition, some audiologists may choose to pur-
sue certifi cations beyond those required for entry-level 
practice. Such certifi cations may be useful in providing 
evidence of profi ciency in particular specialized areas 
of audiology, such as in the area of cochlear implants.
 4. Technological advancements have contributed to 
expanding the scope of practice for audiologists. Over 
the last several decades, new technologies that allow 
evaluation of the auditory and vestibular systems 
have been adopted by the profession of audiology 
for use in diagnosis and assessment of hearing and 
vestibular disorders. Examples of such technologies 
include the use of auditory brainstem responses (ABR) 
for evaluation of the integrity of the auditory nerve 
when suspicious of space-occupying lesions in the 
brain, contributing to the expansion of the scope of 
audiology to include certain neurodiagnostic testing 
procedures.
The development of objective measures such as 
the ABR, otoacoustic emissions, and auditory steady-
state responses have provided audiologists with the 
ability to assess the auditory status of infants and 
newborns. These technologies have led to newborn 
infant hearing screening as an extremely  important 
component of the scope of audiology practice and to 
an even greater emphasis on the identifi cation and 
treatment of infant hearing loss. Vestibular testing 
 advances, such as the use of electronystagmography, 
and more recently, videonystagmography, have placed 
the audiologist in an important role in the assessment 
of vestibular function.
The scope of audiology treatment has also 
expanded with the introduction of new technolo-
gies. Advancements in hearing aids in recent years 
expanded the number of patients who utilize personal 
hearing instruments. This has increased the amount 
of time audiologists spend with hearing aid treatment 
activities. In addition, the advent of cochlear implan-
tation and expansion of candidacy for implantation 
have added another dimension of treatment activities 
to the scope of practice in audiology.
The introduction of electrophysiological 
techniques necessary for monitoring of motor and 
sensory nerves has allowed audiologists to use 
multimodal sensory evoked potentials in surgical 
monitoring.
 5. Events and forces of the past dictate, to a large extent, 
the manner in which audiology is practiced today. This 
knowledge is helpful in determining future goals for 
audiology as a profession.
A major contribution to the fi eld of audiology was 
the invention of the clinical audiometer by C. C. Bunch 
and the introduction of the pure-tone audiogram. The 
behavioral techniques developed by the profession of 
audiology at its inception are among the most impor-
tant used today. 
The development of programs devoted to aural 
rehabilitation had their genesis in Army hospitals 
following World War II. To this day, the military and 
the Veterans Administration are among the largest 
employers of audiologists in the United States.
Controversies of the past, such as the ethical 
 nature of hearing aid dispensation and sales, continue 
to provide topics for consideration in current refi ne-
ment of ethical guidelines crafted by professional orga-
nizations representing audiologists.
The academic roots of audiology in the discipline 
of communication sciences and disorders continues 
today in many university training programs, despite 
the continued progress toward differentiation of the 
professions of speech-language pathology and audiol-
ogy. Expansions of the scope of practice in audiology 

APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  709
and the necessity for autonomy in the profession have 
been major contributors in the emergence of the 
entry-level degree for audiology, the Au.D.
Issues of reimbursement for clinical services are 
deeply entrenched in historical notions of audiologi-
cal services and audiologists as service providers. 
Current efforts in the fi eld of audiology are geared 
toward reimbursement concepts that are more closely 
aligned with the current notion of audiologists as 
autonomous professionals. In addition, efforts toward 
licensure for audiologists in all states has been pursued 
by professional organizations in an effort to promote 
greater autonomy of audiology as a profession, rather 
than using certifi cation by professional organizations 
for demonstration of clinical profi ciency.

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. When a force is applied to a sound source, energy is 
transferred through the medium of air (or any other 
medium that has the properties of mass and elasticity) 
via a sound pressure wave. The pressure wave propa-
gates through the medium by the compression of air 
molecules (known as condensation) and the decrease 
in density of air molecules (known as rarefaction) that 
occurs as a result of elastic forces. The energy emanates 
through the medium until it reaches the level of the 
outer ear. The outer ear functions to collect and fun-
nel sound to the tympanic membrane, enhancing the 
intensity of particular frequencies. The sound wave 
impinges on the tympanic membrane and the energy is 
transferred to this structure, where it is passed on to the 
structures of the middle and inner ear.
 2. The Eustachian tube is a narrow passageway from the 
nasopharynx to the anterior wall of the middle ear. 
Muscles of the Eustachian tube contract and open the 
passageway during swallowing and yawning. Open-
ing of this tube serves to equalize the pressure of the 
air-fi lled middle-ear space with atmospheric pressure. 
An individual on an airplane, who experiences rapid 
changes in atmospheric pressure during ascent and 
descent, may easily appreciate this function. The ears 
feel “plugged” until swallowing or yawning opens the 
Eustachian tube, and the pressure of the middle-ear 
space is equalized.
When the Eustachian tube fails to function prop-
erly, the trapped air of the middle-ear space is gradu-
ally absorbed by the mucosa of the middle-ear space, 
creating a negative pressure in the middle ear, relative 
to atmospheric pressure. The vacuum  created by this 
pressure differential is can result in an accumulation 
of fl uid, secreted from the fl uid in the mucosa, in the 
middle space. The presence of fl uid in the middle-ear 
space contributes to an attenuation of sound passing 
through the middle-ear system because more energy 
is lost when sound travels through fl uid than through 
air. This attenuation creates a conductive hearing loss.
In addition, infectious material may spread to the 
middle-ear space from the area of the nasopharynx, 
via the Eustachian tube. In such cases, the fl uid of 
the middle ear may become infected, leading to severe 
pain, as infl ammation and fl uid in the middle ear com-
bine to create pressure on the tympanic membrane. 
The tympanic membrane may even rupture, given 
suffi cient pressure. Toxins from the infectious process 
may ultimately invade the cochlea itself, causing a 
sensory component to hearing loss as well.
 3. The sensitivity of the auditory system varies as a 
function of frequency. It is more common to measure 
sound in sound pressure level rather than sound 
intensity. However, both measures are expressed in 
units of decibels, and when describing sound, both 
properties are expressed as relative measures. The ref-
erence used for these measures is the lowest intensity 
or pressure that is capable of displacing individual air 
particles over a very small distance.
The ratio of the absolute level to the reference 
level would be an extremely large range over the range 
between the softest and loudest sounds that humans 
can perceive. In order to reduce these levels into man-
ageable numbers, the logarithm to the base ten of the 
ratio of the two intensities is used. This value is known 
as the Bel.

710  APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
cells become stimulated at a lower intensity level than 
without the functioning of the outer hair cells.
 5. There is a fl uid known as endolymph contained within 
the membranous labyrinth of the semicircular canals 
of the vestibular system. When the head moves in a 
particular direction, the fl uid moves in the opposite 
direction. The force of the fl ow of endolymph exerts 
pressure on the cupula in the semicircular canal, caus-
ing a defl ection. The defl ection of the cupula causes 
movement of the stereocilia embedded in the hair 
cells of the crista, the vestibular sensory organ. Move-
ment of the stereocilia allows for chemical signaling 
of the hair cells to transduce the mechanical energy 
to electrical energy, which is then carried by the ves-
tibular portion of the VIIIth cranial nerve to the brain. 
Depending on the direction of the head turn, the ste-
reocilia are either defl ected away from the kinocilium 
(the long protruding fi ber from the hair cell), causing 
a decrease in baseline electrical activity, or toward the 
kinocilium resulting in an increase in baseline electri-
cal activity. Because the semicircular canals are orga-
nized into functional pairs on each side of the head, 
movement in one direction will cause an increase in 
electrical fi ring activity on one side and a correspond-
ing decrease in electrical fi ring activity in the related 
organ on the opposite side of the head. Incorporation 
of these changes in the rate of electrical activity re-
ceived from both organs is made in the brain to allow 
for deduction of the angular acceleration of the head.

Although the Bel is an easier value to use than 
the ratio itself, the Bel is too large of a unit to ad-
equately express the sensitivity of the auditory system 
capabilities. Therefore a fraction of the Bel, 1/10, 
known as the decibel (dB) is used for describing sound 
intensity and sound pressure levels. When describing 
sound intensity, the term dB IL (intensity level) is used, 
and the reference level for intensity is provided. When 
describing sound pressure level, the term dB SPL 
(sound pressure level) is used, and the reference level 
for sound pressure is provided.
Sound pressure level is the more commonly used 
measure when referring to auditory capabilities of 
humans. As mentioned before, the sound pressure 
levels to which humans are sensitive are not the same 
across frequencies. Humans are most sensitive to 
frequencies that are in the speech range (about 500–
4000 Hz), and are less sensitive to higher and lower 
frequency sounds. Because of this, it would be rather 
diffi cult to understand an individual’s relative level 
of diffi culty hearing if their sensitivity was expressed 
in dB SPL as the level of “normal” would vary as a 
function of frequency.
In order to minimize confusion, the concept of 
dB HL (hearing level) was developed. A reference level 
was developed by determining the threshold levels of 
audiometric frequencies for a group of otologically 
healthy young adults (people with normal hearing). 
The sound pressure levels that were determined to be at 
threshold then became the reference levels for 0 dB HL. 
The audiometer, which provides signals for hearing 
testing, is calibrated to these levels. The use of dB HL 
allows for deviations from normal-hearing levels to be 
more clearly understood than if dB SPL was used.
 4. The outer hair cells function as the cochlear ampli-
fi er. They work to increase the hearing sensitivity of 
the cochlea. The inner hair cells, which have afferent 
connections to the brain, respond to defl ections of ste-
reocilia, caused by change in the fl ow of cochlear fl uid 
that occurs in response to movement of the basilar 
membrane in response to sound vibrations. The fl ow 
of fl uid is only strong enough to cause stereocilia de-
fl ections in response to higher intensity sounds.
The fl ow of cochlear fl uid is infl uenced by the 
location of the tectorial membrane relative to the 
basilar membrane. Unlike the inner hair cells, the tips 
of the outer hair cells are embedded in the tectorial 
membrane, which overlies the basilar membrane. In 
response to softer intensity sounds, the outer hair cells 
contract, causing the tectorial membrane to change its 
location relative to the basilar membrane. This change 
in the relative location of the tectorial membrane to the 
basilar membrane changes the dynamics of the fl uid 
fl ow in such a way that the stereocilia of the inner hair 

APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  711
signal as do children with normal hearing. Diffi culties 
in classroom performance might result in frustration 
and diminished motivation on the part of the student. 
Children may be unable to follow directions and 
appear distractible. These factors could contribute to 
the impression of an attention defi cit disorder.
In addition, some children with auditory process-
ing disorder may have concomitant disorders. Due 
to the presence of these disorders, the presence of an 
auditory processing disorder may fail to be considered 
by referral sources.
 3. Common consequences of a sensorineural hearing 
loss include: a reduction in cochlear sensitivity; a 
reduction in frequency resolution; and a reduction in 
the dynamic range of the hearing sensitivity mecha-
nism. A hearing aid will assist in the fi rst of these con-
sequences, by increasing the intensity of the auditory 
signal. An increased auditory signal will allow the 
cochlea to sense the auditory signal at levels that will 
be audible to the impaired system.
A hearing aid will not provide assistance for the 
other common consequences of a sensorineural hear-
ing loss. The reduction in frequency resolution that 
occurs in a sensorineural hearing loss results in the 
addition of distortion to the auditory signal. Distortion 
causes the auditory signal to be changed from its origi-
nal source and reduces the intelligibility of the speech 
signal. An increase in the intensity of the signal, such 
as that provided by the output of a hearing aid, will 
merely increase the audibility of the distorted signal. 
Additional increases in intensity may even add distor-
tion to the auditory signal. A hearing aid will not help 
to reduce distortion that occurs as a consequence of 
sensorineural hearing loss.
The third common consequence of a sen-
sorineural hearing loss, a reduction in the dynamic 
range of the hearing mechanism, impacts the abil-
ity to utilize a hearing aid to increase audibility. The 
abnormal growth of loudness provides a smaller 
“window” of usable hearing that can be conceivably 
amplifi ed. When sounds are already perceived to be 
loud, which occurs at a low sensation level in the case 
of a reduced dynamic range, only a small range of 
 intensity levels can be amplifi ed. Sophisticated hear-
ing aid technology is required to modify the speech 
signal so that soft intensity sounds are perceived as 
soft, medium sounds as medium, and loud sounds as 
loud , but not too loud.
 4. The cause of a functional hearing loss is related to in-
ternal or external gain. An external gain provides re-
inforcement that is extrinsic to the individual, such as 
monetary gain. Internal gain provides reinforcement 
that is intrinsic to the individual, such as psychologi-

 1. Some believe that fl uctuating conductive hearing 
losses can have a negative impact during the criti-
cal period of speech and language development, as a 
result of a prolonged period of inconsistent auditory 
stimulation. It is thought that because children learn 
speech and language through repeated exposure to 
the hearing modality, interruptions to the quality 
of this signal through repeated episodes of hearing 
loss might reduce the developing child’s ability to 
utilize the auditory signal effectively during auditory 
development.
Factors that may contribute to poorer outcomes 
with transient, fl uctuating conductive losses are 
numerous. The frequency of hearing loss episodes is 
one such factor. More frequent episodes may result in 
greater negative impact because the auditory signal 
is more frequently degraded. The degree of hearing 
loss would be expected to have an impact because a 
greater degree of hearing loss results in a less audible 
signal. The duration of the hearing loss in the case of 
a transient hearing loss may be a factor. Some causes 
of conductive hearing loss, such as acute otitis me-
dia, may resolve over a short period of time or may 
evolve into longer lasting episodes, such as chronic 
otitis media. The longer the child is exposed to the 
degraded auditory signal, the greater the predicted 
consequences on speech and language development. 
The age and language development level of the child 
may have an impact on the consequences of transient 
hearing losses. If the hearing loss occurs at a particu-
larly critical point in speech and language develop-
ment, the negative effect of the loss could theoretically 
be greater. There are patient factors that may help to 
compensate for the effects of a hearing loss, such as 
high intelligence. A child without such compensating 
factors could suffer greater negative consequences 
from even a transient hearing loss. In fact, some chil-
dren may be prone to conductive hearing losses as a 
component of a larger syndrome complex, such as 
Down’s syndrome, in which other symptoms could 
conceivably compound the impact of the hearing loss 
for the child.
 2. The consequences of auditory processing disorders in 
children can include: reduced ability to understand 
in background noise; reduced ability to understand 
speech of reduced redundancy, reduced ability to 
 localize and lateralize sound; reduced ability to separate 
dichotic stimuli; and reduced ability to process normal 
or altered temporal cues. The reduced ability to per-
ceive speech in a hostile acoustic environment, such 
as might be found in a classroom setting, might mimic 
the outcomes of a language impairment or learning 
disability, because a child is unable to utilize the speech

 1. Hearing loss can often be treated medically, depending 
on the underlying cause. Treatment includes medica-
tions, such as the use of antibiotics for the treatment 
of acute otitis media and immunosuppressant drugs 
for the treatment of autoimmune inner ear disorder. 
Other treatments may be used, such as surgical proce-
dures for placement of pressure equalization tubes for 
management of chronic otitis media or replacement 
of the stapes with a prosthesis to treat stapes fi xation. 
Understanding of the underlying cause of a hearing 
disorder is important in determining whether hearing 
loss can be treated.
Knowing the underlying cause of a hearing 
disorder is also important in the management of the 
hearing loss. Progressive hearing loss is a character-
istic of certain etiologies of hearing loss. Expecting 
that a hearing loss may continue to develop over time 
will be an important aspect of counseling patients 
and planning for follow-up. It may also be important 
to understand additional characteristics of a disorder 
that may impact treatment decisions for hearing loss. 
For example, progressive loss of vision is an expected 
outcome of Usher syndrome. Therefore, it may not be 
benefi cial for a patient with Usher syndrome to utilize 
a manual communication system or to be counseled 
to rely very heavily on visual cues for speech percep-
tion given the expectation that visual acuity will 
decline over time.
Additionally, in cases of hereditary hearing 
losses, families may be counseled to have appropriate 
expectations regarding future occurrences of hearing 
loss with additional offspring.
 2. The Eustachian tube is a passageway between the 
middle-ear space and the nasopharynx. It is normally 
closed. The Eustachian tube opens in order to equalize 
The intent of a functional hearing loss exists on 
a continuum from intentional to unintentional. With 
an intentional functional hearing loss, the person 
is aware of the behavior and purposefully feigns or 
exaggerates a hearing loss. With an unintentional 
functional hearing loss, the person is unaware of the 
motivations and actions in feigning their hearing loss.
Gain and intent are typically both factors in 
the various motivations for functional hearing loss. 
In a case of malingering, the patient is intentionally 
feigning or exaggerating a hearing loss for external 
motivation. In the case of a factitious disorder, a per-
son intentionally feigns or exaggerates a hearing loss 
to achieve an internal psychological benefi t from the 
assumption of a sick role. In a conversion disorder, the 
symptoms of hearing loss occur unintentionally. This 
often occurs for psychological benefi t following some 
form of distress.
 5. Although a mild hearing loss would be unlikely to in-
terfere with the audibility of most phonemes, patient 
factors may contribute to a signifi cantly negative func-
tional impact from this degree of hearing loss. The age 
of  onset of the hearing loss may contribute to the ef-
fects of a mild hearing loss. A child who has developed 
a hearing loss prelingually may experience a greater 
impact from the mild hearing loss because the devel-
opment of spoken language requires greater access 
to the auditory signal. A child may also be negatively 
impacted with a mild hearing loss in an acoustically 
challenging environment, such as a classroom setting. 
While FM systems or other assistive listening devices 
may assist in such settings, mild hearing losses are 
generally missed in hearing screenings.
An individual with a mild hearing loss will be 
differentially affected depending on communication 
needs. An individual whose occupation depends on 
a high degree of communication ability is likely to be 
quite challenged by even a mild hearing loss, especially 
if working in an acoustically hostile environment.
In addition, the type of hearing loss can impact 
the consequences of a mild hearing loss. A hearing 
loss that adds substantial distortion to the signal, such 
as may occur in some sensorineural hearing loss or 
a retrocochlear lesion in which speech recognition is 
substantively affected, may have considerable func-
tional consequences.

hearing loss due a solely to the effects of aging cannot 
be precisely determined.
 5. Given a particular frequency composition of a sound, 
the impact of that sound on the auditory system 
 becomes a function of both the intensity and duration 
of the noise exposure. It is generally held that a sub-
stantial amount of noise-induced hearing loss is due to 
the effects of metabolic exhaustion and ischemic dam-
age to the hair cells of the cochlea. During both expo-
sure to high-intensity noise and excessive noise of long 
duration, the hair cells are forced to work beyond their 
typical capacity. At high intensities, the hair cells can 
only maintain this level for a certain period before dam-
age occurs. For extremely high intensities, the amount 
of time before damage occurs is very limited. (Imagine 
how a runner doing a sprint can run for a short time at 
a very fast rate, but the runner could not maintain the 
same speed when running over a very long distance).
Damage-risk criteria are guidelines that have 
been developed to defi ne the maximum noise levels 
that individuals may be exposed to (particularly for an 
occupational environment) for a given period of time. 
In the United States, this amounts to a 5 dB doubling 
rate, meaning that for every 5 dB increase in intensity, 
the amount of time that would be safe to be exposed 
to decreases by half. For example, a 90 dBA sound 
would be considered safe for 8 hours, while a 95 dBA 
sound would be considered safe for only 4 hours. Be-
yond these levels, damage to the hearing mechanism 
is likely to occur for many individuals.
In addition, there is evidence that individuals 
have different susceptibility to noise exposure than 
others. Some individuals may experience damage at 
lower levels than is typical for the larger population 
and may therefore require noise-protection in lower 
intensity sound environments. Unfortunately, individ-
ual susceptibility is typically not discovered until a cer-
tain amount of hearing damage has already occurred.
 6. Many causes of hearing loss may be compounded 
by exposure to ototoxic medications. In cases of 
 infections that cause hearing loss, an example being 
opportunistic infections that may occur with AIDS, 
the infection itself may contribute to hearing loss, 
and ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotics may be ad-
ministered to ward off infection, also contributing to 
hearing loss. A similar situation may occur in cases 
of perinatal illness or prematurity. Both have a high 
likelihood of hearing loss in and of themselves, but 
the hearing loss is further impacted by life-sustaining 
antibiotics medications typically administered.
In other cases, ototoxic medications may work 
synergistically when administered together, having a 
greater affect on hearing loss than either medication 
would alone. For instance, if a patient with kidney 
the pressure in the middle-ear space. It does so upon 
activities such as swallowing or yawning. When the 
Eustachian tube is not functioning properly, it fails 
to open appropriately. When this occurs, pressure in 
the middle-ear space does not become equalized with 
atmospheric pressure, leading to infl ammation of the 
lining of the middle ear and negative middle-ear pres-
sure. The relative negative pressure of the middle ear 
causes a vacuum and may result in effusion of fl uid 
into the middle-ear space from the mucous membrane 
of the middle-ear cavity. This fl uid builds up in the 
middle-ear space, ultimately impeding the normal 
functioning of the ossicles and tympanic membrane. 
Many times  Eustachian tube dysfunction occurs as a 
result of  upper respiratory infection. As the nasophar-
ynx and related structures, such as the adenoids, 
become infl amed, the opening of the Eustachian tube 
into the nasopharynx may become blocked. In addi-
tion, if infected material enters the middle-ear space, 
this can cause the effusion to become infected.
Otitis media with effusion is more commonly 
found among children than adults. The main rea-
sons for this are believed to be primarily structural: 
children have shorter Eustachian tubes, that are at a 
different angle plane than those of adults. Eustachian 
tubes of children are also more compliant and as such 
may not allow adequate ventilation. Lastly, children 
typically have greater occurrence of upper respira-
tory infections than adults, which may contribute to 
the relatively greater occurrence of otitis media in 
children.
 3. Both syndromic and nonsyndromic disorders can be 
genetic, inherited from parents. In both cases, genetic 
inheritance can be autosomal dominant, autosomal 
recessive, or X-linked. Syndromic and nonsyndromic 
disorder can both be present at birth or occur later in 
life as a progressive hearing loss.
Syndromic hearing disorders occur as a part of a 
larger set of disorders that occur together. Not all syn-
dromic disorders are necessarily the result of genetic 
causes. Some may be infl uenced by environmental 
factors. A nonsyndromic hearing disorder is a genetic 
condition in which there is no signifi cant feature other 
than hearing loss.
 4. Presbyacusis is defi ned as a decline in hearing that 
 occurs as a part of the aging process. It is clear, 
 however, that over the course of a lifetime, individuals 
are likely to be exposed to numerous conditions and 
disease processes that can have a negative impact on 
hearing, including noise exposure, vascular and sys-
temic disease, exposure to environmental toxins, and 
ototoxic medications. It is diffi cult, if not impossible, to 
control for these myriad effects when examining the 
hearing of individuals longitudinally. This means that 

714  APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
suffi cient funds to provide universal newborn hearing 
screening, it may be deemed necessary to forgo hear-
ing screening in favor of applying available resources 
to lifesaving measures or toward treatment. In ad-
dition, in cases where resources are scarce, person-
nel and/or funding may not be available to provide 
adequate treatment for children identifi ed as having 
hearing loss. Without provision of appropriate inter-
vention, identifi cation of infants with hearing loss 
provides little or no benefi t.
Some professionals suggest that universal new-
born hearing screening provides a false “sense of 
security” regarding the status of hearing in children. 
Hearing losses in children can occur later in life, due 
to acquired, late onset, and/or progressive hearing 
losses. It is felt by some that medical professionals and 
parents may believe that once a child passes a hearing 
screening at birth, there is no further need for vigi-
lance in assessing hearing. The argument is made that 
children may be better served by educating medical 
professionals about risk factors and signs for hearing 
loss, as well as normal speech and language develop-
ment, and to rely on referrals from medical personnel 
for audiologic assessment rather than on referrals 
from universal newborn hearing screening programs.
 2. The characteristics of a hearing loss (degree, confi gu-
ration, type) do not provide suffi cient information for 
understanding the degree of impact that a hearing 
loss can have on an individual. While the ability to 
understand speech is generally poorer with greater 
degrees of hearing loss, the relationship between these 
factors is not complete. Some individuals experience 
signifi cant impairment in their ability to communicate 
with others as a result of a given hearing loss, while 
others may experience relatively little impairment 
with the same degree of hearing loss. Factors such 
as speechreading ability, cognitive ability, language 
development, etc., can contribute to the ability to 
 communicate effectively.
The lifestyle of an individual plays a large role 
in how important effective communication is to a 
patient. A patient whose occupation and social activi-
ties rely heavily on the ability to perceive spoken com-
munication is more likely to experience a signifi cant 
negative effect from a hearing loss than an individual 
who does not rely as extensively on oral communica-
tion. The inability to participate in even a few activities 
as a result of hearing loss can result in signifi cant self-
perceived handicap for an individual, if the events are 
of great importance for quality of life for a patient.
Knowledge of disability and handicap imposed 
by a hearing loss is important in determining goals 
and objectives for treatment of hearing loss. An indi-
vidual who is signifi cantly negatively impacted by a 
disease contracts an infection requiring amingoglyco-
side antibiotics, a synergistic affect can occur. This is 
because such a patient would likely also be exposed to 
loop diuretics for management of kidney disease.
 7. Patients often report that they experience a sensation 
of “dizziness.” This term is vague and does not provide 
enough information to unambiguously discern a di-
agnosis. More specifi c terms would include: balance 
disturbance, lightheadedness, loss of balance, etc. Ver-
tigo, an abnormal sensation of movement, is likely to 
occur with vestibular disorders. Other types of “dizzy” 
sensations are likely to occur in response to central or 
systemic disorders.
There are numerous disorders that can result in 
such a symptom, and many medications can also cause 
dizziness in patients. Often, the only way to determine the 
cause of dizziness is to provide treatment and evaluate 
the results of treatment, or to provide additional testing. 
Vestibular testing is useful for determining the presence 
or absence of disorders of the vestibular system.

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. The use of insert earphones is benefi cial in preventing 
the occurrence of collapsing ear canals during hearing 
testing. Particularly in the older adult population, ear 
canal cartilage may be very pliable. The use of supra-
aural headphones with such individuals often results 
in a collapse of the ear canal, which causes a conduc-
tive loss to occur during testing because sound cannot 
reach the tympanic membrane appropriately. Insert 
earphones, by nature of their placement in the ear 
 canal itself, prevent this phenomenon from occurring.
A second advantage of using insert earphones is 
the reduced need to mask. The need to mask is deter-
mined by the amount of interaural attenuation that 
occurs during presentation of a sound. The interaural 
hearing loss may be more motivated to utilize personal 
hearing instruments than an individual who is not. In 
order to provide services to patients, it is necessary to 
determine in what ways their hearing disorder impacts 
them personally.
 3. Understanding why a patient is being evaluated is 
critical in tailoring the evaluation to ensure that 
the most important goals of a particular assessment 
are met. To do this in the most effi cient and effective 
manner, it is necessary to understand how the infor-
mation that the audiologist obtains will be utilized. 
Knowledge of the referral source is often helpful in 
elucidating the goals for assessment as well as infor-
mation gleaned from the case history. Having an un-
derstanding of a patient’s particular goals for hearing 
assessment are important in the counseling provided 
to a patient during and following testing procedures, 
and in selection and administration of appropriate 
audiologic tests. In addition, a level of vigilance re-
garding detection of functional hearing loss can be 
cued by the reason for referral.
 4. The use of additional procedures to verify and/or 
supplement fi ndings describes a cross-check. There is 
no perfect way to measure true hearing ability. Each 
assessment tool available for evaluation of hearing 
has its own particular accuracy as well as limitations. 
Therefore, multiple methods of assessing the integrity 
of the auditory system are often utilized. The over-
all impressions from these tests are then utilized to 
determine hearing ability. Examples of cross-checks 
include the use of speech recognition thresholds to 
verify the pure-tone average of the speech frequencies 
(500, 1000, and 2000 Hz); the use of tympanometry 
to support the presence of a conductive hearing loss; 
and the use of acoustic refl ex thresholds to support 
suspicion of retrocochlear pathology.
 5. Objective measures are useful for testing the functional 
integrity of particular structures of the auditory sys-
tem. These types of measures are helpful in predicting 
auditory function in individuals who are incapable of, 
or uncooperative in providing behavioral responses to 
auditory stimuli. Certain measures, such as the auditory 
brainstem response, are also helpful in providing precise 
temporal information regarding the response of the 
auditory pathway, which can provide important clues 
about potential lesions in the auditory nervous system, 
such as cochleovestibular schwanomma.
Hearing is a process of perception that is realized 
at the highest levels of the central nervous system, in 
the auditory cortex. While objectives measures provide 
information about the structures of the auditory system, 
they do not provide insight into the ultimate integration 
and interpretation of the sensory information received by 
the auditory system. The response of the central  auditory 

716  APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
allow thresholds to be recorded for an ear with high 
thresholds, which might not be observable otherwise 
due to limitations of the bone vibrator output. A sec-
ond advantage to mastoid placement is that there is 
some interaural attenuation for the higher frequencies 
typically tested. This allows for the ear to be some-
what isolated when testing, compared to the lower 
frequencies. If there is a relatively small asymmetry, 
placement of the bone oscillator on the mastoid of the 
poorer ear may result in thresholds that demonstrate 
a sensorineural hearing loss (lack of an air-bone gap) 
without the need to mask. A disadvantage of the mas-
toid placement is that in order to mask for both ears, 
it is necessary to switch the oscillator and earphones 
between the tests for each ear. This requires an addi-
tional trip into the sound booth, costing valuable time.
Another placement location for the bone oscil-
lator is the forehead. This area provides for a stable 
placement of the bone oscillator because it is relatively 
fl at in comparison to the mastoid location. In forehead 
placement, earphones are kept in place for masking of 
each ear individually. Because neither ear is isolated, it 
is necessary to mask each of the ears. This is easily ac-
complished because earphones are kept in place over 
both ears during testing. With forehead placement, it 
is possible to have masked thresholds for each ear with 
only one trip into the sound booth, versus the two trips 
necessary with mastoid placement. A disadvantage 
to this placement location is that the measurement 
of thresholds with earphones in place will create an 
occlusion effect for the lower frequencies tested. This 
occlusion effect will need to be corrected for when 
 determining accurate thresholds.
 4. The fi rst step in the plateau method is to fi nd the 
unmasked bone conduction threshold. Next, mask-
ing noise is added to the nontest ear just above the 
threshold for air conduction in that ear. The bone-
conduction signal is again presented to determine 
whether the threshold remains stable, or the inten-
sity is raised to fi nd the new threshold level. Addi-
tional intensity is then added to the masking noise, 
and the process is repeated.
Initially, as the intensity of the masking noise 
is raised on each successive trial, in the case of a 
sensorineural hearing loss the threshold of the bone-
conduction signal will begin to increase. This is be-
cause there is now an effective level of masking noise 
being presented to the nontest ear to begin to mask the 
nontest ear. The intensity range in which the bone-
conduction threshold continues to be elevated is an 
area of undermasking.
When there is suffi cient intensity of masking 
noise in the nontest ear to completely mask the bone-
conduction signal, the bone-conduction threshold 
attenuation is the amount by which sound is damp-
ened by the structures of the head before it reaches the 
opposite cochlea. The minimum values for interaural 
attenuation are high for insert earphones because of 
their small surface area, meaning that they require a 
large amount of intensity before they are suffi cient to 
cause cross-hearing. This means that there is less need 
to mask because there can be a greater difference in 
hearing thresholds between the ears before one must 
be “kept busy.”
A third advantage of using insert earphones 
is the greater likelihood of correct earphone place-
ment, with greater stability once the earphone is in 
place. Soft, pliable foam inserts are typically used to 
house the end of the insert earphone so that the ear-
phone will remain fi rmly in the ear canal once placed. 
Whereas misplacement of the insert earphone is 
unlikely to occur, the correct placement of the supra-
aural headphone can sometimes be diffi cult to achieve. 
The transducer of the earphone in a supra-aural 
earphone must be placed directly over the ear canal 
opening in order for the appropriate signal intensity to 
reach the tympanic membrane.
The use of supra-aural earphones is preferred for 
patients who have a draining ear, as insert earphones 
cannot be placed in such an ear canal. For patients 
with stenotic (very small) ear canals or with atresia 
(absence of an ear canal), the use of insert earphones 
may not be possible.
 2. The measurement used to quantify hearing sensitiv-
ity is the threshold of audibility. The intensity level at 
which threshold occurs is just barely audible. Many 
listeners tend to be overly responsive when listening 
for such sounds, providing positive responses when no 
stimulus has occurred. Other listeners tend to be more 
conservative, waiting until they are absolutely certain 
that they hear a sound before responding. This results 
in responses to levels that are higher than “just au-
dible.” It is necessary for patients to respond to sounds 
as closely as possible to their true threshold level. 
Therefore, for the sake of obtaining accurate mea-
surements, it is necessary for patients be instructed 
regarding what they are listening for and how they are 
expected to respond.
It is important to note that even though a patient 
may be properly instructed, misunderstanding of the 
required task may still occur. In such cases it may be 
necessary to re-instruct the patient on how to respond 
appropriately. It is important to remember that many 
individuals may not have participated in a hearing test 
before and are naïve test-takers.
 3. One commonly used placement location for the bone 
oscillator is the mastoid bone behind the ear. This area 
provides for the lowest levels of thresholds. This may

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. Speech awareness and speech threshold measures 
are used to determine the softest levels of speech that 
can be detected or recognized, respectively. The main 
purpose of these measures is to check the reliability 
of the pure-tone thresholds that are obtained. Speech 
awareness/detection measures will typically be 5–10 dB 
lower than speech-recognition threshold measures. 
This testing is typically performed using monitored-
live-voice for the sake of effi ciency. Speech threshold 
testing is typically performed using spondees — two-
syllable words that have equal stress on each syllable. 
Speech awareness/detection and threshold measures 
are measured as the lowest level at which about 50% 
of the words are correctly identifi ed or repeated. Be-
cause the purpose of these measures is to determine 
the lowest level at which person can hear, rather than 
how well a person understands speech, the materials 
used are common, easy-to-learn words, and the lis-
tener is  familiarized with the materials prior to testing.
Word-recognition testing is used to determine 
how well a person hears speech when it is made au-
dible in an ideal listening situation. The main purposes 
of these measures are to understand the patient’s 
suprathreshold hearing abilities and to use as a tool 
for identifi cation in site-of-lesion testing. This testing is 
typically performed using recorded materials in order 
to be able to provide reliable measures over time and 
from tester to tester, and even from test to test with 
the same speaker. Monosyllabic words are used for 
word-recognition testing. The word lists utilized are 
phonetically or phonemically balanced, meaning the 
lists represent the occurrence of sounds or groups of 
that is measured will represent the true threshold 
of the test ear. The bone-conduction threshold will 
remain stable over several increases in presentation 
intensity level. The range in which this true masking 
occurs is known as the plateau.
At a certain point, elevation of the masking 
noise begins, once again, to increase the level of the 
measured bone-conduction threshold. This occurs 
because the intensity of the masking noise is so high 
that it actually is cross-heard in the test ear. This cross-
hearing in the test ear causes the bone-conduction sig-
nal to be masked in the test ear as well, which causes 
the threshold to be raised. At this point, overmasking 
is occurring.
The bone-conduction threshold that is found at 
the plateau level is the true bone-conduction threshold 
for the test ear.
 5. A masking dilemma occurs when the difference 
between the bone-conduction threshold and the air-
conduction threshold in the nontest ear is near the 
amount of interaural attenuation. In this case, the 
amount of masking that is required to be effective at 
masking the nontest ear is so high that it crosses over 
to the test ear and causes overmasking. The best way 
of coping with a masking dilemma is to use insert 
earphones, rather than supra-aural earphones. This 
is because there is a greater amount of interaural 
attenuation with insert earphones, making it less 
likely to cause overmasking. However, in some cases, 
even with insert earphones, a masking dilemma 
does occur. In these cases, it may not be possible to 
obtain valid air- or bone-conduction audiometric 
thresholds.
 6. Tuning fork tests are still used quite often in clinical 
practice by audiologists and otologists. Typically, the 
tests are performed using a bone oscillator rather 
than a tuning fork when done by audiologists. These 
tests are helpful as a cross-check for the validity of 
bone-conduction audiometric results. They help to 
verify the presence or absence of conductive hearing 
disorders. In some instances, the immittance results 
for a patient may not “agree with” bone-conduction 
threshold measures. In such cases, it may be especially 
helpful to use tuning fork tests in order to determine 
whether a conductive hearing loss or possible middle-
ear disorder exists.

word-recognition score is to determine whether the 
results are consistent with the degree of hearing loss. 
This is an important question to answer because lack 
of consistency with the degree of hearing loss can be 
indicative of a retrocochlear disorder. In order to an-
swer this question, the percentage of words correct is 
compared to what is expected based on normative data 
that has been determined empirically. These norms 
were developed using commercially recorded materials. 
Therefore, it is necessary to use recorded materials in 
testing in order to be able to compare results with the 
normative data.
Another common use of the word-recognition 
score is to assess change in performance over time. 
Again, this can help to indicate problems such as 
retrocochlear disorder that may begin to demonstrate 
effects over time as an acoustic tumor grows in size. 
The ability to compare results from one test to the next 
depends on the use of recorded test materials because 
presentation of materials using monitored-live-voice 
has the potential to be dramatically different among 
clinics, among testers, and even with the same test on 
different occasions.
 4. The central auditory nervous system has a great deal 
of redundancy inherent in the innervation patterns 
and anatomic makeup of the system. This allows for 
damage to occur in the central auditory nervous sys-
tem without obvious effects on hearing sensitivity or 
speech perception abilities. However, when damage or 
developmental problems occur in the central auditory 
nervous system, there can be subtle effects on sound 
processing abilities.
The speech signal itself that is used to measure 
processing ability is also highly redundant. This ex-
trinsic redundancy is due to the wealth of information 
present in the phonetic, phonemic, syntactic, and 
semantic characteristics of the speech signal. So, even 
when an individual has defi cits that are present in the 
central auditory system, the extrinsic redundancy of 
the signal can be used to facilitate speech understand-
ing, thereby masking the defi cit.
By sensitizing the speech signal, the extrinsic 
redundancy is reduced in some way. This reduction 
of redundancy may be helpful in revealing the cen-
tral nervous system defi cit that would otherwise be 
masked by use of typical speech stimuli.
 5. Speech audiometry materials can be open set, 
meaning that the response choice can be any of all 
available targets in a language, or closed set, where 
the response choice is from a limited set. The use 
of closed-set test materials tends to result in higher 
scores than would be found from open-set materials 
because the responses that the patient must decide on 
are limited in number.
sounds in a spoken language. Word-recognition scores 
are measured as the percentage of words correct from 
the list presented. Performance at a given presentation 
level can provide clues as to whether a retrocochlear 
site of lesion may exist for a given patient. At particu-
larly high presentation levels, the phenomenon of 
rollover can occur during speech testing in cases of 
retrocochlear lesions, where the patient performs 
 better under lower intensity conditions.
Sensitized speech measures are used to de-
termine the defi cits resulting from disorder in the 
auditory pathways of the central nervous system. 
This testing is typically performed using recorded 
materials, which have been altered in a manner that 
reduces the extrinsic redundancy of the signal. The 
most successful use of sensitized speech measures 
has been the use of a speech signal with a competing 
message. Dichotic listening tests in which different 
speech signals are presented simultaneously to the 
two ears, are also used. Reduced performance in 
particular tests indicates defi cits in particular areas 
of processing or lesions within particular areas of the 
central nervous system.
 2. The task of identifying sounds that are “just audible” 
as is the case in pure-tone threshold testing can be 
diffi cult for some patients. Some patients are prone to 
overresponding or providing responses when sounds 
are not present. Other patients do not respond until 
they are certain that they have heard a sound, which 
leads to elevated thresholds. The task of responding 
to words, however, takes much of the guesswork out 
of deciding what a “real” stimulus is. Therefore, the 
speech-recognition threshold may in some cases be 
a more accurate measure of threshold of sound. If 
the thresholds measured for speech frequencies (500, 
1000, and 2000 Hz) do not match the speech-recogni-
tion threshold, the patient may need re-instruction on 
the pure-tone threshold testing task.
While some patients may have diffi culty in un-
derstanding the pure-tone testing task, other patients 
may provide responses that are consistent with a 
functional hearing loss. In this case, because speech 
stimuli are perceived as louder than individual pure 
tones, most patients will have diffi culty accurately 
judging the intensity of the speech signal compared 
to the pure-tone signals. This typically results in the 
speech-recognition threshold being signifi cantly lower 
than the pure-tone average. Such a difference persist-
ing after re-instruction of the patient should increase 
the suspicion of a functional hearing loss.
 3. The advantage of using monitored-live-voice over 
recorded materials is that testing is faster. The advan-
tages of using recorded testing materials outweigh 
this advantage in most situations. One use of the 

APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  719
In cases where it is known from immittance mea-
sures that there is likely middle-ear dysfunction, this 
can alert the audiologist to the likelihood of an air-
bone gap occurring during pure-tone testing. This can 
be helpful when testing patients who are more diffi cult 
to test behaviorally, such as children.
Another possible advantage of conducting 
immittance testing at the outset of the hearing test 
battery is that it can be shown to patients that objec-
tive measures can be made that provide important 
information regarding the functioning of the hearing 
mechanism. Such a demonstration may be advanta-
geous in cases where an individual is attempting to 
feign or exaggerate a hearing loss. By demonstrating 
that information can be obtained without the coopera-
tive behavioral responses of the patient, the patient 
who may be tempted to exaggerate or feign a hearing 
loss may be less likely to do so when immittance mea-
sures are performed fi rst.
 2. The goal of audiometric testing is to assess communi-
cation and hearing function. The fi rst such question is 
whether a middle-ear disorder is present. This relates 
to treatment goals, because middle-ear disorders are, 
for the most part, medically treatable. The next ques-
tion is whether the disorder is causing a conductive 
hearing loss. This question will be determined by 
air- and bone-conduction testing. Immittance testing 
provides the answer to the fi rst question that is asked. 
It does so in a manner that is more sensitive than the 
presence of an air-bone gap on pure-tone testing.
 3. A probe with a rubber tip is situated in the ear canal 
of the patient in order to obtain an air-tight seal for 
making measures of air pressure. The probe is con-
nected to the immittance meter with several thin 
rubber tubes, through which sounds and air are 
delivered from the immittance meter where they are 
generated. The probe houses (1) small loudspeaker 
for the delivery of the probe-tone signal and the 
refl ex signal, (2) a small microphone that records 
the acoustic signal in the ear canal, and (3) a tube 
through which air is delivered to the ear canal.
The immittance meter houses the components 
that control the delivery of sound and air to the 
probe. A refl ex signal generator controls and delivers 
refl ex-eliciting signals to ipsilateral and contralateral 
loudspeakers. The probe-tone generator delivers a tone 
of a fi xed frequency and SPL to the probe. The micro-
phone recording and analysis device maintains the 
SPL in the ear canal at a constant level by measuring 
any changes and making adjustments to the sound 
generators. The air-pressure system consists of an air 
pump for generating controlled levels of air pressure 
and a manometer to measure the air pressure in the 
ear canal.
In addition, some speech audiometry materials 
are designed specifi cally for use with particular popula-
tions, such as children. These materials are designed to 
 account for the developing language abilities of children, 
so that the test score is refl ective of hearing ability rather 
than language ability. A test that uses developmentally 
inappropriate materials would likely negatively impact 
test scores and give a false impression of hearing ability.

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. If all immittance measures are normal, then whatever 
hearing loss is determined by pure-tone audiometry 
is sensorineural in nature because immittance audi-
ometry is signifi cantly more sensitive to middle-ear 
disorder than the assessment of air-bone gaps. If an 
air-bone gap is found to exist on pure-tone testing, 
then either air-conduction or bone-conduction thresh-
olds are likely not accurate.
In addition, the knowledge that immittance 
measures are normal at the onset of pure-tone 
testing may be helpful as a time-saving tool because 
some audiologists may choose to forego bone-
conduction testing, particularly in cases of normal 
air-conduction thresholds.

720  APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
 5. Type C tympanograms represent substantial negative 
pressure in the middle-ear space, relative to atmo-
spheric pressure. Type B tympanograms represent in-
creased mass in the middle-ear system, which is often 
the result of fl uid in the middle-ear space. Both types 
of tympanogram results are often outcomes of Eusta-
chian tube dysfunction.
The Eustachian tube is a passageway between 
the middle-ear space and the nasopharynx. It is 
normally closed. The Eustachian tube opens in 
order to equalize the pressure in the middle-ear 
space. It does so upon activities such as swallowing 
or yawning. When the Eustachian tube is not 
functioning properly, it fails to open appropriately. 
When this occurs, pressure in the middle-ear space 
does not become equalized with atmospheric pressure, 
leading to infl ammation of the lining of the middle 
ear and negative middle-ear pressure. Tympanometric 
measurement made at this stage of the dysfunctional 
process would result in type C tympanograms.
The relative negative pressure of the middle ear 
causes a vacuum, followed by effusion of fl uid into 
the middle-ear space from the mucous membrane of 
the middle ear cavity. This fl uid builds up ultimately 
impeding the normal functioning of the ossicles and 
tympanic membrane. Tympanometric measurement 
made at this stage of the dysfunctional process would 
result in type B tympanograms.
 6. The sound is initially transduced to mechanical en-
ergy in the middle-ear space where the ossicles are set 
into motion from movement of the tympanic mem-
brane. Movement of the stapes in the oval window 
transduces the mechanical energy to hydraulic en-
ergy as the movement of fl uid occurs. The inner hair 
cells of the cochlea transduce this hydraulic energy 
to electrical energy, and the electrical signal is sent 
from the cochlea along the VIIIth (vestibuloacoustic) 
cranial nerve.
From the VIIIth cranial nerve, the electrical 
signal is sent to the ventral cochlear nucleus. It is 
then relayed to both the ipsilateral and contralateral 
superior olivary complex. This is the fi rst level of the 
brain where afferent information is received bilater-
ally. From the superior olivary complex, the efferent 
arc of the response begins. The signal is relayed via 
the motor nucleus of the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve. 
The facial nerve innervates the stapedius muscle. The 
tendon of the stapedius muscle is attached to the neck 
of the stapes. Contraction of the stapedius muscle 
causes a pull on the stapes, resulting in the decrease 
of energy transmission to the cochlea by an increase 
in impedance of the middle-ear system.
Disorders that occur at any level of this pathway 
can result in changes to the end result of the acoustic 
For making measures of contralateral acous-
tic refl exes, a second earphone is placed into the 
 patient’s other ear. This is typically an earphone that 
is coupled to the ear using either a foam insert (such 
as that used for insert earphones) or a rubber tip (the 
same as is used for the probe coupling). This ear-
phone serves as the speaker for delivering the refl ex 
signal to the ear.
 4. The most typical middle-ear dysfunction seen in au-
diology practice is caused by the presence of fl uid in 
the middle-ear space. The effect of fl uid is to reduce 
the fl ow of energy through the middle-ear system, 
because energy does not fl ow as well through fl uid 
as through air. In such a case, the admittance is de-
creased and the impedance is increased. Immittance 
measures will refl ect these changes. Other examples 
of middle-ear dysfunction that decrease the admit-
tance and increase impedance of energy fl ow through 
the system are negative pressure in the middle-ear 
space, masses in the middle-ear space that restrict 
movement of the ossicles, fusion of the ossicles, and 
otosclerosis.
In other cases, energy fl ow through the middle-
ear system is increased relative to normal. This will 
result in high admittance and low impedance in the 
system. An example of this would be an ossicular 
discontinuity.
A tympanic membrane perforation has immit-
tance results that refl ect the presence of a very large 
volume of air. This is because the volume of air being 
measured refl ects the air in the ear canal, as would 
normally be measured, and the volume of air in the 
middle-ear space, which is not normally measured. 
The hole in the tympanic membrane causes the mea-
surement to be made of both cavities.
The specifi c effects of the various disorders on 
immittance are a function of the probe tones that are 
used to make measurements. Typically, a 226 Hz probe 
tone is used for measurement of immittance in adults. 
The patterns of fi ndings for middle-ear dysfunction 
described here are characteristic of the fact that a low-
frequency probe tone is used. However, immittance 
meters exist that can also use different frequencies to 
make immittance measures. The fi ndings using this 
type of multifrequency immittance measure can pro-
vide information regarding the characteristics of mass 
versus stiffness effects in the middle-ear system. How-
ever, given that the fi rst question to be answered in the 
hearing test battery is whether or not there is middle-
ear dysfunction present, the fi ndings using the 226 Hz 
probe tone are often suffi cient to answer this question. 
Because multifrequency immittance measures are 
often too sensitive to minor, nonpathologic conditions 
they are typically not used in clinical practice.

APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  721
electrical activity with respect to the stimulus. Over 
repeated presentations, the random activity, which 
has no fi xed pattern, becomes closer to a value of 0 
as it is averaged. However, the time-locked activity 
continues to occur with every presentation. As the 
responses are averaged over and over again, the time-
locked response becomes more enhanced, relative to 
the disappearing, random background activity. In this 
way, the extremely small electrical signal, which could 
not be viewed in ongoing EEG activity, becomes robust 
and easily recognized.
 2. Evoked potential testing is often used for surgical 
monitoring in cases where hearing preservation is 
attempted during the removal of an acoustic tumor. 
During the course of tumor extraction, function of the 
nerve may be infl uenced by physical manipulation, 
thereby affecting the evoked potentials. By monitoring 
the response of the auditory nerve to sounds presented 
to the cochlea, the surgeon can be alerted to the di-
minished or absent response and can take measures to 
prevent further damage from occurring. In addition, 
the nerve may sometimes be intertwined with the 
acoustic tumor to a certain extent. By monitoring the 
responsiveness of the nerve to sound, the surgeon 
can be alerted to damage occurring following tumor 
removal.
 3. The use of the auditory brainstem response is consid-
ered the best method for infant hearing screening. This 
method is valuable because of its objectivity, its speci-
fi city and sensitivity, and its ease of administration. 
Prior to the use of evoked potentials and otoacoustic 
emissions, behavioral testing was the only available 
method for screening the hearing of infants. As can 
be imagined, the responses obtained with behavioral 
methods were diffi cult to interpret for many infants 
due to their unreliable responses. In addition, behav-
ioral responses by infants to sound stimuli were not 
reliable at near-threshold levels. With the advent of 
objective measures, such as evoked potentials, infor-
mation could be obtained regarding the functional 
integrity of the auditory system, without the need for 
behavioral responses from the infant.
Compared to other measures of auditory func-
tion, the ABR has a great deal of specifi city. In cases 
where otoacoustic emissions are used as a screening 
tool for infants, there is a high number of false posi-
tive results. This means that many infants are referred 
for further testing who do not have hearing loss. 
The reason that this occurs so often with the use of 
otoacoustic emissions is that newborns often have 
residual fl uid and debris remaining in the outer-ear 
system following the birth process. These materials 
interfere with the recording of the evoked otoacous-
tic emissions, which lose a great deal of energy in 
refl ex response. As such, the acoustic refl ex response is 
a good way to measure the overall integrity of this path-
way. However, because a number of disorders at any 
level of the pathway will result in the same outcome 
(elevated or absent acoustic refl ex), information gleaned 
from the acoustic refl ex response must be coupled with 
other sources of information (such as tympanometry 
and static immittance) to localize the site of the lesion.

 1. The purpose of signal averaging is to reduce the 
amount of background noise from a recorded signal 
to permit visualization and extraction of the desired 
signal. Signal averaging is the averaging of samples 
of ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in 
order to reduce the background activity and enhance 
the evoked response. Multiple samples are recorded 
over a fi xed time base. The response is time-locked to 
the stimuli, and is recorded in a specifi ed time window.

specifi c, objective information about the children’s 
hearing threshold, they may not be attainable in 
pediatric assessment. This is because these measures 
require minimal movement on the part of the patient, 
necessitating sedation in young children in order to ob-
tain interpretable responses. As such, they are reserved 
for testing in children only when necessary.
 6. Evoked OAEs are commonly used to monitor cochlear 
function in individuals undergoing treatment with 
medications that are likely to be ototoxic (poisonous 
to the ear). There are many such life-sustaining drugs 
that are used. They include medications such as che-
motherapy drugs and antibiotics used to control in-
fection. The fi rst effects that are seen from such drugs 
are typically on the outer hair cells of the cochlea. 
They typically affect the higher frequencies fi rst. By 
measuring outer hair cell function with distortion 
product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), the effects 
of these drugs can be monitored. If the DPOAE results 
indicate that cochlear function has begun to deterio-
rate, dosages may be able to be adjusted to minimize 
the ototoxic effects of the drug.

 1. The primary goals for evaluation of a patient seeking 
otologic care include the determination of the degree 
of hearing loss and the site of disorder. This relates to 
the consequence that a disorder has on the function 
of the outer- and middle-ear structures. The primary 
goals for evaluation of a patient seeking audiologic 
care include determination of the degree of impair-
ment and the prognosis for successful hearing aid use. 
 traveling from the cochlea to the external auditory 
canal. However, it must also be realized that the ABR 
may be absent or abnormal in some infants due to 
neuromaturational delay, which would again cause a 
failure of the hearing screening, even though hearing 
itself may be normal.
The ABR has an advantage over evoked OAEs 
in detection of hearing disorder in the special case of 
auditory neuropathy. In some children, the ABR may 
be abnormal due to a problem with the cochlear in-
ner hair cells or the VIIIth nerve. However, the evoked 
OAEs may be perfectly normal. By screening hearing 
using only evoked OAEs, children with this type of 
anomaly will be incorrectly categorized as having nor-
mal hearing.
Ease of administration is another advantage to 
testing using ABR. Although evoked OAEs are also 
easily administered, the use of automated ABR has 
greatly improved the effi ciency of newborn hearing 
screening. The automated ABR compares record-
ings made from infants to templates that represent 
expected results. If the recordings are suffi ciently like 
the expected results, the infant passes the screening. 
This system is very useful because individuals with 
minimal skills and training can administer testing. In 
addition, both evoked OAEs and ABR testing are insen-
sitive to patient state, so they are easily administered to 
sleeping infants.
 4. Compared to imaging studies, the auditory brainstem 
response (ABR) test is less sensitive to detection of 
small acoustic tumors. However, the auditory symp-
toms that may indicate the presence of a tumor are 
often quite subtle or absent in some individuals. There-
fore, based on fi nancial considerations and patient and 
physician preference, the ABR may fi rst be used as a 
screening tool to determine whether further imaging 
studies are warranted for a given patient. In addition, 
the ABR is often useful in indicating other VIIIth nerve 
or auditory brainstem disorders such as neuritis, 
 multiple sclerosis, or brainstem neoplasms.
 5. Evoked OAEs are valuable as a cross-check for behav-
ioral thresholds in children. The pediatric population 
can be diffi cult to test behaviorally. When results are 
obtained, the reliability as judged by the examiner may 
not be suffi cient to proceed with treatment or discharge 
from follow-up. While immittance measures provide 
valuable information regarding middle-ear function, 
this alone is insuffi cient to characterize the hearing of 
the child. Evoked OAEs provide a valuable, objective 
measure of cochlear function that helps to support 
or refute behavioral responses. Auditory brainstem 
response (ABR) testing may be performed once a hear-
ing disorder is detected by from evoked OAE responses. 
Although the ABR or ASSR would provide frequency-

of toys. Older children perform behavioral testing 
tasks similar to those of adults. The behavioral 
 responses to pure tones become progressively more 
specifi c and reliable with patient age.
Speech audiometry varies as a function of age 
as well. In very young infants, behavioral responses 
to speech are noted. In older infants, speech aware-
ness thresholds are determined using the methods 
described above for pure tones. In toddlers and pre-
schoolers, speech recognition is often measured with 
closed-set identifi cation tasks, such as picture pointing 
or pointing to body parts. Younger children are often 
capable of demonstrating speech recognition through 
repetition of word lists that are designed for children, 
while older children are often tested using the same 
word lists as adult patients.
 4. The role of immittance audiometry changes based 
upon the suspected etiology of disorder for a patient. 
Individuals who are referred for otologic testing have 
varied etiologies for which immittance testing is 
primarily used. In the population of patients with oto-
logic disorder, some individuals are suspected to have 
middle-ear dysfunction. Others are expected to have 
cochlear or retrocochlear dysfunction. For those indi-
viduals with evidence of acute or chronic middle-ear 
dysfunction, tympanometry and acoustic refl exes are 
evaluated to determine whether a pattern of middle-
ear dysfunction exists. Flat tympanograms suggest 
a likelihood of fl uid in the middle-ear space, while 
signifi cant negative pressure suggests a likelihood 
of Eustachian tube dysfunction. A large measured 
volume suggests the likelihood of a perforation in the 
tympanic membrane, or perhaps indicates the patency 
of previously placed pressure equalization tubes in the 
tympanic membrane. A pattern of acoustic refl exes 
that are absent or elevated in the probe ear are also 
suggestive of middle-ear dysfunction.
Immittance testing can also be helpful in deter-
mination of cochlear versus retrocochlear pathology. 
A pattern of abnormal acoustic refl exes coupled with 
a normal tympanogram is suggestive of sensorineural 
hearing loss. A sensory, or cochlear, component to a 
hearing loss can be detected based on the SPAR test. 
A neural, or retrocochlear, hearing loss can be identi-
fi ed based on a pattern of elevated refl ex thresholds as 
well as abnormal acoustic refl ex decay.
 5. The role of auditory evoked potentials can be divided 
into measures of hearing sensitivity and measures of 
VIIIth cranial nerve and brainstem function. 
In the pediatric population especially, the auditory 
brainstem response test and its automated version 
are useful in screening the hearing of newborns. The 
ABR is also useful for obtaining ear-specifi c threshold 
information in infants and young children who are 
These goals relate to the impact of the impairment on 
the patient and how audiologic intervention may be 
used to facilitate more successful communication.
 2. The main goals for audiologic evaluation of adult 
patients are to assess degree and type of hearing loss 
and to assess the impact of the hearing loss on com-
municative function. These goals are similar for both 
younger and older adult populations. However, with 
older adults additional considerations must be made 
for the changes in function of the cochlea and central 
auditory nervous system that occur with aging.
Due to the decreased abilities of many older 
adults to hear rapid speech and speech in the presence 
of background competition, additional speech audi-
ometry measures are indicated. Assessment of speech 
recognition in background noise or competition, as 
well as dichotic speech-recognition measures are help-
ful to understand the prognosis for use of hearing aids 
in older adults, particularly regarding the decision to 
use unilateral or bilateral amplifi cation.
 3. The strategies used to evaluate pediatric patients of 
various ages differ according to the goals of evalua-
tion. For the infant population, the goals of testing are 
to identify children at risk for hearing loss and who 
need further evaluation. Screening measures, such as 
automated auditory brainstem response testing and 
otoacoustic emissions are helpful in accomplishing 
this goal because they can be easily administered to a 
great number of infants (for the purpose of universal 
screening of newborns) and provide objective mea-
sures of auditory function. Behavioral testing may be 
used for this population, but is less helpful in accom-
plishing these goals due to the intensity levels at which 
infants respond to sound.
For the evaluation of infants and young children, 
more comprehensive testing is indicated to determine 
the degree and type of hearing loss. Otoacoustic emis-
sions and auditory evoked potentials provide objective 
measures in this age group. Tympanometry provides 
valuable information about middle-ear function. The 
major differences in testing children of various ages 
relate to the behavioral expectations for children. In 
testing very young infants, behavioral observation 
audiometry is used to look for behavioral changes 
that occur in response to suprathreshold acoustic 
stimulation presented in soundfi eld. In older infants, 
visual reinforcement audiometry is used to determine 
responses to auditory stimulation in soundfi eld or 
 under earphones by conditioning a child’s responses to 
sound with visual stimuli. In toddlers and preschool-
ers, conditioned play audiometry allows for ear-specifi c 
threshold responses, as children are conditioned to 
respond to low levels of stimulation with some type of 
motor response that typically involves the manipulation

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. A parent who is learning about their child’s hearing 
loss is likely to be in some stage of grief regarding the 
hearing loss. While there is often some suspicion of 
hearing loss that caused the evaluation to occur, a 
parent may experience shock or denial upon hear-
ing that their child has a hearing loss. It is important 
to consider the emotional reaction of the parent to 
such news. Being informed of even a relatively mild 
hearing loss often causes great alarm and distress in 
a concerned parent. Often upon hearing such news, 
a parent’s attention will no longer be directed at the 
clinician, even if it appears to be. In such a case, deliv-
ering  excessive amounts of information is probably in-
advisable and may serve to confuse and further upset 
the parent. It is often more helpful initially to provide 
the  parent with a simple explanation of the hearing 
loss, and offer them the opportunity to express their 
feelings and to ask questions.
 2. Often a simple schematic of the parts of the ear is 
helpful in describing to the patient or parent where 
the hearing loss is occurring. Using the term “con-
ductive” provides the patient with the appropriate 
word to describe the hearing loss. To reinforce this 
terminology, it may be helpful to describe how there 
is a problem with conduction of sound through this 
space in a conductive hearing loss. If there is fl uid in 
the ear, the concept of a “blockage” of sound or try-
ing to hear “underwater” is often helpful in providing 
a very simple explanation of the hearing dysfunction 
to patients. The need for medical referral for possible 
treatment of the disorder should be discussed clearly 
and simply, so that the patient knows what will hap-
pen next in the treatment process.
 3. Often a simple schematic of the parts of the ear is 
helpful in describing to the patient or parent where 
the hearing loss is occurring. Using the term “sen-
sorineural” provides the patient with the appropriate 
word to describe the hearing loss. Some clinicians 
too young or unable to provide behavioral threshold 
responses. In the adult population, the most common 
use of the ABR is to assess VIIIth cranial nerve and 
brainstem function. It is often used as a screening tool, 
particularly for auditory nerve lesions.
 6. As was discussed in this chapter, the audiologist 
must determine the goals for an evaluation and the 
strategy to be used to accomplish the goal. The audi-
ologist has a number of assessment tools available for 
the purposes of evaluating auditory function. Some 
tools provide more valuable information regarding 
auditory function for a particular population than 
others. In addition, some tools provide more valuable 
information regarding particular disorders than others. 
The more an audiologist knows about a particular 
medical condition related to hearing loss, the more the 
audiologist can tailor the testing strategy to obtain the 
most valid and useful information. Furthermore, the 
audiologist’s knowledge of the structural and func-
tional changes of a disorder, as well as the medical 
treatment strategies for a disorder, allows the audiolo-
gist to interpret audiologic fi ndings appropriately.
For example, a patient who is undergoing certain 
forms of chemotherapy is more at risk for develop-
ing hearing loss due to ototoxicity. Knowledge of this 
would prompt the audiologist to use high-frequency 
pure-tone testing and distortion product otoacoustic 
emissions testing to monitor hearing function, rather 
than standard pure-tone audiometry alone, because 
the highest frequencies are affected fi rst.
As a second example, consider a pediatric patient 
with a syndrome that affects both hearing and cogni-
tive function. Knowledge of possible developmental 
delays may help the audiologist to be prepared to adapt 
the behavioral testing strategy to be most suitable to 
the cognitive age of the child.

 audiologists would refer for either otolaryngology or 
speech- language pathology services.
Cases in which referral should be made for 
otolaryngology consultation include ear pain and full-
ness; discharge or bleeding from the ear; sudden or 
progressive hearing loss, even with recovery; unequal 
hearing between ears or noise in the ear; hearing 
loss after an injury, loud sound, or air travel; slow or 
 abnormal speech development in children; and bal-
ance disturbance or dizziness. Following the audiologic 
evaluation, otolaryngology referral should be made if 
otoscopic examination of the ear canal and tympanic 
membrane reveals infl ammation or other signs of 
disease; immittance audiometry indicates middle-ear 
disorder; acoustic refl ex thresholds are abnormally 
 elevated; air- and bone-conduction audiometry re-
veals a signifi cant air-bone gap; speech-recognition 
scores are signifi cantly asymmetric or are poorer than 
would be expected from the degree of hearing loss or 
patient’s age; or other audiometric results consistent 
with retrocochlear disorder.
Cases in which referral should be made for speech-
language pathology consultation include: parental 
concern about speech and/or language  development; 
speech-language development that falls below expected 
milestones; or observation of defi ciencies in speech pro-
duction or expressive or receptive language ability.

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. Diagnostic audiology deals with the identifi cation 
and quantifi cation of hearing impairment. In this 
will describe the “hair cells lining the cochlea.” It 
is explained that when the hair cells are damaged, 
they are no longer able to sense the sound vibrations, 
and so the person experiences a loss of hearing abil-
ity. It is further  explained, assuming that there is no 
underlying medical condition, that this situation is 
typically permanent. The patient is counseled regard-
ing appropriate treatment options so that the patient 
knows what will happen next in the treatment 
process.
 4. Often, a report sent to an otolaryngologist would be 
in the format of an audiogram report rather than a 
letter report. The otolaryngologist is familiar with 
reading an audiogram and is expected to understand 
the implications of the audiologic testing done by the 
audiologist. The otolaryngologist’s primary concern 
will be the diagnosis and treatment of underlying 
medical pathology. Therefore, the report will primarily 
stress the presence of middle-ear disorder, the nature 
and degree of hearing loss, and any other relevant 
site-of-lesion fi ndings.
A report sent to a school administrator would, 
typically, be in the formant of a letter report. This may 
be accompanied by an audiogram if the document is 
meant to be a part of the student’s records. The school 
administrator is likely to be unfamiliar with the audio-
gram and will need clear and simple explanation of 
the fi ndings regarding the nature and degree of hear-
ing loss. In addition, interpretation of these fi ndings in 
regard to implications for speech and language devel-
opment is necessary. Of primary importance for such 
an audience will be the recommendations that are 
made for treatment and habilitation for the child. The 
use of medical jargon and nonrelevant information 
should be avoided. Clear, simple, and concise reporting 
should be emphasized.
 5. The obligation of the audiologist is to the source of 
the referral. Therefore, it is necessary to accurately 
determine who made the referral to the audiologist 
and for what purpose the referral was made. In cases 
where the patient was self-referred, the audiologist is 
responsible for both evaluation and management of 
the patient. In cases where the patient was referred 
by a physician, the audiologist is obligated to evaluate 
the patient and report back to the physician with the 
results. In this case, the audiologist is providing con-
sultation services rather than management services. 
However, in a case where the physician is referring to 
the audiologist for the purpose of providing hearing 
management, then the audiologist is responsible for 
management of the patient.
 6. Recommendation for referral out should be made 
back to the original referral source. Typically 

726  APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
communication needs. Impressions of the ears are 
then made to allow for custom fi tting of hearing aids 
or earmolds as needed. The devices and components 
are then ordered from the hearing-device manufac-
turer. Once the devices are delivered to the audiologist, 
they are programmed to fi t the patient’s hearing loss, 
and the patient is counseled in hearing aid use and 
care. Some type of evaluation of fi tting success is typi-
cally made upon dispensing of the hearing aids. This 
type of evaluation is generally continued at follow-up 
appointments, which allow adjustments to be made to 
the hearing devices or for problems to be addressed.
 4. The patient variable of age greatly impacts audiologic 
management because the inability of young children 
to describe their hearing experience makes the chal-
lenge of fi tting hearing devices more diffi cult. Exten-
sive habilitation measures are also typically employed 
in this population because these patients have yet to 
develop speech and language. In the elderly popula-
tion, physical and cognitive constraints may be im-
posed on the ability to effectively use hearing devices. 
In addition, auditory processing disorders may be 
manifest in older age, resulting in decreased benefi t 
from amplifi cation.
The nature of the patient’s hearing impairment 
will impact audiologic management. Patients with a 
profound hearing loss are more likely to benefi t from 
a cochlear implant than traditional hearing aid am-
plifi cation. Patients with more mild impairments will 
be more likely to benefi t from some hearing aid styles 
than others. Patients with auditory processing disor-
der may benefi t more from assistive listening devices 
than from conventional hearing aids.
The extent of communication requirements in 
the daily life of a patient is likely to have an impact 
on audiologic management. Patient who are in a 
 variety of challenging listening situations are likely to 
require a great deal of sophistication in their choice 
of hearing devices. Children in a classroom are likely 
to require FM systems to increase the signal-to-noise 
ratio suffi ciently to hear the teacher. Patients who lead 
a more solitary lifestyle will have different needs than 
either of these populations.
 5. Informal hearing needs assessments provide the 
 audiologist with the ability to explore a patient’s 
lifestyle and hearing requirements in depth. In addi-
tion, this type of assessment is completed in a more 
conversational, natural style, which may allow the 
patient to feel more comfortable in sharing their per-
sonal experiences. Furthermore, the communication 
exchange in which the needs assessment takes place 
provides the audiologist with the opportunity to ob-
serve the patient’s communication abilities. However, 
informal hearing needs assessment does not allow 
role, the audiologist diagnoses the presence of hear-
ing loss and provides information important to the 
medical diagnosis of hearing disorders.
Audiologic management deals with the commu-
nication disorder that results from a hearing loss. The 
goal of audiologic management is to limit this disorder 
as much as possible. To that end, the audiologist uti-
lizes technological devices to maximize residual hear-
ing and to rehabilitate or habilitate hearing function.
These areas overlap primarily in the realm of 
audiologic evaluation. During the audiologic evalu-
ation, the audiologist learns important informa-
tion both about the hearing impairment and about 
the patient’s motivation and need for audiologic 
management.
 2. A patient’s motivation for pursuing a hearing 
aid can come in many forms. Often, patients are 
 motivated to pursue hearing aids due to their own 
perceived hearing handicap. These patients are 
choosing to pursue hearing aids for the purpose 
of improving their own communication situation. 
While the patient may acknowledge the limitations 
of their hearing devices, their intrinsic motivation 
helps them to cope with these limitations and over-
come them where possible.
Unfortunately, many patients are driven to hear-
ing aid use by the external motivation of another indi-
vidual, such as a spouse or other family member. When 
this occurs, the patient is often found to be resentful or 
angry over being “forced” to do something that they 
did not wish to do. When such a patient is faced with 
limitations of their hearing devices, they may feel all 
the more dissatisfi ed with their hearing aids due to the 
fact that they did not want them.
Such a patient is typically considered to be a poor 
candidate for hearing aid use. While there is a pos-
sibility that the patient may try hearing aids and fi nd 
that they greatly benefi t from them, the more likely 
scenario is that an unmotivated patient would either 
return the hearing aids for credit and/or would be 
much less likely to attempt to use hearing devices in 
the future due to their initial negative experience.
 3. The fi rst step in a typical process for obtaining hearing 
aids is the audiologic assessment. This evaluation al-
lows for determination of hearing status and explora-
tion of patient motivation to use amplifi cation, as well 
as determining possible contraindications and making 
a prognosis for hearing device success. Following the 
audiologic assessment, a medical clearance is typically 
obtained from a physician. This clearance assures that 
hearing aid use is not medically contraindicated.
Once the patient has obtained a medical 
clearance, they are typically counseled regarding 
 appropriate hearing devices for their hearing loss and

does not improve communication in these cases)

and ear canal stenosis)

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. The major components of any hearing aid include 
the microphone or other audio input, the amplifi er, 
and the receiver. The microphone serves to transduce 
mechanical energy into electrical energy. A hearing 
aid may have one or more microphones. In addition, it 
may have some type of direct audio input or telecoil in-
put, which bypasses the microphone function, directly 
delivering an electric signal. The electrical signal is 
then increased by the amplifi er. The amplifi er requires 
a power source in the form of a battery. The electrical 
signal is then changed back into an acoustic signal by 
the receiver, which is also called the loudspeaker.
 2. Hearing aids initially used linear amplifi cation, such 
that soft, medium, and loud sounds were all amplifi ed 
measurement or quantifi cation of the patient’s benefi t 
or lack of benefi t from audiologic treatment. In addi-
tion, vital information may be missed when needs are 
discussed in an unstructured format. Furthermore, 
some patients may not have considered particular 
areas of concern in the past, and would be unlikely to 
mention some areas of hearing needs without being 
prompted by the information provided by a formal 
questionnaire.
Formalized hearing needs assessments come 
in many forms. Some formats such as the Client 
Oriented Scale of Improvement (COSI) provide the op-
portunity for open-ended responses to hearing needs 
assessment. Other formats such as the Abbreviated 
Profi le of Hearing Aid Benefi t (APHAB) or Hearing 
Handicap Inventory (HHI) provide for closed-choice 
responses to commonly experienced hearing needs. 
Each of these assessment types allows for quantifi ca-
tion and ease of documentation of hearing needs. 
Such measures provide an opportunity for demon-
stration of audiologic treatment benefi t to patients 
and for third-party reimbursement for services. These 
measures are also useful for research purposes to 
demonstrate treatment effi cacy.
 6. The goal of determining discomfort levels is to set 
the maximum output of a hearing aid at a level that 
permits the widest dynamic range of hearing possible 
without letting loud sounds be amplifi ed to uncom-
fortable levels.
Specifi cally, the patient should be instructed to 
respond when the level of the sound is uncomfortably 
loud. Pure-tone signals of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 
and 3000 Hz are then presented using an ascending 
approach in two or fi ve dB steps until the patient indi-
cates that the uncomfortable level was reached. This 
process is then replicated until the same level is indi-
cated on two out of three trials. This level is deemed to 
be the threshold of discomfort.
 7. Any of the following, or combination of the following, 
indicators may signal poor prognosis for hearing aid 
success:
•  Patient does not perceive a problem (denial; poor 
motivation)
•  Not enough hearing loss (minimum degree of hear-
ing loss must occur for benefi t to be expected)
•  Too much hearing loss (hearing aids can only pro-
vide so much gain; word recognition may be poor 
with too much gain)
•  A “diffi cult” hearing loss confi guration (amplifi ca-
tion works best for certain mid- to high-frequencies; 
hearing loss in only the low-frequencies seldom 
causes a communication defi cit and is more diffi cult 
to provide appropriate gain for)

728  APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
is introduced, as the output signal no longer resembles 
the input signal.
The method of compression limiting works by 
reducing the gain of the hearing aid at higher inten-
sity levels compared to lower intensity levels. Compres-
sion in a hearing aid is used to address the reduced 
dynamic range of individuals with hearing impair-
ment by making soft sounds louder, but not amplifying 
loud sounds as much. This is because loud sounds are 
still perceived as loud at high intensity levels in most 
individuals with impaired cochlear function. By reduc-
ing the amount of gain of the hearing aid as sounds 
become louder, the hearing aid allows soft sounds to 
be perceived as soft and loud sounds as loud but not 
excessive. When loud sounds are amplifi ed less than 
softer sounds, this effectively limits the output of the 
hearing aid, which results in a faithful representation 
of the input signal, and does not introduce distortion 
at high levels like the peak-clipping method.
 4. Acoustic feedback occurs when amplifi ed sound ema-
nating from a loudspeaker is directed back into mi-
crophone of the same amplifying system. This causes 
a “whistling” sound in a device the size of a hearing 
aid. It is a common phenomenon in hearing aids and 
is one of the main considerations in selecting an ap-
propriate hearing aid for a patient. This is because 
the most effective method of reducing the occurrence 
of feedback is to increase the distance between the 
microphone and sound output of the hearing aid. The 
increase of distance decreases the chance that ampli-
fi ed sound will reach the microphone. The distance 
between microphone and receiver is greatest in a 
style such as a behind-the-ear hearing aid, where the 
microphone is at the level of the top of the auricle and 
the sound emanates into the ear canal. The smaller 
the style of hearing aid, the closer the microphone is 
to the receiver increasing opportunities for feedback.
Another method of feedback prevention in 
modern hearing aids is the use of feedback reduction 
circuits. There are two sound processing feedback 
reduction methods. In one method, the frequency 
band causing feedback is recognized by the hearing 
aid processor, and the amplifi cation is reduced in this 
frequency band. In the second method, the frequency 
of the feedback is identifi ed by the hearing aid, and 
a method known as “phase cancellation” is used to 
reduce the sound.
 5. With analog processing, the signal is processed in a 
manner that is continuously varying over time. With 
digital processing, the acoustic signal is converted 
to a signal that is represented as discrete numeric 
values at discrete moments in time. With a digital 
signal processing strategy, the numeric signal can be 
mathematically manipulated to provide control over 
to the same extent. This type of amplifi cation required 
patients to often utilize a volume control to limit the 
intensity of sound output from the hearing aid. Fol-
lowing the advent of nonlinear amplifi cation, patients 
were able to have better sound quality, with hearing 
aid output more appropriately fi t to the patient’s dy-
namic range. In addition, less control of the hearing 
aid was required by the user.
Changes in methods of output limiting also oc-
curred with sound processing changes. Output limit-
ing was traditionally achieved by a method known 
as “peak clipping.” With this method, the peaks of 
signals were cut off at a certain predetermined level. 
This created distortion when the input to the hearing 
aid was above the saturation level. The compression 
method of output limiting that followed allowed for 
the signal to be compressed into the listeners dynamic 
range, reducing distortion of the signal at high input 
levels.
The next major trend in hearing aid technology 
was the miniaturization of hearing aids. Patients were 
more accepting of smaller and more cosmetically ap-
pealing hearing aids.
The use of multiple memories in hearing aids 
allowed for different response parameters for differ-
ent listening situations. Switching of responses was 
originally done manually but is now done adaptively. 
This means that the sound processing capability of the 
hearing aid allows it to recognize acoustic features of 
the environment and to automatically determine the 
appropriate sound processing response for a given lis-
tening situation. This is accomplished without patient 
control and provides for less effort on the part of the 
patient.
Digital processing has been a major innovation 
in hearing aid technology. Digital hearing aids have a 
greater range and number of controls than analog de-
vices. This allows for a more tailored, patient-specifi c 
response by the hearing aid.
Sophisticated directional microphones allow hear-
ing aids to focus in space by enhancing signals in front 
and reducing those coming from behind.
Open-fi tting solutions for hearing aids allow 
sound to be delivered through thin tubing directly to 
the ear canal or to a loudspeaker in the ear canal. This 
method of sound delivery greatly reduces the occlusion 
effect, resulting in overall greater patient satisfaction.
 3. The method of peak clipping for limiting the output of 
a hearing aid works by removing the extremes of alter-
nating current amplitude peaks at some predetermined 
level. The limitation of this method is that when the in-
put level of the hearing aid reaches this predetermined 
level (known as the saturation level), and the input 
signal no longer produces additional output, distortion 

APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  729
limiting the features available on the hearing aid 
when ordering the aid and/or disabling features dur-
ing software programming of the hearing aid is often 
useful for enabling better use of hearing aid for some 
patients.
 8. The implant itself is an electrode array that is inserted 
into the scala tympani of the cochlear via the round 
window. There is also a receiver/magnet that is surgi-
cally embedded into the temporal bone. The external 
components of the implant consist of a microphone, 
located at ear level, an amplifi er and speech processor, 
which can be body worn or ear level, and an external 
receiver that delivers the electrical signal to the trans-
mitter coil. The transmitter coil contains a magnet 
that is held in place on the skin opposite to the internal 
receiver magnet. A battery supply provides power to 
the amplifi er and speech processor.
The microphone of the implant picks up sound 
and converts it to an electrical signal. The electrical 
signal is increased by the amplifi er and processed by the 
digital signal processor. The processed sound is delivered 
to the internal electrode array, which electrically stimu-
lates the auditory nerve directly.
The specifi cs of candidacy for cochlear implants 
are continually evolving. Generally speaking, a patient 
with a hearing disorder severe enough to preclude suc-
cessful use of conventional hearing aids would be con-
sidered a candidate for a cochlear implant. There are 
Food and Drug Administration guidelines for cochlear 
implantation as well as guidelines provided by individ-
ual third party insurance companies. These guidelines 
are often used to determine whether reimbursement 
for cochlear implantation will occur. Guidelines for 
age of recipient, degree and type of hearing loss, and 
speech audiometric scores, as well as patient and fam-
ily motivation, and appropriate expectations for co-
chlear implantation are the major considerations.
The advantages that cochlear implants provide 
for appropriate candidates include: better high-
frequency hearing, enhanced dynamic range, better 
speech recognition, and no feedback problems.

a great number of amplifi cation parameters. This is in 
contrast to an analog signal, which requires specifi c 
analog controls to manipulate the signal. A signal can 
be more easily manipulated with digital processing, 
allowing for a greater range and number of controls 
than an analog processing scheme. This makes greater 
fl exibility and fi ne-tuning available to the audiologist 
for programming the hearing aid to fi t the individual’s 
hearing loss.
 6. Omnidirectional microphones are so named because 
they are sensitive to sounds from all directions.
Directional microphones are designed to “focus” 
on sound coming from the front of the hearing aid. 
This is accomplished by amplifying only the sounds 
in front of the hearing aid, and not amplifying, or 
not amplifying as much, sound coming from behind 
the person. Directionality is best with at least two 
microphones on a hearing aid to pick up sound. The 
relationship between sounds picked up by the two 
microphones allows the signal processing algorithm to 
amplify the signal coming from a particular direction.
Modern hearing aids typically come with di-
rectional microphones. The use of the directional 
microphone can be controlled manually through a 
push button on the hearing aid, or can be adaptively 
controlled by the hearing aid. In either case, the direc-
tional microphone is activated with the goal of helping 
the individual to hear better in noisy situations.
 7. Hardware controls that are available on most mod-
ern hearing aids include a volume control and/or a 
memory selection button. Some behind-the-ear hear-
ing aids may also have an on/off switch of some type, 
and some in-the-ear hearing aids may power off at the 
endpoint of the volume control potentiometer range. 
In addition, some hearing aids may be available with a 
remote control that provides access to these features.
The memory selection button is typically used 
to switch programs specifi c to particular listening 
situations, such as in noise or on the telephone. Some 
higher end hearing aids offer the option for a number 
of programs to be available for a given hearing aid. 
There is the potential for the hearing aid to simultane-
ously include a volume control option.
For certain populations, having access to a large 
number of controls over the hearing aid can create 
challenges. Patients who are not familiar with hearing 
aids and who may not yet be sophisticated listeners 
may have trouble understanding the use of programs. 
Misunderstandings or inability to use the features of 
the hearing aid are likely to lead to poorer ability to 
hear in certain situations because the wrong feature 
is being used. Therefore, when it can be seen that a 
patient is having diffi culty with certain features or it 
can be foreseen that a patient is likely to have  diffi culty, 

730  APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
time to acclimate to the sounds of the hearing aid. As 
the patient becomes more comfortable with the hear-
ing aid, the gain can be increased to provide greater 
output over time through software programming by 
the audiologist.
 2. The degree and confi guration of a hearing loss con-
tribute greatly to the style of hearing aid chosen for 
a patient. Certain styles of hearing aids are more ap-
propriate for certain degrees of hearing loss, primarily 
because with a greater degree of hearing loss, more 
gain is needed to compensate for the hearing loss. 
With increasing output from the hearing aid, there is 
more opportunity for feedback to occur. The primary 
method for reducing feedback is to increase the dis-
tance between the microphone and receiver of the aid. 
This imposes limitations on the appropriate style of 
hearing aid for a degree of loss.
The confi guration of the hearing loss contributes 
to style choice as well. Hearing losses that are primar-
ily high frequency in nature will require different op-
tions than a hearing loss that involves low-frequency 
components as well. This is because good hearing in 
the lower frequencies will be diminished by insertion 
of an aid into the ear.
Other factors that relate to style choice of the 
hearing aid include patient factors such as manual 
dexterity and vision. Small hearing aids require rea-
sonable visual acuity in order to clean, change batter-
ies, and manipulate. Behind-the-ear hearing aids tend 
to be more diffi cult to insert and remove for individuals 
with poor dexterity.
The communication needs of the individual are 
of great importance in determining the technologi-
cal features of a hearing aid. Patients who are in a 
great number of challenging listening environments 
will require a greater number of program options to 
provide for the best acoustic response in the various 
situations. Those who are primarily in a quiet listening 
environment may not be as concerned with having a 
great deal of fl exibility in programming options for the 
hearing aids.
Additional factors relating to both style and tech-
nology choices are decided according to the personal 
preferences and fi nancial constraints of the patient. 
Higher levels of technology typically cost more than 
lower levels. In addition, personal preference of a pa-
tient is often a strong motivator in selection of a hear-
ing aid. Patients who are adamant in their preference 
for a particular hearing aid style or technology level 
are likely to reject other options or be less satisfi ed with 
hearing aid use.

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. The fi rst step in the process of obtaining hearing aids 
is the selection of the appropriate hearing aids for 
a patient. There are numerous patient factors that 
contribute to determination of the appropriate hear-
ing devices. Once a decision is reached regarding style 
and technology of the hearing aid, ear impressions are 
taken if necessary, and the hearing aids and/or ear-
molds are ordered from the manufacturer.
The second step is quality control of the product. 
Electroacoustic analysis is performed on hearing aids 
received from a manufacturer to ensure that they are 
performing as specifi ed. A subjective listening check is 
done with the hearing aids, and the aids are inspected 
to ensure that they are in good condition and that the 
order for the hearing aid was appropriately fi lled.
The third step in the process involves program-
ming of the hearing aids. Some audiologists prefer to 
program the hearing aids prior to the dispensing ap-
pointment. Others will do the primary programming 
at the appointment. The gain of the hearing aids is 
programmed to match the prescriptive formula that 
is based on the patient’s hearing loss. Other options, 
such as volume controls, memory programs, and 
power options, are also programmed.
At the dispensing appointment and afterwards, 
verifi cation is made to ensure that the hearing aids 
are performing appropriately. There are several 
methods of verifi cation, including inspection of 
physical fi t, real-ear measurements, subjective 
assessments of quality and performance from the 
patient, functional gain measurements, and aided 
speech perception measures.
Once the hearing instruments are dispensed, 
the patient will return for a follow-up appointment 
for adjustments to the hearing aid. It is typical that 
the fi rst fi t of a hearing aid does not actually provide 
enough gain to meet the ultimate prescriptive formula 
requirements. This is because the patient requires 

APPENDIX C  ANSWERS TO SHORT ANSWER AND DISCUSSION QUESTIONS  731
Subjective assessment by the patient is also used 
to verify hearing aid output. The patient is probed 
regarding the quality and intelligibility of speech and 
other sounds.
More formal behavioral verifi cation is obtained 
through the use of functional gain measures, where 
frequency-specifi c signals are presented via loud-
speaker to the patient in both aided and unaided 
conditions. The difference between aided and unaided 
thresholds is the functional gain of the hearing aid.
Aided speech measures also provide verifi cation 
of the hearing aid performance. The patient is pre-
sented with speech materials, and performance scores 
are obtained. The goal is to ensure that the patient is 
hearing and understanding speech in a manner that 
meets expectations of performance. Performance is 
judged relative to the patient’s degree and confi gura-
tion of hearing loss.
 5. The main focus of a hearing aid delivery orientation is 
on informational counseling. Typically, the nature of 
hearing and hearing impairment is discussed, to pro-
vide context for the patient to understand the hearing 
loss. Next, the hearing aids are fi t, and components 
and function of the hearing aids are discussed and 
demonstrated. It is necessary to ensure that patients 
are able to insert and remove the hearing aids and that 
they can manipulate the controls on the hearing aids. 
Furthermore, it is necessary for patients to understand 
what the controls are used for and when and how to 
use them.
Next, care and maintenance of hearing aids is 
typically addressed. Patients are taught how to prop-
erly clean the hearing aids on a daily basis. Storage of 
the hearing aids is discussed, as is protecting the hear-
ing aids from moisture and pets. Patients are taught 
how to insert and remove batteries, and expectations 
for battery life are discussed.
Reasonable expectations for hearing aid use are 
reinforced. Typical experiences, such as telephone use 
and feedback are discussed. Listening strategies are 
 developed for those situations in which communica-
tion remains diffi cult, even with hearing aids. Discus-
sion is made of other assistive devices that may be 
needed by the patient, such as special smoke alarms 
and other alerting devices.
Troubleshooting of the hearing aids is delin-
eated, and warranty information is provided to the 
patient.
 6. Patients should expect that they will have acceptable 
hearing in most listening environments. There are cer-
tain environments where even individuals with normal 
hearing would be expected to have a great deal of dif-
fi culty. In these situations, hearing aids will not provide 
perfect hearing. Patients should expect communication 
the presence of excessive cerumen, evidence of infec-
tion or trauma, or foreign objects in the ear canal. If 
there is excessive cerumen in the ear canal, this should 
be removed prior to making the impression.
The next step in the process involves placement 
of a foam or cotton block into the ear canal. This pro-
vides protection against ear impression material from 
reaching the tympanic membrane. In addition, proper 
placement of the block provides a marker for depth of 
the impression.
Next, the ear canal is fi lled with impression 
material. This is typically a two-part material that is 
combined and fi lled into an impression syringe. The 
syringe is inserted into the ear canal and impression 
material is squeezed into the ear canal as the syringe 
tip is slowly retracted from the ear canal space. The 
impression  material is then left to set for several 
minutes.
Once the impression material has had time to 
set, the impression is removed from the ear canal, with 
much the same technique as would be used to remove 
a hearing aid from the ear. The impression is then in-
spected for quality. If there are voids or other problems 
with the impression, it will be remade.
Following removal of the impression from the 
ear, otoscopic examination is again made to determine 
that there is no residual impression or block material 
or trauma to the ear canal.
The impression is sent to the manufacturer to be 
used for making of a custom-made earmold or hearing 
aid case.
 4. First, the physical fi t of a hearing aid must be verifi ed. 
Inspection should be made to determine that the hear-
ing aid has a secure fi t and allows for ease of insertion 
and removal. The patient should be able to manipulate 
the hearing aid and its controls, and the aid should be 
physically comfortable in the ear. There should be an 
absence of feedback, and the occlusion effect should 
be suffi ciently tolerable to allow patient acceptance of 
the hearing aid.
Next, real-ear measurements can be made with 
a probe microphone to determine the electroacoustic 
characteristics of the hearing aid at or near the 
tympanic membrane.
Speech mapping by probe microphone with the 
hearing aids in both ears can be used to demonstrate 
that the amplifi ed signal delivered to the tympanic 
membrane meets the prescriptive target. Ongoing 
speech is presented via the probe-microphone system 
at fi xed intensity level. The output of the probe micro-
phone is displayed in response to the ongoing speech. 
With ongoing amplifi ed speech displayed, the hearing 
aid parameters can be adjusted until the speech map 
approximates prescriptive targets.

Answers to Discussion Questions
 1. Nonlinear loudness growth occurs as a result of 
cochlear dysfunction. The perception of loud sounds 
remains loud to the person with hearing loss. How-
ever, the perception of soft sounds is diminished, 
such that sounds go from being perceived as very soft 
to very loud over a small range of intensities. This 
creates problems for fi tting of hearing aids, because 
the primary function of a hearing aid is to increase 
signal gain.
Currently, technology uses nonlinear signal 
processing, which is meant to provide appropriate 
amplifi cation for nonlinear loudness growth. The 
compression circuit of the hearing aid allows differ-
ent intensities of sound to be amplifi ed differently. 
Soft sounds are amplifi ed a great deal, whereas loud 
sounds are amplifi ed only a little or not at all. This al-
lows sound intensities to be perceived as more normal 
by the listener, with soft sounds being perceived as soft 
and loud sounds as loud but not uncomfortable.
 2. Sometimes binaural amplifi cation can result in poorer 
word recognition and communication performance 
than monaural amplifi cation because the signal from 
one ear is so highly distorted that it actually interferes 
with speech recognition by both ears. In other cases, 
acoustic input from an ear that functions poorly on its 
own can actually provide additional needed input to 
improve speech-recognition performance in the better 
way. One way to assess which case is true for a patient 
is to test speech recognition performance in a binaural 
condition. Another way is by trial use of binaural am-
plifi cation in the real world to evaluate success.
 3. Probe-microphone measures are important in chil-
dren because they have smaller ear canals than adults. 
This results in greater sound pressure levels  being 
delivered to the ear canal than with adult hearing 
aid fi ttings. In addition, the ear canal resonance of a 
child’s ear differs from adults. This can cause unex-
pected peaks in the frequency gain response output of 
the hearing aid. Real-ear measures would refl ect the 
occurrence of both of these phenomena, because they 
demonstrate the sound at the level of the tympanic 
membrane, after it has been modulated acoustically by 
the physical characteristics of the ear canal.
Another reason that probe-microphone measures 
are so important in children is that children are unso-
phisticated listeners who typically lack the vocabulary 
and insight to describe the subjective experience of 
to improve, but not to be perfect. Patients should expect 
to obtain more benefi t from their hearing aids in quiet 
environments than in noise.
Patients will need to understand that back-
ground sounds will be amplifi ed. They should expect 
environmental sounds to not be uncomfortably loud. 
Although loud sounds should be perceived as loud, 
and environmental sounds may seem louder than 
normal when fi rst acclimating to the hearing aids, the 
sounds should not be uncomfortable.
Patients should expect amplifi cation to be free of 
feedback. Under some conditions, such as when any 
hard surface is placed next to the hearing aid in the 
ear, feedback from the hearing aid is expected to oc-
cur. However, while the hearing aid is in the ear under 
typical circumstances, feedback should not occur.
Patients should expect that all hearing aids are 
visible to some degree. Even when hearing aids are 
made to fi t deeply into the ear canal, the faceplate of 
the hearing aid and the removal cord are both visible 
to some extent.
Patients should expect that the hearing aids 
will be reasonably comfortable. They should not ex-
pect that they will not feel the hearing aid. Patients 
may need to be counseled that they will become ac-
climated to the feel of the hearing aids in their ears 
over time, just as they would become acclimated to 
wearing glasses.
The benefi ts of setting appropriate expectations 
for hearing aid use cannot be overstated. Prognosis 
for hearing aid use is good if the patient has reason-
able expectations.

there is no feedback from the BAHA aid, allowing for 
appropriate gain output. There is also excellent sound 
quality delivered to the cochlea.
 6. There are differences in candidacy criteria that are 
dependent on age. In general, candidacy for cochlear 
implantation is considered for individuals whose 
hearing loss is too severe to benefi t from conventional 
amplifi cation.
Candidacy for infants with hearing loss includes: 
profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, little or no 
benefi t from hearing aid amplifi cation, no medical con-
traindications, educational placement in a program 
that emphasizes audition, family support, and appro-
priate expectations for cochlear implant outcomes. 
Currently, children under the age of 12 months are 
rarely implanted. Current cochlear implant candidacy 
for children older than 2 years of age includes: severe 
to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, 
minimal benefi t from hearing aid amplifi cation, no 
medical contraindications, educational placement in 
a program that emphasizes audition, family support, 
and appropriate expectations for cochlear implant 
outcomes. Adult candidacy for cochlear implantation 
includes: severe to profound bilateral sensorineural 
hearing loss; limited benefi t from hearing aids, defi ned 
as scores of 50% or less on open-set sentence recogni-
tion measures on the ear to be implanted and 60% or 
less on the non-implanted ear; no medical contrain-
dications; and appropriate expectations for cochlear 
implant outcomes.
 listening with hearing aids. Any unusual or problem-
atic output from a hearing aid is likely to be unreported 
by a child. Real-ear measures allow the audiologist to 
be more confi dent that the output of the hearing aid is 
benefi cial and appropriate for the patient.
 4. The major goal in treating children with auditory pro-
cessing disorder is to forestall academic achievement 
problems by optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the 
classroom acoustic environment. Remote-microphone 
technology is commonly employed to amplify the 
teacher’s voice in a classroom so that the child has 
better access to instructions and information provided 
by the teacher. In addition, preferential seating in the 
classroom is often recommended so that the child 
can be in close proximity to the teacher, who is often 
speaking. Other strategies include auditory training 
therapy to help children maximize their access to de-
sired sounds.
 5. Some advantages of using binaural conventional 
hearing aids include a considerably lower cost than 
the bone-anchored hearing aid and not having to 
undergo the invasiveness of a surgical procedure, as 
would be needed with the BAHA. Because hearing aids 
are present in both ears, binaural amplifi cation with 
conventional hearing aids offers the opportunity for 
better directional hearing and the other advantages 
that come with binaural amplifi cation.
Advantages of the bone-anchored hearing aid 
relative to conventional hearing aids include ease 
and comfort of use for most individuals. In addition,
