A hypothesis and the experiments to test it propose that very
long-term memories, such as fear conditioning, are stored as the
pattern of holes in the perineuronal net (PNN), a specialized ECM
that envelops mature neurons and restricts synapse formation.
The 3D intertwining of PNN and synapses would be imaged by
serial-section EM. Lifetimes of PNN vs. intrasynaptic components
would be compared with pulse-chase 15N labeling in mice and 14C
content in human cadaver brains. Genetically encoded indicators
and antineoepitope antibodies should improve spatial and tempo-
ral resolution of the in vivo activity of proteases that locally erode
PNN. Further techniques suggested include genetic KOs, better
pharmacological inhibitors, and a genetically encoded snapshot
reporter, which will capture the pattern of activity throughout
a large ensemble of neurons at a time precisely deﬁned by the
triggering illumination, drive expression of effector genes to mark
those cells, and allow selective excitation, inhibition, or ablation to
test their functional importance. The snapshot reporter should en-
able more precise inhibition or potentiation of PNN erosion to
compare with behavioral consequences. Finally, biosynthesis of
PNN components and proteases would be imaged.

protein turnover
A
major problem in understanding memory is how it can be
very long-lasting and stable from early childhood until
death, despite massive interruptions in brain state as extreme as
prolonged comas. Current prominent candidates for molecular
substrates for long-term memory storage have focused on mac-
romolecules such as calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
(CaMKII) coupled with the NMDA receptor (1) and protein
phosphatase 2A (2), protein kinase M zeta (PKMζ) (3), and
cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB)
(4), all of which are inside postsynaptic spines. To retain in-
formation despite metabolic turnover, all such candidates need
to have some sort of bistable switch (e.g., state of phosphoryla-
tion or prion conformation) and a mechanism by which older
copies of the molecule pass on their status to newer copies to
preserve the information. A major problem is that individual in-
tracellular molecules typically last at most a few days before being
turned over. Therefore, the information would have to survive
being copied tens of thousands of times in a long-lived human,
despite metabolic interruptions. Such robust ﬁdelity would be ex-
tremely difﬁcult to engineer. Even dynamic computer memory with
sophisticated refresh and error correction circuits cannot cope with
even a momentary hiccup in its power supply. Instead, long-term
information storage in both computers and human civilizations
requires writing the information onto physically stable storage
media (e.g., magnetic disks, clay tablets, or acid-free paper), which
do not require frequent energy-dependent recopying. Aside from
some nuclear pore constituents, all of the known really long-lived
proteins are insoluble ECM components such as crystallin, elastin,
collagen, and proteoglycans (5), which gain stability by extensive
cross-linkage and remoteness from intracellular degradative ma-
chinery, such as proteasomes, lysosomes, and autophagy.
A proteoglycan-rich matrix called the perineuronal net (PNN)
has long been known to sheath mature CNS neurons (Figs. 1 and
2), with synapses forming through gaps in the PNN (6–12). The
PNN is initially laid down at the end of critical periods in wiring
of sensory inputs and may have contributions from both neurons
and glia (13). Experimental global disruption of the PNN can
reopen such critical periods, and therefore, the PNN is generally
considered to restrict synaptic plasticity (14, 15). The endogenous
enzymes that can digest the PNN, such as matrix metallopro-
teinases (MMPs; especially MMP-9), are known to be important
in some way for synaptic plasticity (7, 16, 17). Despite the mas-
sive literature on PNN and the enzymes that degrade it, no clear
mechanistic consensus has emerged to explain their important
roles in synaptic plasticity and memory. Much of the problem is
because the experiments showing effects on in vivo behavior rely
on disruptions of the PNN or its degradative enzymes with low
spatial and temporal resolution, leaving the possibility that these
molecules are merely permissive and not carriers of detailed in-
formation. Much higher-resolution experiments have been done
in synaptoneurosomes, slices, or cultures [for example, showing
that MMP-9 is locally translated (18) and rapidly secreted at
synapses in response to activity (19–21), that MMP inhibitors
prevent late-phase synaptic potentiation (16–20), and that local
pufﬁng of MMP-9 onto spines can provoke spine enlargement
and synaptic potentiation (19–22)], but such manipulations cannot
yet be linked to speciﬁc behaviors or memories. New techniques
will need to be developed to test the hypothesis that very long-
term memories are stored in the pattern and size of holes in the
PNN and that the holes are dynamically created or enlarged by
the above-listed enzymes. In this view, the PNN is like a punched
card, fantastically convoluted in 3D, in which the position and
size of holes preserve the long-term location and strength of syn-
apses (Fig. S1 and Movie S1).
The molecular and cellular bases for very long-term synaptic
plasticity and memory are among the most central and contro-
versial questions in neuroscience. Also, PNNs and MMPs have
been heavily implicated in many neuropathologies ranging from
traumatic injury, miswiring during critical periods, and epi-
leptogenesis, addiction-related plasticity to Alzheimer’s disease
(6, 7, 9, 11). Fear conditioning is an important animal model for
anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder in humans (23, 24).
The comparative roles of the PNN between species (e.g., Dro-
sophila and Caenorhabditis elegans) have been neglected. As
noted above, reviews on the PNN propose permissive, supportive
roles, such as inhibiting neurite outgrowth, forming a physical
barrier to new contacts, serving as a scaffold for other inhibitory
molecules, binding integrins, limiting AMPA receptor mobility,
reducing oxidative stress, and buffering ions (6, 8, 10, 11). Such

roles are somewhat analogous to the importance of insulation on
the wiring inside a computer: essential for function but not where
bytes are dynamically stored. The closest previous statement to
the current hypothesis was as follows: “[t]he extracellular matrix
at synapses in the brain may have a similar function [as at the
neuromuscular junction] and could well maintain overall con-
nectivity despite the comings and goings of molecules inside
neurons” (25). This statement from a chapter by Sejnowski (25)
in a book entitled What We Believe but Cannot Prove was highly
insightful but gave no mechanistic detail on how the ECM might
store the information. The only experimental test proposed was
that disruption of the ECM would interfere with memory, for
which there is (and already was) much evidence (6, 12, 14–16),
but the evidence is not incisive enough to be convincing. Mean-
while, reviews on MMPs in synaptic plasticity and learning
conclude that the key substrates and downstream mechanisms
remain unclear (7, 16, 26). In this article, I propose experiments
to test this hypothesis and try to detail how they will improve on
those hypotheses in the literature. A metaphor for PNN stably
localizing a synapse is in Fig. S1.
Determine the 3D Relationship Between PNN and Synapses
by Serial Block Face Scanning EM
Important assumptions of my hypothesis are that the PNN forms
a continuous barrier that encases relevant neurons during the
critical period closure of each part of the brain and that the PNN
permits synaptic connections between neurons through holes
sized to ﬁt the requirements of each synapse. Although published
literature includes much optical imaging of the PNN, there are
very few high-quality thin-section EM images (27) and no 3D
reconstructions revealing the ultrastructure of the PNN from
dendritic tips through the soma to the axonal end. I propose
high-resolution EM reconstruction for 3D visualization using
serial block face scanning EM (SBFSEM) (28) with several
options of highlighting the PNN. The PNN has been labeled with
biotinylated Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA) and Wisteria ﬂori-
bunda agglutinin (WFA) (29–31) (Fig. 1). I propose to label the
PNN in ﬁxed brain slices with eosin-conjugated VVA and WFA,
illuminate the eosin tags to photooxidize diaminobenzidine, and
locally generate osmiophilic precipitates for SBFSEM (32). Be-
cause the PNN is extracellular, membrane permeabilization with
detergents will not be required, and therefore, ultrastructure will
be well-preserved. An alternative approach would be to create
viral vectors encoding PNN proteins genetically fused to mini
singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) (33) or enhanced ascorbate
peroxidase (APEX) (34) ﬂanked with loxP sites. These viral
vectors would then be injected before or during PNN deposition
(35) into transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase in the
amygdala (available from Jackson Laboratory), and therefore,
miniSOG or APEX fusions would be incorporated into the de-
veloping PNN. Diaminobenzidine precipitates for SBFSEM
would be generated in ﬁxed sections by photooxidation or per-
oxidase reaction, respectively. The genetic tagging approach is
more laborious than lectin staining of endogenous PNN, but it
offers selectivity for speciﬁc protein components (whereas the
lectins highlight the carbohydrate side chains), avoids concerns
about diffusibility of lectins into ﬁxed sections, and should also
reveal nascent PNN proteins transiting through the secretory
pathway in different cells (36).

the PNN and Find the Longest-Lived Proteins. A key postulate of
my hypothesis is that the PNN contains molecules that do not
turn over after their initial deposition. The lifetime of PNN
components relative to intrasynaptic proteins seems never to
have been measured experimentally, although a long lifetime for

the PNN is plausible by analogy to other long-lived ECMs (5,
25). Tritiated threonine was reported to turn over with biphasic
half-lives of 13 and 38 d in total brain glycoproteins in adult rat
brain, but no radioactivity incorporated into the proteins at-
tached to chondroitin sulfate and heparin sulfate (37), implying
very little turnover of those components of the PNN. I suggest an
approach based on stable isotope labeling of amino acids in
mammals followed by mass spectroscopic multidimensional
protein identiﬁcation technology (MudPIT). These methods have
been used to show which synaptic proteins change signiﬁcantly in
abundance after deprivation of sensory input to the barrel cortex
in mice (38) and that some nuclear pore proteins are unexpectedly
very long-lived (39). Just as in these studies, mothers and pups are
fed 15N chow until the young mice are >95% 15N. At postnatal day
45, long enough for full maturation of the PNN in the amygdala
(35), animals are killed, and PNNs and synaptosomes are isolated
by established procedures (38, 40) from different portions of the
brain for MudPIT. This sample serves as t = 0 reference for
maximal 15N labeling. The remaining animals would be switched
to 14N chow, killed 2 d or 1, 4, 18, or 78 wk later, and similarly
processed. The ﬁnal time point may have to be brought forward
if the mice did not look like they would survive the full span. I
expect the 14N/15N ratios to give turnover rates for tens of distinct,
fully identiﬁed proteins in the PNN and hundreds in synapses as
represented by synaptosomes. This information should be of tre-
mendous long-term value, even if my hypothesis is incorrect or
oversimpliﬁed. Pilot experiments verifying sample preparations
and MudPIT could be done on control 14N animals. For example,
the PNN samples will need enzymatic deglycosylation before
MudPIT. Synaptosomes may need exposure to chondroitinase
to remove residual PNN. Also note that, unlike the PNN itself,
the PNN-degrading enzymes are likely to be rapidly turning over,
which was hinted by their acute up-regulation and local translation
minutes after synaptic activation (18, 19, 21).
Measurement of Turnover of PNN Vs. Synaptosomal Proteins in
Humans Using 14C Dating. All humans born between 1955 and
1963 were subjected to a pulse of 14C from atmospheric testing of
nuclear weapons, and therefore, tissue samples containing >5 μg
carbon can be analyzed for their date of biosynthesis with an
accuracy of about ±2 y. This established technique (41–43) has
given many important results, such as the fact that practically all
of the DNA in the cerebral cortex is almost as old as the in-
dividual; therefore, postnatal cell division is quantitatively neg-
ligible. However, such dating has never been applied to PNN
or synaptic proteins. I propose using the accelerator MS and dat-
ing of PNN and synaptosomal samples prepared from various
regions of postmortem human brain, including amygdala. The
advantages of these experiments are the multidecade time span
retrospectively accessible and the direct relevance to human
memory; the disadvantage is that I do not expect to resolve in-
dividual molecular species or lifetimes of less than several years.
Again, pilot experiments will be needed to assess and minimize
the extent of cross-contamination between PNN and synapto-
somes, the amount of new carbon introduced by the isolation
procedure, and the amount of input tissue required to yield the
minimum of 5 μg carbon. If, for some reason, the 14C experi-
ments prove unfeasible, measurement of aspartate racemization
provides another established form of birth-dating (5, 44).
Image Protease Activation with Genetically Encoded
Indicators After a Long-Term Potentiation or Learning
Paradigm
An ideal test of the hypothesis would be to (i) continuously
monitor protease activity with (ii) high time and space resolution
throughout much of the relevant area of brain (e.g., amygdala)
(iii) in the intact animal during an appropriate learning paradigm
(e.g., fear conditioning). Although this triple crown is not yet
feasible, genetically encoded indicators of protease activity should
allow all possible pairs of criteria to be satisﬁed. Monitoring of
MMP-2/-9 activity would require updating a reported FRET in-
dicator (45) for MMP-14 by installing a better MMP-2/-9 sub-
strate, probably the amino acid sequence PLGLAG, and replacing
the cyan ﬂuorescent proteins and YFPs with the best new green
donor/red acceptor pair (46). To achieve i and ii, acute slices
would be prepared and stimulated electrically or optogenetically
while imaging the green/red FRET indicator with confocal or two-
photon microscopy.
The most elegant variation would be to use a snapshot re-
porter (see below) to drive expression of a channel rhodopsin in
vivo, and therefore, optical stimulation in the slice should re-
capitulate the population of neurons that had been active during
a learning paradigm. To achieve i and iii, the ﬂuorescence would
be continuously monitored through a ﬁber optic probe or stick
objective implanted in the amygdala during or just after a train-
ing paradigm, such as fear conditioning. To achieve ii and iii, the
animal would be killed at a chosen time point during or just after
training. Acute slices would be prepared from the amygdala and
imaged with confocal or two-photon microscopy in the hope of
ﬁnding synaptic punctae with a high green/red ratio indicating
protease-induced cleavage and loss of FRET. One could also
explore whether the degree of indicator cleavage in vivo can be
preserved during tissue ﬁxation to allow high-resolution ratio
imaging in thin sections. Intact (high FRET) and cleaved (zero
FRET) indicator molecules should retain those properties
during ﬁxation.
Detect Newly Cut Holes in the PNN with Antibodies Against
Neoepitopes
I think that there may be a way to image protease activation and
fresh erosion of the PNN at a given time point without having to
incorporate a genetically encoded protease reporter. Endopro-
tease attack creates two fragments with a new amino terminus
and a new carboxyl terminus, which constitute neoepitopes
against which speciﬁc antibodies can be raised (47). Such anti-
bodies do not recognize the uncut sequence in the intact protein.
Crucially, the two fragments have different retention times (Fig.
S2): the left one containing the aggregating G1 domain is well-
retained within the matrix, whereas the right one containing
nonaggregating G3 diffuses away more readily (47). I predict
that the ratio of labeling by the two antineoepitope Abs should
provide a rough indication of how long ago the proteolysis took
place. Old erosions should stain for only the longer-retained
neoepitope, whereas fresh cuts should stain for both neo-
epitopes. The relationship between age and neoepitope ratio
could be calibrated by standards in which widespread proteolysis
was induced at known times (e.g., by injection of active enzyme
or kainate) (21).
Test MMP-2/-9 Double KO Mice for Behavioral Deﬁcits
Although mice genetically deleted in MMP-2, MMP-9, or both
have long been available, surprisingly little behavioral testing has
been done on them. MMP-9 KO animals showed deﬁcits in
hippocampal late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP) and con-
text-dependent fear conditioning (believed to require both hip-
pocampus and amygdala) but not tone-cued fear conditioning
(believed to require amygdala but not hippocampus) (20). At
face value, this result would argue that MMP-9 is needed for
hippocampal but not amygdalar plasticity. However, my own
experience with these animals in cancer research is that MMP-2
and -9 have very similar substrate preferences and tend to
compensate for each other after one is deleted; therefore, de-
letion of both is often necessary to get the full phenotype (48,
49). Therefore, I propose repeating the behavioral and associ-
ated electrophysiological tests similar to the tests by Nagy et al.

(20), especially tone-cued fear conditioning, with MMP-2/-9 dou-
ble KO animals.
Deliver Shorter Pulse of More Speciﬁc Protease Inhibitor
and Interfere with Induction in Vivo
Several groups (reviewed in ref. 16) have shown that broad-
spectrum MMP inhibitors can prevent late-phase LTP in various
brain regions. Intracerebroventricular injection of such an in-
hibitor has been reported to attenuate water maze learning for
many days after injection (50). To make this experiment more
incisive and relevant to fear conditioning, I would replace the
broad-spectrum inhibitor with a newer inhibitor, SB-3CT, which
is commercially available and much more speciﬁc for MMP-2
and -9. Remarkably, after a single i.p. injection, SB-3CT rapidly
crosses the blood–brain barrier and then washes out in just a few
minutes (51). This convenient route of administration and rapid
pharmacokinetics should permit more precise delineation of the
interval, during which time MMP-2/-9 activity is required during
acquisition of fear memories. Such time resolution should enable
suppression of one learned association without interfering with
previous or subsequent conditioning to different cues or con-
texts. Such evidence would strengthen the case that protease
activity is instructive and encodes speciﬁc information and that it
is not just globally permissive.
Apply Snapshot Reporter to Mark Cells Activated During
Amygdalar Fear Conditioning for High-Resolution Imaging,
Optogenetic Manipulation, or Overexpression of Proteases
or Protease Inhibitors
Here, I introduce the concept of snapshot reporters and focus on
methods for the snapshot memorization of Ca2+ in activated
neurons with the retrospective ability to detect Ca2+ changes
with high spatiotemporal resolution. Snapshot reporters would
be useful in neurobiology even independent of any perineuronal
net hypothesis. Among the many obstacles to brain activity
mapping are the enormous technical difﬁculty of simultaneously
recording from thousands to millions of identiﬁed neurons at
high speed in 3D in an intact, preferably behaving organism and
the problem of identifying the neurons with ﬁring that is actually
important for the behavior. Recording activity can, at best, give
correlations; targeted stimulation, inhibition, and ablation are
necessary to establish causality. An imperfect partial solution to
these problems is the use of promoters for immediate early
genes, such as c-fos, Arc, and zif268 (52). Immunostaining for
the expression of such genes can retrospectively highlight acti-
vated neurons throughout large sections of intact brain without
requiring tissue transparency or sophisticated instrumentation.
Effector proteins driven by these promoters can identify the
activated neurons for subsequent electrophysiology, optically or
pharmacologically stimulate or inhibit their ﬁring, or ablate
them. Unfortunately, the relationship between neuronal activity
and induction of these immediate early genes is poorly deﬁned,
and therefore, the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and temporal resolution
of the response are often less than ideal. This powerful concept
could be greatly improved by engineering a snapshot reporter
system (a super-fos, so to speak) to drive expression of arbitrary
reporter and effector proteins in response to deﬁned elevations
of [Ca2+] precisely coinciding with an external trigger, such as
light. The light would only need to propagate diffusely through-
out the brain region of interest without requiring image-quality
resolution.
My approach to a snapshot reporter system should be con-
structed by tandemly fusing a DNA binding domain, a Ca2+-trig-
gered heterodimerization module, a light-triggered heterodimeri-
zation module, and a transcriptional activation domain (Fig. 3).
When (and only when) high [Ca
2+] and light are simultaneously
present, the three chimeric proteins will join together into a three-
hybrid unit to activate transcription of any reporter or effector
gene appropriately placed downstream of the site on DNA for the
DNA binding protein. The DNA binding and transcriptional
activation domains need to be potent but with low background
in mammalian cells, and therefore, the commonly used Gal4-
VP16 pair should be suitable (53–55). The Ca2+-triggered het-
erodimerization module will be one of the mutant calmodulin-
M13 pairs that we previously engineered not to cross-react with
endogenous calmodulin and that offer a range of [Ca2+] afﬁni-
ties (56). Such bioorthogonality will be essential here, because
the calmodulin and M13 are not prefused with each other;
therefore, the exogenous calmodulin fused to the DNA binding
domain will not have any intramolecular advantage over endog-
enous free calmodulin.
Two light-triggered heterodimerization systems have been
published (55–57). Robust light activation of the ﬂavin-based
cryptochrome 2/CRY2-binding domain (CRY2/CIBN) (55) and
the phycocyanobilin-based phytochrome B/phytochrome inter-
acting factor 6 (PIF6) system (57) has been reported, and both
assayed by the ability of light to recruit a fused ﬂuorescent
protein to the membrane. Although the blue light CRY2/CIBN
heterodimerization system will certainly sufﬁce for a proof of
principle and many biological applications, a phytochrome-based
system may be ultimately preferable, because it should be acti-
vated by better-penetrating red light (650 nm) and inhibited by
near-IR (750 nm). The availability of a turn-off wavelength could
be useful to sharpen speciﬁcity and spatiotemporal resolution.
Ideally, one could further engineer and improve the phyto-
chrome B/PIF6 system to alter the chromophore of phytochrome
B from exogenous phycocyanobilin to endogenous biliverdin and
make the light-triggered binding of the two partners more robust.
The large size of phytochrome B (908 aa encoded by 2,724 nt) is
also incompatible with many viral vectors, probably requiring the
trimming away of all nonessential domains. Mutations would be
generated by structure-based intuition, DNA shufﬂing (58, 59),
and random mutagenesis (PCR-based or somatic hypermutation)
(60). High-throughput screening of phenotypes would be per-
formed in mammalian cells in a simpliﬁed version of the snap-
shot reporter, in which the DNA binding domain will be directly
fused to the phyB mutants so that transcription is dependent only
on light-dependent heterodimerization independent of Ca2+.
The reporter gene would be β-lactamase (bla), because it is ideal

neuronal activity. Many different permutations of the three fusions are
possible, provided that no single fusion contains (Gal4 + VP16), (CaM +
M13), or (PhyB + PIF6). PhyB, PIF6, and red light may be replaced by CRY2,
CIBN, and blue light, respectively. Nuclear localization signals may have to
be provided. For simplicity, binding of the Gal4 chimera to its cognate DNA

for both positive and negative selection by FACS (61–64). One
would stain and sort for bla expression [blue ﬂuorescence with
coumarin-cephalosporin-ﬂuorescein 2/acetoxymethyl ester (CCF2/
AM) live-cell substrate] 1 h or so after exposure to red light and no
bla expression (green ﬂuorescence with CCF2/AM) after near-IR
or no light.
An interesting variation on the above scheme would be to
replace the DNA binding and transcriptional activation domains
by complementary fragments of Cre recombinase (55, 65); there-
fore, coincidence of high [Ca2+] and light would reconstitute func-
tional Cre and trigger excision of loxP-stop-loxP cassettes. The
irreversibility of both of these steps would probably increase
sensitivity at the potential cost of higher background and poorer
temporal speciﬁcity. Also, a snapshot reporter based on Cre could
not be targeted to speciﬁc cell types using Cre driver lines.
Fear conditioning in the amygdala is a particularly appropriate
application for a snapshot reporter because of the advanced
results already obtained with c-fos–driven expression of drug- or
light-controlled channels (52). For example, the higher temporal
resolution of a snapshot reporter should enable more precise
delineation of which subsets of neurons are activated at what time
by different contexts or cues, because the triggering light would be
timed to coincide with (or follow with deﬁned latency) one
stimulus or a train of repetitions to achieve in situ response av-
eraging. The reporter would be a ﬂuorescent protein for post-
mortem optical reconstruction or a singlet oxygen generator for
electron microscopic ultrastructure (33). Optogenetic or drug-
controlled excitatory channels, hyperpolarizing pumps, opto-
genetic inhibition of synaptic release (66), or cell ablation with
toxins or singlet oxygen generators (67) would test the sufﬁciency
and necessity of the activated cells for the induction and expres-
sion of behavioral plasticity. The speciﬁc hypothesis that fear
memories can be encoded in the pattern of holes in the peri-
neuronal net could be tested by using the snapshot reporter to
enhance expression of secreted proteases, such as MMP-9,
aggrecanase, hyaluronidase, or chondroitinase. Whereas delo-
calized application of chondroitinase seems to render fear
memories labile (35), judicious overexpression of hole-cutting
proteases in just those neurons activated by a speciﬁc conditioning
paradigm should speciﬁcally strengthen that association. A com-
plementary experiment would be to express protease inhibitors
such as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) (68),
which should block formation of memories of just those cue-shock
associations with which the triggering light was paired. Finally, the
snapshot reporter might be able to drive renewed expression of
PNN components and thus, speciﬁcally weaken preestablished
memories that were being refreshed (hence evoking neuronal
activity and high [Ca2+]) in coincidence with the triggering light.
Use Time-Speciﬁc Tag for the Age Measurement of Proteins
to Monitor de Novo Synthesis of Proteases and PNN
Components
New protein synthesis, especially local synthesis at synapses (69,
70), is widely acknowledged to be crucial for plasticity. We recently
introduced a time-speciﬁc tag for the age measurement of proteins
(TimeSTAMP) tag, which allows drug-controlled labeling of newly
synthesized copies of speciﬁc proteins (71). This tag was re-
cently improved to incorporate a split YFP and the miniSOG
tag for correlated light and EM, allowing live ﬂuorescence and
EM readouts (72). No other method currently offers such high
spatiotemporal resolution and speciﬁcity for genetically desig-
nated proteins. Evidence has been presented that MMP-9 is
locally translated in synaptoneurosomes (18) and up-regulated by
gross pharmacological glutamatergic stimulation (18, 21). Such
observations would be greatly improved by using TimeSTAMP
(72) to image nascent MMP-9 with higher spatiotemporal reso-
lution (72) in acute slices or intact brain as a function of
electrical stimulation or behavioral conditioning, respectively.
Such experiments would provide an alternative to map sites of
PNN erosion. It would also be interesting to fuse TimeSTAMP to
PNN constituents to see if and where the proteins are resynthe-
sized after dissolution of carbohydrate side chains by injected
chondroitinase or when extinction training is performed during the
reconsolidation window (23). The latter procedure seems to erase
fear in adults, whereas ordinary extinction overlays a new in-
hibitory memory (23).
Conclusions
I have overemphasized techniques that my laboratory has been
involved with because of personal familiarity and a wish to high-
light their usefulness to a wider community. Actual techniques
and experiments will be chosen by the scientists involved. The
experiments may be based on partially or entirely wrong premises,
in which case they will be forgotten. However, the importance of
long-term memory is comparable with the signiﬁcance of DNA.
From 1943 to 1953, Avery et al. (73) and Watson and Crick (74)
showed the importance of DNA in carrying genetic information
from generation to generation through the double helix. How-
ever, the genetic code was still unknown. Watson and Crick (74)
only brought brilliant insight without new experimental data.
Franklin and Gosling (75) had the key X-ray diffraction pattern.
The present paper has no fresh experimental results but many
predictions. Perhaps in a few years, at least one prophecy can
be vindicated.
