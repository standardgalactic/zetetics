Dedication 
 
This thesis is dedicated to my Mum - Josephine Mary Theresa Hanney, née O’Connell, 
(1927 – 2008).  Mum taught me to read, and gifted me a love of books and curiosity 
about the social world.  I have no doubt at all that Mum, from afar, continues to keep 
an eye on all my endeavours, not least this one. Thanks Mum x.

Cartographies of Practices in Research with Children. 
 
Abstract 
 
This thesis unpicks the complexities, and rhizomatic nature, of the underpinning 
concepts of the trend towards Children-as-Researcher projects. The approach adopts 
a post-qualitative position, which evolved and emerged from the initial research design 
and pilot studies, and is presented in the thesis demonstrating the autoethnographic 
nature of the research experience. Adopting the style of a travelogue, the writing of 
the thesis is in itself a methodological tool that enabled/enables an exploration of the 
spaces between children, teachers and research to be encountered. Being in dialogue 
with Deleuze and Guatarri (1980) ‘lines of flight’, Barad (2007) ‘entanglement’, along 
with St Pierre (2014) ‘becoming’ and Lather (2006) ‘to produce knowledge differently’ 
provides not so much an analytical framework to give structure, rigidity, and a 
systematic interpretation of data, but rather permission and confidence to explore 
uncharted territories, to peek behind the curtain and reveal the spaces there. In doing 
so I consider the ‘present absence’ within ‘empty data-sets’,  the significance of 
‘silence’ in voice, and take a risk in adopting a playful approach through which to do 
so. My playful approach, whilst not quite the same as Watson (2015), who advocated 
the use of humour as an integral part of research in the social sciences, both as a tool 
for analysis and presentation, is simply put – fun. As such it is a different way to think 
about research, not to be too serious but to be enjoyed by both the researcher and the 
reader. This different way of thinking about research is evident throughout the thesis 
and can be seen visually through changes in font and print as well as through language 
and images, notably in the cartographic representation of my research experience. In

many ways the changes in direction, reflecting the journey metaphor, can be seen in 
this abstract which does not completely follow the conventional summary of the 
research to include findings and outcomes. There are no spoilers here, except to say 
that the takeaways, the new knowledge, can best be summarised as presenting new 
spaces to be considered as a result of a blurring of methodologies in a non-
conventional manner, in order to provoke and stimulate the educational research 
community that remains curious about Children-as-Researchers.

Acknowledgments 
 
Firstly I’d like to acknowledge the support, encouragement and unwavering interest 
from my supervisors, Mandy French and Martin Fautley, who never made me feel I 
was barking up the wrong tree and gave me the confidence to try something a little 
different. Their patience and nurturing approaches made all the difference on those 
long days of self-doubt. 
 
And then to David Foster, who gave me so much time and who, with humour and 
creativity, was able to interpret my doctoral storytelling to playfully capture my journey 
of discovery and re-present this in the map.  
 
Finally, and most importantly with love and thanks, to my family who have had my 
back from the beginning, providing copious moral support, and tea and coffee.  
Graham - for sharing the ups and downs and providing words of wisdom, and even 
more so for giving me the space to do this.  
Nat and Ben - who have looked on from the side-lines as they continued their own 
academic journey, yet still found time to be interested in mine.  
Dad - who knew when to ask how things were going and also knew when to avoid the 
subject completely - I’m sorry it took so long.

 The Epi-Pro-logue 
 
 
In which the journey, or at least this stage, begins and the reader is teased by the initial ideas to be 
unpicked, and then rewoven together, as the pace quickens. A risk assessment is offered to prepare for 
the bumpy road ahead.

1.1 Getting Started  
 
‘This tale grew in the telling of it’, the opening lines of the foreword of one of the 
greatest epic tales of travel, journey and discovery, JRR Tolkien’s ‘The Lord of the 
Rings’ (1954), perhaps encapsulates the essence of this thesis. Through the writing, 
and the reading, of this thesis the research has become dependent on what came 
before, alongside, and will inevitably come after. The length, and indeed structure, of 
the story told within this thesis has grown and evolved as part of the telling of that 
story. In much the same way as Tolkien, and other writers of epic journeys that travel 
through unchartered territories, (for example Douglas Adams in his five part trilogy 
‘The Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy’), have found, from one apparently simple 
starting point a range of other ‘glimpses’ become not only interesting to explore but 
ultimately essential (Tolkien 1954: Foreword). In ignoring the ‘glimpses’ the holistic 
nature of my doctoral journey cannot be communicated nor understood. Like Frodo 
and the rest of the Company of the Ring, the journey I have undertaken throughout 
this doctoral experience is a journey of discovery at many levels, not least one of self-
discovery. At times my journey has been risky, with false starts, dead ends and 
challenges to overcome. This has included getting lost…. and then found, as will be 
explained in my second chapter ‘The Weary Traveller’.   
 
I have endeavoured to approach the writing of this thesis with a degree of playfulness 
and creativity both to self-motivate and to engage the reader.  Like Tolkien I have 
drawn on imagery and a map to illustrate this doctoral journey, and would ask that this 

 
15 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
is viewed in conjunction with the thesis. Recognising that there is an overlap between 
beginning and end, like Frodo my starting point is also my ending point (for the time 
being), so whilst I draw attention to the map at this beginning point, I discuss it in more 
depth at the end. Again, whilst not likening my writing skills to Tolkien’s, I do draw 
some comfort in that in the same way he took a very long period of time to complete 
The Lord of the Rings due to the demands of his academic role, in particular examining 
and assessment (Carpenter 2016), I too have taken a long time to compete this thesis. 
 
Very quickly the reader will notice the use I make of metaphors throughout the thesis, 
adopting the idea of Journey. This use of metaphor not only responds to my creative 
and playful approaches but is underpinned by Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) 
Conceptual Metaphor Theory which suggests that the metaphor is not simply a poetic 
device but that cognition, and the ability to make sense of the world, relies on 
metaphor, which is then revealed in language. Consequently metaphors are the way 
in which the world is understood, not just described. In this thesis, by adopting the 
metaphor of the Journey I present the thinking and interaction between the events and 
experiences of my doctoral study. The messiness of the study and the interactions 
between the context, the researcher and the research participants, is understood in 
relation to Deleuze and Guattari’s (1980) rhizomatic view of the world in which there 
are multiple beginnings, and ends (and indeed middles).  
 

 
16 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
This philosophical concept developed by Deleuze and Guatarri (1980) is based on 
the botanical rhizome, a root-like subterranean plant stem that sends out roots below 
ground and shoots above ground from its nodes. Rhizomatic research is continually 
moving off in different directions, replacing familiar understandings with alternative 
transitory and temporary ones. Deleuze and Guatarri identify connectivity and 
heterogeneity as key to rhizomatic thinking, as in the image of the rhizome any point 
can be connected to anything other. For this reason rhizomatic thinking is a model 
that resists structures of domination and rejects linearity; multiplicity and 
unpredictability is central as the number of multiples develop in the rhizome, so do 
the number of possible combinations between different elements.   
 
Consequently in this thesis the main points of discussion are presented and re-
presented, explored and revisited by my returning to salient points. Without the use 
of the journey metaphor the purpose of this revisiting is challenging to communicate; 
at first glance perhaps being misunderstood as repetition. However within the 
metaphor of the journey each return visit, and encounter, can be better understood in 
that with each encounter different experiences are brought to that encounter, even if 
it has been visited before.  For example, returning to the same familiar coastal walk 
brings a different experience on each occasion; not only has the walker changed 
since the last visit because of the experiences that have occurred since the previous 
visit, but the coastal path itself has been changed by the seasons and indeed other 
walkers. Each experience and encounter therefore, whilst it may be familiar, is 
viewed in a unique, for that moment, way. Adopting this approach provides validation 

 
17 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
for the revisiting of salient points through this thesis. The map is offered as a visual 
metaphor of this revisiting of encounters throughout my journey of discovery. 
 
1.2 Explaining the Epi-pro-logue. 
 
 
Traditionally in any thesis construction the final chapter to be written is the introduction 
(Thomas 2017, Dunleavy 2007, Wisker 2008), the rationale being that until the thesis 
is nearly completed the rhetorical meta-discoursal style of writing is not possible. There 
is a discreet irony that whilst the introduction is completed at the end of the thesis 
writing process, from a conventional perspective, it becomes the first part of the thesis; 
setting the background and justifying the context for the research to be communicated. 
In that respect the writing of a conventional thesis ignores the chronological 
experience of the doctoral study and in doing so also ignores the significance of slowly 
emerging ideas that are representative of the journey and distance travelled. Instead 
it offers a linear sequence of events that in many ways do not reflect the thinking and 
development of the apprentice researcher. From the start (the end?) of my thesis I will 
be challenging these linear conventions, as advocated by Koro-Ljunberg (2016), by 
taking an approach that is more representative of my complicated, rhizomatic and 
nomadic journey.  
 
This first chapter of my thesis will guide and signpost the reader, setting out the stall 
to clarify and justify some of the approaches taken, the challenge of course is 

 
18 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
accepting that I am writing this chapter towards the end point of this particular leg of 
my research journey, I already know what comes next and how the thesis as a whole 
will follow. As such I want to reveal the journey of the doctoral study in a chronological 
manner that will provide a framework for the emerging and evolving ideas, findings 
and provocations to be discussed. For that reason then this introductory chapter 
becomes more of a prologue whereby it aims to give some of the back story, introduce 
some of the characters and alert the audience of what to look out for, whilst accepting 
it is written in full knowledge of the story to follow and is uniquely linked to the 
completion of the study; hence I adopt the term ‘Epi-Pro-Logue’.   
 
I turn again here to literature and acknowledge the signposting within one of the most 
familiar prologues, taking from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, to suggest that as I 
endeavour to provide that guidance, signposting and teasing the reader, whilst bearing 
in mind the complexities that will be revealed throughout the thesis, I also ask the 
audience, as Shakespeare did (line 14), to be patient with me for any errors or 
miscommunications within. 
 
 “Two households, both alike in dignity 
(In fair Verona, where we lay our scene), 
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, 
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. 
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes 
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life, 
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows 
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife. 

 
19 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The fearful passage of their death-marked love 
And the continuance of their parents’ rage, 
Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove, 
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage— 
The which, if you with patient ears attend, 
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.”  
 
 
1.3 Travelogue. 
 
The metaphor of a doctoral study as a journey, described by some as a marathon 
rather than a sprint, is a familiar one (Deignan 2017). At the start of my doctoral 
process I recognised this and thought I was prepared for the journey ahead. What 
became apparent after a period of time was that the journey ahead would be full, not 
just of false starts and stoppages, but of episodes of getting lost, and found again, and 
I was not prepared for that. For this reason, to support, guide and prepare others who 
may well take a similar journey, this thesis works like a travelogue through the write-
up of my journey. 
 
The map offered and discussed in my final chapter Trip Advisor belongs too at this 
starting point; not as just an image of where I went but to also offer an awareness of 
the cyclical and overlapping nature of  the various routes, which Deleuze and Guattari 
(1980) refers to as lines of flight, that were made available to me. In understanding the 
field of Children-as-Researchers I see myself as the nomad who as Deleuze and 
Guatarri (1980) suggests, traverses the ‘smooth space’ that is my research, whilst 

 
20 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
acknowledging that the striated space of dominance created by the ‘sedentary’ 
surrounds me. This nomadic approach acknowledges the many possibilities of the 
‘end’ of the thesis; the chapter Check Points: Resting en route outlines where I arrived 
at that time, and is understood to in no way indicate a definitive position (Koro-Ljunberg 
2016).  
 
An important feature of my doctoral journey is the ontological shift from conventional 
humanist qualitative researcher to a post-qualitative researcher, this being a key 
thread that is interwoven throughout. However to offer a detailed meta-discourse about 
that shift within this epi-prologue is not pertinent here, rather I allude to this and as the 
Chorus requests see this as ‘The which, if you with patient ears attend’ (Romeo and 
Juliet 1:1:14).This doctoral travelogue recorded in my thesis details the journey taken, 
and through a reflexive approach examines how the direction of travel changed, and 
how the experiences of the research impacted on me.  
 
1.4  How to Use this Guide. 
 
My journey of (self) discovery examined and explored, initially, ‘How might young 
children be active participants in researching their own educational lives?’ However in 
doing so, a period of re-orientation evolved and my focus relocated to consider 
emerging provocations such as: 
What place does research play in teachers’ lives and what do they believe 
is the relationship between research and their practice? 

 
21 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
How do teachers understand and promote the right of the child to conduct 
their own research? 
How does professional identity impact on teachers seeing themselves as 
researchers? 
What prevents or encourages teachers to carry out research in their 
classrooms? 
How do teachers value the voice of children and how are they responding 
to opportunities for children to become researchers? 
Why is it so challenging for adult gatekeepers to consent to access and 
involvement with research? 
 
Whilst along the way my individual focus has shifted from child participants to adult 
participants, unpicking the concept of Children–as-Researchers by considering how 
children’s agency and children’s voices link to ideas about research, within and beyond 
schools, remains at the heart. Moving to different co-ordinates from which to explore 
the phenomenon of Children-as-Researchers allows an alternative perspective to be 
considered. It is not simply that children became the spring board for new explorations 
but rather the experience of exploring Children-as-Researchers when blurring 
methodologies opened up other spaces that demanded examination. This blurring of 
methodologies becomes entwined with a reflexive approach as they are woven 
together throughout. 
 
As each path was/is travelled I noticed connections and relationships between the 
domains of children, teachers and research, this then formed the enquiry as I toured 
the terrain. Consequently my constant orientating and re-orientating as I found myself 

 
22 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
getting lost, and found again, has meant that there is overlapping and over/under-
laying within this written representation of the thinking, noticing, finding, presenting, 
and re-presenting, of the research. As with all good travelogues I want the reader not 
only to travel with me as I present my learning and findings but to also be able to find 
their way through, around and within my thinking, finding their own places of interest. 
For ease then I include here a How to use this Guide which will attempt to explain how 
chapters relate to each other and how this may be understood  to be different from 
perhaps a more familiar conventional approach to writing a thesis. 
1.4.1 Conventional Thesis Structure. 
 
Guidance given through the plethora of Doctoral Guides available via blogs, text books 
and help sites suggest the following linear structure, (Figure 1), as a conventional

This recommended approach provides a linear strategy where each chapter leads 
conveniently and with ease to the next, revealing the decisions made at the design 
stage of the project, the justification for the approaches taken and then the data 
produced by the research tools to then be discussed and analysed drawing together 
to offer conclusions and overall demonstrating the new learning revealed by the 
investigation. Such an approach even in qualitative research is heavily influenced by 
Science Based Research that St Pierre describes as being ‘monolithic and stifling’ 
(2014: 3).  
 
My journey, from conventional humanist qualitative research to post-qualitative, calls 
for a more active structure that in itself recognises the entanglement of the concepts 
of children, teachers and research, and responds to that. To this extent then there will 
be surprises along the way that may, for some, be challenging. The journey metaphor 
adopted celebrates the need to visit and then re-visit aspects of Children-as-
Researchers, to do this justice at times there is a need to dig deeper and unravel 
elements that were not noted on earlier visits. Adopting this approach and being 
prepared to follow those ‘lines of flight’ (Deleuze and Guattari 1980), will at times mean 
not just revisiting a concept but also offering new literature that had not been 
considered previously, for example in a conventional literature review. I do this with 
confidence, not only as this travelogue is a record of developing thinking and 
discovery, but as will be regularly referred to throughout the thesis, I am aiming to not 
only do things differently but to write up differently, or as Honan and Bright (2016) 

 
24 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
advocate I have not attempted to write ‘according to what is expected’, but ‘to create- 
to bring something to life’ (p733).  
 
Additionally a conventional thesis may well include additional materials in an appendix, 
for example background information, raw data, and case studies as supplementary 
information. Within my thesis in particular it is worth noting that appendices have not 
been used. The rationale for this is that I attempt, as part of the travelogue approach, 
to take the reader with me and experience the heuristic nature of this nomadic 
exploration of Children-as-Researchers. To this effect then the reader will find within 
the main body of the thesis case studies as part of an auto-ethnographic approach, 
along with my research proposal, as each form an important element in the process 
of my ontological shift towards a post-qualitative methodology. This is something else 
for the reader to watch out for moving ahead. I have, particularly in the early chapters, 
made a decision to limit editing of my initial writings so that the formation of my post-
qualitative approaches are revealed in the spaces that they emerged. This approach 
was not there at the beginning but grew out of experience, and interaction with 
Children –as –Researchers and has influenced the structure as well as the content of 
the thesis.

1.4.2 Travelogue Thesis Structure. 
 
As clarified at the start of the Epi-Pro-Logue this doctoral journey is not just one of 
travel from beginning to end, but is a journey of transformation with episodes of 
positioning and re-positioning; at times this was turbulent, messy and distracting. The 
structure of the thesis responds to this, initially adopting what may be considered a 
conventional approach, and then in response to the turbulent encounters made on the 
journey takes off in different directions, which are not always predictable ones. Figure 
2 provides an overview of the structure and briefly sets out the salient features.

Without wishing to simply offer another contents page I want to draw attention to how 
each section of the thesis overlaps and where key concepts are found, and along the 
way revisited. This is not about repetition but rather the inter-relatedness threaded 

 
27 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
between those key concepts and as such is indicative of the entanglement. I have 
avoided using the term themes and the conventional humanist qualitative concept of 
grounded theory, the justification for which will be fully explained in Chapter 4: Finding 
the Way –Methodological Orientations and Chapter 5: Creating a Map. Rather than 
themes I prefer the idea of encounters when referring to critical matters. 
Figure 3 illustrates the frequency of encounters throughout the research journey and I 
draw attention to these now as key aspects to look out for in the reading of this thesis. 
I offer this holistic image of the thesis illustrating how each section overlaps and 
responds to the others.

Finally Figure 4 demonstrates how the sections I have crafted in my thesis may well 
cover the expected elements of conventional thesis. I do this not to return to a 
Conventional Humanist Qualitative approach but rather to offer reassurance that what 
may appear to be random and spontaneous is the consequence of carefully crafted 
decisions that continue to illustrate my ontological position and my commitment to the 
post-qualitative paradigm.

1.5 Travelogue – KEY 
 
At this starting point it is necessary to warn the reader that at various points in the 
thesis there will be a change of font – colour and style.  I offer this at this point not to 
alarm but as an indicator of changing voices and developing identities. This 
experimental approach is something that could be said to be risky and playful but given 
my Early Years professional background is something that is indicative of ‘me’ as an 
educator and researcher of children’s social worlds.  
 
The different layers of this thesis are demonstrating not just the multiplicities of the key 
concepts of children, research and teachers, and their inter/intra-relatedness, but go 
some way to demonstrate the multiplicities of my professional identity which is an 
encounter that will be visited and re-visited throughout the thesis. In many ways this 
is an unexpected encounter and is indicative of one of the unravelling threads 
discovered when adopting a blurred approach to methodologies that explore the 
terrain of Children-as-Researchers. It is challenging to determine an agreed definition 
of professional identity, due to how the term identity has been used over time; shifting 
from a position in the early 20th Century whereby individual’s identity and self-image 
was viewed to be formed by themselves autonomously, to a more contemporary 
position whereby identity is now deemed created by society (Olsen 2012).  
Contemporary perspectives on the formation of professional identity draw upon 
sociocultural theory which understands that individuals align themselves to society’s 
image, in terms of values and beliefs, of that professional role and as such their identity 

 
31 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
is formed through their individual choices in response to these values and beliefs. For 
this reason professional identify formation is fluid and constant (Taylor 2017). As such 
my own professional identity continues to be questioned, formed and reformed 
throughout this thesis and this exploration of who I am has impacted not only on my 
developing ontology, but in how I have expressed myself throughout the thesis. 
 
In my endeavours to find myself and understand how my identity and subjectivity 
impacts/impacted on my research I have drawn on the work of Peshkin (1988), who 
proposed that it is unrealistic to set objectivity as an ideal in qualitative research, and 
that rather researchers should be ‘meaningfully attentive to their own subjectivity’ 
(Peshkin 1988:17), and furthermore that researchers should systematically identify 
that subjectivity. Peshkin identifies six I’s, versions of his subjectivity, which he noted 
during his reflective approach to his research.  In analysing Peshkin’s model, Savage 
(2007) suggests the foundation of these intrinsic I’s are found in a range of sources 
that include belief and value systems, experiences of environments, people and 
communities; resonating with the idea of identity formation. In Chapter 2: The Weary 
Traveller, where I encounter professional identity for the first time, I try to identify the 
intrinsic subjective I’s revealed through the pilot study in more detail.  
 
For now though, reflecting on this travelogue I offer the following key in Figure 5 to 
help the reader to identify the different voices, and perhaps my differing professional 
identities, within this thesis. The change of font, style and colour, emphasises the 

 
32 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
multiplicities of intrinsic subjectivities, and voices, as the travelogue reveals the 
journey undertaken and the shift from conventional to post evolves.

1.6 Preparing to travel – personal motivation. 
 
This thesis follows on from previous research at MA level and a subsequent paper, 
‘Children Deconstructing Childhood’ (Lowe 2012), which explored children’s 
perspectives of childhood. In an attempt to address the question ‘What is childhood?’ 
my review of literature then identified that whilst commentaries on childhood were 
abundant, they depended on secondary sources, namely adults. This initial piece of 
research drew on the primary source, children. In that research, methodologies were 
developed to promote the ‘voice of the child’ and identified a range of discourses that 
children in my research held about childhood. However in this previous research I 
concluded that whilst including children as research participants and listening to their 
‘voice’, my research was still essentially ‘adultist’ as the adult was the main researcher 
and analyst. Further exploration of Children-as-Researchers drew on the work of 
Kellett (2005, 2010), and Bucknall (2010, 2012), both of whom suggested the benefits 
and development of research not just on, or with children, but by children. Whilst 
Kellett, (2005, 2010), Kellett and Ward (2008), Bucknall (2012), and Elton-Chalcraft 
(2011) focussed on children from 8 to 12 years of age, coming from an Early Years 
background I wanted to explore Children-as-Researchers projects with younger 
children; with the aim being to support their developing research skills. Ultimately this 
would be in order for them to design and carry out subsequent projects whereby they 
would be lead researchers ascertaining children’s views of their right to participation 
in education. At the start of this doctoral study I identified my aims to be: 
To describe and analyse the origins of, and context to, children’s right to 
participation in education 

 
34 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
To explore how to actively involve children as co-researchers in 
investigating their participation in their educational lives 
To elicit children’s views of their right to participation in education 
 
As I travelled and gathered momentum on my journey these aims changed and were 
restated, how this change came/comes about is discussed in Chapter 3: Dealing with 
Wanderlust. Through my blurring of methodologies I subsequently aimed to examine 
the spaces between children – research – teachers, and their interconnectivity. In 
doing so the new space between becomes the thread that is unravelled and runs 
through the thesis. 
 
1.6.1 Health and Safety Checks 
 
To start the journey from the perspective of how to actively engage young children as 
researchers, with a view to elicit their understanding and perspectives of their right to 
participation in education, and through doing so to move towards a provocative, 
personalised post-qualitative inquiry, is risky to say the least. The additional layer that 
examines the place of teachers and their understanding of research, with and without 
children, complicates the matter further and, as will be explained and explored within 
Chapter 6: Well-trodden Trails and Off the Beaten Track, is indicative of the post 
humanist ideas of entanglement and the inter/intra-relationships between, within, and 
beyond these concepts. However, whilst risky, I did not make this shift blindly but 
rather ‘in dialogue’ with St Pierre, MacLure and Mazzei who like me, have adopted a 
post-qualitative approach to research. A significant aspect of this thesis is an 

 
35 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
exploration of how the posts can open up new ways of thinking and new ways of 
understanding the hidden complexities of social world which, from a conventional 
perspective, initially appear to be stable. As such my approach to data, both the 
representation and analysis of that data, and my ability to think with theory is revealed 
through the travelogue.  
 
The context for my awakening to new ways, (for me), of thinking about the world lies 
within an exploration of Children-as-Researchers. However the conclusions reached 
towards the end of this thesis, Chapter 7: Check Points, Resting En route. only go part 
way towards answering the original questions that I posed: 
How might young children be active participants in researching their own 
educational lives? 
How is children’s ‘participation’ within the field of education, understood by 
children and other stakeholders?   
 
This is not to say that the questions stated originally were not well thought out, as an 
analysis of the proposal process and Form 9R shows in 4.6 Deconstructing 
Conventional Methodologies/Orthodoxies, the background to these ideas was well 
researched and justified. The outcome of the initial stages of my research journey 
relate to the fact that they were the wrong questions to be asked; my evolving ontology 
merely opened my eyes to this. Careful consideration of my ontological shift is 
examined in Chapter 4: Finding the Way, in which I critique my initial proposal from a 
post-structuralist perspective and use this process to re-set more appropriate 

 
36 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
questions. As such my reflexions and exploration in Chapter 4: Finding the Way’ 
demonstrate the to-ing and fro-ing of this doctoral study and as part of this health 
warning it is only fair to draw attention to the fact that a turbulent and transformative 
approach remains a constant throughout. Koro-Ljungberg (2016) adopts the idea of 
‘productive failures’ to deflect the conventional idea of the need for conclusions and 
endings. I offer a health warning here that in the same way this thesis may be said to 
fail to conclude and provide a perfect response to the initial questions posed, and 
whilst I embrace the unfinished business here and the opening up of new beginnings 
(Koro-Ljungberg 2016) I accept that for some who hold a different ontological view of 
the world this may lead to feelings of uncomfortableness. 
 
1.6.2 Travel Essentials. 
 
As will become apparent, through the telling of this tale, the ontological shift examined 
through my thesis became/becomes/is becoming apparent after setting off. The ‘event’ 
outlined in Chapter 2: The Weary Traveller examines this and demonstrates the re-
orientation of my perspective having carried out the pilot study. From this point on my 
developing confidence grew/grows and provides a foundation to explore more 
playfully, expressing myself through metaphors, as well as alliteration and patterns of 
text, and offers a more creative travelogue, through a new (for me) way of writing. In 
doing so this enables me to confirm, affirm and reaffirm my emerging ontological 
position as well as initial conclusions and/or provocations. This emerging process is 
seen most clearly in Chapter 3: Dealing with Wanderlust and Chapter 6: Well-trodden 
Trails and Off the Beaten Track.  

 
37 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
My playful approach adopted throughout could be said to be triggered by my 
professional roots and identity which are considered/re-considered in both Chapter 6: 
Well-trodden Trails and Off the Beaten Track, and again in Chapter 7: Check Points, 
Resting En Route; both chapters examine the place of professional identity and its 
relationship to teachers, children and research, and how each is inter/intra-related. My 
initial interest in children stems from my early career as an Early Years Teacher, or 
perhaps it is the other way round, my interest in being an Early Years Teacher stems 
from my interest in young children? Being able to state what comes first, or rather 
which I was/am aware of first, reinforces the complexities of professional identities and 
the entanglement within, and that this is not visible by smoothing out (Mazzei 2010). 
What is visible though, is the influence of play on many aspects of my professional 
identity. As an Early Years Teacher I promoted the development of play as a tool for 
young children to learn and experience the world, and as an academic I draw on playful 
approaches to my teaching as indicated through my social constructivist approach to 
learning in Higher Education. There is no definitive response to the question ‘What is 
Play?’, most Early Years academics and practitioners would draw upon familiar 
responses that are linked to both child-led and adult-led versions of the same, 
engaging, hands-on, practical experiences that are open ended; spontaneous in the 
form of child-initiated play, or curriculum driven, in terms of adult-initiated play. Play is 
a choice, it involves sustained thinking and activity, often involving being fully 
immersed in activity which, as any Early Years Practitioner or academic would recall 
is described classically by Bruce (2011) as ‘wallowing in learning’.  Defining play is 
both challenging and debatable; whilst there is not just one, but many definitions of 
play, my preference is to see play as ‘a subset of life … an arrangement in which one 

 
38 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
can practise behaviour without dreading its consequences’ (Csikszentmihalyi 
1981:14).  
 
Within this thesis then, by adopting a playful approach I find myself wallowing in 
learning and being confident to take risks without dreading their consequences. The 
link between play and my playfulness, and being able to take risks, is key to 
understanding my approach to my doctoral study. I acknowledge the risks I take within 
the format and style of my research and in the playful presentation of both text and 
images. Indeed this playful approach is something I take away from the research 
experience and will be considered more fully in Chapter 8: Trip Advisor. 
 
Having set the context, justified the approaches adopted throughout the thesis, and 
prepared the reader for the bumpy and busy journey ahead, the next chapter takes 
the first ‘lines of flight’ to be followed.

In which the significance of the ‘event’ is considered and the first ‘lines of flight’ take the reader to new 
spaces, teased by nascent deliberations of professional identity in relation to Children-as-Researcher 
projects  and emerging paradigm shifts. 

 
40 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
2.1 Auto-ethnographic approaches 
 
Adopting an auto-ethnographic, reflexive approach within this chapter enables me to 
explore the moments in my research when I was faced with empirical blind alleys and 
silences. In doing so I demonstrate and acknowledge from the outset my own influence 
on the research in a positive way, accepting that my subjectivity and other emotional 
influences are not only apparent in the research but enabled/enables the research to 
live and breathe as an organic process rather than being a predefined linear, or 
objective, means to an end (Flick 2014, Brand 2015).  
 
Whilst acknowledging that the auto-ethnographic approach in this chapter allows for a 
revelation of emotions (Ellis and Bochner 2010), I am conscious of the criticisms of 
Freeman (2015) and will seek to avoid solipsism by remaining realistic and 
representative of self-knowing. This chapter reflects a moment in my research journey 
that demonstrates who, how, and what, has influenced my shifting epistemological 
and methodological decisions taken as the unfolding and revelation of research 
questions/provocations became apparent. Through designing, trialling and reviewing 
a methodology, previously proposed with confidence, an acceptance not just of a 
change in direction but of the multiplicities of potential directions became apparent. 
Consequently an evolution in thought and the beginning of a blurring of methodologies 
can be presented as a series of research decisions at various crossroads as my ideas 
interlinked and cross-fertilised, with backward and forward glances whilst I 
considered/reflected upon the research path I had travelled.  

 
41 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Adopting a rhizomatic approach to an ongoing analysis of, and reflections on, the 
research experience, enabled what Deleuze and Guattari (1980) referred to as lines 
of flight to emerge. These lines of flight acknowledge the multiplicities of the social 
world and the interrelatedness of concepts as they continue to change in nature and 
in doing so, connect and reconnect with other multiplicities, establishing the idea that 
the social world and concepts within it are not fixed and stable. Noticing and following 
the lines of flight ultimately encouraged, and nurtured, the percolation of provocations 
rather than linear research questions that through the pilot study took me to a number 
of empirical blind alleys. Although frustrating at the time, they were nonetheless useful 
as a means of identifying where I did want to go and importantly why. Additionally by 
adopting a more reflexive stance I identified the barriers, and mixed messages, that I 
now term ‘data-fog’. These had to be untangled to reveal, not empirical questions, but 
rather provocations, musings and notions, illustrating a multiplicity of layers, levels, 
and depth of my research field. 
 
However, it is not my intention here to invoke an “epistemology of emotion, moving the 
reader to feel the feelings of the other” (Denzin 1997:228), but rather to illustrate the 
new space from which the emerging ideas that ultimately became the re-focus of the 
research can be mapped. In terms of establishing the aims and questions of this thesis 
this chapter is the story of how I ‘begin-again’, (Said 1978 cited in Pryke et al 2003).

2.2 Contexts. 
 
The false starts and dead ends experienced as part of my journey, were initially 
misunderstood. The challenges of trying to adopt a conventional research approach 
to something that was developing rhizomatically was essentially the cause of friction, 
unsettledness and weariness. Now I understand this to be indicative of what 
O’Donnell (2014) cited in Koro-Ljunberg (2016: 102) refers to as ‘productive failure’ 
that opens up spaces for more generative work. It was only as I explored and 
understood the rhizomatic nature of my research that I could begin to move towards 
the not –yet-seen, or as St Pierre suggests to a place where I could “produce 
different knowledge and produce knowledge differently” (St.Pierre, 1997, p.175). 
This realisation then influenced my thinking in terms of questioning how I could 
research emerging ideas that were/are not stable, whilst accepting and valuing the 
emergent blurring of methodology, and my own shifting and repositioning ontological 
and epistemological beliefs.   
 
Barad’s (2007) use of the term onto-epistemology to demonstrate the entanglement 
of ontology and epistemology ratifies my repositioning. As such this enables/enabled 
me to recognise and value the act that the ‘silent data’ and many false starts were in 
fact rich data and were revealing previously unconsidered aspects of children’s 
participation in research, and how young children can be actively researching their 
own educational lives.  Trying to seek reassurance in this was challenging but has 
been influenced by St Pierre (2013), and Lather (2013), both advocates of post-

 
43 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
qualitative methodology. The challenges that St Pierre lays down in relation to the PhD 
proposal being a mere suggestion of future thinking and therefore unpredictable and 
perhaps unreliable, due to the formulation of a compartmentalised approach to 
qualitative research, has provided me with a secure stance in which to place myself, 
as it is from that position that I recognise I was/am beginning to reveal myself as post 
–qualitative researcher. 
 
By adopting a more post-qualitative reflexive approach, analysing and considering the 
interactions between the researcher and the research has enabled me to recognise, 
and make sense of, key learning points on my journey from qualitative to post-
qualitative researcher.  This journey has taken me from a naïve position 
misunderstanding the values and energy within the silence, and sometimes empty 
data sets, to a position of being able to interact, problematise and validate the 
challenges in ascertaining how children can be active participants in researching their 
own educational lives, and how the complexities of Children-as-Researcher projects 
are understood by teachers. 
 
2.3 Towards the Post-Qualitative. 
 
What follows next is the narrative that reveals the weariest, but ultimately productive, 
leg of the journey, from the initial proposal through a number of pilot-studies, to the 
viewing platform that was/is my Children-as-Researchers project. The narrative and 
reflexive exploration of my experience aims to elucidate the emerging methodological 

 
44 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
stance discussed in subsequent chapters. According to Fraser (2004: 180) ‘personal 
storytelling is now seen as a valid means of knowledge production’ due potentially to 
the legitimisation of a drive to both explore and accept post-qualitative approaches.  
The narrative offered here is done so in recognition that narratives can be used as a 
basis for the ‘processes of personal and social transformation, and as motivations for 
these processes, as well’, (Suarez-Ortega 2012:189) and in doing so demonstrates 
reflexivity. 
 
 
2.3.1 Proposal and Participants. 
 
My initial ideas for this doctoral study proposed to carry out a pilot-study at one school 
where I would develop materials to teach aspects of research methods to a group of 
children aged 8 –9. Once these materials had been developed, tried and evaluated I 
would then be in a position to repeat this with other schools in order that children, once 
trained, would then be able to research the lives of younger children. My thoughts 
were that for children to understand the research process as a researcher they first 
needed to experience the research process as a participant. This cycle of experience 
would enable a better understanding of research methods and would mirror my own 
pedagogical position based on a constructivist approach to young children’s learning.  
 
Having submitted my original proposal for Researching Children: Researching 
Children I set about making contact with schools that would be able to accommodate 

 
45 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
me in terms of developing and delivering an innovative opportunity for young children 
to become active participants in researching their educational lives. The relationships 
I had with a number of schools in the West Midlands were good. I had, in a previous 
life, been a successful primary school teacher and then an advisor for a local authority 
so recognised and understood the organisation and culture of current education 
practice and policy. Added to this I was actively involved in the assessment and 
support of Initial Teacher Trainees, and at regular periods through the academic year 
made visits to schools to assess students’ performance and support their development 
as they worked towards gaining Qualified Teacher Status.  I felt confident that I would 
be able to share my enthusiasm for my project with a range of forward thinking and 
determined Head Teachers and Class Teachers alike.  
 
The process of actively seeking schools as partners began with earnest enthusiasm, 
and above all confidence that the gatekeepers would be intrigued by my proposal and 
would be keen to facilitate the project, however these assumptions were not borne out 
by my experience of the pilot study. From my viewpoint the project was exciting, 
offered enhanced opportunities to deliver a creative curriculum, would be engaging for 
young children and would above all enable schools to be actively promoting Article 12 
of UNCRC, The Right to Participation and in doing so fulfil their commitment to Article 
42, The Right to have Knowledge of Rights. Further, schools participating in the project 
would be able to demonstrate a commitment to not only teaching about children’s right 
to participation but would be able to demonstrate how they actively listened to children 

 
46 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
and created a community of learners based on mutual respect, empowerment and 
validation of voice.  
 
Although I recognised that gaining access to schools was always going to be a 
challenging part of the research, the frequent refusals, avoidance and barriers in both 
trying to obtain access to discuss the proposal, and the project itself, with key decision 
makers and stakeholders, made me continuously question and doubt a number of 
elements. Firstly my ability to communicate with educational professionals, secondly 
my own professional identity, both as a PhD student or/and as a University lecturer, 
and additionally how, and if, I was understood and respected by colleagues in schools. 
 
In total 10 schools were invited to participate. 6 schools declined having identified time 
constraints and being ‘busy’ as a reason for not participating. One school identified 
‘parents’ being the reason not to participate and one that children would not be able 
to do this. One school initially expressed interest but at a meeting raised concerns 
about children’s ability to be ‘honest’ about their educational lives and that the school 
would not be taking the lead in ‘selecting’ children to participate. After a period of ten 
weeks only one school expressed interest in the project and were eager to go ahead. 
This became the setting for the first pilot study and the reflexive narrative 2.4 The Story 
of Pilot Study 1 – Golden Time tells the account of this encounter. 
 

 
47 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The two reflexive narratives to follow are an example of narrative enquiry and 
demonstrate the reciprocal relationship between myself, and the research; the 
revelation of which was a lengthy process of 18 months. Accepting the length of the 
narrative is deliberate and reflects not only the complexities and the reflexive approach 
but also the intricacies of the nature of Children-as-Researchers, as such then the 
stories offered are not abridged versions – to do so would dilute the significance of this 
crucial layer of my journey. Writing the narrative proved to be a seminal moment in 
understanding myself as a novice-researcher. Accepting the immaturity of style and 
my distracted, at times, thoughts, these two stories illustrate how far I have travelled 
in the doctoral journey and consequently the narratives are, for the most, unchanged 
since they were first written. 
 
2.4 The Story of Pilot Study 1 – Golden Time 
 
Children-as-Researchers – Golden Time. 
The planning of the activities that were age appropriate and could prompt discussions about the children’s 
understanding of both research, and children’s rights, depended on my own understanding of effective 
classroom practice and learning theories. As I developed a series of sessions for the children I found myself 
adopting a teacher approach, I clarified aims and objectives, considered pedagogical approaches and reflected 
on my understanding of child development and the National Curriculum. At that time I believed my 
professional identity to be firmly fixed in the world of Higher Education and research, being a primary school 
teacher was something I was in the past. The way I planned and prepared a sequence of activities to not only 
engage and interest, and teach, a group of 8 year olds was automatic. As such I failed to even acknowledge 
that I was drawing on, and was influenced by, my previous professional role and experience. This initial 
encounter with professional identity only emerged through this reflexive narrative process and 
became/becomes part of the research provocations to be ultimately examined in the main part of the PhD.  

 
48 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Early discussions with the Head Teacher outlined how I would like to proceed; we agreed that I would have 
access to a class group of 26 eight year olds, that consent letters would be distributed to parents, and children, 
alongside a leaflet aimed at the children explaining what the research was about – the class teacher would 
monitor and collect these for me. The initial idea of an afterschool club was deemed by the Head Teacher not 
to be possible due to the current range of clubs. It was agreed though that I would have access to as many 
children who wanted to participate in the activities on a series of Friday afternoons over the course of a 2 
month period. I emphasised that the children needed to be invited to take part and that I wanted to use my 
first name when with the children, this for me was a small step in addressing aspects of  the power at play in 
adult – child relationships, particularly within the school environment. The Head Teacher acknowledged that 
the idea of the initial piece of research whereby children would be exploring their educational lives and their 
right to participate in school decisions was of particular interest as the school had recently established a School 
Council, and involved children in planning their own curriculum.  
Armed with a range of activities to include an introduction using Concept Cartoons, (Keogh and Naylor 1999), I 
arrived at the school to be greeted by an enthusiastic welcome party of six or seven children who had 
gathered at the playground gate. A brief conversation ensued through the fence. ‘Quick, it’s Mrs Lowe’ 
someone shouted and the children ran back to their classroom. A lone child remained and asked me ‘Are you 
Mrs Lowe?’ ‘Yes’ I replied, ‘but you can call me Rose’. The child laughed and said ‘OK, I’ll see you in the class 
room in a bit, you’ve got to go in there to get your badge I think’. He helpfully pointed to the main entrance 
with the imposing sign ‘All Visitors must upon arrival go to the Main Office’. I walked towards the Main 
Entrance and he ran back to his classroom shouting ‘Quick, get ready Mrs Rose is here’. At the time the use of 
the title ‘Mrs’ just made me smile, later I recognised this as another encounter with professional identities. I 
proceeded to complete the formalities of signing in, badging up and agreeing to the school’s Safeguarding 
Policy. On reflection I realised that I had moved easily, and with confidence and security, in to the micro-
culture that is a suburban primary school. 
 I knew the school as I had previously worked with, and assessed, trainee teachers there on placement. I knew 
the Head Teacher in this capacity too, and had discussed issues of quality and performance in terms of trainee 
teachers. I felt confident in the school and had always been made welcome, being offered refreshments and 
the use of facilities – which was not always common practice at other school settings. 
Upon arriving in the class room I discovered 26 children all sitting in their seats, straight and upright, arms 
folded with an air of excitement. The class teacher then introduced me as ‘Mrs Lowe’ to the class. She 
commented that the children were all prepared and very excited about the project and that she had explained 
everything to them and who I was. Immediately I felt apprehension and confusion as this was not how I had 
planned the session. I had expected to be with a group of children who had chosen to participate and to be in 
an environment that leant itself to discussion and elicitation of ideas, not such a formal teaching environment. 

 
49 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
My explanations to the Head Teacher had included some ideas about using carpet space, perhaps a spare 
classroom or corridor space. I wondered, as I was faced with this different sort of environment whether I had 
failed to communicate this effectively or whether the HT had different ideas about the either the feasibility of 
such organisation or indeed the values and principles of an environment as that. I was unsure of how to 
proceed, the teacher then said to the class that she would leave me to get on and emphasised to the children 
that they were free to say anything they wished regarding how they felt about their rights at school. A 
comment made as she left the room was “The children have been so looking forward to their Golden Time 
reward of you coming in”, and with that she left the classroom. My previous professional experience enabled 
me to make sense of the term ‘Golden Time’ to refer to an extrinsic reward for good behaviour, I also 
immediately recognised the speed and eagerness with which the class teacher left the room. This was also her 
‘Golden Time’, when she was free to be able to get on with some other teaching task, perhaps planning, 
marking, or paperwork, relishing the opportunity of not having to take responsibility of the class. I quickly 
decided to proceed, more or less as planned, in order to make the best of the situation as I saw it. Initial 
reflections on this opportunity to trial some participatory research methods and start to elicit children’s 
understanding of rights were positive. I began to talk with the children introducing myself, as Rose, checking 
on what they liked to be called and reminding them of the leaflet they had had. I tried to check their 
understanding of the project and to also check for asscent, reminding them that taking part was up to them 
and that this wasn’t a lesson. I tried to create a relaxed atmosphere aware of my body language and tone of 
voice, and use of humour to reinforce the idea that I was not their teacher but a researcher, that taking part 
was up to them and that they had the right to change their minds and join in or not. Feeling happier about 
how things were developing I moved on to introduce a series of images taken from a Reggio Emilia exhibition 
where children had drawn images of their rights. Gently and without too much need for prompting or probing 
children began to offer their ideas of what ‘Rights’ meant and what they thought their rights were. I was 
conscious that instead of having a small group of willing participants I actually had a class of 26 children, some 
of whom by now were losing interest. The images I had prepared to show them of how other children saw 
their rights proved problematic. The images drawn by very young children were greeted with ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs,’ 
however I had not, in my current professional identify as HE Academic and PhD student, recognised that at 
least one drawing could be interpreted as rude, with limbs being mistaken for genitals. At this point the large 
group of children erupted in to hysterical laughter, my response was to immediately go into teacher mode. 
Giving clear concise instructions about behaviour expectations, including noise levels, rules about speaking and 
waiting for others to finish speaking, and significantly rules about not speaking when I was giving instructions. 
Those that had been sitting on tables were asked to return to chairs, those that has been making ‘rude’ 
suggestions were reminded of appropriate behaviour, and became biddable. Those who were losing interest 
returned to the ‘fold’, suddenly eager to please. The children seem to accept this change in my person as I 
morphed into teacher, which on reflection is probably what they were more used to in terms of adult 

 
50 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
behaviour. I went on to outline the different activities with the children to offer choices about what they 
wanted to do in order to record their understanding of rights. Some children chose to draw and write, others 
were attracted to a ‘decision pyramid’ whereby the had to identify who made decisions in school and order 
these people in terms of who decides the most, others were happy to complete a questionnaire and some 
children opted to look at and discuss a selection of books about UNCRC and Rights of Children.  
The feelings of confusion as I tried to establish my identity and professional persona during this time were 
acutely uncomfortable. When reflecting afterwards I recognised that I was facing a dilemma. I could either 
maintain an environment whereby power differentials were, as far as I was concerned and given my 
understanding at the time, beginning to be broken down, or maintain an environment where I demonstrated 
effective class room practice and behaviour management. Essentially this was the root of my confusion. I made 
the decision that in order to gather data and elicit the children’s ideas about their rights and the concept of 
rights I needed to maintain an effective working environment and this was what I chose to do. I noted this in 
my journal at the time and congratulated myself as to how I had prioritised the research, recognising that I 
needed to review how the next session would be organised.  
With hindsight though I wonder whether the pull of my professional identity as an effective classroom 
practitioner and an innate need to demonstrate this within the micro-culture of the school environment was in 
fact too strong to ignore, subliminally or otherwise. It was a much later moment of realisation that I recognised 
I ‘chose’ to be the teacher rather than the researcher. The children were happy to participate, when I noticed 
those who had had enough I offered them the chance to make their own choices about what they could do 
next, asking them to take responsibility for something they thought their teacher would be happy with, of 
these some chose to play cards, read books, simply chat or draw. I remember thinking this was reminiscent of 
‘wet play-times’ and in fact at one point used this as a term of reference to help children to decide and make 
choices that would not impact negatively on them when their teacher returned, again my previous 
professional experience and understanding of the culture of primary schools was drawn on here. With the 
benefit of hindsight though I ask myself if I was also concerned that the choices the children made didn’t 
reflect negatively on me.  
At the end of the first session I had data in the form of 18 completed questionnaires, 14 decision pyramids, 17 
pieces of drawing and writing and 12 children who had completed a ‘Who decides?’ activity, where they had 
indicated who made decisions about aspects of their lives. Whilst this data enabled an evaluation of the 
research tools that that would enable children’s voices to be heard, and to elicit children’s perceptions of their 
rights within school, it became increasingly apparent that the challenges in terms of professional identity and 
importantly the children’s understanding of my role was proving to be at first a frustration, but towards the 
end of this pilot, and in the second pilot study, was the pivotal point from which the beginnings  of ‘begin-
again’ grew (Said 1978, cited in Pryke et al 2003).  

 
51 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
As the session progressed I was aware of the intensity of some discussions that I had with small groups of 
children but was also aware that there was a group of children who had withdrawn from the activities, as I 
focussed on the discussion I became increasingly aware that noise levels were rising and this shift in the 
environment whilst not distracting for the discussion group began to make me feel uncomfortable. Once again 
I transitioned into teacher mode and began to circulate around the room reminding children to stay on task 
and gave them a chance to consider the end of the session, beginning to tidy up, return materials and so on. 
The teacher at this point returned and immediately began a clapping rhythm often used to get children’s 
attention and to indicate a change of activity. Without hesitation the class teacher issued instructions about 
tidying up with mock dismay as to the mess in the room and set a timer for children to compete tidying up and 
return to their seats. As I tried to draw to an end some discussion points with the children I noticed that the 
teacher was standing at the front of the class waiting for everyone, including me, to be quiet. The children just 
handed me their completed questionnaires and the teacher drew the session to an end by saying she hoped 
they had enjoyed the activities and that they all looked very interesting. She invited the children to say thank 
you to me, which they did dutifully and at this point it was clear that the end of the day had come; notices 
were given out and children were asked to collect their coats and go out to the playground to meet their 
parents. I hesitantly waited by the door, almost hoping that some parents might be interested in what I had 
been doing and who I was, however the class teacher, through body language, was evidently not going to 
allow me access to the parents to engage with conversation with them. At this point I was certainly the 
researcher again and separate to the children and class life. This shifting of roles and identity undoubtedly was 
a challenge for me. I needed to know that the class teacher valued and respected me both as a researcher and 
a teacher and the feelings of doubt that she did neither was unsettling. 
Once the children had gone home the teacher and I discussed how things had gone. I felt I needed to clarify 
again the organisation that would be more beneficial to me and suggested that we met during the week to 
discuss what we could do next. I was acutely aware how difficult it had been to actually get access to children 
and was keen to make sure that this opportunity was not limited, or closed down. I can only liken this 
experience to having to say ‘thank you’ for a well meant gift, but then in the same breath asking for the receipt 
so the gift could be exchanged. Simply put it felt like I was being ungrateful by suggesting the session was not 
exactly as I had wanted and could it be organised differently next time. Acknowledging this I compromised and 
suggested that a good start had been made, (which I maintain still), but that in reality to work with so many 
children was a challenge. I tried to make it clear that this was a challenge in terms of the research project but 
immediately felt the teacher understood this to be a challenge for me in terms of teaching and managing a 
large group of children. Once again the varied interpretation of professional roles was alluded to in dialogue, in 
unspoken emotions and in the desire to establish professional identity. At this point I could not comprehend 
why I felt I needed to be valued as a teacher by the school, and yet I was keen to position myself as a 

 
52 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
researcher, and not a teacher as far as the children were concerned. I started to wonder about the similarities 
and differences between these two roles and the links to Children as Researcher projects.  
On four subsequent occasions I came into school on a Friday afternoon but I was not working directly in the 
classroom but in the corridor and library. I did not have the large group of children to work with but outlined 
the various activities available and invited children to come to participate. I was still aiming to explore a range 
of research tools that would enable children’s voices to be heard and to elicit children’s perceptions of their 
rights in school, and to evaluate the various strategies the school had established to involve children as 
decision makers. 
At the start of the project the Head Teacher was interested in finding out what the children thought about the 
various strategies that had been implemented at the school to promote and involve children as decision 
makers, this became a focus of the interviews, both individual and group that I carried out. In addition to 
conducting group interviews I provided children with flip-cams to be able to interview and record other 
children’s opinions about the school council, the eco council and planning boards that were adopted by the 
school. In the last session I interviewed children about the whole project and elicited their feelings, values and 
beliefs, about the research project as a whole, how they felt about being research participants, and 
importantly how they felt about conducting research themselves. The findings from the pilot were to be 
presented to the Head Teacher, Senior Managers and Governors as an evaluation of the strategies and a 
summary of what children understood about their rights in school. Simultaneously this would give me a good 
indicator of how effective the research tools were, and a platform from which to plan a project that would 
enable the voices of children to be heard and importantly how to actively involve children as co-researchers in 
investigating their participation in their educational lives. 
On the second and third occasion the same group of children agreed to join in focus group interviews, all of 
these children were able to articulate their understanding of rights and were also able to give examples of 
when, and when not, they were able to exercise their rights. During these focus groups children were at ease, 
were confident in calling me by my first name , were happy to make personal comments about my clothes, my 
bag, my pens (all mostly positive) that I hadn’t seen or heard during the whole class session. Having observed 
the children with their teacher it was clear there was a secure relationship, that children were fond of their 
teacher and were biddable, wanting to do the right thing and to make her happy. This was reinforced by some 
of the discussion points raised by the children, especially when talking about who decided what happens in 
terms of what they learn in class. The children discussed the opportunities they had to decide about things 
that impacted on them. In lesson times they agreed that this was limited as teachers ‘were in charge’. Whilst 
they identified specific lessons or aspects of lessons when they could choose, the consensus was that teachers 
planned and organised what they did. They commented on how as a class sometimes they got to decide 
aspects of how the class was organised or what order they did things in, although this was limited, giving 

 
53 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
examples of voting on a class book to be read and the order in which they completed set tasks throughout the 
day. 
These hesitant examples suggested that children considered that in school they had little choice, or made few 
decisions, this was in contrast to the class teacher and Head Teacher who had confidently elaborated on the 
way classes plan their work and the curriculum. Teachers stated that children were involved in making 
decisions about how project work developed, and how and what children leant. The planning board was 
apparent in every classroom and appeared to be used within the class room where these children were based, 
there were notes, lists, questions and illustrations that implied aspects of the learning were mutually agreed. 
However the children presented a different perspective. In an attempt to explore this further I asked the 
children about the board and at this point the conversation seemed to close down. Children explained that the 
board was from last term and hadn’t been used for a long time. Similarly when discussing the newly 
established school council children were not sure what it did or how it worked, with one child commenting 
that it was always the same children who got chosen ‘’to do those sort of things’’. 
As I listened and transcribed their responses and discussions I knew I was already deliberating as to how I 
could represent these outcomes effectively and sensitively as I became acutely aware that the children’s 
perception of how things were was very different to their teachers. 
Having completed interviews with the children I interviewed both the Head Teacher and the Class teacher to 
explore their position in terms of how the school promoted children rights and empowered them to make 
decisions that impacted on them. Finding and agreeing a time to fit in with school life proved difficult, however 
the class teacher was able to spend some time with me a couple of weeks later. She identified that the School 
Council had impacted positively, that children were happy to attend and contribute, and that parents too had 
acknowledged how effective this was. She commented that it was interesting that the children who were 
voted on by their peers in her class both had parents who sat on the governing body and that this in her 
experience meant that they had a good understanding of how committees worked and how the decisions in 
communities were made. When asked for examples of how the school promoted children’s right to 
participation she confidently outlined the rationale behind the planning board and how this helped her to 
develop a curriculum based on children interests and needs. Her conclusion was that promoting children’s 
rights was not only her responsibility as a teacher but as an adult and went on to explain how she had 
managed this with regards to her own children in her role as a parent. 
When asked about the school council she outlined some of the initiatives that had been developed,  for 
example how the toilets had been renovated in response to the children’s request, and how the council had 
discussed behaviour at playtime and that as a result the school had implemented a system of playground 
buddies. The teacher believed these initiatives showed the children how the school listened to them and how 
children and adults were working together to improve the school community. The interview was cut short as 

 
54 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
the teacher needed to attend a review meeting for a child with SEN, she suggested it would be good to reflect 
on the report when it was done. By the end of the interview, such as it was, I was already wondering how I 
could present the views, attitudes and beliefs of the children which even at this stage seemed to contradict the 
perceptions of the adult. I wondered about the impact this would have on the professional relationship we had 
and how the class teacher would respond to the findings. 
Having abruptly finished the interview I went to find the Head Teacher, who was in another meeting. I emailed 
her that night to thank her for the chance to carry out the series of sessions and briefly summarised the 
activities and data collected. I suggested that we schedule a date to interview her and offered to forward some 
interview questions so she could have time to prepare. Two weeks later I had not had a response so decided to 
call the school. When I was eventually able to speak to the Head Teacher she apologised that she had 
forgotten the project was not quite finished and that she had also forgotten the request to interview her. We 
scheduled a meeting to do this for the following week. It was now near the end of the term and 12 weeks since 
my first visit to gather data. The Head Teacher always appeared busy, corridor conversations were had each 
time I was at the school but it was becoming increasingly difficult to agree a time when an interview could be 
carried out. On the day in question the first comment made by the Head Teacher was that the interview 
needed “to be quite short if that was OK?”, as there was an important case conference to attend. I questioned 
whether this was the right time to go ahead but she assured me that every day was busy and that we 
“probably just needed to grab time when it was available”. Again I found myself feeling irritated that the 
importance of the interview as part of the research process was being undermined. Of course I was not 
questioning the significance of the case conference nor the emotional impact of preparing for such a meeting, 
clearly schools are not just about education for children and the commitment to parents and families, like my 
own, was tangible in the school. However I found myself questioning whether the Head Teacher had 
professional respect for me or indeed valued my research.  
I started to interview the Head Teacher in terms of her beliefs about how the school promoted children’s right 
to participation and she explained the main strategies of both school, and eco, council and how the 
playground buddies and the refurbishment of the toilets had happened as a direct result of the school council 
meetings at the children’s request. She commented that at her appointment, two years previously, the school 
had some challenges to overcome in terms of children’s behaviour and consistency of approaches used by 
staff. This had been a priority following previous OFSTED inspections and in addition to this as a Head of a 
Church of England school she felt there was a need to prioritise “developing a sense of community” and 
“putting systems in place to support children taking responsibility for their behaviour”. When asked how staff 
promoted children’s rights in the classroom she explained that at first some staff found it hard to work with 
this in mind but her senior staff were keen to promote this and had done exceptional work – this included the 
class teacher I had worked with. She identified the way the class teacher had involved children in planning the 

 
55 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
curriculum and how they had been consulted about which charity to support during a fund raising initiative at 
Christmas. She then asked me how I had got on in exploring the children’s understanding of rights and their 
evaluation of the schools council. Being put on the spot I was not really that well prepared to give detailed 
verbal responses knowing that some of my initial findings may well challenge her perception of the school’s 
community, and furthermore that the children’s perceptions contradicted her beliefs, or at least the ones she 
shared with me at this point. 
I tried to briefly give some idea of my findings stating that the questionnaires showed children knew of and 
were very positive about the School Council and that when discussing this in class children were able to give 
examples of how the councils worked and what was involved, but that during the focus interviews they 
expressed different opinions. I explained that the questionnaires and focus group interviews demonstrated 
that the children liked, and felt supported by, their teachers. However there were some less positive 
comments about other adults who worked in the school, and that they felt they were not always listened to 
when outside or at dinner time. I went on to explain that I had not as yet completed the full analysis but that I 
would do so and produce this in a report as requested and that hopefully this would be of use to her and 
would be of interest to Governors, and inspectors be it either OFSTED or Diocesan. The Head Teacher again cut 
the session short, continuing to talk whilst she collected her things ready to leave for the case conference. Her 
parting comment was: 
 
“I bet I could guess who you had in the focus groups, you don’t need to tell me but if I said 
 
some names I bet they would the ones who were more negative”. 
Leaving the school and mulling over what I now know was a significant moment in the research, a number of 
questions surfaced as I reflected on this interview; firstly what did the Head Teacher understand about the 
purpose of research? Where did the idea of research fit on her agenda of priorities? What professional identity 
did she give me, was I a teacher or an academic, a researcher or a partner in terms of training teachers? What 
was her rationale in agreeing to be host for the pilot project? Most importantly I wondered what did the ‘you 
don’t need to tell me’ comment meant. Was there really a desire to know which children had made the 
comments that contradicted her perceptions of the school community, and was there an expectation that I 
would say who those children were?

2.4.1 Reflecting on Pilot Study 1 – First encounters? 
 
The pilot study promoted a careful reconsideration of how I had planned the research. 
The purpose of any pilot study is to test and review research tools and approaches, 
(Bryman 2015, Cohen, Mannion and Morrison 2017), which was at the forefront of my 
mind as I worked with the groups of children gathering data. At a surface level, based 
on my own reflections and the children’s evaluations, some research tools were more 
successful than other. Minor tweaks to the questionnaires needed to be made, 
however the drawing and writing activity enabled children of all abilities to participate 
in the research. The Who Decides activity and the Decisions Pyramid were engaging 
for children to use and created prompts for some probing of their ideas, views and 
beliefs. Some children used the flip cams with varying degrees of success.  There was 
a tendency for children to role play journalist and news reporter and the excitement of 
the tools seemed to detract from the data they captured, (Waller and Bitou 2011).  
 
However the outcome of the pilot went beyond a trial for the research tools. Despite 
requesting otherwise, the experience of carrying this research out in a formal 
classroom environment reinforced my original position in that this was not the most 
effective environment. I reflected on the data gathered and how the children 
responded throughout the whole project. How children interacted with me, initially as 
a researcher and then as a teacher, and how I was perceived to be an integral part of 
Golden Time urged me to consider exploring again the opportunity of developing a 
Research Club. I acknowledged that the process of participating in research first as 
an experiential approach was important to support the children’s understanding of 

 
57 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
research but the limitations of time and access to children as part of a school day 
meant that a series of sessions to explore these skills and consider how children could 
plan their own research would be more effective if this was outside the of the normal 
school day. Above all though I felt that the children needed to be further away from 
their teachers and the formalities of a school environment in order to have an 
environment that was more open. When considering this I also felt that the existing 
relationship I had with the school, based on training teachers, reinforced my identity 
as a teacher and not as a researcher, not least as the field work was carried out during 
school time.   
 
Becoming familiar with Peshkin (1988) who promotes the notion of intrinsic subjective 
I’s enables a greater understanding of the phenomenon I experienced during this first 
pilot study and allows the interconnectivity of the subject and the self to be better 
understood. In Peshkin’s model it is not only essential to acknowledge the idea of 
subjectivity but moreover, researchers should throughout the research process 
‘systematically identify their subjectivity’ (Peshkin 1988:17). By adopting such a model 
I can recognise the following intrinsic I’s that have influenced my approach to, and 
reflection of, this first pilot study (Savage 2007).  Table i (based on Savage 2007) 
summarises my intrinsic I’s and attempts to suggest where the foundations of those 
views, values and beliefs can be found, and then where in the Story of Pilot Study 1 
these subjectivities can be seen. I have identified The Teacher I, The Academic I, The 
Novice Researcher I, The Parent I and The Advocate I.

points to how and why I took the research into another direction, returning to my

original idea of developing a Children’s Research Club. The story to follow explores 
this second pilot study through the same style, voice, reflexive approach and narrative 
emersion in the moments of ‘Research Club’. 
 
2.5 The Story of Pilot Study 2 – Research Club 
 
The Story of Pilot Study 2 – Research Club 
When planning the Research Club I reviewed the responses given by gatekeepers at the initial point of contact. 
In reality the only school that had agreed for me to carry out the research was one where I already had a 
relationship, albeit a relationship based on a specific professional role. Eager to move forward and wondering 
about the impact of relationships I decided to contact another school where I had a positive relationship; this 
time both professional and personal. My own children had attended the school, although had left ten years 
previously, I had also been a governor there and knew the Head Teacher, a fellow parishioner.  I had also, 
whilst a governor, done some professional development for teachers in the Early Years department and had 
been a Link Tutor for a small number of teacher trainees as part of my current academic role. I contacted the 
Head Teacher by email attaching the same Information Sheet summarising the project, my CV – demonstrating 
previous experience and professional skills and a letter of introduction clarifying intentions and promoting 
benefits of the project. I arranged to meet to discuss the project, this time round I wanted to ensure there were 
no misunderstandings in terms of the organisation and environment for the field work. 
This time the Head Teacher replied to my email within 48 hours and suggested I ring school to speak to the 
secretary to arrange a convenient time to meet. I did this the following day and set up a meeting. As with the 
setting for pilot study 1, I was greeted warmly and offered refreshments, other staff I knew stopped in the 
corridor and exchanged greetings and the Head Teacher gave a brief summary as to why I was there. I 
explained the way I wanted to work, the Head teacher was enthusiastic, keen to support and welcomed the 
fact that one benefit  would be an after school club that may meet the interests of those children who were not 
particularly interested in sports or dancing. He explained that children in Yr 3 would be best suited for this as 
other children were transferring to new schools and if we wanted to continue to the following term they would 
no longer be at the school. As I talked about my understanding of the power play between teachers and 
children and how I wanted to reduce this he appeared to understand my perspective  and said it was not a 
problem in terms of what children called me, acknowledging that coaches at the school and parents who ran 
arts clubs were called by their first names. He asked if there were any resources school could provide and 

 
61 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
agreed to support the project by talking about it in assembly and by giving out and collecting the leaflets and 
parental consent letters. The Head teacher asked me to talk more about the doctoral study, including the 
processes.  He seemed genuinely interested and commented that he could not imagine undertaking such a 
piece of research with a job as well. He talked about the ethos of the school how they promoted inclusion and 
how as a faith-based community children were at the heart of the school. From his perspective it would be 
interesting to find out what the children thought about their rights at school and this would give the staff a 
different way of assessing the effectiveness of what they did and how they could improve and better respond to 
the children’s needs and rights. 
The Research Club was planned to coincide with a range of other after school clubs, in total 12 children 
expressed an interest in taking part. One child who was only 6 asked to join in, I knew the family from Church 
and was initially reluctant as the challenges of developing materials across this age group I thought would be 
problematic. The parent requested that her younger son stayed as this would support the family in organising 
after school care. This in itself led to consideration of consent and assent when involving young children as 
participants, whilst initially I felt confident children were choosing to participate or not, in reality the parents 
essentially were making key decisions, this theme became very important later on during one of the sessions. 
Once consent from the gatekeeper was granted parents also had to give consent for their children to 
participate, not least as the children would be staying for a club after school and arrangements for getting 
home had to be confirmed. Letters were distributed to both children and parents and prepared with 
appropriate language, both children and parents had to indicate agreement through the use of signatures. The 
children were excited about practising their signatures and seemed to take the idea of giving their permission 
very seriously with one child commenting: 
‘You know this is a contract Rose, we’ve both agreed now’. (Noah Aged 8) 
Having on previous occasions included children as participants and practised what I believed an ethical 
approach to this I felt confident that the children were making choices and were empowered to withdraw their 
consent at any point. I ensured I included opportunities to say they had changed minds during all activities and 
each session, I used language such ‘Are you happy to….?’ When explaining the activities, I sought their 
agreement in how the sessions were organised, I promoted opportunities for choice in the range of resources I 
used and games we could play.  At the end of each session I made sure I thanked the children for their ideas 
and involvement and emphasised that it would be good to see them again next week if they were happy to 
come back and do some more. In short I believed I had a clear understanding as to the rights of these children 
to participate in the project as a whole and in each session and each activity. I had in my mind played out the 
scenario of one child saying they did not want to do it any more, however I had not considered the scenario of a 
parent who wanted the child to participate and the child himself did not. When this happened I struggled to 
come to terms with the outcome for some while.

One child, a very quiet reserved boy had happily joined in for four sessions, on the fifth session he came into the 
room crying and upset saying he didn’t want to stay. I explained that this was fine and that we could sort it out, 
that he had a choice and it was fine to change his mind. I knew that his parent was on the premises as I had 
talked to her earlier and she had commented how happy he was with Research Club and that this was the first 
time he had ever had a club that appealed to him, I felt, to say the least, thrilled at this, which made my own 
disappointment all the more apparent when he arrived upset saying he didn’t want to stay. Nevertheless it was 
important for me to recognise his right to withdraw. We found his parent and I explained how unhappy he was 
and that of course it was fine that he had changed his mind. I was uncomfortable as the parent then tried to 
dissuade her son and almost seemed cross that he didn’t want to stay. I confidently explained it was fine with 
me and he was entitled to change his mind.  She somewhat knowingly looked at her child and said ‘It’s because 
I’m here setting up for film club’. She went on to explain that the PTA had arranged a film club for that night 
and that she was setting up, she had already had the conversation with her son about whether he wanted to do 
Research Club or film club and he had confidently stated he wanted to attend Research Club. She took her child 
away saying they would have a chat and he would be back in few minutes. As I returned to the room the other 
children had arrived and I felt distracted by my concerns about this child being coerced into attending. I was 
unsure how to handle this situation, not wanting to overrule either the parent or the child in terms of ethics and 
informed consent. As we prepared the material for the session he returned with his parent, and a plate of 
chocolate biscuits. The parent went onto explain that usually at film club he helps her to prepare the snacks for 
the children and in particular to make tea for the adults. He had now done this chore and wanted to return to 
Research Club. When reflecting on this later I recalled the work of Lewis (2010) who explored ‘Silence’ in the 
Voice of the Child, and how for very young children, and those with disabilities, there is the need for a key 
person who knows the child best of all to give consent, and that the intensity and honesty of a trusting 
relationship can ensure that the child is able to participate when it is in his best interest. I reflected that the 
parent knew the child better than I did and although initially it seemed he was withdrawing consent his parent 
recognised that this was not in his best interest, understanding his need to complete another favourite routine 
which would then put him in the right state of mind to join in Research Club. Whilst the significance and 
emphasis on children giving consent has dominated research with, and indeed on, children over the last 
decade, this incident challenged me enough to ponder on whether or not applying adult ethical protocols to 
young children is indeed in their interest and whether we need to revisit this aspect of research with children. 
The children attended a total of 9 sessions, each lasting 75 mins. In each case we explored aspects of research 
and research methods in practical, and I hoped, interesting ways. For example considering ethics by discussion 
and responding to scenarios, ‘what would you do if?’; the initial stimulus being the sharing and eating  
‘Fairtrade’ chocolate to consider the children’s existing understanding of ethics and eventually moving on to 
privacy and confidentiality. Scenarios about what to do if you knew your friend was being hurt by someone 
helped to explore the complexities of disclosure. The idea of changing your mind and that being OK was an 

 
63 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
important factor for this young group of researchers. I had wondered how they would respond to an 
exploration of ethics and fairness initially thinking this would be challenging, although the experience was the 
opposite. Later I considered whether as the children were part of a faith-community, that frequently and openly 
discussed relationships and attitudes to others, if this was not such a hard concept for them after all. The 
children’s community spirit and perhaps ability to see justice and fairness as an integral part of their social and 
spiritual lives meant they had a clear approach to involving others in their research. A sensitivity towards the 
teachers who they respected and genuinely liked was very apparent as the children discussed what they would 
do in sharing any negative data gathered though their interviews and questionnaires, importantly though as 
this dialogue illustrates the children were able to demonstrate an ethical approach to the research process. 
‘But if it’s what they say you have to tell everyone, otherwise your research is not true, you can’t lie about it, 
but you could make sure you don’t say it in a nasty way’, (Luc aged 8). 
Using a range of ways to record responses to questionnaires and interviews, for example flip-cams as well as 
‘special’ stationery chosen deliberately to inspire and interest the young researchers proved to be successful. 
Whilst others (Gallacher and Gallagher 2008) have warned against the over use of technology in gathering 
data from young children in this case the overwhelming desire from the children wasn’t necessarily to use the 
technology itself but rather the importance to be seen to be doing ‘grown-up’ things. Clip boards, note pads, 
box-files and a variety of pens and markers were all important. Developing the skills to be able to complete a 
piece of research was my objective, I drew on the work of Kellett (2005) and Bucknall (2012); more importantly 
though, we played games with playing cards trying to work out what cards were missing and how patterns 
suddenly became apparent to illustrate and practice analytical skills, we were detectives looking closely at 
scenes of crime to be able to look for clues and make connections between events. We developed interview 
techniques by role-playing journalists asking probing open ended questions to find out what people thought. 
Later as researchers we planned and organised how we could find out about key areas of the children’s lives. 
All the way through children remained on first name terms with me, correcting themselves when they called me 
‘Mrs Rose’. Soon I became Rosie, which was not how I introduced myself, and in itself this created a different 
professional identity that of the researcher. One child in particular wanted to explore my professional role, 
often asking questions about my job, what happened at university and repeatedly trying to work out what was 
the difference between being a teacher in school and being a teacher at university. One key moment in our 
relationship was when she suggested that: ‘University teachers do more asking then school teachers who do 
more telling’.  
Initially the children found it hard to understand the concept of social research. As part of their everyday 
curriculum activities research meant looking things up in books or using the internet to find out more. As we 
explored this further and moved away from research being about pirates or inventions one child, Noah (aged 7) 
exclaimed:  

 
64 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
‘I get it, research is like this, it’s re – do it again, and search - looking for something, so research is looking again 
at something you hadn’t really noticed in the first place’ 
This moment of understanding was a turning point for the whole club and process. By this time children had 
created a group identity, a club to belong to, they had designed a logo which I had had made into badges. They 
had agreed some rules following the first session when arguments occurred over using resources. I naively 
thought that I would not have to go into teacher mode at all. In a similar way to the first pilot study I soon 
realised that this was inevitable, although this time round there was less tension as I moved from researcher to 
teacher mode. I emphasised it was about me helping them to have a good time and that in the same way as 
there are rules when you play a game with your friends perhaps we needed some rules to make sure everyone 
had a go at the activity, and everyone enjoyed it, so they would come back next time. In Research Club 
establishing rules in terms of behaviour and expectations was not because I felt under professional scrutiny, but 
because I needed to support each researcher in completing their tasks so as to have a sense of satisfaction and 
successful outcome. Although later I realised it was more about wanting to help everyone get on and to enjoy 
being together sharing a common goal. As a researcher researching the children’s journey of discovery I 
enjoyed both working with them, and their company, and recognised that I was making a conscious decision 
that I didn’t want to have to become the teacher, which I felt would change our working relationship. The 
emotive engagement and attachment with the children was in itself motivation to try and resolve any falling 
out; essentially it felt better to work together without any unfriendliness. Relationships were key to the success 
of the research club, as the children got to know me they became relaxed, asked if they could organise the 
equipment, tidied up without being cajoled, I felt confident in allowing them to retrieve stationery from my 
bag, they supported me when having an issue with setting up a lap top. The ethos of the working group was 
such that I didn’t feel like their teacher, although I was teaching them; it felt we were learning things together 
in a mutually respectful environment. My own confidence in working with them in this way was in complete 
contrast to the first pilot study.  
As the end of term approached it became clear that as a group of researchers we were not going to be able to 
meet the deadline to be able to complete and present findings, as with my own research the time required and 
the complexity of establishing interviews, collecting data and analysing was proving to be difficult. Whilst the 
Head Teacher was fully supportive, as were some staff, the external pressures of School Improvement Plans 
and, for this school recruitment of a new Head Teacher, as well as the inevitable Sports Days, trips and 
residential meant that the children as researchers were experiencing the emotions, stresses and frustrations 
many researchers in academia do in only being able to snatch time and moments to make progress.  
In order to give the children something more tangible to aim for I negotiated and was able to invite them to 
attend my Faculty research conference, in order to present their findings to date and to give an overview of the 
research process. As a PhD student presenting at such conference was expected and encouraged, I presented 

 
65 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
my own findings in terms of Children-as-Researchers and in order to give these young researchers the chance to 
present as researchers in their own right ensured they were included in the programme. The children discussed 
how they wanted to do this and very quickly and naturally established that they wanted to prepare a short 
presentation about their experience, I suggested too that they might like to invite and respond to questions 
from the people who attended.  Initially the children were less keen on the idea of answering questions and 
were concerned that there would be ‘important university people’ there, when I reassured them and said that 
this was just my friends who were also doing research like them and were going to tell everyone about their 
research, they became more confident.  
‘It’s other research clubs like ours then, but just grown-up researchers’ (Will, aged 6). 
The Head Teacher was very enthusiastic about this and arranged for members of staff and a parent to attend 
and to transport the children. We arranged some additional Research Club sessions, during lunch break and on 
one afternoon when the children were able to come out of lessons to prepare their presentation. I wondered 
how they would feel about the process, in their minds it was like doing an assembly, they were used to speaking 
with adults and giving reviews of progress, and two of the group had very recently prepared and given a 
presentation to the School Governors about school uniform changes. Their approach was simple; to create a 
PowerPoint presentation that recorded their journey so far. I knew that colleagues would be supportive as most 
had worked previously with young children as teachers in schools, but I was less sure about the attitudes and 
approaches of other academics who were not familiar with the work of the School of Education. At the heart of 
this next experience was the idea to validate, and celebrate the children’s research, their emotions and 
learning. The presentation was for the children the highlight of their experience, in evaluating the research club 
and the conference experience children commented that: 
‘Everything about research is new, new words and new things you find out’ (Mikey, aged 8) 
‘They all clapped at the end, and you could see people smiling, I think they liked it, I wasn’t nervous in the end, 
they all are doing research too like us’ (Hannah Aged 8) 
 
 
2.5.1 Reflecting on Pilot Study 2 – More Encounters. 
 
Adopting a reflexive approach to Pilot Study 2 enabled emerging ideas to come to the 
foreground and I started to make connections with my own research experience. The 
quality of the relationships as a group of researchers at Research Club resonated with 

 
66 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
the intensity of relationships when working as adults on a project. Repeatedly my 
thoughts went back to the place of relationships in terms of gatekeepers and in 
establishing consent from stakeholders, not just the participant themselves.  In this 
second pilot study an existing relationship proved the key to unlock that gate, personal 
and professional trust seem to be the triggers here. At no time during the second study 
did I feel I had to revert to my ‘teacher’ identity. Here my role was as a researcher, 
(Rosie), and although undoubtedly I had clear objectives, I assessed and planned 
specific learning opportunities and experiences to support the young researches in 
developing their skills, I remained firmly grounded as a researcher and not a ‘teacher’. 
The effectiveness of the whole experience was clearly dependent on my professional 
understanding and a skills-set developed over a period of time as a Primary and Early 
Years teacher, however the role I took did not adopt the language, the positional 
authority nor the tensions within a teacher and pupil relationship.  Trying to identify my 
intrinsic I’s during this second pilot study, and understanding the foundation of those 
subjectivities enables a more critical understanding of my behaviour and decision 
making process – all of which gradually shifted from conventional to post as I became 
more immersed in understanding my ontological view of the world. These are 
summarised in Table ii - My Intrinsic I’s – Pilot Study 2.

Teacher I
‘I also drew on my professional knowledge of child development, pedagogy and 
curriculum content to be able to plan age appropriate and stimulating practical 
play-based experiences, making connections with the children’s lived 
experience...’ 
Academic I
‘…done some professional development for teachers in the Early Years 
department and had been a Link Tutor for a small number of teacher trainees as 
part of my current academic role...’ 
Novice-
Researcher I 
‘I was unsure how to handle this situation, not wanting to overrule either the 
parent or the child in terms of ethics and informed consent.’ 
Advocate I
‘Having on previous occasions included children as participants and practiced 
what I believed an ethical approach to this I felt confident that the children were 
making choices and were empowered to withdrawn their consent at any point.’ 
‘I presented my own findings in terms of Children-as-Researchers and in order to 
give these young researchers the chance to present as researchers in their own 
right ensured they were included in the programme’. 
Parent I
‘My own children had attended the school, although had left ten years 
previously, I had also been a governor there and knew the Head Teacher.’ 
 
‘He asked if there were any resources school could provide and agreed to 
support the project by talking about it in assembly and by giving out and 
collecting the leaflets and parental consent letters’. 
‘The parent requested that her younger son stayed as this would support the 
family in organising after school care. This in itself led to consideration of 
consent and assent when involving young children as participants, whilst 
initially I felt confident children were choosing to participate or not, parents 
essentially were making key decisions’. 
 
 
The place of professional identity and how researchers are viewed by the non-
academic world was/is a question that I recognised I would return to as a thread 
running throughout the thesis. The Research Club enabled me to focus on the 
research tools and approaches and I was now in a position to be able to use these 
experiences to share with other gatekeepers in order to repeat the Research Club and 
take this to the next stage whereby children would be leading the research with their 
peers as research participants, as outlined in my original proposal. The niggling 

 
68 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
thought at the back of my mind kept drawing me back to the very different experiences 
in the two pilot studies. How and why did teachers have such different views of 
research, and indeed Children-as-Researchers? Reflecting on the two experiences I 
recognised that to be successful in my endeavours I would need to work with schools 
and senior staff who viewed children as I did, and who would welcome the idea of 
research being undertaken in their schools.   
 
2.6 Branching out – searching for participants. 
 
Re-energised by the second pilot study I arranged to meet with the newly appointed 
Head Teacher of the school that hosted pilot study 2. At the same time, I made contact 
with schools I had personal and professional relationships with, confident that 
somewhere there would be a partner school who would be willing and able to 
participate. I was still motivated with the idea of children generating and carrying out 
social research with their peers as participants, confident that by sharing the outcomes 
of the second pilot study I would be able to carry out the research as planned in my 
proposal which would enable me to answer my initial question: 
How might young children be active participants in researching their own 
educational lives? 
 
Now with the evidence of a successful Research Club to share and promote 
discussion, whilst being prepared for the challenge of gaining access and organising 
the club, I found myself (initially) overwhelmed by the lack of interest and engagement 

 
69 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
from the schools I contacted. The lowest point came when the newly appointed Head 
Teacher of the school that hosted the second pilot study contacted me to say the 
school would not be continuing with the Research Club. I pondered on the place of 
relationships again, and tried to make sense of school and teachers’ perspectives, all 
the time becoming more curious about the barriers to carrying out Children-as-
Researcher projects and noticing the increasing silence, the nothingness in terms of 
responses, involvement, curiosity and interest from my colleagues in schools. I 
referred to this as an ‘empty data –set’. 
 
2.7 Repositioning – ‘Begin-Again’. 
 
Having taken 18 months to compete the pilots outlined here and feeling at a sense of 
loss and sheer confusion, the title here of The Weary Traveller neatly captures my 
thoughts, feelings and emotional position at this time. In my naiveté I assumed that 
whilst acknowledging the inevitable hard work, long nights and challenges of 
undertaking my doctoral study I had completely underestimated the messiness of 
research, and the emotional impact. I found myself at a crossroad trying to identify if 
there was an alternative pathway that I could continue to travel on or if indeed I had 
come to a dead-end. To continue the metaphor of journeys and travelling I was 
refuelled by being introduced to the ideas of Said (1978), and found not only a 
reaffirming of my understanding of the messiness of research but permission to 
understand that what I had experienced was in fact indicative of what Derrida (1994) 
referred to as ‘events’. For me though not a one off event but a ‘series of fortunate 

 
70 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
events’.  The impact of these jolts enabled a deconstruction of the initial questions 
proposed and a recognition of the importance not only of the beginning of the research 
journey, but to ‘begin again’ (Said 1978 in Pryke et al 2003).  Rather than adopting the 
linear approach first considered, the clarity of which I had taken for granted, I found 
myself in a position of not only needing to deconstruct my initial research questions 
but being able to respond to the events that have prompted a rethinking and 
repositioning, and restoration of confidence, as well as a redirecting of where to go 
next.   
 
In the same way that reviewing what is already known and understood about children’s 
voice, and Children-as-Researchers  is my ‘intellectual responsibility’ (Allen 2003:15), 
it is also my intellectual responsibility to recognise  the need to ‘begin again’ and to 
see this process of reflexivity as one that opens up new directions and considerations. 
To ignore the prompts and nudges outlined in this chapter would only result in a closing 
down, a dampening of thought and an awareness and uncomfortableness that the 
initial questions posed were/are no longer ‘ask-able’, as the new questions formed 
result in a completely new way of thinking about things. 
 
This chapter explores how I took the first tentative steps towards a post- qualitative 
position and a deconstruction of my research proposal. The ability at this point to 
confidently state, if indeed this is ever possible, the resulting provocations and my 

 
71 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
ontological stance remained/remains nascent. The nomadic nature of my doctoral 
study continues with the next chapter ‘Dealing with Wanderlust’. 
 

 
72 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 Dealing with Wanderlust 
 
In which the reader ‘sees’ for the first time changes in ‘voice’, and the urge to explore teacher identities 
and perceptions of research in order to make sense of Children-as-Researchers becomes apparent.

3.1 Introduction. 
 
This review of the literature offers a discussion of some of the important issues when 
considering firstly how children might be active participants in researching their own 
educational lives and secondly, how children’s participation within educational 
research is understood by stakeholders. 
 
The shifting sands of this exploration has impacted on my own position with regard to, 
and understanding of, my initial research aims and subsequent re-presenting of 
provocations which called for an exploratory approach. With this in mind the review(s) 
of literature presented here include  pre and post perspectives through which I aim to 
not only provide an overview of existing literature but to also provide and clarify the 
springboard from which the final investigation came, and in doing so  validate the 
provocations, methodological stance and approaches taken throughout the study. 
 
3.2 Purpose and Intent. 
 
A literature review is, according to Creswell (2009), “a written summary of journal 
articles, books, and other documents that describe the past and current state of 
information; organizes the literature into topics; and documents a need for a proposed 
study." (p. 89). Others define the purpose of the literature review to be demonstrating 
a gap in the existing field of knowledge, justifying questions posed by the research 
and demonstrating a wide and deep understanding of contemporary perspectives.  
Indeed in the professional context of a supervisor of undergraduate researchers this 

 
74 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
would be the position I would adopt with students (Roberts-Holmes 2018, Bell 2014, 
and Creswell 2009). This approach and intention was clear as I embarked on the 
project. However, having reviewed my own progress on this journey of discovery, I 
found the cyclical nature of reading, summarising and critiquing literature, with a 
conventional systematic approach, created a growing awareness not just of emerging 
themes but of the interconnectivity between thoughts and realisations which 
challenged me, both in completing the review and presenting the review. In itself 
indicative of my ontological turn, requiring a different approach. 
 
I acknowledge the influences of Walker (2015) who promotes a more interpretivist 
approach rather than a conventional systematic approach to this literature review. By 
adopting this position I am able to contextualise my post-qualitative stance and to 
acknowledge the rhizomatic features of thinking that have evolved as part of my 
journey outlined in the previous chapter. Barges (2006) cited by Walker (2015: 1) 
explains ‘that everything impacts on everything else’. With this in mind and by adopting 
a creative thinking approach promoting dialogue and interaction between what is 
already known, I present my review of literature as a series of conversations and 
interactions. This systemic approach is one that enables me to demonstrate the 
changes in my methodological stance. In taking this approach, I recognise that in itself 
a review of literature is part of the blurring of methodologies adopted in my research.  
 
 Montuori (2005) promotes a creative inquiry approach to reviewing literature and 
considers that the primary aim of the review itself is to position the researcher, 
illuminating biographical aspects, and in doing so should aim to not only demonstrate 

 
75 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
where the reviewer is situated within the community of writers, but to also enable the 
reviewer to express who she is with regard to her disciplinary field and focus of 
research. Montuori likens the literature review to a map which traces the terrain ‘but is 
not the terrain itself’ (2005:3). Drawing upon this analogy I offer this review to not only 
inhabit the terrain but to demonstrate how the journey of critical systemic thinking 
forced me to take a different route through/across it and how  in doing so I discovered 
new unfamiliar, unexplored places before finding my way home safely. 
 
3.3 Presenting, Representing and Re-Presenting the Literature. 
 
In order to reiterate the paradigm shift this review of literature will form two sections 
pre and post pilot study. The previous chapter, The Weary Traveller, discussed the 
significance of the pilot study and how it was/is interpreted as an event (Derrida 1994, 
Zizek 2014). The jolting effect of the pilot study not only necessitated a repositioning 
of the research questions, but also influenced my approach to the presenting, 
representing and re-presenting of this literature review. In the first, pre-pilot study 
section, a thematic approach was taken to initially examine contemporary 
understandings of children’s participation, its origins and place in society. The 
following sections then examine the concept of children’s voice and how this is 
considered in contemporary practice, subsequently the issue of empowerment and 
relationships in research are analysed. Finally children as active participants in 
research is considered. 
 

 
76 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
In recognition of the pilot study event (Derrida 1994, Zizek 2014), a further layer of 
literature will be presented. This demonstrates the opening up of thought; this is not 
simply a reflection but demonstrates the transformation of my position, and the 
subsequent realisation of the newness of understanding this transformation 
encounters.  In this post event review I move on to examine and reconsider literature 
that concerns professional identity, silence in voice, relationships and adult roles in 
children rights, and lastly children’s methodologies. 
 
The move towards children becoming researchers in their own right sets into motion 
the need to explore and examine a related complex set of concepts, issues and 
influences. These will now be examined from the perspective of looking towards the 
pilot study and then from the perspective of having completed the pilot study. The 
review of literature will conclude by demonstrating not only how the themes discussed 
are interlinked but also the ‘relatedness of everything’ and in doing so is ‘both systemic, 
as in the relational sense of connectivity, and dialogical as in the conversational sense’ 
(Walker 2015: 3). 
 
3.4 Children’s Participation. 
 
The quantity of research which focuses on children’s participation is acknowledged to 
be plentiful (Lundy 2007, Ruck and Horn 2008, Reynaert et al 2009, Payne 2009). As 
the development of the sociology of childhood continues to gather momentum and be 
recognised as a discipline worthy of research in its own right, the impact of children’s 
right to participation has been explored across many disciplines thus demonstrating 

 
77 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
the scope of the research to date. Whilst some authors explore the concept of 
children’s right to participation within the judicial system, focussing on child protection 
(Woolfson et al 2010), family law and residency (Lyon 2007, Harris-Short 2010) and 
youth justice (Broeking and Peterson-Badali 2010), other disciplines for example 
medicine and nursing are also exploring children’s participation in decision making 
processes whilst in hospital (Lowden 2002, Runeson et al 2002). These explorations 
are mirrored within home settings (Ruck et al 2002,) both with disabled children 
(Radermacher et al 2010), and able-bodied children (Peterson-Badali and Ruck 2008). 
Children’s right to participation in decisions about service development within the wider 
community have also contributed to the complexity of available research in Childhood 
Studies, (Alparone and Rissotto 2001, Tonucci and Rissotto 2001, Cavet and Sloper 
2004). However since the focus of this review is children’s right to participation in 
education they will not be reviewed in any detail and only referred to when appropriate.  
 
The definition of ‘participation’ is an essential task to undertake before progressing 
further. Most researchers and commentators identify Article 12 (UNCRC 1989), as 
epitomising the child’s ‘Right to Participation’ (Morrow 1999, Smith 2007, Reynaert et 
al 2009, Bae 2010). However Article 12 does not in itself use the word participation, 
rather it states that; 
State parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her 
own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting 
the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with 
the age and maturity of the child...for this purpose, the child shall in 
particular, be provided with the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and 
administrative procedures affecting the child (Article 12). 

 
78 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
This omission of a key term from the actual wording of the UNCRC has, according to 
a number of commentators, led to a misunderstanding of the concept and 
subsequently a need to more fully explore the interpretation of ‘participation’ rather 
than continuing to evaluate the implementation of the UNCRC (Peterson-Badali and 
Ruck 2008, Ruck and Horn 2008, Payne 2009). However Krappmann (2010) 
emphasises that although Article 12 is often referred to as a child’s right to 
participation, this right is in itself an over-arching theme of the convention and that this 
is acknowledged in Article 43. Others claim that Article 12 cannot be explored in 
isolation at all. For example, when considering children’s right to participation in Early 
Years settings in Norway, Bae (2010) argues that for our youngest children the right 
to play, Article 31, together with the right to freedom of expression, Article 13, need to 
be acknowledged when implementing children’s right to participation, thereby 
emphasising a holistic approach. The holistic approach adopted by Bae (2010) could 
be argued to be strongly influenced by her background in Early Years. Effective Early 
Years pedagogy also recognises the importance of play as a tool for learning (Bruce 
et al 2017), and this may also account for Bae’s position. 
 
A clear understanding of what children’s right to participation looks like, whether in 
relation to research, which will be discussed later, or in their wider lives, is hard to find, 
although there is agreement that there are two aspects of participation.  Firstly the idea 
of ‘taking part in’ and secondly ‘knowing that one’s actions are taken note of and may 
be acted upon’ (Boyden and Ennew 1997 in Morrow 1999:149).  Thomas (2007:199) 
seeks to clarify this further by defining participation as ‘taking part in decision –making’, 
and attempts to offer a theoretical framework for understanding the concept. Whereas 

 
79 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Thomas (2007), in exploring what this process looks like, concludes it is about 
collective decision making, Bae (2010: 209) notes that practitioners in her research 
tended to interpret participation in terms of ‘self-determination and individual-choice’. 
Bae’s research attempts to clarify a definition of participation by consulting 
practitioners’ perspectives and this is achieved through analysis of empirical data 
gathered using a wide range of qualitative approaches, including ethnographic 
investigations and interviews. Thomas (2007) attempts to offer a theoretical framework 
by critiquing other typologies of participation and considers the political and social 
contexts, concluding that it would be ‘premature’ to proffer a theory of participation, 
rather he identifies key ‘components of such a theory’ (Thomas 2007: 215). Both these 
studies offer different starting and finishing points, however, both emphasise the need 
to revisit definitions in order to gain deeper understanding and perspectives, and whilst 
neither are able to offer a definitive position, their respective  arguments  fuel the 
debate.  
 
Research that goes beyond interpretation and understanding of children’s right to 
participation, be it in relation to research or in their wider lives, is limited. Those studies 
that do, consider perceptions of children’s rights, the complexity of the issues involved, 
and the debate between children’s rights and adult’s nurturance.  There is a 
dominance in the literature of adults’ perceptions of children rights, and the majority of 
this research is fixed within the quantitative research paradigm. This is a concern 
raised specifically by Peterson-Baldali & Ruck (2008), and Ruck & Horn (2008) who 
argue that rather than knowing how adults define children rights and how many young 
people understood their rights in relation to youth justice protocols further research is 

 
80 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
essential to understand how children’s rights can be implemented in all aspects of their 
lives. Meanwhile, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) which regularly 
reviews responses of member states to UNCRC identified that in the UK there was a 
lack of ‘Children’s Voice’ within the field of education (UN Committee on the Rights of 
the Child 1995). Later the 49th Sessional report on CRC (UNCRC 2008) identified that 
in terms of education the UK stills needs to:  
 strengthen children’s participation in all matters that affect them; and  
 provide a right of appeal for children who are able to express their views. 
The more recent 72nd Session Report (UNCRC 2016) focussed on child pornography 
and sexual exploitation and legislation relating to children rights, in particular the 
proposed, at the time, replacement of Human Rights Act with a Bill of Rights. The UN 
identified improvements had been made since 2007 when UK was ranked 21st out of 
twenty –one countries in relation to child wellbeing, to 16th in 2013, out of 29 countries. 
In relation to children’s perspectives of their rights, data reported in the 72nd Session 
Report (UNCRC 2016) identified that whilst 93.5% of children in care, or living away 
from home, agreed they had access to the education and health services they needed 
(92.6%), this dropped when asked about their right to participation. Notably:  
the right to say what you really think, as long as this isn’t harmful to other 
people (76.9 %);  
the right to give your views on anything that affects you, if you are old 
enough  to understand the issue (76.3%);  
the right to have your views taken into account by people making decisions 
about you, if you are old enough to understand the issue (70.6%).  
(UNCRC 2016:5). 
 

 
81 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
This would indicate that, in the UK, whilst children’s basic rights to health and 
education are met, the concept of participation and the child’s right to participation, is 
either not as well understood by children, or is not considered as important a right as 
those concerning health and education. 
Though there is no single universally accepted definition of ‘participation’ which can 
provide an overarching conceptual framework, a useful definition is offered by Hart 
(1992:5) who defined participation as: 
the process of sharing decisions which affect one’s life and the life of the 
community in which one lives. It is the means by which democracy is built 
and it is a standard against which democracies should be measured.  
 
This definition draws attention to a fundamental element of participation, namely 
decision making and to the democratic right of individuals to influence those decisions 
that have an impact on their lives and is the definition accepted for the purposes of 
this proposal. 
 
There are a number of other different ways of conceptualising participation which 
include Hart’s (1992) ‘Ladder of Participation’, Huskins’ (1996) ‘Degrees of 
Participation’, Shier’s (2001) ‘Pathways to Communication’, and Treseder’s (1997) 
‘Categories of Involvement’. Each model attempts to express what participation is and 
how it can be implemented in practice. Hart (1992) in his work offers a hierarchical 
perspective which takes the form of a ladder demonstrating the various levels of 
participation, moving from the first three rungs, (manipulation, decoration and 
tokenism) whereby children are not really participating, to higher levels which show 

 
82 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
children really involved until, when at the very top of the ladder, children are the ones 
who initiate a project. In contrast to this, Treseder (1997) challenges the hierarchical 
conceptualisation by offering a circular model whereby no level of participation is 
assumed to be better, or to work better than another. He acknowledges that the 
different levels of participation may be appropriate for different groups of children at 
different stages in the development of a project and just offers the latter five rungs of 
Hart’s ladder. The descriptive nature of Hart’s model, developed as an explanatory 
devise, is also challenged by Shier (2001) who offers a pathway which can be used to 
assess appropriate levels of participation for a specific task by asking those involved 
what they are prepared to share. Shier’s alternative typology, whilst building on Hart’s 
ladder model, develops the theme of communication and offers a route through the 
five levels of participation. At each stage there are three levels of commitment from 
adults; openings, opportunities and obligations. A further conceptual framework is 
offered by Huskins (1996). Hart’s ladder serves as a ‘beginning typology’ which is 
elaborated on by Huskins (1996). Whereas Hart has early steps on his ‘Ladder’ as 
being non-participatory, Huskins’ first step starts with young people and can be seen 
as a progressive participatory process which supports their developing autonomy. 
What is important in this model is that young people are involved from the start right 
through to the end of a project in order to develop a sense of ownership. An 
appreciation of these conceptual frameworks of participation has undoubtedly 
influenced my initial methodological decisions which are explored in Chapter 4: 
Finding the Way. Whilst not adopting one model over any other, the progressive 
participatory process offered by Huskins reflects the underpinning values of 

 
83 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
emancipatory approaches that I reflected on when examining the pilot study outlined 
in the previous chapter The Weary Traveller. 
 
Decision making, whether individual or collective, is clearly a central aspect of 
participation; furthermore the element that distinguishes participation from 
consultation is the second aspect of Article 12, the right to be heard. This aspect is 
often referred to as ‘voice’ and it has been given increasing attention notably because, 
for some researchers e.g. Lundy (2007), Krappmann 2010), whilst there is a growing 
involvement in children as research participants there is little evidence of  
implementation of outcomes from such research (Bradbury-Jones and Taylor 2015). 
This could be because the emphasis remains on participatory methods rather than an 
examination of ontological questions. Despite this there is a growing number of 
research projects that actively involved children as research participants, and that 
have methodologies designed to enabled children’s voice to be heard, notably Clark 
and Moss’s Mosaic Approach (2001, 2005).  
 
The idea of ‘voice’ and participation are interlinked and defining participation in terms 
of ‘voice’ is equally as complex. Indeed, Rinaldi (2006) refers to the act of participation 
as the pedagogy of listening which allows space for children’s views to be heard and 
has the potential to generate understanding and awareness in educational settings 
and in the wider public arena.  
 
 

 
84 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
3.5 Children’s Voice. 
 
To define the concept of ‘children’s voice’ is problematic, however for the purposes of 
this research it is understood that ‘children’s voice’ relates to the opinions, perceptions, 
values and beliefs held by children, which may or may not be communicated through 
the spoken word. For example, when considering the youngest of children who are 
pre-verbal it is necessary for the adult who is ‘listening’ to the child to tune into body 
language, including facial expressions, as well as their sounds and murmurings. 
However, conclusions drawn from my earlier research, which included children as 
research participants and prioritised listening to their ‘voice’, were that the research 
was still essentially ‘adultist’ as the adult was the main researcher and analyst. The 
positioning of the child in my research, (Lowe 2012), adopted James and Prout’s 
(1990) model of the ‘social-child’. This concept assumes that children are social actors 
in their own world, consequently research tools that reflected children’s everyday 
experiences such as drawing, playing and telling stories were used to collect data. In 
short, my initial research recognised the voice of the child and through carefully 
selected research tools attempted to ‘hear’ that voice. However, the conclusions drawn 
recognised that whilst acknowledging that children are experts in their own lives, the 
power dynamics of the relationship between adults and child in this approach hinders 
their voices being really heard (Kellett 2010).The outcomes of my previous research 
nonetheless stimulated my interest to explore how research ‘with’ and ‘by’ children, 
(Kellett 2010), can be adopted to more effectively enable the voice of the child to be 
heard with clarity.  
 

 
85 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
In terms of the impact of a child’s right to participation there is also an argument that 
challenges how Article 12 (UNCRC 1989) has been implemented by suggesting that 
whilst children are listened to, in reality they are not heard. Krappmann (2010) 
suggests that adults place little value on the opinions of children and that the dominant 
view in society is that children’s views are seen as deserving less respect than adults, 
and furthermore that they are developmentally incapable of forming their own views. 
This dominant position is challenged by Krappmann (2010) who posits the idea that it 
is up to adults to ‘develop sensitivity to children’s ways of communication’ (pg 507).  
In my previous research (Lowe 2012), specific methodologies, influenced by Clark and 
Moss (2001, 2005), were developed to overcome the challenges of listening to young 
children with developing communication skills. The use of puppets, vignettes and 
photographs to stimulate group interviews enabled the children to present their 
perceptions of childhood. However, whilst the perceptions offered were the children’s, 
the interpretation and analysis were from an adult perspective. I concluded that to 
better understand children’s perspectives on the world involving children in analysis 
would go some way as an attempt to reduce any adultist perspective.  
 
Further exploration of this concept of voice is offered by Lundy (2007: 927) who argues 
that ‘voice is not enough’. She critiques the concept of children’s voice and identifies 
barriers to the implementation of this right in the field of education commenting, as 
Krappman (2010) does, that one of the key barriers to children’s voice is the adults 
who are not listening. Whilst Lundy (2007) offers a reflective critique as to how 
children’s voice is heard, if indeed it is, Komulainen (2007) and Lewis (2010) offer an 

 
86 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
alternative perspective, that of the ‘ambiguity of voice’ (Komulainen 2007: 11), and 
‘silence in the context of child voice’ (Lewis 2010:14). Both of which conclude that 
whilst adults are professionally and personally keen to promote the voice of the child 
there are ethical implications such as consent, assent, and children’s ability to give or 
withdraw permission. The concern to promote children’s voice has perhaps resulted 
in ignoring silence which may be just as important (Lewis 2010), when working with 
very young or some disabled children. In either case it can be argued that adults have 
often sought affirmation or decision making in research involving children where 
indeed there is none (Komulainen 2007).  
Morrow’s (1999) seminal research aimed to identify children’s perspectives of their 
rights in England; her summaries of findings identified children felt they lacked 
autonomy and inclusion in decision making and that they were denied a range of rights 
that adults take for granted, both with families, school and society in general. However 
in the light of Komulainen (2007) and Lewis (2010) the methods used by Morrow 
(1999) to gather data and the subsequent interpretation of responses could be 
challenged, particularly in relation to the adult role. For example, the adult researcher 
in Morrow’s work, when interviewing children took the dominant role probing children 
for clarification, when perhaps the children interviewed were in themselves ambiguous 
and unsure of their own meaning and interpretation of questions asked. The group 
interviews and individual interviews carried out by Morrow (1999) places control and 
authority directly with the adult and whilst children were comfortable to comment that 
they felt undervalued, the probing nature of the interviewer may have influenced the 
child’s comments. More controversial though is the methodology adopted by Morrow 

 
87 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
(1999) in the first project whereby children aged 11 – 16 were asked to write essays 
during an English lesson about their perspectives of rights and what they understood 
by this term. The research identifies that consent was gained by the Headteacher and 
School Governors to use one lesson for the children to do this. There is no mention of 
consent from the children themselves or indeed parents, they were not given the 
option to not participate and consequently silence was not a choice offered. As such, 
given my ‘developing’ ontological position I notice my uncomfortable feelings and 
suggest that the research is in fact compromised by both the environment and the lack 
of consent from the children participants. MacLure et al (2010) offers the idea that for 
qualitative researchers the idea of silence is troublesome, in that it resists analysis. As 
a post-qualitative researcher (like MacLure) I am prompted to speak more of the 
silence and will do so later. I see this as the remnants of ‘Other’ (Derrida 1967) that 
MacLure et al (2010) describes as ‘something intractable, unspeakable, 
unreasonable, unanalyzable’ (p495), but nevertheless unignorable. 
 
 
3.6 Relationships and Power. 
 
It can be argued that power relationships between adult and child lie at the centre of 
‘listening’ to children and children’s ‘voice’. Popular perspectives about this issue focus 
on ‘enabling’ children’s voice to be heard, and ‘empowering’ children through listening 
to them (Clarke and Moss 2001, 2005, Greene and Hill 2005, Layard and Dunn 2009).  
In this context ‘listening’ is an active verb necessitating an active response from the 
person in relation to the sounds, words, ideas being communicated, as a opposed to 

 
88 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
hearing which could be deemed to be passive and unresponsive in an emotional or 
cognitive manner to auditory stimuli of those same sounds, words and ideas. The 
subtleties in the choice of vocabulary reflect a belief that through the process of 
‘listening’ to children they become empowered and by becoming so they gain validity, 
reputation, and to a degree, purpose in research. For some time now in the study of 
childhood the idea that children are social actors in their own right has been accepted 
(James and Prout 1990). Adult researchers increasingly appear to emphasise their 
recognition and acceptance of children to be themselves and not ‘less than’ or 
‘incomplete’ adults, ‘beings’ not ‘becomings’ (Qvortup 1994). However, this 
empowering could also be interpreted as those adults being benevolent in ‘giving’ 
children power and ‘bequeathing’ their right to be listened to which is paradoxically 
disempowering.  
 
 
 
3.6.1 Relationship and Power – Children in Society. 
 
Childhood is socially constructed and it is the adults that construct society and thereby 
define what it is to be a child. It is adults who have ordered society and established 
the division of two separate groups in generational terms, adults and children (Leonard 
2016). In some aspects of social life children are at the heart, and positively included, 
for example in family life, accepting that whilst this may be the norm it is not always 
the case. However in the wider community, wider society, children are for the most 
excluded, for example politics and social decisions. The ongoing debate regarding the 

 
89 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
lowering of the voting age in England and the heated responses to this is just one 
illustration of how any shift in the established social generational order is greeted with 
resistance (Tilley 2019). Both generational groups have a different set of rights, 
different roles to play, different responsibilities and expectations and indeed different 
freedoms. However, the asymmetrical nature of power within this social order is a key 
feature influencing research (Mayall 2000). The acknowledgment of these power 
differentials at work, particularly in the context of a school classroom can be said to be 
central to understanding the complexities of children as research participants. 
 
 
3.6.2 Relationship and Power – Children in School. 
 
The recognition of authority and power in any hierarchical system, for example a 
school or educational setting, can be interpreted differently and others, including 
Gallagher (2008), offer an interpretation of Foucault’s position to view power, and the 
perceived lack of it, from a positive rather than negative position. Viewing the ‘lack of 
power’ to be powerful may well provide a more robust framework through which to 
understand the relationships between adults and children in a working environment. 
For Gallagher it is not simply about power-sharing or handing over of power but rather 
a process through which equal relationships are created. Taking Foucault’s position, 
Gallagher (2008) explains that for power to be exercised there has to be complicity 
and institutional structures that are embedded. With regards to Foucault’s (2004) 
notion of governmentality, Gallagher (2008) would argue that schools replicate 
governmentality proposing that the objective of the institution can only be fulfilled 

 
90 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
providing there is compliance from those who are subject to it . One argument is that 
in schools the hierarchical systems in place can only happen as adults appear to be 
more powerful than children and the children are compliant in allowing this to occur. 
However this generalisation does not exclude the many potential instances of 
resistance and confrontation through which children are able to exercise power over 
adults, for example in removing co-operation, or presenting with low level disruptive 
behaviour as seen during pilot-study 1 and explored in Chapter 2: The Weary 
Traveller.  
 
My previous research, (Lowe 2012), identified the discourse ‘The Unauthorised Child’ 
which could be argued demonstrates this compliance; in that the young children in my 
research appeared to recognise the dominant discourse of childhood that was evident 
in their early years setting and was constructed by the adults. Despite this apparent 
acceptance of the dominant discourse they still appeared to yearn for independence 
of thought and deed.  
Children showed frustration and dissatisfaction when they demonstrated 
an ability to solve problems, complete tasks or knew what to do next, and 
this was quashed by the social rules of the situation. Children appeared to 
accept  unwillingly that rules are different for them because they are 
children, and consequently, they are not given permission by the adults 
and, in some circumstances, by their peers to see things through. (Lowe 
2012:276) 
 
Foucault understands power as a force that can be either positive or negative, 
repressive or productive. Moreover, he argues that where there is power, there is 
inevitably resistance (Ball 2013). The possibility of resistance can be seen above in 

 
91 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
the children’s frustration when forced to abide by the social rules. Initially there is 
perhaps the impossibility of resistance given that the adult dominates, however the 
possibility of resistance, and its destabilising impact is only too evident, and as 
explored in Chapter 2: The Weary Traveller was something that teachers invited to 
participate in the pilot studies raised concerns about. The teachers’ concerns were/are 
one element that provokes my curiosity about children, their rights, their voice, and in 
this thesis, their place as researchers. 
 
3.7 Children as Researchers. 
 
Kellett (2005), and again with Ward (2008), argues that there is a need to rethink the 
way in which we research children and childhood and maintains that this is due both 
to the evolving nature of childhood itself, and a recognition that childhood is itself 
socially constructed (James et al 1998).This position reflects a paradigm shift and 
movement from research ‘on’ children towards research ‘by’ children. Adopting this 
position challenges the pre-existing power-dynamics. Critics of the concept of 
Children-as-Researchers approach inevitably voice concerns regarding children’s age 
and the competency of children which are often presented as barriers to their 
participation in research (Christiansen and Prout (2005), Hogan (2005), and Morrow 
2005). However, in support of this paradigm shift, Christensen and Prout (2005) 
propose that in the Western disciplinary field of Early Childhood children have 
previously been objects of passivity, with adult researchers misconstruing, 
misinterpreting and mistakenly re-presenting the views values, and beliefs of children. 
They argue for a repositioning to enable the experts in the field, the children 

 
92 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
themselves, to actively participate in research. Whilst there has been research 
claiming to have children as active research participants, Bucknall (2012) argues that 
in reality this equates to only partial participation, for example when children have been 
reported as being involved at only certain points of the project or being identified as 
co-researchers and not researchers in their own right. Indeed this criticism could be 
aimed at my previous research (Lowe 2012).  
 
 
When promoting the concept of children as active research participants careful 
consideration has been given to the development of accessible research tools that are 
matched to children’s developing skills, in particular their literacy skills. Consequently 
a wide range of child friendly, child engaging and developmentally appropriate 
research strategies have been developed and are used frequently to enable children 
to be active researcher participants. One approach that has contributed to the moving 
away of research on children to research with children is the Mosaic Approach as 
originally designed by Clark & Moss (2001). This approach has developed a range of 
research tools which reflect children’s everyday lives and actively enables very young 
children to participate fully in data collection.   It draws on the use of talking, drawing, 
photography and map-making, as tools that research participants between 3 – 5 years 
have used to collect data.  
 
Similarly others, including myself, have designed innovative tools for children to gather 
and offer data: for example Fleet and Britt (2011) – children’s photographs of favourite 
parts of their day, Lowe (2012) vignettes of experiences, O’Kane (2008) ‘Pots and 
Beans’ – a voting system. Like the Mosaic Approach however these remain research 

 
93 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
‘with’ children (Kellett 2010) and not research ‘by’ children (Kellett 2010), as the data 
gathering by children remains separate from the interpretation and analysis of data 
done by adults. However these research tools can contribute to a more enabling 
research process for the youngest of researchers and their usefulness and purpose 
can be considered at the design stage.  
 
Whilst these developments are welcomed with in the Early Childhood sector, 
Gallacher and Gallagher (2008) argue that too much emphasis has been given to 
specific tools and that moreover there is little evaluation of such tools, rather a subtle 
acceptance of the usefulness of them. Conversely they suggest the need for far more 
evaluation and consideration of the limits to such an approach, alongside the need to 
more effectively consider how young researchers can be actively involved in planning 
and designing, and ultimately carrying out research. Kellett (2010) and Elton-Chalcraft 
(2011) have attempted to address this criticism, although it is important to note that in 
their research the young researchers were all aged 8 or over, and have been identified 
as having sophisticated levels of literacy, which in itself enables them to enter freely 
into the adult world of research that is dependent on both oracy and literacy. A question 
here becomes how can those committed to children as active researchers enable 
younger children from 5 to 8 to also access the learning and develop the skills to 
enable them to benefit from not only participating in research, but to actively make 
informed decisions about the design, data gathering, analysis and subsequently offer 
conclusion to their own research questions.  Essentially in this study (initially) asking 
‘How might very young children be active participants in researching their own 
educational lives?’  A personal commitment to the rights and place of the youngest 

 
94 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
children in society, and a curiosity about effective ways to promote children’s voice 
and fully participate in the research process would for me, be said to be at the forefront 
of any research design actually involving children as co-researchers. 
 
3.8 Rift or shift? 
 
At this point in my literature review, having previously adopted the conventional 
systematic approach above, I found myself at a juncture. As indicated in ‘The Weary 
Traveller’, (Chapter Two) the significance of the pilot study ‘event’ (Derrida 1994, Zizek 
2014), triggered an ontological shift which created a tension and feelings of discontent 
that something was missing from the discussions thus far. The original purpose of the 
literature review was to explore what was already known, and understood, about the 
origins and context of children’s right to participation, and to consider how others had 
actively engaged young children in investigating their own lives.  As such the approach 
taken in the first part of the review was limited to reproductive inquiry (Montuori 2005), 
offering what is already known. However, moving towards an ontology that embraces 
the impact of the researcher, rather than recoils from it, I am urged on by Montuori 
(2005) to adopt a more creative approach, that not only acknowledges those that have 
gone before, the ‘ancestors’, but to explore ‘the relationship between knowledge, self, 
and world’ (Montuori 2005: 375). Henceforth this is the new approach to be taken. 
 
The pilot study, ‘event’, provoked and questioned me leaving provocations worthy of 
further examination. When re-viewing the literature in this next section I move away 
from the child to refocus on the adult, I do not devalue children and their position and 

 
95 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
worth but seek to understand Children-as-Researchers, and to do so, I appreciate that 
I now need to deconstruct the adult role as co-researcher. I shift my focus to reflect 
upon and examine the concept of professional teacher identity. I am going to argue 
that teachers can make more sense of their relationships with children, how they 
perceive, and meet, children’s needs and, how children respond to their interactions if 
there is a deeper clarity of their role and professional identity (Hotho 2008, Simms 
2011, Trede et al 2012 and Winstone  & Moore 2017).  
 
Secondly I will revisit the idea of ‘voice’, through its obverse ‘silence’ and how, in the 
absence of sound it is still possible to make meaning of that silence, providing the 
listener is tuned in. The echoes of previous ‘voices’ can be heard even when initially 
there appears to be nothing said. This step into the unknown, and unheard, 
demonstrates an ontological shift that commits to ‘silence’ as offering data, and that 
silence is viewed as ‘something’ rather than ‘nothing’. In this study silence is 
interpreted as providing valuable insights to values, beliefs and perceptions about 
children’s rights, and the role children have as active researchers when researching 
their educational lives, which are gathered as part of this project. 
 
Having recognised the complexity and impact of power relationships when carrying 
out research with and by children, the processes and environment through which 
power is perceived to be granted, bequeathed or bestowed is a third theme to be 
examined. The play of power through adopted strategies that relate to power or 
powerlessness, the recognition of orthodox to heterodox attitudes and behaviours as 
well as how power is accepted or declined becomes my next focus. Significantly I 

 
96 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
reflect on my own naiveté on my journey as a researcher and offer a transparent 
account of a personal journey as I move to a re-positioning in relation to my 
understanding of power, influenced by Foucualt (1980). 
 
Finally in this post ‘event’ review of the literature the fourth theme to be reviewed 
promotes more questions and identifies why the initial research design moved on, and 
how the methodology responded not only to questions posed by reviewing literature 
but inevitably the pilot study ‘event’. By problematising the notion of Children-as-
Researchers, through a consideration of the cultural and social position that seeks to 
promote and create this concept as normative research behaviour, I will justify the 
development of my methodology and research methods by taking the reader through 
my thought processes. This stream of consciousness will demonstrate how this review 
of literature can be understood as a significant part of my methodology in its own right. 
 
As I become aware of my changing ontological position, from conventional qualitative 
researcher to post-qualitative researcher I am increasingly mindful that I need to 
reconsider not just the emerging ideas and reflections that are realised, but importantly 
the format of the literature review, including style and tone.  To illustrate this process 
of re-presenting, the post pilot study ‘event’ will offer an alternative ‘voice’ through the 
text, and a visual change in presentation, illustrated through font and type. The change 
I describe is also a step into the unknown, for me, taken tentatively by re-viewing and 
re-presenting literature conceptualises a new, for me, ontology and a post –qualitative 
position. As indicated in the introduction to this chapter the following sections of the 
literature review adopt a more conversational, stream of consciousness that explores 

 
97 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
key ideas and in doing so demonstrate the emerging concepts, and records my 
personal research journey of discovery. This is not to ignore the extant review in the 
first part of this chapter but offers the subsequent review as an integral part of the 
methodology which will be discussed in Chapter 4: ‘Finding the Way’. 
For me the pilot study is recognisable now as an ‘event’, (Derrida 1994, Zizek 2014), 
which insists upon a re-examining of the themes and exploration of knowledge 
discussed in the first part of this review. Through this process I am not only re-
examining themes but also explaining to myself how I understand and view children 
and their right to be, their right to research their lives, and creatively discover, reveal, 
and share their knowledge about their lives. This transparency promotes the 
interrelationship between subjectivity and objectivity when considering my research 
world. Whilst this link towards methodological debates may at first seem out of place 
in a literature review I understand the place of this review, together with my personal 
reflections to be not just connected to but an inherent aspect of the blurring of 
methodologies.  Not only does the revelation of ‘self’ feel important as I move on to 
explore professional teaching identity but the place of ‘self’ is also recognised through 
a new found conviction in using the personal pronoun ‘I’ in the research text. Taking 
ownership of the personal pronoun demonstrates confidence that ‘I’ am an integral 
feature of this re-view. However, in allowing my own voice to be heard I accept the 
accountability that Kirsch 1994 (cited in Walker 2015) cautions. There is a certain irony 
that as my focus and inspiration has always been about children’s voices being heard, 
in adopting the use of ‘I’, I am not being silenced through use of the third person 
traditionally used in academic writing.

3.9 Professional Identities. 
 
The deconstructing of the adult role within this research is key to unpicking Children-
as-Researcher initiatives. The encounters with my professional identities, and 
subsequent tensions, outlined in the previous chapter as part of the pilot study 
promotes a shift in this direction, a new line of flight to follow.  An analysis of my own 
professional identities, as teacher and researcher will demonstrate how and why new 
questions and provocations arose through the research process, as well as being an 
essential aspect of the ongoing nature of the ontological approach taken. Now though 
I need to offer consideration as to how professional identity is both defined, and 
formed, before considering both teacher identities and academic identities as a way 
of understanding myself and my professional identity, both as a teacher and 
researcher.  
 
According to Sutherland and Markauskaite (2012) there are three aspects present in 
defining what it means to be a professional; the formalised body of knowledge, 
alongside practical knowledge and skills, together with the ability to reflect on that 
knowledge and skills. However professional identity is more than this, it refers to not 
only how the individual sees themselves but how society sees them in relation to the 
socially agreed values and beliefs about that role. My professional identity is about me 
as a teacher (my professional qualification) and my teaching in Higher Education, (my 
current occupation). Recognising that this identity is multifaceted and socially 
constructed from the outset demonstrates the complexity of professional identities. 
Sociocultural theory, that posits the idea that identities are determined not by 

 
99 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
characteristics but rather interactions and responses to society, offers a way to make 
sense of this complexity (Taylor 2017). The language used to describe professions 
often demonstrates underlying views, values and beliefs about aspects of the 
professional role that is undertaken.  
 
What am I then, a teacher, a researcher, an administrator, a manager and leader? 
Each of these roles is interlinked and impacts on the others, and in reality may not be 
distinguishable from the other. When considering the shift in teacher education in 
recent years Swennen, Jones and Volman (2010)  identify the professional 
development needs of teacher educators, acknowledging that there are sub-identities 
in this field, that of ‘schoolteacher, teacher in Higher Education, teacher of teachers 
(or second order teacher) and researcher’ (2010:131). My difficulty in relating to these 
identities asks questions of myself in terms of who am I when conducting the field work 
for this thesis. At the outset of my research journey however this was not a question I 
asked or indeed expected to have to answer. 
  
When considering the language to communicate my own professional identity I reject 
the term ‘teacher’ and prefer ‘educator’. In doing so I distance myself from my primary 
school professional roots, and as such demonstrate some of my personal values and 
beliefs.  My professional identity is formed by my current role as Head of Department 
for programmes that are not centred on teacher training, and this distances myself 
further from everyday practice and policy within primary schools, and my initial 
professional origins. This role restates my identity as ‘educator’ rather than ‘teacher’ 
as my professional focus remains centred on education beyond the limits of primary 

 
100 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
school, national curriculum subjects and OFSTED, and places children and their 
holistic needs at the centre of my department. Alongside a commitment to education 
in its fullest definition runs my personal beliefs about social justice and widening 
participation, indeed these personal values are those that lie at the core of my research 
and provide the trigger for this enquiry. 
 
Trede, Macklin and Bridges (2012) in their systematic review of literature on 
professional identity attempt to examine how it is understood in Higher Education. 
Their conclusion recommends that there is a need for a better understanding of 
personal values as well as the impact of workplace learning and power influences in 
communities of practice. My experience during the pilot study would concur with this 
conclusion; whilst my professional understanding of what it was to be a teacher 
strongly influenced my behaviour during the first pilot study, it was only after a deeper 
reflection on my personal values in terms of children’s voice that I later acknowledged 
the presence of silence which grew out of that experience. 
 
In addition to the impact of personal values and beliefs Sutherland and Markauskaite 
(2012) determine that professional identity is more than the development of skills, 
attitudes and approaches. They argue that becoming a professional is the combination 
of professional skills and practices, as well as a sense of self, of who you are. This 
ontological sense of wellbeing and engaging with, and within, the community of other 
professionals is what determines and generates professional identity. The formation 
of professional identity therefore is not linear, nor is it for many easy to define, (Clarke 
et al 2013, Sutherland 2012, Trede, Macklin and Bridges 2012, Simms 2011, Hotho 

 
101 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
2008, and DeMatteo& Reeves 2013).  Acquiring a professional ‘superior body of 
knowledge’ is distinguishable from the job skills, and both rely on ‘authentic learning’ 
experiences over time (Sutherland and Markauskaite 2012:748). Simms (2011) 
concurs, elaborating further by suggesting that professionals, including teachers, hold 
plural identities that are dependent on the specific culture and context of their 
organisation and also the wider sphere of the profession as a whole, nationally and 
perhaps internationally. 
 
As a professional within the field of education, my learning to be a teacher combined 
undergraduate academic and skill-based study and practical experiences in 
classrooms. In addition I brought personal values and a philosophy formulated by my 
attitudes to social justice, such as a commitment to empowerment of the weak and 
powerless in society, (bearing in mind of course that these underpinning values were 
cultivated with a naive understanding of power that I held at that time). Transferring 
this social and cultural stance to my professional undertaking as a teacher had a 
profound impact on my pedagogical stance as well as my professional role and 
relationships with the school community. Inevitably it has influenced and become 
embedded in my approach to this study. Sutherland and Markauskaite (2012) pose 
that there are two interconnecting and relatable aspects of professional identity – 
interpersonal and intrapersonal. The latter aspect relating to the perceptions of ‘self in 
context’, following reflection and self-evaluation. The former relating to not only the 
skills and behaviour associated with practice but also the culture of the profession and 
tacit coded professional knowledge. This interpersonal aspect was what challenged 
me when undertaking the first pilot study. I was attempting to be seen as a competent 

 
102 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
and effective teacher who understood that coded professional knowledge. However, 
when under scrutiny from colleagues, and pupils at the school research setting, I 
struggled to come to terms with my new self-identity as a researcher and the tensions 
that new identity created with my other identity as an effective primary school teacher. 
This tension and uncomfortableness was experienced when I felt was being judged 
on my capabilities to be a primary school teacher and resulted in me defaulting to my 
previous identity as a teacher, disregarding the role of the researcher in the classroom. 
Findlow (2012) suggests this is common in professionals who have moved into 
academic roles within their field. When reviewing the first pilot study I now can see 
how easily I reverted to a focus on children’s learning as an indicator of my capabilities 
in the classroom. This was demonstrated in the first pilot study experience by the 
subtleties of the vocabulary, the tools and the systems I developed, as well as the 
rituals and the routines of behaviour that I automatically adopted when feeling under 
pressure to demonstrate my competence to the teachers in the research setting. This 
was most evident in my responses to the challenges of behaviour management, the 
ease with which I returned to the use of the ‘teacher voice’, the ‘teacher look’ and the 
‘teacher role’ in terms of power and control when working with the children, despite 
my initial intentions for that experience to be otherwise.  
 
Of Sutherland and Markauskaite’s (2012) three aspects of becoming a professional, it 
is the third aspect, the ability to reflect on the required knowledge and skills, which 
resonates with Donald Schön’s (1991) definition of professionalism. Schön (1991) 
regards reflection, both on and in action, as being core to professional practice in 
education. In reflecting on the required knowledge and skills there is also a recognition 

 
103 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
of the importance of socio-emotional components, that of confidence and capability. I 
consider myself to be a confident and capable teacher, or educator - my preferred 
nomenclature, and clearly I moved into this role in the pilot study very quickly and with 
ease. My professional identity also includes being an early career researcher, and on 
reflection I perhaps lacked confidence in my own capabilities in this dimension. Could 
this then explain why I initially demonstrated a hesitancy in adopting this aspect of my 
professional identity in the first pilot study?  
 
Clarke, Hyde and Drennan (2013) considers academic identity in relation to being a 
teacher and a researcher. They too offer the idea that identity in an academic role is 
multi-faceted and list various aspects of the role that I am very familiar with, including 
curriculum design, teaching, research administration as well as scholarly activity that 
is subject based. For Clarke et al (2012) professional identity is not so much about 
‘who I am now’ but rather ‘who I want to be’, which involves ‘an ongoing process of 
interpretation and re-interpretation’ (2012: 9). With this in mind then the struggle I have 
had with my professional identity during the pilot study could be said to be more about 
wanting to be established as a researcher and not being labelled as the teacher. 
Although I recognise that through both I overtly, and covertly, repositioned myself 
further away from schools and the teaching profession which constituted my initial 
professional identity in education. As such then this experience demonstrates my 
transitioning from teacher to researcher, or more subtly demonstrates the hybridity of 
that transformation. 
 

 
104 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Clarke, Hyde and Drennan (2013) draw on the work of Tierney and Rhodes (1993:29) 
when discussing the influence of ‘transmission of culture and ritualised behaviour’ as 
a way of developing professional identity/ies in academic roles/settings. As Swennen, 
Jones and Volman (2010) point out most academics who find themselves in the role 
of teacher educators, have made the transition from school based practice to teacher 
educators without any bespoke training or professional development opportunities and 
without the same pathway that academics in other disciplines follow.  As a teaching-
focussed academic I have not worked closely in graduate school watching and 
mirroring a professor, consequently I have not observed the customs and behaviour 
of a researcher confident in that ‘superior body of knowledge’ (Sutherland and 
Markauskaite 2012:748) nor have I had ‘authentic practical learning experiences’ 
(Sutherland and Markauskaite 2012:749) of research that they refer to as being 
significant in establishing professional identity. Whilst I have confidence in the skills, 
approaches and technical aspects of being a researcher, I acknowledge the lack of 
‘authentic learning’, as described by Sutherland and Markauskaite (2012).Being very 
much an early career researcher I have not had many meaningful experiences to learn 
the codes of behaviour, the subtleties, that go along with the skills to form that 
professional identity (Simms 2011 in Sutherland & Markauskaite 2012). 
 
 
This reflection then leaves a question to be considered, if not answered yet, and that 
is ‘Would a more confident and experienced researcher than myself have committed 
to a researcher role in the pilot study, and if this was the case would they also 

 
105 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
experience the tensions and, to an extent a dissatisfaction of their ability to be that 
competent teacher when faced with a group of demanding young children?  
 
The idea of hybrid identities is explored by Findlow (2012) who studies professional 
identities for those in newer academic disciplines that have moved from practice in 
their field to being academics in their field, in his case-study the field of nursing. 
Findlow offers the notion that when dealing with the tension of competing identities it 
is the more traditional vocational role that confers identity rather than the academic 
role. Indeed this notion mirrors my experience of the pilot study where I was compelled 
to return to my original ‘teacher’ identity rather than my newer identity as a researcher.  
 
The relationship then between teachers and researchers, and teaching and research 
itself, appears now to be a significant aspect to be explored further in this research. 
The origins of the discourse concerning the relationship between academic research 
and the teaching profession and indeed teachers as researchers can be traced to the 
work of Stenhouse (1981), who posed the view that practising teachers were best 
placed to research educational theory and practice, teaching and learning. Stenhouse 
(1981: 110) rejected the idea that  ‘teachers [are] theoretically innocent’; over thirty-
five years later the idea of teachers as researchers has more acceptance, as indicated 
by the numbers of working teachers taking on board practice-led post graduate 
Masters and Doctoral research (HEA 2017). Stenhouse suggests that not only should 
teachers always be intimately involved in researching their own practice but that non-
teaching researchers of teaching and learning must justify themselves to practitioners 

 
106 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
and not the other way round. How then does Stenhouses’s position stand-up to my 
experience within the pilot study ‘event’ (Derrida 1994)?  
 
Teachers’ perspectives of involvement in, and with, research has been more recently 
considered by Leat, Lofthouse and Reid (2014) who undertook a systematic literature 
review in an attempt to ascertain both experience of, and participation in, research as 
well as consideration of the barriers to participating in research. From the outset they 
acknowledge that there is little research that focuses on these aims and any 
conclusions offered are drawn from a wide range of literature that considers 
professional roles, development and school improvement. This alone echoes the 
question to be explored as part of this project, namely  what perception of research do 
teachers have, both as participants and as researchers, and further how do they 
consider the rights of children to be part of such enquiries? 
 
When considering teacher experience of research Leat, Lofthouse and Reid (2014) 
identify that there is an overwhelming positivity towards engagement by teachers in 
research, whilst acknowledging that this is largely within the field of professional 
development and improved performance and outcomes. For example, research as a 
tool for managing change and improvement appears to be the main reason why 
teachers state they would get involved in research. Reviewing a number of research 
reports Leat et al (2014) identify other benefits of engaging in research to be the socio-
emotional benefits of improved self-esteem, improved self-confidence, feelings of 
pride, and connectivity with peers and colleagues. This links to the aspects of 
professional identity and self-confidence highlighted by Clarke, Hyde and Drennan 

 
107 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
(2013). In addition engaging in research would, I believe, promote what Hargreaves 
and Fullan (2012) refer to as ‘professional capital’ which they consider to be essential 
in improving schools and the schooling system. They suggest that in order to be most 
effective teachers need a combination of human capital (the skills to be an effective 
teacher), social capital (working with a group of likeminded colleagues) and decisional 
capital (the ability to make good decisions).   
 
Whilst the teachers in research reviewed by Leat, Lofthouse and Reid (2014) reported 
on their improved professional identity as teachers, there is though no evidence to 
suggest the impact on their participants’ self-identity as a researchers. I begin to 
wonder if this is because each role is so interlinked that adopting a binary 
understanding of these professional roles is either not possible or rather not useful… 
 
Alternatively if considering each identity as a separate professional persona is useful, 
is this dependent on the context and environment, and access and opportunity? 
 
This would seem to be yet another provocation that has grown out of the post-event 
literature review, to be explored, unpicked and considered.  
 
Again maybe there is no specific answer yet the tension, or perceived tensions, 
between these two roles causes me to stand still and reflect on how I have been 
affected by adoption of both roles. 
 

 
108 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The main constraint to active participation in research according to Stenhouse in 1981 
was time. In the review by Leat, Lofthouse and Reid, thirty five years later, this barrier 
is restated, however in addition they explore the importance of relationships, personal 
capabilities, and interestingly, trust; these are offered as constraints to teachers 
carrying out research. Relationships with Head teachers, Governing Bodies and Local 
Authorities are also identified as being barriers not only to conducting and engaging 
with research but responding to any changes that may emerge following research. 
Interestingly, the priorities of the research noted in Leat, Lofthouse and Reid’s review 
is justified by school improvement plans and better outcomes. Relationships with HEIs 
are noted as being particularly important as stated by Newman and Mowbray (2012) 
in their research conducted by academics and teachers working together. The 
significant factors of success in their study was the approach to working in partnership 
and, as a result of that partnership, the community of learners and communities of 
practice that emerged. The importance of effective relationships was also emphasised, 
with mentoring roles being undertaken by academics to support teachers so that both 
their professional lives were enriched and extended by engaging in practice-led 
research. The quality of these relationships, and their impact on self-esteem and self-
confidence is well documented by Randal et al (2015). How the individual believes 
they are perceived within a professional community is a key driver in how professional 
identity is secured, essentially the socio-emotional elements of identity, self confidence 
and self-esteem. In this respect then it appears that the quality of relationships 
between academics and teachers impact on whether or not teachers see themselves 
as researchers (Sutherland and Markauskaite 2012). 
 

 
109 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Notably Leat, Lofthouse and Reid (2014) go on to consider the impact of research on 
teachers once a project has been completed. They identify that one of the issues for 
some teachers is a subsequent sense of dissatisfaction, particularly with school 
activity or curriculum, to the extent that this results in them leaving the classroom. 
However it could be argued that teachers who leave schools post research projects, 
do so not as a direct result of the research but rather that through the research process 
they become more likely to be questioning and curious about practice and policy, and 
see that there is more capacity to research aspects of the curriculum, policy and 
practice, outside of the class room, rather than within it.  
 
The idea of a positive attitude to research by classroom teachers is offered by 
Beycioglu, Ozer and Uguralu (2010) who identified that 68% of teachers in their study 
had considered conducting research since qualification, and that this research would 
be closely linked to ‘professional learning’. They interpret this as teachers thinking of 
research as a form of practitioner based enquiry and potential problem solving in order 
to improve practice rather than any voyage of self-discovery. Research linked to self-
improvement by improving practice is, according to Beycioglu et al (2010), the main 
reason why teachers in their study had a positive attitude towards carrying out 
research.  However Beycioglu et al (2010) do not report how many teachers went on 
to carry out research linked to ‘professional learning’ only that teachers in the study 
had considered carrying out such research.  Conclusions drawn by Beycioglu et al 
(2010) emphasise again the benefits of teachers working to develop research 
communities of practice to improve outcomes. In doing so teachers add to existing 
knowledge, without which Beycioglu et al (2010) suggest that the profession would be 

 
110 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
dormant and ‘competences or skills will be at the back of their time’ (2010:1092). Whilst 
their work focuses on the benefits to the profession as a whole, i.e. new knowledge, 
there is no exploration or recognition of the personal impact of carrying out research 
in terms of self-esteem, self-confidence or identity, unlike my study. 
Nevertheless, when considering the teacher’s role in research, and attitudes towards 
it, much of what I have reviewed post pilot study would suggest there to be a positive 
response to active participation in the field work for this project, and yet this was not 
the experience in my case. This provokes a need to problematise the role of teachers 
in research further to unpick why repeatedly there was a lack of interest, a reluctance 
to get involved and why trusting relationships became a lever for gates that may have 
been closed. 
 
 
3.10 Silences. 
 
The emerging position of promoting children’s voices has been well researched and 
considered in section 3.5 (p 84. ff). Part of my professional identity, the values, and 
beliefs that underpin that professional identify, are clearly influenced by the discipline 
of Early Years and a commitment to children and childhood and children’s voices. As 
a teacher/educator and as an academic I began this doctoral journey with a firm belief, 
respect and a commitment to participatory methodologies as the previous chapter has 
illustrated.   
 

 
111 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The experience of the pilot study ‘event’ and my resulting ontological shift has made it 
necessary to re-examine the concept of children’s voice. My focus in this section will 
consider the place of silence within the concept of voice, taking the position that this 
too can be explored and recognised as data, and to reflect on what happens when the 
response to questions is silence. The reflections here impacted on my developing 
methodology and are offered here not only as a part of a review of literature about the 
concept, but as a further indication of how the literature review is an integral part of 
my methodology, demonstrating how methodologies became evermore blurred within 
my post-qualitative approach. 
 
Throughout various stages of the pilot-study when researching children, and indeed 
adults, I have been met with silence.  Lewis (2010) when considering the rights of the 
most vulnerable children, for example those with additional needs and learning 
difficulties, recognises the child’s use of silence to demonstrate the children’s right to 
not participate. Others who have problematised capturing the voice of the child have 
acknowledge the use of silence by non-verbal children, for example Schnoor (2012), 
but have not explored how to analyse that silence, only to acknowledge its existence.   
 
The silence I encountered however raised confusion and a tension when I considered 
my own values and professional identity as an advocate of children’s rights. I 
confidently believed that I could demonstrate through both my pedagogical decisions 
as a teacher of children, and through curriculum design and planning as a leader in 
HE, that listening to children and responding to their opinions is part of my personal 
and professional responsibilities and identity. It is clear to me that many researchers 

 
112 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
in the field stretch, pull and mould a variety of stimulating participatory methods to 
capture the voice of the child. Whist some are brave enough to offer a discussion about 
the ethics of  doing this,  for example Harcourt et al (2011), others, (Waller and Bitou 
2011), further challenge us to question whether in the eagerness to capture the voice 
of young children researchers have critiqued effectively these often original and 
engaging methods. In addition to this, by the acceptance and adoption of such 
methodologies, have researchers considered whether, if at all, the process of 
participatory researcher benefits young children? 
 
Similarly Gallacher and Gallagher (2008) offer concerns about participatory 
approaches when researching with children, suggesting that the very rigour of the 
research tools, adult-chosen, adult-designed, in fact reinforce the perception of power 
and control being in the hands of the adult researchers and as such these approaches 
fail to be fully participatory. The need to question and re-examine approaches adopted 
when designing tools for children as research participants (Waller and Bitou 2011), 
supports my own questions and uncertainties. However none of these critical positions 
support my niggling question as to why would children not want to participate and how 
can adult researchers understand and listen to the data represented by the silence of 
non-participation or rejection of the invitation to participate?  
 
Issues of silences and emptiness challenged me. Throughout the pilot the silence 
came from adults and children alike. Was this because the children as a social group, 
within a micro-system designed and created by adults, some of whom also gave a 
silent response, were repeating that silence or were they simply not represented /given 

 
113 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
a voice by the research tool chosen ? Was this because the adults, as decision 
makers, generated that culture and reinforced subtley their own beliefs about the place 
of research? Was this again replicated at home by parents who similarly were passive 
in their support of participating in research? Was this because the idea of research 
was far from the actual lived lives and pattern that children and young people 
associated with the schools? Could this also be the same for the teachers that were 
generating and dominating the culture and environment within the schools/settings 
approached in the research? These are not necessarily questions to be answered in 
this study, rather they represent a series of provocations and probing ideas that 
percolated to generate a new focus for the research design going forward.  
 
My acknowledgement of the significance of silence has been influenced by the work 
of Lisa Mazzei who proposes that:  
qualitative researchers should not dismiss silence as an omission or 
absence of empirical materials , but rather engage the silence as meaning 
full and  purpose full (2007:2). 
 
Accepting that voice, opinion, and providing opportunities for the voice of the 
vulnerable and marginalised to be listened to is an underpinning aim of this doctoral 
study, it is clear that for me ‘voice’ also includes silence, and potentially that opinion 
includes ambivalence. Silence then becomes another aspect of participation that 
whilst not an original aim of the research is necessary to explore. I need to be able to 
make sense of the educational lives of young children and how participation is 
understood by children and other stakeholders. Clarifying and stating these previously 

 
114 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
unconsidered questions and lines of enquiry about silence is justified and essential 
before any attempt to unpick the original aims of the research. As Mazzei (2007) 
indicates the deconstruction of perceived notions enables the silence to be listened 
and responded to, but only if empirical data is viewed holistically, to include positive 
and negative, the something and nothing, the voice and silence. Responding to, and 
listening to, the silence is part of our purpose to discover and understand. As Mazzei 
puts it the ‘absent presence’ is the other gift given to us as researchers (2007:28). 
Some research participants willingly engage with the questions and curiosity of the 
research, responding and sharing their ideas, their lived experiences, attitudes and 
perceptions of the world. However within that exchange there is another form of 
participation, another data set, the silence. Likening this to an unexpected gift that is 
put to one side, Mazzei (2007, 2010) poses that this gift is worthy of further 
examination as this gift could be the one element that in research, my research, helps 
me to discover, reveal and open up new spaces. Needless to say the silence I 
experienced which I placed in the ‘empty data-set’ has resulted in further lines of 
enquiry and in fact more challenging ponderings and provocations. It is these new 
spaces that Koro-Ljunberg (2016: 102) suggests are revealed when one ‘commits to 
continuously reinventing, revising and reenvisioning methodologies’. By doing this the 
silence encountered can be understood to be a present-absence. 
 
3.11 Power Plays. 
 
As discussed previously in the review by Leat, Lofthouse and Reid (2014) the idea of 
relationships, personal capabilities, and interestingly, trust, are offered as constraints 

 
115 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
to teachers carrying out research. Reflecting on the challenges and dilemmas of the 
pilot study the importance of relationships and trust was a main theme, an encounter, 
which became apparent in the post- pilot phase and study. In considering the ways 
forward, and in an attempt to problematise my researcher experience, questions come 
that relate to this focus. I was left wondering, what the link is between professional 
trust and professional identity. How do the socio-emotional elements of professional 
identity emerge to be able to impact, either positively or negatively, on the process of 
planning and designing research? What is it that results in the gatekeeper opening the 
door to allow the researcher to complete their enquiry? How much influence does the 
gatekeeper have on how that enquiry is carried out? I recognised initially the issue of 
power at play in the relationship between researcher and research participant, 
researcher and gate-keeper, gate keeper and research participant. This reflects a 
dominant discourse which is well documented, (Moss 2017), namely power is often 
perceived as a possession, held by those in power, which those who are powerless 
try to seize from their control. From this dominant perspective, when considering the 
adult researcher, and the child as a research participant, it is the adult who is 
positioned as the expert and ‘has power’, and who ultimately ‘bestows power’ through 
their choice of research methodology on the child. This is difficult to eradicate 
(Alderson and Morrow 2011, Bucknall 2012, Kellett 2005, 2010). In the pilot study, 
somewhat naively, I had the confidence and determination of the benefits of adopting 
a pedagogy of empowerment. My naiveté was not placed in the children’s 
competences but in the acceptance that the adults who were in a position of allowing 
research to go ahead shared the same beliefs as me. Naïve too as, at that stage, I 
assumed that power was something to be given and, or, taken, and did not yet 

 
116 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
understand Foucault’s idea that ‘power is everywhere and comes from everywhere’ 
(1980, 2004). 
 
Reflecting post pilot study, post ‘event’, demands that I review and reflect upon the 
role of the gate-keeper and reconsider my own perspectives of power and 
relationships, using Foucault who challenged the dominant perception of power as an 
object held and bestowed. When negotiating access to children for the pilot study I 
became increasingly aware that the role of the gatekeeper was all about the play of 
power in the setting. Consent and approval became important aspects of the research 
itself.  The ability to allow me to fulfil my research interests, and go on to allow the 
children to become researchers in their own right, remained firmly fixed with, and was 
a decision to be made by, the gatekeeper.  However post pilot study ‘event’ I seek to 
understand and am curious to explore further the impact of the idea, from a 
Foucauldian perspective, that power is everywhere and that in this research context it 
pervades the school community, within the actions and accepted ways of being 
present . Thus power diffuses and reflects the rhizomatic nature of the inter-
relationships between identity, power, and indeed situated ethics. Therefore my 
emerging ideas, to be contemplated and explored, relate to a play of power as a 
strategy to be performed and that people, and relationships, are the place whereby 
power is enacted and resisted (Foucault 1976, 1980).  
 
Hammersley and Trianou (2014) draw further on the work of Foucault by considering 
the autonomy of the researcher as well as the autonomy of the research participant. 
According to Raaen (2011:628) Foucault considered autonomy to be an ‘illusion’, in 

 
117 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
that the idea of personal autonomy is socially constructed, and that the individual can, 
and will, only follow the agreed rules of the situation. The irony is that the individuals 
believe they have freedom and autonomy. Individuals become constrained by what 
Foucault referred to as ‘regimes of truth’ (Foucault 1980), and that this is also the case 
for professionals in a professional context. The notion of ‘regimes of truth’ relate to the 
dominant discourse that are enacted and re-enacted by society, and groups or culture 
with in that society. Patterns of accepted behaviour, values and beliefs become the 
‘truth’ and are produced and replicated, and learnt by those in that social group. 
According to Foucault ‘Each society has its regime of truth’ (1980), and this was 
certainly the case when I reverted to my dominant identity by behaving as a 
professional teacher. This in itself demonstrates the link between power and 
autonomy, I believed I had the autonomy to be the researcher in the first pilot study 
but responded to the ‘regime of truth’ that dictated my professional behaviours at that 
time.  
 
Within my experiences as a researcher I believe now that I did not have autonomy, 
the decisions that initially I believed to be autonomous decisions were bound as a 
result of the dominant discourses of teacher professionalism that came to the surface 
when carrying out the pilot study. The overwhelming urge to revert to my ‘teacher 
identity’ demonstrated that I was powerless in relation to the strong underlying 
behaviours I was sub-consciously aware of (Reay 2015). As I now align my 
understanding of power at play with Foucault I see the nexus, I see the bearing of the 
school environment and culture and how this impacts on the play, and flow of power 
in any research context. 

 
118 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Moving forward through these reflections on literature reviewed, my new ways of 
thinking become troublesome as I consider their impact on ethics. The question I have 
posed as a result of my ontological shift begins to challenge my ethical approach and 
in particular my consideration of the role of the gate-keeper, which may not have been 
an autonomous role? How can I now understand the place of consent and assent, in 
carrying out research with and by children? I now feel that the values and beliefs of 
those who create/perpetuate the environment within which the norms of behaviour, 
and the conditions of culture are developed, need to be examined further to 
problematise how research with, and by, children is facilitated. I need to consider how 
the values and beliefs of the Head Teachers, or other leaders and managers, are 
established and normalised, what are the origins of this normalisation, and why is there 
an acceptance, or resistance, to the dominant discourse in terms of professional 
identity? 
 
The flow of power and resistance (Foucault 1980) I see now lies within the complexity 
of the relationships between researcher, gate-keeper and research participant, and 
consequently require further consideration. Like Heath, Charles, Crow and Wiles 
(2007) I see I reflect on the tension between the consent practices of practitioners 
working with children and young people and the researchers. Drawing on Huckaby 
(2011) I realise that the power of relations between researcher and research 
participant is not a transfer from one to another but that the ‘fluctuations of power and 
vulnerability are held within the relations at all times’ (2011: 174). 
 

 
119 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
This fluctuation of power and vulnerability can be seen in relation to the pilot study 
whereby the adults, as gatekeepers consenting to or denying access, adopted what 
could be seen as a vulnerable position. Huckaby (2011:177) expresses the relations 
of power and vulnerability like this:                               relations of vulnerability. 
Using Huckaby’s position helps me to interpret the response to requests for access to 
children as research participants. Denial or hesitancy of consent to access children as 
participants could, in light of this, be seen not as the adult holding power and using 
this as an object to denying access, but rather as the vulnerability of adults acting to 
protect the children as research participants from harm.  
 
I am left wondering why, given that teachers know and understand child development 
and have a working, and one would hope theoretical, understanding of the curriculum, 
would teachers not be supportive of young children as research participants and 
importantly as researchers themselves? Is the issue here then not an understanding 
or awareness of children’s abilities, interests, personalities but rather a lack of 
understanding of research itself? Is there a perceived mistrust of research and 
researchers, do teachers see themselves as researchers, does the idea of carrying 
out research intimidate teachers? What do they understand about the skills needed 
and how are those skills understood outside of the academic world away from the 
somewhat foreboding vocabulary and philosophy of what it means to conduct reach? 
Can the role of gatekeepers be better understood by recognising the relationship 
between power and vulnerability? How can I explore these issues further? 
 
 

 
120

3.12 Problematising Research Methodologies. 
 
At this point I want to critique the methodologies I adopted in the pilot. The purpose of 
any pilot study is to check for feasibility and identify any flaws, with the usual intent 
being to make minor adjustments to overcome any issues identified through a review 
to reconsider methods them, unpick their usefulness and effectiveness. Having done 
this, and responded to questions that continue to come to the surface my position now 
is that I am beginning to wonder if my research is participatory and if the 
methodological tools I adopted really ‘empower’ children. As I reflect and replay the 
interactions, drawing on the children’s reviews and evaluations, as well as the silences 
that were part of their experience of being research participants I find myself unpicking 
threads of ideas I did not have at the start of my research journey. 
  
Given my previous discussion, about power relationship at play, and acknowledging 
the influence of Foucault in my developing thoughts, I am now drawn to re-evaluate 
the concept of the participatory nature of the research tools I originally proposed. 
Again, almost apologetically this time, I acknowledge a naiveté in my approach. In my 
eagerness to engage the young children I admit to what Waller and Bitous (2001) and 
Gallacher and Gallagher (2008) warn of, an adult engagement with tools whereby the 
tools become the focus rather than the methodological decisions in using them. The 
benefits of adopting a child friendly, participatory approach, may well be based on 
principles and values and an epistemological position but in practice there is little 
evidence to suggest that through  adopting these research tools researchers are in 
fact able to ‘deliver all that they promise’ (Gallacher and Gallagher 2008:449).  They 

 
121 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
go on to suggest that confidence in children knowing childhood best and being experts 
in their own lives, something I have advocated throughout the planning stage, needs 
to be acknowledged within a context that there are other experts and ways of working. 
I find myself questioning the tools I used within the pilot, noting that Gallacher and 
Gallagher (2008) suggest that by adopting research tools such as drawing and writing 
‘researchers are expressly taking advantage of children’s’ schooled docility towards 
such activity’ (pg.503).I am not alone when reflecting on this; Dalli and Te One (2012) 
examined a range of research involving children by interviewing the researchers and 
critiquing their methodological approaches and drawing on their reflections, many of 
which resonate with mine. These included the space, not just the physical, but the 
impact of social and cultural expectations as well as the space that formed the 
relationship between researcher and participant. Similarly Lather (2006), McWilliam et 
al (2009) and Mazzei (2007) all examine ‘spaces’ and the impact of spaces, physical 
and emotional on what they collectively now deem to be unreliable claims of ‘authentic 
voices’ 
(St 
Pierre 
and 
Jackson 
2014:715), 
through 
the 
use 
of 
participatory/emancipatory methodologies. 
 
I come to this point having further explored literature and ask myself the following 
questions. How much did the researcher have in common and how close was the 
relationship between researcher and the child? The space in which the relationship 
was developed is intriguing; as discussed in section 3.9 (pg 98 ff) when considering 
professional identity, trust forms a central theme. Reflecting on the role of the children 
in the pilot study phase 2, as researchers who were invited to share their findings at 
conference, what was the purpose here? Encouraging children to be researchers in 

 
122 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
their own right was perhaps not uppermost in my aspirations for this activity, with 
hindsight was I taking advantage of the children’s ‘schooled docility’ by creating a 
space for them in an adult world. In doing so was this about demonstrating my 
effectiveness as a researcher or to show their effectiveness? The realisation now is 
that the second pilot study, was based on my professional identity as researcher and 
my research needs, and not theirs. Knowing that colleagues would be supportive and 
welcoming to the children who presented, but the thought remains was this more about 
the novelty factor rather than mutual respect of their research? Does this reflection 
indicate a mistrusting episode, were those children ever going to be treated as 
researchers in their own right or just subjects of my research? Again this reflection 
brings to the surface the need for researchers to examine the adult role in such a 
participatory research methodology. The complexities and ‘messiness’ of adopting 
qualitative research designs were also noted by Dalli and Te Ong (2012) and 
interestingly in one interview the researcher commented on what was termed ‘an 
ecology of trust’ (Pg 227) mirroring my own concerns. Dalli and Te Ong also 
recommend a need to adopt a ‘fitness for purpose approach’ (pp231) which is cited in 
a desire to show respect for participants. When those participants are such young 
children this respect plays out through an awareness of the significance of 
attachments and bonding, giving rise to an ethical approach to include time and 
sensitivity for caring, secure relationships to develop.  
 
Further consideration and problematizing of research by children is offered by 
Bradbury-Jones and Taylor (2015), they aim to support the researcher committed to 
participatory methodology, and to raise thoughts and considerations to avoid what they 

 
123 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
describe as a potential raft of child-led research.  Issues around ethics, methodology 
and pragmatics are discussed, although the solutions they offer do not address the 
challenges from my perspective that are not so much about the child’s role in Children-
as-Researcher projects but are increasingly becoming about the adult role when 
conducting research with and by children. The challenges highlighted by Bradbury-
Jones and Taylor (2013) support and insist that debate happens to ensure that the 
fashion of child-led research is not running away unchallenged and without scrutiny in 
an aura of blind-faith.  
 
According to Bradbury-Jones and Taylor (2015:161) participatory methodologies in 
educational research whereby children’s participation sees them being co –
researchers is said to be ‘de rigueur’. Whilst this trend gathers momentum they argue 
that assumptions that this is indeed in children’s interests and in society’s interest, and 
that Children-as-Researcher projects need to be further critiqued from an ethical, 
methodological and practical perspective.  Furthermore Chae-Young (2016) argues 
for a rethinking of the assumptions made by those interested in research by children 
which is clearly important, however her reflections offered again simply focus on how 
children are perceived by adults in society. She identifies methodological and 
normative assumptions that firstly children are competent to conduct research, that 
they are epistemologically better placed to research their lives and that the research 
enables the child’s right to participation and in doing so they become automatically 
‘empowered’. Conclusions drawn by Chae-Young (2016) suggest that these 
assumptions have limited evidence to support them and suggests a need to explore 
further.  

 
124 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
I would add that there is also an assumption, held by researchers committed to 
participatory and/or emancipatory approaches that other adults and professionals are 
also committed, and that gatekeepers believe in children’s competencies and share 
an epistemological stance that fixes children as being best placed to know and share 
self-knowledge. Reconsideration of research methodologies supporting these 
approaches, including the research tools, epistemological positions, as well as ethics 
and skills needed to conduct effective research is called for. It is at this stage in 
reviewing the literature that I realise how all of these aspects are interrelated, how my 
musings here represent the messiness that is doctoral research and continue to give 
rise to important questions and provocations. 
 
 
3.13 Inter-connectivity and relatedness. 
 
To draw conclusions my review of literature is best considered as a framework of 
interconnectivity and interrelatedness. The aspects considered here are interlinked 
and connected and as such cannot be approached in a linear way. Throughout the 
writing process I have come to realise that not only has this review enabled me to hear 
the previously unspoken questions that have emerged through the pilot study but I am 
now in a position to go backwards positively (and then forwards again), rather than 
simply forwards. This is demonstrating not a lack of progress but rather a more 
rhizomatic way of working, and as such demonstrates a blurring of my methodologies.  
 

 
125 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Classically at the end of the literature review the research questions to be asked are 
stated with confidence, and with equal confidence that the literature review has 
demonstrated, validated and set the context for the key question to be examined.  
However what I have now is no longer a series of questions that come from the original 
aims of the research. Rather I am at a point where my thinking is less linear and more 
holistic. The rhizomatic nature  of my multiple ponderings and reflections that have 
emerged during, and as a result, of this review of literature cannot be straightened out 
and smoothed to form discrete one dimensional questions, but rather in recognition of 
the messiness need to remain ‘dishevelled’ to acknowledge the interrelatedness and 
interconnectivity of my new ways of thinking. In essence then I have become what 
Deleuze and Guattari (1980) identify as an unfixed nomadic subject that is not 
sedentary and as such responds to the movement and spaces between, within, and 
beyond the researcher, the research and the research participants. 
 
To review, I started thinking my research questions would be: 
How might young children be active participants in researching their own 
educational lives? 
How is children’s participation, within the field of education, understood by 
children and other stakeholders? 
 
Having explored these themes in literature, I then planned the pilot study, which 
consequently presented me with the ‘event’ that changed my thinking and gave rise to 
many different thoughts. The subsequent review and dialogue with the literature 

 
126 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
offered and presented above continued to form the provocations discussed in this 
chapter. 
 
Adopting a Deleuzian position the rhizomatic nature of these themes is demonstrated 
in Figure 6 below. It is no longer possible to consider each of these themes in isolation 
for each depends on a relationship with the others, the position of a view in one theme 
will impact on the views within another, this is not just a linear impact but a cyclical 
one that demonstrates the complexities of the place of research in school and 
teachers’ roles in relation to this, as well as Children-as-Researchers projects and the 
perspectives, values and beliefs that teachers have about such initiatives. 
 
 
Figure 6 – Interconnectivity of subjects 
 
The interconnectivity of subjects within this exploration, the adults, the children, the 
researcher, the teacher, the participant, the respondent, and the reviewer need to be 

 
127 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
understood here not only as an indicator of the complexity of the subject but in 
understanding the to-ing and fro-ing of the discussion and emerging ideas. I have 
aimed to demonstrate my shifts in perspective I have taken as part of the review, to 
show not only what others have contributed to the knowledge but to illustrate how by 
interacting with that knowledge I have not only shifted my position but that in doing so 
I have placed my enquiry in a different direction. I am not here explaining the critical 
approaches taken but trying to show how the pathway of emerging and shifting 
thoughts generate a whole different range of ponderings to open up new lines of 
enquiry. Accepting that the review of literature itself is a data-set, and influenced by St 
Pierre (2012), I see my relationship with my secondary sources as the same kind of 
relationship a researcher has with her participants, further evidence of my blurring of 
methodologies. My interpretations and questioning, reflections and ponderings in 
response to those texts and authors contemplated throughout this chapter are not 
though ‘objects of knowledge’ rather, lines of flights that have taken me some where 
new (St Pierre 2014). 
 
My mind has changed as a result of my research and reading so far and I am now 
understanding Patti Lather when she refers to the ‘value of rigorous confusion’. 
(Guttorm, Hohti and Paakari 2014: 16). 
 
The initial questions asked, which I sought to answer and gave rise to the pilot studies 
and the initial review of literature, give way to tiers of asking, multiple ways forward 
and multiple wonderings clambering to be heard and responded to. 
 

 
128 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
So now I am left with asking… 
What place does research play in teachers’ professional lives and what do 
they believe is the relationship between research and their practice? 
How do teachers understand and promote the right of the child to conduct 
their own research? 
How does professional identity impact on teachers seeing themselves as 
researchers? 
What prevents or encourages teachers to carry out research in their 
classrooms? 
How do teachers value the voice of children and how are they responding 
to opportunities for children to become researchers? 
Why is it so challenging for adult gatekeepers to consent to access and 
involvement with research? 
 
My initial focus was children themselves as researchers, with an ontology that they 
were experts in their own lives. Having now reviewed literature and contemplated the 
pilot studies I see now that my focus needs to be on the teachers, to examine and 
understand their position and in doing so clarify the foundation and underpinning 
identities, beliefs about research and the understanding of key stakeholders in school-
based research of Children-as-Researchers. 
 
The next chapter explores this re-orientation, reviewing proposed methodologies and 
plans for the next steps in the journey.

 Finding the Way – Methodological Orientations.

are unpicked and then woven back together to fashion a blurred approach, establishing my 
professional identity as a post-qualitative researcher.

4.1 Introduction. 
 
As indicated in previous chapters the stop/start approach to my research maps the 
emerging trajectory of a qualitative to post-qualitative researcher. I am someone 
initially grappling with feelings of awkwardness and dissatisfaction when adopting 
a conventional humanist qualitative approach who then finds a new confidence 
when using a post-qualitative approach. Again here the thread of professional 
identity becomes apparent; when adopting a reflexive approach I find my new 
professional identity as a post–qualitative researcher. No surprises then, (bear with 
this comment, all will be explained below) that what follows from this point is an 
assemblage of ideas, justifications, values and re-positionings hinted at previously 
and now celebrated with passion and commitment. 
 
4.2 Style, Tone, Presentation. 
 
    Having cautiously adopted a creative approach to the exploration of literature in 
the previous chapter, the compulsion to go further and beyond a traditional 
approach of writing a thesis has been influenced by Honan and Bright (2016). 
When presenting the previous chapter ‘Dealing with Wanderlust’ I initially felt 
uncertain of the responses from my more experienced colleagues who would 
review the emerging ideas I offered when trying to capture my new identity in the 
‘shift or rift’ reflections. At the time of writing the review of literature I was not aware 
of the work of Honan and Bright (2016). Up to that point my tentative exploration 
of Deleuzian philosophy had led to an awakening, an awareness of a lack of 

 
131 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
understanding coupled with the desire to make sense of his ideas. Throughout this 
period of exploration there was/is a sense of a defamiliarisation and inevitability 
that, as MacLure (2013: 661) puts it, equates to a feeling as if ‘we have chosen 
something that has chosen us’. However up to this point I remained uncertain as 
to how, in writing the thesis, I would be able to communicate in a style akin to a 
postmodern, post-qualitative approach, despite the Deleuzian appeal of using 
creativity through language or ideas, not just through an application of language. 
It was Honan and Bright’s (2016) discussion of Deleuze’s suggestion of a ‘spark’ 
breaking out from the shadow of words that crystallises a moment of revelation for 
me as a writer/researcher. Indeed it was/is this spark that ignited a confidence to 
explore with words, with structure, in order to challenge the orthodoxy of traditional 
organisation and approaches to thesis writing that, from this point on I will seek to 
demonstrate, and in doing so continue to affirm/reaffirm my ontological position. 
The multiplicity of my ideas, my thinking and emerging position did not occur, and 
are not reported here, in a linear approach. There is not/cannot be a statement of 
fact, and an argument for/defence of, my philosophical positions. The reason 
being is that these developed, and are developing, as I journey through the writing 
up stage of this study.  
 
    These emerging ideas are indicative of the layers of understanding, the 
assemblages and the messiness of adopting what I now know to be a postmodern 
paradigm and a post- qualitative approach. Exploring with ‘permission’ granted by 
Honan and Bright (2016) to embrace an individualised style in the writing of this 

 
132 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
and subsequent chapters will also enable me to respond to the issue of exclusivity 
of a post –qualitative approach posed by Greene (2013). Careful consideration of 
language adopted when attempting to communicate my emerging ideas is not, for 
me, just an expectation of writing at doctorate level, but will go some way towards 
actively responding to the critique of post-qualitative research offered by Greene 
(2013). Recalling the feeling of being excluded that she experienced when 
exploring post-qualitative ideas for the first time, which I have to say I totally 
empathised with (again the use of informal language here will be explained later). 
Greene (2013) comments on the exclusivity of language adopted in post-
qualitative research and identifies that initial feelings of being blocked from the 
approach arose from a ‘lack of linguistic fluency’ (2013:749).  
 
 
 
When initially introduced to the idea of post-qualitative paradigm my naiveté, and 
my lack of experience, left me feeling that I was essentially encountering ‘The 
Emperors New Clothes’. I was unable to penetrate the complexities of language 
used, of unfamiliar terms, of concepts beyond my experience and comprehension. 
For this reason, and because of it, I was initially cautious in my use of vocabulary, 
not wanting to be accused by those committed to a conventional approach of 
smoke and mirrors, of sleight of hand, of diversion tactics that may result in the 
story of this lived research experience being misunderstood, misinterpreted or 
even worse dismissed. The recognition of ‘dominant discourses, or research 
literacies’ (French 2016:115) explain my initial uncomfortableness in tackling 
something new, for me, that challenged the idea of the ‘best’ way to write a thesis. 

 
133 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
French (2016:216) identified ‘pre and post thesis conceptualisations of academic 
writing’ offering a series of ‘problematised reconceptualization’. (See Figure 7)

To be clear, a desire to do something different with my writing is not just searching 
for an opportunity to challenge the orthodox and rebel against the dominant 
research literacies. As I grow in confidence I am accepting my emerging 
ontological position and becoming more confident with it. I feel able to seize the 
opportunity to illustrate my position through every part of the research design and 
decision making process. 
 

 
134 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
As confidence grew/grows I continue to carefully choose my words but do so in 
order to not only capture meaning, and communicate that, but to offer a glimpse 
into the playfulness that surrounds this exploration of new ideas, reflections and 
ponderings. To this extent I hope the style adopted henceforth will go some way 
to diffuse the complexities whilst at the same time not over simplifying.  
 
 
 
4.3 Different directions – starting at the end, or the middle? 
 
St Pierre (2010, 2013) along with Lather and St Pierre (2013) provoke a 
repositioning of qualitative research arguing that the development of a ‘posts’ 
movement is as a result of the desire and need to produce different ‘knowledges’, 
and to do so differently from traditional qualitative research methods /paradigms . 
These 
differences challenge tightly 
held 
and 
valued 
ontological 
and 
epistemological positions in qualitative research. Embracing these differences, for 
me, has enabled a presentation of methodological decisions mirroring the shifting 
and changing conceptual positions I adopted/adopt throughout the transformative 
process of this doctoral journey, and continue to demonstrate my blurring of 
methodologies.  
 
When attempting to structure this discussion about my methodological approaches 
taken in the study, I was initially drawn to a variety of texts offering advice and 
presenting the traditional qualitative approaches to thesis writing. As I indicated in 

 
135 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Chapter 3: Dealing with Wanderlust adopting a linear, traditional qualitative 
approach would contradict both my need to keep the research creative and to 
remain within a post paradigm. Linearity would also limit the opportunity to reflect 
on how the ideas, perceptions, provocations and questions arose throughout the 
data gathering period. Adopting a creative approach was key to achieving a 
coherent design approach for the whole thesis.  
 
Deleuzian lines of flight are multiplicitous, marking the interrelatedness between 
and beyond concepts, and which at the start appear messy and lacking clarity. 
They influence the decision-making process that this chapter will attempt to 
examine and explore. The discussion will not be just about the description and 
justification of approaches but rather how the implementation of approaches 
selected enabled me to ask further questions, ideas and uncertainties, to be 
explored. An organic approach rather than a linear approach will enable 
epistemological and ontological positions to come to the forefront as I make links 
between methodology and methods. This will enable me to explore the organic 
character of the processes as it becomes apparent. Unpicking lines of flight, 
identifying where inter-sections lay and drilling down to examine why and how they 
have emerged  allows for key junctures to be acknowledged, and is what Deleuze 
(1990:141) identifies as the moment to ‘see and think what was lying in the shadow 
around the words’. 
 

 
136 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
4.4 Challenging Orthodoxies. 
 
As a doctoral learner-researcher my expectation was to learn from experienced 
and expert others who have trodden the path and successfully completed and 
defended a thesis. In short I expected to adopt what Deleuze and Guattari (1986) 
in Colebrook (2002) call the ‘major language’, the dominant discourse of thesis 
writing. Lecercle (2002) in Honan and Bright (2016) however identifies that through 
adopting a minor literature you become at odds with the dominant discourse and 
that this is a process through which alternative identities may emerge and/or be 
confirmed. In fact the blurring of my teacher and researcher identity is symbolic of 
this approach.  
 
I can refer back to the experience of decentring my teacher identity as examined 
in Chapter 2: The Weary Traveller as an example of this. This concept of a 
decentring of identity, blurring, and layers of revelation, is a significant part of my 
new realisation as a researcher. Through this process of becoming a ‘minor-writer’ 
I slowly came to terms with the fact that this research approach and doctoral 
journey will not result in clarity but rather an opaqueness and complexity where my 
self-identity is inevitably multi-layered. I have realised that the process of 
completing and writing my thesis may not result in clarity and affirmation of intent 
and discovery, but rather a lack of clarity and answers, leading ultimately to more 
questions than at the start of the research. However, this position is not about a 
failure to conclude (O’Donnell 2014 in Koro-Ljunberg 2016) but rather is about a 
re-positioning and re-thinking of the issue of Children-as-Researchers. 

 
137 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Acknowledging the complexity of my emerging position in this way has been 
influenced by Lather’s mistrust of binaries (2006, 2016) and the perceptible 
exclusivity of binary modes of thoughts, which Lather (2006) identifies as being 
dominant in western conceptual frameworks. Gannon and Davies (2012: 75) 
suggest that deconstructive writers, and I would happily use that descriptive mode 
to position myself, tend to resist binaries and unpick them in order to ‘disrupt their 
grip’.   
 
The newness of my thinking and challenge to the orthodox will be/is evident 
through not only the structure and organisation of the chapter but through the 
language I use. Deleuze (1983) and with Guattari (1975) recognise the 
impossibility of attempting to capture the social world and accepts the limitations 
of language. With this in mind I want to reveal and allow my thinking to emerge in 
an active/proactive, and at times reactive manner. I will therefore make use of 
ellipsis, brackets, and pay attention to typology. This is about the ‘look’ of language, 
in its written form and how the ‘look’ can be enhanced so as to better communicate 
other levels of meaning and understanding that goes beyond a simple 
representation of phonemes and digraphs.  
 
Mazzei (2010) explores the possibility of viewing voice in qualitative research. She 
considers how Deleuze’s  work on cinema (1983, 1985) and his concept of ‘image’, 
has influenced her to reconsider a ‘re-imaging’ of voice, to include the silences, the 
context, the befores and afters that all contribute to the ‘speech-act’  (Deleuze 
1985). Mazzei (2010) also assesses the problem of ‘voice’ in qualitative enquiry 

 
138 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
and how it has been presented as being ‘authentic’. She sets out to problematise 
the idea of voice that is assumed to be captured by the qualitative researcher, by 
questioning what else is being communicated by stuttering, pauses, silences and 
omissions. This analytical linguistic approach will be explored later, (5.5 pg 175 ff 
Critical Analytical Framework.), and will help to provide a framework for my 
analysis of primary data gathered in the study. Accepting the importance of 
capturing, recording, re-presenting and interpreting/re-interpreting ‘voice’, is a key 
aspect of my data analysis that will follow in the ‘Going off the beaten track...’ 
sections of my analysis in Chapter 6: Well-trodden trails and off the beaten track. 
Pg. 190ff. 
 
At this point in the testimony of the study it is my voice which is being heard, my 
identity, blurred though that may be, that is to be explored. To enable the ‘voice’ of 
the researcher, to be understood, considered and made visible, consideration of 
the language used in this written piece, through contemplation of typological 
decisions, will offer a further layer to the multi-dimensional perspectives that form 
the methodology. The form of presentation used in the previous chapter to 
demonstrate the shift in my thinking through changes in style, font, size and colour 
will once again be adopted. 
 
 
So having indicated, and somewhat cautiously inferred at various points above,  
that I would be presenting my own way of expressing myself I’ll try to explain this 
through sharing some of the ideas offered by, yes you’ve guessed it, Honan and 

 
139 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Bright (2016). You will have seen the ‘major language’ in my introduction and 
certainly the first part of my literature review, and then subsequent passages 
making use of brackets, rhetorical questions, alliteration and rhythm of language, 
similar to the attempts I make here. These provide a platform for a discussion about 
the use of what Honan and Bright (2016: 736) term, ‘vehicular’ and ‘vernacular’. 
Vehicular describes the orthodox style and use of language in a thesis which is 
formal, concise, structured, and objective. Whilst ‘vernacular’ is a style that is 
informal, which speaks to the reader, and is subjective and lyrical.   Reconsidering 
the position Honan and Bright offer takes me to a place where I don’t have to be 
‘vehicular’ or ‘vernacular’, recognising my suspicion of binaries (Lather 2006, 
2016). 
 
The liberty of not having to always be the formal academic adopting and playing 
the academic dance of what it is to produce a doctoral thesis, I can be myself, 
adopting whatever identity feels right at any time and in so doing I embrace the 
multiplicity of what professional identity means (again I refer you back to section 
3.8 remember the blue font?.........). I’m neither being journalistic, as I often criticise 
my undergrads of being (maybe it’s time to stop doing that?) nor am I hiding behind 
a shroud of convoluted academic language. I have given myself permission to take 
on different academic identities in my writing to reflect my rejection of the linear, 
stylised approach of a traditional thesis.  My Weary Traveller chapter developed 
out of the time on this journey of discovery, being thwarted and pushed back, by 
the silence that was heard from potential participants in their declination to the 
invitation to take part, by ambiguity and getting nowhere fast. Whilst not a story 

 
140 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
teller I am reminded of the power of narrative, and when I consider the narrative of 
my research journey I see the stopping and starting points, the short resting points 
and the long stop overs that reflect the journey travelled. I am trying to achieve a 
revelation of my research journey that reports on a new way of thinking, particularly 
about methodologies and offers a blurring of methodological approaches. The 
mutable styles adopted throughout this thesis will articulate my rhizomatic ontology 
– that is an overlapping of meaning, of questions and answers, and questions left 
unanswered.  
 
 Honan and Bright (2016) offer suggestions that the inclusion of literature, poetry, 
images and sounds in research can elicit discourses of understanding. Whilst I 
have referred to Classic English literature within my Epi-Prologue, the capacity of 
expression through these other forms remain limited; words and text, and 
tentatively images, remain a preference for me in presenting and re-presenting the 
complex decision making processes that occurred as the project reported in this 
thesis evolved.  
 
4.5 Re- thinking and Re-Presenting Positionality. 
 
Through the process of revealing the layers of understanding and questioning the 
spaces that this thesis opened up, I struggle to find a way that will be seen as 
coherent, strong, well-argued, original in knowledge-seeking and knowledge-found, 
that will  meet the requirement of  a traditional doctoral study. I want to create not 
just a record of the research but a way to evidence my thinking, illustrating how that 

 
141 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
thinking has developed. The end result is that I get to a level, according to my peers, 
whereby the title Doctor can be given. I recognise that this thesis is more than an 
assessment to meet academic benchmarks or a product that conforms to agreed 
conventions. I remind myself, that the origins of the word “thesis” comes from the 
Greek tithenai, meaning “to place” or “to position”. My thesis is my position, my point 
of view, my stance on the complexities of Children-as-Researchers and, as I 
concluded having reviewed the literature, my stance in relation to the role of 
teachers, research and children, and the revealing of the new spaces between 
them.  
 
Consequently having illustrated in previous chapters how my Post-Qualitative 
position has emerged, is emerging, I need now to explore that realisation. In doing 
so it may be that I do not just offer discussion and debate, critiquing and justifying, 
but rather as I review the emergence of this stance I draw on a reflective analysis 
of my initial research proposal, offer findings and events from pilot studies and 
thereby to some extent offer analysis and interpretation of data. The layers of this 
study will continue to be related and interrelated; what at first appears to be a 
chapter on methodology soon becomes an exploration of findings in relation to, 
and analysis thereof, the initial methodology, a deconstruction to demonstrate the 
development and emerging new (er) -methodologies and methods that were 
adopted to gather subsequent data. And in doing so I present a blurring of 
methodologies that leads to an enquiry of new spaces between: 
 
Children– Research-Teachers. 

 
142 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
4.5.1 Beginning, middle…..end…. 
 
So as I struggle to consider the representational value of language, the limitations 
of the language/material binary that St Pierre (2013) notes, I become aware that 
from the start I am trying to do so sequentially, there is it 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 
now 4.5.1. I clearly cannot move away from my training as a conventional humanist 
qualitative researcher. I recall Elizabeth Adams St Pierre’s commitment to a 
qualitative approach in the 1980s and how her doctoral study, like mine, as being 
the moment of realisation, rejecting a conventional humanist qualitative 
methodology, a coming to recognise the contradiction of the approach in terms of 
her ontological and epistemological claims. Initially I went through that weariness 
and confusion without knowing (is that the right word?) that an alternative to the 
dominant discourse of qualitative research existed…if indeed ‘exists’ is the right 
word??? This is why my journey of the deconstruction of my initial methodology is 
necessary. I am like St Pierre.  
 
Reading, reading, ….and reading; layers of learning, layers of messy chaos at times 
bewildering and then momentarily flickers of light as I recognise myself in her story, 
and I find connectivity in her  deconstructions and recommendations for new lines 
of inquiry. 
 
St Pierre (2013) argues for any doctoral student to start with the theory, to ensure 
there is no disconnect between theory and methodology, on her recommendation 

 
143 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
(can I view this relationship now as mentor/mentee I wonder?)…. I have found the 
methodology of conventional humanist qualitative research, in my case, to be 
wanting and inadequate for my purpose. Moving on I see myself trying to bring to the 
foreground the ontological and epistemological commitments of post-qualitative 
analysis, trusting that studying the theory will enable the methodology to follow. 
However, initially the journey of this study began at a different point, starting with 
different epistemological frameworks and to an extent avoiding the complexities of a 
post-qualitative ontology. No doubt influenced by my earlier Cartesian learning 
experiences, both taught, and reinforced by government policy, and the dominant 
expectations in society both in academic cycles, and from a personal perspective,  
familial. “But what are you trying to prove in this research???” asks Dad? 
 
On reflection I see now that I started in the middle, returning to the beginning, 
revisiting the middle, progressing not towards an end point but a rest point. In itself 
living what Deleuze (1980) suggests is this rhizomatic analysis of the social world, 
the social world that in this case was …and is… my research experience. In dialogue 
with Deleuze I understand this to be my ‘ontology of becoming’, a belief in what could 
be and what has not yet been thought of (Deleuze and Guattari 1991).  I see that at 
the ‘start’ of the project I showed little attention to ontological consideration, focusing 
on epistemological decisions. Again knowing now that this was indeed my built in 
and trained response to focus on a Cartesian way of thinking. My first ever piece of 
(undergraduate) research in 1980s set the path for my thinking and lay tacit 
foundations which remain at the bedrock of my research journey. To ignore them is 

 
144 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
challenging, head-aching and distracting. ‘This is why I think ontology is so hard to 
think’ (St Pierre 2014:650). 
4.5.2  Neither….Becoming. 
 
I remind myself and others again of Maggie MacLure’s consideration of data 
acknowledging that in a materialist ontology data cannot be seen as an inert and 
indifferent mass waiting to be in/formed….., in the same way I feel that my 
acceptance of a post approach was not based on decisions at the beginning but 
rather decisions in the middle, the end and the beginning – can I be bold enough 
to say that  the uncomfortableness of deconstructing my initial methodology 
when it seemed not to be working enabled a revelation that there was indeed 
something else out there waiting for me? Lather (2013) identifies a schema of 
methodologies which she calls Qual 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0, outlining the 
development of qualitative research. This is summarised in Figure 8  and will be 
useful as the deconstruction of initial methodological approaches will depend on 
these. 
Qual 1.0
Traditional humanist inquiry, a humanist Subject with authentic 
voice, transparent descriptions of lived experiences, better methods 
can get closer to the truth 
Qual 2.0
Multiple realities and voices, reflexivity and empowerment - 
grounded in humanist concepts of language and knowledge. 
Regulated design  processes 
Qual 3.0
Beginning to use Post –Modern theories – about inquiry, voice, data, 
interpretative mixed methods – this is normalized. 
Qual 4.0
Becoming – in a Deleuzian sense 
Not tidily described in text books 
Beginning to do it differently wherever we are in our projects

Being open to all possibilities, in the Deleuzian sense, during the pilot study 
period meant that the momentary happenstances with subjects, with language, 
with feelings and with disturbances of thought awakened new ways of thinking. 
It wasn’t that I was on ‘the lookout’ (Deleuze and Parnet 1977) but questions and 
ponderings came to the forefront of a reflexive experience. Greeting these 
troubles as opportunities for new ways of thinking in effect became, after a time, 
a long time, a ‘kind of method’ as McCoy (2012) comments. Having noticed these 
unexpected encounters brought about a new realisation that my previously realist 
(maybe critical realist) ontology was problematic, not least in the insistence that 
ontology and epistemology require definition and delineation.  Subsequently I am 
drawn to Barad’s (2003) concept of ethico -onto-epistem-ology which she uses 
to explain how the inter-relatedness of thinking about what is in the world, and 
how we know about things in the world, are continually determining the other. 
According to Barad we cannot think about epistemology without, or separate to, 
ontology, (nor can we separate out ethics – which will be discussed later 5.7 
Ethical Tourism – Respectful, Responsive, Research/er pg.185 ff). This is not 
just about recognising that language is fluid, but that consequently thinking about 
things, as we do by being dependent on language, means that those ‘things’, 
those subjects, are also fluid. The idea of ‘things’ being resistant to 
representation is well established by Bennett (2010) who also offers the idea of 
the ‘thing- power’ whereby objects in society are not just definable by the 
dominant discourses that society employs to make sense of them but that the 
‘vibrant matter’ of ‘things’ have a power to shift and to challenge that dominant 
discourse when they interact with the subject. If this is the position taken it follows 

 
146 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
therefore that materiality too is not stable; as things emerge in the world they are 
both shaped by what we know, and material, simultaneously. This New-
Materialism that Barad (2007) advocates offers an understanding of reality that 
can be said to be about matter and meaning  ‘becoming’, in that  
  
Matter does not pre-exist discursive practice, rather all becoming 
  
is ‘material-discursive’, with neither prior to the other, happening 
  
simultaneously as the world is enacted rather than pre-existing, 
  
then  known or even shaped by particular ways of knowing.  
  
(McCoy 2012:766). 
 
And here, another smile, recognising that in this thesis, which was initially bound 
by everything qualitative, interpretivist and constructivist, I am now ‘in dialogue’ 
with the work of a particle physicist, with whom I would have confidently said I 
had nothing in common. However this is just further proof of the plasticity of 
identity as I recognise that this in fact may be true of my old ‘I’ liberal, humanist, 
unitary identity but the new ‘I’ that emerged/emerges/will emerge as part of thesis 
now has more in common with Karen Barad and Jane Bennett. The significance 
of identities again becomes apparent. 
 
4.6 Deconstructing Conventional Methodologies/Orthodoxies  
 
The initial aims of this enquiry were: 
  
To describe and analyse the origins of, and context to, children’s 
  
right to participation in education 
  
To explore how to actively involve children as co-researchers in 
  
investigating their participation in their educational lives. 

 
147 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
  
To elicit children’s views of their right to participation in education. 
 
Through asking the questions: 
  
How might young children be active participants in researching 
  
their own educational lives? 
  
How is children’s ‘participation’ within the field of education,  
  
understood by children and other stakeholders? 
 
As anticipated the event (Derrida 1994) of the pilot project proved to be the 
turning and re-setting point of the research. This beginning again (Said 1978 in 
Pryke et al 2003) in part triggered by emotional responses of disturbance, 
desolation, demotivation and disheartenment which I can see now as an 
opportunity – in itself the troubles and puzzlements of the pilot study led to a re-
examination of the proposed methodology. At this point I want to use the term 
deconstructing but in doing so I am cautious that my approach will not in its 
entirety do what Derrida (1967a, 1967b) named as deconstruction. The language 
used in the proposal was the language at my disposal and within my 
understanding at that time. In deconstructing the text of the proposal I can 
demonstrate how my ontological perspective was subsequently troubled. That is 
not to say that if the study had been carried out as planned and designed it would 
not have been successful in a conventional humanist qualitative way. I may have 
answered the questions posed and would have offered knowledge and findings 
to warrant the successful examination and be awarded the title Doctor. However 
to listen to and recognise those troubles, and to respond to them, demonstrates 

 
148 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
what Deleuze (1991:141) means when he suggests that ideas are being hidden 
in the ‘shadow of words’. 
 
From here on then, I offer this reflection and process of peering into the shadows 
as a data set (what is data?) with analysis. I will share my initially proposed 
methodological ideas and attempt to classify and interrogate before offering a 
summary of the new-now rather than the old-now. 
 
 
4.6.1 Old now (then). 
 
The continuation of this, if a label is necessary, documentary analysis of the Form 
9R proposal, will attempt to be presented , through images, as an interactive 
moment – however once the text is finalised in the writing of the comments, 
reflections and analysis it becomes not now but rather then. In trying to capture 
the movement and the speed of continuity of thought I drew upon the use of 
‘comments’ facility as part of the word processing application; the reason for this 
is that the comments remained hidden from view until a ‘spark’, a ‘line of flight’ 
(Deleuze and Guattari 1980) becomes apparent.  I recognise though that when 
presenting the analysis of the proposal I cannot capture that process in the 
moment; for this reason the series of images that grab that moment in time are 
offered, not in a complete linear and systematic analysis of the Form 9R 
methodology but as snapshots of emerging ideas hidden in Deleuze’s ‘shadow 
of words’.  

 
149 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
The images that follow are taken directly from the proposal of the initial project. 
This approach is part of my continuous exploration of visual communication my 
journey and, at this moment, begins to take on a significance that, as yet I cannot 
quite articulate effectively, except to say this is something that may need to be 
revisited later…… 
 
I have taken some paragraphs into the shadow of the proposal, not to eliminate 
sections that may be deemed irrelevant but to demonstrate their importance in 
the background and how as a holistic document this was, then, my starting point, 
although for me as a post-qualitative researcher not necessarily the beginning.  
 
For me this illustrates the way the new blurred methodology and all its 
possibilities were/are there, hidden until I found them. The possibilities 
weren’t/aren’t there in relation to me, I did not impact on them and then they 
became a reality, but rather they existed/exist alongside my lack of 
understanding and awareness.  
  
As with most journeys of doctoral study the proposal comes after a period of 
study of research methods. I undertook this, to be honest, with a degree of 
interest but not openness. My perspectives at the time were fixed in a 

 
150 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
conventional qualitative world, fully committed to interpretivist beliefs and an 
understanding that reality was created by the interaction of the subject and 
object, and whilst not generalizable would be relatable. In my case relatable to 
those who held the same values and beliefs about children, voice and 
emancipatory/participatory research.  
Hidden in the shadows though are the emerging post –qualitative beliefs, the 
contradiction and the urgency in trying to communicate a multi-layered approach, 
a recognition of the rhizomatic nature not just of the complexities of the 
methodology designed but rather the inter-relatedness of questions, 
uncertainties and contradictions of the task ahead. 
For confirmation this process is not about discovery but rather, again an 
illustration of my ontological (onto-epistem-ology) perspective

4.6.2 New-Now (now and then…). 
 
To offer a summary here as a rest point, I offer these ponderings as an illustration 
of my ongoing ontological (onto-epistem-ological) position. At the time of 
beginning (not yet becoming), the pilot offered a defined methodology. I didn’t at 
the time have the language (although I had some vocabulary) to communicate 
what I felt I wanted to explore, or what I needed to explore (the emotive 
connection here, for me cannot be discounted). This is not to say I didn’t have 
the desire or the thinking of how and what I wanted to create. I would argue that 
the thinking of a post-qualitative approach was there but the lack of theory that I 
had at my fingertips at the time resulted in an inability to formulate and 
communicate my thinking. This inability was/is in relation to myself and my own 
knowing, as well as in relation to more experienced researchers and colleagues 
both through the process of initial supervision and through the evidencing of 
recognised academic standards by the rigorous process of completion and 
interrogation of 9R. In attempting to capture a collection of my thinking the 
following figure will demonstrate the evolving methodology and how I found/am 
finding my way (Figure 9).

RJLowe  
 
 
 
Ontology
Initially an ontology, (if at all) of Parmenidean ‘being’. There is a clearly 
formed, stable, entity of Children-as-Researchers to be revealed 
 
Heraclitean  Becoming 
Formlessness Chaos 
Interpenetration 
Silence (Gray 2013) – these will be important concepts to return to 
Epistemology
Constructivism – truth and meaning exist created by subjects 
interaction  with the world  in this case: 
Children-as-Researchers and their rights defined by the research world 
and community – in response to  e.g. UNCRC, agreed and proffered 
from the move by adults to empower and enrich children lives, promote 
democracy which in turn is created by /socially constructed by the adult 
community 
 
Subjectivism – meaning of the world does not emerge through the 
interaction of the subject i.e. children and the world (adults/teachers). 
But rather that the meaning of the subject is imposed on it by the world 
though a collective unconsciousness, dreams, and religious beliefs – 
could this also be professional identity???? 
Theoretical 
Perspective 
Interpretivist –interpretations of the social world – differing to natural 
world (science) 
 
Phenomenology – grounded in social reality, allowing the phenomenon 
to speak for itself – tendency toward ethnographic approach research 
club , participant observers – research club, exploration of overriding 
understandings 
Naturalistic inquiry – evolving more questions than answers, multiple 
realities, and phenomenon explored in situ –participant observations – 
research club. 
Elements of Critical inquiry – challenges conventional social structures 
– research children to support them in becoming empowered, making a 
change for selves, making a change to adults’ perceptions of them.  
 
 
Post-Modernism – rejects emancipation, reject therefore critical inquiry, 
emphasising ‘multiplicity, ambiguity, ambivalence and fragmentation’ 
Gray 2013: 28. Discourse analysis of survey to expose and deconstruct 
values within them – not to see reality of world in that data but rather 
how meanings are produced and presented in that data – becoming. 
Research 
Methodology 
Phenomenological – emphasis on inductive collection of data, pick up 
themes, grounded theory – research club, interviews with stakeholders 
interviews with children provide thick descriptions of experiences and 
perspectives in natural settings- not just school  initially – school, club, 
other ages and activities outside of school experience. Qualitative 
analysis of data. Case study approach need to refute criticisms of 
generalizability 
 
 
Post qualitative – Exploration of data including the empty set, the 
silences and the emptiness, giving rise to connections, rhizome 

 
156 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
analysis of inter-relatedness. Not linear coding but connections, 
‘assemblage’ and emerging ideas. A growing, moving, organic and 
‘living’ awareness of future and past connections – recognition of the 
need to go back to enable a move forward and examine the 
professional identity of teacher.  Disentanglement not to straighten out 
but to see the ripples and waves, in examining the concept of Children-
as-Researchers. 
 
Not using theory the ‘rhizone’ Deleuze and Guattari’s (1980) to collect 
data, or to create a data gathering tool but rather to think with a 
rhizomatic approach to analysing data.  
Discourse analysis of questionnaire responses – not coding but 
through establishing network of concepts, seeing the future 
configurations of professional identity, understanding of the nature of 
educational, practice based research, Children-as-Researchers, 
children’s voice and agency. 
Data Gathering 
Tools 
Participant observations,  
Child focus group interviews, 
Adult (teachers and parents) semi-structured interviews - as part of 
research club experience. 
Expert interviews – leading stakeholders, local and national. 
 
 
Analytical Survey to gather perceptions, views, and understanding of 
the place of research in contemporary classrooms, the role children 
have as research participants, the role teachers have in research. 
Consideration of literature and writing processes as an integral part of 
any data set. 
Analytical 
approach 
Adopting coding procedures offered by Strauss & Corbin (1990) and 
Flick (2014) will ensure rigour of analysis. Coding – ongoing and 
cyclical. Similarities, differences and regularities in the data can be 
identified. 
Themes that emerge in one dataset, for instance focus group 
interviews will require constant comparison (Johnson and Christensen 
2008) within and between datasets. 
 
 
Adopting Deleuze Rhizomatic analysis – lines of flights, ‘centrifugal’ 
forces

5.1 Mapping, plotting and signposting. 
 
In both the previous chapters ‘Dealing with Wanderlust’ and ‘Finding the Way’ I have 
shown how my ontological stance emerged/is emerging. With each chapter I review 
the points of my re-positioning that illustrate how the design of the research came 
about, with my identity as a researcher ‘becoming’ more evident as I interact with the 
research design. As outlined in Chapter 2: The Weary Traveller which featured the 
impact of the pilot study, identified as the ‘event’ (Derrida 1994, Zizek 2014), my first 
attempts were designed to explore the concept of Children-as-Researchers. However, 
I was initially lost amidst the contradictions and false starts, finding myself surrounded 
by silence. Nevertheless in dialogue with, St Pierre (2010, 2012, 2013, 2014), Lather 
(2006, 2013, 2016), and Mazzei (2007), I have been encouraged through their 
profferings, ponderings and provocations to engage more with Giles Deleuze (1925 – 
1995). It is at this point on the journey that I begin to feel refreshed, reinvigorated, 
having rested and considered tracks taken so far. In finding my feet, and finding my 
way, I need to create a map to see the potential in the landscape, and to determine 
which trails to follow, and to see where those trails cross, connect and combine. 
 
 
5.2 Uncharted Territories 
 
As I explored/am exploring Deleuze and the ‘ontology of becoming’ I appreciate that 
as opposed to a conventional humanist qualitative approach there is not one way of 
doing post-qualitative research. Creative approaches and ways of data-gathering 

 
160 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
include, images (Lenz 2016), videography (Higgins 2014), incidental conversations 
(Berad 2017 in Higgins et al 2017), to name a few. Being trained both in conventional-
humanist-qualitative approaches, and indeed as an Early Years practitioner, my skill 
set includes questioning, interviewing, talking, probing, verbal interactions, and not 
photography, painting, images, dance or drama. That being said I make no apologies 
for the conventional approaches to data gathering adopted, which will be shared in 
subsequent sections. Indeed St Pierre (1997), Jackson and Mazzei (2012) and Mazzei 
(2013) also use conventional methods - interviews and ethnographies, and in dialogue 
with them I focus on the mode of analysis rather than the tool adopted. When adopting 
a Deleuzian approach to my research I am cautions of not being criticised for just using 
the metaphors, vocabulary and style of phrase. I am thinking with Deleuze, anticipating 
that through analysis, I will potentially think previously un-thought questions and 
knowledge.  
 
 
Fair to say at this time, now/then..??? I am still uncertain of the approach to be taken. 
I need to immerse myself further and did so/am doing so/will do so, as the survey was 
designed, and questionnaires analysed and as those ‘lines of flight’ emerged/emerge 
though consideration of multiple possibilities. At a later stage I recognised a need to 
review again policies and literature which came about having completed that analysis, 
for now though that is in the yet to come, another indication of the to-ing and fro-ing of 
this rhizomatic approach to analysis. Again I am accepting that I am in the middle of it 
all, but will return to the beginning of the thesis, before/after reaching the end or rather 
what I am starting to recognise was/is/will be a resting place, before the next line of 
flight.  

 
161 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The consideration of how, for example, to determine what to ask, how to phrase, how 
to enquire, how to ‘de/sign’ (Higgins et at 2017), an effective questionnaire will be/was 
influenced not just by previous conventional skills, but by the previously un-thought 
questions that emerged following the initial piloting of the survey - which now I would 
rather call phase, of the research; and notably through a subsequent wider 
examination of literature.  To reposition these previously un-thought-thoughts at this 
point is helpful. By taking each provocation I will explore what influenced the de/sign 
of the questionnaire before moving on to discuss how the initial engagement with 
responses to the survey enabled me, to adopt a Deleuzian approach of ‘rhizome’ 
analyses. 
 
 
5.3 Surveying Topographies of Practice. 
 
Given that I was/am familiar with how effective carefully crafted questionnaires can be 
in qualitative research methods, I had/have a confidence in their design. This time 
however I was acutely aware of the data that I desired to collect and where that might 
come from. I had come to the position of now wanting to focus on teacher perspectives, 
views and beliefs about research with children. As explored previously, ( 4.6.2 pg. 154 
ff.), the continuous closing of doors, empty data sets and ‘data-fog’ that had been part 
of the first phase of the research had, through adopting a Deleuzian approach, given 
rise to previously unthought –thoughts.  
 

 
162 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
My initial starting point was the children. However having reviewed literature and 
reflected on the pilot study/first phase I began to see/see now that I need to explore 
and clarify the foundation and underpinning identities, beliefs and understanding of 
teachers as key stakeholders in school based research. I cannot understand the 
concept of Children-as-Researchers without examining the place of research in school 
and how the adults, teachers, perceive the idea of Children-as-Researchers.  I form 
the idea that Children-as-Researchers can only be understood in relation to adults as 
researchers, not as binary opposites, either /or, but as interrelated actors/players.  
 
The questionnaire to explore these new spaces was put together not so much as to 
gather data as that would assume there was stability at play (Jackson and Mazzei 
2012)  but rather as a tool to produce it (Johansson 2017). For this reason open ended 
and closed questions were included, questions to gather material (not data) for 
example, about professional backgrounds and qualifications as well as job roles and 
previous experiences of research, in addition to how Teachers –as- Researchers may 
have included children in research. Furthermore participants were asked to rate 
various skills and tendencies in relation to research skills and teaching skills. The 
broad approach to style of questions was taken in an attempt to be accessible to a 
wide range of teacher professionals who would have a variety of interests and time 
constraints.   
 
 
The silence in response to involving teachers and educational professionals from a 
variety of schools as part of the first phase of this research influenced the design of 
this questionnaire. I had called upon professional and trusting relationships to be able 

 
163 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
to gain access to schools in order to develop ‘Research Club’, and as discussed in the 
Chapter Two: ‘The Weary Traveller’ this was met with varying success. At this point in 
the research I was interested in gathering information which I could then analyse to 
see in which direction I would be taken, I wasn’t trying to find a definitive answer but 
did/do want to find a way to respond to the puzzlements that had come into thinking 
as a result of the difficulties of the first phase.  
 
In this second phase I wanted to follow these other lines of flight and think about 
professional identity, to ponder on teachers’ perspectives of their role and the role of 
research, specifically research with children, in relation to their role.  
 
I wanted to try to make sense of the silence that had occurred in Phase 1 of the pilot 
study when trying to gain access to schools to do research with children/pupils and to 
see of how teachers’ perceptions of their professional identity related to this.  
 
Previously my research (French, Lowe and Nassem 2017) had considered what 
teachers gained from the experience of undertaking children as co-researcher 
projects, concluding that teaches who did so gained a new realisation of the 
contribution young children could make to those decisions that impact on them at 
school and elsewhere. For me this suggested a need for further exploration of attitudes 
to the place and purpose of research in teacher education. 
 
Using the Bristol Online Survey (BOS) tool enabled a fast and efficient distribution for 
participants. Accessibility to the questionnaire, which was password protected for 

 
164 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
increased security, was simple. Acknowledging the challenges that I had experienced 
when communicating face to face with Head Teachers during the first phase, and 
indeed the recognition of the multiple demands on teacher’s time warned me and I 
approached the creating of the questionnaire with caution. I was able to draw upon a 
database of Faculty School Partners who worked alongside the faculty in the initial 
training of teachers. 
 
 
And so with bated breath I clicked on ‘distribute’ and waited, and waited and waited. 
And there before my very eyes I became acutely aware of the dominance of a positivist 
research approach,  the nagging inner voice that said ‘but how many will you get?’, 
‘what wonderful graphs you can make with the numbers’, ‘just think, you will be able 
to capture what teachers think’.  Immersing myself again in dialogue with Deleuze, St 
Pierre, Mazzei and McCoy I enquired again…and continue to do so both then and 
now, about data and what that looks like and what you can do/could do with it when 
adopting a Deleuzian approach to analysis.  
 
I play with the word ‘Image’ to test the water and see if this is really what I mean. 
Drawn to Deleuze and the idea of assemblage, a coming together of the messiness 
and complicatedness of matter, I see that ‘image is not quite right, suggesting stability, 
a freeze frame – ‘Image’ just won’t do.   
 
‘Bricolage’ (Deleuze and Gauttari 1972)…… maybe, but in trying to respond to my 
identity that feels ‘already taken’… and I’m looking for newness, having found new 

 
165 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
ways of finding new things.  I like the idea of ‘Collage’ reflecting my early childhood 
professional identity and memories of creative activities with young children, but the 
2-D-ness suggested by the term doesn’t quite fit with idea I have of fluidity, interaction 
and interrelatedness. Taking time and cogitating the use of language, words and how 
they are both used and presented in text allows me to merge this with Deleuze’s (1983) 
thoughts on cinema and his exploration of montage.  
 
I settle with a new term: ‘Graphotomontage’. If somewhere out there this term exists 
then I apologise for claiming it as my own, and stand corrected, however for now this 
feels new and encompasses what I want to communicate. 
 
‘Montage’ meaning collection, whereby images form a blended whole while remaining 
distinct, ‘photo’ referring to the use of images, not being solely reliant on text, and 
‘graph’ relating to the text, the graphemes within and including the font and visual 
representation of that text.  
 
So moving on then to explore my first offering of my ‘Graphotomontage’, and to explain 
why I am positioning it here.  
 
In one sense this might be considered to be aspects of findings and the data-set that 
some might call Survey 1; however this glimpse of  my thinking, and once again using 
writing as a thinking process, Graphotomontage 1  will present a point of consideration 
in the Direction of Travel – to be called:  STOP….Diversion Ahead.  
 

 
166 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
To examine this at this point demonstrates the start-stop of my research journey, the 
messiness and importantly the thinking process behind my evolving methodology. 
 
Graphotomontage 1 – STOP…Diversion Ahead 
 
5.3.1 Diversion Ahead. 
 
In trying to appreciate this encounter with the survey I adopted/adopt a reflexive 
stance, so I am therefore asking and thinking about… 
 
What happened here…………? 
 
What about me…………………..?  
 
How did I influence the product from this experience?  
 
Why silence from so many? 

 
167 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
At this point, now, and then, I’m not measuring the return rate, I’m not thinking 
quantitatively in a scientific manner to measure the success of the questionnaire. I’m 
not aiming to be able to, based on numerical figures, say yes this is a proved result or 
this is a disproved result. I am though ‘noticing the silence’, the empty set. I am 
wondering about the lack of engagement in this concept, in this area of enquiry. I 
wonder if it is just me and the others -writers/academics- who are keen to examine 
and explore the role that children have in research, and not the teachers?   
 
As I reflect, review, reconsider and revisit I attempt to make sense of it all by imagining 
the experience as a whole, mapping out the experience and taking a step back to 
examine the territory, so see how the land lies. My first Graphotomontage shows the 
product of this encounter, and I recognise that in doing so I make my first naïve attempt 
to analyse with Deleuze, the ‘going somewhere’ that follows such an encounter. 
 
I immerse myself in my first Graphotomontage and am led along a path asks: 
 
Do teachers see themselves as researchers? 
 
Do they see the email invitation to participate and think this has nothing to do 
 
with me? 
 
I deliberately sent the email invitations in September, remembering my own feelings 
when I was that primary school teacher at the start of a new school year. I remember 
the sense of optimism at the start of a school year, the feeling that this year I would 
achieve this and that, I would make a difference to this child, that child, those children, 
that family, those families. I would see how the children from the previous year were 

 
168 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
growing, changing, continuing to be curious about the world and everyone in it, 
including themselves and learn about it/them, in awe and wonder. 
 
But that was/is me…albeit some 25 years ago, I wonder how I would have responded 
to an email invitation to participate – would I be one of the few that responded or one 
of the many that ignored? What might have influenced my professional identity, and 
importantly what might be influencing teachers now? 
 
How can I unpick the roots/routes of this response/non response?  
 
 
Looking again at the data in dialogue with Deleuze, I re-focus, not in terms of focussing 
again on the same matter but by changing the lens I look differently at the data 
produced from this initial survey. I re-focus on the few participants who offered me a 
glimpse at their perceptions, values, and beliefs about research in schools and 
children as participants in that research. In trying to make sense of those responses I 
present Graphotomontage 2 in this Direction of Travel to be called STOP…Diversion 
Ahead: Why? Who? What?

Graphotomontage 2 - STOP…Diversion Ahead…’Why, who, what? 
 
                                                                    
My  Graphotomontage 2 above shows how the teachers who responded to the survey 
encounter identified TIME, and resources, both being a barrier to carrying out research 
in schools, ‘with’ and ‘on’ children, resonating with my previous research (French, 
Lowe and Naseem 2017). Seeing TIME repeated again and again triggers a feeling 
that perhaps TIME is also an issue for me. The silence that is the empty set shrieks 
and shouts loudly to me, and makes me listen up and then think about the timing of 
when I sent out the invitation to participate in my research. Maybe the constraints that 
are part of the teacher’s day to day role, the pressures of a start of a new year with 
new targets and new expectations means that few teachers are able to give me their 
TIME to respond to my probing of their attitudes to research? This means that a more 

 
170 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
careful consideration of ‘when’ is essential, if indeed there is another ‘when’. The 
beginning of term would seem not such a good TIME, the end of term similarly may 
be met with fatigue and exhaustion.  
 
Another re-focussing on the data produced draws me to consider the WHO of this 
invitation to participate in the research, again I consider the empty set, the silence in 
the lack of responses. Those who did respond to the survey did so from an individual, 
not a corporate email address. This makes me wonder, who is participating and who 
is not, and why not? 
 
Do the corporate email addresses just link to administrators, bursars, and office staff 
who are tasked with trying to filter the email traffic and have decided not to bother busy 
colleagues with something that may not seem to be directly linked to teaching and 
curriculum? 
 
And then there is the question that grows out of this silence; what place do individual 
relationships between participant and researcher have here? The silence would seem 
to be saying that relationships, friendliness and sensitivity is key, the communication 
from participants who gave me their time suggests a less formal and more relaxed 
approach is the preferred tone, certainly in giving messages but does that also mean 
in receiving messages too? The use of language in these few email communications 
from participant to researcher re-presented in Graphotomontage 2, would indicate a 
tone of camaraderie, of informal humour, relaxed yet respectful. If the silence from 
those who did not respond is saying this to me then I can’t ignore and need to listen 

 
171 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
to it. So the dilemma becomes do I resend the questionnaire having listened to what 
the silence is telling me? I’m not sure, am I being pulled towards the conventional 
humanist qualitative position, not enough data, try again to get MORE. Hushing the 
conventional humanist qualitative voices in my head I return to the responses I had 
received to listen again and try to hear what is being said in silence, in order to make 
my decision. Graphotomontage 3 called ‘A New Pathway?’ re-presents the product of 
the encounter in relation to my questions.

5.4 Surveying Topographies of Practices - further encounters. 
 
Reviewing the initial attempts to engage teachers as participants in my research, not 
just in an attempt to get more responses but as a direct response to listening to the 
silences that had come from the first invitation to participate, I made decisions about 
planning a further encounter/opportunity. Listening to the initial responses I heard the 
eagerness of teachers who wanted to carry out research, I recognised that doing so 
had time sensitivities, and that relationships with me as a researcher was also 
something to be considered.  
 
Listening to this whisperings I made the decision to resend the survey during a half-
term break, six months after the initial distribution. I rejected the idea of making a new 
data-base from the faculty held data-base of Primary and Early Years settings that 
worked with the School of Education. My thinking here was influenced by St Pierre 
(2010, 2014), I did not want to emphasise a Science Based Research approach of 
having a defined data set. I rejected the notion of adopting purposive sampling to justify 
the responses of the participants as being reliable and determined. According to St 
Pierre (2014) the conventional humanist qualitative approach which draws on Science 
Based Research, is ‘monolithic and stifling’ (2014: 3). She advises to forget 
‘normalising humanist concepts’ (2014:10) such as data, and indeed sampling, and to 
start with the theory of analysis, which I will examine in more detail in Section 5.5 (pg 
175 ff).  
 

 
173 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
As St. Pierre suggests her approach is about asking questions that ‘puzzle me’ (St. 
Pierre 2014:3). I commit to a Deleuzian approach to analyse and question the 
relationship between teacher identity, and teachers’ perceptions both of research, and 
of Children-as-Researchers. St. Pierre (2014, 2010, 2012) argues that conventional 
humanist qualitative methodology is incompatible to analysing with, for example 
Deleuze, and given my determination to do this, the idea of purposive sampling was 
not compatible, or indeed necessary in my case as I had accepted/accept that how 
ever many responses received was the ‘right’ number of participants. For this reason 
I used the same data base as before, being confident now with the idea of an empty 
set and being able to analyse something other than just positive active responses. In 
response to my analysis of the silence from the initial survey I felt that I needed to 
restructure the invitation email, opening it up more, communicating in the way that the 
participants who contacted me appeared to prefer. This meant a careful re-crafting of 
the tone, vocabulary, sentence structure and style that I hoped would be more 
inclusive and would recognise the creeping and tentative enquiries about research I 
had previously received and that I felt were whispering to me in responses to 
questionnaire. This in itself was an indicator of an ethical approach to the research 
which will be examined further in 5.7 Ethical Tourism (pg 185 ff). I wanted to also 
acknowledge in the invitation email ( 
Image 8) that TIME was important and that I would be able to respond to their research 
ambitions if that was required.

5.5 Critical Analytical Framework. 
 
With my rejection of a Cartesian positon I have also rejected associated coding of said 
data.  This approach draws on the work of St Pierre and Jackson (2014) who raise 
concerns about: 
analysis that treats words (e.g. participants words in interviews transcripts) 
as brute data waiting to be coded, labelled with other brute words and even 
counted (2014:715).  
 
My preferred approach will not be one of forcing qualitative data, in the conventional 
sense, into quantitative re-presentations. For me the data is not just the completion 
and so-called objective of the questionnaires, but rather the reflection and reflexivity 
of my experience of, encounters with, the actions and interactions associated with the 
process of designing, reviewing, receiving and analysing the questionnaires. For this 
reason I would argue that reflections on the pilot study as outlined in Chapter2: The 
Weary Traveller, and the reflections and reflexivity following the initial communication 
to teachers form not separate discreet data sets but are to be cross-referenced and 
taken holistically as one rhizomatic data set. 
 
Each data set (using the conventional humanist qualitative research vocabulary) 
cannot therefore be seen in isolation but will be poured over, pondered and perused. 
Encoding the data produced through the communications and questionnaires, in order 
to demonstrate clarity and therefore validity is not the point of this analysis. This is 
because the conventional process of coding often results in ignoring the values, the 
unsaid and the living language itself (St. Pierre and Jackson 2014). Mazzei (2012) 

 
176 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
suggests that through coding and separating out the texts, the words, meaning within 
the text become decontextualized and unhinged, suggesting that this results in an 
attempt to smooth out  the data as opposed to a recognition of interrelatedness, 
entanglement and complexity that a post-qualitative approach aims to respond to.   
 
St Pierre and Jackson (2014) promote the idea of starting any process of analysis with 
an understanding of a theory through which to view the data rather than starting any 
analytical process with decisions regarding a specific coding system. They suggest 
that analysing with theory, which for me would be analysing with Deleuze, is difficult.  
 
There is no recipe, no guidance that offers a step by step approach, for this reason at 
this stage of writing I cannot outline the approach I will adopt. Having explored the 
work of those who have offered an insight into a post approach to analysis I will find 
my way of becoming a researcher of this data. The approach I will adopt/did adopt/am 
adopting ‘cannot be easily explained’ (St Pierre and Jackson 2014: 717). I’m reminded 
again of the nature of this thesis in terms of beginning, end, middle, beginning, middle 
and take some comfort in that being in the middle of things, like a rhizomatic approach 
there is no beginning or end (Deleuze & Guattari 1980).  
 
Adopting Delueze’s rhizomatic approach will ensure that I avoid being purely deductive 
and/or reductive with the material data (Martin and Kamberelis 2013:669). My analysis 
will respond to not only what is there but what isn’t, what is said and unsaid, the voice 
and the silence. In doing so it will acknowledge the feelings, the prodding and poking, 
that occurs when exploring the meaning of any data produced.  

 
177 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
For example in Graphotomontage 4, I became particularly focussed on the two emails 
that were returned to me, the use of the emoji and the thinking that led to me 
scrutinising the tone of the emails, from both the participants and then the tone I 
adopted. The idea that this was a new line of enquiry, was worthwhile of thought. As 
MacLure (2013: 612) observes: ‘On these occasions agency feels distributed and 
undecidable, as if we have chosen something that has chosen us”.  
 
 
Graphotomontage 4 – Unforseen Communications 
 
5.5.1 Analysing Approaches…..muddying the waters. 
 
Stepping away further from a conventional humanist approach to qualitative research, 
I recognise that any data from the questionnaires was not generated in isolation from 

 
178 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
the pilot study, nor the initial invitations to participate. McCoy (2012) poses the idea of 
‘encounters’ to explain the inter-relatedness of the methods, the connectivity of data 
and the messiness of doing research this way. As with Davies (2014) and St Pierre 
and Jackson (2014) , McCoy (2012) rejects the idea of a simplistic approach to coding 
data but rather offers what Deleuze (with Parnet, 1977) referred to as ‘being on the 
lookout’, remaining open to the  niggling voice that disturbs and becomes troublesome 
when emerged in the product of enquiries. Similarly MacLure (2013: 228) examines 
her responses to data and offers the idea of ‘wonder’ as an ‘untapped potential in 
qualitative research’. She suggests that more ‘wonder’ from researchers would be a 
positive response to a rejection of the traditional methods of coding and analysis that 
form a core principle of conventional humanist qualitative approaches. Neither 
MacLure, nor myself, suggest that conventional approaches are invalid but rather they 
represent a different view of the world, a world that is more fixed and assumes more 
stability.  Researchers adopting a Deleuzian view of the world argue otherwise 
(MacLure 2013).  By aligning my ontological position with Deleuze I want to avoid fixing 
data rigidly in boxes or themes which would result in a possible misrepresentation of 
data, and potential misunderstanding of what is available to be considered and 
realised as part of any enquiry. MacLure (2013) argues that the awkward/unusual 
response to a survey question, the stand alone expression in a document is what 
needs to be responded to by the researcher.  When this is noticed, ‘on the lookout’, 
(Deleuze & Parnet 1977) this data is what MacLure (2010) terms ‘glowing data’. 
 
Maggie MacLure warns that this approach is not easy and is often uncomfortable, 
more than just being troublesome. The uncertainties of a journey are exciting but 

 
179 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
simultaneously worrisome. The task of analysing the product of questionnaire 
interactions will be just the same – worrisome as I don’t know where they will take me, 
what will unfold and what I will discover. At the same time though there is an 
excitement as I imagine opportunities and surprises that could become apparent – 
providing of course I accept the invitation and listen to the sound of the glowing data. 
 
 
5.5.2 Diffractive Analysis  
 
Davies (2014) offers the idea of a diffractive analysis that allows the researcher to map 
thoughts and practices as interactive, and interdependent to, and of, each other. In my 
case this process is/was/will be about analysing, and mapping that analysis, that 
examines the interrelatedness, dependency and independence of teachers as 
researchers with their thoughts and perceptions, values and beliefs, about young 
Children-as-Researchers. The idea of diffraction is different to reflection and reflexivity. 
For example, reflection, which is the preferred method of analysis for a conventional 
qualitative research is, according to Barad (2007) about noting the similarities and the 
sameness, a theme or mirrored repeated patterns. A diffractive researcher however 
does not depend on coding to identify patterns but through immersion in the data finds 
the places of interruption and interference, identifying the interrelatedness of the data. 
Barad (2007) explains that the aim of the post-qualitative researcher is not to offer up 
what is already there. This is only possible if we assume that objects of investigation 
are stable.   
 

 
180 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
According to Barad (2007, 2014), Davies (2014), and Taguchi (2012), diffractive 
analysis allows for the unpredictable and the newness of new ways of knowing to 
become apparent and also for the place where data interferes, (as in diffractive light 
waves), to be not just acknowledged but to be considered both in terms of what is 
there and what is absent. McCoy (2012) offers the idea that diffractive analysis opens 
up the data to allow a new sense-making that goes beyond the ordinary, the expected 
and the common sense, to come into being. In trying to make sense of a messy world 
that is not fixed it should be acknowledge that a diffractive approach is not cyclical in 
nature. By being on the Deleuzian ‘lookout’, for those differences/interferences we can 
not only examine how the differences come to matter, but can also see how they 
matter specifically in research practice (Davies 2014). It would seem that taking a 
diffractive approach to analysis is still not a common approach, those that have 
reported on it and justified it, for example Barad (2014), Davies (2014), Taguchi 
(2012), MacLure (2012) all suggest that the diffractive approach accepts not only the 
multiplicity of differences but, influenced by Deleuze, views those differences as being 
positive. They argue that this is the opposite of how differences are viewed in 
traditional interpretivist research where differences are identified in data as being 
contrary to the norm. However, viewing differences as being more representative of a 
lived reality, through diffractive analysis, I can see those differences as a positive, as 
an effect of the matter (data) responding to, connecting with and swerving as a result 
of interactions thereby going in new directions and unpredicted places (Taguchi 2012).  
 
The key feature of diffractive analysis is that, unlike a reflexive approach, in this form 
of critical analysis the researcher is acknowledged to be part of the data; to ignore that 

 
181 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
would be to have just partial data. Jackson and Mazzei (2012) propose a methodology 
which is against interpretivistim. They argue that a conventional interpretivist approach 
which places the emphasis on, for example, the participants’ voice in interviews, or 
written responses in questionnaires, ignores the social and cultural factors that 
influence and surround the participant. If through analysis the researcher also ignores 
these then the data can only be partial and incomplete. Similarly to ignore the impact 
and interference of the researcher on the participant, the research tool, the analysis 
would be to only offer partial data.  
 
 
 
5.6 A Brief resting point – (Diffractive Self-Analysis). 
 
I need to rest here, to gather my thoughts and consider where I am now situated on 
my research journey. Laurel Richardson’s and Elizabeth St Pierre’s view of writing as 
a methodology, together with Liz Honan and Dave Bright gives me the permission to 
take a breather.  I need to look back on where I have come from and to consider the 
way ahead.  
 
So…… I am an integral part of this whole experience, having been told from the outset 
that I needed to have more of me in the thesis I now, through this process of 
developing methodologies, see myself not only in the research but feel that I AM the 
research and that the research is ME. Using traditional research vocabulary, I offer 
myself as another data set.  All this means that …… 

 
182 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
 
……I need to consider in my diffractive analysis not only the responses to the 
 
questionnaires, but the context and content and subtleties of the responses, 
 
together with the social constructions in the language used and not used.  
 
 
…...I need to examine the meaning of self-identity, both mine and participants.  
 
  
…..I need to examine the methods of communications, the characteristics of 
 
the vocabulary, the timing of the communications in order to see not just the 
 
holistic nature of the subject matter but to ask myself how I did/do/will see 
 
myself as a social agent in relation to Children-as-Researchers, and the 
 
teachers’ values and beliefs of Children-as-Researchers.  
 
 
………….All this is being experienced with a sense of urgency.  
 
At this point I am experiencing Deleuze’s idea of ‘minorization’, I come here offering a 
minor language as a researcher eager to disrupt the norms of thinking. To achieve this 
I need to use all my senses, mind, body and soul to become saturated in the data and 
to approach the analysis by reading it in order to listen to what it says, and through a 
mapping of intra-connections see where the voice, and silence, of the participants take 
me. 
 

 
183 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
So I see that I am not just looking for answers any longer. As suggested at the end of 
Chapter 3: Dealing with Wanderlust I can predict nothing…… only that I have no idea 
where I am going to be taken.  
My approach was/is/will be so much more than just presenting an alternative point of 
view, taking this diffractive approach is the ethical position to adopt. By this I mean 
that my responsibilities as a researcher are ethically binding and to ignore the 
interactions and silences, the minors, would be to ignore my ethical responsibilities to 
my research participants. This diffractive approach is one that listens to silence, 
responds to empty sets, and is on the ‘look out’ for what isn’t there as well as what is.  
Whilst it may be the minority language, it does not mean that it lacks importance or is 
seen as less than. As I play with these ideas I come to appreciate that responding to 
the minority in this analysis will be empowering, as the diffractive analysis will invoke 
potential realities that are able to challenge the majority language and the hegemony.  
 
 
At the beginning the idea of examining children’s voice seemed pretty straight forward, 
the idea that there would be teachers/adults/gatekeepers who did not hold the same 
beliefs as I did had not occurred to me, I had no understanding that I was speaking a 
minority language. I had no awareness that not only was I approaching this from a 
completely different standpoint, I also had no awareness that as part of the 
minorization my self-identity would be challenged and changed throughout the journey 
of this research. This in itself is an illustration of an event, (I’m trying not to use the 
word evidence; it feels uncomfortable...), that relates to my understanding showing 

 
184 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
that I am an integral part of the research. My changing identity is captured through 
these inner thoughts, this internal dialogue.  
 
To be at this junction now, a kind of methodological lay-by, gives me some space to 
allow me to double check my professional and social responsibilities, (then and now, 
or now and then?), not just in following through the research but checking my approach 
was/is/will be an ethical one. Having explained my onto-epistemological stance in 
Chapter 4: Finding the Way, I believe I have here captured aspects of my ethical 
position. Karen Barad, of course adds ethics to form a triad of concepts that cannot be 
separated and need to be understood in relation to each other; ethic-onto-
epistemological. For me there is an ethical responsibility to following the lines of flight 
that emerge from this diffractive analysis. To ignore the empty data set would be 
unethical, to only focus on the loud data that pushed to the forefront and not to respond 
to that which is in the shadows wouldn’t be ethical. In the same way that a conventional 
humanist researcher has to make a commitment to not be biased and not to ignore 
data that may not fit in with a particular perception of the world, an ethical post 
qualitative researcher needs to be on the lookout for that which is hidden in the 
shadows and needs to be acknowledged. In this way it is, as Barad (2007) suggests, 
not possible to separate out ontology from epistemology and indeed ethics. 
 
 
In a traditional writing of a thesis there is an expectation and indeed a requirement to 
demonstrate an ethical approach to the research. For me at this point I have a crisis 
of confidence. Throughout the exploration so far in this, and in previous chapters, I 

 
185 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
believe I have offered a cyclical situated ethics approach. However given the enormity 
of the original task, to research Children-as-Researchers, to see how children can be 
active participants in researching their educational lives and to see how stakeholders 
view the idea of participation I believe I owe those children a thorough exploration of 
my ethical position. This includes how I adopted an ethical approach to the initial 
phases of the research with children research, and subsequently following the 
refocussing of aims how the adults in the second part of the enquiry were treated 
ethically.  
 
 
5.7 Ethical Tourism – Respectful, Responsive, Research/er 
 
In aiming to present a coherent summary of how the research was conducted/is being 
conducted in an ethical way I will offer here a record of how I fulfilled the requirements 
of my home institution as well as my professional and personal responsibilities. Firstly 
a summary of the documentation prepared and offered to faculty ethics committee with 
be considered.  This will relate initially to the participants (children) and as part of the 
pilot/first study and then the participants (adults) in the second part of the study. These 
will then be analysed through a diffractive approach to consider how my ethical 
approach has been not just approved as part of an institutional process and policy but 
how it has been influenced by my onto-epistemological position and how that is an 
integral part of decisions made.  
 

 
186 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
5.7.1 Permission to Travel- Ethical Approval. 
 
Ethical approval for this research was granted by the Birmingham City University’s 
Faculty Ethics Committee. In addition, the Ethical Guidelines for Educational 
Research, published by the British Educational Research Association (BERA, 2011, 
2014) and the precepts of the Data Protection Act 1998 have been adhered to. 
Furthermore guidelines offered by National Children’s Bureau were taken into 
consideration acknowledging the specific and special status of children in research 
(Shaw et al 2011). 
The process of obtaining ethical approval involved preparation of a case to justify my 
approaches taken. Whilst there may remain some debate as to whether or not children 
deserve different ethical considerations to adults, (e.g. Alderson and Morrow, 2011; 
Harcourt, Perry and Waller, 2011; Kellett, 2010), my background as an Early Years 
practitioner and having carried out previous research with children as active research 
participants  influenced/s me otherwise. Consequently I tackled the approval process 
firmly believing in the need and desire to demonstrate my commitment to UNCRC 
Article 12 – the Right to Participate. At the heart of this decision was the recognition 
and belief that children are social actors (James and Prout 2014), who are competent 
to interpret and report on their own experiences. Such recognition is explicit in Article 
12 of the UNCRC which stipulates the right of children to express their views and to 
be heard in all matters which affect them. The initial aims of the study placed children 
at the heart of it, particularly the aim ‘To elicit children’s views of their right to 
participation in education’. This had a significant influence on the initial design and how 
the research was to be carried out. Children’s rights to information and to be heard 

 
187 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
needed to extend to ethical procedures (Alderson and Morrow 2011), including fully 
informed consent (BERA 2014, Shaw et al 2011).   
 
My change in direction following the ‘lines of flight’ that were exposed through a 
diffractive analysis (although at the time I wasn’t aware that that was what was 
happening), also required further ethical considerations. As a researcher this meant a 
subsequent application for approval from the FEC, but as a post-qualitative 
researcher, now strongly influenced by Barad and Deleuze, I can see that this is a 
further indication of the ethico-onto-epistemological concept offered by Barad (2007).   
Davies (2016) considers the place of ethics in a post era paying particular attention to 
Barad and Deleuze. She argues that for Barad the position on ethics is not about 
following a bespoke set of rules, ethical practice requires thinking beyond what is 
already known (Davies 2016). On the surface it may seem like Barad’s position is very 
similar to ‘situated ethics’ (Ebrahim 2010) which promotes a cyclical approach to 
ethics, an ongoing response to the matter, the subject. Essentially situated ethics is 
about the researcher inter-acting with the subject, the matter and the participants. 
Barad (2007) though promotes the idea of intra-action. In terms of ethics then the 
approach is not just about being responsive to the participants but being aware of the 
intra-actions between subject, participant, culture, environment, social constructions, 
the non-human, and human participants in the research. This entanglement 
demonstrates again how Barad’s term ‘ethico-onto-epistemology’ captures the 
essence of my stance.

Phase 1 
Interactive session – children reminded that what 
we talked about was just for the research and 
wouldn’t be shared with other children or adults 
and only referred to in my research 
 
Phase 2 
Children reminded at start of session that this

that meant we could speak openly about our 
work and that this remained within your Research 
Club. 
Opening invite confirms privacy, stating 
responses shared with supervisor for

Responses remain anonymous. 
Anonymity 
Phase 1 & 2 
Parents and children informed that real names 
(Children and School) would not be used when 
sharing findings, either in discussions or in 
written work. 
Opening invite confirms anonymity 
stating responses remain anonymous, 
opportunity to add email address for

Confidentiality 
Phase 1 & 2 
Parents and children informed, initially through 
letters and leaflets, that anything discussed 
would remain confidential as part of the project. 
The exception being in terms of disclosure. 
 
For children this was explained by confirming that 
if they told me anything that I thought meant they 
were not safe then I couldn’t keep it a secret. 
Opening invite confirms confidentiality 
with access to findings limited to 
researcher and supervisor, stating 
responses remain anonymous,

Phase 1 & 2 
Parents and children informed through 
introductory leaflets and letters of consent that 
the data gathered would be looked after and that 
there were passwords to protect files on 
computers so that no one else could see the 
data. 
 
At the end of the project all original data would be 
destroyed. 
Opening invite confirms arrangements for 
data storage, including password 
protected link to online survey, and hard 
drive that may store working documents

Having outlined my post qualitative approach to finding data the following chapter 
moves to analyse this in order to open up the spaces with the concept of Children-
as-Researchers.

blurring methodologies the entanglements within those spaces become more apparent.

6.1 Where now? 
 
Returning to Martin and Kamberelis’ (2013) idea of post-qualitative research being 
about mapping new territories rather than tracing existing ones, I aim to consider the 
product of the questionnaires as a process of mapping, and in this way to create a 
holistic interpretation of the key issues under discussion. The idea of maps and 
journeys echoes a geographical understanding, and investigation of, the ‘lay of the 
land’, albeit from a human geographical perspective.  In my thesis the ‘lay of the land’, 
is the territory of Children-as-Researchers, this curiosity resonates with the discipline 
of Children’s Geographies. Colleagues from this field of study for example Horton and 
Kraft (2006), Horton, Kraft and Tucker(2008), Pyer (2008), and Hadfield-Hill and 
Horton (2014), aim to examine the places and spaces of children's lives, their lived 
experiences and how these experiences are influenced politically, socially and 
environmentally, and this is the definition adopted here. Within this disciplinary 
approach there has been a call for a ‘slowing down’ when analyzing data (Millei and 
Rautio (2017: 2), in order to look again at the ordinary, the routine and the familiar in 
relation to the lives of children. Millei and Rautio (2017) discuss a strategy whereby 
their data, in their case the event of an interview, is reframed and re-presented to elicit 
an analysis of the inter-actions between researcher and the children participants in 
order to ensure their findings are not simply a cleansed and sanitized version of data 
that answered specific aims. For Millei and Ratio (2017) this period of reflection was 
challenging emotionally as they explored reasons for ignoring some interactions and 
subsequent exclusions. They go on to draw on Michael (2012) who coins the phrase 
‘overspills’ to identify the data that doesn’t quite fit in, the irksome pieces that fall out 

 
192 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
of the pattern, that provoke a possible ‘other’. Influenced by Millei and Ratio (2017) 
and finding their work resonates again with MacLure (2013), and Deleuze and Guatarri 
(1980), I too will highlight and focus on the overspills as it is this data that ‘glows’ 
(MacLure 2013).  
 
In finding the glowing data I adopted/adopt a process that Revsbaek and Tanggaard 
(2015) call ‘analyzing in the present’.  Their approach creates a narrative out of the 
responses gleaned through the range of interviews they conducted for their research. 
They achieve this through listening again, and again, to interviews; not just to format 
a transcript but to become fully immersed in them. In doing so they are not just 
acknowledging the role they have as researchers but are accepting and responding to 
it, noting and giving careful consideration and analysis to  their emerging thoughts and 
understandings, recognizing their emotive responses and role rather than simply trying 
to code what was said;  I am likening this to St Pierre’s discussion of  ‘transgressive 
data’ (1997), which she describes as being ‘emotional data, dream data, sensual data, 
and response data- that are out-of-category and not usually accounted for in 
qualitative research methodology’ (St Pierre 2010: 171). As such I aim to adopt/adapt 
this process as I analyze the responses to the survey in the moment in order to reveal 
the ‘lay of the land’ in my research.  
 
 

 
193 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
6.1.1 Pause for breath…… 
 
So for Line and Lene (Revsbaek and Tanggaard 2015) their responses to the 
transcription interview data becomes an analytical tool in itself and as I think about 
what this means for me I am reminded again of how Richardson and St Pierre (2017) 
propose that writing up research becomes a methodology, and for me this processes 
highlights my blurred methodological approach. This approach reinforces the notion 
that research is an active and emotional process; that the writing of a thesis is not just 
a record of the research but is a record of how the processes of the research are not 
separate from the researcher. For me the practical process of analyzing the responses 
from my questionnaires involved trawling and making notes of the data that glowed, 
at the same time noting my emotions, the questions that occurred, the problems I could 
foresee, the wondering and the irksome nudges. These were/are the musings and 
contemplations about the research that bothered and troubled me, often awakening 
me at night and can be likened to what Deleuze and Guattari (1986)  refer to as the 
‘stutterings’ and ‘stammerings’.  
 
The practical process I adopted to work with the data involved using rolls of lining 
paper for walls, that scrolled forward and backward, on which I could express myself 
freely, ( 
Image 9), pulling out key words, phrases and details from the questionnaires. As I went 
through this superficially random, even chaotic process, I began noticing links, 

 
194 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
overlaps, connections and inter-connections, the developing documentation became 
busier and messier as the links and connections became more numerous.

My ‘Wallpaper Analysis’ demonstrated not just the complexities of my subject matter 
but captured a process of ‘analysis in the present’, (Image 10). Returning to these 
visual illustrations of my thinking on each and subsequent visits I found/find new data 
that glows, that wants to be noticed anew. As with many apprentice researchers I had 
initial concerns about quantity of my data and was afraid whether it would ever be 
enough, however frequent visits to my wallpaper told me enough is enough (Image 
11). I cautioned myself against the fear of drowning in data and shushed the ideas that 
comes from phrases, punctuation, vocabulary and the voices captured in the 
questionnaire responses.  
 
In trying to determine a way forward I am suddenly conscious that I am in danger of 
drawing together a thematic approach based on patterns and repetition, which I have 
already declined as I have rejected conventional humanist qualitative (CHQ) research. 
I need to quieten the CHQ voice that keeps coming to the surface, not to dismiss or to 
eradicate the value of it, but I find myself responding in a way so as to hush a persistent 
toddler, ‘Not now lovely’. ‘This is not your time’, I want to say, in a gentle but respectful 
way. These ongoing internal dialogues demonstrated not just my involvement with the 
research but illustrated that I cannot be separated from this research, and that writing 
out my discussion with the data is indeed an integral part of the process of the 
research. However, in order to hear the persistent voices within the data I needed 
some level of organization and my natural instincts as an Early Years practitioners 
kick-in. Thinking of the many voices in the data, all of whom have valuable things to 

 
197 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
say, I needed to facilitate some turn taking, not by finding themes but by exploring the 
data through layers or domains.  
 
The constant revisiting of my ‘Wallpaper Analysis’ prompted me to respond to three 
domains, those being:  
 
  
Children-Teachers- Research  
 
  
Teachers-Research-Children  
 
  
Research-Children-Teachers  
 
  
 
 
These three domains are not just linked but overlap, react and inter/intra-act. Each 
cannot be analyzed, contemplated and considered in isolation. Whilst the teachers 
became the research participants the children are involved and considered at each 
layer and each new space is considered in relation to them, they are not in isolation. 
I prioritized, for that is all I could do, the provocations that come from the 
questionnaires. I start with Children-as-Researchers – my initial starting point, the 
heart of the matter and the main aim of the whole journey.  Imagining my analysis as 
a crystal, the following sections then are offered as a holistic interpretation, focusing 
on one face whilst not completely losing sight of the other faces, they each remain 
there but are somewhat out of focus, for the time being… 
 
But…. 

 
198 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
…….the need to find ways of presenting the findings that remain true to my onto-
epistemological stance still needs further consideration, and after time and thought I 
arrive at a new place, which will be offered next, where I can present data in a way 
that shows where we have travelled from and offers a direction, pointing towards new 
spaces. 
 
6.2 Well-trodden routes and going off the beaten track. 
 
Hunting through the data I easily find the predictable and expected, that which 
reaffirms what others have already noticed and found. Walking through well-trodden 
routes I can identify themes that emerge easily that I can gather together to offer a 
snapshot of the views and perceptions of this group of teachers. However I need to 
present and then re-present. I decide I will firstly offer those ‘predictable’ findings, by 
adopting a conventional humanist qualitative approach using traditional ways of 
presenting – grids, tables and charts, to present the ‘predictable’.  
 
And then, courageously I will take a bigger breath and venture off the beaten track…. 
 
….with each subsequent exploration of the data, through analysing in the present, I 
can see how the concepts, the nuances, tones and textures within, are not just cyclical 
and connected but have degrees of relationships with each other and within each 
other. I recognise that I need to find other ways of presenting this. 

 
199 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
I consider the ‘knots’ that De Freitas (2012) offers as one way of using diagrams to 
illustrate and interpret classroom interactions, and draw on Deleuze’s rhizomatic 
processes to understand this. The benefits of this as a tool to adopt and adapt could 
be to ‘better capture the entanglement of interaction’ (De Freitas 2012:557). The knot 
diagrams, she says, offer ‘not a mirror of the event but an experiment or mould’ (2012: 
568); by this she means that the ‘knots’ she offers are not just a representation of the 
specific interactions in the data, but are representative of how those interactions have 
shaped other interactions, by doing so De Freitas captures the fluidity of those 
interactions. For me though, the image of the knot itself offers a two-dimensional 
perspective that, with my mind’s eye, I find challenging to interpret. The changing 
rhythm of the data does not appear to be captured in the knots, the image of the ‘knot’ 
presents a finality of interpretation that in my thinking does not reflect the multiplicity 
of the concepts examined.  
I move on not having found what I’m looking for yet.  
 
Martin and Kamberelis (2013) appeal to me with their analogies of maps, I see the 
whole thesis as my journey and have already, acknowledging their influence, adopted 
the idea of maps through the use of associated vocabulary in my writing. Visually I do 
struggle to see the whole of the research as a mapped out entity, but I find myself 
attracted to the idea of maps and cartographies.  I note the use of maps again by Elsa 
Lenz-Kothe (Higgins et al 2017) with her colleagues who illustrate their data gathering 

 
200 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
tools and analytical processes, whereby the maps sketched out illustrate the ‘individual 
momentary experience’ (pg 28) that becomes the data for analysis. The idea that maps 
are never complete and are ongoing and responsive has resonance and provides 
another communication tool that adds another plane to my thesis writing, and draws 
me again to a new, for me, aspect of visual communication and images, and I will 
tentatively return to this later. 
 
For me though the sensory pattern, rhythm, emotion and sound of words remains my 
primary focus. As I read Bronwyn Davies ‘Notes on Anger: Some Observations’ I am 
gently encouraged to enter the event she analyses as she ventures to present the 
thoughts and practice relating to anger amongst preschool children. Her  narrative 
style captures  the full rich description of ‘moments of rage’ (Davies 2014:738), which 
are analyzed and discussed, and offer the reader not only an example of diffractive 
analysis, which is the purpose of her writing in this context, but also a refreshing 
presentation of data that can be read in a way that aides the reader to see/hear/feel 
for herself the multidirectional, emergent intra-active inferences that Deleuze calls 
‘Being’ and Barad calls ‘the world’ and its ‘possibilities of becoming.’ (Davies 
2014:740).  
 
So the presentation of what Davies uncovers and reveals through her research writing, 
in itself, reflects the ontological, epistemological and ethical stance she adopts. I feel 
the need to employ these qualities in my own work. Growing in confidence I revisit 

 
201 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
other studies that have adopted ways of presenting data that go beyond conventional 
written methods. I am intrigued and welcome the creative and playful nature of 
alternative ways of presenting findings and analysis. I find myself though, rejecting 
cabaret (Hill 2014), and rejecting ethno-poetry (Owton 2017, Millei and Rautio 2017). 
My rejection of these ways of presenting findings and analysis is in direct response to 
my own emotions and self-assessment. I do not connect emotionally, I respond to the 
poetry and cabaret with awkwardness and an uncomfortable confusion, I do not 
recognize my ability to create song nor poetry. 
 
Eventually I come to a place of realization where I understand that the need to express 
myself, and the voices of the participants through text, is best achieved by adopting 
the narrative /internal dialogue style of Davies (2014), which triggers both an emotional 
and intellectual response in me. I also need something more to allow the agentic 
characteristics of the entanglement I have uncovered (in the wallpaper analyses) to 
be felt and understood, as well as read and understood; a way which also portrays the 
enjoyment of this research experience. The accompanying map, I believe, achieves 
this. I offer a reminder of this now with promises to engage more fully with the map in 
the future (Cartographic Images – New ways of seeing.pg 364 ff). 
In this mode of analysis the fixed moment of the written word, the finality of words 
committed to paper becomes the problem to overcome.  I realize that I am in danger 
of repetition, of talking in circles, and whilst accepting that my thinking is not linear but 
triggered by those lines of flight, I still need to demonstrate progression and movement 

 
202 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
to a new place and new thinking through ‘other than’ linear routes, or through 2-D 
presentations, whether they be maps, diagrams, images or narrative.  
To understand where I am going though I need to see where I, and others, have 
already been. To understand the significance of the new spaces, the overspills, as well 
as the unsaid and silence, firstly I will offer the foreseen, what both MacLure (2013) 
and Millei and Rautio (2017) refer to as the ‘expected’. Thereafter, with an alternative 
style of presentation and interpretation I will consider the new spaces of this journey, 
in doing so I am accepting the challenge of presenting and then re-presenting offered 
by Millei and Rautio (2017).  
6.3 Children-as-Researchers within the domain -  
Children-Teachers-Research 
 
 
Figure 10 - Facet of Children within the domain of Children-Teacher-Research 
 

 
203 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Drawing on the idea of crystals and diffractive analysis Figure 10 above demonstrates 
how, whilst focusing in this section on children, the influences of teachers and research 
per se is never far away, although for this discussion is recognised as being slightly 
out of  focus. 
 
Within this section I will summarise findings from the survey; the headlines that 
emerged from a conventional humanist approach to my qualitative research data. The 
questionnaires aimed to explore how teachers perceived Children-as-Researchers, by 
examining previous, present and potential research opportunities. Teacher-
Respondents were asked to provide overviews of when they had carried out research 
with children and how this had been achieved. Open ended questions gave 
opportunities to provide context, methodology and tools adopted and children’s 
involvement. Teacher-Respondents were also asked about how they currently 
involved children as research participants, as well as possible barriers and what might 
encourage them to involve children in research. A final question asked for Teacher-
Respondents to reflect on the potential benefits of involving children in research. The 
structure of the questionnaire was divided into three sections the first being about the 
participants themselves, their role and beliefs about research, the second being about 
research in general and the last being about children’s role in research. The first 
domain to be examined here features children at the focal point whilst aspects of 
teachers and research in relation to children, waited in the background. This reflects 
that children remain very much at the heart of the original research aims and research 
design. 

 
204 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
6.3.1 Well-travelled routes – Children as Competent Learners 
 
As noted by previous authors (eg. Kellett 2010, Bucknall 2012, Bradbury-Jones and 
Taylor 2013), Teacher-Respondents present a positive perception of children, both as 
pupils in their schools and as research participants. When asked if children could be 
researchers, what the benefits of Children-as-Researchers initiatives might be, 
analysis of the vocabulary used demonstrates a positive discourse of children, with 
repetition of key phrases as presented in Table iv. 
 
Table iv - Word Frequency 
Phrase/vocabulary
Frequency
Open minded 
5 
Have a different viewpoint/perspective/opinion to adults 
3 
Curious/curiosity 
6 
Always asking questions/ask why 
7 
Children’s voice 
8 
Naturally enquiring 
2 
Competent/Able to learn new skills/new ways of working 
2 
 
By considering the vocabulary used I can see that Teacher-Respondents reflect a 
dominant discourse of childhood that sees children as competent learners who have 
an innate ability to be curious and to question. This is not surprising given the 
dominance of the Piagetian theory of constructivism in Western Educational practice 

 
205 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
and Initial Teacher Training courses (Terhart 2017). Rather than holding a deficit 
model of children in the tradition of the empty vessel to be filled, the Teacher-
Respondents demonstrate, through their responses, both a belief in children’s abilities, 
and also communicate a commitment to involving children in their own learning.  
 
Teacher-Respondents also offer their perspective of children as learners, commenting 
that they are able and are competent, and that in relation to a question about children 
learning skills to become researchers they respond by saying: 
 
 ‘[This is the] best way for children to learn, through doing and  
 
           
 
 investigating’ 
 
 ‘Children can easily pursue a line of enquiry’ 
 
 ‘Ceilings should not be placed on children’ 
 
 ‘They have investigative skills and a desire to explore and answer’ 
 
 ‘We are keen to involve children in the development of the curriculum’ 
  
This positive discourse of children as being valued as competent learners would 
initially seem to contradict those who argued that the idea of children being 
undervalued in society is a dominant discourse within western culture, whereby 
children are surrounded by protection and care and only understood in terms of their 
future adulthood (Postman 1995, Heywood 2001, Cunningham 2006, and Palmer 
2015). This also challenges the culture of compliance extant in schools fostered by 

 
206 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Initial Teacher Training and government policy. However seeing that the schools by 
their very nature are about learning, and the purpose of the social environment within 
is to value and nurture children as learners, it is not surprising then that the Teacher-
Respondents present a positive discourse of children as learners. Conceivably this 
positive discourse of children as learners could be said to reinforce a sense of identity 
for teachers as facilitators of that learning, in relation to the intrinsic rewards of the role 
itself.  
 
6.3.2 Well-travelled routes – Children as Competent (Age Related) 
Researchers. 
 
Regarding children as growing in competency with age as researchers is evident from 
the responses to questions asking if children at, Key Stage 2 (7 – 11 Years), Key Stage 
1 (5 – 7 years) and Foundation Stage (3 – 5 years) could be researchers. Not 
surprisingly Teacher-Respondents indicated that they believed older children to be 
more competent in carrying out their own research then the younger children. 
Interestingly of the participants that responded, more identified that their teaching 
experience was in Key Stage 2 (73%), then in Early Years (Foundation Stage), (27%), 
which raises the question as to whether a lack of experience of working with the 
younger 
age 
groups 
limited 
the 
Teacher-Respondents’ 
understanding 
of 
competencies of those younger Children-as-Researchers. This would begin to 
suggest a developmental perspective of children and childhood by the Teacher-
Respondents. Again this would seem to fit in with the overarching values, professional 
roles, and understanding of children, that would be anticipated and has been 

 
207 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
considered previously by, for example, Bucknall (2012), Kellett (2005, 2010), and 
Elton-Chalrcroft (2011) as discussed in Chapter 3: Dealing with Wanderlust (pg 91 ff). 
 
Similarly, when Teacher-Respondents were asked if children could be researchers, all 
respondees replied with an emphatic YES. They went on to explain their answers 
commenting that that: 
  
 ‘Research is based on a set of skills and those skills just needed to be  
 
 learnt’  
 
 ‘Children were able to reflect on their learning and make assessments  
 
 of that’. 
 
 ‘If they are taught the skills required they can do this’. 
This suggests that Teacher-Respondents believe children are able and competent to 
learn these skills whilst indicating that they also believe children may not already have 
them. To this effect then Teachers-Respondents in this survey could see research 
skills as an extension of the children’s current learning.  Furthermore they go on to 
suggest that children can effectively participate in research in relation to the 
curriculum, noting in particular what they are capable of: 
 
 ‘Offering a good insight into my teaching’ 
 
 ‘Children are more independent thinkers and can offer improvements to  
 
 the curriculum’ 

 
208 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
 ‘Children would feel involved in the process and therefore respond   
 
 positively to any conclusions drawn’ 
These statements would suggest not only a high degree of confidence in the Teacher-
Respondents of children’s ability to be able to conduct research, but also a belief that 
their opinions and voices are worthwhile listening to.  
 
 
 
6.3.3 Well-travelled routes – Children as Competent (Age Related) 
Research Participants 
 
Those Teacher-Respondents who had conducted some research with children each 
had a curriculum focus and described those research projects as ‘Resources for 
Teaching Mathematics’, ‘Participation in PE lessons’, ‘Boys in Role-Play’, ‘Reading 
Skills’, and ‘Impact of eReaders’. This suggests that Teacher-Respondents are looking 
for children to help them to understand aspects of children’s lives, specifically their 
learning experiences, within a school context, as previously identified by Leat, 
Lofthouse and Reid (2014) and discussed in the literature review (pg 90 ff). 
 
There is also a sense from the Teacher-Respondents of mutual respect in comments 
such as ‘I learn from them as much as they do from me’. The idea of children being 
listened to and the importance of that is well documented (for example, Krappmann 

 
209 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
2010, Lundy 2007, Kellett 2010, Bucknall 2012) and was previously reflected on in 
section 3.5 Children’s Voice (pg 84 ff). Teacher-Respondents also used terms such 
as ‘Voice’ and ‘School Councils’ when giving examples of how children had 
participated in research. Both concepts linked to the idea of children’s participation, 
and tried and tested strategies implemented by schools as ways of listening to children 
and ‘getting their voice out’; the latter, according to Tisdall (2015), being fully 
entrenched in policy and practice in UK schools. The quantity of research which 
focuses on Voice and Participation is acknowledged to be plentiful by, for example, 
Lundy (2007), Ruck and Horn (2008), Reynaert et al (2009), Payne (2009), so it is not 
unexpected then that Teacher-Respondents use both these key terms, and familiar 
strategies, when offering an insight into children as research participants. The 
examples offered by the Teacher-Respondents related specifically to children who are 
targeted, or are chosen members of a group or activity, but not usually in relation to 
whole school or whole class projects or approaches. As other researchers have noted, 
(Dalli and Te One 2012, Schnoor 2012, and Bradbury-Jones and Taylor 2015), the 
selection of children for these types of pupil-led activities is often based on their 
perceived superior academic ability or social competence which creates a stumbling 
block when arguing for the benefits of promoting research with, and certainly by, all 
children in the school. The same reluctance to include all children can be seen here 
when Teacher-Respondents comment that barriers to children becoming researchers 
would be: 
 
 ‘Basic comprehension, maths and writing’ 
 
 ‘Communication and data handling’ 

 
210 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
 ‘Negotiation, respect and organisation’ 
 
 ‘Communicating and listening to others’ 
 
 ‘Literacy and independence skills’ 
 
 ‘Social skills’ 
 
For Teacher-Respondents children were most likely to be the focus ‘of’ research rather 
than as active participants. However, they felt very confident that children could carry 
out interviews, and be interviewed if they were given a chance to do so. The 
commitment Teacher-Respondents showed to this sort of activity placed children as 
co-researchers rather than researchers in their own right, what Kellett (2010) refers to 
as research with children rather than research by children. Despite Bradbury-Jones 
and Taylor (2015) suggesting the concept of participatory research with children is de 
rigueur, there was no evidence that these Teacher-Respondents have adopted this 
concept. This is despite strongly indicating an interest in research and strongly 
agreeing that children could be researchers; providing that teachers remained in 
control and were able to choose who the children as research participants would be.  
 
 
6.3.4 Summary (Trip Review). 
 
In summary then interpretation of the data produced by the survey in relation to 
Children-as-Researchers from a Teacher-Respondent perspective would suggest 

 
211 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
that, in line with Kellett (2010, 2005), Bucknall (2012) Bradbury-Jones (2015), that they 
believe children could be competent researchers, given the right support. Teacher-
Respondents express high levels of confidence in children and see Children-as-
Researchers projects as being effective ways of empowering children and promoting 
the value of children’s voice. Essentially then, Teacher-Respondents recognise that 
children’s opinions matter to them, especially when evaluating practice within learning 
experiences. A further discourse of children evident through the Teacher-
Respondents’ responses to the questionnaires could be described as a 
‘developmental perspective’. Teacher-Respondents demonstrate the idea that through 
experience children move to the next stage of their development and that their ability 
is based on those experiences, of which there is a natural order. Older children are 
more competent than younger children in terms of being researchers as they have 
already had experiences that are necessary for them to undertake research. Teacher-
Respondents identify literacy, and social skills, as being key to research success; 
without these skills children would not be able to carry out research effectively. 
 
6.3.5 Going off the beaten track – Caution and Control. 
 
BUT –looking closer I notice that a previously concealed trickle of caveats to the views 
expressed above grab my attention and glow….  
Calling out for further attention. 
 I asked ‘Can children be researchers?’ 
They said: 

 
212 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
‘Yes….as long as the focus is given to them’ 
‘Yes….with support to make sure it is rigorous, they tend to go off track’ 
‘Yes….but depends on what is asked of them, sometimes their judgments are 
not accurate’ 
‘Yes ….but they need parameters set for them’ 
 
Punctuation demands attention here.  
The ellipses tool………. integrated to demonstrate a further thought, not fully 
explained, but hinted at through that punctuation.  
Denotes a passing of time, briefly …….a pause and a reflection, in this case to present 
a second thought, in these instances the caveat. 
That caveat being a condition needed for children to be able to carry out research, 
which is not based alone on the children’s ability to do so. The briefest of pauses, the 
briefest of silences seen here screams out at a bigger issue that demands to be 
scrutinized but which remains un-vocalised.   
 
The pause (‘Yes…but depends’/‘Yes….with support ‘) - could this be a Deluzean 
‘stutter’????  
 

 
213 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
This……momentarily interrupts their choice of words… their flow of thought, and can 
be interpreted as a movement away from certitude… toward caution; so despite the 
expected and overt position of having total confidence in the children and offered 
previously… we see in the ellipsis/stutter a more cautious position… in itself denoting 
uncertainty.   
 
Representative as a subtle move away from the assertion that children are capable of 
carrying out research….unless in certain ways. 
  
What hangs questioningly is the ‘context’ for the children’s research; this is the - ‘yes, 
but’.  
Teacher-Respondents (T-Rs) are happy for children to be researchers provided that 
investigation remains in the control of the adult, and that the research itself matches 
the understanding of research that the adult holds.  The ellipses though is key in that 
the T-Rs may not acknowledge this explicitly to themselves. 
 
The verbs used [given, set, asked of] as well as the use of the metaphor ‘go off track’ 
reinforce the desire to control, that there is a desired track to follow. 
 

 
214 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
That is not to say that the control is necessarily about keeping the children down or 
dominating them but perhaps it hints at, or gestures towards, something less overtly 
threatening but equally managerial and controlling.  
 
Given that the dominant discourse of children is positive, with talk of ‘voice’ and 
‘opinion’, I would interpret that control in this context is more akin to the idea of 
supervising and maintaining security, which may not always be a neutral position.  
 
However I am seeing the use of caveats and ellipses by the T-Rs as an attempt to 
‘protect’  their perception of themselves as being ‘for’ pupil voice  without going beyond 
a very safe version of what it means in practice.  In this way they maintain the status 
quo, keeping everything smooth and steady, offering  me, the researcher  a soothing 
encouragement rather than provocation ( i.e. that they are not on board with the idea 
of pupil led research) .   
The vocabulary used indicates the worth that the T-Rs place on the idea of research, 
as something to be given to children, something to be bestowed, and as with many 
gifts this has value, particularly in the eyes of the giver. However it also belies a 
reluctance to overtly position themselves in this way.  
 

 
215 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
How T-Rs view research will be explored later, but through this lens we can see the 
importance of T-Rs’ perspectives of research on the peripheral… although at the 
moment this is just out of focus. 
 
 
6.3.6 Going off the beaten track – ‘SLOW Children at PLAY’. 
 
The caveats discussed above suggest then that, as far as the T-Rs are concerned, 
there is a right and wrong way for research to be carried out.  Most specifically, without 
the RIGHT support and guidance there is a sense that they believe that children would 
get research wrong.  
 
The idea that children are developing researchers in the same way that they are 
developing readers, mathematicians and scientists does not seem to feature here.  It 
feels important and I leave it here for now to bubble away, maybe to return to later… 
and I do… 7.7 Emerging Researchers pg 334 ff). 
 
T-Rs refer to levels, assessments, targets and offer these as the main reason why 
Children-as- Researcher projects are not common practice in their schools, does this 
suggest they perceive children not as who they are now, but who they will be and what 
level they will achieve, and the small steps to be taken that the T-Rs need to plan to 
make sure the children achieve the goal, step by step, level by level? 

 
216 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
And this then creates a niggling provocation and question in the research, why is it 
that T-Rs don’t hold that same developmental perspective with regards to Children-
as-Researchers?  
 
Why such a different position in relation to Children-as-Researchers?  
There is no mention of ‘playing at research’, no mention of experiential leaning, or of 
younger children being researchers in a different way to older children?  
This seems to be something that is missing here and not considered, the absence of 
a developmental perception of Children-as-Researchers is stark. The ‘glowing data’ 
that calls out, by its absence and silence, to be picked over. 
 
So to try and answer/respond through offering a possibility I wonder if this is because 
there is a shift towards the position that research per se lies in the domain of the adult 
world and not the child’s world. Research, not being part of the child’s world sits 
against a backdrop within academia that views the idea and ideal of Children-as-
Researchers to be highly valued and desired, different but interconnected 
professionals viewing and understanding research differently, and viewing and 
understanding children and their world differently, and how they might research that 
world differently. 
 

 
217 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Understanding the child’s world and how the T-Rs perceive children within the world 
of schools and education is not clear. I remember that the responses here have been 
from T-Rs who have acknowledged that they have included children in research…yet 
the focus of that research is not children themselves but a curriculum area, a resource, 
an approach – there is something missing, and that is research about children’s lives, 
their worlds.   
 
The would-be areas to be researched, as well as the already researched, remain fixed 
within the curriculum, often presenting as an evaluation of the T-Rs performance, 
research that promotes feedback on teaching and teachers.   
 
Curriculum centric and not child-centric.  
 
If the lived experience of Children-as-Researchers is only within a framework that the 
adults in the schools design, and their participation is limited to views and evaluations 
of their learning experiences then where is pupil-led research that can be said to be 
child-based? 
  
And what of the curiosity of teachers to understand a child’s ontology?  
Is the T-Rs’ idea that research is fixed within an adult world actually only adopted 
because they are unfamiliar with, and lack a curiosity about, the child’s world, with the 

 
218 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
exception of the inter-section where children fit into the world of the teacher as a 
professional? 
  
How does curiosity entangle T-Rs’ perception of children themselves or indeed their 
perceptions of research, the entanglement that at times results in strangulation, and 
suffocation seen by the holding of breath /the silence of the ellipse. For within the 
entanglement I am beginning to see maybe not a position whereby children’s voices 
are heard, as T-Rs reported, but the opposite whereby children’s voices are quietened 
in the silence of their ellipses/stutterings.   
 
 How else can this be explained, what alternative possibility may help to understand? 
This silencing and shushing leads me to think that this absence of children from 
research may actually not be about the children but the T-Rs themselves, or more 
precisely, how they see and understand child-led research.  (Another line of flight, to 
be picked up later….. and reader it will be). 
 
6.3.7 Going off the beaten track…..Risky Play. 
 
I can see, ‘glowing’ in the data produced, the idea that T-Rs place great value on 
research, holding it on high, a pedestal in sight perhaps? Items of great value are often 
described as being high-risk in insurance policies and the T-Rs suggest that for 
Children-as-Researchers the risk factor becomes very high.  

 
219 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
The value and influence that is attributed to research by the T-Rs is tangible. Research 
is about ‘impact’ (the words of T-Rs).The value of research seen in the power of 
research to make changes that matter is an interesting position offered in answer to 
the question ‘Would your setting promote the idea of children as researchers?’ 
I am drawn to key words here with one T-R stating   
 
‘Yes, it needs to be done properly, if there is no impact then it isn’t 
 
worth doing’.  
 
If research ‘needs to be done properly’ then Children-as-Researchers can be said to 
be risky if it isn’t done properly…and that begs the questions what does ‘properly’ 
mean??  
When adults determine the value, worth and ‘correctness’ of child-led research the 
research stops being child-led. What would children say, what would their idea of 
research look like, how would it be judged and assessed? 
 
Teachers, and Parents, admire and respond positively, eagerly, and with 
encouragement to what may be deemed immature marks made by ‘emerging writers’, 
and accept their ‘shopping lists’, their ‘message’, and their ‘greetings’. Adults look on 
in awe and wonder at paint splattered paper that represents the child’s ideas and 
creativity as it drops upon the floor and adults remain unsure as to whether to view it 

 
220 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
horizontally or vertically. Within child-led research could the decision of ‘properly’ lie 
within the child’s domain? 
 
Adopting guidance provided from adults who generate the framework within which 
children can be researchers, seems to be the strategy deemed necessary to reduce 
risk and ensure research is done ‘properly’. The perceived need by T-Rs to ensure the 
research is done ‘properly’, as an adult would, with the so-called RIGHT outcomes 
becomes the barrier to Children-as-Researchers for the T-Rs.  
 
Concerns are apparent about Children-as-Researchers, (or the T-Rs management of 
the child-researchers), getting it wrong, or getting the wrong outcome by doing 
research wrongly dominate, and in doing so reaffirms the ‘respect’ teachers hold for 
the idea of ‘research’.  
 
So the glowing data reveals, just off the beaten track, other paths to follow….. 
 
Where is the commitment to learning to be a researcher through play, through 
 
trial and error, through experiential learning?   
 
What does this mean in terms of T-Rs’ understanding of how children are 
 
learning? 
The myriad of questions and evidence of inter/intra-connectivity and relatedness 
between children, teachers and research rear up again, the business and messiness, 

 
221 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
with so many pushes/ pulls in different directions, some turn-taking is required as I try 
to deal with one issue at a time. Not taking issues in isolation or in ranking order but 
rather to give justice and time and space to think clearly. I promise to retrace these 
steps and consider the T-Rs’ understanding of how children learn later (7.7 pg.334).  
 
(For now I gently ask that idea to wait its turn as now I want to delve deeper into the 
idea of risk.) 
 
The perceived barriers to carrying out Children-as-Researcher projects are therefore 
visible, when one tries to look through the lens of the T-Rs. When initially considering 
Children-as-Researchers the barriers I experienced during the first phases of the 
research and documented previously can now be seen more clearly.  
 
The silence in response to invitations to participate and the hesitancy I encountered 
and explored in previous chapters The Weary Traveler and Finding the Way now come 
in to focus, helped with the backlighting, coming from a recognition of the power and 
strength of the influence of risk.  
 
To limit risk teachers want to provide structure and support and identify a focus for 
children.  And furthermore teachers want to select key children, reviewing Bradbury-

 
222 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Jones and Kellett explores this. Perhaps the idea of autonomous researchers may just 
be too risky, with little opportunity for teachers to oversee if this is the case.  
 
T-Rs demonstrated a concern about status quo being challenged and see potential 
risks if children are allowed a free hand.  
 
I read, hear and feel the sense of this when having to respond, albeit in my own 
reflections and deliberations, to a direct question asked of me, as the researcher, that 
I trip over when scrutinizing the questionnaire. A T-R in the survey responds to the 
question about barriers to carrying out projects with Children-as-Researchers by 
writing/asking ….. 
  
‘How do you know as teachers that the children’s evaluations of us are 
 
accurate?  
 
Rhetorical it may be but as a provocation I find myself trying to understand what is 
meant here, and what has unsettled the T-R, sensing both concern and anxiety.   
 
One interpretation sees an aversion to risk as being interlinked with the idea of 
protection, which may be linked to a justification for surveillance and control. However 
the T-Rs are holding tightly a dominant discourse of wanting to protect and maintain 

 
223 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
the innocence of children and childhood, which in itself is not uncontested but does 
resonate with the dominant, Western, romantic discourse of childhood.  
Why would they risk damaging the innocent child or placing the intricacies of 
professional and personal relationships at risk by opening up opportunities to dig more 
deeply and perhaps uncover that which is not fully understood by children, or the wider 
community, and is best kept under wraps? That is not to suggest that the T-Rs want 
to cover up or keep children or the wider community out but rather they want to 
maintain the status quo, and that this maintenance role is the preferred course of 
action.  
 
For those  T-Rs who have involved children in research projects, through the act of 
taking control, teachers are providing a ‘secure’/RISK AVERSE  environment for those 
children to be successful, in so far as the teachers understand the purpose, design 
and participation in research.  
 
Risk again features here when trying to unpick research that has been carried out in 
school. The purpose of research sits well within the aim of evaluation and measuring 
impact. Even this is deemed to be risky for one T-R who identified that the process for 
planning their research involved a series of questions to be asked of the children that 
were ‘Approved by the Senior Management Team’.   
 

 
224 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Seeking validation from senior colleagues adds a layer of protection for staff, and as 
considered in previous chapters ‘The Weary Traveler’ and ‘Finding the Way’ is another 
barrier for the sort of research that intrigues me. I wonder if for some T-Rs there is a 
glimpse of seeing children as a threat, professionally, especially if the research they 
consider is linked to evaluation and feedback. Cautiously then I see T-Rs oscillating 
between needing to protect children, and needed to be protected from children.  
 
Pondering this further I ask the question of myself:  
 
 What it that schools and teachers are afraid of?  
 
 Is it all about accountability?  
 
Another line of flight…. 
 
 
6.3.8 Going off the beaten track…..Children Silenced. 
 
The idea of child- led research as a professional threat to teachers continues, taking 
me along previously unthought-of pathways of alternative interpretations. I wonder if 
the impact of the risk adverse behaviour is about protecting teachers not children. 
The opening question in the survey ‘Can children be researchers?’, is followed up 
by an invitation to T-Rs to explain their responses – positive responses included key 

 
225 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
words such as ‘voice’, ‘empowerment’, ‘opinions matter’, all of which would be 
expected and have been discussed in section 6.3.3 Well Travelled Routes – Children 
as Competent Research Participants (pg.208ff). However, I wonder how these 
concepts are to be seen within a school context, previously not noticed, that promotes 
emotional protection, safety and security.  
Overprotection limits opportunity and resilience (and here I wonder if this relates to 
children’s or teachers’ resilience? – one or other or both?).   
Overprotection that can be interpreted as being suffocating and smothering. If this is 
the case then such an environment, for some T-Rs, rather than empowering children, 
disempowers children.  
Where teachers are limiting participation in research by selecting children, taking 
control over structure and organisation, and the context of research, essentially the 
who, how, what, where and when of Children-as-Researchers then, despite the 
positive explanations offered by teachers so emphatically, children are being silenced 
and bounded in a particular sphere of action .  
 
The irony is then that in trying to promote one kind of children’s voice teachers are 
actually closing down the opportunities for voices to be heard in other more 
autonomous ways. In this way one could argue that children are rendered powerless 
by the protection of teachers.  
 

 
226 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
However, if the risk adverse behaviour is interpreted as being the result of teachers 
perceiving the ‘voice’ of a child as a professional threat, and a challenge to the status 
quo, then the converse may be true. In such an environment it may be the children 
who actually hold the power at play to promote and provoke different ways for teachers 
to consider their learning, their individuality, and their opinions with regards to the 
learning environment that is school. The power they hold then may in itself be the 
threat that teachers are responsive to, and this is seen in the empty spaces of 
Children-as-Researchers. 
 
In the survey, when T-Rs were asked if they had ever involved children in research 
the dominant response was NO. At a surface level this could be understood in relation 
to the previous discussion, and the dominantly held discourses of childhood held by 
teachers.  
 
But…. 
 It is interesting however to look at how children have been involved in research from 
the few participants who responded ‘YES’.   
 
Those few T-Rs who identified that children had been involved in research, specified 
that this was in action research and in evaluations of curriculum activities or school 
environments.  

 
227 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
The T-Rs’ narratives told of children being involved but in a way that research was 
done to them, the concept that Kellett (2010) refers to as research on children as 
opposed to with or by.  
In this case the idea of the aim of children’s involvement in research being to explore, 
examine and understand the lives of children becomes more distanced.  
The opinion or experiences of children who participated in research that the T-R’s 
reported on, were not at the heart of the research question; rather it was the role-play 
area, the playground, the library that is the focus of the research.  
 
 
‘Children were asked to review the playground and to give some ideas about 
 
how it could be improved’ 
 
 
‘My research with children looked at children’s engagement with the role play 
 
areas and how boys and girls used this space differently – we then made 
 
changes to encourage boys to get more involved’. 
 
 
‘We looked at how they [children] liked new maths games and how these 
 
impacted on the lower achieving children.’  
 

 
228 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
In the narratives of the T-Rs the impact of a lesson or theme planned becomes the 
focus of investigation. Children’s views are part of the T-Rs data sets but only in so far 
as they are triangulated with adult views, with quantitative data that measures 
attainment and progress, levels, grades and outcomes.  
 
For one T-R the focus and impact of breakfast cereal on children’s attainment is at the 
heart of the research. I wonder how this, even given in isolation, can enable an 
understanding of children’s lives. The underlying thoughts are that this approach to 
research benefits teachers and schools rather than children, individually or collectively. 
In an era of accountability maybe this isn’t surprising but the aim of research being 
about measuring impact on children is dominant and calls to be revisited in other 
domains… Teachers-Research-Children.  
 
The value of Children-as-Researchers, according to the T-Rs can be seen not just in 
the comments about children’s ‘voice’ and ‘empowerment’. In response to the question 
asking about outcomes of previous research with children that had been undertaken I 
am drawn to this comment, the sense as well as vocabulary and punctuation. 
They backed up our thinking, usually! 
 
We are familiar with the idea of children’s emotional needs being met through secure 
attachments with key persons, maybe what we see here is that need reciprocated..?  

 
229 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
In this way this T-R is seeking affirmation from the children that they care about and 
that are the focus of their professional love/care. Seeing the comment in isolation our 
attention is drawn to the use of punctuation, in this case the carefully posed... comma, 
followed by the word USUALLY.  
 
Taking this need for affirmation with the earlier discussion about risk I can notice hints 
from the T-Rs whose levels of confidence are waning as they explore their values, 
perceptions and beliefs, initially about research and research with children, but in 
doing expose their underpinning perceptions of children and the complexity of their 
relationship with those children.  
 
…..Later I wonder what would happen if children didn’t back up the teacher’s thinking? 
Would this be riskier or dangerous…for children…or for those who teach them?? 
6.4 Spaghetti Junction. 
 
Living in the Midlands the image of Spaghetti Junction is such a familiar one, being a 
child of the 1970s this was something I dreamt of seeing; the name, the news coverage 
of this feat of engineering and transportation intrigued me. Well at this junction then, 
this spaghetti junction, I am conscious of not just the messiness but the troublesome 
task of trying to unpick this concept of Children-as-Researchers. I am creeping now 
towards the trail that will take me a step away from the children, I am not excluding 
children from my analysis, and they remain there, but are for the time being placed in 
my peripheral vision. And become slightly out of focus. 

 
230 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Relationships and professional emotional resilience become another line of flight that 
teases and beckons, and certainly one that I had no awareness of before starting the 
research and commencing on this journey of discovery. So I started with the children 
as my focus and came to a place whereby I realised that teachers, and their 
professional identities, was now the necessary direction of travel, a new route to be 
explored. I come to appreciate that the key to understanding Children-as-Researchers 
is to more fully understand the role of teachers who bestow this highly valuable gift of 
research. Phase 1 saw me identify the need to attempt to answer the question ‘How 
is children’s participation within the field of education understood by children 
and other stakeholders?’  And whilst teachers were always in my sights I started this 
journey considering other stakeholders, exo and macro system level (Bronfenbrenner 
1979). The secret pathway revealed in the undergrowth at this junction takes me along 
a completely different voyage of discovery, that being to problematise both teachers’ 
roles, and identities, in child-led research, which is where I propose to travel next.

6.5 Children-as-Researchers within the domain –  
Teachers-Research-Children 
 
 
Figure 11 - Facet of Teacher within the domain of Teachers-Research-Children 
 
Adopting this diffractive analysis allows me to move now to a different facet of the 
wider subject, (Figure 11), having examined the responses to the survey to glean an 
understanding of the how Teacher-Respondents viewed children in relation to 
research, the focus now moves to Teacher-Respondents themselves. How do they 
see their role and responsibility in relation to Children-as-Researchers? What skills do 
they believe are necessary to be an effective practitioner and what is the relationship 
between these and the skills of being an active researcher? 
 

 
232 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
To ascertain this, questions were posed asking about the Teacher-Respondents’ 
research experience, both current and previous, as well as asking them to identify 
what would support them in carrying out research with children, and additionally what 
barriers might be present. Perceptions of the skills needed to carry out research were 
gleaned through using scaled responses to statements. A series of skills and attributes 
were presented and Teacher-Respondents were asked to prioritise them in relation to 
the necessary skills for effective practitioners, and later skills needed for effective 
researchers. The responses to the questionnaires will now be explored adopting a 
CHQ approach in order to offer the headlines.  
                                                                    
 
6.5.1  Well-travelled routes – Teachers’ Roles and Responsibilities 
…Children and Research (IMPACT). 
 
Initial analysis of the data produced showed that nearly all Teacher-Respondents, (92 
percent), have management roles in their schools. When asked to elaborate on this 
the Teacher-Respondents identified themselves as Head Teachers, Deputy Head 
Teachers, Executive Head Teachers and Senior Managers. A small number of 
classroom teachers responded, 4 in total. The high proportion of senior leaders who 
responded suggests a positive response to the idea of research in schools, at least 
from a management perspective. However the analysis offered here will include data 
from both managers in schools and teachers who are classroom based in order to give 
further insight to any interpretation.  

 
233 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
Nearly all Teacher-Respondents, (95 percent), had had experience of conducting 
research previously and identified that they had carried out a research project linked 
to their highest qualification. For most of these respondees (nearly 70 percent) their 
highest qualification was completed more than 5 years ago. However, in comparison 
very few respondees had carried out any research since completing this qualification, 
only 25 percent. As has previously been noted the Teacher-Respondents’ main focus 
of research appears to be evaluative, with a direct aim to evaluate practice or measure 
children’s progress. This focus on IMPACT is clear, with that term being used 
frequently when outlining previous research or in relation to ideas about potential 
research. Teacher-Respondents offered the following potential research ideas: 
 
 ‘Effectiveness of intervention programmes on English and  
 
 
           
 
 Mathematics’ 
 
 ‘Impact of setting and grouping’ 
 
 ‘Impact of international dimensions in primary schools’ 
 
 ‘Impact of arts education on pupil confidence and attainment’ 
 
 ‘Impact of new curriculum on self-esteem and progress in the less able’ 
 
The same message about the importance of IMPACT on teacher’s roles and 
responsibilities can be seen when considering some of the issues regarding both 
barriers to carrying out research, and the benefits of research in schools. For example 

 
234 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
in answer to the question ‘What might encourage you to carry out research in early 
years settings or schools?’ Teacher-Respondents referred again to the importance 
of ‘impact’ by answering: 
 
 ‘Assurance that there would be impact’ 
 
 ‘If it would inform practice’ 
 
 ‘If it has a positive impact on children learning’ 
 
 ‘If it would change things, improve how we teach the children’ 
 
It would seem that IMPACT is a dominant discourse within a school environment, and 
the suggestion is that teachers are using this term to describe not just their 
performance of research but the value associated with that research performance, 
which is directly linked to children’s progress towards identified targets. The 
dominance of the results driven agenda within schools in the UK has been well 
documented and discussed, particularly by Ball (2003, 2005, and 2016). The 
performativity agenda, directly linked to the idea of impact is one that demands that 
teachers respond to targets and evaluations. The emphasis of Children-as-
Researchers in relation to evaluation of teachers’ performance can be seen to be a 
natural extension and perhaps a direct result of the performativity agenda. Ball (2003) 
argues that in response to performativity teachers develop a ‘passion for excellence’ 
(pg 215). This craving for excellence and self –interest, as a result of performativity, 
may also explain why participants ranked Team Player as being least important when 

 
235 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
asked to rank a series of skills and attributes needed to make an effective practitioner 
(See Figure 12). 
 
 
Figure 12 – What makes an effective practitioner? 
 
Ball (2016) presents the idea that schools are governed by numbers and that 
measuring and monitoring techniques, which are dependent on numbers, have 
become the strategies that underpin ‘reflection and representation’ and are used to 
demonstrate the quality of education. He discusses the idea that this dependency on 
numbers, measuring and monitoring, is a clear indicator of the dominance of neoliberal 
ideas in schools which are underpinning school policy. Ball (2016) also argues that the 
dominance of neoliberalism is also evident in how teachers respond to the 
performativity agenda itself. In addition he argues that teachers can be seen to be 
investing in themselves in order to not only improve performance, but to link this 
performance to financial reward. Whilst ultimately it is managers that make final 
decisions about any financial reward, teachers are, according to Ball (2016), seen to 

 
236 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
be responding to the environment they find themselves working in. These financial 
rewards may take the form of performance related pay or additional funding for specific 
subject areas or projects that have a personal interest to individual teachers, hence 
there is also a financial motivation. This link to financial reward and investment is seen 
in the survey when participants responded to the question: 
 ‘What might encourage you to carry out research in early years settings or 
schools?’ 
Teacher-Respondents identified that finances, or a lack of, contributed to their decision 
as to whether or not to carry out research when they replied as follows: 
 
 ‘Time limited grants to support staff.’ 
 
 ‘Funding.’ (3) 
 
 ‘Funding and seeing there is a beneficial end point.’ 
 
 ‘If I thought results would cause changes to be implemented - studies  
 
 are sometimes done and they have no impact because the cost  
 
          
 
 implications of rolling out change are too much.’ 
 
 ‘Support, funding, or even minimal finding to make the research cost  
 
 neutral to the school.’ 
 
The rise of neoliberalism in an educational context, as indicated in these responses 
reflects the accountability agenda which may well be the dominant discourse in 
education that in itself acts as a barrier to research. As schools have become 

 
237 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
constructed to produce highly individualised professionals, the idea of undertaking 
research with, or without, children may well prove to be too risky, not only in terms of 
evidencing positive, or indeed negative outcomes in relation to children’s performance, 
and by default teacher performance,  but too risky in terms of investing money, time, 
and energy. Davies and Bansel (2007) argue that as a result of the rise of 
neoliberalism in education, financial outcomes and cost effectiveness become a 
priority over social welfare and that ‘all aspects of social behaviour are rethought along 
economic lines’ (pg. 249). The idea of cost effectiveness, or indeed as cited above 
‘cost-neutral’, is upper most in the minds of these leaders and managers in schools. 
Whilst finances appear to be limited another key resource, TIME, as a commodity, is 
also considered to be limited, because of other priorities, and acts as a considerable 
barrier to conducting research with children in schools, and will now be discussed. 
 
 
6.5.2 Well-travelled routes – Teachers’ Roles and Responsibilities 
…Children and Research (TIME). 
 
As previously noted when considering the design for my research, TIME played a 
significant part in decisions made in distributing the survey. Not surprisingly TIME 
became a major theme when analysing, through a CHQ approach, the data produced 
through the survey. When asked ‘What might discourage you from carrying out 
research in early years settings /schools?’ Teacher-Respondents identified that 
whilst external factors such as OFSTED inspections and focusing on attainment were 

 
238 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
barriers, the most significant barrier was TIME. As can be seen by the chart below 
(Figure 13), 31% of Teacher-Respondents identified this to be the case. 
               
 
Figure 13 – What might discourage you from carrying out research in school/setting? 
 
The ‘barriers’ pre-selected in this question had all previously been identified by pilot 
survey participants and replicate the difficulties in carrying out research as previously 
identified by Cordingley et al (2003), Edwards and Fowler (2007), Leat, Lofthouse, and 
Reid (2014), as well as Reeves and Forde (2004). In a similar way to Newman and 
Mowbray (2012), and discussed in the literature review, managing time can be said to 
be a priority for Teacher-Respondents in this survey. Newman and Mowbray (2012) 
identified that for teachers in their study ‘time almost became akin to a member of the 
group as it dominated conversations’ (Newman and Mowbray 2012:461). This same 
feature is replicated here, with time being identified as both a barrier to carrying out 
What might discourage you from carrying out research in 
school/settings?

RJLowe  
 
 
 
research and as something that prevents Teacher-Respondents from promoting 
Children-as-Researchers. 
 
Noticeably, 68% of Teacher-Respondents identified that having ‘more time’ would 
encourage them to carry out research in early years settings or schools, reflecting also 
the idea that research has a ‘add on’ value in schools. With 58% of Teacher-
Respondents also identifying that a lack of time was a barrier to children designing 
and carrying out their own research.  For example barriers to children designing and 
carrying out their own research were identified as: 
 
 ‘Time, pressure of the curriculum, testing government targets’. 
 
 ‘Time in the curriculum to make mistakes, revisits etc.’ 
 
 ‘Time in the curriculum’. (2) 
 
 ‘Time’. (4) 
 
 ‘Time out of lessons’. (3) 
 
 ‘Time restraints in terms of coverage of the national curriculum’. 
 
 ‘Time, curriculum constraints (overloaded)’. 
 
Interestingly all Teacher-Respondents indicated that they valued research and 
believed it to be what should be underpinning practice and pedagogy, although it 
would seem that the external pressures, perceived or otherwise, resulted in very few 

 
240 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
teachers identifying themselves as being research active within the last 5 years (25%). 
Whether this is more about the demands of the teacher’s role or their attitudes to 
research in general, or indeed both, is not clear at this point but will be examined 
subsequently. What this does show however is that the Teacher-Respondents have a 
clear and confident ability to voice the importance they place on delivering the National 
Curriculum and to see this as key to their role. Significantly though the Teacher-
Respondents, remembering that the majority in the study are leaders and managers 
of schools, identify Children-as-Researcher projects as being additional to the 
curriculum, and are not interpreted as potentially being an integral part of the taught 
curriculum. In order to understand how Teacher-Respondents perceive the curriculum, 
and principles relating to pedagogy, a further scrutiny of data produced by the survey 
has revealed some interesting perceptions of pedagogy and curriculum.  
 
6.5.3 Well-travelled routes – Teachers’ Roles and Responsibilities 
…Children and Research (CURRICULUM, ONTOLOGY, AND 
PEDAGOGY). 
 
As has been previously considered (Beycioglu, Ozer and Ugurlu 2009, Newman and 
Mowbray 2013, Leat, Lofthouse and Reid 2014, and of course the seminal work of 
Stenhouse 1981, teachers’ experience of research is predominantly in relation to 
curriculum planning and development, and this position is replicated in the survey. 
Added to this though is the Teacher-Respondents’ position as they prioritise the 
delivery of the planned curriculum, particularly given the dominant view that sees 

 
241 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Children-as-Researcher projects as sitting outside of the taught curriculum as an extra 
curricula activity. 
 
When considering attitudes to carrying out research, in addition to TIME being the 
main barrier, Teacher-Respondents also commented on the constraints of the 
curriculum, and indeed the emphasis being on children’s attainment in relation to the 
planned curriculum, as can be seen below, (Figure 14).  As such this is illustrative of 
a powerful discourse within the school environment.   
 
Figure 14 – Factors that discourage research in schools/settings: ranked order 
 
The idea of attainment against curriculum areas and the emphasis placed on this in 
schools can be seen again in response to the question ‘What, if any, would be the 
barriers to children designing and carrying out their own research?’ Teacher-
Respondents demonstrate how they believe the curriculum to be burdensome: 

 
242 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
 ‘The curriculum is already overloaded –how does carrying out research  
 
 projects prepare them to be age related as dictated by the DfE?’ 
 
 ‘Demands of the curriculum and timetable.’ 
 
 ‘Coverage of the National Curriculum.’ 
 
 ‘Restrictions by the curriculum in the educational setting.’ 
 
Similarly when asked if their school would promote the idea of Children-as- 
Researchers, Teacher-Respondents replied: 
 
 ‘Not sure this fits in with the curriculum’ 
 
 ‘The current curriculum does not allow for this sort of activity’ 
 
 ‘We would be keen, however as the curriculum stands there is little   
 
 time to do this sort of thing properly.’ 
 
In other questions Teacher-Respondents identified that children involved in research 
projects would benefit in a number of ways, mostly linked to ‘Voice’ and 
‘Empowerment’, but also in relation to other skills such as developing the ability to ask 
questions, literacy and numeracy skills, working as a group, social skills, problem 
solving, and communication skills, as well as critical skills. It is therefore interesting to 
note that Teacher-Respondents seem to be placing more importance on subject 
knowledge rather than broader, what may be called transferable skills, that they 
themselves have identified children could develop when taking part in Children-as-

 
243 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Researcher projects. Whilst these skills are within the National Curriculum itself they 
are not seen here to be as important as other aspects.  Given this I would argue that 
the Teacher-Respondents generally see their role in relation to children’s learning as 
deliverers and facilitators of a given curriculum. To understand what Teacher-
Respondents are saying here about their understanding of what, and how, children 
learn, I will draw on the work of Anne Sfard (1998) who considered the use of 
metaphors to understand, communicate and discuss more effectively theories of 
learning and knowledge.  
Sfard (1998) offers two opposing metaphors in relation to learning and knowledge 
namely the ‘Acquisition Metaphor’ and the ‘Participation Metaphor’ (see Table v). The 
Acquisition Metaphor, (which she abbreviates to AM in order to reduce ‘tiresome 
repetition’), she argues, is offered to reflect the idea of ‘knowledge acquisition’ and 
‘concept development’. For her, this is evident when we think about (in this case), the 
child’s mind as an empty vessel to be filled, and thus the child becomes the owner of 
said knowledge and concepts, and is able to use them in multiple contexts.  For Sfard, 
AM implies ‘there is a clear end point to the process of learning’ (1998:6).  The 
Participation Metaphor (PM) alludes to the idea that the learner, the child, is 
participating in various kinds of activities rather than in learning concepts. The idea of 
PM is that the learner is not just taking part in, but is part of, the new learning 
experience. It has to be said here that this is not the same as active learning nor social 
constructivism where learning is deemed to be part of a social interaction (Vygotsky 
1978). Sfard argues that there can be social elements within AM just as there could 
also be active learning experiences. However, the participatory element of PM 

 
244 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
features the idea that learning is more about movement and developing new learning 
and ideas, a move forward to new understandings not just knowing existing pre-
defined concepts. Teachers therefore are not the providers of knowledge or facilitators 
of learning but are expert participants learning alongside the learner. Essentially these 
metaphors illustrate an ontological position that help to understand the practice of 
learning and teaching.

For the Teacher-Respondents the emphasis placed on the delivery of the curriculum 
would indicate that the Acquisition Metaphor would best illustrate their ontological 

 
245 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
stance, which I would also argue is directly linked to the dominance of neoliberalism 
within education policy and practice in schools.  This is because it is knowledge as a 
commodity that is measured and valued, either as social capital for children, or as 
would seem to be the case for the Teacher-Respondents, as a measure of capability 
and unit of performativity (excellence) for teachers. Consequently, it is not surprising 
that the Teacher-Respondents place such a high value on the curriculum and adopt 
what Sfard identifies as the Acquisition Metaphor. Similarly, it is also not surprising 
then that there was a reluctance for Teacher-Respondents to move towards variation 
in the curriculum that would involve Children-as- Researchers projects that may in 
themselves be more akin to an ontological position that Sfard might describe using the 
Participation Metaphor.  
 
Moving on from ontology to pedagogy, Teacher-Respondents demonstrated an 
interest in evaluating pedagogical approaches when they suggested the following may 
be the focus of any future research: 
 
 ‘Effectiveness of intervention programmes’ 
 
 ‘Impact of setting and grouping’ 
 
 ‘Arts education and its effect on pupil confidence’ 
 
 ‘Learning identities/dispositions’ 
 

 
246 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Given the responses above there is little detail about what particular pedagogical 
approaches are of interest to Teacher-Respondents, although these broad outlines 
present a curiosity about how children are learning and not just what children are 
learning.  
Further examples of future research ideas relate broadly to curriculum areas: 
 
 ‘English – teaching creativity in writing’ 
 
 ‘History for lower achievers’ 
 
 ‘Mentoring to improve maths knowledge’ 
 
 ‘Hand-writing and creativity’ 
This would seem to suggest that Teacher-Respondents are predominantly interested 
in curriculum areas, and that whilst they are curious about pedagogy this is in relation 
to specific subject areas. This prioritising is also evident when Teacher-Respondents 
are considering the skills and attributes necessary to make an effective practitioner 
whereby the rate  ‘Good Subject Knowledge’ significantly higher than critical skills, 
such as being reflective and analytical, and the softer, personal teaching skills, such 
as rapport and being a team player (see Figure 15). This can also be said to indicate 
the dominance of the Acquisition Metaphor as proposed by Sfard (1998). 
 

 
247 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
Figure 15 – Skills/Attributes for Effective Practitioners 
 
 
Teacher-Respondents were asked if children could be researchers, with no one 
responding negatively. When asked to explain their response Teacher-Respondents 
gave explanations that would indicate their pedagogical position in terms of their 
understanding of how children learn. For example: 
 
 ‘They have enquiring minds and are curious, we need to respond to  
 
 that.’ 
 
 ‘Best way to learn…children learn quickest in first few years through  
 
 play and asking/doing.’ 
 
 ‘Independent learning.’ 
 
 ‘Children have a desire to explore and find answers.’

These reasons would suggest that Teacher-Respondents are familiar with, and adopt, 
values linked with active learning, constructivism and social constructivism, all 
classical theories of child development linked to the theories of Piaget and Vygotsky 
that have dominated education practice in UK the latter part of the 20th Century. In 
itself this is interesting as it would suggest that whilst the Teacher-Respondents have 
a clear recognition of the positive attributes of Children-as-Researcher projects this is 
diminished by the dominance of the AM as a teaching metaphor and ideology of 
participative practice is not an integrated feature of the pedagogical approaches 
adopted by, or considered to be worthy of research by the Teacher-Respondents.  
 
 
6.5.4 Summary (Trip Review). 
 
The pressures of accountability and performativity would seem then to impact not only 
on Teacher-Respondents’ self-identity but on their ontological stance and pedagogical 
decisions and, in this instance on their perceptions of Children-as-Researchers. The 
data from the survey would suggest that Teacher-Respondents are risk adverse, both 
in relation to Children-as-Researchers and the outcomes of any potential research, as 
well as how that research may be used to make judgements about teaching practices 
and the effectiveness of pedagogical decisions taken. This added to the idea that 
teachers place such importance on the delivery of the curriculum, through which they 
are judged and valued as a profession, it would seem then that the reluctance to 

 
249 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
undertake Children-as-Researcher projects, whilst in principle is something to be 
valued and promoted, in practice this becomes more problematic. 
 
6.5.5 Taking stock and preparing to go off the beaten track. 
 
I ask myself is this what is expected? Mindful that I am not about confirming existing 
knowledge but I am about new knowledge and new ways of revealing that knowledge 
I sit back and reflect on my response to this consciousness. 
 
A pause then….. 
 
Continuing with my diffractive approach I am urged by the data to explore further. 
There must be something more that I am missing here. I’m called again to move into 
a different direction. I revisit the responses that the Teacher-Respondents who are 
also leaders and managers in the schools make, I have a feeling and an emotional 
response that in terms of current practice in schools there is a gradual closing down, 
a diminishing commitment to the idea of Children-as-Researchers…  
…Whilst I can see the (perceived) danger in terms of teacher values and the risk linked 
to performance, I continue to hear the raising of the draw bridge, closing of the door, 
the locking of the gates and see this group of teachers not just as leaders in their 
schools but gatekeepers.  

 
250 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
By this I mean not only in relation to engaging participants, adults and children in 
research, but gatekeepers to learning and development.  
As decision makers, managers are leading the learning for their school, and 
subsequently are gatekeepers to what is learnt how and why. If research is not 
perceived as an integral part of the curriculum then there will be no research. 
Having already explored the role of gatekeepers in relation to ethics and as an integral 
part of onto-epistemological decisions explored within the chapters ‘Finding the Way’ 
and ‘Creating a Map’ I was not expecting to consider this again.  
That is not to say I had predicted the findings and analytical process in terms of where 
I would be going but my thinking was pulled up sharp to hear the data insisting that 
this concept is worthy of further positioning.  
The glowing data turns me in many directions, once again I am conscious of repetitions 
(oh the irony) of muddling myself so need to find a way of organising my emotive and 
cognitive responses to the data produced, for my benefit and for the benefit for the 
reader too.  
 
I move hesitantly forward in an attempt to capture that which is hidden from view, 
wondering if this is something that is SO well hidden as it remains in plain sight all 
along? 
 
 

 
251 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
6.5.6 Going off the beaten track……Gatekeepers to Research 
PARTICIPANTS. 
 
In trying to see the development of professional identities of the Teacher-Respondents 
I look again. I’m trying here to work out who they are, and how do they see their role 
in all of this? Why have they agreed to take part in the survey as a piece of research 
and in doing so appear to value it, yet I have a sense now that despite what I’m told 
there is a fear of, and a mistrust towards, the idea of research? Or a mistrust towards 
the researcher perhaps? 
 
Most Teacher-Respondents aligned themselves to leadership and management roles 
and as the recipient of the original email and invitation they then made the decision 
that they felt able, or best placed, to respond – which was what I asked of them…...  
Completing the survey themselves makes me wonder if this is in fact an indicator of 
their gatekeeping role.  
As gatekeepers to research about Children-as-Researchers, these leaders and 
managers take the responsibility to protect potential participants, the other teachers 
who were invited to complete the questionnaire.  
A gatekeeper will only allow the research to proceed once they feel satisfied that 
participants will not be at risk by taking part. By taking on the task of responding to the 
survey themselves, rather than forwarding to their staff I notice an extension of this 
role and the associated responsibilities.  

 
252 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
These gatekeepers could be protecting their staff who are perceived as being over 
stretched and as a result are vulnerable, for this is what the use of words such as 
‘overloaded’ to describe the constraints of the current curriculum would imply.  
 
The emphasis they place on accountability, impact and outcomes tells a story of a 
workforce who are stressed and as such are vulnerable. This buffer role taken by the 
leaders and managers may well explain why so few class based teachers responded.  
 
As gatekeepers they may not be denying the research but are making decisions about 
who participates, by responding themselves they clearly value the idea of the research 
and maybe found it stimulating and engaging, but they are not passing that 
invitation/experience on to their staff.  
 
That is not to say that the decision not to forward emails to staff was an obstructive 
decision, but rather a protective one. Given that time pressures, and the stress of the 
day to day work load of teachers has been previously noted, and furthermore 
vigorously stated, with CAPITAL LETTERS and exclamation marks [!!!] emphasising 
views communicated, perhaps the decision not to promote the survey with colleagues 
equally emphasises the huge responsibility felt by Leaders and Managers to protect, 
in this instance their staff… 

 
253 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 (So does this need to protect also explain the reluctance of the leaders to be involved 
in the initial stages of this whole piece of research when I was seeking involvement of 
children, as explored way back in Chapter 2: ‘The Weary Traveller’). 
 
But why?   Yes, I see the need to protect but is this protection at a personal level for 
colleagues who are tired and stressed or it is about protection of something else… 
 
Noting the tangled web of the issues here I have a sense, having re-considered 
previous ideas which suggested that my Teacher-Respondents perceive Children-as-
Researchers projects as being risky to children’s attainment and outcomes, according 
to their dominant ideas about what is valued as learning, that this may also be the 
conscious/subconscious roots of the decision to protect; children, staff, and 
furthermore, institutional reputation.  
 
Forwarding the opportunity to respond to a research questionnaire about attitudes to 
any aspect of school life requires an element of TRUST. In this case does the 
gatekeeper TRUST the researcher to report findings accurately and honestly, does 
the gatekeeper TRUST the participants that are being given permission to respond, to 
do so impartially, and finally does the gatekeeper TRUST themselves to be able to 
respond to whatever the outcomes of the research turn out to be.  

 
254 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
I consider all of these questions, and see that trust/mis-trust and the state of 
relationships between each stakeholder need to be acknowledged. TRUST as a 
foundation reduces any risk that may be present. Do these T-Rs as leaders of schools 
TRUST me?  
…..They don’t even know me, they know my professional reputation as an employee 
of my faculty so have a sense for TRUST towards the university and my professional 
background and identity.  
 
I wonder, if in my previous role as a leader and manager in school, would I have taken 
that risk as a gatekeeper, to actively promote my school’s participation in a research 
project such as this??  
So risk continues to be tugging at my sleeve, layers of risky business within this 
domain too. 
And whilst not necessarily taking a thematic approach to analysing the data I am noting 
that there is a flag that waves danger and I think this could be a point of intra-activity 
whereby risk is connected, not just to research, but to reputation and professional 
identity as well.  
Clearly the role the leaders and managers play, and their perspective of research in 
this study, is important and will be considered more fully momentarily, but at this point 
I am drawn again to the absences. As very few classroom teachers responded how 
can I begin to understand their specific position? Scrutinizing data again looking for 
the ‘overspill’ I see a clearing amidst it all. 

 
255 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
 I find the stories of two T-Rs who identify themselves as neither a leader nor manager. 
When probing the responses they make I can see a glimpse of how the impact the 
perspectives held by leaders and managers in relation to Children-as-Researchers is 
played out.  
 
Not looking for a pattern nor consistency, but being responsive to the role that the 
leaders and managers have as gatekeepers to research participants as such, I am 
drawn to these responses to the question: ‘Would your school promote the idea of 
Children as Researchers?’  
 
One narrative reveals the shared enthusiasm, coming from a head teacher to staff: 
‘Probably! (Very forward looking Principal, recognises that these are important 
life skills’. 
 
The other story discloses the role that leaders and mangers have in relation to giving 
permission to adopt new ideas such as Children-as-Researchers: 
‘Maybe, but support from senior managers is key’ 
I continued to wonder about these leaders and managers’ levels of interest in 
research; as leaders they do not just model and show the way but have a gatekeeping 
role, giving permissions, authorisation and consent to develop research, and of course 

 
256 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Children-as-Researcher projects. The power at play within their gatekeeping role is 
tangible in these responses and reflects the staff perceptions of this role. 
 
 
6.5.7 WARNING…..professional identity at RISK. 
 
As I review again the responses gathered I begin to feel the enormity of the task here, 
in trying to understand and come to some sort of position when I can offer an 
understanding - I am starting to feel entrapped. In trying to unravel I can only see 
frequent knots and a blurring of concepts, contexts and concerns. Emotionally I begin 
to sense the frustration again that I experienced at the initial phases of the research; 
that gatekeepers did not see the place of Children-as-Researchers as I did. Now 
though I am beginning to feel that maybe teachers in general do not see school based 
research as I do, let alone the place for children within that ideal. I need to respond to 
this some more to try to unpick how my Techer-Respondents see their role in their 
schools, to see if I can find a place for research within that role, and to capture that 
space and prepare that space to be inhabited with inquiry.  
 
Without further consideration I am in danger of developing, out of frustration, 
destructive feelings about my own professional identify and roots. Without further 
searching I run the risk of distancing my professional self even more from colleagues 
in schools, through disillusion to disassociation. Recognising in myself that this 

 
257 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
departure from my professional roots is not a welcome outcome, I start off again to re-
examine, re-consider and re-assess my encounters with the Teacher-Respondents. 
 
6.5.7.1 Afterthought……. 
 
[…..and as an afterthought this chosen way forward is about the rise and fall of 
emotions which whilst not a separate event in itself, is recognised here to demonstrate 
and acknowledge how I am an integral part of the thesis]. 
 
6.5.8 Going off the beaten track…..Gatekeepers to PROFESSIONAL 
ROLES. 
 
The T-Rs tell me that they strongly believe research should not just be carried out by 
academics and Higher Education Institutions, they believe in it and have had 
experience of it, so it comes as a surprise then when so many indicate that they are 
not currently doing research, and few have undertaken research since studying. 
Potential barriers have been identified earlier, re-visiting the comments I am becoming 
curious about how teachers see their role. I look again at how they replied when asked: 
‘What might encourage you to carry out research in early years settings or 
school?’ 
 
This time it isn’t about TIME or constraints of the curriculum, it’s about how teachers 
see themselves or otherwise, a comment that provokes me states that: 

 
258 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
‘I am happy for others to come in and do research but we haven’t  
 
done any ourselves’. 
 
I hear this T-R telling me that research is not the role of the teacher, it belongs to 
someone else.  
 
As a minor comment, that may not have been acknowledged if one was taking a CHQ 
approach, this throwaway remark attracts me.  
 
If initially teachers are saying they strongly believe that practitioners should be carrying 
out research but they don’t do it, is this driven by a stronger subconscious belief that 
they do not see research as part of their role? 
 
Revisiting that statement again I see for the first time links to emotions – the idea of 
being HAPPY in one’s professional role. 
 
 A turn of phrase perhaps, but nevertheless an emotional response when other 
responses remain emotionless.  
 
 
Happy for someone else – not me. 

 
259 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
  
Happy with the idea of research but not for me, or indeed us to do it.  
 
  
 
Happy in one’s professional identity perhaps?  
 
I sense in this comment a lack of confidence in getting involved in any research 
process, as well as an assertive statement that research is not the role of the teacher.   
In trying to explain why that may be the case for this T-R, I am drawn to the influence 
of emotions and the lack of emotional buy in to research in relation to the teacher’s 
role.  
 
Being so aware of my own emotional responses to, what has become a very personal 
research journey, I become more aware of the T-Rs emotional responses here and 
consider again the subtleties of this phrase.  
 
Professionally I see myself as an educator and an apprentice researcher, who is 
growing in confidence following an acceptance of the emotional impact of this research 
journey.  Accepting my emotions and the integration of them into the research, entirely 
unable to separate myself from the data, the analysis and the writing, is all part of the 
realisation of my ontological stance.  
 
I’m reminded of other emotions considered in relation to children/teachers/research, 
discussed previously – (trust, relationships, confidence, risk and resilience) - the 

 
260 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
complexity of the research focus becomes apparent again. It remains impossible to 
consider these domains, the place of research in understanding children lives, 
Children-as-Researchers and teachers’ roles in relation to these concepts, without 
acknowledging the internal experience of teachers, their emotional responses and how 
strong such emotions are in relation to professional identity, and roles and 
responsibilities. 
 
I wonder if the lack of active research projects in the study is more about the T-Rs 
finding emotional fulfillment in other aspects of their role, and that the challenges 
identified so far become emotional barriers to research and not just organisational or 
pedagogical barriers. Furthermore, as the T-Rs are so risk-adverse, for the reasons 
discussed above, they are unlikely to see engaging in this sort of research as 
conducive to happiness in their role, rather doing so would inevitably be a source of 
anxiety and unhappiness. 
 
Additionally, and as I am discovering there is always something else…. I wonder how 
the role of the teacher, what is expected and what is not, is decided at local level by 
the dominant discourses in the school and how much is defined by their pre-training 
and the standards and qualifications they achieve as their rite of passage to become 
a teacher?? A teasing line of flight appears, at this stage I’m not sure whether to follow 
or not? 

 
261 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The suggestion that carrying out research is not part of the teacher role is seen 
elsewhere in the T-Rs responses, with subtle uses of vocabulary, almost an 
explanation that ‘I don’t do research because I am not expected to’.  
Consider the comments here that say: 
‘I’m not studying at the moment’ 
and 
‘Having completed my MA a couple of years ago I have finished  
 
studying’ 
 
For these voices, (and I notice here that neither are class based teachers), there is a 
direct alignment of research with study, palpably reflecting their experience of it in their 
own educational careers. Moreover that study is not in the here and now. It has 
happened and is completed, presumably successfully, or it is something that will 
happen in the future. (Resonating here with Anne Sfard’s AM rather than PM). 
 
Therefore the implication is that research is not happening in the here and now either, 
it has been done or it may be done again but it is not part of the everyday role of the 
teacher at this point in time.  
 
Adding to this are the voices who identified that not being ‘required to do research’ 
was the barrier to doing research, I hear the insistent call to consider what place does 

 
262 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
research have in schools where it is happening? To try to discover that I know I need 
to explore the types of research that some T-Rs have offered to try to unpick the 
positioning of research in schools.  
What is happening, what is being researched, what approaches are being taken, what 
sort of contemporary experiences of research do teachers in schools have, but more 
importantly than the ‘what’ is the ‘why’.  
This becomes another illustration of the intersections between children – teachers – 
research, and at the moment it gently teases waiting to be examined in the final 
domain.  
 
For now though, if T-Rs have identified that research is not a priority as they don’t 
have to do it,  or are not studying at the moment,  I have a sense of needing to unpick 
this further, I’m provoked to see how my T-Rs view themselves as learners, is this just 
about studying or something else? A line of flight appears and beckons to be followed. 
 
  
 
6.5.9 Going off the beaten track……Gatekeepers to Research – 
KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING. 
 
Unpicking the T-Rs roles in relation to research, and specifically in relation to Children-
as-Researchers, enables me to consider their perceptions about personal learning 
more generally. I wonder then how do the T-Rs see learning in relation to themselves 

 
263 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
as learners, and furthermore is there a learning community for teachers within 
schools? Clearly learning is at the heart of the work that the T-Rs are doing, but are 
they just leading the learning or are they learners themselves?  
 
I am drawn to a comment made in response to the question ‘Can children be 
researchers?’ 
 
Amidst the responses that explain YES children can because they are competent, is 
one that ‘glows’ and ask me to notice, listen and interpret.  
 
‘Their creativity and lack of political constraints/awareness can be very  
 
beneficial!!’ 
 
 I notice the idea of creativity being offered. Influenced by Craft et al (2014), Cremin et 
al (2015) and Meyer and Eilifsen (2017), I am interpreting creativity to be linked to idea 
of originality and generation of new ideas, new solutions and new knowledge.  I listen 
and interpret the idea of children’s creativity to be a positive one, beneficial to their 
learning and to themselves. Beneficial too I wonder, to the T-Rs and teachers in 
general?  
 
Looking again though I am intrigued by the way this idea is expressed for example… 

 
264 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
…….the use of the word ‘Their’ (possessive pronoun) 
 And I ask…..is creativity something that belongs to children and not teachers?  
Do teachers have to perform to expectations whereby creativity is not valued or 
encouraged, a sort of conformity perhaps, conforming to leaders’ expectations, 
OFSTED expectations, and parental expectations?  
 
Is the data subliminally suggesting that teachers are not generating their own 
professional identity but that their identity is being generated for them, driven, 
developed and molded by something else – the external factors hinted at previously 
perhaps? 
 
I notice and listen to the punctuation used within the sentence –  
….the slash, the oblique slanting line that indicates ‘OR’ –  
…..and as such a sense of exclusivity.  
Either children have a lack of political ‘constraints’ OR ‘awareness’.  
There is a cautious use of / to soften the bold statement of political constraints – 
…does this imply there is a perceived lack of freedom by teachers, and the innocence 
of the child means they can be oblivious of this – not being politically aware?  
Looking at punctuation again….. 
 

 
265 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
How do we interpret the exclamation mark! – in this case TWO of them !! 
Used in writing (drama, literacy, rarely in formal academic writing….…(…or is it?!?!).  
But why here?  
 
To denote humor, or emphasise strong feelings?   
 
  
Or to soften the blow of those strong feelings? 
 
The fact that an exclamation mark is not used anywhere else by this T-R is important 
and begins to make me think more about the idea of political sensitivities in school 
communities and how carrying out research is understood in relation to them. I suggest 
this is an intersection with the idea of emotions and relationships peeking through. 
 
And then as this thought prevails I see in the entanglement the intersection with the 
concept of RISK, discussed and explored in section 6.3.6 Going off the beaten track… 
Risky Play and again in section 6.5.7 WARNING…. Professional identity as RISK.  
 
And so it is that RISK is encountered at each layer of the data produced, and my 
analysis. But the RISK here is subtly different and triggers a revisiting of the dominant 
perceptions of children that the teachers hold. 
Research being risky for the T-Rs is evident but here we see the idea of creativity also 
being risky, although beneficial. Whilst creativity, and research as a creative process, 

 
266 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
is risky for teachers, it is less risky for children because of their innocence and 
immaturity, demonstrating the dominant discourse of children that the T-Rs hold. If 
children have a lack of awareness of the political agenda (which denies or limits 
creativity) then it means that children can be excused for not toeing the party line – (to 
continue with the political analogy).  
 
BUT –looking closer I notice another quietly spoken idea that would be ignored given 
a CHQ approach.   
In response to the question ‘Would your setting promote the idea of children as 
researchers?’ 
 One participant comments: 
‘Maybe, but our focus remains on attainment and this can limit 
 
innovation and creativity’. 
 
A telling and, to acknowledge my emotions again, a sad binary, that there can be no 
creativity or innovation when focussing on attainment. 
Only two T-Rs make the link between research and creativity throughout the survey, 
in both case there is a sense of regret, one covers this with humour, exclamation marks 
and alludes to the political agenda and children being innocent of that.  
 

 
267 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The second T-R is more open in the reason for a cautious level of commitment, 
indicating that the current agenda has a negative impact on creativity, alluding to the 
fact that Children-as-Researcher projects are both innovative and creative.   
 
The use of BUT immediately implies reservation, apology and introduces the idea that 
innovation and creativity are a contrast to the focus on attainment. This contrast 
mirrors the position that research and Children-as-Researcher projects are not an 
integrated part of the curriculum in such a way that there is a sense of regret.  
 
And there in the background I find a further overspill, the same sense of regret 
contained in a brief comment in reply to the question  
 
‘What would encourage you to carry out research in early years settings 
 
or schools?’ 
The answer comes back: 
‘A school which celebrated teachers as learners’. 
 
The key word here being celebrated – a longing here for recognition of learning for 
learning’s sake. A yearning for development, new knowledge and new learning to be 
welcomed, valued and honoured. 
 

 
268 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Recognising the influence held by the leaders of schools (Head Teachers), the 
gatekeepers of knowledge and learning, it would seem here that this T-R holds a 
different, perhaps conflicting position to their leaders, in relation to personal 
development and the place of learning and research in teachers’ lives.  
 
Scrutinizing their response further I notice something I had overlooked before – this 
response comes from a participant who, whilst identifying themselves as having a 
leadership role in the school, although not a Head Teacher nor a classroom teacher, 
but has described themselves  as ‘CPD – Continuous Professional Development 
Coordinator’.  
 
The use of this label presents a teacher who identifies themselves as a leader of 
learning not just for children but for colleagues, as someone who takes an active 
interest in the need to develop skills and new learning. From this position I notice 
someone who views research as an integrated part of the teaching and learning 
experience, for both children and teachers alike.   
 
The lone voice here makes me reflect on how these identities are developed and how, 
for the most they would appear to be a coming together of dominant identities. 
Intrigued I feel a sense of curiosity and again, from an emotional perspective, 
confidence, that validates the digging deeper and unpeeling of layers that will follow 

 
269 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
later as I explore this aspect, this line of flight, through analysis and discussion to 
come. 
 
I am drawn to the very final, and comparatively lengthy, comment in answer to the 
question  
 
‘What, if any, would be the barriers to children designing and carrying  out 
 
their own research?’  
 
This gives an insight into a teacher making a link between research and leaning, and 
the emancipatory elements of learning that are offered here. 
 
‘Restrictions in the educational setting…never having the opportunity to 
 
develop the skills.  The answers above [referring to previous level of 
 
confidence about research by children] depend on the school…is the 
 
school giving the skills needed to be researchers or restricting their 
 
freedom to learn?’ 
 
 I am drawn to this comment, and its binary position, not least as it is the most detailed 
response that offers more than just the expected naming of time and curriculum as 
barriers. Here I see a reflective teacher who is considering the benefits of research 
and how this is gifted to children – with skills being GIVEN. There is an impression of 
research as being EMANCIPATORY as demonstrated by the link to freedom to learn.  

 
270 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Taking this with the other, albeit solo voices that provoke a reflection on teachers as 
learners I contemplate on the rhizomatic connections between knowledge, learning 
and freedom for teachers.  
The Head Teachers are gatekeepers not only in terms of protecting their staff, and 
children, as vulnerable research participants, but protecting teachers as overworked 
vulnerable colleagues. I can see the shadow of a stance that also sees the vulnerability 
of a school’s reputation if teachers are distracted from the delivery of the curriculum 
by undertaking Children-as-Researcher projects.  
And there in the shadows I also see the forming of an idea that the Head Teachers 
are also gatekeepers to learning, not just in terms of the curriculum and pedagogical 
approaches, but of new learning that may in itself be seen as a threat to professional 
identity. The risk perceived by these gatekeepers may also be the risk of how to 
respond to new ideas, innovation and creativity, and the new knowledge gained, or as 
I prefer, revealed by research. 
 
6.5.10 
Checking the map – Crossroads Ahead. 
 
Time to move on, no resting place yet, my deliberations tempt me in all directions. I 
remain however within the terrain of Children-as-Researchers, but this time I focus on 
how the Teacher-Respondents are viewing research itself, hinted at here in relation to 
their role, but now I move on to hold this adjacent facet to the light to attempt to 
understand the complexities of the relationship between research, children, and 
teachers.

RJLowe  
 
 
 
6.6 Children-as-Researchers within the domain –  
Research-Children-Teachers  
 
 
Figure 16 – Facet of Research within the domain of Research-Children-Teacher 
 
Firstly this section will, through adopting a conventional humanist qualitative approach, 
draw upon the data produced by the survey to examine and analyse where and how 
research features within a teacher’s professional life. Figure 16 illustrates that whilst 
research is the focus of this section, this can only be understood in relation to children 
and teachers. The initial questions in the survey sought to elicit the Teacher-
Respondents’ experience of conducting research, including approaches and 
methodologies adopted, as well as attitudes and values towards educational research. 
A combination of open and closed questions, along with scaled responses to given 
statements, helps indicate where the teachers in this survey see themselves in relation 

 
272 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
to research, and importantly what their research ideas and future plans entail. As with 
the previous explorations of my identified domains, I will initially report giving the 
headlines that are embedded on the ‘well-trodden routes’ and then ‘go off the beaten 
track’ in order to search for the ‘overspills’. 
 
 
6.7 Well-travelled routes - Research – Teacher Attitudes. 
  
Teacher-Respondents presented as having a very positive attitude towards research 
in general. In response to statements about the place of research within education 
80% of Teacher-Respondents indicated that they thought educational research should 
be carried out by practitioners/teachers, with 18% strongly agreeing. Similarly 96% of 
Teacher-Respondents believed that Government Policy in education should be based 
on research, with no participant disagreeing /strongly disagreeing with this statement. 
The importance of research in relation to educational practice, as well as policy, was 
seen again when Teacher-Respondents were asked if what happens in school should 
also be based on research, with 75% of teachers agreeing or strongly agreeing. When 
considering who should be carrying out educational research 75% of Teacher-
Respondents believed that it should not only be academics that carried out the 
research, and similarly 82% of Teacher-Respondents indicated that as professionals 
they should not just focus of children in schools, but should be also focusing on 
research.  
 

 
273 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
This positive response would seem to mirror the findings of Newman and Mowbray 
2012, Leat, Lofthouse and Reid (2014), Leat, Reid and Lofthouse (2015) as well as 
Fordham (2016) discussed in the review of literature. Although, as Leat et al (2015) 
acknowledge, there are few if any systematic reviews of teacher involvement in and 
with research, and they, as indeed am I, are dependent on teachers’ voices captured 
in research that is generally focusing on other issues. 
 
62% of Teacher-Respondents had previously carried out some form of educational 
research as part of their highest qualification and this can also help to understand high 
levels of confidence in their relationship with research.  In relation to qualifications 68% 
of Teacher-Respondents identified as having postgraduate qualifications with the 
remaining having first degrees.  46% of teachers in the survey had studied Masters 
Degrees (MA, MEd, MPhil) with one Teacher-Respondent having achieved a 
Doctorate. Leat et al (2015) citing McLaughlin, Black-Hawkins and McIntyre (2004) 
identifies that there are three purposes in the teacher researcher tradition. The first 
being linked to personal inquiry, which they suggest takes the form of action research 
and professional reflection, the second being research for political reasons, for 
example concerns for democracy and transformation of society (school communities), 
and the third tradition being about school improvement. 
 
Teacher-Respondents continue to demonstrate this positive attitude towards the place 
of research, and their relationship with it, as 58% of respondees indicate that they 

 
274 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
would like to carry out research in their school or setting. Teacher-Respondents 
identify a range of future initiatives that demonstrate a range of interests, including 
intervention programmes, children’s mental health and the impact of arts education on 
pupil confidence, all of which demonstrate each of the three purposes McLaughlin, 
Black-Hawkins and McIntryre (2004), in Leat et al (2015), identify.  
 
When thinking about Children-as-Researchers the Teacher-Respondents are equally 
positive in response to the question ‘Can children be researchers?’ whereby 82% 
answered yes with a further 18% responding maybe. This suggests not just a belief in 
children’s capabilities but that the Teacher-Respondents know and understand 
enough about conducting research that they see children as being competent to also 
undertake research, even if they have not carried out research with children previously 
(65%).  
 
Having seen how teachers view research in general, the survey then moved on to 
explore Teacher-Respondents’ previous experience of carrying out research in 
educational settings. 
 
6.7.1 Well-travelled routes -Research – Teacher Experience. 
 
As expected Teacher-Respondents have had a variety of research experiences, 
mostly these were linked to studying and their most recent qualification, which for most 

 
275 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Teacher-Respondents was obtained over 5 years ago - 67%.  For clarification, when 
considering Teacher-Respondents’ experience of research my focus here was their 
relationship not just with research, i.e. keeping up to date with latest developments in 
subjects or the discipline of education, but rather their involvement in research  as 
researchers whereby they are engaging in enquiry-orientated practice (BERA 2014b).  
  
Only 25% of Teacher-Respondents had conducted research in schools, or early years 
settings, since they completed their highest qualification. As discussed previously, 
(6.5.1 - pg 232 ff and 6.5.2 pg 237 ff), barriers to carrying out research have been 
identified by the Teacher-Respondents, the most significant being time for research 
and the dominance of attainment and targets. In addition to this as noted in section 
6.5.2 Well travelled routes – Teacher roles and Responsibilities Children and 
Research (IMPACT), that Teacher-Respondents’ focus for their research was 
predominantly identified as research linked to impact. Fordham (2016) further 
suggests that there are two broad traditions of teacher research, one being a reflective 
approach, often linked to CPD, and a local impact study. This reflective research is 
strongly influenced by the idea of reflection and professionalism being interlinked 
(Schon 1983). The current era of accountability and performativity, as suggested by 
Ball (2001, 2003, 2008, and 2015) goes some way to explain how and why this sort of 
research dominates teacher research experience. A second approach, according to 
Fordham (2016) is one that focuses on pedagogical knowledge production that moves 
beyond local contexts to potentially have a wider influence on practice and policy. 

 
276 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Teacher-Respondents in my study disclosed that their research all fell into the first 
category. 
 
When asked to give further information about research contexts Teacher-
Respondents identified that they had undertaken their research in a variety of settings 
but for most Teacher-Respondents their research had been carried out in primary 
schools, whereby one Teacher-Respondent identified that this was within a ‘Key Stage 
2 Setting’ and one other identified that their research had been based in a ‘mixed-aged 
classroom’.  
 
The survey asked Teacher-Respondents to identify who had participated in their 
research, again answers were varied but included, children, teachers, teaching 
assistants and parents, and with one saying they had involved other Head Teachers 
within the local authority. 
 
When considering the methodology and methods Teacher-Respondents had adopted 
for their research again a range were commented on. Most frequently Teacher-
Respondents reported they had used questionnaires and interviews, with four 
commenting on the use of observations. One commented that they had undertaken a 
‘Social Survey’ and two Teacher-Respondents noted they had adopted ‘Action 
Research’ as an approach. Teacher-Respondents noted the use of various methods 

 
277 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
adopted but only one commented specifically on methodological stances, saying that 
they had adopted ‘Mixed methods -combined qualitative and quantitative methods’.  
 
Topics that Teacher-Respondents had researched varied tremendously, but all had 
very generic themes. Very little information was given about specific questions or 
indeed titles for research. Interestingly when reporting on research undertaken as part 
of their studies most topics were not directly related to specific curriculum subjects for 
example –  
 
 ‘Boys and Role Play’  
 
 ‘Children with Emotional and Behavioral difficulties’  
 
 ‘The Effects of Labeling Children’  
 
 ‘Race and Education’ 
 
 ‘Feedback’  
 
 ‘Dyslexia’ 
This may be explained as Teacher-Respondents reported they had undertaken their 
highest qualifications more than five years previously, it could therefore be that the 
performativity and impact agenda that is so prevalent currently was not so embedded 
at that time, particularly within Primary School education. Alternatively it could be that 
the participants were not in positions of responsibility at that time and were therefore 
not looking for research to validate or to measure their practice, and outcomes, for the 
children they were responsible for. This would also make sense as the research they 

 
278 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
reported on had been linked to study; so for example as trainee teachers or early 
career teachers they would not have had the same sort of responsibilities that they 
carry now as leaders and managers in schools and settings.  
 
The idea of professional responsibility in schools influencing research decisions, and 
in particular that with further experience comes more responsibility, is also evident in 
the subtle shift in the noted methodology and methods that the Teacher-Respondents 
identified as being adopted in research conducted since studying for their highest 
qualification.  
Teacher-Respondents noted they had now used: 
 
 ‘Action Research’ (3) 
 
 ‘Selected Case studies and measured progress against non-case   
 
 studies’ 
 
 ‘Practical teaching and reflecting and measuring outcomes from  
 
 
 strategies adopted.’ 
 
Although far fewer Teacher-Respondents stated they had carried out research since 
studying their highest qualifications (25%), the beginnings of the impact of the 
accountability and performativity agenda can be seen. This is clear when considering 
the range of topics that have been researched. For example teachers now start to offer 
the following: 

 
279 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
 ‘Action Research measuring the impact of a new style of planning   
 
 adopted.’ 
 
 ‘Impact of e-readers.’ 
 
 ‘Measuring early reading skills.’ 
 
 ‘The use of constructive conversation to raise standards.’ 
 
The predictable use of interviews and questionnaires were noted and all of the more 
recent research projects had been carried out in the Teacher-Respondents own 
schools. The traditional qualitative research methods still remained of interest to the 
teacher researcher, although alternative methods such as quantitative analysis of 
marks and grades are beginning to be evident. Interestingly although 35% of Teacher-
Respondents noted that they had carried out research with children as active 
participants at some time, only two Teacher-Respondents identified that they had 
involved children as active participants in their most recent research undertaking. 
 
 
6.7.2 Well-travelled routes – Research- Teachers as Researchers. 
 
From the data already considered it is clear that very few Teacher-Respondents are 
currently research active. The reasons for this can be linked to professional identity, 
the current climate of performativity, and teachers’ perceived risk of conducting 
research.  However the Teacher-Respondents indicated that they would like to 

 
280 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
undertake some research and have emerging ideas in relation to this. When asked if 
they would like to carry out research in their setting nearly 60% of Teacher-
Respondents expressed an interest in this.  The topics identified suggests a bigger 
shift to measuring impact and are more tightly linked to curriculum and the 
implementation of various initiatives.  
 
Methods identified still highlight the teachers’ commitment to Action Research 
however no Teacher-Respondents identify the use of interviews or questionnaires as 
they had when considering previous research they had undertaken. This is may be 
linked to some professional uncertainty in carrying out research or indicative of the 
unrealistic expectation that teachers can be effective practitioners and effective 
researchers (Winch et al 2015).  
 
When considering the inter-relationship between the skills sets of both teaching and 
research it is interesting to note that Teacher-Respondents perceive communication 
to be more important for practitioners then researchers. This could be understood 
when considering the role of a teacher and, once again, their professional identity. At 
the heart of the teachers’ role is the idea of knowledge and learning; transference of 
knowledge and the persuasive nature of the relationship between teaching and 
learning, which may explain why they rate communication so highly when thinking 
about being an effective practitioner. Adding to this is the environment where that 
communication happens, and the complexities of it, whereby teachers are 

 
281 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
communicating with children, parents and colleagues who would each have varying 
degrees of communication skills themselves, therefore to be effective in such an 
environment teachers need to have highly sophisticated communication skills. 
Ranking communication as being less important for effective researchers suggests 
that Teacher-Respondents perceive researchers to be less dependent on the 
persuasive nature of communication, and that for these Teacher-Respondents, 
research is a presentation of the facts that are conclusive. Similarly researchers are 
not, from the Teacher-Respondents’ perspective, working with others who have a wide 
range of communication skills; a researcher is presenting research to likeminded 
researchers who already understand the language, nuances and communication 
strategies adopted within their environment.  
Whilst good subject knowledge is, according to the Teacher-Respondents, important 
for both teachers and researchers, other skills such as analysis and reflection are 
deemed to be more important for researchers, (see Figure 17). 
 

 
282 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
Figure 17 – Comparison of perceived skills/attributes needed for teachers and researchers 
 
This perception of the difference between skills needed to be an effective teacher and 
researcher may indicate that despite having general confidence in research Teacher-
Respondents do not see themselves as having the right skills and attributes to be 
effective researchers. This is despite plentiful previous experiences and opportunities 
to carry out research. This may in itself be an issue for teacher education programmes, 
and will be explored further in Chapter 7: Check Points: Resting En route. 
 
When looking at key vocabulary used to describe and outline either current or previous 
research projects terms such as ‘Impact’, ‘Evaluation’ and ‘Measuring’ were used most 
frequently. This is not surprising given the dominance of neoliberal ideas that, as 
argued by Ball (2016) and discussed in section 6.3.2 Well-travelled routes – Teacher 
Roles and Responsibilities... IMPACT, underpin current policy and practice in schools.

Teacher-Respondents commented that they were confident in carrying out research 
and strongly agreed that this was an important aspect of education, with all Teacher-
Respondents noting that both policy and practice, at local and national level, should 
be based on research. Furthermore Teacher-Respondents disagreed that research 
should only be carried out by academics, with just 2 participants agreeing with this 
statement. When asked if teachers should focus on children rather than research over 
80 percent of Teacher-Respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed.  
 
 
6.7.3 Trip Review – Summary. 
 
To summarise then it is evident that the Teacher-Respondents in this study have a 
very positive perspective of research within their professional lives. They clearly see 
themselves as competent and interested in research and strongly believe that this is 
as important part of their role and responsibility. This would appear to contradict 
Olivero, John and Sutherland (2004) who suggested that educational research and 
practice present as two different cultures and worlds. Similarly to the research 
carried out by Stenhouse (1981), the Teacher-Respondents can see themselves as 
researchers who have a range of skills and opportunities for carrying out research, 
namely the environment for naturalistic observations, access to research participants 
and the essential skills as teachers to be able to conduct research, having previously 
been taught how to do this as part of studying at university.

6.7.3.1 Finding the wood amongst the trees. 
 
Searching through these initial interpretations of the data and conclusions offered by 
adopting the CHQ approach brings about an emotive response that is now becoming 
more familiar to me. In the same way that I tune into the data, the glowing data that 
provokes and urges a response, I tune in to my own emotions, recognising that sense 
of incompleteness. However at this juncture I notice a shift in my emotional response, 
there is less frustration and more motivation. The motivation that comes from a 
troubling of the discourses that creates a desire, an urge to examine that ‘something’ 
which despite being partially hidden demands to be considered. I am reminded again 
of what Noah (age 8) said, way back during the first phase of this journey, when trying 
to express his emerging understanding of what is research, he told me that .  
‘…research is looking again at something you hadn’t really noticed in the first place’. I 
like Noah’s matter of fact definition, from the mouth of babes certainly, but I know that 
this urge to look again is triggered by the troubling of the discourses that demand I 
look more closely  because I don’t understand. Reflecting on my emotional experience 
as part of this research journey, the sense of satisfaction and dissatisfaction, of 
confidence and doubt, I am drawn to the emotional responses that the teachers 
demonstrate through their responses to the questionnaire. In exploring these I hope 
to see the wood amongst the trees.

6.7.4 Going off the beaten track……Fear of flying? 
 
I had asked the Teacher-Respondents if they would ‘like’ to carry out research in 
schools, those that agreed that they would went onto explain what, how and where, 
and who would be involved in their future research plans.  Now I wonder about the 
idea of ‘liking’ something, and in this case the ‘like’ meaning to have a preference or 
to enjoy; can I see here this enjoyment of, or preference to, research as an emotive 
term. For those that ‘wouldn’t like to’ I ask if I can sense a dislike of research, or maybe 
more accurately an impartiality to research. The suggestions of impartiality I can sense 
again, linked to the emerging hesitancy hidden in the Teacher-Respondents’ 
responses. My curiosity is provoked again when noticing that this group of teachers 
who previously have given full and confident answers as seen by the frequent use of 
‘strongly agree’ to given statements are now becoming less self-assured. At this point 
voices are quietened again, with indicators of uncertainty though the use of:  
 
  
 
‘??’,  
 
  
 
‘not sure’   
 
  
 
‘it depends’.  
 
  
 
‘Maybe??’ 
 
To listen to these non-responses is critical when trying to imagine the possibilities.  
The data here, (whilst easy to ignore), when noticed reveals an undercurrent of 
caution. Previous discussions have explored the encounter with risk; that the Teacher-

 
286 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Respondents are risk-adverse in relation to the demands of the curriculum and 
children’s progress towards targets, (6.3.7 Going off the beaten track…..Risky Play.), 
the participants, as gate-keepers, viewing research as risky to staff they have 
responsibility for (6.5.6 Going off the beaten track……Gatekeepers to Research 
PARTICIPANTS.) and risk in relation to my own professional identity as I establish/re-
establish myself as a researcher (6.5.7 WARNING…..professional identity at RISK.).  
This time though I think the caution illustrated by the use of punctuation, brevity of 
responses, and silence itself, is not because of risk that is directly related to 
professional or institutional reputation, but rather this is linked to personal risk; 
personal, emotive risk, based on self-doubt and a lack of confidence. The impartiality 
or ambiguity could indicate or, as I prefer to say, is demonstrative of, the emotional 
caution and reluctance to make a definite commitment. This lack of commitment to 
research is despite being confident teachers, and leaders and managers in schools; 
carrying out research, with or without children, may be something that the Teacher-
Respondents may fear they would not be successful at.  
 
[This understanding of successful research and what that looks like for the teachers in 
the survey will be considered later].   
 
For now though, disguised rather than hidden in the data, I am curious to see that the 
skills the Teacher-Respondents identify as being the most important to be successful 

 
287 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
researchers are not so highly valued when they consider what skills are needed to be 
successful teachers.   
I notice that the T-Rs who are Head Teachers, and the leaders of teachers, and as 
such are deemed to be competent teachers themselves, rate the ability to analyse as 
being most important for a researcher and rate this as one of the least important skills 
to be a teacher.  
 
Does this begin to demonstrate an underlying, disguised, belief that teachers do not 
have the skills to be researchers as they hold a different skills set, which has other 
skills that are more important, and therefore more practiced and developed, in their 
role as a teacher?  
 
Is this lack of self-belief in their skills responsible for deterring teachers from carrying 
out research? 
 
I notice too an increase use of generic terms when the Teacher-Respondents are 
asked to give further information as to what they would like to research and especially 
how – I see the use of terms such as: 
 
  
‘Standardized tests’,  
 
  
‘Controlled study’  
 
  
‘Quantitative and qualitative’.  

 
288 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The last response here is not clear about specific research methods or tools, and this 
was explicitly asked for in the question. Interpreting this response is complex, I notice 
the uncertainly in the response.  
 
This uncertainty is presented furthermore by other voices who have been quietened 
by the question itself – fewer responses to the ‘what’ and ‘how’ question then the 
‘would you like to’ question.  
 
I consider this carefully and suggest that this is because the voices are of teachers 
who whilst able to commit to the general suggestion of carrying out research have, at 
this stage, not firmed up their ideas, and the question in itself is the first time the 
fullness of carrying out research has been considered.  
 
Alternatively what is heard is a voice of doubt, beginning to imagine the risk and 
challenges of carrying out research in the school community. 
 
6.7.5 Going off the beaten track….. Emotions – Motivation and 
Inspiration. 
 
When asked what the benefits of carrying out research may be to children one 
Teacher-Respondent commented that: 

 
289 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
 ‘It might raise the aspiration of the children to work in science,  
 
 children would have to measure accurately though’. 
I am pulled up here straightaway. Firstly by the strength of association of research 
within a positivist paradigm which presents a new pathway for my thoughts that I 
acknowledge here. Secondly, and this is where I will pause and contemplate, by the 
stated benefits of participating in Children-as-Researcher projects in relation not only 
to motivation (a strong emotion), but as conveyed in the response, to aspirations - 
identified here as career paths.  
 
I previously discussed the idea of TIME as a barrier to research (section 6.5.2 Well-
travelled routes- Teachers Roles and Responsibilities…Children and Research TIME), 
here though I am drawn to TIME and research not as a barrier that prevents but as a 
bridge to future ambition and aspirations.  
 
The benefits of research voiced in this response is not in the here and now, just as 
study was not in the here and now when considering why teachers don’t undertake 
research. The projection of future outcomes feels far removed from the benefits to 
children (empowerment, having a voice, social skills) as expressed by the dominant 
voices and discussed previously (6.3.3 Well-travelled routes – Children as Competent 
(Age Related) Research Participants).  
 

 
290 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
I respond to this lone voice and wonder initially if the pushing away from the here and 
now is about a distancing of the immediateness of the questions, and maybe the 
probing nature of those questions about research, and Children-as-Researchers.  
At first I see this future-focus as a further marker that suggests the T-R’s isolation from 
social research as part of their everyday practice and concerns. Reflecting further 
though I begin to view this as more of an indication of the value placed on research as 
a profession in itself, the idea of a RESEARCHER – (of natural rather than social 
science).  
 
I expected responses here to continue to promote research that measures impact, 
given the current agenda and dominance of neoliberalism as discussed previously, 
(and here I notice not repetition but verification of inter/intra-action, another 
encounter).  
 
What I had not expected to see was a response that makes a direct link to a positivist 
approach by drawing on the specific example of science as a career. To make sense 
of this I reflect on the journey of my relationship with research, from school pupil to 
undergraduate, post graduate and doctoral student and see my shift from positivist to 
interpretivist to the posts, and accept that it is the conviction of the converted that led 
to such a strong personal emotional response. Despite acknowledging the dominant 
Cartesian influences on research and the positivist paradigm the emotional impact of 

 
291 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
seeing this in text challenges me as it reinforces that I see the world differently in a 
way that contradicts the norm; accepting this is unsettling.  
 
The rationale for wanting to be a teacher is often somewhat naïvely communicated as 
wanting to make a difference to the lives of children, of having long term impact, not 
just mattering on a day to day basis. For this Teacher-Respondent the impact is not 
just about day to day outcomes measured by external bodies but the longer term 
impact on children’s life chances, recognizing that education is not just about children 
as children but also about children as the adults they will become. The aspirations this 
Teacher-Respondent has for the children, resonates with me, indeed recognising this 
professional value softens the previously negative feelings about my profession I 
owned up to earlier (6.5.7). I recognise professional characteristics in this comment 
that mirror how I would describe my own professional identity as an educator, valuing 
education as the tool to create social justice. The idea of motivation and aspiration 
within the comment, in a cyclical way, aspires and motivates me.  
 
Beyond, yet provoked by, my personal response, (remembering of course that my 
ontological stance accepts the personal inter/intra action with the data and presents 
me as an integral part of the research, and the thesis itself), I continue to be inquisitive 
about this comment.  
 

 
292 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
I view this as another peek into the ontological position of Teacher-Respondents and 
their understanding, perhaps (mis) understanding, of social science and social 
research.  
 
Provoked by this comment I take another pathway to look for the overspill in order to 
unpick how Teacher-Respondents understand research, not just whether it is within 
their professional role and responsibility but bigger issues of ontology, epistemology 
and methodology.  
 
6.7.6 Going off the beaten track……..Emotions – Positively Positivist. 
 
Here then I wonder about omission and the ‘not said’. I noticed, and have reported 
earlier that the Teacher-Respondents identified a range of research tools they had 
adopted in their previous research, these included observations, interviews and 
questionnaires. When asked about the methodologies adopted for research carried 
for research undertaken after studying for their highest qualification, there is just one 
tentative reference to methodologies. ‘Qualitative and Quantitative Methods’.  
 
This omission of a consideration of research methodologies rings a bell as I recall the 
challenges of teaching undergraduates to consider more than the tool they will use to 
gather data. To be clear I am not at this point suggesting that intellectually this group 
of professionals, all with degrees and most with post graduate qualifications, does not 

 
293 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
understand the complexities of methodologies but that rather as their work remains in 
the practical world, and not the theoretical world, they are preferring to focus on 
practical examples rather than the underpinning philosophical positions that have 
influenced their research decisions. This may be because methodology is not 
something teachers are encouraged to think or act upon, and as such it is largely 
absent from their practice and the evaluation of that practice. One voice tells me: 
 
 ‘Sorry, can’t remember, it was SUCH a long time ago’ 
At this comment I pause… 
…..the not remembering troubles me, I see the importance placed on research by the 
Teacher-Respondents, the assertive, strongly agree responses to questions that ask 
if teachers should be doing research, and if education policy and practice should be 
based on research.  
I see the adamant agreement that research is important. But I also see the absence 
of consideration of methodologies and the dominance of a Cartesian view of 
knowledge. 
 
Revisiting the responses I perceive a gentle, almost missed, shifting and swaying in 
terms of Teacher-Respondents understandings of research. The responses made to 
questions about research carried out whilst studying, for the most remain clear, with 
some acknowledgment of methodologies.  
 

 
294 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
In one case a specific title is given: ‘Understanding the political and educational 
influences which impact upon learning the Early Years’.  
This position of confidence and clarity becomes more opaque, with less assertive use 
of theoretical vocabulary as Teacher-Respondents go on to outline research carried 
out since they last studied:  
 
  
‘something about….’,  
 
  
‘related to impact,  
 
  
‘an evaluation study’.  
 
And then another movement further down on the scale of clarity and specifics when 
asked to think about potential future research  
 
  
‘not sure really’,  
 
  
‘maybe something to do with…..’,  
 
  
‘???’.  
Further noticing sees the movement away from an interpretivist paradigm (evident in 
research carried out whilst studying in Higher Education) towards a positivist paradigm 
(evident in research carried out currently or proposed). This becomes most evident 
not just when considering future research but also when considering Children-as- 
Researchers projects.  
 

 
295 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
When Teacher-Respondents offer their evaluation of the benefits of, and the barriers 
to, children carrying out their own research projects. There is talk of children: 
 
 ‘being more than able to test an hypothesis’ 
 
 ‘[having] the skill set to mean they could measure, make graphs,  
 
 ask and answer questions’. 
 
 ‘needing to be precise and organized in measurements’ 
 
 ‘limited mathematical and literacy skills would be a barrier’ 
 
This also suggests that the Teacher-Respondents hold this broadly positivist position 
of research as their preferred paradigm, or even their most familiar paradigm.  
Asking myself why I accept that the current dominance in UK schools of attainment, 
measuring progress, and data in response to that, may well explain why this is the 
case, and I start to wonder again about the implications then for initial teacher 
education. This provocation keeps returning and the temptation to follow this line of 
flight is becoming stronger.  
 
Taking a step back then, the shift from university supervised research, to school-based 
research carried out some time ago, to proposed future research projects with 
children, shows a move away from a naturalist research paradigm to a positivist 
paradigm. (Is there no place for Posts..I wonder???) 
 

 
296 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
I see more widely in current education policy and practice the impact of IMPACT and 
accountability so this is not be a surprising position to notice. Elizabeth St Pierre (2012) 
suggests that positivist Scientifically Based Research (SBR) has infiltrated the study 
of education despite that what is being researched is a complex social problem with 
no certainties –a tension between competing ontologies then?  
 
What provokes me here though is the research journey of these Teacher-Respondents 
that start their research narrative by being embedded within the Conventional 
Humanist Qualitative tradition, whilst under the influence of the Higher Education 
Institution, and that there is an apparent shift away from this as their careers and 
professional identity develops.  
 
 I wonder here if the differing positions held by the teachers and Head Teachers I 
aimed to involve in my research in Phase 1 is the reason why so often I felt at cross 
purposes to them? 
 
Not only was I /am I an emerging post-qualitative researcher, one who is questioning 
the Conventional Humanist Qualitative approach, which could be said to be not just 
one, but many steps away from the dominant positivist approach held by the head 
teachers. The distance then becoming more apparent throughout the journey of my 
research.  

 
297 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
6.8 Twists and turns, a cultural whirlpool. 
 
Here, I see an interesting confluence at play. The twists and intertwining nature of the 
social idea of Children-as-Researchers. Teachers are under scrutiny and are required 
to measure impact, this creates a culture of nervousness and tension. Within such a 
culture Teacher-Respondents become risk adverse. Research is seen as risky as it 
may well expose the ‘underneath’ of their practice which is not easily measured by 
adopting a positivist approach. Therefore the T-Rs remain within the perceived 
certainty of a positivist paradigm in an attempt to respond to the demands of 
accountability and impact data.  
Being risk adverse limits the creative nature of teaching and in doing so children are 
seen as objects of research rather than creators of knowledge through research.  
A culture of accountability that focuses so much on the effectiveness of teachers, 
whilst attempting to be an approach that supports the rights of children to have quality 
education, takes away other rights to have a voice and to have an opinion heard.  
At the centre then of our schools is the effectiveness and role of the adult, the teacher 
in relation to the child. Schools are teacher-centred rather than being child-centred as 
is often argued.  
 
These ponderings begin to form some sort of conclusion that says to understand 
Children-as-Researcher initiatives there is a need to explore what else drives and 
forms teachers, and to also think about how to support teachers in school in promoting 
and adopting Children-as-Researcher initiatives.

 Check Points, Resting En route. 
 
In which any thought of a final definitive conclusion is dismissed, and it becomes apparent that having 
explored Children-as-Researchers the multiple threads unpicked and the re-woven in this travelogue 
can offer alternative possibilities of Children-as-Researcher projects.

RJLowe  
 
 
 
7.1 Final Destinations? 
 
This chapter of the thesis, following on from the analysis and exploration of the survey, 
offers a rest point for my thinking and gives the opportunity to draw together the various 
threads that have become apparent when exploring the terrain of Children-as-
Researchers.  However, having rejected a CHQ approach as being incompatible with 
both my view of the world and with how I have interpreted and understood the 
interactions and entanglements revealed within this travelogue, the discussion here 
does not as such offer a conventional definitive conclusion.  Rather, it needs to be 
understood more as a dénouement which draws together the stands of the research, 
and in response to the worrisome pinch points offered in Chapter 6: Well-trodden trails 
and off the beaten track, sets about to resolve the challenges of Children-as-
Researcher projects as uncovered through this research.  
 
The key outcome of this thesis is the revelation of the underlying complexities of 
Children-as-Researcher initiatives which demand further examination. This further 
examination is not just about the strategies adopted and the programmes of Children-
as-Researchers projects but the knotted notions of children and childhood, the place 
of research in the classroom, and the place of research in relation to teachers’ 
identities. In exploring how to actively involve children as co-researchers in 
investigating their educational lives, multiple threads have been unravelled throughout 
the thesis. Now in this chapter these threads are re-woven and as illustrated in Image 
12, to show how each threads interconnects others and, when re-woven together, form 

 
300 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
a stronger understanding of the complexities and inter-relatedness of Children-as-
Researchers. Keeping the ends frayed is important as this illustrates that despite 
forming a stronger understanding there is still more to be unpicked later. 
 
 
Image 12 - Woven Threads 
 
7.2 A Resting Place. 
 
In a conventional thesis the idea of introducing new literature to be considered as 
discussions are drawing to an end would be frowned upon, however throughout the 
thesis I have adopted a blurred methodology and rejected convention. Whilst in 

 
301 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
dialogue with St Pierre (2019), who encourages post-qualitative researchers not to be 
constrained by the conventions of traditional empirical research, clarifying that in a 
post qualitative research there is nothing that has to be done and that each inquiry is 
‘different every time’ (St Pierre 2019: 12) I will, where necessary, refer to literature that 
has not been considered previously. 
This is not to follow new ‘lines of flight’ but to simply raise awareness of them. In the 
first part of this chapter I demonstrate that what, at first glance, appears to be a well-
practiced and straight-forward child-centred research methodology demands further 
examination and consideration in order to respond more effectively to what has 
become a largely unchallenged and over simplified process for children’s participation 
in research. The drawing together of threads at this point is completed by considering 
a re-positioning of teachers’ identities, roles and responsibilities in relation to research 
before moving on to re-view Children as Research projects. The possibilities and 
utilities are offered in the second part of the chapter in an attempt to overcome the 
challenges of promoting Children-as–Researchers seen now in the light of the 
complex entanglements revealed by my research.  
 
 
7.3 Re-placing (re-positioning) research as an integral part of 
teacher identity. 
 
As discussed previously (6.3.7 Going off the beaten track…..Risky Play. and 6.5.7 
WARNING…..professional identity at RISK.), the issue of RISK has been argued to 

 
302 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
be key in understanding Teacher-Respondents’ reluctance to undertake Children-as-
Researcher projects. Similarly to French et al (2017), Bradbury-Jones & Taylor (2013), 
and Bucknall (2012), Teacher-Respondents in my study commented on the perceived 
benefits of Children-as-Researcher projects but in practice were not actively engaging 
with research nor with the concept of Children-as-Researcher projects. At this point in 
time, now/then, I am curious as to how teachers could be supported and encouraged 
to more actively promote research in schools, and indeed Children-as-Researcher 
projects. I can see how effective relationships between academics and teachers, and 
HEIs and schools would be one way of promoting research in schools and Children-
as-Researcher initiatives. 
 
7.2.1 Emotional Risk? 
 
A thought here then, a caveat to rein in my emotive responses, whilst I find this 
challenging I have to recognise that my personal and philosophical commitment to 
Children-as-Researchers, and research in schools, sits within an academic 
environment of Higher Education, and whilst not an ivory tower I am separated from 
the environment of targets and accountability and the day to day working environment 
of schools. I need to offer a pragmatic, not an emotional, response to the T-Rs lack of 
engagement with the research process, I have to stand back and be solution focused. 
I hasten to add though that the possibilities of this are many, there is not one solution 
to be offered in a linear way – once again I take a rhizomatic approach to consider 
multiple solutions and potential paths to follow.  

 
303 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
As a starting point I recognise that confidence in carrying out research of any kind has 
to be established. I see my own research journey narrated and recorded within this 
thesis and recognise the distance I have travelled. From tentative attempts to design 
and construct a piece of research I have reached the point whereby my confidence 
allows me, or rather nudges me, to challenge conventional thought and offer 
alternative ways of doing things. As I unpick how this has happened to me and the 
benefits to my own learning I recognise that in myself I seem to be thriving on risk, 
whilst not being reckless I benefit from the security of supportive networks. 
If I am to be solution focussed and offer as one possibility the idea of developing and/or 
strengthening ‘partnership’,  between schools and HEIs in order to re-place research 
I have to firstly understand how current working relationships between schools and 
HEIs have come about, and how these relationships have impacted on the place of 
research in schools. I take a further risk here in writing up my thesis by taking one step 
backwards to review literature and policy so I can then move forward again. 
 
7.3 Re-placing research through partnership with HEIs. 
 
Interestingly the recent BERA/RSA Report on Research and the Teaching Profession 
(2014:5) states from the outset that schools and the wider research community should 
not be working in ‘separate and sometimes competing universes’, and promotes the 
idea of partnership. The place of partnerships between, and within the research 

 
304 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
community and schools, as potentially research rich environments, I would argue is 
key to teachers reclaiming research as an integral part of their identity. 
 
BERA/RSA (2014) identifies that professional networks, such as those that enhance 
subject knowledge, is one way of establishing such partnerships, offering the idea of 
inter-institutional thematic research studies. A collegiate approach to thematic 
research studies would mirror the shared interest of researchers within the wider 
community and those teachers in schools developing subject knowledge. The use of 
digital technologies and social media is acknowledged by BERA/RSA (2014: 25) as 
pivotal, and could be adopted to promote not just interest in subject specific fields, but 
to also explore innovative ways of data gathering, collaboration and methodologies. 
The idea of partnerships is also seen through the development of Continuing 
Professional Development (CPD) opportunities; this recognises that for many teachers 
whilst research was a part of their initial training, it is less a part of their everyday 
working lives once immersed in the culture and everyday concerns of school life. 
 
There is a link here between an active CPD agenda and the idea of networking to 
promote what Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) propose in relation to their concept of 
Professional Capital. They argue that for schools to improve and for the schooling 
system to develop there is a need to promote effectiveness through the idea of building 
capital, not using a business model that promotes cutting costs to be more profitable 
but in a professional capacity that promotes investing in teachers to be more effective, 

 
305 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
this includes investing in leadership and career development. The idea of professional 
capital is a combination of human capital, social capital and decisional capital, which 
draws together the talent of teachers (human capital) with the strength of a working 
group (social capital) and the ability to make judgments (decisional capital). 
Hargreaves and Fullan (2012) claim that promoting professional capital is the way 
forward for schools to be more effective and better meet the needs of their students. 
Drawing on research by Leana (2011) they argue that schools are most effective when 
there is strong social capital and that this is more important than human capital; when 
the idea of decisional capital is added schools become even more effective.  
Studies by Roland, Johnson, Jones and Boyer (2016), and Lee and Lee (2018), 
suggest that developing professional learning communities or communities of practice 
is a key way to promote professional capital and support the improvement and 
effectiveness of schools. Such communities of practice would, I suggest be able to 
promote professional capital as well as re-placing research into teacher identity. 
 
For any effective partnership to flourish the concept of shared goals or vision is key. 
For effective partnerships between HEIs and Schools to flourish the shared vision may 
not initially be research focussed but rather the underpinning values and beliefs of 
both partners. In my study the Teacher-Respondents were clear that they understood 
their role to matter, they wanted to make a difference and to provide a positive learning 
experience for the young children in their schools; essentially they want to make a 
difference, and have impact. They use the frameworks of various matrices to assess 
and quantify that impact, however the philosophy of wanting to make a difference and 

 
306 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
being committed to social justice and a determination to do ‘good’ is not 
underestimated and reduced by measuring impact, and remained at the centre of how 
Teacher-Respondents understood their purpose. 
 
Similarly this notion of matrices to assess quality is now evident within the field of 
Higher Education (Olssen 2016).  Peeling away the issues with regards to this, not 
least that these are often seen as the only measures of quality, the underpinning 
values that influence me as an educator, and indeed my colleagues, is not a desire to 
remain within that proverbial ivory tower but is firmly fixed within the desire to do good, 
to raise aspirations and to impact positively on the local community. My home 
institution recognises itself as the University for the Local Community rather than the 
university of, or within, the local community (Birmingham City University 2015). With 
this value at the heart of curriculum developments and teaching and learning 
experiences, it is clear that this commitment to social justice and social reform is where 
the paths of both educational institutions meet. Sometimes the value-driven and 
principled approach is stronger than interest in particular field of study. As a political 
force the idea of communities of both experts and learners is how, and where, both 
schools and HEIs can converge and work together. 
 
Developing partnership networks to plan and deliver a range of CPD, to celebrate the 
research endeavours of teachers in schools and to harvest the research rich 
environment through which to build confidence and recognise existing capabilities, 

 
307 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
could be one way of re-placing research to be at the heart of teacher identity, and as 
BERA/RSA (2014) identifies would result in an active self-improving education system. 
Additionally the idea of networks could contribute to the promotion of Hargreaves and 
Fullan’s (2012) notion of professional capital. What this may actually look like in 
practice will be discussed shortly when I move on to consider alternative ways to 
promote Children-as-Researcher initiatives.  
I would argue that in order for teachers to reclaim their identity, as researchers, there 
needs to be a culture of confidence, a culture of wanting to be part of the self-improving 
education system that BERA/RSA promoted in 2014. In addition there needs to be a 
culture of trust which Cole and Gannon (2017) argue has been stripped away, 
suggesting that teachers’ roles have become: 
merged with the over-riding concerns of financial capitalism, which 
primarily works from the perspective of the profit motive, and that reduces 
all activity under its aegis to calculable values representable as numerical, 
parallel to the  multitude of companies on the stock exchange (p78-79). 
 
The fact that there seems to be little movement towards a vision of a self-improving 
education system I would argue is related to the absence of effective HEI/School 
partnerships as proffered above, and indeed the dominance of neoliberalism which I 
will return to later. However one way of supporting teachers to embrace research 
would be by seizing the accountability factor of neoliberalism and using this as a driver 
for practice led-research and evaluative studies.

7.3.1 From without to within. 
 
I realise, and offer as a further outcome of my thesis, the recognition of the 
responsibilities of HEIs, and individuals within the field of education in HEIs to promote 
research as an integral part of developing partnerships between schools and HEIs. I 
need to position myself as a role model, and my institution needs to recognise, and 
celebrate, the research that is happening in a variety of ways, and importantly at 
various levels, whereby not everything deemed research related is a project that has 
gone through a tradition research design and produced outcomes. For example 
teachers may well be involved in developing literature reviews as part of individual MA 
study or as part of established communities of learning, whereby they are becoming 
familiar and are focusing on developing their knowledge of current issues; this is most 
likely to be related to subject interest or phase interest. This may then be built on and 
lead to peer-to-peer observation, designed specifically to share and evaluate practice. 
As BERA/RSA explores when demonstrating how such a framework of research 
development may appear, there is a gradual shift from being aware of and considering 
existing research, to how this may impact on practice, to then establishing small class 
or school based enquiries, to local or regional investigations, the model being from 
micro to macro. Naively my own evaluation of teacher involvement in research did not 
initially recognise that in the same way as I have undertaken such a journey, as related 
in this thesis, teachers too would undertake a journey. Building on the idea of 
partnerships, within and beyond the school community to include HEIs, my colleagues 
and I have the opportunity to initiate such journeys.

If there is a desire to reclaim teacher-researcher identity then these ways forward may 
go some way to achieving that, slowly, not without challenges, a professional 
revolution takes place. Starting with accepting the firmly fixed notion of accountability 
and using this to open minds and gain confidence, and then make changes within, 
rather than merely criticising from the outside. 
 
7.4 Re-placing research through– Initial Teacher Training 
EDUCATION. 
 
Having previously explored Professional Identities (3.9 pg. 98 ff) I return here to 
consider how the professional identity of pre-service teachers is formed. Bukor 
(2015) argues that student teachers’ professional identity is formed even before they 
commence their initial programmes of study. Anecdotally many of the applicants for 
Teacher Education programmes that I interview talk of a role model they had as a 
pupil and how that person has inspired them to be a teacher. This is supported by 
recent research carried out by Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) (2015) 
which found that 38% of those entering the teacher education programmes did so as 
they were inspired by one of their own teachers. I would argue therefore that the 
professional identities of pre-service teachers are formed based on their own 
experiences of being a pupil and that if the inspiring role models that they hold on 
high do not demonstrate being an active member of a learning community, then this 
identity is replicated. If pupils see their teachers conducting research, and see within 
their school environment that there is commitment to adult learning and education for 
all, not just children, then those drawn to the profession are likely to replicate such 

 
310 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
research-informed professional identities. Bukor (2015) suggests that teacher 
identity is influenced by, and constructed through, personal and emotional 
experiences, concluding that the personal experience of schooling contributes 
significantly to the professional identity that is created as pre-service teachers 
become teachers. In simple terms this demonstrates the concept of social learning 
theory, (Bandura 1977), and the significance of role models and their impact on 
behaviour learnt; consciously or unconsciously. Further consideration of how pre-
service teachers generate their professional identity has been explored by Taylor 
(2017) and Beltman et al (2015), both of whom show the impact of the cyclical nature 
of identity formation. Beltman et al (2015) also offer an insight into what pre-service 
teachers perceive their role to be, demonstrating a teacher identity based on helping, 
care and nurturing, rather than the complexities of that teacher role. 
 
I take the position then that if teachers are to reclaim their identity to include 
research, then this cycle of identity formation needs to be interrupted and 
reconfigured. The pedagogy-informed EDUCATION (not training) of pre-service 
teachers would be an opportunity for this to happen. 
 
This thesis adds to the debate around the place of research within any pre-service 
programme, and argues this is key to teachers reclaiming their identity which would 
include the place of research as part of their everyday teaching lives rather than a 
perceived add-on to their professional roles and responsibilities. If pre-service 

 
311 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
programmes are without an emphasis on research, learning communities and the 
need for a pedagogy-informed self-improving approach to teaching and learning, 
then the pattern of seeing research as separate from the roles and responsibilities of 
a classroom teacher is replicated. 
 
In the same way that a ‘communities of learning’ approach could lead to increased 
confidence and opportunities for research, such a collegiate approach to learning for 
pre-service teachers would reap the same rewards.  French et al (2017) report that 
teachers in their study benefitted professionally from working with research 
professionals, this has also been reported elsewhere for example Newman and 
Mowbray (2012), and Willemse et al (2016). This thesis, having identified the 
significance of positive relationships, and a nurturing environment, through which to 
conduct research adds weight to the argument that a ‘communities of practice’ 
approach would support the re-placing of research as an integral part of teacher 
identity. 
 
Searching to understand why this may not already be the case I review the 
programme of study for pre-service teachers within my home institution. The 
programme of study is built around meeting the Teaching Standards (DfE 2014), and 
rigorous assessments provide pre-service teachers opportunities to demonstrate 
these standards. Whilst research features in one core module whereby the students 
are expected to complete a small scale piece of research this is done so individually. 

 
312 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Whilst the emphasis is on practice based learning, the individual approach of the 
module’s indicative content and assessment tasks does not promote the concept of 
‘communities of learning’. I would argue that contemporary culture of individuality, 
linked to individual responsibility that dominates educational experiences both for 
children, and adults within the teaching profession, is indicative of the dominance of 
neoliberalism.  Group responsibility and collective learning approaches do not 
synchronise with such a position. As such then the training programmes for pre-
service teachers reflect this. This thesis argues for the need to re-claim research, 
practice-led, enquiry based research, as an integral part of communities of practice 
rather than an individualised approach to support pre-service and in-service teachers 
in reclaiming research as part of their identity. 
 
I wonder at this point how as a HE institution that has responsibility for the 
development of pre-service teachers, and indeed post-qualified teachers, if there is 
more that can be done to not only promote communities of learning but to take 
responsibility for initiating communities of learning. A two pronged attack to establish 
communities of learning which included pre-service and in-service teachers would go 
some way to overcome this. Once again the idea of the HEI being the role model here 
becomes clearer to me. 
 
I scrutinise the Teacher Standards further and notice that hidden away is the 
expectation that teachers should ‘promote a love of learning’ and ‘promote the value 

 
313 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
of scholarship’, (DfE 2014:11). Promoting research, and enquiry led initial teacher 
education, and reclaiming it as an integral part of the teacher role and responsibilities 
would enable teachers at all stages of their career to meet these standards.  
 
The idea of research in schools being focussed on practice based inquiry is not new, 
others have explored and examined this concept identifying the benefits of improved 
practice, and subsequently improved outcomes, for both children and teachers (Brown 
et al 2014, Willemse et al 2016, Newman and Mowbray 2012). Institutions that have 
responsibility for pre-service teachers I argue would be wise to consider not just 
‘communities of practice’ but an integration of practice based research to its 
curriculum. Recognising of course that the changes to initial teacher training in the last 
decade places responsibility of that training, education, not just with HEIs but also with 
schools, the idea of communities of learning could, and I would argue in this problem 
solution mode, should, be developed for pre-service teachers AND their counterparts 
already working in schools. These ‘communities of practice’, led by HEIs, focussing 
on shared subject interests, or pedagogical approaches, with in-service teachers 
working alongside HE academics as part of module delivery, involving pre-service 
teachers as part of their self –evaluation of practice, could facilitate the re-claiming of 
teacher identity and the re-positioning of research within that identity to be established. 
 
 

 
314 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
7.4.1 One step at a time….. 
 
Warned by my previously tendency towards naivety I offer a caveat here. By establish 
of course I mean locally, very locally, within a partnership between one HEI and some 
of its partner schools, that may well conduct research to benefit and improve outcomes 
at their school, then share that knowledge within a local network, which may then 
impact more widely…and so it begins. A small revolution, starting with like-minded 
professionals who have the thinking space to take risks, who have the confidence to 
be able to share and encourage those around them.  
 
This ‘would-be’ journey to reclaim teacher identity to include research is not a linear 
one but a messy one that is representative of the entanglement and evident complexity 
of the relationship between teachers and research, research and schools, and 
research within and beyond HEIs. Replacing research as an integral part of teacher 
identities could/would lay stronger foundations on which to build more effective 
Children-as-Research initiatives. I see the journey ahead as a developing one, that 
acknowledges different paces of progress, different be-comings, that are, at this stage 
unpredictable but nevertheless there, whilst not currently in full view.  
 
7.5 Replacing (re-positioning) perceptions of childhood in 
relation to teacher roles and responsibilities.  
 
At this rest point, whilst contemplating the need to reclaim teacher identity, I respond 
to my analysis that says to me, if we need to re-place (re-position) teacher identity in  

 
315 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
order to promote Children-as-Researcher initiatives, do we need to also re-place (re-
position) how we perceive children and the teacher’s relationship with them? 
In previous research I arrived, with colleagues, at the position whereby there is a need 
to rethink: 
the traditionally hierarchical relationship between teachers and their pupils 
which tend towards a teacher dominated view of the school environment 
and pupil identities and experiences within it (French et al 2017: 12). 
 
This hierarchical relationship bothers me. In my research with children, and in the initial 
stages of this doctoral study, by children, I aspired to carefully consider the role and 
responsibilities of/to children within the research process. I was committed, from the 
beginning, to be aware of hierarchies and the power differentials at play when involving 
children in research projects, both as participants and as researchers in their own right. 
With my professional roots in early childhood I see myself as being part of the voice 
that Moss (2017:12) describes as ‘vibrant and vocal’, not silenced by the dominance 
of a ‘strongly positivist and regulatory discourse’, but ‘readily heard by those who 
listen’. A voice that says, through words, beliefs and actions that young children have 
rights and should be heard and valued as themselves, not just for who they may one 
day become, and that young children have competent ways of viewing the world, 
acknowledging that these may be different to adult views. Essentially that children are 
social actors in their own right (Prout 2002). This position informs my thinking, my 
research interests, this research design, methodology and tools adopted. Becoming 
more secure in the post-structuralist world, I see that indeed there are many truths and 
it is this growing awareness of the many that provokes me to sit up and reconsider 

 
316 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
perceptions of childhood within school communities, and in doing so argue that there 
is a need to re-place (re-position) how children are perceived; initially as members of 
the school community in relation to teachers and then as research participants through 
the lens of ethics.  
 
7.4.2 Remembering the to-ing and fro-ing 
 
Remembering the nature of my research, the inevitable to-ing and fro-ing as I explore 
the terrain of Children-as-Researchers before thinking about re-placing childhood, re-
positioning childhood I need to reflect on where childhood is placed currently within 
society and a school context. One step backwards…two steps forward. 
 
7.4.3 Placing contemporary versions of childhood. 
 
As discussed in Chapter 3: Dealing with Wanderlust, (pg. 72 ff.), childhood is socially 
constructed and it is the adults who have ordered society and established the 
generational groups of people within it (Leonard 2016). The idea of childhood being 
socially constructed, attributed to James et al (1998), brings forth the recognition that 
as childhood is fluid there are many versions of childhood, which are presented as 
discourses. Within Western culture the dominant discourse of childhood is said to be 
a romantic version of childhood, whereby children are innocent, to be nurtured and 
protected (Lowe 2012). This can also, for example, be seen throughout the child 
centric approaches to the prevailing practices, provision and policies within both 

 
317 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
families and communities as well as wider social groups (Lowe 2012). The extensive 
use of children in advertising linked to domestic and cleaning products from Pears in 
the 19th Century to Persil in the 21st Century continue to reinforce the link between 
childhood and innocence (Lowe 2012, Burman 2011). Whilst the notion of a romantic 
discourse can be seen to be the dominant discourse in Western society, within the 
field of education there is a tension evident between this and the competing discourses 
of childhood. As previously discussed in Chapter 4: ‘Well-trodden trails and off the 
beaten track’, ‘impact’ and ‘risk’ were identified as key drivers of the decision making 
processes Teacher-Respondents undertook when considering whether or not to 
undertake Children-as-Research projects.  As such these can be said to be indicators 
of the dominance of neoliberal ideas that underpin school policy (Ball 2016).  
 
The thesis argues that not only is the school environment dominated by a neoliberal 
agenda, and that in itself impacts on teachers being risk adverse, but as part of this 
teachers are encouraged both by internal pressures, (e.g. leaders and managers), and 
external pressures, (e.g. OFSTED), to maintain a neoliberal discourse of childhood 
that views children as a commodity; in relation to numbers, data, and future 
employability and investment.  Sims (2017) suggests that a curriculum that develops 
and supports individualised, critical thinkers is dangerous to maintain the dominant 
neoliberal view of the world which successive governments in the West adopt, 
illustrative of Foucault’s notion of governmentality (2004). Accepting that education is 
indeed a ‘driven political practice’ (Moss et al 2016), it is not surprising then that within 
school communities the dominant version of childhood is a neo-liberal one.   

 
318 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
Therefore one of the barriers to promoting Children-as-Researcher initiatives  is the 
tension that lies in the conflicting discourses of childhood that teachers hold, the 
uncomfortableness that they feel, at an emotional level, as they grapple between a 
romantic discourse of childhood that emphasises the child’s individuality, social 
qualities, and places the child’s needs at the heart of social wellbeing, and a neoliberal 
discourse that views the child as a commodity for future employment and is associated 
with economic growth. Within a neoliberal classroom, where teachers adopt a 
neoliberal perspective of childhood, there is little room for Children-as-Researcher 
initiatives. This version of childhood can be seen to be influenced by externalised 
views of both education and childhood. The idea of children’s voice and children’s 
rights within such a view of education and childhood sees the child as subversive and 
challenging to the hegemonic nature of neoliberalism. 
This thesis adds to the debate around Children-as-Researcher projects a need to re-
place (re-position) childhood and challenge the neoliberal perspective that appears to 
be gaining momentum, with or without awareness of the adults who, we are reminded 
by  Leonard (2016), order society.  In continuing with a solution focussed approach, 
bearing in mind the multiplicities of those solutions, I offer next potential routes to follow 
in order to challenge not just neoliberalism in education, but the neoliberal perspective 
of childhood and in doing so create an educational environment more conducive to 
promoting Children-as-Researcher initiatives. 
 

 
319 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
7.5 Re-placing (repositioning) childhood – challenging 
neoliberalism. 
 
Sims (2017) demands, not anarchy, but ‘active resistance’ on behalf of children to 
challenge the onslaught on neoliberalism, arguing that children deserve to be in a 
world where democracy flourishes and every child has the right to participate. This 
view of the world, reminiscent of a romantic perspective of childhood, which Sims 
(2017) along with others e.g. Brown (2015), Burman (2011), Perez and Cannella 
(2011), and notably Giroux (2013, 2015) advocate, is at risk due to the dominance of 
neoliberalism. Whereas some would suggest that this is just how the world is 
changing, and adopt a compliant attitude, those who struggle with a neoliberal 
ideology, in particular in education where neoliberalism has resulted in knowledge and 
learning becoming a commodity, and by default children as also a commodity, are 
promoting resistance and advocating teachers and educators to be agents of change. 
Furthermore I would argue that this thesis is a part of that same struggle, and as it 
draws to an end, it aims to provoke the notion of teachers and educators ‘becoming’ 
agents of change. 
 
My travelogue generates a surge of resistance to promote active change to an 
ideology that positions children as units to be measured, and as future investments, 
rather than individuals who are unique, all of whom have a valuable part to play in a 
society to which they can contribute, and which is grounded in social justice and 
democracy.  Sims (2017: 6) calls for educational professionals (teachers and Early 
Years Practitioners) to take responsibility for change, suggesting that both 

 
320 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
‘courageous leaders’ and ‘courageous fellowship’ is what is called for. She suggests 
that this lack of courage comes from an over tendency to look inwards rather than 
outwards and that this leads to merely a continuous reflection on quality that is 
predetermined by external factors. Consequently Early Years Practitioners and 
teachers, whether leaders of settings or not, reinforce the regulated and expected 
practices.  As it is Early Years Practitioners and teachers who have the knowledge 
and intellectual capacity to think outwardly there should be a drive to continuously 
question and rethink existing normative practices, and then offer new ideas and ways 
of doing things, not simply replicating practice without thought and reflection. Giroux 
(2013) goes further, suggesting that there is a need to rethink what schools are for, to 
not only promote discussion about pedagogy, and critical reflection on pedagogy, but 
to also re-establish the teaching profession as ‘pubic intellectuals’ (Giroux 2013:5). 
The position taken by both Giroux (2013) and Sims (2017) suggests that rather than 
a professionalisation of the sector there is indeed a de-professionalisation, and an 
over dependency on the technical aspects of delivering curriculum, the ‘how to do it’ 
rather than the ‘why we are doing it’. By adopting a technical approach, children and 
their learning are seen as units of outcome, having been serviced by technicians to 
improve performance. Promoting discussions, explorations and a deeper 
understanding of pedagogy is, I would argue one way for teachers to achieve this role 
as public intellectuals, who would be answerable to the public, not just in terms of 
being accountable for outcomes but for providing answers as to why, and how, 
pedagogical decisions came about. Sims (2017) advocates that currently there is lack 
of professional confidence, not in understanding how and why children learn and 
develop, but rather in discretionary decision making and that this is why, in her 

 
321 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
research, Early Years practitioners are compliant. This thesis adds to this position by 
arguing that in order to develop more ‘courageous leaders’ and more ‘courageous 
fellowship’, when considering the development of ITE programmes, and Early 
Childhood Studies degree programmes there should be time and space in the design 
to explore, examine, understand and practice discretionary  decision making. This idea 
also would advocate Hargreaves and Fullan’s notion of professional capital (2012) as 
discussed previously (pg 303 ff.). In this scenario the role of the HEI would be to 
nurture and support a re-professionalisation of the teaching and Early Years 
practitioner workforce by focussing on these tacit skills alongside knowledge and 
understanding of pedagogy within degree programmes. 
 
 
7.5.1 Overlapping constructions of children and teachers- Inter-
relatedness. 
 
At this point then I am noticing the overlap and the inter-sections between 
recommended ways to go about re-placing childhood, and previously noted 
recommendations for re-placing research as part of teacher identity. The emphasis 
placed on the professionalisation of teachers and educators rather than the technical 
elements of these important roles, the need to provide time and space for intellectual 
reflection and consideration and indeed the emotive aspect of confidence in relation 
to fulfilling these tasks would, I believe, each contribute to that re-placing of childhood 
in order for Children-as-Research initiatives to be more widely undertaken by teachers 
and Early Years Practitioners. I am recognising a re-visiting and re-emphasising of the 

 
322 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
importance of confidence, a nurturing environment and the role that communities of 
practice could play, not just in re-placing research as an integral part of teacher identity 
but also as a route to travel that may well challenge the neoliberal child discourse and 
consequently re-place children at the centre of the schooling system. All of these I 
would argue would contribute to the promotion of Children-as-Researcher initiatives. 
 
7.6 Re-placing (re-positioning) children in research – 
challenging ethics. 
 
 
Continuing to offer outcomes of this thesis, in this section the need to re-place, re-
position children in research, I move on now to problematise ethical approaches to 
Children-as-Research initiatives.  
The purpose of an ethical approach to any research is not in any sense controversial, 
it is a given. The role of the ethics committee is to evaluate and approve research 
proposals ensuring that; the fundamental principle of ‘do no harm’ is adhered to, 
researchers protect participants’ autonomy and act with integrity, and that there are 
benefits to the research. Parsons et al (2015) however outline concerns about the role 
of university ethics committees and their function, noting that their over bureaucratic 
approach which is often inflexible, has led to them becoming too powerful. Whilst the 
role of the ethics committee is to protect vulnerable participants the formal approach 
for seeking consent that is required by university ethics committees does more to 
silence the voice of children and young people.  Most universities in Parson et al’s 

 
323 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
(2015) research automatically raised any research proposal that included children or 
young people to a higher level of scrutiny, deeming all children and young people as 
vulnerable, they argue that for most ethics committees research with children and 
young people is deemed to be too risky. Subsequently any researcher who involves 
children and young people in research would undergo greater scrutiny. According to 
Parsons et al (2015) this additional scrutiny suggests a lack of trust in the researchers. 
However, they note an irony here as no universities in their study offered guidance as 
to how to engage ethically with children and young people in research, and ultimately 
the decisions about how to achieve this was left up to the researchers, indicating that 
the ethics committee is content to trust the researchers to know what to do. Where 
limited guidance was given it focussed on the use of text based information sheets 
using child appropriate language and written leaflets with pictures to aid 
understanding. Indeed this was the approach I took at the initial phase of my research 
outlined in the Chapter 2: The Weary Traveller (pg. 39 ff.). 
Interestingly the research carried out by Parsons et al (2015) involved UK Russell 
group universities, this was justified by the research team as these universities are 
recognised to be the most research intensive universities in the UK. Meanwhile 
elsewhere in academia, and in the field of Early Childhood Research, the debate about 
ethical approaches to children as research participants continues, focussing on the 
issue of consent, assent and dissent (Harcourt et al 2011, Waller and Bitou 2011, 
Harcourt and Einarsdóttir 2011, Dockett et al 2012, Dockett and Perry 2011). 
 

 
324 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
The debate about consent, assent and indeed the apparent special consideration that 
is given to projects whereby children are participants, and of late the growing trend for 
children as research participants has resulted in careful consideration of ethical 
principles in relation to children’s participation. Much of this of course, as has been 
previously discussed in Chapter 3: Dealing with Wanderlust (pg 72 ff.), has been 
strongly influenced by UNCRC article 12 and 13 that has led to a pedagogy of listening 
(Rinaldi 2006).  
 
At this point in my thesis I add to the debate by recommending to question not the 
values that underpin approaches taken but the apparent normalising of the processes 
whereby young children have given consent. There is evidence aplenty of innovative 
ways in which researchers have sought consent, through children signing consent 
letters, (Gallagher et al 2010), identifying the emoji that best represents how they feel 
about taking part in the research activity, (Conroy and Harcourt 2009) and, for the 
youngest children, donning a hat or badge that says ‘I’m happy to be taking part’ and 
then removing it when they are no longer content to participate (Lowe 2012). A key 
outcome begins to question how the trend of children as social researchers that has 
evolved, and gathered momentum in the 21st century, and has become a normalised 
approach without, I would argue, an unpicking of the layers that come before such an 
approach. The organic nature of this thesis is built on the journey from where Children-
as-Researchers was normalised, to a moment of discovery that identified the need to 
respond to the interrelatedness of teacher identity, the place and purpose of research 
in schools, as well as the relationships between teachers and children, in order to 

 
325 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
attempt to understand the notion of Children-as-Researchers more fully. This 
problematising of the concept of Children-as-Researchers, within the thesis prompts 
me to also problematise the nature, notion and practice of ethical approaches to 
children as research participants per se. Not only in the before, but importantly in the 
afters. 
 
 
7.6.1 Crossing boundaries – appropriate steps? 
 
So this then is where things get messy, my professional position remains confident of 
the purpose and the benefits of Children-as-Research projects. However I have to 
acknowledge now an emerging feeling of dis-quietness, not just in relation to the 
effectiveness,………(is this the right word…it feels positivist and quantifiable and key 
only in response to the dominant neoliberalist discourse),……… of the research tools 
that I, and many others, have used in projects that have children as research 
participants, but also in the approaches taken to attempt to be ethical. 
I have at each step of the way taken an adult concept, something that originates in an 
adult world and tried to then mould and reshape this to make it fit in a child’s world. I 
have taken a developmental understanding of children and modified research tools, 
used regularly and with confidence by researchers in their attempts to make sense of 
the world. I have considered the benefits and challenges of using observations, 
interviews, surveys and questionnaires and applied these same evaluations to the 
modified, age appropriate, research tools created for use with children when they 

 
326 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
participate in my research. Admittedly the creative approaches I have adopted have 
gone further than the universities criticised in Parsons et al (2015) study who only 
recommended text based approaches to seeking consent from young participants. 
That said I have still provided merely a watered down version of research tools and 
methods for seeking consent that would be instantly recognisable to any qualitative 
researcher and indeed any adult participant in research. 
 
I ask now, in relation to ways we seek consent, that if for example we repeatedly ask 
young children to write their name on their painting, their work etc and reinforce name 
writing as a key skill to be learnt, how do we know that children are not just following 
through the ‘name writing’ to denote ownership when they ‘sign’ their consent to take 
part in our research. Do they understand the adult purpose of name writing/signing 
which is to denote agreement (adults don’t tend to have name tags on clothing, bags 
etc as children do) – so is there confusion here?  
 
I think about other methods used for children to indicate consent….If we are asking 
children to wear badges and hats and they are removed is this because they don’t 
want to wear a hat or that they have changed their mind about participating?  
 
If we say children can tell us if they don’t want to be involved anymore and that’s OK, 
do children have the confidence to be able to do this, given the patterns of normalised 
power differentials enacted in schools and nurseries?   

 
327 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
I wonder too if the ability of adults to tune into young children’s feelings is enough to 
be able to interpret when a child is wishing to withdraw, or is it dependent on the 
effectiveness of communication skills both in giving and receiving messages? 
 
I recall the anecdote told within The Story of Pilot Study 2 – Research Club (pg.60 ff.) 
and the troublesome incident of when the child appeared to express his right to 
withdraw and the parental intervention that interpreted that this was not the case. At 
this point in the phase 2 pilot-study I was totally dependent on other adults who knew 
and understood the children better, to read and interpret their behaviour; I had to trust 
their interpretation. Lewis (2010) emphasises the need to draw on key persons to be 
able to understand silence from children who are not able, developmentally, to give 
opinions, but this was something different. It wasn’t that the child was unable to give 
his opinion but that he presented with an opinion that was contradictory to his parent.  
As adults we take responsibility for doing what sometimes we know to be best for 
children, if then as researchers we are depending on the consent/assent/dissent of 
children can we say, with confidence, we are providing an ethical approach or is this 
a further example that we are simply offering a watered down version of adult 
engagement with research.  This to me needs further exploration and consideration, 
not to suggest that we revoke any attempts to apply ethical standards to research with, 
or by, children but rather that we recognise that this approach is different to an adult 
experience, not less but certainly not the same.

I wonder too about the right to withdraw both involvement, and data, from research. 
When the concept of the right to withdraw is considered it usually means for the 
duration of the project, but do we need to reconsider this for research when children 
are participants or active researchers? Consenting adults would, following a clear 
communication from the researcher understand what involvement in research means, 
there would even be an emotional perspective to consent that would indicate an 
interest in the research question, as well as an awareness/evaluation of the integrity, 
professionalism and trustworthiness of the researcher and research, all of which 
would, consciously or subconsciously, facilitate an adult in making a decision about 
participation. Children quite simply do not have the same amount of experiences, 
because they are children, hence the usual condition is to seek consent from parents 
and assent from children. Can researchers be confident that years later, albeit when 
the research is finished, these children who are now older continue to give their 
assent/consent? The comparative newness of the idea of children as research 
participants has not as yet raised the situation of those children who are now adults 
withdrawing consent to have images of themselves as children, or reported words that 
they said aged three to still be shared now they are adults of 23? 
Offering solutions to problems that I now see, is there a need to not just apply a child’s 
version of an adult approach to research, but a child’s approach to research, with 
different ethical considerations, accepting that whilst as adult researchers we can 
attempt to support children to understand what we are trying to achieve, there may be 
different reasons to giving assent and even dissent that even the most skilled 
researcher may not be able to interpret effectively. For me these challenges have not, 

 
329 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
at this moment in time, been considered fully in the eagerness of researchers, myself 
included, to make sense of children’s involvement in social research. This thesis whilst 
not offering definitive conclusion, provokes and challenges different ways of viewing 
normalised approaches to Children-as-Researchers.  
 
 
7.6.1.1 Crossing Boundaries – Invaders or Settlers? 
 
Pondering this further I am reminded of an experience some years ago when as a 
Nursery Head Teacher, continuing to adopt what some may call a risky approach I 
offer briefly this anecdote as a further illustration of the questions that need to be asked 
and explored in relation to adults crossing boundaries in to Children’s worlds, for 
genuine reasons but reasons that may need to be considered more fully.  
 
I attended a conference which was focussing on developing and improving outcomes 
for children and young people in the region. Having listening to various teams report 
on their developments and evaluation of services, a group of young people were 
invited to present their evaluation of children services, which they did by performing a 
Rap – Hip-Hop style. This was greeted with enthusiastic applause; our workshop 
continued when we were then asked to work as a multidisciplinary team to create an 
action-plan that was then to be presented in the style of a Rap – we were to be 
supported in the design of this with some of the young people who had presented 
earlier on. My question at the time was would we as adults, by adopting Rap to 

 
330 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
communicate, be moving into the world that is not our world? Were we seen as visitors, 
or invaders, to those young people as we entered their world?  
 
My unease is similar now. Whilst so many researchers advocate the involvement of 
children and young people in the research world are we as adults inviting them into 
our world or are we enticing them in order for us to feel better about our 
misunderstandings and uncertainties of their world? Previous research, with 
colleagues, about children participating as researchers in primary schools asked the 
question ‘What’s in it for the teachers?’ (French et al 2017). Now I am asking what’s 
in it for the children and how do we know? 
 
At this Check point I am now less certain in how I implemented my initial Children-as-
Researcher project. Having identified, as an outcome of this thesis, the need to reclaim 
teacher identity, and thereafter the need to re-examine perceptions of children through 
both my exploration of versions of childhood in the classroom, and ethical approaches 
to research, both with and by children, I now move on to review Children-as-
Researchers projects in the light of re-placing children, teachers and research.

7.7 Reviewing Children-as-Researchers projects in response to 
re-placed versions of children, teachers and research. 
 
At the start of this journey …all things keep returning to that point, partly I think 
because I am so very aware of how far I have travelled….. I accepted the challenge 
of developing a Children-as-Researchers project in an attempt to understand more 
about children’s educational lives. I rejected the idea of research on children and the 
development of that research with children; tempted and intrigued by the idea of 
research by children. Motivated by the work of Kellett (2005, 2010), I sought to develop 
ways of teaching young children research skills to enable them to carry out social 
research into their lived lives so that adults, academics, teachers, and decision makers 
might better understand their world and better interact, teach, and plan for children’s 
learning and wellbeing. The motivation was child-centred in that the outcome would 
be beneficial to children primarily and that the process of carrying out research would 
not only empower children but demonstrate the competencies of children to those who 
questioned the contribution young children could make towards adults having a better 
understanding of the child’s world.  
 
I come to this place now where I am acutely aware of the fact that others who were 
very vocal about Children-as-Researcher projects are now much quieter and some 
appear to have moved on to other fields of enquiry.  Nevertheless, the detailed 
approach to teaching young children to be researchers (Kellett 2010, Bucknall 2012) 
offered a model for good practice. Along the way this model was acknowledged to take 

 
332 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
a longitudinal approach, over a school term in most cases, and was developed as part 
of curriculum time. My interpretation in this thesis of this model, and critique of it, 
favoured a similar time period but, as outlined in the Chapter 2: The Weary Traveller,  
preferred to adopt the idea of the ‘Research Club’ approach, which promoted the 
concept of children electing to take part, rather than ‘special children’ being chosen to 
take part. Reflecting on my approach and indeed the questionnaire responses that 
were presented and analysed in the Chapter 6: ‘Well-trodden trails and off the beaten 
track’, I note that neither myself, nor Teacher-Respondents, adopted a holistic, nor a 
distinct child-like approach to Children-as-Researcher projects. In my case the 
approach I took was to offer a watered down version of a typical undergraduate 
research methods module within a social science degree programme. Similarly both 
Kellett (2010) and Bucknall (2012) present in their model a linear design that is 
summarised below and, as can be seen in Table vi, resonates with units from a 
research module delivered at my home intuition for beginning researchers at level 6.

For teachers who questioned the amount of time available, the capabilities of children 
and their engagement in research this linear approach offered a logical method to 
children to enable them to learn the necessary skills to do the research ‘properly’. This 
systematic approach, presented by Kellett (2010) and Bucknall (2012), and adopted 
by myself, reinforced the idea that children completing research projects would be 
working in the same way as adult researchers, rather than adopting a holistic, child-
centric approach to conducting research. Significantly too in this method there is only 
one way of carrying out research, the dominant paradigm in this one way being a 
conventional humanist qualitative approach.

7.7 Emerging researchers. 
  
As an educator with background in Early Years I am taken back to the time when the 
concept of emergent writing was gathering momentum, often attributed to the work of 
Marie Clay in the late 1980s and 1990s. It took a strong voice, and a commitment to 
promoting the value of young children’s early attempts at writing, to convince those 
who only recognised conventional writing and rejected mark-making as evidence of 
emerging writing. I see now the need to review Children-as-Researcher projects and 
focus on ‘emergent researchers’ rather than children who are mirroring the adult 
researcher. In offering this notion now, I see the thread that links this to earlier 
discussions about children doing research ‘properly’ which at the time were not fully 
formed (6.3.7 pg.218 ff.). 
 
I reflect upon the way that I have developed as a researcher as part of this doctoral 
journey, which has enriched my thinking and understanding of the world, not just in 
relation to my original aim, which was to explore how to actively involve children as 
co-researchers in investigating their participation in their educational lives, but so 
much more than that. The ontological journey I have taken revealed in my 
methodological shifts from conventional humanist qualitative approach to a post-
qualitative position, for me, demonstrates how I have emerged as a researcher and 
continue to be an emergent researcher.  
 

 
335 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
For Children-as-Researchers projects then I argue that there needs to be an 
acceptance that the children who participate in such projects are ‘emerging 
researchers’, not fully formed conventional researchers.  
 
If as educators there is a commitment to Children-as-Researcher initiatives then what 
this looks like needs to be reconsidered. Children’s writing does not look like adults’ 
writing, children’s questions are not like adults’ questions, children view the world 
differently to adults as they continue to explore and make sense of it through the many 
interactions with both the natural world and society. For this reason then this thesis 
(which is essentially me!) argues that, in the same way as I have journeyed through 
the idea of research- why, how and what, within a secure and nurturing environment, 
then children also need a nurturing environment to promote the same exploration of 
ideas, questions, and skills, that can be acquired in a developmentally appropriate 
way.  
 
Rather than taking a linear approach, that replicates a traditional undergraduate 
research methods module as outlined above, I argue now within this thesis that a more 
playful, developmental approach could be adopted. In itself this would not solve the 
concerns discussed previously in this chapter but, alongside a re-placed version of 
children, teachers and research, a re-viewed approach to Children-as-Researchers 
would go some way to relaunching this concept within children’s educational lives and 
experiences. 

 
336 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
Remembering of course the layers of inter/intra-action, reviewing Children-as-
Researcher projects would also be an opportunity to re-place research within teacher 
identity and to re-place a version of childhood which is limited by the dominance of 
neoliberalism in schools.  
 
The multiplicities of how to view children, teachers and research and the 
interrelatedness of these domains has been a common thread, some would say the 
golden thread, running through the thesis. Whilst not wanting to offer a linear response 
to this re-view of Children-as-Researchers, through different lenses, whilst recognising 
their interrelatedness, the second half of this ‘concluding’ chapter presents alternative 
ways of viewing Children-as-Researcher initiatives. I draw again on a familiar image 
through which I can illustrate the positioning of each viewpoint and the interrelatedness 
of the other facets that need to be acknowledged, (see Figure 18). 
 
Health warning….I am loathe to offer a sequential exploration of how to modify adult 
research methods instruction programmes, or modules. The provocations/models 
offered here relate to underpinning approaches rather than simply a series of 
strategies or sequence of lessons/experiences. They can be viewed as layers that 
cross-over and over lap, and could be viewed singularly or collectively.

7.8 Children-as-Researchers – Apprenticeship Model. 
 
Figure 18 – Models of Children-as-Researcher Projects –Apprenticeship Facet 
 
This first model offered by this thesis is an ‘Apprenticeship Model’. It accepts the 
complexities of what it means to become a researcher, as well as accepting that 
children will be at different levels and stages of development and learning at different 
times, and that progress may some tines be slow and barely noticeable, whilst for 
others it will be rapid and self-evident. This model understands the research process 
in a holistic way rather than a linear approach. For this reason play features heavily 
as it is through this tool for learning that children develop skills as well as attitudes and 
values that will support them as researchers, all the while learning from more 
experienced others, which may well be their teachers as researchers as well as other 
Children-as-Researchers.  
 

 
338 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Adopting a playful approach to Children-as-Researcher initiatives can be seen as one 
way to move away from only involving older, more literate children in Children –as-
Researcher initiatives. Play, being the basis for nurturing inquisitiveness and curiosity, 
through the generation of learning environments that promote social values of justice, 
democracy and tolerance of opinions, resonates with my preferred approach to 
enquiry and problem solving as seen in this thesis. 
 
The image presented in Figure 19, suggesting a holistic rather than a linear, sequential 
model, adopts a version of childhood that sees children as individuals, as social actors 
in their own right, rather than mini-adults driven by a neoliberal ideology. 
 
Figure 19 – Apprenticeship Model – Children-as-Researcher Projects 
 

 
339 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Recognising that although in this thesis and elsewhere, e.g. Ball (2016), there may be 
a call to arms against the dominance of neoliberalism, at the moment the link between 
performance and outcomes, and judgements of quality, are governed by the neoliberal 
matrices (Ball 2016). For those teachers, and schools, with the confidence and 
determination to challenge the neoliberal dominance a strategic approach to mapping 
the expected curriculum against learning as part of research initiatives in schools 
would give both a sense of control and empowerment in that teachers were regaining 
control of the curriculum, but would also stave off any criticism of poor attainment. This 
is exactly the sort of approach to challenging neoliberalism in education that Sims 
(2017:6) advocates, adopting the idea of ‘courageous leaders’. In adopting this feature 
of an ‘Apprenticeship Model’, teachers would also be challenging neoliberalism and 
being ‘courageous leaders’ and indeed part of a ‘courageous fellowship’. By adopting 
an ‘Apprenticeship Model’ of Children-as-Researchers teachers would also be 
challenging a neoliberal version of childhood by remaining focused on social justice, 
democracy, whereby children have the right to participate (Brown 2015, Burman 
2011), and notably Giroux (2013, 2015). Within the ‘Apprenticeship Model’ the 
emphasis is on rights and responsibilities. Giroux (2015) and Sims (2017) suggest 
such a value driven approach to learning is what is essentially missing from current 
pedagogies. In reclaiming this through the ‘Apprenticeship Model’ teachers would be 
in a position to deliver the child –centred curriculum of which they often speak.  
 
Similarly the ‘Apprenticeship Model’ gives space and time for children to develop at 
their individual pace, within a nurturing environment, rather than being seen as 

 
340 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
commodities where their value is based on potential future employment. Pedagogically 
the emphasis being on playful interactions re-positions children as children, and not 
simply as mini-adults who are replicating adult behaviour. For younger children this 
may well be encouraging the asking of questions and recording these, interviewing 
characters in role-play situations, voting and gathering opinions about what class 
books to read, what activities to do next. For older children this may include gathering 
information about what their peers think about in relation to implementation of new 
strategies and aspects of organisation, both in imagined worlds or in the real world. 
For some schools this may even be in relation to what children are learning and 
activities to support the agreed learning outcomes.  
 
This model acknowledges the journey to be taken when considering research, in the 
same way that children take a journey of discovery when learning to read and write in 
order to make sense of the word and share their understanding of it. The journey of 
the apprentice is a long one, not completed in a term or even following a series of 
planned events but through nurturing and tentative exploration at the side of a master 
who is able to model and draw on their experience, in this case of research activity. 
For this reason I argue that teachers need to be open and honest about their own 
research and share and celebrate this with the children and wider community.

7.9 Children-as-Researchers – Community Model. 
 
Figure 20 - Models of Children-as-Researcher Projects –Community Facet 
 
This thesis offers a second approach to developing Children-as-Researcher initiatives, 
identified as a ‘Community Model’, (Figure 21), however this is not offered as a straight 
forward alternative. Whilst there may be an individually preferred route to be adopted 
by schools wishing to develop Children-as-Researcher initiatives in the light of this 
thesis, overlaying the ideas and provocations offered in the ‘Community Model’ here 
with all, or some of, the ‘Apprenticeship Model’ is just one, of many possibilities.  
 
I am mindful to restate that the thesis, and recommendations offered in this part of my 
‘Check point’ is not limited by a one size fits all approach.  This idea of multiplicities is 
key in understanding my ontological view of the world. The drive here is to consider 
how working as part of a community can provide a route into Children-as-Researcher 
projects.  

 
342 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
In many ways this view has been triggered by my reflections on ethical approaches to 
children as research participants and how the dilemma of who has a greater 
awareness of the needs and individuality of children when they are research 
participants. I reflected in Crossing boundaries – appropriate steps? (7.6.1 pg 325 ff.) 
on the involvement of a parent in the research activity and how her tacit knowledge of 
her child enabled a greater understanding of his needs and his way of communicating 
them. In that episode I depended on parental involvement to navigate through an 
ethical dilemma. That episode has prompted the idea of an approach that is more 
community grounded in order to adopt what this thesis argues to be a more ethical 
approach to Children-as-Researcher projects, both as participants and as researchers 
in their own right. The ‘Community Model’ which would involve parents and other 
family members could potentially overcome some of the ethical challenges faced, and 
promote some of the possibilities offered previously when considering re-placing 
research as an integral part of teacher identity. Adopting such a model would not only 
re-place research within teacher identity but would also go some way to re-placing 
children in a different version of childhood. 
 
Teachers becoming actively involved in their community provides a way to reclaim 
their identity and, as Giroux (2013) advocates, for teachers to be seen as ‘Public 
Intellectuals’. This re-placing of teachers as part of a re-professionalisation may be 
another way of challenging the technical positioning of teachers that Giroux (2015) 
would argue is another indicator of the dominance of neoliberalism.  Adopting a 
‘Community Model’ to Children-as-Researchers initiatives establishes a direct 

 
343 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
challenge both to neoliberalism in education and to the neoliberal versions of 
childhood that sees children as a commodity and reduced to numbers and outcomes. 
Similarly taking the focus of the research away from school and placing it in the 
community provides both space and time for consideration of democratic values, 
social justice and responsibilities – all of which lie at the heart of teacher values 
according to Willemse et al (2016). 
 
 
Figure 21 – Community Model – Children-as-Researcher Projects 
 
 
Whilst this model suggests adopting a co-researcher approach to designing and 
carrying out the research, and may for some challenge the fundamentals of Children-

 
344 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
as-Researchers in their own right, for me this becomes less of an issue when 
considering my own research experience that was/is often more collegiate, co-
operative and collaborative than it is individualised. Added to this, the emotional and 
nurturing benefits of collaboration and children as co-researchers, who can have their 
existing skills acknowledged and be supported to develop further by more 
knowledgeable others, does nothing to diminish the premise of Children-as 
Researchers. In this way the ‘Community Model’ is over laid on the ‘Apprenticeship 
Model’, rather than being seen separately as an alternative. 
 
Consideration of the idea of learning communities Willemse et al (2016), and 
Vangrieken et al (2017), identified that when teachers were part of ‘Communities of 
Inquiry’ they reported increased levels of confidence and participation, and the 
research they undertook as part of professional development was more likely to be 
completed and to be successful. Establishing a ‘Community Model’ for children, 
teachers and other adults, as researchers may well be successful in the same way. 
The idea of shared responsibility and shared interests has likewise been 
acknowledged by BERA/RSA (2014) as a key driver to successful teacher research. 
The possibilities within a ‘Community Model’ could be argued to be beneficial to 
children, teacher and adult researchers alike. This is not to say that I am suggesting a 
watered down version of adult research communities in which children can be 
researchers, this approach is underpinned by a clear pedagogical position that 
recognises the advantages of the nature of group-working for children, as understood 
by social learning theory and social constructivism. 

 
345 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
And so to remember here that this model is not an alternative but another facet that 
comes in to focus as Children-as-Researcher initiatives are reviewed, having re-
placed children, research and teachers. And so to re-view further, I move now to re-
consider how the idea of partnerships can present yet another possibility. 
 
 
7.10 Children-as-Researchers – Partnerships Model. 
 
Figure 22 - Models of Children-as-Researcher Projects –Partnership Facet 
 
A turn brings into focus the idea of partnerships and how the possibilities of partnership 
between Schools and Higher Education Institutions may well enable a rethinking about 
Children-as-Research projects, (Figure 22). Previous research, (French et al 2017), 
identified that teachers reported increased confidence in undertaking research having 

 
346 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
participated in Children-as-Researcher projects with a partner HEI. To be able to 
achieve this more fully in the sector a greater investment in the relationship between 
HEIs and schools needs to be nurtured. The changing nature of Initial Teacher 
Education has driven a wedge between schools and universities. Through establishing 
effective research, or CPD, based partnerships between education professionals who 
profess to hold the same values of social justice and democracy at their heart, there 
is a further opportunity for those who wish to set about challenging the dominance of 
neoliberalism, and provides openings to become ‘courageous leaders’ who generate 
‘courageous fellowships’ (Sims 2017). Whilst there is evidence of a movement towards 
a more neoliberal ideology within Higher Education, (Mahony & Weiner 2017) currently 
there is still, just, (Ball 2016) more flexibility and educational freedom within HEIs than 
in the compulsory education sector.   
 
Consequently I would suggest, as one of many possibilities, that the responsibility for 
developing such research partnerships lies with HEIs colleagues, and it is they who 
must seize this before any more educational freedom is taken away. It is schools who 
now take the lead in regards to practice elements and the technical training elements 
of teacher education, however it is HEIs who have the expertise and experience in 
research (BERA/RSA 2014).  Developing a ‘Partnership Model’ promotes and 
facilitates a shared interest in Children-as-Research projects and, I argue, would go 
some way towards re-viewing different ways of implementing Children-as-Researcher 
projects, (see Figure 23). 
 

 
347 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 23 - Community Model – Children-as-Researcher Projects 
 
Not to be seen as an alternative model in a singular way, the possibilities of a 
‘Partnership Model’ could/would be adopted alongside, within, partly or wholly, the 
other models already considered. An overlapping of key messages are evident within 
each possible model that go beyond simple repetition.  This illustrates my ontological 
view of the world of inter-relatedness and multiple versions and possibilities. 
 
The multiple possibilities within this ‘Partnership Model’ allow a serendipitous 
approach that is not just a way to re-view Children-as-Researcher initiatives but 
collectively affords for research to be re-placed within teacher identity, and for children 

 
348 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
to be re-placed in other versions of childhood. Within this model teachers have further 
possibilities to become ‘public intellectuals’, (Giroux 2013), through a nurturing 
environment in which to critique the curriculum and pedagogical approaches adopted 
within their community of practice. When teachers re-claim research they also reclaim 
their professionalism, becoming less like technicians. (Giroux 2013, 2015). Further 
possibilities within this model are revealed when considering how pre–service 
teachers develop their professional identity. As noted previously, (pg. 309 ff), Beltman 
et al (2015) suggested that pre-service teachers base their ideals and values of what 
it is to be a teacher upon their personal, and emotional, experiences of teachers. 
Within a ‘Partnership Model’ which facilitates pre-service teachers, alongside in-
service teachers, carrying out research within communities of practice, the possibilities 
of re-placing research as an integral part of teacher identity are apparent. The 
relationship between pre-service and in-service teachers who take on an active role 
within a research community is key, with in-service teachers modelling to pre-service 
teachers that research is indeed an integral part of their identities. Whilst BERA/RSA 
(2014) suggest this is all about establishing a self-improving education system, this 
thesis argues that this is also about re-establishing an environment whereby Children-
as-Researchers initiatives can be immersed within children’s experience of education.  
 
The process of re-viewing approaches to Children-as-Researcher projects has come 
about as a result of the thesis arguing for a need to re-place research, teachers and 
children. These three domains, as has been acknowledged both here and within the 

 
349 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Chapter 6: Well-trodden trails and off the beaten track’, are not just linked but overlap, 
react and inter/intra-act. Each cannot be contemplated and considered in isolation.   
 
7.11 Final, for now, thoughts. 
 
This journey of discovery for which I have mapped a route has strayed far away from 
original simplistic questions to which I thought I would be finding answers. My starting 
point of asking: ‘How might young children be active participants in researching their 
own educational lives?’, and ‘How is children’s participation, within the field of 
education, understood by children and other stakeholders?’ became less clear and 
less achievable as my view of the world developed.  
 
The nomadic experience of this research has meant that I shifted my thoughts 
triggered by lines of flight to consider: 
- 
What place does research play in teachers lives and what do they believe 
is the relationship between research and their practice? 
- 
How do teachers understand and promote the rights of the child to conduct 
their own research? 
- 
How does professional identity impact on teachers seeing themselves as 
researchers? 
- 
What prevents or encourages teachers to carry out research in their 
classrooms? 

 
350 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
- 
How do teachers value the voice of children and how are they responding 
to opportunities for children to become researchers? 
- 
Why is it so challenging for adult gatekeepers to consent to access and 
involvement with research? 
 
 
And having adopted a critical diffractive analysis I am left at the rest point here, not a 
final destination but a Check Point to problematise the notion of research, teachers 
and versions of childhood. Whilst I do not apologise for not answering my initial 
questions in a conventional humanist qualitative manner I accept that, through the 
entanglements experienced, that I leave this point with more questions asked than 
answered.  
 
I move now to my final chapter which will attempt to summarise my learning as an 
integral part of this research apprenticeship. In doing so I reflect on the souvenirs 
collected on the way that represent my lived experience on this research journey, and 
show how these can souvenirs can make a contribution to others  in the field who wish 
to journey these, or similar paths.

8.1 Souvenirs from a Post-Qualitative Journey. 
 
In this final chapter of the thesis I am collecting together, and recollecting, the 
significant points arising out of this research journey in order to highlight the distance, 
and route, I have travelled. That distance is not just a measurement of the route taken, 
which has already been presented, but the distance travelled from then to now in my 
confidence as a researcher, my in-depth thinking, and significantly my ontological view 
of the world. Thereby I show my journey from a conventional humanist qualitative 
approach to the post-qualitative. Continuing with the metaphor of journeys, trips and 
cartographies I adopt the term souvenirs to communicate the purpose and place of 
these salient concepts.  These souvenirs are not just proffered as a nostalgic reminder 
of where I have been, but as triggers to enable potential future trips to be planned.  
Reflecting on these souvenirs I also aim to offer advice to prospective future travellers 
who, prompted by my research may wish to pick up where I have, for the moment, left 
off.  
 
Additionally, these souvenirs are also offered here as gifts to those who have not 
travelled this route themselves but hope to understand more of my travel experiences. 
On a recent trip overseas I was introduced to the idea of omiyage, the Japanese 
cultural tradition of giving a small gift to others when you have travelled away. The 
purpose of omiyage is to show appreciation to family and friends that they have 
managed in your absence. In many ways then the souvenirs discussed are also, small 
but not insignificant gifts, offered to those who have not taken this journey with me and 

 
353 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
also to those who have managed without me whilst I have been immersed in my 
doctoral studies. These gifts are also offered as my knowledge contribution to the 
wider education research community.  
 
 
8.2 Developing Academic Literacies – Alternative ways of 
doing. 
 
When thinking about my doctoral journey and which aspect of this has impacted on 
me most of all, my immediate thoughts turn to my writing, even as I place this text 
upon this page, choosing the right word, the expression, and the order of phrases 
through which to communicate and share my research. The development of a more 
sophisticated appreciation of academic literacy/ies, then is my first souvenir.  
 
As I reach the final chapter in thesis, recognising that at some point I do have to stop, 
my approach to my writing now is different to the earlier chapters.  As part of the editing 
process I revisit and rethink, and retune my writing, however the danger of this 
becomes evident as I realise that in doing so I am driven to offer a polished/finished 
article and the journey of discovery and emerging confidence of thought, and writing 
is lost. Earlier versions showing emerging ideas and competencies are rubbed out, 
erased and eliminated: emphasising that the outcome, the product, is the measure of 
success rather than the processes that led/leads to this moment. In discovering a new 
found confidence of creativity in my writing I remember and re-present the idea that 

 
354 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
the aspiration, and indeed the challenges of post-qualitative researchers is to ‘produce 
different knowledge and produce knowledge differently’ (Lather 2006:52).  
The realisation that not only my approach to writing, but my writing style, has changed 
and evolved throughout the doctoral process is a direct response to the recognition 
that this process has given me academic freedom and confidence to develop 
alternative ways of thinking and, importantly with regards to my academic literacy, to 
present these ideas and communicate in ways that respond to that new found 
creativity. 
 
Honan and Bright (2016) in their discussion around writing a thesis differently lament 
the reductionist approach to conventional support and guidance to doctoral students, 
warning of a ‘textual maze’ (p732) that students need to traverse. As Honan and Bright 
(2016) advocate I have not attempted to write ‘according to what is expected’, but ‘to 
create- to bring something to life’ (p733).  
 
French (2016: 114), in her exploration of post/graduate academic writing practices 
identifies from the outset that research ‘always constructs an identity for the 
researcher’, naïvely, perhaps, I had not accounted for this as part of the research 
experience. Whilst stating confidently early on in The Weary Traveller (pg.39 ff.) that 
my approach would be a reflexive one, it is not until this stage of the journey looking 
back, and looking forward, that I recognise the complexities of reflexivity and 
understand these more, in many ways like Attia and Edge (2017) who make the link 

 
355 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
between reflexivity and human development. They refer to previous work (Edge 2011) 
to suggest that reflexivity is best understood in terms of prospective and retrospective 
elements (Attia and Edge 2017:35), whereby ‘prospective reflexivity’ centres on the 
impact of the researcher on the research whilst ‘retrospective reflexivity’ concerns itself 
with the impact of the research on the researcher. It is this latter element that I take 
away from this research experience as a perceptible souvenir.  
 
Considering who I am, who I have become, and am becoming, I see a different 
researcher definitely but also a different educator and, I would argue, a different 
partner, parent and family member. Like Attia and Edge (2017), for me it is the 
recognition of the interrelatedness between these states of being that I take away from 
my research journey. It seems like a cliché to say that this research journey has 
changed me, however Sandywell (1996) cited in Attia and Edge (2017:35) suggests 
that ‘a reflexive practice never returns the self to the point of origin’. This idea of the 
formation of a new-self is also referred to by Forbes (2008) who, in exploring the place 
of reflexivity in doctoral study, suggests the journey of study enables the doctoral 
student to shift identities. Like me, Forbes is influenced by Foucault, likening the 
interrelatedness and nexus of reflexive learning to a Foucauldian knot, and it is this 
knotted path of changing identities that has taken me into a new self. Forbes (2008) 
suggests that it is the process of writing reflexively that reveals this new self.  
 

 
356 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
In the same way that I have tried to capture and communicate the fluxes around 
teachers, children and research, within the concept of Children-as-Researchers, and 
explored/ am exploring these as unstable, I reach for this souvenir of my research 
journey that depicts my identity and see it too as unstable, permeable and open to 
change. This is shown within the to-ing and fro-ing of my reflexive writings as Forbes 
(2008) suggests. This constructing/deconstructing/reconstructing of self is a risky 
business, there is uncertainly and risk going into the new, never seen spaces, as I 
followed and responded to lines of flight. It is these new spaces that were revealed 
through my reflexive writings that I offer to others who are also intrigued by the notion 
of Children-as-Researchers 
 
My playful approach to writing, whilst not quite the same as Watson (2015) who 
advocated the use of humour as an integral part of research in the social sciences, 
both as a tool for analysis and presentation, is simply fun, a different way to think about 
research, not to be too serious but to be enjoyed. For me this approach attempted to 
explore at various points in the thesis different ways to present and to illustrate both 
my changing identity and the changing epistemological positions. Adopting a more 
playful approach to research contributes a refreshed research experience that 
challenges conformity and convention. The reflexive approach had/has elements of 
narrative weaving throughout, this allowed/allows me to be placed with/in and 
alongside the research story to be told, not in an egocentric way but to demonstrate 
the interrelatedness of the research and researcher. In doing so I found my voice, 
particularly in the asides that I now know was/is an approach adopted by St Pierre and 

 
357 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Pillow (2000) as they examined ‘doing’ reflexive writing. The writing itself has been a 
transformative process and I have been able to think differently through my writing 
which I would agree with Fox and Allan (2013) has been a bumpy ride. 
 
 
8.2.1 Trip Advisor: Alternative ways of doing 
 
And here then, in playful manner, with some humour, I offer a review, based on the 
familiar Trip Advisor style (Graphotomontage 5). Playfully I summarise my learning 
and offer support for potential choices of future travellers; please note all views are 
entirely based on my own experience. 
 
 
“Writing is a methodology and part of the process not the 
end product.” 
“Be aware you will change.” 
“It’s a bumpy ride.” 
Thanks for the advice!

8.3 The Sound of Silence – Alternative ways of listening. 
 
My first souvenir, developing academic literacies, revealed through my reflexive 
approach, enabled my individuality to come alive through the research process and, 
significantly for me, to be established through the writing process. The irony of course 
is that the process of completing this thesis, and the journey mapped throughout, is 
how my voice was/is found, and yet this second souvenir to be gifted focuses on the 
silences, quietnesses and emptinesses within that research experience.  
Early on in the research experience I was driven by the determination to empower 
children through Children-as-Research projects and to enable their ‘voice’ to be heard. 
This was a focus of the initial stages of designing the project and discussed within 

 
359 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Dealing with Wanderlust that examined literature related to Children’s Voice. (pg.84 ff.), 
where I reviewed the development of the movement to promote this ideology founded 
in UNCRC (1989). Later, following my ontological turn I moved to examine the place 
of silence (3.10 pg.110 ff.) At this point I return to that silence, not that I am reverting 
to a binary view of the world, that considers ‘voice’ and ‘silence’ as opposites, but 
rather I want to emphasise the place of the empty set and the presence of nothingness, 
as a souvenir and gift for others so that it is not missed, overlooked or ignored by future 
travellers along this path. 
 
Within a conventional humanist qualitative approach silences in interviews and data 
are seen to be annoyances, perhaps indicative of the lack of skills or empathy of the 
interviewer. I would argue that this should not be the case and that silences require to 
be listened to and acknowledged. I hear the significant of silences for example, within 
music; the pause, the rest, which adds to- not takes away from, the rhythm and soul 
of the composition. I think again about the patterns and intricacies of filigree, 
latticework and lacework and see how the whole is only understood in the presence 
of absence. Mazzei (2007) supports me here as she promotes thinking with Deleuze, 
which I have attempted to adopt throughout the thesis, and draws attention to 
Deleuze’s concept of ‘re-imaging of voice’ (1983, 1985). This re-imaging of voice within 
my research context, apart from a prompt to review how I perceive data, has 
challenged me to move to a different plane (following a line of flight?), whereby voice 
becomes not just that which is spoken, but that which is not spoken, a holistic 
recognition of the context of communication. Mazziei (2007) suggests that there is a 

 
360 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
need to rethink the idea of ‘voice’ but not only in relation to those who are perceived 
to be powerless and marginalised and for whom voice may be dangerous or not 
trusted. She raises concerns about the limited use of silence in qualitative data 
(Mazzei 2007, Mazzei and Jackson 2012) and again emphasises the need to view 
voice differently within context and not just in a conventional way that hears ‘voice’ as 
a form of truth that reveals the self. It is within the context of qualitative data that the 
‘other’ can be heard, in the pauses, the silences and, for me, the stillness in absence, 
which is what I have attempt to do and offer as my contribution to the debate started 
by Mazzei and Jackson (2012). 
 
My curiosity, and subsequent exploration of how to reinterpret ‘voice’ throughout the 
thesis has come about through my reflexive approach. I acknowledge and hear the 
voices of the Teacher-Respondents, and my own voice, within the data produced by 
the survey, along with the voices of theorists and others who have written and 
expressed views, interpretations and analyses before me. All of these voices form the 
data set to which I respond. In this way the multiplicity of voices, which I liken to a choir 
performing a choral piece, demonstrates the texture, dynamics, harmony, melody, 
rhythm, form and text that create a collective experience of the concept that is 
Children-as-Researchers. If I am thinking with theory, in my case thinking with Deleuze 
and Guatarri (1987), I respond to the assemblage, the process of fitting these voices 
together, making connections and ‘seeing’’ voice (Deleuze 1986/1989). 
I am aware of the need to recognise how, within the context of schools, children and 
research, and, certainly as part of the initial stages of this doctoral study, ‘voice’ is 

 
361 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
seen as empowering and ‘silence’ is perceived to be disempowering. This is the 
cultural, and binary, context within which I began my research journey, recognising 
that here I am referring to the first step on this particular leg of my research journey 
and not the ‘beginning’.  
 
The approach to schooling, the organisations of schools and learning communities, 
and my own professional identity, as a teacher and an academic, are governed and 
created by the social context and cultural constructions that influence and form them. 
In the same way, how communication is understood, and how the term and concept 
of ‘voice’ is understood, are similarly constructed within a cultural context.  Within the 
Western tradition the idea of having ‘voice’ is seen as positive, empowering, and linked 
to the concepts of freedom, whereas silence is understood to be indicative of being 
downtrodden and subservient.  
 
I discover that this is not the case within other cultures, for example in Japanese 
culture (Kawabata and Gastaldo 2015) and again in the nomadic culture of Australian 
Aboriginal people (Mushin and Gardner 2009). In both these studies the place of 
silence within conversations and interactions is understood to have meaning and 
relevance. Sometimes the silences are placed to allow time for reflections and 
processing, a time for a deeper understanding to take place, (Mushin and Gardner 
2009). At other times silences provides subtle meanings that are sensitive in a culture 
that maintains a wish not to offend, and is interpreted as, ‘no more’ without having to 

 
362 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
deny or quieten the questioner (Kawabata and Gastaldo 2015). However in both 
Japanese and Australian Aboriginal culture the use of silence is linked to a greater 
connectivity with both those ancestors who have gone before, and the wider social 
community; and in doing so acknowledges the idea that self and individuality is not a 
priority as individuals are each seen as being part of a cultural heritage and social 
collective. 
 
For me then the recognition of silence as data, of the present absence, is indicative of 
the intra and interrelatedness of key concepts being explored. When thinking with 
theory, these cannot be ignored or viewed as anomalies to be placed to one side and 
forgotten about. I have found, through my research journey, that I was only able to do 
this when taking a slower, calmer approach to producing data and when viewing, 
reviewing and re-viewing, and then presenting, representing and re-presenting the 
communications and conversations that emerged from the survey. The slowing down 
of my analyses allowed/allows time for a reflexive approach that generated not just a 
percolation of ideas but for a response to the silence and the present absence. 
 
At times I found myself responding to my conventional humanist roots worrying if I had 
enough data.  Now/then with confidence in my new researcher identity created for 
myself, following my hyper-reflexive approach, I see that less is more. Taking a slower 
more considered attitude has allowed me to be fully immersed in the research that has 

 
363 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
taken me along a ‘line of flight’ that accepts and values silence, and acknowledges the 
interrelatedness of silence and voice, of absence and presence.  
 
Moving forward I urge other travellers to consider their interactions with participants 
and to move beyond ‘listening’ whereby they believe themselves to be ‘enabling voices 
to be heard’ and counsel an approach that adopts ‘seeing’ voice and responding to 
the complexities of that in order to respond to the bigger picture.

8.4 Cartographic Images – New ways of seeing. 
 
When selecting my third and final souvenir from this trip, it comes as no surprise that 
I draw upon the same reflexive approach that has impacted throughout the doctoral 
study. The inter/intra related nature of my research is evident here as I gaze along the 
potential mementoes on offer. Finally I chose something that is part of my new ‘self’, 
the researcher- educator I have become as part of this journey, and which would not 
have been an aspect of the previous versions of my researcher self. The reflexive 
approach has prompted a new wave of creativity through which emerges something 
that previously would have been very alien in my thinking and organisation of ideas. I 
offer this souvenir that is indicative of the liminal space that is old-self and new-self. 
The analogy of traveling, of my journey and the terrain encountered has come out of 
a new playfulness and creative approach to writing. Building on this new found 
creativity as part of this ‘Trip Review’ I move now to re-present the cartographic, and 
playful, interpretation of my research journey, Image 13.  

 
365 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
 
Image 13 – Cartographic representations 
 
 
According to Pink (2013) and Spencer (2010) the use of visual methods within social 
research is dependent on adopting a reflexive approach, so it is perhaps not a 
surprising addition to this chapter that I draw upon visual methods in order to 
communicate the journey taken. The aim of the cartographic image, offered as an 
outcome of the thesis, is to illuminate the journey taken, in a playful manner, showing 
the interconnected elements of the journey and the nomadic features as the 

 
366 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
topography and terrain of Children-as-Researchers was/is explored. I see this 
mapping to be interpreted as both a holistic overview and simultaneously to be viewed 
alongside the narrative and reflexive asides seen throughout this thesis (St Pierre and 
Pillow 2000). As such this visual method mirrors the ‘layered textural (structural and 
visual) analyses’ proffered by Covert and Koro-Ljunberg (2015:316) who used a 
layered approach in order to analyse images, which they refer to as ‘photo –elicitation’.  
 
In my study this layering is a further reflection of the inter-connectivity of my research, 
drawing upon the idea of the cartographic image, together with the text, and narratives, 
working together to deliver the research encounter. This shift to visual research, as an 
analytical tool, potentially, and as data to be analysed is a new direction that I would 
suggest could become a new venture moving forward...and so continuing the journey 
presented here. This in itself is representative of the blurring of methodologies I 
adopted and has led to a new way of thinking about methodologies and 
nonconventional approaches. 
 
My wanderings through this ‘Cartography of Practices in Research with Young 
Children’ represented as a nomadic wandering, sometimes being lost then found, is 
akin to psycho-geography which in its playful way attempts to explore urban 
environments and their impact on the psyche. When attempting to define psycho-
geography Coverley (2018) acknowledges that the term is always shifting and whilst 
from a contemporary perspective it now incorporates art, film, political strategies and 

 
367 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
philosophy, the key elements that remain are the wanderer, and walking. This is the 
golden thread as seen through the metaphor of travels adopted throughout my 
research which assumes the idea of walking and journeying and can be said to 
consider the impact of the landscape (territory) of this research process on my psyche. 
Furthermore, Coverley (2018) links not only playfulness but provocation and trickery 
as being part of the spirit of psycho-geography, which was identified as my approach 
at the beginning/end in my epi-prologue (pg. 17 ff.) and resonates throughout my 
travelogue. Richardson (2017) develops these ideas of a walking based exploration of 
urban space some more and re-invents the notion of psycho-geography, developing it 
into what she terms ‘schitzocartography’, which she uses to explain the layering and 
multiplicities of interpretation of the urban landscape. In her discussion Richardson 
(2017), acknowledges the influences of Guattari, and promotes a flexibility in 
interpretation that recognises the multiplicities of encounters with buildings and urban 
environments. Similarly for me my final souvenir draws these ideas together in a 
playful and engaging manner with a presentation of my map, Image 13 – Cartographic 
representations. This is yet another reminder of how my research encounter has found 
the, initially hidden, spaces and interactions besides, between, in front of and behind 
children, research, and teachers. 
8.4.1 Trip Advisor: new ways of seeing. 
 
Risky play……creative approaches and hints at future creative possibilities, being 
open to alternatives reveals the ‘other’ that may well be the catalyst for new 
learning…it was/is for me.

Within the playful approach and opportunity to take on risk, there remains a fraction of 
nervousness as seen in the 4.5 rated review (Graphotomontage 7). 
 
 
“Don’t be afraid to have fun, play is a powerful tool for 
learning.” 
“Try new ideas and be creative.” 
“Find alternative ways to present your ideas, experiment with 
paper, texture and colour as alternative dimensions to your 
communication.”

8.5 Post Script 
 
The souvenirs offered as gifts to my readers promote further thinking and 
deliberations and, as I have suggested in 7.11 Final, for now, thoughts, provide food 
for thought for future travellers. I identify the key messages within this thesis to be 
the bridge from what is already known and understood about Children-as-
Researchers to the new spaces within that concept. To clarify these messages and 
indeed what this thesis contributes I return to the idea of multiples and layers taking 
my proposed audiences singularly to offer how and where this thesis impacts.  
 

 
369 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
For those researchers wishing to explore, consider or engage with post-qualitative 
approaches to research the thesis shares a personal narrative that offers my 
experiences, advice and encouragement. The dominance of a Scientific Based 
Research lies heavily in contemporary education research (St Pierre 2012). I argue 
that my travelogue matters to those who identify their leanings towards an ontology 
of becoming (Deleuze and Guattari1991), perhaps like me, as a result of feeling out 
of sync with the conventional qualitative approach to researching the social world, 
particularly in education and within children’s worlds of education. The travelogue I 
share here matters to those who are commencing that journey to the post and ‘new 
beginnings’ (Koro-Ljunberg 2016) and want to tentatively explore new ways of 
producing new knowledge differently (St Pierre 1997). 
 
For those teachers wishing to explore, consider, or engage with different ways of 
adopting and enacting Children-as-Researchers projects, the thesis provides 
multiple alternatives of doing this, challenging the dominance of the previous linear 
approaches. These approaches offered in 7.7 Reviewing Children-as-Researchers 
(pg 322 ff.)  present different models for developing school and or community based 
projects but are all influenced by the underpinning  idea of Children as Emergent 
Researchers. This new concept is key as it promotes the idea of children as 
researchers, not just replicating adult behaviour but being valued and recognised for 
who they are now as well as the idea of them becoming, again the rejection of 
binaries is key here. Linked to my own journey of discovering the posts this thesis 

 
370 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
matters to all those curious about Children-as Researchers as it demands a pausing 
and slowing down of these initiatives to ask why, as well as how.  
 
For those teacher educators wishing to explore, consider or engage with different 
ways of training teachers and be more responsive and more questioning of the place 
of research in teachers professional lives this thesis matters as it demands the 
opening up of a conversation about the place of research in initial teacher education, 
about teacher identity and about new ways of training teachers as reflexive, thinking 
professionals rather than technicians of education. The thesis matters as it demands 
a re-thinking and re-positioning of initial teacher training programmes to respond to 
the new spaces revealed in between children-research-teachers. 
 
In short the thesis matters at different layers to multiple audiences, and this is 
influenced by the complexity and the interrelatedness of both the concepts of 
Children–as-Researchers and the experiences of my research journey represented 
in the thesis. 
 
What started as an exploration of ways to actively involve children as co-researchers 
in investigating their educational lives has resulted in new knowledge of previously 
unnoticed spaces in which to explore the notion of Children-as-Researchers.  I say 
unnoticed as they were always there but have been revealed and mapped as an 
outcome of a blurred methodological approach which allowed a fermenting of the 

 
371 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
conventional stable lines of methodological attack. This blurred methodological 
approach, which Koro-Ljunberg (2017: 79) would describe as ‘fluid diverse and 
constantly changing’ revealed these new spaces and their surprises within. The 
spaces that were deemed barren have, with a blurred methodological approach, been 
found to be fruitful. Those spaces that were conventionally silent have opened up to 
reveal their voices. The idea of identifying what a blurred methodology looks like is 
challenging, it remains an approach, a confidence and a determination. The blurring 
of methodologies narrated here are not the one way, but the energy of my experience 
is hoped to be the provocation for a new experience for other educational researchers. 
The souvenirs discussed in this chapter are not just for me but are offered to the 
community of educational researchers as new ways of thinking, particularly about the 
notion of Children-as-Researchers.  
 
Journeying is tiring, and demands rests, some short breaks to catch your breath, 
others for longer periods of time, which is where I stand now. I have taken away a 
multitude of experiences and encounters that remain with me, the key souvenirs 
offered and discussed here are treasured and continue to provoke me to consider 
where next, and are also offered as provocations for others who wish to take up this 
path. For my next journey, which may be some time away yet, I have a new post-
structuralist tool kit developed as part of this research encounter and it provides 
enough fuel to challenge me to consider: 
Alternative ways to present my ideas and findings, communicating beyond 
what is constrained by printed text on paper. 

 
372 
RJLowe  
 
 
 
Making more sense of silence as a data set 
Further explorations of children’s values and beliefs about the world. 
 
This final chapter in the thesis is the end point, for the moment, and at this point I am 
not so sure if I have answered questions initially posed or simply found new questions 
for others to answer. In doing so, I return to the beginning, or maybe the middle, in 
search of a new ending, or new beginning as did Frodo in Tolkien’s  Lord of the Rings 
epic.  
 
‘This tale grew in the telling of it’, the opening lines of the foreword of one of the 
greatest epic tales of travel, journey and discovery, (JRR Tolkien The Lord of the Rings 
1954) perhaps encapsulates the essence of this thesis. Through the writing, and 
reading, of this thesis the research presented has become dependent on what came 
before, alongside, and will inevitably come after.

Research in Educational Settings 
Page 1: Research in Educational Settings 
 
Welcome 
Thank you for showing interest in my PhD thesis, which is about research in education and children’s 
involvement in research. 
I am now exploring the values, perceptions and beliefs about research held by teachers and 
practitioners in early years settings and schools. The data gathered from this survey will contribute 
to my findings. 
The survey should take no more than 30 - 40 minutes to complete. Responses will be anonymous, 
however if you would be happy to be contacted and be interviewed to explore these themes further, 
please include your name and email address in response to the final questions.
