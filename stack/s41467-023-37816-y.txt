Through syntax, i.e., the combination of words into larger phrases, language
can express a limitless number of messages. Data in great apes, our closest-
living relatives, are central to the reconstruction of syntax’s phylogenetic
origins, yet are currently lacking. Here, we provide evidence for syntactic-like
structuring in chimpanzee communication. Chimpanzees produce “alarm-
huus” when surprised and “waa-barks” when potentially recruiting con-
speciﬁcs during aggression or hunting. Anecdotal data suggested chimpan-
zees combine these calls speciﬁcally when encountering snakes. Using snake
presentations, we conﬁrm call combinations are produced when individuals
encounter snakes and ﬁnd that more individuals join the caller after hearing
the combination. To test the meaning-bearing nature of the call combination,
we use playbacks of artiﬁcially-constructed call combinations and both inde-
pendent calls. Chimpanzees react most strongly to call combinations, showing
longer looking responses, compared with both independent calls. We propose
the “alarm-huu + waa-bark” represents a compositional syntactic-like struc-
ture, where the meaning of the call combination is derived from the meaning
of its parts. Our work suggests that compositional structures may not have
evolved de novo in the human lineage, but that the cognitive building-blocks
facilitating syntax may have been present in our last common ancestor with
chimpanzees.
Human language is a highly productive communication system
whereby new meaning can be created syntactically through the com-
bination of existing meaning-bearing units (or words)1. Syntax can take
different forms that can be differentiated according to the semantic
relationship between the combination and the comprising units.
Combinatorial syntax2, for example, includes structures where the
meaning generated is independent from the meaning of the parts (e.g.,
idioms, “cry wolf”)2,3. Compositional syntax2, on the other hand, des-
ignates structures where the meaning of the whole is directly derived
from the meaning of the parts (e.g. “careful with the wolf”)2,3.
Compositional syntax can be further decomposed into various, more
speciﬁc, conﬁgurations such as predication (e.g., “the wolf howled”),
modiﬁcation (e.g., “black wolf”), or simple coordination (i.e. not
involving any dependencies, e.g. “wolf and dog”)3 (see ref. 3 for further
discussion). The communicative importance of syntax and its role in
the inﬁnite generative power of language is uncontroversial4. More
contentious debate surrounds its evolutionary origins, speciﬁcally
whether this trait is truly unique to our species’ communication
system3,5–7. An emerging body of observational and experimental data
has highlighted similar abilities in the primate lineage8–11, suggesting

the rudimentary capacity to sequence meaning-bearing vocal units
together, the core foundations of syntax3 (but see ref. 12,13), could
have emerged as early as in our last common ancestor with catarrhines
and platyrrhines around 45 million years ago14. For example, putty-
nosed monkeys combine two distinct calls referring to predators or
disturbances into a larger sequence that is produced in the context of
group movement. In this instance, the meaning of the combination
(/move/) is unrelated to the meaning of the comprising parts (/eagle/;
/disturbance/) and therefore represents a case of combinatorial
syntactic-like structuring in this species15. Furthermore, Campbell’s
monkeys afﬁx an “-oo” element onto the end of terrestrial and aerial
alarm calls which serves to modify the meaning of the alarm calls in a
predictable way such that they designate a less speciﬁc disturbance
but in the same physical space (i.e., on the ground or in the canopy)8,16.
Since the meaning of the combination appears to be directly related to
the meaning of the parts (/threat-type/ + /low-urgency/), this example
has been repeatedly interpreted as a rudimentary compositional
syntactic-like
structure8,17,18.
However,
equivalent
data
in
more
distantly-related species indicate syntax can evolve through con-
vergent evolution, ultimately complicating an evolutionary ancient
account of syntax in the primate lineage19–23. For instance, both pied
babblers and Japanese tits have been shown to combine an alarm call
with a recruitment call when encountering a threat that requires
recruitment22,23. These structures have also been argued to represent
rudimentary forms of compositional syntactic-like constructions
where the meaning of the whole is related to the meaning of the
comprising units (/threat/ + /come here/) akin to what has been termed
coordination in human language3,22,23. To disentangle whether syntactic
structuring of signal combinations is a convergent or homologous trait
within the primate lineage, comparable data in great apes are central.
Several observational studies have already documented combinations
of meaning-bearing units into larger structures in all four great ape
species: orangutans24, gorillas25,26, bonobos27–30 and chimpanzees31–33,
suggesting the potential for syntactic-like structuring in this clade.
Whilst promising, to date, no systematic experimental work, key to
demonstrating the syntactic-like nature of these structures, has been
conducted. In this study, we aimed to bridge this gap by experimen-
tally investigating whether wild chimpanzees produce meaningful
combinations of speciﬁc call types.
Chimpanzees produce “alarm-huus” (AH) when they are frigh-
tened or surprised (e.g., earth tremors, snakes, dead monkeys,
researcher’s waterproof cloaks34,35). Another important call type in this
species is the “waa-bark” (WB) which is produced in a range of social
and ecological contexts such as hunting, predator encounters, inter-
community encounters and aggression and has been argued to play a
role in recruiting individuals to the caller34,36–38. Critically, previous
work has shown that chimpanzees combine these two calls into the
“alarm-huu + waa bark” structure (AH-WB) at frequencies higher than
expected by chance33 and additionalnatural observations, though rare,
suggest chimpanzees do this when encountering a snake, speciﬁcally
when isolated from other individuals but still within earshot (N = 2
observations in 18 months, see Supplementary Note 1 for more details
and Fig. S1 for spectrograms of the calls). We hypothesized this call
combination might therefore function as a recruitment signal, parti-
cularly in dangerous situations, and potentially represent a composi-
tional syntactic-like structure, with the meaning of the whole
(recruitment to a threat) being a product of the meaning of its parts
(threat + recruitment) (see ref. 22,23 for similar combinations in birds).
We tested this hypothesis by presenting chimpanzees with model
snakes (see Methods) and examining call combination production.
Following presentations, we predicted more individuals in the audi-
ence would join the caller after the production of the call combination
compared to when no combinations are produced (see methods for
deﬁnition of joining individual). We also probed the function of the
“alarm-huu + waa-bark” combination and its syntactic-like nature by
conducting playback experiments, the gold standard for investigating
meaning attribution in animal vocalizations39. Speciﬁcally, we eval-
uated the responses of individuals to both singly-occurring calls (AH
and WB) to characterize their typical response to each call type alone,
and then compared these to the response to an artiﬁcial “alarm-
huu + waa-bark” combination (see Methods for more details). Here, we
predicted weak reactions from recipients to “alarm-huus” (i.e., long
latency and short time looking at the loudspeaker) since they convey
information regarding unspeciﬁc, non-urgent threats22. We predicted
stronger responses to the “waa-barks” (i.e., shorter latency but short
time looking at the loudspeaker) as it is a more abrupt intense
sounding call that is likely to attract the attention of the recipient
quickly, but may not evoke a long orientation response as the reason
for recruitment is unclear22. Finally, we predicted the strongest
responses to the call combination (short latency and long time looking
at the loudspeaker) since a threat requiring recruitment is more of an
urgent situation than recruitment alone (“waa-bark”) or warning of a
potential threat (“alarm-huu”).
Results
Presentation experiments
In line with naturalistic observations, snake presentations elicited
“alarm-huu + waa-bark” combinations. Speciﬁcally, in 9 out of 21 trials
(43%), an “alarm-huu + waa-bark” sequence was produced by the
subject within the ﬁrst two minutes after discovering the snake. In the
remaining trials (12/21; 57%), “alarm-huus” were consistently produced,
but never “waa-barks”.
We investigated whether the production of “alarm-huu + waa-
bark” call combinations inﬂuenced the number of individuals joining
the caller. Individuals joined the subject in 47% of trials (10/21), 90%
(9/10) of which were accompanied by the production of a call com-
bination by the subject. A GLMM with a Poisson family showed sig-
niﬁcantly more individuals joined subjects after the production of a
call combination (GLMMindividuals-recruited: ß ± SE = 3.7 ± 0.771; z = 4.798;
P < 0.001, see Fig. 1). Together, these results suggest that chimpanzees
appear to produce the “alarm-huu + waa-bark” call combination when
encountering snakes and its production is associated with the
recruitment of conspeciﬁcs.
However, there are a number of issues that these data in isolation
cannot adequately address. First, as we did not observe any snake

model encounters that elicited only “waa-barks” (i.e. without “alarm-
huus”), we cannot disentangle whether the recruitment of individuals
was a response to the call combination, or merely to the presence of
the “waa-bark” call. Secondly, in these naturalistic experiments, the
choice of listeners to approach the caller mayhave been inﬂuenced not
only by hearing the calls of the snake detector, but also by following
others who had already decided to join the caller. Investigating indi-
vidual responses to the call combination and its constituent parts in
the absence of other cues and behaviors from others is required to
address these issues. We thus conducted playback experiments,
comparing the response to the two singly-occurring calls (AH and WB)
with an artiﬁcially constructed “alarm-huu + waa-bark” combination.
Playback experiments
We performed playback experiments with lone individuals following a
within-subjects design to control for individual reactivity to con-
speciﬁc calls (Ntrials = 15, NAH-WB = 6, NAH = 5, NWB = 4; see below for
individual distribution). GLMMs highlighted that the looking duration
and latency to look towards the loudspeaker differed according to the
playback condition (GLMMlooking-duration: χ2 = 17.259, Df = 2, P < 0.001;
GLMMlatency-to-look: χ2 = 33.535, Df = 2, P < 0.001 respectively). Speciﬁ-
cally, the looking duration towards the loudspeaker was signiﬁcantly
longer for the combination compared to both singly-occurring calls
(see Table 1, Fig. 2a). Furthermore, the latency to look at the loud-
speaker was signiﬁcantly shorter in the WB and AH-WB conditions
compared to the AH condition, but did not differ between WB and AH-
WB (see Table 1, Fig. 2b). Regarding the frequency of looking towards
the loudspeaker, we found no effect of experimental condition on total
number of looks (GLMMnumber-of-looks: χ2 = 3.153, Df = 2, P = 0.21).
Bayesian mixed-effects models using multiple imputations to account
for uncertainty resulting from the three data points missing from our
within-subjects design validated these results (we aimed to test the 6
individuals in all three conditions, but could not complete 1 AH trial,
and 2 WB trials; see Methods, Tables S1–S3 and Figs. S2–S4 for more
details).
Since the “alarm-huu + waa-bark” combination represents a
longer stimulus than either of the individual comprising calls, any
difference in response to the playbacks (particularly in terms of look-
ing duration) could be simply driven by the increased salience of the
combination. If this was the case, in line with previous work22, we
expected the looking duration elicited by the combination to be purely
additive, i.e., equal to the sum of the looking durations to the indivi-
dual calls. However, we found no support for this hypothesis and
subjects instead responded in more than additive ways: the response
to the combination was signiﬁcantly greater than the combined
response to both singly-occurring calls (one-sample Wilcoxon signed
rank test: P = 0.028).
Furthermore, in 3/6 (50%) AH-WB playbacks, subjects approached
the loudspeaker (behavior that was not seen following any of the single
call playbacks), and in two of these instances, the subject was seen
engaging in typical snake anti-predator behavior, speciﬁcally climbing
up a tree and looking down towards the loudspeaker (see Supple-
mentary Movie 1). Although limited in terms of explanatory power,
these anecdotal observations support the idea that the response to the
“alarm-huu + waa-bark” sequence is more than just a combination of
responses to the comprising calls.
Together, these playback results suggest the call combination is
likely a concatenation of two independently occurring units which is
meaningful to receivers: subjects responded differently to the com-
bination than to single call types.
Discussion
Understanding the evolutionary roots of the ability to combine
meaning-bearing units together hinges on comparative data in our
closest-living relatives: the great apes40. Here we provide a unique set
of data combining natural observations, snake presentations and

independently occurring calls into a larger structure and, critically,
providing evidence that this call combination is meaningful to
receivers.
From a production perspective, natural observations supported
by snake presentations suggest the “alarm-huu + waa-bark” call com-
bination is emitted in a highly speciﬁc context, namely when a chim-
panzee encountersa snake, whilst the constituent calls are produced in
a wide range of situations (AH: potential threat; WB: general recruit-
ment). Thus, there is a possibility that the combination of calls may
offer more speciﬁc information to listeners than the constituent calls
can in isolation. From a comprehension perspective, both naturally
elicited combinations and experimentally presented ones suggested
receivers seem to extract a meaning from the combination since i)
more individuals joined the caller after the production of the combi-
nation and ii) playback of the combination elicited the strongest
responses from receivers (i.e., longest looking duration, shorter
latency to look compared to “alarm-huus”). Together, these results
suggest the “alarm-huu + waa-bark” functions as a recruitment signal
in a dangerous situation (similarly to what has been shown in birds, see
ref. 22,23).
Why should chimpanzees recruit conspeciﬁcs to a potential
threat? One explanation is that snakes represent a lethal danger to
chimpanzees, especially when undetected, which is very common due
to their highly cryptic appearance41. Recruiting conspeciﬁcs in this
situation might help chimpanzees encountering a snake ensure group
members in the surroundings are aware of both the presence of the
threat and its precise location. Indeed, a recent study has shown that
chimpanzees not only extract information from alarm call production
on the presence of a snake, but also infer the speciﬁc location of the
snake from the physical position of the signaler who orientates their
body to “mark” the snake to naive individuals41. This strategy seems to
be very effective given chimpanzees that join an individual that has
discovered a snake are not startled42. An alternative, non-mutually
exclusive explanation is that chimpanzees recruit individuals to the
threat to help drive it away, akin to mobbing behavior that has been
reported in a number of species as a mechanism to deter predators or
threats43,44.
Our ﬁndings reported here are also intriguing since they bear
striking resemblance with compositional syntactic structures, a core
hallmark of language, where the meaning of larger phrases is derived
from the meaning of the individual parts (e.g., /danger/ + /come here/).
Playback experiments conﬁrmed the meaning previously suggested for
each singly-occurring call: “alarm-huus” elicited comparatively weak
reactions from recipients (i.e., brief looks towards the loudspeaker, if at
all) which was expected for potential threats22 whilst “waa-barks” on the
other hand elicited stronger responses (i.e., shorter latency to look at
the loudspeaker) which once again was expected for recruitment calls22,
which are acoustically more attention-grabbing and often require a fast
response from the receiver (to aid a victim or potentially join a hunt37).
Finally, playback of the “alarm-huu + waa-bark” combination elicited
the strongest responses from the subjects (i.e., longest looking dura-
tion, shorter latency compared to “alarm-huus”). This stronger
response to the combination could be related to stimuli novelty: “alarm-
huu + waa-bark” combinations might be more arousing simply because
they are rare. This seems unlikely, however, as if this was the case,
“alarm-huus” would elicit stronger responses than “waa-barks” (given
the latter are much more frequently produced than the former in nat-
uralistic communication), which is not supported by our data. More-
over, individuals seemed to respond to the combination in a more than
additive way: responses to combinations exceeded the combined
responses to the individual calls. These results indicate receivers did not
simply respond to each call independently, but rather they seemed to
extract a speciﬁc meaning from the call combination (/recruitment to a
threat/) derived through combining the information encoded in both
individual calls (AH: potential threat; WB: recruitment).
It is important to note that the data presented here do not allow us
to disentangle which precise form of compositional syntax the “alarm-
huu + waa-bark” structure most resembles. One hypothesis is that this
structure represents a form of modiﬁcation with the “waa-bark”
directly modifying the level of urgency of the “alarm-huu” (i.e., from
/threat/ to /!THREAT!/), akin to how the “-oo” afﬁx modulates the stem
alarm calls in Campbell’s monkeys from labelling a speciﬁc urgent
threat to communicating a more general disturbance8,16. Alternatively,
the “alarm-huu + waa-bark” structure could be considered a more
simple coordination whereby listeners bind the meaning of the com-
prising calls (/threat/; /come here/), to arrive at a third different but
related meaning (/threat/ AND /come here/). Indeed, this interpretation
has been proposed for very similar ﬁndings in birds, for instance in
Japanese tits and pied babblers, who also combine a recruitment call
with an alarm call which elicits a stronger response in recipients than
either of the constituent calls3,22,23. Further experimental work could
help tease the hypotheses apart. For example, if the meaning of the
combination is conserved following reversal experiments, where the
naturally occurring call order is switched, a coordination analysis
might be favored since in this case /threat/ + /come here/ and /come
here/ + /threat/
would
be
communicating
qualitatively
similar
information.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings demonstrating the use and response to
a call combination in our closest-living relative, the chimpanzee, sug-
gest the foundations of syntax may be evolutionarily ancient and
present in more simple forms in the last common ancestor of chim-
panzees and humans. Furthermore, in conjunction with studies in
monkeys, this work tentatively indicates the evolutionary origins of
syntax might be traceable even further back, as far as 45 million years
ago when humans and monkeys last shared a common ancestor14.
Additional experimental work in other great ape species, especially in
the Pan genus, will help reconstruct the evolutionary roots of syntax
with an even greater degree of precision.
Methods
Ethical note
Ethical permission to conduct the study was received from the Animal
Welfare & Ethical Review Body from the University of Warwick, United
Kingdom (permit number: AWERB.35/18-19 and AWERB.01/19-20) and
was further approved by the Uganda Wildlife Authority (permit num-
ber: COD/96/05) and the Uganda National Council for Science and
Technology (permit number: NS47ES), Uganda.
To reduce to a minimum the impact on animals, we applied the
three Rs principle. Therefore, to investigate the production of the
“alarm-hoo + waa-bark” call combination, we analyzed snake pre-
sentation experiments conducted in 2010–11 for another study within
the Sonso community (see ref. 38). Additionally, when possible, we
extracted calls from the aforementioned snake presentations to gen-
erate the stimuli used for playback experiments. However, to accrue a
satisfactory number of stimuli, we also conducted additional snake
presentations. Finally, we conducted playback experiments on six
adult individuals only – i.e. minimum sample size to detect a signiﬁcant
effect, and reduced the number of conditions to the bare minimum
(i.e. three) to investigate whether receivers perceived the “alarm-
hoo + waa-bark” call combination as a syntactic-like structure.
Subject details
Study site. The study was conducted with the Sonso community of
chimpanzees at the Budongo Conservation Field Station (BCFS),
Budongo forest, Uganda (see Table S4 for the list of individuals). This
community has been habituated to humans’ presence since 199045.
Study subjects
Snake presentations. Snake presentations were conducted between
January 2010 and December 2011. In total, 13 individuals were exposed

males and ﬁve females, see ref. 38 for more details).
Playback
experiments.
Playback
experiments
were
conducted
between February 2019 and March 2022 for a total of 14 months. Six
well-habituated adult individuals that could be routinely followed
when alone were tested as subjects in playback experiments (one
female: KU and ﬁve males: FK, KT, MS, PS, ZL). In total, we conducted 15
trials on 6 different individuals (see Table 2).
Method details
Stimuli
Snake presentations. The snake model used was manufactured from
the skin of a dead python (Python sebae) donated by the Uganda
Wildlife Education center (see Fig. S5). A ﬁshing line was attached to
the head of the snake to allow us to move the model from a distance
(see ref. 38 for more details).
Playback experiments. The study consisted of three playback con-
ditions. To determine the typical response to the comprising singly-
occurring calls, we played back a single “alarm-huu” and a single
“waa-bark”. To investigate the function of the combination and
whether its meaning is derived from the meaning of its component
calls, we played back the combination of “alarm-huus” with “waa-
barks”. However, to ensure this call combination was truly a con-
catenation of the two calls produced independently (as opposed to a
third, independent signal), whilst simultaneously minimizing the
number of conditions chimpanzees were exposed to, we played back
an
artiﬁcially-constructed
combination
rather
than
a
natural
sequence (i.e. single “alarm-huu” + single “waa-bark”). Calls used as
playback stimuli were recorded during snake presentations in
2010–11
using
a
Sennheiser
ME67
microphone
and
Marantz
PCM661 solid state recorder (sample rate 44.1 kHz, resolution 32
bits,.wav format). However, to accrue a satisfactory number of
playback stimuli, we also conducted additional snake presentations
(3D printed, hand-painted snake resembling a Gaboon viper (Bitis
gabonica), see Fig. S6) in 2019 and recorded vocal responses using a
Sennheiser ME66/K6 microphone and Marantz PMD661 mk3 solid
state recorder. For the creation of playback stimuli, and to avoid
introducing a sex bias, we selected high signal-to-noise ratio vocali-
zations from males only (MS, PS, ZL). Playback stimuli were created
and normalized (in.wav format) using Adobe Audition (2015) by
applying the Root Mean Square criterium46,47. We constructed the
artiﬁcial combination by synthetically combining an “alarm-hoo”
with a “waa-bark”, both produced independently and originating
from the same individual, with a silence of 1 s between the two calls to
match naturally occurring “alarm-hoo + waa-bark” combinations
(mean ± S.E. = 1.06 ± 0.05 s). Furthermore, to ensure the calls soun-
ded realistic, we faded the background noise in and out to avoid the
playback from having an abrupt onset and offset respectively.
In line with previous work, to ensure playbacks sounded realistic
to the subject and could not be heard by the individual whose calls
were broadcasted (call provider) or other individuals, we sound-tested
all stimuli with a team of three experienced observers who conﬁrmed
the playback quality every 10 m from 0 to 50 m, and every 50 m from
50 to 400 m46,47. This allowed us to determine the optimal volume for
which the playback sounded realistic to the subject while being
inaudible by other individuals, primarily the call provider (at a mini-
mum distance of 300 m). During playback experiments, the call pro-
vider was located on average 1000 m (range 500–1600 m) from the
subject and was never observed to react to the playback (e.g., change
of behavior, looking/orient/move towards the loudspeaker).
Experimental design
Snake presentations. When a chimpanzee started travelling, one
experimenter (E1) followed the individual while another experimenter
(E2) moved ahead of this individual and hid the snake model under
leaves and branches on its anticipated path. E2 then moved away from
this location and concealed themselves from the arriving chimpanzee.
When the subject approached the location of the snake model, E2
pulled the string attached to the snake model causing its immediate
detection by the subject. E1 then monitored the reaction of the subject.
See ref. 38 for more details on the procedure.
Playback experiments. All playback stimuli were played back in.wav
format using a SanDisk Clip Sport Plus (www.westerndigital.com)
connected to a Mipro MA-707 loudspeaker (www.mipro.com). To
avoid habituation effects, the loudspeaker was concealed in a back-
pack (with only a hole cut into the fabric at the sound output level to
avoid sound distortion) so the chimpanzees never saw the equipment
in operation. Video recordings of trials were conducted using a Sony
Handycam HDR-CX240 or Panasonic HC-V777 video cameras.
The protocol implemented in this study followed a similar meth-
odology validated and used in previous work conducted in the same
community of chimpanzees46,47. Speciﬁcally, three people were
required to run the experiment to ensure aforementioned ethical and
realism criteria were met. Speciﬁcally, B.C. stayed with the subject who
received the playback, M.L. or C.W. played back the stimulus from the
loudspeaker at a distance of ~30 m from the subject, and a third person
(Denis Lomoro or Jackson Asua) followed the call provider. Contact
between the three experimenters was maintained throughout the
duration of the experiment using Motorola GP340 radios (www.
motorola.com) and Nokia 105 phones (www.nokia.com). Subjects were
initially chosen opportunistically, largely determined by which indivi-
duals were seen to isolate themselves. Trials across individuals were
counterbalanced, ensuring subjects did not hear conditions in the
same order, thus controlling for order effects. To avoid overexposure
for chimpanzees and limit the risk of habituation, we waited a mini-
mum of one day in between two trials from different subjects (average
27 days, range 1–104 days) and at least a week in between two trials
with the same subject (average 90 days, range 28–244 days). Fur-
thermore, we ensured that over the whole study period, no chimpan-
zee heard the same stimulus twice. Therefore, for a given subject, the
call provider in the singly-occurring call conditions (AH and WB) was
necessarily distinct from the call provider in the combination condi-
tion (AH-WB). Playbacks occurred between 0700 and 1600 h, typically
around 1100 h.
We considered starting an experiment when (i) the subject was
observed resting on the ground (to avoid potential bias due to the
behavior/position prior to the experiment), (ii) the call provider was at
least 300 m away from the subject (to ensure it did not hear its own call
being broadcasted) and (iii) no other individuals were present within a
300 m radius (to avoid potential audience effect bias and ensure
potential future subjects did not hear the stimulus twice). If these
conditions were met, B.C. started ﬁlming the subject while M.L. or C.W.

took an indirect route to a location of ~30 m from the subject in the
direction of the call provider (established through maintaining contact
with D.L. or J.A.). The loudspeaker was placed out of sight of the focal
subject and oriented towards it. We played the stimuli only when the
subject (i) rested for at least 2 min, (ii) was clearly visible to B.C., and
(iii) did not face towards the direction of the loudspeaker, so we could
detect any looks oriented towards the loudspeaker. Due to the highly
demanding procedure, several trials started without reaching com-
pletion and broadcasting of the stimuli, hence representing “mock”
experiments allowing us to further reduce the risk of habituation.
When all these additional conditions were met, M.L. or C.W. played the
stimulus and B.C. video-recorded and commented the reaction from
the subject, focusing speciﬁcally on the looking behavior of the
chimpanzee. Finally, once a playback was completed, B.C. and M.L. or
C.W. followed the subject for the rest of the day to monitor any mid- to
long-term effects on the subject. No indications of stress or fear were
observed from the subjects after the experiments or upon reunion
with other individuals, including the call provider.
Statistical analysis
Data processing
Snake presentations. Video footage was analyzed using Boris48. For
each trial, we noted whether the focal individual produced an “alarm-
huu + waa-bark” combination. In line with previous work in great apes,
a maximum time interval of ≤2 s between two calls was used to deﬁne a
call combination25,26,31,32. We then recorded the number of individuals
recruited in the two minutes after the snake was discovered. An indi-
vidual was “recruited” when they came in the direct vicinity of the
caller post-snake discovery (< 15 m). We excluded all trials for which we
could not conﬁdently document the aforementioned variables,
resulting in the analysis of 21/27 trials.
Playback experiments. Video recordings were analyzed frame-by-
frame using Boris48. Based on previous work46,47, we noted for each trial
the following behaviors from the subject:
(1)
The number of looks in the direction of the loudspeaker in the
2 min after the playback, with looking direction determined by
head orientation.
(2)
The looking duration towards the loudspeaker in the 2 min after
the playback.
(3)
The latency of the ﬁrst look towards the loudspeaker after the
start of the playback.
Furthermore, to ensure the coding of the videos was reliable, C.W.
blind coded a randomly chosen sample of 5 trials (33%), which were
also coded by M.L. The mean intra-class correlation coefﬁcient for the
three variables outlined above was found to be 1.00, indicating
excellent levels of coder agreement49.
Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were implemented in R.
GLMMs were conducted using the lme4 and glmmTMB packages50. We
checked model assumptions using the DHARMa package51.
Snake presentations. A generalized linear mixed-effects model
(GLMM) was used to investigate the inﬂuence of the production of
“alarm-huu + waa-bark” combinations (1/0) on the number of indivi-
duals recruited at the snake (GLMMindividuals-recruited, poisson family).
To control for repeated measures at the individual level and for the
effect of experimental condition set in the initial study from which
these data were extracted (i.e., alone, back, front; see ref. 38 for more
details), we ﬁtted ID and condition as random factors respectively.
Playback experiments. To investigate differences between playback
conditions, we implemented a GLMM for each variable, with playback
condition as the explanatory variable (AH/WB/AH-WB) and as a
response variable: (i) the number of looks (GLMMnumber-of-looks,
negative-binomial family), (ii) looking duration (GLMMlooking-duration,
gamma family) and (iii) latency to look (GLMMlatency-to-look, gamma
family) respectively. To control for the independence of the variables
tested, we checked for multicollinearity using the VIF function (all
VIFs = ~1, indicating independence52). Furthermore, to control for
repeated measures at the individual level, we ﬁtted ID as a random
effect for each model. When a model was statistically signiﬁcant, we
performed post hoc analyses using Tukey tests to investigate differ-
ences between conditions. Finally, we ran Bayesian analyses using
multiple imputations as an alternative from a frequentist approach to
account for the smallsample size and the unbalanced data set resulting
from the three missing data points (MSAH, KUWB and KTWB). Indeed,
the missing data may bias our conclusions if they are not random. For
example, if the individuals that were not tested tend to have very
strong or weak responses to playbacks generally, we may ﬁnd treat-
ment effects simply because strong/weak reactors were absent in
certain conditions. To investigate whether the results of the frequen-
tist mixed models were robust against such biases, we used multiple
imputation combined with Bayesian modelling. This approach not
only allowed us to account for the missing data, but also the uncer-
tainty induced by missingness. To this end, we created 50 complete /
balanced data sets using multiple mean matching to impute the 3
missing data points (using the mice function of the mice package in
R53). We then ﬁtted a model using Bayesian inference to each of the 50
complete data sets (using the same model structure as in the fre-
quentist analyses), and pooled results across all 50 sub-models by
combining posterior draws from all sub-models using the brm_multi-
ple function in the brms package in R54,55. Each sub-model was run with
four independent Markov chains of 10,000 iterations, discarding the
ﬁrst 5000 as a warm-up for a total of 20,000 draws per sub-model and
1 million draws across the 50 sub-models. We used default weakly
informative priors for the model parameters. Reported point estimates
and 95% credible intervals were calculated based on the posteriors
draws across all 50 sub-models (thus reﬂecting uncertainty in the
missing data). All Bayesian models conﬁrmed the results from the
frequentist approach (speciﬁcally biological interpretations can be
