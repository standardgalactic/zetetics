PVNet: A LRCN Architecture for Spatio-Temporal Photovoltaic Power
Forecasting from Numerical Weather Prediction

Abstract
Photovoltaic (PV) power generation has emerged
as one of the lead renewable energy sources. Yet,
its production is characterized by high uncertainty,
being dependent on weather conditions like solar
irradiance and temperature. Predicting PV pro-
duction, even in the 24-hour forecast, remains a
challenge and leads energy providers to left idling
- often carbon emitting - plants. In this paper, we
introduce a Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional
Network using Numerical Weather Predictions
(NWP) to predict, in turn, PV production in the
24-hour and 48-hour forecast horizons. This net-
work architecture fully leverages both temporal
and spatial weather data, sampled over the whole
geographical area of interest. We train our model
on an NWP dataset from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to predict
spatially aggregated PV production in Germany.
We compare its performance to the persistence
model and state-of-the-art methods.
1. Introduction
As of early 2019, 184 out of 197 Parties have ratiﬁed the
Paris Agreement, which was negotiated at the 21st Confer-
ence of the Parties (COP21) to reduce the risks and effects
of climate change. These signatures show a world-wide
awareness of global warming issues and a commitment to
planning initiatives that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
Countries are taking actions to better integrate renewable
clean energies into their grids.
Solar photovoltaic (PV) production is one of the most popu-
lar renewable energy sources. According to the International
Agency of Energy (IAE) 1, cumulative solar PV capacity
reached almost 398 GW in 2017, representing around 2%

of global power output. Furthermore, solar PV is expected
to lead renewable electricity capacity growth, increasing to
over 1000 GW by 2023.
Integrating solar PV production into the energy grids re-
quires an accurate and reliable forecast of the PV power, in
order to guarantee the optimal management of energy de-
mand and supply. Accurate PV power forecasting remains a
challenge as the PV output depends on ﬂuctuating weather
conditions, like solar irradiance or other meteorological
factors (Li et al., 2016a).
1.1. Related Works
Many studies have tackled the challenge of PV power fore-
cast. They rely on statistical time-series methods, phys-
ical methods, or ensemble methods which combine dif-
ferent models to enhance accuracy (Sobri et al., 2018).
Widely used time-series models can be separated into two
groups: linear and non-linear models. Linear time-series
models used in PV forecast include the combination of auto-
regressive models (AR) with moving average models (MA)
into auto-regressive moving average models (ARMA) (Li
et al., 2014; Kardakos et al., 2013). While linear models
are usually more transparent towards their feature selec-
tion, non-linear models often show better prediction accu-
racy when enough data are available. Among non-linear
time-series models, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) have
become increasingly popular for PV forecast (Ding et al.,
2011; Kardakos et al., 2013; Dolara et al., 2015) and among
them Recurrent Neural Networks (Malvoni et al., 2013)
and Long-Short Term Memory Networks (Abdel-Nasser &
Mahmoud, 2017; Gensler et al., 2017). We note that ANN
models can be interpreted as a non-linear version of AR,
also called NAR, while Recurrent Neural Networks can be
seen as a type of non-linear ARMA, also called NARMA.
The most successful methods among the ones mentioned
above are models adding Numerical Weather Prediction
(NWP) like predictions of solar irradiance or temperature
into the time-series approach. They may also include analyti-
cal physical model outputs, like atmospheric models and sev-
eral types of Clear Sky Models (Inman et al., 2013). NWP
can be obtained from the European Centre for Medium-

PVNet: LRCN for Spatio-Temporal PV Forecast from NWP
Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 2 and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 3. Clear
Sky Models and additional physical models are provided by
open-source libraries (Holmgren et al., 2018). Time-series
models including these additional inputs are referred to as
ARMA model with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) for the lin-
ear versions (Kardakos et al., 2013) or NAR with exogenous
inputs (NARX) (Di Piazza et al., 2016) as well as Artiﬁcial
Neural Networks with multiple inputs (Malvoni et al., 2013;
Dolara et al., 2015; Hossain et al., 2018; Oneto et al., 2018).
Adding NWP and physical model inputs to time-series mod-
els show better forecast prediction, yet limited computa-
tional resources as well as dataset sizes often prohibit studies
to integrate an exhaustive list of these variables, especially
in non-linear models. Instead, the impact of the variables
is assessed by independent experiments (Kardakos et al.,
2013) of by ﬁtting regression models like multi-regression
analyses (Malvoni et al., 2013) or multivariate adaptive re-
gression splines (Li et al., 2016a). Eventually, a subset of
the variables may be selected for prediction. These variable
selection analyses are conducted at speciﬁc locations, at four
PV plants in Greece (Kardakos et al., 2013), one PV plant
in Southern Italy (Malvoni et al., 2013) and in Macau (Li
et al., 2016b), while the variables impact on the prediction
is likely to be location-dependent.
In this paper, we present a method that takes into account the
spatial distribution of the input variables, to simultaneously
increase the model’s inference capacity - an understanding
of which inputs variables are essential at which geographic
locations - as well as the model’s prediction accuracy. In the
above studies, the spatial distribution of the NWP and phys-
ical models variables are not taken into account: models
focus for example on solar irradiance or temperature only
at the speciﬁc location of the target plant. The time-series
and neural network architectures often model the tempo-
ral structure of the variables, not their spatial structure and
initiatives to incorporate spatial information are often re-
stricted to sparse data at neighboring plants for example
(Gutierrez-Corea et al., 2016; Agoua et al., 2018). Yet,
weather variables and physical model outputs on the zone
surrounding a target plant are additional data, especially
valuable while ﬁtting non-linear ﬂexible models, that can
be integrated into the input data for higher accuracy. To
the best of our knowledge, no model fully integrates both
temporal and dense spatial numerical weather predictions
and physical models outputs in PV forecasting.
Meanwhile, ﬂexible non-linear predictions models tak-
ing into account the spatiotemporal structure of the data,
like Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN)
(Donahue et al., 2015), 2D LSTM or Convolutional LSTM

architectures (ConvLSTM) (Shi et al., 2015), have been suc-
cessfully applied to a variety of problems. LRCN models
have been used in activity recognition, image captioning
and visual question answering (Donahue et al., 2015). A
2D LSTM model has been applied to trafﬁc forecasting
(Zhao et al., 2017) while a ConvLSTM has shown promis-
ing results on a precipitation forecast that predicts rainfall
intensity in a local region on a short time horizon (Shi et al.,
2015) (also known as nowcasting), a weather-related predic-
tion problem that shares similarities with PV forecast.
1.2. Contributions and Outline
This paper presents PVNet, a PV forecasting model that
introduces a LRCN architecture to integrate past PV power
1D time-series with dense spatiotemporal NWP and physical
models’ inputs. Our model extends the state-of-the-art 1D
time-series models by learning spatial features with CNN
modules, whose channels encode the NWP and physical
models variables. We focus our analysis on the day-ahead
PV forecast, whose accuracy is known to be highly depen-
dent on NWP integration, and which is particularly interest-
ing as energy market bids are placed one day in advance.
Our experimental results show that our architecture man-
ages to leverage these additional spatial data for prediction
accuracy. We train a highly non-linear prediction model that
reaches a high accuracy on our validation dataset. Further-
more, our model provides a location-dependent assessment
of the impact of the different input variables, through an
occlusion sensitivity analysis that shows a strong inference
capability.
In Section 2, we describe the data representation used for
the PV power output and the NWP and physical models
variables. We then present our spatiotemporal LRCN model
PVNet, with its CNN and LSTM modules. Section 5 de-
scribes our experimental studies and accuracy results, as
well as the results of the occlusion sensitivity analysis that
validates our spatiotemporal approach.
2. Data Representation
2.1. Photovoltaic Panel
A photovoltaic solar panel, also called photovoltaic module,
is a device that absorbs sunlight as a source of energy to
generate electricity. We are interested in the power output
produced by the module, which is a time series that depends
on weather conditions, see Figure 2.
There are different ways to model the solar panel produc-
tion from external factors, one of which is the equivalent
electrical circuit of a solar cell is composed of a diode, a
resistor in series and in parallel as shown in see Figure 1 4).

With k the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature

Thus the output power produced by the module obviously
depends on solar irradiance, but also on its temperature
(Fesharaki et al., 2011).

Furthermore, recent experimental research suggests that a
module’s temperature is related to numerical weather data
such as the ambient temperature, the local irradiance and
wind speed. (Muzathik, 2014):
Tm(◦C) = 0.94T + 0.02I −1.5S + 0.35
(5)
where Tm is the module’s temperature, T is the ambient
temperature, I is the solar irradiance and S the wind speed.
However, this model essentially comes from an heuristic
and there are likely more weather data - and their non-linear
relationships - that could be taken into account to fully
characterize the module’s temperature and hence, its power
output.
We just showed that the behavior of a photovoltaic panel is
both non linear because of its semi-conductor nature and
also dependant on the temperature of the panel. Temperature
which is itself dependant on external factors like external
temperature and windspeed which are available and forecast
through numerical services.
2.2. Numerical Weather Predictions
We incorporate weather prediction data as well as their
non-linear relationships in our model. Rather than just in-
corporating the irradiance and temperature at the speciﬁc

location of the power plant(s), our model aims to leverage
the full spatial scalar ﬁelds of the meteorological parame-
ters over the whole area of interest. These forecasts can be
obtained from global forecast systems, like the ECMWF
HRES model (temporal resolution of 1 hour and spatial
resolution of 0.1 degree) 5 or the NOAA GFS 6 (temporal
resolution of 3 hours and spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees).
Each of these models provides a set of weather-related vari-
ables.
Figure 3 shows examples of variables of interest, in this case
over our country of interest Germany.

where t is the time, measured in hours from the current
time, (x, y) is the longitude-latitude coordinates of a point
in the region of interest, and K is the number meteorological
factors of interests.
We chose this set of weather features after investigating the
intersection of various available data in the NWP forecast
datasets and the current state of the art for the impact of
the variables affecting the irradiance (here cloud cover and
irradiance) and the performance of the solar panel (here
outside temperature).
2.3. Incorporation of Standard Models Predictions
We also incorporate predictions of standard forecast models
into our feature vector. We consider ﬁrst the persistence
model, a simple - yet popular - forecast model. The per-
sistence model predicts that future PV output is likely to
be similar as the current value at the same time of the day
(Cornaro et al., 2015). We denote with the subscript PSS,
the PV output predicted by a persistence model:
XPSS(x, y, t) = Ppv(t −Tp)
(7)
where time Tp is measured in hours, and (x, y) the longitude-
latitude coordinates. Here we take two speciﬁc values of
persistence. One will be used for comparing the perfor-
mance of the algorithm at T24 and the one we use as a
feature of our algorithm is at T48. Indeed when used in the
context of energy forecast, there is a 24 hours delay, as seen
in ﬁgure 5.
A clear sky model estimates irradiance under the assumption
that there are no clouds in the sky (Reno et al.). This is a
function of the altitude, location, and various atmospheric
conditions. The irradiance predicted by the clear sky model
is:
XCSM,t(x, y) = CSM(t, x, y, α(t, x, y))
(8)
where t is the time, measured in hours from the current time,
(x, y) is the longitude-latitude coordinates of a point in the
region of interest and α is a set of external variables used
for the Clear Sky Model.
Speciﬁcally, we form a feature at time t, Xt by aggregating
the weather forecast variables with the predictions of the
standard models:
Xt(x, y) =


XNWP,t(x, y)
XPSS,t
XCSM,t(x, y)

∈RK+2
(9)
where t is the time, measured in hours from the current time,
(x, y) is the longitude-latitude coordinates of a point in the
region of interest. thus, our feature vector incorporates both
spatial weather forecasts as well as some predictions from
existing models.
3. PVNet Model
The goal of PV power output forecasting is to use numerical
weather predictions, to forecast the future PV output in a
region, in our case: at the day ahead forecast at the scale of
a country. We consider t = 0 the time at which we make
the prediction, and thus tforecast = 24h is the forecast time.
Precisely, we consider a sliding window of size T, and:
(Xt1, ..., XtT )
(10)
where Xt is the feature maps at time t, as deﬁned in Equa-
tion 9 and tT = tforecast. Our goal is to predict:
d
Ppv(tT ),
an
estimate
of
the
PV
production
at
the
fore-
cast horizon.
Our training set is thus a set of
((Xt0+t1, ..., Xt0+tT ) , Ppv(t0 + tT ))t0
for
different
values of t0.
Our model presents a long term recurrent convolutional net-
work which combines a convolutional network (CNN) and
a bi-directional long short term memory (LSTM) (Schuster
& Paliwal, 1997) network, as shown in Figure 6. In practice,
we use a time window of T = 8 values, spread at 3 hours
time interval, so as to represent a window that is a full day
of data history.

3.1. The CNN Module
The model applies a convolutional neural network to each
T images Xt of shape (width, height) and K + 2 number
of channels. This results into a feature vector of dimension
(T, d):
(xt1, ..., xtT ) = (g(Xt1), ..., g(XtT ))
(11)
where each xt is now a feature vector of dimension d. We
use one single CNN architecture, and a single set of weights,
to transform the feature Xt, independently of the time t.
Therefore, this feature transformation step can be described
by a single function g.
We use the CNN module to encode the spatial data into a
new feature vector of lower dimension as running the LSTM
directly on the whole images would be too computationally
expensive. Rather than hand-crafting spatially aggregated
features, we let the CNN learn spatial features that are the
most relevant for the following LSTM-based PV power
predictions.
3.2. The LSTM Module
Each of the feature tensor is then fed into an LSTM (Hochre-
iter & Schmidhuber, 1997) network, to incorporate the time-
series information. A LSTM network is a special case of
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which introduces a mem-
ory cell ct, that serves as an accumulator of state informa-
tion. The cell ct can be accessed, written and cleared by
self-parameterized controlling gates. If the input gate it
is activated, the information of each new input, that is our
feature vector xt, is accumulated to the cell. If the forget
gate ft is activated, the previous cell status ct−1 can be
forgotten. The output gate ot controls if the cell output ct
will be propagated to the ﬁnal state ht. The model can be
summarized with the following equations:
ft = σg(Wfxt + Ufht−1 + bf)
it = σg(Wixt + Uiht−1 + bi)
ot = σg(Woxt + Uoht−1 + bo)
ct = ft ◦ct−1 + it ◦σc(Wcxt + Ucht−1 + bc)
ht = ot ◦σh(ct)
(12)
One of the limitations of the LSTM is that any hidden layer
associated with a timestep t only has access to past data.
Bidirectional RNNs (Schuster & Paliwal, 1997) have shown
to be more efﬁcient in natural language processing tasks
(Arisoy et al., 2015). The following equations show how
the RNN takes into account past and future data:
−→
ht = f(−→
Wxt + −→
V −−→
ht−1 + −→b )
←−
ht = f(←−
Wxt + ←−
V ←−−
ht+1 + ←−b )
ˆyt = g(Uht + c) = g(U[−→
ht; ←−
ht] + c)
(13)
The intent of the BiLSTM module is to design features, at
each time t that take into account the temporal structure of
the input signal.
3.3. Full Model
The convolutional network extracts spatial features (in our
case spatial weather related features) and then forwards
them to the LSTM. We then have a fully connected layer
taking all the LSTM hidden outputs and producing a single
scalar value that is the estimated value of aggregated PV
output prediction for the whole country.
We highlight that this model differs from the ConvLSTM
model from (Shi et al., 2015), in the sense that the ConvL-
STM model integrates convolutional structures directly in
the LSTM cells.
Both CNN and LSTM modules are trained simultaneously,
to minimize the mean squared error loss function:

3.4. Implementation Details
We implement PVNet using the Tensorﬂow (Abadi et al.)
framework. Our convolutional networks are built alternat-
ing 2D convolution layers, PReLu activations (He et al.),
dropout and max pooling.

There is also a 20% dropout after each convolutional layer.
We added a fully connected layer between the CNN layers
and the LSTM, with a 30% dropout in between.
In this implementation, we use the hard sigmoid for the
recurrent activation and the hyperbolic tangent for the acti-
vation itself.

4. Dataset
We consider an aggregated production of PV power across
Germany. We gather past data from 2014 to 2018, sampled
at a time resolution of 15 minutes.
We use numerical weather prediction data from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, more speciﬁcally
the Global Forecast System (GFS). This data is freely avail-
able, has a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees of latitude and
longitude and a time resolution of 3 hours. The time res-
olution of the PV power is downsampled at 3h, to match
the time resolution of the NWP. We consider K = 3 mete-
orological variables: Downward short wave radiation ﬂux
(DSWRF), Cloud Cover (EACC) and Temperature (TMP).
We incorporate data from the persistence model and the
Clear Sky Model.
4.1. Time Alignment
Time alignment is critical for efﬁcient training. When ﬁrst
looking at the GFS data one has to be careful about time
shifts. The persistence data included in the model is not the
one used to evaluate the performance of the model. Indeed
in a production setting one only has access to the data from
the day before. This means that we can only use persistence
data from 48 hours before the point to estimate, whereas the
actual persistence metrics is done 24 hours before.
4.2. Training and Validation Split
We split the training and validation dataset as follows: ﬁrst
3 years for training and the last year for validation. This
approach guarantees that our validation score is not affected
by seasonal patterns. Indeed, the duration of the day is very
different between the summer and the winter solstice, per-
formance measures could be affected without this speciﬁc
care.
5. Experiments and Results
We run our experiments on a computer with a single
NVIDIA Titan X GPU. The training time of the network
is 5 hours. We train our model using the Adam optimizer
(Kingma & Ba, 2014), with a learning rate of 0.0015 and
a batch size of 32. We run our training for a total of 500
epochs, as shown in Figure 7.
5.1. Metrics and Results
We use two metrics to evaluate the quality of PVNet: the
root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error
(MAE) of the prediction. We compute these metrics only
when the measured and predicted power is higher than 0
(PP V (t) > 0). We do not take nights into accounts because
these values tend to increase the performance since the

estimator of the PV night is
ˆ
PP V (t) = 0 The normalized
RMSE and MAE (nRMSE and nMAE) are normalized with
the country-wide PV capacity, which is 41.2 GW in our
case.
Tables 1 and 2 present our results for PVNet compared
to the persistence model and the current state of the art
for day ahead country wide PV prediction (Lorenz et al.,
2011). (Lorenz et al., 2011) used data from 2009-2010
and a different formulation of the nRMSE. The authors of
(Lorenz et al., 2011) indeed normalized the production on
a per plant basis while we normalize it at the scale of the
whole country. We re-implement their method in order to
compute the metrics MAE, nMAE, RMSE and nRMSE for
the same times as the ones used in our validation dataset.

We compute the persistence model RMSE by taking the
value of the country-aggregated prediction 24 hours before
the current value. We ﬁrst observe an RMSE improvement
of 17.31 percents compared to the persistence model, which
is expected since the persistence model is relatively naive.
We do also use the persistence data in our model as one
of the inputs - even though the timing is quite different.
We use 24 hours persistence for veriﬁcation and 48 hours
persistence as the PVNet input layer.
We also observe a 1.38% decrease in accuracy error in
nRMSE and a 0.74% decrease in accuracy error in nMAE
compared to state of the art in the country-wide day ahead
aggregation (Lorenz et al., 2011). Non-linear spatiotem-
poral features are being captured in much more details in
PVNet, allowing better overall performance.
5.2. Occlusion Sensitivity Analysis
One of the main interests of this model is to build a spatial
representation of the impact of various variables (weather,
clear sky model and persistence) on the aggregated PV pro-
duction. One way to verify if this is the case is to perform
a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the spatial impact of each
variable.
This type of analysis has been shown to work well in the
case of deep neural networks (Zeiler & Fergus, 2013).
We perform an occlusion sensitivity analysis by setting the
values of a patch to a ﬁxed value and recording the changes
in value of the predicted power prediction. We perform this
analysis for each channel and aggregated the values in a
heatmap form. We then overlay this heatmap with the map
of Germany and we obtain the results as shown in 8. The
results show that our network sees the biggest impact with
irradiance, followed by cloud cover, clear sky, persistence
and ﬁnally temperature.
In order to compare the results of the sensitivity analysis we
build a heatmap representing the distribution of PV power
generated across Germany on May 1st, 2016. We aggregate
the nominal capacity of the plants on a spatial grid of 0.25×
0.25 degrees by summing all maximum plant power on
this area. We overlay this heatmap with Germany country
boundaries for more clarity (see ﬁgure 9). This shows that
the south/east of Germany produces more power per squared
meter, which is consistent with the results of our occlusion
map. Indeed most of the metrics in the sensitivity maps
(ﬁgure 8) show higher incidence in the south west.
This sensitivity analysis also shows which input features
have the biggest impact on the outputs. Indeed we that in
order or decreasing importance, the values are irradiance,
followed by cloud cover, the clear sky channel and ﬁnally
Persistence and Temperature. This analysis also gives us a
good insight about PVNet - looking at these two ﬁgures we
can conclude that applying PV net and a Sensitivity analysis
can be used to learn an estimate of the surface density of PV
power production for a given area.

6. Conclusion and Future Work
Global warming and the current energy crisis are both call-
ing for the integration of renewable energies, including solar
PV energy, into countries power grids. Such integration
is still limited by our ability in making reliable PV power
forecast. Accurate PV forecast remains challenging because
of its correlation with highly ﬂuctuating weather variables.
This paper introduced PVNet, a country-wide PV forecast
model that fully integrates 1D time-series of past PV power
with dense spatiotemporal exogenous inputs. Speciﬁcally,
PVNet leverages an LRCN architecture that tackles spa-
tiotemporal regression problems using numerical weather
predictions and physical models as additional inputs. The
model enjoys good performances in terms of prediction. Our
results show a decrease in nRMSE of 1.38% compared to
the state-of-the-art model for country-aggregated PV output
prediction.
This LRCN model also demonstrates inference capability.
NWP variables and physical models inputs have intricate
and location-dependent correlations with PV power output.
We showed that the CNN modules of the LRCN model can
learn the geographic impact of different meteorological fac-

tors on the PV power prediction. Our occlusion sensitivity
analysis validates our dense spatial approach and also allows
us to better understand the dominant features as a function
of location. It provides an interesting visualization tool for
energy providers to estimate the effect of several weather
variables of their PV power output. We also show that com-
bining PVNet and a Sensitivity analysis can be used to learn
an estimate of the surface density of PV power production
for a given area.
Future work will involve reﬁnements of the current model,
introducing for example interpolation of NWP inputs in
order to avoid temporal down-sampling and data loss. Then,
we will build on the LRCN architecture by incorporating
new spatial information, like satellite imagery or ﬁsh-eye
data imagery. A reliable PV forecast thus relies on models
that fully leverage the available geographical data. With
this work, we aim to open the doors to more spatiotemporal
methods in PV output forecasting. The objective of such
models is to enable a secure and economic integration of
PV power into smart energy grids of countries over the
world. This leads, in turn, to an increase in the proportion of
renewable clean energies in the world’s energy consumption.
