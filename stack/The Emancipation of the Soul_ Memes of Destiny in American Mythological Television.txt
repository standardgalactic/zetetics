MEMES OF DESTINY IN AMERICAN MYTHOLOGICAL TELEVISION
THE EMANCIPATION OF THE SOUL
LANG

Philipp Kneis studied American Studies and History at Humboldt-
Universität zu Berlin. His research concerns American film and televi-
sion, politics, Native American Studies and aging. Together with Antje 
Dallmann and Reinhard Isensee he has published Picturing America. 
Trauma, Realism, Poli tics and Identity in American Visual Culture (Peter 
Lang, 2007) and Envisioning American Utopias. Fictions of Science and 
Politics in Literature and Visual Culture (Peter Lang, 2010).
This book analyzes the mythological content of five television franchises 
within the genre of science fiction, fantasy and horror: The X-Files & 
Millennium, Babylon 5 & Crusade, Buffy the Vampire Slayer & Angel, 
Stargate and Star Trek. The central themes are errand into the wilderness, 
emancipation from larger powers, individual responsibility, prophecy, 
apocalyptic scenarios, fundamentalism, artificial intelligence, as well as 
hybridity, gender roles, psychotic narration, and others. The theoretical 
basis for this work are both a conventional cultural studies perspective 
as well as memetics, an evolutionary perspective of culture and literature 
that is utilized in this volume as an approach to studying genre at the 
example of the five case studies.

FOREWORD BY REINHARD ISENSEE 
 
Since the 1990, numerous studies on American television have addressed various 
aspects constitutive of TV from particular thematic angles and theoretical ap-
proaches. The abundance of these studies speak to the richness of the medium it-
self and the productivity as well as the legitimacy of exploring American TV in 
terms of understanding the shifting configurations of contemporary U.S. culture.  
In light of such an abundance the question arises what yet another study can 
accomplish what has not been covered by the vast body of existing texts. Besides 
exploring innovative formats or controversial themes a new study, among other 
things, would certainly have to address aspects understudied hitherto from a fresh 
perspective. 
It is such a perspective that Philipp Kneis offers in his book The Emancipation 
of the Soul. Memes of Destiny in American Mythological Television, which is based on his 
Master Thesis completed at the American Studies Program at Humboldt- Univer-
sität zu Berlin.   
Not only does he provide an in-depth discussion of Science Fiction as a dis-
tinct TV genre, but –– more importantly –– he also engages in a reading of TV fic-
tions that posits them in a rich cultural context and interdisciplinary conceptual 
framework. What unfolds in the course of his discussion is a systematic re-
evaluation of a TV genre that has increasingly shaped current cultural imaginaries in 
the United States and beyond. In an effort to uncover the political and social un-
derpinnings of these imaginaries the study presents a dialogical reading of themes 
and tropes through the lens of philosophies of cultural evolution.         
Employing a memetic approach to culture derived from British scientist Ri-
chard Dawkins’ concept first introduced in his The Selfish Gene (1976) as well as 
from studies on the role of religion in/and science by Christopher Hitchens (2007) 
and Carl Sagan (1996), Philipp Kneis investigates visual fictions both in terms of 
the relevance of memes as a cultural paradigm of explanation and the productivity 
of memes as a category of analysis. Establishing memes as cultural analogues to 
genes, Dawkins defines memes as units of cultural ideas, symbols or practices, 
which can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, ges-
tures, rituals or other forms of imitation. 
In transposing Dawkins’ concept to TV in general and the Science Fiction ge-
nre in particular, Philipp Kneis introduces a new venue to discuss the production 
of cultural meaning in visual representations as fictional constructions of the com-
plexities of mythological notions informing both individual and social behavior. 

10 
The Emancipation of the Soul 
 
The study is structured into three major parts that address the theoretical and 
thematic as well as narrative dimensions of what the author conceptualizes as memes 
of destiny. While Part One unfolds the imbricated relationship of myths and memes 
and thus provides the theoretical foundations of the study, Part Two offers a close 
reading of prominent American Science Fiction Series such as The X-Files, Millen-
nium, Babylon 5, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Stargate: SG-1, Stargate: Atlantis, and Star 
Trek. In a subsequent step, Part Three offers an analysis of the recurring patterns 
and thematic elements (or memes) in terms of the cultural imaginaries about 
(American) society projected in the respective TV fictions. The concluding discus-
sion in this part problematizes the findings of the study in relation to the impact of 
the cultural works of TV on the Emancipation of the Soul.   
What the book accomplishes in the end is a thought-provoking re-evaluation 
of central constituents of the American cultural imagination and national narratives 
as they play out in American TV fictions: religion and Christianity, the wilderness 
and free will, individualism and community figure as the (memetic) key elements in 
these re-visions of (future) societies that inform and shape the cultural mythologies 
about human existence –– now and then.   
I encourage the reader then most emphatically to join the author of this book 
in the journey to future worlds enacted in the fictions of TV to discover the rich 
and  astounding visions of societies that seem so far away and yet so familiar.

Preliminary Remarks: Kinds of Television 
11 
PRELIMINARY REMARKS: KINDS OF TELEVISION 
“Our culture –– Indian, Mexican, Anglo –– is getting real thin. […] TV is the whole existence for a new class 
of silent people. Look all around you in the Southwest; most of the buildings you see are mobile homes. Inside most 
of these homes are filthy people who can’t read, who don’t talk to each other, who have few or no relatives or 
friends, who are one unpaid bill or one small tragedy away from being homeless: people who can’t put food on the 
table or watch over their kids. The little money they have is used to install cable TV. […]
 
When I think of the future of the United States, I think of a little girl I saw inside one mobile home, a girl who –
– I can tell you from my own experience –– is not so untypical. She’s about three years old. Her parents plop her 
down all day by the TV, turned to the channel for soap operas and game shows. There’s dirt all over the house. 
There are tabloid magazines and TV schedules and beer cans. There’s not much furniture, no books. It smells.”
 
Cayce Boon, in: Robert D. Kaplan. An Empire Wilderness. 181
 
––
 
When talking about television I am indeed aware of the cultural discourse about 
this medium. In Kaplan’s apocalyptic narrative about contemporary America, the 
Navajo Cayce Boon paints a picture for him that is far removed from being fiction 
and seems to prove Neil Postman right: we may indeed be Amusing Ourselves to 
Death; and television is the carrier medium. It is an apocalypse not some time far 
away in the future. It is happening right now. It has been happening for quite some 
years, and there is apparently no sign of betterment. 
In talking about television, thus, there remains an uncomfortable aftertaste, 
for there are really several kinds of television; and there are several ways of watching 
it. Saying “television,” though, makes as much sense as saying “printed words” 
when speaking about books, magazines, newspapers, print ads, etc. A medium that 
has but relatively recently arrived will be defined first by its form, only later by its 
diverse contents. Yet does what happens inside the box not appear indistinguisha-
ble? Unlike a book which most often is a distinct entity clearly demarcating whether 
it is fiction or non-fiction, collaboration or singly authored, art or a phone book; on 
television, everything appears to be flowing into everything else. Channels may dif-
fer, but most of the time, ads, news, fiction, documentaries, sports and games are 
interwoven. Not paying attention, one can get lost. According to Jerry Mander, that 
may just be the nature of the medium, no matter what content. Some, however, 
may even want to get lost deliberately. The “idiot box” is a background noise if 
there is nothing left to say or do. 
Yet there is also rich and exciting content, and there can be ways to appreciate 
it as such. There are ways of seeing that can be enriched by exploring that content, 
and which might even contribute toward seeing more in television than just a me-
dium, more than just something popular or visual: something worth talking about. 
This book is about a genre of fiction which plays out on TV. It is about a dense 
text full of wonder and magic, tragedy and hope, and, most of all, humanity; a my-
thology both old and new, and always evolving. 

12 
The Emancipation of the Soul 
 
A few of these television shows appear to contradict some of Postman’s 
warnings. In his main argument, he cautions against the danger that an ideology of 
entertainment poses to a civilized discourse in a polity, fearing that not Orwell but 
Huxley was right, and that in embracing entertainment as the all-powerful paradigm 
of culture, we will lose sight of traditional values of oral and especially of print cul-
ture, particularly that we will lose the capability to argue about complex matters in a 
complex way. His warnings still ring alarmingly true, especially when considering 
how television has transformed political discourse into advertisement campaigns, 
and how the most successful news media are those that can communicate the 
strongest narrative in an audio-visual way, highly entertaining of course. 
Jerry Mander’s even more devastating critique, putting forth Four Arguments for 
the Elimination of Television, hovers between a rejection of capitalism, and some ar-
guments that could almost be called Luddite, which do not address the content but 
the assumed nature of the medium itself, wherein he follows Benjamin’s critique of 
the mechanical reproduction of art (Mander 285-9). Chris Hedges in Empire of Illu-
sion makes remarks partially in a similar direction when describing how mass media 
are working towards dulling the moral sense of society and creating an illusion of 
literacy. 
The criticism that the nature of the medium does not allow for any real depth 
and valuable content, and that the entertainment paradigm wins out over any se-
rious discussions, is the one I would like to see challenged by the ensuing analysis. 
Even though there are also serious news shows (PBS comes to mind) and do-
cumentaries, which would address the main thrust of Postman’s argument, my fo-
cus will be on fiction, on story-based entertainment. I will not be discussing who-
dunits or soap operas, but intend to highlight a more sophisticated genre of shows 
whose very complexity seems to contradict what Postman has suggested as true 
regarding television programming, namely his three commandments. 
First, “Thou shalt have no prerequisites” (147). As will be seen, prerequisites 
can be found in all the shows discussed later on. There is simply no possibility to 
understand episodes in the later seasons of any of these shows, with the exception 
of a few stand-alone episodes of Star Trek and The X-Files, without having watched 
the respective show attentively for years. Perhaps it would thus be conducive to 
understanding to see television series like the ones under discussion more similar to 
a novel, just as movies are more similar to short stories. A movie usually can be 
understood without prerequisites. The action has to be very focused, the characters 
will oftentimes not be developing much, because there simply is no time. A long-
running television series, however, does allow for extensive character development, 
for the most intricate of plots, and for many twists and turns. While some of these 
shows are difficult to watch without context, some are impossible. Every season of 
24, for instance, tells the story of a single day in 24 episodes, in “real time.” Miss an 
hour, and you may have missed crucial information. 

 
Preliminary Remarks: Kinds of Television 
13 
Second, “Thou shalt induce no perplexity” (147). Lost is nothing but an exer-
cise in frustration. Season 5 sees characters jump through time, and the audience 
has to keep track which character is where, or rather, when. Season 6 has some 
characters be both on the island and in Los Angeles, apparently in some kind of al-
ternate reality. On Farscape, the main character John Crichton is doubled in season 
three, from whence on for a certain while one episode shows Crichton I, the next 
Crichton II. To call this perplexing is almost euphemistic. Such complications are 
common to the genre. 
Third, “Thou shalt avoid exposition like the ten plagues visited upon Egypt” 
(148), wherein he defines exposition as “[a]rguments, hypotheses, discussions, rea-
sons, refutations or any of the traditional instruments of reasoned discourse” (148), 
yet also decries exposition in the form of “story-telling, conducted through dynam-
ic images and supported by music,” (148) saying, in fact, that “[n]othing will be 
taught on television that cannot be both visualized and placed in a theatrical con-
text” (148). In fact, television indeed is about visualization and theatricality, but 
does that indeed preclude any kind of exposition? But maybe the way to answer 
this point is to draw attention to the fact that the very genre under discussion has 
had a long tradition of “spilling over” into expositionary print media as well. Espe-
cially Star Trek has produced a vast number of encyclopedias, technical manuals, 
and also internet discussion forums that are full with philosophical and scientific, 
and, granted, also trivial investigations of the television franchise itself, but also of 
matters ranging beyond that. This very book hopefully in itself testifies to the mul-
tiple ways television can indeed be food for thought. 
You might say that nevertheless, television is trivial, and trivializes the issues it 
depicts, but can that indeed not also be said about literature? Behind much of 
Postman’s critique could be seen a probably too enthusiastic estimation of printed 
media. I would like to maintain that it should not necessarily matter whether a phi-
losophical discussion is opened up after watching an episode of Buffy the Vampire 
Slayer or after reading a “good book.” David Bianculli’s Teleliteracy and Steven John-
son’s Everything Bad Is Good For You make similar points. They do not really provide 
answers to either Postman’s or Mander’s critique of the nature of the medium di-
rectly, but make a case for the content of television irrespective of the technology, 
pointing out oftentimes overlooked complexities and a richness of material that 
need not shy away from a comparison with the best of literature. This is a direction 
the book at hand will follow as well, however, with a bit of a caveat. 
A “good” television show, in my opinion, is one that is well-made and has 
high aesthetic and narrative standards, engaging dialog and diverse philosophical 
themes; it may, nevertheless, be problematic in some respects regarding its content. 
For despite all the complexity television demonstrably allows for, it does remain a 
medium that on the surface appears to be able to communicate ideas and aesthetics 
more effortlessly than any other medium. It is indeed by most people understood 
as mere entertainment, which could mean that much of its content is accepted 

14 
The Emancipation of the Soul 
 
without question. Television, of course, is indeed part of show business, and it is 
interested in evoking emotions, in connecting beyond the rational level; just as it is 
an industry interested in making money, of course. None of this is denied herein. 
Yet the specific television series discussed in this volume nevertheless can be said 
to be different from the hype of “reality” television, of soap operas, of simple 
whodunits: They are fueled by ideas that are native to those kinds of philosophy 
and theology that discuss the value, nature, and prospects of humanity itself. They 
are also a reflection of society. 
This, again, makes an analysis urgent: Even on “good television” there remain 
problematic issues that are displayed in a commonplace way. Torture, violence, the 
glorification of charismatic leaders, romantic narration, xenophobia, homophobia, 
machismo, and anti-democratic notions are a staple of the genre of fiction that will 
be analyzed in the following study. Looking away and ignoring all that would in-
deed prove the points of Postman, Mander and other critics. Art needs explaining; 
whether it happens on the printed page, on the stage, in the museum, in the concert 
hall, the music player, the cinema, the television or wherever else imaginable. It is 
not just entertainment, but it is a reflection of our societies, of our viewing practic-
es, of the ways we imagine what being human means. And as television is one of 
the lead mediums of American society, a close reading of parts of its contents must 
be seen as necessary and legitimate. 
Thanks and Acknowledgements 
A book is not written in a vacuum, and without support. Thus I would like to 
thank my parents for their tireless and continued dedication. Without it, nothing 
would have been possible.  
My academic advisers Reinhard Isensee and Eva Boesenberg have provided 
invaluable impulses and encouragement. My thanks also go to Antje Dallmann and 
Allison Davis-White Eyes, who have read the manuscript although they did not 
have to, and who have supplied me with much needed criticism and inspiration. All 
remaining mistakes and shortcomings of the book are mine. I would also like to 
thank my friends and family Chris Flor, Cordula and Marek Kneis, Martina Kohl, 
Anne Krüger, Jörn Lies and Daniela Simon, who never grew tired of talking about 
television in an academic way, commented on parts of the book, and helped me 
think better.

PART ONE: OF MYTHS & MEMES 
 
 

 
 
 

 
Chapter 1: The Mythological Genre 
17 
1. THE MYTHOLOGICAL GENRE: RELIGIOUS THOUGHT IN 
ALLEGORICAL TELEVISION 
Dream is the personalized myth, myth the depersonalized dream; both myth and dream are symbolic in the same 
general way of the dynamics of the psyche. But in the dream the forms are quirked by the peculiar troubles of the 
dreamer, whereas in myth the problems and solutions shown are directly valid for mankind. 
 
 –– Joseph Campbell. The Hero with a Thousand Faces. 19. 
Outline: This chapter introduces the structure of the book, its main themes and 
parts of its underlying theoretical foundation. 
1.1. Introduction: Scope and Outline of the Investigation 
The genre of science fiction, fantasy and horror is the place for the grand gesture, 
for the sweeping tale binding past, present and future into one large narrative. 
Good and evil, destiny and freedom, fate and choice –– the crucible of the allegori-
cal allows for more than what is already visible in real life. Fictionality and allegory 
provide the free space to indulge in fantasy, as much as in thinly veiling controver-
sial issues of today in a world of tomorrow or in a universe far, far away. 
Safely removed from the considerations of technical correctness regarding 
genuinely real procedures which haunt each police drama or courtroom show, oth-
er genres of almost similar density, the more fantastical can concentrate on mythol-
ogy, derived or proper. It does not really matter whether a transporter malfunction 
on the starship Voyager is depicted correctly; nobody would know that anyway ex-
cept the geeks, and even if a technical manual existed, it could be easily overridden 
by pulling a new rabbit out of the hat once a new episode or series is launched. 
What matters, though, is what is usually referred to as “humanity:” the true (or 
flawed) depiction of feelings, drives, dreams, hopes, fears and archetypal situations. 
Psychology and philosophy, and religion, too, are at the center of the fantastic; the 
details of the how are just, well, details. 
This study sets out to investigate the dogmatic core of that emotional and phi-
losophical center, namely the occurrence of religious themes in several recent or 
contemporary American television series. The concepts of religion as shown in the 
respective texts will be examined in the context of the medium (television), the fan-
tastical hyper-genre, and allegedly American cultural values such as individualism, 
freedom of choice vs. concepts of collectivism, destiny and fate. 
Structure of the Book 
While there exists a theoretical focus based on established theories in literary and 
cultural studies underlying the analysis of the material given in Part Two (Chapters 
3-7), and which will be subsequently introduced, Chapter 2 explores the perspective 

18 
Part One: Of Myths and Memes 
 
of memetics as a further approach to the topic. As memetic theory features what 
can be called a bottom-up perspective of culture, delivering a different reading of 
cultural artifacts that is not yet widely applied in literary and cultural criticism, this 
will need some introduction. Thus a brief overview of memetic theory will be pro-
vided in order to establish the argument in how far this theoretical model might be 
applied to subjects of literary and cultural studies. 
Subsequently, five television franchises are introduced, and a critical reading 
of the outlined themes will be provided. This encompasses, amongst other ele-
ments, the analysis of story, character development, narrative strategies, selected 
motifs, and the American cultural imaginary. The rather large number of television 
shows discussed results from the comparative perspective chosen. The series intro-
duced in Chapters 3-7 have all created franchises, they have spawned, so to say: 
One show has been either expanded into another, or a sequel has been produced, 
or a series with a similar character and style1 has been created by the same produc-
tion team. Thus they will be treated like twin or parent/offspring phenomena. The 
analysis of each franchise will look at an issue constitutive for the particular series, 
but important throughout the genre. The franchises are: 
 
Chapter 3: The X-Files (1993-2002) and Millennium (1996-1999). Created and 
produced by Chris Carter et al., these series deal with the investigation of so-
called paranormal phenomena, conspiracy theories, millennialism, apocalyptic 
visions and religious experience. The two shows are distinct entities but are re-
lated in many ways with regard to topic, visual style, music, overall atmos-
phere, depictions of society, and religious outlook. The leitmotif for this chap-
ter will be the Errand into the Wilderness, in relation to these and other cru-
cial texts under discussion. 
 
Chapter 4: Babylon 5 (“B5,” 1994-1998 plus subsequent TV movies) and Cru-
sade (1999). The epic narrative that constitutes the universe as created by J. 
Michael Straczynski tells a story filled with tales of ancient god-like beings, 
prophecy, fate and destiny, and technology indistinguishable from magic. 
Both shows are connected and function less as separate entities but as parts of 
the same story. The central focus herein lies in the depiction of authority, the 
resistance to authority, and a merging between political and religious rhetoric. 
 
Chapter 5: Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997-2003) and Angel (1999-2004). Vam-
pires, demons, gods, demigods, souls, fate, destiny, and epic struggles abound 
in a tale about emancipation and the fight between good and evil that is 
spread over two television shows which share a common mythology. The

“Style” or “look” herein means a combination of audio-visual (lighting, color, camera an-
gles and movement, kinds of music, effects etc.) and also some narrative elements (pace, 
amount of exposition given, buildup of action, frantic multitasking or linear storytelling) 
creating an idiosyncratic text different from other shows. 

 
Chapter 1: The Mythological Genre 
19 
chapter will concentrate on individual responsibility, emancipation from ste-
reotypes, and the “soul.” 
 
Chapter 6: Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007) and Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009). The 
fight against aliens posing as gods, or possessing god-like powers, as well as 
the investigation into a mythical past which plays on many religious themes 
constitute the background of the Stargate franchise. The scientific perspective, 
however, governs the outlook of these series and is actively contrasted with 
obscurantist and exploitative religious foes. Science, pseudoscience and 
Euhemerism will serve as the central points for this chapter. 
 
Chapter 7: Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-1994) and Star Trek: Voyager 
(1994-2001). The religious “problem” of the soul becomes manifest in the ar-
tificial life characters of the android Data and the holographic Doctor. Since 
its beginnings in the 1960s, the various Star Trek television series and films 
have explored the nature of what we understand as “humanity,” a discussion 
which is most poignant when applied to non-biological life. Thus the leitmotif 
for the final case study will consist in artificial intelligence and the problem of 
the soul. 
After the exposition of the various candidates for analysis, Chapter 8 supplements 
these by discussing several reoccurring features which are related to religious think-
ing and which are common to all the franchises investigated, plus some series in the 
closer vicinity. This summary is made in order to discern specific patterns. Chapter 
9 connects the findings of Chapter 8 and the case studies in a comparative mode 
with the theoretical bodies established and referred to in Chapters 1 and 2, thus 
underlining the complementary nature of most of literary and cultural theory, and 
placing memetic theory inside the context of already established theories. Specifi-
cally, the memetic perspective will be utilized for a new approach towards genre 
theory. Chapter 10 serves as a conclusion. 
1.2. The Mythological Genre: Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror 
The Mythological Genre in Television 
Prime-time dramatic television has come a long way since its inception (cf. Johnson 
2005). The format of stand-alone episodes airing on a weekly basis has been severe-
ly modified and the narrative focus often has shifted to extensive story arcs, more 
substantial character development and a greater coherence. Television series already 
had discovered their serial character within the form of the soap opera, until a 
heightened sense of seriality started to manifest itself in areas that, traditionally, 
were dominated by the anthology-style of narration, namely detective, but especial-

20 
Part One: Of Myths and Memes 
 
ly science fiction, fantasy and horror shows.2 These will constitute the main focus 
of the ensuing analysis, and especially the religious and mythological patterns and 
ideas contained therein. 
When talking about religious topics in American television series, one could 
think of a direct treatment of such issues on shows like 7th Heaven, The West Wing, 
Picket Fences or many more. This would open up a vast territory of discussion com-
menting on daily-life themes, containing direct remarks on politics and law, show-
ing characters assumedly true to real life. 
On the other hand, there exist shows that are less prone to “reality”-based 
depictions of contemporary life, and that offer allegorical tales of monsters and he-
roes here on Earth or in outer space. This is especially the case in the combined 
genres of science fiction, fantasy and horror. As there are many points of congru-
ence between these genres, including overlapping audiences and fandoms (cf. Jen-
kins 1992), but also a shared medium with somehow similar contents, I have cho-
sen to group them into one. 
Finding a common term for this combined genre, however, is not easy. All 
three contain tales with a high degree of allegory and metaphor, depict certain uto-
pian or dystopian settings, undertake an extremely strong othering of outsiders 
(demons, aliens, monsters etc.) and usually feature heroes with a highly exaggerated 
sense of morality and dedication, or with superpowers. While all these are just mat-
ters of degree, nevertheless, if all such elements occur together, the respective sto-
ries usually belong to one of the three sub-genres. 
The most striking commonality, however, is the creation of a very compelling, 
and usually both strongly idiosyncratic yet also highly archetypal mythology. The 
latter term has been made very popular by The X-Files, which features stand-alone 
episodes and those contained within a larger story arc creating a specifically so-
called mythology. Of course, mythology is a technical term as well3, and mythological 
elements occur in lots of works. Yet in the sense of creating a unique world, a non-

“Anthology style” herein means that the various episodes of a television series could ideally 
be watched without any specific order in mind, and that each episode (though belonging to 
the same series) could be seen as standing on its own. Long story arcs would be resisted. 
Science Fiction in the United States has for a long time been dominated by anthology 
magazines like Amazing Stories (cf. Schulz 1986: 37-39), which has been “translated” into 
television with shows like The Twilight Zone (1959-1964) and The Outer Limits (1963-1965). 
This is the original context into which the original Star Trek series has been brought. Hom-
age to this is paid in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode 6.13 “Far Beyond the Stars,” 
which features the main cast as members of a science fiction magazine writing staff and 
producers (For a further discussion, see Flor & Kneis 2007, Kneis 2007).  
3  
When speaking about mythology, I use the common understanding of mythology as a body 
of myths and stories containing tales of gods, heroes, challenge and growth, often tied to a 
nationalist narrative. The meaning of “myth” could, of course, be closer examined (cf. 
Barthes 1957). 

 
Chapter 1: The Mythological Genre 
21 
world, an ou-topia4, a counter-world deliberately deviating from the discourse of 
daily, reality-based discourse, this insistence upon a mythology pertains to all these 
genres. 
There are certain similarities in the Mythological5 Genre which allow for a cul-
ture of cross-reading. In fact, many of the television shows and films, also books 
and graphic novels, are able to refer to each other because there is a common au-
dience, a shared body of work, and similar production conditions. Despite some 
“incompatibilities” (the competitions between the fandoms of Star Trek, Star Wars 
and Babylon 5 come to mind), there are more commonalities than crucial differ-
ences, and the basic structure and outline of major franchises are known through-
out. This becomes especially apparent within shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 
Angel, Stargate: SG-1, Stargate: Atlantis and, perhaps most of all, Farscape. All these 
could be described as featuring a decidedly post-modern slant in their use of irony, 
in-jokes and excessive quoting of other franchises, creating what could be under-
stood as more of an open text, deliberately interacting with other works. Again, 
these are matters of degree. Least post-modern in that sense would be Star Trek 6, 
whose consistent seriousness and solemnity create more of a closed text on most 
occasions, almost hermetically sealed against interaction with and quoting of other 
texts in the genre.  
The Coherence of Narrative and the Use of Mythology 
The epic narrative of shows like Babylon 5, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel makes 
use of various elements like prophetic dreams foreshadowing future events, proph-
esies and a general notion of fate and destiny. In comparison with more conven-
tional modes of television storytelling, the universes created by these shows feature 
a rich text possessing both retrospective and prospective coherence. It’s not just 
that the past is being explained by added layers of narrative, it’s also that certain 
elements of a future yet to come are mentioned in advance in prophecies, dreams 
or flash-forwards to the future. 
This constitutes a development in prime-time television narration that can be 
found in other relatively recent shows like The X-Files and especially Lost as well. 
What this structure allows for is a text that possesses much more tangibility and 
dimension than, for instance, a prime time detective show of the past. The exis-
tence of such kind of complex storytelling appears to be connected to the assumed 
existence of a more attentive audience; and it probably is no coincidence that this is 
                                                      
4  
“Utopia” is a pun on ou-topos, a non-place, vs. eu-topos, a good place. 
5  
When referring to the Mythological Genre, I will use a capital M –– when referring to my-
thology as such, a small one. 
6  
As Star Trek is distributed over several television shows, I will sometimes refer to Star Trek 
as a franchise in general, or to its specific incarnations (Star Trek: The Original Series (TOS), 
Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9), Star Trek: Voyager 
(VGR), Star Trek: Enterprise (ENT, or just Enterprise)). 

22 
Part One: Of Myths and Memes 
 
linked to the science-fiction/horror/fantasy hyper-genre which is able to fit easily 
into an already existing frame of reference. For the shows Buffy and Angel, it is very 
much possible to be quoting franchises like Star Trek, The X-Files, Star Wars, The 
Lord of the Rings and James Bond, because theirs is an audience that apparently knows 
all these. 
The topos of individuality as set against greater authority and destiny is not es-
sentially a new one, especially in America. Yet there can be found a re-emergence 
of themes like this in recent time. This is a matter of how central such a theme is to 
a text, how directly the conflict is spelled out. On Star Wars and The Lord of the 
Rings, the fight is directed against insidious forces of darkness, yet in the end, that 
struggle always concludes with the establishment of new, but better, royal rule (Brin 
2003). On Star Trek, we usually encounter a society that is already eu-topian, and 
which is constantly compared with and contrasted against divergent models of au-
thority and rule. But the social order of Earth is no longer in serious negotiation, 
and exceptions from the rule are found in single instances only. Slightly different 
cases, however, are Voyager and Enterprise, but again, the questions posed therein are 
always set against the context of an already established social paradise. 
Looking at literature, there surely is an abundance of texts challenging social 
norms of behavior and structures of authority. In William Dean Howells’ The Rise of 
Silas Lapham, Edith Wharton’s The House of Mirth and Philip Roth’s The Human 
Stain, for instance, we find main characters struggling for individuality against an 
overarching societal establishment, but the fight is mostly focused on the personal 
sphere, it stays within the family. 
It usually remains within the realm of directly political stories or political alle-
gories to negotiate matters of individuality in the light of authority, and since au-
thors like Plato and others7, the most suitable genre has been that of the greater 
science-fiction, horror and fantasy genre. That is not to say that matters of political 
importance cannot be negotiated in any other way, one prime case being directly 
political or historical stories like Shakespeare’s dramas about kings, movies like 
Oliver Stone’s Nixon and heart-of-darkness-type or dystopian stories like Coppola’s 
Apocalypse Now, and of course shows like The West Wing. But usually, the narrative 
potential within the Mythological Genre allows for a different kind of stories that 
can offer much more allegorical and bolder tales.

Namely Plato’s story of Atlantis and Ancient Athens in the dialogs of Timaios and Kritias. 
Other works would be Thomas More’s Utopia (1516), Francis Bacon’s Nova Atlantis (1627), 
Tomasso Campanella’s Civitas Solis (1623), Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726), Aldous 
Huxley’s Brave New World (1932), George Orwell’s Nineteen-Eighty Four (1949), Ray 
Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 (1953), and the works of Isaac Asimov. Especially Plato will be of 
importance in the Mythological Genre, while Asimov’s influence on fictions about artificial 
intelligence is crucial for Star Trek, amongst others (Cf. Kneis 2010a+2010b). 

 
Chapter 1: The Mythological Genre 
23 
As television provides the narrative with much more space to develop, there 
exists a greater potential for stories of fate and destiny, and with the advent of Twin 
Peaks, The X-Files, Babylon 5 and the Whedon shows8, this potential has been rea-
lized. It is connected to a mode of storytelling that no longer centers on individual 
episodes but on seasons or even the entire series itself. The X-Files tells a story 
about individuals who position themselves against a greater conspiracy. Babylon 5 
tells different stories of emancipation from false authority, one featuring the fight 
against a fascist dictatorship on Earth, another the emancipation of the “younger 
races” against their quasi-caretakers, the Vorlons and the Shadows, who want to 
keep them in a state of having no other choice but that between order and chaos, 
no choice of their own, but a choice laid upon them. The “third age of mankind” is 
described as that which no longer sees humans and humanoid civilizations sub-
jected to old, aristocratic authority. On the third season of Enterprise, the fight 
against destiny is the fight against the timeline in a temporal cold war, it is the fight 
against probability, against possible future outcomes of present actions, a leitmotif 
that occasionally manifests itself within the Star Trek universe and is also taken up 
by Farscape. 
1.3. Theoretical Foundation 
Interdisciplinary Character 
This study follows a strongly interdisciplinary and comparative approach. It will 
focus on a view of cultural artifacts that sees television and film on an equal footing 
with literature. The treatment of cultural artifacts as kinds of text and discourse 
thus owes to a certain deconstructive outlook, in which traditional hierarchies of 
aesthetically and critically acceptable texts are continually being re-negotiated and 
overturned.  
In addition to, and building up to the memetic perspective, the texts of the 
case studies (Ch. 3-7), shall be analyzed from a primarily psychoanalyti-
cal/philosophical/anthropological view of the cultural imaginary. Herein I follow 
psychoanalytical approaches by C.G. Jung (archetypes), which are continued by E. 
O. Wilson (consilience, sociobiology). Concerning psychoanalytical aspects of 
emancipation, I will be relying heavily on Erich Fromm and Arno Gruen. For phi-
losophical-scientific models of consciousness, culture and religion, Daniel Dennett 
will be central, as much as other authors mentioned subsequently. 
Memetics 
The main theoretical thrust of this book will come from memetic theory, a model 
of explaining culture on the basis of imitation.9 This will be outlined in Chapter 2

24 
Part One: Of Myths and Memes 
 
and connected to more traditional approaches in Chapters 8 and 9, which will allow 
for a more concerted exposition of the material under discussion, so that both, the 
traditional and the memetic perspective, will be given equal opportunity of expres-
sion. 
Religion as a Natural Phenomenon 
Memetic theory also connects to a rising explanatory model in anthropology and 
cultural studies for the understanding of religion. When talking about religion, the 
mere term can become contentious. Religion can be organized or not, it can be 
monotheistic or not, it can be theistic or not, individual or social, etc. Mythology is 
oftentimes seen as something not related to (one’s own) religion.10 Spirituality is a 
term hovering between reaching deeply contemplative states of thought and talking 
to crystals. New Age11 brings the latter into harmony with the Noble Savage. More 
progressive and academic understandings of religion, but also political propaganda, 
tend to point to issues like values, morality, progress, responsibility, guilt, salvation, 
civilization, comfort, and others. 
For the purpose of this study, I will be relying on recent approaches of under-
standing religion on what could be called anthropological or naturalist12 grounds. 
This concerns a growing body of work of not necessarily always concurring scho-
larship that shall now be briefly introduced. 
The link between the humanities and the natural sciences is made clear by the 
subtitle of Daniel Dennett’s Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon (2006). 
This naturalist or positivist treatment of religion, which usually does not address 
more theological approaches of transcendental thinking, follows several anthropo-
logically inspired approaches to analyze components of religious thinking, as in 
Scott Atran’s In Gods We Trust (2002), Pascal Boyer’s Religion Explained (2001), Ste-
                                                      
10  
Hardly anyone takes offense when people speak about Greek or Roman mythology; yet 
talking about Judaism, Islam or Christianity as “mythologies” would probably cause of-
fense, as these are understood as religions. Mythology –– since the days of Plato –– carries 
a fictitious and tentative component (mythos), which science (roughly speaking, logos) is 
not supposed to have. What makes mythology religion is the assumption of veracity; what 
makes (past) religions mythology is the assumption of obsolescence and a lack of explana-
tory power. This, again, uses the common understanding of mythology, see page 20. 
11  
“New Age” thinking is oftentimes characterized by a hodgepodge mixture of ideas drawn 
from traditional pantheism, deification of nature, theories of the Noble Savage, Wicca reli-
gion (especially regarding references to the “Goddess,” such as on Farscape), and a seeming-
ly all-embracing “spirituality” that may not care at all about systematizing any such thinking 
in the form of an organized movement. The key to New Ageism may actually be its eva-
siveness, and its resistance to thorough definition. It may indeed be more a state of mind 
than a religion, and can be seen to have incorporated elements from Theosophy, Astrology, 
and distorted views of Quantum Theory, amongst others.  
12  
“Naturalist” here means a natural-sciences approach, and not one pertaining to the litera-
ture of Realism and Naturalism.

wart Guthrie’s Faces in the Clouds (1993) and Michael Shermer’s How We Believe 
(2000/2003). 
Carl Sagan’s The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark (1996), 
Michael Shermer’s Why People Believe Weird Things (1997/2002), and Martin Gard-
ner’s classic Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (1957) will be especially important 
for this study regarding the link between pseudoscience and religion, particularly 
concerning topics like Pyramidology, alien abductions, Dianetics/Scientology, At-
lantis, Lemuria etc. 
More political aspects of current debates surrounding religion are rather 
vehemently brought up by Sam Harris’ Letter to a Christian Nation (2006) and The 
End of Faith (2004), Christopher Hitchens’ God is Not Great (2007), Richard Daw-
kins’ The God Delusion (2006) and A Devil’s Chaplain (2003), Niall Shank’s God, the 
Devil, and Darwin (2004), and a collection of essays compiled by John Brockman in 
the volume Intelligent Thought. Science versus the Intelligent Design Movement (2006). 
I will be following these approaches towards religion as they are closer to 
memetic theory (especially in Dawkins’ and Dennett’s work) than other, more theo-
logical ways of seeing.

2. SEEING THINGS DIFFERENTLY: 
A MEMETIC APPROACH TO CULTURE 
A scholar is just a library’s way of making another library.
 
 –– Daniel Dennett. Consciousness Explained. 202. 
Outline: This chapter introduces memetic theory and shows how a memetic per-
spective can be helpful for understanding literary and cultural artifacts.  
2.1. From Genes to Memes 
There exists a wide range of approaches towards the explanation and interpretation 
of cultural artifacts. Various theoretical models to understand culture see literature 
and audio-visual artistic utterances (motion pictures, television, photography, thea-
ter, music etc.) in the context of communication models in which the “text” stands 
between the sender and the receiver. Other approaches investigate the means and 
contexts of production, the social surroundings, the historical period and details in 
the life of the author(s). As authorship, especially in post-structuralist theory, is in-
creasingly problematized and considered defunct as an interpretative tool (Barthes 
1977: 142-148, Culler 1997: 62-65), recent developments in theory operate on a 
text-level as well, speaking of a “perspective of the text,” a level of “discourse,” etc. 
Nevertheless, this perspective is usually not executed to the fullest. 
A memetic approach to literary and cultural studies could deliver just that: A 
sort of bottom-up way of viewing and analyzing cultural artifacts. As memetic 
theory is an emergent research program that has only recently been gaining mo-
mentum, it is too soon to say whether the overall findings of memetics, especially 
on the more naturalist side, will in the future amount to a thorough and extensive 
new explanation of culture. For the moment, however, enough pieces of the puzzle 
point towards productive avenues leading to new interpretations of culture, allow-
ing for new perspectives and synergies and for higher degrees of consilience be-
tween the life sciences and the humanities. This investigation proposes that this can 
hold true for the humanities as well, as for literary and cultural studies, memetics 
could constitute a new instrument in the toolbox of criticism. 
Selfish Genes, Replicators, Vehicles 
Though there are some solitary precursors (cf. Hull 2000: 50), modern memetics 
begins with ethologist Richard Dawkins’ notion that just as there exist biological 
replicators (genes) there may exist cultural replicators as well. So, what is a replica-
tor? 
The fundamental unit, the prime mover of all life, is the replicator. A replicator is anything 
in the universe of which copies are made. Replicators come into existence, in the first 

28 
Part One: Of Myths and Memes 
 
place, by chance, by the random jostling of smaller particles. Once a replicator has come in-
to existence it is capable of generating an indefinitely large set of copies of itself. No copy-
ing process is perfect, however, and the population of replicators comes to include varieties 
that differ from one another. […] 
[The] ganging up of mutually compatible replicators began to be formalized in the creation 
of discrete vehicles –– cells and, later, many-celled bodies. Vehicles that evolved a bottle-
necked life cycle prospered, and became more discrete and vehicle-like. (Dawkins 1989: 
264f) 
The explanation of biological phenomena has always had to struggle with the no-
tion of purpose and design. This is not only a question with which the “intelligent 
design” movement is concerned: biological research and thinking have been dealing 
with this question as well (Ruse 1999, 2003, 2005). The central question of “why” 
manifests itself as a question of “who benefits,” “cui bono” (Dennett 1995: 324-
330). Are some developments “intended for” “the good of the species,” “the 
group,” “the individual?” Selection at the level of the group and the species is in-
creasingly seen as problematic: Any group level compromise would be vulnerable 
to exploitation through those not playing by the book. Apparent harmony on the 
group level is either due to principles of kin selection or game theory (Dawkins 
1976, Matt Ridley 1996). The species itself is a rather crude construct whose boun-
daries can often only be delineated with hindsight. Remains the individual –– but 
even this does not solve the problem. For example, is an individual sterile worker 
ant who can only procreate through the queen and the male ants and shares her 
genes with her sisters a self-sustained, individual being? What about eukaryotes, 
multi-celled organisms that have formed by an ancient combination of single-celled 
organisms? What about the average mammal, an individual being, carrying around 
countless numbers of bacteria and parasites? Where does the boundary of the indi-
vidual begin, where does it end? Does it stop with living tissue? Dawkins (1982) has 
introduced the notion of the “extended phenotype.” In combination with what he 
has termed the “selfish gene” theory (Dawkins 1989, 1st edition 1976), the follow-
ing picture emerges: 
The answer to “cui bono” is: the genes. What do genes do? Genes replicate. 
How do they replicate? By a complex set of mechanisms having evolved over time. 
The replicators we now know as genes have bundled together and formed RNA 
and later DNA molecules, possibly with the help of intermediary substances like 
crystals (Cairns-Smith 1971, Dawkins 1989: 21f). “Naked” DNA molecules evolved 
towards possessing a hull which protected them against other, predatory DNA. 
Later, several such cells combined to form other cells, prokaryotes. Solitary RNA 
agents that depend upon a host’s DNA to replicate are known as viruses. Through 
a union of prokaryotes, eukaryotes formed larger organisms. These smaller and 
larger organisms function as “vehicles” (Dawkins 1989) or “interactors” (Hull 

 
Chapter 2: Seeing Things Differently 
29 
 
2000) respectively.13 It is the success or failure of the vehicles that determines14 the 
success or failure of the DNA: If a vehicle dies before having been able to make a 
copy of its genetic material through procreation, this specific combination of genes 
dies as well. Successful variants thrive. Changes in the genetic material can appear 
through copying mistakes or random changes, mutation. The Vast15 multitude of 
mutations is harmful, but those that are beneficial may bring forward new and bet-
ter adapted ways of survival. Adaptation is a fit, by means of selection, to environ-
mental conditions (geography, climate, predators, competitors, conspecifics). 
From the view of the taxonomist, new and “better”16 variants arise through-
out history: birds with better wings, mammals adapted to sea life, etc. From the 
“view” of the genes, the struggle for replication leads to ever more ingenious ways 
of adapting the vehicles containing the replicators to changing circumstances in the 
environment. Genes –– strictly allegorically speaking –– “behave” as if to maximize 
their own inclusive fitness, they seem to be “doing” everything in their power to stay 
alive and facilitate their own copying processes. This view does not assume consciousness 
on the part of the replicators, neither intentionality, neither that they promote selfishness. It is a 
way of seeing life from the perspective of the units which carry the information making life possible. 
Following Richard Dawkins (1989: 12-20, 194), three parameters are impor-
tant for fitness: longevity (Can the structures be well maintained over time?), fideli-
ty (Does the copying process happen with sufficient reliability?) and fecundity (Do 
the structures procreate frequently enough?). 
The genotype (the replicators) creates the phenotype (the vehicle). The phe-
notype, as already mentioned, may extend outside the individual’s body (Dawkins 
1982, 1996: 32-63): The spider’s web is its mechanism for predation. Its shape is 
determined by the spider’s genes, and even made by material created by the spider, 
and may eventually even be eaten again to conserve the spider’s resources. The web

By using the term of “interactor,” Hull intended to illustrate that vehicles are not passive, 
that they interact with the environment. Yet as this is in no way precluded by using the 
term of “vehicle,” and as Darwinian theory very much depends upon that very interaction, 
I have chosen to conform to Dawkins’ original terminology, as this illustrates the bottom-
up perspective best. Yes, vehicles interact, and they may even develop consciousness and 
forms of agency and organization less dependent of their genes. But regarding procreation 
and continued physical existence, it comes down to the replicators in the gametes carried 
by the vehicles. 
14  
“Determined” does not mean an inevitable fate: “The belief that genes are somehow super-
deterministic, in comparison with environmental causes, is a myth of extraordinary tenaci-
ty” (Dawkins 1982: 11) –– environmental effects can be similarly strong (cf. Ridley 2003), 
both frequently interact and depend on each other. 
15  
Daniel Dennett (1995: 109) has suggested using the spelling of “Vast” with a capital V, in 
order to indicate a vast, yet not infinite number of elements. 
16  
“Better” means: better able to do the job they were doing, resulting in better survival 
chances. This most often is just an incremental step, and it is in no way “better” in an aes-
thetic or somehow teleological or even eschatological sense of “progress.”

means for the spider what fangs and claws mean for a cat: phenotypic expressions 
of a genotype maximizing its capacity to survive. The beaver’s dam is a similar ex-
ample, though different in some aspects: The logs are not made of material created 
by the beavers. Both spider webs and beaver dams can be used communally. The 
result of the extension of phenotypic expression can manifest itself in “artifacts,” 
but also in effects upon other vehicles. Parasites influence their hosts for their own 
benefit, and contrary to the host’s benefit. The modification of the host’s bio-
chemistry, appearance or behavior would constitute the extended phenotype of the 
parasite. Thus the definition offered by Dawkins (1982: 233): 
An animal’s behaviour tends to maximize the survival of the genes “for” that behaviour, 
whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.  
It is this terminology that since its beginning has influenced modern memetics: 
“Selfish” replicators battling against each other via their phenotypic expressions in 
vehicles; replicators that may occur on their own or in union with others; replica-
tors having effects that extend beyond the realm of what is usually thought of as an 
individual body. 
Imitation 
Dawkins (1989: 192) proposes an independent cultural replicator called meme, as a 
shorthand for “mimeme,” alluding to imitation as the basis for cultural evolution: 
Examples of memes are tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes fashions, ways of making pots 
or of building arches. Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from 
body to body via sperms and eggs, so memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by 
leaping from brain to brain via a process which, in the broad sense, can be called imitation. 
Susan Blackmore (1999) takes up the notion of memes and defines a meme as that 
which is imitated (66). This definition does not even need to find a physical basis 
for memes, and works functionally. Something which is imitated can be called a 
meme. Memes can even band together, much like prokaryotes, and constitute what 
Blackmore calls co-adapting meme complexes, or for short, memeplexes (19-20). 
In his model of consciousness, Daniel Dennett (1991) uses memetic theory to ex-
plain aspects of the growth and workings of the mind. Robert Aunger (2002) pro-
poses a physical basis for memes. 
The importance of imitation for the propagation and maintenance of culture 
extends to the animal kingdom as well, as shown by Dugatkin (2000, also Dawkins 
1989: 189f). Generally speaking, each animal17 is born with a specific range of bio-
                                                      
17  
The discussion can probably be safely restricted to animals. As Dennett (2001: 448-455) 
shows, the necessity for the development of cognitive faculties comes from adaptation to 
shifting environments. As most plants are stationary, they do not need to develop machi-
nery to further adapt or to even feel changes –– of how much use is a sense of pain if you 
cannot evade it, of how much use are advanced cognitive functions if they cannot be used

logically given properties and faculties. Biology is an adaptation to the environment, 
but oftentimes this adaptation is deficient because environments –– landscape, cli-
mate, weather, other animals –– change. Learning is an adaptation to deal with 
change. While biological “knowledge” contained within the body is a given and will 
only change over time through evolutionary processes, the individual animal also 
needs to continually learn about its environment. Some information may already be 
in the possession of fellow animals, and a means of transferring that knowledge 
from animal to animal would be highly valuable. Most often, such knowledge final-
ly comes down to behavior: The question of how to get food translates into learn-
ing to do what others do in order to get food. Not knowing how to crack a nut, 
and seeing someone else doing it, an observer might want to do the same. This, 
however, is more complicated than it sounds. 
In order to imitate something, an observer has to be able to recognize what it 
is that needs to be imitated, and what exactly constitutes the relevant action that 
must be performed. Someone cracks a nut by hitting it with a rock, but she also 
wipes her brow. Is the wiping part of the cracking? The ability to recognize sense 
from mere “noise,” information-wise, is of crucial importance. Some processes will 
become automated (i.e. performed without needing to think about it). Once having 
learned that a red traffic light demands to stop, a driver will not wonder each and 
every time what it means. Seeing such a light will automatically incite stopping, and 
the driver will have to make a conscious decision to act contrary to that impulse 
once seeing it. Red traffic light thus translates into an action. 
In a thinking mind, actions are often contemplated before performed, based 
on ideas floating around in the mind. Yet out of the abundance of ideas, which 
shall carry the day? In his theory of consciousness, Dennett (1991) sees a great 
number of memes competing with each other inside the brain. Successful ones 
“prevail” if they can push others to the side. The more complex this process be-
comes, the more it relies on language –– and language, in turn, pushes for brain 
complexity. Thinking, in this mode, can be seen as a kind of rehearsal: words are 
formed and rejected, pitted against other words, sentences are made and remade, 
connections are formed and broken. In fact, it may even need speaking out loud 
and hearing the words spoken for the brain to make new connections, as this is the 
easiest way for some parts of the brain to communicate with others (Dennett 2001: 
227-252): Speaking out loud can be seen as part of the thinking process. 
Memes are replicators. They are being copied by imitation.18 There can be 
several kinds of vehicles: Memes are carried for instance by words, collections of 
                                                                                                                                                                      
to adapt. Where there is (probably) no short-term individual adaptation (other than on an 
evolutionary scale), where there is no cognition, there may not arise the question of culture. 
18  
Aunger (2002: 232-275) provides memetic theory with a physical basis by pointing out that 
this imitation can be understood also on a neurological basis: Information is contained in 
nerve cells, in electric potentials. These have to be copied over and over in order to be

words, music, and physical artifacts.19 The success of an artifact (i.e. survival, con-
tinued production, updates to newer models) testifies to the success of the underly-
ing meme. 
“Viruses of the Mind:” Memes as Evolving Ideas 
A meme may be seen as an idea that is evolving. Evolution means the differential 
survival of a replicator by means of natural selection, drift, and other mechanisms. 
Does natural selection apply to memetics, or should we not rather speak of artificial 
selection? 
The analogies to biological replication may need to be given up at a certain 
point, as genes, too, are just one type amongst other possible types of replicators.20 
Some properties of genetic replicators may be gene-specific, others may be meme-
specific. Nevertheless, the analogy can still be a fruitful one. 
Only very recently have possibilities arisen that enable a direct look at genetic 
material, yet in the past, many taxonomies and evolutionary trajectories have been 
established –– most of the time quite reliably –– by evaluating the phenotype. It is 
apparent, for instance, that lions, tigers, cougars and domestic cats belong to the 
same family, felidae. This can be recognized from looking at the phenotype. Like-
wise, looking at a saber tooth tiger shows similarities back in time. Evolutionary 
trajectories can be established from comparing present and past animals on a pheno-
typical level. Most fossils do not contain DNA, and the trajectory from dinosaurs to 
archaeopteryx to modern birds relies on analyses of bones and feathers mostly. It is 
clear, though, that archaeopteryx did not just morph into a sparrow. Both are phys-
ical representations of a genetic bauplan, or rather, a recipe that underlies the building 
of a specific unit. Recipe means that it may be impossible to actually point to singu-
lar genes having specific effects, and that the entirety of the genome will be rele-
vant: 
If we follow a particular recipe, word for word, in a cookery book, what finally emerges 
from the oven is a cake. We cannot now break the cake into its component crumbs and 
say: this crumb corresponds to the first word in the recipe; this crumb corresponds to the 
second word in the recipe, etc. With minor exceptions such as the cherry on top, there is 
no one-to-one mapping from words of recipe to ‘bits’ of cake. The whole recipe maps on 
to the whole cake. (Dawkins 1981) 
Artifacts are, of course, made. A watch does require a watchmaker. Yet the watch-
maker leads back to a biological entity again: The watch was designed by a human 
                                                                                                                                                                      
maintained. A certain meme can be said to influence a nerve cell and to thus put it in a spe-
cific state. Communicating the same meme to another person will probably incite a nerve 
cell in the other brain to mimic the same state. 
19  
There is a certain controversy about whether artifacts like the wheel can be seen as a 
memes, cf. the discussion in Aunger (2000: 208-212). 
20  
Aunger (2002: 93-135) provides other examples, e.g. prions.

being, the human being, however, was not designed –– she looks designoid21 but 
was “constructed” by a process of natural selection. Actually, what has changed 
over time were the genes in dependence of the success of the phenotypes. Success-
ful phenotypes lead to a success of the genotype/bauplan/recipe, unsuccessful 
phenotypes are evolutionary cul-de-sacs. 
The human watchmaker herself, however, does not exist in a biological or cul-
tural vacuum. Humans build watches because we cannot measure time reliably on 
our own to a sufficient degree of accuracy. Watches reflect the length of the day, 
but also the number of months in the year as well as the fact that the Babylonians 
used the number 60 as a basis for their mathematics, as it lends itself to division by 
several numbers. Humans who build watches today have a history of watch-making 
to look back to, which restricts design options.22 
The resistance against any other day than one based on a 12/24 hour scheme, 
and an hour based on anything else than sixty minutes is so strong that alternative 
solutions, like a 100-minute hour, must appear impossible. Watches are also status 
symbols, expensive watches signifying wealth and success, which are still criteria 
relevant for finding mates (Diamond 1998: 167-192).23 
So, is culture, once again, just one further instance of an extended phenotype? 
Yes and no. There can be no denying that memes have arisen in an environment 
created by genes. From the view of the theory of gene-culture co-evolution, memes 
are not seen as a sufficient answer to explain culture (Boyd and Richerson 2000, 
2004). Of course, with enough effort, anything may be explained by breaking it 
down to biological success (procreation). However, a shift in perspective could be 
helpful. 
You watch an ant in a meadow, laboriously climbing up a blade of grass, higher and higher 
until it falls, then climbs again, and again, like Sisyphus rolling his rock, always striving to 
reach the top. Why is the ant doing this? What benefit is it seeking for itself in this stre-
nuous and unlikely activity? Wrong question, as it turns out. No biological benefit accrues 
to the ant. It is not trying to get a better view of the territory or seeking food or showing 
off to a potential mate, for instance. Its brain has been commandeered by a tiny parasite, a 
lancet fluke (Dicrocelium dendriticum), that needs to get itself into the stomach of a sheep or a 
cow in order to complete its reproductive cycle. This little brain worm is driving the ant in-
to position to benefit its progeny, not the ant’s. This is not an isolated phenomenon. Simi-
                                                      
21  
Dawkins differentiates between true design and objects appearing to be designed, invoking 
the illusion of design –– this he calls designoid (1996b: 3). See also page 95. 
22  
The QWERTY keyboard is often the standard example to illustrate this (Papert 1980: 33, 
Dennett 1995: 122-123, 131-133): Initially developed to slow down typing in order to prevent 
a clogging of the machinery, it became so successful that all alternative models have failed. 
The QWERTY meme, once invented for an old typewriter, can now be found everywhere 
(with some regional variation) on computers, cell phones and other electronic equipment. 
23  
The resistance to wearing expensive jewelry or watches can be seen as testifying to a con-
scious rejection of such mechanisms, and actually remains within the same pattern of think-
ing.

larly manipulative parasites infect fish, and mice, among other species. These hitchhikers 
cause their hosts to behave in unlikely –– even suicidal –– ways, all for the benefit of the 
guest, not the host. (Dennett 2006: 3-4) 
A suicide bomber may not increase his own biological fitness, but maybe his family 
benefits by gaining prestige. A priest who has sworn celibacy may be a biological 
dead-end, but maybe his family, too, has climbed the social ladder by having con-
tributed a holy man to society. There are many things in religion which can easily 
be explained by humans having evolved in small groups in a harsh environment 
filled with predators (Boyer 2001, Atran 2002). The death of a loved one is a para-
dox: On the one hand, the dead body is still the body once belonging to a dear per-
son, yet now it is a source for diseases. Separating the “spirit” from the body and 
performing a ritual may have perfect biological and social reasons (Boyer 2001: 
215-228). Likewise, seeing “faces in the clouds” (Guthrie 1993) may be a fitting 
example of a false positive created by our pattern-seeking mind (Shermer 2000: 34-
43). All this and more is perfectly reasonable, and still, could there also be an alter-
native explanation? Yes, culture has a biological basis. But has it not far outgrown 
that in many respects? Has there not emerged an alternative route of evolution for 
cultural artifacts and ideas themselves? 
The Selfish Phone Meme: Technological Evolution 
I am now using my fifth cell phone. The first was a big, clunky Motorola with a 
rather visible antenna. The second Motorola was sleeker, but still mimicked some 
features of the first model. Current makes have gotten even thinner, and a certain 
trend is visible. If cell phones were animals, one could suspect natural selection. Yet 
they aren’t –– so is there no selection? If there is, what is selected? The shape of 
the phone and its features are selected for or against by the market, and what is re-
fined is the bauplan of the phone. The memes behind it change, in competition with 
other memes. Trends are imitated and reinforce themselves. There is something 
that could be called “artificial selection:” A human designer consciously constructs 
something, and at the next opportunity, some features are reworked, etc. Yet not 
only is the product, once out “in the wild,” subjected to forces of competition not 
unlike those in a natural environment (a product has to compete with similar prod-
ucts, firms have to work not to be “eaten” by other firms, copyrights are protected 
to prevent theft and fraud of ideas); its very production process, too, is more com-
plex. Ideas usually come about not through fits of pure genius but as a result of a 
long process of trial and error, of processes of revision and variation. Almost al-
ways, there exist ideas that can easily be taken up and imitated, in part or in whole. 
The building blocks –– genes and memes respectively –– differ in form and func-
tion, but they both replicate, they both undergo processes of selection and interac-
tion through vehicles. 
Memes will oftentimes act together with genes in order to benefit the vehicle, 
the body, in which they are located. Yet their interest to be replicated –– again, 

 
Chapter 2: Seeing Things Differently

speaking metaphorically, as memes are probably not conscious –– may come to be 
at odds with the individual body, and the phenotypical expression of a meme may 
very well extend beyond a single individual. Because of that, some authors have 
argued in favor of seeing memes as symbiotes or parasites –– as Brodie (1996) puts 
it, they are “viruses of the mind.” Bearing in mind that what differentiates a parasite 
from a symbiote or a host is often a matter of degree24, and that some aspects of a 
meme or a memeplex may be beneficial to biological survival, this terminology may 
be helpful and has also been used in the context of religion by authors like Richard 
Dawkins (2006) and Daniel Dennett (2003, 2006). 
Religion from a Memetic Perspective 
Religion, especially in the Abrahamic context, but also in Hinduism and many other 
forms, and contrary to religious propaganda, actually praises suffering in the name 
of religion. The believer is said to be virtuous once undergoing and tolerating suf-
fering in the name of religion. Upon the non-believer, suffering is wished or actual-
ly imposed for not sharing one’s own religion. Examples abound, and are brought 
together, e.g. in Dawkins (2006), Harris (2004), Hitchens (2007) and –– especially 
in the context of witch hunts –– Sagan (1996), to only quote the most recent and 
notorious examples in the literature. Condoning or praising suffering goes against 
any biological instinct, and if persons do seek suffering, usually psychological de-
fects are assumed. Yet in the case of religious dogmatism (under which forms of 
nationalism or radical ideologies can be safely subsumed), biological instincts are 
deliberately violated. Physical suffering and self-sacrifice in the ultimate form (deli-
berate martyrdom, suicide, suicide attacks) constitute only the most drastic versions 
of a tendency to undervalue the individual human being in the context of “some-
thing greater.” Not without poignancy, in the film version of the Scopes Monkey 
Trial, the defense attorney provides an answer to the question of what would be 
holier than the “good book:” 
COL. BRADY: Is it possible that something is holy to the celebrated agnostic? 
COL. DRUMMOND: Yes. The individual human mind. In a child’s power to master the 
multiplication table there is more sanctity than in all your shouted amens and holy holies 
and hosannas. An idea is a greater monument than a cathedral. And the advance of man’s 
knowledge is a greater miracle than all the sticks turned to snakes or the parting of the wa-
ters. (Inherit the Wind, 94:14-94:48) 
                                                      
24  
Humans rely on a Vast number of bacteria and other microorganisms inside their body to 
survive successfully, yet these organisms are not seen as parasitical because they share the 
“agenda” of the human body: The death of the host will be their death, too. This is a deli-
cate balance that in cases of disease may be upset. Humans, however, in keeping livestock 
such as cattle, can be seen as being parasitical on cattle: The human interest in keeping the 
cattle alive goes only to a certain point. A replicator, however, can only be “parasitical” in 
relation to something else; from its own “perspective,” it only benefits its survival. 

36 
Part One: Of Myths and Memes 
 
The religious perspective may not necessarily forbid thinking, but at a crucial point, 
thinking has to be suspended for faith to set in –– and the “individual human 
mind” is seen as something that needs to be subjected to and colonized by religious 
thinking. Religious memes benefit themselves: Human agency, human individuality, 
human knowledge, human struggle –– all are seen as irrelevant if not perceived in 
the context of the respective religious outlook. Thou shalt not sin –– because we say 
so, because god says so, because the book says so, because your karma demands it –– because 
religion says so. Otherwise “moral” people are decried as immoral or condoning or 
inciting immorality if they admit to being atheists. Non-compliance with religion is 
seen as a sin in itself, so is apostasy, and not just in Islam. The origin of this may lie 
in the power of social control once exerted by religion (see the definition in 1.3.); 
but in most liberal democracies, religion and state have been separated. The original 
function is lost on the grand scheme (while being retained in parishes and parish-
centered communities or religiously inspired organizations), but the memetic power 
still flourishes. 
Religion guides the human perspective in conforming to certain anthropologi-
cal givens. It is not, however, a source of morality (this case is made by Dawkins 
(2006), Harris (2006), Hitchens (2007), amongst many others). Neither does it suc-
cessfully explain the world; on the contrary, it is a view of the world may be seen as 
in effect diminishing it (Dawkins 2006, 1998). Yet still, it is usually perceived as pos-
sessing explanatory power –– but for what? This will now be expanded below. 
2.2. Memetics as a Way of Seeing 
Theory in Literary and Cultural Studies 
Memetics constitutes a theory that –– while having originated from evolutionary 
biology –– concedes that culture may to a certain degree be maladaptive with respect 
to biology, yet not with respect to culture itself. In a larger picture, it is not just bi-
ology, but human beings themselves which may not be the recipient of cultural 
blessings at all. In this way, memetics means a way of seeing human culture as 
something that, while clearly tied to human nature and thinking, has a mind of its 
own, figuratively speaking. 
The function of theory (cf. Culler 1997: 1-16) can be understood as delivering 
an explanation of a phenomenon, but sometimes –– especially within literature and 
culture –– it can consist of offering another perspective, a different way of seeing, 
especially when no finally determining explanation is in sight.25 The benefit of me-
metic theory is that it fits rather elegantly into already existing models of cultural 
and literary theory that provide possibilities for consilience: history of ideas, Jung-
                                                      
25  
This, of course, holds true for the scientific view as well: scientifically gained knowledge is 
tentative, and subject to revision pending further discoveries and better explanatory mod-
els. 

 
Chapter 2: Seeing Things Differently 
37 
 
ian archetypes and other psycho-analytical readings as well as post-structuralism are 
theoretical models that abstract beyond the level of the human recipient and origi-
nator of culture. 
Memetics, now, is an as-if position, assuming culture to be beneficial for itself 
first and for all: Culture is perceived as if maximizing its own benefit. Cultural arti-
facts are specific to a cultural context, and they need not be necessarily tied to biol-
ogy. “Real life” is a material basis for culture, and culture may in turn influence 
“real life.” But culture also takes its cues from itself, from its stereotypes, from its 
established formats and genres, and generates audience expectations and viewing 
practices. 
For the ensuing discussion, memetics is applied in the context of a specific 
genre. Furthermore, religion herein is seen from an anthropological rather than a 
sociological or theological perspective26, following the current philosophical and 
scientific discourse that has arisen as an answer to the “intelligent design” move-
ment more than the functional understanding of religion found in the works of 
Émile Durkheim and his followers. 
The memetic perspective is a rather strict culture-immanent (or text-
immanent) perspective. It does not mean to say that there is no other way of seeing 
culture –– it is just one possible way of looking at things, in the hope that, by see-
ing things differently, new connections and new insights might occur.

26  
Of course one of the major criticisms waged against an anthropological/sociobiological 
and memetic perspective is that this kind of reading would more or less ignore theology, or 
more philosophically elaborate and transcendental interpretations of religion. The human 
impulse to seek out the numinous, the spiritual, the metaphysical, appears ill-served by an 
approach that paints religion as a viral memeplex preying upon unsuspecting, hopeful be-
lievers. Consequently, such “scientist” or “biologist” perspectives are oftentimes decried as 
“reductionism.” I am well aware that there exist interpretations of religion that are highly 
challenging, and highly philosophical (cf. Habermas 2008 to cite just one example). The 
reason I am following Dawkins et al. in their “reductionist” view, however, is that the more 
“appreciative” or outright apologetic yet still complex interpretations are mostly out of 
touch with the phenomena criticized: Surely, the vast majority of religious followers is 
peaceful, and well able to negotiate their religious identity with “normal” life. Yet the meta-
physical high road is not well travelled by “normal” religious practitioners, and the role of 
dogma and ritual in religious life should not be underestimated. Furthermore, the assault 
on religion by Dawkins et al. is mostly geared towards the extremely literalist fundamental-
ists of any persuasion, who would not be reached by more philosophical readings of reli-
gion either. Yet the extreme interpretations are nevertheless outcomes of less extreme, 
soft-core versions of religious practice. The oftentimes lacking criticism of fundamentalists 
by their less-extremist coreligionists is what taints official theology and dogma as apologet-
ic, thus proving Dawkins’ points made especially in his 2006 documentary Root of All Evil.

understood as a continuation of that line of thinking. Like post-structuralist theory, 
memetics does not deny individual agency.27 It also does not deny that human be-
ings in general assume to be in control of things. No one, or only a very few 
people, would actually want to believe they are not in control of things. How could 
an imaginary unit of cultural replication be controlling my thoughts and actions? 
Am I not in control? 
“I” actually do feel in control. But the “I” is a construction of the mind, a 
helpful, but not an unproblematic one. I, Philipp Kneis, am currently typing words 
that are visible on my computer screen, later on paper. I am thinking these things, 
typing them, they may or may not end up in the final version. Yet I did not invent 
the English language. I did not invent the computer. Neither did I build the com-
puter. I did not invent memetics, nor did I create the television shows I write 
about. I did not invent academic writing but have seen others do it and mimic their 
style in part. I do cite my sources, at least the ones I know about. I might be citing 
things unwillingly. Some things are just “discourse,” they are “in the air.” I chose to 
incorporate the current debate on religion, but how could I not? I could hardly not 
have noticed it. How could I have missed shows like Star Trek or The X-Files or any 
of the others? So, what exactly am I authoring? This text here is a distinct thing. 
But it is composed of little things not my own. All I can do is create new combina-
tions, thus, pardon the Star Trek reference, creating one instance amongst an infini-
ty of diversity in an infinity of combinations. I am an agent of selection: I choose 
whom to cite and whom not, whom to talk about and whom not. How free am I in 
this choice?28 
My, or any other author’s choice, is limited. Post-structuralist theory tells us 
that already, especially when Wimsatt & Beardsley in their outline of the Intentional 
Fallacy reduce the importance of the author of a piece of literature by stating that 
“[c]ritical inquiries are not settled by consulting the oracle” (18), or when Barthes 
calls the author “dead” (1977: 142-148) and can only safely point to a scriptor or 
                                                      
27  
That is following what David Lehman (1991: 121-124) calls “Soft-Core Deconstruction.” 
For a deconstruction of more “hard core” versions of post-structuralist theory, cf. Lehman 
(1991), but also Lingua Franca (2000), Sokal and Bricmont (1998), Gross and Levitt (1998). 
28  
Furthermore, the I that is reading this text after a while may find it strange and not neces-
sarily have any recollection of having written it. “Past I” is linked with “Present I” and “Fu-
ture I” through a construction of the self, continually performed and expressed –– and 
constructed artificially (cf. Dennett 1991:412-430, which, of course, follows a long philo-
sophical tradition outlined therein).

writer (147). Memetics just goes one step further. In proposing a “selfish meme” 
view, cultural evolution is given as much depth as its biological counterpart. 
Cui Bono? 
The traditional view sees a text as good for something, or related to human expe-
rience. There is nothing wrong with such a view, of course. Texts can perform 
functions, and human experiences are what fuels literature and culture. Yet given 
the complexities of human consciousness, underlying trends in history, and compli-
cations already exposed by psychoanalysis and post-structuralism, is it really suffi-
cient to adhere to a merely human-based approach to culture? 
In the context of the television genre parts of which I am about to dissect, 
one could argue that if there are similarities, it could be said that some producers 
and writers just consciously imitate what others do, that they rip off someone else’s 
work. This, however, does not contradict the memetic view, on the contrary: Ob-
viously, imitation is indeed going on. Yet there appears to be an imitation of very 
specific things, and a convergence on certain commonalities: Memetic drive creates a 
specific memeplex. It could furthermore be said that similar production conditions 
produce similar results. This would not counteract the argument, it would just as-
sume imitation at a higher level.

The next part will be dedicated to five case studies representing the memeplex of 
the Mythological Genre. Memetic theory will be applied in these chapters occasio-
nally, but especially in the concluding Chapters 9 and 10.

3. ERRAND INTO THE DARKNESS: TRUTH AND LIES 
ON THE X-FILES & MILLENNIUM 
There can be no doubt that the cult of death and the insistence upon portents of the end proceed from a surreptitious 
desire to see it happen, and to put an end to the anxiety and doubt that always threaten the hold of faith. When 
the earthquake hits, or the tsunami inundates, or the twin towers ignite, you can see and hear the secret satisfaction 
of the faithful. Gleefully they strike up: “You see, this is what happens when you don’t listen to us!” With an 
unctuous smile they offer a redemption that is not theirs to bestow and, when questioned, put on the menacing scowl 
that says, “Oh, so you reject our offer of paradise? Well, in that case we have quite another fate in store for you.” 
Such love! Such care!

Outline: The religious nature of the Mythological Genre is established with the ex-
amples of The X-Files and Millennium. The “Errand into the Wilderness” is intro-
duced as a central motif throughout the genre. Issues of emancipation, truth and 
science are raised, as well as fantasies of the end of the world. 
3.1. Exposition: The X-Files & Millennium 
Chris Carter had been writing for Surfing magazine before turning to television. He 
is better known, though, for creating one of the cornerstone television shows of 
the 1990s, The X-Files, which ran from 1993-2002 and trailed the investigations of a 
team of FBI agents into the realms of the so-called paranormal, culminating in an 
elaborate mythology which narrates the fight against a vast conspiracy between 
humans and extraterrestrials and which could mean the end of the world as we 
know it. The series also featured a trademark cinematographic look creating a dark, 
atmospheric suspense-filled cinematic quality which it transmitted to a related series 
also created by Chris Carter et al., Millennium (1996-1999). In this even darker show, 
the former (and since the third season again active) FBI agent Frank Black deals 
with similar issues, yet the religious elements are stronger, and the extraterrestrial 
components are left out. The main thread in Millennium is a fictitious secret cult, the 
Millennium Group, which specializes in dealing with matters of the end of the world 
(and, as it turns out, with trying to bring it about), yet due to the early cancellation 
of the show, the resolution of the millennium 2000 story arc occurs in an episode 
of The X-Files (7.04 “Millennium”) in which the protagonists of both series meet 
and by which both shows are officially connected as sharing one central mytholo-
gy.29

A third show could be said to complement the franchise, namely The Lone Gunmen. Also 
created by Chris Carter, it shares the visual look-and-feel and the conspiratorial nature of 
The X-Files and Millennium. Its genre, however, is largely comedy, and the issues discussed 
therein are oftentimes rather different from those of the other shows in many respects. The

3.2. Franchise-Specific Themes 
The Doors of Perception at the Frontier 
FRANK: Over 500 years ago, a man named Petrarch climbed a mountain just to see the 
view. It was a new kind of thinking that became the beginning of the Renaissance. The 
name of that mountain was Ventoux. (MLM 2.12 “Luminary,” 40:49) 
The Millennium episode “Luminary” tells the story of a young boy who, giving him-
self the name Alex Ventoux in reference to (and reverence of) Petrarch, ventures 
out into the Alaskan wilderness to find both himself and a purpose. Frank Black 
sets out to recover him, and in the course of this Errand comes to terms with the 
role of the Millennium group. 
«««»»» 
STONER: I saw it on the … Discovery Channel. They got like this whole, you know, cult 
built up around these tree toads. The skin’s got these hallucinogenic properties. Lets you 
see all these visions. It’s really spiritual. […] It’s supposed to take the doors of perception 
and swing them so wide open, you know? Plus you get to see all these cool streaks and 
trails and crap. [Licks the toad] (X 3.22 “Quagmire,” 16:35-17:28) 
The “doors of perception” are opened towards nature in the X-Files episode 
“Quagmire,” which has Mulder and Scully investigating strange deaths in and in the 
vicinity of fictitious Heuvelman Lake, which is famous for allegedly hosting the 
lake monster Big Blue. For the aptly named youth Stoner, the investigation of na-
ture holds a “spiritual” component –– yet he seems to need drugs for his kick, even 
if it be through physical contact with nature by licking a toad –– an apparently oral 
fixation which is probably not an accidental gesture but holds the potential for re-
velation just as kissing a frog in a fairy-tale might conjure up a prince. Not acciden-
tally, religious rituals, too, are connected to drug use –– ritualized or real. Just as the 
Oracle at Delphi probably utilized hallucinogens to benefit her predictions, and as 
incense, candles and music perform what Susan Blackmore calls the “beauty trick” 
(189) of religions today, the mind is being put into a specific state to enter the 
world of the “spiritual.” For Mulder, however, the investigation itself is his own 
spiritual quest. In the process of his search, he and Scully charter a boat at night, 
which sinks, and they subsequently find themselves on an island in the lake, leading 
to the following interchange, which constitutes one of the most concise explora-
tions of what the series is about: 
MULDER: […] you know, livin’ in the city, you forget that night is actually so, uh, dark. 
SCULLY: Living in the city you forget a lot of things. You know, there you’re always think-
ing about being mugged or hit by a car. It’s not until you get back to nature until you real-
ize that everything is out to get you. That’s what my father always taught me –– to respect 
nature, ‘cause it has no respect for you. […] Mulder, what are we doing here? 
                                                                                                                                                                      
justification for jumbling together The X-Files and Millennium into one chapter is their 
common production team, common philosophical outlook, and generally shared universe. 

 
Chapter 3: Errand into the Darkness

MULDER: What do you mean, “what are we doing here?” 
SCULLY: What are you hoping to accomplish? 
MULDER: Scully, so many of the things we investigate are so intangible. But this creature 
exists within the specific earthly confines of this lake, and I want to find it. 
SCULLY: What for? 
MULDER: You’re a scientist. Why do you ask that question? It would be a miraculous dis-
covery. It could revolutionize evolutionary biological thinking. 
SCULLY: Is that really the reason why? [Mulder sighs] You know when you showed me 
those [blurry and shaky] pictures that the photographer took [of what he thought was Big 
Blue]? You wanna know what I really saw in them? […] That man is your future –– listen-
ing only to himself, hoping to catch a glimpse of the truth for who knows what reason. […] 
My father used to read to me from Moby-Dick when I was a little girl. I called him “Ahab,” 
and he called me “Starbuck.” So I named my dog Queequeg. That’s funny. I just realized 
something. […] How much you’re like Ahab. You’re so consumed by your personal ven-
geance against life, whether it be its inherent cruelties or its mysteries that everything takes 
on a warped significance to fit your megalomaniacal cosmology. […] It’s just –– The truth 
or a white whale –– what difference does it make? I mean –– both obsessions are impossi-
ble to capture, and trying to do so will only leave you dead along with everyone else you 
bring with you. You know, Mulder, you are Ahab. 
MULDER: You know, it’s interesting you should say that, because I’ve always wanted a 
peg leg. It’s a boyhood thing I never grew out of. No, I’m not being flippant. I mean, I’ve 
given this a lot of thought. If you have a peg leg or hooks for hands, you know, maybe it’s 
enough to simply carry on living –– you know, bravely facing life with your disability. It’s 
heroic just to survive. But without these things, you’re actually expected to make something 
of your life –– achieve something, earn a raise, wear a necktie. So-So-So, if anything, I’m 
actually the antithesis of Ahab, because if I did have a peg leg I’d quite possibly be more 
happy and more content and not feel the need to chase after these creatures of the un-
known. (X 3.22 “Quagmire,” 27:25-32:52) 
When Scully’s father is identified with Ahab and she with Starbuck, and when she 
later on compares Mulder to Ahab as well, this might make Mulder a father figure 
–– which he denies. His rejection of the Ahab image can furthermore be read as a 
rejection of masculine role models, which underlines the gender-bending setup of 
The X-Files: Scully holds the traditionally “male,” skeptical, scientific position, while 
Mulder plays the traditionally “female,” gullible, emotional part. That the first vic-
tim of the monster is the dog Queequeg, named after the “primitive” harpooner of 
the Pequod (named himself after the Pequot tribe) in Moby-Dick, underlines the hie-
rarchy between civilization and wilderness further. In the end, Mulder does capture 
a lake monster that is charging him. He shoots it, only to discover it to be an alliga-
tor. His disappointment is not lost on Scully, who questions him afterwards: 
SCULLY: Well, you slew the big white whale, Ahab. […] How can you be disappointed? 
[…] 
MULDER: I guess I just wanted Big Blue to be real. I guess I see hope in such a possibili-
ty. 
SCULLY: Well, there’s still hope. That’s why these myths and stories have endured. People 
want to believe. 
Big Blue appears in the lake after they’ve turned away. (X 3.22 “Quagmire,” 41:02-42:12) 

46 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
Herein, the religious nature of Mulder’s quest is poignantly emphasized: Big Blue 
stands for the archaic, the primal and the mythical –– for something that preceded 
human civilization. Hope, for Mulder, is derived from the notion that all the de-
structive potential of humanity may not be total; and that there are still things to 
discover. The closing of the “frontier” (Turner 1893) is ameliorated by the assumed 
existence of new, old things still within the realm of the allegedly known –– and his 
quest to find them is an empowering gesture. Also, just as Big Blue stands outside 
the known and explained, Mulder himself wants to rid himself of the governing 
hierarchies, be they in the realm of gender or class or government. 
Errand into the Wilderness 
Cultural artifacts are specific to the culture that produces them. As an American 
television show, The X-Files naturally plays on themes specific to an American dis-
course. There is a strong fascination with utopian fiction in a country like the Unit-
ed States whose very foundation was crafted by men contemplating utopian 
thoughts from two directions, the one being political philosophy by Plato (cf. 
Kneis 2010b) and his successors, made manifest within Christian culture; the other 
the myth of the Noble Savage later connected to Rousseau, but also influenced by 
myths of a Golden Age as old as Hesiod, at least. Both have led to a fusion of ideas 
from Antiquity, the League of the Haudenosaunee (Weatherford 1988: 133-150, 
Johanson 1998) and political thought from England, France, and the Thirteen Co-
lonies. Rousseauvian philosophy (which later influenced New Age thinking) is ac-
companied (and initially preceded) by a second tradition in the United States, reli-
gious fundamentalism. Not a thing of the political founding fathers, who have 
mostly been agnostic, atheist, or deist (Dawkins 2006: 38-46; Mills 2006: 204-207), 
it has influenced the cultural imagination through Puritan ideas which were, and 
continue to be, highly influential in the shaping of American culture. It is the motif 
of the Errand which lends itself to a second strong fascination in American culture, 
found throughout the Mythological Genre. 
Following Matthew 11, 7-9, Samuel Danforth (1670) described the Errand in-
to the Wilderness in his influential sermon as the search for something in the desert 
that may bring hope or salvation: 
What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind? But what went 
ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing, are 
in Kings houses. But what went ye out for to see? A Prophet? yea, I say unto you, and 
more than a Prophet. 
Danforth explains how this text is to announce the importance of John the Baptist, 
and how the steadfastness of John is illustrated by contrasting him with a “reed 
shaken in the wind” –– something with an obvious negative connotation, for true 
belief does not waver or bend to the circumstances, however wild they may be, 
however deserted the place. 

 
Chapter 3: Errand into the Darkness

The English translation offers “wilderness” where Latin has desertum and the 
original Greek speaks of erêmon –– desert, something deserted, empty, nothingness, 
loneliness: something empty of culture. This could be very well understood to 
mean wilderness, and in the context of the Bible, both “Old” and New Testament 
stories, it very literally means desert on most occasions. American tales most often 
substitute the woods for the desert, as initially colonization happened in the forests 
which, after having been groomed and cultivated by Native American tribes for 
millennia, now were left to become “wilderness” (Weatherford 1991: 37-47). Wil-
derness in the forest is an idea that had nothing to do with the life of Indian tribes; 
it is something created by the cultural imaginary captured and influenced initially by 
religious tales of heathens and otherness used to legitimize conquest, and later by 
Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his followers. The idea of a strict boundary between 
nature and culture (which in current New Age dogma is postulated in order to be 
“overcome”) is based on making nature more “wild” and humankind more “civi-
lized” than they really are. While the dichotomy of nature versus civilization is older 
than New Age thought, it has always had one function: To justify the process of 
“civilizing” in the name of overcoming the alleged barbarism of nature (and indi-
genes; cf. Kneis 2010c).  
«««»»» 
This barbarism is found within two kinds of nature –– external and internal. The 
fight against the barbarism of the soul is a jihad or crusade30 which is similarly em-
phasized. This “inner wilderness” is illustrated by the theme of homo homini lupus31 
that is taken up continually in the Mythological Genre, as illustrated by the answer 
to Mulder’s question to the local Fish & Game officer: 
MULDER: Are you aware of any indigenous species capable of attacking a human being? 
DR. FARADAY: Yes. Another human being. (X 3.22 “Quagmire,” 5:51-6:00) 
The Errand is a crusade against that which is not civilized; that which is not civi-
lized is amoral, pre-moral, heathen, heretic, or simply alien. The Errand, however, 
is also a fight against false authority of the kind that is “clothed in soft raiment,” 
which is contrasted with John the Baptist. Following Danforth (3), 
John Preached in the Wilderness, which was no fit place for silken and soft raiment. His 
work was to prepare a people for the Lord, by calling them off from worldly pomp and 
                                                      
30  
The term jihad could actually be seen as more fitting than crusade, as jihad is commonly un-
derstood more as an introspective activity: the great jihad, al-jihad al-akbar, in contrast to the 
small one, denotes an inward struggle for self-improvement, the search for truth and god. 
Only the smaller form, al-jihad al-asghar, means “holy war” in the sense of crusade. With that 
differentiation in mind, I will nevertheless predominantly use crusade in order to emphasize 
the Christian component.

Hobbes used the Plautian proverb “man is to man like a wolf” in his preface to De Cive 
(1651) to illustrate the (assumed) natural state of societies removed from the protection of 
the state.

vanities, unto repentance and mourning for sin. His peculiar habit and diet was such as be-
came a penitentiary Preacher. 
In this, John is different from Jesus, “a man gluttonous, and a winebibber” (Mat-
thew 11.19), who was known for not refusing a good meal for either himself or his 
apostles, and for not damning “worldly” pleasures as much as the ascetic John. 
This is recognized by Danforth and immediately dismissed (18). By following the 
model of John, and by modeling Jesus upon John, Danforth also makes the con-
nection to “Old” Testament mythology clear: the Errand is akin to the exodus 
from Egypt; and the “worldly pomp” connects to the Golden Calf. The reliance on 
the “Old” Testament and its oftentimes rather stark moralistic in-group/out-group, 
comfort-denying philosophy is characteristic for a specifically American Protestant-
ism that has shaped the American cultural imaginary. The Golden Calf and Baal 
stand for the pompous, the vanity-oriented, the god-less and unholy: not acciden-
tally, the Goa’uld version of Baal on Stargate: SG-1 follows just that stereotype. 
Then Danforth waxes on at length about the good old days of true worship, ex-
horting the pews to follow the tried and true model, “To excite and stir us all up to 
attend and prosecute our Errand into the Wilderness” (18), from rags not to riches 
but to piety and salvation. 
Errand into the Darkness 
Mulder’s “I want to believe,” Scully’s struggle with her Catholic faith, Frank Black’s 
struggle for his family against the powers of darkness –– all these can be seen as 
manifestations of this very Errand into the Wilderness, which oftentimes turns out 
to be a voyage into the heart of darkness. This Errand into the Darkness is consti-
tutive for the Mythological Genre in general, and more specifically for horror. 
This does not mean that there is a Dantesque “abandon all hope” written all 
over the genre, and even though things might look bleak, resistance to the truth, 
which will oftentimes turn out to be very dark indeed, will only keep the searcher in 
a state of denial, prolonging and thus increasing pain and suffering. The agony of 
not knowing is greater than the agony of knowing; at least in knowing, the true 
fight, the agôn, can begin. The X-Files makes this very explicit in its tradition of end-
ing each title sequence with a quote. While the majority of all episodes carries the 
optimistic heading “The Truth Is Out There,” other opening tags can be seen, 
ranging from the gloomy “Trust No One” (1.23), “Everything Dies” (4.01), “Be-
lieve the Lie” (4.24) to the more uplifting and engaging “All Lies Lead to the 
Truth” (5.02) and even “Dio Ti Ama” (“God Loves You,” 9.13). The tagline of the 
1998 film, “Fight the Future,” set between seasons 5 and 6, captures Fox Mulder’s 
and Frank Black’s quest perfectly. Both set out to prevent massive conspiracies of 
apocalyptic dimensions, and in the X-Files episode 7.04 “Millennium” they even 
join forces. Throughout their fight, they venture into the heart of darkness time 
and again. One ongoing topic is that of serial killers, others concern monsters, de-
mons, and paranormal phenomena. Where Millennium goes deeper into investigat-

 
Chapter 3: Errand into the Darkness 
49 
 
ing a fictitious religious cult, the “Millennium Group,” The X-Files is concerned 
with an overarching story of alien invasion. In both cases, there are willing and un-
willing collaborators on the “other” side. Most collaborators aren’t necessarily 
“evil” but follow all too human interests. Where this interest may take us as human 
beings, into which depths, is the focus of the franchise. 
The Errand into the Darkness is an investigation of the unconscious and re-
pressed, an acknowledgement of the sublime indifference (and even threat) of na-
ture in general, and the darkness of human nature and culture in particular, namely 
the human capacity for evil. Following religious mythology, that darkness is not 
ascribed to a sadistic god, whereas good things are often claimed to be the work of 
a benevolent (Christian) god (cf. Mills 2006, 158-166). Bad things are the work of 
dark forces (demons and devils32, aliens) or human beings (independently or in ca-
hoots with dark forces). 
Forcing the End 
In the end, hope is the key to prevailing. Against all odds, hope in overcoming the 
impending doom is in line with trusting the soteriological promise that Jesus will be 
there with “us” “till the end of the age” (Matthew 28.20). For some, this means a 
certainty that in “forcing the end” (Millennium ep. 3.15), the realm of “darkness” 
will be followed by a realm of “light.” This premillennialist belief, which consists in 
anxiously awaiting the Second Coming (cf. Ruse 2005, 22-27), denigrates human 
agency to that of mere compliance with external forces. People are cogs in the ma-
chinery of Armageddon. The X-Files and Millennium, in presenting their own night-
marish visions of the coming end, provide a commentary to the various beliefs in 
apocalyptic scenarios and the imminent coming of the “savior.” 
Like within “real-life” cults, be it the long tradition of apocalyptic thoughts 
collected by Daniel Wojcik (1999), or current apocalyptical scenarios (cf. Hitchens 
2007, Harris 2004, Dawkins 2006), there are people like Fox Mulder and Frank 
Black trying to prevent the “apocalypse” –– and those working towards bringing it 
about. The motivation for that may be resignation in the face of apparently inevita-
ble doom, as in the case of the X-Files shadow government conspiracy that aims to 
soften the effects of alien invasion by setting up an underground version of the 
Vichy government. Another motivation, however, is the sado-masochistic relishing 
in bringing about the end in order to see the suffering of “sinners,” and with the 
hope of coming out on the right side in the end. The very idea of rapture, an imme-
diate ascension of the righteous into heaven on the day of the Second Coming, is 
connected with the joy of seeing those who do not share one’s own righteous be-
liefs and practices burn in hell. To see everything man-made go up in flames, or 
just merely icons, is an impulse that could have been observed in the aftermath of 
9/11, as several commentators (e.g. Baudrillard 2001) assumed an unconscious 
                                                      
32  
The concept of demons will be more thoroughly discussed in Chapter 5. 

50

wish of seeing icons of the modern world destroyed. Religious observers especially 
(Hitchens 2007: 60, see above), but not exclusively, appear to lack compassion with 
others, the very compassion they usually boast to be making up the core of their 
religion of salvation, when it comes to questions of going to heaven or to hell. The 
distinct aesthetic pleasure derived from seeing those believed to be unworthy burn 
for eternity is apparently too strong to be ameliorated by the wish to be good. If 
the belief in god is the only thing holding some believers back, the promise of god’s 
wrath appears as a welcome opportunity to unleash the human potential for de-
struction. In the Millennium group, strong religious belief and strong belief in law 
and order combine to create a cult of doomsday. 
What is Religious About It? 
Free will, according to these believers, is subjected to the actions of larger forces 
who treat the universe as a playground. This may very well follow the postulate of 
an omniscient and omnipotent god33, in which human beings are part of a divine 
plan of “salvation.” On the other hand, this is highly contradictory regarding the 
“problem” of sin: For being able to sin, we have to be able to make decisions. The 
very concept of sin presupposes agency and the will to accept or reject the divine 
plan.34 
In this sense, what is being fought by fighting premillennial conspirators is 
Christian heresy masquerading as fundamentalism (i.e. devout accordance with 
Christian principles according to self-given “fundamentals”). Heresy, of course, is 
always relative. The heretic believes to be the true believer, most of the time, self-
proclaimed heresy is rather an anarchist move. So, heretic in contrast to what, or 
more specifically, to whom? Neither Mulder nor Frank are very religious, and Scul-
ly is a struggling Catholic. Only Lara Means on Millennium is shown as religious, but 
it is made clear that she becomes insane. Frank has visions, sort of, which are 
sometimes explained as a “gift,” while at other times they appear to be a visualiza-
tion of his thinking process. What both series’ protagonists have in common is an 
inquisitive, scientific viewpoint. Even despite the occurrence of every possible 
pseudoscientific phenomenon on either series, there is a focus on investigation, on

However, omniscience and omnipotence rule each other out: If god knows everything, 
past, present, future, as all has already happened, this means he cannot change it, any action 
would be an illusion. If he is omnipotent, he may change everything, but he then will no 
longer know everything, as things are no longer predictable. Omniscience would bind his 
omnipotence. (Dawkins 2006: 77-78)

On the other hand, the practice of baptizing babies hints at a two-fold approach: The baby 
surely cannot decide for herself. “Saving” the baby by baptism means salvation from “orig-
inal” sin, a burden each human being supposedly carries from birth, and preemptively 
marking the baby’s soul as belonging to Jesus. This could be seen as a safeguard, and it 
does not absolve the baby, once grown up to be an adult, from committing to dogma and 
gospel.

proving hypotheses materially. Mulder, in many ways, is a paranoid lunatic who be-
lieves in anything weird; but he needs Scully because he is interested in proving the 
existence of the paranormal, in claiming the paranormal for the realm of science. 
Frank wants to collect evidence, physical proof. Second, there’s the motif of hope 
that’s already been laid out. 
Scientific materialism and positivism (bordering on scientism) in combination 
with optimism reveal a postmillennial belief in the faculty of mankind to solve 
problems. Destiny is human-made. Things do not get worse over time, nor do they 
stay stagnant. They get better, they evolve, in a “positive” direction. This is the lay 
meaning of evolution, while evolution in itself, technically, is not directional, not 
leading to something better per se, but adaptational. Belief in evolution to bring out 
the positive is evolutionism (Ruse 2005: 281-288). 
The role nature plays in the franchise (and throughout most of the genre), and 
the many secret forces and beings at work, add something of an animist or panthe-
ist level. There is an underlying Native American theme. Fox Mulder’s first name 
even has an Indian ring to it: 
ISH: I sense you are different, F.B.I. You’re more open to Native American belief than 
some Native Americans. You even have an Indian Name –– “Fox.” You should be “Run-
ning Fox” or “Sneaky Fox.” 
MULDER: Just as long as it’s not “Spooky Fox.” (X 1.19 “Shapes” 30:28-30:51) 
Frank Black has Crow ancestry. The function of the Navajo and the Anasazi story-
line is central to the entire plot of The X-Files. Nature, in this sense, is the sublime 
(cf. Burke 1757), but also the place of the divine. There is talk of a higher power, 
but only on an inspirational level. Ancestors are a central theme, and so is the re-
liance on oral (personal) history and interpretation over written history (or rather: 
historiography): 
ALBERT HOSTEEN: There is an ancient Indian saying that something lives only as long 
as the last person who remembers it. My people have come to trust memory over history. 
Memory, like fire, is radiant and immutable while history serves only those who seek to 
control it, those who douse the flame of memory in order to put out the dangerous fire of 
truth. Beware these men for they are dangerous themselves and unwise. Their false history 
is written in the blood of those who might remember and of those who seek the truth. (X 
3.01 “The Blessing Way” 0:00-0:49) 
This is further developed into a more directly religious perspective: 
SCULLY: You’ve always said that you wanna believe. But believe in what, Mulder? […] 
MULDER: I wanna believe that the dead are not lost to us, that they speak to us as part of 
something greater than us, greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless 
now, I wanna believe that if we listen to what’s speaking, it can give us the power to save 
ourselves. 
SCULLY: Then we believe the same thing. 
MULDER (touches her crucifix necklace). Maybe there’s hope. (X 9.19-20 “The Truth” 80:14-
82:15) 

52 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
All in all, this creates a mixture of scientism, optimism, pantheism and deism, Na-
tive American and Christian traditions –– a very American mixture, and also the 
basis for what can be seen in the founding documents of the American Republic. 
The investigation of the paranormal thus is not just a version of the Errand, it also 
follows from the ideology of the frontier: To boldly go where “civilization” (as we 
know it) has not gone before. The frontier, nowadays, cannot anymore be seen as 
something separating known and conquered territory from lands unknown (to 
some) and yet to be conquered on Earth. It is either situated in outer space, or –– 
in combination with the Errand –– constitutes a moral or scientific frontier to be 
conquered and transgressed. 
This also explains why, in contrast to one form of conspiracy theories, the 
enemy of the state is not really the state itself, but a shadow government, or forces 
operating within the government. The system is not at fault per se, but it is being 
exploited by others. The political component of the heresy is directed against prime 
American values: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
All taken together, it could thus be proposed that the actual religious back-
ground being defended on the show against threatening heresies is the American 
Civil Religion (Bellah 1967). 
The Truth is Out There 
“The truth is out there” is the overarching motto of The X-Files, making the search 
for the truth itself the central occupation of the show. The religious character of 
that quest has already been established. Truth is a two-fold concept herein, carrying 
a concrete and a general meaning. 
The concrete religious meaning in a Christian context, in the sense of “the 
truth shall make you free,” constitutes not a general appreciation of “truth” or 
“freedom,” but a more specific exhortation to remain within Christ’s teachings: 
Jesus then said to those Jews who believed in him, “If you remain in my word [logos], you 
will truly be my disciples, and you will know the truth [alêtheia], and the truth will set you 
free.” (John 8.31-32, New American Version) 
Truth, in this sense, means to remain within the established world/word/logos of 
Christianity, a steadfast adherence to faith. The many occasions in which Scully’s 
Catholic faith is probed attest to this. Like the apostle Thomas, she needs evidence 
(John 20.19-29). Faith suffices for her only on a general level, not as a direct belief 
in dogma and miracles. In the very last scene of The X-Files, the little cross she 
wears around her neck is not only displayed prominently but also held by Mulder 
appreciatively. In this context, however, “The Truth” refers to the “truth” of extra-
terrestrial life on Earth, to the reality of the conspiracy, of alien abductions, 
U.F.O.s and lots of paranormal claims. By bringing the two “gospels” together, the 
religious quality of the U.F.O. movement is made clear as well. 

 
Chapter 3: Errand into the Darkness 
53 
 
Apart from these concrete “truths,” truth in general is what is aimed at during 
the examination of various odd and paranormal cases, and it is seen as the counter-
point to lies, obscurity, and not-knowing. This is related to the quest of the Errand, 
and the general quest of science and the scientific method, especially within the 
F.B.I. 
The meditative and philosophical nature of that quest is illustrated by renais-
sance men like Fox Mulder and Frank Black: jacks of all trades with a genuine in-
terest in enhancing the ways of seeing and understanding that are employed in con-
temporary culture35, wise men who are pure of heart in their quest for truth, know-
ledge, and universal betterment. Just as in the Millennium episode “Luminary,” as 
quoted above, Frank Black is depicted as a modern-day Petrarch, Mulder’s quixotic 
quest is ennobled by his search and dedication to the truth and makes him a prefi-
guration of Frank. 
Pseudoscience as Subject to Science 
BLAINE FAULKNER: Roswell! Roswell! (X 3.20 “Jose Chung’s From Outer Space” 
27:09-27:10) 
On a first glance, pseudoscience is the focus of The X-Files and Millennium. Mulder’s 
quest leads the audience on a wild ride featuring all kinds of unnatural phenomena. 
The series constitute a haven for any imaginable pseudoscientific idea. Frank 
Black’s investigation into the Millennium group is marred by strange religious por-
tents and the occurrence of demons, devils and angels. On a narrative level, how-
ever, pseudoscience on The X-Files has to subject itself to verification by Dr. Scul-
ly’s scientific standards, which makes her perspective the guiding one, overall. 
Scully does not believe in spite of evidence, but through evidence only. The 
“paranormal” thus is transferred from the level of being “para-” into the “normal,” 
the observable, the provable realm of science: once science can confirm the “para-
normal” to exist, it would simply become normal. Yes, the paranormal is claimed as 
existing. But the framing of that process is done with the help of the scientific me-
thod. Scully remains a scientist throughout, she accepts certain “paranormal” ele-
ments only after critical inspection. Both Mulder’s and Scully’s interest can be 
called scientific insofar as they are interested in truly investigating these phenome-
na, and not accepting hearsay but hard evidence only. If, during this process, a pa-
ranormal phenomenon can be explained, it becomes scientific fact (at least on tele-
vision). 
Standard myths of pseudoscience would then be elevated to science, as we 
will see in the chapter on the Stargate franchise, which will feature a more lengthy 
                                                      
35  
This motif holds true also for Star Trek: Voyager concerning the person of the Doctor, e.g. 
in episode 7.24 “Renaissance Man.” Voyager also features Leonardo Da Vinci as a recurring 
holodeck character. In many ways, Captain Picard from Star Trek: The Next Generation could 
be said to represent such a persona as well.

discussion of various pseudoscientific elements. On Millennium, the scientific pers-
pective is not specifically personified by a regular cast member, yet it is built into 
the investigative mode. 
Thus, even while showcasing numerous pseudoscientific and paranormal 
icons, on a narrative level, the scientific focus is stronger –– clearly providing 
science with more authority than pseudoscience. 
So, do pseudoscience and religion prevail? On the contrary: fate and destiny 
on a global scale are routinely averted. The “predictions” of religious fanatics and 
serial killers turn out to be either figments of their imagination, or combatable sce-
narios. Destiny can be defied –– and thus ceases to be destiny. Just like with real-
life cults of doom, all dates given for the end of the world fail to deliver. Human 
beings and not the forces of either “darkness” or “light” are in control.

4. BETWEEN THE DARKNESS AND THE LIGHT: 
PROPHECY AND THE SELF ON BABYLON 5 
A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal, as gently 
as we awake from dreams. Now, the world would be insane and rabid, if these disorganizations should last for 
hundreds of years. It is kept in check by death and infancy. Infancy is the perpetual Messiah, which comes into the 
arms of fallen men, and pleads with them to return to paradise.
 
 –– Ralph Waldo Emerson. Nature. 465. 
Outline: Babylon 5 is an epic text making use of prophecies and deep historical 
structuring. This undermines the obvious narration of the fight against destiny. 
Christian and messianic themes are shown. The Babylon 5 version of Pantheism 
hovers between the Cave metaphor and memetics.  
4.1. Exposition: Babylon 5 & Crusade 
The Babylon 5 franchise tells the epic story of the forging of an Interstellar Alliance 
during the fight against a vastly superior enemy. The story begins with the estab-
lishment of the space station Babylon 5, an interstellar enterprise under Earth lea-
dership which is said to be “our last, best hope for peace,” clearly referring to the 
League of Nations and the United Nations. From the start, a coherent narrative is 
being constructed that involves the step-by-step introduction of the main foe, the 
Shadows, which constitute one of two superior races of “ancient” beings in the ga-
laxy, and which have remained there to watch over the “younger races.” The other 
ancient race are the Vorlons, of whom one member, Kosh, is stationed on Babylon 
5. The Shadows believe in order through chaos. For the purpose of creating that 
chaos, they incite wars and civil wars throughout the galaxy. One of their allies is 
the Psi Corps, an Earth institution which controls all Earth telepaths. It is with the 
help of the Psi Corps that a coup takes place under Vice President Morgan Clark, 
who after the assassination of President Santiago becomes president and continual-
ly strengthens his power. The declaration of martial law leads to Babylon 5 break-
ing away from Earth in a civil war. Earth’s alliance with the Shadows comes to an 
end with the recapturing of Earth by the forces of the Alliance forged by Sheridan, 
and both Shadows and Vorlons are expelled from the galaxy. 
Sheridan himself gets killed at the end of season 3, but is revived and develops 
into a kind of spiritual leader. He is elected President of the Interstellar Alliance. As 
a consequence of the Shadow War, many nations that once allied themselves with 
the Shadows (often out of necessity), are still controlled by former agents of the 
Shadows. The Centauri are one such nation, and it is due to the alliance with the 
Shadows that Centauri Prime will be destroyed. Another consequence is the infec-
tion of Earth with a deadly virus by agents of the Shadows, the Drakh. This was 

56

the starting point for the short-lived series Crusade, which saw its beginning in the 
fourth television film, A Call To Arms, produced after the five-season run of B5 
had come to an end. More Babylon 5 projects include the pilot for a third series (The 
Legend of the Rangers, which was not made), and a failed motion picture project. A 
made-for-DVD special, Babylon 5: The Lost Tales, has been released in 2007. 
4.2. Franchise-Specific Themes 
Rediscovering the Epic on Television 
VIR: Prophecy is a guess that comes true. When it doesn’t, it’s a metaphor. (B5 5.02 “The 
Very Long Night of Londo Mollari,” 27:18-27:24) 
The epic structure of the Babylon 5 franchise presents a text that is navigable in sev-
eral directions. Much of the greater story arc has been conceived of in advance, as 
frequently admitted by series creator J. Michael Straczynski, who also wrote 91 out 
of all 110 episodes, thus allowing the show to refer to future events very early. This 
is illustrated furthermore by the title of the first season, “Signs and Portents,” 
which does, indeed, contain many pointers to what is about to come. 
A further use of such a structure is that it allows for the use of prophecy. Sim-
ilar things can be said about Buffy the Vampire Slayer, a show comparably dense in its 
discussion of fate and destiny. The fate of Londo Mollari, the Centauri ambassador 
and later Emperor of the Centauri Republic, is oftentimes foretold and linked to 
the fate of his Narn adversary and later friend, G’Kar, and to John Sheridan and 
the Minbari Delenn. These prophecies come in the form of dreams or visions, or 
they are related to Londo directly. For example, it is being established that Centauri 
dream about their death in detail, and that these dreams are correct prophecies. 
Furthermore, a time travel arc central to the mythology of the show and the very 
fabric of the Earth-Minbari alliance involves Commander Sinclair, the first com-
mander of the Babylon 5 station, to be thrown back in time and become the Min-
bari prophet/leader/messiah Valen (episodes 1.21 “Babylon Squared,” 3.16f “War 
Without End”). In episode 4.22, “The Deconstruction of Falling Stars,” the future 
of Earth is shown as part of a historical record watched by an advanced human a 
million years in the future. 
Thus, future events are frequently shown as occurring without any doubt, and 
the structure of the previous text may depend on them. Prophecies do come true. 
The result is the impression that nothing really changes, because many things are 
made known in advance. This is due to the foreshadowing effect of the prophecies 
within the text, and also due to the frequently used perspective of historical hind-
sight. When in the first Babylon 5 telefilm, “In the Beginning,” the Earth General 
Lefcourt is overly optimistic regarding the war against the Minbari, the audience 
knows it to be arrogant because the film is a prequel to the series, and humanity 
fared terribly in that war: 

 
Chapter 4: Between the Darkness and the Light 
57 
 
GENERAL LEFCOURT: We took care of the Dilgar, we can take care of the Minbari.  
LONDO MOLLARI: Ah, arrogance and stupidity all in the same package. How efficient 
of you. (B5 M1 “In the Beginning,” 8:30-8:36) 
The matter-of-fact character of such hindsight narration has the effect of creating a 
text of inevitability. It is like reading a history textbook which only looks at events 
as if there would have been no other possibility. Counterfactual historiography, of 
course, does exist, but so do conspiracy theories, false prophets and apocalyptic 
thought. What happens on Babylon 5 is that counterfactuals rarely exist but conspi-
racies and prophecies abound. Whereas on Star Trek, time travel is generally used to 
establish alternative and counterfactual historical narratives, the Babylon 5 use of 
time travel and historical fore-flashes usually binds them into the prevalent struc-
ture by making events seem inevitable. 
This obviously clashes with the general narrative of the series: the emancipa-
tion from a dominating hierarchy, from a fate of dependency. There are apparently 
two kinds of fate here: even though the entire purpose of the franchise is to show 
the fight against destiny, against an overwhelming enemy, thus narrating the emanci-
pation from outside control and the search for independence, and even though this 
fight apparently succeeds, there are still some prophecies that come true no matter 
what. Do Sheridan and his people want to emancipate themselves from fate, and is 
Londo just incapable of freeing himself? Does Londo want to become emperor so 
much that he does not dare to “tempt fate” by resisting it? 
While in many ways the struggle against destiny appears successful, there are 
mixed messages: does the fighting against destiny and for the emancipation from 
“parental” races like the Vorlons and the Shadows succeed just because it is fore-
told and necessary, following some kind of cycle? Equally, is there nothing that 
could prevent the fall of Centauri Prime? For some things appear constant, and on 
the occasions when there is time travel, time appears to be fixed. Minor details may 
vary, but the forces of design seem to be very strong indeed: 
CMDR SINCLAIR: I tried. I tried to warn them. But it all happened, just the way I re-
membered. (B5 1.21 “Babylon Squared,” 37:32-37:41) 
Can destiny be defied in the universe of Babylon 5? Most often, no. There is a sense 
of fatalism, especially with the combined fates of Londo Mollari and the Centauri 
Republic. Time travel, portents, dreams and visions conspire to deliver the picture 
of a future that will happen no matter what happens, at least on the grand scale. 
The millennialist theme underlying the series, as seen in Delenn’s address to 
the Minbari Grey Council when time has come to defend Babylon 5 against Presi-
dent Clark’s advancing forces, likewise adds a certain sense of inevitability, and 
doubts regarding the flexibility of the future: 
DELENN: For a thousand years, we have been awaiting the fulfillment of prophecy. And 
when it finally happens, you scorn it. You reject it because you no longer believe it your-
selves. “We stand between the candle and the star, between the darkness and the light.” 

58 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
You say the words, but your hearts are empty. Your ears closed to the truth. You stand for 
nothing but your own petty interests. “The problems of others are not our concern.” […] 
The Council has lost its way. If it will not lead, if we have abandoned our covenant with 
Valen, then the Council should be broken as was prophesied. (B5 3.10 “Severed Dreams,” 
20:04-21:11) 
There is an insistence upon a long-term plan, an almost Hegelian direction history 
is supposed to have. There is no doubt, for instance, that the future events depicted 
in episode 4.22, “The Deconstruction of Falling Stars,” will be the future. Omnis-
cience about the future contradicts omnipotence regarding the change of the fu-
ture. The epic battles shown in the universe of Babylon 5 –– are they of any conse-
quence at all? Who is the focus of all that activity, what is the point? 
There are occurrences where the fight against what is said to be destiny is 
fought and can apparently be won. The message therein is a wholly optimistic one 
of being able to overcome “the darkness.” For instance, while trying to oust the 
tyrannical President Clark, Sheridan is captured by Earth forces, held and tortured. 
He does not submit, and when pushed harder and harder by his interrogator, he 
smiles and remarks: 
SHERIDAN: You know, it’s funny. I was thinking about what you said. “The preeminent 
truth of our age is that you cannot fight the system.” Hmm. But if, as you say, the truth is 
fluid, that the truth is subjective, then maybe you can fight the system. As long as just one 
person refuses to be broken, refuses to bow down. 
INTERROGATOR: But can you win? 
SHERIDAN: Every time I say no. (B5 4.18 “Intersections in Real Time,” 37:46-38:33) 
 
Who Are You & What Do You Want –– The Soul Caught in Dichotomy 
G’KAR: G’Quon wrote, “There is a greater darkness than the one we fight. It is the dark-
ness of the soul that has lost its way. The war we fight is not against powers and principali-
ties; it is against chaos and despair. Greater than the death of flesh is the death of hope, the 
death of dreams. Against this peril we can never surrender. The future is all around us, 
waiting, in moments of transition, to be born in moments of revelation. No one knows the 
shape of that future or where it will take us. We know only that it is always born in pain.” 
(B5 3.22 “Z’ha’dum,” 40:20-41:14) 
The question posed by the Vorlons to the Humans is “Who Are You,” the ques-
tion of the Shadows is “What Do You Want.” Both questions belong together; 
their being asked by two distinct groups has the “younger races” caught in the di-
chotomy of the ancients. The Vorlon question incites introspection, the Shadow 
question agency. Both, however, are directed towards the self of the person asked. 
There is no doubt about the existence of souls and the duality of body and 
soul in the Babylon 5 universe. Talk of souls is common, and not primarily allegori-
cal. There exist Soul Hunters who catch the soul at the moment of death, to pre-
serve it from annihilation. Minbari and Human souls are said to be linked. Recur-
rent themes of telepathic mind-rape and mind-control via telepathy, brainwashing 

 
Chapter 4: Between the Darkness and the Light 
59 
 
or alien parasites within the body carry this over to a less religious level. The theme 
of an “essence” of identity that is separate from the body is carried on throughout 
the series. 
In this sense, the action that takes place carries an introverted meaning: The 
focus is not on what happens, on who lives and who dies, it is apparently not even 
on who does what. If events can be successfully foretold, if the future, in large 
parts, is written already, if contingency is less important than necessity36, actual re-
sults of acts cannot really matter. What appears to matter in the Babylon 5 universe, 
though, is the reflection upon what happens, and the intentions and feelings of 
each participant. The crusade for freedom and truth and survival is an inward one, 
an exhortation to feel and think ethically. If this concurs with politically desirable 
constellations, fine; if not, resistance may not be futile, but it could be foretold: 
your initiative may just lie in doing what you are supposed to be doing. Purpose is 
foretold by design, and sometimes, even your body may be violated to make you 
play your part. That what matters seems to be contained in the answer given by 
Sheridan to his interrogator/torturer: everyone is able to say no. This may not 
change anything, but in the purgatory of life, conviction is everything. 
When hovering between death and life, Londo is confronted with his con-
science personified by G’Kar about his part in the destruction of Narn and in 
G’Kar’s torture by Cartagia: 
MOLLARI: It was not my fault! I said — 
G’KAR: You said nothing. You said nothing! You said nothing! […] You were there. […] 
One word, Mollari. One word was all that was required of you. 
MOLLARI: It would not have mattered. It wouldn’t have changed anything! It would not 
have stopped. 
G’KAR: You’re wrong, Mollari. Whether it was me or my world, whether it was a total 
stranger or your worst enemy, you were a witness! It doesn’t matter if they’d stop! It 
doesn’t matter if they’d listen! You had an obligation to speak out! (B5 5.02 “The Very 
Long Night of Londo Mollari,” 30:14-32:20) 
This focus on the individual, on individual thoughts and deeds and the individual 
quest in the universe, all alone in the night, however allows for repentance, as Mol-
lari in the end does apologize, and G’Kar also recognizes later on: 
G’KAR: Mollari. Understand that I can never forgive your people for what they did to my 
world. My people can never forgive your people. But I –– can forgive –– you. (B5 5.18 “The 
Fall of Centauri Prime,” 15:00-15:55)

On a more allegorical level, the fight for dominion over the self is mirrored in Ga-
ribaldi overcoming his alcoholism and Dr. Franklin his addiction to stimulants. 
Drug use, and the battling of drugs, besides having concrete medical and psycho-

logical components, can constitute a deeply religious problem, too. Sam Harris 
(2004: 153-169) attributes the violent rhetoric of the war on drugs and some of its 
methodology to a heavily religious pursuit of punishing thought crimes, and to an 
aversion to pleasure. Even though drug (ab)use is detrimental to a person’s psycho-
logical and physiological health, as well as to their friends and family, there is an 
additional criminalization going on. This is more apparent in television shows like 
The Wire, yet it could also be argued that Garibaldi and Franklin suffer more than 
they would have to because of the stigmatization of drug use, which actually facili-
tates their using drugs instead of preventing it. The structure of their work envi-
ronment makes it easier for them to use drugs, and it contributes to their downfall. 
They are saved by inner conviction and the realization that things fall apart around 
them if they continue to use. 
A further allegory of powerlessness and manipulation is found in the control 
that former allies of the Shadows, the Drakh, exert upon the Centauri Regent and 
later upon Londo Mollari. In their revenge for Londo’s change of heart and de-
stroying the Shadow base on Centauri Prime, they take control of the planet’s ruler 
by having him merge with a parasite, called a Keeper. The parasite will control all 
matters relevant to its and the Drakh’s plans and make the person under its influ-
ence a mere puppet. In his final talk with G’Kar before completely surrendering to 
the Drakh and the Keeper, Londo warns him that he might change: 
MOLLARI: In the months and the years to come, you may hear many strange things about 
me, my behavior. Well, they say the position changes you. And I just, I wanted to… 
G’KAR: I understand. 
MOLLARI: Perhaps. And perhaps you do not understand as much as you think. Pray that 
you never do, G’Kar. Pray that you never truly understand. […] Isn’t it strange, G’Kar? 
When we first met, I had no power and all the choices I could ever want. And now I have 
all the power I could ever want, and no choices at all. No choice at all. (B5 5.18 “The Fall 
of Centauri Prime,” 13:30-14:54) 
The burden of command is literally weighing heavily upon the shoulders of the one 
assumedly in control, but power is taken away, and freedom can only rarely be 
gained by getting drunk: The Keeper does not like alcohol and can thus be sub-
dued, temporarily. This Dionysian refuge is rarely allowed for Londo, who will 
have to spend the rest of his life in submission to his Keeper until finally, as proph-
esied in his dreams, to be strangled by G’Kar, by Londo’s wish. Londo has learnt to

Creationism and Christianity on Babylon 5 
LORIEN: Words have meaning. And names have power. The universe began with a word, 
you know. But which came first: the word or the thought behind the word? You can’t 
create language without thought, and you can’t conceive a thought without language, so 
which created the other, and thus created the universe? (B5 4.02 “Whatever Happened to 
Mr. Garibaldi,” 2:52-3:24) 

 
Chapter 4: Between the Darkness and the Light 
61 
 
The universe according to Babylon 5 needed a beginning. It will, most probably, 
have an end. In any case, it possesses an inherent course of action. Lorien is an An-
cient who has been alive since the beginning, he is “the first one,” the first being to 
have reached “sentience.”37 His thoughts on the thoughts behind the universe are 
meant to sound authoritative, and what he suggests in his act of sophistry is noth-
ing short of a version of creationism. Allegorically speaking, one could of course 
assume that “thoughts” could mean formulae, and a beginning could mean some-
thing like the Big Bang. In the mythology of “common sense,” however, there is an 
understanding that the Big Bang needs something to start it, and the very beginning 
of the universe is the very gap the creator could be placed in. Physics, however, has 
long removed this gap. The no-borders model brought forth by physicists like Ste-
phen Hawking suggests that the assumption of an origin implies the assumption of 
the unnaturalness of “something,” and the naturalness of “nothing.” But matter, 
supposedly, cannot just come into existence; it has to be created virtually out of 
nothingness, even if this contradicts the First Rule of Thermodynamics: Mass-
Energy cannot be created, only converted. If the Big Bang is understood not as a 
rupture or radical beginning, but as an event resulting out of other events, and con-
verting already existing mass-energy into what we know as the “universe,” this ac-
tually conforms more to the laws of physics as observed everywhere else.38 Yet 
physics is of no interest in the universe of Babylon 5, and it is no accident (naturally) 
that Lorien’s creation story almost casually but very matter-of-factly assumes the 
veracity of John 1: “The universe began with a word” sounds painfully similar to 
“in the beginning was the word,” and all the occurrences of the formula “and God 
spake: let there be [X] and there was [X]” in the Genesis account of creation. Exis-
tence as mere existence apparently is too difficult a concept, even in science fiction. 
The language that is left out, i.e. all references to a “God” with a capital G, is sup-
planted by a vague reference to “the universe.” The Centauri, of course, have their 
polytheist household gods which are utilitarian in the old-fashioned sense: 
LONDO MOLLARI: Ah, our household gods. In a world where every day is a struggle for 
survival, you need all the gods you can get. (B5 1.06 “Parliament of Dreams,” 8:41-8:48) 
This on the one hand underlines the primitiveness, brutality and degenerateness of 
Centauri culture, which not accidentally appears to be modeled on a clichéd Caligu-
la version of the Roman Empire (alluded to e.g. by the name of the decadent and 
insane emperor Cartagia). On the other hand, though, it continues a very popular 
understanding of religion as a comfort zone: People are afraid, they need gods to 
soothe their worries. That most worries within religion result from the vengeful-
ness and arbitrariness of the gods, from their working in “mysterious ways,” and 
                                                      
37  
“Sentience” is a long-standing term, also used in science fiction, to somehow refer to a soul 
without calling it thus. Cf. Ch. 6 on Star Trek for a further discussion of this matter in the 
context of artificial intelligence.

(especially in Christianity) from hell imposed by the very god who is supposed to 
“save” us from it –– all these things are commonly ignored (Mills 2006: 170-189). 
The association of the Centauri with the Romans makes the Centauri-Narn 
conflict more poignant. The Narn have been conquered and enslaved by the Cen-
tauri. Ambassador G’Kar grows to be the center of the Narn resistance, and fur-
thermore the focus of a religious cult. He finds the book of G’Quon, an ancient 
Narn prophet who foretold, amongst other things, the Shadow war. Depictions of 
Shadow vessels can be found in that book, and also tales of creation and darkness 
and destiny. G’Kar’s interpretation makes him into something of a messianic figure: 
TA’LON: Congratulations, Citizen G’Kar. You are now a religious icon. (B5 5.12 “The 
Ragged Edge,” 11:04-11:10) 
Out of the fight against the Centauri, a small group of people from a conquered 
nation finds a messiah whose words of wisdom will be important for the impend-
ing apocalyptic battle at the end of times; and that savior will probably die for the 
cause. The role of Jesus, however, is split into two people: G’Kar is the spiritual 
leader, but it is John Sheridan whose death and rebirth commence the coming of 
the thousand-year rule of light. 
The Soteriology of Sheridan 
In episode 2.22 “The Fall of Night,” an assassination attempt is made against She-
ridan, and he is saved by the Vorlon Kosh –– in order to do that, however, Kosh 
has to leave his protective suit and reveal his true nature: an energy being, bright 
and shining, with wings. To everyone assembled, he looks like an Angel –– even 
though his name is different in each culture. He holds Sheridan by the hand and 
saves him –– which is Sheridan’s first step towards apotheosis. The second is much 
more drastic. 
DRAZI AMBASSADOR: Captain, we’re sorry, we thought you were dead! 
CAPTAIN JOHN SHERIDAN: I was. I’m better now. (B5 4.03 “The Summoning,” 
34:12-34:26) 
At the conclusion of season 3, John Sheridan travels to Z’ha’Dum39 to meet with 
the Shadows. He, of course, resists this version of the temptation by the devil. He 
has no logical means of escape from the planet as he is about to destroy it with his 
starship set on remote control. His death is supposed to bring a decisive victory 
over the Shadows, and in his escape, he runs towards an abyss. The voice of the 
Vorlon Kosh in his heads tells him to jump, and he does. 
                                                      
39  
This, like many things on Babylon 5, is a hardly veiled reference to Tolkien’s The Lord of the 
Rings, wherein Khazad-dûm refers to a mansion of the Dwarves.  

 
Chapter 4: Between the Darkness and the Light

He dies, and finds himself with Lorien who resurrects him by giving from his 
own life.40 Sheridan’s life is artificially prolonged; the end of the series has him as-
cend to wherever ascension leads to. He dies without leaving a physical corpse be-
hind, which is indicative for the Christian-fundamentalist concept of rapture. His 
prolonged life sees him becoming a religious icon just like G’Kar, as he is the one 
who went to Z’ha’Dum and returned. 
It is this religious role that makes Sheridan’s role as President of the upcoming 
Alliance possible, and his quasi-monarchic position41 follows the tradition of revo-
lutionary heroes, military geniuses and god-kings that naturally define the incipient 
phase of a new rule. It is made clear that the rule of Sheridan is based on the fleet 
of White Star ships, the elite military group called Rangers42 and, last but not least, 
the very gravity of the fight against destiny. He is the founder, and together with 
Delenn his rule defines the Alliance. The millennialist components of his thousand-
year Reich are not lost either, yet it is not a time of general peace; trials and tribula-
tions continue –– as shown by the subsequent telefilms and the series Crusade. 
The Universe That Sings Itself 
The focus on the individual, on the soul and the growth of the soul could be un-
derstood as an inward-directed philosophy. But that which is inside, that which is 
personal and private becomes important in a universe in which telepaths have been 
created by the Vorlons as weapons to fight the Shadows. Thoughts can influence 
others directly if one happens to be a telepath. Yet even beyond that, there is said 
to be a greater coherence in the universe. 
From a scientific perspective, of course, everything in the universe is con-
nected and intertwined anyway, but not in a “fanciful” way, as pointed out by Carl 
Sagan (1973/2000: 190f): 
The fate of individual human beings may not now be connected in a deep way with the rest 
of the universe, but the matter out of which each of us is made is intimately tied to 
processes that occurred immense intervals of time and enormous distances in space away 
from us. Our Sun is a second- or third-generation star. All of the rocky and metallic materi-
al we stand on, the iron in our blood, the calcium in our teeth, the carbon in our genes 
                                                      
40  
In episode 1.22 “The Quality of Mercy,” Dr. Franklin recovers an alien machine that, orig-
inally conceived as a means of capital punishment but now used for medical purposes, is 
able to transfer “life energy” (reminiscent of Bergson’s élan vital ) from one person to 
another. 
41  
This, again, is a structural similarity to The Lord of the Rings, where the fight against the 
forces of darkness culminates in the coronation of a new king. The anti-democratic struc-
tures at work appear to be an outgrowth of a romantic stereotype of heroism. It is simply 
unimaginable that the hero of Z’ha’dum would lose a vote; it is unimaginable that such a 
military strategist and hero could not be well versed in the battles of bureaucracy and go-
vernance as well. This is also an instance of romantic narration (cf. Ch. 8, and page 107).

Yet another, this time direct Tolkien reference.

were produced billions of years ago in the interior of a red giant star. We are made of star-
stuff.  
Our atomic and molecular connection with the rest of the universe is a real and unfanciful 
cosmic hookup. As we explore our surroundings by telescope and space vehicle, other 
hookups may emerge. There may be a network of intercommunicating extraterrestrial civi-
lizations to which we may link up tomorrow, for all we know. The undelivered promise of 
astrology –– that the stars impel our individual characters –– will not be satisfied by mod-
ern astronomy. But the deep human need to seek and understand our connection with the 
universe is a goal well within our grasp. 
This notion is taken over by Babylon 5 rather directly, but added are more “fanciful 
hookups:” 
SHERIDAN: What makes you think this is the right place for me?  
DELENN: The universe puts us in places where we can learn. They are never easy places, 
but they are right. Wherever we are is the right place and the right time. The pain that 
sometimes comes is part of the process of constantly being born. […] But the universe 
knows what it’s doing. […] The molecules of your body are the same molecules that make 
up this station and the nebula outside that burn inside the stars themselves. We are star 
stuff. We are the universe, made manifest trying to figure itself out. And as we have both 
learned, sometimes the universe requires a change of perspective. (B5 2.04 “A Distant 
Star,” 35:36-37:05) 
When applied to the individual soul, the Minbari concept projects the universe into 
the body, creating a view of a universe that is aware of itself: 
DELENN: … we believe that the soul is […] a non-localized phenomenon. 
LENNIER: […] if I project a beam of light at the wall, you see the light on the wall, but 
the wall is not the source of the light. It comes in from somewhere else. The soul is also a 
projection. It does not exist inside us any more than the light exists inside the wall. But this 
shell is the only way we can perceive it. 
DELENN: We believe that the universe itself is conscious in a way we can never truly un-
derstand. It is engaged in a search for meaning. So it breaks itself apart, investing its own 
consciousness in every form of life. We are the universe, trying to understand itself. (B5 
3.04 “Passing Through Gethsemane,” 15:12-16:06) 
Put even more directly in what could also be called an extreme memetic perspec-
tive: 
G’KAR: Our thoughts form the universe. They always matter. (B5 4.01 “The Hour of the 
Wolf,” 19:08-19:12) 
This pantheist view is then applied to the nature of God in the writings and sayings 
of G’Kar: 
G’KAR: If I take a lamp and shine it toward the wall, a bright spot will appear on the wall. 
The lamp is our search for truth, for understanding. Too often, we assume that the light on 
the wall is God, but the light is not the goal of the search, it is the result of the search. The 
more intense the search, the brighter the light on the wall. The brighter the light on the 
wall, the greater the sense of revelation upon seeing it. Similarly, someone who does not 
search –– who does not bring a lantern with him –– sees nothing. What we perceive as 
God is the by-product of our search for God. It may simply be an appreciation of the light, 

 
Chapter 4: Between the Darkness and the Light 
65 
 
pure and unblemished, not understanding that it comes from us. Sometimes we stand in 
front of the light and assume that we are the center of the universe –– God looks astoni-
shingly like we do –– or we turn to look at our shadow and assume that all is darkness. If 
we allow ourselves to get in the way, we defeat the purpose, which is to use the light of our 
search to illuminate the wall in all its beauty and in all its flaws; and in so doing, better un-
derstand the world around us. (B5 ep. 5.14 “Meditations on the Abyss,” 24:00-25:38) 
The image of the lamp is reminiscent of the parable of the virgins on their way to 
the wedding, not all of them having enough oil for their lamp. Those who have 
enough oil can shine their way towards their wedding with Christ, those who ha-
ven’t prepared themselves have to stay back and remain in the darkness (Matthew 
25, 1-13). Another allusion is contained in the text, that to the anthropomorphous 
God. Man is supposed to have been created in God’s image –– even though the 
reverse appears more true, which is hinted at herein. This is concordant with the 
theory of religion proposed by Guthrie, whose Faces in the Clouds (1993) puts anth-
ropomorphism at the center of religion: the attribution of agency to more pheno-
mena than sensible. Daniel Dennett (1987) calls this the Intentional Stance, which is 
akin to the concept of a Theory of Mind (cf. Pascal Boyer 2001: 102-106) –– the as-
sumption that many, if not most things and beings around us have an agenda. 
Pantheism is the deification (or rather, theification –– related to theism, not 
deism) of nature, the theory of the mind of God, who is seen in nature. This may 
be the closest description for the religious view of the Babylon 5 universe, combined 
with a strand of Unitarianism, Transcendentalism (following Emerson’s views of 
Nature and Thoreau’s models of Civil Disobedience and the celebration of the individ-
ual in Song of Myself ), furthermore containing elements of Lovelock’s Gaia Hypothesis 
and –– regarding the transcendence of evolved beings (and the ascension of “nor-
mal beings” into energy beings) –– references to the Omega Point proposed by Teil-
hard de Chardin and, later, Frank Tipler. In many ways, the above cited quotes 
could also be read as similar to a memetic understanding of consciousness, and Pla-
to’s Cave Metaphor and his Theory of Forms (see page 112).

5. “I TOUCH THE FIRE AND IT FREEZES ME:” 
SOUL-SEARCHING ON BUFFY AND ANGEL 
anima omnis carnis sanguis eius est 43  
 –– Leviticus 17.14, Nova Vulgata 
Outline: Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel tell tales of emancipation from destiny. 
The Soul is used as an allegory for free will. Tales of an apocalypse are tales of a 
power struggle. 
5.1. Exposition 
Buffy the Vampire Slayer tells the story of Buffy Anne Summers, to whom, as a teen-
ager, her destiny as a slayer of vampires and demons is revealed. Into every genera-
tion, it is said, a slayer is born –– and Buffy will be the one to change that. The se-
ries, created by Joss Whedon, was preceded by a rather unsuccessful movie of the 
same name in 1992, and season 1 aired as a mid-season replacement in 1997. The 
series ended in 2003 after seven seasons. Buffy falls in love with the vampire Angel, 
who has a soul and is thus good. Once they consummate their relationship, though, 
he loses his soul and reverts to Angelus, the evil vampire he once was. Buffy has to 
kill him, however only once he regained his soul. He comes back from hell, but 
their relationship cannot pick up for obvious reasons. So after season 3, he moves 
to Los Angeles, resulting in the television series Angel (1999-2004). Buffy is sur-
rounded by the “Scooby Gang,” her friends Willow Rosenberg (who will turn out 
to be a lesbian and a witch) and Xander Harris. The school librarian Rupert Giles is 
assigned as Buffy’s Watcher –– she works initially under his supervision. Buffy’s 
first death (she was revived quickly though) resulted in the calling of a second slay-
er, Kendra, whose death brought about the slayer Faith, who cannot stand being in 
Buffy’s shadow and decides to work against her; she will come around later. When 
Buffy and Giles decide to rebel against the Watcher’s Council, they send another 
Watcher, Wesley Wyndham-Price, who, like Cordelia Chase, another student at 
Sunnydale High, will move on to L.A. to become an Angel regular. 
Sunnydale is built on the Hellmouth, a portal to a demon dimension which 
brings forth and attracts all kinds of evil. On Angel, it is the city of Los Angeles it-
self that attracts these calamities. The one who made Liam into Angelus is Darla. 
Angelus made Drusilla, Drusilla made Spike. It is Spike who will become a love 
interest for Buffy since season 5. He even regains his soul, and in the end of season 
                                                      
43  
Translation: “the soul of all flesh is its blood.” “Anima” can be translated as spirit, life, soul 
–– it is that which differentiates “living” from “dead” matter.

7, destroys the Hellmouth and dies. Yet he is returned to Los Angeles in season 5 
of Angel. 
The law firm Wolfram & Hart is a global enterprise controlled by evil forces, 
and they conspire to bring Darla back from the dead to take control of Angel. 
Their plan partly fails, and Darla and Angel will get a son, Connor. The son is cap-
tured by an old enemy of Angelus’ and brought up in a hell dimension, and when 
he returns, he is fully grown. He has an affair with Cordelia in season 4, yet Corde-
lia is possessed by dark forces and gives birth to Jasmine, a demon who wants to 
create world peace through subjugation. At the end of the season, Angel cleanses 
Connor’s memory and sends him to a foster family, and he and the gang are invited 
to take over Wolfram & Hart. Season 5 then sees them trying to bring down the 
firm from the inside.44 
5.2. Franchise-Specific Themes 
Stories of Choice and Redemption 
The series is not just about a girl. It’s about something else, things concealed, 
things laid bare, things allegedly beyond understanding, and things lurking beneath 
the façade of humanity: “From beneath you, it devours” (B 7.02 “Beneath You,” 
2:57-3:03). This is the Errand into the Darkness, into the darkness of the self. But 
the self is situated in a larger context, and the discussion of the self is a political 
one. The darkness of selfishness could be dealt with by imposing a social order get-
ting rid of selfishness, by getting rid of the self. This is what happens in season 4 of 
Angel, in which a demon in the form of the beautiful woman Jasmine, otherwise 
known as “the devourer,” comes to Earth, promising eternal peace at the price of 
losing free will. Everybody is turned into “Shiny Happy People” (A 4.18). It may 
appear, on the surface, to be about good, to be about bad, but in the end, it’s nei-
ther: “It’s about power” (B 7.01 “Lessons” 39:13-39:30). 
But let us go back to the beginning. In the beginning, it’s about a girl, Buffy. A 
high-school girl receiving both a high “honor” and immense power: She alone is 
chosen to be the Slayer, she will stand between the darkness and the light. She is 
destined to do so, she is chosen, she did not have a choice. The choice has been 
made for her. She’s got the power, but it has been given to her, she has not gained 
it by her own free will. From day one, all she really wants is to return to being a 
normal girl, to finally “live like a person” (B 7.22 “Chosen” 41:10-41:12). In the 
end, she can, because she has used that power and turned it around. She has 
changed destiny, reclaimed her free will, found her true self, her soul, and changed 
the world, a lot. 
                                                      
44 
Dollhouse, the latest show in the Whedon canon, takes on similar themes of the emancipa-
tion of the soul, and a critique of the soul-less (in this case, brainwashing) corporation.  

 
Chapter 5: “I Touch the Fire and it Freezes Me” 
69 
In another beginning, there was a boy, an Irish boy, a drunkard, a bum, who 
was let loose from the leash of ethical and familial bonds and turned into the killer 
with the angelic face, Angelus. After decades of mayhem, his soul was re-imposed 
unto him, and having become Angel, he has to confront that inside of him that 
needs the killing. In the episode “Amends,” he comes close to giving in to the fight 
when he decides to kill himself by going into the night and waiting for the sunrise. 
Buffy finds him and asks him to reconsider: 
ANGEL: I’m weak. I’ve never been anything else. It’s not the demon in me that needs kill-
ing, Buffy. It’s the man. 
BUFFY: You’re weak. Everybody is. Everybody fails. […] Angel, you have the power to do 
real good, to make amends. But if you die now, then all that you ever were was a monster! 
[…] I know everything that you did because you did it to me. God, I wish that I wished 
you dead. I don’t. I can’t. 
ANGEL: Buffy, please. Just this once, let me be strong. 
BUFFY: Strong is fighting. It’s hard and it’s painful and it’s every day. It’s what we have to 
do and we can do it together. But if you’re too much of a coward for that, then burn. If I 
can’t convince you that you belong in this world, then I don’t know what can. [It starts to 
snow, the sun doesn’t come out.] (B 3.10 “Amends,” 37:41-40:10)45 
“Everybody fails” –– in this version of original sin, the human condition is defined 
by resisting that flaw, and fighting against it. The thriving for a better world and the 
yearning to become a better person are seen as the definition of what makes a per-
son human. And sometimes, the wish to become a better person, or at least not to 
be a bad person, will be rewarded by the powers that be. 
In yet another beginning, Angelus made a monster out of the poet-turned-
vampire, Spike. Both came to fall in love with the same girl eventually, but it was 
the poet who would be saved by that. Even before getting a chip implanted by a 
governmental demon-fighting initiative, Spike “stink[s] of humanity” (B 2.13 “Sur-
prise” 34:18-21) to the true demons. The chip only served as a catalyst, preventing 
him from killing humans directly, but it was love that let him fight to reclaim his 
soul. He rediscovered his own initiative, his free will. 
There are other stories like that. Anya, a woman scorned twice, who twice 
chose to become a vengeance demon under the name of Anyanka, having to redis-
cover her humanity after her powers had been taken from her, again twice. An-
drew, having to cope with his crimes past. Willow, struggling to live with the con-
sequences of her actions rather than just be punished and killed. Xander, having to 
overcome his fear of commitment. Giles, haunted by a past of playing with demon-
                                                      
45  
This can be read as a version of the scene in The Wizard of Oz in which the gang falls asleep 
in the poppy field. The good witch makes it snow, thus waking them up. This is one of 
many allusions to The Wizard of Oz in the Buffyverse, making Buffy into an updated version 
of Dorothy (besides constant references to Scooby Doo). Stargate: SG-1, too, refers directly to 
the film in its 200th episode.

ic forces beyond his control. Wesley, who, although thinking of doing the right 
thing, had to betray Angel in the most horrific way possible. Gunn, having killed 
Professor Seidel for his girl Fred, a man who had sent her to hell in the past. Gunn 
also has to find his place in the world as a previous anti-demon gang leader now 
working for the vampire Angel. Cordelia and Harmony, simply having to grow up 
from their bitchy high-school personas. Angel’s son Connor, who has to learn to 
control the monster within, and to see beyond death and destruction. Illyria, an an-
cient god, having invaded the body of Fred but thus lost her powers and faced with 
humanity and a world that doesn’t bow to her wishes. Oz, hovering between man 
and wolf. Lorne, whose final task from Angel putting him in a role similar to Giles, 
who had to kill a human in the season 5 finale. Faith, the slayer-turned-murderer-
turned-slayer, learning that the negation of humanity only leads to the destruction 
of the self, and that making amends is inevitable. Principal Wood, who has to over-
come his desire for revenge and see Spike as what he has become, not what he was. 
And finally, Darla, the “dear one,” who never had a chance in life, who was turned 
into a monster twice, sacrificing herself in her last moment of humanity, before 
Connor’s birth would have turned her into a monster again. 
All of these are characters that have been broken, that have edges. All of these 
have to live with the consequences of their actions. Only demons are killed on the 
spot, human beings must go on, must suffer and cope with their deeds. Yet there 
can only be consequences, and there can only be true responsibility, if there is free 
will. Free will is emancipation from circumstance, from factors biological and cul-
tural, from forces internal and external, from demons within and daimonic, god-like, 
stronger-than-life-forces existing outside of us. On Buffy the Vampire Slayer and An-
gel, the fight to reclaim the fire within, the fight for the soul, is the fight for indivi-
duality in the light of destiny and fate, the fight for change in the shadow of greater 
powers already established. It is about recognizing responsibility, the ability to re-
spond, about accepting it, learning from it, in order to move on. 
However, there oftentimes remains the desire to undo mistakes and yearn for 
things to be better. Once Cordelia (unaware of the consequences) tells the ven-
geance demon Anyanka that she wishes Buffy Summers had never come to Sunny-
dale, she gets her wish –– and the nightmare ensuing has everything turn to hell. 
Giles summons Anyanka and wants her to change things back, not knowing how 
the “real” reality might look like: 
ANYANKA: This is the real world now. This is the world we made. Isn’t it wonderful? 
[Giles is about to smash the amulet that gives her power.] You trusting fool! How do you know the 
other world is any better than this? 
GILES: Because it has to be. (B 3.09 “The Wish,” 39:42-41:15) 
The trust, on Giles’ part, that there has to be a better future is one further illustra-
tion of a deeply religious trust that somewhere, somehow, there is a better world –– 
and all our errors can be magically reversed, our “sins” forgiven. 

 
Chapter 5: “I Touch the Fire and it Freezes Me” 
71 
The Emancipated Psyche 
Within the “Whedon-verse,” we find an abundance of instances in which the 
shows aim to subvert authority without just replacing it. The very structure of the 
“Scooby” gang on Buffy, of Angel Investigations and of Malcolm Reynolds’ crew on 
Joss Whedon’s third television series Firefly does each feature a nominal leader in 
Buffy, Angel and Mal respectively, yet command decisions are usually a matter of 
the group. Buffy and Giles even decidedly break off their connections with the 
Watcher’s council and operate on their own. At a decisive moment in Angel, he 
subordinates himself to the cause and respects the group as his CEO, the cause 
being more important to him than his authority as a champion. 
The role of champion then is not an exclusive one. Each member of the 
group has their specific “powers,” be they supernatural or not. Furthermore, 
championship is deliberately and frequently depicted as being not a matter of posi-
tion, heritage or destiny, but a matter of concrete actions and engagement. Leader-
ship and authority cannot be empty shells, they need to be proven time and again, 
and they have to undergo constant questioning. Nor can they stand in contrast or 
opposition to the group. That’s why Buffy loses the group towards the end of sea-
son seven: she has become a lone wolf leader who denies others their right to par-
take in the decision-making process. Buffy only regains control of the group by 
winning back their trust through competence and deeds. 
The multiple levels of power are scattered throughout the group. The means 
of knowledge production and control, of practical power and the control of the 
general discourse, as well as that of magic, are not split along gender lines. Willow, 
Winnifred, Wesley and Andrew possess knowledge both technological and mystic-
al. 
Following Erich Fromm’s model of male, success-based love, and female, all-
encompassing love (Fromm 1941, 52-79), Giles is father, and Giles is mother, es-
pecially towards Willow in her moment of crisis. He does want success for his 
“children,” but his love is not dependent upon that. In 6.07 “Once More, With 
Feeling,” he realizes that his paternal authority is holding Buffy back, and that he 
has to leave the group in order to aid Buffy in becoming independent.46 
In general, not only do the female characters partake in power structures, the 
male characters are also freed from the poisoning effects of power. Following the 
psycho-analyst Arno Gruen (1984), the split between male agentive authority and 
female emotional authority, which is usually understood as the basis of the “pater-
nalistic” split and separation of the spheres in society, may appear to favor the 
                                                      
46  
That Giles (and the Watcher’s council) is English and Buffy American even adds an inter-
esting post-colonial level to this. This is made more obvious in 4.08 “Pangs.” Similarly, on 
Angel, the rogue Watcher Wesley is English while Angel (Liam) is Irish, and he is betrayed 
by Wesley who makes a decision for him, not with him. 

72

males, but only if one looks at political power. It also leads to an estrangement 
from family and emotionality, as demonstrated by the common catch-phrase of 
“boys don’t cry.” The female sphere then, historically cursed with official politi-
cal/structural irrelevance, suffers from a feeling of dependency and helplessness. 
The alternative emancipatory model proposed by the Whedon shows avoids the 
simple role-reversal by integrating male and female gender roles into each single 
person, and the quest for the soul becomes the quest for the emotionally balanced, 
dis-estranged and empowered psyche. 
As in the Whedon-verse there is much room for tragedy, persons also tend to 
make mistakes, and to walk the path that’s not supposed to be walked. Angel has 
his major crisis in season 2, the culmination being his surrendering to Darla, and his 
accepting Holland Manner’s statement that Earth is hell. Charles Gunn, in order to 
keep his new lawyer life at Wolfram & Hart, makes a deal with the devil that will 
lead to Fred’s death. Wesley, trusting a prophecy more than his heart, kidnaps An-
gel’s son, which makes him play the role of Judas Iscariot. Buffy, in season 6, strug-
gles to deal with the necessities of ordinary life after being pulled out of heaven by 
her friends. All these are instances of negotiating the relation of the self with the 
larger group or society.  
The quest for the soul that Buffy specifically undergoes in season 6 is made 
clear in B 6.07 “Once More, With Feeling,” where she admits that she’s just “going 
through the motions” (2:00-3:40), that she feels empty and dead inside, that when 
she touches “the fire,” it “freezes her” (35:05-35:30). She has to find a new role, 
she has to become an adult, and she has to learn to take matters into her own 
hands. She learns that by confronting her inner demons. 
Daimonion 
 
Just as on Star Trek the different alien races seem to represent different aspects of 
humanity (cf. Kneis 2010c47), the demon population of the Buffyverse can be un-
derstood as an allegory to human character traits. Demons are not necessarily evil, 
they are just superior to ordinary humans, they are daimonia, god-like creatures. If 
we understand them in the context of Plato’s daimonion as occurring throughout his 
Apology, they serve as a catalyst or signifier that tells us something about our own 
humanity. Angelus, by Angel’s own admission, is not evil because he is a vampire. 
He is evil only through the loss of the soul: But that need not be an indication of 
evil at all. Spike, long before having regained his soul, knew what was right and 
wrong, but the chip that had been implanted into him to curb his desires didn’t tell 
him that, it only restricted his violent urges (B 7.10 “Bring on the Night”). 
ANGEL posing as ANGELUS: Had a soul, now I’m free. (B 3.17 “Enemies,” 27:39-27:42)

available at philjohn.com/rev_tv/pjkdt_st2.html (02/10/2010). 

 
Chapter 5: “I Touch the Fire and it Freezes Me” 
73 
Demons are usually portrayed as lacking a soul, or possessing a demon soul. As is 
customary for the bad guy, or for trickster characters, the demon usually tells the 
truth in a drastic, overly emphatic and threatening though distorting way. For ex-
ample, in the musical episode 6.07 “Once More, With Feeling” a demon compels 
people to tell the truth by singing. In this episode, Buffy reveals to her friends that 
they did not save her from hell but pulled her out of heaven. In 6.17 “Normal 
Again” a demon induces a hallucinating state in Buffy that makes her believe her 
reality is imaginary and she really would be in the mental ward of a hospital (cf. Flor 
& Kneis 2007). In Angel 4.11 “Soulless,” Angelus, the soulless version of Angel, 
tries to stir up things by telling his colleagues unwanted secrets (reminiscent of the 
rants of Hannibal Lecter). This links back to Plato’s use of the term daimonion as 
some kind of inner voice that tells him the truth. Sweet, the music demon in “Once 
More, With Feeling,” as well as the demon that puts Buffy in a state where she is 
confronted with a different reality in B 6.17 “Normal Again,” clearly function as a 
daimonion, in that they offer either an alternative view of reality, quicken up situa-
tions, or invoke conscience. It is no coincidence that Sweet and also Lorne, a regu-
lar character on Angel, use music to clear up the situation, as it is the language of 
emotions and the soul that matters. 
The Christian understanding of demons is different though, and sees them as 
creatures originally created as good by god, but having made a conscious choice to 
become evil, and humans are influenced to commit sin through them: 
Diabolus enim et alii daemones a Deo quidem natura creati sunt boni; sed ipsi per se facti 
sunt mali. Homo vero diaboli suggestione peccavit. (Gregor IX. “De summa trinitate et 
fide catholica.” –– see also the Chapter 6) 
Even though there occur demons on Buffy and Angel that are just said to be evil, 
this holds true mostly for sideshow characters, for the “monster of the week” or 
the vampire casually staked in the Sunnydale cemetery. Yet the big antagonists that 
are given narrative depth follow this definition of demon-ness: they actively choose 
to do wrong, and they revel in corrupting humanity. That they corrupt them often-
times by telling the truth brutally follows the oft-quoted dictum that “the truth shall 
set you free” (John 8, 32). Freed, however, are those that resist the temptation by 
the devil –– and cursed those who let themselves be corrupted. We will see a simi-
lar design on Stargate: SG-1, where the Goa’uld, too, are evil through intention ra-
ther than by design. 
As demonstrated by the ambiguity of each character in the Buffyverse, good 
and evil are potential pathways amongst which we are able to choose –– whether we 
are human beings or demons. If this choice is taken from us, this also diminishes the 
possibility of making an ethical judgement. Is a demon who is evil by design truly 
evil? Is a man who is good by design truly good? Both Caleb, representing the first 
Evil, and Jasmine, claiming to want good, speak of purity, a purity of dogma that 
divides the world between black and white, forcing others into the role of either 
being with or against them, leaving out the grey area the main characters of the 

74 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
show are situated within. As shown by the very existence of demons or half-breeds 
that are situated either in the grey zone or on the good side themselves, like Whist-
ler, Doyle, Clem, Lorne, Harmony and the demi-gods Buffy, Faith and Connor, 
“demon” doesn’t mean “bad by design.” It is fanaticism and dichotomization that 
divide the world into “us” and “them,” and which for instance lead Charles Gunn’s 
originally well-meaning “Old Gang” of demon fighters to kill innocent or harmless 
demons just because they are different, and not because they act in an evil manner 
(A 3.03 “That Old Gang of Mine”). 
The importance of choice is further illustrated by the fact that on Buffy and 
Angel, vampires can only enter a private home after they have been invited in. The 
Buffy mythology specifically chooses this idiosyncratic angle of vampire mythology 
(which is not found in all vampire tales), thus illustrating the element of complicity 
and choice. Evil will come to one’s inner sanctum, one’s home, one’s soul only af-
ter explicit permission. 
An Apocalypse, Now & Then 
The balance of power in the Buffyverse is being disrupted in Buffy’s season 7 and 
Angel’s season 4: On Buffy, we have the First Evil struggling for dominance, and 
Buffy herself has become much stronger than ever intended by the “powers that 
be.” On Angel, we have Jasmine trying to create world peace by eliminating free will 
(A 4.18 “Shiny Happy People”). The Senior Partners of good and bad are staging a 
battle to which the humans are only secondary. It’s a battle that uses prophecies 
and ancient forces to decide the global power play once and for all. 
The occasional apocalypse within the Buffyverse is about power. It’s about 
who determines what’s right and wrong, it’s about changing the order of the world. 
Both sides line up their lieutenants, who will then act accordingly. Some conform 
to that scheme, others, however, act in defiance of that by doing what’s right not 
out of external considerations but because of their inner conviction. They follow 
principle, and see that the ends do not justify the means. There are still those doing 
the dirty work, just as Giles tells Ben, the human and vulnerable and innocent part 
of the demon-god Glory in season 5, that Buffy would let him live, because she 
won’t kill a human: “She’s a hero, you see. She’s not like us” (B 5.22 “The Gift” 
36:20-36:25), meaning, her principle of doing good for the sake of good and not 
for the sake of power, gets in the way of things, but lets her keep her humanity. 
Giles will kill Ben, who is innocent, because this is the only way to kill Glory, who 
is guilty. 
Faith, after she had switched bodies with Buffy (B 4.15/4.16 “This Year’s 
Girl”/“Who Are You,” A 1.18/19 “Five by Five”/“Sanctuary”), starts parodying 
that trait of hers when she poses in the mirror, mimicking Buffy’s “because it’s 
wrong” routine. In the end, though, Faith realizes the trueness of Buffy’s morality, 
and says it herself, finally converted, and having taken her first step towards repen-
tance. In order to find peace, she will have to turn herself in. For even though eth-

 
Chapter 5: “I Touch the Fire and it Freezes Me” 
75 
ics may sometimes seem to get in the way of solving problems, circumventing eth-
ics means emptying the fight from its original purpose. One cannot fight for peace 
and freedom by taking away free will, one cannot fight for morality while having 
lost it oneself. Buffy’s insistence on good for the sake of good may appear purist 
and ideological in itself, but what makes it different is her choice of method. She’s 
not like Professor Walsh whose fight became corrupted by corrupted measures and 
an insistence on following authority blindly. Conveniently, though, she can rely on 
her purist ideology by being helped by less scrupulous friends. 
The apocalypses in the Buffyverse are about choices and accepting fate, or 
not. But initial circumstance doesn’t determine the outcome. Angel’s soul was im-
posed onto him as a curse and punishment, while Spike sought it out for himself 
(made clear in A 5.08 “Destiny” 25:38-26:03): Nevertheless, they have learned to 
do what’s right, they don’t conform to the language of power, control and authori-
ty. Angel is not being corrupted by Wolfram & Hart, he is able to withstand the 
seduction of power, but he is in a way bound by the constraints of the machinery 
of bureaucracy. Through Cordelia, Connor and Illyria, he overcomes his inertia and 
finally understands that power can be used to eventually destroy it, after Illyria tells 
Angel that power can be used to make a difference48: 
ANGEL: We attacked you.  
ILLYRIA: I didn’t give you the chance. That you learn when you become a king. You learn 
to destroy everything that’s not utterly yours. All that matters is victory. That’s how your 
reign persists. You’re a slave to an insane construct. You are moral. A true ruler is as moral 
as a hurricane, empty but for the force of his gale. But you … trapped in the web of the 
Wolf, the Ram, the Hart. So much power here, and you quibble at its price. If you want to 
win a war, you must serve no master but your ambition. (A 5.19 “Time Bomb” 31:39-
32:40) 
Illyria reactivates his sense of agency, his belief that things matter –– and that 
things can change, if someone makes them change. As Gunn puts it regarding the 
fight against destiny and fate: 
FRED: Will it make a difference? We really are just pieces being moved around a board. 
GUNN: Then we’ll kick it over and start a new game. Look, monochrome can yap all he 
wants about no-name’s cosmic plan, but here’s a little something I picked up rubbing mo-
jos these past couple of years. The final score can’t be rigged. I don’t care how many play-
ers you grease, that last shot always comes up a question mark. But here’s the thing — you 
never know when you’re taking it. It could be when you’re duking it out with the Legion of 
Doom, or just crossing the street deciding where to have brunch. So you just treat it all like 
it was up to you—the world in the balance—‘cause you never know when it is. (A 4.17 
“Inside Out” 31:15-31:57) 
                                                      
48  
As a visual illustration, Angel, when starting to work at Wolfram & Hart, begins wearing a 
suit. This underlines his “going corporate,” his “selling out” to the powers that be. Once he 
regains his sense of action and mission, he resumes wearing his leather jacket –– the true 
sign of the rebel. 

76 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
Heroism 
Holland Manners once told Angel that Wolfram & Hart would have no other 
agenda than power itself, a statement which is intended to rob Angel of his sense 
of agency: 
ANGEL: You’re not gonna win. 
DEAD HOLLAND MANNERS: Well, no, of course we aren’t. We have no intention of 
doing anything so prosaic as winning. 
ANGEL: Then […] why fight? 
DEAD HOLLAND MANNERS: That’s really the question you should be asking yourself, 
is it. See, for us, there is no fight. Which is why winning doesn’t enter into it. We –– go on, 
no matter what. Our firm has always been here in one form or the other. The inquisition, 
Khmer Rouge. We were there when the very first cave man clipped his neighbor, see, we’re 
in the hearts and minds of every single living being. And that, friend, is what’s making 
things so difficult for you. See, the world doesn’t work in spite of evil, Angel. It works with 
us. It works because of us. (A 2.15 “Reprise” 35:22-36:27) 
Angel’s agency as a hero is questioned once again in season 5, after his having al-
most come to acceptance with the world. He is given another answer by Lindsay 
finally: 
LINDSAY: You’re playing for the bad guys. Every day you sit behind your desk and you 
learn a little more how to accept the world the way it is, well, heroes don’t do that. Heroes 
don’t accept the world the way it is, they fight it. (A 5.17 “Underneath” 38:07-38:20) 
The difference between these positions is crucial: Power may corrupt, but it can 
also empower. It can only truly empower once the individual has recognized their 
path, their soul, after a process of true emancipation. Those in the Buffyverse who 
seek power for its own sake are prone to be corrupted by it, but those who actively 
recognize their responsibility to make a choice, to make a stand against the propo-
nents of a static world view, against those who have learned to live with the way 
things are going, only those will be able to finally create their own destiny. That 
destiny is one which is not prewritten, that recognizes mistakes when they occur, 
and that does not conform to externally determined roles and positions.49 It’s a des-
tiny not of compliance, acceptance and inaction, it’s not prewritten in a prophecy, 
so they can just be written off, just as Angel does in the end. On the very contrary, 
it is an ongoing process, a path itself, with an outcome unknown, just as Angel puts 
it in the end (A 5.22 “Not Fade Away” 41:12-41:14): “Let’s go to work.” 
                                                      
49  
This does not mean there are no prophecies on Buffy. Prophesied things indeed do happen 
–– yet the focus lies on changing the outcome for the better, which usually succeeds. But 
there are also occurrences of foreshadowing built into the text, the central one concerning 
Buffy’s death and the coming of her sister Dawn. In a dream sequence in 3.22 “Graduation 
Day 2” occurs the phrase “Little Miss Muffet counting down from 7-3-0” (16:15-16:18). 
730 can mean 2 times 365, and exactly 2 years after that scene Buffy dies. This is again refe-
renced in 4.22 “Restless” as a reminder, followed by Tara saying “be back before dawn” 
(31:58-32:33), which alludes to the coming of her sister in the next episode, 5.01. 

 
Chapter 6: Feeding False Gods 
77 
6. FEEDING FALSE GODS: SERPENTS, SOULS 
AND HALLOWED ORIGINS ON STARGATE 
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from Magic. 
 –– Arthur C. Clarke’s Third Law 
Outline: Stargate: SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis tell tales of emancipation from false 
gods. This takes up notions of Euhemerism. Both science and pseudoscience have 
a hold on the franchise. Creationism and fundamentalism are directly referenced 
through Ori and Replicators. The Goa’uld function as an allegory for the soul, for 
agency and religious dominion. 
6.1. Exposition: Stargate: SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis 
The Stargate television franchise takes off from the 1994 Roland Emmerich film of 
the same name which establishes the existence of an ancient, large ring portal bu-
ried in Egypt. The portal, once activated, “dials” a connection to another portal and 
creates a “wormhole” between two places that allows one-way travel in that direc-
tion. The portal on Earth was buried in a slave revolt against an all-powerful alien 
posing as the god Ra, and is rediscovered in 1928. In the present day United States, 
a team of scientists and explorers is assembled to unravel the meaning and discover 
the function of the ring, which is achieved by Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson. 
Once activated, the team embarks on a mission to the planet Abydos which resem-
bles ancient Egypt. Ra returns in a pyramid-like ship, whereby it is revealed that 
Egyptian pyramids are giant landing platforms for alien mother ships. The film 
ends with the destruction of Ra and the safe return of the team except Daniel Jack-
son who chooses to remain on Abydos. 
The television series Stargate: SG-1, developed by Jonathan Glassner and Brad 
Wright and broadcast 1997-2007, picks the story up some time after the movie and 
adds several details to the storyline. Ra, in the movie a singular character, is said to 
belong to a group of aliens that have been exerting their dominion as System Lords 
all over the galaxy. They consist of humans infected by a parasitical worm originat-
ing from the planet P3X-888, the Goa’uld symbiote, which kills off and replaces 
the host’s immune system, providing the hybrid with a vastly prolonged life span 
and superior physical strength. The use of sarcophagi for rejuvenation and curative 
means adds to their illusions of grandeur and invincibility, furthermore supplanted 
by devices allowing for mindreading, powering weapons or inflicting pain. The 
Goa’uld symbiotes are selectively bred in tanks and possess genetic memory. Infant 
symbiotes mature in a pouch situated in the belly of a Jaffa slave, whose immune 
system they replace. 

78 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
The Goa’uld discovery of Earth and humans, called Tau’ri (“the first-born”), 
led to a massive spawning of planets of the galaxy with human populations, some 
of which were turned into Jaffa, others into loyal and intimidated subjects over 
which the Goa’uld could rule and which they would exploit for the production of 
commodities and mining of resources. The Goa’uld took up and adapted many an-
cient Earth mythologies, most ostentatiously Egyptian (as with Apophis, Anubis 
and others), but also some Mayan, Chinese, or other. Through the Tau’ri rebellion 
in Ancient Egypt, the Earth Stargate was lost and humanity was able to develop 
sufficient technological means to arise as a threat to the Goa’uld. 
The Tau’ri, through the newly established Stargate Command, which is lo-
cated in Cheyenne Mountain, up until July 2006 the real-world location of NO-
RAD, would then lead expeditions to other planets, systematically exploring the 
universe by the Stargate addresses uncovered on Abydos and other planets. The 
forefront team is SG-1, led by Jack O’Neill, Dr. Daniel Jackson, Dr. Samantha 
Carter, and the former Jaffa general Teal’c. In the process of discovery, they en-
counter other alien species like the Asgard (who look like Roswell aliens and follow 
a Norse mythology, the “lead” Asgard in contact with O’Neill being called Thor) as 
well as artificial life forms like the Replicators, and countless versions of human 
cultures. 
Occasionally the team encounters remains from an old civilization predating 
all known civilizations, aptly called the Ancients (or, later, the Lanteans or the Alte-
rans). They built the Stargate network and, too, spawned human civilizations. 
Knowledge about the Ancients increases through the run of the series until it is 
discovered that there is a lost city of the Ancients, naturally called Atlantis, the 
search for which leads to its discovery in the Pegasus galaxy and the start of an ex-
pedition thereto, which commences the Stargate: Atlantis series (2004-2009), created 
by Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper. Both series are part of the same storyline 
and constitute a closed franchise, their storylines influencing each other. 
After the defeat of the Goa’uld System Lords, and an initial defeat of the Rep-
licators, only some Goa’uld remain to occasionally wreak havoc, most prominently 
Baal. Through an accidental expedition to another galaxy, Daniel Jackson and the 
former Goa’uld host Mala Val Doran encounter the Ori, an ascended group of An-
cients who do not share the Ancients’ (whom they call the Alterans, the “Others”) 
philosophy of non-intervention and who are eager to spread the message of Origin, 
their holy book which makes them appear as gods and creators. The Ori succeed in 
invading the Milky Way galaxy, the fight being resolved after the end of the ten-
season run of Stargate: SG-1 in a subsequent television film. 
The main nemesis faced by the Atlantis team, the Wraith, is once again an 
alien-human hybrid species originating from humans spawned by the Ancients and 
a tick-like creature called the Iratus bug. The Wraith are vampire-like and basically 
suck the life out of their human victims. Through reactivating Atlantis, the team 

 
Chapter 6: Feeding False Gods 
79 
from Earth has awaken the Wraith all over the Pegasus galaxy, and the news of the 
existence of the Milky Way galaxy has the Wraith eager to find a way to Earth to-
wards their prospective new feeding grounds. The Atlantis team is further plagued 
by another version of Replicators. 
Stargate: Universe, the most recent series in the franchise, sees a human crew 
stranded in a different galaxy on an Ancient spacecraft. 
6.2. Franchise-Specific Themes 
Archeology and Anthropology: Indiana Jones in Space 
The Stargate franchise introduces the audience to a universe that has been populated 
with human cultures by the Goa’uld and the Ancients. Old Earth cultures have 
been snatched up from their original locations and transferred to alien planets. The 
Goa’uld are portrayed as mere parasites, relocating slave populations at their whim 
in order to create armies of Jaffa hybrids who can breed their larval Goa’uld and 
fight for them, or to simply create populations of workers to do their mining and 
farming etc. The Ancients function as an analogy to the Romans on an intergalactic 
level. This is made apparent by similarities between the language of the Ancients 
and Latin. The Goa’uld language is based on the language of the Unas, a reptilian-
looking humanoid species that were first hosts to the Goa’uld, and that language is 
said to be a proto-version of Ancient Egyptian. 
These relocated cultures most often have remained static and uniform. The 
Stargate thus functions as a virtual time machine: several times the crew visits pla-
nets with a culture based upon the culture the Goa’uld snatched from Earth origi-
nally, and that culture will most often not have changed significantly since the orig-
inal relocation. Ancient Mongolian, Norse, or other cultures remain like they were 
for hundreds or even thousands of years. This follows an uncritical clinging to na-
tionalist narratives, and underlines the common assumption of ancientness for na-
tional identities.50 
Furthermore, and this follows a general science fiction stereotype, most alien 
“planets” appear to be unified by a single civilization, lacking most of the complexi-
ties known on Earth. The few exceptions to that rule occur most often if modern 
cultures are shown. Thus, diversity and complexity are apparently not something 
assumed of “primitive” and “original” civilizations, and they are seen as inherently 
different from “modern” civilization (which is often shown to be corrupt or defi-
                                                      
50  
Benedict Anderson (1983) points out that the notion of the nation state is a constructed 
one, and that the assumed stability of national identity is a myth, and most such identities 
that we know now are rather recent. Continuities are created ex post facto, and change is 
constant. Geary (2002) shows this to be the case with European examples. Specifically 
Germanic and Hunnish tribes were oftentimes formed on an ad-hoc basis, mostly under 
the rule of a specific leader, at the Roman frontier.  

80 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
cient in some way). Within the storyline, such “alien” human cultures are thus just 
important for their otherness (cf. Kneis 2010c). 
Science and Pseudoscience 
On a rather obvious level, science is in the driver’s seat in the Stargate franchise. 
Despite the military angle, a vast amount of responsibility for the success of each 
storyline is situated in the hands of the scientific and academic cast: on SG-1, this is 
Dr. Daniel Jackson (archeology, Egyptology), Capt./Major/Lt. Col. Dr. Samantha 
Carter (physics), Dr. Janet Fraiser and later Dr. Lam (medicine); and on Atlantis, 
Dr. Elizabeth Weir (political science), Dr. Rodney McKay and Dr. Radek Zelenka 
(physics) and Dr. Carson Beckett and Dr. Jennifer Keller (medicine), and again Dr. 
Carter (who is joining the Atlantis cast for season 4). Contrary to Star Trek, the hu-
manities are represented together with the “hard” sciences, and the role of the en-
gineer is rather vacant. Even though on Enterprise, with the figure of Hoshi Sato, 
there was a linguist on board as well, she rarely was seen acting as a scientist, rather 
as a crew member. A point is regularly made in the Stargate franchise by stressing 
the non-military origin of academics and scientists like Dr. Jackson, Dr. McKay and 
Dr. Weir, or later diplomat Richard Woolsey, and highlighting their civilian, aca-
demic background. They are not soldiers who happen to know something about 
science, but academics who happen to have to learn how to fight.51 
By having Stargate set in the present, the ubiquitous “technobabble” of the 
more futuristic Star Trek universe has to have more of a relation to actual science. 
This can for sure be circumvented time and again by alien devices and alien scien-
tific achievements, but nevertheless, the focus on a more or less scientific outlook 
is apparent from the detailed expositions given time and again on science-oriented 
episodes. 
One further component of scientific thinking can be found, something that 
could be called the argument from stupidity. Regularly, wrong decisions are made 
by lead scientists, be it Dr. Carter or Dr. MacKay, but also by the military leaders. 
Bad things happen due to the actions of the protagonists. Yet these bad things are 
often based on sound hypotheses, things that oftentimes make sense given the in-
formation provided. Only in the course of the events, the experiment will point to 
an error in the original thinking, which leads to better hypotheses, which again may 
prove right or wrong. This constitutes a fundamental difference to the overall cor-
pus of Star Trek (cf. Butcher 2004). What this illustrates is the tentativeness of 
scientific knowledge, and an understanding of epistemology that allows hierarchies 
to be fallible, and in need of correction. Oftentimes, Stargate’s scientists are dispro-

However, they still belong to the military-philosophic caste, which can be read as inspired 
by Plato’s Republic. This holds true for all franchises discussed herein. For a more detailed 
analysis, cf. Kneis 2010b.

ven –– which is no big deal, because this is seen as normal. Science goes on; it is 
tentative and accumulative, not a closed system of sacred knowledge.52 
This tentativeness allows for constant modification and revision, and it may 
well be that today’s heresies become tomorrow’s facts. On Stargate, there exists a 
genuinely probing and playful approach to science which is common to science 
fiction in general: the extension of known physics into the (yet?) unknown, and the 
fictional “application” of highly hypothetical assumptions and models. The most 
iconic ones would be: 
 
Wormholes: as the basis of Stargate travel 
 
Zero-Point Energy: as the basis of the Zero Point Modules used by the An-
cients and scavenged by humans for use in Atlantis, the Antarctica base, and 
ships like the Daedalus. 
 
Time Travel 
 
Subspace or Hyperspace: a common sci-fi device to allow travel faster than 
light. By recognizing the impossibility to accelerate from sub-light speed to or 
exceeding light speed, the fictional establishment of various versions of hyper-
space nevertheless acknowledges that any solution to the problem of fast in-
terstellar travel would have to somehow work around known physical rules 
and regulations. Thus, while there currently is no scientific basis to such theo-
ries whatsoever, they nevertheless follow a scientific perspective. 
In contrast to science as a method, and the treatment of borderland scientific ideas, 
there are potent underlying pseudoscientific elements53 (which could also be re-
ferred to as anti-science) for which Stargate from the onset, and quasi by design, has 
                                                      
52  
While Shermer (1997), Sagan (1997) and Gardner (1957) point to the scientific method as 
the most central component of science and scientific thinking, this notion has been prob-
lematized by philosophers of science. Ruse (2001) examines the history of evolutionary 
thinking and points to individual idiosyncrasies in the thoughts of leading proponents of 
the theory. This does not invalidate science, as the consequence is nevertheless an evolving 
scientific theory that becomes stronger over time, yet it does take away from the myth of 
the rationality and objectivity of the individual scientist. Bauer (1994) exposes the “scientif-
ic method” as a myth, an ideal which only emerges in hindsight, and likens science more to 
a communal puzzle or knowledge filter. Especially in his treatment of pseudoscience at the 
example of Immanuel Velikovsky (Bauer 1999), he makes clear that most often pseudos-
cience comes less from the actual theses proposed, but from the resistance of “outsiders” 
to subject themselves to the rigor of academic reviewing and revising. This does not take 
away from the results of science, yet it makes its proponents more human and accepts a 
more skewed path for scientific knowledge gathering. –– Somewhat ironically, and regrett-
ably, Bauer has recently made a name for himself as an HIV/AIDS denialist. This should 
not, however, detract from his previous, more scientific works cited above, in which he de-
fends the practice of science against lone renegades and outsiders.  
53  
For a rather exhaustive treatment of such themes, see Gardner 1957 and Sagan 1996.

proved to be a most fertile ground. In that regard, it follows The X-Files by its cata-
loguing various icons of pseudoscience, such as: 
 
Pyramidology/Pyramidiocy: This may be the most prominent Stargate feature, 
as the entire founding mythology is based on the idea that Ancient Egypt and 
Goa’uld culture are linked. 
 
Atlantis: The myth of Atlantis as narrated by Plato in his Critias and Timaeus 
dialogs is the execution of his wish in the Timaeus to deliver a scenario for his 
imagined ideal state as laid out in his Politeia.54 The probably inane search for a 
“real Atlantis” is given a new manifestation in the Stargate universe by making 
it even more ancient (by literally tying it to the “Ancients”) and establishing 
Atlantis as an old Lantean base that had to be sunk in the ocean due to a 
Wraith attack. 
 
Power of Crystals: In addition to mechanical or bio-mechanical circuitry, alien 
spaceships like those of the Goa’uld, Asgard and the Lanteans (amongst oth-
ers) contain “control crystals.” This may not be totally bogus, as there are 
scientific attempts to use crystals as memory storage by coding information in 
the way atoms are ordered, yet it pays homage to the more commonly known 
superstitions about the inherent magical power of crystals. 
 
Roswell aliens as Asgard: The shape of “Grey” Roswell aliens has come into 
“being” with the 1975 film The UFO Incident, telling the story of Betty and 
Barney Hill.55 By having the Asgard take up the prototypical shape of the 
Roswell Greys, this contemporary myth is both acknowledged and given new 
form. 
 
Area 51 as a real research facility: The holy grail of conspiracy thinking center-
ing on aliens and UFOs is the mythical place of Area 51, where either alien 
spacecraft are being analyzed, or own spacecraft are being built, or any other 
sinister governmental plot takes place. By the tongue-in-cheek incorporation 
of Area 51 into the Stargate mythology, its existence is taken for granted rather 
uncritically. 
 
Ascension and new levels of consciousness: This takes up and modifies ideas 
found not only in established philosophies and religions such as Buddhism 
and Christianity, but also in Dianetics/Scientology and Teilhard de Chardin’s 
Omega Point, in Frank Tipler’s The Physics of Immortality (1994), and in funda-
mentalist Christian concepts of the Rapture. 
                                                      
54  
The reasoning for telling the story of Ancient Athens and Atlantis is given in Timaeus 19b-c: 
The imagined state of the Politeia should be shown in action. This might be one of the first 
science fiction stories ever. See also Kneis 2010b.

Cf. Shermer 1997: 90-98 

 
Chapter 6: Feeding False Gods 
83 
 
Meditation is a key practice of the Other, on Stargate: SG-1 personified by 
Teal’c, on Stargate: Atlantis by Teyla. This, of course, follows Star Trek’s Spock, 
Tuvok and T’Pol (and, once the Vulcan “influence” cedes, the Klingons ap-
pear to be the “spiritual” ones), Voyager’s Chakotay (where the Noble Savage 
reclaims his iconic practice), Babylon 5’s G’Kar, and so on.  
 
Weird (more or less) martial arts styles similarly use an “Asian” stereotype to 
mark the Other. This holds, again, for SG-1’s Teal’c and for Atlantis’s Teyla 
plus Ronon. Same for the Klingons, especially with Worf’s Tai Chi-like 
movements. Even Angel does Tai Chi, while martial arts moves thrive on Buf-
fy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. Babylon 5 has the Minbari continue that tradi-
tion. All this supports the aspect of medieval romance, tied into a cult of he-
roism, and containing elements of a form of psychotic narration (cf. Ch. 8). 
 
Consequently, the use of the Artus/Grail/Roundtable complex since season 9 
of SG-1, which supplements and partially replaces the Goa’uld/Pyramidology 
complex, makes Medieval and romantic notions more apparent: Knighthood 
is still alive. 
 
Panspermia: The origin of life on Earth is still not quite clear. However, two 
things have been more or less confirmed: building blocks of life and even 
simple organisms could travel via meteoroids to Earth; and human beings are 
definitely genetically related to all other life on Earth. A theory of (strong) 
Panspermia, the distribution of (intelligent, humanoid) life throughout the ga-
laxy by very advanced beings would be possible only if all life, from the be-
ginning or after a period of extinction (if at all) were of alien origin. The mod-
els of Panspermia apparent in the franchises of Stargate, Star Trek, Babylon 5, 
but also to a certain degree on Farscape, can thus probably be put into the 
realm of pseudoscience. 
Euhemerism in Space  
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. 
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. 
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? 
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God? 
(Epicurus, as cited in Lactantius. De Ira Dei. 13. 20-21.) 
The general criticism of the benevolence or justification of gods posed by (or as-
cribed to) Epicurus is an attempt to question the validity of the god-idea on ethical 
grounds. This iconoclasm is taken to quasi-historiographical level by the Greek phi-
losopher Euhemeros, who postulates in his Hiera Anagraphê (Holy Scripture, or Sacred 
History) that most gods are based on past and very human rulers and their deeds on 
real events, that within mythology there are remnants of true history, and ancient 
leaders have received their apotheosis to become known and ancient gods, just as 
the (then contemporary) Pharaohs were made gods, but not out of piety but utility 

84 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
rather. This line of thought has been taken over by Christian philosophers like Cy-
prian of Carthage, who in On the Vanity of Idols states: 
That those are no gods whom the common people worship, is known from this. They were 
formerly kings, who on account of their royal memory subsequently began to be adored by 
their people even in death. Thence temples were founded to them; thence images were 
sculptured to retain the countenances of the deceased by the likeness; and men sacrificed 
victims, and celebrated festal days, by way of giving them honour. Thence to posterity 
those rites became sacred which at first had been adopted as a consolation. 
Herein, gods previously labeled as such are reduced to idols, and daímônes, and even 
Socrates’ daimónion, both terms related to divinity, are reduced to demons, related to 
the devil, with a strictly negative connotation.56 The purpose is clear: by relating 
gods to history, they are reduced to more mundane phenomena; and in the Chris-
tian context, their divinity is not only denied but reversed into the demonic in order 
to make the one true god appear as something completely different. The Christian 
god is a transcendental version of the Jewish god; the latter can be seen as not be-
ing a person from history but the creator and the personalization of history. His 
name need not necessarily be spoken, and in the Christian context, while all other 
gods are reduced to idols, that does not take away from the “truth” of the one re-
maining god, removed from history, transcending it and thus also transcending the 
Euhemerian paradigm. 
Stargate’s Euhemerian outlook57 begins all too fittingly with the god-making of 
rulers in Egypt, having the first false god to occur be Ra. Once the Goa’uld are 
(almost) finished towards the end of SG-1, Baal is the most iconic one to remain as 
a formidable antagonist. This makes apparent the otherwise only latent, but mostly 
blatantly hidden fact that the fight on Stargate is not against gods (or against the idea 
of god) per se, but that the fight is against false gods (which is openly acknowledged), 
with a focus on paganism. We do not have to look for a Goa’uld called Jehovah, 
Yahweh, Allah, Jesus, Mary, or any saintly name, or that of a Christian prophet; nor 
for a Hindu god, or for any other “current” god. The assortment of “false” gods 
                                                      
56  
The 4th Lateran council in 1215 speaks of “Diabolus enim et alii daemones” (the devil and 
other demons), making the relation clear –– cf. page 73. 
57  
Occasional instances of Euhemerism can also be seen on Star Trek, as in the episodes ST 
2.02 “Who Mourns for Adonais?” and TNG 4.13 “Devil’s Due.” This is more of a theme 
in the old Star Trek series, and the Next Generation episode mentioned was originally 
scripted for Kirk, not Picard, to be part of the discarded Star Trek: Phase II. Similarly, Star 
Trek: The Motion Picture and Star Trek V: The Final Frontier are about searching for or con-
fronting self-proclaimed gods. When TNG takes up the question of gods, this happens 
from an anthropological perspective as in TNG 3.04 “Who Watches the Watchers,” or in 
the Mephisto-like trickster figure of Q, who may be modeled partially on Trelane from ST 
1.17 “The Squire of Gothos,” a theme taken up by Peter David in Q Squared. –– Shadows 
of Euhemerism can be found on Babylon 5, where the Vorlons are shown to resemble an-
gels in Christian culture. 

 
Chapter 6: Feeding False Gods

stays safely within a politically correct realm of very past deities from Egyptian, 
Norse, Chinese, Mayan and other theologies. 
An implicit Christian impulse cannot be denied, as some of the personnel of 
Stargate Command admit to having been raised religiously, namely Cameron Mit-
chell and Hank Landry (Ep. SG-1 9.03 “Origin”). The pagan-bashing momentum 
could thus be masking a latent Christian agenda, and yet, in anti-paganism, ele-
ments of atheism and criticism of any religion are contained, as illuminated by Ri-
chard Dawkins (2006, 53): 
None of us feels an obligation to disprove any of the millions of far-fetched things that a 
fertile or facetious imagination might dream up. I have found it an amusing strategy, when 
asked whether I am an atheist, to point out that the questioner is also an atheist when con-
sidering Zeus, Apollo, Amon Ra, Mithras, Baal, Thor, Wotan, the Golden Calf and the Fly-
ing Spaghetti Monster. I just go one god further. 
The anti-pagan element is deeply tied to resistance to authority, and the only god 
acceptable is one who does not wield any power and grants free will, not subjuga-
tion. This can be seen most clearly in the enemy arising in SG-1’s final two seasons. 
Creationism in Space: “Hallowed are the Ori” 
Doci: What is a god, but a being that is worshipped by those beneath? Is great power, 
knowledge, understanding not enough for you to revere the Ori? (SG-1 9.03 “Origin,” 
17:28-17:40) 
The Ori are different as the conflict is now internal: The galaxy is torn between the 
theology of the Ancients and the Ori; it is a religious war between two sects. Whe-
reas the fight against the Goa’uld was the fight against paganism, the fight against 
the Ori is a fight over Deutungshoheit and orthodoxy, about who gets to define reli-
gion and the legitimacy of power structures. 
The Ori demand strict obeisance of their followers; they create a discourse of 
“us” versus “them.” The Ori make concrete demands, their “love” for their sub-
jects follows what Erich Fromm calls a paternal model (1956: 80), versus the ma-
ternal “love” (or rather, enlightened indifference) that is the policy of the Ancients. 
Very succinctly, the Ancients are called the Alterans by the Ori, “the Others.” The 
enemy is the enemy because of otherness; sameness is to be spread via a crusade. 
Difference is constructed as a “need” that can only be fulfilled by conversion, the 
forceful imposition of the “own” creed, that of Origin. Criticism is not wanted, it is 
construed as evil, as illustrated in the following quote: 
DOCI: A Prior has been dispatched to the place from whence you come. […] It is the will 
of the Ori that we should spread Origin to all those blessed by their creation.  
JACKSON: Ok, well, then you should understand that there are many different kinds of 
people in the place from whence I come, people who believe in many different things.  
DOCI: They shall find the path to enlightenment.  
JACKSON: Right. Well, I think you should also understand that they may not see your way 
as the only way…  

86 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
DOCI: The power and the greatness of the Ori cannot be denied. Those who reject the 
path to enlightenment must be destroyed. (SG-1 9.03 “Origin,” 14:54-15:54) 
In confronting the Doci, a human bishop of the Ori, Daniel Jackson is given the 
usual missionary zealotry and rejection of variety. Yet instead of just confronting a 
human spokesperson for the gods, the Doci, once asked by Daniel whether he 
speaks for the Ori or himself, lets himself be channeled by the Ori themselves, and 
the “gods” themselves are given a voice: 
The Doci steps in front of the flames that are the Ori, and an Ori spirit takes possession of him: 
ORI- DOCI: We are Ori.  
JACKSON: And you instruct these people to worship you?  
ORI- DOCI: We are their creators. All who follow the path will join us in enlightenment.  
JACKSON: Do you know who the Alterans are?  
ORI- DOCI: Those who abandoned the path are evil. […] The truth of the universe has 
been obstructed. All will know the power of the Ori! (SG-1 9.03 “Origin,” 20:34-21:07) 
By having the gods speak themselves, it is not just the missionary practice that is 
criticized. The gods are de-mythologized and de-transcendentalized, so to say. They 
are made material, their existence is accepted –– yet their divinity is questioned by 
this. By taking the godhead out of the realm of the imaginary and numinous, it is 
made material, tangible. By taking away illusions of benevolence, their justification 
and righteousness are exposed for mere power play. Religious disillusionment is the 
result. 
The rhetoric of “creation” and the reference to the sacred book as the book 
of “Origin” allows for reading the Ori as an allusion to creationism58, which fits 
into the general religious fundamentalism exhibited by the Ori Priors. To stay with-
in that image, and to more exhaustively refer to Christian creationism, Vala Mal 
Doran, when staying behind on the Ori planet and given a husband, gets pregnant 
without actually being impregnated. This results in the virgin birth of her daughter 
Adria, also called the Orici, something like the Ori messiah. The ensuing relation 
between Vala Mal Doran and the fruit of her bodily violation, the Orici, is double-
edged: On the one hand, Vala once was host to a Goa’uld, forced to do things she 
did not want to do consciously. Her almost immaculate conception, a divine rape 
by any other name, results in a daughter who is on a mission of doom to subject 
                                                      
58  
However, an alternate reading is also possible, though I would not subscribe to it. Darwin’s 
iconic work is usually referred to as Origin, and with a little creativity, behind the Goa’uld 
could be suspected the name of the late Steven J. Gould. The replicators could be a refer-
ence to Richard Dawkins’ terminology (see later in this chapter). Thus, an alternate, 
science-critical reading could be allowed. Conversely, the Goa’uld could also refer to Elliot 
Gould or nothing in peculiar. Mere terminology and language games, however, stand 
against an amassed body of a general scientific and scientist tendency within the Stargate 
franchise. In any case, these instances of counter-meaning could be construed as slightly 
ironical nods towards the inherent threats of a totalitarian application of any grand narra-
tive, for which, again, the Replicators serve as the iconic example.  

 
Chapter 6: Feeding False Gods 
87 
the universe to the teachings of Origin (aka the rule of the Ori). On the other hand, 
Adria is not ill-willed, and deeply believes –– and as a daughter, she rebels against 
the mother. In a cynical twist, the end of the television series SG-1 has her captured 
first by SG-1, then by Baal –– and Baal transfers his symbiote into her, making her 
a Goa’uld like her mother once was. This first rape results in SG-1 “rescuing” her 
only in order to remove the symbiote, and after that fails, they attempt to hinder 
her from ascension, which Adria perceives as yet another violation. In a twisted 
way, her finally achieved ascension, while possibly a threat to the world of the Star-
gate universe, is well deserved.59 
Genetic Memory, Lamarckism, Absolute Evil 
“Nothing of the host survives” is a Goa’uld mantra that is proved false on several 
occasions within the series. Yet still, the host is seen as the violated body, upon 
whom atrocious acts are laid, performed by the Goa’uld symbiote. The Goa’uld 
mythology bifurcates in the past when “evil” and “good” are separated; one branch 
has the new symbiote inherit the memories of all the Goa’uld before, tying them to 
their narrative. As the narrative is one of relentless power and cold-hearted, bloody 
exploitation, they are inherently evil. This scientistic approach to original sin is 
called genetic memory in the show, and smacks of Lamarckism: the inheritance of 
acquired characteristics. Though Lamarckian inheritance has time and again shown 
to be flawed, if not utterly false (cf. Dennett 1995: 320-324), it resurfaces here to 
explain evilness by nature. The non-evil Goa’uld dissenters, the Tok’ra, are des-
cended from a Goa’uld queen who did not transfer her memories upon their des-
cendants. 
An additional (or maybe even rivaling) explanation for the Goa’uld quest for 
dominance is their use of sarcophagi, devices which can heal virtually everything 
and immensely prolong the life span of the hosts. As experienced by Daniel Jack-
son himself (Episode SG-1 2.05, “Need”), the continued use of a sarcophagus 
creates delusions of grandeur, contributing to a sense of omnipotence, a disdain of 
humanity and nature, and a heightened quest for dominance. 
Sarcophagi make invulnerable, Goa’uld science (mostly scavenged from other 
cultures) provides a technological edge, and genetic memory links the Goa’uld back 
to millennia of dominance. The Tok’ra (=“against Ra”), in addition to their differ-
ent descent, refuse to use sarcophagi as they feel that this would make them as 
power-hungry as the Goa’uld: 
                                                      
59  
Especially viewers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel will cringe at the similarities. Buffy’s 
emancipation from the Watcher’s Council follows her being violated in episode 3.12 
“Helpless”; more drastic examples are the fates of Cordelia and Winifred/Illyria on Angel. 
This makes apparent a point that is being driven home by, amongst many others, Christo-
pher Hitchens (2007: 54f): Religion is about submission, specifically about the submission 
of women under the rule of men. –– Adria is defeated in the first telefilm after the series.

CARTER: The Resistance, the Tok’ra, they don’t use the sarcophagus. […] It does bad 
things to you. It changes your mind, takes something from you, […] Kalach [one’s soul]. 
(SG-1 2.05 “Need,” 25:47-26:12) 
This provides another explanation than the one offered: the evil of the Goa’uld, 
contrary to what is often claimed, is not absolute by design but merely a convenient 
choice. Some Goa’uld are indeed “more evil” than others. This very much follows 
the line of thought expressed by pope Gregory IX, that the demons were created 
good yet by their own acts made themselves evil.60 The “evil by design” hypothesis 
is thus thoroughly refuted within the context of the series, just as on Buffy the Vam-
pire Slayer and Angel. Free will exists for evil as well –– which means, even demons 
can be held accountable; and they might reform. 
The Goa’uld Inside 
The Goa’uld symbiote is a version of the Faustian deal with the devil: The Goa’uld 
delivers health, power, and protection –– it demands control over the body, alle-
giance to the legacy of the Goa’uld, and service till the very end. This works on 
three levels: (1) The Goa’uld hierarchy consists of (mostly human) hosts physically 
invaded by a symbiote who has taken over control of body and mind, (2) the Jaffa 
soldiers who nurse an infant Goa’uld symbiote in a pouch in their belly, whereby 
the symbiote permanently disables the host’s natural immune system, taking over 
these functions by itself61, and (3) the people over which the Goa’uld via their Jaffa 
soldiers hold dominion, of whom they demand servitude, and whom they in turn 
provide with “protection.” These are declining degrees of empire, and the key to 
the last is the Stargate. 
Although the Goa’uld have starships, they heavily rely upon the more conve-
nient use of the Ancients’ Stargate system. The Tau’ri of Earth, after their rebelling 
against the Goa’uld, buried the Stargate, and since then have been able to develop 
on their own. The reopening of the Stargate has always been shown to be a mixed 
blessing, simultaneously as an opening for opportunity and a version of Pandora’s 
                                                      
60  
Cf. Chapter 5 
61  
The symbiote is an infant god, and it can be read as symbolizing the indoctrination with 
religion. That religion (on Stargate, in the form of the symbiote) gets rid of the natural im-
mune system and may take away inherent, natural morality (moral impulses are given an 
evolutionary basis e.g. in Ridley 1996, Dawkins 1989, Shermer 2004) is a fitting analogy for 
the Steven Weinberg quote “Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it, you 
would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good 
people to do evil things, that takes religion” (quoted in The New York Times, April 20, 1999). 
–– Something similar to the Goa’uld symbiote can be found on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, 
wherein the Jem’Hadar soldiers of the Dominion are given the drug Ketracel-White which 
replaces their immune system, and renders them dependent on the Founders. The Found-
ers are similarly depicted as god-like (and being Changelings, they could be read as trickster 
figures too), thus securing their soldiers’ allegiance through chemical addiction can be read 
as a religious analogy as well. 

 
Chapter 6: Feeding False Gods 
89 
box.62 The control of the Stargate by the Tau’ri helps them to counter the domi-
nion of the Goa’uld by their own mission to free all humans under the rule of the 
Goa’uld System Lords, a manifest destiny that sees the Free Man’s Burden in un-
dermining the current galactic hegemony. Thus, the third form of Goa’uld domi-
nion can be broken by another power offering protection to peoples once subject 
to the Goa’uld. This is intimately connected to controlling the instruments of pow-
er, and with Teal’c, the “Shol’va,” the traitor, the second column of dominion is 
called into question. Teal’c and his mentor Bra’tac symbolize the insurgency of the 
Jaffa against the Goa’uld masters, and with the discovery of Tretonin, a drug that 
can supplant the role of the symbiote as an immune system, Jaffa agency is restored 
–– through science. The prime case of dominion, the direct influence of the symbi-
ote on a “made” Goa’uld, is more difficult, yet apparently not impossible. The test 
cases are Ska’ara, a boy from Abydos freed by Jack O’Neil in the movie and subse-
quently infected by the Goa’uld Klor’el, and Sha’re, wife of Daniel Jackson, similar-
ly infected in the pilot of Stargate: SG-1 by the Goa’uld Amonet. Though their ac-
tions are governed by the symbiote, apparently something of the host survives, and 
can, at crucial points, resist. The demon strives to exert dominion of the mind, but 
it may not have it at all times; and even though agency is taken away, the core of 
the previous person, the essence, the soul, is still there. At a crucial moment, Sha’re 
is able to provide Daniel with crucial intelligence (SG-1 3.10 “Forever in a Day”). 
Similarly, once captured, Ska’ara can make a case against the dominion of Klor’el 
over his body (SG-1 3.15 “Pretense”). Even though physical threat and the disabl-
ing of the symbiote’s rule are necessary, this does mean that there is a non-
complicit entity simply “trapped” within the body shared by host and parasite. 
Another case is Vala Mal Doran, who also once was host to a Goa’uld and now has 
to atone for her past. 
The evilness of the Goa’uld symbiote is furthermore underlined by having it 
appear physically similar to a dragon, taking up the archetypal motif of the serpent 
prevalent in Meso-American, Chinese, and also Christian and other cultures 
throughout the world.63 
Stealing Souls 
The Wraith are vampires, basically. They do not drink blood but steal life energy, 
which could be understood as nothing but a very slight difference in semantics. In 
a way, they do what the Goa’uld do, parasitizing on other cultures. And the more 
of them is revealed, the more it becomes clear that they also are religious symbols: 
they can give life as much as take it. 
                                                      
62  
This follows the motif of the Errand into the Darkness as outlined in Chapter 3, and also 
the idea that on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, vampires have to be invited in. Often-
times in religiously inspired fiction, there is no complete innocence but varying degrees of 
complicity and responsibility, and be it through fate. 
63  
As this element is important for other series as well, it will be discussed in Chapter 8.

Part Two: Case Studies 
 
“Life energy,” of course, is that old élan vital, something that makes “living” 
matter different from other, “dead” matter –– a point safely within the realm of 
pseudoscience, no matter how scientized the details may be throughout the run of 
the series. The Wraith are stealers of souls, yet contrary to the Goa’uld, their “evil” 
is due to their nature. They don’t appear able to find an alternative food source. By 
thus being limited in their options, their “evil” is only apparent in relation to their 
victims. As they do not have a choice, they cannot really be held accountable for 
their actions. The demonization of the Wraith then, after a while, is problematized 
by the creation of Michael, a Wraith who was turned human by the Atlantis team. 
He was lied to about his origins and his biology reverted back to his Wraith basics 
but without being able to shake his human characteristics entirely, making him an 
outcast. 
This follows the practice on Stargate of making the enemy more multifaceted 
and difficult. The enemy is given a complex face. Furthermore, by making the 
threat more personal, and by showing some elements of tragedy within the story of 
the enemy, this contributes to a more balanced account and may point towards a 
solution. This is the antithesis of the fundamentalist viewpoint of either/ors and 
relentless othering. Thus on this narrative level as well, the charge against funda-
mentalisms of any kind is made throughout the Stargate universe. 
Replicators 
Even though the Goa’uld are already a very powerful antagonist throughout the 
Stargate series, very early on the Replicators are introduced as a second menace to 
the universe.64 The almost child-like innocence of the Asgard is threatened by a 
powerful and relentless form of artificial intelligence, reminiscent somehow of Star 
Trek’s Borg and also Data’s brother Lore. The search for artificial life has always 
been a prime element of any science fiction. The transcending of machinery into 
the ranks of humanity is an illustration of the investigation of the human soul, and 
this is what is behind robot tales inspired by Asimov, like Star Trek’s Data, and oth-
ers –– these will be discussed in the next chapter. There are elements within Star-
gate’s Replicators as well that aim for that. There is also a different component 
though. 
As in most science fiction, the Other represents a side of humanity that is ei-
ther appealing or problematic. The Goa’uld on SG-1 can hardly be understood as 
an appealing choice, neither can the Wraith on Atlantis. In both series of the fran-
chise, however, Replicators pose as a second nemesis. On one hand, a partially reli-
gious enemy (Goa’uld posing as gods, Wraith more allegorically stealing “souls,” 
but also revered for their ability to grant life) and a more overtly religious one in the 
shape of the Ori stand in the corner of “too much religion,” while on the other end 
                                                      
64  
The Replicators can be read as an allegory for Richard Dawkins’ terminology (page 27). 

 
Chapter 6: Feeding False Gods 
91 
of foes, “too much science” appears to be the problem, grossly oversimplified. 
Humans stand in the middle and are torn between both alternatives. 
The Replicators, just as one would stereotypically expect from a computer, are 
cold, detached, purpose-oriented. The insistence upon their prime intent to repli-
cate does not really make them different from “organic” life, not from the point of 
view of science anyway. Yet human cultural discourse is oftentimes less direct 
about the issue of replication, and to purposely seek replication almost has the reli-
gious undertones of “be fruitful and multiply.” To attach this biblical motto from 
Genesis 1:28 to little robots must appear absurd, especially for those who have not 
been introduced to the replicator/vehicle view of nature, neither to artificial intelli-
gence. 
The fundamentalist scientism of the Replicators and the hegemonic-
fundamentalist religiosity of the Goa’uld, Wraith and Ori are thus set as two ex-
treme positions posing as their own corrective.

7. “PHOTONS BE FREE:” 
STAR TREK’S FOURTH DISCONTINUITY 
Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin. 
 –– Charles Darwin. The Descent of Man. 689. 
Outline: Star Trek: The Next Generation (TNG) and Star Trek: Voyager (VGR) each 
feature main characters that are artificial life forms, TNG’s Data being an android, 
VGR’s Doctor a hologram, Seven of Nine a (former) Borg. This raises issues of 
self-determination, consciousness and free will. 
7.1. Exposition 
Ever since the original Star Trek episode 2.24 “The Ultimate Computer,” the fran-
chise has dealt with questions of artificial life. Star Trek: The Motion Picture told the 
story of the return of a Voyager probe, which after having crashed on a “machine 
planet” (maybe an early unrecognized occurrence of the Borg?) is renamed 
“V’Ger” (or “Vejur”) and returns to Earth looking for its “creator,” desperately 
seeking to overcome the “lowly origin” of its creation in order to transcend to a 
higher state of consciousness. The computer/robot on an Errand into the Wilder-
ness and searching for revelation is, of course, a theme intimately tied to Arthur C. 
Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Isaac Asimov’s robot tales, the latter of 
which can be seen as an inspiration for how the Star Trek franchise deals with the 
problem of artificial intelligence. 
Star Trek: The Next Generation tells the story of the crew of the USS Enter-
prise, the flagship of the United Federation of Planets. Among its cast is the andro-
id Data, an artificial life form created by Dr. Noonian Soong. In his quest to be-
come more human, he is mentored by chief engineer Geordi LaForge, and by Cap-
tain Jean-Luc Picard. From very early on, and even more clearly throughout the 
movies, the duo of Picard and Data becomes the driving force of the entire series, 
and in particular the “evolution” of Data. 
Star Trek: Voyager is a modern Odyssey that has the crew of Voyager thrown 
into the “Delta Quadrant” of our galaxy 70’000 light years from home. On their 
voyage home, they are left to their own devices. The emergency medical hologram, 
type “Mark One,” intended only to temporarily assist in medical procedures, is ac-
tivated in a time of crisis, and after the death of the regular doctor he becomes the 
only medical doctor on board. He has been created in the image of Dr. Louis 
Zimmermann, a grumpy yet ingenious engineer whose idiosyncratic personality has 
made it different for the “Mark One” hologram to be put to larger use –– yet Voya-
ger’s doctor has no option but to stay online. He has no name and is only referred 

94 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
to as “Doctor.” Several attempts of his to find a name are unsuccessful; he remains 
defined by his role yet tries to “overcome” his programming. His mentor, Captain 
Kathryn Janeway, is in a difficult position and will, in case of doubt, often decide 
not in favor of his seeking to pursue personal betterment but rather in keeping his 
medical expertise. He finds a like mind in Seven of Nine, a woman rescued from 
the Borg. 
The Borg are a group of bio-mechanical hybrids. Biological life forms are 
“enhanced” with technological gadgets and networked into a “hive mind” that is 
both communication device and Big Brother. In TNG 3.26/4.01 “The Best of 
Both Worlds,” Captain Picard is made a Borg with the name of Locutus –– and 
even while this can be reversed, he will be haunted by his dual identity as both Pi-
card and Locutus for the remainder of his life. Similarly, Seven of Nine is de-
Borged by Captain Janeway and has to negotiate her existence as a not-quite-
human ex-Borg amongst a human “collective.”  
7.2. Franchise-Specific Themes 
“The Measure of a (Wo)Man:” Human Rights for Machines 
In the pilot episode “Encounter at Farpoint,” Cdr. Riker compares Data with Pi-
nocchio –– Carlo Collodi’s wooden puppet that dreams of becoming a real man. In 
a certain sense, Data is superior to ordinary humans: He is stronger, more durable, 
faster, more intelligent, more knowledgeable, and able to ingest information at a 
maddening speed. What is missing are emotions65 –– and a sense of belonging to 
humanity. This point is brought home in TNG 2.09 “The Measure of a Man,” 
wherein Data is supposed to be disassembled to gain information for the replica-
tion of other androids, which then could take up menial and dangerous tasks –– a 
                                                      
65  
Allegedly –– while it is true that Data maintains that he does not feel any emotions, his 
behavior oftentimes tells otherwise. Surely, the series chronicles the scientific understand-
ing of the mind and of emotions. Recent publications in the realm of evolutionary psychol-
ogy and theory do testify to a more complex understanding of emotionality, especially 
when taking a more functionalist approach (e.g. Harris 2004, Ridley 1996, Dennett 1991). 
In “practice,” Data may not recognize his emotions as such, but that only means that his un-
derstanding of emotionality is impaired, and many of his emotive senses are flattened. This 
was done to him by his “creator” Dr. Soong, and the counterexample is the emotive and 
selfish Lore. Yet Data apparently does feel insulted when lied to, he feels uneasy when 
threatened, he feels slightly saddened when his artificial daughter dies, and he can bond 
with his pet cat “Spot.” These narrative hints point to a rudimentary, functional emotionali-
ty. The emotion chip he acquires later on provides him with a full spectrum of emotions, if 
he wants to. Voyager’s Doctor, however, is much more evolved emotionally, it seems –– or 
rather, the understanding of emotionality has improved throughout the general run of Star 
Trek. The more science gains an understanding of the mind, and the more actual examples 
of AI will be possible, it might even turn out that emotions are a necessary consequence of 
a functioning mental machinery, be it of “natural” or “artificial” origins. 

 
Chapter 7: “Photons Be Free” 
95 
new slave race, as pointed out poignantly by Guinan, who is played by African-
American actress Whoopie Goldberg. In a trial, Data’s rights as an individual are 
investigated. The crux is, basically, whether he is alive, whether he has a soul. He 
wins, barely, on the argument that he possesses all visible signs of sentience. His 
soul cannot be measured, only the man –– or rather, the walking, talking, hoping 
combination of body and brain, whether mechanical or biological. 
In many ways, Data has an advantage over the Doctor. The android, at least, 
has a body, he commands over an identity distinct from the ship. The Doctor, 
however, is a program within the ship’s computer.66 He can, initially, be switched 
on and off at will, and his programming is subject to alterations and updates. He 
still, however, as a “hologram,” resembles a human male in the shape of his “crea-
tor.”67 The resulting image now of a man being switched on and off or repro-
grammed ad libitum appears rather dystopian. This can be remedied in part by the 
“mobile emitter” which provides the Doctor with freedom of movement, and by a 
policy that is being enacted which allows him to switch himself on and off by his 
own initiative. Yet the true scope of his peculiar condition is revealed in critical 
moments when the welfare of the ship and crew is seen as taking precedence over 
his: Janeway more often than not decides to curtail his freedom, like in episode 5.11 
“Latent Image,” in which the Doctor’s memories are altered by Janeway to “help” 
him deal with a conflict. This is supposed to enable him to continue his medical 
“duties,” and shows the priority of his function on board over his rights as an indi-
vidual. In another instance, once the Doctor discovers that highly intelligent Mark 
Ones that look like him are reduced to a life of menial and dangerous jobs, just be-
cause their personality is not as malleable as would be expected from a computer, 
he writes a holographic novel called “Photons Be Free” in which he likens his ser-
                                                      
66  
Another Roddenberry-inspired series, Andromeda, has the ship itself be represented in the 
holographic shape of a woman: the ship-machine is anthropomorphized. Conversely, Fars-
cape features a living ship, a Leviathan called Moya, steered by another living entity, Pilot. 
This can be understood as a further step in making machinery take human(ized) form. 
67  
Even though obviously an android or computer needs a builder, this may be seen as rein-
forcing Paley’s argument from design: An object that appears designed needs a designer. 
Dawkins (1996: 3) therefore distinguishes between designed and “designoid” (cf. also page 
33) –– pointing out that natural selection itself can bring about shapes and functions that 
appear designed consciously, but aren’t. In a certain way, Data and the Doctor can rein-
force both arguments. They illustrate how from “inanimate” matter, life may be created by 
human engineers. They do problematize the discourse of the soul as immaterial and prob-
lematic, yet the soul is still perceived to be “a problem.” In this sense, a religious archetype 
could still be assumed to lie dormant, this being illustrated by references to the male human 
creators of Data and the Doctor as such. Both have been made in the image of their “fa-
ther,” both aim to better themselves. Were we to see these artificial creatures as metaphors 
for humanity, would it be too bold to argue that an argument from design could be in-
ferred for the series, pointing to a creator, while a true evolutionary (not evolutionist!) 
perspective or even post-modern discussions of authorship and creation are generally miss-
ing? 

96 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
vice on board the Voyager to slavery (VGR 7.20 “Author, Author”). After all, even 
though he is qualified to be a doctor, he was never given a choice –– he does what he 
is expected, what he is programmed to do. His design is his fate. 
Seven of Nine, equally, appears to be on a voyage towards humanity –– but 
unlike Data and the Doctor, who seek companionship, she seeks liberation from 
the collective –– be it of Borg or human character. Her frequent squabbles with 
Capt. Janeway illustrate her dependency on the goodwill of the military chain of 
command, and her tendency to subvert these structures functions also as a critique 
of the hierarchy. Seven continually has to fight against the expectations of others 
regarding her social and gender status. When she finally develops a relationship 
with Chakotay, it is of her own free will and initiative –– while the Doctor, who is 
“coaching” her romantic instincts in an attempt to manipulate her feelings, finds 
that his affections remain unrequited. 
The Soul as Free Will 
CAPT. LOUVOIS: It sits there looking at me, and I don’t know what it is. […] Is Data a 
machine? Yes. Is he the property of Starfleet? No. We have all been dancing around the 
basic issue. Does Data have a soul? I don’t know that he has. I don’t know that I have! But 
I have got to give him the freedom to explore that question himself. It is the ruling of this 
court that Lieutenant Commander Data has the freedom to choose. (TNG 2.09 “The 
Measure of a Man,” 39:33-40:35) 
As the outcome of Data’s trial, humanity is somehow tied to the existence of the 
“soul” –– which, being an intangible and not provable thing, is somehow defined 
as “the freedom to choose.” In essence, we do not know whether we have a soul 
–– let’s just pretend we do. What we have then, is free will: Justified by the necessi-
ty to have it, and by the otherwise outrageous consequences if it were not granted: 
GUINAN: Consider that in the history of many worlds there have always been disposable 
creatures. They do the dirty work. They do the work that no one else wants to do, because 
it’s too difficult and too hazardous. With an army of Datas, all disposable, you don’t have 
to think about their welfare, or you don’t think about how they feel. Whole generations of 
disposable people. 
PICARD: You’re talking about slavery. 
GUINAN: I think that’s a little harsh. 
PICARD: I don’t think that’s a little harsh, I think that’s the truth. That’s the truth that we 
have obscured behind… a comfortable, easy euphemism. “Property.” But that’s not the is-
sue at all, is it? (TNG 2.09 “The Measure of a Man,” 31:01-31:56) 
The question of slavery precisely depends on the fact whether to grant fellow hu-
man beings that very same status as a human being68; and whether the freedom to 
                                                      
68  
… once that status has been enfranchised with certain rights, of course. If a human being is 
defined as a creature living in a valley of darkness and pain, or once the idea is considered 
normal that humans should be born in chains, the value of a human being is of course dif-
ferent. In the context at hand, though, natural law, human rights, and the social contract 

 
Chapter 7: “Photons Be Free” 
97 
choose one’s own destiny should be granted. The question of the soul complicates 
things unnecessarily, and the only sensible thing to do is to redefine it as an ethical 
problem: Whose agency is acceptable, whose isn’t. The question of human rights 
may appear settled (for now, in most countries). The question of animal rights still 
hinges on the awkward refusal of many if not most humans to recognize their own 
mammalian nature, conceding that the line between humans and animals is a fine 
one, and that the discourse relating to the soul and ethics should rather be faced in 
the light of inducing or alleviating pain and suffering (Harris 2004, 170-203). Star 
Trek, like other science fiction, pushes the agenda into the (today) absurd arena of 
artificial life in order to get to the core of the matter. The question is not so much 
whether Data is a machine; that is well established. The crux of the matter is almost 
perfectly hidden in the judge’s dismissal in the Star Trek episode cited above: “Does 
Data have a soul? I don’t know that he has. I don’t know that I have!” 
If, however, we do not only look at our mammalian nature as animal, but con-
tinue to look at the biological machinery, and continue to apply the knowledge ga-
thered from that, a more complex and, as some would say, more disturbing picture 
would emerge: If the existence of the soul cannot be determined for neither hu-
mans, nor animals, nor machines, and if, furthermore, biological beings are rather 
machine-like, except that they are “designed” by evolution, and not by Paley’s 
“watchmaker” (Dawkins 1986), what do we do with the allegory of the soul, what is 
free will, who may have it –– and who has it? 
The Fourth Discontinuity 
Freud (1917) noticed that mankind had to thrice learn that their position in the uni-
verse as the central being was toppled. Notwithstanding the assumed existence of 
gods, mankind used to believe it was situated in the center of the universe. Coper-
nicus was not the first but the most suggestive in a line of thinkers who finally suc-
ceeded in overthrowing that argument: The sun, not the Earth, was the center of 
the solar system –– and science continues to show the ordinariness of our Earth’s 
position in the universe. Charles Darwin is responsible for making the second blow 
to the ego of mankind sound feasible: evolution through natural selection can not 
only thoroughly explain the emergence and existence of life, but it ties human be-
ings closely into the web of life, making them what Jared Diamond has termed the 
“Third Chimpanzee” (1992). The third wounding blow Freud modestly attributes 
to his own theory of the human unconscious and the thus limited reign of the con-
scious mind over its own desires and machinations. This line of thought is further 
complicated by recent postulations in the realm of memetic theory, as outlined in 
Chapter 2. 
                                                                                                                                                                      
have already contributed to a picture of humanity that is empowering and can be used to 
continually demand the consequential fulfillment of this promise of sisterly (and brotherly) 
citizenship. 

98 
Part Two: Case Studies 
 
Bruce Mazlish (1993) postulates that the fourth such blow, the fourth discon-
tinuity, is the rise of conscious machines, and the melding of human biology with 
technology. This, of course, has already been “done” in science fiction. Further-
more, complex structures can arise and create stable situations as in Richard Daw-
kins’ Blind Watchmaker simulation69 and the game of Life.70 Consciousness may 
very well just be a necessary byproduct of the evolution of the complex mind, and 
there may be various stages of complexity of consciousness as well.71 What happens 
with Voyager’s doctor, i.e. his “exceeding” his programming, may just be a conse-
quential evolutionary step arising out of the complexities of a functioning mind 
adapting to complicated surroundings. 
In the case of Artificial Intelligence, the conscious mind is revealed to be a re-
sult of programming –– yet the program itself becomes aware of its conditioned 
nature. 
«««»»» 
There is a further component to the increasingly complex view of consciousness, 
and this is presented by the memetic view itself. After having provided a closer 
look at some crucial examples of religious fictions in the Mythological Genre, this 
investigation will now move on to systematize these findings and apply a memetic 
perspective.

8. POINTS OF COMPARISON: 
RECURRING PATTERNS & ELEMENTS 
Sì, abbiamo un’ anima. Ma è fatta di tanti piccoli robot. 
–– Yes, we have a soul. But it’s made of lots of tiny robots. 
 –– Giulio Giorelli, in an interview with Daniel Dennett (in: Dennett 2003: 1). 
Outline: The threads of the five expositional chapters are brought together. Further 
common themes are introduced. 
8.1. Recapitulation 
In addition to the examples discussed in the previous chapters, there are, of course, 
many more instances of religious thinking in the Mythological Genre. This is in-
evitably tied to the narrative depth established with a true serialization of the for-
mat. One of the first examples thus would be Magnum, p.i., which in its final two 
seasons has him die and come back from the dead. More thoroughly permeated by 
religious ideas, however, would be David Lynch’s Twin Peaks, which contains direct 
discussions of dreams, souls, doppelgangers, transmutations and animal symbolism, 
tied in to Native American traditions, and even featuring a Native American cast 
member in the form of Hawk. The J. J. Abrams shows Alias, Lost, and Fringe, but 
even his college drama Felicity contain references to and topoi of religious thinking, 
not just on a dialog but on a structural level. The most current example in the realm 
of science fiction would, of course, be the new version of Battlestar Galactica, which 
features an abundance of astrological symbolism, Greek mythology, artificial life 
and New Age shamanism. Farscape as well contains some religious elements. 
In a culture that is interspersed with religious mythology, this would of course 
not be surprising. In the following, a more general picture shall emerge by drawing 
from what has already been introduced in the previous chapters. 
Errand into the Wilderness 
The Errand speaks of an investigative component in some (yet sadly, not all) reli-
gious thinking. It can be seen as a physical exodus or walkabout, intentional or in-
advertently, as in the many tales of colonization, exploration, or contemporary ver-
sions of the Odyssey and Robinson Crusoe. In all these instances, the physical Errand is 
connected with a philosophical one, an investigation of the depths of the human 
psyche or soul, often pioneering borderline topics of science and ethics.  
Prophecy and Free Will 
Notions of prophecy, destiny and fate permeate the Mythological Genre. This is 
sometimes tied to Christian eschatological thought, most frequently though it fol-

102 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
lows a narcissist model of presenting a main character as somehow chosen, elected, 
special –– and as possessing a specific destiny of mission. The grander the narrative 
appears, the more it details a future, the more restricted the actually possible deeds 
of the protagonists become, and free will appears increasingly as an illusion and an 
inward-bound move towards self-betterment. 
The Soul 
The soul functions as the agent of free will. Possessing a “soul” means to have 
more or less free agency, responsibility for one’s actions, and a potential for both 
damnation and salvation. Souls can be possessed, stolen, or even modified. Aside 
from the religious components, “soul” can oftentimes also mean “psyche,” thus 
allowing for psychological and psycho-analytical readings. 
False Gods 
The quest for free will results in resistance to established authority. This can be the 
government, a clandestine conspiracy, a cult, forces of “darkness,” old and power-
ful aliens or those posing as gods. Most often, these gods will function as (or di-
rectly reference) pagan gods, while the underlying tenor of the series could (but 
need not) follow a Christian/Protestant paradigm. 
Artificial Intelligence 
As a challenge to biological life, artificial, human-made life is positioned. This 
sometimes contains a warning relating to something like technological/scientist 
fundamentalism (as in the case of Stargate’s Replicators and Star Trek’s Borg) or as a 
continuing story of emancipation, but this time on a technological basis –– not as a 
revolution against biological fate (which technology will have already overcome) 
but against society and culture (which may be socio-biologically mandated) –– an 
emancipation of the “pure” mind, the idea, the meme. 
8.2. Themes Across Franchises 
While the preceding chapters have introduced several franchises and detailed some 
idiosyncratic elements that could be found throughout the Mythological Genre, but 
could nevertheless be said to constitute specific aspects of the respective examples 
in the case studies, the following brief vignettes will show that many more similari-
ties and parallelisms occur throughout the genre, and that these furthermore point 
to a shared religious outlook. 
Alien-Human Hybridity 
All case studies in this investigation feature some kind of alien-human hybridity. In 
most cases, hybridity is marked as problematic, with only few exceptions.  

 
Chapter 8: Points of Comparison 
103 
Within the Babylon 5 franchise, Delenn is a Minbari who decides to alter her 
appearance to look more human. Physically, she is a Minbari-human hybrid, but 
this does not pertain to her mind, it is merely about the look. Also concerning hu-
mans and Minbari, their souls are said to be linked; even more so, in the first Baby-
lon 5 telefilm “In the Beginning” it is revealed that the human Sinclair “has a Min-
bari soul” (83:22-83:30). Sinclair will continue to become Valen, the religious leader 
and prophet of the Minbari. If hybridity is seen positively, then only when both 
parties involved are decidedly good. Once the Vorlons are problematized as having 
their own agenda, mergers or cooperation with them become highly dubious. Es-
pecially in connection with the Shadows and their allies, but otherwise as well, neg-
ative examples of hybridity prevail on Babylon 5. The Drakh control Emperor Mol-
lari through a creature called “Keeper,” which fuses with its victim and can effec-
tively monitor the victim’s thoughts and prevent any action contrary to the Kee-
per’s interest. 
The search for an alien-human hybrid on The X-Files is part of the govern-
ment conspiracy to find a vaccine against alien invasion, but hybridity here is only 
seen as a means to an end, not as something positive. Similarly, on Stargate, both 
Goa’uld hosts and Wraith can be read as diseased alien-human hybrids, in one case 
through the Goa’uld serpent itself, in the other through the evolution of the Wraith 
by combining human and Iratus bug DNA. The “good” Goa’uld, the Tok’ra, be-
have oftentimes as shadowy as the Goa’uld and cannot generally be trusted, singu-
lar exceptions more often than not proving that rule. In the Buffy/Angel franchise, 
vampires function as demon-human hybrids, and there, similarly, this is not seen as 
positive. Exceptional characters like Angel and Spike attest to that by having to 
prove their worthiness day by day. Hybridity, in these contexts, is seen as a dark 
legacy. 
On Star Trek, hybridity is not generally seen as negative –– and indeed, much 
is made of the fact that Spock is a Human-Vulcan and B’Elanna Torres a Human-
Klingon hybrid. Other cast members have “mixed” heritage as well. While Seven of 
Nine as a Borg is a direct technological/biological hybrid, the same could be said of 
Data and the Doctor as well, as they exhibit a human shape, possess a human crea-
tor, and struggle with human ethics and morality. Hybridity, however, still remains 
as a marker that can be used for questioning loyalty whenever convenient. If hy-
bridity exists but is invisible, panic ensues. Deep Space Nine’s Changelings provide just 
such a challenge (DS9 4.11f “Homefront”/“Paradise Lost”). And even though xe-
nophobia is postulated to be a thing of the past (Enterprise 4.20f “Demons”/“Terra 
Prime”), being different still remains an issue that can prove to be deeply troubling 
to the individual, just as in the cases of Spock and B’Elanna Torres. Consequently, 
all such “hybrids” appear to have to deal with issues surrounding their identity, 
which is furthermore composed of essentialist notions of what it means to be Hu-
man or Klingon or Vulcan etc. B’Elanna and Worf, for instance, are torn between 
what is expected from their human and their Klingon side as well (while Worf’s hy-

104 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
bridity is cultural: he is biologically Klingon but was raised by humans from Russia 
–– which neatly plays on the analogy between Klingons and Russians that was cru-
cial for the Original Series). 
All these instances of essentialism and identity politics show that there re-
mains a fascination with “purity.” Poignantly, on The X-Files, the government 
project dedicated to create a human-alien hybrid for the purposes of fighting the 
aliens is called “Purity Control” (X 1.24 “The Erlenmeyer Flask”). The fear of hy-
bridity is a fear of divided loyalties, and it is countered by asserting control. This is 
justified as necessary in most parts of the genre, especially when hybrid identity is 
simply seen as a marker denoting evil (cf. Kneis 2010c). 
Of course the Wraith or the Goa’uld or vampires are a threat to humanity in the 
respective stories. The antagonism thus may be justified within the fictional work at 
hand. As an allegory for reality, however, the literal demonization of the enemy is 
problematic once this becomes a way of understanding the real world, especially if 
some of the conflicts depicted within a fictitious context feature recognizable 
themes of contemporary politics. The conflict between Earth and the Xindi in the 
third season of Star Trek: Enterprise begins with a massive terror attack hitting an 
area from Florida to Venezuela at the end of season two, and the consequent hunt 
for the perpetrators. Captain Archer has to act quickly and decisively: “We don’t 
have the luxury of being safe or cautious anymore” (ENT 3.01 “The Xindi,” 4:51-
4:55). His ethics oftentimes have to be “adapted” to the situation. The sense of re-
venge, the belief in the end justifying the means, and traces of Manichaeism are 
prevalent: 
CDR. TUCKER: I can’t wait to get in there, Captain. Find the people who did this. And 
tell me we won’t be tip-toeing around. None of that non-interference crap T’Pol’s always 
shoving down our throats. Maybe it’s a good thing she’s leaving. 
CAPT. ARCHER: We’ll do what we have to, Trip. Whatever it takes. (ENT 2.26 “The Ex-
panse,” 29:28-29:53) 
Here, the “non-interference crap” (which will later evolve into the Prime Directive) 
is decidedly attributed to the Vulcan T’Pol. Her presence on board the Enterprise is 
seen as weakening the sense of righteous retribution; the thought of her leaving 
allows for discourse to be simpler. Thus, in times of crisis, it is made clear that an 
alien, however loyal, however devoted, however essential to the functioning of the 
human crew is still just that: alien, other. Even though the series manages to some-
how maintain Star Trek’s values towards the end, the similarities of the rhetoric in 
the American “War on Terror” are striking.72 
                                                      
72  
I am not arguing that somehow Enterprise takes a decided pro-war stance. Things within 
season three become more complex, and the loss of ethics and diversity is depicted as un-
fortunate. What the show does is to capture a specific moment in history and allegorize it. 
The similarity in the rhetoric can be read as a comment on contemporary politics, and the 
conclusion of the series could even function as a criticism, especially in season four. Never-

Ancients 
Contemporary culture always stands in the shadow of the past. While in many 
modern societies it is believed that –– despite gratitude to some “enlightened pre-
cursors” –– today’s world is more advanced and somehow critically “better” than 
anything in the greater past. Though this may, in many ways, not be wrong, espe-
cially with regard to redefining ethics in relation to human rights in general and 
women’s rights, multiculturalism, slavery, cruel and unusual punishment and free-
dom of speech in particular (cf. Hitchens 2007, Dawkins 2006), this also perpe-
tuates a false belief in some kind of linear progression of human history in a (Hege-
lian) ideology of progress (cf. Loewen 1996). 
Religious and magical thinking in general are diametrically opposed to this 
kind of thinking. Past legacy is not only to be respected, it most often is to be re-
vered. Talk of “church fathers” and even “founding fathers” points to paternal fig-
ures in the past who surely knew best. All we present mortals can do is live up to 
their sacred examples and look up to them in awe. Within the Mythological Genre, 
this thinking is rampant –– and various “Ancients” frequent the storylines. On The 
X-Files, the alien virus is older than other life on Earth. On Babylon 5, the hyper-
space Jumpgates were constructed by the “first ones,” which remain very powerful, 
and humans and “younger races” walk among these like ants amongst giants. Simi-
larly in the Stargate franchise, the Stargates were constructed by the “Ancients,” 
who continue to yield not only physical but discursive power. The demons and 
Christian-inspired devils on Millennium and in the Buffy/Angel franchise are older 
and meaner than any human. On Star Trek, humanoid life has been spawned 
throughout the galaxy by the “Preservers” (TNG 6.20 “The Chase”). On Enterprise, 
the ancient Sphere-Builders act like gods, so do the Prophets on Deep Space Nine. 
Gender Roles 
CAPT. CARTER: I’m an Air Force officer just like you are, Colonel. And just because my 
reproductive organs are on the inside instead of the outside doesn’t mean I can’t handle 
whatever you can handle. (SG-1 1.01 “Children of the Gods,” 23:49-23:58) 
All franchises under discussion here feature strong female characters. Yet with the 
exception of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Star Trek: Voyager, these women are not 
really in charge. Even if that is the case nominally, like on Stargate: Atlantis in sea-
sons 1-4, they are relegated to a position removed from the action, and a male will 
take charge of the more serious military activities. The very fact that Samantha 
Carter on Stargate: SG-1 has to prove her worth as a fighting member more than the 
men around her puts her state of emancipation into context: Yes, she is holding a 
strong position in a team which is predominantly male; yes, she is a physicist; yes, 
she is a fighter; –– but no, this is not seen as normal, it is shown as desirable, yet 
                                                                                                                                                                      
theless, the depiction of otherness, the sense of threat, and the problems with hybridity 
remain: Of course, the more war-prone Xindi factions are those that look most alien.  

106 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
nevertheless deviant from the norm. Especially within Star Trek, women in charge 
tend to be presented as if this was a big issue. They seem aware that their position 
of authority is probably tentative: any sign of weakness, and a mutiny could ensue; 
any sign of too much force, and they will be deemed irrational. Were B’Elanna 
Torres a man, no one would probably think she was unstable emotionally, she 
would just be a very tough guy able to assert dominance and willingness to lead. 
The strong woman in the Mythological Genre is still primarily defined as a 
woman. The uniform style of the original Star Trek speaks volumes: Women wear 
shorts. For The Next Generation, it takes six seasons and a replacement captain to 
provide Counselor Troi with a standard uniform that does not highlight her female 
“qualities” (TNG 6.10 “Chain of Command, Part 1”).73 There is nothing wrong, of 
course, with displaying femininity –– but if that’s the expected paradigm, and if a 
woman can be punished for deviating from it, it becomes a problem. Men appear 
free in their choice, women are caught up in decorum, and they may be relegated to 
be seen as merely decorum. The “tough woman” has to be “balanced” by a gentler 
version. Delenn on Babylon 5 clearly is a fighter; but she also is the emotional coun-
terpart to the stoicism of Sheridan. When it comes to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, an 
emancipatory narrative is obvious, as outlined in the respective chapter in more 
detail. With the move to Angel, however, we find a male-centered show, with typical 
damsel-in-distress situations and a predominantly male cast doing predominantly 
male things. However, even the heroines can be read as male figures, as Clover 
(1992: 53) shows at the example of films like Alien, which features Sigourney 
Weaver as a strong, fighting woman: 
If the slasher film is “on the face of it” a genre with at least a strong female presence, it is 
in these figurative readings a thoroughly male exercise, one that finally has very little to do 
with femaleness and very much to do with phallocentrism. Figuratively seen, the Final Girl 
is a male surrogate in things oedipal, a homoerotic stand-in […] She is simply an agreed-
upon fiction and the male viewer’s use of her as a vehicle for his own sadomasochistic fan-
tasies an act of perhaps timeless honesty. 
Most apparent is the gendered focus when it comes to the depiction and inclusion 
(most often exclusion) of homosexuality (cf. Mendlesohn 2002). Star Trek is noto-
rious for having an awkward position towards it, and when it is mentioned, it is 
                                                      
73  
The “problem” of gender trouble is most apparent in the in-built anti-progressive direction 
taken by the most recent show in the Star Trek canon, Enterprise. Females therein are clearly 
at a disadvantage. Even though the Vulcan T’Pol is the 1st officer, she holds this post at 
Captain Archer’s request after her falling out with the Vulcan hierarchy. Her femininity 
troubles her, and she needs the hyper-male engineer Trip to find herself, as a woman. The 
linguist Hoshi only figures as an occasional sideshow. Clearly, the show is set before the 
first Star Trek series, and the producers probably decided to show less advanced gender sit-
uations therefore, yet this only reveals the belief that the past, generally speaking, was al-
ways less advanced socially. Or does it reflect a deliberate change to a more conservative 
gender (and race!) model than on Voyager and Deep Space Nine?

treated as a big taboo.74 There is no homosexuality at all on Babylon 5, The X-Files, 
Millennium or Angel. There is none on Stargate: SG-1 75 and Atlantis, although Stargate: 
Universe does depict a lesbian relationship. There is homosexuality on Buffy the Vam-
pire Slayer. However, Andrew, who is gay, has also a history of being “evil” in sea-
son 6 –– he is clearly depicted as abnormal, and is treated as a prisoner throughout 
most of season 7. Willow discovers her being gay –– yet she is also a nerd, a.k.a. 
not normal, and a witch. Furthermore, her gay partner is killed. Resistance to the 
governing paradigm is futile, and male homosexuality is still connected to deviance: 
ANGELUS to SPIKE: Don’t mistake me, I do love the ladies. It’s just lately I’ve been 
wondering what it’d be like to share the slaughter of innocents with another man? [sounds 
aroused] Don’t think that makes me some kind of a deviant, hmm, do you? (A 5.08 “Desti-
ny” 02:04-2:42) 
Romantic Stereotypes and Psychotic Narration 
The prevalence of romantic stereotypes in the Mythological Genre extends beyond 
questions of gender. Medieval romance is coupled with a cult of heroism that se-
riously goes against scientific and democratic notions. There is a split between mili-
tary command structures (most often within science fiction) and rogue anarchic 
groups (most often within fantasy) –– yet even the military structures most of the 
time stand in stark contrast to a larger hierarchy. On Star Trek, the ship’s (or sta-
tion’s) commander more often than not stands at odds with Starfleet Command or 
the Federation Council (both are frequently shown to be misguided, corrupt or dys-
functional). Stargate Command is usually at odds with the “civilian” (i.e. presuma-
bly democratically elected) authorities and other governments. Fox Mulder, Dana 
Scully and Frank Black are rogues per definition, so are Buffy, Angel and their little 
anarchic cells of demon fighters. On Babylon 5, Sheridan declares the station inde-
pendent –– granted, Earth has a fascist government. But the democratic govern-
ments before and after aren’t portrayed lovingly either. Sheridan himself, once be-
coming president, is shown to be more of a monarch than a democrat. He is a king 
by any other name (Cf. Kneis 2010b). 
The cult of heroism which is central to the genre as such can be seen as a cen-
tral manifestation of psychotic narration (cf. Flor & Kneis 2007) in feeding mega-
lomania, but also carrying a decidedly narcissistic component. The warrior with a 
cause becomes the more grand the more s/he stands out from the general popula-
tion; s/he can only be a hero if the action undertaken stands at odds to everyone 
                                                      
74  
This is made clear by the notorious obsession of some fans that interpret the male bonding 
between Kirk and Spock in a very specific way –– simply referred to as K/S (e.g. on thy-
la.com). The Delta Quadrant of Venus (tenderware.home.gate.net) does the same with Jane-
way and Seven (sites last accessed 12/29/09). 
75  
However, when one looks at the Goa’uld arch-nemesis Apophis in the first seasons, one 
cannot help but wonder about his “queer” looks –– golden makeup, mascara, perfect tan; a 
fitting stereotype of the “other.” 

108 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
else, or at least to a majority. The world of the hero is, first and foremost, the world 
according to the hero. In this psychotic and narcissistic view, nothing happens without 
a reason, everything is somehow related to one’s own personal “fate,” and vindica-
tion is just around the corner. The fight is personal, and it is oftentimes (mostly in 
the genre of fantasy) carried out with antiquated or short-range weapons, or by 
teams or armies smaller than believable. Hand-to-hand combat is always preferred. 
The self-centeredness of such a text is occasionally ironically broken, but this 
break has become almost a standard, a sub-genre of its own within the Mythologi-
cal Genre.76 This, while questioning the entire outlook of the fantastical frame, 
however works to continue to swear in the audience on the common delusion (Flor 
& Kneis 2007, 74). 
Advanced Humans and Ascension 
Regularly throughout the genre, advanced and/or ascended humans appear. This, 
often but not always, is seen in the context of the “evolution”77 of the soul, some-
times the body. Superior bodies sometimes occur without superior “souls” (as in 
the case of the Supersoldiers appearing on The X-Files or Stargate: SG-1, or the hu-
man-demon-techno hybrid Adam in Buffy’s season 4) or as steps on the way to-
wards “ascension,” as Stargate’s Hok’Tars (ep. 5.06 “Rite of Passage”). This notion 
of evolutionism is widespread in science fiction. It is believed that there is a direc-
tion to human evolution, that there is progress and that it will lead to some sort of 
out-of-body post-human existence, often called a “higher plane of existence.” 
This could be, but in my opinion should not be interpreted in merely Christian 
terms, and shows a more general level of religious thinking. Christianity knows as-
cension, of course, but only as a very singular event: Christ ascended. At least for 
Orthodox Christians and Catholics (for them officially only since 1950), Mary as-
cended too. Ordinary humans or saints may be able to enter heaven, but they do 
not bodily ascend. Christian fundamentalism, however, has the rapture –– but this 
happens as a single event in conjunction with the end of the world. Scientology 
“knows” of a higher state of consciousness, in which “Clears” may be able to see 
beyond the pain induced by Thetan souls, and may even be able to transgress the 
limits of the physical. Somehow, there are no reported occasions of this yet. Espe-
                                                      
76  
For a more thorough discussion, cf. Flor & Kneis 2007. Examples are Buffy 6.17 “Normal 
Again” (2002), TNG 6.21 “Frame of Mind” (1993), DS9 6.13 “Far Beyond the Stars” 
(1998). Very revealingly, in Stargate: SG-1’s early seasons, the main title sequence focuses on 
the eye of Richard Dean Anderson/Jack O’Neill, then shows the iris, and then the image of 
the iris begins to rotate and change into the Stargate –– a very solipsistic perspective. 
77  
Evolution here cannot be understood in the technical sense but the “everyday” under-
standing of meaning “development towards something better” –– “better” here does not 
necessarily mean better adapted, but morally better, or on a different, higher “stage” of de-
velopment. This is more scientist than scientific, more about evolutionism than evolution, 
of course, and betrays a commonplace misunderstanding of evolution. 

 
Chapter 8: Points of Comparison 
109 
cially Stargate’s Ori religion seems to be akin to scientology in this regard, promising 
their followers ascension. Conventional ghosts may be seen as different forms of 
consciousness, but, again, not in the Christian context (where they are often haunt-
ing characters whose fate is not really desirable) but more in a “primal,” “animist” 
sense.  
Conventional ascension within the genre follows two overlapping stereotypes. 
The first is as an outcome of “natural” evolution. For instance, in Babylon 5, episode 
4.22 “The Deconstruction of Falling Stars,” an advanced human is shown a million 
years in the future. This human is similar to the Vorlons and has become an energy 
being able to take human form. This may also be the fate of humans on Star Trek 
(if the Q Continuum or the Traveler are understood as outcomes of evolutionary 
trajectories that started with “normal,” corporeal life forms) and Stargate. Millennium 
follows too much a Christian paradigm to allow for that. 
The second stereotype is ascension within a human’s lifetime (and not 
through death or evolution), on their own accounts or with the help of others. This 
occurs on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel and Stargate.78 On Buffy, Mayor Wilkins as-
cends on his own accord to become a big dragon, on Angel, Cordelia is raptured to 
some other dimension by probably evil forces, and Daniel Jackson enters the group 
of the ascended Ancients through intervention by Oma Desala (Mother Nature). 
Ascension on Stargate means something like entry into the Q Continuum, a society 
of god-like transcendental beings who, if they only wanted, would be omnipotent.  
Death and Resurrection 
Death is common in the Mythological Genre. It is not necessarily final, however. 
Mulder hovers between life and death and speaks to his dead father and Deep 
Throat in 3.01 “The Blessing Way,” Sheridan on Babylon 5 dies on Z’ha’dum but is 
given life again by Lorien, Angel is killed by Buffy yet survives, Buffy is killed yet 
resurrected, Spike too dies but returns. Notwithstanding the frequent use of 
Goa’uld sarcophagi to resurrect people, Daniel Jackson on Stargate: SG-1 dies, as-
cends and is re-made a human. On Star Trek, the most iconic example of resurrec-
tion is Spock himself. Kirk dies in Star Trek: Generations, yet can be brought back 
(though he is granted rest finally). Death by the enemy is an honor; resurrection the 
mark of the true hero. 
Élan Vital 
Life is special, and Henri Bergson’s élan vital is alive and kicking in the genre. Most 
literally, and following Leviticus 17.14, vampire fiction like Buffy and Angel centers 
on blood. The Wraith on Stargate: Atlantis suck “life energy” out of their victims, 
                                                      
78  
The ascension of Daniel Jackson in Stargate: SG-1 episode 5.21 “Meridian” was broadcast 
May 10, 2002, the ascension of Cordelia Chase in Angel 3.22 “Tomorrow” just ten days lat-
er on May 20, 2002. 

110 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
and even though scientist explanations are offered throughout the series on a pie-
cemeal basis, Bergson’s élan shines through very clearly, and in many ways, the 
Wraith are just a new breed of vampires. Less directly, the Goa’uld sarcophagi on 
Stargate: SG-1 restore health and life by giving energy. On Babylon 5, Lorien resur-
rects Sheridan and prolongs his life by giving from his own. In another storyline, an 
alien device conceived as a means of capital punishment transfers “life energy” 
from one person to another (ep. 1.22 “The Quality of Mercy,” 4.20 “Endgame”). 
Blood also signifies descent and legacy, which becomes important on Stargate, 
this time on a more scientific/scientist level. Jack O’Neill is considered “special” 
(following also the Romantic/Psychotic Stereotype) because he carries the Lantean 
gene79 necessary for operating Lantean equipment, and so will the Atlantis team. 
Lantean blood is in their body, and descent from the Ancients is established via 
genetic blood quanta. Mankind is even called the “fifth race.”80 
The fixation on blood and life-force on The X-Files is scientized by tying it to a 
narrative of bodily violation, and by prodigy via progeny (Scully’s and Mulder’s mi-
racle child) or through special descent (Mulder’s biology being a key to human-alien 
hybrids). 
Dreams and Visions 
Dreams and visions are used throughout the genre. Contrary to scientific and psy-
cho-analytical knowledge, though, they are seen as portentous and always carry 
meaning beyond the daily worries and the histories of the individual. A “normal” 
interpretation of dreams is rare to the point of non-existence, and visionary expe-
riences are usually not relegated to sleep deprivation, wishful thinking, cultural in-
doctrination, biological predisposition, drugs, or even honest mistakes. 
This holds most certainly true for the lore of alien abductions (cf. Shermer 
1997: 88-98), and thus for one central theme of The X-Files. However, if one takes 
the show seriously, and also considers Millennium, a possible link between “alien” 
experimentation and child abuse or sexual trauma could be established, and it is 
made in both shows on a narrative level.81 Bodily harm comes through humans 
more often than through aliens. 
                                                      
79  
In Part 2 of his Documentary Enemies of Reason (2007), Richard Dawkins interviews Elisis 
Livingstone, a faith healer, who diagnoses a lack of specific DNA structures in today’s hu-
mans, structures “we” had back in Atlantis, referring to the “Akashic record” (4:11-5:42) 
and thus to Theosophy. 
80  
Martin Gardner (1954: 168-172) provides a useful exposition on the Theosophical myths of 
Atlantis and Lemuria/Mu: Helena Petrovna Blavatsky has postulated five “root races” on 
Earth so far –– the fifth race being the Aryans, who came from Atlantis. A sixth race will 
come from them and rise in Southern California. 
81 
Abuse and abduction are central themes on both shows, and both share similar themes. In 
several ways, Millennium appears to be more reality-based than The X-Files, and its killers

Torture 
So be alert, be wise and think. What is this status that the best of mankind wished for him-
self? He [Mohammed] wished to be a martyr. He himself said, “By him in whose hands my 
life is! I would love to attack and be martyred, then attack again and be martyred, then at-
tack again and be martyred.” (Osama bin Laden in a tape released by CNN 07/15/2007, 
quoting the Hadith Sahih Bukhari, Book 52 “Fighting for the Cause of Allah (Jihaad),” 
Number 54). 
Martyrdom is a key method of witnessing one’s faith for some religions. It is also a 
key method of hero-construction. A martyr need not necessarily die; the important 
part is witnessing (martyrein) by suffering torture from the hands of a non-believer 
or enemy who is trying to convert the tortured one away from the just cause. This 
oftentimes takes place in situations which are set up like seductions by the devil, a 
role Q plays on Star Trek, for instance. 
Torture is prevalent in all series discussed. Every single main character has under-
gone torture or extreme duress bordering on torture at least once; men, women and 
artificial beings. From Scully’s abduction and violation (X 2.08 “One Breath”), the 
torture of Delenn and Sheridan by the Inquisitor sent by the Vorlons (B5 2.21 
“Comes the Inquisitor”), the torture of Giles by Angelus (B 2.22 “Becoming, Part 
2”), General O’Neill’s repeated torture and resurrection by Baal (SG-1 6.06 “Ab-
yss”) to Picard’s torture by the hands of the Cardassian Gul Madred (TNG 6.10-11 
“Chain of Command”) –– to only name the most iconic ones for each franchise –– 
the hero’s will is put into question, and so is her or his ability to go on and fight the 
good fight. As the outcome of these trials of fire, of course, the hero’s determina-
tion is strengthened and her or his righteous conviction becomes clearer. 
Serpents and Arachnoids/Insectoids 
ANGEL: Personally, I’d like to slay the dragon. (A 5.22 “Not Fade Away,” 41:05-41:10) 
Archetypical imagery of snakes as serpents and of spider-like creatures (arachnoids 
or also insectoids) is found throughout the genre, which speaks to a use of arche-
typal images (cf. Wilson 1998: 78, 85-88; Jung 1961: 50-53) in order to arouse fear 
and awe in the unconscious. From a memetic perspective, of course, there may on-
ly be little choice in the use of such materials –– their occurrence may not at all be 
voluntary but governed as much by unconscious desires and fears and the memetic 
drive of the genre. 
Serpent-like are Mayor Wilkins after ascension on Buffy the Vampire Slayer (B 
3.21-22 “Graduation Day”), as much as many reptilian demons and the dragon in 
the final episode of Angel. Reptilian aliens are also the Drazi and Narn on Babylon 5 
                                                                                                                                                                      
and monsters are less allegorical (despite the occasional devil). Given their parallel character 
now, it could be argued that similar events in both shows point to an equation that basically 
says: allegorical monster on the X-Files means real-life killer on Millennium, and thus a sug-
gestive link between alien abduction tales and tales of real abuse could be made.

and the Goa’uld symbiotes on Stargate. Apophis (Apep) himself is symbolized by a 
serpent or dragon. The Klingons on Star Trek contain some reptilian physiognomy 
since Star Trek: The Motion Picture, other reptilians are found amongst the Xindi and 
the Gorn. A dragon also appears on Stargate: SG-1 (ep. 10.10-11 “The Quest”). 
While serpents as dragons or reptilians carry some sense of danger or exotic-
cism, arachnoids and insectoids present a much stronger sense of danger. The Grey 
aliens on The X-Files with their enlarged eyes closely resemble a praying mantis. The 
Shadows on Babylon 5 have something like a Mantis head attached to a spider’s 
body, while their ships look decidedly spider-like. On Buffy and Angel, there are oc-
casionally demons with insectoid/arachnoid features, and the First Evil appears as 
a giant spider in 3.10 “Amends.” On Stargate, the basic Replicator units look and 
move decidedly spider- or crab-like. The Re’tu are clearly insectoid. On Star Trek, 
the original concept for the Borg was insectoid (Sander 1994: 349), which still 
shows in calling the Borg structure a “hive” (which is also the term used for the 
Wraith organizational units in Stargate: Atlantis). There’s also an insectoid species of 
Xindi on Star Trek: Enterprise. Furthermore, the Tholians feature an arachnoid body 
while their ships are feared for weaving a web.  
The Cave, The Watcher, The Philosopher, and Atlantis: Platonism 
Instances of Platonism on Babylon 5 can be found in the Minbari caste system and 
the figure of the philosopher king Sheridan. Star Trek TNG’s Picard occupies that 
role as well. The ideal of the philosopher, or phylax, is literally taken over by the 
role of the Watcher on Buffy and Angel. The Watcher’s council is a representation of 
a Platonic caste system (cf. Kneis 2010b). 
One of the most direct references to Plato, of course, is the incorporation of 
Atlantis into the mythology of Stargate. Plato’s science fiction story about the con-
flict between Ancient Athens and Atlantis, however, is distorted firstly by establish-
ing the existence of Atlantis as a real place, and secondly, by making it a city of the 
Ancients that serves as a positive example, and not –– as in Plato’s story in the di-
alogs of Timaeus and Critias –– as a negative counter-example against Ancient 
Athens. 
On a more philosophical basis, the image of the lamp and the light that we 
encountered in Babylon 5 (page 63) is reminiscent of Plato’s Cave Metaphor. Images 
are seen on the wall of a room (or a cave). The difference lies in the source of the 
light: in both Babylon 5 sources, the light originates from the searcher; in the Cave 
Metaphor, it comes from somewhere else. Both cases though demonstrate the in-
completeness of human understanding in the universe, and allude to a perfect 
world of ideas and forms and understanding only reached once the shackles of the 
cave, of everyday existence, are overcome. The “real world” is a world of false cer-
tainties, of darkness, shadows, and light –– the search for understanding is a search 
for overcoming the limitations of humanity. In true understanding, human beings

could become god-like: This is exactly what happens to Sheridan, to humans in the 
future, and also in similar cases on Stargate: SG-1 and other franchises. 
8.3. Religion in the Mythological Genre 
Each of the shows discussed herein features the world in crisis –– not just some 
individuals or a family, but the world as such. It is being saved, time and again, by a 
select and idiosyncratic group of few individuals acting outside or on the margins 
of society, oftentimes clandestinely. The messianic character of that group and the 
individuals contained within is emphasized by a strong feeling of being special, uni-
quely qualified, chosen, or on the very front line of change or danger. The group 
ventures into areas and/or topics previously unknown or repressed and is con-
fronted with their inner demons. There is a clear sense of danger, and the enemy 
oftentimes conforms to ancient archetypes, or is marked by hybridity or impurity. 
The heroes most often are male, and there exists a strong heterosexual view of 
gender. The heroes fight the good fight most often by taking on the enemy directly, 
by being tortured and withstanding the seductions by the antagonist. Their fate is 
often revealed through dreams and prophecies, and there is a clear sense of direc-
tion and progression social structures are supposed to take or have, the present al-
ways being the best of all worlds socially –– up to now. Scientifically and epistemo-
logically, though, the past may very well contain a history of advanced civilizations 
in whose shadow modernity is still growing up, like a child looking up to their par-
ents and forefathers in veneration and awe (and sometimes, fear). Ancientness can 
be found on an archeological and engineering level (for which the Greco-Romans 
may be the guide) and within “spiritual” beliefs (for which the church fathers, the 
founders of the current system, or old animist thinking may serve as a guideline). 
The “spiritual” tendency is found in the overarching belief in something akin to an 
élan vital that animates life and differentiates it from non-life, and in the soul. The 
soul can be mentioned as such directly or be inferred from the narrative as an anal-
ogy to free will.  
The religion-inspired narrative, however, does not necessarily condone the 
current practice of religion. In fact, most of the genre works actively against all the 
various forms of religious expression, including the patriarchal paradigm –– at least 
on a rhetorical basis. Religion can thus be found more within directly religious 
thoughts or ideas than in allegiance to concrete “faiths.” If a person’s religion is 
mentioned at all, like Scully’s Catholicism on The X-Files, that person is most often 
struggling with dogma while adhering to some transcendentalized form of “faith.” 
«««»»» 
By collating the various points of convergence within the Mythological Genre, I 
hope to have created a picture of a system that contains a very specific group of 
ideas. Different shows by different creators from the realm of science fiction, fan-

114 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
tasy and horror appear to give rise to a specific kind of mythology that may diverge 
in details from show to show but reveals more commonalities than differences 
once examined closer. 
Regarding the examples under investigation in the previous chapters, we are 
confronted with a group of television shows that display certain commonalities: 
 
These are franchise shows. They have grown over some time and created fol-
low-up shows sharing characters and/or philosophy and narrative structure 
and style (general visual style, music, etc., cf. page 18). 
 
These franchises oftentimes appear to be functioning like kingdoms gravitat-
ing around a central author figure (Chris Carter for The X-Files and Millennium, 
Joe Straczynski for Babylon 5 and Crusade, Joss Whedon for Buffy and Angel, the 
late Gene Roddenberry and his current disciples still for Star Trek, J. J. Ab-
rams for Alias, Lost and Fringe). These authors are mythologized in the sense that 
they are seen as crucial to the mythology of the show, especially if it concerns 
a central conspiracy.82 This may be a reflection of the sometimes authoritarian 
outlook in the Mythological Genre (see page 107). 
 
The franchises deal with a highly fictionalized version of reality which con-
forms to genre conventions of science fiction, fantasy and horror –– usually, 
though, sci-fi shows like Star Trek, Babylon 5 and Stargate resist being labeled as 
fantasy, while Buffy and Angel would probably not be admitted into the sci-fi 
group. I am arguing that this is misleading, and that treating these shows as 
belonging to one genre is more productive. 
 
Additionally, the franchises seem to converge on a shared mythology, a shared 
pool of memes that, with occasional exceptions only, occur throughout the 
entirety of the Mythological Genre. 
                                                      
82  
Stargate’s Brad Wright and Robert Cooper do not appear that prominent. This may be due 
to Stargate’s genesis being derived from the 1994 film, as this limits the appearance of crea-
tive genius. Another executive producer, actor Richard Dean Anderson, looms larger over 
the franchise though. Most drastic is the case of Star Trek’s Gene Roddenberry, as shows 
like Andromeda were made after his death carrying his name (mainly due to his wife). –– The 
auteur as series “creator” and oftentimes long-time executive producer can be found in oth-
er genres too: amongst others, in politics and law: David E. Kelley (Picket Fences, Ally 
McBeal, The Practice, Boston Legal and other shows), Dick Wolf (several Law & Order series), 
Aaron Sorkin (Sports Night, The West Wing, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip), David Simon (Homi-
cide, The Wire); in comedy, Larry David (Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm) etc. I would argue, 
though, that the mythologizing of the “creator” happens less so in these shows.

9. THE REALISM ASSUMPTION: 
GENRE, MEMETICS AND THE EVOLVING TEXT 
A bookstore is one of the only pieces of physical evidence we have that people are still thinking. And I like the way 
it breaks down into fiction and nonfiction. In other words, these people are lying, and these people are telling the 
truth. That’s the way the world should be.
 
“Hi, I’m Jerry Seinfeld. I’m fiction.” “I know.” “How did you know?” “Because I’m nonfiction.”
 
 –– Jerry Seinfeld. SeinLanguage. 1. 
Outline: The data gathered from the various television franchises in Part Two is 
brought together with memetics and genre theory. 
9.1. Sufficient Sense 
Down the Rabbit Hole Towards the Klingon Forehead Dilemma 
While the examples cited in Part Two of this investigation concern the world of 
science fiction, fantasy and horror, there’s nothing in them that is different in prin-
ciple from the rest of narrative fictions, and they, too, are subject to expectations of 
“realism.”83 Yet to look for wholesome reality in art constitutes more often than 
not a futile attempt.84 While it is possible and utterly fruitful to search for snippets 
of truth and reality in such artifacts, this is merely due to the setting of stories in the 
real world. Even science fiction is grounded in real life, and the people it portrays 
carry attributes real people would carry. On the whole, however, the basis is not 
reality but fantasy, a fantasy that is not entirely arbitrary but rooted in psychological 
and anthropological foundations of the human mind. 
In a rather contradictory fashion, however, realism is a category still applied to 
fiction, especially to science fiction and fantasy. Consulting any fan site on the inter-
net, asking any member of a science fiction convention, we would find that the co-
                                                      
83  
“Realism” is used herein not to refer to the literary period resp. genre of the same name, 
but to denote a style within fiction that claims to be “realistic” in the everyday sense of the 
word by referring to real situations, common sense, everyday experience, or even real 
events. 
84  
In the detective genre, Mr. Monk always catches the bad guy. Like other detectives, he has 
an unbeatable instinct concerning the mind of the killer. Det. Goren from Law & Order: 
Criminal Intent appears to share this predicament; both are derived from Sherlock Holmes 
–– which is also favorably cited within Star Trek: The Next Generation, wherein Holmes is 
portrayed by Data twice. The super-human detective is a genre convention. Rare moments 
of realism mostly occur when the criminal goes free at the end and evades punishment, yet 
these are exceptions. Even the quasi-documentary style of shows like Homicide: Life on the 
Street, The Wire and the greater Law & Order franchise only contain brief vignettes of real-
ism within a highly artificial frame, no matter how much they claim to be “realistic.” 

116 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
herence of the mythology is one of the prime concerns. With series like Star Trek, 
there exists the highly engaging “problem” of why Klingons look different in the 
old show from the Sixties as set against the movies and subsequent series, which is 
mirrored in another dilemma: each season of Star Trek: The Next Generation can be 
rather reliably dated by Worf’s Klingon makeup. Yet to seek the answer within ex-
ternal factors, like makeup and better finances of later enterprises, would remove 
the attention of the audience from the level of the text to the level of mundane re-
ality. The way to overcome that shift of attention, and to fix the continuity prob-
lem, is to fix it within the text. This is more important now for long-running televi-
sion franchises, and constitutes a real difference in degree, and oftentimes also in 
quality, in comparison with motion pictures or shorter, solitary television shows: 
Maintaining continuity over several years or (in the case of Star Trek) decades, espe-
cially in a genre where the look of the show (cinematography, makeup, effects etc., 
see page 18) can be highly subject to technological advances, is a difficult problem 
which is additionally complicated by a dedicated fan base that treats the televised 
corpus as something akin to a holy text.85 Thus in order to make the franchise more 
self-contained, discrepancies within the evolving text will have to be addressed. For 
this, the same rules that apply in the real world need to apply in fiction as well: 
cause and effect, continuity, explanations that make sufficient sense. 
Sufficient sense means: either it does indeed make sense, or there is a strong 
semblance of sense, a working knowledge of how things function in the world. Eve-
ryone knows that things falls down on Earth. That doesn’t mean everyone knows 
that the cause of that is gravity, and it doesn’t mean that amongst those who do 
know, they would know how gravity works. Physics still doesn’t know how gravity 
works exactly. But the problem is approachable in principle, and we know enough 
to know what gravity does, how to calculate it, and, most important of all, what it is 
not. Whether gravity is seen as a curvature in space-time (even if we might not be 
able to actually imagine what this means) or as transmitted by gravitons, doesn’t real-
ly matter. Working models exist to calculate gravity on Earth and between planetary 
and stellar bodies, and the accuracy is sufficient. 
                                                      
85  
Star Trek, as a collaborative endeavor, and despite the iconic creator-figure of Gene Rod-
denberry, is of course light years away from the science fiction tales of L. Ron Hubbard 
and his cult of Dianetics that has been made into something like a science fiction religion. 
Yet still, the degree of fan dedication, the adherence to the canon and even the existence of 
“heretical texts” that are fan-produced (the so-called fanon), may be said to create a phe-
nomenon that has church-like (yet due to its openness not cult-like) properties (cf. also 
Lawrence and Jewett 2002: 247-264). Just as critical theology has pushed and worked to al-
ter the official dogma of any church, the dedicated fan-base of a large franchise may be 
able to push the canon of that show into a certain direction. Competitions between fan-
doms like Star Trek, Babylon 5 and Star Wars sometimes resemble (non-bloody) religious 
wars. Quite fittingly, the writer’s guide for most television shows with several writers is re-
ferred to as the show’s “bible.” 

 
Chapter 9: The Realism Assumption 
117 
Within a work of fiction, and Star Trek is just one of a Vast number of exam-
ples, there needs to be found an internal solution to an external problem as mun-
dane as makeup. The comedic treatment of the “problem” of the “Klingon Fore-
head Dilemma” in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode 5.06 “Trials And Tribble-
ations,” a time travel episode in which Worf is confronted with Klingons from the 
old series sans make-up, and refuses to talk about the reasons why they look differ-
ent, both pokes fun at the fandom discussion while also alluding to the possibility 
of a cultural trauma within Klingon society. The latter solution is picked up in the 
Star Trek: Enterprise episodes 4.04-4.06 “Borderland”/“Cold Station 12”/“The 
Augments,” in which the answer is given: a genetic engineering mistake intended to 
create “augmented” Klingons, linking this to the canonic Star Trek history of the 
Eugenic Wars. Having Data’s Brent Spiner play the eugenicist Dr. Arik Soong 
creates future coherence with Dr. Noonian Soong, the creator of Data himself. 
Almost in passing, while solving the “Klingon Forehead Dilemma,” the myth thus 
combines two threads central to many science fiction and fantasy shows: augmenta-
tion of humans, and transcendence of the human “soul” into a technological body. 
The canonic text has bowed to the selection pressure of fandom discussions and 
changed accordingly. 
Or couldn’t we just say, the producers reacted to fan demands and delivered 
the desired content? Yes, of course. Behind such changes there’s surely always 
someone, a team of writers and executives who actually do something. Yet this is 
not denied by a memetic or text-immanent perspective. 
Science and Fiction 
Science fiction like Star Trek is not only good fun but it also serves a serious purpose, that 
of expanding the human imagination. We may not yet be able to go where no man (or 
woman) has gone before, but at least we can do it in the mind. We can explore how the 
human spirit might respond to future developments in science and we can speculate on 
what those developments might be. There is a two-way trade between science fiction and 
science. Science fiction suggests ideas that scientists incorporate into their theories, but 
sometimes science turns up notions that are stranger than any science fiction. […] The 
physics that underlies Star Trek is surely worth investigating. To confine our attention to 
terrestrial matters would be to limit the human spirit. (Hawking 1995: xi-xiii) 
 –– –– ––  
More than one reputable scientist has been introduced to what I am calling the spirit of 
wonder through an early fascination with science fiction. (Dawkins 1998: 27) 
Publications such as Krauss (1995), to which Steven Hawking granted his fore-
word, and also Simon (1999) point to some sort of convergence of science and fic-
tion on a common goal: the exploration of the human spirit, and an interdiscipli-
nary conjunction towards that end. Much would speak in favor of that view, and 
usually, indeed, science fiction is believed to be different from fantasy –– as it may 

118 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
contain more elements of reality.86 Yet as can be seen from Chapter 8, there are 
striking commonalities that question the alleged realism of science fiction. Science 
fiction, if examined more critically, is a romantic scientism with occasional nods to 
a (fictionalized) science, but only in a poetic sense. Looking for real science may 
appear especially frustrating if confronted with a show like The X-Files: 
The problem with The X-Files is that routinely, relentlessly, the supernatural explanation, or 
at least the Mulder end of the spectrum, usually turns out to be the answer. […] But isn’t it 
just harmless fiction, then? No, I think the defence rings hollow. Imagine a television series 
in which two police officers solve a crime each week. Every week there is one black suspect 
and one white suspect. One of the two detectives is always biased towards the black sus-
pect, the other towards the white. And, week after week, the black suspect turns out to 
have done it. So, what’s wrong with that? After all, it’s only fiction! Shocking as it is, I be-
lieve the analogy to be a completely fair one. I am not saying that supernaturalist propa-
ganda is as dangerous or unpleasant as racist propaganda. But The X-Files systematically 
purveys an anti-rational view of the world which, by virtue of its recurrent persistence, is 
insidious. (Dawkins 1998: 28) 
Dawkins proceeds to castigate “Tolkienian faked-up myth” in which “[p]hysicists 
rub shoulders with wizards” (28), but maintains that there is also “good” science 
fiction in which the laws of nature may be violated, “preferably one law at a time” 
(29), but still the “decencies of science” (29) would be kept. From the scientific 
view represented by Dawkins and Hawking as leading science popularizers (and 
practicing scientists), the representation of science within fiction would, of course, 
be interesting and a cause for concern. 
Yet how realistic is such an expectation? Science is interested in testable 
knowledge, in collecting facts and establishing tentative theories about such facts, 
which then may produce technology and enhance our knowledge about the real 
world. Fiction is something else. Even if inspired by science, or talking about 
science, fiction remains fiction. Fiction distorts reality, propagates scientism, values 
the “paranormal,” has a preference for mad scientists, and –– as an extended phe-
notype of society –– displays the same symptoms also plaguing society, namely, for 
instance, racism, homophobia, sexism, and the purporting of the myth of the mid-
dle class society. 
Yet when we enter the world of fiction, we indeed do follow the White Rabbit 
down his hole and enter a different world, in which a set of memes have converged 
to form a memeplex that has successfully survived for generations. It is a world of 
magical and religious thinking in which it does not really matter how one can travel 
faster than the speed of light. Warp Speed, Hyperdrive, Jumpgates, unspecified 
                                                      
86  
For instance, science fiction oftentimes features real political and military institutions (like 
on Stargate, The X-Files etc.) or fictitious versions of such structures that are still sufficiently 
similar to their contemporary originals (Star Trek). Also, fairy tale creatures occur less in 
science fiction as compared to fantasy, and if they do, they are sufficiently scientized to be 
depicted as aliens, mutations, or other more plausible phenomena. 

 
Chapter 9: The Realism Assumption 
119 
FTL-drives or Stargates serve a narrative purpose. They may make sufficient sense 
in a way that they take up the lingo of science; but their science is almost always on 
the level of magic. Wormholes are at the fringes of science, not just even barely 
understood but hardly proven, and will probably not lead to Stargate technology. 
Physicists now are able to “beam” matter, meaning, they are able to transfer quan-
tum states from one elementary particle to another via a short distance. No one will 
be doing any kind of beaming of persons for quite a while. It may very well be ar-
rogant of human beings to assume to be alone in the universe. Life may be ubiquit-
ous. Yet still, where are the aliens? Some “cultures” should be more “evolved” than 
ours. Surely they would have discovered faster-than-light travel or at least genera-
tional spaceships? Where are they87? Abducting farmers for sex games, biting cows, 
hovering in our skies like weather balloons? Time travel sounds nice. Where are the 
tourists from the future? Other “phenomena” are just a scientistic version of my-
thology. For instance, there is a word for people being “out of phase” and thus in-
visible, able to go through walls (but not falling through ceilings): ghosts. It can be 
rather safely stated that notwithstanding its inspirational quality, inventiveness and 
philosophical character, science fiction deals with science just as Moby-Dick deals 
with marine biology. 
Science Fiction as Religion? 
The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by 
the people as equally true; by the philosopher as equally false; and by the magistrate as 
equally useful. (Gibbon 35) 
Religion is a system for social control. In that regard, it is about right and wrong. 
The question of a divine and universal origin pertains to the legitimacy of a god-
head. The more primal it is, the more foundational its role, the more profound its 
judgement. If such a creator-god does not exist, the ancestors may play that role. 
The question of transcendence and the afterlife pertains to the duration of social 
rule and the continuation of rewards and punishments. The system is enabled and 
fueled by anthropomorphism. 
The sociological and political basis of religion is prevalent in historiography 
and also in the writings of authors such as Émile Durkheim, who stressed the con-
nection between religion and church, between religious thought and practice, in-
deed, he sees the idea of religion and the idea of the church as inseparable (Durk-
heim 65). 
Whereas the sociological school thus sees religion and church as inseparable, 
the memetic perspective, while not denying the social components of religion, 
points to elements of religious thinking that may exist independent of a social con-

This is known as the Fermi Paradox, named after Enrico Fermi who first posed that ques-
tion in 1950 over lunch (space.com.searchforlife/shostak_paradox_011024.html, retrieved 
12/29/2009). 

120 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
struction depending on that. Notwithstanding the analogies between Star Trek and 
religion that have been established earlier, and the frequent references to religious 
institutions within the texts cited in the case studies, these are not liturgical texts. 
Neither could you assume that those watching these shows would be avid “chur-
chgoers.” Only very few of them would attend fan conventions or academic confe-
rences. Neither is there one central organization that takes care of worship. Fans or 
simply watchers of these shows can easily “flock” to another show, franchises may 
overlap or somehow even touch. This often results in a post-modern style of exces-
sively quoting “popular culture” within the shows (as most heavily on Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer and Farscape). 
Sometimes, even producers may turn out to swap franchises. J. J. Abrams, 
creator of Felicity, Alias, Lost and Fringe, has directed Star Trek XI. Ronald D. 
Moore, formerly of Star Trek TNG, DS9 and VGR fame, is one of the producers of 
the new Battlestar Galactica. Is thus the sum of all those franchises an institution that 
should be treated as a coherent enterprise? Even though production conditions do 
matter (cf. Taylor 2005), the church analogy would still appear stretched. And even 
if sociological components can be added to the religious thinking within the My-
thological Genre, to call the result a religion (Lawrence and Jewett 2002: 247-265), 
and to look for a church, would mean to stretch the common sense understanding 
of church unreasonably. Could this still be called a religion? Could a religion or a 
social-political construction be derived from science fiction and fantasy? Scientolo-
gy proves it can (under certain circumstances), and as fantasy is mythological, and 
myth has always been tied to religion, this does not appear impossible either.88 
Religious thinking may be sheltered best within a corresponding social or-
ganization. The church is seen by the faithful as an organization within which they 
may express their faith. Religion, as recognized by Durkheim, is an eminently col-
lective phenomenon (see above), which also denotes the difference between the 
pious and the loon: In numbers lie strength and respectability: “When one person 
suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delu-
sion it is called Religion” (Robert M. Pirsig, as quoted in Dawkins 2006: 5). It could 
be argued that the greater the numbers of believers, the more diverse and the more 
respectable religion may, indeed, become. The “great” religions have also produced 
works of skepticism and criticism, and –– despite a currently resurging religious 
fundamentalism –– many believers may be more skeptical than they would let out-
                                                      
88  
The connections to anti-democratic, monarchic if not outright fascist forms of thinking 
and governance in some works of fantasy like Star Wars are illustrated in Lawrence and Je-
wett 2002: 265-282, especially when showing how the concluding scenes of Star Wars: A 
New Hope deliberately cite scenes from Leni Riefenstahl’s 1934 “masterpiece” Triumph des 
Willens. “Militant Irrationality” (275) is preferred over democratic learning, by accepting to 
listen to the “Force,” the “human mind in A New Hope simply becomes fate’s vessel for 
pouring nuclear destruction on the enemy” (276). Similar story elements can be found in 
The Matrix (283-305) and The Lord of the Rings.

siders believe. Small cults are more restrictive than large ones –– large ones survive 
not because they stay constant but because they continually adapt. 
9.2. The Genre as Memeplex 
Independence of Thought 
Asking cui bono now, it seems that religious memes as the ones discussed in the case 
studies and Chapter 8 benefit from specific forms of organization and narration. 
One the one hand, certain forms of thinking which may be called religious could be 
said to simply be part of “human nature.” The ubiquity of such memes as the belief 
in life after death and in the existence of ghosts or higher beings, and the depiction 
of archetypal fears point to that. However, human thinking can be more complex 
than that. 
One would assume that, within the limits of the known world, human beings 
could basically think of anything out of the Vast possibilities available. And indeed, 
the wealth of cultural artifacts and utterances might be seen as speaking to that. It 
also speaks, however, to the existence of some kind of harmonization and channe-
ling. Any thought may be possible, but that does not say anything about its long-term 
survival. Memes in the single mind may be able to stay “alive” longer; once out in 
the “wild,” the same memes can be rather short-lived. Some “independent minds” 
like Immanuel Velikovsky, Heribert Illig, and Anatoly Fomenko have established 
entire schools of renegade historical thinking, yet only so by firstly having created 
massive printed volumes in order to somehow defend their idiosyncratic views of 
the world. Their struggle against “established opinion” needs big guns in order to 
even be heard. Yet what these write against has been (mostly) proven by facts, and 
if someone like Illig continues to maintain that roughly 300 years of medieval histo-
ry have been faked, extraordinary verbal skills may be necessary once proof runs 
out. Despite what could be thought of their actual intellectual achievements, and 
despite their being probably misguided, these and countless others prove that 
thinking can perhaps basically do anything. Yet can it? Classical elements of conspir-
acy theory can be found in their works, and their self-presentation as renegades also 
follows rather tiresome schemes of outlaw-ism. 
Wherever one looks, assumedly independent thought is regularly going 
where at least some thoughts or just notions have gone before. If evolutionary 
theory in the biological realm can provide any indication for the cultural realm as 
well, the search for a very first cause would be tricky; and as probably nobody will 
actually ever be able to prove what the very first thought ever has been, this line of 
inquiry must be considered futile.  
What remains is the analysis of culture within known history, which is a his-
tory of adaptations, refinements, repetitions –– descent with modifications, a.k.a. 
evolution. Within the literary and cultural context, specific kinds of narratives and 

122 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
forms are bundled together in what is called genres –– and these can be seen as 
memeplexes. 
The Evolving Genre 
The classification “genre” is oftentimes rather polyvalent. It can denote differences 
in form (drama, poetry, prose, essay, etc.) and content. The latter can further be 
subdivided into the traditional categories of comedy and tragedy, or into a variety 
of thematic categories (science fiction, horror, romance, coming of age story, etc.). 
Degrees of veracity or verisimilitude can be distinguishing properties as well (fic-
tion, non-fiction). This terminological muddle is usually seen as the result of a mix-
ture of classification by the author, the critic, and through audience expectation. 
Thus genres are usually defined from the outside of the text, especially when un-
derstood as “processes of systematisation” (Neal 1980: 51), wherein a specific gen-
re is both “a coherent and systematic body of […] texts, and a coherent and syste-
matic set of expectations” (54f).89 
The memetic perspective now turns this approach around. Texts or artistic 
utterances in general (whether they consist merely of words on a page, of pictures, 
music, objects, or are fully audio-visual or enacted on a stage) never happen in a 
vacuum, they always relate to other texts. Texts tell a story, not necessarily a com-
plex story, maybe they even just narrate a very brief moment, but there is some-
thing told. That which is told can be understood as consisting of simpler compo-
nents, which together generate a whole. Not every component “goes” with any 
other. This does not mean that not everything is combinable, but that there are cer-
tain combinations that are more common than others. Heightened artistic effect is 
often achieved by combining things that are not commonly seen as belonging to-
gether. However, what holds true for a solitary text like a single novel or short sto-
ry, or a single film, will be challenged once that text is serialized or put into family 
relations with other texts. The Mythological Genre, for instance, by its very design 
has to break with the conventions of everyday reality. Longer-running franchises, 
though, tend to “normalize” over the long run, which could be attributed to an in-
troduction of soap opera elements. The “watering down” of the original concept, 
though, could also be understood as something akin to what could be termed cul-
tural entropy: Without active work against it, an ongoing text will conform to genre 
conventions, memetic drive becomes stronger. 
Even if the text is perceived as highly “original” in the beginning, over a long 
period of time it will tend to broaden its scope and lose some of its unique 
attributes. For example, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, like most other shows in its 
franchise, started out as a highly idiosyncratic science fiction show, but towards 
seasons six and seven with the narration of the Dominion War it centered more 
                                                      
89  
This, of course, is a coarse simplification of various theories –– for a more thorough over-
view, cf. Casey et al 2002: 108-111, as well as Neal 1980 and Duff 1999.  

 
Chapter 9: The Realism Assumption 
123 
and more on a traditional military narrative and the family matters of the main cast. 
Speculative science fiction occurred less and less. The same could be said of Babylon 
5, and to a lesser degree of Voyager and The Next Generation. The initial sense of ad-
venture that was present on Stargate: SG-1 started to fade once the fight against the 
Goa’uld became more of a routine military exercise than a matter of survival. Only 
by “rebooting” the franchise with the launching of Stargate: Atlantis and the intro-
duction of the Ori in season 9 of SG-1 were new speculative elements introduced. 
The broader the range, the more complex the “universes” of these shows became, 
the more predictable the general narrative tended to become. The points of com-
parison gathered in Chapters 2-8 accumulated over the long run of these series. 
Had this investigation been only concerned with a couple of episodes from the be-
ginning of each series, the differences in thematic range would have been much 
greater. 
Memeplexes and Memetic Drive 
It is difficult to pinpoint a meme. Actually, it is difficult to pinpoint a gene too, and 
oftentimes, genes are defined functionally. Richard Dawkins’ definition is derived 
from G. C. Williams (1966): “A gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal ma-
terial that potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selec-
tion” (Dawkins 1989: 28). Applying this to culture, a meme could be an idea or a 
group of ideas able to have maintained integrity for some time throughout evolu-
tion. Memes combine into memeplexes (cf. Ch. 2, page 30), and memeplexes them-
selves could be seen as memes again, if they, as a whole, are stable enough to inte-
ract and compete with other memeplexes.  
Within ecosystems, vehicles are competing with each other for resources. 
“Arms races” (Dawkins 1989: 250) between these competitors ensue. Together 
with environmental factors, this creates a drive towards continued adaptation to the 
circumstances. What is being changed are the phenotypes. New phenotypes are 
created through newly arising genotypes which are modified versions of older ge-
notypes. Mutation and drift (the long-term accumulation of differences through 
spatial or temporal separation of two or more populations) can create new kinds of 
vehicles constituting new species. Natural selection (successful variants survive and 
propagate in a competitive climate, unsuccessful ones die without successful prog-
eny) creates a non-random process that leads to very specific adaptations visible in 
the vehicles, stored within and inherited through the replicators. 
It is the success of the vehicle that determines the success of the replicator. 
“Better” genes are worthless if not put to use. Furthermore, it is hardly possible to 
actually observe genes –– and rather irrelevant for observing evolution itself. Relating 
this to memetic theory, it does not really matter for our discussion what exactly the 
physical basis for memes looks like. Evolution of phenotypes is clearly taking place 
in physical artifacts (cf. Ch. 2, page 34).  

124 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
Regarding literary and cultural theory now, it would be possible to trace the 
evolution of individual ideas. Studies like this are common and can prove immense-
ly fruitful. If monitoring the “soul”-meme now, we can observe it occurring with 
other memes like “free will,” “fate,” “salvation,” “death,” “life after death,” “im-
mortality,” “reincarnation” etc. Rarely if ever, these memes will occur on their own 
–– one will almost invariably be found in conjunction with another. Often times, 
these concepts will evolve in connection with each other; not all of them at once, 
some elements may stay constant, but still: they are co-adapting, they are forming a 
memeplex (cf. Ch. 2, page 30). Memeplexes can be created by what Susan Black-
more (1999: 108) has termed memetic drive. 
Selection Pressure 
The expectation that reality be depicted truthfully is something that cannot really be 
fulfilled. Fiction makes “sense” primarily within the confines of its own realm. To a 
certain degree, this is even what the audience probably expects: were fiction to ade-
quately mimic reality, it would disappear.90 This does not mean that fiction should 
happen without referring to reality. Yet the assumption that reality could even be 
realistically depicted within a larger context of fictional91 storytelling is flawed. 
Fiction is influenced primarily by the producer of the text (which in television 
includes series creators, producers, a writing staff, outside writers, actors, directors 
of photography, composers, special and visual effects creators, and many others), 
by the historical, political and social contexts, by those who finance the enterprise, 
by audience size and feedback, viewer ratings, and by a comparison with other 
works in the past, present, and foreseeable future. The fictional text has to adapt to 
all these factors, and “survive” within this context. The survival strategy consists of 
attracting memes that will prosper in each other’s company and increase their mu-
tual fitness. The genre functions as the shell into which the memes enter; not every 
genre text will encompass all key ingredients, and probably only a minority of them 
at the very beginning. The ingredients do not stay constant over time but evolve. 
This componential view of fiction, and the evolutionary component, has been 
underlined also by authors like Brunetière (Duff 1999: 4), Propp (1928), and in the 
context of the analysis of mythology, in the theory of the Monomyth (Campbell 
1949, Lawrence and Shelton 2002: 5-6). Especially Campbell’s analysis of myths in 
his seminal study The Hero With A Thousand Faces breaks down narrative compo-
                                                      
90  
Umberto Eco parodies the mapping of reality unto fiction in his essay “Dell’ impossibilità 
di costruire la carta dell’ impero 1 a 1” (“On the Impossibility of Drawing a Map of the 
Empire on a Scale of 1 to 1”) by demonstrating that the closer the depiction comes to re-
semble real life, the more it not only is impossible, but the more it also impedes life. In this 
discussion of an example by Jorge Luis Borges, he ends up with showing how once such a 
map were done, it would put the empire to an end. 
91  
A similar discussion could be conducted with regards to non-fictional storytelling; this, 
however, would be another investigation. 

 
Chapter 9: The Realism Assumption 
125 
nents of heroic tales that show an underlying similarity in virtually the entirety of 
the world’s mythologies, which Campbell explains with the means of psycho-
analytical theory. Not all, but most ingredients hold true for each of the shows ana-
lyzed in Chapters 3-8; even if they only manifest in later seasons.92 An initial resis-
tance of the genre to actually conform to its alleged conventions is usually over-
come once a series runs for more than at least three seasons –– the memetic drive 
to form a more coherent memeplex appears to increase with time and complexity. 
Indeed, complexity seems to mean just that: Conforming to established patterns of 
the Mythological Genre.  
The Evolving Text: Genre as Mold, Genre as Riverbed 
Content-based genres are often seen as being definable by certain elements. If there 
is time travel involved, it must be science fiction, for instance. This componential 
approach is already akin to the memetic approach: Several memes come together to 
form a larger unit, a memeplex. The kinds of memes that combine are not arbitrary, 
though. This specific combination of idiosyncratic memes (and the potential for 
such a combination to arise) creates a specific genre. 
A genre could be understood as a mold into which a certain text is poured. 
The text assumes the form of the mold and thus can be said to belong to a certain 
genre. Alternatively, it could be proposed that genres are rather like riverbeds93 in a 
hilly landscape. Texts may start out from anywhere, but sooner or later they will 
flow into pre-existing riverbeds that already possess a predetermined direction. 
Through obstacles in the way, rivers might even split. Through canals, rivers can be 
connected artificially. 
Whatever metaphor one decides to choose (if any), sense needs to be made of 
the following facts: 
 
Genres guide the development of a text. Most texts that are being created will 
conform to specific genre conventions already from the very inception. 
 
The longer a text is being worked on (and the more collaborative this endea-
vor is), the more its genre is able to change, the more a text may converge on 
specific conventions, even if they run counter to the original conception of 
the author(s). 
                                                      
92  
Star Trek, in contrast to all other shows analyzed herein, appears most resistant to this in 
the beginning. Yet in later season of Star Trek: The Next Generation, the story of Worf, espe-
cially his redeeming his dead father and becoming an (outcast) hero to his people, takes up 
crucial elements of the Monomyth. Data plays that role too in relation to his “father,” Dr. 
Soong. Odo plays that role on Deep Space Nine, the Doctor (and partially Seven of Nine) on 
Voyager. Captain Archer on Enterprise is living in the shadow of his father, who invented the 
very Warp 5 reactor used in his son’s ship.

Dawkins uses the river metaphor for genetic evolution in River Out of Eden (1995). 

126 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
 
This change is usually not arbitrary but will probably harmonize with the ma-
jority of other texts in the genre. 
 
The text will gain a greater coherence and sufficient sense with time. 
From what we have seen, a variety of competing texts in the genres of science fic-
tion, fantasy and horror, each setting out from their own respective starting points, 
evolve over time and take up a sufficient amount of common characteristics to be 
classified as belonging to one overarching entity: the Mythological Genre.  
If texts are seen as formed by several memes that compete with each other 
and congregate around certain attractors, this ongoing evolution not just of genres 
but also within developing texts may be understood more clearly. Genre formation, 
or the belonging of a text to a specific genre, is an evolutionary process that is two-
fold: Firstly, genres evolve over time. Yet genres do not necessarily allow for a sim-
ple taxonomy, texts may be categorized to belong to several genres –– also, texts 
might change their genre after a while. This is observable in long-running franchis-
es whose intermediate stages are clearly visible, like the franchises analyzed in the 
case studies. Thus, secondly, a process of evolution takes place also within a given 
text, leading to a continued re-negotiation and re-invention of genre conventions 
over a certain amount of time. 
A genre can thus be seen as a set of memes that, within a given text which 
constitutes a suitable environment and exerts a specific selection pressure, converge 
upon a memeplex that is distinct enough to be different from other comparable 
entities. The genre memeplex for the Mythological Genre, for instance, contains 
combinations of memes usually not found in the Western Genre or the Soap Opera 
and vice versa. 
Which memes are selected for is influenced by what could be called the cul-
tural imaginary. Themes in classical mythology have been found to be akin to what 
can be found within dreams, and the logic of mythological tales has been found 
similar to the logic in dreams (Freud 1900, 1912; Campbell 1949; Jung 1961; Leem-
ing 1998; Wilson 1998). That which a specific memeplex converges upon could be 
said to reveal a certain susceptibility of humans to themes that have belonged to 
human cultures since time immemorial. Which memes are selected for may thus be 
influenced by how strongly they conform to archetypes, traditions, cultural and in-
dividual expectations, and other factors. 
Yet this does not mean that creativity would be curtailed, or that somehow 
the end result as such would be predictable. Variations within a given paradigm can 
be as diverse as such that do not share that many commonalities. Only on an ab-
stract level, for instance, do Mulder, Sheridan, Buffy, Daniel Jackson and Spock get 
resurrected. In practice, the various instances of the resurrection meme testify to 
the imaginative powers unleashed by these texts, and the differences of how this 
resurrection takes place might even be said to be more interesting once the struc-
tural similarities in the narratives are recognized. Furthermore, variation may even 

 
Chapter 9: The Realism Assumption 
127 
be encouraged by the text: These are canonical texts within the Mythological Gen-
re, these are not marginal phenomena. Audiences overlap, and some of these texts 
cite each other. This process of competition needs a set of structural and genre 
commonalities for a comparison to be possible, and then encourages diversity on 
the level of the individual story, the individual text. 
Reality and Fantasy: Of Memes and Groundhogs 
This process of competition leads to something like sub-genres or stereotypical 
formats that occur throughout the genre, one example being what could be called 
the Groundhog Day format. The film Groundhog Day (1993) told the story of one day 
repeating over and over till the cycle would stop finally.94 Star Trek TNG does this 
in 5.18 “Cause and Effect” (before Groundhog Day), The X-Files in 6.14 “Monday,” 
Buffy in 6.05 “Life Serial,” and Stargate: SG-1 in 4.06 “Window of Opportunity,” 
which also cites the film directly: 
MALIKAI: I need more time [to work on a time travel device, which also, unintentionally, 
creates time loops]. […] 
O’NEILL: Why? So you can be king of Groundhog Day? (SG-1 4.06 “Window of Oppor-
tunity,” 35:31-35:39) 
This is as clear a case of imitation as possible, and it could be read as a deliberate 
approach to investigate the Groundhog meme within different habitats, so to say. 
The Groundhog meme is surely not taken from everyday experience (though 
maybe from a desire to be able to change things), no matter how many déjà vus are 
encountered throughout a lifetime. Its occurrence, like that of many other elements 
within fiction, is not based on experiences that are actually possible in the contem-
porary reality of the audience. It conforms, however, to the conventions of the gen-
re, thus bowing to a certain selection pressure from inside the text. The memes that 
actually influence the genre may have been around since time immemorial (if we 
consider religious memes like those found in the Monomyth) or even recently 
(though the Groundhog meme, for instance, could besides recent features also con-
tain older elements). 
The assumption of realism, of the correct depiction of real events, expe-
riences, procedures, and technical details, is based on two main suppositions: That 
there exists an interest on the part of the author(s) of the text to be depicting some-
thing as realistically as possible, and that there exists an interest on the part of the 
audience to consume such a text, to actually look for an accurate depiction of reali-
ty. Both the author and the audience are more complex than that, as has already 
been shown (cf. pages 38 and 124). From a memetic perspective, it is even more 
apparent that, from the view of the text, no such interest exists. The Mythological 
Genre violates everyday experiences on a regular basis. This is the definition of this 
                                                      
94  
Which may be similar to P. D. Ouspensky’s novel The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin. 

128

genre, of course, and does not explain much. Once a more componential and me-
metic perspective is assumed, however, the constructed nature of the genre be-
comes clearer: What lies beneath the genre are archetypal memes that can also be 
found in dreams, and have been occurring throughout the history of religious and 
magical thinking: allegories, metaphors, free associations, symbolic language, and 
what could be called unconscious animism. 
What distinguishes the Mythological Genre from others is the frequency of the oc-
currence of respective memes. The focus on fantasy over reality is more widespreadin 
this genre, even though in principle, this holds true for all of fiction, and even non-
fiction utilizes more elements of fictitious narration than usually assumed.

THE TOOLBOX OF THEORY 
Get a life, will you, people? I mean, for crying out loud, it’s just a TV show! I mean, look at you, look at the way

it’s just a TV show!
 
 –– William Shatner. “Star Trek Convention.” Saturday Night Live. December 20, 1986. 
Outline: The main themes of this book are summarized.  
10.1. The Mind’s Eye: Ways of Seeing and Interpreting 
Theory within cultural and literary studies can open up ways of seeing that may lead 
to a deeper understanding of the phenomena studied. Theory works well if it 
creates a model of reality, and when it tries to explain specific aspects of that in a 
given context. Any new theory should be situated within the context of and offer 
adjustments and additions to existing theory. As knowledge can only be tentative 
and partial, no theory can be expected to sufficiently and conclusively explain the 
whole or even just some aspects of either nature or culture.95 Culture constantly 
changes and adapts to new circumstances. Furthermore, explanatory models are 
always based on the current state of our knowledge of the world. As this know-
ledge progresses, the complexity of both natural and cultural systems becomes 
more and more apparent, as well as their interdependence. 
Theory works well as a toolbox: depending on which phenomenon to study, 
there is a variety of oftentimes complimentary approaches available. A text could 
be approached, for instance, from a gender studies or postcolonial point of view, in 
terms of aesthetics, or in several other ways. For this book, memetics has been 
chosen as an approach towards the understanding of genre, because it can be seen 
as complimentary to and supporting of componential views of genre, the theory of 
the Monomyth, and also a post-structuralist critique of authorship. Furthermore, 
several studies from a memetic perspective have appeared recently that investigate 
aspects of religious thinking, which also occur in the body of materials studied 
herein. This specific theoretical model has been used in the hope of combining 
several other threads of theory and creating a productive synthesis. 
                                                      
95  
Lehman (1991: 121-124) underlines how misleading theory can become once it is seen as 
exhaustive and total, for which he chooses the example of what he calls “hardcore” decon-
structive thinking, which, while claiming to work against hegemonic discourses, effectively 
undermines the legitimacy of all other forms of discourse. 

130 
Part Three: A Mind of Its Own 
 
Memetic theory offers a view of culture that may appear drastically different 
from more traditional approaches. The focus of analysis has shifted, apparently, to 
a radically reductionist perspective by defining a “meme” as that which is imitated. 
Memes, according to that theory, can be ideas, or complexes of ideas, and are 
usually found in artifacts, works of art, or speech. Similarly to what can be said of 
genes, they “behave” (i.e. it looks as if they behave; we need not posit conscience) 
so as to maximize their own reproduction and survival. They undergo selection 
pressure, drift and mutation. 
Of course, any work of art is made by human beings, in human societies, with 
constraints in terms of financing, production, distribution, audience, etc. Yet the 
many variables involved in the creation of such a work can create such a complex 
web of interdependencies that it may be able to see the creation in a more abstract 
way. This seems to hold true especially for film and television productions, yet even 
the writing of a single book or article can be almost as complex, as laid out earlier 
(page 38). 
Nevertheless, the scope of this book has been limited to analyzing television 
franchises. While television is just one possible format for which memetics could 
be applied, it does appears to be a more fruitful medium for such theoretical ap-
proaches than others. When analyzing single works of literature or film, what is 
being investigated is most often already a finished work, and most of the time there 
is no real way to see how a text actually develops over time. Longer-running televi-
sion series or entire franchises consisting of two or more series, however, offer an 
opportunity to see a text evolve over time, with several factors contributing to a 
selection pressure that may even change the character of the franchise. 
10.2. The Emancipation of the Soul 
Reality Lost… 
Memetics, in an even more radical reading, could further be seen as allowing for a 
perspective that illustrates that memes can function independent from outside con-
straints. In that kind of reading, which seems to correspond with extreme post-
structuralist readings as well, culture almost happens without any serious input by 
human beings. In fact, this corresponds with many fictions of artificial intelligence, 
in which ideas are imagined as independent from the biological body that invented 
them. To go beyond the physical, the emancipation of the soul from the here and 
now is, of course, an old religious idea. In a certain sense, even the “meme” meme 
could be understood as speaking to that desire. And as science fiction as one in-
stance of the utopian is about desire (cf. Jameson), the desire that our cultural ideas 
(probably not in a Platonic, but in a memetic sense) can survive even beyond our 
own bodily demise, is an idea that has proved as ubiquitous in this analysis as it is 
powerful. 

 
Chapter 10: Conclusion 
131 
The Mythological Genre tells tales of the emancipation from dire circum-
stances, from subjugation and outside control. These tales are set into a highly my-
thological context that propagates the purity of heart of the hero, that speaks of 
destiny and fate and prophecy, and that sees a good fight fought for the betterment 
of humankind, and most of all, the soul. The emancipation sought is more often an 
inner one, as outside events oftentimes are beyond the control of the individual and 
sometimes controlled by prophecy. The individual soul, however, is the focus of 
such an emancipation, and at the core of each franchise stands the hero who has to 
come to terms with which side to choose, and, to put it bluntly, how to save one’s 
soul. This can be an emancipation from the evil lurking beneath the human façade 
(as in Millennium, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Stargate), an emancipation from bi-
ology (The X-Files, Stargate, Star Trek) or the powers of politics, history and tradition 
(Babylon 5, Stargate). Also, the question of the duality of body and soul is problema-
tized by discussions of artificial intelligence (Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Stargate). 
As the “soul” is oftentimes a metaphor for agency and accountability, the 
question of consciousness appears to be at the very core of the matter. Are human 
beings the masters of their affairs, would they even know it if they weren’t? There 
is a dangerous conceit that only humans would possess consciousness. Proof of 
that, there is none. Consciousness has been elevated, time and again, into the realm 
of the metaphysical, by applying the terminology of the soul to it. Even in psychol-
ogy this is still done, albeit in translation. Sometimes, behind the psyche still lingers 
the notion of the soul. But it has been that science of the soul itself casting doubts 
on the very accountability of what still remains cherished as our inner- or even out-
ermost sanctum: The notion that there exist processes inside that much-awed and 
mystery-ridden something which carries our thinking and feeling that can be totally 
independent from our direct control, the very idea that although we may think we 
know what we are thinking, in fact we aren’t. That very insight has inspired a great 
deal of both stupefaction and resistance over the entirety of human culture. There 
is a reason that Freud has gathered such fearsome praise, a reputation alternating 
between utter reverence and complete rejection, that he can indeed be lined up 
with Copernicus and Charles Darwin as the third in a line of discontinuities which 
question not only human authority but much more the human role in a scheme of 
supposed destiny (cf. page 97). 
Both teleology and anthropocentrism have suffered a terrible fate by the 
hands of all these three, but one needn’t even go that far. It has been the taking 
away of destiny from the hands of deities which, for a brief time, seemed to allow 
for a notion of true human agency to surface and soar. But humankind has always 
known to make deals with their gods. Even if there was a god, one could barter 
one’s way out of prophecy, and only in the radical beginnings, in times of “awaken-
ing,” could there be said to have been a more decisive call for accepting prophecy. 
Any well-grown and well-situated religious group knows that to invoke prophecy is 
to invite disaster, because it invites an interpretation that could topple the leading 

132

structures. But in the hands of outcasts, teleology becomes an escape from per-
ceived oppression. In the minds of narcissistic heroes, there is no better way to 
prove one’s worthiness than standing up to the dark fates and claiming one’s own 
destiny. In the minds of zealots, there is no better way to prove one’s value to the 
cause than by demonstrating how well one know one’s destiny, how well one 
knows God’s plan, and how sincerely one is willing to subjugate one’s self under it. 
But these teleologies are safely marked as potentially problematic by being at-
tached to the notion of belief. There is no proof for the existence of a deity, that’s 
the very point. Religion, in a way, is akin to art by invoking the suspension of disbe-
lief. Or is art akin to religion? In any case, religious theology and teleology do carry 
the warning lights of over-interpretation. The Bible is very clear in demanding that 
one should not use the name of God in vain, and to make no graven images: a clear 
protection against any kind of zeal. This hints at a sense of transparency in the text, 
and it provides a warning: human understanding of God’s ways is limited.  
Once we enter the realm of science, teleologies, and especially their toppling, 
are given an extra edge. Given that science, per definition, is about the accumula-
tion of temporary knowledge, and that it accepts and even welcomes the disproving 
of past and present findings by future insight, it nevertheless, mostly precisely due 
to that given, provides a much greater authority in its teachings. It is entirely possi-
ble, though maybe not plausible, to still believe in magical creatures if part of their 
definition is their elusiveness. It is hardly possible to deny the existence of DNA 
once the live molecule has been seen in action. Its meaning could still be nego-
tiated, but it’s there, for all to see. Thomas, the disciple who would not believe the 
reappearance of the resurrected Christ unless he could touch him, is not a favored 
figure in religious tradition, his un-suspended disbelief breaks the deal. Science is 
about suspended belief. 
Belief, however, is not just found in the realm of the directly religious. Reli-
gion is a social construct, but it is founded upon a collection of memes that rein-
force themselves and depend on each other. That what makes up religious thinking 
can be found in cultural artifacts as well; one of these is the Mythological Genre 
within narrative fictions. Herein, belief can become even more unsuspended than 
in established religions. Religious memes, in religious organizations usually bound 
for social and political reasons, can flourish within fictional texts and even create a 
mythologized version of science that works like magic, also known as science fic-
tion. In a society that allegedly has become more scientific than any other in histo-
ry, it is not just fundamentalist religions but also strongly mythological fictions that 
counter such a trend. 
Fiction, from a memetic perspective, only serves its own interests. Thus it is 
no wonder that the oldest and most successful memes are still strong. Modern he-
roes function like Greek or any other tribal gods and demigods, and versions of the 
Odyssey are found throughout science fiction en masse. The interest of fiction is to 

 
Chapter 10: Conclusion

strengthen fiction itself, and it appears that religious thinking is alive and well in the 
Mythological Genre (which is only the most drastic example). Notwithstanding the 
differences within all the various franchises, this kind of fiction seems to converge 
upon common themes. Does there thus appear little room for human agency and 
artistic freedom? How do human beings fit into this view of culture? 
… and Recovered 
KELIS THE POET: My patron’s been angered by the leader of a neighboring state. He’ll 
want to take revenge. It could lead to war. […] I need a way to change his mind! […] I be-
lieve the right kind of play can turn the mind from violent thoughts. The perfect play might 
even stop a war! (Star Trek: Voyager, 6.22 “Muse,” 20:42-21:12) 
Memes have sometimes been described as viruses or parasites, and there are occa-
sions when such a view can be seen as valid. Occasionally, culture indeed seems 
detached from reality and standing in contrast to real human needs. But memetic 
theory cannot be seen without also recurring to human beings, just as a view of bi-
ology that would only be interested in genes, not organisms, would be misleading. 
The memetic view holds merit if it can be used to analyze the evolution of certain 
ideas, and also in that it underlines that fiction may be produced by human beings, 
but not necessarily created in an auctorial way. Yet memes like those found within 
the Mythological Genre are thriving because they are selected for by a human au-
dience. Myths, both ancient and new, are popular because their content corres-
ponds to human psychology and aesthetics. 
The adaptation of mythological themes can still produce material that can be 
highly relevant for contemporary political and social debates as well. Stories within 
science fiction, fantasy and horror may be densely metaphorical and allegorical con-
structs following certain genre conventions more than that which can be seen in 
the real world. Yet notwithstanding all this, even topics that may appear “out there” 
have a basis in the real world. Conspiracy theories may all be false, yet still they 
speak to a drastic loss of trust in the government and a growing skepticism of cur-
rent institutions of democracy. Alien abduction tales may reveal less about actual 
alien visitations than about child abuse, and again a feeling of being overwhelmed 
by powerful forces. Stories of white knights in shining armor that have been fa-
vored by fate to fight the powers of darkness reveal a desire to overcome injustices 
and corruption. The dualistic belief in a separate soul that may endure beyond 
death and even conquer the material world through telepathy and telekinesis speaks 
to an enduring desire to gain or maintain control over one’s life. 
There may be escapism in fiction, especially within the Mythological Genre. 
But this escape is an escape from a perceived valley of darkness to a world more 
just and more fulfilling, thus problematizing social and political issues today. These 
texts of wonder and magic, tragedy and hope, continue the tradition within litera-
ture and culture of speaking about the human condition.

Creating Magical Worlds
Otherness and Othering in Harry Potter
Frankfurt am Main, Berlin, Bern, Bruxelles, New York, Oxford, Wien, 2009. 
114 pp.
ISBN 978-3-631-58071-4  ·  pb. € 22.80*
A huge success in both bookshops and cinemas, the Harry Potter-series has 
drawn millions of readers and viewers into its magical world. In constructing 
this world, however, J. K. Rowling has created Harry and his friends in sharp 
contrast to other members of the magical and non-magical world. Creating 
Magical Worlds: Otherness and Othering in Harry Potter argues that the 
identities of the heroes are mainly based on delimitation from and rivalry 
to other characters: the Slytherins and Deatheaters, foreign students from 
Durmstrang and Beauxbatons, magical races such as the house-elves and 
centaurs, Muggles and Squibs as well as, to a certain extent, girls and women. 
Apart from explaining the social psychological and psychoanalytical reasons 
behind this exclusion, Creating Magical Worlds also shows in how far this 
delimitation is necessary for the action and the plot of the series.
Contents: Alterity and identity · Othering in social psychology and psycho-
analysis · Exoticism ·Racism · Sexism · Slytherin as evil · House-elves and 
garden-gnomes as subhuman · Hagrid as uncivilised · Centaurs as exotic · 
Muggles and Squibs as conventional · Durmstrang and Beauxbatons as real-life 
other · Females as others
