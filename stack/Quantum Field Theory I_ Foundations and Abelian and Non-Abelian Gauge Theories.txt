Preface to Volume I
This textbook is based on lectures given in quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) over the
years to graduate students in theoretical and experimental physics. The writing of
the book spread over three continents: North America (Canada), Europe (Ireland),
and Asia (Thailand). QFT was born about 90 years ago, when quantum mechanics
met relativity, and is still going strong. The book covers, pedagogically, the wide
spectrum of developments in QFT emphasizing, however, those parts which are
reasonably well understood and for which satisfactory theoretical descriptions have
been given.
The legendary Richard Feynman in his 1958 Cornell, 1959–1960 Cal Tech
lectures on QFT of fundamental processes, the ﬁrst statement he makes, the very
ﬁrst one, is that the lectures cover all of physics.1 One quickly understands what
Feynman meant by covering all of physics. The role of fundamental physics is to
describe the basic interactions of Nature and QFT, par excellence, is supposed to
do just that. Feynman’s statement is obviously more relevant today than it was
then, since the recent common goal is to provide a uniﬁed description of all the
fundamental interactions in nature.
The book requires as background a good knowledge of quantum mechanics,
including rudiments of the Dirac equation, as well as elements of the Klein-Gordon
equation, and the reader would beneﬁt much by reading relevant sections of my
earlier book: Quantum Theory: A Wide Spectrum (2006), Springer in this respect.
This book differs from QFT books that have appeared in recent years2 in several
respects and, in particular, it offers something new in its approach to the subject, and
the reader has plenty of opportunity to be exposed to many topics not covered, or

Preface to Volume I
just touched upon, in standard references. Some notable differences are seen, partly,
from unique features in the following material included in ours:
•
The very elegant functional differential approach of Schwinger, referred to
as the quantum dynamical (action) principle, and its underlying theory are
used systematically in generating the so-called vacuum-to-vacuum transition
amplitude of both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories, in addition to the well-
known functional integral approach of Feynman, referred to as the path-integral
approach, which are simply related by functional Fourier transforms and delta
functionals.
•
Transition amplitudes are readily extracted by a direct expansion of the vacuum-
to-vacuum transition amplitude in terms of a unitarity sum, which is most closely
related to actual experimental setups with particles emitted and detected prior and
after a given process and thus represent the underlying physics in the clearest
possible way.
•
Particular emphasis is put on the concept of a quantum ﬁeld and its particle
content, both physically and technically, as providing an appropriate description
of physical processes at sufﬁciently high energies, for which relativity becomes
the indispensable language to do physics and explains the exchange that takes
place between energy and matter, allowing the creation of an unlimited number
of particles such that the number of particles need not be conserved, and for
which a variable number of particles may be created or destroyed. Moreover,
quantum mechanics implies that a wavefunction renormalization arises in QFT
ﬁeld independent of any perturbation theory – a point not sufﬁciently emphasized
in the literature.
•
The rationale of the stationary action principle and emergence of ﬁeld equations,
via ﬁeld variations of transformation functions and generators of ﬁeld variations.
The introduction of such generators lead, self consistently, to the ﬁeld equations.
Such questions are addressed as: “Why is the variation of the action, within the
boundaries of transformation functions, set equal to zero which eventually leads
to the Euler-Lagrange equations?”, “How does the Lagrangian density appear in
the formalism?” “What is the signiﬁcance in commuting/anti-commuting ﬁeld
components within the interaction Lagrangian density in a theory involving ﬁeld
operators?” These are some of the questions many students seem to worry about.
•
A panorama of all the ﬁelds encountered in present high-energy physics, together
with the details of the underlying derivations are given.
•
Schwinger’s point splitting method of currents is developed systematically in
studying abelian and non-abelian gauge theories anomalies. Moreover,an explicit
experimental test of the presence of an anomaly is shown by an example.
•
Derivation of the Spin & Statistics connection and CPT symmetry, emphasizing
for the latter that the invariance of the action under CPT transformation is not
sufﬁcient for CPT symmetry, but one has also to consider the roles of incoming
and outgoing particles.

Preface to Volume I
vii
•
The ﬁne-structure effective coupling ˛ ' 1=128 at high energy corresponding
to the mass of the neutral Z 0 vector boson based on all the charged leptons and
all those contributing quarks of the three generations.
•
Emphasis is put on renormalization theory, including its underlying general
subtractions scheme, often neglected in treatments of QFT.
•
Elementary derivation of Faddeev-Popov factors directly from the functional
differential formalism, with constraints, and their modiﬁcations, and how they
may even arise in some abelian gauge theories.
•
A fairly detailed presentation is given of “deep inelastic” experiments as a
fundamental application of quantum chromodynamics.
•
Schwinger line integrals, origin of Wilson loops, lattices, and quark conﬁnement.
•
Neutrino oscillations,3 neutrino masses, neutrino mass differences, and the
“seesaw mechanism.”
•
QCD jets and parton splitting, including gluon splitting to gluons.
•
Equal importance is put on both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories,
witnessing the wealth of information also stored in the abelian case.4
•
A most important, fairly detailed, and semi-technical introductory chapter is
given which traces the development of QFT since its birth in 1926 without
tears, in abelian and non-abelian gauge theories, including aspects of quantum
gravity, as well as examining the impact of supersymmetry, string theory, and the
development of the theory of renormalization, as a pedagogical strategy for the
reader to be able to master the basic ideas of the subject at the outset before they
are encountered in glorious technical details later.
•
Solutions to all the problems are given right at the end of the book.
With the mathematical rigor that renormalization has met over the years and
the reasonable agreement between gauge theories and experiments, the underlying
theories are in pretty good shape. This volume is organized as follows. The ﬁrst
introductory chapter traces the subject of QFT since its birth, elaborating on
many of its important developments which are conveniently described in a fairly
simple language and will be quite useful for understanding the underlying technical
details of the theory covered in later chapters including those in Volume II. A
preliminary chapter follows which includes the study of symmetry transformations
in the quantum world, as well as of intricacies of functional differentiation and
functional integration which are of great importance in ﬁeld theory. Chapter 3
deals with quantum ﬁeld theory methods of spin 1/2 culminating in the study of
anomalies in the quantum world. The latter refers to the fact that a conservation law
3It is rather interesting to point out that the theory of neutrino oscillations was written up in this
book much earlier than the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics was announced on neutrino oscillations.
4With the development of non-abelian gauge theories, unfortunately, it seems that some students
are not even exposed to such derivations as of the “Lamb shift” and of the “anomalous magnetic
moment of the electron” in QED.

Preface to Volume I
in classical physics does not necessarily hold in the quantum world. Chapter 4, a
critical one, deals with the concept of a quantum ﬁeld, the Poincaré algebra, and
particle states. Particular attention is given to the stationary action principle as
well as in developing the solutions of QFT via the quantum dynamical principle.
This chapter includes the two celebrated theorems dealing with CPT symmetry
and of the Spin & Statistics connection. A detailed section is involved with the
basic quantum ﬁelds one encounters in present day high-energy/elementary-particle
physics and should provide a useful reference source for the reader. Chapter 5 treats
abelian gauge theories (QED, scalar boson electrodynamics) in quite details and
includes, in particular, the derivations of two of the celebrated results of QED
which are the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and the Lamb shift.
Chapter 6 is involved with non-abelian gauge theories (electroweak, QCD, Grand
uniﬁcation).5 Such important topics are included as “asymptotic freedom,” “deep
inelastic” scattering, QCD jets, parton splittings, neutrino oscillations, the “seesaw
mechanism” and neutrino masses, Schwinger-line integrals, Wilson loops, lattices,
and quark conﬁnement. Uniﬁcation of coupling parameters of the electroweak
theory and of QCD are also studied, as well as of spontaneous symmetry breaking
in both abelian and non-abelian gauge theories, and of renormalizability aspects of
both gauge theories, emphasizing the so-called BRS transformations for the latter.
We make it a point, pedagogically, to derive things in detail, and some of such
details are relegated to appendices at the end of the respective chapters with the
main results given in the sections in question. Five general appendices, at the end
of this volume, cover some additional important topics and/or technical details.
In particular, I have included an appendix covering some aspects of the general
theory of renormalization and its underlying subtractions scheme itself which is
often neglected in books on QFT. Fortunately, my earlier book, with proofs not just
words, devoted completely to renormalization theory – Renormalization (1983),
Academic Press – may be consulted for more details. The problems given at the
end of the chapters form an integral part of the book, and many developments in
the text depend on the problems and may include, in turn, additional material. They
should be attempted by every serious student. Solutions to all the problems are given
right at the end of the book for the convenience of the reader. The introductory
chapter together with the introductions to each chapter provide the motivation and
the pedagogical means to handle the technicalities that follow them in the texts.
I hope this book will be useful for a wide range of readers. In particular, I
hope that physics graduate students, not only in quantum ﬁeld theory and high-
energy physics, but also in other areas of specializations will also beneﬁt from it
as, according to my experience, they seem to have been left out of this fundamental
area of physics, as well as instructors and researchers in theoretical physics. The
content of this volume may be covered in one-year (two semesters) quantum ﬁeld
theory courses.
5QED and QCD stand, respectively, for quantum electrodynamics and quantum chromodynamics.

In Volume II, the reader is introduced to quantum gravity, supersymmetry, and
string theory,6 which although may, to some extent, be independently read by a
reader with a good background in ﬁeld theory, the present volume sets up the
language, the notation, provides additional background for introducing these topics,
and will certainly make it much easier for the reader to follow. In this two-volume
set, aiming for completeness in covering the basics of the subject, I have included
topics from the so-called conventional ﬁeld theory (the classics) to ones from the
modern or the new physics which I believe that every serious graduate student
studying quantum ﬁeld theory should be exposed to.
Without further ado, and with all due respect to the legendary song writer Cole
Porter, let us ﬁnd out “what is this thing called QFT?”

Acknowledgements
In the beginning of it all, I was introduced to the theoretical aspects of quantum
ﬁeld theory by Theodore Morris and Harry C. S. Lam, both from McGill and to
its mathematical intricacies by Eduard Prugoveˇcki from the University of Toronto.
I am eternally grateful to them. Over the years, I was fortunate enough to attend
a few lectures by Julian Schwinger and beneﬁted much from his writings as well.
Attending a lecture by Schwinger was quite an event. His unique elegant, incisive,
physically clear approach and, to top it off, short derivations were impressive. When
I was a graduate student, I would constantly hear that Schwinger “does no mistakes.”
It took me years and years to understand what that meant. My understanding of this
is because he had developed such a powerful formalism to do ﬁeld theory that,
unlike some other approaches, everything in the theory came out automatically and
readily without the need to worry about multiplicative factors in computations, such
as 2’s and other numerical factors, and, on top of this, is relatively easy to apply.
Needless to say this has much inﬂuenced my own approach to the subject. He had
one of the greatest minds in theoretical physics of our time.
I want to take this opportunity as well to thank Steven Weinberg, the late Abdus
Salam, Raymond Streater, and Eberhard Zeidler for the keen interest they have
shown in my work on renormalization theory.
I acknowledge with thanks the support I received from several colleagues, while
visiting their research establishments for extended periods, for doing my own thing
and writing up the initial notes on this project. These include Yasushi Takahashi
and Anton Z. Capri from the University of Alberta, Lochlainn O’Raifeartaigh
and John Lewis from the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, and Jiri Patera
and Pavel Winternitz from the University of Montreal. For the ﬁnal developments
of the project, I would like to thank Sujin Jinahyon, the President of Nare-
suan University, Burin Gumjudpai, Seckson Sukhasena, Suchittra Sa-Nguansin,
and Jiraphorn Chomdaeng of the university’s Institute for Fundamental Study
for encouragement, as well as Ahpisit Ungkitchanukit and Chai-Hok Eab from
Chulalongkorn University.
I am also indebted to many of my former graduate students, who are now
established physicists in their own rights, particularly to Chaiyapoj Muthaporn,

Nattapong Yongram, Siri Sirininlakul, Tukkamon Vijaktanawudhi (aka Kanchana
Limboonsong), Prasopchai Viriyasrisuwattana, and Seckson Sukhasena, who
through their many questions, several discussions, and collaborations have been
very helpful in my way of analyzing this subject.
Although I have typed the entire manuscripts myself, and drew the ﬁgures as
well, Chaiyapoj Muthaporn prepared the LATEX input ﬁles. Without his constant
help in LATEX, this work would never have been completed. I applaud him, thank
him and will always remember how helpful he was. My special thanks also go
to Nattapong Yongram for downloading the endless number of papers I needed to
complete the project.
I was fortunate and proud to have been associated with the wonderful editorial
team of Maria Bellantone and Mieke van der Fluit of Springer. I would like to
express my deepest gratitude to them for their excellent guidance, caring, patience,
and hard work in making this project possible and move forward toward its
completion. I have exchanged more emails with Mieke than with anybody else on
the globe. This has led to such an enjoyable association that I will always cherish.
This project would not have been possible without the patience, encouragement,
and understanding of my wife Tuenjai. To my parents, who are both gone, this work
is affectionately dedicated.

The major theme of quantum ﬁeld theory is the development of a uniﬁed theory
that may be used to describe nature from microscopic to cosmological distances.
Quantum ﬁeld theory was born 90 years ago, when quantum theory met relativity,
and has captured the hearts of the brightest theoretical physicists in the world. It is
still going strong. It has gone through various stages, met various obstacles on the
way, and has been struggling to provide us with a coherent description of nature
in spite of the “patchwork” of seemingly different approaches that have appeared
during the last 40 years or so, but still all, with the common goal of uniﬁcation.
As mentioned in our Preface, Feynman, in his 1958 Cornell, 1959–1960 Cal
Tech, lectures on the quantum ﬁeld theory of fundamental processes, the ﬁrst
statement he makes, the very ﬁrst one, is that the lectures will cover all of physics
[76, p. 1]. One quickly understands what Feynman meant by covering all of physics.
After all, the role of fundamental physics is to describe the basic interactions we
have in nature and quantum ﬁeld theory is supposed to do just that. Feynman’s
statement is obviously more relevant today than it was then, since the recent
common goal is to provide a uniﬁed description of all the fundamental forces in
nature. With this in mind, let us trace the development of this very rich subject from
the past to the present, and see what the theory has been telling us all these years.
When the energy and momentum of a quantum particle are large enough, one is
confronted with the requirement of developing a formalism, as imposed by nature,
which extends quantum theory to the relativistic regime. A relativistic theory, as
a result of the exchange that takes place between energy and matter, allows the
creation of an unlimited number of particles and the number of particles in a given
physical process need not be conserved. An appropriate description of such physical
processes for which a variable number of particles may be created or destroyed, in
the quantum world, is provided by the very rich concept of a quantum ﬁeld. For
example, photon emissions and absorptions, in a given process, are explained by the
introduction of the electromagnetic quantum ﬁeld. The theory which emerges from
extending quantum physics to the relativistic regime is called “Relativistic Quantum

Introduction
Field Theory” or just “Quantum Field Theory”. Quantum Electrodynamics is an
example of a quantum ﬁeld theory and is the most precise theory devised by man
when confronted with experiments. The essence of special relativity is that all
inertial frames are completely equivalent in explaining a physical theory as one
inertial frame cannot be distinguished from another. This invariance property of
physical theories in all inertial frames, as required by special relativity, as well as by
the many symmetries one may impose on such theories, are readily implemented in
the theory of quantum ﬁelds. The implementation of symmetries and describing
their roles in the explanation of observed phenomena has played a key role in
elementary particle physics.
Of course it took years before the appropriate language of quantum ﬁeld theory,
described concisely above, by marrying quantum theory and relativity, was spelled
out and applied consistently to physical processes in the quantum world in the
relativistic regime. An appropriate place to start in history is when Dirac [47–49]
developed his relativistic equation of spin 1/ 2, from which one learns quite a bit
about the subsequent development of the subject as a multi-particle theory. We will
then step back a year or two, and then move again forward in time to connect
the dots between the various stages of the underlying exciting developments. His
relativistic equation, which incorporated the spin of the electron, predicted the
existence of negative energy states with negative mass, with energies going down
to 1, implying the instability of the corresponding systems. For example, an
electron in the ground-state energy of an atom would spontaneously decay to such
lower and lower negative energy states emitting radiation of arbitrary large energies
leading eventually to the collapse of the atom with the release of an inﬁnite amount
of energy. Historically, a relativistic equation for spin 0, was developed earlier by
Klein and Gordon in 1926,1 referred to as the Klein-Gordon equation, which also
shared this problem, but unlike Dirac’s theory it led to negative probabilities as well.
Dirac being aware of the negative probabilities encountered in the theory of the latter
authors, was able to remedy this problem in his equation. To resolve the dilemma
of negative energies, Dirac, in 1930,2 assumed that a priori all the negative energy
states are ﬁlled with electrons in accord to the Pauli exclusion principle, giving rise
to the so-called Dirac sea or the Dirac vacuum, so that no transitions to such states
are possible, thus ensuring the stability of the atom.
The consequences of the assumption made by Dirac above were many. A negative
energy electron in the Dirac sea, may absorb radiation of sufﬁcient energy so as
to overcome an energy gap arising from the level mc2 to Cmc2, where m is
the mass of an electron, thus making such a negative energy electron jump to a
positive energy state, leaving behind a surplus of positive energy and a surplus of
1Klein [128] and Gordon [101].

positive charge Cjej relative to the Dirac sea. This has led Dirac eventually,3 in
1931 [52], to interpret the “hole” left behind by the transition of the negative energy
electron to a positive energy state, as a particle that has the same mass as the electron
but of opposite charge. It is interesting to note that George Gamow referred4 to
Dirac’s predicted particle as a “donkey electron”, because it would move in the
opposite direction of an appropriate applied force. The physics community found
it difﬁcult to accept Dirac’s prediction until Anderson5 discovered this particle (the
positron eC), who apparently was not aware of Dirac’s prediction at the time of
the discovery.6 With the positron now identiﬁed, the above argument just given has
provided an explanation of the so-called pair production  ! eCe by a photon
( in the vicinity of a nucleus).7 Conversely, if a “hole” is created in the vacuum, then
an electron may make a transition to such a state releasing radiation giving rise to the
phenomenon of pair annihilation. A Pair created, as described above, in the vicinity
of a positively charged nucleus, would lead to a partial screening of the charge of
the nucleus as the electron within the pair would be attracted by the nucleus and
the positively charged one would be repelled. Accordingly, an electron, in the atom,
at sufﬁciently large distances from the nucleus would then see a smaller charge on
the nucleus than an electron nearby (such as one in an s-state). This leads to the
concept of vacuum polarization, and also to the concept of charge renormalization
as a result of the partial charge screening mentioned above.
The Dirac equation is Lorentz covariant, that is, it has the same form in every
inertial frame with its variables being simply relabeled reﬂecting the variables used
in the new inertial frame. It predicted, approximately, the gyromagnetic ratio g D
2 of the electron, the ﬁne-structure of the atom, and eventually anti-matter was
discovered such as antiprotons.8 It was thus tremendously successful. Apparently,9
Dirac himself remarked in one of his talks that his equation was more intelligent
than its author.10
Thus the synthesis of relativity and quantum physics, led to the discovery of the
antiparticle. The Dirac equation which was initially considered to describe a single
particle necessarily led to a multi-particle theory, and a single particle description
in the relativistic regime turned out to be not complete. A formalism which would
naturally describe creation and annihilation of particles and take into account this
3Dirac [50, 51] assumed that the particle is the proton as the positron was not discovered yet at that
time. Apart from the large mass difference between the proton and the electron, there were other
inconsistencies with such an assumption.

Introduction
multi-particle aspect became necessary. The so-called “hole” theory although it gave
insight into the nature of fundamental processes involving quantum particles in the
relativistic regime, and concepts such as vacuum polarization, turned out to be also
not complete. For example, in the “hole” theory, the number of electrons minus the
number of positrons, created is conserved by the simultaneous creation of a “hole”
for every electron ejected from the Dirac Sea. In nature, there are processes, where
just an electron or just a positron is created while conserving charge of course.
Examples of such processes are ˇ decay: n ! p C e C Qe, muon decay:
 ! e C Qe C , and ˇC decay: p ! n C eC C e, for a bound proton
in a nucleus for the latter process. Finally, Dirac’s argument of a sea of negatively
charged bosons did not work with the Klein-Gordon equation because of the very
nature of the Bose statistics of the particles. A new description to meet all of the
above challenges including the creation and annihilation of particles, mentioned
above, was necessary.
After the conceptual framework of quantum mechanics was developed, Born,
Heisenberg, and Jordan in 1926 [26], applied quantum mechanical methods to
the electromagnetic ﬁeld, now, giving rise to a system with an inﬁnite degrees of
freedom, and described as a set of independent harmonic oscillators of various
frequencies. Then Dirac in 1927 [46], prior to the developmentof his relativistic spin
1/2 equation, also extended quantum mechanical methods to the electromagnetic
ﬁeld now with the latter ﬁeld treated as an operator, and provided a theoretical
description of how photons emerge in the quantization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
This paper is considered to mark the birthdate of “Quantum Electrodynamics”, a
name coined by Dirac himself, and provided a prototype for the introduction of
ﬁeld operators for other particles with spin, such as for spin 1/2, where in the latter
case commutators in the theory are replaced by anti-commutators [125, 126] for the
fermion ﬁeld.
The ﬁrst comprehensive treatment of a general quantum ﬁeld theory, involving
Lagrangians, as in modern treatments, was given by Heisenberg and Pauli in 1929,
1930 [116, 117], where canonical quantization procedures were applied directly
to the ﬁelds themselves. A classic review of the state of affairs of quantum
electrodynamics in 1932 [68] was given by Fermi. The problem of negative
energy solutions was resolved and its equivalence to the Dirac “hole” theory was
demonstrated by Fock in 1933 [83], and Furry and Oppenheimer in 1934 [90], where
the (Dirac) ﬁeld operator and its adjoint were expanded in terms of appropriate
creation and annihilation operators for the electron and positron, thus providing
a uniﬁed description for the particle and its antiparticle. The method had a direct
generalization to bosons. The old “hole” theory became unnecessary and obsolete.11
The problem of negative energy solutions was also resolved for spin 0 bosons by
11As a young post-doctoral fellow, I remember attending Schwinger’s lecture tracing the Develop-
ment of Quantum Electrodynamics in “The Physicist’s Conception of Nature” [202], making the
statement, regarding the “hole” theory, that it is now best regarded as an historical curiosity, and
forgotten.

similar methods by Pauli and Weisskopf in 1934 [170]. The ﬁelds thus introduced
from these endeavors have become operators for creation and annihilation of
particles and antiparticles, rather than probability amplitudes.12
The explanation that interactions are generated by the exchange of quanta was
clear in the classic work of Bethe and Fermi in 1932 [18]. For example, charged
particles, as sources of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, inﬂuence other charged particles
via these electromagnetic ﬁelds. Fields as operators of creation and destruction of
particles, and the association of particles with forces is a natural consequence of ﬁeld
theory. The same idea was used by Yukawa in 1935 [249], to infer that a massive
scalar particle is exchanged in describing the strong interaction (as understood in
those days), with the particle necessarily being massive to account for the short
range nature of the strong force unlike the electromagnetic one which is involved
with the massless photon describing an interaction of inﬁnite range. The mass 
of the particle may be estimated from the expression   „=Rc, obtained formally
from the uncertainty principle, where R denotes the size of the proton, i.e., R D
1 fm D 1013 cm. In natural units, i.e., for „ D 1, c D 1, 1 fm  1=.200 MeV/.
This gives   200 MeV. Such a particle (the pion) was subsequently discovered
by the C. F. Powell group in 1947 [136].
As early as 1930s, inﬁnities appeared in explicit computations in quantum
electrodynamics by Oppenheimer [168], working within an atom, by Waller
[233, 234], and by Weisskopf [239]. The nature of these divergences, arising
in these computations, came from integrations that one had to carry out over
energies of photons exchanged in describing the interaction of the combined
system of electrons and the electromagnetic ﬁeld to arbitrary high-energies. By
formally restricting the energies of photons exchanged, as just described, to be
less than, say, , Weisskopf, in his calculations, has shown [239, 240], within the
full quantum electrodynamics, that the divergences encountered in the self-energy
acquired by the electron from its interaction with the electromagnetic ﬁeld is of
the logarithmic13 type  ln.=mc2/, improving the preliminary calculations done
earlier, particularly, by Waller, mentioned above. That such divergences, referred
to as “ultraviolet divergence”,14 are encountered in quantum ﬁeld theory should
12It is important to note, however, that the matrix elements of these ﬁeld operators between particle
states and the vacuum naturally lead to amplitudes of particles creation by the ﬁelds and to the
concept of wavefunction renormalization (see Sect. 4.1) independently of any perturbation theories.
13The corresponding expression occurs with higher powers of the logarithm for higher orders in
the ﬁne-structure constant e2=4„c.
14That is, divergences arising from the high-energy behavior of a theory. Another type of
divergence, of different nature occurring in the low energy region, referred to as the “infrared
catastrophe”, was encountered in the evaluation of the probability that a photon be emitted in a
collision of a charged particle. In computations of the scattering of charged particles, due to the
zero mass nature of photons, their simultaneous emissions in arbitrary, actually inﬁnite, in number
must necessary be taken into account for a complete treatment. By doing so ﬁnite expressions for
the probabilities in question were obtained [22].

The 2S1=2, 2P1=2 states of the Hydrogen atom are degenerate in Dirac’s theory.
In 1947 [134], Lamb and Retherford, however, were able to measure the energy
difference between these states, referred to as the “Lamb Shift”, using then
newly developed microwave methods with great accuracy. Bethe [17] then made
a successful attempt to compute this energy difference by setting an upper limit for
the energy of photon exchanged in describing the electromagnetic interaction of the
order of the rest energy of the electron mc2, above which relativistic effects take
place, relying on the assumption that the electron in the atom is non-relativistic,
and, in the process, took into consideration of the mass shift16 of the electron.
He obtained a shift of the order of 1000 megacycles which was in pretty good
agreement with the Lamb-Retherford experiment.
Very accurate computations were then made, within the full relativistic quantum
electrodynamics, and positron theory. Notably, Schwinger17 in 1948 [192], com-
puted the magnetic moment of the electron modifying the gyromagneticratio, g D 2
in the Dirac theory, to 2 .1 C ˛=2/, to lowest order in the ﬁne-structure constant.
The computation of the Lamb-Shift was also carried out in a precise manner by Kroll
and Lamb [133], and, for example, by French and Weisskopf [85], and Fukuda et al.
[88, 89].
State of affairs changed quite a bit. It became clear that an electron is accompa-
nied by an electromagnetic ﬁeld which in turn tends to alter the nature of the electron
that one was initially aiming to describe. The electron e, being a charged particle,
produces an electromagnetic ﬁeld ./. This ﬁeld, in turn, interacts back with the
electron as shown below in Fig. 1.1a. Similarly, the electromagnetic ﬁeld () may
lead to the creation of an electron-positron pair eC e, which in turn annihilate
each other re-producing an electromagnetic ﬁeld, a process referred to as vacuum-
polarization, shown in part (b). Because of these processes, the parameters initially

Fig. 1.2 As a result of the self-energy correction in Fig. 1.1a, where an electron emits and re-
absorbs a photon, the mass parameter m0, one initially starts with, does not represent the physical
mass of the electron determined in the lab. Here this is emphasized by the energy dependence on
the physical mass m of an electron in a scattering process. The dashed lines represent additional
particles participating in the process
appearing in the theory, such as mass, say, m0, vis-à-vis Fig. 1.1a, and the electron
charge, say, e0, vis-à-vis Fig. 1.1b, that were associated with the electron one starts
with, are not the parameters actually measured in the lab. For example, the energy
of a scattered electron of momentum p, in a collision process, turned up to be not
equal to

0 but rather to
p
p2 C m2, self-consistently,18 with m identiﬁed
with the actual, i.e., tabulated, mass of the electron, and m ¤ m0, with a scattering
process shown in Fig. 1.2, where the dashed lines represent other particles (such as
; e; eC), where the total charge as well as the total energy and momentum are
conserved in the scattering process.
Similarly, the potential energy between two widely separated electrons, by a
distance r, turned up to be not e2
0=4r but rather e2=4r, with e2 ¤ e2
0, where
e is identiﬁed with the charge, i.e., the tabulated charge, of the electron. As we
will see later, the physical parameters are related to the initial ones by scaling
factors, referred to as mass and charge renormalization constants, respectively. An
electron parametrized by the couple .m0; e0/, is referred to as a bare electron
as it corresponds to measurements of its properties by going down to “zero”
distances all the way into the “core” of the electron – a process that is unattainable
experimentally. On the other hand, the physical parameters .m; e/, correspond to
measurements made on the electron from sufﬁciently large distances.
One thus, in turn, may generate parameters, corresponding to a wide spectrum of
scales running from the very small to the very large. Here one already notices that in
quantum ﬁeld theory, one encounters so-called effective parameters which are func-
tions of different scales (or energies). Functions of these effective parameters turn
out to satisfy invariance properties under scale transformations, thus introducing a
concept referred to as the renormalization group. Clearly, due to the screening effect
via vacuum polarization of eCe pairs creation, as discussed earlier, the magnitude
of the physical charge is smaller than the magnitude of the bare charge.
18An arbitrary number of photons of vanishingly small energies are understood to be attached
to the external electron lines, as discussed in Footnote 14 when dealing with infrared divergence
problems.

Introduction
A process was, in turn, then carried out, referred to as “renormalization”,
to eliminate the initial parameters in the theory in favor of physically observed
ones. This procedure related the theory at very small distances to the theory at
sufﬁciently large distances at which particles emerge on their way to detectors as
it happens in actual experiments. All the difﬁculties associated with the ultraviolet
divergences in quantum electrodynamics were isolated in renormalization constants,
such as the ones discussed above, and one was then able to eliminate them in
carrying out physical applications giving rise to completely ﬁnite results. This
basic idea of the renormalization procedure was clearly spelled out in the work
of Schwinger, Feynman, and Tomonaga.19 The renormalization group,20 mentioned
above, describes the connection of renormalization to scale transformations, and
relates, in general, the underlying physics at different energy scales.
In classic papers, Dyson [59, 60] has shown not only the equivalence of the
Schwinger, Feynman, and Tomonaga approaches,21 and the ﬁniteness of the so-
called renormalized quantum electrodynamics, but also developed a formalism for
computations that may be readily applied to other interacting quantum ﬁeld theories.
Theories that are consistently ﬁnite when all the different parameters appearing
initially in the theory are eliminated in favor of the physically observed ones, which
are ﬁnite in number, are said to be renormalizable. Dyson’s work, had set up:
renormalizability as a condition for generating ﬁeld theory interactions.
In units of „
D 1, c D 1, ŒMass D ŒLength1. Roughly speaking, in a
renormalizable theory, no coupling constants can have the dimensions of negative
powers of mass. (Because of dimensional reasons, we note, in particular, that one
cannot have too many derivatives of the ﬁelds, describing interactions, as every
derivative necessitates involving a coupling of dimensionality reduced by one in
units of mass.)
The photon as the agent for transmitting the interaction between charged parti-
cles, is described by a vector – the vector potential. In quantum electrodynamics,
as a theory of the interaction of photons and electrons, for example, the photon is
coupled locally to the electromagnetic current. The latter is also a vector, and the
interaction is described by their scalar product (in Minkowski space) ensuring the
relativistic invariance of the underlying theory. To lowest order in the charge e of
the electron e, this coupling may be represented by the diagram Fig. 1.3a. On the
other hand, for a spin 0 charged boson ', say, one encounters two such diagrams,
each shown to lowest order in the charge e in Fig. 1.3b, where we note that in the
second diagram in the latter part, two photons emerge locally from the same point.
19This is well described in their Nobel lectures: Schwinger [201], Feynman [75], Tomonaga [225],
as well as in the collection of papers in Schwinger [198, 201].
20Stueckelberg and Peterman [209], Gell-Mann and Low [93], Bogoliubov and Shirkov [25],

21The best sources for these approaches are their Nobel Lectures: Schwinger [201], Feynman [75],

Quantum Electrodynamics, was not only the theory of interest. There was also
the weak interaction. The preliminary theory of weak interaction dates back to Fermi
[69, 70]. Based on weak processes such as ˇ decay: n ! p C e C Qe,
he postulated that the weak interactions may be described by local four-point
interactions involving a universal coupling parameter GF. The four particles of the
process just mentioned, interact locally at a point with a zero range interaction.
The Fermi theory was in good agreement in predicting the energy distribution of
the electron. For dimensional reasons, however, the dimensions of the coupling
constant GF involved in the theory has the dimensions of ŒMass2, giving rise to a
non-renormalizable theory.22 In analogy to quantum electrodynamics, the situation
with this type of interaction may be somehow improved by introducing, in the
process, a vector Boson23 W which mediates an interaction24 between the two
pairs (so-called currents), .n; p/ and .e; Qe/, with both necessarily described by
entities carrying (Lorentz) vector indices, to ensure the invariance of the underlying
description. Moreover, in units of „ D 1, c D 1, a dimensionless coupling g is
introduced. The Fermi interaction and its modiﬁcation are shown, respectively in
parts Fig. 1.4a, b.
In order that the process in diagram given in part Fig. 1.4b, be consistent with
the “short-range” nature of the Fermi interaction, described by the diagram on the
left, the vector particle W must not only be massive but its mass, MW must be
quite large. This is because the propagator of a massive vector particle of mass
MW, which mediates an interaction between two spacetime points x and x 0, as we
will discuss below, behaves like ı.4/.x  x 0/=M 2
W for a large mass, signifying
22It is interesting to point out as one goes to higher and higher orders in the Fermi coupling
constant GF, the divergences increase (Sect. 6.14) without any bound and the theory becomes
uncontrollable.
23 A quantum relativistic treatment of a problem, implies that a theory involving the W particle,
must also include its antiparticle WC, having the same mass as of W.
24Such a suggestion was made, e.g., by Klein [129].

providing no damping in such a limit. Moreover, as one goes to higher orders in
perturbation theory the number of integration variables, over energy and momenta
arising in the theory, increase, and the divergences in turn increase without bound
and the theory becomes uncontrollable.27 On the other hand, an inherited property
of quantum electrodynamics is gauge symmetry due to the masslessness of the
photon. In the present context of ultraviolet divergences, the photon propagator has
a very welcome vanishing property at high energies. This gauge symmetry as well
as the related massless aspect of the photon, which are key ingredients in the self
consistency of quantum electrodynamics, turned out to provide a guiding principle
in developing the so-called electroweak theory.
In 1956 [138], an important observation was made by Lee and Yang that parity
P is violated in the weak interactions. Here we recall that, given a process, its parity
transformed (mirror) version, is obtained by reversing the directions of the space
variables.28 This has led Gershtein and Zel’dovich [95], Feynman and Gell-Mann
[77], Sudarshan and Marshak [210], and Sakurai [178], to express the currents
27The damping provided by the propagators of a massless vector particle, a spin 1/2 particle, and
a spin 0 particle, for example, in the ultraviolet region vanish like 1/energy2, 1/energy, 1/energy2,
respectively.
28 It was later observed that the product of charge conjugation, where a particle is replaced by its
antiparticle, and parity transformation “CP”, is also not conserved in a decay mode of K mesons
at a small level [38, 39, 82]. As the product “CPT”, of charge conjugation, parity transformation,
and time reversal “T”, is believed to be conserved, the violation of time reversal also follows. For
a test of such a violation see CPLEAR/Collaboration [36].

constructed out of the pairs of ﬁelds: .n; p/,.e; Qe/; : : : in the Fermi theory to
reﬂect, in particular, this property dictated by nature. The various currents were
eventually expressed and conveniently parametrized in such a way that the theory
was described by the universal coupling parameter GF. The construction of such
fundamental currents together with idea of intermediate vector bosons exchanges to
describe the weak interaction led eventually to its modern version.
Quantum Electrodynamics may be considered to arise from local gauge invari-
ance in which the electron ﬁeld is subjected to a local phase transformation ei#.x/.
The underlying group of transformations is denoted by U.1/ involving simply
the identity as the single generator of transformations with which the photon is
associated as the single gauge ﬁeld. In 1954 [247], Yang and Mills, and Shaw
in 1955 [203], generalized the just mentioned abelian gauge group of phase
transformations, encountered in quantum electrodynamics, to a non-abelian29 gauge
theory, described by the group SU.2/,30 and turned out to be a key ingredient in the
development of the modern theory of weak interactions. This necessarily required
the introduction, in addition to the charged bosons W˙, a neutral one. What
distinguishes a non-abelian gauge theory from an abelian one, is that in the former
theory, direct interactions occur between gauge ﬁelds, carrying speciﬁc quantum
numbers, unlike in the latter, as the gauge ﬁeld – the photon – being uncharged.
As early as 1956, Schwinger believed that the weak and electromagnetic
interactions should be combined into a gauge theory [97, 159, 199]. Here we
may pose to note that both in electrodynamics and in the modiﬁed Fermi theory,
interactions are mediated by vector particles. They are both described by universal
dimensionless coupling constants e, and by g (see (1.1)) in the intermediate vector
boson description, respectively. In a uniﬁed description of electromagnetism and the
weak interaction, one expects these couplings to be comparable, i.e.,

Glashow, a former graduate student of Schwinger, eventually realized [96]31 the
important fact that the larger group SU.2/  U.1/, is needed to include also
electrodynamics within the context of a Yang-Mills-Shaw theory. A major problem
remained: the local gauge symmetry required that the gauge ﬁelds associated with
the group must, a priori, be massless in the initial formulation of the theory.
The problem of the masslessness of the vector bosons was solved by Weinberg
[236, 238] and Salam [182, 183],32 by making use of a process,33 referred to as
spontaneous symmetry breaking, where a scalar ﬁeld interacting with the vector
bosons, whose expectation value in the vacuum state is non zero, leads to the
generation of masses to them.34 This is referred to as the Higgs35 mechanism, in
which the group SU.2/  U.1/ is spontaneously broken to the group U.1/ with
the latter associated with the photon, and, in the process, the other bosons, called
W˙; Z 0, acquiring masses, thanks to the Higgs boson, and renormalizability may
be achieved. The latter particle has been also called the “God Particle”.36 The mere
existence of a neutral vector boson Z 0 implies the existence of a weak interaction
component in the theory without a charge transfer, the so-called neutral currents. A
typical process involving the neutral Z 0 boson exchange is in Q Ce ! Q Ce
shown in Fig. 1.5 not involving the muon itself. Neutral currents37 have been
observed,38 and all the vector bosons have been observed39 as well. It turned out
that the theory with spontaneous symmetry did not spoil the renormalizability of
31See also Salam and Ward [189].
32See also Salam and Ward [187–189] and Salam [181].
33Some key papers showing how spontaneous symmetry breaking using spin 0 ﬁeld may generate
masses for vector bosons are: Englert and Brout [63], Englert et al. [64], Guralnik et al. [110], and
Kibble [127].
34Apparently the Legendary Victor Weisskopf was not impressed by this way of generating masses.
In his CERN publication [241], on page 7, 11th line from below, he says that this is an awkward
way to explain masses and that he believes that Nature should be more inventive, but experiments
may prove him wrong.
35Higgs [119–121]. This work followed earlier work of Schwinger [200], where he shows, by
the exactly solvable quantum electrodynamics in two dimensions, that gauge invariance does not
prevent the gauge ﬁeld to acquire mass dynamically, as well as of the subsequent work of Anderson
[7] in condensed matter physics.
36This name was given by Lederman and Teresi [137].
37Neutral current couplings also appear in Bludman’s [23] pioneering work on an SU.2/ gauge
theory of weak interactions but did not include electromagnetic interactions.

the resulting theory with massive vector bosons. Proofs of renormalizability were
given by ’t Hooft [216, 217].40 It seems that Sydney Coleman used to say that
’t Hooft’s proof has turned the Weinberg-Salam frog into an enchanted prince.41
The “Electroweak Theory” turned up to be quite a successful theory.42
Another interaction which was also developed in the “image” of quantum
electrodynamics was quantum chromodynamics, as a theory of strong interactions
based, however, on the non-abelian gauge symmetry group SU.3/. Here one notes
that a typical way to probe the internal structure of the proton is through electron-
proton scattering. The composite nature of the proton, as having an underlying
structure, becomes evident when one compares the differential cross sections for
elastic electron-proton scattering with the proton described as having a ﬁnite
extension to the one described as a point-like particle. With a one photon exchange
description, the form factors in the differential cross section are seen to vanish
rapidly for large momentum transfer (squared) Q2 of the photon imparted to the
proton. As Q2 is increased further one reaches the so-called resonance region,43
beyond which, one moves into a deep inelastic region, where experimentally the
reaction changes “character”, and the corresponding structure functions of the
differential cross section have approximate scaling properties (Sect. 6.9), instead of
the vanishing properties encountered with elastic form factors, the process of which
is depicted in Fig. 1.6. Such properties indicate the presence of approximately free
point-like structures within the proton referred as partons, which consist of quarks,
gluons together with those emitted44 from their scattering reactions. This led to the
development of the so-called parton model,45 as a ﬁrst approximation, in which
these point-like particles within the proton are free and the virtual photon interacts

42The basic idea of the renormalizability of the theory rests on the fact that renormalizability may
be established for the theory with completely massless vector bosons, as in QED, one may then
invoke gauge symmetry to infer that the theory is also renormalizable for massive vector bosons
via spontaneous symmetry breaking.

proton as a whole.
The non-abelian gauge symmetry group SU.3/, is needed to accommodate
quarks and gluons, involving eight generators with which the gluons are associated.
Here, in particular, a quantum number referred to as “color” (three of them)47 is
assigned to the quarks. One of the many reasons for this is that the spin 3/2 particle
CC, which is described in terms of three identical quarks (the so-called u quarks)
as a low lying state with no orbital angular momentum between the quarks, behaves
as a symmetric state under the exchange of two of its quarks and would violate the
Spin & Statistics connection without this additional quantum number. The color
degrees of freedom are not observed in the hadronic states themselves and the latter
behave as scalars, that is they are color singlets, under SU.3/ transformations.
As the group SU.3/ involves “color” transformations within each quark ﬂavor, it
may be denoted by SU.3/color or just by SU.3/C. The gluons also carry “color”
and direct gluon-gluon interactions then necessarily occur, unlike the situation with

Introduction
photons in quantum electrodynamics since photons do not carry a charge. These
gluon-gluon interactions turn out to have an anti-screening effect on a source ﬁeld
which dominate over the screening effect of quark/antiquark interactions leading to
the interesting fact that the effective coupling of quark interactions becomes smaller
at high-energies, and eventually vanish48 – a phenomenon referred to as asymptotic
freedom. This has far reaching consequences as it allows one to develop perturbation
theory at high energies, in the effective coupling, and carry out various applications
which were not possible before the development of the theory, and is consistent
with deep-inelastic experiments of leptons with nucleons, with the latter described
by point-like objects which, at high energies, scatter almost like free particles,49 as
mentioned above, the process of which is shown Fig. 1.6.
A particular experiment which indirectly supports the idea of quarks having
spin 1/2 stems from eeC annihilation to a quark-antiquark, in the center of mass
system. One would naïvely expect that the quark and the antiquark will emerge from
the process moving in opposite directions50 on their ways to detectors and will be
observed. This is not, however, what happens and instead two narrow jets of hadrons
emerge, moving back-yo-back, with the net jet-axis angular distribution consistent
with a spin 1/ 2 character of the quark/antiquark parents sources.
The electroweak theory and quantum chromodynamicstogether constitute the so-
called standard model51 with underlying gauge symmetry group SU.3/  SU.2/ 
U.1/.
The effective coupling in quantum chromodynamics is expected to become larger
at large distances increasing with no bound providing a strong conﬁning force
of quarks and gluons restricting them within hadrons – a phenomenon that is
sometimes referred to as infrared slavery.52
From our discussion of quantum electrodynamics, we recall that the effective
coupling of a U.1/ gauge theory, as an abelian gauge theory, increases with
energies. On the other hand, the asymptotic free nature of non-abelian gauge
theories, imply that the effective couplings associated with the groups SU.3/,
SU.2/, decrease with energy. Due to the smallness of the U.1/ coupling in
comparison to the other two at the present low energies, this gives one the hope that
at sufﬁcient high energies these three couplings merge together and the underlying
theory would be described by one single force. A theory which attempts to unify
the electroweak and the strong interactions is called a grand uniﬁed theory. Such
theories have been developed53 and the couplings seem to run to merge roughly
48This was discovered by Gross and Wilczek [106] and Politzer [172]. See also Vanyashin and
Terentyev [229] for preliminary work on vector bosons.
49Chromodynamics means Colordynamics, and the name Quantum Chromodynamics is attributed
to Gell-Mann, see, e.g., Marciano and Pagels [158].
50See, e.g., Fig. 6.7d, and Sect. 6.10.3

somewhere around 1015–1016 GeV. This, in turn, gives the hope of the development
of a more fundamental theory in which gravitation, which should be effective at
energy scale of the order of Planck energy scale
p
„c=GN ' 1019 GeV,54 or
even at a lower energy scale, where GN denotes Newton’s gravitational constant,
is uniﬁed with the electroweak and strong forces. If the standard model is the
low energy of such a fundamental theory, then the basic question arises as to
what amounts for the enormous difference between the energy scale of such
a fundamental theory (1016–1019 GeV) and the deﬁning energy scale of the
standard model (300 GeV)? This has been termed as the hierarchy problem which
will be discussed again later. We will see in Vol. II, in particular, that the above
mentioned couplings seem to be uniﬁed at a higher energy scale of the order
1016 GeV, when supersymmetry is taken into account, getting it closer to the energy
scale at which gravitation may play an important role.
One may generalize the symmetry group of the standard model, and consider
transformations which include transformations between quarks and leptons, leading
to a larger group such as, for example, to the SU.5/ group, or a larger group, which
include SU.3/  SU.2/  U.1/. The advantage of having one larger group is
that one would have only one coupling parameter and the standard model would
be recovered by spontaneous symmetry breaking at lower energies. This opens the
way to the realization of processes in which baryon number is not conserved, with a
baryon, for example, decaying into leptons and bosons. The experimental55 bound
on lifetime of proton decay seems to be >1033 years and is much larger than the
age of the universe which is about 13.8 billion years.56 Such a rare event even if it
occurs once will give some support of such grand uniﬁed theories.
We have covered quite a large territory and before continuing this presentation,
we pose for a moment, at this appropriate stage, to discuss three aspects of
importance that are generally expected in order to carry out reliable computations
in perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory. These are:
1. The development of a powerful and simple formalism for doing this.
2. To show how the renormalization process is to be carried, and establish that the
resulting expressions are ﬁnite to any order of perturbation theory.
3. The physical interpretation will be completed if through the process of renor-
malization, the initial experimentally unattainable parameters in the theory are
eliminated in favor of physically observed ones, which are ﬁnite in number, and
are generally determined experimentally as discussed earlier in a self consistent
manner.
54The Planck energy (mass) will be introduced in detail later.
55See, e.g., Olive et al. [167].
56A decay of the proton may have a disastrous effect in the stability of matter over anti-matter itself
in the universe. See, however, the discussion given later on the dominance of matter in the visible
universe.

Introduction
Perturbatively renormalizable theories are distinguished from the non-renormaliz-
able ones by involving only a ﬁnite number of parameters in the theory that are
determined experimentally.
We discuss each of these in turn.
1. A powerful formalism is the Path Integral one, pioneered by Feynman,57 deﬁning
a generating functional for so-called Green functions from which physical
amplitudes may be extracted, and has the general structure
R
dŒ¦ eiAction. Here
dŒ¦ deﬁnes a measure of integration over classical ﬁelds as the counterparts
of the quantum ﬁelds of the theory.58 “Action” denotes the classical action. In
the simplest case, the measuredŒ¦ takes the form ˘x d.x/ as a product of
all spacetime points. In gauge theories, due to constraints, the determination of
the measure of integrations requires special techniques59 and takes on a much
more complicated expression and was successfully carried out by Faddeev and
Popov in 1967.60 The path integral expression as it stands, involves continual
integrations to be carried out.
An equally powerful and quite an elegant formalism is due to Schwinger,61
referred to as the Action Principle or the Quantum Dynamical Principle. For
quantum ﬁeld theory computations, the latter gives the variation of the so-called
vacuum-to-vacuumtransition amplitude (a generating functional): •h 0Cj0i as
any of the parameters of the theory are made to vary. The latter is then expressed
as a differential operator acting on a simple generating functional expressed
in closed form. This formalism involves only functional differentiations to be
carried out, no functional integrations are necessary, and hence is relatively
easier to apply than the path integral. We will learn later, for example, that the
path integral may be simply obtained from the quantum dynamical principle
by a functional Fourier transform thus involving functional integrals. Again the
application of the quantum dynamical principle to the quantization of gauge
theories with underlying constraints require special techniques and it was carried
out in Manoukian [150].
All the fundamental interactions in nature are presently described theoretically
by gauge theories, involving constraints, and the two approaches of their
quantization discussed above will be both treated in this book for pedagogical
reasons and are developed 62
57See Feynman and Hibbs [78] for the standard pedagogical treatment. See also Feynman [75].
58We use a general notation .x/ for the ﬁelds as functions of spacetime variable and suppress all
indices that they may carry to simplify the notation. These ﬁelds may include so-called Grassmann
ﬁelds.

2. Historically, Abdus Salam, was the ﬁrst “architect” of a general theory of renor-
malization. In 1951, he carried out a systematic study63 of renormalization [180],
introduced and sketched a subtraction scheme in a general form. Surprisingly,
this classic paper was not carefully reexamined until much later. This was
eventually done in 1976 [147] by Manoukian, and inspired by Salam’s work,
a subtraction scheme was developed and brought to a mathematically consistent
form, and the ﬁniteness of the subtracted, i.e., renormalized, theory was proved
by the author64 to any order of perturbation theory.65 by using, in the process, a
power counting theorem established by Weinberg [235] for integrals of a special
class of functions, thus completing the Dyson-Salam program. The subtraction
was carried out directly in momentum space and no cut-offs were introduced.
Shortly after the appearance of Salam’s work, two other “architects” of a
general theory of renormalization theory, Bogoliubov and Parasiuk, in a classic
paper in 1957 [24], also developed a subtraction scheme. In 1966 [118], Hepp
gave a complete proof of the ﬁniteness of the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk to any order
of perturbation theory, by using in the intermediate stages ultraviolet cut-offs,
and in 1969 [251], Zimmermann formulated their scheme in momentum space,
without cut-offs, and provided a complete proof of ﬁniteness as well, thus
completing the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk program. This scheme is popularly known
as the BPHZ scheme.
The equivalence of the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk scheme, in the Zimmermann
form, and our scheme was then proved by Manoukian,66 after some systematic
cancelations in the subtractions. This equivalence theorem67 uniﬁes the two
monumental approaches of renormalization.68

includes references to several of my earlier papers on the subject as well as many results related to
renormalization theory.

67This result has been also referred to as “Manoukian’s Equivalence Principle”, Zeidler [250],
p. 972. See also Streater [207].
68I was pleased to see that our equivalence theorem has been also considered, by completely
different methods, by Figueroa and Gracia-Bondia [80]. For other earlier, and recent, but different,
approaches to renormalization theory, see, e.g., Epstein and Glaser [65], Kreimer [131, 132],

out of Salam’s, Streater [207] writes: “It is the end of a long chapter in the history of physics”
The development of the general theory of renormalization from the DS and
BP programs may be then summarized as given in Fig. 1.869.
3. The physical interpretation of the theory is completed by showing that the
subtractions of renormalization are implemented by counterterms in the theory
which have the same structures as the original terms in the theory (i.e., in
the Lagrangian density),70 thus establishing the self-consistency involved in the
elimination of the initial parameters in the theory in favor of physically observed
ones. As mentioned above, for a theory to be renormalizable, i.e., involving
only a ﬁnite number of parameters determined, in general, experimentally, the
counterterms of the theory must be ﬁnite in number as well.
All particles due to their energy content experience the gravitational attraction.
Einstein’s theory of gravitation, also referred to as general relativity (GR), is
described by a second rank tensor with the energy-momentum tensor of matter
as its source from which the energy density of matter may be deﬁned. It may
not be described just by a scalar or just by a vector ﬁeld as they are inconsistent
with experiment. It is easy to see that due to the fact that masses have the same
signs (positive) a theory based on a vector ﬁeld alone will lead to a repulsive
rather an attractive gravitational force.71 GR theory predictions are well supported
experimentally in our solar system.
The key observation, referred to as the principle of equivalence, of Einstein is that
at any given point in space and any given time, one may consider a frame in which
gravity is wiped out at the point in question. For example, in simple Newtonian
gravitational physics, a test particle placed at a given point inside a freely falling
elevator on its way to the Earth, remains at rest, inside the elevator, for a very
short time, depending on the accuracy being sought, and, depending on its position
relative to the center of the Earth, eventually moves, in general, from its original
position in a given instant. Einstein’s principle of equivalence applies only locally

at a given point and at a given time. At the point in question, in the particular
frame in consideration, gravity is wiped out and special relativity survives. The
reconciliation between special relativity and Newton’s theory of gravitation, then
readily leads to GR, where gravity is accounted for by the curvature of spacetime
and its departure from the ﬂat spacetime of special relativity one has started out
with upon application of the principle of equivalence. By doing this, one is able to
enmesh non-gravitational laws with gravity via this principle.
Quantum gravity (QG) is needed in early cosmology, black hole physics, and,
in general, to deal with singularities that arise in a classical treatment. QG must
also address the problem of the background geometry. A common interest in
fundamental physics is to provide a uniﬁed description of nature which is applicable
from microscopic to cosmological distances. A fundamental constant of unit of
length that is expected to be relevant to this end is the Planck length as well as the
Planck mass. Out of the fundamental constants of quantum physics „, of relativity
c, and the Newtonian gravitational one GN, we may deﬁne a unit of length and
mass, the Planck length and Planck mass, respectively, relevant in quantum gravity,
through the following

in powers of mass (ŒEnergy D ŒMass; ŒLength D ŒMass1 D ŒTime; : : :), and, as
gravitation has a universal coupling to all forms of energy, one may hope that it
may be implemented within a uniﬁed theory of the four fundamental interactions,
with the Planck mass providing a universal mass scale. Unfortunately, it is difﬁcult
experimentally to investigate the quantum properties of spacetime as one would be
working at very small distances.
GR predicts the existence of Black holes. Here it is worth recalling of the
detection (“Observational waves from a binary black hole merger”, Phys. Rev. Lett.
116, 061102 (1–16) (2016)) by B. P. Abbott et al. of gravitational waves from the
merger of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from the Earth. Recall that a black
hole (BH) is a region of space into which matter has collapsed and out of which
light may not escape. It partitions space into an inner region which is bounded by
a surface, referred to as the event horizon which acts as a one way surface for light
going in but not coming out. The sun’s radius is much larger than the critical radius
of a BH which is about 2.5 km to be a black hole for the sun. We will see that
for a spherically symmetric BH of mass M, the radius of the horizon is given by
RBH D 2GNM=c2.72
72This may be roughly inferred from Newton’s theory of gravitation from which the escape speed
of a particle in the gravitational ﬁeld of a spherically symmetric massive body of mass M, at a
distance r, is obtained from the inequality v2=2  GNM=r < 0, and by formally replacing v by

One may argue that the Planck length may set a lower limit spatial cut-off. The
following formal and rough estimates are interesting. Suppose that by means of a
high energetic particle of energy E, hE2i  hp2ic2, with hp2i very large, one is
interested in measuring a ﬁeld within an interval of size ı around a given point in
space. Such form of energy acts as an effective gravitational mass M 

which, in turn distorts space around it. The radius of the event horizon of such a
gravitation mass M is given by rBH D 2GNM=c2. Clearly we must have ı > rBH,
otherwise the region of size ı that we wanted to locate the point in question will be
hidden beyond a BH horizon, and localization fails. Also:

Interesting investigations by Hawking73 have shown that a BH is not really a
black body, it is a thermodynamicobject, it radiates and has a temperature associated
with it.74 In Chapter 7 in Vol. II , we will see, considering a spherically symmetric
BH, that its temperature is given by75

referred to as the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy formula76 of a BH. This relation
relates quantum gravity to information theory. This result is expected to hold in any
consistent formulation of quantum gravity, and shows that a BH has entropy unlike
what would naïvely expect from a BH with the horizon as a one way classical surface
through which information is lost to an external observer. The proportionality of the
entropy to the area rather than to the volume of a BH horizon should be noted. It
also encompasses Hawking’s theorem of increase of the area with time with increase
of entropy. We will discuss the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy formula below in
conjunction with loop quantum gravity and string theory.
Now we turn back to the geometrical description of gravitation given earlier, and
introduce a gravitational ﬁeld to account for the departure of the curved spacetime
metric from that of the Minkowski one to make contact with the approaches of
conventional ﬁeld theories, dealing now with a ﬁeld permeating an interaction
between all dynamical ﬁelds. The quantum particle associated with the gravitational
ﬁeld, the so-called graviton, emerges by considering the small ﬂuctuation of the
metric, associated with curved spacetime of GR about the Minkowski metric, as
the limit of the full metric, where the gravitational ﬁeld becomes weaker and the
particle becomes identiﬁed. This allows us to determine the graviton propagator
in the same way one obtains, for example, the photon propagator in QED, and
eventually carry out a perturbation theory as a ﬁrst attempt to develop a quantum
theory of gravitation.
In units of „ D 1; c D 1, Newtons gravitational constant GN , in 4 dimensional
spacetime, has the dimenionality Œ GN  D Œ Mass 2, which is a dead give away of
the non-renormalizabilty of a quantum theory of gravitation based on GR. The non-
renormalizability of the theory is easier to understand by noting that the divergences,
in general, tend to increase as we go to higher orders in the gravitational coupling
constant without a bound, implying the need of an inﬁnite of parameters need to
be ﬁxed experimentally77 and hence is not of any practical value. Some theories
which are generalizations of GR, involving higher order derivatives, turn out to be
renormalizable78 but violate, in a perturbative setting, the very sacred principle of
positivity condition of quantum theory. Unfortunately, such a theory involves ghosts
in a perturbative treatment, due to the rapid damping of the propagator at high
energies faster than 1=energy2, and gives rise, in turn, to negative probabilities.79
One is led to believe that Einstein’s general relativity is a low energy effective
theory as the low energy limit of a more complicated theory, and as such it provides
a reliable description of gravitation at low energies. Moreover, one may argue that
the non-renormalizability of a quantum theory based on GR is due to the fact that
one is trying to use it at energies which are far beyond its range of validity. As a

matter of fact the derivatives occurring in the action, in a momentum description via
Fourier transforms, may be considered to be small at sufﬁciently low energies. In
view of applications in the low energy regime, one then tries to separate low energy
effects from high energy ones even if the theory has unfavorable ultraviolet behavior
such as in quantum gravity.80 Applications of such an approach have been carried
out in the literature as just cited, and, for example, the modiﬁcation of Newton’s

Conventional quantum ﬁeld theory is usually formulated in a ﬁxed, i.e., in, a
priori, given background geometry such as the Minkowski one. This is unlike the
formalism of “Loop Quantum Gravity” (LQG) also called “Quantum Field Theory
of Geometry”. The situation that we will encounter in this approach is of a quantum
ﬁeld theory in three dimensional space, which is a non-perturbative background
independent formulation of quantum gravity. The latter means that no speciﬁc
assumption is made about the underlying geometric structure and, interestingly
enough, the latter rather emerges from the theory. Here by setting up an eigenvalue
equation of, say, an area operator, in a quantum setting, one will encounter a
granular structure of three-dimensional space yielding a discrete spectrum for area
measurements with the smallest possible having a non-zero value given to be of the
order of the Planck length squared: „GN=c3 
1066 cm2.82 The emergence of
space in terms of “quanta of geometry”, providing a granular structure of space, is
a major and beautiful prediction of the theory. The 3 dimensional space is generated
by a so-called time slicing procedure of spacetime carried out by Arnowitt, Deser
and Misner.83 The basic ﬁeld variables in the theory is a gravitational “electric” ﬁeld,
which determines the geometry of such a 3 dimensional space and naturally emerges
from the deﬁnition of the area of a surface in such a space, and its canonical conju-
gate variable is referred to as the connection. By imposing equal time commutation
relation of these two canonically conjugate ﬁeld variables, the quantum version of
the theory arises, and the fundamental problem of the quantization of geometry
follows. The basic idea goes to Penrose [171] whose interest was to construct the
concept of space from combining angular momenta. It is also interesting that the
proportionality of entropy and the surface area of the BH horizon in the Bekenstein-
Hawking Entropy formula has been derived in loop quantum gravity.84

Introduction

Supersymmetry is now over 40 years old. Supersymmetry provides a symmetry
between fermions and bosons. Borrowing a statement made by Dirac, speaking
of theories, in general, it is a theory with mathematical beauty.85 The name
“Supersymmetry” for this symmetry is attributed to Salam and Strathdee as it
seemed to have ﬁrst appeared in the title of one of their papers [184]. An abbreviated
name for it is SUSY, as some refer to this symmetry. The latter is not only
beautiful but is also full of thought-provoking surprises. To every degree of freedom
associated with a particle in the standard model, in a supersymmetric version,
there corresponds a degree of freedom associated with a partner, referred to as a
sparticle, with the same mass and with opposite statistics to the particle.86 Unlike
other discoveries, supersymmetry was not, a priori, invented under pressure set by
experiments and was a highly intellectual achievement. Theoretically, however, it
quickly turned out to be quite important in further developments of quantum ﬁeld
theory. For one thing, in a supersymmetric extention of the standard model, the
electroweak and strong effective couplings do merge at energies about 1016 GeV,
signalling the possibility that these interactions are different manifestations of a
single force in support of a grand uniﬁed theory of the fundamental interactions.
Also gravitational effects are expected to be important at the quantum level at the
Planck energy of the order 1019 GeV, or possibly at even lower energies, giving the
hope of having a uniﬁed theory of the four fundamental interactions at high energies.
Supersymmetry leads to the uniﬁcation of coupling constants. SUSY also tends to
“soften” divergences of a theory in the sense that divergent contributions originating
from fermions tend to cancel those divergent contributions originating from bosons
due to their different statistics.
One of the important roles that supersymmetry may play in a supersymmetric
extension of the standard problem is in the so-called hierarchy problem. The basic
idea of a facet of this is the following. A fundamental energy scale arises in the
standard model from the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs boson which sets
the scale for the masses in the theory, such as for the masses of the vector bosons.
It turns out that the masses imparted to the initially massless vector bosons, for
example, via the Higgs mechanism, using the parameters in the Lagrangian density
are in very good agreement with experimental results. On the other hand, if one
introduces a large energy scale cut off   1015 GeV, of the order of a grand uniﬁed
energy scale, or the Planck energy scale 1019 GeV, at which gravitation may play a
signiﬁcant role, to compute the shift of the squared-mass of the Higgs boson, as a
scalar particle, due to the dynamics (referred to as radiative corrections), it turns out
to be quadratic87 in , which is quite large for such a large cut-off. This requires
that the bare mass squared of the Higgs boson to be correspondingly large to cancel
85Here we recall the well known statement of Dirac, that a theory with mathematical beauty is
more likely to be correct than an ugly one that ﬁts some experimental data [53].
86This is such that the total number of fermion degrees of freedom is equal to the total bosonic
ones.

Introduction
such a quadratic dependence on  and obtain a physical mass of the Higgs boson
of the order of magnitude of the minute energy88 . 10 2 GeV/, in comparison,
characterizing the standard model, and this seems quite unnatural for the cancelation
of such huge quantities.89 This unnatural cancelation of enormously large numbers
has been termed a facet of the hierarchy problem. Supersymmetric theories have,
in general, the tendency to cancel out such quadratic divergences, up to possibly of
divergences of logarithmic type which are tolerable, thus protecting a scalar particle
from acquiring such a large bare mass. So supersymmetry may have an important
role to play here.
SUSY relates fermions to bosons, and vice versa, and hence a generator is
required which is of fermionic type, that is, it carries a spinor index as in the
Dirac ﬁeld90 to carry out a transformation fermion $ boson. Since the spins of
fermions and bosons are different, this necessarily means that such a generator does
not commute with the angular (spin) momentum operator as supersymmetry unites
particles of the same mass and different spins into multiplets. Bosons and fermions
have, in general, different masses, which means that SUSY is to be spontaneously
broken if such a symmetry is to have anything to do with nature. If supersymmetry
breaking sets at such an energy scale as 1 TeV or so, then some of the lowest mass
superpartners may be hopefully discovered.91
Of particular interest was also the development of the superspace concept as
an extension of the Minkowski one, where one includes an additional degree of
freedom usually denoted by92  D .a/ to the space coordinates .t; x/, which
turns out to be quite convenient in deﬁning and setting up SUSY invariant integrals
such as the action of a dynamical system.93 To describe dynamics this, in turn,
necessitates to introduce superﬁelds of different types94 as functions of these
variables.
The extension of the algebra of the Poincaré group to a superalgebra was ﬁrst
carried out by Gol’fand and Likhtman in [100] to construct supersymmetric ﬁeld
theory models, and with the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking
88Aad et al. [1] and Chatrchyan et al. [31].
89As mentioned earlier, the question, in turn, arises as to what amounts for the enormous difference
between the energy scale of grand uniﬁcation and the energy scale that characterizes the standard
model.
90This point is of importance because an earlier attempt by Coleman and Mandula [33] to enlarge
the Poincaré group did not work. They considered only so-called “Bose” generators (that is tensors,
and not spinors) in their analysis.
91Perhaps an optimist would argue that since antiparticles corresponding to given particles were
discovered, the discovery of superpartners associated with given particles would not be out of
the question either. The underlying symmetries involved in these two cases are, however, quite of
different nature.
92This is called a Grassmann variable.
93See Salam and Strathdee [185, 186].
94Details on superﬁelds will be given in Vol. II. The explicit expression of the pure vector superﬁeld
has been recently obtained in Manoukian [155].

by Volkov and Akulov in [232]. In [243], Wess and Zumino also,95 independently,
developed supersymmetric models in 4 dimensions, and this work has led to an
avalanche of papers on the subject and to a rapid development of the theory. In
particular, supersymmetric extensions of the standard model were developed,96
supergravity, as a supersymmetric extension of gravitational theory, was also
developed.97 Unfortunately, things do not seem to be much better for supergravity,
as far as its renormalizability is concerned.98
Now we come to String Theory. String Theory is a theory which attempts to
provide a uniﬁed description of all the fundamental interactions in Nature and,
in particular, give rise to a consistent theory of quantum gravity. A string is a
fundamental one dimensional extended object, and if it has to do with quantum
gravity, it is, say, of the order of the Plank length `P D
p
GN „=c3  1033 cm,
involving the three fundamental constants: Newton’s gravitational constant GN, the
quantum unit of action „, and the speed of light c. Since no experiments can probe
distances of the order of the Planck length, such a string in present day experiments
is considered to be point-like. When a string, whether closed or open, moves in
spacetime, it sweeps out a two dimensional surface referred to as a worldsheet.
String Theory is a quantum ﬁeld theory which operates on such a two dimensional
worldsheet. This, as we will see, has remarkable consequences in spacetime itself,
albeit in higher dimensions. Particles are identiﬁed as vibrational modes of strings,
and a single vibrating string may describe several particles depending on its
vibrational modes. Strings describing bosonic particles are referred to as a bosonic
strings, while those involving fermionic ones as well are referred to as superstrings.
The remarkable thing is that the particles needed to describe the dynamics of
elementary particles arise naturally in the mass spectra of oscillating strings, and
are not, a priori, assumed to exist or put in by hand in the underlying theories.
The dimensionality of the spacetime in which the strings live are predicted by the
underlying theory as well and are necessarily of higher dimensions than four for
consistency with Lorentz invariance of spacetime at the quantum level, consisting
of a dimensionality of 26 for the bosonic strings and a spacetime dimensionality of
10 for the superstrings. The extra dimensions are expected to curl up into a space
that is too small to be detectable with present available energies. For example the
surface of a hollow extended cylinder with circular base is two dimensional, with
one dimension along the cylinder, and another one encountered as one moves on
its circumference. If the radius of the base of the cylinder is relatively small, the
cylinder will appear as one dimensional when viewed from a large distance (low
energies). Accordingly, the extra dimensions in string theory are expected to be

Introduction
small and methods, referred to as compactiﬁcations,99 have been developed to deal
with them thus ensuring that the “observable” dimensionality of spacetime is four.
Superstring theories involve fermions and are thus relevant to the real world,
but there are, however, several superstring theories. Also unlike the loop quantum
gravity, which provides a background independent formulation of spacetime with
the latter emerging from the theory itself, as discussed earlier, the strings in
string theories are assumed to move in a pre-determined spacetime, and thus
spacetime plays a passive role in them.100 A theory, referred to as M-Theory,101
based on non-perturbative methods, is envisaged to unify the existing superstrings
theories into one single theory, instead of several ones, and be related to them by
various limiting and/or transformation rules, referred to as dualities,102 and is of 11
dimensional spacetime. M-Theory is believed to be approximated by 11 dimensional
supergravity,103 and the spacetime structure is envisaged to emerge from the theory
as well. Bosonic strings involve tachyonic states. This is unlike the situation in
superstring theories in which supersymmetry plays a key role in their deﬁnitions,
and a process referred to as a GSO projection method, ensuring the equality of the
degrees of freedom of bosonic and fermionic states, as required by supersymmetry,
in turn implies that no tachyonic states appear in the theory.104
String theory was accidentally discovered through work carried out by Veneziano
in 1968 when he attempted to write down consistent explicit expressions of meson-
meson scattering amplitudes in strong interactions physics.105 This was, of course
before the discovery of QCD. With the many excited states of mesons and baryons
(resonances), it was observed experimentally that there exists a linear relationship
between spin J and the mass M squared of a resonance given by a linear relationship
with a universal slope W

deﬁning so-called Regge trajectories. Veneziano postulated and wrote down a
scattering amplitude of meson – meson scattering: p1.m1/ C p2.m2/ ! p3.m3/ C
p4.m4/, which, in particular, showed that the amplitude involves the exchange of an
inﬁnite number of particles (corresponding to arbitrary integer spins). This is unlike
the situation in conventional ﬁeld theory as QED or the standard model, where they
involve the exchange of a ﬁnite number of particles to any given order. String theory
shares this property of the Veneziano amplitude. As a matter of fact the Veneziano

amplitude may be derived from string theory. Nambu [164], Nielsen [166] and
Susskind [211] have shown that the famous expression of the amplitude postulated
by Veneziano may be interpreted as a quantum theory of scattering of relativistic
strings. Although, a priori, this was assumed to describe a strong interaction process,
Yoneya [248], and Scherk and Schwarz [190] made use of the fact that string theory
(involving closed strings) contains a spin 2 massless state, which was identiﬁed
with the elusive graviton, in addition to a whole spectrum of other excitation modes,
to propose that string theory provides a framework for the uniﬁcation of general
relativity and quantum mechanics. As early as 1971, Neveu and Schwarz [165],
and Raymond [173] included fermions in their analyses, which eventually led to
the notion of superstrings, and during a short period of time, several types106 of
superstrings were introduced in the literature.
Due to the assumed non-zero extensions of strings, it is hoped that they provide,
naturally, an ultraviolet cut-off   .`P/1 and render all processes involving
strings ultraviolet ﬁnite. This is unlike conventional quantum ﬁeld theory inter-
actions where all the quantum ﬁelds are multiplied locally at the same spacetime
points, like multiplying distributions at the same point, and are, in this sense, quite
troublesome.
In string theory, two strings with given vibrational modes, identifying two
given particles, may combine forming one string with an arbitrary number of
different vibrational modes associated with a myriad number of particles, deﬁning
generalized 3-vertices. The combined string may again split into two strings with
associated vibrational modes, identiﬁed appropriately with two more particles,
describing a scattering process of 2 particles ! 2 particles. Thus interactions
involve string worldsheets of various topologies arise.
Other extended objects are also encountered in string theory called branes which,
in general, are of higher spatial dimensions than one, with the string deﬁned as a one
dimensional brane. For example, an open string, satisfying a particular boundary
condition, referred to as a Dirichlet boundary condition, speciﬁes a hypersurface,
referred to as a D brane, on which the end points of the open string reside. On the
other hand, the graviton corresponds to a vibrational mode of closed strings, and
since the latter, having no ends, may not be restricted to a brane and moves away
from it. This might explain the weakness of the gravitational ﬁeld, if our universe
is a 3 dimensional brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime. Massless
particles encountered in string theory are really the physically relevant ones because
of the large unit of mass .`P/1  1019 GeV in attributing masses to the spectrum
of massive particles.107 As we will see a massless particle may acquire mass if,

107A systematic analysis of all the massless ﬁeld excitations encountered in both bosonic and
superstrings are investigated in Manoukian [152–154], in their respective higher dimensional
spacetimes, and include the determinations of the degrees of freedom associated with them. Note
that in four dimensional spacetime the number of degrees of freedom (spin states) of non-scalar
ﬁelds is always two. This is not true in higher dimensional spacetime. For example, the degrees of
freedom associated with a massless vector particle is 8 in 10 dimensions, while for the graviton is

for example, the end points of the open string are attached to two different branes,
instead of a single brane.
We will learn the remarkable facts that Einstein’s general relativity as well as
Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory may be obtained from string theory.
Interesting high energy scattering amplitudes have been computed in string
theory over the years,108 which provide a hint that space may not be probed
beyond the Planck length – a result shared with “loop quantum gravity”. It is worth
mentioning that the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy relation has been also derived in
string theory.109
In recent years much work has been done, which is worth mentioning here
but rather brieﬂy, indicating that general relationships may exist between ﬁeld
theories and string theories, and consequently considerable attention was given
trying to make such a statement more and more precise, with the ultimate hope
of providing, in turn, a consistent and acceptable quantum theory of gravitation
relevant to our world but much work still remains to be done. In particular,
much study has been made to study the equivalence relation between certain four
dimensional gauge theories and superstring theories, referred to as the AdS/CFT
correspondence, where AdS space stands for anti-de-Sitter space, and CFT stands
for conformal ﬁeld theory.110 Such correspondences have been also referred to
as Gauge/Gravity duality, as well as Maldacena duality, a duality which was
ﬁrst proposed by Maldacena.111 Without going into technical details, the aim
of this work is to show, for example, the existence of an equivalence relation
between a certain supersymmetric SU.N/ Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory in 4 dimensional
Minkowski spacetime, and a superstring theory in a 5 dimensional AdS space,
having one additional dimension to the Minkowski one, and with the 5 dimensions
of the AdS space supplemented by 5 extra dimensions deﬁned by a ﬁve-sphere,
making up the 10 dimensions of superstrings mentioned earlier. The interest in this
work is that it deals with a connection between string theory (involving gravity) and
35, as shown later in Chapter 3 of Vol. II. In 4 dimensions, their degrees of freedom are, of course,
two.

supersymmetric gauge theories. This brings us into contact with the holographic
principle, in analogy to holography in capturing 3 dimensional images of objects
on a 2 dimensional (holographic) plate,112 showing that an equivalence relation
exists between the 3 and the 2 dimensional set-ups. The 4 dimensional quantum
ﬁeld theory is like a hologram capturing information about the higher dimensional
quantum gravity theory. In this case the SU(N) theory provides a holographic
description of gravitational ﬁeld. This is in analogy to black hole entropy with
its encoded information being proportional to the area rather than to the volume
of the region enclosed by the horizon. Perhaps holography is a basic property of
string theory and one expects that much has to be done before developing a realistic
quantum gravity, and in turn provide a background independent formulation for
string theory. The holographic principle was ﬁrst proposed by ’t Hooft.113
We close this chapter by commenting on two symmetries which seem to be
observed in Nature, that is of the CPT symmetry and of the Spin & Statistics
connection and of their relevance to our own existence. We will see how these
symmetries arise from quantum ﬁeld theory in Sect. 4.10 and Sect. 4.5, respectively.
CPT taken in any order, seems to be an observed symmetry in Nature, where C
stands for charge conjugation with which particles are replaced by their antiparticles
and vice versa, P represents space reﬂection, while T denotes time reversal.
Local Lorentz invariant quantum ﬁeld theories preserve (Sect. 4.10) the CPT
symmetry. Experimentally, symmetry violations are well known to occur when
one restricts to one or to the product of two transformations in CPT in dealing
with some fundamental processes. For example the violation of parity was already
established in 1957114 as well as the violation of charge symmetry.115 Later, in
1964 CP violation, and hence also of T, was observed in neutral Kaon decays.116
The CP transformation and C, provide the fundamental relations between matter
and anti-matter. The question then arises as to why we observe, apart in accelerator
experiments, only one form (matter) than the other form in the visible universe –
a key criterion for our own existence. If an equal amount of matter and anti-matter
was produced at some stage then why, our visible universe is matter dominated.
Sakharov in 1967 [177] proposed that a key reason for this is CP violation. In
more details to explain this asymmetry, he proposed that (1) baryon number is not
conserved. (This is supported by recent grand uniﬁed ﬁeld theories,) (2) CP and C
are violated, (3) the universe has gone through a phase of extremely rapid expansion
to avoid the pairing of matter and anti-matter. The violation of such symmetries, at
112Recall that the two dimensional holographic plate which registers the interference of reﬂected
light off an object and an unperturbed Laser beam stores information of the shape of the three
dimensional object. As one shines a Laser beam on it an image of the three dimensional object
emerges.

Introduction
the microscopic level, and their consequences on a macroscopic scale is certainly
intriguing.
Clearly, the “Spin & Statistics” connection, of which the Pauli exclusion
principle is a special case applicable to spin 1/ 2 particles, is important not only
in physics but in all of the sciences, and is relevant to our own existence. For
one thing, the periodic table of elements in chemistry is based on the exclusion
principle. In simplest terms, the upshot of this is that half-odd-integer spin ﬁelds
are quantized by anti-commutators, while integer spins ﬁelds are quantized by
commutators. This result is of utmost signiﬁcance for our existence. As a matter of
fact the Pauli exclusion principle is not only sufﬁcient for the stability of matter117
in our world but it is also necessary.118 In the problem of stability of neutral
matter, with a ﬁnite number of electrons per atom, but involving several nuclei, and
correspondingly a large number of electrons N, the stability of matter, based on the
Pauli exclusion principle, or instability of so-called “bosonic matter”, in which the
exclusion principle is abolished, rests rather on the following. For “bosonic matter”,
the ground state energy
EN  N˛, with ˛ > 1,119 where .N C N/ denotes
the number of the negatively charged particles plus an equal number of positively
charged particles. This behavior for “bosonic matter” is unlike that of matter, with
the exclusion principle, for which ˛ D 1.120 A power law behavior with ˛ > 1
implies instability as the formation of a single system consisting of .2N C 2N/
particles is favored over two separate systems brought together each consisting
of .N C N/ particles, and the energy released upon collapse of the two systems
into one, being proportional to Œ.2N/˛  2.N/˛, will be overwhelmingly large
for realistic large N, e.g., N  1023. Dyson [61], has estimated that without the
exclusion principle, the assembly of two macroscopic objects would release energy
comparable to that of an atomic bomb, and such “matter” in bulk would collapse
into a condensed high-density phase and our world will cease to exist.121 Ordinary
matter, due to the exclusion principle, occupies a very large volume. This point
was emphasized by Ehrenfest in a discussion with Pauli in 1931122 on the occasion
of the Lorentz medal to this effect: “We take a piece of metal, or a stone. When
we think about it, we are astonished that this quantity of matter should occupy so
large a volume”. He went on by stating that the exclusion principle is the reason:
“Answer: only the Pauli principle, no two electrons in the same state”. In this regard,

121In the Preface of Tomonaga’s book on spin [226], one reads: “The existence of spin, and the
statistics associated with it, is the most subtle and ingenious design of Nature – without it the
whole universe would collapse”.

a rigorous treatment123 shows that the extension of matter radially grows not any
slower than N1=3 for large N. No wonder why matter occupies so large a volume.
The importance of the “Spin & Statistics” connection and the role it plays in our
world cannot be overemphasized.Needless to say, no quantum ﬁeld theory treatment
is complete without the CPT Theorem and the Spin & Statistics Connection.
The present volume deals with the foundations of quantum ﬁeld theory and with
the intricacies of abelian and non-abelian gauge theories. Volume II deals with
quantum gravity, supersymmetry, and string theory.

Chapter 2
Preliminaries
This preliminary chapter deals with basic tools needed for dealing with quantum
ﬁeld theory. It begins with Wigner’s theory of symmetry transformations by showing
how symmetry is implemented in the quantum world via unitary or anti-unitary
operators. This subject matter will be also important in deriving commutation
(anti-commutation) rules between symmetry generators such as in developing the
Poincaré algebra of spacetime transformations including those in supersymmetric
ﬁeld theories which also involve fermion-boson exchanges. Some properties of
the Dirac equation and related aspects are summarized in Appendix I, at the end
of the book, for the convenience of the reader. Various representations of the
gamma matrices are spelled out, however, in the present chapter which turn out
to be important in modern ﬁeld theory, and the concept of a Majorana spinor is
also introduced. Special emphasis is put in the remaining sections on functional
differentiations and functional integrations involving Grassmann variables as well.
Functional Fourier transforms are introduced which clearly show the intimate
connection that there exists between the functional differential formalism pioneered
by Julian Schwinger and the functional integral formalism pioneered by Richard
Feynman. The last section on delta functionals, makes this connection even more
transparent and shows the simplicity of the functional formalism in general, whether
it is in differential or integral forms. It is, however, relatively easier to functionally
differentiate than to deal with continual functional integrals. Both formalisms are
used in this book for greater ﬂexibility and for a better understanding of quantum
ﬁeld theory.

2.1
Wigner’s Symmetry Transformations in the Quantum
World
Invariance of physical laws under some given transformations leads to conservation
laws and the underlying transformations are referred to as symmetry transforma-
tions. For example, invariance under time translation (e.g., by setting one’s clocks
back by a certain amount) or under space translation (by shifting the origin of
one’s coordinate system) lead, respectively, to energy and momentum conservations.
Invoking invariance properties in developing a dynamical theory, conveniently
narrows down one’s choices in providing the ﬁnal stages of a theory. Obviously, not
all transformations of a given physical system are symmetry transformations. But
invoking the invariance of a system under a set of given transformations may provide
the starting point in describing a dynamical theory, and one may then consistently
modify the theory to take into account any symmetry breaking. One may also have
symmetry breaking spontaneously which will be discussed later.
A celebrated analysis of Eugene Wigner in the thirties1 originating on symmetry
under rotations in space, spells out the nature of the transformations implemented on
elements of a Hilbert space. This result is of central importance for doing quantum
physics2 and quantum ﬁeld theory.
The physical situation that presents itself is the following. One prepares a system
in a state j i. The question then arises as to what is the probability of ﬁnding the
system in some state ji if j i is what one initially has?.3 The latter is given by
jh j ij2.
If j 0i, j 0i denote the states j i, ji, resulting from a symmetry transforma-
tion, then invariance of the above probability under such a transformation means
that
j
˝
 0 ˇˇ 0˛
j2 D jh j ij2;
(2.1.1)
and fj 0i ; j 0ig provide an equivalent description as fj i ; jig. One may scale
j 0i ; j 0i ; j i ; ji by arbitrary phase factors without changing the relevant
probabilities given in (2.1.1). Although such overall phase factors are not important,
the relative phases occurring when considering addition of such states are physically
relevant with far reaching consequences.4

not go into these points here.

To understand Wigner’s Theorem, one needs to deﬁne the following operators:
1. An operator L is called linear or anti-linear, if for any j i; ji; Œ a j i C b ji ,
where a; b are, in general, complex numbers, then
L Œ a j i C b ji  D a L j i C b L ji ;
(2.1.2)
or
L Œ a j i C b ji  D aL j i C bL ji ;
(2.1.3)
respectively, with * denoting complex conjugation.
2. A linear or anti-linear operator U is called unitary or anti-unitary, if
hU jU i D h j i ;
(2.1.4)
or
hU jU i D h j i D h ji ;
(2.1.5)
respectively.
2.1.1
Wigner’s Symmetry Transformations
Under a symmetry transformation, there exists a unitary or anti-unitary operator U
such that (2.1.2)/(2.1.4) or (2.1.3)/(2.1.5) hold true, respectively, with

Continuous transformations, for which one may also consider inﬁnitesimal ones
close to the identity operation, such as space or time translations and rotations, are
implemented by unitary operators since the identity operator I itself is trivially a
unitary one. An inﬁnitesimal change of a parameter •, under consideration, is
implemented by a given operator G, referred to as the generator of symmetry
transformation, and the corresponding unitary operator, for such an inﬁnitesimal
transformation, would take the form
U D I C i •G:

For example, for an inﬁnitesimal space translation •x, via the momentum operator
P associated with the system in consideration, the corresponding unitary operator
is given by
Ujspace D I C i •x  P:
(2.1.10)
For inﬁnitesimal time translation •, via the Hamiltonian H of the system, one has
Ujtime D I  i •H:
(2.1.11)
Moreover for a rotation of a coordinate system by an inﬁnitesimal angle • about a
unit vector n, via the angular operator J,
Ujrotation D I C i •n  J:
(2.1.12)
The latter may be more conveniently rewritten by introducing parameters •!ij, and
rewrite Ji as
J i D 1

•!ij D " ij knk•;
i; j; k D 1; 2; 3;
(2.1.13)
where a summation over repeated indices is assumed, and " ij k is totally anti-
symmetric, with "123 D C1. We may then rewrite (2.1.12) as
Ujrotation D I C i

(2.1.14)
The generators H, P, and J of the transformations are self-adjoint.
In a relativistic setting, in which this book is based, these spacetime transfor-
mations may be combined by introducing, in the process, additional operators to
this set of operators, denoted by J 0i, i D 1; 2; 3, which impart a frame with
an inﬁnitesimal velocity change •v. The unitary operator corresponding to these
inﬁnitesimal spacetime transformations then takes the elegant form

First we have to learn how the labels attached to an event in different, so-
called, inertial frames are related. This will be taken up in the next section. The
transformation rules relating this different labeling, are referred to as Lorentz
transformations in Minkowski spacetime. On the other hand, the genertors P; J
satisfy basic commutations relations and form an algebra in the sense that the
commutator of two generators is equal to a linear combination of the generators in
question. The underlying algebra is called the Poincaré algebra and will be studied
in Sect. 4.2.
In incorporating supersymmetry into physics, with an inherited symmetry exist-
ing between fermions and bosons, one introduces a generator7 of fermionic type,
that is, it carries a spinor index, referred to as a supercharge operator, and the
Poncaré algebra is extended to a larger one including anti-commutation relations
as well. This algebra is referred to as Super-Poincaré algebra.8
Typical discrete transformations, are provided by space P or time T reﬂections
(parity and time reversal) or charge conjugation C, for which a particle is replaced
by its antiparticle. A key criterion for ﬁnding out if T, for example, should be
unitary or anti-unitary is to eliminate the choice which would lead to the inconsistent
result that a Hamiltonian is unbounded from below. This is inferred as follows.
Under an inﬁnitesimal time translation •, via the Hamiltonian H of the system
under consideration, followed by a time-reversal applied to it is equivalent to a time
reversal followed by a time translation, i.e., we have the equality
Œ1  i •H T D T Œ1 C i •.H C '/;
(2.1.17)
up to a phase factor '. If T were unitary, this gives H T D T .H C '/. For a
state ji with positive and arbitrary large energy E, there would correspond a state
T ji with energy  .EC'/ and the Hamiltonian would be unbounded from below.
That is, T is to be implemented by an anti-unitary operator which, in the process
of applying time reversal, it would complex conjugate the i factor on the right-
hand side of (2.1.17). A similar analysis applied to P leads one to infer that it is to
be implemented by a unitary operator. On the other hand, C, unlike P, and T, is
not involved with space and time reﬂections, and may be implemented by a unitary
operator. Accordingly, the product CPT, in turn, is implemented by an anti-unitary

in turn, extended to what has been called superspace.

Minkowski Spacetime: Common Arena of Elementary
Particles
A fundamental principle which goes to the heart of special relativity is the
equivalence of inertial frames in describing physical laws. By this it is meant, in
particular, that dynamical equations take the same form in such frames up to a mere
relabeling of the variables of the underlying theories. Because of such relabeling
of the variables, these equations are said to transform covariantly as one goes from
one inertial frame to another and the corresponding rules of transformations are, in
general, called Lorentz transformations.
An event labeled by x D .x 0; x/, where x 0 D t (time), in one frame, say, F will
be labeled by x 0 D .x 00; x 0/ in some other frame, say, F 0. The transformation rules
which connect this different labeling of the same event are the so-called Lorentz
transformations. One inertial frame F 0 may be moving with a uniform velocity
with respect to another frame F, as determined in F, with a possible orientation of
the cartesian space coordinate axes of F 0 as also determined in F at some initial
time x 0 D 0. If an x  D 0 reading in F corresponds to an x 0  D 0 reading in
F 0, then the Lorentz transformations are called homogeneous ones. Otherwise, they
are called inhomogeneous. In the former case, the origins of the space coordinate
axes set up in F and F 0 coincide at time readings x 0 D 0, x 0 0 D 0 by observers
located at the corresponding origins of these respective coordinate systems.
We use the notation .x / D .x 0; x/ 	 x,  D 0; 1; 2; 3, and our Minkowski
metric
is deﬁned by Œ   D diag Œ 1; 1; 1; 1 , Œ   D diag Œ 1; 1; 1; 1 .
Authors who have also used this signature for the metric include, Julian Schwinger,
Steven Weinberg,... . Others may use the minus of ours. Surprisingly, Paul Dirac
has used both signatures at different times of his career. It doesn’t matter which
one to use. It is easy to keep track of the relative minus sign. In our notation,

Consistency of such a transformation requires that its structure remains the same
under subsequent transformations leading to group properties spelled out below. For
a subsequent transformation x 0 ! x 00, we may use (2.2.7) to write

(2.2.16)
Using rather a standard notation for ˇ, its physical interpretation is as follows.
From the second identity in (2.2.5) it follows from the transformation law x 0  D
 x in (2.2.1) that x D  x 0 . The origin of the spacial coordinate system of
the frame F 0 is speciﬁed by x 0j D 0; j D 1; 2; 3. From this and (2.2.14), (2.2.15),
we have x 0 D % x 0 0, x i D % ˇ ix 0 0. That is, ˇ denotes the velocity with
which the origin of the spatial coordinate system of F 0 moves relative to the
corresponding origin of F. Now put a (massive m ¤ 0) particle at the origin
of the spatial coordinate system of F, the so-called rest frame of the particle, i.e.,
with energy-momentum p  D .m; 0/. Then if no initial relative rotation of the
spatial coordinate systems of the frames is involved, the velocity of the particle in F 0
(the “laboratory” frame) would be simply ˇ, i.e., of momentum p 0 D  m % ˇ.
With a relative rotation of the coordinate systems, the relation p 0j D j 0 m gives
p 0j D Rj k. m % ˇ k/ showing simply a c.w. rotation of the earlier expression.
Equally important are the transformations (2.2.7), (2.2.13), (2.2.14), (2.2.15),
(2.2.16) for inﬁnitesimal changes •b, •, •ˇ. To ﬁrst order,

When the parameters •b, •, •ˇ are led continuously to go to zero, the induced
transformations in the underlying vector space of particle states go over to the
identity. The latter being unitary, we may refer to Wigner’s Theorem (Sect. 2.1)
to infer that an induced transformation is represented by a unitary rather than by
an anti-unitary operator. Such transformations, in turn, generate an algebra of the
corresponding generators referred to as the Poincaré algebra. The corresponding
analysis will be carried out in Sect. 4.2.
Before closing this section, we note that the general structure in (2.2.5), rewritten
in matrix form reads
>  D ;
(2.2.23)
and since det  D  1, we may infer that for the transformations in (2.2.1) det  D
C1. It is not 1 as this transformation includes neither time nor space reﬂections.
From this and (2.2.2) we learn that the Jacobian of the transformation x 0 ! x is
given by det  D 1, establishing the Lorentz invariance of the volume element in
Minkowski spacetime:
.dx/ D .dx 0/;
where .dx/ 	 dx 0 dx 1 dx 2 dx 3:
(2.2.24)
This together with the deﬁnition of a Lorentz scalar ˚.x/ by the condition
˚ 0.x 0/ D ˚.x/;
(2.2.25)
under the above Lorentz transformations, guarantees the invariance of integrals of
the form

Z
.dx/ ˚.x/;
(2.2.26)
such as the action integral, and lead to the development of Lorentz invariant theories.

Differentiation and Integration with Respect
to Grassmann Variables
Consider n real Grassmann variables 1; : : : n, i.e., variables that satisfy fi; kg D
0, pairwise, which, in particular, implies that for any k: 2
k D 0.
The left-hand derivative with respect to a variable j of any product i1 : : : ik is
deﬁned by
@
@j
i1 : : : ik D .1/ıji1 : : :bj : : : ik;
(2.4.1)
where ıj denotes the position of j from the left 1, in the product i1 : : : ik, and
j is omitted on the right-hand side of the equation as indicated by the “hat” sign on
it. One may also deﬁne a right-hand derivative, taking a derivative from the right,
with a corresponding rule.
In particular note that,
@
@k
i j D •i k j  •j k i;
(2.4.2)
and
 @
@j
; k
	
D •j k:
(2.4.3)
One may deﬁne the differential operator d D Pn
kD1 dk@=@k satisfying the rule
d.i j/ D di j C i dj:
(2.4.4)
On the other hand by using the rule in (2.4.2) in applying the differential operator
d gives
d.i j/ D di j  dj i;
(2.4.5)
which upon comparison with (2.4.4) gives
dj i D i dj:
(2.4.6)
To extend the above rules for differentiations with respect to complex variables,
one may proceed as follows. Given two real Grassmann variables R; I satisfying
fR; Ig D 0, one may deﬁne a complex Grassmann variable  D R C i I . Using
the notation  for the complex conjugate of , the following anti-commutation
rules emerge
f ; g D 0;
f ; g D 0;
f ; g D 0:

Imposing a reality restriction on the product
  D  i I R;
(2.4.8)
i.e., . / D . /, leads to the following deﬁnition
.I R/ D  I R
or
.I R/ D R I;
(2.4.9)
showing that complex conjugation of the product of two real Grassmann variables
reverses their order. This in turn implies that for complex (or real) Grassmann
variables 1; : : : ; n.

We now consider integrations with respect to real Grassmann variables. Due to
the property 2

integrals, for a given i,
Z
di;
Z
di i:
(2.4.12)
Imposing translational invariance of these integrals under i ! i C ˛i D 0

(2.4.14)
for arbitrary ˛i. We may thus infer that

Preliminaries
The second integral in (2.4.12) may be normalized as
Z
di i D 1;
(2.4.16)
for any i, a normalization condition that will be adopted in this book.
For any function f.i/ D ˛ 0 C c1 i, where c1 is a c-number, and ˛ 0 anti-
commutes with i, one clearly has
Z
di .i  ˇi/ f.i/ D f.ˇi/:
(2.4.17)
This allows one to introduce a Dirac delta given by
•.i  ˇi/ D .i  ˇi/;
(2.4.18)
being a Grassmann variable itself. That is di •.i ˇi/ commutes with Grassmann
variables.
Before introducing integrations over complex Grassmann variables, consider
making a change of integration variables
i D Cij j;
(2.4.19)
in an integral, where a summation over j understood, and the Cij are c-numbers,
i; j D 1; : : : ; n. We are thus led to consider, in general, the integral
Z
d1 : : : dn 1 : : : n D
Z
d1 : : : d n J C 1i1 i1 : : : C n i n i n;
(2.4.20)
where J is the Jacobian of the transformation to be determined. Using the anti-
commutativity property of the j, we may write
 i1 : : :  in D " i1::: in 1 : : :  n;
(2.4.21)
where " i1::: in is the Levi-Civita symbol totally anti-symmetric with " 1::: n D C1.
Using the deﬁnition of a determinant of the matrix Œ Cij 
C1i1 : : : Cnin " i1::: in D det C;
(2.4.22)
we immediately obtain
J D 1=detC;
(2.4.23)
being the inverse of det C.

2.4
Differentiation and Integration with Respect to Grassmann Variables

As before, out of two real Grassmann variables R; I, we may deﬁne a complex
one  D R C i I. Now consider the transformation R; I ! ;  deﬁned by

we like and use any notation for them. In the language of calculus they are dummy
variables. We may go even further by noting that we are free to make completely
different change of variables for the j and the former variables. Taking these two
points into account, we make the substitutions j ! j  .A1/j and 

two integrals. The ﬁrst one is

(2.5.1)
which, by now, should be straightforward to verify (see Problem 2.6). In the above
equation, we have used the standard notation .˛/ D P
j j.j˛j/. The second

one is

 .1  ˛1/ : : : .n  ˛n/.n  ˛n/ D .˛1/1.˛1/"1 : : : .˛n/n.˛n/"n;
(2.5.2)
where the j; "j are either 0 or 1, and a factor such as .0/0, (e.g., when ˛j D
0; "j D 0), is to be replaced by 1 on the right-hand side of the equation.
The second one seems more difﬁcult to verify but easily follows by ﬁrst writing
./ D ı 0 C  ı1;
./" D ı"0 C  ı"1:
(2.5.3)
The integral on the left-hand side of (2.5.2) then becomes
Z
d1.ı101ı11/ .1˛1/ .1˛1/ d1 .ı"10 C  ı"11/
    dn.ın0nın1/.n˛n/.n˛n/ dn .ı"n0 C  ı"n1/:
(2.5.4)
Therefore it remains to face the following integral which works out as follows:
Z
d .ı0   ı1/.  ˛/.  ˛/ d .ı"0 C  ı"1/
D
Z

d  .ı0 C ˛ ı1/ d  .ı"0 C ˛ ı"1/ D .˛/.˛/";
(2.5.5)
which leads from (2.5.4) to the expression on the right-hand side of (2.5.2). Now we
are ready to introduce Fourier transforms involving Grassmann variables.
Given a function
FŒ; 
which is a linear combination of terms as
Œ.1/1.1/"1 : : : .n/n.n/"n, we deﬁne its Fourier transform: .; / ! .; /

integral by

which commutes with everything, and integrate using (2.5.1) and then (2.5.2). The

We begin by extending the concept of differentiation with respect to Grassmann
variables 1; : : : ; n; 1; : : : ; n to a continuum limit as n ! 1. Such an extension
for commuting variables will then become straightforward to carry out. By a
continuum limit as n ! 1, it is meant that one introduces Grassmann type
functions a.x/; a.x/ of a continuous variable x, such as specifying spacetime
points, moreover they may also depend, in general, on discrete parameters, such as
a spinor index. By Grassmann type functions, one also means that these functions
all anti-commute for all x and all a.

Chapter 3
Quantum Field Theory Methods of Spin 1=2
With the many-particle aspect encountered by emerging relativity and quantum
physics and the necessity of describing their creation and annihilation in arbitrary
numbers, one introduces the very rich concept of a quantum ﬁeld. As a ﬁrst
encounter with this concept, we investigate, in this chapter, the very signiﬁcance
of a quantum ﬁeld for the very simple system described by the celebrated and well
known Dirac equation as given in Eq. (I.1) in Appendix I, as well as of the Dirac
equation in the presence of a general external electromagnetic potential in Eq. (I.2).
The quantum ﬁeld inevitably leads to the concept of a propagator as describing
the transfer of energy and momentum between emission sources and particle
detectors or between particles, in general. In this particular situation involved with
the Dirac ﬁeld, this necessarily leads one to investigate and understand how to invert
the Dirac operator .@=i C m/, based on physical grounds, and deﬁne carefully the
boundary conditions involved in doing this (Sect. 3.1).
The experimental set-up where a particle may be emitted or detected before or
after having participated in some physical process, respectively, as well as of the
underlying physical process itself are quite appropriately described by introducing
the so-called vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude (Sects. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5,
3.6, 3.7, and 3.8). The latter amplitude leads quite naturally to the determination of
transition amplitudes of physical processes. In particular, the positron is readily re-
discovered by extracting the amplitude by such a method for the system described
by the Dirac equation in an external electromagnetic potential probe (Sect. 3.3).
Various applications will be given including to the Coulomb scattering of
relativistic electrons, derivation of the Euler-Heisenberg effective Lagrangian, as
an example of a modiﬁcation of Maxwell’s equations, as well of the decay of the
vacuum and of the underlying Schwinger effect of pair productions by a constant
electric ﬁeld (Sect. 3.8). Particular emphasis is put on deriving the spin & statistics
connection of the Dirac quantum ﬁeld, and of the generation of gauge invariant
currents (Sects. 3.6, 3.9, and 3.10) based on Schwinger’s elegant point splitting
method. Finally it is noted that a conservation law that may hold classically does

not necessarily hold quantum mechanically and lead to modiﬁcations of the theory
in the quantum world. The breakdown of such conservation laws lead to calculable
anomalies and are treated in Sect. 3.9 and 3.10, and we provide as well of a concrete
physical example where such an anomaly is actually veriﬁed experimentally.

Dirac Quantum Field, Propagator
and Energy-Momentum Transfer: Schwinger-Feynman
Boundary Condition
In this section, we investigate the very signiﬁcance of a quantum ﬁeld for the
very simple system described by the Dirac equation in (I.1). To this end, one may
consider the matrix element of the Dirac ﬁeld  .x/, treated as a quantum ﬁeld,
between the no-particle state (vacuum) and a single particle state of a particle of
momentum-spin (p; ) as follows h vac j  .x/ j p i.
The particle may have been produced by some external emission source, and a
much more transparent treatment for understanding the meaning of such a matrix
element is to introduce a source term .x/ on the right-hand side of the Dirac
equation to reﬂect this fact:
@
i C m

 .x/ D .x/:
(3.1.1)
The presence of the external source .x/ makes the physical interpretation of
the problem at hand clearer, as it plays the role of an emitter and detector of
particles. The source is assumed to be of compact support in time, i.e., it vanishes
except within a given interval or given sets of intervals in time. Physically it means
outside the interval(s) the source ceases to operate, i.e., it is switched off, and is set
equal to zero.1 The explicit structure of .x/ is unimportant. It does not appear in
the expressions of transition amplitudes of quantum particles. The introduction of
such sources facilitate tremendously the computation of transition amplitudes, and
hence their inclusion in the analysis of the underlying physical problems is of quite
practical value. .x/, by deﬁnition of an external source, is not a quantum ﬁeld. It
is not, however, a classical one either as such, but a Grassmann variable. This latter
point does not concern us yet at this stage and we will come back to it later.
Let j 0i designates the vacuum state before the source .x 0/ is switched
on. After the source is eventually switched off, the latter may have created some
particles. This means that if j 0Ci designates the vacuum state after the source is
switched-off, then quantum mechanics says that h 0C j 0i is not necessarily one
or just a phase factor as the system may be in some other state involving some
1 It is important to emphasize, that the source need not vanish abruptly at any point and may be
taken to be continuous at a point where it vanishes (see Problem 3.1).

particles. This amplitude corresponds to the case where we begin with the vacuum
before the source .x 0/ is switched on, and end up with the vacuum after the source
is switched off. Here we have conveniently used the argument x 0 for the source.
We consider the matrix element h0C j  .x/ j 0i, and solve (3.1.1) for the latter.
We will then investigate the meaning of this matrix element later.
By carrying out a 4D Fourier transform of (3.1.1) and inverting, in the process,
the matrix .@=i C m/, we obtain for the matrix element in question

Regarding (3.1.2), we are faced with the interpretation of the pole that may arise
from the vanishing of the denominator . p2 C m2/, whose physical signiﬁcance and
the evaluation of the expression on the right-hand side of (3.1.2) provides the ﬁrst
step for carrying out computations in quantum ﬁeld theory.
The denominator in (3.1.2) may be rewritten as

If x 0 is such that x0 D x0
2 > x 0 0, as shown in Fig. 3.1, for all x 0 0 contributing to
the x 0 0-integral in (3.1.2), that is, if the source is switched off before the time x 0,
we have the physical situation of a causal arrangement (x0 > x 0 0), where energy is
being transferred from the source to the point x2, with the source playing the role of
an emitter. Thus we have to pick up the pole p0 D C E in (3.1.2) corresponding to
an energy gain at the point in question. To do this, we make a transition to a complex
p0-plane. Let Im p0 denote the imaginary part of p 0. For the case considered above,
x0x0 0 	 T > 0, and the real part of .ip 0T/ is given by Re .ip 0T/ D .Im p 0/T

We close the p 0contour c.w. from below the horizontal axis, for which Im p 0 <

no contribution. The latter is as a consequence of the fact that expŒ.Im p 0/T ! 0

the application of the Cauchy Theorem. We note that for any real number a > 0,

that the source is switched on after the time x 0 in question, energy is absorbed by
the source, now acting as a detector, with energy loss from point x1. That is, in this

Accordingly, and quite generally, from (3.1.5), (3.1.6), (3.1.7) one may rewrite
the expression in (3.1.2) in a uniﬁed manner as

Thus the Schwinger-Feynman boundary condition, based on physical grounds,
amounts in replacing the mass m by m  i 
 in the denominator in deﬁning the
propagator. Needless to say for m D 0 the i 
 should survive.
We note that due to the equality

(3.1.18)
where ™. p0/ D 1 for p0 > 0, ™. p0/ D 0 for p0 < 0, and due to the fact that a
Lorentz transformation does not change the sign of p0, we may infer the Lorentz
invariance of the measure on the right-hand side of (3.1.18) as well.
We are now ready to investigate, in the next section, the role of  .x/ as a
quantum ﬁeld and the particle content of the theory.
3.2
The Dirac Quantum Field Concept, Particle Content,
and C, P, T Tansformations
For the interpretation of the role played by the quantum ﬁeld  .x/ for the simple
system described by the Dirac equation, we consider the expression for the matrix
element h 0C j  .x/ j 0i=h 0C j 0i in (3.1.6), that is forx 0 > x 0 0 in reference
to Fig. 3.1, where the source acts as an emitter.
With the functional time dependence of .x 0/ being of compact support in time
explicitly absorbed in .x 0/, we may carry out the x 0-integral in (3.1.6) over all x 0
to obtain
h 0C j  .x/ j 0i

Using the expression for the projection operator in Eq. (I.21) in Appendix I over
spin states, we rewrite (3.2.1) as

h 0C j 0i
D

.2/3 e ip x u.p; / h p  j 0i:
(3.2.3)
where
h p  j 0i 	 Œ i u.p; / . p/ ;
(3.2.4)
and as it will be evident below, and as shown in the next section, h p  j 0i
represents an amplitude that the source, as an emitter, emits a particle of momentum-
spin (p; ) which persists after the source is switched off.
Since we have the vacuum state on the left-hand side of (3.2.3), we reach the
inevitable conclusion that  .x/ has annihilated the particle in question to end up in
the vacuum.
At this stage, it is instructive to introduce the normalization condition of a particle
state,2 as well as of the resolution of the identity of the momenta and spin of such a
particle deﬁned, in turn, by

(3.2.7)
A similar analysis as above dealing with h 0C j  .x/ j 0i in (3.1.16) for the
causal arrangement, now, with x 0 < x 0 0, relative to the source .x 0/, in reference
to Fig. 3.1, leads to the identiﬁcation

with the latter representing an amplitude that the source , as a detector, absorbs a
particle, and ﬁnally obtain
h p  j  .x/ j 0i
h 0C j 0i
D e ip x u.p; /:
(3.2.9)
Thus we reach the inevitable conclusion that  .x/ has created a particle since we
began with the vacuum and ended up having a particle detected by the source.
It remains to consider the situation for h 0C j  .x/ j 0i with x 0 < x 0 0 relative
to .x 0/, and h 0C j  .x/ j 0i with x 0 > x 0 0, relative to .x0/. This will be
done in the next section.
In the remaining part of this section and in view of applications in the following
sections, we consider the Dirac equation in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld A in
the presence of an external source . This is given by

(3.2.10)
with e denoting the charge. We deﬁne it to carry its own sign, i.e., e D jej for an
electron.
In analogy to (3.1.12), we introduce the propagator SA
C.x; x 0/, now in the
presence of an external electromagnetic ﬁeld, satisfying

(3.2.11)
The reason as to why we have written the functional dependence of SA
C as .x; x 0/
rather than .x  x 0/ is that for A.x/ ¤ 0 translational invariance is generally
broken. One may convert (3.2.11) to the following integral equation

.dx 00 / SC.xx 00 / A.x 00 /SA

This is easily veriﬁed by applying the uperator .@=i C m/ to (3.2.12), use (3.1.12)
and ﬁnally integrate over a delta function to see that (3.2.11) is indeed satisﬁed.
The expression for h 0C j  .x/ j 0iA=h 0C j 0iA, now in the presence of the
external electromagnetic ﬁeld A.x/, follows from (3.2.10) and takes the form

with A.x 00/ in (3.2.12) being effective only in the region, x 0 0 < x 00 0 < x 0. In

in (3.2.16) will be proportional to ı. p 0 0  p 0/.
In the causal arrangement discussed above, the quantum ﬁeld  .x/, in a source
free region, destructs the particle after it has scattered off the external ﬁeld A,
with the transition amplitude for the process corresponding to p  ! p 0 0, say,

be taken up in Sect. 3.8.
The structure given in (3.2.16) is interesting as, in particular, it provides us with
the value of the magnetic moment of the charged particle (electron). To this end,
we may use the equation .p C m/u.p; / D 0 (see (I.10)), to write u.p; / D

may deﬁne the charge conjugation of a Dirac quantum ﬁeld by

We have also considered the Dirac equation in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld

Upon comparing this equation with (3.2.16), and taking into account (3.3.6),
(3.3.7), (3.3.8), we may infer that  .x/ annihilates a particle of mass m and charge
 e, i.e., of charge Cjej. For such a particle of momentum p, its energy is given
by p 0 D C
p
p2 C m2, and its wave-function is given in (3.3.7). Also h p  j 0i;
as deﬁned in (3.3.8), represents the amplitude that the source .x/ creates such a
particle. This is the anti-electron, the positron.
As mentioned in the Introductory Chapter of the book, prior to its experimental
discovery of the positron, it was referred to as the donkey electron by George
Gamow because it would move in the opposite direction to that of an electron in
an applied ﬁeld.
It is important to note that v.p; /, corresponding to the positron in its initial
state, is to the left of  , and v.p0;  0/, corresponding to the its ﬁnal state, is on
its right-hand side.
Under space reﬂection, we have from below Eq. (I.18), that

v.p; / ! v.p; / 0 D v	.p; / D  v.p; /;
and hence the electron and positron have opposite intrinsic parities.

Clearly, this was the beginning of the discovery of anti-matter, in general,
thanks to the Dirac equation. It is interesting to remember (see the Introductory
Chapter of the book) that, in one of his talks, Dirac remarked that his equation was
more intelligent than its author.
With the above analysis now carried out, it will be quite evident in the sequel,
that the computations of transition amplitudes of processes in quantum ﬁeld theory
become more manageable.
The amplitudes for detection of a particle/antiparticle and emission of parti-
cle/antiparicle are spelled out below using the sign of the charge " D 
.5 To do
this we obtain, in the process, the expression for the vacuum-to-vacuum transition
amplitude h 0Cj0i for the Dirac equation in the presence of an external source.

We have normalized h 0C j 0i to unity for .x/ D 0, .x/ D 0, i.e., in the
absence of the external source, dispensing with any phase factor, signalling the fact
that the vacuum stays the same and nothing happens in the latter case.

the Dirac ﬁeld, that .x/, .x/ are Grassmann variables.

nI n1; n2; : : :i2, denotes the amplitude that the source 
2 has absorbed (detected)
n particles, and so on.
Upon expanding the exponential of (3.3.35), using in the process (3.3.30), and

Physically, we note that h 0C j 0i corresponds to processes where arbitrary
number of particles are emitted and re-absorbed through the time of operation of
.; /, with no particles (antiparticles) present after the sources cease to operate,
and before they begin to operate. Accordingly, in scattering theory, we deﬁne
amplitudes for emission of a given particle (antiparticle) by a given source, that
escapes this parent source as a free particle, by dividing the corresponding above
expression by h 0C j 0i. Thus one eliminates particles absorbed and then
re-absorbed that do not participate in dynamical scattering process of interest.
Similarly, the amplitude of absorption of a given particle (antiparticle), way after the
particle (antiparticle) emerges, say, from a scattering process, is deﬁned by dividing
the corresponding above expression by h 0C j 0i. Accordingly, we introduce the
amplitudes of either absorption or emission of a particle (antiparticle) by a given

(3.3.42)
where h 0C j p ; i denotes the amplitude that a source  absorbs a particle, thus
playing the role of a detector, and h 0C j p ; Ci, denotes the amplitude that 
also absorbs an antiparticle. Given that h 0C j p ; i denotes the amplitude for the
event just mentioned, i.e., that  absorbs a given particle (electron), the analysis
leading to (3.3.18), shows that h 0C j p ; Ci necessarily represents the amplitude
that  absorbs an antiparticle (the positron). Similarly, h p ; j 0i represents the
amplitude that  emits a particle, and h p ; C j 0i represents the amplitude that
 emits an antiparticle.
It is advisable to keep the factors p2m d!p in the amplitudes in applications
in order not to waste time guessing numerical multiplicative factors in physical
applications.
The moral of the above analysis is this. For a general interacting theory, we
obtain an expression for h 0C j 0i as in (3.3.30), where now the expression
corresponding to W21 may be expanded in powers of the source functions.
Transition amplitudes for arbitrary processes are then extracted, from a unitarity
sum, and are given by the coefﬁcients of these source functions written as
in (3.3.39), (3.3.40), (3.3.41), and (3.3.42), with the sources appropriately arranged
causally to reﬂect the actual process where the particles in question are emitted
and detected by these sources. The procedure will be spelled out in detail in
Sect. 5.8, (5.8.14), (5.8.15), (5.8.16), (5.8.17), (5.8.18), (5.8.19), (5.8.20), and
(5.8.21). Applications of these will be given when considering interacting theories.
See also (3.2.16), (3.2.19), (3.2.26), (3.3.15), (3.4.1) and Problem 3.6 for simple
demonstrations. More involved non-linear theories will be dealt with later.

Spin & Statistics and the Dirac Quantum Field;
Anti-Commutativity Properties Derived
Every student who has ever heard of spin 1/2 is aware that the corresponding ﬁeld
theory should be quantized with anti-commutations relations. This is a special case
of the Spin & Statistics Connection which is the subject matter of Sect. 4.5. As
we will see, this property of Spin 1/2 is already inherited in the Dirac equation
itself, and establishing the underlying statistics of the Dirac quantum ﬁeld is
straightforward and follows by a simple application of the main result obtained in
Sect. 4.5, and it is conveniently treated here at this stage. We work in the Majorana
representation of the gamma matrices (see (2.3.5), (2.3.6)).
One of the most important facts of the Majorana representation is that . =i/ =
. =i/, i.e., the matrices  =i are real. (See Sect. 2.3).

Note the signs on the right-hand sides of these equations. The underlying statistics
would be different if the signs of the last two equalities were reversed. According
to the underlying theory of the Spin & Statistics Connection (Sect. 4.5), these
inherited signs in the Dirac equation imply that the ﬁeld components A satisfy
the following anti-commutation relations for x 0 0 D x 0 :
.Q0/AB fC.x/; B.x 0/g D i ıCA ı3.x  x 0/;
where
Q0 D i I;
(3.5.10)
and, the anti-symmetry property of  0, in particular, implies that  is a Grassmann
variable and anti-commutes with .
From the deﬁnition of  in terms of its components in (3.5.3), these anti-
commutations, in turn, lead to the anti-commutation relations of the Dirac ﬁeld
components for x 0 0 D x 0 :
f a.x/;  	
b.x 0/g D ıab ı3.x  x 0/; f a.x/;  b.x 0/g D 0; f 	
a.x/;  	
b.x 0/g D 0:
(3.5.11)
One may, of course, use Pauli’s Fundamental Theorem (see, e.g., [6]), to infer
that the anti-commutation relations in (3.5.11) are valid in other representations, by
the application of the necessary G matrices as follows:  ! G  G	 (see (2.3.2),
(2.3.4), (I.1)) to the quantum ﬁeld. The Grassmann variable property of  and its
anti-commutativity with , in turn, imply the Grassmann variable property of , ,
and their anti-commutativity with the Dirac ﬁeld and its adjoint.
In the absence of external sources, we may also use the general expression for
 .x/ in Problem 3.8, with the coefﬁcients a.p; /; b	.p; / promoted to quantum
variables, and the ﬁrst anti-commutation relation in (3.5.11) to ﬁnd the following

The purpose of this section is to derive the expression for h 0C j 0iA, for this
system. As will be seen throughout this book, the vacuum persistence amplitude
h 0C j 0iA, contains much useful information and gives rise to the actual solution
of an underlying quantum ﬁeld theoretical problem.
There are several reasons why we consider this system at this stage. It provides a
simple interacting system involving fermions. Also it provides an excellent training
for the direct application of the rules of the Quantum Dynamical Principle developed
in Sect. 4.6, and to appreciate its power in applications and witness the simplicity
of its underlying rules before getting involved in its intricate details. Before spelling
out these rules, as we apply them to the system described by (3.6.6), we introduce
the electromagnetic current of the system.
To the above end, we write the equations for  , and  , in terms of components,
as follows

where j.x/ deﬁnes the electromagnetic and is conserved in the absence of the
external source. In writing (3.6.9), we have used the Grassmann variable property
of , , that the latter anti-commute with the Dirac ﬁeld and its adjoint (Sect. 3.5).
The commutator in the deﬁnition of the current is of signiﬁcance, as under
charge conjugation (see Sect. 3.2), it changes sign, as an electromagnetic current
should. Recall that under charge conjugation, the Dirac quantum ﬁeld transforms as
(see (3.2.29))

as e   with the understanding that it should be deﬁned as a commutator as
given above in (3.6.9) to ensure the correct transformation given in (3.6.11).
We now spell out some basic facts that we will learn in applying the Quantum
Dynamical Principle (Sect. 4.6) to the system described by (3.6.6):

between the two terms on the right-hand side of the equation that arises due to
the Fermi character of the Dirac ﬁeld (Sect. 3.5). The anti-commutativity of Fermi
ﬁelds within a time-ordered product is directly inferred from the Grassmann variable

Obviously the right-hand side of (3.6.22) reduces to the commutator in (3.6.9) in the
just mentioned limit. By initially choosing the arguments of  .x/;  .x 0/ in (3.6.22)
at non-coincident points, however, one destroys gauge invariance as we now discuss.
This, in turn, will allow one to deﬁne a gauge invariant current at the outset.
To ensure the generation of a gauge invariant electromagnetic current, we
proceed as follows. Under a gauge transformation of the electromagnetic potential,
A

7In order to distinguish between an external, i.e., c-number, current and a quantum current, as given
in (3.6.22), we use the notation with small j for the latter, and capital J for the former in this
book.

Schwinger’s point splitting method. The exponential of the line-integral involving
the vector potential is referred to as the Schwinger line-integral.
The point of interest is the matrix element of the current between the vacuum
states in (3.6.14). From (3.6.21), (3.6.23) we may, in a limiting sense, write

To emphasize the dependence of SA
C.x; x 0/ on the combination eA, it is
convenient to use the notation SC.x; x 0I eA/ for the former. With the boundary
condition, h 0C j 0i.e/ D 1; for e D 0, we may use (3.6.14) to integrate over e

applications as to the one given in Sect. 3.8 in pair production by a constant electric

h 0C j0i.e/ in the Presence of a Constant F Field
and Effective Action
An expression for h 0C j 0i.e/ is readily obtained for the Dirac equation in the
presence of a classical constant F Field, or effectively constant over sufﬁciently
extended regions of spacetime. An interesting application of this is that the quantum
nature of the fermion ﬁeld adopted here leads to a modiﬁcation of the Maxwell
Lagrangian density giving rise to an effective one involving higher powers of the
Faraday tensor F and of its dual to be deﬁned shortly. This will be the subject
matter of this section. Another interesting application is that it provides an explicit
expression for the decay of the system initially in the vacuum state leading to eCe
pair creation by a constant electric ﬁeld. This will be developed in the next section.

Pair Creation by a Constant Electric Field
The vacuum-to-vacuumtransition amplitude h 0C j 0i.e/, for the system described
by the Dirac equation in the presence of a constant F ﬁeld was derived in the
previous section in (3.7.30), (3.7.31). The probability that the vacuum stays the
same in the presence of this external ﬁeld is jh 0C j 0i.e/j2. It reads
jh 0C j 0i.e/j2 D e  2 ImW.e/;

and W.e/ given in (3.7.31).

We may deﬁne the decay rate  of the vacuum, that is the probability of decay
of the vacuum per unit time by
 D 2 ImW.e/
T
(3.8.2)
due to the intervening F ﬁeld. A decay of the vacuum, means that the system,
initially in the vacuum state, emerges eventually to some other state, and is
accompanied by particle production. Here T, in a limiting sense T ! 1, denotes
the time of operation of the electric ﬁeld. Since this is a charge conserving process,
eCe pairs may be created by the electric ﬁeld. More precisely, we determine the
decay rate per unit volume  =V, where V, in a limiting sense V ! 1, denotes
the volume of space where the electric ﬁeld operates. Accordingly, the physical
quantity of interest is

V D 2 ImW.e/

per unit time, for pair production.

Fermions and Anomalies in Field Theory: Abelian Case
A classical symmetry does not necessarily hold true quantum mechanically. This is
well illustrated by considering the divergence of the so-called axial vector current
deﬁned by
j5.x/ D
1
2Œ a.x/; . 5 /a.x/. This symmetry breaking is due to
the fact that the fermions give rise to closed loops, represented by the trace of
products of Dirac propagators, referred to as radiative corrections, which are absent
classically.
We will learn, in particular, that for a massless fermion that although classically
the current j5.x/ is conserved, i.e., @j5.x/ D 0, quantum mechanically it is not
@j5.x/ ¤ 0, and the right-hand of the latter equation is referred to as an anomaly.
What is most interesting is that although the current j5.x/ leads to divergent
integrals, its derivatives gives rise to a ﬁnite expression for anomaly. Moreover, we
will see that the presence of the anomaly, a purely quantum mechanical effect, may
be tested experimentally.We ﬁrst derive the explicit expression of the just mentioned
anomaly and then show how the anomaly is tested experimentally.

that f.p/ ! 1=,   4, for  ! 1, R .dp/ @f. p/=@p D 0 by Gauss’
Theorem, since the surface area grows like 3. The equality in (3.9.17) is used as
follows. One integrates by parts over p by transferring i@=@p to the last line
in (3.9.16) involving the trace of products of Dirac propagators.
We multiply (3.9.16) by 
, as indicated in (3.9.10), integrate over p by parts
by using, in the process, (3.9.17), to conclude from Gauss’ Theorem that no
contribution to (3.9.10) arises for N  4, for 
 ! 0, since S.p/ D O.1/. On
the other hand, no contribution arises for N D 3, in the limit 
 ! 0. This is as a
consequence of a net minus sign (.1/N1) that results in the middle within the
square brackets, on the right-hand side of (3.9.17) in the process of integrating by
parts. For two powers of

’s introduces one additional power of p in
the denominator of p - integral. Hence the term with N D 3 does not contribute.
The very ﬁrst term in (3.9.16) does not contribute for the simple reason that
TrŒ  5 S. p/
D 0. For all those terms where Gauss’ Theorem leads to no
contribution to the anomaly, one does not have to set m D 0 in their initial
expressions. Clearly only the N D 2 term contributes.

which is (3.9.4) in the vector space of fermions and anti-fermions. The non-zero
expression on the right-hand side of the above equation is referred to as an anomaly.
It corresponds to the so-called abelian case where the gauge transformation of the
Dirac ﬁeld, as discussed below (3.6.22), is implemented by a phase transformation
 .x/ ! U.x/ .x/; with U.x/ D exp Œ i .x/ ;
Œ U.x/; U.x 0/ D 0;
(3.9.24)
i.e., with commuting group elements. The underlying symmetry group of such
phase transformations is referred to as the U.1/ group. In the next section, we
encounter more generalized groups of gauge transformations, with non-commuting
group elements, referred to as non-abelian.
The equation of anomaly in (3.9.23) appeared in an early classic paper of
Schwinger [7, Eqs.(5.24), (3.30)]. Important work on anomalies was also carried
out later in the late sixties in Adler [1], Bell and Jackiw [3], Jackiw and Johnson [5],
and Adler and Bardeen [2].
The additional factor involving the line integral in deﬁning gauge invariant
currents, systematically used above, was introduced by Schwinger [8, 9], and, as
mentioned earlier, is referred to as the Schwinger line-integral.

.  5;  ; /, respectively, in the sum, and the anomaly in (3.9.23) is referred
as an abelian triangle anomaly.
3.9.2
Experimental Veriﬁcation of the Anomaly: 0 !  
Decay
An experimental veriﬁcation of the anomaly as given in (3.9.23) may be carried out
by considering the decay of the neutral pion to two photons: 0 !  .
To the above end, we present a simple description by replacing  5 in the
axial-vector above by  5a=2, carrying SU.2/ isospin, where 1; 2; 3 are
the Pauli matrices, and replace  in the vector current by Q, that matches the

(3.9.27)
Since now the matrix, a=2 in each of the two terms in the integrand in (3.9.25)
appears once, while the charge matrix Q appears twice, the anomaly associated
with the divergence of the isotopic axial current @j5a becomes simply replaced

Hence only the third component develops an anomaly, which is what is needed to

the indistinguishability of the two photons thus introducing a multiplicative factor

Using the fact that the quantum ﬁeld @J53 is a pseudo-scalar ﬁeld like the
neutral pion ﬁeld 3 itself, the ﬁeld @j53 may be considered a source term to the

It is quite interesting that a singular behavior, i.e., of divergence, of the axial
vector current, leads to a ﬁnite non-zero result (an anomaly) which can be veriﬁed
experimentally. This is an example of a good anomaly.17

Fermions and Anomalies in Field Theory:
Non-Abelian Case
We generalize the equation of anomaly derived in the last section to the so-called
non-abelian case to be deﬁned shortly. Non-abelian gauge ﬁelds will be introduced
and discussed in detail in Sect. 6.1 and in other sections following it. Here we
introduce only the very basics to see how the equation of anomaly just mentioned is
generalized to the non-abelian case.18 As before, the result embodied in this section
shows that a classical symmetry does not necessarily hold in the quantum world.
We consider several Dirac ﬁelds  D . 1.x/; : : : ;  n.x//, satisfying Dirac
equations,

general, have a matrix structure as well. We consider a general transformation, by a
16The value of this constant may be inferred from the decay rate 0 !   [4].
17There are good anomalies and bad anomalies. An example of a bad anomaly is one which would
destroy renormalizability. For example this would happen in non-abelian gauge theories if quarks,
in general, come in other than three colors (see Sects. 6.4 and 6.15).
18Some readers may wish to read Sect. 6.1 simultaneously with the present one. In the present
section we supply, however, enough details for the reader to be able to follow it.

set of matrices, assumed to have the following properties
A.x/ D ta Aa.x/;
Œ ta; tb  D i fabctc;
(3.10.4)
where the fabc are called the structure constants of the group of transformations,
and are totally anti-symmetric in their indices. If the structure constants are zero
the group of transformations is referred to as abelian, otherwise it is called non-
abelian. Non-abelian gauge groups will be studied in detail in Chap. 6. In order not
to confuse the indices just introduced with spinor indices we suppress the latter ones
in this section.
We may pose to consider a concrete case. For example, the group SU(3), consists
of 3  3 unitary matrices of determinant one. Here U in SU.3/ stands for unitary,
n D 3 for the size of the matrices, and S for special, i.e., of determinant one.
In quantum chromodynamics,  corresponds to a quark ﬁeld with three different
colors speciﬁed by ﬁelds  1;  2;  3. The Dirac ﬁeld will also carry another index
to specify the different ﬂavors of quarks which we will also suppress here. The
mass m will carry a ﬂavor index. The index a introduced above in Aa.x/ would
take 8 values corresponding to eight gluons.
The matrices U.x/ will be expressed as
U.x/ D exp Œ i g ta #a.x/ :
(3.10.5)

holding in the vector space of fermions and anti-fermions.
Note that this anomaly is the same as the abelian one in (3.9.23) with FF
replaced by Tr .G G/, and e by g.
The gauge transformation of A.x/ in (3.10.3), implies, in turn, the gauge
transformation of G.x/ in (3.10.14) to be (see Problem 3.14)
G.x/ ! U.x/ G.x/ U1.x/:
(3.10.27)
Hence Tr .GG/ is gauge invariant, and so is the equation of anomaly
in (3.10.26).
The above analysis of the anomaly will be crucial later on in Chap. 6 for the
renormalizability of the standard model. The key point to realize about this at this
point is that the standard model involves axial vector currents, and renormalizability
of the model hinges on the assumption of the absence of such anomalies.

We may thus invoke Gauss’ Theorem to infer that the remainder in (A-3.2)
integrates out to zero. A similar analysis applies for the case when the integral is

We here deﬁne the degree of divergence of a 4D-integral as the power of p in the

the degree of divergence of the integral in (A-3.8) restricted to the .2Q2  16m2/

Chapter 4
Fundamental Aspects of Quantum Field Theory
At sufﬁciently high energies, relativity becomes the indispensable language to do
physics and explain the exchange that takes place between energy and matter
allowing the creation of an unlimited number of particles such that the number
of particles need not be conserved. An appropriate description of such physical
processes for which a variable number of particles may be created or destroyed
is provided by the concept of a quantum ﬁeld which we denote, generally, by .x/
as a function of a spacetime variable x D .x 0; x/, for which the Dirac quantum ﬁeld
theory, as described in Chap. 3, is one example.
As the disturbance created by a measurement process cannot propagate faster
than the speed of light, different regions of space, at any given ﬁxed time, are
dynamically independent in the sense that a measurement made in any region of
space is incompatible with any other in a different region. Space, at any given
time, deﬁnes a special case of a space-like (hyper-) surface with the latter deﬁned
in such a manner that any two points x1, x 2 lying on it are space-like separated
.x1 x2/2 > 0, and hence cannot be connected by any signal. The quantum ﬁelds as
dynamical variables, providing degrees of freedom of a system, are thus labeled, by
inﬁnitesimal three dimensional regions of space, with the latter being independent
in the sense just described, or in a local description they are labeled by the space
coordinate points x. At any given time x 0 D t, the space variable x together with
any indices a that independent ﬁelds may carry, such as spinor and/or vector indices,
specify the inﬁnite (uncountable) degrees of freedom as x is made to vary in space
as well as the indices a take on their speciﬁc values. Upon writing a.x/ D x a.t/,
we note that .xa/ replaces the index i in the dynamical variables qi.t/, in well known
situations, dealing with ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom.
Independent dynamical variables a.x/ thus satisfy locality conditions, and for
the elementary ﬁelds, for examples, consisting of a (non-Hermitian) scalar '.x/,
and the Dirac ﬁeld  .x/, are speciﬁed by a commutation relation Œ '.x/; '	.x 0/  D
0 for the scalar ﬁeld (Sects. 4.5 and 4.7), and by anti-commutation relations

separated points x, x 0.
The signiﬁcant physical role that a quantum ﬁeld .x/ acquires and the particle
content of a theory emerges from the examination of the commutation relations
of the ﬁeld with the energy-momentum operator components P (Sect. 4.1) corre-
sponding to the underlying physical system.
The ﬁeld concept, its signiﬁcance and the meaning of wavefunction renormaliza-
tions are introduced in Sect. 4.1. The underlying algebra satisﬁed by the generators
of the inhomogeneous Lorentz transformations (Poincaré algebgra) is worked out
in Sect. 4.2. The action principle of quantum ﬁelds, together with its related
consequences, is the subject matter of Sect. 4.3. The principle of stationary action
encapsulates the dynamics of a system as the system develops between two space-
like surfaces. The principle of stationary action, together with generators emerging
from variations of these space-like boundary surfaces, summarize basic properties of
an underlying theory. The mere fact that generators are to be introduced to generate
ﬁeld variations lead automatically to ﬁeld equations – the so-called Euler-Lagrange
equations. These ﬁeld equations emerging from the theory, involve dynamical
variables, as functions of time (and space), and describe the time evolution of theory.
Section 4.4 deals with Lorentz invariance and the energy-momentum tensor, as well
as the angular momentum density, providing, in particular, of a local description
of the energy-momentum distribution of matter in space. The celebrated Spin
and Statistics connection is studied in Sect. 4.5. The quantum dynamical principle
(QDP) of quantum ﬁeld theory is treated in Sect. 4.6 from which physical processes
may be investigated.
A functional Fourier transform of expressions directly obtained from the QDP
leads directly to the equivalent path integral formalism which is applied to gauge
theories in subsequent chapters. The basic ﬁelds one encounters in ﬁeld theory
are covered in Sect. 4.7, with further applications of the QDP, involving some
of these ﬁelds, in Sect. 4.8. Some intricacies with Lagrangians are spelled out in
Sect. 4.9. Section 4.10 deals with the celebrated CPT Theorem, where, in particular,
we will see that particle/antiparticle detectors and antiparticle/particle emitters are
interchanged in a CPT “transformed” world.
One of the major difﬁculties in quantum ﬁeld theory, is that not all components
of the underlying theories are necessarily dynamically independent. This requires
special attention to be given to them in carrying out a dynamical description of
the theories. All of our present fundamental ﬁeld theories are gauge theories, and
involve such ﬁelds.
In remaining chapters we establish the connection between the fundamental the-
ory developed here and the various interactions observed in nature. As emphasized
in the introductory chapter to the book, a major theme of modern quantum ﬁeld
theory is to provide a uniﬁed description of nature. This calls for a look at the
various approaches and contributions to the subject that appeared in the literature

4.1
The Field Concept, Particle Aspect and Wavefunction
Renormalization
The signiﬁcant role that a quantum ﬁeld .x/ plays emerges from the examination
of its commutation with the energy-momentum operator P, corresponding to
the underlying physical system, and by considering, in particular, the vacuum
state jvaci assumed to be an eigenstate of P of zero energy and momentum
P jvaci D 0. As will be seen in the next section, the different components P
commute. The latter components consist of generators of spacetime translations,
and they imply that
.x/ D ei xP.0/ ei xP:
(4.1.1)
The latter leads to the equation

Let jp 0; i denote an eigenstate of the components P. That is, P jp 0; i D p 0 j
p 0; i, where  stands for other labels needed to specify a state jp 0; i. By working
conveniently in terms of the bra hp 0;  j, and by rewriting (4.1.4) as . p/ P D
P . p/ C p . p/, we obtain
h p 0;  j . p/ P D . p 0  C p / h p 0;  j . p/:
(4.1.5)
That is, for p0 ? 0, . p/ injects/absorps a quantity of energy jp0j. The idea
that one learns in elementary treatments of (free) ﬁeld theory that a ﬁeld may be
expanded in terms of creation and annihilation operators comes from this relation.
The situation we are now in is far more complex, in general, and the physical

interpretation of .x/ in terms of creation and annihilation of just single isolated
free particles (anti-particle) becomes incomplete.
In general, the ﬁeld .x/ satisﬁes coupled non-linear equations which in turn may
lead to non-trivial reactions on the ﬁeld leading to the creation of multi-particles of
unlimited number altering the initial expected excitation that the ﬁeld may provide
by a mere examination of the free ﬁeld theory counterpart. One may even encounter
an extreme case that the particle expected to be created by the ﬁeld is altogether
absent. That is, the creation of the particle occurs with zero probability in the
standard quantum mechanical language. All of this is best described by examining
the effect of a ﬁeld .x/ on h vac j in the light of the spectrum of the energy-
momentum operator P.
The spectral representation of the energy-momentum operator P, expressed
through a unitary operator, is given by

(4.1.12)
and where U.p; / eipx denotes the wavefunction of the particle in question, and
 0. p/ is a projection operator on the remaining spectrum of the energy-momentum
of the system under study.
In the presence of multi-particle states, described by the second integral
in (4.1.11), quantum mechanics implies the presence of a coefﬁcient
p
Z in the
expansion (4.1.11), to describe a particle just described, with Z as the probability of
the creation of the particle in question by the ﬁeld .x/ out of the vacuum.
Situations may arise that a single isolated particle cannot be described, or that
the underlying theory predicts only composite particles, in which cases the ﬁrst
term in (4.1.11) will be altogether absent. On the other hand, when dealing with a
scalar particle .x/ for which no symmetry arguments may be applied to dismiss
its vacuum expectation value hvac j .0/ j vaci, then an additional term of the
form hvacj .0/ j vacihvacj will appear on the right-hand of (4.1.11). Such a non-
vanishing vacuum expectation value of a scalar ﬁeld is what happens in describing
the Higgs mechanism.
In studying a physical process and confronting theory with experiments, one
may ask the question: given that a certain particle was observed, that is, this event
happened with probability one, then what is the probability that it has emerged,
say, with a speciﬁc momentum and a given spin projection?. In the language of
probability theory, the underlying probability in such a question is referred to as a
conditional probability:
given that something happened, i.e., with probability
one, then what is the probability that the system
under consideration has some given characteristics?
In technical terms, this amounts to divide the ﬁeld .x/ by
p
Z, leading to the
deﬁnition of the ﬁeld
ren.x/ D .x/=
p
Z;
(4.1.13)
thus isolating the particle in question with probability one, i.e., with certainty,
bringing the observed particle in evidence.
The process just described is called a wavefunction renormalization, which is
done independently of any perturbation theory, and Z is referred to as a wavefunction
renormalization constant. The scaled ﬁeld ren.x/ is the so-called renormalized ﬁeld.
Let us go one step further to see how a wavefunction renormalization is carried
out when one actually computes transition amplitudes. We will even generalize
the above further, by bringing the treatment closer to an experimental set-up,
where one would ask the question as to what is the amplitude that the particle is
actually observed, i.e., detected?. The analysis, in turn, shows the role played by a
ﬁeld in computing transition amplitudes. As we are already familiar with the spin

1/2 propagator derived in Sect. 3.1, we consider for deﬁniteness the ﬁeld .x/ to
correspond to a Dirac ﬁeld  .x/ in a general interacting ﬁeld theory.
To the above end, let O.x1; : : : ; xn/ j vaci denote the product of n arbitrary
operators of spacetime arguments x1; : : : ; xn acting on the vacuum state j vaci, and
consider the vacuum-expectation of the time-ordered product:
hvacj

 .x/O.x1; : : : ; xn/

C jvaci;
(4.1.14)
in which the operators are arranged from right to left in order of increasing time
argument with a minus sign inserted for each permutation of Fermi-Dirac ﬁelds
(Sect. 3.5). Here  .x/ is the quantum ﬁeld in question under investigation. We
emphasize that this matrix element is computed in a theory involving no external
sources coupled to the ﬁelds such as ;  given in Chap.3.
Now we multiply the above vacuum expectation value by a Fermi source .x/
(Sect. 3.1) from the left and integrate over x to obtain
Z
.dx/ .x/hvacj

 .x/O.x1; : : : ; xn/

C jvaci:
(4.1.15)
By doing this, we will concentrate on the particle in question associated with the
ﬁeld  .x/. A similar process may be carried out for the particles associated with the
other ﬁelds in the time-ordered product by multiplying (4.1.14) by corresponding
source functions. We recall that the ﬁeld  .x/, in particular, is expected to satisfy a
non-linear equation. Let SC.x  x 0/ denote the free spin 1/2 propagator derived in
Sect. 3.1. We use the property
Z
.dx 0/ SC.x  x 0/ S 1
C .x 0  x 00/ D ı.4/.x  x 00/;
(4.1.16)
where S 1
C .x 0  x 00/ is the inverse of the propagator. Consider the source .x/ to
be switched on, i.e., operate, at large positive x 0 values, thus one may “follow” the
particle for a sufﬁcient long time to be able to measure its energy, momentum and
other attributes. For all x 0 > x0 0, at which times the source .x/ operates, it is easily
derived that

One may readily continue this process as applied to the other ﬁelds in the time
ordered product in (4.1.14) by multiplying the latter by corresponding sources and
noting that for sources switched on and operating at large positive times, one is
dealing with particles outgoing from a process, while sources operating only at large
negative times, one is dealing with ingoing particles in a process. The keen reader
will realize that we have essentially obtained a formalism for computing transition
amplitudes in ﬁeld theory. This will be taken up later, dealing with the vacuum-to-
vacuum transition amplitudes for various interactions, and speciﬁc applications will
be carried out.
The expression in (4.1.19) brings us into contact with a formalism, referred to as
the LSZ formalism,2 except that we have now an additional piece of physics dealing
with the detection (emission) of particles expressed by the ﬁrst line in (4.1.19)
depending on the source function . p/. From (3.2.8), we recognize the term
Œi . p/ u.p; / as an amplitude for detection, i.e., of the actual observation of the
particle in question. Having scaled the ﬁeld in (4.1.13) to deﬁne the renormalized
ﬁeld  ren.x/, we now have to deﬁne the renormalized source function ren.x/ D
p
Z .x/ as well for the physical interpretation of the latter corresponding to an
amplitude of particle detection. When one adds source terms to a Lagrangian
density such as .x/ .x/, corresponding, in particular, to the ﬁeld  .x/, one has
the invariance property .x/ .x/ D ren.x/ ren.x/.
Introduction of sources coupled to the ﬁelds facilitates tremendously doing ﬁeld
theory. In practice, the transition amplitudes for particles (anti-particles) ingoing
and outgoing in a process is obtained from the coefﬁcient of the source terms in
expressions like in (4.1.19) (see, e.g., Sects. 5.8 and 5.9).

PoincarKe Algebra and Particle States
PoincarKe (inhomogeneous Lorentz) transformations in Minkowski spacetime were
given in (2.2.7), Sect. 2.2. Such a transformation being connected to the identity
one, induces, according to Wigner’s Theorem (Sect. 2.1), a unitary operator to
act on particle states and quantum ﬁelds. To ﬁnd the algebra satisﬁed by the

emphasizing the reversal of the transformations in the third and the fourth segments

and (2.2.22).
The inﬁnitesimal coordinate changes •x associated with such transformations
may be spelled out as

(4.2.5)

corresponds to the vacuum state. Consider ﬁrst massive particles.
I m ¤ 0:
Since W  W  is an invariant, it may be computed in any Lorentz frame. For a
massive particle, we may consider its rest frame for which P  D .m; 0; 0; 0; 0/.
From (4.2.16), then
W  W  D m2 J2:
(4.2.18)
In the rest frame of such a particle, (4.2.10) leads to the usual commutation
relations of angular momentum components

(4.2.19)
and
W  W  D m2 j. j C 1/;
(4.2.20)
since W i becomes simply m J i and W 0 reduces to zero.
Consider the eigenvalue problem
P h p j D p h p j;
(4.2.21)
where particle labels denoting other degrees of freedom are initially suppressed. In
particular, in the rest frame of the particle, we have from (4.2.9)
ŒP 0; J i h p j D 0:
(4.2.22)
Accordingly, from (4.2.18), (4.2.19), (4.2.20), (4.2.21) and (4.2.22), we may
label a massive particle state, in the rest frame of the particle, by its mass m, and
the spin j, involving .2j C 1/ components. We will simply use the notation h 0 j
for these states, with 0 corresponding to the momentum of the particle at rest, and
 corresponding to the values j. All other labels necessary to specify such a state
will be suppressed.
To ﬁnd particle states for arbitrary momenta, we proceed as follows. Consider
the state

We will apply the operators P and W 0 to the state in (4.2.23). To this end, note
that the vector operator

satisﬁes the equation

Fig. 4.1 Rotation of a vector initially along the 3-axis c.w. by an angle  about the unit vector n
lying in the 1–2 plane
Here we note that a rotation of vector p, initially along the 3-axis, by an angle ,
about the unit vector n in (4.2.24), gives the vector in (4.2.33) (Fig. 4.1).
A similar analysis4 shows that W0 applied to the state in (4.2.23) gives

D m  sinh ˛ h 0  j exp Œ i ˛ J 03  exp Œ i  n  J :
(4.2.34)
Accordingly, up to a normalization factor, we denote the states in (4.2.23) by
h p  j, providing an orthogonal basis of vectors of single-particle states. The
orthogonality property follows from the facts that

(4.2.35)
From (4.2.24), sinh ˛ D jpj=m, hence the ﬁrst equality in (4.2.35) shows that
sinh ˛ D sinh ˛0. The two equalities in (4.2.35) together then imply that hp00 jp i
is proportional to ı3.p  p 0/ ı0. Apart from the labels m and j, i.e., of , due
to the invariance of P  P  and W  W , and other labels, we will not dwell upon
such additional labels here.

Consider an eigenvalue problem as in (4.2.21). In the massless case, we may

(4.2.40)
In the above, we have suppressed other labels in the states h k j.
Upon comparison of the set of commutation relations in (4.2.40) with (4.2.8),
(4.2.9), we learn that they correspond to translations in the 1–2 plane, via generators
T1; T2, and rotations about the 3 - axis, via the generator J 3. T1 and T 2 have
continuous unbounded spectra. Incidentally, .T1/2 C .T 2/2 D .W W/=!2, with
! > 0, is an invariant of the underlying group, with seemingly a continuous non-
negative spectrum. Unlike the energy and momentum of a particle, which possess
continuous spectra, there are no physical states with such spectra of ‘continuous’
spins. This leaves room only for the cases that T ih k j

corresponding to W W D 0.
The interesting thing to note is that according to (4.2.15), we now have two
orthogonal light-like vectors:
WP D 0;
W W D 0;
PP D 0;
p 0 > 0;
(4.2.41)
which means that W, P are proportional to each other,6 i.e.,
W D  P:
(4.2.42)
In particular, this equation applied to W0 in (4.2.16) gives  P 0
D P  J.
That is, , referred to as the helicity, is determined from the component of spin
along the momentum. Since W is a (pseudo-) vector and P is a vector,  is a
(pseudo-) scalar. On account of (4.2.12),(4.2.14) and (4.2.42),  commutes with the
generators P, J of the PoincarKe group, hence it is an invariant and the physical
states may be labeled by .
The invariance property of the helicity means that Nature would exhibit only
a unique value for the helicity of a given massless particle. On the other hand, if
parity is conserved for the interaction of a system under consideration, then this
pseudo-scalar can also take the value  . Such a property is shared by photons

We may label the initial states considered above as h k  j . To ﬁnd the states for

With ! D jpj, it is evident that, up to a normalization factor,
h p j D h k j exp Œ in  J ;

Before closing this section, we note that due to the rotational invariance of the
scalar product P  J, i.e., Œ P  J; J i;  D 0, a rotation induced on a state in (4.2.43)
about the momentum by an angle #, leads to

Principle of Stationary Action of Quantum Field Theory:
The Rationale Of
This section is involved in considering general variations, to be speciﬁed below, of
transformation functions h  2 j 1 i, associated with dynamical systems, between
two space-like surfaces 1;  2. This brings us into the realm of a fundamental
theory referred to as the “Principle of Stationary Action”.
The Principle of Stationary Action provides the basic tool for deriving ﬁeld
equations. The latter ﬁeld equations emerge from the variation of the action under
the variations of the dynamical variables within speciﬁed boundaries. Variations
of dynamical variables call for generators to implement the corresponding trans-
formations. By introducing, in turn, such generators, the stationary aspect of the
action under dynamical ﬁeld variations directly follows giving automatically the
ﬁeld equations – the so-called Euler-Lagrange equations. Understanding this step
should be comforting to the student who would, otherwise, blindly write down

the Euler-Lagrange equations. Equally important, is that the concept of the action
and of a Lagrangian density arise as a consequence of studying variations of
transformation functions describing the evolution of a dynamical system in time,
and hence are of physical interest. The principle also provides the way of expressing
various generators in terms of the variables underlying the Lagrangian density and
deals with conservation laws as well. Dynamics, beyond the ﬁeld equations, such
as providing a method for obtaining expressions for transition amplitudes, is the
subject of Sect. 4.6 under the heading of the Quantum Dynamical Principle. The
celebrated Spin and Statistics Connection is treated in Sect. 4.5.
A state deﬁned on a space-like surface  will be denoted by h  j, and labels
needed to specify such a state will, in general, be suppressed. Since there is always
a coordinate system for which such a space-like surface is the space itself, at a given
time, i.e., represented by a surface x 0 D t ﬁxed, we may equally consider a state
denoted by h t j . We are interested in changes that may occur in transformation
functions h t2 jt1i corresponding, in general, to different values of quantum numbers
associated with an evolving system at the different times t1 and t2, under some
basic transformations.
Under an inﬁnitesimal transformation via a unitary operator U D 1Ci G, where
G deﬁnes the generator for such a transformation, an operator O changes to O 0 D
U	 O U and with the change deﬁned by
•O D O  O 0;
(4.3.1)
we have
•O D 1
i Œ O; G :
(4.3.2)
Hence for a wavefunction  , equivalence of the “primed” and “unprimed”
depictions, implies that •h  jO j  i D h  jO j  i  h  0 jO 0j  0i D 0, and
with j  0i D U	 j  i gives j  i j  0i D •j i D i G j  i. The invariance
of the scalar product h 0 j  0i D h j UU	 i D h j  i, and the resolution of
the identity 1 D P j aiha jD P U j aiha j U	, for bases vectors j ai, imply that
•ha jD ha j ha j U	 is given by
•h a j D i h a jG:
(4.3.3)
We consider two types of changes of the transformation functions h t2 j t1 i:
(i) One type is in response to, a priori, imposed variations of the underlying
dynamical variables of the theory at all times t1  t  t2, by keeping t1
and t2 ﬁxed. In such cases, we will use the notation • .x/, as applied to the
ﬁelds, for the variation that one may, a priori, impose on a ﬁeld with a bar
under •. Here the variations • .x/ are chosen at will and may be chosen to
be numericals for unambiguous analyses, up to the statistics obeyed by the
ﬁelds .x/ and otherwise arbitrarily. Non-numerical changes of the ﬁelds will
be discussed later.

Fundamental Aspects of Quantum Field Theory
(ii) A second type corresponds to variations of just the boundaries, i.e., of the
surfaces x 0 D t1 and x 0 D t2 in response to a given transformation, taking
into account of the induced variations that arise on the underlying dynamical
variables themselves from such a transformation on the boundaries. For such
induced variations on the ﬁelds, we will simply use the notation •.x/ to
distinguish them from ones one may, a priori impose on them.
The ﬁrst type of variations and its consequence are considered in Sects. 4.3.1,
4.3.2, and 4.3.3, while the second type is considered in Sect. 4.3.4.
4.3.1
A Priori Imposed Variations of Dynamical Variables and
Generators of Field Variations: Field Equations
We here consider variations of the ﬁelds a.x/, at any given time t in t1  t  t2,
with the space-like surfaces x 0 D t1 and x 0 D t2, kept ﬁxed. Let x a.t/ 	 a.x/
denote the dynamical variables. This is an extension of a theory involving dynamical
variables of a countable degrees of freedom qi.t/, to a theory involving an inﬁnite
uncountable ones, with .x a/ now replacing the index i, as discussed earlier in the
introduction to this chapter.
An inﬁnitesimal variation of a dynamical variable calls for a generator to
carry out such a variation. We recall that in quantum mechanics, an inﬁnitesimal
coordinate translation •x i is carried out via a generator written as P i •x i, where
•x i are numerical constants that commute with the operator P i, and the latter
is then identiﬁed with the momentum operator. By extending, in the process, the
generator for the countable number of degrees of freedom case P
i pi.t/•qi.t/, to an
inﬁnite uncountable ones, the generator for inﬁnitesimal variations, at a given time
t, may be expressed as
G.t/ D
Z
d3x  a.x/ • a.x/;
x 0 D t:
(4.3.4)
In reference to the ﬁrst type of variation with time ﬁxed, we denote the changes
of the dynamical variables by •  a.x/. The operators  a.x/ are identiﬁed as
the canonical conjugate momenta of the ﬁelds a.x/ and are to be determined.
Following Schwinger, the variations • a.x/ are taken as numericals. Non-numerical
changes will be discussed later. The adjoints of the ﬁelds, as obtained from the ﬁelds
themselves, will be suppressed for simplicity.
For the time derivative of (4.3.4), evaluated at any given time t: t1  t  t2, we

The integrand in (4.3.5) may be expressed in terms of the total inﬁnitesimal
variation •H of the Hamiltonian, at any given time, as follows. The latter, as a
functional of a.x/ and a.x/, is given by

At this stage the concept of a Lagrangian density arises. Upon identifying the

we obtain

space-like surfaces x 0 D t1, x 0 D t2.

Fundamental Aspects of Quantum Field Theory
From the last equality in (4.3.12), we may infer that:
Only the variations of the ﬁelds on the boundaries x 0 D t1; x 0 D t2
in
the Lagrangian density may contribute to • h t2 j t1i, as spelled out by the two
surface terms in ŒG1.t2/  G1.t1/, and variations of the ﬁelds in • L
within
the boundaries do not contribute. The latter variations lead to the Euler-Lagrange
equations.
How do we isolate these two different parts in • L ? To do this, suppose that the
Lagrangian density L .x/ depends on a.x/ and, on the ﬁrst derivative @a.x/.
Accordingly, quite generally, we may write
• L .x/ D Fa.x/ • a.x/ C Fa.x/ • .@a.x//
D ŒFa.x/  @Fa.x/ • a.x/ C @

(4.3.13)
thus separating the two contributions mentioned above, and the variations within the
boundaries x 0 D t1 x 0 D t2, do not contribute, i.e., for arbitrary • a.x/
Œ Fa.x/  @Fa.x/  D 0;
t1 < x 0 < t2:
(4.3.14)
These are the celebrated Euler-Lagrange Equations. On the other hand (4.3.13) also
gives from (4.3.12)

The above analysis, in turn, introduces the action integral

(4.3.19)
a functional of the ﬁelds a.x/, as an integral over spacetime bounded by space-

depend on a.x/ and on the derivatives @a.x/. It may be rewritten as
L .x/ D L Œ a.x/; @a.x/:
(4.3.20)
The indices a may stand for different types of ﬁelds and for any vector and/or spinor
indices they may carry. The Lagrangian density is assumed to be written as the sum
of products of the ﬁelds and their ﬁrst derivatives.
To determine F a.x/ and F a.x/, we proceed as follows. The variation of the
action •AŒa, with ﬁxed space-like surfaces x 0 D t1, x 0 D t2, in response to the
variation of the Lagrangian density •L .x/ is given by by
•AŒa D
Z x 0 D t2

(4.3.22)
arising solely from arbitrary variations • a.x/ that one may a priori impose on the

to distinguish these variations from ones that are induced on the ﬁelds by other
given transformations such as by the rotation of a coordinate system or by a Lorentz
transformation.
According to the Spin & Statistics Connection, investigated in Sect. 4.5, once
the nature of a ﬁeld has been established as being a Bose-Einstein or a Fermi-
Dirac one, we consider inﬁnitesimal numerical, now, c-number or Grassmann,
variations • a.x/, respectively, as the case may be, such that a variation commutes
with all the ﬁelds and their derivatives, if the corresponding ﬁeld  a is a Bose-
Einstein one, or anti-commutes with all the Fermi-Dirac ﬁelds and their derivatives,
and also commutes with all the Bose-Einstein ﬁelds and their derivatives, if the
corresponding ﬁeld a is a Fermi-Dirac one.

n, m denote the number of Fermi-Dirac ﬁelds to the right of • a.x/, @ • b.x/,
respectively. Each term contains an even number of fermion ﬁelds to satisfy the
Bose character of a Lagrangian density. Therefore, if the number of fermion ﬁelds
to the right of a fermion ﬁeld is odd, then the number of fermion ﬁelds to its left
must be even and so on.
It becomes clear that we obtain the same expression for •L .x/ in (4.3.13),
(4.3.22), as the one that emerges from applying (4.3.23), (4.3.24) to all the terms
in •L .x/, if we use instead the following alternative formal procedure.
We introduce partial derivatives @=@ a.x/, @=@.@ a.x// to operate on the
ﬁelds and their ﬁrst derivatives, respectively, applied both from the right of the
Lagrangian density in conformity with the identities in (4.3.23), (4.3.24), and both
obeying the same commutativity or anti-commutativity with the ﬁelds as •  a.x/.

Using the Bose character of a Lagrangian density, we may replace the partial
differentiations in (4.3.30) from the right by ones from the left since this means
simply to multiply the whole equation, in the just mentioned equation, by 1 for
a Fermi ﬁeld. Accordingly the ﬁeld equations (Euler-Lagrange Equations) may be
rewritten as

A far simpler way of obtaining (4.3.31) is to take the functional derivative of the

following manner.
To the above end, the functional derivative of b.x 0/ with respect to a.x/ is

differentiations, using the simple rules in (4.3.33), (4.3.34) and (4.3.35):
In conclusion, the following should be also noted:
1. Not all the ﬁeld equations following from (4.3.31) or (4.3.36) are necessarily
equations of motion as such they may not involve the time derivative of a ﬁeld in
question and may lead to constraints for the latter ﬁeld. For examples, working in
the Coulomb gauge in QED and QCD, the ﬁeld equations obtained by varying the
zeroth components A0, Aa 0 of the vector potentials, respectively, do not involve
their time derivatives and lead to constraints for them, and not all the remaining
components are independent. The canonical conjugate momentum density of a
dependent ﬁeld, expressed in terms of independent ﬁelds, is zero, and its variation
is induced by the generators of the independent ﬁelds just mentioned.
2. Later we will see how ﬁeld equations are derived from Lagrangian densities for
higher spin ﬁelds involving arbitrary orders in the space derivative @, due to
constraints, but still of ﬁrst order in the time derivative @0, of the ﬁelds.

3. It is important to realize that all the results derived were obtained by a priori
numerical variations of the ﬁelds obeying their respective statistics as established
by the Spin & Statistics Connection in Sect. 4.5. Quantum variations applied
a priori to a Lagrangian are certainly generalizations and as such they often
involve additional assumptions and consequences not always of practical value,
and further generalizations lead, for example, to generalized statistics such as
para-statistics.

Variations of Boundary Surfaces
In reference to the second type of variations corresponding only to change of the
boundary surfaces, in response to a transformation t ! t  •t, the corresponding

With the Lagrangian density L .x/ as a Lorentz scalar, we may use the
invariance of a scalar product in spacetime, to readily generalize this result further
for states associated with space-like surfaces 1, 2 corresponding to the change of

A local conservation law, corresponding to the conservation of the operator Q
in (4.3.59) may be also given, from the above integral, by considering an inﬁnitesi-
mal deviation of the hypersurface 2 from 1, about a point x, which leads to

(4.3.61)
This is the content of Noether’s Theorem . Of course the volume integral of j 0.x/
simply gives the expression for Q in (4.3.59).
Finally, we note from (4.3.15), (4.3.28), (4.3.29), where • a.x/ corresponds to, a
priori, imposed arbitrary inﬁnitesimal transformation, together with the expression
for the generator in (4.3.60) that the generator which induces transformation of the

Spin and Statistics Connection
The unique and important role that the Spin and Statistics Connection plays not
only in physics but in all of the sciences, in general, and in the stability of matter
and hence in our own existence, cannot be overemphasized. The Periodic Table of
Elements in chemistry is based on the Pauli Exclusion Principle as a special case.
Without it matter would be simply unstable and collapse.7
The Spin & Statistics Connection arises naturally and self consistently by the
analysis of the action integral.

A complex ﬁeld may be re-expressed as a real ﬁeld with double the number
of components consisting of its real and imaginary parts. For example, a four-
component Dirac ﬁeld may be re-expressed as a real one having eight components
as we have seen in (3.5.3), Sect. 3.5. By appropriately choosing the ﬁelds in the
theory to have even more components, such a ﬁrst order Lagrangian density may, in
general, be constructed. For the Dirac ﬁeld, the structure given in (4.5.1) is obvious.
The situation involved with other ﬁelds will be treated later. Further generalizations
of (4.5.1) will be also discussed at the end of this section dealing with constraints.
Any square matrix C may be written as the sum of a symmetric and an anti-
symmetric matrices S and A, i.e., C D S C A, with
Sa b D .Ca b C Cb a/=2;
Aa b D .Ca b  Cb a/=2;
(4.5.3)
and S> D S, A> D A. For a matrix C such that C	 D C, we also have
S	 D S, A	 D A.
Accordingly, we consider two systems for which
.Q/> D Q
or
.Q/> D  Q;
(4.5.4)
together with the condition in (4.5.2).
As before we deﬁne the action integral, a functional of the ﬁeld ,
AŒ   D
Z x0D t2
x0D t1
.dx/ L Œ .x/; @.x/ ;
(4.5.5)
as an integral over spacetime bounded by space-like surfaces x 0 D t1, x 0 D t2.
We investigate the nature of the variation of the action in response to the variation
of the ﬁeld deﬁned by .x/ ! .x/  • .x/. Following Schwinger, we consider
variations of AŒ   arising from c-number variations • .x/. We will then encounter
that such variations we were set to achieve with • .x/ commuting with the ﬁeld
itself is possible only for systems satisfying the second condition in (4.5.4), while
• .x/ as a c-number Grassmann variable anti-commuting with the ﬁeld is possible
only for systems satisfying the ﬁrst one.
We deﬁne the variation

We set

(4.5.8)

the addition of a term proportional to the ﬁrst integral, be expressed as

From this we learn that a c-number variation • a.x/ commuting with the ﬁelds
 b.x/ is possible only for " D 1, i.e., for .Q/> D  Q, while a variation
• a.x/ as a c-number Grassmann variable anti-commuting with the ﬁelds b.x/ is
possible only for " D C1, i.e., for .Q/> D Q. Otherwise the expression within
the square brackets in the integrand in (4.5.9) would be zero and no equations of
motion for the ﬁelds involving their derivatives will result.
Therefore we may write,

(4.5.13)
up to numerical matrices, and where on the left-hand side of this equation we have
the product of n ﬁeld components appearing to the left • a. Accordingly, we will
get the same expression for • FŒ .x/  as prescribed above, if we set up the rule
that

Given a Lagrangian density as in (4.5.1), the statistics obeyed by the ﬁeld in question
depends on the anti-hermitian matrix Q satisfying one of the conditions spelled out
in (4.5.4). In particular, we learn that a variation • a.x/ commuting with the ﬁelds

• a.x/ as a Grassmann variable anti-commuting with the ﬁelds b.x/ is possible
only for " D C1, i.e., for .Q/> D Q. In the ﬁrst case the theory is quantized
via commutators derived in (4.5.20), while for the second case it is quantized via
anti-commutators derived in (4.5.21). The ﬁeld equations are given in (4.5.15), and
the properties displayed in (4.5.23), (4.5.24) should be noted.
The method of investigation of the Spin and Statistics connection developed in
this section is referred to as Schwinger’s Constructive Approach.8
The above results have already been applied to the Dirac quantum ﬁeld in
Sect. 3.5, and special cases are discussed below. Applications to other ﬁelds are
given in the next section. We ﬁrst consider the Hamiltonian

(4.5.32)
Upon multiplying the latter by Q0
a b •  b.x/=2, remembering the properties
in (4.5.10), (4.5.11), using the Bose-Einstein character of the Hamiltonian, and
ﬁnally integrating over x gives from (4.5.28)

(4.5.33)
where G is given in (4.5.17). Since the integrand of • H in (4.5.28) is linear in
• a.x/, we see that this generator G accounts for half • a.x/=2 for the variation
of the ﬁelds • a.x/.
4.5.3
Constraints
Finally we note that for higher spins because of constraints, such as ones arising
from gauge constraints, Lagrangian densities of the form in (4.5.1) may arise, where
the matrix Q may become dependent on the space derivative @ of arbitrary orders
and so does F, which would involve arbitrary orders of the space derivatives of the
ﬁelds. That is, they become replaced by Q.@/, FŒ.x/; @.x/ and are even in @:
Q.@/ D Q.@/ and the same for F. In particular, this means that @ operates
equally to the left or right. In such cases the relations in (4.5.20), (4.5.21), with
x0 D x 0 0, become simply replaced by

Quantum Dynamical Principle (QDP) of Field Theory
The Quantum Dynamical Principle (QDP) gives rise to a powerful and elegant
formalism for studying dynamics in ﬁeld theory and for carrying out all sorts of
computations. It is particularly easy to apply and provides, in a compact way,
a method for considering variations of so-called transformation functions, such
as transition amplitudes, with respect to parameters that may appear in a theory
as coupling parameters, as well as of variations with respect to external sources
coupled to the underlying ﬁelds.
In the above sense, out of the QDP a functional differential formalism emerges
for quantum ﬁeld theory, where the dynamics is investigated and physical aspects
of the theory are extracted simply by functional differentiations of some given
generating functionals. In turn, it provides tremendous physical insight and an easy
way for studying basic processes in a theory as particles/anti-particles move from
emission to detection regions in a way similar to experimental situations.
By a functional Fourier transform (§ 2.6), the QDP also gives rise to its path
integral counterpart, appropriately referred to as the path integral formalism,
where continual integrations are to be carried out instead of differentiations of the
differential QDP formalism, as will be seen in Chaps. 5 and 6.
The purpose of this section is to derive the QDP from ﬁrst principles. Applica-
tions of this will be given in various stages, and some applications were already
carried out in Sect. 3.3 and in Sect. 3.6. The reader will conveniently ﬁnd a direct
summary suitable for practical applications of the QDP at the end of this section.
Suppose one has a Hamiltonian H.t; / depending on some parameters, denoted
collectively by , such as coupling parameters and external sources that we wish
to vary. The Hamiltonian may have an explicit time dependence assumed to come
from such parameters. That is, the explicit time dependence is of numerical nature
unaffected by transformations applied to operators in the underlying vector space in
which H.t; / operates. We may, in turn, introduce the Hamiltonian H.t; 0/, and
corresponding time development unitary operators U	.t; /, U	.t; 0/, associated
with the two Hamiltonians, satisfying
i d
dt U	.t; / D U	.t; / H.t; /;
i d
dt U	.t; 0/ D U	.t; 0/ H.t; 0/:
(4.6.1)
The Hamiltonian H.t; 0/ may also depend on some other parameters that we do not
wish to vary. H.t; 0/, in general denotes the renormalized free Hamiltonian, that is
the free Hamiltonian expressed in terms of physically measurable quantities.

Quantum Dynamical Principle (QDP) of Field Theory
169
Given a state h a;  D 0I t j 	 h a;  D 0 j U	.t; 0/, corresponding to a system
governed by the Hamiltonian H.t; 0/, i.e., for  D 0, we deﬁne a state
h a ; j D h a; D0j U	.; 0/ U.; /;
(4.6.2)
developing in time via the unitary operator U	.t; / i.e.,
h a ; I tj D h a ; j U	.t; /:
(4.6.3)
Such a state, satisﬁes the Scrödinger equation
i d
dth a ; I tj D h a ; I tj H.t; /;
(4.6.4)
and has the remarkable property that for t D , it simply becomes

ˇˇˇ
tD D h a; D0j U	.; 0/ U.; / U	.; / D h a; D0 I  j :
(4.6.5)
In practice, one may choose  ! ˙1, with the states h a ˙ 1; I t j describing
scattering states. The reason why they are referred to as scattering states is that
from (4.6.5),
h a ˙ 1; j U	.t; / D h a ˙ 1; I tj! h a; D0I tjD h a; D0j U	.t; 0/; t ! ˙1:
The notation h a outj b ini for h a C 1; j b  1; i in such limits is often used.
Quite generally, however, we may introduce states:
h b 2; I tj;
ja 1; I ti;
and consider
1  t  2:
(4.6.6)
It is thus convenient to introduce the operator
V.t; / D U	.t; 0/ U.t; /;
(4.6.7)
and rewrite (4.6.2) as
h a ; j D h a; D0 j V.; /:
(4.6.8)
The operator V.t; / satisﬁes the equation
i d
dt V	.t; / D U	.t; /ŒH.t; /  H.t; 0/U.t; 0/;
(4.6.9)
with ŒH.t; /H.t; 0/ denoting the part of the Hamiltonian depending on coupling
parameters and external sources that we wish to vary, which, as mentioned above,

170

Fundamental Aspects of Quantum Field Theory
are denoted collectively by . The Hamiltonian H.t; 0/ need not even to be
speciﬁed and may depend on other parameters that we do not wish to vary.
We are interested in investigating the dynamics in a time interval 1 < t <
2. The QDP is particularly involved with the study of the variation of amplitudes
h b 2;  j a 1; i with respect to one or more of the components of , such as
coupling parameters and of external sources. A derivative with respect to  standing
for an external source will then denote a functional derivative (see, e.g., Sect. 3.6).
Using (4.6.9), the following identity is easily derived for  ¤ 2,  ¤ 1 and
 ¤ 0:

(4.6.12)
We take the matrix element of the above between the - independent states
hb;  D 0 j, j a;  D 0i, i.e., •hb;  D 0 jD 0, •j a;  D 0i D 0, and use the
expression for the - dependent states in (4.6.2)/(4.6.8). This gives

(4.6.13)
The Hamiltonian H.; / is to be expressed in terms of the independent ﬁelds,
denoted collectively by , and their canonical conjugate momenta, denoted by
, as well as of the parameters . The independent ﬁelds are those for which
their canonical conjugate momenta do not vanish. The Hamiltonian H.t; / is then
written as
H.t; / D H.; ; ; t/:
(4.6.14)

We may deﬁne the Heisenberg picture of H.t; / by
H.t; / D H..t/; .t/; ; t// D U	.t; / H.; ; ; t/ U.t; /;
(4.6.15)
relating the Schrödinger to the Heisenberg pictures, where now .t/, .t/, may
depend on . The parameters  and the numerical t- dependence in H.:; :; ; t/ are
not affected by the transformation. Accordingly, (4.6.13) may be rewritten as
•h b 2;  j a 1; i D i h b 2;  j
Z  2
1
d •H.; / j a; 1; i;
(4.6.16)
provided it is understood that in the variation •H.; /, with respect to any of the
components of , the ﬁelds ./, ./ are kept ﬁxed as dictated by the expression
in the integrand in (4.6.13) and by the steps going from (4.6.13), (4.6.14), (4.6.15)
and (4.6.16).
To simplify the notation we will use the notation h b t j for the - dependent
states h b t;  j as no confusion may arise.
Equation (4.6.16) is the celebrated Schwinger Dynamical Principle also known
as the Quantum Dynamical Principle, for parameters and external source variations,
expressed in terms of the Hamiltonian and of the - dependent interacting states
h b  j; ja i. The interesting thing to note is that although these states depend on ,
in the variation of h b 2 j a 1i, with respect to , the entire variation on the right-
hand side of (4.6.16) is applied directly to the Hamiltonian (with the ﬁelds ./,
./ kept ﬁxed). This is thanks to the key identity derived in (4.6.10).
We also consider variations of the matrix elements of an arbitrary function of the
variables indicated
B..t/; .t/; ; t/ 	 B.t; /:
(4.6.17)
To the above end, we subsequently use the identity
V.2; / B.; / V	.1; /
D V.2; / V	.; / U	.; 0/ B.; ; ; / U.; 0/ V.; / V	.1; /;
(4.6.18)
where B.; ; ; t/ is in the Schrödinger picture.
By successive applications of (4.6.10), we have from (4.6.18), for 1 <  < 2
•Œ V.2; / B .; / V	.1; /  D  i V.2; /

and taking the matrix element of (4.6.19) between the states ha; D0 j, j b; D0i,

respect to P.t/, as given in (4.6.23), and hence
•L j D  •H j:
(4.6.25)
Here it is important to note that •L j denotes variation with respect to  keeping
.t/, P.t/ ﬁxed, while •H j denotes variation with respect to  keeping .t/, .t/
ﬁxed.
Consider the following two types of dependent ﬁelds:
1. Fields for which their canonical conjugate momenta vanish and for which the
Euler-Lagrange equations give rise to constraints for them allowing one to
eliminate them in favor of the independent ﬁelds .x/ and the corresponding

4.6
Quantum Dynamical Principle (QDP) of Field Theory
173
canonical conjugate momenta .x/ as well as the parameters , in general.
When a Lagrangian does not involve the time derivative of a given ﬁeld, its
canonical conjugate momentum vanishes. The important thing to note here is that
due to such constraints, these dependent ﬁelds may have an explicit dependence
on the parameters . These dependent ﬁelds will be denoted collectively by
%, and the constraints are derivable ones. Examples of such ﬁelds, working in
the Coulomb gauge, are the zeroth components A0.x/ and A0
a.x/ of the vector
potentials in QED and QCD, respectively.
2. Consider dependent ﬁelds arising from constraints, one may, a priori, impose on
functions of the ﬁelds, involving no time derivatives, and applied directly to the
Lagrangian. That is, some ﬁelds or ﬁeld components are written as functions of
other ﬁelds or their components and may involve their space derivatives. In short,
these dependent ﬁelds are expressed in terms of independent ﬁelds and perhaps
their space derivatives. Since the variations encountered above, with respect to
, are carried out with the independent ﬁelds kept ﬁxed, such dependent ﬁelds
are automatically kept ﬁxed in these variations unless they are also chosen to
have explicit - dependence. Such constraints are, a priori, imposed constraints.
Examples of such constraints are the Coulomb gauges r  A D 0, r  Aa D 0
in QED and QCD, respectively. Here we see that one of the three components
may be expressed in favor of the other two, and, needless to say, not all the
components may be varied independently in deriving Euler-Lagrange equations.
After the dependent ﬁelds %, as just discussed in point 1. above, are eliminated
from the above constraints, the Lagrangian L.t; / 	 L..t/; P.t/; %.t/; ; t/ of the
system becomes replaced by the effective Lagrangian L..t/; P.t/; ; t/ considered
earlier in (4.6.22), i.e.,
L..t/; P.t/; %.t/; ; t/ D L..t/; P.t/; ; t/:
(4.6.26)
The variation of the action R 0
 dt L.t; / with respect to , with .t/, P.t/ kept
ﬁxed, comes from the explicit dependence of L.t; / on , and may also come from
the dependence of % on , as arising from the corresponding constraint equations.

(4.6.30)
where •L.t; /j stands for variations with respect to , with .t/, P.t/ as well as
the dependent ﬁelds %.t/ all kept ﬁxed.
In particular, upon taking the limits 1 ! 1; 2 ! C1, and using the
notations jai for ja 1i; hbCj for h b 2j, in these limits, (4.6.16), (4.6.25), (4.6.28),
(4.6.30), lead to

(4.6.31)
The variations in •L .x; / in (4.6.31), with respect to , are from (4.6.28) carried
out by keeping the independent ﬁelds .x/ and the dependent ﬁelds %.x/ as well as
the derivatives @.x/, r%.x/ all kept ﬁxed.
Equation (4.6.31) is another version of the Schwinger Dynamical Principle, also
known as the Quantum Dynamical Principle (QDP), for parameters and external
source variations, expressed in terms of the Lagrangian density L .x; / and the
-dependent interacting states hbCj, j ai.
The expression for the QDP in (4.6.31) takes on a particular simple and a very
useful form by choosing H.t; 0/ 	 H0 to be the free time-independent Hamiltonian,
and j a;  D 0i, j b;  D 0i its ground (vacuum) state: H 0 j 0i D 0. This gives for
the variation of the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude
•h 0Cj 0i D i h 0C j
Z

(4.6.32)
One should note that other standard notations for the vacuum-to-vacuum tran-
sition amplitude h 0C j 0i one may encounter are h 0 out j 0 ini, h vac.out/ j
vac.in/i. As we have already seen in Sect. 3.6, h 0C j 0i is not necessarily just a
phase factor.
The very compact equation in (4.6.32) provides a wealth of information in
quantum ﬁeld theory and is of central importance in applications as we have
witnessed in Sect. 3.3 and in Sect. 3.6, and as will be seen again and again in later
sections and subsequent chapters.

Summary
Now we provide a summary of how the QDP is applied to the vacuum-to-vacuum
transition amplitude which is the starting point in many applications:
We are given a Lagrangian density L .x; / depending on parameters consisting
of coupling constants and external sources, denoted collectively by . The variation
of the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude •h 0C j 0i with respect to any of
the components of  is given by:

where the variation •L .x; / is carried out on the explicit dependence of L .x; /
on , that is all the ﬁelds and their derivatives in it are kept ﬁxed.
We may also be given a function F..x/; .x/; %.x/; / of the independent
ﬁelds .x/, their canonical conjugate momenta .x/, and, as denoted, perhaps of
dependent ﬁelds %.x/ and of . Suppose through constraint equations as obtained,
for example, from the Euler-Lagrange equations, the dependent ﬁelds may be
expressed in terms of ; , and at most of their spatial derivatives, and may be
of (the components) of . Let the resulting expression for F be denoted simply
by B.x; /. Then the variation of h 0C j B.x; / j 0i with respect to any of the
components of  is given by

where the variation •B.x; / is carried out with ; , together with their spatial
derivatives if any, kept ﬁxed. Also . : /C , as usual, denotes time-ordering. The
second term will give a contribution only if B.x; / depends explicitly on . In such
cases the variation of the above matrix element will pick up a contribution coming
from the second term on the right-hand side in addition to the ﬁrst integral involving
the time ordered products

C. This causes some complications
in the quantization of non-abelian gauge theories, and some abelian ones as well,
but is easily handled by the application of (4.6.38), and is the origin of the so-
called Faddeev-Popov factor, and its generalizations. These intricate details will
be worked out later for such theories. An elementary application of this is given
in Sect. 4.8 as well as other applications are given in coming chapters.10 The path
integral formalism will be also considered.

A Panorama of Fields
This section deals with the basic quantum ﬁelds one often encounters in quantum
ﬁeld theory/high-energyphysics. The ﬁelds in question are of spin 0, 1, 3/2 and 2, for
massive and massless particles. The relevant technical details are relegated to their
corresponding subsections that follow. The technical details concerning spin 1/2,
the Dirac ﬁeld, however, are spelled out in Chap. 3, while that of the massless spin
1, the photon, are the subject matter of Chap. 5. Needless to say, the corresponding
subsections to follow of all these ﬁelds, form an integral part of this section and
10There is a long history with the quantum dynamical principle, see, Schwinger [10, 12, 14, 15],
Lam [1], and Manoukian [3, 4].

for the second example is modiﬁed due to the F factor in (4.8.30), and this is as a
consequence of the presence of the dependent ﬁeld V0.x/. This means, in particular,
that the action integral gets modiﬁed. Such a property is shared by non-abelian
gauge theories in most gauges. We note that the double integral in (4.8.30) produces
a •.4/.0/ factor due to the product of delta functions at coincident spacetime points.
Finally, we note that the presence of a dependent ﬁeld is not necessary, in every
case, for the presence of a modifying factor F as encountered above beyond the

density in (4.8.11), say, by  ./abŒ a.x/;  b.x/V=2, which is linear in the
vector ﬁeld V, no such a modiﬁcation arises (see Problem 4.16).

Lagrangians and Setting Up the Solution
of Field Theory
This section deals with general aspects of the structure of Lagrangian densities in
quantum ﬁeld theory and on the way one may then proceed to set up the solution of
an underlying theory. The way of actually constructing such Lagrangian densities
to describe the fundamental interactions of nature will be carried out in remaining
chapters. Before doing so, we recapitulate some aspects of time-ordered products.
To this end, recall that one may add coupling terms, to a given Lagrangian density
L .x/, consisting of the interaction of the underlying ﬁelds in a theory, say, of a
scalar ﬁeld .x/ and Dirac ﬁelds  .x/,  .x/ with external sources

How to Write Down Lagrangian Densities:
1. Lorentz Invariance and Other Symmetries: In quantum ﬁeld theory, a Lagrangian
density L .x/, not including couplings of the ﬁelds to external sources, is, a
priori, chosen to be Lorentz invariant, that is, it behaves as a Lorentz scalar:
L 0.x 0/ D L .x/ under a Lorentz transformation x  ! x 0  D  x.
This, however, does not mean that given such a Lagrangian density, which is
formally a Lorentz scalar, one cannot subsequently use, for example, as may
be done in QED or in QCD, non-covariant gauges such as the Coulomb one
r  A D 0, or r  Aa D 0, respectively. The importance of using, for
example, the Coulomb gauge in such gauge theories is that only the physical
degrees of freedom associated with the vector ﬁelds are quantized ensuring the
necessary positive deﬁniteness of the underlying physical Hilbert space. One
may then invoke the gauge invariance of transition probabilities associated with
the underlying physical processes to infer that the results should be the same
as the ones that may be obtained by using covariant gauges. By doing so,

4.9
Time-Ordered Products, How to Write Down Lagrangians and Setting Up. . .
211
one would ﬁnally recover a gauge and Lorentz invariant theoretical framework
for the computation of physical results. Accordingly, it is misleading to state
that a non-covariant gauge destroys the Lorentz invariance of a theory. In the
same manner, when one chooses a speciﬁc gauge, such as a covariant gauge,
the Lagrangian density becomes restricted to such a gauge and hence gauge
invariance is destroyed at the Lagrangian level, but the theory dealing with
physical processes is nevertheless gauge invariant. Symmetries relevant to the
underlying theory may also be implemented, as we will see, for example, when
supersymmetric ﬁeld theories will be developed later. Symmetry breaking will
be also discussed.
2. Even in Fermi-Dirac Fields. The Bose-Einstein character of the Lagrangian
density implies that it must be even in the Fermi-Dirac ﬁelds constructed in such
a manner so that this aspect is maintained.
3. Limits of Time-Ordered Products. We have seen in the previous section that the
matrix element h 0CjLI.x/ j 0i is generated by functional differentiations with
external sources and leads an expression for LI.x/ always as a limit of time-
ordered products. That is, the QDP self consistently requires that Lagrangian
densities be deﬁned as the limits of time-ordered products. We have also seen
in (4.9.8), (4.9.9) and (4.9.10) that within a time-ordered product the ﬁelds
obey commutativity or anti-commutativity properties as spelled out in the just
mentioned equations. In reference to (4.9.11), for example, we consider the
average of the limits x ! x 0 C 0, x ! x 0  0, with initial spacelike
separation .x  x 0/2 > 0, and similarly for the scalar ﬁeld in (4.9.12). This,
in particular, means that in writing down a Lagrangian density one is to take
the anti-symmetric average of the product of two Fermi-Dirac ﬁelds and the
symmetric average of the product of two Bose-Einstein ﬁelds. Hence, one makes
the following replacement for the product of two Dirac ﬁelds
 a.x/ b.x/ ! 1

abŒ  a.x/;  b.x/ ;
(4.9.15)
and eo is the (unrenormalized) charge. We have already seen the deﬁnition
of the electromagnetic current deﬁned as in (4.9.15) consistent with charge
conjugation transformation in (3.6.9) in Sect. 3.6. It is important to note, as
already emphasized in Sect. 3.6, that the functional derivative •=• c.x 0/, for

otherwise one would get zero as a trivial result. The above analysis leads us to
emphasize the following:
“Students often wonder why one can commute (anti-commute) ﬁeld compo-
nents in the interaction Lagrangian density for a theory dealing with operators.
With the interaction Lagrangian density deﬁned as a limit of a time-ordered
product this becomes evident”.
4. Renormalizability. The Lagrangian density is so chosen so the theory becomes
renormalizable.
Setting Up the Solution of Field Theory:
The importance of deriving an expression for the vacuum-to-vacuum transition
amplitude h 0C j 0i in ﬁeld theory stems from the fact that one may carry out
a unitarity expansion for the latter in terms of multi-particle states from which
transition amplitudes for the underlying physical processes of a theory may be
readily extracted.18 At this stage the reader is urged to review the two examples
provided in the last section on the application of the QDP before considering the
general strategy for setting up the solution for h 0C j 0i given below.
Let .x/ denote collectively the independent ﬁelds in a theory with canonical
conjugate momenta denoted collectively by .x/, and let %.x/ denote collec-
tively the dependent ﬁelds, i.e., with vanishing canonical conjugate momenta. The
Lagrangian density will be expressed as
L .x; / D L0.x/ C LI.x; / C K.x/.x/ C S.x/%.x/;
(4.9.17)
where
LI.x; 0/ D 0;
(4.9.18)
and K.x/, S.x/ denote external sources coupled to these ﬁelds, respectively. The
dependence of L .x; / on the adjoints of the ﬁelds is suppressed for simplicity of
the notation.

Now the basic idea is to re-express h 0C j .@=@/LI.x; / j 0i as an operation
involving the functional derivatives .•=•K.x//, .•=•S.x// applied directly to
h 0C j 0i.
Suppose:
(i) The Euler-Lagrange equations allow one to eliminate the dependent ﬁelds %.x/
in favor of .x/, .x/, , K.x/, S.x/, via equations of constraints, and, in
turn, allow one to rewrite LI.x; / as a sum of terms depending on the latter
variables, with coefﬁcients depending on , and
(ii) Repeated applications of (4.6.38), as described below it, and as also done in the
second example of the last section, the above allows one, in turn, to rewrite
h 0Cj @

where b

by .˙i/ times (.•=•K.x//, .•=•S.x//), as the cases may be, (see, e.g., (4.9.2),
(4.9.3) and (4.9.4)), and b
F.x; / is an operation expressed in terms of these
functional derivatives and may depend on .
Upon integrating (4.9.20) over , the following expression for h 0C j 0i D
h 0C j 0i emerges

Here we see that, in general, the interaction term b
L I.x; /, and hence also the action,
get modiﬁed due to the presence of the second term in the exponent. The amplitude
h 0C j 0iD0 has usually a simple structure. The full amplitude h 0C j 0i is
then obtained merely by functional differentiations of h 0C j 0iD0.
Applications of the above formula were given in the last section and other
applications will be given in coming chapters.

CPT
We recall (Sect. 2.1) that charge conjugation transformation C consists in replacing
every particle in a given process by its anti-particle, while parity P reverses the
direction of the three-momentum of every particle, and time T reversal involves
in reversing the direction in which a process evolves and as such, the particles
initially going into it, become outgoing, and vice versa, while reversing the direction
of their three-momenta and their spin projections. QFT predicts that the product
of the three transformations CPT (in any order), taken together, is a symmetry
of nature in the sense that any transition probability and its CPT counterpart are

equal, and no experiment seems to contradict this. Clearly, the product CPT, as a
net transformation, amounts to replacing every particle by its anti-particle, while
reversing their spin projections, and interchanging the initial and ﬁnal states. Recall
also, due to the anti-unitary property of time reversal operation (Sect. 2.1), the CPT
transformation is implemented by an anti-unitary operator.
It should be noted that establishing the CPT invariance of the action corre-
sponding to a local Lagrangian density is only part of the analysis of the CPT
Theorem, one also has to show how the interchange of the initial and the ﬁnal
states arises with the simultaneous replacements of particles by their antiparticles
and vice versa. In this respect, we will see that in the present analysis, detectors
of particles/antiparticles and emitters of antiparticles/particles are interchanged in a
CPT “transformed” world. The latter property will automatically take care of the
arbitrary the number of particles may be going in and those that may come out of a
scattering process in a direct and simple manner.
Let us ﬁrst consider how basic ﬁelds transform under the above transformation.
To this end, note, in particular, that from (3.2.29), (3.2.31), (3.2.36), that for a Dirac
ﬁeld:
C  .x/ C1 D C  
>.x/; P  .x/ P1 D  0 .x 0/; T  .x/ T1 D  5C  .x 00/;
(4.10.1)
with given ﬁxed phases, where x 0 D .x 0; x/, x 00 D .x 0; x/, C D i 2 0.
With a rather conventional choices of phases, we may thus introduce  D CPT
transformations, and quite generally, of the following basic ﬁelds, consisting of
a Dirac ﬁeld  , a generic scalar ﬁeld ', and a generic vector ﬁeld V with a
direct generalization for the presence of several such ﬁelds for different species of
particles:
  .x/ 1 D  5 0 
>.x/;
  .x/ 1 D   >.x/ 0 5;
(4.10.2)
 '.x/ 1 D '	.x/;
 '	.x/ 1 D '.x/;
(4.10.3)
 V.x/ 1 D  V	.x/;
 V	.x/ 1 D  V.x/:
(4.10.4)
Opposite phases of the scalar and vector ﬁelds are taken since @'.x/ should
transform as a vector ﬁeld.
Given a local Lagrangian density Lagrangian density L .x/, it is not sufﬁcient
to establish the symmetry of the action integral A
D
R.dx/ L .x/ under a
CPT transformation. One also has to describe how incoming states and outgoing
states, for arbitrary processes, are interchanged and what happens to the spins of
participating particles. The latter is best described by coupling the underlying ﬁelds
to corresponding external sources to be able to identify all the particles that may be
ingoing or outgoing in any process in a straightforward manner. As we will see, the
latter avoids of introducing many-particle states for all possible processes that may

take, and, in turn, leads to examine as to what effectively happens to the external
source functions in a CPT “transformed” world.
To the above end, we consider a total action integral

(4.10.5)
where L .x/ a local Lagrangian density, and without loss of generality, restricting

(4.10.15)
and so on, where we have used the deﬁnition of v.p; / in (I.17). Referring
to (3.3.39), (3.3.42), we may infer that an outgoing particle of spin  has been
replaced by an ingoing antiparticle of spin . Upon introducing polarization
vectors, as discussed in (4.7.130), (4.7.230), satisfying the properties in (4.7.131),
for massive and massless vector bosons, we may then prepare Table 4.1 which
shows the expected changes that occur with ingoing and outgoing states in the CPT
“transformed” world.
The CPT-symmetric nature of the action of local ﬁeld theory and the fate of
the particles in a CPT “transformed” world in any given process, as described in
Table 4.1, is the content of the celebrated CPT Theorem.
Remarks
1. It should be emphasized that the theoretical analysis of the nature of particles
ingoing and outgoing in a physical process, as done above, under the CPT
transformation, and not just of establishing the transformation property of the
action of the local Lagrangian density in (4.10.11) in the absence of external

sources, is of great importance. Establishing the invariance property in (4.10.7)
is only part of the story.
2. The introduction of the source functions simpliﬁes the proof of the Theorem
tremendously as they tell us what happens to all possible ingoing and outgoing
particles/anti-particles in processes in a CPT “transformed” world. In particular,
we saw how naturally particle/antiparticle detectors and antiparticle/particle
emitters are interchanged in a CPT “transformed” world. They also provide
much physical insight on the preparatory and ﬁnal stages of physical processes
in a theory.
3. From the way QFT has been developed over the years, the validity of the CPT
Theorem is of no surprise, and its theoretical development historically was
expected.
4. Although experiments do not contradict CPT invariance, they tell us, however,
that one or two of C, P, T taken at a time are violated. The violation of CP has
been particularly intriguing and, as pointed out by Sakharov [9] almost half a
century ago, may give us a clue on the reason for the imbalance of matter and
anti-matter with nature’s preference of matter over anti-matter which, together
with the Spin & Statistics Connection (Sect. 4.5), are contributing factors to our
existence.
5. Note that the argument of the source functions in the second column with oppo-
site sign of momentum to the right column, imply, through Fourier transform, that
the corresponding particle/antiparticle, going into (loss) or coming out (gain) of
the scattering process, as the case may be, carries the same energy-momentum
before CPT transformation, but spin  and helicity state  change as seen in
the Dirac spinors and polarization vectors, respectively.

This establishes (4.10.7) since a Lagrangian density, must contain an even number

Chapter 5
Abelian Gauge Theories
Quantum electrodynamis (QED), describing the interactions of electrons (positrons)
and photons, is, par excellence, an abelian gauge theory. It is one of the most
successful theories we have in physics and a most cherished one. It stood the test
of time, and provides the blue-print, as a ﬁrst stage, for the development of modern
quantum ﬁeld theory interactions. A theory with a symmetry group in which the
generators of the symmetry transformations commute is called an abelian theory.
In QED, the generator which induces a phase change of a (non-Hermitian) charged
ﬁeld .x/
.x/ ! ei.x/ .x/;
(5.1)
is simply the identity and hence the underlying group of transformations is abelian
denoted by U.1/. The transformation rule in (5.1) of a charged ﬁeld, considered as
a complex entity with a real and imaginary part, is simply interpreted as a rotation
by an angle .x/, locally, in a two dimensional (2D) space, referred to as charge
space.1
The covariant gauge description of QED as well as of the Coulomb one are
both developed. Gauge transformations are worked out in the full theory not only
between covariant gauges but also with the Coulomb one. Explicit expressions of
generating functionals of QED are derived in the differential form, as follows from
the quantum dynamical principle, as well as in the path integral form. A relatively
simple demonstration of the renormalizability of QED is given, as well as of the
renormalization group method is developed for investigating the effective charge.
A renormalization group analysis is carried out for investigating the magnitude of
the effective ﬁne-structure at the energy corresponding to the mass of the neutral
vector boson Z 0, based on all of the well known charged leptons and quarks of
1A geometrical description is set up for the development of abelian and non-abelian gauge theories
in a uniﬁed manner in Sect. 6.1 and may be beneﬁcial to the reader.

speciﬁc masses which would contribute to this end. This has become an important
reference point for the electromagnetic coupling in present high-energy physics.
The Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, which have
much stimulated the development of quantum ﬁeld theory in the early days, are
both derived. We also include several applications to scattering processes as well
as of the study of polarization correlations in scattering processes that have become
quite interesting in recent years. The theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking is
also worked out in a celebrated version of scalar boson electrodynamics and its
remarkable consequences are spelled out. Several studies were already carried out
in Chap. 3 which are certainly relevant to the present chapter, such as of the gauge
invariant treatment of diagrams with closed fermion loops, fermion anomalies in
ﬁeld theory, as well as other applications.2

Spin One and the General Vector Field
Referring to Sect. 4.7.3, let us recapitulate, in a slightly different way, the spin 1
character of a vector ﬁeld. Under an inﬁnitesimal rotation c.c.w of a coordinate
system, in 3D Euclidean space, by an inﬁnitesimal angle •# about a unit vector N,
a three-vector x, now denoted by x0 in the new coordinate system, is given by

Polarization States of Photons
The polarization vectors e1; e2 of a photon are mutually orthogonal and are, in turn,
orthogonal to its momentum vector k. With the vector k chosen along the z-axis,
we may then introduce three unit vectors
n D k
jkj D .0; 0; 1/;
e1 D .1; 0; 0/;
e2 D .0; 1; 0/;
(5.2.1)
with the latter two providing a real representation of the polarization vectors,
satisfying

 ej
; ; 0 D 1; 2; i; j D 1; 2; 3;
(5.2.2)
where  speciﬁes the two polarization vectors, and the index i speciﬁes the ith
component of the vectors. The equality, involving ıij, is a completeness relation in
three dimensions for expanding a vector in terms of the three unit vectors n; e1; e2.
One may also introduce a complex representation of the polarization vectors,
such as, .e˙ 	 e˙ 1/

(5.2.4)
as is easily checked by considering speciﬁc values for the indices i; j specifying
components of the vectors.
One would also like to have the general expressions of the polarization vectors,
when the three momentum vector of a photon k has an arbitrary orientation
k D jkj .cos  sin ; sin  sin ; cos /:
(5.2.5)
To achieve this, we rotate the initial coordinate system in which the vector k
is initially along the z-axis, c.c.w. by an angle  about the unit vector N D
.sin ;  cos ; 0/ as shown in (Fig. 5.1), by using the explicit structure of the

Casimir Effect
The Casimir effect, in its simplest theoretical description, is an electromagnetic
force of attraction between two parallel perfectly conducting neutral plates in
vacuum. It is purely quantum mechanical, i.e., it is attributed to the quantum
nature of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and to the nature of the underlying boundary
condition imposed on it by the presence of the plates. It is one of those mysterious
consequences of quantum theory, i.e., an „-dependent result, that may be explained
by the response of the vacuum to external agents. By a careful treatment one may
introduce, in the process, a controlled environment, by placing the parallel plates
between two perfectly conducting plates placed, in turn, at very large macroscopic
distances (Fig. 5.2) from the two plates in question.9 This analysis clearly shows
how a net ﬁnite attractive arises between the plates.
The electric ﬁeld components, in particular, tangent to the plates satisfy the

The interpretation of this expansion is now clear in view of its application
in (5.4.18). The ﬁrst term 2a=.T/ within each of the round brackets above gives
each an inﬁnite force per unit area on the plate when taken each separately, but these
forces are equal and in opposite directions, and hence cancel out. The expression
.d3=dT3/F.a; T; L/ will then lead to a ﬁnite attractive force between the plates in
question, coming solely, for L ! 1, from the third term .3T3=360a3/ within
the ﬁrst round brackets in (5.4.21), leading from (5.4.18) to the ﬁnal expression

where we have re-inserted the fundamental constants „ and c in the ﬁnal

The above beautiful result was ﬁrst obtained by Casimir [16], and an early
experiment by Sparnaay [73] was not in contradiction with Casimir’s prediction.
More recent experiments (Lamoreaux [41], and, e.g., Bressi et al. [13]), however,
were more positive and showed agreement with theoretical predictions of the
Casimir effect within a few percent. Casimir forces are not necessarily attractive and
may be also repulsive depending on some factors such as on underlying geometrical
situations.11
The Casimir effect may be also derived by the method of the Riemann zeta
function regularization,12 a method that we use, e.g., in string theory.13 The above
derivation, however, is physically more interesting, and clearly emphasizes the
presence of arbitrary large forces, in opposite directions, within and out of the plates
which precisely cancel out leading ﬁnally to a ﬁnite calculable result.

reason is that functional differentiation of the action, with respect to the vector potential, involving
the quadratic terms " F0 iF0 i, FijFij=, generate the linear terms corresponding to the electric and

The expression in (5.6.19)is constant in ! and hence cannot be integrated over !

This form of radiation is referred to as ˘Cerenkov radiation. It is interesting that
astronauts during Apollo missions have reported of “seeing” ﬂashes of light even
with their eyes closed. An explanation of this was attributed to high energy cosmic
particles, encountered freely in outer space, that would pass through one’s eyelids
causing ˘Cerenkov radiation to occur within one’s eye itself.20
5.7
Quantum Electrodynamics, Covariant Gauges: Setting
Up the Solution
We apply the functional differential formalism (Sects. 4.6 and 4.8), via the quantum
dynamical principle (QDP), to derive an explicit expression of the full QED
vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitide h 0C j 0i in covariant gauges (Sect. 5.3).
By carrying the relevant functional differentiations coupled to a functional Fourier
transform (Sect. 2.6), the path integral form of h 0C j 0i is also derived. The
corresponding expressions in the Coulomb gauge will be derived in Sect. 5.14.
Gauge transformations of h 0C j 0i between covariant gauges as well as between
covariant gauges and the Coulomb one will be derived in Sect. 5.15.
5.7.1
The Differential Formalism (QDP) and Solution of QED
in Covariant Gauges
The purpose of this subsection is to ﬁnd explicit expressions for h 0C j 0i of
QED in covariant gauges. The vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude h 0C j 0i
is a generating functional for all possible underlying physical processes and also
for extracting various components of the theory, such a propagators and Green
functions.

A far more interesting expression for h 0C j 0i, and a more useful one for
practical applications, is obtained by examining (5.7.18). To this end, upon taking
the functional derivative of h 0Cj a.x/ j 0i, as given in (5.7.13), with respect to

invariant under the replacement of bA.x/ by bA.x/C@.x/. It is studied in detail
in Sect. 3.6 and Appendix IV at the end of the book, and may be explicitly spelled
out by simply making the obvious substitution SC.x; x 0I e0A/ ! SC.x; x 0I e0bA/ in
23The expressions in (5.7.20) and (5.7.27) are appropriately referred to as generating functionals.
As we have no occasion to deal with subtleties in deﬁning larger vector spaces to accommodate
covariant gauges, we will not go into such technicalities here.

we determine the coefﬁcients a1; a2; a3, containing a wealth of information on
QED, consisting only of connected components of the theory, that is, having at
least one propagator connecting any of its subparts. And from the normalization
condition in (5.8.1), only so-called diagrams with external lines, connected to their
respective sources, occur. These coefﬁcients are analyzed and applied in the next
couple of sections and their physical consequences are spelled out. The power of the
formalism, is that all correct multiplicative factors in integrals, describing various
components of the theory, such as physical processes, occur automatically and no
guess work is required about such numerical factors, as powers of ’s, and proper
normalization constants.

In extracting transition amplitudes, the sources are eventually withdrawn, i.e.,
one ﬁnally sets  D 0;  D 0; J D 0. Here we recall, for example, that
h p ; j 0i denotes the amplitude that the source  emits an electron, thus acting
as an emitter, and h 0C j p ; i denotes the amplitude that a source  absorbs an
electron, thus playing the role of a detector. Don’t let the notations in these equations
scare you. They provide a simple worry free formalism for getting correct numerical
factors such as .2/3, and so on, as mentioned above, and facilitate further the
analysis in obtaining transition amplitudes of physical processes.

Abelian Gauge Theories
The moral of introducing these amplitudes of emissions and detections, above
is the following. Using the explicit expressions in (5.8.8), (5.8.9), (5.8.10) and
(5.8.11), with the sources appropriately arranged causally to reﬂect the actual
process where the particles in question are emitted and detected by these sources,
the transition amplitudes for arbitrary processes are then simply given by the
coefﬁcients of these amplitudes of emissions followed by detection. This may be
simply represented as follows:
0+|particles (out) detected by sources
particles (out) on their way to detection|particles (in) emitted by sources
particles (in) emitted by sources|0−,

as obtained from (5.8.8), (5.8.9), (5.8.10) and (5.8.11), corresponding to what
happens experimentally, and where the transition amplitude is given by
h particles (out)jparticles (in)i
D h particles (out) on their way to detectionjparticles (in) emitted by sourcesi:
(5.8.21)
This ingenious method which allows one to quickly extract transition amplitudes
with correct multiplicative numerical factors is due to Schwinger, and no guessing
is required as to what correct multiplicative factors should be in the formalism.
Before closing this section, we note that the interactions in processes are
mediated by the propagators. In the momentum description, the photon propagator
of momentum Q develops a singularity at Q2 D 0, i.e., for Q as a light-like
vector, corresponding to the masslessness-shell constraint of a real, i.e., detectable,
photon. In general, we may have cases for which Q2 ¤ 0 corresponding to
a space-like or a time-like Q. In the latter two cases, the four momentum of
the photon is said to be off the masslessness-shell condition Q2 D 0, and the
photon thus cannot be detected by a detector. It is then referred to as a virtual
particle since the photon does not have the appropriate relation between energy and
momentum to be detectable. Let us investigate the meaning of this last inequality.
For Q space-like, i.e., for Q2 > 0, for example, we have Q2 > .Q0/2, which
means the photon lacks the appropriate energy, in comparison to its momentum,
to be detectable. On the other hand, for Q2 < 0 i.e., for Q2 < .Q0/2, the
photon has a surplus of energy over its momentum to be detectable. To see how
actually such a virtual photon arises, with a space-like or time-like momentum, in

of the virtual photon is space-like. (b) Consider an electron and a positron annihilating, e.g. in the
c.m., into a (virtual) photon. The momentum of the virtual photon is time-like. (c) Consider the
scattering of an electron and a photon to a (virtual) electron. The momentum p of the virtual
electron is off the mass-shell satisfying the relation p2 < m2. (d) Consider an electron becoming
virtual in the scattering of the electron with the emission of a photon. The momentum p of the
virtual electron is off the mass shell satisfying the relation p2 > m2. The photon is denoted by
a wavy line, while the electron (positron) by a solid one. A virtual particle which has too much
energy or not enough energy to be on the mass shell, as the case may be, may, respectively, give
off energy to another particle or absorb energy from another one and may eventually emerge as a
real particle in an underlying Feynman diagram description of fundamental processes
the light of these observations, consider the diagrams depicting some processes in
Fig. 5.3.25
Now let us proceed, move to the next section, and see how things work out,
compute transition amplitudes by applying the above equations, and witness the
wealth of information stored in them.
5.9
Basic Processes
Experimentally, scattering processes are quantiﬁed and their likelihood of occur-
rence are determined in terms of what one calls the cross section. This quantity
arises in the following manner. Consider the scattering, say, of two particles of
masses m1 and m2 leading ﬁnally to an arbitrary number of particles that may
be allowed by the underlying theory. The transition probability per unit time
Probjunit time for the process to occur is ﬁrst calculated. Consider a frame in which,
say, the particle m2, is (initially) at rest. Such a frame may be referred to as
the laboratory or target (TF) frame. To determine the likelihood of the process to
occur, and simultaneously obtain a measure of the interaction of the two particles,
Probjunit time, in turn, is compared to, i.e., divided by, the probability per unit time
25These processes are assumed to involve no external sources or external potentials.

per unit area, denoted by F, that particle m1 crosses at the position of particle of
mass m2, represented by  in Fig. 5.4, as if the latter particle is absent, and hence
no interaction is involved.
The probability per unit area per unit time F, deﬁned above, is called the incident
ﬂux. Most importantly, the ratio deﬁned above leads, upon integration, to a Lorentz
invariant expression for the cross section, and thus may be computed in any inertial
frame. By deﬁnition, the unit of cross section is that of an area and, intuitively, the
cross section provides an effective area for the process to occur. The differential
cross section d is then simply deﬁned by the above mentioned ratio, i.e., by
Probjunit time per incident ﬂux F: d D Probjunit time=F.
The probability of ﬁnding, the particle of mass m1, of speed v, within a cube of
cross sectional area A and width vT, during a time T, is given by A v T=V, where
V denotes the volume of the 3D space in which the scattering process occurs. Thus
the probability that this particle crosses a unit area per unit time, at the position 
of particle m2, as if the latter is absent (see Fig. 5.4), is given by

In this section, we consider several processes of interest to low orders, including
polarizations correlations studies of outgoing particles in such processes which have
been quite important in recent years. The derivations underlying the scattering pro-
cesses are obtained directly from the explicit expression obtained forh 0C j 0i in
the previous section, to lowest orders. The formalism is powerful enough that all the
numerical factors in transition amplitudes appear directly as well as various relations
concerning the statistics of the underlying particles, and no guessing is necessary.
 
For the convenience of the reader we here recall the transition made between box
normalization and that of the inﬁnite extension as arising from the Fourier transform,
in the complex form, and that of the Fourier integral, used often in scattering theory:

Re-iterating, this fundamental relation, in general, signiﬁes the obvious correlation
that exists between the measurement of one of the spins on the other.
The speed ˇ dependence of the probabilities cannot be overlooked. The moral
of this is that polarization correlations probabilities, in general, depend on the
underlying dynamics of the theory and, in particular, on the underlying energy
(speed) and it is certainly misleading to attempt to derive them from just by
combining spins.33

leading order (Fig. 5.9), by taking into account the fact that the mass of the muon M

polarizations correlations in their role in support of the monumental quantum theory against so-
called hidden variables theories, see, e.g., the just mentioned paper, Manoukian [56], Bell [5], and
Bell and Aspect [6]. For a detailed review, with applications to QED, the electroweak theory and
strings, see Yongram and Manoukian [83]. We have observed the speed dependence of polarization
correlations in actual quantum ﬁeld theory calculations early (2003) (see [82])

leads to a modiﬁcation of the propagator from its “bare” counterpart SC due to the

To determine the modiﬁed electron propagator eS. p/, due to the interaction, and

Here we have introduced a small ﬁctitious mass  ! 0 for the photon to avoid
divergences at low energies – the so called infrared divergence. Also note that due
to the interaction, as we will see below, the actual mass m of the electron is such
that m ¤ m0, m0 D mŒ1CO.e2/. Thus it is convenient to introduce the fee electron

concept of the renormalized electron ﬁeld, and carrying a wavefunction renormal-
ization.37
It is interesting to relate the wavefunction renormalization constant Z 2 in the

This will be compared with the full theory later on in Sect. 5.15 (see (5.15.30)).
Formally, Z 2 represents the probability that the (fermion) ﬁeld creates a particle
out of the vacuum. The electron ﬁeld, however, is a gauge dependent object and
one must be careful in such an interpretation here. The second point concerning
Z 2 is, in general, its infrared cut-off dependence. This is due to the fact that an
electron, being a charged particle, and the fact that the photon is massless, it cannot
be rigorously deﬁned, in isolation, without the presence of an arbitrary number of
photons of arbitrarily small (soft) energies accompanying it, while Z 2 above is
introduced in terms of an electron without such a cloud of soft photons. Finally, we
note that this constant was introduced by going on the mass shell of the electron.
This corresponds to deﬁning scattering states of an electron as observed in emission
and detection regions. This necessitates to scale the electron propagator by 1=Z 2,
and introduce, in turn, the renormalized electron propagator via the identiﬁcation

Abelian Gauge Theories
In reference to (5.10.34), the above condition deﬁnes a boundary condition for the
renormalized propagator near the mass shell, for a proper description of electron
in scattering states, up to the presence of soft photons accompanying it. The ever
presence of such soft photons will be discussed later in Sect. 5.12.
Now we come to the concept of mass renormalization. Using the ultraviolet cut-

which, presumably, no justiﬁcation can be given with our present physical theories.
Through the process of renormalization, the parameter m0 has been eliminated
in favor of the physically observed mass m, as it should be done for a sensible
description of the theory.

the mass of the Higgs Boson, in the electroweak theory, one has a quadratic dependence on the
cut-off , and its unrenormalized and renormalized masses are drastically different.

Again from our study of the ﬁeld concept, Z3 is interpreted as the probability
that the electromagnetic ﬁeld creates a photon out of the vacuum. A clear picture
of the meaning of the renormalization constant Z3 further arises from a so-called
spectral decomposition of the photon propagator, which has also a counterpart in
the full theory, and is obtained as follows.

which increases as 2 increases, i.e., it increases as the distance between the charge
decreases. This is physically expected, as from the diagram above, for example,
one may infer that the creation of an electron-positron pair leads to screening of
a charge when one is far away from the charge in question, and vice versa as one
approaches the charge as discussed in the introductory chapter of the book. The
bare ﬁne-structure constant is then formally given by ˛0 D lim2!1 ˛.2/, which
corresponds to moving all the way to the core of the electron through the cloud of the
pairs of particles. The divergence encountered in this limit is of no surprise as our
theories are not justiﬁed to describe nature at absolute zero distances. One, however,
may re-express the theory in terms of physically observed quantities instead of
limiting experimentally unattainable quantities. The good news about QED, and all
renormalizable theories, is that when all unrenormalized quantities are eliminated
in favor of renormalized ones, the theories become ultraviolet ﬁnite deﬁned in terms
of realistic physical quantities as the actual value of the ﬁne-structure constant and
the actual mass of the electron.
In (5.10.58)/(5.10.59) we have seen that the Coulomb potential is simply
modiﬁed, at large distances by simply renormalizing the charges. On the other hand,

An infrared cut-off may be also introduced by dimensional regularization by
working in 4 C " dimensions of spacetime with " > 0. Still another approach,
for example, is to simply restrict the momentum carried by a photon jkj > K, with

(5.11.17)
where ˙. p/ is deﬁned in (5.10.10), and, as emphasized earlier, SC. p/ depends
on the bare mass m0, while S. p/, given in (5.10.12), is deﬁned in terms of the
physical one m. Since m0 D m  ım, we conveniently have
S1
C . p/ D S1. p/  ım:
(5.11.18)

(5.11.20)
and the latter equality holds true to second order. Accordingly, if the mass term
m0  in the lagrangian density is simply rewritten as m   C ım   , and
we use the propagator S. p/, depending on the physical mass m, as we should,
as the zeroth order and treat ım in a perturbation expansion, thus generating
another, though simple, vertex part, then we may simply replace ˙. p/ in our earlier
expressions, wherever they appear, in a1; a2; a3, in h 0C j 0i, by ˙. p/Cım, and
SC. p/ by S. p/. Thus the totality of all diagrams in Fig. 5.12, with two external

and the external sources, now associated with renormalized states, i.e., states
described by spinors u; u, v; v, expressed in terms of the physical mass and satisfy
the earlier normalizations conditions, and with the photons described by appropriate
polarization vectors as before.
The external sources now become expressed in terms of renormalized
sources and hence ˝. p 0; p/ becomes replaced by .Z 2 Z 3 Z 2/1=2˝. p 0; p/

The identity k D .p 0 C m/  .p C m/, implies the vanishing of the latter
expression when sandwiched between the spinors u.p 0; 0/ and u.p; /. When this

becomes

The zero momentum transfer of the electron provides information only on the

Radiative Correction to Coulomb Scattering and Soft
Photon Contribution
We consider radiative corrections to the Coulomb scattering for non-zero momen-
tum transfer Q D p 0  p, where p; p 0 denote the initial and ﬁnal momenta of
the electron. To this end, for Q2 ¤ 0, we extend the analysis of the vertex part in
Sect. 5.11 beyond the linear term in Q to second order Q2.
42See (3.2.22), (3.2.23), (3.2.24), (3.2.25) and (3.2.26).

44When the electron is treated non-relativistically, this correction has been also carefully computed
(see Manoukian [56], p. 453 for a textbook treatment) to be:

involving a rigorously zero mass photon. This expression still depends on the
unwanted infrared cut-off K. A charged particle, however, is accompanied by very
soft photons, i.e., of arbitrary small energies and, due to the resolution involved in
any experimental set up, such very soft photons cannot be experimentally detected.
Thus to the lowest order considered above, we consider the emission of a very soft
photon in the Coulomb scattering problem of Sect. 3.4. The experimental resolution
will be deﬁned by setting an upper bound for the energy of such a very soft by .
The diagrams in Fig. 5.14 show the emission of a photon of momentum k from

Lamb Shift
Two experiments which have much stimulated the development of quantum ﬁeld
theory in the earlier days, were the observation of anomalous magnetic moment of
the electron,47 which was already derived in Sect. 5.11.2, and of the Lamb shift.48
46See, e.g., Yennie and Suura [81]. See also Manoukian [52].

48See Lamb and Retherford [40] for the early experiment.

Abelian Gauge Theories
The Lamb shift in consideration here, is the splitting between the 2 S1=2 and the
2 P1=2 levels of the hydrogen atom and is due to the interaction of the atomic
electron with radiation, that is, with the photon.49 These levels are degenerate
according to the Dirac theory.50
We provide a derivation of the Lamb shift which is physically easy to grasp,
and parallels methods often used in formulating the eigenvalue problem in quantum
mechanics courses and the reader will, hopefully, be able to easily follow. The basic
idea is that with an infrared cut-off m˛2  K  m, as discussed in Sect. 5.11, we
may use the expression of the vertex correction given in that section, by restricting
the spatial photon momentum k as follows jkj > K, and apply straightforward ﬁrst
order perturbation theory with the latter as a perturbation to the Dirac theory. On
the other for jkj < K, one is necessarily involved with a low energy non-relativistic
regime, and a straightforward, though modiﬁed perturbative treatment in this region,
may be developed and readily carried out. In this latter, case, special care needs to be
taken as the analysis leads to a logarithmic expression in the ﬁne-structure constant,
and the Coulomb potential has to be treated exactly, while radiative corrections may
be treated perturbatively. If we denote the contributions of the Lamb shift by •E >
and •E <, corresponding to both regions : jkj > K, jkj < K respectively, then
the total shift is given by •E D •E > C •E <, and the infrared cut-off K cancels
out between the two expressions.51 This leads to a residual logarithmic dependence
on the ﬁne structure constant squared. Here we should remember that the infrared
problem, in the radiative corrections to Coulomb scattering, arises from low energy
photons, and in the atom, the energy of a photon is of the order of the difference
between the energy levels of the Hydrogen atom, that is, of the order m˛2.

49Sometimes I have the feeling that there are as many derivations of the Lamb shift as there are
ﬁeld theory practitioners.
50A careful derivation of the Lamb shift was particularly carried out by Erickson and Yennie [22],
see also Fox and Yennie [26]. There are also other careful derivations in the literature- too many to
mention. A highly sophisticated and a very careful derivation, spelling out the ﬁnest of details, is
also given by Schwinger [71].
51For a treatment and a pedagogical presentation of the Lamb shift with the electron treated non-
relativistically, see Manoukian [56], pp. 391–403, which is in the spirit of Bethe’s [8] classic
treatment.

wave-functions corresponding to n above are sufﬁcient to derive it. The Lamb
shift is even of smaller magnitude, hence we may still consider non-relativistic
wavefunctions.

spin and orbital momentum in an atom, thus introducing the total angular

The expression in (5.13.38) is not the ﬁnal one for •E <. The reason is that in the
absence of the Coulomb interaction, such a term is not involved with the electron
in the atom, i.e., the electron in the Coulomb potential. Accordingly, we have to
subtract the corresponding conribution, with the substitutions HC ! p2=2m, En !
p2=2m, in the denominator in (5.13.38), from its original expression as it appears in
the latter equation. This leads to the replacement57

the matrix element h'njŒ : j'ni, in (5.13.38) for HCEn ! 0, simply factors out as h'nj'ni Œ :  D

Coulomb Gauge Formulation
In the present section, the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude in the full QED
is derived in the Coulomb gauge, in the differential form, by the application of the
quantum dynamical principle. The path integral expression then also readily follows
from the differential formalism. Gauge transformations of the vacuum-to-vacuum
transition amplitude between the Coulomb and covariant gauges is given in the next
section.
5.14.1
h 0C j 0i in the Coulomb Gauge in the Functional
Differential Form
The Coulomb gauge is deﬁned by
r  A.x/ D @iA i.x/ D 0;
(5.14.1)
for which only physical transverse degrees of freedom of the photon are quantized.
One may apply the Coulomb gauge directly to the Maxwell Lagrangian density,
by solving one of the components of A in terms of the (derivatives) of the other
components, and then varying the other two independent components. We may, for
example, solve for A3 as follows
A3 D  @1
3 @ aAa;
(5.14.2)
with a sum over a D 1; 2. Accordingly, we may simply write
•Ai D

ı i a  ıi 3 @1
3 @ a 
•Aa;
(5.14.3)
expressed solely in terms of variations of the components A1; A2, as one should.

In particular, we note that this is also zero if we replace a by 3: 3 D 0,

of A0 is zero, i.e., the latter is also a dependent ﬁeld. Hence we may quite generally

This section on gauge transformations, is based on Manoukian and Siranan [60],
which includes extensive references on the gauge problem. It also includes detailed
treatments of the so-called axial gauge nA D 0, where n is a ﬁxed vector, as
well as the Fock-Schwinger gauge xA D 0, in the full theory.67
66This is the Fourier transform of the longitudinal part of the free photon propagator D, in the
momentum description, with cut-offs, written as  kk2=Œk2.k2 C 2/.k2 C 2/.

Vertex Function and Ward-Takahashi Identity; Full
Propagators
In this section, going beyond perturbation theory, a classic identity, referred as
the Ward-Takahashi identity, is derived which relates the derivative of the vertex
function   to the exact electron propagater, and establishes, in particular, the
equality of the renormalization constants Z1 D Z 2 to all orders. This is followed
by deriving the equations satisﬁed by the electron propagator and vertex function
without recourse to perturbation theory. The spectral decomposition of the photon
propagator is then derived, generalizing the lowest order derivation given in
Sect. 5.10.2, Eq. (5.10.55), with much emphasis put on charge renormalization.
Finally an integral equation is derived for the vacuum polarization tensor.
5.16.1
Ward-Takahashi Identity
The generating functional of QED, in covariant gauges, speciﬁed by the parameter
 in the presence of an arbitrary scalar function '.x/ was given above in (5.15.31).
The electron propagator follows from this identity, by functional differentiations
deﬁning the propagator, and is given by

These give the equality of the two renormalization constants

(5.16.11)
We have seen earlier in Sect. 5.11, that to lowest order, these two renormalization
constants are equal. This is now seen to be true to all orders, and is a consequence
of the Ward Identity. Due to this equality, charge renormalization occurs via the
wavefunction renormalization constant Z3 of the photon only. This universality
property will be discussed in the next section.
In Sect. 5.16.2, the equations satisﬁed by the electron propagator and the vertex
function are derived. Here the deﬁnition of the vertex function through (5.16.4)
will be used. We have found it convenient to carry out a similar analysis for the
vacuum polarization and the photon propagator,right in this section, in the following
two subsections. In Sect. 5.16.3, the photon spectral decomposition of the photon
propagator is carried out, generalizing the low order one in (5.10.55). The equation
satisﬁed by the vacuum polarization is derived in Sect. 5.16.4.

From the deﬁnition of the exact photon propagator in (5.16.17), the ﬁrst term
necessarily includes an odd number (three) of external photon lines, for J D
0; hAi D 0. Hence from Furry’s Theorem,71 the ﬁrst term in the above equation is
zero in the absence of external sources. At this stage, we introduce the eeC kernel

Spectral Representation of the Photon Propagator,
Charge Renormalization, Coulomb Potential in Full
QED, Unordered Products of Currents
In order to derive73 a spectral representation74 of the full photon propagator, as we
did in (5.10.53), (5.10.54) and (5.10.55) to lowest order, we begin with the theory in
the Coulomb gauge. The reason why we consider ﬁrst the Coulomb gauge, is that in
this gauge only physical degrees of freedom are quantized and one is dealing with
an underlying vector space with a positive deﬁnite metric. From such an analysis,
one may then infer the structure of the photon propagator in covariant gauges.
We ﬁrst note that due to the simple fact that Œei.x/

is independent of  for x D y, we learn from (5.15.10), (5.15.11), (5.15.12),
(5.15.16), (5.15.17), and similarly, from (5.15.20), (5.15.21), (5.15.22), (5.15.18),

Renormalization is the process in which the experimentally unattainable param-
eters e0 and m0, introduced earlier as limits at absolute zero distances going all
the way to the core of the electron, are eliminated in favor of the experimentally
observed physical quantities e and m.
We, certainly, cannot claim that our present theories may be extended all the way
to absolute zero distances. I ﬁnd it rather surprising that there are still practitioners
who are surprised when pathologies (divergences) are encountered when dealing
with the physically unattainable unrenormalzed quantitites.
On the other hand, the wavefunction renormalization constants emerge, irrespec-
tive of perturbation theory, in the following manner.82
Consider the matrix elements of the ﬁelds, say,  and A, between single particle
states and the vacuum as follows

This is what quantum theory says, irrespective of perturbation theory,83 since the
ﬁelds may create other particles as well out of the vacuum, which necessitates the
presence of the normalization coefﬁcients pZ 3; pZ 2 in a probabilistic context.
One may, in turn, introduce the renormalized ﬁelds

creating, in addition to other particles, an electron and a photon, respectively, out of
the vacuum with unit amplitudes, emphasizing the particle aspect of the theory as
“free” particles, described by properly normalized wavefunctions, when emerging
into the detection regions by counters and when released by emitters.
Thus carrying out wavefunction renormalizations results in the proper normaliza-
tion of particles’ wavefunctions in describing asymptotic states. It is a remarkable
property of QED, as well as of a very special class of other cherished theories to
be discussed later, that when the process of renormalization is carried out, in which
unrenormalized expressions are eliminated in favor of the renormalized ones, the
theory is ﬁnite.
An important step in studying the full renormalized QED theory, is to eliminate
 in favor of the full vertex  , by using the integral equation for the latter given
in (5.16.30). This shows that we may, in general, write

Let us see how the basic components of the theory respond to the scalings of the
propagators and and vertex function deﬁned in (5.17.1).
From Fig. 5.17 given earlier in Sect. 5.16.2, and Fig. 5.19, we note that for the
eeC- kernel K, the combination e2

quantitites multiplied by .1=pZ 2/4 D .1=Z 2/2. That is,

as follows from (5.16.30), where we have used the Ward identity relation Z1 D Z 2.
From (5.16.21)/(5.16.22),an integral equation for the inverse of the renormalized
electron propagator may be also written. For studying its renormalizability, however,
one may use the Ward-Takahashi identity in (5.16.8) to write

propagators, the vertex function and the charge, as deﬁned above, lead simply to the
replacement of the sources by their renormalized scaled counterparts, emitting and
detecting “free” particles, making the particle aspect of the theory evident.
Various vertex connections that may occur in processes are shown in the
ﬁgure below, with the amplitudes expressed in terms of the full propagators and
the full vertex function. By introducing the renormalization scaling factors, in
deﬁning the renormalized theory, one may, in turn, express amplitudes in terms of
the full renormalized propagators, the full renormalized vertex function, and the
renormalized charge e D pZ3 e0.
Incidently, the above analysis, also shows that due to the Ward identity, the charge
is renormalized by the photon wavefunction renormalzation only: e D pZ3 e0.

taken when dealing with non-abelian gauge ﬁelds.

Fig. 5.21 These are the types of vertex connections that may occur. Expressing the propagators,
the vertex function and the charge by their renormalized counterparts, simply lead to the
replacement of the sources by their renormalized scaled counterparts as deﬁned below (5.17.11),
and the particle aspect of the theory, discussed above, becomes evident. The sources are denoted by
the half circles corresponding to electron/positron and photon emitters and detectors. By removing
the renormalized sources and the renormalized external propagators attached to them, in the
manner that was done in Sect. 5.9, as discussed above, the amplitudes A emerge expressed in
terms of the full renormalized components of the theory
5.18.1
Finiteness of the Renormalized Theory
We establish the ﬁniteness of the renormalized QED theory (Fig. 5.21) by a direct
simple way. We then consider some applications of so-called renormalization group
methods as applied to it in the next section.
To lowest order, we have encountered ultraviolet divergences in the theory when
dealing with the electron and photon self energies, as well as the vertex function.
These are shown in the ﬁgure below. With this in mind, we deﬁne the degree of
divergence of a graph as:
the number of integration variables plus the highest power of momenta in the numerator
minus the highest power of momenta in the denominator.
Due to the transversality property, in the external photon lines, of the light-light
scattering graph, a result that follows by carefully invoking gauge invariance,84 its
naïve degree of divergence of 0 is reduced to  4, and hence is ﬁnite (Fig. 5.22).

Fig. 5.22 The naïve degrees of divergence of the above graphs are, respectively, C1; 2; 0; 0.
Due to the factor p in the electron propagator, where p is the momentum of the electron on
the external lines, the degree of divergence of the graph in (a) is reduced to 0. On the other
hand, due to the very welcome two powers of momenta of the external lines of the photon, in the
polarization tensor in (b), as follows by gauge invariance, its degree of divergence is also reduced
to 0 (see Appendix IV, (IV.27) at the end of the book). Again due to gauge invariance, the degree
of divergence of the light-light scattering graph in (d) is reduced to 4, and hence is ﬁnite (see
Appendix IV, (IV.26) at the end of the book)

Fig. 5.23 Some improper graphs
The coupling parameters in QED is dimensionless and a remarkable property
of the theory is that the degree of divergence of a proper connected graph remains
the same independently of the order of perturbation theory. To this end we deﬁne a
graph to be proper if it cannot be broken into two disjoint graphs by cutting a single
photon or a single electron line. Some improper graphs are shown in Fig. 5.23.

The remarkable property of this theory that the degree of divergence of a connected

order of perturbation theory, that is with the increase of the number of internal lines,
becomes evident when d.g/ is expressed in terms of the number of external lines

To establish the ﬁniteness of the renormalized theory to any order in the
renormalized charge, we may proceed by induction.
To the above end, we have seen in Sects. 5.10 and 5.11, that to lowest order,
the renormalized electron and photon propagators as well as the renormalized
vertex functions are ﬁnite. Now we assume, as an in induction hypothesis, that
in perturbation theory, the renormalized propagators and the renormalized vertex
function are ﬁnite to all orders  .n2/ in e. This will readily allow us to study
the ﬁniteness of e2Kren, and any connected and proper graph G , with four more
external lines, to a given order n.
To the above end, we note, in reference to Figs. 5.19 and 5.21, e2Kren, and a
connected and proper graph G , with at least four external lines, may be expanded in
terms of the full renormalized propagators and the renormalized full vertex function,
and have strictly negative degrees of divergence. The only divergence that may
occur are from subgraphs within them which are self-energy insertions and vertex
corrections. These, however, have been rendered ﬁnite, by the renormalization
procedure, to any order  .n  2/, and has reduced their effective degrees of
divergence to strictly negative values, according to the induction hypothesis. Also
recall that a subgraph with only three external photon lines within them vanishes
by Furry’s theorem, that the effective degree of divergence of light-light scattering
is equal to 4, and ﬁnally note that all other subgraphs with four or more external
lines within them have strictly negative degrees of divergence. Hence e2Kren and
G , with at least four external lines, have all their subintegrations, as well as their

overall integrations ﬁnite. That is, to any given order85 n in e, e2Kren, G are ﬁnite.
Thus it remains to establish the ﬁniteness of the propagators and the vertex function
to order n as well. This is carried out in the following two subsections.86

In the induction hypothesis, we have assumed that the renormalized vertex and the
renormalized electron and photon propagators are ﬁnite, and all subgraphs in them,
are ﬁnite for all orders  .n  2/. In this subsection, we will see that this is true for
the renormalized vertex and renormalized electron propagator to order n as well. In
the next subsection we also establish this for the renormalized photon propagator.
In Fig. 5.15 of Sect. 5.16.2, a graphical representation of the vertex function was
given, and in Fig. 5.16, some graphs not contributing to the eeC-kernel K, in the
expression for the vertex function was also shown. A graphical representation of

85This is the content of a power counting theorem, due to Weinberg [80], which states that a graph
is ﬁnite if all of its corresponding subintegrations, including the overall integration, are ﬁnite. For
a pedagogical treatment of this technical problem see the author’s book on renormalization [45].
86Finiteness is understood to refer to ultraviolet ﬁniteness. The infrared problem is treated by the
inclusion of soft photons in computing transition amplitudes. In the study of propagators and the
vertex function, a non-zero photon mass is included in the analysis, as done earlier to the lowest
order, to avoid infrared divergences in intermediate steps.

reduced their effective degrees of divergence to strictly negative values, and the

0 degree of divergence, and the single subtraction in (5.18.7) renders this overall
integration ﬁnite, giving rise to a renormalized vertex ﬁnite to order n as well.
The ﬁniteness of the renormalized electron propagator, to order n, then also follows
from (5.17.9), which we recall resulted from an elementary application of the Ward-
Takahashi identity.
It remains to establish the ﬁniteness of the renormalized photon propagator to
order n. This is the subject of the next subsection.88

have preferred to treat the photon propagator by a method developed in a remarkable paper by

For energies of the order (91 GeV), corresponding to the mass of the vector
boson Z 0, this effective coupling is experimentally of the order of 1/128.91 An
estimate of the effective ﬁne-structure at such an energy is carried out in Sect. 5.19.2
taking into account those contributing quarks and the charged leptons of the three
generations by using the renormalization group.92
To study the high-energy asymptotic behavior of ˛ dren.Q2; ˛/, and hence of the
effective coupling and thus investigate the small distance behavior of the theory,
we ﬁrst summarize some of the properties associated with the vacuum polarization

90The renormalization group was introduced by Stueckelberg and Peterman [74], who also coined
the name “renormalization group”. This was followed by other important work by Gell-Mann and
Low [27], Ovsyannikov [65], Bogoliubov and Shirkov [12] and by many others.
91See, e.g., Beringer et al. [7], Mele [63], and Erler [23].
92I remember when I was a graduate student, I used to wonder, together with my fellow students,
as to why nature chooses the value 1=137 rather than some other value. Now with the rapid
development of quantum ﬁeld theory, together with higher energy experiments, we understand
this value to be a reﬂection of the energies “at which we were then”. Effectively, this coupling
changes as we move to higher energies attaining different numerical values as will be investigated
in the next subsection. Although understanding why Nature chooses the low energy numerical

A very attractive feature of the expansion in (5.19.33), which may provide a hint
to determine the value of the ﬁne-structure constant ˛, if the latter is a zero of
the beta function: ˇ.˛/ D 0,99 i.e., formally from (5.19.24),  .q.˛// D 0, then
from the just mentioned expansion we may infer that ˛ d as
ren.Q2=m2; ˛/ D q.˛/ D
˛ 0. Such a solution would mean that 1=Z 3 is also ﬁnite. This solution, in turn,
implies that the interval of integration in (5.19.39) degenerates to a point at which
 .˛ 0/ vanishes. Not considering all possibilities, another situation that may arise
is in which the integral in (5.19.39) would not diverge until ˛d as
ren.Q 2/ ! 1 as
Q2 ! 1 and 1=Z 3, as well as ˛ 0, would be inﬁnite. The ﬁne-structure constant
would then, of course, be undetermined. Finally, one may also consider the situation,
where ˛d as
ren.Q2/ ! ˛0, with the latter ﬁnite, and the Gell-Mann and Low function
 .z/ develops a zero at such a point for consistency with (5.19.39). In this case ˛
would be undetermined, and the series would sum up to a non-trivial function of
ln.Q2=m2/ which approaches ˛0 as Q2 ! 1. A key property of QED is that the
slope of
ˇ.˛/ is positive near the origin, unlike non-abelian gauge theory ones,
such as QCD, in which it is negative leading to a decrease of the effective charge
with increase of energy, instead of increasing as in QED, a concept which is referred
to as asymptotic freedom . This will be investigated in the next chapter.100
Unfortunately, the Gell-Mann and Low function of QED may not have a non-
trivial zero,101 and one would then expect that e0, which is formally deﬁned as the
physically unattainable charge “measured” right at the core of an electron, to be
inﬁnite. The divergence encountered in this limit is of no surprise as our theories are
not justiﬁed to describe nature at absolute zero distances. It is rather surprising that
some practitioners, let alone the others, still ﬁnd it surprising that one may encounter
such an inﬁnity when our theories are extended all the way with no limit. On the
other hand, to see how robust QED is, note from (5.19.33), (5.19.22), (5.19.35), or
directly from (5.19.14), (5.19.15), that to lowest order in ˛, .d1

referred as a Landau ghost. This seems to validate QED down to small distances
corresponding to enormous energies < m e645. Of course this is an estimate
obtained by truncating an inﬁnite series. But even with such a naïve estimate, this
indicates, nevertheless, that QED may be valid even to corresponding experimen-
tally unattainable small distances. At such distances, gravitation, in any case, may
99See Adler [1], and, e.g., Manoukian [44].
100One may similarly carry out an analysis of the wavefunction renormalization constant Z 2 and
of the unrenormalized mass m0 (see, e.g., [1]).
101See, e.g., Krasnikov [38].

Abelian Gauge Theories
play an important role, and extrapolating to such distances, presumably, requires
detailed generalizations of our physical theories. Operationally, QED is a very
successful theory and is one of our most cherished ones. By eliminating the
physically unattainable parameters .m0; e0/ in favor of the physically measured
ones .m; e/, as it should be done for a sensible description of the theory, and
simultaneously carrying out wavefunction renormalizations for the corresponding
particles, as a proper normalization of their wavefunctions, for their appropriate
descriptions as “free particles” when impinging on detectors, the theory turns out to
be ﬁnite.

At present available high energies, a standard of the ﬁne-structure coupling is taken
at an energy equal to the mass of the neutral Z 0 vector boson: Mz D 91:188 GeV.
An estimate of its value is given here based on all the charged leptons and all those

Scalar Boson Electrodynamics, Effective Action
and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
When the symmetry of the action is not shared by the vacuum, the symmetry is
said to be spontaneously broken. An interesting consequence of this is that for
a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, the theory involves massless spin
zero boson(s), referred as Goldstone bosons. As we will see in a spontaneously
broken symmetry, the vacuum is degenerate. Considering a continuous global
transformation, we investigate in Sect. 5.20.2 to see how these Goldstone bosons
arise. In gauge theories, abelian or non-abelian, with a priori massless vector
bosons, we have invariance under local transformations, and the broken symmetry
is local, with underlying gauge transformations existing, in particular, between
charged scalar ﬁelds and the vector bosons. In these cases, the Goldstone bosons
combine with the massless vector bosons resulting in a theory in which the vector
bosons become massive borrowing the zeroth component of their helicities from
the Goldstone bosons themselves, and the latter now become unobservable. This
is worked out in a variation of scalar boson electrodynamics. The underlying
mechanism for this transmutation is referred to as the Higgs mechanism. In the
ﬁnal theory, the number of degrees of freedom, associated with the ﬁelds, are the
same as the original version. The importance of this result in the renormalization
program, should be emphasized and the underlying idea is quite simple. We recall
that the propagator of a massless vector boson is given by

The massless propagator gives rise to damping  1=Q2 at high energies and is a
very welcome property in establishing renormalizability of a theory. The massive
one goes to a constant at high energies and renders the renormalizability of a theory
obscure. On the other hand, if the theory is gauge invariant, one may hope to infer
renormalizability of the theory from its massless vector boson counterpart. This has
been a key result in the success of present non-abelian gauge theories with massive
vector bosons.
In the following subsection, we consider a change of scalar ﬁeld variables of
integrations in a path integral of a generating functional, needed to establish the so-
called Goldstone Theorem. Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the abelian case is
treated in the following subsection with the generation of a massive vector boson.
Spontaneous symmetry breaking in non-abelian gauge theories is considered in the
next chapter.

the multiplicative factor ˝, denoting the spacetime volume, and we recover a
translational invariant theory. Finally, in the limit J ! 0, we may write
 Œ hi  D  ˝ Veff;

celebrated Goldstone Theorem.105
It is interesting to see how the symmetry of the Lagrangian density L
is
broken by the vacuum. To this end, from Wigner’s symmetry transformations
(see Sect. 2.1), the continuous transformation in (5.20.3) is implemented, in the
vector space in which the ﬁeld operators act, via a unitary operator, which for
inﬁnitesimal transformations would read as U D I  i ı" G, where G is the
generator of transformation - an operator. Then in matrix form we have the relation:
U1 U D .I C i ı" t/  which from (5.20.3) yields the relation
Œ G;   D t ;
(5.20.24)
where we recall that t is a (numerical) matrix. Upon taking the vacuum expectation
value of the above, we obtain

Abelian Gauge Theories
Hence for a vector t c which is non-zero in (5.20.23), we cannot have G jvaci
equal to zero for all of its matrix elements, showing that the symmetry is broken by
the vacuum.
As an illustration of the above result, the example of interest here is the classic
one with the following Lagrangian density involving a complex scalar ﬁeld:
L D @˚	@˚ C 2 ˚	˚  .˚	˚/2;
(5.20.26)
V D  2 ˚	˚ C .˚	˚/2:
(5.20.27)
First note that the coefﬁcient of 2 in the Lagrangian density in (5.20.26), is a “C”
rather than a “”, and this is what we need for spontaneous symmetry breaking,
i.e., for the ﬁeld ˚ to develop a non vanishing expectation value in the vacuum.106
Also to avoid problems with unboundedness of the corresponding Hamiltonian from
below,  is taken to be positive deﬁnite. Upon writing ˚ D .1 C i  2/=
p
2, the
above Lagrangian density becomes
L D 1

with ' 2 representing the Goldstone boson, involving no mass.
106We will neglect radiative corrections in the subsequent analysis. Although we are not consid-
ering radiative corrections here, the .˚	˚/2 term in the Lagrangian density is important for
renormalizability of the theory.
107Note that if the coefﬁcient of 2 is of opposite sign to the one in (5.20.26), one obtains v D 0.

Now we consider scalar boson electrodynamics with the sign of the coefﬁcient
of the parameter 2 is as given in (5.20.26). We now have a local broken symmetry,
and, as we will see below, the long range force, associated with the gauge ﬁeld,
becomes screened in which the Goldstone boson combines with the gauge ﬁeld to
create a massive one. To this end, the Lagrangian density in question is given by108

and the Goldstone boson combined with the gauge ﬁeld generating a massive vector
boson. The resulting theory describes a massive neutral scalar particle and a massive
vector boson. The scalar ﬁeld 1.x/ with non-vanishing vacuum expectation value
v is usually referred to as a Higgs ﬁeld, and the resulting massive neutral spin zero
particle as a Higgs boson. Finally the mechanism for the generation of the massive
particles, as just described, is referred as the Higgs mechanism.109 Also note that the
spin zero massive neutral particle is described by the ﬁeld '1, i.e., after the vacuum
expectation value of 1 has been subtracted out from the latter.
It is remarkable, that even if 2 D 0, radiative corrections lead to spontaneous
symmetry breaking generating again a theory with one massive neutral scalar
particle and a massive vector boson.110

Chapter 6
Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
The present chapter1 deals with the intricacies of non-abelian gauge ﬁeld theories.
We consider the extension of local gauge transformations of QED, with the gauge
group U.1/ of phase transformations, to SU.N/ groups. We recall that the group
SU.N/ means the group of symmetry transformations consisting of N  N unitary
matrices that are “special” in that they have determinant one. Unlike QED, SU.N/
involves .N2  1/ non-commuting generators, and hence ﬁeld theories involving
SU.N/ groups are referred to as non-abelian gauge ﬁeld theories, with QED being
an abelian one. Local gauge invariance imposed on a theory, under such an SU.N/
group, leads to the introduction of .N2  1/ interacting vector ﬁelds in a theory,
referred to as Yang-Mills ﬁelds, which mediate interactions between particles
carrying speciﬁc quantum numbers associated with the group. This happens in a
similar way as in QED, where local gauge invariance leads to the introduction of
the photon into a theory involving charged particles, and mediates the interaction
between charged particles. A photon, however, is electrically neutral and does not
have a direct self interaction. The vector particles of an SU.N/ group, however, do
carry speciﬁc quantum numbers, such as charge, color,... , and do respond directly
to each other, i.e., they interact. We will see in Sect. 6.1, how such local symmetry
groups of transformations are generated by insisting that one has the freedom in
carrying transformations, depending explicitly on the spacetime point, at which a
transformation is being carried out. These local gauge symmetry groups do not
only assign speciﬁc quantum numbers to the particles in consideration but also give
rise to the underlying dynamical theory of these particles, by being guided, in its
development, by the QED theory.
The quantization of Yang-Mills ﬁeld theories in the presence of matter is treated
in Sects. 6.2 and 6.3. The ﬁrst non-abelian gauge theory we consider is that
of quantum chromodynamics as the modern theory of strong interaction and is

developed in Sects. 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 6.10, 6.11, 6.12, and 6.13. It is based
on the color group SU.3/C, often denoted simply by SU.3/, involving quarks,
coming in three colors, and 8 (massless) vector particles (the gluons). We will learn
that there are many reasons why quarks should carry such a quantum number, and
why three of them (Sect. 6.4). The renormalization group, which shows how the
theory responds to scale transformations, in turn, leads to the description of the high-
energy behavior of the theory simply in terms of an effective coupling which, thanks
to the non-abelian gauge character of the theory, becomes weaker, with the increase
of energy, and eventually becomes zero, a phenomenon referred to as asymptotic
freedom. This is the subject of Sects. 6.6 and 6.7. We will see how the non-abelian
gauge character of the theory with interacting gluons is responsible for this very
welcome behavior of the theory at high energies. The smallness of the effective
coupling constant at high energies allows one to carry out perturbation expansions in
such a coupling at high energies such as in describing eeC annhilation (Sect. 6.8).
Asymptotic freedom is a key result in explaining several experiments such as the
deep inelastic experiment (Sects. 6.9, 6.10, and 6.11) where a virtual photon imparts
high energies to a proton, showing that a proton is considered to be consisting
of weakly interacting quarks, quark-antiquark pairs and gluons, collectively called
partons, within the extension of the proton. Some interesting aspects of quark and
gluon splittings, as well as the formations of QCD jets, in eeC annhilation, are
investigated as well (Sect. 6.10). Most commonly two jets are observed in opposite
directions to a quark-antiquark produced in the CM frame of the annhilating eeC
pair. Low energy (soft) gluons radiated by a parent quark (antiquark), give rise
to an enhanced probability, due to an inherited infrared divergence as in QED
(Sect. 5.12), when they are emitted in the same direction (collinear) as the parent
quark (antiquark). Such a result, based on the observation of the 2 back-to-back
jets events, not only gives a strong support of the existence of quarks but due to
the orientations of the axis of the back-to-back jets imply the spin 1/2 character of
quarks. As a consequence of asymptotic freedom, occasionally, i.e., with a smaller
probability, due to the vanishing of the effective coupling at high energies, a high
energy (hard) non-collinear gluon may be emitted as well leading to a three jets
events and so on. As quarks are not observed, it is expected that the effective
coupling between them becomes large (infrared slavery) when they separate beyond
1 fm, the approximate extension of a proton, and are thus conﬁned within the proton.
When a coupling becomes large, one has the tendency to carry out perturbation
theory in the inverse of the coupling. Lattice gauge theory, where spacetime is
considered to have a lattice structure, is quite suitable to do this and, in turn,
allows one to investigate the nature of quark conﬁnement. This underlying theory is
developed in Sects. 6.12 and 6.13.
The electroweak theory, as a uniﬁcation of the electromagnetic and weak
interactions, based on the product group SU.2/U.1/ of leptons and the underlying
vector bosons is treated in Sect. 6.14. Special attention is given to an experimental
determination of sin2 W, where W provides a measure of the mixing occurring
between the electromagnetic and weak couplings. This section includes the study of
the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking, where masses are generated for some

of the particles via the Higgs mechanism. Here by spontaneous symmetry breaking
it is meant that a symmetry of the Hamiltonian is not obeyed by the vacuum. The
problem of masses of neutrinos and the theory of “neutrino oscillations”, very much
relevant to neutrino masses and mass differences, are also presented. Quarks are
incorporated into the theory in Sect. 6.15. Special attention is also given to the
important aspect of the absence of anomalies in the standard model of elementary
particles which is based on the product group SU.3/SU.2/U.1/, as investigated
in Sect. 6.15, and is a key result for its renormalizability.
The standard model of elementary particles, based on the product of the above
three groups, just mentioned, involves three different couplings, one for each group.
The embedding of this product group into a larger group, such as SU.5/, leads to
a uniﬁcation of these couplings into a theory with a single coupling at some high
energies, and the quantization of the electromagnetic fractional charges of quarks in
units of e=3 emerges naturally. The underlying theory of this simplest grand uniﬁed
theory is developed in Sect. 6.16 and its limitations are discussed.
6.1
Concept of Gauge Fields and Internal Degrees
of Freedom: From Geometry to Dynamics
In a geometrical setting, gauge ﬁelds tell us something about systems without
actually being considered as dynamical variables and, in turn, allow one to describe
interactions between charged ﬁelds, or between ﬁelds carrying other internal
quantum numbers, such as isospin and color, or may describe the interaction of
all ﬁelds simply due to their energy-momentum content. In the present section, we
consider aspects of gauge ﬁelds associated with internal quantum numbers. The
gauge ﬁeld corresponding to the last case will be treated in an accompanying volume
by the author,2 and is due to gravity felt by all particles.
We ﬁrst consider the concept of a charged ﬁeld, i.e., a non-Hermitian ﬁeld .x/,
which, in turn, may be rewritten as  D 1 C i2 in charge space (see Fig. 6.1).
Upon a phase transformation by a phase factor #.x/ which may, in general, depend
on spacetime coordinates, it is transformed into a ﬁeld  0.x/, as shown in Fig. 6.1,
and is given by
.x/ ! ei#.x/.x/ D  0.x/;
(6.1.1)
and is referred to as a gauge transformation. This may be equivalently achieved by
the rotation of the coordinate system, of charge space, “set up” at spacetime point
x, in opposite direction. Thus local gauge transformations of a charged ﬁeld may

Fig. 6.1 Phase transformation of a charged ﬁeld in charge space with the ﬁeld, at a spacetime
point x, represented in terms of its real and imaginary parts
be described by “setting up”, at every point of spacetime x, a coordinate system
representing charge space.
The above is easily generalized to ﬁelds .x/ with several internal degrees of
freedom, represented, say, by N components corresponding to various degrees of
freedoms, which transform as
i.x/ ! .ei#.x/t/i j j.x/;
#.x/ D .#1.x/; : : : ; #M.x//;
i; j D 1; : : : ; N:
(6.1.2)
where the indices i,j specify the various components of a ﬁeld in internal space,
with M matrices ta: t D .t1; : : : ; tM/, represented by N  N matrices with basic
properties to be spelled out below. By considering local transformations, where
#.x/, is real, and as indicated, may depend on the spacetime point x, and one,
in particular, may describe both the spacetime position of a ﬁeld and its internal
(charge, isospin, color,...) state.
In order to describe dynamical theories, the derivative of a ﬁeld should be
also considered in the general case, in such a way that everything turns out to
be invariant under the transformation rule in (6.1.2) with #.x/ depending on the
spacetime points. Consider a curve parametrized by a parameter , and coordinate
labels x./ in Minkowski spacetime. The ﬁeld .x/ will, in particular, depend on
the parameter  through the dependence of x on .
At every point x of spacetime, we set up an N dimensional Euclidean space,
associated with internal space, with basis vector ﬁelds fei.x/g, and expand the ﬁeld
.x/ at the point x as follows
.x/ D i.x/ ei.x/:
(6.1.3)
We need a structure to be able to compare the relative generalized “orientation” of a
coordinate system, associated with internal space, at a spacetime point x from one
inﬁnitesimally close to it as we move along such a curve (Fig. 6.2).

Such a structure is called the connection and arises naturally in the following way.
The change of the ﬁeld .x.// as it moves along the curve may be represented
from (6.1.3) by
d.x.// D @i.x/dxei.x/ C i.x/ dei.x/:
(6.1.4)
Now dei.x/ at point x./, must vanish for dx ! 0, and it may be expanded in
terms of the basis vectors ej, i.e.,
dei D i i j.x/ ej.x/dx
(6.1.5)
The totality of the expansion coefﬁcients fi j.x/g is referred to as the connection
telling us how “fast” the coordinates get “rotated”, locally, as we move from a
spacetime point x to an inﬁnitesimally close one. The i factor in (6.1.5) is chosen
for convenience.

Hence d.x/, as the ﬁeld  itself, may be expanded in terms of the basis vectors
ei.x/ in the local coordinate system of internal space. And we learn that the partial
derivative @ has been replaced by a new structure r in the general case, referred
to as the gauge-covariant derivative, which in matrix form, may be written as

By carrying, in general, different generalized “rotations” at different spacetime
points, the ﬁeld .x/ is experiencing a myriad of different twisting and providing a
complicated induced structure of the space associated with the integral degrees of
freedom (charge, isospin, color,...) and which manifest their existence. In turn, one
may hold a structure “responsible” for such twisting of the ﬁeld, in charge space,
by introducing the concept of curvature, locally deﬁned at each spacetime point,
as a measure of the strength on such twisting. This gives rise to a geometrical
way of introducing ﬁelds that interact with charges and other physical entities
corresponding to other internal degrees of freedom.
The concept of curvature may be introduced in the following way. We ﬁrst deﬁne
the gauge-covariant derivative of .x/ along a Lorentz vector V 
V r .x/ 	 V r .x/:
(6.1.11)

From (6.1.10) and the deﬁnition in (6.1.15)), R , as a matrix, has the following
gauge transformation rule

(6.1.17)
with the second rule implying an important invariance property, where Tr.:/ 	 .:/i i.
The operator in (6.1.8), corresponding to the transformation rule given in (6.1.2),
gives rise to a representation of a continuous group whose elements are labeled by
a set of smooth parameters referred to as a Lie group. The group multiplication is
deﬁned by
exp.i #1 t/ exp.i # 2 t/ D exp.i #  t/:

In particular for any two components ta, tb of t, and a real number , this group

generators3 ta; a D 1; : : : ; N. The numericals fabc are called the structure constants
of the algebra, and due to the commutator on the left-hand side of (6.1.22),
they are anti-symmetric in the indices a, b. The following identity, obtained by
multiplying (6.1.22) by td from the right, taking the trace, and using the property of
a trace

From the last two equalities in (6.1.23), we may then infer that the structure
constants fabd are totally anti-symmetric in all of its three indices, as a result of
the odd property that results in the interchange of any two generators, ta; tb; td in
their corresponding commutation relations.
Another representation of the algebra in (6.1.22) may be provided from the

otherwise it is called non-abelian.
A gauge vector ﬁeld A.x/, referred to as a Yang-Mills ﬁeld with corresponding

This, from a geometrical setting, provides a way of introducing vector ﬁelds, as
dynamical variables, that interact with charge and physical entities corresponding
to other internal degrees of freedom carried by a given ﬁeld .x/, referred to as
a matter ﬁeld, with go deﬁning an overall coupling parameter between the ﬁelds.
The vector ﬁelds may themselves possess internal degrees of freedom themselves
and the geometrical description with an associated curvature in charge (integral
degrees of freedom) space produces naturally and in a simple way means to describe
interactions between these curious entities we call gauge ﬁelds, and all with the same
coupling parameter go.
For the subsequent treatment, we consider the parametrization #.x/ D goƒ.x/ .

One may set up a so-called kinetic energy term for the set gauge vector ﬁelds,
and, due to the invariance property on the right-hand side of (6.1.31), we are bound
to consider an expression like

(6.1.37)
up to a normalization factor, involving a direct interaction between the gauge vector
ﬁelds.
For the group U.1/ corresponding to phase transformations, describing, in
particular, electrodynamics for which the ﬁeld strength G  reduces to the ﬁeld
strength tensor F , the coupling go is identiﬁed with the electronic charge eo, and
one is dealing with an abelian gauge group, with properties

The group SU.N/, is deﬁned in terms of N  N unitary and unimodular matrices,
i.e., of determinant 1. This implies that for the transformations with group elements
as given in (6.1.8), the corresponding matrices ta must be Hermitian to satisfy the
unitary property of the group element, and must be of zero trace so that the group
elements have determinant equal to one. The latter property is easily veriﬁed since

Due to the Hermitian property of the matrices ta D a=2, with the a=2 deﬁned
in (6.1.46), the complex conjugates are given by t
a D t>
a , and the complex conju-
gate of the unitary matrix .exp.igoa ta// becomes simply .exp.igoa .ta/>//.
Also as there is no matrix S such that S a S1 D  >
a ; a D 1; : : : ; 8, we have
two inequivalent representations. This is easily seen by noting that >
8 D 8, and
the existence of such a matrix S would imply that 8 and 8 have the same
eigenvalues thus leading to a contradiction. This new transformation is deﬁned for
the complex conjugate of the ﬁelds. One then introduces the complex conjugate
transformation as
.x/ ! .exp.igoa .ta/>//.x/;
(6.1.48)
thus generating an inequivalent, that is new, representation. For SU.2/, we may
deﬁne the antisymmetric matrix S D .

ab; 
12 D C1, with
the result that for the Pauli matrices, SS1 D  >, where we note that 
abb

equivalent description for SU.2/.
The above treatment will be very useful in setting up the formalism of gauge
theories in later parts.

6.1
Concept of Gauge Fields and Internal Degrees of Freedom: From. . .

We close this section by considering some additional notions related to Lie
algebras, as well as elaborate on the structure of the generators of SU.N/.
We recall from above, that two representations are equivalent, if the correspond-
ing generators ta, t0
a are related by a similarity transformation: S ta S1 D t0
a .
A subalgebra is said to be invariant if the commutator of any one of its elements
with any element of the full algebra yields an element of the subalgebra itself (or
may be equal to zero).
An algebra which has no non-trivial invariant subalgebra is called simple. [The
full algebra and the empty set are, by deﬁnition, trivial invariant subalgebras.]
A representation is said to be reducible if it is equivalent to one involving two
(or more) sets of generators ft1
ag, ft2
a 0g, and corresponding structure constants f 1
a b c,
f 2
a 0 b 0 c 0, such that
Œt1

a b ct1
c;
Œ t2
a 0; t2
b 0 D if 2
a 0b 0c 0t2
c 0:
(6.1.49)
The latter equivalent representation is then said to be the direct sum of the two
(or more) representations, with generators ft1
ag, ft2
a 0g which would act, in turn, in
different vector spaces. Otherwise a representation is said to be irreducible.
6.1.1
Generators of SU(N)
We need to generate a complete set of N 2  1 Hermitian traceless N  N matrices.
We may start by constructing elementary matrices which have the single element 1
in every possible way skipping the diagonal elements. Thus we generate N2  N D
N.N  1/ matrices, with necessarily zeros on their diagonal. From this we will
construct Hermitian, properly normalized, matrices. We then proceed to generate
N  1 diagonal (and hence commuting) Hermitian matrices thus completing the set
of generators.
Introduce the set of matrices:
E.a; b/ D1 at the ath row and bthcolumn for a ¤ b;
and zero otherwise;
a; b D 1; : : : ; N;
(6.1.50)
thus generating N 2N matrices each with a single element 1 and zeros everywhere
else, including zeros for their diagonal elements. From these we will introduce
below properly normalized Hermitian matrices. We now generate N  1 diagonal
Hermitian traceless matrices as follows.

Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
We deﬁne these N  N matrices as

diagŒ 1; 1; : : : ; 1; k; 0; ::; 0 ;
k D 1; : : : ; .N1/:
(6.1.51)
where the number 1 appears k number of times for each k. Clearly, for k D N1
there are no zeros after the element k D NC1. We note that
Lj L k / Lj
for j < k;
Tr.L i Lj/ D 1
2 •ij
i; j; k D 1; : : : ; .N1/:
(6.1.52)
From (6.1.50), we introduce the following two sets of N.N 1/=2 Hermitian
traceless matrices
D1.a; b/ D 1
2 .E.a; b/ C E.b; a//;
D 2.a; b/ D 1
2 i .E.a; b/  E.b; a//;
(6.1.53)
1  a < b  N, which we may denote by LN; : : : ; L.N 21/, thus completing the
set of generators.
It is easy to verify that the generators L1; : : : ; L.N 21/ satisfy the normalization
condition in (6.1.24). The number .N1/ of diagonal matrices is called the rank of
the group.
SU.2/ is of rank 1, that is, it has one diagonal matrix and L1 given above
coincides with the Pauli matrix 3=2. Also L2; L3 coincide with 1=2; 2=2.
SU.3/ is of rank 2, and L1, L 2 coincide with t3 D 3=2, t8 D 8=2, where
the Gell-Mann matrices a are deﬁned in (6.1.46), and L3; : : : ; L8 coincide with the
remaining Gell-Mann matrices divided by two.

Quantization of Non-Abelian Gauge Fields
in the Coulomb Gauge
The gauge ﬁelds in non-abelian gauge theories Aa
, unlike the gauge ﬁeld in abelian
gauge theories, the photon which has no charge, necessarily involves a direct self-
interaction due to a “charge” it carries, and the simplest Lagrangian density for the
gauge ﬁelds which is invariant under non-abelian gauge transformations reﬂects this
fact.4 A simple Lagrangian density for the gauge ﬁelds is given by

Functional Fourier Transform and Transition
to Covariant Gauges; BRS Transformations
and Renormalization of Gauge Theories
In the present section, dealing with the vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitude, we
develop a functional Fourier transform, working in the Coulomb gauge which then
allows us to make a transition to covariant gauge. The ﬁnal subsection deals with
the renormalizability of the non-abelian gauge theories set up in the last section via
an elegant approach carried out via so-called BRS transformations.10
6.3.1
Functional Fourier Transform and The Coulomb Gauge
The path integral expression for h 0C j 0i, in the Coulomb gauge in (6.2.35) for
non-abelian gauge ﬁelds, as a functional Fourier transform K
a ! Aa, with the
latter now a classical ﬁeld, may be then inferred from (5.14.41), in the absence of
7Faddeev and Popov [37]. It is interesting to note that the Faddeev-Popov factor also appears in the
functional differential equation satisﬁed by h 0C j 0i, see Manoukian [86].
8See, for example, (6.1.43).
9This section is based on Manoukian [84].

emerge here is that they cancel out those contributions in the theory which would,
otherwise, destroy gauge invariance. That is, in the present quantization procedure,

because of these ghost ﬁelds a gauge invariant theory results.12 As a matter of fact
we will explicitly see in studying the gluon propagator in the next section how these
ghost ﬁelds are responsible for restoring gauge invariance of the propagator. The
ghost ﬁelds are not observable.
Now we are ready to write down the explicit effective Lagrangian density of the

12This also means that one may choose a speciﬁc gauge to make the ghost ﬁelds disappear. But
there is no need to go into it here. Feynman, in his monumental work on the quantization problem
of the gravitational ﬁeld in 1963 [40], realized the presence of such ghost ﬁelds in his non-abelian
gauge theory.

where •pZ 3, •
pQZ 3, •Z are given in (6.3.71)) involving each N loops. Accord-
ingly, we have replaced •pZ 3=pZ 3 by •pZ 3, and have done similarly for
pQZ3
and Z, where recall that these renormalization constants are all equal to one for zero
loops.
By commuting the operator Œ@.•=•Qren a/  •=.•!ren a/ with the operator f : g
above in (6.3.73), and applying it directly to IŒAren; !ren; !ren; Qren; LrenI gren, we
verify that the second equation in (6.3.68)is automatically satisﬁed on account of the
combination of the structure .Qren aC!ren a@/ appearing in I as given in (6.3.66).
On the other hand it is straightforward, though quite tedious, to verify that  .N/ˇˇˇ

identiﬁed with the above expression, i.e.,
 .N/ˇˇˇ
div D •IŒAren; !ren; !ren; Qren; LI gren.N/;
(6.3.74)
deﬁned on the right-hand side (6.3.73), satisﬁes (6.3.69), by direct application of
the functional differential operator O to the right-hand side of (6.3.73). That is,
with (6.3.69) now satisﬁed, i.e., with  .N/ˇˇˇ
div determined and hence subtracted
from  .N/, we infer the ﬁniteness of the theory up to N loops as well.18
The transversality condition of the polarization tensor, as a consequence
of (6.3.50), reduces the (naïve) degree of divergence of the graph with two
external vector lines by 2, thus leading to a degree of divergence equal to zero.
In particular, the derivative in one of the vertices involving an external ghost line
can be transposed to !, thus reducing an associated graph involving such a vertex
by one.
We will see that when fermions are included, one may encounter anomalies
of the type shown in Sect. 3.10. Such possible anomalies will be investigated in
Sect. 6.15.2, and their absence, as will be clear, are important for the renormaliz-
ability of the standard model.
Graphs of some one loop contributions to the theory of Yang-Mills ﬁelds
in the presence of matter (spinor) ﬁelds with utmost four external lines are
given in Figs. 6.4 and 6.5. For explicit one loop computations, including that of
renormalization constants, in the presence of matter (spinor) ﬁelds, with a regular-
ization procedure to justify intermediate steps in the analysis, see Sects. 6.6 and 6.7.

Quantum Chromodynamics
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the modern theory of strong interaction
with massless non-abelian gauge vector ﬁelds, referred to as Yang-Mills ﬁelds,
interacting with quarks as well as with themselves. It is based on the symmetry
color gauge group SU(3).19 The renormalization group, which shows how the
theory responds to scale transformations, in turn, leads to the description of the
high-energy behavior of the theory simply in terms of an effective coupling which,
thanks to the non-abelian gauge character of the theory, becomes weaker, with
the increase of energy, and eventually becomes zero, a phenomenon referred to as
asymptotic freedom. This has far reaching consequences as it allows one to develop
perturbation theory at high energies, in the effective coupling, and carry out various
applications which were not possible before the development of the theory, and
19Classic references for the quark description of hadrons are: Gell-Mann [52], Zweig [125], Gell-
Mann [53], and for introducing color: Fritzsch and Gell-Mann [48], Fritzsch et al. [49], see also
Han and Nambu [63] and Greenberg [58].

In the rest of this section we discuss some of the salient features of QCD and
provide a general view of some topics which will be treated in some detail in several
sections to follow.
A typical way to probe the internal structure of the proton is through electron-
proton scattering. The composite nature of the proton, as having an underlying
structure, becomes evident when one compares the differential cross sections for
elastic electron-proton scattering with the proton described as having a ﬁnite
extension to the one described as a point-like particle. The correspondingdifferential
cross sections, with a single virtual photon exchange between the electron and
proton, are given respectively, by (Fig. 6.6)

where E; E0 denote the energies of the electron before and after scattering, respec-
tively, and # denotes the scattering angle: kk0 D jkjjk0j cos #. The ﬁrst expression
above is referred to as the Rosenbluth formula and is derived in Problem 6.6 in
the target frame. The second one is obtained directly from the one carried out
for electron-muon elastic scattering in Sect. 5.9.3 (see (5.9.80)) by changing the
mass of the muon to the proton mass Mp. In both expressions (6.4.1), (6.4.2),
the mass of the electron is neglected in comparison to the mass of the proton.
Here GE.Q2/, GM.Q2/ are the electric and magnetic form factors of the proton
normalized as GE.0/ D 1, GM.0/ D 1 C , where  D 1:79 is its anomalous
magnetic moment. The obvious difference between the corresponding cross sections

vanish rapidly,21 establishes the ﬁnite extension of the proton when compared with
experiment.22 A recent value for the root-mean-square charge radius of the proton
is ' :88  1013 cm.23
The proton is described as composite of three quarks: u; u; d. The three standard
generations of quarks are given by
u charge C 2=3jej;
c charge C 2=3jej;
t charge C 2=3jej;
d charge  1=3jej;
s charge  1=3jej;
b charge  1=3jej;
making up six ﬂavors all in all, with masses satisfying: mu < md < ms < mc <
mb < mt.24
The quarks also, necessarily, carry a quantum number called color.25 There are
several reasons for this. For example the baryon resonance CC, of spin 3/ 2 and
charge C2jej, is described by the triplet of quarks .u u u/, all with spin aligned in
the ground state, and is thus given by a symmetric wavefunction in contradiction
with the Spin & Statistics theorem. On the other hand, if the quarks carry an
additional quantum number, one may form anti-symmetric linear combinations
of the product wavefunctions of .u a u b u c/ which certainly saves the day. Also
the cross section of the process eCe ! hadrons, with a single photon exchange
between the .eC; e/ - pair and the product, where the virtual photon creates quarks-
antiquarks pairs, as charged particles, with the three possible colors of SU(3),
relative to the cross section for the process eCe ! C, as we will see in
Sect. 6.5, is simply derived to be (see also Problem 6.7)

with single photon exchange as shown in part (a) in Fig. 6.7, by neglecting radiative
corrections as well as neglecting the mass of the electron and the masses of the
quarks contributing to the sum. Here s denotes the CM energy squared, and nf
denotes the number of ﬂavors to be retained in the sum with corresponding quarks
having masses squared much less than s, for justifying the neglect of their masses,
and the ei denote their charges. The critical factor 3 accounts for the three SU(3)

which compares well with the experimental result. Without the three factor, the
result will be quite contradictory. We will also see in Sect. 6.15.2 that the assignment
of three colors for quarks is essential for the internal consistency of the standard
model, as it leads to the elimination of anomalies which is important for the
renormalizability of the model.
The concept of color turns up to be of great importance. QCD is a theory
invariant under transformations in color space, by the group generators of SU(3),27
i.e., hadrons are necessarily colorless. Thus there is a built in constraint in the
theory that single quark states, carrying a color index, are not invariant under such
transformations and quarks are thus conﬁned within the hadrons.
26Ammar et al. [8].
27See Sect. 6.1 for such transformations (rotations).

Upon the increase of the energy imparted to the proton in electron-proton
scattering, beyond the resonance region,28 experimentally the reaction changes
“character” and the differential cross section for the underlying inelastic processes
may be described (Sect. 6.9) by the expression (Sect. 6.9)

k  k 0 D jkjjk 0j cos #, and W1; W2 are referred to as structure functions of the

4EE0 sin2.#=2/ > 0,  D PQ=Mp D E  E0 > 0. Such processes are shown in
part (b) of Fig. 6.7, giving rise to a general hadronic ﬁnal state. Because of the rapid
vanishing property of the electric and magnetic form factors with Q2 as discussed
below (6.4.2), it was expected that these structure functions will behave in a similar
fashion at large momentum transfer squared Q2. Early experiments,29 mentioned
before, have shown that for constant x D Q2=.2Mp/ < 1, the dimensionless
functions MpW1.Q2; /, and W2.Q2; / remain approximately constant, indepen-
dently of Q2 instead.30 This is reminiscent of scattering by point-like particles,
and thus provided evidence of point-like constituents of the proton. This led to
the development of the so-called parton model31 in which these point-like particles
within the proton are free and the virtual photon interacts with each of its charged
constituents independently,32 instead of interacting with the proton as a whole. That
is, it assumes that the deep inelastic scattering cross section may be calculated from
incoherent sums of elastic scattering processes of the electron with the constituents
of the proton (Sect. 6.10).
Experimentally,33 there are scaling violations of logarithmic type in Q2, at
present attainable high energies, and are accounted for through QCD radiative
corrections. The parton model together with the scaling violation observed provides
a picture of the proton as consisting of point-like particles which are nearly free
inside the proton and have some interaction between them, at least at present high
energies. Such an interaction between quarks supports the idea of the existence of
other constituents within the proton which we call gluons mediating the interaction

Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
between the quarks in analogy to QED and bind the quarks through them to
form hadrons. But unlike QED, the resulting theory would necessarily be a non-
abelian gauge theory one to ensure its asymptotic freedom nature consistent
with experiments. Such interactions, in turn, introduce the concept of partons as
constituents of a proton in a very general way, as shown in part (c) in the Fig. 6.7,
where in addition to the three quarks u u d, referred to as valence quarks, the
proton may contain other quark-antiquark pairs and gluons. All these constituents
are referred to as partons.34 Later we will see that about half of the momentum of
the proton is carried by the gluons.
The virtual photon impinging on the proton in the deep inelastic scattering
process shown in part (b) of Fig. 6.7, is, by deﬁnition, not on the mass shell thus it
acquires a longitudinal polarization in addition to the transverse ones. Thus one may
deﬁne two cross sections T, L associated with the transverse and longitudinal
polarizations, respectively. A measurement of the ratio R D L=T provides
overwhelming evidence of the spin 1/2 structure of the quarks (Sect. 6.9) rather than
that of spin 0.35
Before going into technical aspects of QCD and develop the underlying dynam-
ics, we would like to comment on an intriguing observation related to quarks. In
our presentation of the annihilation process eCe ! qNq in (6.4.3), in the CM,
one may naively expect that the q, Nq, produced, travel back to back and ﬁnally hit
detectors and are observed. But this is not what happens. As soon as the products q
and Nq move apart by a separation distance of the order of 1 fm, color conﬁnement
prevents them to move further apart, and the increase36 in potential energy with
separation distance breaks the pair by creating two q; Nq pairs instead, with one
pair moving essentially in the direction of the parent q and the other essentially
in the direction of the parent Nq. Such a proliferation may continue generating more
such pairs moving almost in the same directions as the parents q, and Nq. As the
transverse momenta are limited such break ups into pairs transversally are expected
to be limited.37 An emerging quark (antiquark) may, in turn, emit low energy
(soft) gluons with an enhanced probability, due to an inherited infrared divergence
as in QED (Sect. 5.12), to be emitted in the same direction as the parent quark
(antiquark). Colored particles join together into color-singlets, and two narrow jets
of such hadrons, are ﬁnally produced of well collimated hadrons, moving essentially
in the same direction as, and as if sprayed by, the parents q, and Nq, instead of
34Feynman [41, 42].
35Riordan et al. [105], Abe et al. [1], and Airapetian et al. [3].
36See Sect. 6.13.
37As a consequence of asymptotic freedom, a large momentum transfer to a constituent particle
through the exchange of a high energy gluon is suppressed by the smallness of the effective
coupling parameter. Also due the infrared-divergence problem, as in QED, the total rate for
emitting a collinear gluon, due to its masslessness, by a quark is enhanced (see, e.g., the end
of Sect. 6.10).

having a ﬁnal state of hadrons distributed isotropically (see part (d) of Fig. 6.7).38
This has not only provided further overwhelming evidence of the existence of
quarks dynamically, but due to the fact that the jet axis angular distribution is
consistent with the distribution .1 C cos2 #/, corresponding to two outgoing spin
1/2 particles,39 conﬁrmed their spin 1/2 character as well. This is investigated in
Sect. 6.10.2. As a consequence of asymptotic freedom, occasionally, i.e., with a
smaller probability, due to the vanishing of the effective coupling at high energies,
a high energy (hard) gluon may be emitted as well leading to a three jet event and
so on.
To develop the dynamics of QCD, we spell out the form of its Lagrangian density,

In high-energy QCD analysis, at an energy speciﬁed, say, by an energy scale
parameter , one may set all the masses mq of all those quarks, antiquarks q, Nq,
for which, mq <<  equal to zero. On other hand, the propagator of a quark q with
sufﬁciently heavy mass mq, behaves like .pCmq/=. p2 Cm2
q/ D O.1=mq/. The
latter is an elementary example of the decoupling41 of particles with heavy masses
and if mq >>  one carries out the analysis as if they are not part of the dynamics
and neglect their contributions. As a working hypothesis, in high-energy QCD, one
may then restrict the theory only to those quark ﬂavors with masses mq << ,
and set these masses equal to zero in comparison to the energy scale in question,
as a leading contribution. The number of relevant ﬂavors nf is thus determined
accordingly. For example in the application of eCe annihilation in (6.4.4), we have
neglected the contribution of the top quark whose mass is much larger than the
speciﬁed energy, and nf D 5.
In Sect. 6.5, eCe annihilation is studied in view of applications of the theory
with QCD radiative corrections in Sect. 6.8. Renormalized propagators and vertex
functions are determined in Sect. 6.6, and the expression of the renormalized quark-
gluon coupling is derived in Sect. 6.7.
The renormalization group is the subject matter of Sects. 6.8. DIS is considered
in general in Sect. 6.9, with application to the parton model in Sect. 6.10, and with
QCD corrections in Sect. 6.11. As the effective coupling is expected to become large
at low energies, a perturbative treatment of it at low energies is not very promising
in investigating the fundamental problem of quark conﬁnement from this approach.
An alternative approach to quark conﬁnement is through the Wilson loop and lattice
gauge theory, and is the subject matter of Sect. 6.12 and 6.13.
The effective interaction of the effective Lagrangian density deﬁned in (6.4.10)
generates the (bare) vertices in Fig. 6.8.

eCe Annihilation
A general expression is derived for eCe annihilation with a single photon exchange
between the annihilated pair and the product particles as shown below in view
of applications to the parton model in this section and in the investigation to the
contribution of QCD radiative corrections in Sect. 6.8 after having introduced the
renormalization group. At sufﬁciently high energies, we eventually neglect the mass
of the electron (positron). To the above end, the cross section for the process in the
CM frame, may be written as (jp1p2j D s=2, see (5.9.8), also (5.9.7))

determining the renormalized quark-gluon coupling to lowest order. The integrals
given in Box 6.1 with dimensional regularization, the details of which are given

evaluating self energies.

involving these divergences, and by introducing, in the process, a mass scale D 0
to deﬁne the corresponding integrals, as done in ultraviolet regularization.44

Since the left-hand side of this equation is independent of 2, this means that for all

on the right-hand side of the above equation, with each of the two terms depending

of non-abelian gauge theories is referred to as asymptotic freedom. This QCD mass
scale , is obtained experimentally as will be discussed below. The above equation

(6.7.17)
and the minus sign on the right-hand side of the equation is the origin of asymptotic
freedom. This is unlike the situation in QED, where (5.10.65) gives, for the effective
ﬁne-structure constant, the relation 2.d=d2/ ˛.2/ D C ˛2=3 C    . Higher
order loops contribution to the right-hand side of (6.7.17), may be also evaluated.
For example next to the leading term on the right-hand side of (6.7.17), due to two
loops, is given by ˇ1˛3
s .2/,47 where ˇ1 D .153  19nf/=.242/, and depends
on nf .
When 2 corresponds to an energy associated with a given process, ˛s.2/
provides an effective coupling for the theory and denotes the strength of the strong
interaction at that energy. This effective coupling must be small enough to carry out
reliable perturbative computations and the choice of the value of  is important.
It is a function of the number of ﬂavors nf retained in the theory. The effective
coupling ˛s.2/ for 2 D M2
Z, corresponding to the mass MZ ' 91 GeV, of the
Z0 vector boson, is experimentally of the order48 0.12. The mass MZ provides a
typical standard renormalization scale. The coupling parameter ˛s is determined
at some momentum transfer from various experiments such as from DIS ones,
where violation of Bjorken scaling is sensitive to the value of ˛s (as well as
from other experiments such as eCe-annihilation). Multi-loop analysis49 of the
renormalization group is then carried out to evolve such values of ˛s to the energy
scale MZ. Such analyses, in turn, require corresponding values for  to be used
consistently when solving the renormalization group equation involving the beta
function.
If, Q2 corresponds to a typical momentum squared associated with a given pro-
cess, then from the invariance property established in (6.7.15), we may use (6.7.16)
to express the effective coupling ˛s.Q2/, also referred to as running coupling, in
terms of the renormalized coupling˛s.2/ as follows
˛s.Q2/ D
˛s.2/
1 C ˇ0 ˛s.2/ ln.Q2=2/ D

ˇ0 ln.Q2=2/:

47Jones [69] and Caswell [29].
48Typically, recommendations for the value of  are: 205–221 MeV, 286–306 MeV, 329–
349 MeV, for nf
D 5; 4; 3, respectively. For the underlying phenomenology, as well as the
determination of ˛s.M 2
Z/ from experiments, see Beringer et al. [17].
49When considering more than one loop contribution to the beta function, the renormalization
scheme becomes important. The modiﬁed minimal subtraction method .MS/ mentioned above, is
the most widely used in this case.

6.8
Renormalization Group and QCD Corrections to eCe Annihilation

The second equality gives rise to a transformation of the dependence of ˛s.Q2/ on
the dimensionless coupling ˛s.2/ to a dependence on an energy scale  instead.50
6.7.1
What Part of the Dynamics is Responsible for Asymptotic
Freedom?
Unlike QED, the vector particle, the gluon, has a direct self-interaction. Therefore
it is natural to investigate the contribution of the gluon self-interaction to ˇ0
in (6.7.14) for the SU.3/ symmetry group. To isolate this contribution, let us
scale the three-gluon vertex V123 contribution to it by a parameter, say ,
which we can later set equal to one. This vertex function appears in the gluon self-
energy part ˘ .2/
ab in (6.6.11). We have seen in (6.6.17), that the self-energy part
˘ .3/
ab, involving the ghost ﬁeld in (6.6.15), must be added to it to ensure gauge
invariance. Thus we must scale the expression for .˘ .2/
ab C ˘ .3/
ab/ in (6.6.17) by
. The three-gluon vertex V123 also appears in the fermion-gluon vertex part
.2/
aij
in (6.6.22). Thus we must also scale its expression given in (6.6.24) by  as
well. An elementary algebra gives

The gluon self-interaction is thus responsible for making ˇ0 strictly positive and
responsible for asymptotic freedom. It is interesting to note that for nf D 6, the
gluon-self interaction contribution to ˇ0 is precisely twice as big as the remainder
in magnitude.

The fact that the effective coupling ˛s.Q2/ becomes weaker at high energies
allows one to use perturbation theory in this coupling. The moral in this is that
the high energy behavior of the theory, described by Q2 becoming large, has now
shifted from the dependence of the theory on the momentum Q to a dependence on
the effective coupling instead which becomes small in the high energy limit. This, as
we have seen in the previous section, is due to the non-abelian character of the gauge
ﬁeld and its inherited remarkable property one refers to as asymptotic freedom.

An elementary application of the renormalization group is to obtain the QCD
corrections to eCe annihilation to that of the parton model. The underlying result
has become quite important as the theory shows constancy, as one goes to higher
energies, of R.s/,52 deﬁned by the ratio of the cross section eCe ! hadrons to
that of eCe ! C, consistent with experiments.

obtained from the last three photon self-energy parts, of order ˛ g2, shown in
Fig. 6.11, together with the ﬁrst part corresponding to the parton model.
The main thing is that the parton model is consistent with the above description
at sufﬁciently high energies. The fact that c1 > 0 means that the approach to the
parton model is from above.
The simplicity of the parton model should, however, be emphasized as it provides
a convenient starting point for straightforward computations in QCD. The next
section is involved with the fundamental theory of deep inelastic scattering.

Deep Inelastic Scattering: Differential Cross Section
and Structure Functions
The progress that has been made over the years in physics through scattering
experiments has been quite signiﬁcant. The emergence of the endless variety of
particles by accelerators, the extraction of information on their interactions and
the determination of the structure of matter are a few of the examples concerned
with the analysis of scattering processes. Remarkable experimental and theoretical
studies of resolving the structure of nucleons through the scattering of electrons
and neutrinos off them have been, in particular, carried out. And, in the process,
dynamical evidence for the existence of point-like55 constituents was established.
To probe and unravel the structure of a proton, for example, by ep collision, via
the exchange of a photon of spacelike momentum squared Q 2, imparted to the
proton, the latter should be large enough.56
Here we are interested in the above inelastic ep scattering beyond the reso-
nance region,57 in the neighborhood of a couple of GeVs, at which experimentally
the reaction changes “character” and the scattering process may be appropriately
represented by ep ! e C “anything”, where “anything” refers to any particles
that may be created in the process with a ﬁnal large invariant mass Mn, referred
to as deep inelastic scattering, a process in which the proton loses its identity. The
interest in such a process involving the proton (or a neutron) is to choose Q2.> 0/
sufﬁciently large to unravel its underlying structure, as mentioned above, conﬁrm its
“quark description” with quarks as point-like constituents, and establish consistency
of asymptotic freedom with experiments, with quarks inside the proton being nearly
free at small distances. The process may be represented diagrammatically as shown
in Fig. 6.12, where a one photon exchange is considered as a leading contribution to
the process in question.
In the target frame, in which the ingoing proton is at rest, the momentum
transferred squared Q2 > 0 is given by Q2 D 2EE 0.1  cos #/ D 4EE 0 sin2 #=2,

The necessity of having two structure functions is due to transverse as well as
longitudinal polarization states available for virtual photons.60

We next consider the celebrated parton model to describe the above process in
question, spell out the underlying assumptions involved in it, and derive the explicit
expressions for the structure functions which show dependence only on the variable
x, and are independent of Q2. The latter condition is referred to as Bjorken scaling.
As mentioned above, experiments also show logarithmic dependence on Q2. As
we will see later, a QCD treatment of the problem, leads to explicit calculable
dependence on the logarithms of Q2. The simpler description of deep inelastic
scattering via the parton model is discussed next.
60The longitudinal polarization state arises as a consequence of the fact that for a virtual photon
Q2 ¤ 0, and the photon ceases to be massless.

6.10.1
The Parton Model
As the available invariant mass Mn of the ﬁnal state in
ep scattering is made
to increase beyond the resonance region, by high momentum transfers squared Q2,
and large , for ﬁxed values of x < 1, experimentally the dimensionless functions
MW1.x; Q2/; W2.x; Q2/, become functions of the dimensionless ratio x, deﬁned
in (6.9.8), and depend on logarithms of Q2, at present available high energies, for
given values of x,61 instead of rapidly vanishing like the elastic form factors, as
one may naïvely expect. This non-vanishing property of the structure functions is
reminiscent of scattering off point-particles. The parton model consists in assuming
that the partons within the proton, as point-like, are free and the virtual photon
interacts with each of its charged constituents independently, instead of interacting
with the proton as a whole. That is, it assumes that the deep inelastic scattering cross
section may be calculated from incoherent sums of elastic scattering processes of
the electron with the charged constituents of the proton. If we represent interactions
between partons by people holding hands, then if you pull one person you drag
everybody else along. In the parton model the situation is illustrated by part (b) of
the Fig. 1.7, in the introductory chapter, rather than by its part (a).
We will see below, that the parton model leads to the dependence of the structure
functions on the dimensionless ratio x, but are independent of Q2, a property
referred to as Bjorken scaling, and the physical signiﬁcance of this parameter
naturally arises. QCD corrections studied in the next section accounts for the actual
dependence of the structure functions on the logarithm of Q2 as well.
The momentum carried by a quark, as a fraction of the momentum of the proton,
is almost collinear with the momentum of the proton. The process for such a parton
to acquire a signiﬁcant transverse momentum through the exchange of a high energy
gluon is suppressed by the smallness of the effective coupling at large momentum
transfer. On the other hand, although the effective coupling becomes small at large
momentum transfer, a quark may emit a collinear gluon, and due to the inherit
infrared divergence associated with the masslessness of the gluons, as in QED, this
compensates the smallness of the effective coupling and such a process becomes
signiﬁcant. This is discussed at the end of the section, and in detail in the next section
in which QCD corrections, to the naïve parton model, are taken into account.
Let P (0    1), denote the fraction of momentum of the proton carried
by a parton. The differential cross section of elastic scattering of such a parton
with the electron, with one photon exchange, as shown below, is simply obtained as
61See, e.g., Eidelman et al. [35].

where we have used the deﬁnitions of the dimensionless structure functions F1; F2

constants depending only on x, and are independent of Q2. It also gives the
following equality involving structure functions63
2 x F1.x/ D F2.x/:
(6.10.7)
The above equality is quite signiﬁcant as it provides ample dynamical evidence of
the spin 1/ 2 character of quarks. To this end, using the deﬁnitions of the transverse
and longitudinal structure functions in (6.9.17), (6.9.18), we obtain for the ratio R,
deﬁned in (6.9.19), the expression R D 4M 2x 2=Q2  0 for Q2 ! 1. On the other
hand, if quarks are of spin 0, it is easily shown, as worked out in Problem 6.15, that
FT D 0, leading to exactly the opposite behavior R ! 1. Although the strict
equality in (6.10.7) does not hold in practice, the numerical data 64 for 2 x F1=F2 is
concentrated around the value one, and hence from the deﬁnition of R, this implies
consistency with a spin 1/ 2 character for quarks rather than of spin 0.65
It is worth noting that if one takes into account only the three basic quarks
(u; u; d), associated with the proton, into consideration,66 and assumes that
they occur with the same frequency, then we may write
P

i =e2/ x fi.x/

.1=3/ P

fact that P
i .e2
i =e2/ D .4=9/ C .4=9/ C .1=9/ D 1. It leads to the relation
R 1
0 dx F2.x/
D .1=3/

0 dx P
i x fi.x/. This is consistent with rough estimates
63This equality is referred to as the Callan-Gross relation [28].
64See, e.g., Bodek et al. [24].
65The presence of such spin 0 bosons, if any, in addition to spin 1/2 ones, is possibly not of
signiﬁcance.
66These quarks are referred to as valence quarks and the remaining as sea quarks, and antiquarks.

the en system (see Problem 6.16).
In the development of the parton model above, gluons, as neutral partons, did
not play any role as they have no electromagnetic charge. Hence it is expected
that the sum of the fractions of the proton’s momentum, carried by the quarks
and antiquarks, do not add up to match the momentum of the proton. The
experimental order of magnitude rough estimate
R 1
0 dx P
i x fi.x/  0:54 indicates
that approximately the other half of the momentum of the proton is carried by neutral
partons - the gluons. Hence such a result is hardly surprising. In the next section,
dealing with QCD corrections, gluons are naturally taken into account as a result of
their emissions by quarks and from the underlying QCD interactions.
Experimentally, Bjorken scaling is violated by logarithmic terms in the momen-
tum transfer squared Q2, for high values attainable in present experiments, and are
accounted for in a QCD treatment of the problem as investigated in the next section.
6.10.2
Parton Splitting
In preparation for the analysis to be carried out in the next section, which takes into
account QCD corrections to the naïve parton model, in deep inelastic scattering,
at large Q2, we investigate the nature of a quark emitting a gluon, as well as a
gluon splitting, derive the probabilities of such events and see how these modify the
corresponding parton distributions with a variation in Q2.

Also to the same leading order above, we have to take into account the radiative

quark remains a quark, it does not split into quark plus a gluon. This contribution
may be represented by an expression

QCD Jets
One of the successful applications of QCD is in providing consistent descriptions of
jet events observed in the process eeC ! hadrons.69 When a quark-antiquark
pair is initially produced in such a process, these emerging particles develop
bremsstrahlung cascades of narrowly collimated gluons, which in turn lead to the
further productions of quark-antiquark pairs. These processes continue until all
colored particles are combined into color singlet hadrons leading to the generation
of jets of hadrons at large distances. The formation of hadrons from the q; Nq pair
is called hadronization.70 When a gluon, for example, is radiated from an initially
emerging quark (antiquark) with a sufﬁciently large (hard) energy that one is able
to detect it experimentally, and with a non-zero transverse momentum, such that
its momentum is well separated (non-collinear) from the direction of the emerging
quark (antiquark) momentum after it emits the gluon,71 a system evolves into a
system of 3 jets and so on for the generation of higher jets events. By the analysis
of the angular distributions of the angular orientations of these jets, the spins of the
initial particles in the annihilation process may, in principle, be predicted.
The purpose of this subsection is to investigate formally such jet structures
as they follow from lowest order QCD. In the ﬁgure below the process of eeC
annihilation, via a single photon exchange, is given, for the production of a qNq pair,
as well as the emission of a gluon G, and the emission and re-absorption of a gluon
in the pair production process.
In the CM system of eeC, Q2 D .Q0/2, and the longitudinal momentum of
an emerging quark q in the upper diagram in part (b) of Fig. 6.15, is a fraction z
of the intermediate (virtual) quark momentum, while the longitudinal momentum of
an emerging gluon G is of fraction .1  z/, and similarly for the lower diagram
69See, e.g., Hanson et al. [64] for experimental observations of two jet events, and Brandelik et al.
[25], Berger et al. [16], and Bartel et al. [14] for three jet events.
70For speciﬁc illustrations of this, cf., Field and Feynman [46], Hoyer et al. [66], and Ali et al. [4].
71Such a gluon is referred to as a hard non-collinear gluon.

In particular, note that the expression for the cross section in (6.10.45) will

gluon is soft or hard, with the gluon moving in the same direction (collinear gluon)
as the parent quark (antiquark). On the other hand, as the value of k2

from a non-zero value, deﬁned by the condition, say, k2
?=S & ı2, where ı is a
small parameter: 0 < ı  1, as a measure of departure from a collinear behavior
of a radiated gluon, and S is some scale, the cross section will take large values
for a very soft gluon .1  z/ ' 0. Such a soft gluon will not be observable if
its energy is beyond the experimental resolution, i.e., say, for .1  z/ < , for a
small parameter: 0 <   1. In both cases where k2
? ' 0, 0  .1  z/  1,
or k2
?=S & ı2, .1  z/ < , one will be dealing with a 2-jet event where either
a gluon is moving together with a quark (antiquark) and both in almost opposite
direction to the antiquark (quark), or the quark and antiquark are moving in almost
opposite directions, and in addition a non-collinear soft gluon is radiated of energy
too low to be detected, respectively. In the CM of the eeC system, the momenta

The angular distribution: / .1 C cos2 / of the initially emerging pair q; Nq, is
that of particles of spin 1/2. This jet axis angular distribution is consistent with
experiment and is in good support of the spin 1/2 character of quarks.73 The 3-jet
event is consistent with a spin 1 for the gluon.
The advantage of deriving the expression for the 2-jet event from the 3-jet event
one, to the leading order, is that there is a detailed cancelation of infrared divergence
in part (a) of the diagrams in Fig. 6.15 of the same nature we have encountered in
Sect. 5.12, while the 3-jet one involves no such infrared divergences.

Deep Inelastic Scattering: QCD Corrections
In deep inelastic scattering, one is, in particular, working at large momentum transfer
squared Q2 to the proton. At such a given momentum transfer squared, a quark
may emit a gluon, as discussed at the end of the last section, and, in turn, a gluon
may emit other gluons or a quark-antiquark pair. Accordingly a parton density
distribution of ﬁnding a parton with fractional momentum in a range .x; x C dx/
will change, and will depend on Q2, which we denote by fi.x; Q2/, with i standing
for quarks .q/, antiquarks .Nq/, or gluons (G). Secondly, the coupling parameter
will not be simply ˛ s but becomes ˛ s.Q2/, that is, it will also depend on Q2.
Examples of the splitting of partons into other partons are shown in Fig.6.16.
Upon the increase of the momentum transfer Q2 to Q2 C •Q2, a parton, say of
type a, of longitudinal fractional momentum of the proton in .;  C d/ may emit
partons b and c : a ! b c, where parton b, say, may have a longitudinal fractional
momentum of that of the proton in a range .x; xCdx/. We denote by z the fractional
longitudinal momentum carried by daughter parton b relative to that of the parent
72See part (d) of Fig. 6.7 in Sect. 6.4.
73The explicit 2-jet structure in (6.10.51) was ﬁrst obtained in Sterman and Weinberg [111]. See
also Stevenson [112].

The additional contribution to the structure function W2 in (6.10.6), to the
parton model, due to a splitting of a parton a into partons b and c, may be extracted
from the processes in Fig. 6.16, with the point of splitting denoting a vertex in the
processes.
As we have done at the end of the last section, we introduce a splitting factor,
denoted by Pa!b c.z/, corresponding to this “break up” of
a into b and c as
follows:
“Given that a parton a, of fractional longitudinal momentum in .;  C d) of
that of the proton, is found in the proton, then Pa!b c.z/ corresponds to the process
where parton a splits into partons b and c : a ! b c, with parton b carrying a
fractional longitudinal momentum z of the parent parton a.”
It modiﬁes the parton distribution of type b with the inﬁnitesimal change Q2 !
Q2 C •Q2, as discussed below. Pa!b c.z/, we recall is referred to as a splitting
factor, and for various a; b; and c partons, they were investigated in the last section
and are spelled out in (6.10.40), (6.10.41), (6.10.42), (6.10.43).
The above allows us to write down a completeness probabilistic equation for the
change in the parton distribution fb.x; Q2/, of parton of type b, with inﬁnitesimal
increase •lnQ2 as follows: (see also (6.10.19), (6.10.44))

Read this equation as follows:
C “ For all possible partons a and c, the change of a parton b distribution,
upon inﬁnitesimal change • ln Q2, is given by the splitting of a parton a, with
fractional longitudinal momentum of the proton in .;  C d/ and with splitting
factor Pa!bc.z/, into a parton b and a parton c, where parton b has fractional
longitudinal momentum in .z; z C dz/ of the momentum of the parent a, for all
0    1, 0  z  1, such that z  D x ”. Here we have also used the effective
coupling strength to be ˛s.Q2/ at the momentum transferred squared Q2 in question
considered. B

directly from (6.11.2)

The above analysis provides us a lot of information. Let us elaborate on our
ﬁndings.
We learn that for n < 1, the moments of the parton density distributions
become independent of Q2, for Q2 ! 1, or more precisely that their limits exist,
asymptotically for truly asymptotic Q2 ! 1.

the

densities :
P
q Œ fq.x; Q2/
C
fNq.x; Q2/ ; fG.x; Q2/, vanish for large momentum transfer squared, but that they
become mainly concentrated near x D 0, such that when multiplied by x n1, for
n  3, they give very small contributions to the corresponding moments in the sense
of distributions. Such a behavior of these densities having large contributions near
x D 0, at high momentum transfer squared Q2, is well supported experimentally.
It signals the fact that correspondingly a large number of partons may acquire only
inﬁnitesimally small fractions of the momentum of the proton to sum up to one, at
high momentum transfer squared Q2.
We note that (6.11.25) is also valid for n D 1, for which A1

That is, the net number of quarks-antiquarks, of any given ﬂavor, is conserved. In
addition to the three basic quarks in a proton, there may be an arbitrary number
of quark-antiquark of various ﬂavors, within the proton, as the momentum transfer
squared Q2 is increased. We may also sum over all quarks and antiquarks to obtain

We hold a quark at a space point x, in the presence of a given classical gluon
vector ﬁelds A
a .x/.81 This means that for the quark propagator S.x; x 0/, with x,
x 0 denoting possible positions of such a quark, we must have S.x; x 0/ / ı.3/.x 
x 0/. That is, the effective Lagrangian density is not to involve a space derivative @.
Gauge invariance, in turn, then says that it does not depend on the space component
A as well. Hence, by inspection, the Lagrangian density must have the form

where  is an appropriate spinor necessary to satisfy the requirement spelled out
above, with S.x; x 0/ / ı.3/.x  x 0/ for large M.
Technically, the above may indeed be achieved by a familiar Foldy-Wouthuysen-
Tani82 transformation in QCD, which simply allows one to consider the large mass
behavior of the theory for the quarks. As we have seen above, this large M behavior
is easily written down by inspection.
To isolate ﬁeld variables associated with a quark and its antiparticle the antiquark,
we note that charge conjugation via C D i 2 0 transforms a Dirac ﬁeld, deﬁned

We are interested in deriving an expression of the static potential for the
interaction between a quark and an antiquark held (i.e., for M ! 1) at some
distance R apart. To this end, we place an antiquark at the origin
x D .0; 0; 0/,
of a coordinate system, and a quark at a distance R from it at y D .R; 0; 0/.
Accordingly, we introduce the following corresponding state for this conﬁguration,
and its corresponding time-developed one at time T:
j 0i D q	.0; R/ C.0; R/ q	.0; 0/jvaci;
(6.12.18)

where the kernel C.0; R/ will be speciﬁed below consistent with gauge invariance.

is the celebrated Wilson loop and is automatically gauge invariant since the initial
and end points of the path C coincide (a closed loop) due to the nature of the
trace operation. We see how the Wilson loop emerges from Schwinger line-integrals
associated with the quark and antiquark propagators and by ﬁnally invoking gauge
invariance, giving rise to four Schwinger line-integrals going around in a closed
loop. The “C” operation, now, simply orders the group matrices ta around the
loop. The closed loop, described by the curve C, is shown in Fig. 6.17.
We were in the course of deﬁning the transformation function h Tj 0i, where
the states j 0i, j Ti are deﬁned in (6.12.18), (6.12.19), corresponding to an
antiquark set at .0; 0; 0/ and a quark set at .R; 0; 0/. We recall that ﬁelds may
create various particles out of the vacuum in addition, in general, to creating the
particle corresponding to it. Thus the state h Tj, for example, in addition to a
quark and an antiquark, held at R and 0, respectively, at time T, may also involve
other complicated conﬁgurations. With this in mind, we may insert a completeness
relation in the deﬁnition of the above Green function in (6.12.20), to write
h  Tj 0i D

To extract the total energy of the “heavy” quark-antiquark pair,86 as just described
above, we may make the replacement T ! i T, and subsequently let T ! 1,
isolating the contribution of the lowest-energy intermediate state. In this limit, we
obtain from (6.12.27)
h  Tj 0i ! eE.R/T; T ! 1;
h 0j 0i D 1;
(6.12.28)
86Recall that the masses were taken to be large, and hence the kinetic energy p2=2M of each
particles goes to zero, as obtained from the limit of the relativistic energy, and only the mass M
survives in the latter.

to be consistently veriﬁed, involving no kinetic energies, where the 2M are the
contributions of the rest masses of the pair, and V.R/ denotes the static potential
between the pair separated by a distance R. That h 0j 0i D 1, follows from the

and the result follows from the unitarity of the matrices. Since in the ﬁnal analysis
to follow, the problem is formulated in terms of pure gauge ﬁelds, the additive 2M
term in (6.12.29), remnant of the Fermi ﬁelds, may be omitted subsequently, and one
may introduce a corresponding normalization factor in the deﬁnition of the vacuum
state.

6.13
Lattices and Quark Conﬁnement
In this section, we consider a variation of quantum ﬁeld theory we have been
considering so far, where a 4D Euclidean spacetime continuum is now replaced by
a discrete one described by a lattice, with a ﬁnite small lattice spacing playing the
87In the limitM ! 1 closed fermion loops vanish.

role of a cut-off. We will see that the lattice description gives a rise to a method for
studying the strong coupling limit of QCD. The investigation of the strong coupling
is relevant physically as it is expected that the effective coupling of QCD becomes
strong at distances large enough for the conﬁnement of quarks within hadrons. Thus
this method provides a self-consistent method for the investigation of the problem
of quark conﬁnement. From the extrapolation between this strong coupling limit
and the weak coupling one, emerging from the asymptotic free theory description,
one may be optimistic that one is dealing with the same theory observed at different
energy scales with a corresponding effective coupling.
To construct a lattice, with lattice spacing a, pick a point x in 4D Euclidean
space and draw a line of length a in a given direction and another one in its opposite
direction. Repeat this in the remaining mutually perpendicular directions. The end
points of every such lines will then provide a starting point, as x was, for repeating
the same procedure in a self evident way. This is shown in parts (a) and (b) of
Fig. 6.18. The points of intersections of the lines generated are referred to as lattice
sites. A line connecting two lattice sites is called a link. A 2D dimensional square
of area a2 bounded by four links is referred to as a plaquette as shown in parts (b)
and (c) of Fig. 6.18. No additional details on lattice description will be needed in the
sequel.
We introduce an appropriate gauge invariant action integral, in Euclidean space,
for the gauge ﬁeld in lattice theory. To this end, we deﬁne four ordered Schwinger
line-integrals U.`i/ along the links `1; `2; `3; `4, in given ﬁxed directions of

(6.13.11)
With the strategy of obtaining a gauge invariant procedure for evaluating the
expression in (6.12.32), involving the Wilson loop, integrations over the vector ﬁelds
are replaced by integrations over Schwinger line-integral associated with all the
links in the lattice, involving the vector ﬁeld. That is, we introduce a measure of
integration deﬁned as a product involving all the links in the lattice normalized to
unity
dŒ U D ˘`idU.`i/;
Z
dŒ U D 1;
(6.13.12)
and develop integration theory over such links by a gauge invariant procedure. This
is done in a straightforward manner as follows. Consider the integral
Z
dŒ U U.`j/:
(6.13.13)
This is clearly not gauge invariant unless it is identically equal to zero. According to
Box 6.3, U.`j/ has a well deﬁned gauge transformation, and hence gauge invariance
alone implies that the above integral must be zero. On the hand, consider the integral
Z
dŒ U Œ U.`i/ AB Œ U	.`j /CD:
(6.13.14)
According to the previous integral, this is zero unless `i and `j denote the same
link. Thus the above integral must be proportional to ı`i`j. The above integral, in
turn, is gauge invariant for B D C or for D D A. For B D C, summed over,
Œ U.`i/ AB Œ U	.`i/ BD D ıAD. Accordingly the above integral must be proportional
to ıBC ıAD ı`i`j. Since the trace of the identity matrix is equal to N, for the SU.N/
group, the above integral is equal to ıBC ıAD ı`i`j=N. Summarizing then, we have the
following elementary integration rules for integrations over the links in the lattice

These are the only three integrations rules we will need in the sequel. In particular,
we learn:
(i) The integral over every link vanishes.
(ii) For every integral involving a link factor U.`j/, we need a compensating factor
U	.`j/ to obtain a non-zero value for the integral.
(iii) The integral involving the pairing of two such factors, for each link, gives rise
to a factor of 1=N.

The area of each plaquette, being equal to a2, the Wilson loop going around the
sides of a rectangle of area R  T, together with the elementary integration rules in
(i) - (iii), spelled out above, dictate that we must have L  M plaquettes ﬁlling the
area enclosed by the Wilson rectangle, where L D R=a, M D T=a. We may break
the Wilson loop into the product of ordered Schwinger line-integrals going around
c.c.w., and every link, speciﬁed by U.`i/ in the Wilson loop, will then have exactly
a partner U.`i/	, coming from one of the sides of a plaquette touching the contour
of the Wilson loop at the link `i in question, as shown in part (a) of Fig. 6.19. Hence
to the leading order in the strong coupling, only the product of L  M plaquettes,
arranged as shown in part (a) in Fig. 6.19, will contribution to (6.13.8).
Since we have precisely the product of L  M plaquettes, we may infer
from (6.13.17), that h WŒ C; A i in (6.13.16), involves a factor .1=g2/LM. Also at
each link, due to the pairings U.`i/ U	.`i/ for each link, as given by the rule of
integration (ii) earlier, we get a factor .1=N/.2LMCLCM/, where .2LM C L C M/
denotes the number of links in the two dimensional rectangle of L  M plaquettes
within the Wilson loop (see Fig. 6.19). Due to the fact that the group generators are
N  N matrices, and hence the trace of the identity matrix, obtained by contracting
the Kronecker delta indices in rule (ii) of integration above, is equal to N, i.e.,

With the inverse of the lattice spacing 1=a formally playing the role of an

It is not a a priori clear that the continuum limit as obtained from lattice theory
will join smoothly its strong coupling limit, through intermediate coupling regimes,
to the weak coupling case, obtained already via the phenomenon of asymptotic
freedom, and establish that one is dealing with the same QCD theory all along. For
example, the continuum limit theory from the strong coupling limit, and through
intermediate coupling regimes, may ﬁnally lead to a constant non-vanishing value
for its limiting coupling parameter, instead of approaching zero as given by the QCD
asymptotic freedom. Analytical and numerical methods give strong support that the
latter does not happen, and that the strong coupling limit and the weak coupling case
are joined smoothly, through intermediate coupling regimes, indicating that one is
dealing with one theory at different scales,88 and QCD is not only asymptotically
free but is conﬁning as well. Although conﬁnement may be established for the
Abelian gauge theory through lattice theory in the strong coupling limit, as done
above for the non-Abelian case, there are some investigations89 indicating that the
strong coupling limit and the weak coupling one may be separated by a phase
transition and do not pertain to the same theory.
6.14
The Electroweak Theory I
In the present section, we develop the celebrated electroweak theory, starting from
the early classic Fermi theory of weak interactions. The electroweak theory is based
on the product symmetry groups SU.2/  U.1/ which is spontaneously broken to
88See, e.g., Kogut [72], Kogut et al. [73], and Creutz [32].

the U.1/ group. We then discuss how a key parameter “sin2 W” in the electroweak
theory, where W is referred to as the Weinberg angle or the weak-mixing angle,
is experimentally determined. In the classic electroweak theory the neutrino masses
are set equal to zero. Because of this, we elaborate on how the masses of neutrinos
may be generated, and develop as well a straightforward theoretical description
of “neutrino oscillations” experiments which have become quite popular in recent
years providing a clear indication of neutrino mass differences.
6.14.1
Development of the Theory: From the Fermi Theory
to the Electroweak Theory
The pioneering work on the weak interaction theory goes back to Fermi [38, 39] in
an attempt to describe ˇ decay: n ! p C e C Qe, incorporating Pauli’s postulated
particle earlier in (1930), which Pauli90 called neutron, while Fermi referred to it
later as the neutrino. Now this particle is referred to as the anti-neutrino due to the
fact that different lepton numbers are assigned to the neutrino and anti-neutrino,
consistent with other reactions, and due the opposite helicities carried by them. The
energy of the electron produced in the reaction, from a decaying neutron at rest,
varied signiﬁcantly experimentally up to the maximum energy Ee D .M2
n  M2
p C
m2
e/=2Mn, where the latter expression corresponds to the (hypothetical) reaction
involving no (anti-) neutrino, and it was accordingly expected that the neutrino is
extremely light. Thus Pauli considered it as small but actually non-zero.91
Fermi described weak interactions, by taking the interaction Hamiltonian density
to involve the product of four fermions at a point92 having the structure HI 
GFŒ. 1Oi 2/. 3Oi 4/ C h:c: where the Oi are, in general, expressed in terms
of gamma matrices, and GF is the Fermi coupling consistently given by GF D
1:166  105=GeV2. The latter constant has dimensionality of Œmass2. Thus on
dimensional grounds, a typical cross section for the scattering of four fermions will
have the behavior   .GF/2 E2, where E is the energy associated with the process,
while a formal partial wave analysis gives  . 1=E2. This unitarity bound would
then be violated for E & .GF/1=2  300 GeV. On the other hand consider some
low orders radiative contributions to the scattering of four fermions in part (a) of
Fig. 6.20.
By assigning a dimension E1 to every fermion propagator, and a dimension E4
to every loop integration, in part (a) of Fig. 6.20, we see that even when there are no
derivative couplings, the degree of divergences of the diagrams, including radiative
90See Pauli [96] for the historical account. The experimental discovery of the neutrino was made
by Reines and Cowan [104].
91In this respect, see also Perrin [97] and Fermi [38, 39].
92A quick review of the part relevant to the weak interaction in the introductory chapter in the book
is recommended.

Fig. 6.20 (a) The degrees of divergence increase with order of perturbation theory in this four
fermion scattering with a four-fermi-interaction at a point without a bound. (b) Unless the
longitudinal part of the propagator of the massive vector boson (represented by a wavy line) hitting
a vertex vanishes, the same behavior occurs as in (a). The longitudinal part will not contribute if
the vector boson is coupled to a conserved current
corrections, increase as 2; 4; : : : with the orders of the interaction, as functions
of an ultraviolet cut-off , with no bound. The theory becomes out of control to
give it any sense at all. To improve this divergence problem, an attempt was then
made to describe weak interactions by introducing, in the process, intermediate
massive vector bosons as mediators of interactions with two fermions and one vector
boson meeting at a point, similar to what one encounters in QED with a (massless)
vector boson being the photon, instead of four fermions meeting at a point of the
original Fermi theory.
Massive vector bosons have one additional polarization state than that of a
massless vector boson such as the photon. This extra polarization state, in turn,
gives rise to a longitudinal component in the massive vector propagator which, as
mentioned in the introductory chapter of the book, has, for example, the undesirable
property that the propagator does not vanish at high energies,93 unlike that of their
massless counter parts which vanish rapidly. This makes the degree of divergences
in such theories, involving non-vanishing longitudinal parts, in general, increase
with the orders of perturbation theory without bound as seen above in part (b)
of Fig. 6.20. These theories thus become again uncontrollable with no much hope
to give them any sense and carry out practical computations as one does in QED
through the renormalization programme. Details of this sort of such theories were
particularly investigated by Salam and Ward [108]. The longitudinal polarization
also behaves like k=M at high energies also giving rise to problems with the high
energy behavior of cross sections of processes involving external vector bosons. In
QED, even if a longitudinal component arises, because of a speciﬁc choice of a
gauge, this problem is eliminated in computing gauge invariant expressions because
the photon is coupled to a conserved current.
A different approach had to be taken to deal with the weak interactions as
discussed next. The emergence of a gauge invariant theory, such as QED or its

Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
generalization, where the vector bosons of the theory are a priori massless so that
problems arising from longitudinal components of massive ones are avoided, is to
be expected.
The idea of weak and electromagnetic uniﬁcation was ﬁrst advanced by
Schwinger [109] involving vector bosons, and that vacuum expectation values of
scalar ﬁelds could provide a way of breaking symmetries and generate masses for
fermions.94 In 1961, Glashow95 proposed an SU.2/  U.1/ gauge symmetry for
such a model. To deal with the problem of the masses of the vector bosons, Weinberg
[120] and independently Salam [107] proposed a renormalizable theory in which the
vector bosons are taken to be massless in the action integral, and acquire masses,
by spontaneous symmetry breaking, via the so-called Higgs mechanism, where the
Higgs boson ﬁeld has a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value. The associated
photon ﬁeld, however, remains massless, as it should, and the SU.2/  U.1/
gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to the U(1) gauge symmetry of phase
transformations of QED. This theory is popularly known as the Weinberg-Salam
electroweak theory. The meaning of all this seemingly complicated “language”, but
hopefully and eventually comprehensible for the reader, will be spelled out, together
with some of the extensions of this theory, in the remaining sections of this chapter.
With the discovery of violation of parity96 and the observation in the 1950s
that neutrinos are left-handed (and hence the anti-neutrinos are right-handed),97
the leptonic current corresponding to the outgoing electron and the anti-neutrino
in ˇ decay was taken as J D e.1  5/. To explain some processes which
were observed not to happen,98 such as  ! e C , and describe other
processes, which happened, such as  ! e C  C Q, it was inferred that there
is a different99 neutrino associated with e, , and different quantum labelings
(lepton numbers) (Table 6.1) were assigned to the pairs .e; e/, .; /, with
electronic lepton-number: Le D C1, and muonic lepton-number: L D C1, “1”
for their respective anti-particles. Separate conservation laws of electronic-type
leptons and muonic-type leptons were then assumed. This, for example, explained
why processes such as Q C p ! eC C n were not observed, while processes such
as Q C p ! C C n did happen. Landau [74], Lee and Yang [78], Salam [106],
and Wu et al. [122] assumed that the neutrino is massless. The left-handedness of
the neutrino was concluded in an experiment by Goldhaber et al. in 1958 [57]. By
the late ﬁfties, Feynman and Gell-Mann [43] and Sudarshan and Marshak [113]
suggested that all the particles massive and massless are to be taken to be left-handed
94Martin and Glashow [88], p.16. That such a uniﬁcation may lead to a renormalizable theory was
expressed by Glashow in his Ph.D. thesis in 1958 as a graduate student of Schwinger.

neutrinos have no charges. Invoking different lepton-number conservation, and due
to the very structure of the charge current in (6.14.4), these left handed lepton pairs
are considered, in a simplest possible way, as doublets of an SU.2/ group, referred
to as weak iso-doublets, with the latter group often denoted by SU.2/L to remind
us that these lepton doublets are left-handed. In setting up the original electroweak
theory, the neutrinos were assumed to be massless, as we do here,103 thus parity
violation allows only one helicity for them and the underlying theory would not
involve right-handed neutrinos. Accordingly, the right-handed leptons e
R, 
R, and

R , respectively, would not have right-handed neutrinos to be paired with and they
are considered as singlets under the group. It is convenient to denote the charged
right-handed leptons by ri; i D 1; 2; 3. The transformation rules for a (left-handed)

the third components of weak isospin for the upper and lower entries given by I3 D

transformations.

Sect. 6.14.3 of the present section.

This new quantum number is called weak hypercharge. In turn, this suggests to
introduce the new symmetry group U.1/Y to account for this quantum number.
The combined symmetry group generated thus far is then SU.2/L  U.1/Y, with Y
corresponding to the weak hypercharge. Since the weak hypercharge of the right-
handed leptons ri is twice as that of the left-handed ones `i, we have the following
transformation rules corresponding to the U.1/Y group as phase transformations

in a lagrangian density involving the above mentioned leptons.
From what we have learnt from QCD, except now we are working with an SU.2/
group and we are dealing with three vector bosons instead of eight, and from what
we have learnt from QED, except now the electromagnetic charge is replaced by
weak hypercharge, we may immediately write down the Lagrangian density L1

The Electroweak Theory I

Since g is given by g D e= sin W, we see that everything so far may be determined
in terms of the angle W. This angle is referred to as the weak-mixing angle or
Weinberg angle. Also note that Z couples to both left-handed and right-handed
leptons ei, that is, the neutral current is not a pure VA current for these leptons,106
and there is a ﬂavor universality of neutrinos Z - couplings.
The experimental determination of sin W is discussed in the next subsection.
There are aspects of the theory we have to investigate. First note that a lepton
mass term of the general structure   , for a spinor  , cannot be added to the
Lagrangian density since it would break the gauge symmetry. This is easily seen by
noting that
  D  L R C  R L;
(6.14.19)
and since left-handed and right-handed components have different transformations,
this expression is not invariant under the underlying symmetry transformation. It
suggests, however, how one may use it to generate leptonic masses. To make the
above expression invariant, we may multiply it by another doublet, referred to as a
Higgs ﬁeld, having the structure

In setting up the electroweak theory, we recall that it was originally assumed
that the neutrinos were massless, left-handed, and we have seen that the absence
of right-handed components in the theory precludes the neutrinos from acquiring
a mass. The problem of neutrino masses and their small values is investigated
in Sect. 6.14.3. This is followed by Sect. 6.14.4 dealing with neutrino oscillations
which is relevant to the masses of neutrinos. First, however, we consider an
experimental determination of sin2 W.

6.14.3
Masses of the Neutrinos and the “Seesaw Mechanism”
There is an overwhelmingly large number of experiments119 which are in favor
of no-zero neutrino masses. In the original electroweak theory, no right-handed
neutrinos where involved and thus the neutrinos remain massless under spontaneous
symmetry breaking. By assuming their existence, the neutrinos may acquire masses
through the Higgs mechanism as the charged leptons (and quarks Sect. 6.15). This
method, however, fails to account for the expected small masses of the neutrinos.
Perhaps, a far more interesting way to account for the small masses, and which
is physically appealing, is through the so-called “seesaw mechanism”120 which we
now consider.
In the “seesaw mechanism”, one assumes that lepton numbers are violated
at some high-energy scales well beyond that of the electroweak energy scale.
A simple way to describe this is to assign to each charged lepton, in the process, a
116Vilain et al. [119].
117These are obtained in the same way, e.g, as the differential cross section in Sect. 5.9.3. See
’t Hooft [116].
118The value of gA is consistent with the theoretical value of 1= 2.
119See, e.g., Davis et al. [34], Hirata et al. [65], Fukuda et al. [50], Ambrosio et al. [7],
Athanassopoulos et al. [12], and Cleveland et al. [31]. The latter, in particular, is consistent with
neutrino oscillations experiments which have been acknowledged by the 2015 Nobel Prize.
120See, e.g., Minkowski [90], Gell-Mann et al. [54], Yanagida [123], and Mohapatra and
Senjanovi´c [92].

right-handed neutrino. The underlying mechanism leads to two sets of mas-
sive Majorana particles, each with three particles, with one set corresponding to
presently observed neutrinos, and another set consisting of neutrinos with very large
masses beyond the presently available energies. We will see how these latter heavy
neutrinos are to be handled in making explicit computations in ﬁeld theory. We
recall that a Majorana ﬁeld is invariant under charge conjugation.
Recall that the charge conjugate of a spinor ﬁeld , is deﬁned by C D C >
(see Sect. 2.5), where121 C is the charge conjugation matrix. For a left-handed
spinor  L, and a right-handed one  R, we have the following relations

For simplicity of the presentation, we consider a one generation neutrino with

since we may, e.g., rewrite NC

appears twice which should be taken into account in the application of the Euler-
Lagrange equation. The ﬁrst term in (6.14.53) is referred to as a Dirac mass

term introduced into the theory. The second one is of different nature, referred to as
a Majorana mass term, and with lepton number C1 for a neutrino, we note that this
term does not conserve lepton number, and violates it by two units.

It is interesting that one may achieve small neutrino masses by the “seesaw

the same pattern as above.
6.14.4
Neutrino Oscillations: An Interlude
There are by now several experiments123 which provide clear evidence of neutrino
oscillations,124 implying that transitions occur between different neutrino ﬂavors,
and that a given neutrino ﬂavor may disappear, in a neutrino beam, and another
neutrino ﬂavor appears in an oscillatory manner depending on the distances traveled
by the neutrinos. This is understood to be caused, in general, by nonzero neutrino
masses and by so-called neutrino mixing. By neutrino mixing it is meant that the
neutrino ﬁelds may be expressed as linear combinations of neutrinos, which we
denote by .1; 2; : : :/, with speciﬁc masses .m1; m2; : : :/.
The underlying aspect of the above physical phenomenon is that the transition
probability between, say, two neutrino ﬂavors .x /; .y / : Prob Œ.x / ! .y/, is of
an oscillatory nature, depending on the distance traveled by the .x / neutrino, and
a value of one taken by this probability, at a given distance, for example, speciﬁes
the “disappearance” of the .x / neutrino.125 Considering ultra-relativistic massive
neutrinos, that is, with masses negligible in comparison to their momenta, we will
see, by a simple derivation that for transitions involving two kinds of neutrinos,
the amplitude of oscillations of the just mentioned probability is determined by the
122MR is often taken as large as 1015GeV according to a scale set up by GUT.
123See, e.g., Anselmann et al. [10], Cleveland et al. [31], Fukuda et al. [50, 51], Hampel et al. [62],
and Altmann et al. [6]. It is rather interesting to point out that the theory of neutrino oscillations
was written up in this book much earlier than the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics was announced.
124Pontecorvo [99, 100] and Maki et al. [81]. See also Pontecorvo [101] and Gribov and Pontecorvo
[59].
125That is, reduction in beam intensity of .x / neutrinos, and hence a reduction of neutrinos, in
general, will be observed if one is “looking” only for this ﬂavor.

mixing of the neutrinos, while its oscillatory nature depends on the distance traveled
by the .x/ neutrino and its energy.
In a theoretical description of a neutrino oscillating experiment, we have causally,
an emission source of an ultra-relativistic neutrino ﬂavor, followed by its propaga-
tion, described by the propagator taking into account of neutrino ﬂavor mixing, and
ﬁnally a detection source of a given ﬂavor type: emitter  propagation detection.
Before discussing the above process, let us quickly review the way one may
describe the combined process of emission, propagation and detection of a single
ultra-relativistic massive spin 1/2 particle of mass m. We know from § 3.3.1, that
given two sources  >.x/, <.x 0/ with x 0 > x 0 0 for all x 0; x 0 0, for which, the

intoducing, in the process, the Cabibbo angle, there was no need to introduce a new
coupling to deal with strangeness changing processes and the Fermi coupling GF
was taken as a universal weak interaction coupling.
To generate masses for the quarks, we may introduce three quark ﬁelds Qi >; i D

We will then eventually obtain an expression of the ﬁelds associated with the quark

Anomalies and Renormalizability
We ﬁrst consider the standard model with massless particles. Gauge invariance
is a key criterion for the renormalizability of the theory. In particular, gauge

invariance requires that currents coupled to gauge ﬁelds must be conserved and
hence implying the absence of anomalies of the type encountered in Sect. 3.10. The
renormalizability of Yang-Mills ﬁeld theories was considered in Sect. 6.3.3. Once
we include fermions, anomalies associated with the divergence of currents may
appear of the type investigated in Sect. 3.10. We will see that there are no such
anomalies in the standard model.
To the above end, we ﬁrst recall that the weak hypercharges assigned to the left-
and right-handed fermions involved in the theory are as given Table 6.4 below as
obtained from Tables 6.2 and 6.3.
We refer to the diagrams in Fig. 6.21 below, to investigate the nature of the
anomalies that one may encounter in the theory, in general.
Here we recall that in the electroweak theory, the SU.2/ gauge bosons couple
only to the left-handed currents and the U(1) gauge boson couples to the left- and
right-handed currents but with different U(1) charges. On the other hand in the
color SU.3/ theory, the gluons couple to the left- and right-handed fermions in
the same way.
For further analysis, recall the following properties: f;  5g D 0, S. p/ D
p=p2, fS. p/;  5g D 0, . 5/2 D 1, TrŒ 5 D 0, TrŒ 1  D 4. With the group
structure SU.3/  SU.2/L  U.1/Y, with the standard model in mind, we deﬁne the
following set of matrices:

(6.15.12)
where the identity I corresponds to the generator Y, and the ai; bi are some
numerical constants. Recall that the generators of SU.3/, and of SU.2/ in Fig. 6.21
are given, respectively, by ta D a=2, with the a denoting the Gell-Mann matrices
in (6.1.46), and a D a=2. The  a matrices commute with the gamma ones. In

and we note again that they vanish only if the quarks come in three colors.
This provides further evidence of three color charges needed for quarks for
consistency of the theory.
Therefore the standard model is anomaly-free, and lies on the fact that the theory
involves several fermions whose separate contributions to the anomalies cancel out,
and that quarks and leptons appear in Nature in equal numbers organize themselves
into successive generations.
Gauge invariance of transition probabilities implies that one may work with
the gauge ﬁelds in any gauge one pleases. To prove the renormalizability of
spontaneously broken electroweak theory, where the vector particles, in particular,
become massive, this gauge freedom may be invoked to choose a gauge where the
propagator of a massive vector particle of mass M, may be expressed as



C .k; I M/ has the very welcome high-energy behavior O.1=k2/ for k2 ! 1.
Thus leading a class of gauges, denoted by R, for which renormalizability of the
theory may be inferred as in QED. Thus renormalizability only results from the
underlying gauge invariance. On the other hand for  ! 1, 
C .k; I M/ simply
becomes the propagator of a massive vector particle, and one may formally infer,
by invoking gauge invariance, the renormalizability of the spontaneously broken
gauge theory with massive vector particles.

explicitly obtain the generators corresponding to the fundamental representation and

consistency of the fractional charge 1=3 assigned to the (colored) d quarks.131

to introduce the weak hypercharge as a generator of SU.5/, restricted to the

131Assignment of fractional charges to the quarks consistently as encountered here, lead eventually
to such equalities as of the magnitudes of the charge of the electron and that of the proton.

theorem provides, in turn, excellent agreement for this critical parameter between
theory and experiment as we will see in Sect. 3.13 of Volume II.
The new bosons X and Y are referred to as leptoquarks as they carry both color
and lepton numbers. The mere fact that the SU.5/ representations contain both
quarks and leptons, implies that baryon number is not conserved, and the proton can
decay. For example, u C u ! X, where, in turn, X may convert to eC and dC , i.e.,
the charge of X is 4=3. Similarly, uCd ! Y, where, in turn, Y may convert to eC
and uC , i.e., the charge of Y is 1=3.
An order of magnitude of the lifetime of the proton is readily obtained from
the expression of the muon lifetime as extracted from Problem 6.24 which is
given by  D 192 3=GF2 M 5

of uniﬁcation138 increases the theoretical estimate of the proton lifetime as it is
proportional to M4. Consistency with such a large experimental lower bound
for the proton decay is certainly a basic problem in developing grand uniﬁed
theories.
Although this unifying theory, predicts, for example, the key estimate for the

between theory and experiment that arises means that the strict equality of the

is much improved in a supersymmetric setting.

Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
The fundamental energy scale that arises in the standard model from the vacuum
expectation value of the Higgs boson sets the scale for the masses in the theory,
such as for the masses of the vector bosons.139 The enormous mass difference
between the electroweak scale 102 GeV and all the way up to the grand uniﬁed
scale 1015 GeV, referred to as the hierarchy problem, should be of concern, as it
is such an enormous shift in energy scale providing no hint as to what happens
to the physics in between. The radiative corrections to the mass squared of the
Higgs boson, as a scalar particle, are quadratically divergent,140 and hence with
a cut-off of the order of the grand uniﬁed scale, or of the Planck energy scale
1019 GeV, at which gravity is expected to be signiﬁcant, it is necessary that the
bare mass squared of the Higgs boson be correspondingly large to cancel such a
quadratic dependence on the enormous cut-off to ﬁnally obtain a ﬁnite physical
mass141 for the Higgs boson of the order of the low electroweak energy scale, in
comparison, and is highly unnatural.142 This unnatural cancelation of enormously
large numbers has been termed a facet of the hierarchy problem. Supersymmetry
is of signiﬁcance in dealing with the hierarchy problem, as in supersymmetric
ﬁeld theories, in general, cancelations of such large quadratic corrections, a priori,
occur between graphs involving particles and their supersymmetric counterparts in
a supersymmetric version of a non-supersymmetric ﬁeld theory, up to possibly of
divergences of logarithmic type which are tolerable, thus protecting a scalar particle
from acquiring a large bare mass.
Finally, we note that in the above unifying theory, the quarks and leptons are
those of the electroweak theory involving no right-handed neutrinos to generate
masses to the presently known neutrinos by the “seesaw mechanism” as discussed
in Sect. 6.14.3. The larger group SO.10/, which has been also much studied over
years as a grand uniﬁed theory, accommodates a right-handed neutrino and the
“seesaw mechanism” may be then applied. Several other grand uniﬁed theories have
been also proposed in recent years and we refer the reader to the vast literature
on the subject.143 The remarkable simplicity of the SU.5/ grand unifying scheme
should be noted, and that it provides the very ﬁrst steps for the development of
more complicated grand unifying schemes that may meet the challenge set up by
experiments.
139We recall how accurate were the masses of the massive vector bosons obtained theoretically
directly at the tree level via the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs ﬁeld given through
Eq. (6.14.34) which, in turn, is expressed simply in terms of the Fermi coupling.
140Veltman [118].
141Aad et al. [2] and Chatrchyan et al. [30].
142As mentioned above, the question, in turn, arises as to what amounts for such an enormous
difference between the energy scale of grand uniﬁcation and the energy scale that characterizes the
standard model.
143See, e.g., Beringer et al. [17] and references therein.

The Dirac Formalism

with the Dirac formalism for the description of spin 1/ 2 particles. For derivations

where ˙ with ˙ means spin projection in the same direction as of the momentum,
while ˙ with

phases, the latter are related by a parity transformation:  0u.p; C1/

u.Cp; C1/,  0u.Cp; 1/ ! u.p; 1/, with spin and momentum in opposite
directions to spin and momentum in the same direction, and vice versa. Accordingly,
if parity is not conserved, nature picks up only one of the helicities.
The interest in the equations in (I.25) is that .I C  5/=2 projects out a state
corresponding to a right-handed particle, with spin along its momentum, while
.I   5/=2 projects out a left-handed one, with spin in opposite direction to
its momentum. The corresponding particles are referred to, respectively, as right-
handed and left-handed. The situation may be demonstrated as shown in Fig. I.1

which obviously exist for n > m > 0, where  .z/ is the gamma function.
Now we consider more complicated integrals involving an additional (external)
momentum. For convenience, we enumerate the type of integrals considered.

(II.14)
where, as indicated, M 2. p 2/ may be a function of p 2. To show that this integral
is indeed zero, we take its derivative with respect to p. It is easily checked
that the derivative of the integrand is zero giving @I. p 2/=@p
D
0. With
the boundary condition that I.0/ D 0, gives I. p 2/ = 0. Here we note that if
we deﬁne the degree of divergence of an integral as the of power of k in the
numerator minus the power of k in the denominator plus four, then the degree
of divergence of the above integral restricted to the ﬁrst term is zero. This then
allows one to make a shift of the integration variable k ! k C p in the ﬁrst
part of the integral just mentioned leading to the net result zero for the integral
I. p 2/. Of course such a shift of an integration variable is obviously valid if the
degree of divergence of an integral is negative.
The degree of divergence of the following integrals are negative, thus by
making a shift of the integration variable lead to the stated results by using, in
the process, (II.8):

(II.19)
and determine C. p 2/ and D. p 2/. To this end, note that the integral is zero for
p D 0 since the resulting integrand is an odd function of k. Secondly, note
that the degree of divergence of the integral restricted to the ﬁrst term involving
kkk is positive and hence we cannot simply make a shift of the integration
variable
k to k C p in evaluating this term. What we do instead is take the
derivative of the integral with respect to p as shown below.

The ﬁrst term leads to an integral of degree of divergence 1, and the second to a

p C k here. Continuing in this manner and using any of the integrations obtained
before (II.18), we obtain for the derivative of the integral on the left-hand side

The reader is strongly encouraged to go through the above details and realize the
simplicity in evaluating these integrals by the method just developed.
Integrands appearing in (II.8)... (II.24) arise when one combines the product of
two (or more) factors such as
1
.k  p/2 C M 2

k2 C m2 ;
(II.25)
into one factor in the following manner. To this end, for two c-numbers A; B,
consider the integral

As an interesting example for applying this formula and comparing it with
the method developed above for evaluating some integrals, we will evaluate the
following

Let us apply the method developed earlier ﬁrst to evaluate this integral by differen-
tiating it with respect to p. This gives

where we have used the fact that the degree of divergence of the integral in (II.29)
restricted to the ﬁrst term is zero to make a shift of the integration variable in
the ﬁrst, and then used (II.24), to ﬁnally obtain I. p 2/. Now follow the explicit
evaluation of (II.28).
Let us use (II.27). This leads from the latter to the evaluation of the integral

that p 2.1  2x/ dx D d . p 2x.1  x//, we may carry out the integration over x
in (II.31) by parts, and then carry out the resulting integral over k using (II.8). The
integral on the right-hand side of (II.31), as the coefﬁcient of p 2, then becomes

(II.32)
The last integral is zero since the change of variablex ! 1  x gives minus the
same integral. That is, the integral on the right-hand side of (II.31) is zero and we
obtain the result given in (II.30).

Appendix V
Renormalization and the Underlying
Subtractions
In this appendix, we learn how to deﬁne the renormalized Feynman integral,
associated with a graph, given its unrenormalized Feynman integrand.
One deﬁnes a graph by specifying a set of vertices V D .1; : : : ; r/, a set of
lines L D .`1; : : : ; `s/, together with a rule describing which of these lines join
which of the vertices. By removing all the external lines of a graph, one generates
an amputated graph. Vertices fig in an amputated graph, to which external lines
were attached are referred to as external vertices, while their remaining vertices
are referred to as internal vertices. From now on we will consider only amputated
graphs and amputated subdiagrams with the latter to be deﬁned below. By specifying
a subset V 0  V of the vertices and all the lines in L of a graph G that join these
vertices, but not those lines joining vertices not in V 0, one deﬁnes a subgraph G 0 of
G. By specifying a subset V 0  V of the vertices and not necessarily all the lines
in L of the original graph that join these vertices, one deﬁnes a subdiagram g of
G. Examples of an (amputated) graph, together with a subgraph and a subdiagram
are given in Fig. V.1.
A vertex of an amputated subdiagram at which an external line was attached
previous to the removal of the latter is referred to as an external vertex, while
the other vertices are referred to as internal vertices. All the lines of an amputated
subdiagram are, by deﬁnition, internal lines.
A subdiagram is called disconnected if it is connected out of two or more
subdiagrams in which any two of them have no vertices and no lines in common.
If upon cutting or removing an internal line of a subdiagram, the number of the
connected parts of the latter is increased, it is called an improper line. A subdiagram
is called a proper connected subdiagram, if it is connected and has no improper
lines. A subdiagram is called proper but not connected, if it is constructed out of two
or more subdiagrams none of which have improper lines. Two subdiagrams g1; g2
speciﬁed by the pairs .V1; L1/, .V2; L2/, for which V1  V2, and L1  L2, we
write g1  g2. In this work, the symbol  may include equality, while ¦ is used
to exclude an equality.

Fig. V.1 A graph is introduced in part (a). The dashed lines stand for external lines that have
been removed deﬁning an amputated graph. Vertices at f and d represent external vertices for the
graph, while the remaining ones represent internal vertices. A subgraph is introduced in part (b)
with four external lines that have been removed. In this case f and b represent external vertices of
the subgraph, while a represents an internal vertex. A subdiagram is introduced in part (c) where
one of the lines joining the vertices at a and b has been cut with the resulting two external lines
removed. The vertices at a, b and f represent external vertices for the subdiagram in part (c)
Since the subtractions of renormalization involve a sequence of Taylor expan-
sions in the momenta associated with the external lines of a proper graph and in the
momenta of the external momenta of proper subdiagrams, we have to spell out how
such momenta are deﬁned for the proper graph and the proper subdiagrams. This is
considered next.

total external momenta fq1; : : : ; qmg 	 qG, qr D .q0

(V.2)
where the sum is over all i corresponding to all the vertices with lines ` joining
them to the external vertex j. For an internal vertex, the right-hand side of the
above ﬁrst equality is set equal to zero.
A line joining a vertex i to a vertex j in G, will be represented by

be the set of momenta carried by these lines. Then we assign to the veretx j a
polynomial Pj D Pj.Qij1; : : : ; Qrj j srj j/. The unrenormalized Feynman integrand
associated with the proper and connected graph G, up to an overall multiplicative
constants (involving couplings, etc.), is of the form

(V.4)
We introduce canonical variables,4 by choosing
X

and
qij ` D ui  uj;
(V.5)
where ui; uj are four vectors, and the second equality above means that the external
variables of the lines joining a vertex i to the vertex j are all chosen to be equal.
In particular, we also note that (V.2), (V.5) imply that
X
i`
G kij ` D 0;
X
ij`
G kij ` D 0;
(V.6)
with the latter deﬁning a constraint. Equation (V.5) provides .# V 1/ independent
solutions of the .# V  1/ independent differences .uj  ui/, where # V denotes
the number of vertices. We may write the variables qij ` as a linear combination of
the elements in fqG
j g 	 qG : qij ` D qij `.qG/.
If 4n denotes the number of independent integration variables associated with
G then n D # L G  # V G C 1. Eqs. (V.6) imply that only n of the # L G kij ` are
independent, and we may write kij ` D kij `.k/. We provide examples of canonical
decompositions of some graphs and some diagrams obtained from them.
Example V.1 Consider the graph in Fig. V.2a, with external vertices at 1 and 2. At

Once the external momentum variables qG
ij ` of the graph G in question, as well as
the external variables q g
ij ` of all proper and connected subdiagrams of G have been
deﬁned, one may deﬁne Taylor operations TG, Tg in their external momenta about
the origin up to their (superﬁcial) degree of divergences. The (superﬁcial) degree
of divergence d.g/ of a proper connected subdiagram g involving 4 t integration
variables is deﬁned by
d.g/ D deg Ig C 4 t:
(V.30)
where“deg” is here deﬁned by scaling the integration variables in Ig by a
parameter  and by considering the power of  for  ! 1. For a proper not
necessarily connected subdiagram g involving proper and connected subdiagrams
g1; g2; : : : ; gs, the (superﬁcial) degree of divergence of g is deﬁned by d.g/ D
Ps
iD1 d.gi/.
We are particularly interested in the consecutive application of two or more
Taylor operations. To this end, consider two proper subdiagrams g 0 ¤ g, we deﬁne
Tg Tg0Ig by the following procedure. We ﬁrst note that
Tg0 Ig0 D F.Q; kg0; qg0/;
(V.31)
where the function Ig=g0F.Q; kg0; qg0/ should be now expressed in terms the internal
k g, and external qg variables of g. To do this, we use (V.17), and the functional
relations kg0 D kg0.kg/, qg0 D qg0.kg; qg/. The application of consecutive several
Taylor operation Tg0s : : : Tg0
1 Ig0s for proper subdiagrams g0
1 ¤ : : : ¤ g0
s is similarly
handled.
Now we are ready to deﬁne the renormalized R Feynman integrand involving
Taylor operations, about the origin, applied to the external variables of a proper
and connected graph G, and to its proper, not necessarily connected subdiagrams.
The external variables of such subdiagrams constitute the totality of the external
variables of its connected parts.
The renormalized Feynman integrand R, involving subtractions, is deﬁned as
follows:

Renormalization and the Underlying Subtractions
(i) If g 
 D, then g is a proper, but not necessarily connected, subdiagram of G
with d.g/  0. If d.G/  0, then one of the elements of D may be G itself.
(ii) If g1; g2 
 D, then either g1 ¤ g2 or g2 ¤ g1. If g1 ¤ g2, then the ordering
of the Taylor operations in (V.32) is as : : : .Tg2/ : : : .Tg1/ : : : .
Note that the Taylor operations are applied directly to the integrand I G in the
momentum representation, and no questions of divergences arise in (V.32). The
sets D are called renormalization sets.
We see that an important task is to ﬁnd the renormalization sets D associated
with a graph G. For example, for the graph G in Fig. V.3, the normalization
sets, say for simplicity for scalar ﬁeld self-coupling in 6 dimensional spacetime,
are: fGg; fG; g1g; fG; g2g; fg1g; fg2g. Note that the subdiagram obtained from the
graph G by cutting (i.e, removing) line 23 has a degree of divergence -2 in 6
dimensions. Note also that fg1; g2g is not a D set, since neither g1 ¤ g2 nor
g2 ¤ g1. The renormalized integrand then becomes

Remarks
(1) The key point in establishing the ﬁniteness of the renormalized Feynman
integral in Euclidean space for massive particles 2
ij ` ¤ 0 is to show that when
any subset of the integration variables become large, one can always group the
Taylor operations in a particular way, and show that the renormalized integrand
has just right behavior and vanishes rapidly asymptotically as a function of these
variables and guaranties its integrability. A proof of this is given in Manoukian
[3]). For a proof of the ﬁniteness of the renormalized in Minkowski space, in
the sense of distributions, see also the latter reference, and for a simpler and
direct proof see Manoukian [4, 5], including for zero-mass particles.
(2) Once the ﬁniteness of the renormalized theory is established, with subtractions
at the origin, it may be then normalized at other points.
(3) The above subtraction procedure may be reduced to the one referred to as
the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmermann scheme, and for the proof of the
underlying theorem, referred to as the “Unifying Theorem of Renormaliza-
tion”,5 see Manoukian [3].
(4) The renormalization procedure with subtractions is equivalent to adding terms
to the original Lagrangian, referred to as counter-terms, and adjusting their
numerical coefﬁcients in such a way that parameters appearing in the theory
5See also Zeidler [8, p. 972] and Figueroa and Gracia-Bondia [1].

V
Renormalization and the Underlying Subtractions

(masses, couplings,...) are taken from experiments. For the equivalence of the
subtraction scheme and the counter-term formalism, see Manoukian [2, 3]. This
establishes the criterion of renormalizabilty and is expressed as follows. One, a
prioi, may generalize the original Lagrangian density by adding to it new terms.
If the counter-terms needed to make the (modiﬁed) theory ﬁnite and consistent,
have the same structures as of terms in the (modiﬁed) Lagrangian density and
are ﬁnite in number, then the (modiﬁed) theory is called renormalizable. In the
latter case only a ﬁnite number of parameters are taken from experiments. For
example in QED, the counter-terms have exactly the same structures of terms in
the Dirac-Maxwell Lagrangian density and the values of the two parameters the
(renormalized) mass and (renormalized) charge of the electron are taken from
experiments. If the number of counter-terms needed are inﬁnite in number, then
one may need to ﬁx an inﬁnite number of parameters and the theory loses its
predictive power.
(5) Asymptotic behavior of the renormalized theory, such as at high-energy, or for
small masses, or for large masses, and other variations, as well as of the proof
of the decoupling theorem consistently used in QCD, see Manoukian [3].
(6) Regarding the author’s work in the completion of the renormalization program
stemming that of Salam’s, Streater [7] writes: “It is the end of a long chapter
in the history of physics”. He also states: “Physicists found Salam’s [method]
easier than the BPH one”.
(7) When you write down a local Lagrangian density, the parameters (couplings,
masses,...) are introduced at inﬁnite energies (speciﬁed by large ultraviolet cut-
offs) and are unattainable. Renormalization theory eliminates these parameters
in favor of physically measurable parameters.

With n given in (4.2.24), we may refer to (2.2.11) to infer that R33 D cos ,
R23 D sin  sin , R13 D cos  sin , and use the fact that sinh ˛ D
jp j=m, to conclude that the state in (4.2.23) becomes multiplied by p by
the action of P, where p is given in (4.2.33). On the other hand, Y0 D
P 0 cosh ˛ CP 3 sinh ˛, as given in (4.2.30), and m cosh˛ D

which veriﬁes (4.2.32) for the application of P 0 as well.

From (4.2.14) we note that W 0 commutes with J. On the other hand,
consider the expression: K.˛/ D exp Œ i˛ J03 W0exp Œ i˛ J03 , with B.C.
K.0/ D W0.
We explicitly have K0.0/ D W3, K00.˛/ D K.˛/, with the
latter two equalities following from (4.2.14), from which we obtain K.˛/ D
W3 sinh ˛ C W0 cosh ˛. This leads to the statement of the problem by ﬁnally
noting that h 0jW0 D 0, h 0jW3 D mh 0; j.

If W D 0, then we may write W  D 0  P , and there is nothing to
prove. Accordingly suppose that W  ¤ 0, that is, jW0j D jWj > 0. From
the orthogonality of the two vectors: P 0 W0 D jPj jWj cos  or jW0jjP 0j D
jPj jWj j cos j from which j cos j D 1. That is, W D  P. On the other
hand, the relation W 0P 0 D W  P D jPj2 also implies that we also have
W 0 D P 0, since P 0 D jPj > 0, which completes the proof.

completeness relation:
PŒ1; 2 C PŒ1 C ; 2 C PŒ1; 2 C  C PŒ1 C ; 2 C  D 1:
If only one spin is measured:PŒ1;  D PŒ1; 2 C PŒ1; 2 C  D 1=2,
and similarly PŒ; 2 D 1=2. The obvious correlation between the two
electron spins, that is the measurement of the spin of one is correlated
with the spin value of the other, is expressed by the fundamental general
relation PŒ1; 2 ¤ PŒ1;  PŒ; 2. It is interesting to note that the above
probabilities are independent of the speed ˇ of the particles. This is due to
the special choice of axes of measurements and spin orientations chosen in
the problem. More generally polarization correlations depend on the speed of
the underlying particles (see, e.g., Sect. 5.9.2 and references therein).

Finally carrying out the z-integral, followed by the use of the integral (III.12),

in the process, an odd integral in k equal to zero. Finally the xz – integrals
are readily carried out as above leading to the stated result.
6.9. By using the Feynman parameter representation in Problem 6.8 above, and
shifting the k-integration variable again, the denominator of the integrand
becomes simply

after setting an odd integral in k equal to zero. The integral involving the kk

6.10. It is sufﬁcient to spell out, the general infra-red singular structure of the
function hIR.2
D 0=Q2; ı/. To this end, we refer to the right-hand sides of the
integrals in Box 6.2 of the regularized integrals in Sect. 6.6. If an integral
depends on p
1 , then multiplying it, by p
1 gives zero, and if multiplied
by either, p2 , or Q, give a factor Q2 which cancels out the factor 1=Q2
multiplying .2
D 0=Q2/ı=2. Similar statements follow if the integral depends
on p
2 . On the other hand, if we multiply the ﬁrst integral by either p1p2 or Q2,
these terms cancel out again the 1=Q2 factor just mentioned. That is, in all the
terms contributing to the fermion-gluon vertex, the 1=Q2 factor multiplying
.2
D 0=Q2/ı=2 is canceled out in the infra-red regularized part. The most infra-
red singular part in evaluating the vertex function comes from the ﬁrst integral
in the Table now involving the factor

6.15. The vertex function V for a spin 0 boson going from momentum p to
p 0 after interacting with the virtual photon must be of the form p C p 0,
with equal coefﬁcients due to gauge invariance: Q. p C p 0
/ D 0, where
Q D p 0  p. On the other hand, from the deﬁnition of Q, we may rewrite
. p C p 0/ D 2. p C Q=2/:
Also pQ D Q2=2, i.e., Q=2 D p Q Q=Q2. Thus the vertex function for
the spin 0 boson, consistent with gauge invariance, is simply proportional to
. p  pQ Q=Q2/. This in turn gives rise to a structure function contribution
proportional to
. p  pQ Q=Q2/. p  p Q Q=Q2/;
involving no .  QQ=Q2/ term. This leads to W1 D 0 and the results

Upon integration over x, this gives the relation stated in the problem.

6.22. If a priori C is zero, then by a speciﬁc choice of the transformation
in (6.14.23), as a phase factor, we may remove any phase that 0 may have
upon the transformation in. Otherwise, suppose that C ¤ 0. Using the
identity
expŒi'n  =2 D cos.'=2/ C i n   sin.'=2/;

Upon considering the expression

the resulting upper entry to zero, i.e., by setting

cos.'=2/ C i n3 sin.'=2/

C .i n1 C n2/ sin.'=2/.a C i b/ D 0;
that this equation has always a solution for all real a and b, by appropriate
choices of n1; n2; n3, and '. This makes the resulting upper entry equal to
zero in vacuum expectation value. Any phase that may arise from the second
row of the transformation above may be removed by the appropriate choice
of the transformation in (6.14.23), giving ﬁnally a real non-negative ﬁeld for
the lower entry in vacuum expectation value. Thus such transformations give
rise to a ﬁeld as given on the right-hand side of (6.14.26), with its components
satisfying Eq. (6.14.27).
