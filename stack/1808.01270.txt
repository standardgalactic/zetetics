TOPOLOGICAL MODELS OF ARITHMETIC
ALI ENAYAT, JOEL DAVID HAMKINS, AND BARTOSZ WCIS LO
Abstract. Ali Enayat had asked whether there is a model of PA (Peano Arithmetic) that
can be represented as ⟨Q, ⊕, ⊗⟩, where ⊕and ⊗are continuous functions on the rationals
Q. We prove, aﬃrmatively, that indeed every countable model of PA has such a continuous
presentation on the rationals. More generally, we investigate the topological spaces that
arise as such topological models of arithmetic. Finite dimensional Euclidean spaces Rn,
and compact Hausdorﬀspaces do not, and neither does any Suslin line; many other spaces
do. The status of the space of irrationals remains open.
1. Introduction
This paper arose from the following question that asks whether a model of arithmetic
could be continuously presented on the rational numbers (the motivation for this question is
explained in Remark 17).
Main Question 1 (Enayat [Ena09]). Are there continuous functions ⊕and ⊗on the rational
numbers Q, such that ⟨Q, ⊕, ⊗⟩is a model of PA ?
PA (Peano Arithmetic) consists of the ﬁrst order theory PA−of the non-negative parts of
discretely ordered rings, plus the induction principle for assertions in the ﬁrst order language
of arithmetic. The natural numbers ⟨N, +, ·⟩form what is known as the standard model of
PA, but there are also many nonstandard models, including continuum many non-isomorphic
countable models. Although we take PA as a central case, most of our arguments do not
use the full strength of PA, and our analysis applies to models of various weaker arithmetic
theories. Consequently throughout the paper, we use the expression “a model of arithmetic”
to refer to a model of a suﬃciently strong fragment of PA. The fragments that appear in
the results of this paper are: Successor Arithmetic (the ﬁrst order theory of ⟨N, 0, S⟩, where
S(x) = x+1), Presburger Arithmetic (the ﬁrst order theory of ⟨N, +⟩), PA−, IOpen (PA−plus
induction axioms for quantiﬁer free formulas), I∆0 (PA−plus induction axioms for bounded
formulas), I∆0 + Exp (where Exp asserts the totality of the exponential function), and IΣ1
(PA−plus induction axioms for existential (Σ1) formulas). We refer the reader to [HP98] and
[Kay91] for general background on arithmetical theories and their model theory.
We shall answer the main question aﬃrmatively, and indeed, our main theorem (theorem 5)
shows that every countable model of I∆0 is continuously presented on Q. We deﬁne generally
that a topological model of arithmetic is a topological space X equipped with continuous
functions ⊕and ⊗, for which ⟨X, ⊕, ⊗⟩satisﬁes the desired arithmetic theory. In such a case,
we shall say that the underlying space X continuously supports a model of arithmetic and
that the model is continuously presented on/upon the space X.

Question 2. Which topological spaces support a topological model of arithmetic?
In section 3, we shall prove that many familiar topological spaces do not support models of
arithmetic. The list of such spaces includes every ﬁnite dimensional Euclidean space Rn, the
long line, the Cantor space, and Suslin lines. Meanwhile, there are many other spaces that
do support topological models, including many uncountable subspaces of the plane R2. It
remains an open question whether any uncountable Polish space, including the Baire space,
can support a topological model of arithmetic.
In light of our answer to the main question in the case of Q, where we showed not only that
some models of PA are continuously presented on Q, but that all countable models of PA can
be continuously presented on Q—and the same is true of the indiscrete and discrete spaces—it
seems natural to ask whether this none/all phenomenon continues with other spaces.
Question 3. If a topological space X continuously supports a model of PA, then does X
continuously support a copy of every model of PA of that cardinality?
We answer question 3 negatively in theorem 30, showing that in every inﬁnite cardinality,
there are spaces that continuously support some, but not all models of arithmetic in that
cardinality. Thus, the underlying topology is able to distinguish the arithmetic structure.
One might similarly ask whether it can distinguish the arithmetic theory of the structures.
Question 4. If a topological space X continuously supports a model of PA, then does it
continuously support a model of every completion of PA?
We also answer question 4 negatively in corollary 32, although the question remains open
if one insists that the topology is Hausdorﬀor that the space is uncountable.
2. Every countable model is continuously presented on the rationals
In this section we prove the main theorem, part (a) of which answers the main question. A
soft argument can be used to show that part (b) of the main theorem implies part (a) of the
theorem (more speciﬁcally, this follows from the line of reasoning used to prove lemma 20).
However, for clarity of exposition we found it preferable to establish (a) in full detail, and
then explain the ﬁne tuning that is needed to establish (b). Let us also point out that later in
theorem 25, we show that each countable model of arithmetic also lends itself to continuous
presentations on metric spaces obtained by augmenting the rationals Q with a prescribed
ﬁnite or countable number of isolated points. In contrast, as noted in remark 24, if the ring
ZM of a model M of arithmetic admits a continuous presentation on a countable metric space
X, then either X is homeomorphic to the discrete space N, or X is homeomorphic to the
rationals Q.
Main Theorem 5. Let M be a countable model of the fragment I∆0 of PA.
(a) M admits a continuous presentation on the rationals Q.
(b) The ring of integers ZM of M admits a continuous presentation on the rationals Q.
Proof. (a). We shall prove (a) ﬁrst for the standard model of arithmetic ⟨N, +, ·⟩. Every
school child knows that when computing integer sums and products by the usual algorithms,
the ﬁnal digits of the result x + y or x · y are completely determined by the corresponding
ﬁnal digits of the inputs x and y. Presented with only ﬁnal segments of the input, the child

This phenomenon amounts exactly to the continuity of addition and multiplication with
respect to what we call the ﬁnal-digits topology on N, which is the topology having basic open
sets Us, the set of numbers whose binary representations end with the digits s, for any ﬁnite
binary string s. (A similar idea can be used with any base, although the topologies can diﬀer.)
In the Us notation, we include the number that would arise by deleting initial 0s from s; for
example, 6 ∈U00110. Addition and multiplication are continuous in this topology, because
if x + y or x · y has ﬁnal digits s, then by the school-child’s observation, this is ensured by
corresponding ﬁnal digits in x and y, and so (x, y) has an open neighborhood in the ﬁnal-digits
product space, whose image under the sum or product, respectively, is contained in Us.
Let us make several elementary observations about the topology. The sets Us do indeed
form the basis of a topology, because Us ∩Ut is empty, if s and t disagree on some digit
(comparing from the right), or else it is either Us or Ut, depending on which sequence is
longer. The topology is Hausdorﬀ, because diﬀerent numbers are distinguished by suﬃciently
long segments of ﬁnal digits. There are no isolated points, because every basic open set Us
has inﬁnitely many elements. Every basic open set Us is clopen, since the complement of Us
is the union of Ut, where t conﬂicts on some digit with s. The topology is actually the same
as the metric topology generated by the 2-adic valuation, which assigns the distance between
two numbers as 2−k, when k is largest such that 2k divides their diﬀerence; the set Us is an
open ball in this metric, centered at the number represented by s and of radius 2−|s|. (One
can also see that it is metric by the Urysohn metrization theorem [Mun00, theorem 34.1],
since it is a Hausdorﬀspace with a countable clopen basis, and therefore regular.) By a
theorem of Sierpi´nski [Sie20; Fra12], every countable metric space without isolated points is
homeomorphic to the rational line Q, and so we conclude that the ﬁnal-digits topology on N
is homeomorphic to Q. We’ve therefore proved that the standard model of arithmetic N has
a continuous presentation on Q, as desired.
But let us belabor the argument somewhat, since we ﬁnd it noteworthy that the ﬁnal-digits
topology (or equivalently, the 2-adic metric topology on N) is precisely the order topology
of a certain deﬁnable order on N, what we call the ﬁnal-digits order, an endless dense linear
order, which is therefore order-isomorphic and thus also homeomorphic to the rational line
Q, as desired. This will enable the generalization of corollary 7.
Speciﬁcally, the ﬁnal-digits order on the natural numbers, pictured in ﬁgure 1, is the order
induced from the lexical order on the ﬁnite binary representations, but considering the digits
from right-to-left, giving higher priority in the lexical comparison to the low-value ﬁnal digits
of the number. More precisely, the ﬁnal-digits order n ⊳m holds, if at the ﬁrst point of
disagreement (from the right) in their binary representation, n has 0 and m has 1; or if there
is no disagreement, because one of them is longer, then the longer number is lower, if the next
digit is 0, and higher, if it is 1 (this is not the same as treating missing initial digits as zero).
Thus, the even numbers appear as the left half of the order, since their ﬁnal digit is 0, and
the odd numbers as the right half, since their ﬁnal digit is 1, and 0 is directly in the middle;

Figure 1. The ﬁnal-digits order on the natural numbers
indeed, the highly even numbers, whose representations end with a lot of zeros, appear further
and further to the left, while the highly odd numbers, which end with many ones, appear
further and further to the right. If one does not allow initial 0s in the binary representation
of numbers, then note that zero is represented in binary by the empty sequence. It is evident
that the ﬁnal-digits order is an endless dense linear order on N, just as the corresponding
lexical order on ﬁnite binary strings is an endless dense linear order.
The basic open set Us of numbers having ﬁnal digits s is an open set in this order, since
any number ending with s is above a number with binary form 100 · · · 0s and below a number
with binary form 11 · · ·1s in the ﬁnal-digits order; so Us is a union of intervals in the ﬁnal-
digits order. Conversely, every interval in the ﬁnal-digits order is open in the ﬁnal-digits
topology, because if n ⊳x ⊳m, then this is determined by some ﬁnal segment of the digits of
x (appending initial 0s if necessary), and so there is some Us containing x and contained in
the interval between n and m. Thus, the ﬁnal-digits topology is the precisely the same as the
order topology of the ﬁnal-digits order, which is a deﬁnable endless dense linear order on N.
Since this order is isomorphic and hence homeomorphic to the rational line Q, we conclude
again that ⟨N, +, ·⟩admits a continuous presentation on Q.
The reasoning of the above paragraphs can be undertaken in I∆0. More explicitly, it is well-
known that the theory I∆0 can prove that every number has a (unique) binary representation.
This is based on the remarkable fact (see [HP, Section V3(c)]) that the graph of the exponential
function has a ∆0 deﬁnition (provably in I∆0).
Moreover, it can be readily veriﬁed that
within I∆0, the ﬁnite-digits order is an endless dense linear order. It follows that M can
see that its addition and multiplication are continuous with respect to the order topology of
its ﬁnal-digits order. Since M is countable, the ﬁnal-digits order of M makes it a countable
endless dense linear order, which by Cantor’s theorem is therefore order-isomorphic and hence
homeomorphic to Q. Thus, M has a continuous presentation on the rational line Q, as desired.
The executive summary of the proof is: the arithmetic of the standard model N is continu-
ous with respect to the ﬁnal-digits topology, which is the same as the 2-adic metric topology
on N, and this is homeomorphic to the rational line, because it is the order topology of the
ﬁnal-digits order, a deﬁnable endless dense linear order; applied in a nonstandard model M of
a suﬃciently strong fragment of PA this observation means the arithmetic of M is continuous
with respect to its rational line QM, which for a countable model M is isomorphic to the
actual rational line Q, and so such an M is continuously presentable upon Q. This concludes
the proof of part (a) of Theorem 5.

(b) Consider ﬁrst the standard integers Z. The analogue of the school-child’s observation
is that addition and multiplication of integers is continuous with respect to the signed-ﬁnals-
digits topology, in the sense that if you know the ﬁnal digits of the numbers and their sign
(positive or negative), then you can know the corresponding ﬁnal digits and sign of the output.
If we represent integers by their binary digits with an indication for the sign—we represent
zero by the empty sequence—then the basic open sets in this topology have the form Us+ or
Us−, for any nonempty binary sequence s, where the ﬁrst set is the set of positive numbers
whose binary expansion has ﬁnal digits s, and the second set refers analogously to negative
numbers, plus the sets of negative numbers U−, positive numbers U+ and the sets U00···0,
which are the numbers whose ﬁnal digits end all in zeros, but including both positive and
negative numbers. This topology is the same as the order topology of the signed-ﬁnal-digits
order, pictured in ﬁgure 2 below. This is an endless dense linear order, deﬁned by the lexical
order on the signed binary representation (but note how the sign aﬀects the direction of the
lexical comparison for negative numbers), and so the topology is homeomorphic to the rational
line.

Figure 2. The signed-ﬁnal-digits order on the integers
By carrying out this argument inside any countable nonstandard model of M of I∆0 , we
conclude that ZM also has a continuous presentation on QM, which is order-isomorphic and
hence homeomorphic to Q.
□
Remark 6. Let us brieﬂy discuss a variant of the ﬁnal-digits order, which some readers
might ﬁnd natural, but which generates a diﬀerent topology from the ﬁnal-digits topology.
The order, pictured in ﬁgure 3 arises from the lexical order on inﬁnitary binary sequences, if
one embeds the ﬁnite binary sequences into that space by appending inﬁnitely many zeros at
the left. Thus, one imagines representing the number 6 with · · · 0000110. This amounts to
treating missing initial digits in the usual binary representations as 0. The order is manifestly
diﬀerent from the ﬁnal-digits order; for example, 0 is now a least element. Nevertheless, this
is a dense linear order with a least element, and so it is order-isomorphic to Q ∩[0, 1), which
is homeomorphic to Q. We should like to point out, however, ﬁrst, that this order does not
give rise to the ﬁnal-digits topology, since with this variant order, the set of numbers having
ﬁnal digits 110 has a least element, the number 6, and so it is not open in this order topology.
Secondly, the successor function x 7→x + 1 is not continuous with respect to this order, since
1 + 1 = 2, and 2 has an open neighborhood containing only even numbers, but every open
neighborhood of 1 contains both even and odd numbers, whose sums therefore will not all be
in that neighborhood of 2. Thus, even the successor function is not continuous with respect
to this modiﬁed order, and in this sense, it was not the right order to consider. Nevertheless,

Figure 3. A variant of the ﬁnal-digits order on the natural numbers
one can rescue things somewhat by noting that the ﬁnal-digits topology is exactly the right-
open topology of this order, with basic open sets consisting of half-open intervals [n, m) in
the order here, and therefore, by the argument of the main theorem, arithmetic is continuous
with respect to the right-open topology of this order.
Corollary 7. Every model M (of any cardinality) of IΣ1 has a continuous presentation on
the topological space QM with the order topology.
Proof. The model M has a continuous presentation with respect to the ﬁnal-digits order
as deﬁned in M.
This order is seen as a countable endless dense linear order, from the
perspective of M, and so by an appropriate version of Cantor’s theorem applied in M, it
is order-isomorphic and hence homeomorphic to the rationals QM of M. More explicitly,
M can handle constructions by Σ1-recursion since M |= IΣ1, and the ordering on QM and
the ﬁnal digits order ⊳on M are both ∆1-deﬁnable in M, therefore Cantor’s back-and-forth
construction can be implemented within M to yield a deﬁnable isomorphism between the
endless dense linearly ordered sets QM and (M, ⊳).
□
The investigation of saturated dense linear orders was initiated by Hausdorﬀ(see [Hau02]),
who introduced the familiar η notation for the countable endless dense linear order, and more
generally ηα for the saturated endless dense linear order of cardality ℵα, which exists precisely
under the set-theoretical assumption that ℵ<ℵα
α
= ℵα.
Corollary 8. The order ηα, when it exists, supports a topological model of arithmetic.
Proof. If ηα exists, then because ℵ<ℵα
α
= ℵα, it follows that there are saturated structures of
size ℵα in any ﬁrst-order language of size less than ℵα. Let M be such a saturated model of
arithmetic of size ℵα. Its rational numbers QM will therefore be a saturated endless dense
linear order of size ℵα, hence order-isomorphic to ηα.
So ηα, when it exists, supports a
topological model of arithmetic.
□
Question 9. Which topological spaces arise as QM for a model of arithmetic M |= PA?
The spaces QM are always at least a little homogeneous, since there are many order-
isomorphisms of QM internal to M; for example, any ﬁnite partial order automorphism ex-
tends inside M to a full order automorphism. Also, QM is never complete as an order, since

the model can see that
√
2
M determines a cut in QM with no least upper bound; indeed, the
order is totally disconnected. The following theorem collects some basic facts about linear
orders deﬁnable in nonstandard models of arithmetic.
Theorem 10. Let M be a nonstandard model of PA.
(a) No inﬁnite complete linear order is deﬁnable in M.
(b) If a linear order ⟨L, ≤L⟩is deﬁnable in M, then every limit point in L has the same
coﬁnality (from below or above) as the coﬁnality of M, and this is furthermore the
same as the coﬁnality or coinitiality of L itself.
(c) If M is uncountable, then QM is not separable, and indeed, it has an uncountable
discrete subset, and therefore admits an uncountable family of disjoint intervals. 1
Proof. (a) Suppose that ⟨L, ≤L⟩is a linear order deﬁnable in a nonstandard model of arith-
metic M |= PA. Since Ramsey’s theorem is formalizable in PA, from the perspective of M
there must either be an inﬁnite increasing or decreasing sequence ⟨ci | i ∈M⟩. But the limit
of ck for standard k must exist, if L is complete, and from this M can deﬁne the standard
cut, which is a contradiction.
(b) If a point x is a limit point of L in M, then M thinks that x is the limit of an inﬁnite
sequence, and so x is the limit of a sequence whose order type is the same as the order type
of M. Thus, the coﬁnality of x in L (from either direction) is the same as the coﬁnality of
M itself. The same argument works for the coﬁnality and coinitiality of L itself, if the order
does not have maximal or minimal elements, respectively.
(c) Every model M of PA sits as a discrete set inside its rationals QM. The model can
place disjoint intervals around its integers, such as (n −1
3, n + 1
3), and thereby produce an
uncountable family of disjoint intervals.
□
3. Some spaces do not support a topological model of arithmetic
In this section we prove now that several types of spaces do not support a topological model
of arithmetic. We begin with the case of compact Hausdorﬀspaces. The proof of the theorem
below shows that if M is a compact Hausdorﬀspace and ⟨M, +, ·⟩is a model of a suﬃciently
strong fragment of PA then neither addition nor multiplication, separately, is continuous, and
indeed, these functions are not even continuous separately in just one coordinate at a time.
Theorem 11. No compact Hausdorﬀspace supports a topological model of arithmetic. More
precisely:
(a) Addition is not continuous for any compact Hausdorﬀtopological model of Presburger
Arithmetic.
(b) Multiplication is not continuous for any compact Hausdorﬀtopological model of I∆0+
Exp.
Proof. (a) Suppose that M is a model of Presburger Arithmetic. To show that addition is not
continuous, for any k ∈M, consider the interval [k, ∞) in the sense of M. This interval is the
image of M under the map x 7→x + k. If this map is continuous, then the image is compact
1In particular, QM is never a Suslin line, nor is it the space of irrational numbers.
While part (c) of
Theorem 10 rules out these latter spaces for QM, it does not seem necessarily to rule them out as supporting
topological models of arithmetic in some way other than as QM.

and therefore also closed in M, and so the family of all such intervals is thus a nested family
of nonempty closed sets with empty intersection, violating compactness. So addition is not
continuous, not even separately in the ﬁrst coordinate.
(b) Let M be a model of I∆0 +Exp. Consider the sets M ·(k!) = { n · (k!) | n ∈M }, where
k! means the factorial of k as seen by the model M (the factorial function is well-deﬁned
within I∆0 + Exp). If multiplication is continuous, then these sets are the image of M under
a continuous map and therefore are compact and hence closed. And they are nested, as k
increases in M, with empty intersection.
So we have a nested family of closed sets with
empty intersection, contradicting compactness. So multiplication is not continuous, not even
separately in the ﬁrst coordinate.
□
Theorem 12. No Euclidean space Rn, in any ﬁnite dimension n ≥1, supports a topological
model of Successor Arithmetic.
Proof. The n = 1 case is straightforward. Suppose that ⟨R, r0, S(x)⟩is a topological model of
Successor Arithmetic, where r0 is the zero of the model (which need not equal the real number
0). Also note that S(x) is the successor function in the sense of the model of arithmetic, which
need not equal the real number x + 1. If S(x) were continuous, then the image of R under
this map would be connected, since R is connected. But the complement of a point in R is
disconnected and Successor Arithmetic proves that the range of the successor function omits
exactly one point, namely r0. Therefore S(x) is discontinuous.
Now suppose that M is a topological model of Successor Arithmetic that is homemorphic
to Rn for some ﬁnite n > 1.
Then the continuity of the successor function implies that
the punctured space Rn \ {r0} is a continuous injective image of Rn. On the other hand, by
Brouwer’s “Invariance of Domain Theorem” [Mun00, section 62], if U is an open subset of Rn
and f : U →Rn is injective and one-to-one, then f[U] is homeomorphic to U. This shows that
the continuity of the successor function implies that Rn is homeomorphic to the punctured
space Rn\{r0}, which is well-known to be false; one standard way to verify this is to note that
the n-th homotopy group πn(Rn) is the trivial group since Rn is contractible (i.e., homotopy
equivalent to a point), but πn(Rn \ {r0}) = Z since Rn \ {r0} is homotopy equivalent to the
n-dimensional sphere Sn, and by a basic result of algebraic topology πn(Sn) = Z, cf. [Hat02,
corollary 4.25].

The following lemma can also be used to rule out ﬁnite dimensional Euclidean spaces
Rn based on considerations of dimension theory in topology that show that there can be
no continuous injection of Rm into Rn, when n < m; such a continuous injection would
provide a homeomorphism of the m-dimensional cube [0, 1]m with its image in Rn, which
violates [Mun00, theorem 50.6], stating that closed subsets of Rn have dimension at most n.
So M cannot have Rn as its underlying space.
Lemma 13. If M is a topological model of IOpen, then there is a continuous pairing function,
that is, a continuous injection from M 2 to M. Indeed, there is a continuous bijection of M 2
with the even numbers of M.
Proof. Provably in IOpen, the Cantor pairing function p(n, m) = 1
2(n + m)(n + m + 1) + m
is a bijection between M 2 and M. We cannot generally divide by 2 in a continuous manner,
however, and so to make a continuous injection, as opposed to bijection, we simply use

q(n, m) = (n + m)(n + m + 1) + 2m, which is the double of the Cantor function. This is now
a continuous injection of M 2 into M, and indeed, it is a continuous bijection of M 2 with the
even numbers of M.
□
Remark 14. The argument for ruling out R in theorem 12 shows that no space that is
connected, yet becomes disconnected upon the deletion of any point (or any two points),
supports a topological model of arithmetic. Therefore the two-way version of the long line,
which extends to ω1 in both directions, does not support a topological model of successor
arithmetic. For the ordinary long line, that is, [0, 1) · ω1, there is a least element, whose
deletion does not disconnect the space, although the deletion of any two points will disconnect
the space. This again violates continuity of the successor function, if we simply perform it
twice, if necessary, for then the image will omit exactly two points.
The following theorem rules out another class of spaces which includes the real line (but
not the long line). Indeed, this was the ﬁrst proof we found for ruling out the real line.
Theorem 15. If a space is uncountable and connected, and has the further properties that
(i) there is no descending ω1-sequence of connected subspaces, and (ii) there is no partition
of the space into uncountably many disjoint uncountable connected subspaces, then it does not
support a topological model of I∆0 + Exp.
Proof. Suppose that ⟨M, +, ·⟩is an uncountable topological model of I∆0+Exp, whose under-
lying space has the features mentioned in the theorem. Recall that the factorial function and
the division algorithm can be readily handled in I∆0 + Exp. We split into two cases. First,
suppose that the model happens to have an increasing ω1-sequence of numbers ⟨kα | α < ω1⟩.
(But see theorem 18 for why this case does not arise in R or in any Polish space.) We claim
that in this case multiplication cannot be continuous, even just in one coordinate. To see this,
consider the image of the whole space M · (kα!) after multiplication by the factorial of kα, as
the model sees it. This is the continuous image of a connected set and therefore connected.
Since these sets are descending as kα increases, this would violate assumption (i) on the un-
derlying space of M. In the remaining case, since M is uncountable, there must be a number
d in the model having at least ω1 many predecessors r < d. For each such r, let Ar be the
numbers with residue r modulo d as the model sees it. Thus, Ar is simply the image of M
under the function q 7→dq + r, which is injective and continuous. So each Ar is uncountable
and connected, and we have therefore found a partition of M into uncountably many disjoint
uncountable connected sets, which would violate assumption (ii) on the underlying space of
M.

Question 16. Does the Baire space support a topological model of PA? Does Rω support a
topological model of PA? Does any uncountable Polish space support a topological model of
PA?
Remark 17. (a) The above question, initially posed in
[Ena09], was motivated by a key
result of [MMR91; MMR92], that shows that every consistent ﬁrst order theory in a countable
language has a model whose universe is the Baire space and all of whose deﬁnable relations are
Fσ as well as Gδ. So we know that there are low-complexity Borel models on the Baire space
and other Polish spaces; the question is whether one can realize the model with continuous

functions.2 In light of the homeomorphism between the Baire space and the space of irrationals
(whose topology is induced by a linear order), the L¨owenheim-Skolem theorem implies that if
the Baire space supports a topological model of arithmetic, then any countable subset X of
the Baire space is contained in a countable subspace Y of the Baire space that continuously
supports a model of arithmetic. Putting this fact together with Cantor’s theorem concerning
the countable categoricity of endless dense linear orders, one obtains the implication: If the
Baire space continuously supports a model of arithmetic, then so does the space of rationals
Q. This explains the motivation for Main Question 1 since a negative answer to it would have
automatically provided a negative answer to question 16 (for the Baire space).
(b) It is easy to construct uncountable Polish spaces that support topological models of
Successor Arithmetic. For example, let X be the union of N × {0} and Z × I, where I is the
interval [1, 2]. X is a closed subspace of R2, and therefore is an uncountable Polish space. Let
f : X →X be the restriction to X of the map F(x, y) = (x + 1, y). Clearly f is continuous
on X since F is continuous on R2. It is routine to verify that ⟨X, z, f⟩is a model of Successor
Arithmetic with the choice of z = (0, 0), i.e., f is injective, the range of f is X \ {z}, and
f (n)(x) ̸= x for all x ∈X and all n ≥1, where f (n) is the n-fold iteration of the function f.
With slightly more eﬀort, one can show that the subspace Y of R consisting of the union of
{(n−1)/n : n ∈N} and the open interval (1, 2) also supports a topological model of Successor
Arithmetic. Note that Y is Gδ in R and is therefore a Polish space.
The following observation shows that certain well-studied uncountable models of arithmetic
cannot be continuously presented on Polish spaces.
Theorem 18. If a model of arithmetic M of Presburger Arithmetic is continuously presented
on an uncountable Polish space, then there are no increasing or decreasing ω1-sequences in
the order. In particular, it is not κ-like for any cardinal κ.
Proof. If addition + is continuous, then the order < is analytic, being the projection of a
Borel relation via a < b ←→∃c (a + c + 1 = b). But a deep theorem due to Harrington and
Shelah [HS82] shows that no analytic order can have increasing or decreasing ω1-sequences.
□
4. The topology of a topological model of arithmetic
We should like to focus now on the underlying topology of a topological model of arithmetic,
ﬁnding general features these models exhibit and investigating how one might change the
topology to another related topology with respect to which the model remains continuous.
Theorem 19. Every model M of a suﬃciently strong fragment of PA admits a continuous
presentation with respect to the following topologies on M.
(a) The discrete and indiscrete topologies on M.
(b) The rational line QM, as M sees it.
2Note that continuous functions in Polish spaces have closed graphs, or in other words, in the class F . In
compact Hausdorﬀspaces, this is an equivalence, and so theorem 11 shows that in compact Hausdorﬀspaces,
there is no model of arithmetic whose operations have a closed graph. Does this extend to R and the other
spaces we have ruled out? Will Brian’s observation [Bri18], posted on MathOverﬂow in answer to a question
of the ﬁrst author, may be relevant; he shows that there are no injections from Rm to Rn with a closed graph,
when m > n; but note that the composition of functions with a closed graph need not necessarily have a
closed graph.

TOPOLOGICAL MODELS OF ARITHMETIC
11
(c) The initial-segment topology, whose open sets are initial segments of M.
(d) The ﬁnal-segment topology, whose open sets are ﬁnal segments of M.
Proof. Statement (a) is immediate, since all operations on a set are continuous with respect to
discrete or indiscrete topologies. Statement (2) follows from the main theorem, so “suﬃciently
strong fragment” for statement (b) means I∆0. For statement (c), consider the initial-segment
topology. If x + y ≤k, then for any x′ ≤x and y′ ≤y, we would have x′ + y′ ≤k. Thus, we
have an open neighborhood of (x, y) whose image under addition is contained in the open set
[0, k], and so addition is continuous. A similar argument works for multiplication: if xy ≤k,
then any x′ ≤x and y′ ≤y will have x′y′ ≤k. So we have veriﬁed statement (c). For
statement (d), we consider the ﬁnal-segment topology. If x + y ≥k, then for any x′ ≥x and
y′ ≥y, we will have x′+y′ ≥k, and so addition is continuous. Similarly, if xy ≥k, then for any
x′ ≥x and y′ ≥y, we have x′y′ ≥k, and so multiplication is continuous, verifying statement
(4). Thus, for statements (3) and (4) “suﬃciently strong fragment” means PA−.
□
The key for statements (3) and (4) was the monotone nature of addition and multiplication
in a model of arithmetic; the argument would not work (and the result fails) in ordered rings,
where multiplication by negative numbers is order reversing. Note that those topologies are
not Hausdorﬀ.
Lemma 20. Suppose M is a topological model of Presburger arithmetic. Then:
(a) M is upward homogeneous, meaning that whenever a < b in M, then there is a
continuous injection on M taking a to b. In particular, if b is isolated, then also all
a < b are isolated.
(b) If M is homeomorphic to the rationals Q, then for each a ∈M, {x ∈M : x > a} is
also homeomorphic to Q.
Proof. For (a) simply use the map x 7→x + k, where k = b −a in M. (b) follows from (a)
together with Sierpi´nski’s characterization of Q as the only countable metric space (up to
homeomorphism) with no isolated points.
□
Topological models of arithmetic might fail to have the corresponding downward homo-
geneity, however, in light of the following.
Theorem 21. Suppose that M is a topological model of PA−, and consider any element
b ∈M. Let M ∗be the same model of arithmetic, but reﬁning the topology to make every
number a ≤b isolated in M ∗. Then M ∗is continuous with respect to this new topology.
Proof. The open sets of M ∗have the form U ∗= U ∪A, where U is open in M and A ⊆[0, b].
To verify continuity in M ∗, suppose that x + y ∈U ∗= U ∪A. If x + y ≤b, then both x
and y also are ≤b, and so (x, y) is isolated in the plane, which is suﬃcient for this instance
of continuity.
Otherwise, we have x + y ∈U, and so by the continuity of M there is a
neighborhood of (x, y) in M 2 whose image under addition is contained in U. Thus, addition
is continuous in M ∗. A similar argument works for multiplication, with a slight wrinkle about
zero. Namely, if b ̸= 0 and xy ≤b, then both x, y ≤b and we may proceed as with addition.
And when xy = 0, then one of them must be 0, and in this case, M ×{0} is an open set in the
product space of M ∗whose image maps to 0 under multiplication. So again we have veriﬁed
continuity.
□
Since isolating any set of points in a metric space preserves metrizability, it follows that M ∗
will be metrizable, if M was. One can view the construction of theorem 21 as an instance of

12
ALI ENAYAT, JOEL DAVID HAMKINS, AND BARTOSZ WCIS LO
the more general topology-blending constructions, which we now develop. These constructions
are generally asymmetric, in that one is either adding open sets of small numbers or removing
open sets of large numbers.
Theorem 22. Suppose that M is a model of PA−that is continuous with respect to topologies
τ0 and τ1, where τ0 reﬁnes τ1. For any initial segment I ⊆M, let τ ∗be the topology generated
by sets of the form U ∪A, where U ∈τ1 and A is an open subset of I in the subspace topology
of τ0. Then M is continuous with respect to the topology τ∗.
Proof. If x + y ∈U ∪A, then we break into cases.
If x + y ∈U, then we can ﬁnd a
neighborhood of (x, y) using the τ1 topology. Otherwise x + y ∈A = W ∩I for some W ∈τ0.
In particular, x + y ∈I and so also x, y ∈I. Thus, we can ﬁnd a neighborhood of (x, y) using
the τ0 topology, and then restrict to the subspace I, which will give a neighborhood in the τ ∗
product topology. A similar argument works with xy, where again we need to pay attention
to the case xy = 0 separately.
□
Corollary 23. If M is a topological model of PA−with topology τ, then for any initial
segment I ⊆M, the model M is also continuous with respect to the topology τ ↾I, whose
open sets are of the form U ∩I, where U is open with respect to τ, plus M itself.
Proof. The topology τ ↾I is an instance of theorem 22, blending the indiscrete topology with
the topology τ on I.
□
Remark 24. Under the topology τ ↾I, the initial segment I appears the same as its subspace
topology with respect to τ, but the points above I in the order of M become indiscrete. This
method can be used even in the case I = [0, b], where the initial segment has a maximal
element, in which case we denote τ ↾[0, b] by τ ↾b. Because of these topology-blending
constructions, it follows that topological models of arithmetic need not be homogeneous.
This makes the case of topological models of arithmetic very diﬀerent from the related case
of topological ordered rings, such as the integers ZM of a model of arithmetic M, as these
are always homogeneous: the translation maps x 7→x + k are homeomorphisms mapping any
point to any other desired point (the inverse map is continuous, since it is translation by −k).
In particular, in such a topological ordered ring, if one point is isolated, then all points are
isolated. It follows that if ⟨Z, +, ·⟩is a countable ordered ring, whose addition + is continuous
with respect to an underlying metric topology, then the underlying space is homeomorphic
either to N or Q. This is because if there is an isolated point, then all points are isolated
and the topology is discrete; and otherwise, there are no isolated points, and by the theorem
of Sierpi´nski we mentioned earlier, every countable metric space without isolated points is
homeomorphic to Q. With topological models of arithmetic, in contrast, one can achieve
other countable metric spaces.
Theorem 25. Every countable nonstandard model of I∆0 has continuous presentations with
respect to the following countable metric spaces:
(a) The rationals Q.
(b) The rationals Q, adjoined with ﬁnitely many isolated points.
(c) The rationals Q, adjoined with inﬁnitely many isolated points.
(d) The countable discrete metric space.
Proof. The main theorem gives Q, and then by theorem 22 we can choose any ﬁnite or inﬁnite
initial segment I of the model and arrange for all points in I to be isolated. Note that by
part (b) of Lemma 20, the rest of the model is homeomorphic to Q.
□

TOPOLOGICAL MODELS OF ARITHMETIC
13
Note that the standard model of arithmetic has no continuous presentation on Q adjoined
with inﬁnitely many isolated points, since those points would have to be unbounded in N and
thus every point would have to be isolated, by lemma 20.
The underlying topology-blending fact, of course, is the following elementary observation
of topology.
Lemma 26. If a binary operation on a set X is continuous with respect to topologies σ and
also with respect to τ, then it is also continuous with respect to the topology generated by σ∪τ.
Proof. Suppose that ⋆is a binary operation on X, continuous with respect both to σ and τ
separately, meaning that the corresponding product topology is used for X2, the domain of
the operation. The topology generated by σ ∪τ has basic open sets of the form U ∩W, where
U ∈σ and W ∈τ. If x ⋆y ∈U ∩W, then we can ﬁnd open neighborhoods of (x, y) in the
σ topology on X2 and in the τ topology on X2, which by intersection will provide an open
neighborhood in the combined topology, whose image under ⋆is contained in U ∩W.
□
For example, we may combine any given topology with the initial-segment topology, or
with the ﬁnal-segment topology, and produce a new topological model of arithmetic.
Theorem 27. If M is a topological model of PA−, then so is M ∗, which is the same model,
but with a new topology, generated from the old by taking all initial segments of M also as
open sets. The same applies to M ∗∗, whose topology is generated by the topology of M and
the ﬁnal segments of M.
Note that the ﬁnal-digits topology on a model of arithmetic M, as in the main theorem,
already makes all ﬁnal-segments open, since for any n with binary representation s, the basic
open set Us consists of numbers all at least as large as n. So if one augments M with the
initial segments to form M ∗, then every point will become isolated.
Let us discuss the issue in the proof of theorem 13 about using the Cantor bijective pairing
function
p(n, m) = 1
2(n + m)(n + m + 1) + m,
instead of its double. If dividing by 2 were continuous, then indeed we could use the bijective
pairing function, and M 2 would be continuously bijective with M. But not every topological
model of arithmetic has dividing-by-2 as a continuous function.
Theorem 28. Every model M of PA−carries a topology τM that continuously supports M
in which dividing by 2 is not a continuous function on its even numbers, and also in which
the predecessor function x 7→x −1 is not continuous on the positive numbers. Moreover, if
M is a countable model of I∆0, then τM can be arranged to be metrizable.
Proof. Let M be any model of arithmetic. Consider this model under the topology τM =
τ ↾17, where τ is the discrete topology. So M has the discrete topology up to and including
the number 17, but above 17 the topology is indiscrete. By corollary 23, this is a topological
model of arithmetic.
If dividing by 2 were a continuous function on the even numbers of M, then since 30 gets
mapped to 15, which is isolated, it would mean that 30 is isolated in the subspace topology of
the even numbers. But the only open set containing 30 also contains all the numbers above
17, and so it isn’t isolated in the even numbers. Contradiction.

14
ALI ENAYAT, JOEL DAVID HAMKINS, AND BARTOSZ WCIS LO
A similar argument works with the predecessor function. Since 18−1 = 17, if this function
were continuous on the positive numbers, then 18 would have to be isolated in the subspace
of positive numbers, but it isn’t.
In order to demonstrate the moreover clause, recall that by the proof of theorem 25 there
is a model M of I∆0 that carries a metrizable topology τM that continuously supports M
and such that the subspace consisting of numbers less than or equal to 17 carries the discrete
topology, but the rest of the space is homeomorphic to Q. An argument similar to the one
used to prove the ﬁrst part of the theorem shows that when M is equipped with τM, the map
x 7→2x is not an open map, and neither is the successor function x 7→x + 1, since open maps
would map isolated points to isolated points. Therefore the dividing-by-2 and predecessor
functions are discontinuous when the underlying topology is τM.
□
Question 29. Is there a topological model of arithmetic M having no continuous bijection
between M 2 and M?
Note that subtraction and division are continuous with respect to the ﬁnal-digits topology,
in any model of arithmetic, by an analogue of the school-child’s observation in the proof of
the theorem 5.
Similar ideas as in theorem 28 provide a negative answer to question 3. Recall that a
linearly ordered structure M is κ-like, if the cardinality of M is κ, but the cardinality of every
proper initial segment of M is less than κ. It is well-known that every countable model of PA
has a κ-like elementary extension for every inﬁnite cardinal κ.
Theorem 30. In every inﬁnite cardinality κ, there is a topological space X of that size
continuously supporting exactly the models of arithmetic of size κ that are not κ-like. Thus,
X continuously supports some, but not all models of arithmetic of this size.
Proof. Let X be a space consisting of the indiscrete topology on a set of size κ, augmented
with κ many additional isolated points. If M is a model of arithmetic of size κ, then M is
continuous with respect to the topology τ ↾b, where τ is the discrete topology and b ∈M.
If M is not κ-like, then it has an element b having κ many predecessors, in which case τ ↾b
has κ many isolated points and an indiscrete block of κ many additional points, making the
space homeomorphic to X. But if the model M is κ-like, then it can have no continuous
presentation on X, for in this case, the isolated points would have to be unbounded in M,
and thus by lemma 20 it would follow that every point would have to be isolated, contrary to
the nature of X. So X continuously supports exactly the non-κ-like models of arithmetic.
□
We can prove a weak dual to this result.
Theorem 31. For every inﬁnite cardinal κ, there is a topological space Y supporting a κ-like
model, such that furthermore, only κ-like models are continuously presentable upon Y .
Proof. Let M be any κ-like model, and let Y be the initial-segment topology of M. Suppose
that N is continuously presented on this same topology. If N is not κ-like, then it has a point
b with κ many predecessors a < b in N. Let U be a neighborhood of b, which is not the whole
space. It follows that U has size less than κ, and therefore it omits κ many a < b. For any
such a, there is ka such that a+ka = b, and all such ka are distinct. By continuity, there is an
open neighborhood W of a such that a′ + ka ∈U for all a′ ∈W. Since the open sets of X are
linearly ordered, a ∈W and a /∈U, it follows that U ⊆W and in particular, b ∈W. Thus,
b + ka ∈U for all these a, which places κ many elements into U, contrary to assumption.
□

TOPOLOGICAL MODELS OF ARITHMETIC
15
Thus, we have two topological spaces of size κ, namely the space X of theorem 30 and
the space Y of theorem 31, each of which supports a topological model of arithmetic, but no
model is continuously presented upon both of them. In this sense, the topology can make
distinctions in the arithmetic structure. In the case κ = ω, this provides a negative answer to
question 4, since there is only one ω-like model of arithmetic: the standard model.
Corollary 32. There is a countable topological space X, such that only the standard model
of arithmetic N is continuously presented upon X, and furthermore this model has a unique
such presentation. In particular, this answers question 4 negatively.
Proof. Let X be the initial-segment topology on the standard model N, which is continuously
presented upon X by theorem 27. The standard model N is ω-like and it is up to isomorphism
the only ω-like model of arithmetic. Since theorem 31 shows that only ω-like models have a
continuous presentation upon X, it follows that only N admits such a presentation. In par-
ticular, all models presented upon X have the same theory (true arithmetic), which provides
a strong negative answer to question 4.
Let us show that the presentation is unique. Suppose that M = ⟨N, ⊕, ⊗⟩is a model of
arithmetic that is continuous with respect to the initial-segment topology on N. Since 0N is
the only isolated point, it follows from lemma 20 that 0M = 0N. Since a⊕1M = 1N for some a
and { 0, 1N } is open, there must be an open set W such that w ⊕1M ∈{ 0, 1N } for all w ∈W.
But w ⊕1M = 0 is impossible, since 0M = 0N, and so w ⊕1M = 1N for all w ∈W. Therefore
W must have only one element, so W = { 0 }, the only open set with exactly one element.
This shows that a = 0 and therefore 1M = 1N. Continuing similarly by induction, one sees
that M agrees completely with the standard model, and thus the presentation is unique.
□
The arguments of theorem 31 and corollary 32 suggest that perhaps the initial segment
topology can detect the order type of any model of arithmetic continuously presented upon
it, and so we ask the following question.
Question 33. If M is a model of arithmetic, and N is a model continuously presented with
respect to the initial-segment topology of M, then must M and N have the same order type?
Is this true for κ-like models M?
The ﬁnal argument of corollary 32 shows the answer is aﬃrmative when κ = ω. More
generally, the same argument shows that if N is continuous with respect to the initial-segment
topology of a model M, then the two models must have the same 0, the same 1 and so on
through the standard part. The question is asking whether the pattern continues above this,
so that the models have the same initial segments and hence the same order. Theorem 31
shows that when M is κ-like, then any N presented on the initial-segment topology of M will
be κ-like, but it does not quite show for uncountable κ that the order of M and N agree or
that these orders are isomorphic. Note that models of arithmetic can have the same order
without being isomorphic with respect to their addition and multiplication; for example, all
countable nonstandard models of PA have the same order type: ω + Z · Q.
5. Topological models of arithmetic in the complex numbers
In this last section, We provide further instances of topological models of arithmetic by
revisiting the following result which presents uncountable models of arithmetic in the com-
plex numbers. The result is due to Josef Mlˇcek [Mlˇc73]; see also the second author’s blog
post [Ham18]

16
ALI ENAYAT, JOEL DAVID HAMKINS, AND BARTOSZ WCIS LO
Theorem 34. Every model of PA−of size at most continuum has a presentation as a topo-
logical model, using a subspace of the real plane R2. Indeed, every such model is realized as a
substructure of the complex numbers ⟨C, +, ·⟩.
Proof. Suppose that M is a model of PA−of size at most continuum. Consider the integers
of this model ZM, from which we may take the fraction ﬁeld and then the algebraic closure,
building a version of the ﬁeld A of algebraic numbers over M.3
So A is an algebraically
closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero, which has an elementary extension to such a ﬁeld of size
continuum. Since the theory of algebraically closed ﬁelds of characteristic zero is categorical
in all uncountable powers, it follows that A is isomorphic to a substructure of the complex
numbers C, and isomorphic to C itself if M has size continuum. Since M is isomorphic to a
substructure of ZM, which sits inside A, it follows that M is isomorphic to a substructure of
C, as claimed. Since complex number arithmetic is continuous with respect to the topology
of the real plane, we thereby realize M as a topological model of arithmetic using this subset
of R2.
□
In particular, every countable model of PA−can be found as a substructure of the complex
numbers. The same argument applied at higher cardinals shows that if k is the uncountable
algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero, then every model of arithmetic M |= PA−of
size at most the cardinality of k embeds into k.
Note that by theorem 18, if M is a κ-like model of arithmetic for some uncountable κ at
most the continuum, then no subspace of R2 that continuously supports M is analytic.
