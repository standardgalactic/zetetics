Acknowledgements
I would like to thank George Kapetanios for giving me the opportunity to work alongside him, for
always trusting me with important projects and never micro-managing me. It is precisely this
that taught me to be a responsible and independent researcher.
There are no words to describe how much I owe to Liudas Giraitis, he is the kindest and most
generous person I have known and his door has always been open for me.
I am indebted to Ana Galveao for everything she taught me and for being as strict as a parent.
She taught me discipline and it is because of her insistence that I completed my job market paper
on time for job applications. And, of course, it was her course I took in my MSc., that got me
interested in macroeconometrics in the …rst place.
I would also like to thank Haroon Mumtaz for all the valuable comments and discussions and for
being a good friend.
Finally, I would like to thank Tassos for his in…nite love and patience throughout the writing of
this work.

Abstract
This thesis proposes a new econometric methodology for the estimation and inference of macro-
economic models in the presence of time variation in the parameters.
A novel quasi-Bayesian
local likelihood (QBLL) approach is established and it is shown that the method gives rise to as-
ymptotically valid quasi-posterior distributions. In addition, in the special case of linear Gaussian
models, expressions of the quasi-posteriors are derived in closed form, which simpli…es inference and
makes the use of MCMC unnecessary. Inference based on the QBLL approach, as a consequence
of modelling parameter variation nonparametrically, is robust to di¤erent processes for the drifting
parameters, as its validity does not depend on parametric restrictions typically imposed by alterna-
tive state space models. In addition, the Bayesian treatment of the approach provides a remedy to
the ‘curse of dimensionality’by accommodating large dimensional systems. We demonstrate that
the proposed estimators exhibit good …nite sample properties, and, unlike the alternative para-
metric state space models, are robust to di¤erent parameter processes. We provide a variety of
interesting macroeconomic applications and forecasting exercises to reduced-form VAR models. In
addition, we develop the methodology to the estimation of structural DSGE models in the presence
of parameter drift. We apply the proposed algorithms to di¤erent medium-sized DSGE models in
order to study structural change in the parameters.

Introduction
Standard econometric techniques usually assume that the data generating process depends on a
number of …xed parameters. In a macroeconomic context, this has the implication that relationships
between economic variables remain constant over time.
This assumption is not supported by
evidence from macro time series, where relationships between variables are subject to structural
change: in the case of the recent 2008 …nancial crisis this structural change was abrupt, while
in the context of the transition of the world economy from the volatile period of the 1970s-1980s
oil crises to the low volatility period of the Great Moderation in the late 1980s and 1990s, the
structural change was slow and gradual. Standard econometric models fail to capture such time
varying relationships and deliver invalid inference in the cases where time variation is erroneously
ignored. The issue has assumed increased practical relevance as time series samples span longer
periods due to the increase of data availability, so the problem of accommodating time varying
relationships has assumed a prominent role in econometric research.
This thesis contributes to this research by combining existing nonparametric approaches with
Bayesian methods and establishing a quasi-Bayesian local likelihood (QBLL) estimation methodol-
ogy for a general multivariate model with time varying parameters. The proposed estimators di¤er
from existing state space approaches in that they estimate parameter time variation nonparamet-
rically without imposing assumptions on the stochastic processes of the parameters. The QBLL
approach augments the frequentist estimators of Giraitis, Kapetanios and Yates (2014) and Giraitis,
Kapetanios, Wetherilt and Zikes (2016) in order to provide a Bayesian treatment for the drifting
parameters. It is the Bayesian treatment that allows to increase the dimension of the models and
helps avoid over…tting. This is particularly relevant for Vector Autoregressions (VAR) where the
number of parameters is large. In addition, the Bayesian treatment enables the construction of
MCMC algorithms that can sample from the joint posterior of the parameters in the presence of
mixtures of time varying and time invariant parameters.
In Chapter 2, we establish the QBLL methodology and prove that the resulting quasi-posterior
distributions are asymptotically valid for inference and con…dence interval construction. In the
special case of linear Gaussian models, we derive closed form expressions for the quasi-posterior
densities: these are of Normal-Gamma and Normal-Wishart distributional form, which alleviates
12

the need to use MCMC methods and makes the approach fast and tractable. Chapter 2 also posi-
tions the method in the existing literature, comparing and contrasting it to: i) existing parametric
state space approaches and ii) nonparametric approaches. Another contribution of Chapter 2 is
to constructs several Gibbs sampling algorithms, which can sample from the joint posterior distri-
bution of combinations of time varying and time invariant parameters. This is done in line with
the nonparametric strategy of this thesis, hence without imposing parametric assumptions on the
parameters. In addition, in Chapter 2 we provide a study of the …nite sample performance of the
QBLL estimators and compare them to alternative methods. Finally, we demonstrate the method
in action with an empirical application and a forecasting exercise using Bayesian VAR models with
time varying parameters.
Having established the theoretical framework and applied it to reduced form models in Chapter
2, we turn to structural models in Chapter 3. In particular, we develop further the approach and
demonstrate how it can be employed for the estimation of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) models in the presence of drifting parameters. DSGE models have recently received consid-
erable attention in policy analysis and forecasting and we demonstrate that allowing for parameter
variation can not only be very e¤ective in detecting structural change or model misspeci…cation,
but it can also signi…cantly improve the forecasting performance of the model, which can have wide
ranging policy applications.
The methodology of Chapter 3 is general and can be applied to any DSGE model and Chapter
4 and 5 are applications of the approach to di¤erent DSGE models. In Chapter 4, we address an
important drawback of DSGE models after the events of 2007-8, namely the lack of a …nancial
sector and as a result, the inability of standard DSGE models to …t well the data in-sample or
forecast out-of-sample after the beginning of the …nancial crisis. To this end, Chapter 4 estimates a
DSGE model with …nancial frictions with the QBLL approach. After allowing for parameter drift,
we …nd that the parameters guiding the …nancial sector in the model do not change after 2008;
instead, the volatility of the …nancial shock doubles in the crisis, suggesting a new interpretation
of the recent crisis as a ‘Bad Luck’event.
In Chapter 5, we apply the QBLL approach to a medium-sized open economy DSGE model for
the UK. The model is known as COMPASS and is the main organising model for policy analysis
and forecasting in the Bank of England. We …nd that the relative importance of the risk premium
shock of the model, measured as the wedge between the policy instrument and the interest rate
that households and …rms face, has increased during the 2008 crisis, indicating changes in the credit
13

availability.
Finally, Chapter 6 summarises the …ndings of the thesis and provides concluding remarks. The
Appendix in Chapter 7 contains the proofs of all propositions, algorithm descriptions and some
additional results.

The QBLL approach
2.1
Introduction
Time varying parameter models have recently received a lot of attention in macroeconometric liter-
ature, due to their ability to accommodate structural changes or breaks in the relationships between
key macroeconomic variables. As the time span of available data increases, it is implausible that
relationships between economic variables remain …xed; consequently, the issue of accommodating
parameter time variation in econometric models, such as vector autoregressions (VARs), has as-
sumed an increasingly prominent role both in theoretical and empirical macroeconometric research.
The standard approach to the estimation of time varying parameter (TVP) VAR models employs
state space methods. In a seminal paper, Cogley and Sargent (2002) study the changing dynamics of
macroeconomic variables in the U.S. using a TVP-VAR with autoregressive coe¢ cients modelled as
random walk processes. In subsequent work, Sims (2001) and Stock (2001) note that the uncovered
parameter drift reported in Cogley and Sargent (2002) may be exaggerated as a result of a time
invariant covariance matrix assumption. Primiceri (2005) and Cogley and Sargent (2005) address
this issue by accommodating drifting volatility in VAR models, the former by employing a procedure
suggested by Kim, Shephard and Chib (1998) and the latter by utilising a Metropolis within Gibbs
algorithm with a technique from Jacquier, Polson and Rossi (1994).
Both approaches require
a parametric speci…cation of the stochastic process generating the volatility parameters.
More
recently, Cogley, Primiceri and Sargent (2010) propose a VAR model, which in addition to drifts
in the parameters and volatilities, also features time varying volatility in the state equations of the
autoregressive parameters.
An alternative to the parametric state space approach is presented in Giraitis et al. (2014), who
propose a nonparametric method for the estimation of the coe¢ cient and variance processes in a
time varying linear regression setting and establish the theoretical properties of their kernel-type
estimator. Their method is extended to a general local likelihood framework that accommodates
consistent and asymptotically normal extremum estimation by Giraitis et al. (2016).
Neither state space models nor the frequentist estimators of Giraitis et al. (2014, 2016) can
accommodate large dimensional systems in the presence of time variation in the parameters. This
Chapter attempts to address this issue by combining the existing nonparametric approach with
Bayesian methods and establishing a quasi-Bayesian local likelihood (QBLL) estimation methodol-
ogy for a general multivariate model with time varying parameters. The QBLL approach augments
15

the frequentist estimators of Giraitis et al. (2016) in order to provide a Bayesian treatment for the
drifting parameters and avoid over-…tting. We prove that the resulting quasi-posterior distributions
are asymptotically valid for inference and con…dence interval construction. In addition, we derive
in closed form a Normal-Wishart expression for the quasi-posterior density in the special case of a
Gaussian VAR model.
Another key issue addressed in this Chapter is the development of an econometric procedure that
can estimate mixtures of time invariant and time varying parameters, by developing several Gibbs
algorithms based on the analytic expressions obtained for the conditional quasi-posterior densities.
It is the Bayesian treatment of this Chapter that facilitates the construction of such algorithms
and to our best knowledge, this is the …rst procedure that can accommodate such mixtures without
imposing parametric assumptions on the parameter processes.
The proposed QBLL method has several advantages over the widely used state space approaches
to drifting parameters.
First, the parameter time variation enters nonparametrically, ensuring
consistent estimation in a wide class of parameter processes, and alleviating the risk of invalid
inference due to misspeci…cation of the state equation.
This point is illustrated further in the
Monte Carlo exercise. Second, unlike standard state space methods, the proposed method does not
su¤er from dimensionality issues. The combination of our closed form quasi-posterior expressions
with Minnesota-type priors, speci…ed directly on the drifting parameters, allows the number of
variables in the VAR to be very large. To illustrate this point, the QBLL approach can handle
estimation of an 87 variable TVP-VAR model (see Section 2.10.2), whereas state space methods
are limited to models with at most 4 variables. The availability of analytic expressions for the joint
quasi-posterior density in the Gaussian VAR case alleviates the computational burden of MCMC
methods used for the estimation of TVP-VARs by state space methods. Another advantage of the
proposed quasi-Bayesian approach is the inverted-Wishart property of the time varying covariance
matrix, which ensures symmetric positive de…niteness of the resulting estimators, without the need
of further restrictions.
We apply our novel QBLL approach to study the changing dynamics in a VAR model with key
U.S. macroeconomic variables. We …nd considerable time variation in the series for the natural rate
of unemployment and core in‡ation, as well as a signi…cant decline in in‡ation persistence after the
beginning of the Great Moderation period. These results con…rm evidence in Cogley and Sargent
(2002, 2005) on the time varying dynamics of in‡ation. We also uncover a fall in the volatilities of
the series after the end of the oil crises, which is in line with evidence presented in Primiceri (2005)
16

and Sims and Zha (2006).
In order to access the forecast record of the QBLL estimators, we design an out-of-sample
forecasting exercise. We …nd that allowing for time varying parameters can improve both point and
density forecasts of BVAR models. Increasing the dimension of the VAR along with parameter time
variation, which is made feasible by the use of the QBLL methodology established in this Chapter,
can enhance forecast performance further, delivering unbiased forecasts and uniform probability
integral transformations. Moreover, the algorithms developed in this Chapter, by accommodating
mixtures of time varying and time invariant parameters, allow us to ‘switch o¤’variation in the
autoregressive component or in the volatility of the VAR and investigate further the source of
forecast improvements. To this end, we …nd that drifts in the autoregressive matrix can eliminate
forecast bias while variation in the volatility improves density forecasts.
The rest of the Chapter is organised as follows. Section 2.2 develops the QBLL methodology
and establishes its asymptotic validity.
In Sections 2.3 and 2.4, we derive closed form quasi-
posterior expressions for the special case of a linear Gaussian regression model and a VAR model
respectively; these expressions provide the building block of a number of Gibbs algorithms developed
in Section 2.8. In Section 2.9, we study the …nite sample properties of the QBLL estimators and
compare them to existing methods in a Monte Carlo experiment. Section 2.10 contains our empirical
contribution to the literature on changing dynamics of in‡ation and monetary policy in the US and
the forecasting exercise. Section 2.11 provides a concluding discussion and Appendix 7.1 contains
all proofs of propositions and some additional algorithms and empirical results.
2.2
Asymptotic Theory
This Section establishes the QBLL methodology for inference in the presence of time varying
parameters. Bayesian analysis is conducted by employing a modi…cation to the Giraitis et al. (2016)
frequentist estimator, augmenting the resulting modi…ed objective function by a prior density and
deriving a posterior density for the purpose of estimation and con…dence interval construction. The
asymptotic validity of the posterior density arising from the QBLL approach is formally established
by Proposition 1 below.
Let yt be an observed time series with log-density lt(ytjyt 1; t); conditional on history yt 1 =
fy1; :::; yt 1g ; depending on a time varying …nite-dimensional vector of parameters t, satisfying
one of the conditions (i)-(ii) presented below.
17

(i) For each t 2 f1; :::; Tg ; t is a deterministic function of time given by
t = 

jjt   jjj2 = Op (h=t) :
(2)
Both (1) and (2) imply that the sequence of parameters drifts slowly with time, a property that
is important for consistent estimation of t. An extremum estimator ^j = arg max `j(j) for j is
derived by maximising an objective function given by
`j(j) :=

using a kernel function and normalised to sum to one:
wjt = ~wjt=
XT
t=1 ~wjt;
~wjt = K
j   t
H

for j; t 2 f1; :::; Tg :
(4)
The kernel function K is assumed to be non-negative, continuous and bounded function with
domain R. The bandwidth parameter H satis…es H ! 1 and H = o(T= log T). For example, the
widely used Normal kernel weights are given by
~wjt = (1=
p
2) exp(( 1=2)((j   t)=H)2) for
t; j = 1; ::; T;
(5)
while the rolling window procedure results as a special case of the choice of a ‡at kernel weights:
wjt = I( jt   jj  H). For further discussion of the advantages of exponential kernels over the ‡at
kernel for introducing time variation, refer to Giraitis et al. (2014) and Giraitis, Kapetanios and
Price (2013). In this setup, Giraitis et al. (2016) show that, under regularity conditions, ^j is an
18

H1=2 + (T=H)1=2- consistent estimator of j for all j = [T], 0 <  < 1. Furthermore, de…ning

for all j = [T], 0 <  < 1, with N(0; I) denoting the multivariate standard normal distribution.
The aim of this Chapter is to provide a Bayesian treatment to this estimation problem. Note
that, while ^j is a consistent extremum estimator, it is not a maximum likelihood estimator because
PT
t=1 wjtlt
 ytjyt 1
is not a log-likelihood function. Let j(j) denote a prior density for j at time
j, assumed to be strictly positive and continuous over a compact parameter space : By combining
this prior density with the objective function of Giraitis et al. (2016) in (3), we obtain
pj(j) =
j(j) exp(`j(j))
R
j() exp(`j())d:
(7)
pj(j) is a proper density for j and can be interpreted as an update to the prior beliefs about j
after observing the data. In this sense, pj(j) can be referred to as a quasi-Bayesian (or Laplace
type) posterior density based on statistical learning. Properties of such quasi-posterior densities
and the resulting estimators1 have been studied by Chernozhukov and Hong (2003) and Tian, Liu
and Wei (2007). In particular, Chernozhukov and Hong (2003) give conditions under which pj(j)
can be asymptotically approximated (in total variation of moments norm) by a normal density. As
explained in Chernozhukov and Hong (2003), in order for pj(j) to be a valid approximation of
a limit distribution for j suitable for con…dence interval construction, a generalised information
matrix equality must apply for an objective function  j that produces an extremum estimator ^j:

where lt is the log-likelihood function that appears in (3), and wjt and {jT are de…ned in (4)
and (6) respectively.
It is clear that the objective functions 'j(j) and `j(j) give rise to the
same maximiser ^j. However, unlike the case  j = `j, the generalised information matrix equality
(8) holds for the objective function  j = 'j; thereby producing a valid posterior variance. The
derivation of the asymptotic results based on objective function (9) is summarised by the following
proposition.

Then, for all j = [T], 0 <  < 1; the quasi-posterior density pj (hj) of the transformation hj,

Remarks
1. The assumptions and proof can be found in Appendix 7.1.1. Assumptions 2 and 3 are high
level assumptions and require veri…cation on a case-to-case basis2.
2In a more recent version of this work, we provide veri…cation of Assumptions 2 and 3 for the linear Gaussian
local likelihood function.

2. By consistency of ^j;
1
{jT r'j(0
j) !p 0 as T ! 1: Proposition 1 therefore implies that when
the sample size T is large, draws from pj(j) have the following approximate distribution:


{jT Jj(0

:
Since {jT ! 1 for all j, we conclude that the mean and median of the quasi-posterior
distribution pj(j) are also consistent. Moreover, con…dence intervals constructed using the
variance of pj(j) provide asymptotically valid inference because the quasi-posterior has the
same asymptotic variance as the extremum estimator of Giraitis et al. (2016).
3. The violation of the information equality (8) by the objective function `j of Giraitis et al.
(2016) is irrelevant for the frequentist estimators studied in that paper; it only becomes an
issue after augmentation of the local likelihood `j by a prior density. To provide an intuition
of why normalisation of the weights by {jT is required in (9), note that, if the weights wjt
satisfy PT
t=1 wjt = 1 as in Giraitis et al. (2016), the local likelihood would not dominate the
prior as T ! 1. For the prior to vanish, we require that the weights wjt sum to something
that increases with the sample size; and in order to obtain the same rate of convergence as
in Giraitis et al. (2016), the weights #jt need to sum to {jT :

Linear Gaussian Multivariate Setting
In this Section we derive closed form Normal-Wishart expressions for the quasi-posterior distribu-
tion of a VAR(k) model with time varying parameters.
Suppose that we have an M  1 dimensional vector yt generated by a time varying parameter

Conditional quasi-posterior distributions
There are two cases of particular interest to be considered for the model (14): …rst, when the
covariance matrix R 1=2
t
is known; second, when the parameter vector t is known. The resulting
closed form conditional quasi-posterior densities, derived in Propositions 4 and 5 below, are useful
for the design of the Gibbs algorithms for estimating model (14) generated by mixtures of …xed
and time varying parameters. These Gibbs algorithms are developed in Section 2.8.
Case 1. For known covariance matrix R 1

Optimal prior shrinkage and optimal lag
If the VAR dimension is large, it is convenient to have an automatic way to select the prior tightness
0j and the most widely used approaches are the Minnesota prior proposed by Litterman (1980)
and the sum of coe¢ cients prior developed by Doan, Litterman and Sims (1984). These require that
the researcher chooses a small number of hyperparameters that control the overall tightness of the
prior. The question of optimal (i.e. data-driven) choice of hyperparameters and the related question
of choosing optimal lag order for the VAR model has received a lot of attention in the Bayesian
literature with papers such as Phillips (1995), Carriero, Kapetanios and Marcellino (2012), Carriero,
Clark and Marcellino (2015a), Giannone, Lenza and Primiceri (2015). To this end, Carriero et al.
(2012, 2015) maximise the marginal likelihood of the data, given by
p(Y ) =
Z Z
p(Y j; R)p(jR)p(R)ddR
over a …ne grid of points for the overall prior tightness (or the lag order). Giannone et al. (2015)
use a hierarchical prior for the overall tightness parameter ; p () which then delivers a posterior
p(jY ) / p(Y j)p():
In the Proposition 8 below, we derive a closed form expression for the quasi-marginal likelihood
p(Y ) in the setup of time varying parameter VAR model. There is one such expression for each
point in time, so that if the researcher wants to obtain optimal shrinkage (or lag order) for the
estimation of the parameters at some point in time j, she can maximise the analytic expression
below at time j with respect to the overall shrinkage hyperparameter or proceed by specifying a
hierarchical prior for it.

Remarks.
1. The quasi-posteriors derived in Proposition 2 and Proposition 4 share similarity with the
Normal-Gamma and Normal-Wishart conjugate posterior results in the Bayesian VAR liter-
ature respectively. However, the QBLL approach is augmented to include the kernel weights
#jt and provides posterior distributions for each point in time j, thereby accommodating time
variation in the parameters. Note that the result in Proposition 1 applies to a system of a
general form; however, since the focus of this Chapter is linear Gaussian models, we restricts
attention on VAR systems.
2. While the model in (13) is of parametric form, the time variation in the parameters is dealt
with nonparametrically: the sequence of parameters needs only satisfy one of the “slow drift”
conditions (1) or (2), which encompass a wide class of processes without the need to impose
a speci…c modelling restrictions on the parameters.
3. The QBLL approach provides a framework for accommodating prior beliefs on the presence
of time variation in the parameters, since the prior parameters are allowed to vary over time.
4. Quasi-Bayesian point estimators for j and R 1
j
can be obtained by using the means of the
quasi-posterior distribution in Proposition 4. For j; the posterior mean is given by ej in
(19). For R 1
j , the Wishart property of Rj implies an inverse Wishart IW(~j; ~j) distribution
for R 1
j , with posterior mean given by ~j=(~j   M   1), in the notation of Proposition 4.
5. In view of the modi…cation of the kernel weights in (9), the quasi-Bayesian estimators in Re-
mark 4 are asymptotically equivalent to the local likelihood estimator of Giraitis et al. (2016)
and thereby inherit the latter’s consistency and asymptotic normality properties. In particu-
lar, ej is a weighted average of the prior mean, 0j; and the local likelihood estimator in (20)
with relative weights given by IM 
(0j +X0DjX) 10j and IM 
(0j +X0DjX) 1X0DjX re-
spectively. The former expression depends positively on the prior tightness  1
0j and converges
to zero as T ! 1; the latter expression converges to 1. Convergence of both expressions (and
27

hence asymptotic negligibility of the priors) applies because the modi…ed kernel weights #jt
ensure that plimT!1 X0DjX = 1. Similarly, the posterior mean for R 1
j
is asymptotically
equivalent to the local likelihood estimator of Giraitis et al. (2016).
6. Despite the asymptotic equivalence of the quasi-Bayesian and local likelihood estimators
discussed in Remark 5, the prior distribution may have a considerable small sample e¤ect: a
suitable choice of prior can improve the …nite sample performance of the frequentist estimator
and can help avoid over-…tting in VAR systems. Moreover, the prior plays an essential role in
large-dimensional VAR systems, where the local likelihood estimator may be unde…ned due
to lack of invertibility of X0DjX. In such cases, the presence of the prior ensures feasibility
of the QBLL estimator.
2.7
Discussion
We provide a discussion of the relative merits of the proposed QBLL approach compared to widely
used state space approaches to the estimation of the time varying parameters j and R 1
j . The most
serious limitation of state space methodology is the inability to accommodate large dimensional
VAR systems, and we provide an additional comparison of our QBLL approach to alternative
methods that are able to deal with large dimensions.
2.7.1
Comparison to state space models
Writing a VAR model in state space requires adding the drifting parameters to a state vector
of latent variables.
This involves the speci…cation of a stochastic process for modelling these
unobserved parameters, with a random walk process being the most common assumption in the
literature (see for example, Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005), Primiceri (2005), Mumtaz and Surico
(2009), Cogley et al. (2010) and Clark (2012)). This assumption is convenient as it is the simplest
way to induce persistence in the parameters and, at the same time, considerably reduces the number
of additional coe¢ cients added to each state equation. However, inaccurate speci…cation of the state
equation as a random walk invalidates inference, even asymptotically. The …nite sample distortions
resulting from such misspeci…cation can be as severe as coverage rates of 30% for a nominal of 95%,
as demonstrated in the Monte Carlo exercise in Section 2.9. Similar evidence for a univariate model
is presented in Appendix 7.1.11. State space models also require additional assumptions about how
the innovations in the newly added state variables are correlated across equations.
28

Although state space models make use of Bayesian tools such as MCMC algorithms, it is
arguable that the drifting parameters no longer receive a Bayesian treatment. While prior distri-
butions are speci…ed for the initial values of the …lter and for the additional coe¢ cients guiding
the processes, the actual drifting parameters are now latent variables. Consequently, some of the
bene…ts of Bayesian estimation are forgone and state space models can run into issues such as non-
stationary draws from the time varying autoregressive matrices or values that make little economic
sense. These di¢ culties can be overcome if prior distributions for the drifting parameters can be
directly speci…ed at each point in time, as is the case with the proposed QBLL estimators.
Another issue that arises when modelling the drifting covariance matrix R 1
j
in a state space
setup is the potential loss of the positive de…nite property of this matrix, if the elements of R 1
j
are modelled as drifting stochastic processes. To address this issue, Cogley and Sargent (2005),
Primiceri (2005) and Cogley et al. (2010) diagonalise the covariance matrix using Cholesky de-
composition and then assume that the diagonal elements follow a random walk in logarithms,
thus ensuring they remain positive. This requires additional modelling assumptions relating to the
stochastic properties of the elements of lower triangular matrix in the Cholesky decomposition.
Diagonalisation of the covariance matrix is useful for conducting structural analysis and Canova
and Perez Forero (2015) shows how to estimate time varying identifying restrictions that are not
necessarily just-identi…ed and recursive. However, in models where structural shock analysis is not
required, diagonalisation has only been employed as means to facilitate estimation of the drifting
volatilities (Cogley and Sargent (2005), Clark (2012)). The QBLL approach permits direct esti-
mation of R 1
j , which has an inverted-Wishart posterior density and hence remains symmetric and
positive de…nite at each point in time, thus making diagonalisation redundant. When applied to
structural shock analysis, the QBLL estimator is informative on the presence of time variation in
the identifying restrictions, this information being an outcome of the estimation procedure rather
than a maintained assumption.
Perhaps the most important limitation to the practical application of state space methodology
is their inability to accommodate large dimensional models. The size and complexity of the state
space increases substantially with the VAR dimension, since an extra state equation is required
for each parameter as well as an additional shock and additional coe¢ cients guiding the process4.
As a result, state space models su¤er from dimensionality problems and their application to the
4For instance, in a state space setting, a four variables TVP VAR (2) with stochastic volatility requires the addition
of 40 state equations.
29

estimation of TVP-VAR models is limited to a model of three to four variables. Additional complex-
ity in the estimation procedure of state space models arises from numerical approximation of the
joint posterior density conducted by MCMC algorithms. On the other hand, the proposed QBLL
methodology admits a closed form joint posterior density, allowing estimation of VAR models of
size of over 80 variables5, as demonstrated in Section 2.10.2.
2.7.2
Comparison to alternative methods for large TVP-VARs
To address the dimensionality problems of state space models, Koop and Korobilis (2013) employ
a ‘forgetting factor’approach, which involves discounting past observations in the Kalman …lter
prediction step. Their approach provides a remedy to the dimensionality problem but remains
susceptible to the modelling limitations of state space methods discussed in the previous Section;
e.g. lack of robustness to misspeci…cation of the state equations.
The paper of Kapetanios, Marcellino and Venditti (2015) also proposes a solution to the dimen-
sionality problem, employing a procedure based on the frequentist kernel estimator of Giraitis et al.
(2016). They propose a stochastic constraint estimator and a ridge estimator in order to achieve
shrinkage of their VAR parameters and avoid over-…tting. Their stochastic constraint estimator
coincides with the mean of the QBLL posterior in equation (19), while their ridge estimator is a
special case of (19). The treatment of the VAR parameters in Kapetanios et al. (2015) is frequentist
and does not allow for: (i) posterior distributions varying over time; (ii) a mechanism for taking into
account prior beliefs about the volatilities. The QBLL approach produces a closed form expression
for the joint posterior density in (18) and can incorporate prior beliefs about R 1
j
in the form of
the parameters 0j and 0j. An additional advantage of the methodology of this Chapter, is that
Bayesian analysis provides a framework for the construction of MCMC algorithms which enables
the estimation of mixtures of time varying and time invariant parameters.
2.8
A Gibbs sampling approach
There are cases when the researcher would like to consider the model (13) outlined in Section 2.5
with time invariant autoregressive coe¢ cients  and time varying variances R 1
t . Such models
have been proposed by Primiceri (2005) and Sims and Zha (2006) have become popular for being
able to …t well macroeconomic data when the sample considered contains periods characterised
5Such a VAR(1) model with 80 variables with time variation in the parameters and the covariance matrix would
require the use of 9720 state equations.
30

by di¤erent volatility; for example, data containing the high volatility periods of the oil crises
followed by the low volatility periods of the Great Moderation. Alternatively, the researcher might
want to keep the variances of the errors …xed over time and allow for time varying autoregressive
coe¢ cients, as in Cogley and Sargent (2002). This approach also has merits: an AR model with
drifting autoregressive coe¢ cients is a ‡exible framework that can …t a range of nonlinearities.
Such models are popular and widely used in other disciplines such as image and signal processing
(see for example, Kitagawa (1996), Abramovich, Spencer and Turley (2007)). Another approach
useful in some applications assumes most parameters to be …xed but one or two, interesting from
economic perspective, are allowed to vary over time.
It is therefore desirable to develop a framework of inference that encompasses all the above
scenaria by allowing for mixtures of time varying and time invariant parameters. To this end, we
utilise the Bayesian theory developed in Section 2.5 in order to design several Gibbs algorithms
that can produce approximate joint posterior distributions for mixtures of time varying and time
invariant parameters. Such cases are not covered by the estimators of Giraitis et al. (2014, 2016)
and are only covered by state space models at the cost of possible state equation misspeci…cation
and VAR dimensionality restrictions, as discussed in Section 2.7. The algorithms proposed below
perform well with di¤erent parameter processes and allow the researcher to remain agnostic about
the parameters’data generating process.
2.8.1
Homoscedastic BVAR model with time varying parameters
Consider an M-dimensional process yt de…ned by a VAR model with time-varying autoregressive
parameters and time invariant volatility: yt = (IM 
 xt)t + R 1=2t;   N(0M; IM); where xt
is a 1  Mk + 1 vector process de…ned in (13) and t is M(Mk + 1)  1 vector of time varying
coe¢ cients:
A Gibbs algorithm that can sample from the joint quasi-posterior of t and R 1 can be con-
structed in the following way. Conditional on a draw R; the model can be rede…ned as
eyt = R1=2yt = extt + t
(24)
where ext := R1=2(IM 
 xt): Assuming a normal prior N(0j; V0j) for the parameter process j, the
quasi-posterior distribution of j, established in Proposition 6, is also normal N(ej; eVj) at each
point in time j with parameters given in (22). On the other hand, conditional on a draw from the
31

history of j; 1:T = (1; :::; T ), the model (24) can be written as e"t = yt (IM 
Xt)t = R 1=2t:
Then, assuming a Wishart prior distribution W(0; 0) for R 1 and stacking eE = (e"1;e"2; :::;e"tT )0,
the conditional posterior of R 1 can be written as R 1jX; Y; 1:T  W(e; e), where
e = 0 + T;
e = 0 + eE0 eE:
(25)
The conditional posterior of R 1 is of standard form and the conditional quasi-posterior distribution
of j, characterised in Proposition 6, can be easily drawn from; hence, the estimation of the model
in (24) permits the use of a Gibbs algorithm with the following steps.
Algorithm 1.
Step 1. Initialise the algorithm with a guess, R 1;0:
Then for i = 1; :::; N, iterate between steps 2 and 3.
Step 2. Draw i
jjY; X; R 1;i 1 from N(ej; eVj) with posterior parameters de…ned in (22) for
each point in time j 2 f1; :::; Tg :
Step 3. Draw R 1;ijX; Y; i
1:T from W(e; e) with posterior parameters de…ned in (25).
Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) results apply as follows. Since the form of the
quasi-posterior distributions has been established and since the steps above constitute a Markov
chain, iterating between step 2 and 3 results into convergence of the distribution of the chain to its
stationary distribution and hence, draws from the algorithm (after discarding a fair proportion of
initial draws) can be used for an approximation of the joint quasi-posterior distribution of j and
R 1.
2.8.2
Heteroscedastic BVAR model with …xed parameters
Consider an M-dimensional process yt de…ned by the model
yt = (IM

(26)
where xt is a 1  Mk + 1 vector process de…ned in (13) and  is M(Mk + 1)  1 vector of
time invariant coe¢ cients: The error term "t has a time varying variance covariance matrix R 1
t .
Conditional on observing a draw of R 1
1:T from the history (R 1

a GLS problem with known time varying covariance matrix. Pre-multiplying equation (26) with

Since, the conditional posterior of  is of standard form and the quasi-posterior distribution
of R 1
j
has been characterised in Section 2.5, a Gibbs algorithm can be constructed in order to
recursively draw from the conditional posterior distributions of  and R 1
1:T to approximate their
joint posterior distribution. The algorithm consists of three steps.

Note that it is easy to extend the models (24) and (26) respectively to include: i) a set of
regressors which enter (24) with time invariant coe¢ cients ; in addition to the regressors Xt which
enter with time varying coe¢ cients t; ii) a set of regressors which enter (26) with time varying
coe¢ cients t in addition to the regressors xt which enter with invariant coe¢ cients, . For space
consideration, the corresponding algorithms are outlined in Appendix 7.1.9.
2.8.3
Time varying structural BVAR model
Algorithms 1 and 2 involve reduced-form VAR models. In macroeconomic applications, structural
VARs (SVARs) are often applied to analyse macroeconomic shocks and transmission of macroeco-
nomic shocks to key variables. SVAR models orthogonalise the VAR residuals so that the resulting
‘structural’shocks have a diagonal covariance matrix. The simplest such orthogonalisation of the
M  M covariance matrix R 1
t
considered in the literature involves a Cholesky decomposition. In
33

particular, consider the model:
yt = (IM 
 Xt)t + "t;
var("t) = R 1
t
= A 1
 1
t A 10
(28)
where 
 1
t
is diagonal matrix with elements !it; varying over time, and A is a lower triangular
matrix with ones on its main diagonal. Providing a Bayesian treatment for the 1
2M(M   1) non-
zero elements of A is straightforward. As shown in Cogley and Sargent (2002), the VAR model can
be written as
A(yt   (IM 
 Xt)t) := Ay
t = 
 1=2
t
t;
t  N(0; IM):
(29)
As argued in Primiceri (2005), the researcher might also want to allow the orthogonalisation scheme
of the structural shocks to be time-varying. In Primiceri (2005), this involves adding the non zero
or one elements of At to the state vector and specifying stochastic processes for them (in his
application, these follow a random walk process). Below, we present an alternative algorithm that
can provide estimates over time of At, by employing the nonparametric kernel-based QBLL method,
which does not require specifying parameter process.

t and At from their conditionally conjugate quasi-(or standard) posterior distributions in

order to approximate their joint quasi-posterior distribution. The kernel approach can be extended
to the estimation of not necessarily just-identi…ed or recursive time varying identifying restrictions;
we leave this question for future research.

Monte Carlo
In this Section, we design a Monte Carlo exercise to study the …nite sample properties of the
QBLL estimators introduced in this Chapter and how they compare to the alternative state space
approach.
We limit our attention to a two dimensional VAR(1) model with no intercept term
(Appendix 7.1.11 contains some earlier Monte Carlo results with a univariate models and also
compares the QBLL approach with non-linear particle …lter). We simulate data using four di¤erent
data generating processes (DGPs) and estimate the models we want to compare based on these
simulated samples. Sample sizes of 100, 500 and 1000 are considered and due to computational
considerations, 300 replications for each DGP and sample size are simulated. In each case, we
compute the bias and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the estimators. For simplicity, the
average bias and the root of the MSE over time are reported, summarised averaging over the
autoregressive and covariance parameters respectively. We also report the 95% coverage rates for
the parameter estimates, computed as the proportion of time that the true parameter …nds itself
in the 95% posterior con…dence intervals implied by the di¤erent models. For the QBLL approach,
we use the means of the quasi-posterior density as point estimates, the normal kernel in (5) for the
kernel weights with bandwidth of T 0:5 and a Minnesota type prior6 with loose overall shrinkage
 = 1: Our choice of bandwidth H = T 0:5 is motivated by the optimal bandwidth choice used for
inference in time varying random coe¢ cient models, see Giraitis et al. (2014). For all state space
models in the Monte Carlo exercise, we use the algorithm outlined in Cogley and Sargent (2005)
with 3,000 Gibbs draws7, modi…ed to allow for time varying Cholesky lower triangular matrix,
whose elements are modelled as a random walk, as in Primiceri (2005). The priors and initial
values of the state space models are set using the initial 10% of the observations as a presample.
6The priors for the autoregressive parameters are as in Ba´nbura, Giannone and Reichlin (2010) with  = 1 and
the Wishart prior parameters for the volatilities are as in Kadiyala and Karlsson (1997).

Table 1. Bias, RMSEs and coverage rates of models based on DGP I for 100, 500 and 1000 observations respectively.
Our motivation is to assess how well models featuring time varying parameters can …t a simple
time invariant model. Table 1 presents the bias, RMSE and coverage rates for the QBLL estimator
featuring time varying parameters and volatility (QBLL_TVP_TVV) and a state space model,
with drifting parameters and volatilities, referred to as SS_TVP_TVV. It is clear from Table 1
that both models deliver valid inference. For small samples, the state space approach has smaller
RMSEs, but when the sample size increases, both models deliver similar performance. With the
increase of the sample size, the coverage rate of the state space model for both the autoregressive
parameters and the variance deteriorates, and when the sample size is 1000, the coverage rate is
considerably below the nominal 95%, implying the presence of type I errors. On the other hand,
the con…dence intervals implied by the QBLL approach remain valid for all sample sizes.
DGP II.

Table 2. Bias, RMSEs and coverage rates of models based on DGP II for 100, 500 and 1000 observations respectively.
The processes used for h21;t, log '11;t and log '22;t resemble random walk processes, but are
normalised by
p
t in order to have …nite variance, see Giraitis et al. (2014). In addition to the two
models we …t to DGP I: QBLL_TVP_TVV and SS_TVP_TVV, we also include a QBLL model
with …xed autoregressive parameters and time varying volatility, estimated using Algorithm 2 in
Section 2.8 (QBLL_FP_TVV) and, similarly, a state space model with constant parameters and
stochastic volatility (SS_FP_TVV). Table 2 displays the bias, RMSEs and coverage rate of the
di¤erent models estimated with data generated with DGP II. It is clear from Table 2 that both
QBLL_TVP_TVV and SS_TVP_TVV approaches perform well, with the state space model
delivering: (i) smaller RMSEs when the sample size is small, for both the parameters and the
volatility, but also, (ii) lower coverage rates (implying too narrow con…dence intervals and the
presence of type I errors) which seem to deteriorate with the sample size. Additionally, the two
models featuring …xed autoregressive coe¢ cients and drifting volatility: QBLL_FP_TVV and
SS_FP_TVV models perform better than QBLL_TVP_TVV and SS_TVP_TVV respectively,
particularly for the autoregressive parameters. This is to be expected, since both have a mechanism
to build this additional information of parameter invariance in the estimation procedure.

Table 3. Bias, RMSEs and coverage rates of models based on DGP III for 100, 500 and 1000 observations respectively.
Table 3 displays the bias, RMSE and coverage rate of the di¤erent models when the data are
generated using DGP III. From Table 3, it clear that both the QBLL model and the state space
model perform well; the state space model delivers smaller RMSEs particularly for the autoregres-
sive parameters. The di¤erences between the two models point estimates narrow when the sample
size increases. Interestingly, the state space model’s con…dence intervals coverage rate deteriorates
with the sample size, implying the presence of type I errors. We …nd that the con…dence intervals
implied by the state space model are sensitive to the tightness of the prior on the variance in the
random walk state equations. We performed a robustness check and found that increasing the prior
tightness delivers worse coverage rates, but loosing the prior, which is a way to ‘let the data speak’,
considerably increases the di¢ culty of obtaining a stationary draw from the autoregressive matrix
of the VAR and therefore the time required to estimate the model8. Figure 1 provides a graphical
representation of the two estimation procedures for a typical realisation of the parameters and from
Figure 1, the estimates of both methods look quite similar.
8In a robustness check, we removed the stability condition on the autoregressive matrix for all DGPs and loosened
the prior on the state equation considerably.
This delivered better coverage rates, coupled with a worse RMSE
performance and a sizeable proportion of non-stable draws. These results are available upon request.

All parameters in DGP IV combine a deterministic time varying process following a sine wave and
a stochastic part, generated by the bounded random walk process, used in DGPs II and III. For
the estimation of the state space model, if the researcher knows ex-ante that the DGP contains a
deterministic time trend, this information can be further added to the state equations. However,
we continue using the random walk processes for the parameters, as these are widely used in the
literature and the motivation behind our choice is to assess the consequences of using the ‘wrong’
state equation. Table 4 summarises the resulting bias, RMSE and coverage rate of the di¤erent
models, including a …xed parameter BVAR model (F_BVAR) and two additional QBLL estimators,

computed using di¤erent values of the bandwidth parameter H, when the sample is simulated using

Table 4. Bias, RMSEs and coverage rates of models based on DGP IV for 100, 500 and 1000 observations respectively. The
table also contains a comparison of the QBLL estimator with bandwidth parameters T 0:45; T 0:5 and T 0:55:
From Table 4 it is clear that both the …xed parameter model and the state space model provide
invalid inference. More importantly, the problem does not vanish asymptotically, with RMSEs and
coverage rates deteriorating with the sample size: the true autoregressive parameters are outside
their 95% con…dence intervals more than 70% of time implied by the state space model, and 80%
of the time implied by the …xed parameter BVAR model for a sample size of 1000. This is evidence
that parameter time variation is an issue that cannot be ignored since …xed parameter models
in this case fail to deliver valid inference and are therefore an unsuitable choice. Moreover, we
highlight once more the point that the state space model also fails to deliver valid inference, as it
models the parameter process parametrically through the state equation and hence its statistical
properties depend on the validity of the assumptions about the state equation. On the other hand,
the nonparametric QBLL estimators remain valid in this case. Figure 2 further illustrates this last
point by displaying typical realisations of the parameters over time: the state space model in this
case does not account well for time variation and provides invalid con…dence intervals. Table 4
also compares the QBLL estimator with bandwidth parameter H = T 0:5 with two alternatives:
H = T 0:45 and H = T 0:55: From Table 4 we see that decreasing the bandwidth reduces the bias
and increases the variance of the estimator. In general, there is a bias-variance trade-o¤ and the
bandwidth selection should depend on how slowly varying the underlying process of the parameters
is, with larger bandwidths delivering smoother estimates. Giraitis et al. (2014) …nd that H = T 0:5
40

Figure 2: DGP IV. Typical realisation of the time varying parameters and volatilities
is asymptotically optimal (in the sense that it minimises the rate of the MSE of the estimator)
but in DGP IV, we …nd that the estimator with slightly larger bandwidth H = T 0:55 delivers best
RMSE performance, while the estimator with H = T 0:45 is best for coverage rates.
To summarise, in this Section we show that the class of QBLL estimators exhibit good …nite
sample properties, comparable and in some cases superior to those of state space models. The
latter may su¤er from type I error with probability increasing with the sample size, as well as
non-decreasing RMSEs in case of misspeci…cation of the state equation’s parametric assumptions.
We …nd that inference based on the quasi-posterior distributions introduced in Section 2.4 not only
delivers valid con…dence intervals in all cases examined but is also robust to di¤erent processes for
the drifting parameters.

Applications to VAR models
2.10.1
Empirical application to U.S. monetary policy and in‡ation persistence
One question that has received a fair amount of attention and that divides the literature on mon-
etary policy in the U.S. is whether the high in‡ation of the 1970’s was an outcome of bad policy,
suggesting the presence of time variation in the policy parameters of the model, or simply bad
luck: a structural change in the size of shocks. In other words, was the subsequent period, referred
to as the Great Moderation, a consequence of good policy under the leadership of Paul Volcker
and Alan Greenspan or was it a good luck event - a decrease in the volatilities of the shocks hit-
ting the economy. Supporters of the former view include Taylor (1993), DeLong (1997), Clarida,
Gali and Gertler (2000) and Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005). On the other hand, Sims (1980),
Bernanke and Mihov (1998), Kim and Nelson (1999), McConnell and Perez Quiros (2000), Sims
and Zha (2006) and Primiceri (2005) have insisted on explaining this phenomenon by the presence
of changing volatility. A related question is whether in‡ation dynamics has changed after the Great
Moderation period and, in particular, has in‡ation persistence decreased or remained constant over
time as a consequence of the change in policy.
In this context, this Section contributes to the literature on changing monetary policy and in-
‡ation dynamics in the U.S. by applying the QBLL methodology proposed in this Chapter and
revisiting classic results presented in Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005), Primiceri (2005) and Cogley
et al. (2010). Empirical contributions arise due to the novel approach of the Chapter which main-
tains an agnostic position on the parameter variation and, in turn, provides drifts in the parameters
which are of nonparametric form and hence robust to state equation misspeci…cations. Additional
contributions arise from the longer sample period, which spans from 1954Q3-2015Q3.
We estimate a structural time varying parameter BVAR(2) model with changing volatility on
the macroeconomic series in Primiceri (2005)9 employing the QBLL approach, introduced in Section
2.4. In addition, following Del Negro (2003)’s recommendation to include commodity prices due to
their key role during the 1970’s, the model is estimated with the addition of commodity prices10 to
the set of variables. The facilitation of the simple Minnesota prior on the autoregressive matrix at
each time point allows to shrink directly the time varying elements and hence ensures stationary
draws from the quasi-posterior. For the application, we use a Normal-inverted-Wishart conjugate
9The set of variables include annual GDP de‡ator in‡ation, civilian unemployment rate and the secondary market
rate on the 3-month Treasury bills. Quarterly series for the unemployment rate and the nominal interest rate were
computed as 3-month averages.
10Commodity prices are measured as annual growth of Moody’s commodity price index.
42

prior with overall Minnesota shrinkage coe¢ cient of 0.2 for the autoregressive parameters as in
Ba´nbura et al. (2010) and prior for the Wishart parameters as in Kadiyala and Karlsson (1997)11.
The model requires no stand on whether the Cholesky identifying restrictions are also time varying
or not; this is an outcome of the estimation: the full contemporaneous covariance matrices are drawn
from inverted-Wishart quasi-posterior and subsequently the Cholesky decomposition is employed
at each point in time. Of course, for the structural analysis an assumption on the ordering of the
variables is required in order to identify the monetary policy shock and we use the ordering in
Primiceri (2005)12. First, we re-write the VAR model in equation (13) in companion form:
zt = t + Atzt 1 + t;
t  N(0; 
t):
(33)
Figure 3 presents the core in‡ation and natural rate of unemployment, which are computed as the
Figure 3: Core in‡ation and natural rate of unemployment
11A range of robustness checks were performed. First, our results are robust to di¤erent lag orders of the VAR
model. In addition, the model was estimated with CPI in‡ation instead of GDP de‡ator; Fed Funds rate instead of
the 3-month Treasury bill, GDP growth instead of unemployement and oil prices instead of commodity prices. The
main results below do not change with these di¤erent speci…cations. Our results are also robust to di¤erent values of
the overall shrinkage coe¢ cient, . In particular, the model was estimated with  = 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 2 and the
main results do not change.
12In particular, the ordering is in‡ation, unemployment and the nominal interest rate last. In addition, commodity
price is ordered …rst. The ordering of commodity price, in‡ation and unemployment is not an identifying assumption
(alternative orderings in the non-policy block were estimated as robustness checks and our results do not change);
however, the ordering of the nominal interest rate is crucial for identi…cation and implies that monetary policy a¤ects
commodity price, in‡ation and unemployment with at least one quarter lag, see Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans
(1999) for details.
43

in…nite horizon forecasts of in‡ation and unemployment implied by the model:
 t = lim
h!1 Etzt+1  (I   At) 1t;
where  t are the resulting stochastic trends of zt. It is remarkable how similar the plots in Figure 3
are both quantitatively and in terms of shape to those presented in Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005),
even though their estimation method is considerably di¤erent. In particular, core in‡ation is around
2% in the 1960s, peaks to 6.5% in the 1970s and then falls down to pre-1970s levels after mid-1980s.
The natural rate of unemployment also peaks in the 1970s but much less sharply, which is consistent
with Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005). More interestingly, since our sample contains the recent
…nancial crisis, Figure 3 allows to assess the natural rate of unemployment during that period and
it is evident that the increase is sharp and large in magnitude with the natural rate reaching 7.5 in
2009, when actual unemployment in the U.S. reached 10%. Figure 3 also suggests a recovery in the
unemployment’s natural rate after 2009. However, it is clear that the posterior con…dence bands
are much wider at the end of the sample implying larger uncertainty about its exact value after
2009. Figure 4 presents the volatilities of the four variables in the model over time13. These are
Figure 4: Volatilities over time
13The variation in the o¤ diagonal elements of the covariance matrix can be found in the Appendix, Section 8.7.
44

consistent with the results presented in Primiceri (2005). In‡ation volatility peaks in the mid-1970s
and then falls dramatically during the Great Moderation period. Unemployment volatility is high
in the late 1950s (note that most of the earlier papers do not use data during the period 1950-1960,
which is typically used as pre-sample). Moreover, unemployment volatility peaks in the mid-1970s
and is relatively low during the 1990s. We …nd that the 2008 …nancial crisis causes not only a large
increase in the unconditional mean of unemployment but also in its variance, which remains high
even after 2014. Finally, from Figure 4 we see that the 3-month Treasury rate’s volatility exhibits
a large increase in 1980 with aggressive monetary policy and tackling in‡ation under the leadership
of Paul Volcker as chairman of the Fed and later falls to pre-1970s levels. Figure 5 compares the
standard deviation of in‡ation from Figure 4 with its unconditional standard deviation, computed
using the companion form of the model in (33) as
V (t) = e

where e is a selection vector. It is worth comparing these results with Cogley et al. (2010) where
they report the unconditional variance for di¤erent measures of in‡ation.
While the standard
deviation of in‡ation peaks only once in the late 1970s, from the right panel of Figure 5 it is clear
that the unconditional standard deviation has a double peak, one around 1973 and another around
1979, coinciding with the two oil shocks. Both results are in line with evidence presented in Cogley
et al. (2010).

Figure 6: In‡ation Persistence over time
Next, we turn to the question of in‡ation persistence implied by the QBLL approach. Cogley
and Sargent (2002) measure persistence as the normalised spectrum of in‡ation at zero. Cogley
et al. (2010) introduce a new measure which they claim can be estimated more precisely. We follow
their de…nition of in‡ation persistence h steps ahead as

:
The measure R2
t;h represents the proportion of total variation explained by past shocks or equiva-
lently one minus the proportion of total variation due to future shocks. It takes values between zero
and one, with large values implying that past shocks die out slowly making in‡ation more persis-
tent and hence predictable. Figure 6 presents the in‡ation persistence, measured by the posterior
mean of R2
t;h; computed at each point in time and for horizons ranging from one quarter to ten
years ahead. In addition, Figure 7 displays the posterior mean of in‡ation persistence for selected
horizons with 16% and 84% con…dence bands. It is evident that in‡ation persistence dies out with
46

lengthening the forecast horizon, which is expected. Furthermore, in‡ation is very persistent in the
1970s and early 1980 with two peaks roughly corresponding to the two oil shocks and persistence
dies out slower over forecast horizons. The left panel of Figure 7 looks similar to what Cogley et al.
(2010) report for in‡ation persistence for one quarter ahead forecasts. However, their TVP-VAR
model delivers draws for R2
t;1 which are very closely clustered at one around 1980 which they in-
terpret as possible misspeci…cation, while from the left panel of Figure 7, it is clear that the QBLL
con…dence bands for R2
t;1 are bounded away from one. Another di¤erence is that the con…dence
bands for R2
t;h in Figure 7, especially at medium horizons, are much more narrow than the ones
presented in Cogley et al. (2010), delivering more precise estimates. Furthermore, due to the longer
sample, we can assess in‡ation persistence during the 2008 …nancial crisis, when quarterly in‡ation
reached negative values in 2009 and it is clear from both Figure 6 and 7 that in‡ation persistence
increases during this period. However, unlike the period of 1970-1980s, in 2008 the R2
t;h measure
dies out quickly over the forecast horizon and at 12 steps ahead there is no di¤erence in in‡ation
persistence during the crisis compared to previous periods.

Table 5. Posterior probabilities of change in in‡ation persistence for pair-wise periods. The table displays the probability of an
increase of in‡ation persistence between 1960Q1 and 1980Q1 and of a decrease between 1980Q1 and 2006Q1 respectively.
To address the question of whether there is statistical evidence of higher persistence in 1980
47

compared to 1960 and statistically lower persistence in 2006 compared to 1980, Table 5 reports the
posterior probabilities of an increase between 1960 and 1980 and those of a decrease between 1980
and 2006. The values in Table 5 suggest evidence of the presence of statistically signi…cant change
in in‡ation persistence for di¤erent horizons at levels close to 90% and this con…rms the evidence
presented in Cogley et al. (2010).
Next, we turn to the question of structural change in monetary policy. First, we can investigate
the systematic component of monetary policy by computing the degree of monetary policy activism.
Figure 8 displays the policy activism parameter, at; computed as: at =
bt
1 t ; where bt and t are the
coe¢ cients of one period lagged in‡ation and interest rate respectively in the interest rate equation
of the VAR model. Periods in which at is below one can be interpreted as periods characterised by
passive monetary policy or periods in which the Taylor principle is violated (see Woodford (2003)
for details). From Figure 8, it is clear that the degree of policy activism implied by the QBLL
approach is always above one, implying that we do not …nd evidence of passive monetary policy
even in the periods of the oil crises. This result is at odds with evidence presented in Cogley and
Sargent (2002, 2005) and since the QBLL approach is nonparametric with respect to the parameter
processes, the time variation in at, and hence the validity of this result, do not depend on state
equation assumptions. It is also evident from Figure 8 that during the …rst years of the appointment
of Paul Volcker as a chairman of the Fed, the degree of policy activism is higher than other periods.
This is consistent with a Taylor rule featuring changing parameters and supporting evidence is
presented in Chapter 3 where we …nd in a linearised DSGE model with time varying parameters
that there is an increase in the in‡ation targetting coe¢ cient after the appointment of Paul Volcker.
They also …nd that this increase coincides with a decrease in the output gap coe¢ cient, suggesting
that the Fed was giving priority to unemployment over the oil crises period.
Finally, we employ our time varying BVAR model for structural shock analysis in order to
assess structural changes in the non-systematic component of monetary policy.
We investigate
whether there is evidence for changes in the transmission mechanism of the monetary policy shock
to variables, resulting from the documented time variation in the parameters. Figure 9 displays
the impulse response functions of in‡ation, unemployment and the nominal rate to a monetary
policy shock. The top panel presents responses to a unit of the shock and hence measures only
changes in the transmission of the shock over time without taking into account changes in the
volatility. The bottom panel displays the responses to a one standard deviation of the shock and
these incorporate the decrease in the volatility of the monetary policy shock over the second half
48

Figure 8: Monetary policy activism over time
Figure 9: IRFs to monetary policy shock after including commodity prices
49

of the sample. From Figure 9, it is evident that in‡ation responds negatively to a unit shock of
monetary policy apart from the periods around 1960 and 2008, i.e. there is a price puzzle during
these periods: in‡ation increases with a positive monetary policy shock. Most of the puzzle goes
away when considering the changing size of the shock over time and it is clear from the bottom
left panel of Figure 9 that in‡ation responds substantially more to an unanticipated monetary
policy shock during Paul Volcker’s chairmanship than in any other period. Further evidence for
Figure 10: IRFs to unit monetary policy shock for selected periods
the increase in the in‡ation responsiveness to monetary policy shock can be found in the top panel
of Figure 10, from where it is clear that the di¤erence in in‡ation response between 1981Q3 and
1975Q114 is statistically signi…cant. Interestingly, it appears from Figure 9 that in‡ation becomes
less responsive to a monetary policy shock after the end of the second term of Paul Volcker in 1987
and from Figure 10 we also …nd statistically signi…cant di¤erence between in‡ation responses during
Volcker’s and Greenspan’s years. Similarly, unemployment becomes less responsive to monetary
policy shocks during the Great Moderation period.
These results are consistent with evidence
presented in Boivin and Giannoni (2006), who interpret the decreased responsiveness of in‡ation
and output to a monetary policy shock after the 1980s which they also …nd in their application, as
an outcome of the monetary authority becoming more e¤ective and systematically more responsive
14The choice of dates for Figure 10 was motivated by Primiceri (2005), who uses the same periods for comparison.
He argues that these periods are representative of the typical economic conditions of the chairmanships of Burns,
Volcker and Greenspan, respectively.
50

in managing economic ‡uctuations after 1980. Finally, unemployment responds negatively to a
positive policy shock during the recent crisis, which goes against standard monetary policy theory.
This period is characterised by record high unemployment coupled with unconventional monetary
policy, which cannot be captured by the nominal interest rate instrument frozen around the zero
lower bound (ZLB). Hence, the model implied monetary policy shock is disabled during this period
and cannot account for unemployment changes.
This shortcoming can be addressed in several
ways. One could to simply end the sample period at 2008 and this strategy has been employed
by many in the literature. However, since the VAR model in (33) has a mechanism to account for
structural change explicitly, the events in 2008 do not contaminate estimates in distant periods15
and hence we choose to use the entire sample available.
Alternatively, if we would like to say
something about monetary policy in this period, then additional variables should be added to
proxy for the unconventional monetary policy (for example, Baumeister and Benati (2013) identify
an unconventional monetary policy shock as a shock to the spread of the 10 year Treasury yield
over the nominal rate, while the nominal interest rate is unchanged at the ZLB). We leave this
issue to future research and instead remain cautious in interpreting these results as anything other
than misspeci…cation due to omitted variables.
To summarise, we applied our novel QBLL approach to revisit much debated issues of changing
macroeconomic dynamics, introduced in Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005), Primiceri (2005) and
Cogley et al. (2010). We found that not only does the volatility of the series change over time but
also the autoregressive component of the VAR, implying that whereas there has been a change in
policy, especially after Paul Volcker’s appointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve, there has
also been a ‘luck’component implied by the considerable time variation uncovered in the volatility
of the series. Our QBLL estimator delivers results broadly consistent with evidence presented in
Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005) and evidence of in‡ation persistence in Cogley et al. (2010), even
though the estimation procedures di¤er considerably. In particular, unlike the parametric state
space approach used in previous papers, the QBLL procedure is nonparametric with respect to
the parameter processes and hence robust to various speci…cations. It is worth noting that the
proposed methodology has the added advantage of being considerably simpler and computationally
cheaper to implement and permits increasing the dimension of the VAR model to include additional
relevant variables.
15In a robustness check, we estimated the model with sample ending in 2007Q4 and the estimation results for the
pre-crisis periods do not change.

2.10.2
Forecasting exercise
In this Section we design a pseudo out-of-sample forecasting exercise in order to assess the forecast-
ing record of the proposed QBLL approach. In particular, we compare the forecasts of various sizes
BVAR models, with and without time varying parameters, using US data. The dataset16 is from
Stock and Watson (1996), spanning from 1950Q2 to 2014Q1. The dataset contains 87 quarterly
macroeconomic series in …rst di¤erence17. The forecast origins range from 1970Q2 to 2010Q2 and
we compute forecasts for one up to eight quarters ahead. Accuracy of point forecasts is measured
using the root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE) and forecast bias. Forecast density perfor-
mance is evaluated using log predictive scores and probability integral transformation (PIT). The
logscores and PITs are computed with the help of a nonparametric estimator to smooth the draws
from the predictive density obtained for each forecast and horizon. We test whether a model is
statistically more accurate than the benchmark against the two-sided alternative, with the Diebold
and Mariano (1995)’s statistic computed with Newey-West estimator to obtain standard errors.
The results of the Diebold-Mariano test are provided for the RMSFEs and logscores. For the bias,
we test whether the models’bias is statistically di¤erent from zero. In addition, uniformity of the
PITs is assessed using the test statistic of Berkowitz (2001), with a null hypothesis of uniform PITs.
We begin by estimating a set of small BVAR models which include 3 macroeconomic vari-
ables: GDP growth, in‡ation and the 3-month Treasury rate. The models are: a …xed parameter
BVAR model (F_BVAR), a time varying parameter and volatility BVAR model estimated using
the closed form QBLL expressions derived in Proposition 4 (QBLL_TVP_TVV), a drifting para-
meter homoscedastic BVAR model estimated with the Gibbs algorithm proposed in Section 2.8.1
(QBLL_TVP_FV) and an invariant parameter heteroscedastic BVAR estimated with the Gibbs
algorithm developed in Section 2.8.2 (QBLL_FP_TVV). All BVAR models are of lag order one
and use a Normal-inverted-Wishart conjugate prior with overall shrinkage for the autoregressive
parameters as in Ba´nbura et al. (2010) and prior Wishart parameters as in Kadiyala and Karlsson
(1997). In addition, the use of a small dataset permits comparison with alternative state space
TVP-BVAR models.
For the comparison, we estimate three di¤erent state space models: one
with both autoregressive parameters and volatilities varying over time, one with invariant volatili-
16Detailed variable descriptions and data transformations can be found in Appendix 8.7.
17The choice of using a VAR model in …rst di¤erence is motivated by results in Carriero, Galvão and Kapetanios
(2015), who show in a forecast evaluation containing various models and countries, that their BVAR model in
di¤erences performs better on average than the one in levels.

ties and drifting parameters and one with invariant parameters and drifting volatilities18, labelled
SS_TVP_TVV, SS_TVP_FV and SS_FP_TVV respectively. Following the literature (Cogley
and Sargent (2002), Primiceri (2005), Clark (2012), Mumtaz and Surico (2009)), the parameters,
the elements of the lower triangular matrix and the log volatilities are all assumed to follow random
walk processes.

Table 6. RMSFEs and forecast bias. The …gures in the left panel under F_BVAR are absolute RMSFEs, the …gures under
the remaining models are ratios of RMSFEs over the F_BVAR model. The …gures in the right panel display forecast bias for
each model. ‘*’, ‘**’ and ‘***’ indicate rejection of the null of equal performance or zero forecast bias against the two-sided
alternative at 10%, 5% and 1% signi…cance level respectively.
The left panel of Table 6 presents the absolute performance of the small time invariant BVAR
model (in RMSFEs) and the relative performance of alternative models over di¤erent horizons (num-
bers smaller than one imply superior performance of the particular model relative to F_BVAR). It
18We use versions of the algorithms outlined in Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005) with 10,000 Gibbs draws from
which the …rst 5,000 have been discarded. The priors and initial values are set using a presample of 30 observations.
53

is evident that the performance of all small models is very similar. In particular, they can rarely im-
prove over the …xed parameter BVAR model for GDP growth and the 3-month Treasury rate, while
all models deliver large and signi…cant improvements in terms of RMSFEs for in‡ation. This is not
surprising, given the evidence of considerable structural change in in‡ation dynamics presented in
Section 2.10.1. The right panel of Table 6 presents the forecast bias of the di¤erent models over
the sample (positive numbers imply positive bias) and one, two and three stars indicate rejection
of the null of zero forecast bias at signi…cance levels of 10%, 5% and 1% respectively.
From the right panel of Table 6, the …xed parameter BVAR displays a large signi…cant positive
bias for GDP growth. This is expected as the evaluation periods span from 1970Q2 up to 2010Q2
and arguably contain periods characterised by serious structural change. To give an illustration of
the issue, in the beginning of the …rst oil crisis, the …xed parameter model delivers estimates by
averaging the data from the pre-crisis insample period and even after the beginning of the crisis,
it continues to overestimate output. On the other hand, time varying parameter models have a
mechanism to capture the change in the relationships between variables and hence reduce bias.
The QBLL approach also uses the insample period but progressively discounts distant data, giving
more weight to the near past, and delivers unbiased forecasts. A more surprising result is that state
space models featuring time variation in the parameters, and hence a mechanism to account for
structural change, cannot improve systematic errors in the forecasts for GDP growth, implied by
the statistically signi…cant forecast bias. The gains of the QBLL_TVP_TVV over the state space
models could be explained by recalling that unlike state space models, the QBLL approach does not
force a parametric model on the parameter processes, which are allowed to vary freely and hence
…t data better. Another interesting result is that while allowing the variances to change with the
QBLL_FP_TVV model does not help with the bias, allowing for variation in the autoregressive
parameters with the QBLL_TVP_FV model makes GDP growth forecasts unbiased. This is an
indication that variation in the autoregressive component of the VAR is important for reducing
forecast bias.
Table 7 accesses the quality of the density forecasts measured by logscores and PITs of the
predictive density. The left panel of Table 7 displays absolute log predictive score for the F_BVAR
model and di¤erences in logscores for the alternative models, so numbers greater than zero imply
superior performance over the F_BVAR. The right panel of Table 7 presents the p-values of the
chi-squared Berkowitz (2001) test of uniformity of the PITs for all models (for example, numbers
smaller than 0.05 indicate rejection of the null of uniform PITs at 5%). All models can deliver sta-
54

tistically signi…cant improvements for in‡ation over the benchmark in terms of log predictive score.
This is most likely a consequence of the superior point forecast implying that the forecast density
is centered more precisely around the ex-post realised value. In addition, some models can also
deliver superior forecast density performance for output growth and the interest rate. It is evident
that the models with drifting volatility and …xed parameters SS_FP_TVV and QBLL_FP_TVV
perform better than their counterparts, SS_TVP_FV and QBLL_TVP_FV. This can be further
seen from the PIT p-values in the right panel of Table 7, reinforcing the view that for improving
density forecasts, it is crucial to allow for changing volatility rather than variation in the autore-
gressive parameters.

Table 8. RMSFEs. The …gures under F_BVAR are absolute RMSFEs, the …gures under the remaining models are ratios of
RMSFEs over the F_BVAR model. ‘*’, ‘**’and ‘***’indicate rejection of the null of equal performance against the two-sided
alternative at 10%, 5% and 1% signi…cance level respectively, using a Diebold - Mariano test.
Next, we investigate whether including additional variables to the model can improve the fore-
cast performance. This choice is motivated by the forecasting literature (Ba´nbura et al. (2010),
Koop (2011), Carriero, Clark and Marcellino (2015a)), which suggests good forecasting record of
large dimensional BVAR models. In particular, we estimate two models: (i) a …xed parameter model
(F_BVAR), and (ii) a time varying parameter model with changing volatility (QBLL_TVP_TVV),
on a medium size dataset (consisting of 17 macroeconomic variables described in Appendix 7.1.10).
Using the medium dataset, we also estimate two mixture of time varying and time invariant pa-
rameter models using Algorithms 1 and 2 developed in Sections 2.8.1 and 2.8.2 respectively: (i)
QBLL_FP_TVV is a BVAR model with time invariant parameters and time varying volatility,
and (ii) QBLL_TVP_FV is a BVAR model with time varying autoregressive coe¢ cients and
56

homoscedastic covariance matrix. Finally, we estimate two large BVAR models19 using the en-
tire dataset (consisting of 87 variables):
(i) a model with time invariant parameters labelled
F_BVAR_L, and (ii) a model, estimated with the QBLL approach, featuring time varying pa-
rameters and time varying volatility (QBLL_TVP_TVV_L).

Table 9. Forecast bias. The …gures display forecast bias for each model. ‘*’, ‘**’and ‘***’indicate rejection of the null of zero
forecast bias against the two-sided alternative at 10%, 5% and 1% signi…cance level respectively.
Table 8 presents the absolute performance of the medium time invariant BVAR model (in RMS-
FEs) and the relative performance of alternative models over di¤erent horizons. From Table 8, it
is clear that even a time invariant model with additional variables can outperform the small time
varying model, SS_TVP_TVV, for GDP growth. In addition, the various time varying medium
19As explained in Ba´nbura et al. (2010), the overall shrinkage, , should be invertly proportional to the size of the
model. The shrinkage parameter for the small models is 0.3, for the medium models 0.2, and for the large models 0.11.
A grid for other values of  were considered for each model and size and whereas the absolute forecast performance
of the models depends on ; the relative models’performance presented in this section is robust to di¤erent values
of :
57

and large models can outperform the SS_TVP_TVV for in‡ation implied by the larger improve-
ments over the …xed parameter model. The best performing model for in‡ation is the medium
size QBLL_TVP_TVV model. In addition, the time varying speci…cations can improve RMSFE
performance of the F_BVAR for consumption growth and PCE growth.

Table 10. Log predictive scores. The …gures under F_BVAR are absolute log scores, the …gures under the remaining models
are di¤erences of log scores from the F_BVAR model. ‘*’, ‘**’ and ‘***’ indicate rejection of the null of equal performance
against the two-sided alternative at 10%, 5% and 1% signi…cance level respectively, using a Diebold - Mariano test.
Table 9 presents the forecast bias of the di¤erent models. It is evident that, while statistically
signi…cant forecast bias is present in medium and large time invariant models, the forecasts of
the medium and large time varying speci…cations are virtually unbiased for all variables and all
58

horizons.
More interestingly, when we consider the medium model with drifting volatility and
time invariant autoregressive component, we also …nd forecast bias in some variables.
On the
other hand, allowing for drifting autoregressive parameters when the volatility is held constant
over time removes the bias. This con…rms the results from the small models: variation in the
autoregressive component of the VAR can signi…cantly reduce systematic errors in the forecasts.
Table 10 accesses the quality of the density forecasts of the medium and large models. It displays
absolute log predictive score for the F_BVAR model and di¤erences in logscores for the alternative
models. We see from Table 10 that the various time varying speci…cations can deliver forecast
density improvements for most variables. In particular, the best performing model is the large
time varying parameter and volatility model, QBLL_TVP_TVV_L, implying that by including
additional variables we can obtain superior estimates of the uncertainty around the point forecast.

Table 11. PITs. The …gures display p-values of the chi-squared Berkowitz (2001)’s test of uniformity for all models, values
greater than 0.05 indicate that we cannot reject the null of uniformity at 95%.
Finally, Table 11 presents the p-values of the chi-squared Berkowitz (2001) test of uniformity
59

for all medium and large models. From Table 11, it is clear that for time invariant models, both
medium and large, we can reject the null of uniform PITs for most variables and horizons. On the
other hand, for the medium time varying model, QBLL_TVP_TVV, we cannot reject the null of
uniformity for all variables one step ahead. The large time varying model, QBLL_TVP_TVV_L,
also performs exceptionally well. Another important result is that the model featuring drifting
volatility and invariant autoregressive parameters performs better in terms of PITs than the model
with drifting parameters and invariant volatility, con…rming our previous result that for density
forecast performance, drifting volatility is more important than drifting autoregressive parameters.
To summarise, a forecasting exercise was conducted, where we estimated various sizes …xed and
time varying parameter BVAR models. Several conclusions emerged: …rst, the small QBLL models
can deliver model forecast performance similar to that of state space models. Second, the QBLL
approach allows to increase the number of variables in the system: as we demonstrated increasing
the VAR dimension while allowing for time variation in the parameters can improve both point and
density forecasts over (i) small models, and (ii) invariant models of the same dimensions. Third,
the QBLL approach performs exceptionally well in eliminating forecast bias as well as in delivering
uniform PITS and this is true for most variables and horizons. Finally, by assessing the forecast
performance of BVAR models with mixtures of time varying and time invariant parameters, we
reached an important conclusion: allowing for drifting volatility in a BVAR model improves density
forecasts compared to a model with invariant volatility; on the other hand, time variation in the
autoregressive component of the VAR model can signi…cantly reduce forecast bias.
Since both
point and density performance is crucial for forecasting, we conclude that variation in both the
parameters and variances of BVAR models should be considered.

Summary
This Chapter establishes a novel quasi-Bayesian local likelihood (QBLL) approach for econometric
inference in models with time varying parameters. The Bayesian framework is based on augmenting
the local likelihood of Giraitis et al. (2016) with a prior distribution; this augmentation principle
delivers asymptotically valid quasi-posterior distributions which admit closed form expressions in
the special case of a linear Gaussian univariate regression model and multivariate VAR model. The
approach is of su¢ cient generality and ‡exibility to give rise to Gibbs algorithms that are able to
sample from a BVAR model with a mixture of time varying and time invariant parameters.
The Monte Carlo exercise demonstrates that the class of QBLL estimators based on: (i) the
60

closed form joint distribution derived in Section 2.4; (ii) the proposed MCMC algorithms in Section
2.8, both exhibit good …nite sample properties, and inference based on their quasi-posterior densities
delivers valid con…dence intervals. Importantly, QBLL inference is robust to di¤erent processes for
the drifting parameters, as its validity does not depend on parametric restrictions typically imposed
by state space models.
The novel QBLL approach is employed to empirically address the issue of changing macroeco-
nomic dynamics in the U.S. and con…rms previous results of Cogley and Sargent (2002, 2005) and
Primiceri (2005) on the presence of signi…cant structural change in core in‡ation and the natural
rate of unemployment as well as of substantial drifts in the volatility of the series. In the light of
these results, we conclude that ignoring the time variation (by instead estimating a time invariant
model) will result in invalid inference on the model’s parameters. We also …nd that in‡ation has
become signi…cantly less persistent after the beginning of the Great Moderation, which is in line
with more recent results in Cogley et al. (2010).
Finally, in a forecasting exercise we …nd that the QBLL estimators deliver excellent forecast
performance. Their ability to accommodate drifting parameters nonparametrically delivers forecast
improvements over …xed parameter models, such as virtually unbiased forecasts and uniform PITs.
In addition, their capacity to considerably increase the number of variables can improve both point
and density forecasts of small-dimensional models. We …nd that both drifts in the volatility and in
the parameters can have important impact on forecasting: drifts in the volatility improve density
forecasts while time variation in the autoregressive component signi…cantly reduces forecast bias.

Time Varying Parameter DSGE Model
3.1
Introduction
Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models are popular tools extensively used in
both academic work and macroeconomic policy making. Their success is a result of their capacity
to combine economic microfoundations derived from optimisation decisions of agents with rational
expectations and business cycle ‡uctuations. Traditionally, the consensus in the macroeconomic
literature has been that there exists an apparent trade-o¤ between theoretical coherence, whereby a
model’s outcomes can be explained by well-established theory, and empirical coherence, whereby a
model can …t and explain macroeconomic data well, but its outcomes are often di¢ cult to interpret
or justify from a theoretical standpoint. Models that exhibit theoretical and empirical coherence
simultaneously were deemed infeasible. DSGE models were alleged to be at the theoretical end
of this trade-o¤ curve. On the other hand, reduced-form models, such as VAR models, exploiting
correlations in time series with little reliance on macroeconomic theory, were put at the empirical
end. It was the work of Smets and Wouters (2003, 2005, 2007), based on earlier work of Rotemberg
and Woodford (1997) and Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005), that changed this perception
and demonstrated that medium-sized DSGE models can be successfully taken to the data and
produce superior forecasts to standard BVAR models. Following Smets and Wouters, the literature
on DSGE model estimation and forecasting has become a vibrant area of research with considerable
progress in the development of the underlying economic theory and the design of numerical solution
and estimation algorithms.
At the heart of DSGE models are so called deep parameters that de…ne the preferences and
technological environment of the economy. These are kept constant and are structural in the sense
that they are not subject to the Lucas critique - they are invariant to both policy and structural
shocks. There are two issues related to these parameters that this Chapter will address. First, it
is important to recognise the possibility of parameter drift in order to re-evaluate the usefulness
and relevance of DSGE models.
If substantial evidence is found that some of these structural
parameters are in fact not constant, this could be interpreted as a need to revise existing models
in order to account for such variation. It is possible that slow time variation is the outcome of long
term cultural or technological shifts in the economy that DSGE models are ill-equipped to model,
since they focus primarily on business cycle ‡uctuations. Nevertheless, taking into account such
slow variation is paramount for the e¤ective use of DSGE models. Furthermore, time variation in
62

these parameters can be a signal for misspeci…cation in existing models and hence a guide to amend
and improve them. Second, these models are widely used in forecasting both by academics and
o¢ cial institutions. Hence, allowing the structural parameters to change and using only their most
recent values for generating predictions seems like a useful modi…cation that would be expected to
improve forecasting performance, possibly at the cost of making the separation between structural
and reduced-form models less clear.
To accommodate such time variation in DSGE model parameters, this Chapter applies a quasi-
Bayesian Local Likelihood (QBLL) method, developed in a general reduced-form setting in Chapter
2.
QBLL estimates parameters at each point in time, appropriately weighting the sum of log
likelihoods of the sample, with weights generated by a kernel function. The method is general
and can be applied to any DSGE model.
Furthermore, for generating forecasts, it is no more
computationally intensive than estimating a DSGE model with …xed parameters.
This and next two Chapters contribute to a small but expanding literature on estimating DSGE
models with time variation in the parameters which has two strands. Fernandez-Villaverde and
Rubio-Ramirez (2008) and Justiniano and Primiceri (2008) model time variation by assuming
stochastic processes for a subset of the parameters and include these to the set of state equations.
For instance, Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008) assume that the agents, in the model,
take into account current and future parameter variation, utilising the parameters’representation
as stochastic processes when computing their expectations.
A similar assumption is made by
Schorfheide (2005), Bianchi (2013), Foerster, Rubio-Ramirez, Waggoner and Zha (2014), but the
parameters are modelled as Markov-switching processes. In contrast, Canova (2006), Canova and
Sala (2009) and Giacomini and Rossi (2009) assess parameter time variation by estimating DSGE
models over rolling samples.
A similar strategy was followed by Castelnuovo (2012), Cantore,
Levine and Melina (2012) and Canova and Ferroni (2012). It is useful to contrast our work with
both these strands. This …rst strand makes parametric assumptions about the variation in the
parameters. These assumptions are not microfounded but have a reduced form ‡avour. Instead,
the method presented in the current Chapter is agnostic about the source of the variation apart from
assuming that it is slow, although given some time it can track more abrupt forms of change. Given
the considerable likelihood that any changes are the result of long term cultural and technological
shifts that no mainstream business cycle model is well equipped to explain, this agnostic approach
has merit. A further issue is that computational complexity restricts the ability of allowing for time
variation to only a small subset of the model parameters whereas our approach is scaleable to the full
63

set of parameters. Concerning the second strand, our proposed method employs a nonparametric
kernel-based procedure that encompasses rolling window estimation as a special case. The approach
presented in the current Chapter is an extension and formalisation of rolling window estimation,
generalised by combining kernel-generated local likelihoods with appropriately chosen priors to
generate a sequence of quasi-posterior distributions for the objects of interest over time, following
the methodology developed in Chapter 2. Evidence provided in Giraitis et al. (2014) suggests
that other kernel functions may have more desirable propeties than the ‡at kernel underlying
the rolling window. Our approach is related to the one in Giraitis, Kapetanios, Theodoridis and
Yates (2013), but they apply the local kernel estimator developed by Giraitis et al. (2014) to
the minimum distance estimator that matches DSGE and VAR impulse responses, to provide a
frequentist estimation approach. Both the kernel and the rolling window approaches, when applied
to structural models, assume that, instead of being endowed with perfect knowledge about the
economy’s data generating process, agents take parameter variation as exogenous when forming
their expectations about the future. This assumption facilitates estimation and can be rationalised
from the perspective of models featuring learning problems, where agents form beliefs about the
parameters based on observing past data. For example, Cogley and Sargent (2009) utilise Kreps
(1998)’s anticipated utility approach, where in each period agents employ their current beliefs as
the true (time invariant) parameters. They show that in the presence of parameter uncertainty,
the anticipated utility approach outperforms the rational expectation approximation.
A recent
application of the anticipated utility approach is Johannes, Lochstoer and Mou (2015), where
assets are priced at each point in time, using current posterior means for the parameters and
assuming that current values will last inde…nitely in the future. At each period, agents learn the
new parameter values and adjust their expectations20.
One aim of the following Chapters is to improve the accuracy of DSGE models in forecasting.
Smets and Wouters (2007) show that their medium-sized DSGE model can generate forecasts for
seven US macro variables that are superior to those obtained from a BVAR model. The gains of the
structural model over the reduced-form model are substantial especially at longer horizons. Addi-
tional evidence that DSGE models may deliver competitive forecasts in comparison with statistical
models and survey of professional forecasters is provided by Rubaszek and Skrzypczynski (2008),
Steinbach, Mathuloe and Smith (2009), Edge, Kiley and Laforte (2009), Edge and Guerkaynak
20A similar outcome can be achieved in a linearised DSGE model with random walk processes for the drifting
parameters (a frequently made assumption in the time varying parameter VAR literature), where rational expectations
on the side of agents would imply that the future values of the parameters are equal to the current posterior means.
64

(2010), Wieland and Wolters (2011) and Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b). To the best of our
knowledge, there is no documented evidence of the forecasting performance of a DSGE model with
time variation in the parameters. The closest to ours is the working paper by Edge, Guerkaynak
and Kisacikoglu (2013) who use rolling window scheme to assess the forecasting record of a DSGE
model.
The Chapter is organised as follows. Section 3.3 introduces the Quasi-Bayesian Local Likelihood
approach in the context of DSGE models including a Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm for het-
eroscedastic time invariant DSGE model, Section 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 present an empirical application
based on the Smets and Wouters (2007) model, Section 3.7 provides a forecasting comparison and
Section 3.8 concludes.
3.2
Time Variation in DSGE Models
In the context of DSGE model estimation, there are advantages of adopting a Bayesian approach.
Bayesian methods provide a natural way of combining econometric estimation with information
provided by calibration methods widely used in the previous generation of models (see Kydland
and Prescott (1996)). For example, by construction, we know that the discount factor, , that
consumers use to discount expected future utility cannot take negative values, is bounded between
zero and one and a typical value based on the assumption of a 4% annual discount rate is 0.99.
Adding a probability mass in the form of a prior is a natural way to incorporate such additional
information which is not contained in the data and serves as augmenting the likelihood with arti…cial
observations. In addition, the likelihood of DSGE models may often be ill-identi…ed or not globally
concave. Adding a prior can resolve such issues and make the problem well-de…ned (see, Lindley
(1971)).
Finally, a Bayesian approach can deal in a natural way with model misspeci…cation.
Instead of assuming that there is a unique parameter vector that contains the "true" values of all
parameters, the Bayesian approach considers the parameters as random variables and the estimation
procedure as a learning process with respect to the characteristics of these random variables, after
incorporating information on the available data. An and Schorfheide (2007) and Del Negro and
Schorfheide (2013a) o¤er a detailed review of Bayesian inference in the context of DSGE models.
Here, we follow the methodology from Chapter 2. Let pt(t) denote a prior distribution for t
at time t. Then, the quasi-posterior pt(tjY ) is given by:
pt(tjY ) =
pt(t)Lt(Y jt)
R
pt(t)Lt(Y jt)d / pt(t)Lt(Y jt)
65

where Lt(Y jt) is the local likelihood function, Lt(Y jt) =
T
Y
j=1
L(yjjyj 1; t)wtj for t = 1; ::; T,
Y = (y1; ::; yT )0; and L(yjjyj 1; t) denotes the likelihood for observation j, conditional on the
history yj 1. As demonstrated in Chapter 2, this provides a generic quasi-Bayesian principle for
estimating general time varying coe¢ cient models that require little more than standard Bayesian
numerical techniques applicable to …xed coe¢ cient models. The discussion and results in Chapter
2 related chie‡y to time variation in reduced form models. One advantage of our method is that it
is applicable without conjugacy: if the posterior did not belong to a known distributional family,
other MCMC methods can be used to generate draws from that posterior. Here, we extend the
method and outline how it can be applied to the estimation of a DSGE model.
The literature on time varying DSGE models is less developed than that on time varying re-
duced form models and more contraversial. The alternative approach of specifying processes for the
drifting parameters in a DSGE context has been applied for instance by Fernandez-Villaverde and
Rubio-Ramirez (2008). The main advantage of their approach is that agents populating the model
take into account the parameters’stochastic processes when forming their expectations about the
future. Our econometric approach, on the other hand, does not incorporate a law of motion for the
parameters when solving the agents’rational expectation problem. However, if the parameters of
the model are driven by either a time varying deterministic or slowly moving stochastic process,
as the popular random walk assumption in the literature, then our econometric approach does
not violate the rational expectation assumption in a linearised model because future changes in the
parameters are unpredictable by both agents and the econometrician. This implies that current pa-
rameter values are the best prediction for future values anyway. Another disadvantage of modelling
parameters’variation by explicitly specifying a stochastic process is that it is subject to the curse
of dimensionality. The state vector needs to be augmented for each parameter allowed to vary and
an additional shock is introduced. Because of this dimensionality problem, all parameters cannot
be modelled simultaneously in this way. For instance, Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez
(2008) do not allow both Taylor rule and price rigidity parameters to vary simultaneously when
estimating their DSGE model. Our alternative econometric approach does not su¤er from such
dimensionality issues.
In addition, the modelling approach of Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008) imposes
an additional structure by relying on the assumption that the law of motion for the parameters’
time variation is correctly speci…ed. Our nonparametric approach performs well for many di¤erent
66

parameters’laws of motion. Chapter 2 demonstrated in a Monte Carlo exercise that if the law of
motion is misspeci…ed, inconsistent estimates of the parameters’time variation are obtained if they
are treated as unobserved state variables as in Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008). In
contrast, the results in Chapter 2 suggest that our nonparametric alternative is consistent for a wide
class of parameter processes. Schorfheide (2007) argues that by treating time varying parameters
as unobserved state variables as in Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008), identi…cation
issues which are attenuated by the use of priors, as argued earlier in this Section, may arise21. Our
approach has the advantage of being able to incorporate prior information about the time varying
parameters at each point in time to solve possible identi…cation issues.
3.3
The Quasi-Bayesian Local Likelihood Method for DSGE Models
In this Section, we show how to apply the QBLL approach described in Chapter 2 to a DSGE
model with linear state-space representation. Note, however, that the QBLL method could also be
applied to models that have a non-linear state space representation such as in Fernandez-Villaverde
and Rubio-Ramirez (2007).
The linearized rational expectation model with time varying parameters can be written in the
form:
A(t)Etxt+1 = B(t)xt + C(t)vt;
vt s N(0; Q(t))
where xt is a n  1 the vector of model’s variables, vt is a k  1 vector of structural shocks, t
is a vector of parameters, including parameters governing preferences and the shocks’stochastic
processes, A; B and C are matrices, which are functions of t; Q(t) is a diagonal covariance matrix,
and Et is the expectation operator conditional on information available at time t: Observe that we
have one such equation at each point in time t = 1; :::; T.
A numerical solution of the rational expectation model can be obtained by one of the available
methods (for instance, Blanchard and Kahn (1980) or Sims (2002)). The resulting state equation
is given by:
xt = F(t)xt 1 + G(t)vt
(34)
where the n  n matrix F and n  k matrix G can be computed numerically for a given parameter
21For instance, Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008) obtain values of their Taylor rule parameters for
which the Taylor principle is not satis…ed.
67

vector t. The system is augmented with a measurement equation:
yt = D(t) + Z(t)xt
(35)
where yt is an m  1 vector of observables, typically of a smaller dimension than xt (i.e. m < n)
and Z is a m  n matrix that links those observables to the latent variables in the model xt.
Equations (34) and (35) provide the state-space representation of the model, which is linear and
Gaussian at each successive set of parameters t for t = 1; :::; T. Therefore, the Kalman …lter can be
employed to recursively build the likelihood of the sample of observables fytgT
t=1. The appropriately
weighted likelihood of the sample is given by:
Lt(Y jt) =
T
Y
j=1
L(yjjyj 1; t)wtj for t = 1; ::; T
where wtj is an element of the T  T weighting matrix W = [wtj]T
t;j=1, computed using a kernel
function given in equation (4):
wjt = ~wjt=

t=1 ~wjt;
~wjt = K

with a bandwidth H; satisfying the conditions in Chapter 2.
In the …xed parameter case, the weights on each likelihood sum up to T. In our case, each row
of W is normalised to sum up to 2H + 1, such that:
T
X
j=1
wtj = 2H + 1
t = 1; :::; T:
This normalisation is employed in order to maintain the relative weights between the likelihood
and the prior22.
For the application presented in this Chapter, the Normal kernel function in (5) is used to
generate the weights. If the bandwidth H goes to in…nity, the likelihood would collapse to the
…xed parameter case, where each likelihood is weighted equally. If H is small, the weights are
concentrated around a single observation. Our choice of bandwidth is H = T 0:5, motivated by the
22This chapter contains earlier work in which we had an intuition that the sum of the weights needs to diverge
with the sample size to obtain consistency; we had not, however, obtained the result in Proposition 1 yet, which gives
us the normalising rate. Hence, here and in the following two chapters, we normalise the weights to sum to 2H + 1;
which results in a consistent estimator with variance larger than the asymptotic variance of the estimator in chapter
2, where the weights sum up to {jT :
68

optimal bandwidth choice used for inference in time varying random coe¢ cient models (see Giraitis
et al. (2014)).
The local likelihood of the DSGE model at point t, denoted Lt(Y jt), is augmented with the
prior distributions for the parameters, pt(t), to get the quasi-posterior at time t, pt(tjY ):
pt(tjY ) = Lt(Y jt)pt(t)
p(Y )
/
T
Y
j=1
L(yjjyj 1; t)wtjpt(t):
It should be noted that, for our DSGE applications, we assume the prior pt(t) to be …xed over
time, i.e., pt(t) = p(t) for all t. One could potentially allow the prior to be time varying, exploring
the idea that the posterior yesterday can be used for a prior today. However, since we would like
to explore only the possibility of parameter drift, we choose to be agnostic about time variation in
the parameters before the estimation and keep the prior values …xed over time.
3.3.1
Characterising the Posterior Distributions
To obtain the joint posterior distribution of the parameters, we need numerical methods because
the matrices F and G are non-linear functions of ; and hence the posterior does not fall in known
families of distributions with moments that could be derived analytically. The most commonly used
procedure to generate draws from the posterior distribution of  is the Metropolis-Hastings (MH)
algorithm, proposed by Metropolis et al. (1953) and generalised by Hastings (1970). Although
the quasi-posterior distribution could be obtained by other methods, such as the Importance Sam-
pling (IS) algorithm, the MH algorithm delivers good convergence under fairly general regularity
condition (see Geweke (1999, 2005)) and asymptotically normal posterior distribution (see Walker
(1969), Crowder (1988) and Kim (1998)).
The algorithm described here is version of Schorfheide (2000)’s Random Walk Metropolis
(RWM) algorithm, modi…ed to include the kernel weighting scheme. Our aim is to obtain a se-
quence of posterior distributions pt(tjY ) for each point in time t = 1; ::; T: At each t the algorithm
implements the following steps.
Step 1. The posterior is log-linearised and passed to a numerical optimisation routine. Opti-
misation with respect to  is performed to obtain the posterior mode:

3.3.2
Computing Forecasts
Once the time varying quasi-posterior distribution of the parameters is obtained using the
algorithm in Section 3.3.1, we can compute out-of-sample forecasts for the observables y. For this
task, we only need the corresponding quasi-posterior distribution at the end of each in-sample,
p(t=T jY ), which contains the most recent values of the model’s parameters and hence the most
relevant information for predicting the future. Therefore, for generating DSGE-based predictions,
our method is as computationally intensive as forecasting with standard …xed parameter DSGE
models: it requires the computation of the posterior only once.
The predictive distribution of the sample p(yT+hjy1:T ), h horizons ahead, is given by the con-
ditional probability of the forecasts, averaged over all possible values of the parameters, the unob-
servables at the end of the sample xT , and all possible future paths of the unobservables xT+1:T+h:
p(yT+hjy1:T ) =

acceptance rate is 23.4%.

where p(T jy1:T ) is the posterior of the parameters at the end point of the in-sample period, T.
We employ a slightly modi…ed version of the algorithm for generating draws from the predictive
distribution outlined in Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b). The algorithm is as follows.
Step 1. Using the saved draws from the posterior at the end of the sample p(T jy1:T ); for
every draw k = 1; ::; nsim (or for every n-th draw if thinning is required), apply the Kalman …lter
to compute the moments of the unobserved variables at T using the density p(xT jk
T ; y1:T ):
Step 2. Draw a sequence of shocks vk
T+1:T+h from a N(0; Q(k
T )), where Q(k
T ) is a draw from
the quasi-posterior distribution of the diagonal variance-covariance matrix of the shocks at T. For
each draw k from p(T jy1:T ) and from p(xT jk
T ; y1:T ), use the state equation to obtain forecasts for
the unobserved variables:
bxk
T+1:T+h = F(k
T )xk
T:T+h 1 + G(k
T )vk
T+1:T+h:
Step 3. Use the forecast simulations for the latent variables in the measurement equation:
byk
T+1:T+h = D(k
T ) + Z(k
T )bxk
T+1:T+h:
Using the above algorithm, we obtain a predictive density of nsim draws of byk
T+1:T+h which can
be used to derive numerical approximations of moments, quantiles and densities of the out-of-
sample forecasts.Finally, point forecasts are obtained by computing the mean of the distribution of
byk
T+1:T+h for each forecasting horizon.
3.3.3
Nonparametric Heteroscedasticity in a DSGE Model
In the previous subsection, we show how to apply the QBLL estimation procedure to a linearised
DSGE model in order to estimate all the model’s parameters varying over time. The idea of the
algorithms outlined in Chapter 2 is general and can be applied in non-linear and non-conjugate
setups such as DSGE models. Here we outline a Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm that can be
used to consider time variation in the variances of the DSGE exogenous shocks while keeping the
structural parameters that characterise the preferences of the agents in the model …xed. We use
the structure of the algorithm presented in Justiniano and Primiceri (2008), modi…ed to include the
quasi-Bayesian local likelihood estimator of the estimation of the time varying covariance matrix.
The linearized rational expectation model with heteroscedastic disturbances can be written in
71

the form:
A()Etxt+1 = B()xt + C()t;
t s N(0; t)
where xt is a n  1 the vector of model’s variables, vt is a k  1 vector of structural shocks, 
is a vector of parameters, A; B and C are matrices, functions of ; t is a diagonal time-varying
covariance matrix, and Et is the expectation operator conditional on information available at time
t:
A numerical solution of the rational expectation model can be obtained with a resulting state
equation is given by:
xt = F()xt 1 + G()1=2
t
#t;
#t s N(0; In)
(36)
where the n  n matrix F and n  k matrix G can be computed numerically for a given . Note
that because the DSGE model is linearised, the solution in (36) does not depend on the history of
1:T .The system is augmented with a measurement equation:
yt = D() + Z()xt
(37)
where yt is an m  1 vector of observables, typically of a smaller dimension than xt (i.e. m < n)
and Z is a m  n matrix that links those observables to the latent variables in the model xt.
Conditional on the history of 1:T ; equations 36 and 37 are a linear Gaussian state-space
system; so standard Kalman …lter techniques can be employed to recursively build the likelihood of
the sample of observables fytgT
t=1. The likelihood of the sample, combined with a prior distribution
for the parameter vector , is given by:
p(jY ) /
T
Y
t=1
L(ytjyt 1; )p():
To draw from the posterior, a Metropolis step will be employed. Conditional on the hiatory 1:T
and on the Metropolis draw from the posterior of ; a draw from the structural shocks vt can be
obtained using Carter and Kohn (1994) or Durbin and Koopman (2002)’s disturbance smoothers.

3.4
Model and Data
The DSGE model to which we apply our quasi-Bayesian Local Likelihood approach is the model
from Smets and Wouters (2007), which is an extension of a small-scale monetary RBC model with
sticky prices (such as Goodfriend and King (1997), Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), Woodford
(2003), Ireland (2004) and Christiano et al. (2005)). In addition to the sticky prices, the model
also contains some additional shocks and frictions, including sticky nominal price and wage settings
with backward in‡ation indexation, investment adjustment costs, …xed costs in production, habit
formation in consumption and capital utilization. It also features seven exogenous shocks that
drive the stochastic dynamics of the model. The foundations of the model are derived from the
intertemporal optimisation problems of di¤erent agents. In particular, there are seven types of
agents in the model: consumers that supply labour, choose consumption level, hold bonds and make
investment decisions; intermediate goods producers which are in a monopolistically competitive
market and cannot adjust prices at each period and …nal goods producers, who buy intermediate
goods, package them and resell them to consumers in a perfectly competitive market. In addition,
there is a labour market with a similar structure: there are labour unions with market power that
buy the homogenous labour from households, di¤erentiate it, set wages and sell it to the labour
packers, who package it and resell it to intermediate goods producers in a perfectly competitive
environment. Finally, there is a central bank that follows a nominal interest rate rule, adjusting
the policy instrument in response to deviations of in‡ation or output from their target levels and
a government that collects lump-sum taxes which appear in the consumer’s budget constraint and
whose spending is exogenously driven.
The model is log-linearised around its steady state and trended variables are detrended with a
deterministic trend26. The model is estimated using seven macroeconomic quarterly time series for
the United States for the period of 1964Q3 to 2012Q4 as observables. The variables are the ones
used in Smets and Wouters (2007), namely, output, consumption, investment and wages per capita
growth; in‡ation, hours and the interest rate (see Appendix 7.2 for more details).
In this Section we present results for the …xed parameter model and also for the version with
time varying parameters estimated with QBLL method described in the previous Section. In both
cases, we employ the priors from Smets and Wouters (2007), with a number of MH draws of 220; 000,

from which we drop the …rst 20; 000. We set the scaling parameters such that acceptance rates are
around 25%. We apply the QBLL method using the Normal kernel function in equation (5) with
a bandwidth size of T 0:5:

Results
In this Section, we discuss the parameter estimates (Figures 11-13). We employ Figures 11-13 to
judge informally whether a parameter’s variation is substantial by checking whether the QBLL
estimates are outside the con…dence bands of the …xed-parameter estimates. We adopt Fernandez-
Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008)’s de…nition of ‘structural’parameters: these are preference
and technology parameters which are invariant to both policy and shocks. If a parameter is found to
be within the …xed-parameter 68% bands, we conclude that it is in fact ‘structural’. If a parameter
varies smoothly over time, following a clear pattern, we infer that it has been a subject to structural
change. On the other hand, if a parameter exhibits an erratic time variation, we would point to
a possible misspeci…cation of that parameter. The solid blue line are the time varying estimates
obtained with the QBLL method and 68% con…dence bands are represented by the dotted blue
lines. The green line represents the full sample …xed-parameter estimates, with the dotted lines
around it - 68% con…dence bands.
Figure 11: The DSGE parameters over time
The top panel of Figure 11 assesses results for the policy preference parameters. Our results
75

are broadly consistent with previous studies (Clarida et al. (2000), Cogley and Sargent (2002),
Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008)) that found evidence of structural changes in Tay-
lor rule parameters. The Federal Reserve has shifted its policy priority from output towards in‡ation
since the parameter that measures the reaction to in‡ation increases between 1979 and 1996, while
the reaction to the output gap decreases over this period. The interest rate smoothing parameter
is lower in the 1980s than in later periods, while the steady state in‡ation rate decreases between
1985 and 1996.
The second panel of Figure 11 provides evidence of changes in the steady-state growth rate of
per capita output (as well as consumption, investment and the real wage, which share the same
trend). During most of the period and up to 2005, the QBLL posterior mean for this parameter
is around 0.4, that is, an annual growth rate of 1.6%, however, this decreases to 1% annually in
period of the 2007-8 …nancial crisis. In contrast, …xed-parameter estimates under-estimate these
values over most of the sample, but over-estimate it during the recent period. This parameter is
important for generating forecasts as it appears in several of the measurement equations and Kolasa
and Rubaszek (2015) bring attention to the importance of this parameter in reducing forecasting
bias.
Figure 12: The DSGE parameters over time
The …ndings on the price rigidity parameters are consistent with the evidence presented in
Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008). In particular, we document a negative relation
76

between the price indexation (last panel in Figure 11) and price stickiness (second panel in Figure
11) parameters after the mid-1970s; hence, periods characterised by high Calvo probability para-
meter are also of low indexation and vice versa. The fall in in‡ation indexation during the Great
Moderation is consistent with …ndings of Gali and Gertler (1999) and could be explained by the
decreased need to adjust prices frequently due to low and stable in‡ation leading to longer length
of contracts27 and hence higher Calvo probability parameter and lower indexation. The variation
uncovered in the price rigidity parameters suggests that there is no stable predictive relation be-
tween in‡ation and output gap over time (i.e. the Phillips curve has become ‡atter in the low
volatility period of the Great Moderation) which cast doubt on the ability of Calvo pricing models
to adequately capture pricing behavior of …rms and unions in the economy.
There are parameters that appear to move very little over the entire sample period or seem
to remain within the con…dence bands of the …xed parameter estimates throughout most of the
sample, such as the elasticity of intertemporal substitution and the household discount factor (last
panel of Figure 11), and the elasticity of labour supply or the …xed production costs (…rst panel
of Figure 2). We draw comfort on those results, as they could be interpreted as evidence of the
structural nature of these parameters.
On the other hand, the moving average (MA) coe¢ cient, the persistence coe¢ cient (last panel
of Figure 12) and the standard deviation (last panel in Figure 13) of the wage mark-up shock
process, as well as the Calvo parameter in labour markets (top panel in Figure 12) all appear very
volatile and this could be evidence that they are seriously misspeci…ed and should not be kept
…xed. Interestingly enough, all four are parameters that govern labour market dynamics through
the wage equation and all become very unstable during the Great Moderation period. This could
be interpreted as evidence that during the Great Moderation, a Calvo model with an ARMA wage
shock may not have been an adequate model to characterise the dynamics of the labour market in
the US. An alternative interpretation is that there might be insu¢ cient information in the data in
order to jointly identify all four parameters during the Great Moderation.
The standard deviations of the structural shocks (panel 2 and 3 of Figure 13) also move in the
expected direction, consistent with …ndings of low stochastic volatility during the Great Moderation
(e.g.
Primiceri (2005) and Sims and Zha (2006)).
In particular, all shocks’ volatilities fall in
the late 1980s and remain low throughout the 1990s. Moreover, their posterior distributions are
narrower during that period implying that there is less uncertainty about the possible values they

77

Figure 13: The DSGE parameters over time
can take. The standard deviation of the monetary policy shock, for instance, peaks in the 1980s,
implying a larger role of the shock throughout that period and falls considerably after the 1990s,
having lesser impact on the business cycle as a consequence of the more adequate policy. For some
shocks’standard deviations (e.g. TFP, investment-speci…c technology and price-mark up shocks)
we observe an increase in the end of the sample leading to the recent …nancial crisis.
Due to
the considerable time variation we uncover in the volatilities of the shocks, using the most recent
values of the estimated volatility parameters when generating forecasts is expected to improve
the density of the forecasts compared to simply using the …xed parameter estimates that average
these over the entire in-sample period. Finally, the autoregressive coe¢ cients for the stochastic
processes (panels 1 and 2 of Figure 13) seem to move considerably, which is unsurprising as these
are designed to capture dynamics in the data. They are not truly structural, in the sense that
there is no underlying macroeconomic theory that implies that they are not subjected to shocks or
policy. Most of the shocks’persistence coe¢ cients display a U-shape with low persistence towards
the end of the Oil Crises and higher persistence during the Great Moderation. For instance, the
TFP shock becomes very persistent during the recent crisis with AR coe¢ cient very close to one,
implying almost permanent shock to productivity.
78

3.6
Time Varying Impulse Response Functions
In this Section, we turn to the estimated impulse response functions over time. We investigate
whether there is evidence for structural change in the transmission mechanism of important vari-
ables to macroeconomic shocks, resulting from the documented time variation in the paramerers.
Figure 14 displays the impulse response functions of output, in‡ation and the interest rate to
a monetary policy shock. Since the response is to a unit of the shock, it measures only changes in
the transmission of the monetary policy shock over time without taking into account changes in
the volatility of the shock, as documented in the previous subsection.
First, the response of the Fed rate to the monetary policy shock is roughly the same throughout
the sample period and it is around half a percentage point. The response of output, in contrast,
shows a clear trend over time, with responses increasing from around 2.5% to 4% on impact. The
response of in‡ation, on the other hand, displays a U-shape, with in‡ation being quite responsive
to policy in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and in the more recent period. This results are at odds
with the …ndings in Boivin and Giannoni (2006), who …nd a considerable decrease in the responses
of output, in‡ation and the interest rate to a policy shock in their post-1980 sub-sample, using
minimum distance estimator between a structural VAR and a small DSGE model. They attribute
this result mainly to the higher estimate of the in‡ation targeting parameter in their policy rule
over the second period.
Figure 15 presents responses to a one standard deviation of the shock and these incorporate the
decrease in the volatility of monetary policy shock over the second half of the sample. Instead of
increasing responsiveness of output, we now observe somewhat constant response over time with
an increase in the end of the sample due to the aggressive policy during the crisis. Interestingly,
once one allows for changing size of the shock over time, in‡ation’s response to policy is actually
decreasing over time. Furthermore, one standard deviation policy shock results into considerably
higher response of the interest rate during Volcker’s years than in any other period.
Figures 16 and 17 display the responses to a price mark-up shock. The picture that emerges is
that both output and investment become much more responsive to an in‡ation shock during the
Great Moderation period, implying that the same shock to in‡ation has a relatively more harmful
e¤ect on these variables in that period than during the Oil Crises, when in‡ation was record high.
It is also evident from the policy rate response that policy makers retaliated more to a unit of
in‡ation shock after Paul Volcker’s appointment as a Federal Reserve chairman.

81

Figure 18: IRFs to 1 unit TFP shock
Figure 18 and 19 are the IRFs of selected variables to a unit and a standard deviation of the
TFP shock. The most intriguing result that emerges is that the response of all output, consumption
and investment, whether one allows for the size of the shock to vary over time or not, is considerably
larger in periods characterised by recessions such as the Oil Crisis in early 1970s and the recent
crisis, implying an asymmetrically larger e¤ects of TFP shocks in recessions than in booms. The
decreasing responsiveness of the interest rate over time could be explained by the Federal Reserve
responding less aggressively to output and more aggressively to in‡ation which is less a¤ected
by productivity shocks. The response of hours worked to productivity shock and the resulting
implications for the relevance and relative importance of this shock for the business cycle is a much
debated topic (Gali (1999)). Once we allow for time variation in the TFP responses, the response of
hours remains negative in all periods for all horizons except several periods in the early 1990s when
the response changes sign and becomes positive after less than 10 quarters. This could be attributed
to the increased persistence of the shock that we uncover during this period. Furthermore, as argued
in Smets and Wouters (2007), the habit coe¢ cient is important for explaining the negative e¤ect
of TFP on hours and as shown in Figure 11, we obtain low habit persistence in the 1990s which
contributes to the weakened duration of the negative e¤ect.Figures 20 and 21 display the responses
to a preference shock. It appears that, after allowing for the changing size of the shock over time,
82

Figure 19: IRFs to 1 st. dev. TFP shock
output, consumption and investment are more responsive to the shock, both on impact and in
duration, in periods characterised by recessions, suggesting asymmetric responses to the preference
shock in the model.
Finally, Figures 22 and 23 display the responses to a unit and a standard deviation of wage
mark up shock respectively. The parameters characterising the labour market during the Great
Moderation period, which we discussed in the previous Section, are the reason for the misbehaved
impulse response functions during the same period. It is clear that the responses are not smooth
over time and the resulting response per unit of the shock of output, in‡ation and hours becomes
essentially zero for all horizons after the beginning of the 1990s. Once we allow for the changing
size of the shock, the picture becomes even more distorted, since the standard deviation of the wage
mark up shock is itself one of the parameters that are misspeci…ed during the Great Moderation
period28.
28The IRFs of selected variables to the remaining shocks (namely, Investment Technology and Government Spending
Shocks) can be found in the Appendix 7.2, see Figures 47-50.

Forecasting with a time varying DSGE Model
As we discussed in the introduction, the literature has documented evidence of the forecasting
accuracy of …xed-parameter DSGE models (Smets and Wouters (2007), Edge et al. (2009), Edge
and Guerkaynak (2010), Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b), Del Negro, Giannoni and Schorfheide
(2014)).
In this Section we evaluate the relative forecasting performance of our time varying
DSGE model. In addition to the …xed-parameter Smets and Wouters (2007) speci…cation, we also
compare the forecasting record of the time varying DSGE model against univariate models (AR(1),
a Random Walk (RW) and a time varying AR(1)) and multivariate reduced-form models (a BVAR
and a time varying stochastic volatility BVAR (TV-SV BVAR)).
The BVAR uses a standard Normal-inverted-Wishart conjugate prior with optimal shrinkage
and optimal lag selection as in Carriero, Clark and Marcellino (2015a). The TV-SV BVAR features
time varing autoregressive coe¢ cients as in Cogley and Sargent (2002) and stochastic volatility as
in Primiceri (2005)29. Since it is burdensome to estimate this model for more than three variables
and obtain stationary draws from the posterior distribution of the autoregressive coe¢ cients, we
limit our TV-SV BVAR to only output growth, in‡ation and the Fed Funds rate. The TV-AR
29The TV-SV BVAR is of lag order one and uses random walk processes for both the autoregressive coe¢ cients
and the log volatility. For more details, see for instance Benati and Mumtaz (2007).

model is computed using the non-parametric kernel based method, as in Giraitis et al. (2014)30.
We employ the algorithm outlined in Section 3.3.2 to generate density forecasts for the observ-
ables of the time varying DSGE model.
Since real-time data is limited and only available after 199131, we perform the out-of-sample
forecasting on …nal revised data as we would like to be able to assess performance across di¤erent
periods. Our forecast origins range from 1974Q3 up to 2010Q1 and we compute forecasts for one
up to twelve quarters ahead.
We measure accuracy of point forecasts using the root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE)
and forecast bias. The accuracy of density forecasts are measured by log predictive scores. We
compute the logscore with the help of a nonparametric estimator to smooth the draws from the
predictive density obtained for each forecast and horizon. We test whether a model is statistically
more accurate than the benchmark with the Diebold and Mariano (1995) statistic computed with
Newey-West estimator to obtain standard errors. We provide the results of the Diebold-Mariano
test for the RMSFEs and logscores.
For the bias, we simply test whether the models’ bias is

Table 12 presents the absolute performance of the our TV DSGE model (in RMSFEs) and the
relative performance of our approach to alternative models over di¤erent horizons (numbers smaller
than one imply superior performance of the TV DSGE relative to the alternatives). One, two and
three stars indicate that we reject the null of equal accuracy in favour of the better performing
model at signi…cance levels of 10%, 5% and 1% respectively.

ratios of RMSFEs of TV-DSGE over the alternatives. ’*’, ’**’ and ’***’ indicate rejection of the null of equal performance
against the two-sided alternative at 10%, 5% and 1% signi…cance level respectively, using a Diebold - Mariano test.
There are some gains from using the time varying model over the standard …xed parameter
DSGE for most variables but the di¤erences are small and rarely signi…cant. One exception is in-
‡ation: the time varying model performs signi…cantly worse than the …xed-parameter speci…cation.
87

The model also outperforms the standard BVAR, which con…rms previous …ndings (e.g. Smets and
Wouters (2007), Adolfson, Andersson, Linde, Villani and Vredin (2007), Christo¤el, Coenen and
Warne (2010)). Moreover, we …nd superior performance for output growth over the TV-SV BVAR.
Finally, the TV DSGE model strongly outperforms the univariate models.
In order to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of our approach, we further in-
vestigate the point forecast accuracy by splitting our sample of forecasts into subsamples corre-
sponding roughly to three distinct periods in U.S. recent economic history: namely, the Oil Crisis
or Great In‡ation period (at least the end of it, ranging 1974Q2:1982Q4), the Great Moderation
(1983Q1:2005Q4) and the recent …nancial crisis (2006Q1:2011Q3). Table 13 presents the relative
RMSFE performance of our approach and Table 14 displays the forecast bias for per capita GDP
growth, in‡ation and the interest rate during the three periods. For the Oil Crisis period, our
method is superior to the two BVARs and comparative to the standard DSGE approach for out-
put. When it comes to forecast bias in the Great In‡ation Period, both DSGE models strongly
and signi…cantly underestimate in‡ation, but in relative terms our model does poorly, resulting in
signi…cantly worse RMSFE performance. The reason for this result is the relatively small sample
size at this point and hence, little advantage in down-weighting past data. Interestingly, the two
BVARs deliver unbiased in‡ation forecasts, but systematically underestimate output growth.

Although, as argued earlier, our method does on average worse for in‡ation over the full fore-
cast sample, during the Great Moderation, we obtain better performance. The Great Moderation
was characterised by low and stable in‡ation and very low business cycle volatility. It is clear
from the forecast bias, that both BVAR models and the standard DSGE model signi…cantly over-
estimate in‡ation during this period. This is the case, since the standard DSGE and the …xed
coe¢ cient BVAR models, in order to generate projections, use samples which contain the entire
Oil Crisis period, characterised by very high in‡ation. Our method, on the other hand, obtains
better performance and remains virtually unbiased because of its way of down-weighting distant
data. The TV-SV BVAR features time variation in the autoregressive coe¢ cients of the VAR,
so it is surprising that is fails to capture the structural change in in‡ation dynamics during the
Great Moderation and also systematically overestimates in‡ation. This could be due to the way
time variation enters the model; our approach models time variation non-parametrically, and it is
more robust to misspeci…cations in the stochastic processes for the time varying parameters that
the TV-SV BVAR utilises (for further discussion and Monte Carlo evidence, see Section 2.9 and
Appendix 7.1.11). All models deliver similar, in terms of RMSFEs, output forecasts during the
Great Moderation; however, both DSGE models underestimate output.

Table 14: Forecast Bias. The table reports forecast bias, computed as the mean forecast error. ’*’, ’**’and ’***’indicate rejec-

- Mariano test.
The period of the recent …nancial crisis (2007-2009) has been a subject to many discussions.
89

This crisis generated serious critiques for the forecasting literature, for instance, Wieland and
Wolters (2011), Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b) provide evidence that DSGE models not only
failed to predict it, but even once the crisis had started, failed to forecast the trough and quickly
returned the economy to positive growth rates. During the 2006-2011 period, which overlaps with
the recent crisis period and subsequent recovery, our model outperforms the standard DSGE model
and both BVARs for all horizons and even with a small sample size of 23 observations, manages
to deliver some statistically signi…cant improvements. This could also be seen from the forecast
bias where all alternative models considerably overestimate output, but our approach impressively
delivers unbiased output forecasts at one step ahead, compared to a bias of around 0.31% quarterly
GDP growth for the …xed parameter DSGE model, 0.33% for the BVAR and 0.40% for the TV-
SV BVAR. Our interpretation of this result is similar to before; both the BVAR model and the
standard DSGE model use as in-sample period data from Oil Crisis and the Great Moderation in
order to generate forecasts for the recent crisis, while our method also makes use of these data
but discounts it and gives more weight to recent observations. The resulting trend coe¢ cient, ;
as seen in Section 3.5, falls considerably after 2007. This parameter is important and can have
substantial e¤ect on the model’s forecasts, as it enters as an intercept in the measurement equation
for output, consumption, investment and wage growth. For in‡ation, while RMSFE performance
during the same period is relatively similar to the standard DSGE model (worse in the short
run and better at longer horizons), the forecast bias is negative for the TV DSGE model while
positive for the standard DSGE. Another interesting result is that, our method, while delivering
similar interest rates forecasts during the previous subsamples, delivers very large and statistically
signi…cant improvements over all models during the crisis. Our TV DSGE model contains a Taylor
rule with changing parameters and in particular, during the crisis period with interest rates close
to the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB), our interest rate smoothing coe¢ cient jumps to levels near 0.9.
This delivers interest rate forecasts that are close to a random walk model while in‡ation targeting
and output gap values have a reduced e¤ect.
To summarise, in periods, in which serious structural change is present, such as the recent one,
the forecast errors of the TV DSGE model are relatively smaller and the model is more robust to
forecast bias resulting from the presence of the structural change in the in-sample period.

3.7.2
Density Forecasts
Table 15 accesses the quality of the density forecasts measured by logscores of the predictive
density. The table displays absolute log predictive score for the TV DSGE model and di¤erences
in logscores over the alternative models, so numbers greater than zero imply superior performance
of our approach.
A few comments are in order. First, it is clear that overall our method outperforms considerably
and statistically signi…cantly the standard DSGE for most variables and horizons. Interestingly,
our simple univariate TV AR(1) also delivers density performance superior to that of the standard
DSGE model. These results are important as they imply that, while allowing for parameter drift
results in moderate gains for point accuracy and only for some variables and periods, it results in
signi…cantly improved density forecasts. One way to look at this is to infer about the importance
of stochastic volatility. As seen in Section 3.5, the uncovered time variation in the standard devia-
tions of the shocks in the structural model is substantial and previous studies have con…rmed this
result (Primiceri (2005), Sims and Zha (2006), Justiniano and Primiceri (2008)). Since volatility is
inherently time varying and subjected to structural change, it is clear that conditioning on the most
recent values of the volatility of the shocks when simulating the density of forecasts, as outlined
in Section 3.3.2, will deliver better forecast uncertainty. Since the TV-SV BVAR also allows for
changing volatility, it is unsurprising that it delivers very similar density forecast performance.

Table 16 further investigates the relative density performance of our approach over the sub-
sample periods. It is clear that our method delivers better forecast uncertainty than the standard
DSGE and the standard BVAR over the Great Moderation period, which is unsurprising. The
in-sample that the two …xed coe¢ cient models contain is the high volatility period of the Oil
Crises, hence, as anticipated, density forecasts during the Great Moderation generated with these
in-samples are worse.
On the other hand, our TV DSGE model as well as the TV-SV BVAR
account for this reduced uncertainty (our approach - by kernel down-weighting of Oil Crises data
and the TV-SV BVAR - by …tting random walk state equations for the volatility paths) and hence
deliver similar and superior performance over the …xed parameter models.

Robustness Checks
In this Section, we investigate the impact of some of our assumptions on the forecasting perfor-
mance of the time varying DSGE model. We exploit the impact of di¤erent bandwidth sizes and
the use of the rolling windows method. Figure 25 plots the RMSFEs32 for the …xed-parameter
DSGE model and the time varying DSGE estimated under di¤erent assumptions. We include our
baseline case with the normal kernel method and bandwidth equals to T 0:5, and also the case the
bandwidth of T 0:55. We also consider ‡at kernels which are equivalent to rolling windows of 40 and
60 observations. The results in Figure 25 support our baseline estimation method since they imply
a forecasting performance that is superior to alternative speci…cations.
Robustness Check. Comparison of RMSFEs obtained with bandwidths H = T 0:5; T 0:55 and rolling windows
of size 40 and 60.
32For computational time considerations, the robustness checks have only been computed at the mode of the
parameter posterior. Furthermore, the sample size of the forecasts is smaller than in the comparison in the previous
Section due to use of larger in-sample periods by the wider rolling windows.

Summary
This Chapter develops a quasi-Bayesian local likelihood method to accommodate time variation
in DSGE models’parameters, appropriately weighting the sum of log likelihoods of the sample with
weights generated by a kernel function. The method can be applied to any DSGE model that has
a state-space representation. The empirical application presented uncovers some time variation in
the Smets and Wouters (2007) model’s parameters and points to potential misspeci…cation in the
labour market of the model during to the low volatility environment of the Great Moderation period.
When it comes to forecasting, our estimation procedure is no more computationally intensive than
estimating a DSGE model with …xed parameters and, as demonstrated in the forecasting exercise,
can deliver some gains in the forecast performance both for point and density projections especially
in the presence of serious structural change such as the recent …nancial crisis.

Time Varying DSGE model with Financial Frictions
4.1
Introduction
The previous Chapter discussed the success of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) for
policy analysis and macroeconomic forecasting. In particular, following Smets and Wouters (2007),
many authors evaluated the DSGE models’s forecasting performance, providing evidence that they
can produce accurate forecasts of output growth and in‡ation in real time (Edge and Guerkaynak
(2010), Woulters (2012) and Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b)). However, the recent …nancial
crisis has posed a serious challenge to macroeconomic modelling and forecasting. Perhaps the most
important aspect of this challenge is the inability of standard DSGE models to accommodate the
impact of developments in the …nancial sector on the rest of the economy. Based on the seminal
work of Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1999), various authors have exploited …nancial channels in
a DSGE structure as a way of improving the …t of the DSGE model to the 2008-2009 global …nancial
crisis, including Christiano, Motto and Rostagno (2014), Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b) and
Del Negro, Hasegawa and Schorfheide (2014). Interestingly, Del Negro, Hasegawa and Schorfheide
(2014) …nd that the Smets and Wouters (2007) model with …nancial frictions, while delivering
relatively better forecasts during the crisis, performs worse in tranquil periods than the model
without …nancial frictions. This is consistent with evidence of the changing predictive power of
various economic and …nancial indicators on U.S. output and in‡ation (Stock and Watson (2003)).
Even if asset prices are, on average, poor indicators of economic activity, their predictive power
should have increased during the recent …nancial crisis.
For example, Gilchrist and Zakrajsek
(2011) and Philippon (2009) argue that the predictive power of corporate bond credit spread for
the business cycle and economic activity reveal the potential of bond markets to signal (even more
accurately than stock markets) the decline in fundamentals prior to the 2007-2008 business cycle
downturn.
Incorporating a …nancial channel in a DSGE model may not be enough to address the e¤ect
that structural changes in the underlying economy might have on preference parameters and on
exogenous shock processes. As argued in Chapter 3, a standard assumption in the literature has
been that the DSGE parameters are structural in the Lucas sense, that is, they are invariant to
both policy and structural shocks. However, long term cultural or technological shifts might result
in slow parameter variation. While DSGE analysis focuses primarily on business cycle frequency,
parameter drift is potentially of great importance when considering sample periods of over 40 years,
95

which are routinely used for estimation and calibration of DSGE models. A related issue is the
extent to which all parameters of medium-sized DSGE models are equally immune to the Lucas
critique.
While parameters such as households’ discount factor with distinct microfoundations
may be una¤ected to long run change, other parameters associated with rigidity dynamics have
a reduced-form ‡avour and may be more vulnerable to technological or social change, or other
factors. Even if one believes in the structural nature of DSGE parameters, it is important that
one recognises at least the possibility of time variation in the parameters when estimated over long
time periods.
In this Chapter, we employ the approach developed in Chapter 3 to investigate the changing
nature of the e¤ect of …nancial frictions to the rest of the economy. The model we investigate is a
Smets and Wouters (2007) model with an added …nancial sector as in Bernanke et al. (1999) and
Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b). The advantage of the speci…cation discussed in this Chapter is
that the importance of the …nancial frictions for macroeconomic variables depends on a preference
parameter and on the stochastic properties of the new …nancial friction shock. By looking at the
possibility of time variation in these parameters, while also allowing all other DSGE parameters to
change over time, we can measure whether the signi…cance of …nancial frictions change over time.
We …nd that the parameter that triggers the transmission of …nancial frictions to the economy
remains relatively constant during the entire sample period we analyse. However, the volatility
of the …nancial friction shock rises dramatically during the 2007-2011 period. This new …nding
contributes to the debate between ‘Good Luck’versus ‘Good Policy’when explaining the Great
Moderation (Gali and Gambetti (2009), Benati and Surico (2009), Sims and Zha (2006)).
We
provide evidence that the …nancial frictions shock was muted during the 1985-2007 period. Note
that our model presents arguments in favour of changes in the volatility of the shocks while also
allowing for changes in the parameters of the policy rule. As a consequence, this Chapter produces
a new source of evidence of ‘Good Luck’during the Great Moderation period while also allowing
for a ‘Good Policy’channel. Related investigation of changes in the volatility of …nancial shocks
over time is presented in Fuentes-Albero (2014), where a Smets and Wouters (2007) DSGE model
with …nancial frictions is estimated with constant parameters over di¤erent subsamples and the
breaks in the volatility of the residuals of the model are dated. The author …nds that the size
of the …nancial shocks has increased over time, while their importance in explaining non-…nancial
variables has remained relatively unchanged.
Cardani, Paccagnini and Villa (2015) estimate a
Smets and Wouters (2007) model with banking intermediation and report the posterior means of
96

the parameters over time implied by their recursive forecasting scheme, providing further evidence
of the changing importance of the …nancial shock in their model.
This Chapter also exploits the forecasting performance of the time-varying DSGE model with
…nancial frictions, extending the results of Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b) and Kolasa and
Rubaszek (2015), who use only …xed parameters speci…cations.
The Chapter is organised as follows. Section 4.2 describes the DSGE model used in the em-
pirical applications in Section 4.3. Finally, Section 4.4 concludes and Appendix 7.3 contains data
description, priors, additional results and robustness checks.
4.2
The DSGE model with …nancial frictions
The DSGE model with …nancial frictions combines the Smets and Wouters (2007) model (SW),
which extends a small-scale monetary RBC model with sticky prices (such as Goodfriend and King
(1997), Rotemberg and Woodford (1997), Woodford (2003), Ireland (2004) and Christiano et al.
(2005)), with …nancial frictions as in Bernanke et al. (1999). In addition to the sticky prices, the
SW model also includes additional shocks and frictions, featuring sticky nominal price and wage
settings with backward in‡ation indexation, investment adjustment costs, …xed costs in production,
habit formation in consumption and capital utilization. Our complete log-linearised speci…cation of
the model is described in Appendix 7.3. It di¤ers from the …nancial friction speci…cation in Kolasa
and Rubaszek (2015) and Del Negro and Schorfheide (2013b) in that we are using a deterministic
rather than stochastic trend in productivity.
In comparison with the SW model, the main di¤erence of the model discussed in this Chapter is
the inclusion of a …nancial sector from where entrepreneurs borrow funds to …nance their projects.
To prevent entrepreneurs to accumulate enough for self-…nancing, the model assumes that a constant
proportion of them dies each period. The success of the entrepreneurs’projects depend on both
aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks.
While entrepreneurs observe the impact of both types of
shocks, the banks do not observe idiosyncratic shocks. The …nancial intermediary faces a standard
agency problem in writing the optimal contract to lend to the entrepreneurs. The bank charges a
…nance premium in order to cover its monitoring costs. The …rst order condition from the expected
return maximisation of the entrepreneurs, subject to the bank contract, gives rise to one of the
three key equations in the …nancial frictions block together with the evolution of the net worth of
entrepreneurs and the arbitrage equation for capital. The most important impact of the …nancial
friction is that it ‘accelatares’the impact of negative shocks, since the default risk increases during
97

recessions, which has a negative impact on net worth and investment, that further rises the default
risk as a consequence of the corporate bond spread.

where "b
t is the risk premium shock,  describes the habit formation on consumption,  is the
long-run growth rate, c is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. The transmission of the
…nancial shock to aggregate investment via Tobin’s qt depends crucially of the parameter &sp;b. If
this parameter collapses to zero (in the absence of the …nancial friction shock "!
t ), the model is
equivalent to one with no …nancial frictions. The …nancial friction shock follows an AR(1) process

shocks. We are particularly interested in how the parameters &sp;b, ! and ! evolve over time
since they have an impact on how the ‘accelerator’mechanism, created by allowing for …nancial
frictions, changes over time.
Our full set of measurement equations is described in Appendix 7.3. In addition to the seven
observables employed by Smets and Wouters (2007), we add a time series of the corporate bond
spread, Spreadt, measured as the di¤erence between the BAA Corporate Bond Yield over the 10
Year Treasury Note Yield. This time series is linked to the …nancial friction block above by equation
Spreadt = SP  + 100  Et[ ~Rk

where rt is the policy rate.

Empirical results
In this Section, we apply the quasi-Bayesian local likelihood (QBLL) method outlined in Chapter 3
to the DSGE model with …nancial frictions described in Section 4.2. We compare our results with
the model estimated assuming …xed parameters. The QBLL method is applied with the weights wtj
generated by the normal kernel function and a bandwidth

98

can be found in Appendix 7.3. These priors are the same as in Smets and Wouters (2007); for the
…nancial friction block parameters we tried di¤erent prior speci…cations (see Appendix 7.3). The
number of draws of the MH algorithm is 150; 000, from which we drop the …rst 15; 000. The scaling
parameter for the MH has been adjusted in order to obtain rejection rates of 20%-30%33. We use
U.S. data on eight observables described in Appendix 7.3 from 1970Q1 up to 2014Q2.
Figure 25: QBLL Estimates of DSGE model parameters with FF
Figures 26 and 27 present the estimates of selected parameters. The remaining parameters can be
found in Appendix 7.3, and they are qualitatively similar to the estimates in Chapter 3. In Figures
26 and 27, the blue solid line is the posterior mean obtained by QBLL, with the black dotted
lines displaying 5% and 95% posterior con…dence intervals, and the pink dash-dotted line is the
posterior mode obtained by QBLL. Finally, the dashed blue line is the posterior mean obtained by
standard Bayesian methods with …xed coe¢ cients, and the green dashed lines are the 5% and 95%
33Roberts et al. (1997) show that the optimal acceptance rate is 0.234 and their result serves as a rough benchmark in
the literature; however, it is asymptotic and rests on the assumption that the elements of each chain are independent.

posterior quantiles. We would judge informally whether a parameter’s variation is substantial by
checking whether our estimates are outside the 5% and 95% quantiles of the posterior distribution
of the …xed parameter model. We expect that the time-varying parameters, estimated by QBLL,
will move slowly over time, in agreement with their variation representing stable and gradually
changing relationships between the variables of the model, caused by smooth structural change.
Parameters that vary in a erratic way would suggest that there exists no stable relationship between
variables over time which might indicate model misspeci…cation of a di¤erent nature to that arising
out of smooth structural change.
Figure 26 displays the parameters of the Taylor rule, that is, interest rate smoothing and the
relative impacts of in‡ation, output gap, and output growth on the policy rate. Estimated values
are broadly in agreement with previous studies (Clarida et al. (2000), Cogley and Sargent (2002),
Fernandez-Villaverde and Rubio-Ramirez (2008)) and suggest that the Federal Reserve has shifted
the priority of its policy from output towards in‡ation in the mid-1980s. In particular, the Taylor
rule in‡ation parameter starts increasing considerably especially after 1983, Paul Volcker’s second
term as a Chairman of the Federal Reserve, while the output gap coe¢ cient falls during that
period. Interest rate smoothing seems to have been low in the 1980s with tackling in‡ation being a
priority and becomes higher through the second half of the sample. More interesting, we observe an
increase in the output gap coe¢ cient during the recent crisis, providing evidence that U.S. monetary
authorities shifted attention to the sharply declining output. Monetary policy shock becomes more
persistent during the crisis with interest rates near the Zero Lower Bound.
Figure 26 also includes the parameters of the …nancial friction block. Both the measurement
equation parameter, SP ; and the coe¢ cient that measures the impact of …nancial frictions on
Tobin’s q,&sp;b, have posterior means obtained with QBLL that are larger than assuming …xed
parameters, but their values are in general stable over time34.
The parameter measuring the
persistence of the …nancial friction shock obtained with QBLL is in line with the one obtained
with the …xed coe¢ cient model since the QBLL estimate has large posterior con…dence bands. In
contrast, the volatility of …nancial frictions shocks increases twofold in period between 2007 and
2011 in comparison with the previous period and also with the …xed parameter posterior estimates.
34In the presence of time variation, …xed parameter estimation is inconsistent and hence results can be very di¤erent
under both schemes especially in a non-linear setup. To address the question of why the con…dence intervals of SP 
and sp;b obtained by BLL do not overlap with the …xed parameter ones, we o¤er a di¤erent explanation. Since
the BLL approach uses a smaller sample (taking into account the down-weighting), it gives larger relative weight to
the prior. For most parameters, this makes little di¤erence, as the priors are not very tight. However, for SP  and
sp;b, the BLL approach delivers estimates much more narrowly concentrated around the prior means than the …xed
parameter model which uses a larger sample.
100

One might worry that this large increase may be caused by the inadequacy of the DSGE model to
…t the data during the …nancial crisis period.
Figure 26: QBLL Estimates of DSGE model parameters with FF
Figure 27 compares the time variation of the …nancial friction volatility with the volatilities of the
other seven shocks. The results are broadly consistent with …ndings of low volatility during the
Great Moderation (e.g. Primiceri (2005) and Sims and Zha (2006)). In particular, the volatilities
of all shocks (except the wage mark up shock) fall in the late 1980s and remain low throughout
the 1990s. The standard deviation of the monetary policy shock, for instance, is twice as large in
the 1980s than in the 1990s. The volatilities of productivity and spending shocks are also small
during the 1985-2005 period. These results suggest that the QBLL approach applied to the DSGE
with …nancial frictions is able to reproduce previously documented changes in the variance of the
shocks. Our new …nding, however, is the clear increase in the …nancial friction shock variance from
0.2 to 0.4 during the 2007-2011 period. Similar relative size increases are not found for the other
101

shocks since the total factor productivity shock only slightly exceeds the …xed parameter estimate
during the most recent period.
In summary, the application of the QBLL approach to the DSGE model with …nancial frictions
suggests that the volatility of the …nancial shock increased in the 2007-2011 but was small in the
previous period. This adds a ‘Good Luck’component to the interpretation of the Great Moderation
period (1985-2006) since previous papers (Gali and Gambetti (2009), Benati and Surico (2009), Sims
and Zha (2006)) looked at DSGE models that did not include a …nancial sector, and as consequence
had no …nancial shocks. Moreover, we …nd that the volatility of the …nancial friction shock starts
falling in 2012 and returns to pre-crisis levels in the end of 2014, suggesting a recovery of the
economy from the …nancial crisis. An alternative explanation for the uncovered variation in the
…nancial volatility is that the DSGE model we consider is too stylised and cannot capture fully
the linkages between the …nancial sector and the rest of the economy and consequently, the impact
of the events of the …nancial crisis appear in the variance of the …nancial friction shock in our
empirical investigation.

Robustness Checks
In this Section, we report a number of robustness checks we performed in order to test the va-
lidity of the results presented in the previous Section. First, we checked the robustness of our
…ndings by trying di¤erent prior speci…cations (see Appendix 7.3 for details) and by changing the
trend assumption on productivity from deterministic to stochastic35. In all these speci…cations, we
con…rmed the results presented in Figure 1 and 2.
In addition, in Figure 28, we provide a comparison of the QBLL estimates of selected para-
meters36 with ones generated with a simple rolling window scheme (solid green line)37. It is clear
from Figure 28 that while the general pattern of the parameters does not change, the estimates
obtained using the rolling window are considerably noisier. This is the case as at each point, a
new observation is added and another one is thrown away. On the other hand, the QBLL, due to
its capacity to reweight past observations without completely discarding any information, delivers
smoother time variation. Noisy time variation in the DSGE parameters is not desirable for at least
two reasons. First, if moving one observation forward causes large shifts in the values of some
35These additional results are available upon request.
36The remaining parameters can be found in Appendix 6.5.
37For computational considerations, we only present the posterior mode estimates. To make the results comparable
with the BLL results from the previous section, we use window size of [2H+1] observations; where H is the bandwidth
used for the normal kernel.

parameters, this might distort forecasting performance. Second, as argued in the previous Section,
we believe that the variation in the DSGE parameters should be gradual, because it implies stable
and gradually changing relationships between the variables of the model. The normal kernel has
been found in the Monte Carlo study of Giraitis et al. (2014) to provide estimators with lower MSE
compared to the ‡at kernel.
Furthermore, in order to assess the robustness of our results with respect to di¤erent spread
variables, we estimated the model using the di¤erence between the BAA corporate bond yield and
the Fed Funds rate (solid blue line). Figure 29 displays the posterior modes of selected parameter
estimates38. We discover that the results with this alternative spread speci…cation do not alter our
main conclusions.
Figure 27: Robustness Check
In addition, we also ran a small simulation exercise39 in order to check if the QBLL approach works
38The remaining parameters can be found in Appendix 6.6.
39Due to computational time considerations, we only ran 10 replications, each with a sample size of 1000.
103

even in the absence of parameter time variation. We generated data from a …xed parameter DSGE
model with …nancial frictions (dotted green line), using as a parameter vector the prior means40.
Then, we applied our QBLL approach (solid blue line) to these arti…cial data. Figure 30 displays
the resulting estimates from a representative replication for selected parameters41 and demonstrates
how the QBLL approach recovers the true parameters with virtually no time variation. This sug-
gests that the method is valid even in the absense of time variation and therefore the uncovered
variation in the model’s parameters in our empirical application is not spurious but is instead a
feature of the US data used for estimation.
Figure 28: Robustness Check
Finally, our choice of bandwidth in the empirical application in the previous Section is moti-
vated by the optimal bandwidth choice used for inference in time varying random coe¢ cient models
40We set the standard deviations to 0.1, as the prior mean for these is in…nite.
41The remaining parameters can be found in Appendix 6.7.

in Giraitis et al. (2014). In addition, in Chapter 2 and 3, we performed a number of robustness
checks with respect to di¤erent values of H. Moreover, in an application to the Smets and Wouters
(2007) model without …nancial frictions, Chapter 3 showed that H =
p
T delivers the best forecast
performance for most variables.

Time-varying impulse response functions
The main objective of this subsection is to evaluate how the …nancial frictions shock propagates to
the rest of the economy over time. Our previous results suggest that the size of the …nancial shock is
larger in the 2007-2011 period. However, the parameter that governs the transmission of the shock
to macro variables, sp;b, does not change very much. Figure 31 displays the impulse response
functions of output and investment. The top panel of Figure 31 describes the responses to one-
standard deviation of the shock, so it captures the e¤ect of the shock on the desired variables over
time while also taking into account its changing size. The bottom panel of Figure 31 describes the
105

responses to 25-basis-points shock, which are useful for investigating the changes in the transmission
while keeping the size of the shock constant over time.
We can see that the negative responses of output 10 quarters after the shock are 0.1% during
2008-2011 period instead of 0.05% prior to 2008. Similarly, investment, which is the main channel
through which the …nancial shock a¤ects output, responds much more sharply during the 2007-
2011 period, with an accumulated response of minus 6.5% in the …ve years after the shock hits,
as supposed to minus 1.5% in the pre-crisis period.
If we consider the impact of a …xed-sized
shock instead, the resulting responses of both output and investment are virtually the same across
periods. This con…rms our conjecture that what has changed over time is the size of the …nancial
shocks rather than the way in which …nancial markets operate in the model.

4.3.3
Forecasting
Our previous results indicate that the QBLL approach applied to the DSGE model with …nancial
frictions is able to capture important variation of the parameters over time. In particular, Figure
27 provides exhaustive evidence of changes in the volatility of the shocks. The literature on fore-
106

casting with time-varying volatilities (e.g., Carriero, Clark and Marcellino (2015b)) suggests that
we should expect improvements in forecasting accuracy in particularly when evaluating the predic-
tive densities. In this subsection, we use the algorithm outlined in Chapter 2 to generate density
forecasts for the observables, using the posterior distribution of the parameters at the last period T
of the in-sample to generate the out-of-sample predictions. Our forecast origins are 2000Q1-2012Q2
and we generate projections 1 to 8 quarters ahead. In addition to our time-varying DSGE model
with …nancial frictions (TV FF), we compute forecasts for the DSGE model with (…xed FF) and
without …nancial frictions assuming …xed parameters. The standard Smets and Wouters (2007)
(SW) model has been evaluated by Edge and Guerkaynak (2010), Woulters (2012) and Del Negro
and Schorfheide (2013b), and it is able to perform well at long forecast horizons for output growth
and in‡ation, so we use it as a benchmark in Table 17.

10%, 5% and 1% respectively, using a Diebold and Mariano test.
Del Negro, Hasegawa and Schorfheide (2014) and Kolasa and Rubaszek (2015) documented that
the DSGE model with …nancial frictions does not improve forecasts in comparison with the Smets
and Wouters (2007) model in the period before 2007. The results in Table 17 con…rm this since the
inclusion of …nancial frictions worsens the forecasts of in‡ation, output and investment growth in
the period 2000-2006, while improving forecasts of the interest rate. The TV FF model brings the
forecasting performance at similar levels to the SW model during this tranquil period. In addition,
during the volatile period of 2007-2012, the TV FF model con…rms previous …ndings of relatively
good performance of …nancial friction models in comparison to the standard SW model. For the
Fed Funds Rate, the TV FF model delivers statistically signi…cant improvements over the SW
model for both point and density forecasts. One explanation is that by allowing for time variation
in the coe¢ cients of the Taylor rule, we obtain a value for the smoothing parameter that is close
to one; that is, the forecasts from the Taylor rule resemble random walk forecasts, which is an
108

adequate model for forecasting the Fed Funds Rate in the vicinity of the Zero Lower Bound. Table
18 presents similar results for density forecast performance for selected variables44 using log scores.
Qualitatively, the results are similar to the ones using RMSFEs.
4.4
Summary
This Chapter employs the quasi-Bayesian Local Likelihood approach developed previously in Chap-
ter 2 and 3 to a DSGE model that combines the Smets and Wouters (2007) model with …nancial
frictions as in Bernanke et al. (1999). As a consequence, this Chapter proposes a time varying
DSGE model with …nancial frictions. Our results suggest that the parameter governing how …nan-
cial friction shocks a¤ect investment decisions is stable over time, but the volatility of the …nancial
shock jumps in the period 2007-2012 and returns to the pre-crisis values after 2012. Moreover, when
looking at the impulse response functions, we …nd that the responses of output and investment to
25 basis points of the …nancial shock do not change over time. In contrast, when we consider the
responses to a standard deviation of the shock, taking into account the changing volatility over
time, we observe a substantial change in the way these variables respond to …nancial shocks during
the period of the recent crisis. This evidence leads us to provide an interpretation of the recent
…nancial crisis as a ‘Bad Luck’event , that is, it is caused by changes in the volatility of …nancial
shocks while taking into account policy changes. An alternative explanation of the results presented
in this Chapter is that the DSGE model we consider is perhaps too stylised to fully account for the
connection between the …nancial sector and the macroeconomy and, as a consequence, the events
of the 2008 crisis appear in the variance of the …nancial friction shock instead.
Finally, our forecasting exercise demonstrates that the time varying model with …nancial frictions
improves the forecasting performance of the …nancial friction model especially in the tranquil 2000-
2006 period.

TVP AR(1) models can be found in Appendix 6.4.

Time Varying COMPASS Model of the U.K. Economy
5.1
Introduction
As argued in Chapter 3 and 4, medium-sized DSGE models, such as the one presented in Smets
and Wouters (2007), are routinely estimated by academics and policy makers for the U.S. economy.
However, such models are tailor-made for the U.S. and the standard assumption made is closed
economy, which might not be appropriate for small open economies. Hence, central banks in other
countries have developed their own DSGE models aimed at …tting better data in their economy,
e.g. the Riksbank’s RAMSES model (Adolfson et al. (2007)) or the ECB’s New Area Wide model
(Christo¤el et al. (2010)). A medium-sized DSGE for the U.K. economy, referred to as COMPASS,
was developed by Burgess, Fernandez-Corugedo, Groth, Harrison, Monti, Theodoridis and Waldron
(2013).
COMPASS is an open economy New Keynesian model which shares many theoretical
features of other DSGE models.
As discussed in Chapter 3, the estimation of DSGE models relies on the assumption that the
model’s parameters are not subject to change; i.e. parameters are structural in the Lucas sense -
invariant to both policy and shocks. In general, this is a strong assumption that is worthy of testing.
And, over particular time periods, there are reasons to doubt it will hold. For example, the UK
economy is likely to have experienced several structural breaks over several decades associated with
changes in monetary regime. Following the end of the Bretton Woods system and various crises in
the mid 1970s, UK monetary policy was set by the government with the aim of controlling various
di¤erent monetary aggregates. This framework was replaced in the late 1980s by informal exchange
rate targeting, which was formalised in 1989 when the UK entered the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
The ERM came to an end in 1992 when the target level of sterling became unsustainable, after
which it was replaced by in‡ation targeting, which was conducted by the Government until 1997
and the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England subsequently.
Putting aside the
certainty that parameters describing the behaviour of monetary policy would have changed over
this period, it is hard to believe that such fundamental changes in monetary regime would not have
been accompanied by changes in, for example, parameters describing the price setting behaviour
of …rms.
More recently, the Great Recession of 2008 caused a large and persistent decline in
activity relative to pre-crisis levels, which is hard to reconcile with pre-crisis parameter estimates.
And, once the Bank rate had become constrained by an e¤ective lower bound, the picture is further
complicated by the adoption of large scale asset purchases and an increased use of forward guidance.
110

At the very least, it is hard to believe that parameters governing macroeconomic volatility (the
standard deviations of shocks) would have been una¤ected by the crisis. Such parameter variation,
if ignored can result into misspeci…cation and poor model …t. Hence, even if one believes in the
structural nature of DSGE parameters, it is important that one recognises at least the possibility of
parameter drift. The estimation exercise in Burgess et al. (2013) sidesteps some of these issues by
restricting the estimation to the post in‡ation targeting, pre …nancial crisis sample (1993-2007) and
by removing some of the remaining trends from the data (like the disin‡ation following the adoption
of in‡ation targeting in the early 1990s). This strategy has the advantage of making it more likely
that the constant parameter assumption is valid, but has two main drawbacks. The sample is, by
almost any standard, relatively short. Although this is mitigated by the use of Bayesian techniques,
it is certainly not ideal, because there would be additional variation over a longer sample that should
improve the identi…cation of the posterior parameter estimates. More importantly, in hindsight,
it is clear that the 1993-2007 sample represents an extraordinarily benign period of steady growth
and broader macroeconomic stability. Parameter estimates over this period are, therefore, unlikely
to be a good guide to the future, which has obvious implications for forecasting. Time variation
in the model’s parameters can also be a signal for misspeci…cation and hence allowing for time
variation can improve the …t of the model as well as serve as a future guide to amend and revise it.
In this Chapter, we employ the approach developed in Chapter 3 and apply it to COMPASS to
investigate the structural nature of the parameters of the model. The ‡exibility of the approach in
the face of structural change permits the estimation of COMPASS over a longer period, alleviating
the need to restrict the sample to post-1993 and pre-crisis data. In this version of this Chapter,
we investigate the time-variation that is due to the …nancial crisis as well as the period 1987-
1993, leaving estimation using pre-1987 data for future work45. Our prioritisation of possible time
variation induced by the …nancial crisis re‡ects that it is more immediately applicable to.
In
addition, we investigate the time-variation that is due to the …nancial crisis, in part because that
is more immediately applicable to analysis of the current economic outlook. The evident changes
in the transmission of monetary-policy shocks and in the estimated productivity trend we …nd, as
well as the large changes in the volatility parameters, highlight the importance of this exercise and
contribute to the small but expanding literature on estimating DSGE models with time variation
in the parameters. Our main empirical …nding is that the risk premium shock in the model has

early in the sample with the Kalman …lter.
111

played an important role in the UK economy during the recent …nancial crisis. In particular, we
…nd the volatility of the shock is nearly twofold its 2000 level and the transmission of the shock to
economic variables, such as the nominal interest rate, has changed considerably during the crisis.
Finally, since COMPASS is used routinely for generating quarterly forecasts for the UK economy,
allowing the model’s parameters to change and using only their most recent values for generating
predictions is a useful modi…cation that makes the model more ‡exible and delivers some gains in
the model’s forecasting performance46.
The remainder of the Chapter is organised as follows. Section 5.2 presents COMPASS, Sections
5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 contains the empirical results and forecasting comparison and Section 5.8
concludes.
5.2
Model and Data
We apply the methodology developed in Chapter 3 to an operational medium size DSGE model
of the UK economy, namely that used as the main organizing framework in the Bank of England
forecasting process, since late 2011. A detailed description of the model - known as COMPASS,
which is short for Central Organizing Model for Projection Analysis and Scenario Simulation - is
presented in Burgess et al. (2013).
For our purposes, a high level description of the model setup and an overview of the key
mechanisms is enough. In particular, for the most part we will report log-linearized conditions,
referring to Burgess et al. (2013) for the derivation from …rst principles. The economy is made up
of …ve main economic agent types: households, …rms, the monetary policy maker, the government
and the rest of the world. We will brie‡y describe each of them in turn.
5.2.1
Households
Households come in two types: optimizing and hand-to-mouth. Optimizing households make the
following key economic decisions:
46The advantage of the time varying version of the model over the standard …xed parameter version is its better
forecast performance, which comes at no extra computational cost since for generating forecasts, only the posterior
distribution at the last period is required. However, one might still want to use the standard …xed parameter version
in a policy setting: i) from a policy perspective it is not clear how useful the time varying version is because the
parameter changes are external to agents in the model; ii) it is more computationally demanding to estimate, as it
requires characterisation of the posterior density at each point in time.

Equation (39) is a relatively standard consumption Euler equation. The …rst term on the
RHS contains past consumption because agents’utility is subject to habit formation while
the second term contains a risk-premium term ^"B
t , which measures a wedge between the rate
set by policy-makers and that faced by consumers. The third term on the RHS depends on
the fact that a share (1   !0) of the agents are hand-to-mouth so their consumption depends
on their labor income.
2. Investment Decision
Optimizing Households can smooth consumption over time by either investing in physical
113

capital or investing in …nancial assets.
Investment is subject to adjustment costs, which
result in the following standard-looking Euler equation:

result is the following UIP condition:

which is an arbitrage condition between returns on domestic and foreign assets.
4. Wage Setting
Households supply di¤erentiated labor services in a monopolistically competitive setting. As
a result, they have some degree of wage-setting power, i.e. they set their nominal wage at a
markup over their marginal-rate of substitution between consumption and leisure (see Erceg,
Henderson and Levin (2000)). The wage setting process is also subject to an adjustment cost
(Rotemberg (1982)) which, when allowing for indexation to the previous periods’wage rate
governed by W , results in the following wage Phillips Curve:

where the …rst term on the RHS is the markup, which is allowed to vary over time, and the
second represents the marginal rate of substitution.
114

Hand-to-mouth households do not have access to …nancial markets by assumption. They will
consume their labor income in every period and will receive government transfers to ensure their
income grows in line with that of optimizing households along the balanced growth path.
5.2.2
Firms
The production sector in COMPASS is somewhat more complicated than in most medium-size
DSGEs (e.g. Smets and Wouters, 2007) because of interactions with the rest of the world and
because the model is required to provide a detailed breakdown of various "demand components".
1. Value Added Producers
This is the most standard of sectors.
Firms hire capital and labor, which are used in a
Cobb-Douglas production function:
vt = (1   L) kt 1 + Llt + ^"TFP
t
Firms face monopolistic competition, hence they set their price at a markup over their mar-
ginal cost. They are also subject to price-adjustment costs, which ultimately result in the
following value-added in‡ation Phillips Curve:

2. Importers
They simply buy goods and services from the rest of the world and sell it domestically. They
set prices in domestic currency at a markup over the marginal cost.
3. Final Output Producers
They operate a similar technology and are subject to the same time of pricing frictions as
the value added producers. However, their production function combines value-added output
and imports to produce …nal output.
4. Retailers
Retailers operate in a competitive market and transform …nal output into Consumption, Busi-
ness and Other Investment, Government Spending and Exports, as Figure 31 illustrates. In
doing so, they operate linear technologies which di¤er in their productivities. This is a tech-
115

nical expedient to accommodate di¤erent trend growth rates in the corresponding observable
variables.
5. Exporters
They buy export goods from the corresponding retail sector and sell it to the rest of the
world. They operate in a monopolistically-competitive market subject to price-adjustment
frictions, which results in a Phillips Curve along the lines of equation (41) (prices are set in
foreign currency).

which feature a response to annual in‡ation in deviation from its target (which also corresponds
to its steady-state level in COMPASS), the output gap and a degree of interest-rate smoothing
governed by R. The Taylor rule is not subject to in‡ation-target shocks (see Del Negro et al.
(2014)) because the target has never changed in the UK since it was …rst introduced47
5.2.4
Government Spending
Real-government spending, in deviations from trend, is assumed to follow a simple autoregressive
process:

t = (G   1) gt 1 + ^"G

(42)
where Z
t measures labor-augmenting productivity and spending is …nanced via lump-sum taxes on

5.2.5
Rest of the World
While it still retains some features of a closed economy, e.g. the interest-rate setting power, the
UK economy is, in many ways, modeled as a small open economy.
47The data is detrended in a way that we will details in the next section so that this is not an issue even prior to
the introduction of the 2 percent in‡ation target.
116

In particular, this implies that world output and prices are independent of domestic shocks,
with one important exception, which is necessary for balanced growth, namely the fact that the
world economy inherits the domestic permanent labor productivity shock according to a term !F
t
which ensures the catching up of the world to the domestic productivity shock does not happen
instantaneously.
As a result, the world economy is described by three simple equations:

which describe world output (which includes the !F

equation governing the demand for UK exports, which is an increasing function of world output
and a decreasing function of the prices of UK exports (pEXP
t
) relative to world prices, the " terms
representing exogenous disturbances.
5.3
Data
The model is estimated using …fteen macroeconomic quarterly time series48 for the period of 1987Q3
to 2012Q3. The variables, data transformations and measurement equations are described in Ap-
pendix 7.4. All variables, except for the policy rate, are log-di¤erenced. We also subtract what we
call time-varying trends from some of the variables, e.g. exports. This terms represent a simple way
to capture the fact while the model implies a common long-run growth rate for all real variables,
the average growth rates measured in the sample di¤er. Most time-varying trends capture this
idea, i.e. they subtract a constant from the log-di¤erenced variable so that it roughly averages the
same growth rate as UK GDP.
The exception to this rule in the in‡ation time-varying trend, whose purpose is conceptually
slightly di¤erent. Its purpose is to correct for the fact that prior to 1992 there was no explicit
in‡ation target so there should be no expectation that in‡ation hovered around 2 percent on average.
Hence we pre-process the data so that imposing a 2 percent average for in‡ation throughout is not
restrictive. Irrespective of the motivations behind these corrections, what matters for our purposes
48Notice that COMPASS features 16 structural shocks and 7 measurement errors, so the number of shocks is larger
than the number of observables.
117

is that they are applied before the data is shown to the model and they do not depend on model
estimates. Rather they are part of the transformation of raw data into model-consistent observables
and capture features of the data COMPASS is not meant to model accurately (e.g. secular trends
in world trade).
5.4
Estimation Results
In this Section we present results for the …xed parameter model and also for the version with time
varying parameters estimated with the QBLL method described in Chapter 3. In both cases, we
employ most priors from Burgess et al. (2013)49, with four MH chains with 220; 000 draws each,
from which we drop the …rst 20; 000, and apply a thinning rate of 50%50. We set the MH scaling
parameters such that acceptance rates are around 25%. We apply the QBLL method using the
Normal kernel function in equation (5) with a bandwidth size of
p

approach, the light blue dotted lines are the 5% and 95% posterior bands, the dotted black line

green lines are the corresponding 5% and 95% posterior bands around it. We employ Figures 33-35
to judge informally whether a parameter’s variation is substantial by checking whether the QBLL
estimates are outside the con…dence bands of the …xed-parameter estimate.
The Taylor rule parameters are subjected to some time variation. In particular, the output
gap coe¢ cient increases twofold from its early 2000s level, indicative of a possible shift in the
weight attached to stabilising output versus headline in‡ation in response to oil price shocks and
the …nancial crisis. At the same time, the interest rate smoothing parameter –the coe¢ cient on
the lagged policy rate in the Taylor rule – declines, indicative of a desire for the central bank
to react more quickly to unfolding events than the reduced-form Taylor rule characterisation of
their past behaviour would have prescribed. In addition, consistent with the substantial easing
of policy during the crisis, the volatility of the monetary policy shock increases towards the end
of the sample. In fact, we …nd considerable time variation in some parameters that govern the
stochastic processes of the exogenous shocks. In particular, we …nd that both the persistence and
the volatility of the risk premium shock display a U-shape over our sample period, with its standard
deviation more than doubling in the end of the sample compared to pre-crisis levels. Moreover the
volatility of the world output shock also increase in the end of the sample, in order to capture
the increased volatility we observe in foreign output data during the crisis. Trend productivity,
119

Figure 34: QBLL Estimates COMPASS
the steady state growth rate of …nal output per capita, also falls slightly during the crisis. The
standard …xed parameter approach underestimates this value between 1995-2005 but overestimates
it at the beginning and end of the sample. This parameter is important for generating forecasts51
as it appears in several of the measurement equations (output, consumptions, investment, export,
imports and wages) and allowing it to vary is expected to have an e¤ect on the model’s forecasting
performance.
Finally, in Figure 35, we observe that the measurement error standard deviations of our time
varying COMPASS model are uniformly lower than the estimates of the standard …xed parameter
model, implying that allowing for time variation in fact improves the …t of the model leading to
smaller measurement error.
5.5
Time varying impulse response functions
In this Section, we investigate the changing transmission mechanism of shocks over time. Figure
36 and 37 display the impulse response functions for output, prices, nominal interest rate and the
exchange rate to a monetary policy shock varying over time52.
51In fact, Burgess et al. (2013) calibrate this parameter to a value of 1.007 (or 2.7902 in annualised terms).
52The monetary policy shock in the model is a transitory shock without persistence.
120

Figure 35: IRFs of variables to 1 st. dev. monetary policy shock
Figure 36 displays responses to a one standard deviation of the shock and captures the e¤ect
of the policy shock on the variables of interest, while also taking into account the changing size of
the shock. Figure 37, on the other hand, presents the responses to a 25 basis points shock, which is
useful in investigating changes in the transmission mechanism of the shock while keeping the size
of the shock constant over time. It is evident from the estimation results in Figure 34 that the size
of the monetary policy shock, that is, its volatility, displays a U-shape, with values of 0.1 in the
period 1995-2005. A reduced role for monetary policy shocks over this period is consistent with
policy having been very stable over this period. As result, both output and in‡ation become less
responsive to the policy shock during this period, which is clear from Figure 36. From Figure 37, it
is evident that even when we ‘switch o¤’the changing volatility over time, by keeping the size of the
shock …xed, output and in‡ation remain less responsive to the shock after 1997. These results are
consistent with evidence presented in Boivin and Giannoni (2006) for the U.S., who interpret the
decreased responsiveness of in‡ation and output to a monetary policy shock after the 1980s which
they …nd in their application, as an outcome of the monetary authority becoming more e¤ective
and systematically more responsive in managing economic ‡uctuations after 1980. Similarly, for
the UK, we can explain the decreased responsiveness of output and in‡ation to a policy shock (i.e.
response to the non-systematic component of monetary policy) by the Bank of England becoming
independent and hence more e¤ective in the systematic conduct of monetary policy after 1998.
121

Figure 36: IRFs of variables to 25 basis points monetary policy shock
Figure 38 and 39 present the impulse response functions of output, consumption, the nominal rate
and investment to: (i) a one standard deviation and, (ii) 25 basis points of the risk premium shock
respectively. From the analysis in the previous Section, both the persistence and the volatility of
the shock display a U-shape during 1995-2005, so it is not surprising that the responses to the shock
follow a similar pattern with responses for output, consumption and investment all responding less
to the shock both on impact and in terms of duration during this period. In addition, we …nd
evidence of considerable time variation in the transmission mechanism of the risk premium shock
to the nominal interest rate and this result is robust whether we consider the changing size of the
shock, as in Figure 38, or 25 basis points, as in Figure 39. In particular, the response to a standard
deviation of the shock is close to zero during the period of 1997-2005 on impact and on duration
and jumps to -0.2 during the crisis period with around 15 quarters required for the nominal rate
to go back to steady state. This large structural change in the nominal rate during the second
half of the sample can be explained by the uncovered time variation in the Taylor rule output gap
parameter during the same period, since the output gap is a¤ected by the risk premium shock
through its e¤ect on consumption and investment. This, combined with the increase in the size of
the risk premium shock, causes an intensi…ed response of the interest rate.
122

Figure 37: IRFs of variables to 1 st. dev. risk premium shock
5.6
Time varying variance decompositions
In this Section, we investigate the changing variance decompositions of key model observables over
time. Figures 40-42 display the proportion of the variance of GDP growth, in‡ation and the policy
rate respectively explained by the various exogenous shocks over time. The variance of GDP growth
is explained primarily by the variance of demand shocks but towards the end of the sample, we see
that the risk premium shock also starts to play a role even at longer horizons. In‡ation’s variation
is absorbed almost entirely by the variance of domestic mark up shocks at one quarter ahead, while
at two and four years, we observe that imported price shocks and the risk premium shock also have
an e¤ect. Finally, the variance of the policy rate is almost entirely explained by the variance of the
monetary policy shock at one quarter ahead. In the period 1997-2005, domestic demand shocks
explain around 20-40% of the policy rate variation at two and four years, while at the end of the
sample, the risk premium shock explains nearly 80% of the policy rate variation. This is more
evidence suggesting that the role of the risk premium shock has been substantial during the recent
…nancial crisis. There are two competing explanations for these results. First, the risk premium
is a wedge between the interest rate set by the central bank and the rates faced by agents in the
model at which they borrow and lend and in this sense, the risk premium shock can be thought
of as a shock to the borrowing costs of agents. So, unsurprisingly, its size increases during the
123

Figure 38: IRFs of variables to 25 basis points risk premium shock
recent …nancial crisis, re‡ecting the increasing borrowing costs during the so called credit crunch.
A second and more critical approach to explaining the result is by recalling that COMPASS is a
stylised DSGE model which lacks a …nancial sector and cannot therefore account for the events of
2008, other than through an increase in the variance of the exogenous risk premium shock.
124

Forecasting
In this Section we evaluate the relative forecasting performance of our time varying parameter
COMPASS (TVP-COMPASS) model. In addition, we compare the forecasting record of COMPASS
against the …xed-parameter COMPASS (F-COMPASS) speci…cation53. We measure accuracy of
point forecasts using the root mean squared forecast error (RMSFE). The accuracy of density
forecasts are measured by log predictive scores.
We compute the logscore with the help of a
nonparametric estimator to smooth the draws from the predictive density obtained for each forecast
and horizon. We test whether the TVP-COMPASS model is statistically more accurate than the
benchmark F-COMPASS with the Diebold and Mariano (1995) statistic computed with Newey-
West estimator to obtain standard errors. We provide the results of the Diebold-Mariano two-sided
test for the RMSFEs and logscores.
In addition, we also informally access the density forecast performance of the two models by
looking at the probability integral transformation (PIT) at Figure 44, computed as the cumulative
density function of the nonparametric estimator for the predictive density at the ex-post realised
53See Fawcett, Koerber, Masolo and Waldron (2015) for an evaluation of the forecast performance of a …xed
parameter version of COMPASS against statistical and judgemental benchmarks.
125

Figure 40: Variance decomposition of in‡ation
value of the target variable obtained for each forecast and horizon.
Table 19 presents the absolute performance of our TVP COMPASS model (in RMSFEs) and
the relative performance of our approach to the standard F-COMPASS over di¤erent horizons
(numbers smaller than one imply superior performance of the TVP COMPASS relative to the F-
COMPASS). One, two and three stars indicate that we reject the null of equal accuracy in favour
of the better performing model at signi…cance levels of 10%, 5% and 1% respectively. In order to
better understand the strengths and weaknesses of our time varying modi…cation, we have split
the forecast sample into two sub-periods: 1997Q3-2005Q2 and 2005Q3-2010Q4. Moreover, we es-
timate two di¤erent speci…cations of COMPASS: with and without estimating the productivity
trend parameter. When this trend is not estimated, it is calibrated to a value of 1.007 as in Burgess
et al. (2013). From Table 19, several conclusions emerge. First, in the relatively tranquil period
of 1997Q3-2005Q2, which we argued in the previous Section is characterised by low volatility of
monetary policy and risk premium shocks, we …nd better point forecasts for output growth, con-
sumption growth and the interest rate. The better forecast performance of the TVP COMPASS
model for the interest rate is due to the uncovered time variation in the policy rule parameters and
in particular, the coe¢ cient on output gap. Moreover, we …nd large signi…cant improvements for
126

Figure 41: Variance decomposition of policy rate
in‡ation (17-19%) at short horizons, while the F-COMPASS performs better at longer horizons.
Second, when looking at the period 2005Q3-2010Q4, we …nd statistically signi…cant improvements
for output, consumption and hours growth.
On the other hand, our TVP COMPASS delivers
slightly worse forecasts for in‡ation, but the di¤erences are rarely statistically signi…cant. Third, it
seems that whether we estimate the productivity trend or keep it …xed makes little di¤erence as far
as forecasting is concerned. However, there is a pattern in the results; in the …rst subperiod, adding
the trend to the parameter vector delivers almost always uniformly worse point forecasts (although
the di¤erences are very small). This is interesting and could be explained by the fact that the
period is characterised by relatively stable productivity over time, hence as long as productivity
is calibrated at a reasonable value, adding it to the parameter vector only reduces the degrees of
freedom of the estimation, which makes forecasts worse. On the other hand, in the period 2005Q3-
2010Q4, when trend productivity is falling, as shown in Figure 36, the forecasts generated with the
trend speci…cation are almost always uniformly better than when keeping trend calibrated.

Table 20 accesses the quality of the density forecasts measured by logscores of the predictive den-
sity. The table displays absolute log predictive score for the TVP-COMPASS model and di¤erences
in logscores over the alternative F-COMPASS model, so numbers greater than zero imply superior
performance of our approach. It is clear from Table 20 that allowing for time variation in the
parameters of COMPASS delivers large and statistically signi…cant improvements in the density
forecasts during 1997Q3-2005Q2. The period of 2005Q3-2010Q4, on the other hand, is charac-
terised by better TVP COMPASS performance for some variables (output, consumption and hours
growth), while worse for others.

Table 20: Log Predictive Scores.
The …gures under TV are absolute log predictive scores for the COMPASS estimated with
QBLL, computed as the log of the predictive density evaluated at the ex-post realised observation, the …gures under F are
di¤erences of log scores of the TVP-COMPASS over the alternative …xed parameter model. ’*’, ’**’and ’***’indicate rejection
of the null of equal performance against the two-sided alternative at
10%, 5% and 1% signi…cance level respectively, using a
Diebold-Mariano test.
Another way of assessing density forecast performance of the two models is by looking at the
probability integral transformation (PITs) in Figure 44, computed as the CDF of the predictive
density evaluated at the ex-post realised observation. Over a long enough sample, one would expect
outturns in all parts of the distribution at frequencies that match the relevant probabilities. For
example, we would expect to observe 5% of the realised values in the bottom 5% of the distribution.
The histogram in Figure 44 displays the PITs for the TVP-COMPASS model and the F-COMPASS
with green and blue bars respectively and the blue dotted line is the pdf of a uniform distribution.
The PITs in Figure 44 for selected variables at one step ahead reveal that neither model is very
close to delivering a uniform CDF. However, the TVP-COMPASS model is closer to being uniform
than the F-COMPASS variant, suggesting that allowing for time variation improves forecast density
accuracy at the one-step ahead horizon at least to some degree.

Summary
This Chapter applied the quasi-Bayesian nonparametric procedure developed by Chapter 3 to a
DSGE model of the UK economy, in order to assess the question of structural change in the model’s
parameters. We found evidence for time variation in the Taylor rule parameters as well as in the
standard deviation and persistence parameters of some of the exogenous shocks. By looking at the
impulse response functions and the variance decompositions, we also reached a conclusion about
the importance of the risk premium shock and its role in the recent …nancial crisis. We o¤ered
two alternative explanations for this result. The …rst provides an account for the crisis through an
increase in the borrowing costs of agents in the model, while the second explains the result through
an increase in the volatility which shows up in the variances of the exogenous component of the
model, by arguing that the DSGE model is too stylised to …t well the events of the crisis. Finally,
this Chapter also provided a forecasting comparison of the time varying structural model with the
standard …xed parameter model and we found gains for both point and density forecasts, especially
in the 1997Q3-2005Q2 period.

Conclusion
This thesis establishes a novel quasi-Bayesian local likelihood (QBLL) approach for econometric
inference in models with time varying parameters.
The Bayesian framework is constructed by
augmenting the local likelihood of Giraitis et al. (2016) through the Bayes principle with a prior
distribution; this idea delivers asymptotically valid quasi-posterior distributions which admit closed
form expressions in the special case of linear Gaussian models.
The approach is of su¢ cient generality and ‡exibility to produce Gibbs algorithms with mix-
tures of time varying and time invariant parameters. In addition, the approach can be applied
to structural models where the quasi-posterior distributions are not of a known form, using the
Metropolis algorithm proposed in Chapter 3.
Our Monte Carlo study indicates that the class of QBLL estimators exhibit good …nite sample
properties, and inference based on their quasi-posterior densities delivers valid con…dence intervals.
Crucially, as a consequence of modelling time variation nonparametrically, inference based on the
QBLL approach is robust to di¤erent processes for the drifting parameters, its validity not depend-
ing on parametric restrictions typically imposed by state space models. In addition, the proposed
approach has the capacity to facilitate a large number of variables, as a result of the Bayesian prin-
ciple which allows to shrink parameters whenever the model is large. As demonstrated in Chapter
2, this can have important applications in forecasting, delivering signi…cant improvements for both
point and density forecasts.
In Chapter 2, we employ the novel approach to a VAR model to empirically address the issue of
changing macroeconomic dynamics in the U.S. We uncover signi…cant structural change in the series
for core in‡ation, in‡ation persistence and the natural rate of unemployment as well as substantial
drifts in the volatility of the series. We stress that in this context, not modelling explicitly the time
variation will result in invalid inference on the model’s parameters.
In Chapter 3 we developed the method further to the estimation of structural DSGE models
and applied it to the Smets and Wouters (2007) model. In Chapter 4, we extend the DSGE model
and add …nancial frictions in order to investigate the structural change in the …nancial sector of
the model during the recent crisis. We found that the volatility of the …nancial shock of the model
increases two-fold during the crisis period while the structural parameters guiding the …nancial
sector remain unchanged, which led us to give a ‘Bad Luck’ event interpretation of the crisis.
Finally, in Chapter 5, we estimated the COMPASS model used by the Bank of England on UK
131

data in order to investigate structural change in the UK economy.
The main result that we …nd in Chapters 3-5 is that DSGE models’parameters are generally
not constant over time. We …nd evidence of drifts in the policy parameters and this is unsurprising,
given how much monetary policy has evolved in the past few decades. We also …nd considerable
variation in the volatility of the structural shocks.
Importantly, when allowing for parameter
variation, we can improve the forecasting performance of standard …xed parameter models, which
can provide a valuable tool for policy analysis.

Proofs and Additional Results for Chapter 2
7.1.1
Proof of Proposition 1
We follow the proof of Theorem 1 in Chernozhukov and Hong (2003), which is a generalisation
of earlier results by Ibragimov and Has’minskii (1981) and Bickel and Yahav (1969) for a non-
likelihood based objective functions.
We replace Chernozhukov and Hong (2003)’s asymptotic
analysis based on
p
T-neighbourhoods of the true (in their analysis …xed) parameter 0 to general
{1=2
jT -neighbourhoods of 0
j (now indexed by time) with {jT de…ned in (6). This is justi…ed since
{jT  H
 R
K(x)dx
2
R
K2(x)dx
where H, the bandwidth parameter associated with the kernel, satis…es H ! 1 as T ! 1:
In fact, the argument of Chernozhukov and Hong (2003) is valid for an arbitrary m1=2
T -neighbourhood
as long as mT ! 1 as T ! 1. The radius of the speci…ed neighbourhood corresponds to the
consistency rate of the extremum estimator of 0
j.
Assumptions.

4. The prior density j(:) is strictly positive and Lipschitz continuous function over .
5. The time variation in the true parameters 0
j satis…es one of conditions (1) or (2).
The asymptotics in Proposition 1 is established as T ! 1; and since j = [T]; we have
j ! 1: We explicitly allow the quantities above to depend on j in order to emphasise the time
varying nature of the estimation problem. Assumption 1 is a standard assumption maintained by
Giraitis et al. (2016). Assumption 2 is a high-level assumption that requires uniform convergence
of the objective function outside a neighbourhood of 0
j: A CLT is assumed in 3a) for r'Tj(0
j); the
gradient of the objective function. Assumption 3c), requires that the remainder term RTj(j) of the
quadratic approximation of the objective function is well behaved. By Lemma 2 in Chernozhukov
and Hong (2003) Assumption 3c) is satis…ed for any twice continuously di¤erentiable objective
function with a uniform convergence of the Hessian of second derivatives to its limit. Note that
the objective functions studied in Giraitis et al. (2016) and in this thesis are twice continuously
di¤erentiable and in addition, Giraitis et al. (2016) assume uniform law of large numbers (ULLN)
for the Hessian. Assumption 4 explicitly allows the prior density to vary over time and requires
stronger Lipschitz continuity of j. Finally, Assumption 5 is required for consistent estimation in
144

the frequentist setup of Giraitis et al. (2016) and is a necessary condition for the CLT in Assumption
3a).
Proof.

By using (60) and the dominated convergence theorem, A(2)
Tj !p 0 as T ! 1. Also, (61) implies
that

Tj !p 0 where A(1)
Tj the
integral in (63).
To show that the integral A(1)
Tj !p 0, de…ned in (63), we partition the area of integration in (50)
as follows: HTj = H(1)
Tj [ H(2)
Tj [ H(3)
Tj , where
i) H(1)
Tj

ii) H(2)

iii) H(3)
Tj
=

h 2 HTj : M < khk  p{jT

where  is some positive number satisfying (48) and M is a …xed number in (0; 1). It remains to
prove A(1)
Tj !p 0 over areas i)-iii). Note that, by (50) and Assumption 3(a),

yt = (IM

where 0 = vec(S0

Since the conditional posterior distribution of R 1 and  is of standard form and the conditional
quasi-posterior of t have been established in Proposition 6, a Gibbs algorithm can be designed to
approximate the joint posterior of R 1;  and t , using the following steps.
Algorithm 3.
Step 1. Initialise the algorithm with 0 and R 1;0:
For i = 1; :::; N iterate between steps 2 and 3 below.
Step 2. For j 2 f1; :::; Tg draw i
jjY; X; R 1;i 1; i 1 from N(ej; eVj) with posterior parameters
in (22).
Step 3. Draw R 1;i; ijY; X; i
1:T from NW(e; e; e; e) with posterior parameters in (86).
Heteroscedastic BVAR model with mixture of time varying and time invariant slope
parameter
Next, we consider a heteroscedastic BVAR model which includes, in addition to
heteroscedasticity and …xed slope coe¢ cients , a subset of regressors which enter the model with
drifting parameters t
yt = (IM 
 Zt) + (IM 
 Xt)t + R 1=2
t
t;
t  N(0; IM)
(87)
where Zt are …xed exogenous variables or lags of yt: Conditional on ; the model can be written as
byt = yt   (IM 
 Zt) = (IM 
 Xt)t + R 1=2
t
t:
Draws from the joint quasi-posterior of t and Rt can be obtained using the closed form ex-
pressions in Proposition 1, using byt instead of yt; if a Normal-Wishart prior NW(0j; 0j; 0j; 0j)
161

is assumed for j and Rj; then, the posterior is also Normal-Wishart NW(ej; ej; eaj; ej) with pa-
rameters given in (19).
On the other hand, conditional on the draw from the history of 1:T and R1:T ; we can de…ne
y
t = R1=2
t
(yt   (IM 
 Xt)t) = z
t  + t with z
t = R1=2
t
(IM 
 Zt) and the model reduces to the
standard linear Gaussian model with …xed parameters and known variance: Then, by assuming
a normal prior N(0; Q0) for ; the conditional posterior is also Normal: jY; X; Z; R 1
1:T ; 1:T 

Hence, the conditional posterior of  is of standard form and the conditional quasi-posterior of j
and R 1
j
have been characterised in Proposition 1 and can be easily drawn from, the model (87)
permits the use of a Gibbs algorithm with the following steps to approximate the joint posterior of
1:T ; R1:T and .
Algorithm 4.
Step 1. Initialise the algorithm with 0:
For i = 1; :::; N iterate between steps 2 and 3 below.
Step 2. For each j 2 f1; :::; Tg ; draw R 1;i

respectively. The models that we compare are the QBLL estimator of with Normal-Gamma prior
introduced in Section 2.3, a QBLL estimator with a uniform prior (which delivers an estimator
164

equivalent to the frequentist estimator of Giraitis et al. (2014)), a state space model with volatility
modelled as in Kim et al. (1998) and a particle …lter. We present two sets of results: i) when the
correct state equation is speci…ed and ii) when instead we …t a stationary AR(1) state equations54
with an autoregressive parameter 0.5. The tables below summarise the bias, MSE and coverage
rates for di¤erent models and also, where applicable, for di¤erent bandwidth parameters.

 is the steady state rental rate of capital.  is the steady state
growth rate of output, used to detrend all non-stationary variables in the model and  is the
depreciation rate of capital. Exogenous government spending follows an AR(1) stochastic process
with an autoregressive coe¢ cient g and an iid-Normal error term g

where a
t is the iid-Normal shock to TFP and is motivated by Smets and Wouters (2007) as the
model at hand is a closed economy, with "g
t also including data on exports/imports, which could
depend on domestic productivity a

The Euler equation for consumption is:

and implies that consumption ct is a weighted average between past consumption ct 1 and expected
future consumption Etct+1. It also depends on expected growth in the hours worked Et(lt   lt+1)
and ex-ante real interest rate rt Ett+1 and a risk premium shock "b

the instrument controlled by the central bank and the rate of return on assets faced by households.

b:
"b

t 1 + b
t:
In the absence of habit formation,  = 0, the …rst term drops out and the Euler equation
becomes entirely forward-looking. When the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, c = 1, the
171

household is facing log utility in consumption and the labour supply term drops out.
The investment Euler equation is:

implying that current investment it is a weighted average of past investment it 1 and expected
future investment Etit+1. It also depends on the real value of capital qt and an investment-speci…c
technology disturbance term "i

follows an AR(1) stochastic process with an autoregressive coe¢ cient i and an iid-Normal error

"i

' is the steady state elasticity of capital adjustment cost and  is the household’s discount factor.
The arbitrage condition between the return to capital and the riskless rate is given by:

Rk + (1   ))Etrk

real rental rate of capital Etrk

rt   Ett+1 and the risk-premium disturbance "b

with output being produced with standard factors of production, capital ks

t 1 + a
t :
The parameter  measures one plus the …xed costs in production and  is the capital share after
mark-ups and …xed costs. Since the capital installed today takes a period to become e¤ective,
current capital used in production ks
t is a sum of capital installed the previous period kt 1 and the
degree of capital utilization zt:
ks
t = kt 1 + zt:
172

The degree of capital utilization zt itself depends positively in the rental rate of capital rk
t and  
is a function of the elasticity of capital utilization adjustment cost function, normalised to take
valued between zero and one:
zt = 1  

The price mark-up p

marginal product of labour mplt, which depends on TFP and the capital-labour ratio, and the real

t . Without degree of indexation,
p = 0, the expression reduces to purely forward-looking Phillips curve.
p is the Calvo price
stickiness, "p is the Kimball aggregator in the goods market that measures the degree of strategic
interaction between price-setters and    1 is the steady state price mark-up, which depends on
the …xed cost parameter . The price mark-up error term "p

an autoregressive coe¢ cient p, a moving average coe¢ cient p and an iid-Normal error term p

Rental rate of capital is a function of the capital-labour ratio (kt   lt) and the real wage wt:

The labour market is characterised by similar conditions to the goods market. In particular,
there is a wage mark-up equation:

t is the di¤erence between the real wage wt and the marginal rate of

the elasticity of labour supply with respect to the wage. The corresponding wage equation is given
by:
wt =

The real wage wt is a weighted average between past wage wt 1 and expected future real wage

7.3.1
The Smets and Wouters (2007) model with …nancial frictions
The model we use is a Smets and Wouters (2007) model with a deterministic trend, modi…ed to
include a …nancial friction block, as in Bernanke et al. (1999). We refer the reader to the original
paper, Smets and Wouters (2007), for discussion and derivation of the model’s equation and for
completeness, we list here the linearised equations. See also the Technical Appendix in Smets and
Wouters (2007) available at: http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/june07/20041254_app.pdf.
For
expressions of the FF block parameters and steady states, see:

For the time varying parameter (TVP) AR(1), the model is estimated in each point in time t :
bt = (X0DtX) 1X0DtY where X contains the lagged dependent variable Y and Dt is a diagonal
matrix with the kernel weights of the tth row of the weighting matrix in equation (4) in its main
diagonal.
The variance of the residuals is also time varying and computed in point t as b2
t =
"0Dt"=tr(Dt): Density forecasts are then generated, using wild bootstrap and the last period values

Examples of parameter processes
In a referee report, we were asked to be more explicit about what parameter processes the approach
can recover. We include a brief discussion below. Recall that we require the parameters to satisfy
one of the following:
(i) For each t 2 f1; :::; Tg ; t is a deterministic function of time given by
t = 
 t
T

where (:) is a piecewise di¤erentiable function.
(ii) For 1  h  t as h ! 1; t is a vector-valued stochastic process satisfying
sup
j:jj tjh
jjt   jjj2 = Op (h=t) :
Condition i) covers deterministic functions of the time fraction t=T, constant parameters as a
special case as well as breaks in the parameter processes. Condition ii) allows the process to be
stochastic but requires it to be persistent in order for the approach to be able to recover the time
variation. Note that ii) includes processes such as the bounded random walk process used in DGPII
and DGPIII in Chapter 2:
t =
Pt
i=1 "t
p
t
;
"t  N(0; v):
This process can equivalently be written as
t =
r
t   1
t
t 1 + "t
p
t;
so that the variance of the innovations is decreasing while the process is becoming closer to unit
root, and hence the variance of the process t stabilises. In addition, condition ii) also covers long
memory processes with memory parameter d > 0:5: A stationary AR(1) process is not covered
in condition ii), as it is not persistent enough. Finally, the approach developed in this thesis is
also valid for a combination processes between i) and ii). In the …gure below, we provide several
examples of parameter processes satisfying condition i) or ii) or a combination of the two.
