Research on nonprofit organizations becoming more business-like in their structure and 
function has garnered considerable academic interest in recent years. This trend, also referred to 
as managerialism, has traditionally been explored from organizational or management 
perspectives, and much of the research on the topic has focused on examining the motivation 
behind for nonprofits embracing approaches and practices more commonly found in the for-
profit sector. The purpose of this dissertation research was to expand the study of managerialism, 
specifically within social justice nonprofit organizations, by examining the environmental 
context within which these organizations exist to better understand how the organizational 

iii 
environment contributes to the emergence and operationalization of managerialist approaches 
and practices.  
 
With this goal in mind, a case study of three social justice nonprofits in a large, 
metropolitan city in the United States was conducted. Interviews took place with 43 staff 
members whose positions ranged from frontline employees to CEOs. The data was analyzed 
using Constructivist Grounded Theory Analytic Techniques.  
 
From the data emerged a conceptual model illuminating how organizations are affected 
by their internal and external environments, and the mechanisms that staff employ to manage 
these impacts. Specifically, the model shows how organizations exist in a relationship of 
dependency with external stakeholders, and that staff members engage in several response 
processes in order to manage this relationship. Furthermore, the data indicate that not only does 
managerialism emerge as a result of this relationship, it is also used as a way to respond to the 
challenges organizations face as a result of being dependent on external stakeholders. 
Implications of these findings on both research and practice are explored.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
 
The pursuit of knowledge can be a lonely journey filled with endless days in an office 
surrounded by no one and nothing but shelves of books, piles of paper, a computer, and only the 
internet to connect you to the outside world. The irony of this is that it is entirely impossible to 
move your thoughts from an idea to a reality in the way academia requires without the assistance 
of others. So while I spent many, many days by myself thinking about how to turn my lived 
experiences into a research question that was interesting enough to warrant answering through a 
dissertation project, there were countless people supporting me, cheering me on in their own 
small ways, and making sure that I succeeded even when it seemed utterly impossible. It’s not 
often that you get to thank people publically, so I am grateful to have this opportunity to 
acknowledge those who have been instrumental helping me bring this dissertation to fruition, and 
in my success overall throughout the years.  
 
This journey began at a community college on Long Island, New York, somewhat against 
my will. Little did I know as I began my freshman year that the courses I took and the professors 
who taught them would set me on the path of lifetime learning, igniting in me an inquisitiveness 
and passion for knowledge that I didn’t know I possessed. I am forever grateful to my parents, 
who informed me during my senior year in high school that Nassau Community College was my 
only option until I could prove that I was “college material”. I don’t take such challenges lightly; 
I hope I have made you proud!  

xii 
 
I am so fortunate to have the support of such a wonderful dissertation committee, without 
whom this project would never have been possible. Thank you, Dr. Ian Holloway, for your 
willingness to serve on my committee, and for recognizing the importance of supporting doctoral 
students in developing the skills critical to our success. Although I didn’t know very much about 
your research, you invited me to help you finish a manuscript and I learned so much from the 
process. Thank you for allowing me to contribute, however small it was, to your work.  
 
Dr. Lois Takahashi, even though we didn’t know each other very well when I initially 
contacted you, your willingness to be a committee member means so much. I am so grateful to 
have had the opportunity to get to know you over these last few years, and have tremendously 
valued your insights regarding my work. Dr. Bill Parent, our many conversations in your office 
and over coffee played a fundamental role in helping me to conceptualize my research questions. 
The space you provided me to vent and mull over ideas was invaluable to this project, and my 
learning overall. Most of all, you believed from the beginning that my research questions were 
worthy of investigation, even when others didn’t. Thank you.  
 
My co-chairs, Dr. Todd Franke and Dr. Lené Levy-Storms, were the pillars of this 
project. Without you both it would have never reached completion. Lené, you expressed interest 
in my topic and showed enthusiasm for the idea when I needed it most. Your commitment to my 
learning and development as a scholar has been critical to my success, and I so value the many 
conversations we have had working through complicated ideas. You have also shown me what it 
looks like to be a successful academic mama, and that it’s possible to be an excellent scholar 
while also being a good parent. This is not easy to achieve, you do it with poise and grace. Thank 
you for showing me the way.  

xiii 
 
Todd, you have been there since the beginning of this journey. You had faith in me when 
others didn’t, and implored me not to quit. For this, I am forever grateful. You are an exemplary 
advisor and have modeled for me what it means to truly support students. I hope that I can 
provide half of what you have given to me to my future students. From the bottom of my heart, 
thank you. 
 
I would also like to acknowledge some of the other people at UCLA who have supported 
me throughout the years. Dr. Aurora Jackson, your willingness to work with me and help me 
clear the first year exam hurdle was fundamental to my continued success in the program. Thank 
you for investing in me, and believing that I could be successful. Duke will always be welcome 
at our house!  
 
The Center for Community Learning provided me a second home where I could engage 
my passions for civic engagement, become a successful educator, and hone my research skills. 
My five years working for the center played a critical role in my academic development. Dr. 
Kathy O’ Byrne, Dr. Doug Barrera, and Dr. Beth Goodhue, thank you for inviting me to be part 
of the special community of scholars, educators, and students that is CCL. My time with you all 
has been nothing short of incredible. 
 
I must also mention Tanya Youssephfzadeh. Without your knowledge of the system and 
your willingness to help me navigate the unwieldy bureaucracy that is UCLA, I am quite certain 
I would have failed to submit something important or lost an employment opportunity along the 
way! Thank you for your patience these past seven years. 
 
This study would not have happened without the organizations who participated and the 
staff members who graciously agreed to meet with me to share their experiences. After being in 
academia for so long, you were my connection back to the world of nonprofits and social justice 

xiv 
work. Your commitment to helping others and working to achieve social change reminds me 
why I became a social worker. I am proud to have your voices included in this study and I hope I 
did justice to your experiences and the hard work you do every single day. 
 
It’s impossible to mention everyone who had an impact on my journey, but several other 
people deserve recognition for providing me with support, encouragement, and laughter over the 
last seven years. Joey and Jenessa Eelkema, you became our family when we made the leap 
west, I am not sure we would have survived had you not opened your home and your hearts to 
us. Joey, our heated conversations about philanthropy will always hold a special place in my 
heart. Gina Rosen and Lesley Harris, thank you for paving the way and proving to me that this 
was actually achievable. Lesley, this project is that much better because of your guidance on and 
enthusiasm for qualitative research (and Kathy Charmaz!), and your willingness to commiserate 
when needed! Amy Kim and Todd Adamson, you understood that it takes a village to raise a 
child and finish a dissertation! Without your empathy and willingness to let me write at WeWork 
Brentwood, I am not sure I would have made it through this last push.  
 
Lastly, I have to thank my family for their unwavering love and support. Marlae, when 
we called, you came. Thank you for always being willing to help in whatever way you could. 
Gram, thanks for always checking in on my progress, and reminding me that I would, in fact, 
finish. It meant a lot that you cared so much. Finally, without my parents, who support me from 
near and far, this would have never been possible. You let me follow my passions. Thank you. 
 
Mark, this PhD is as much yours as it is mine. You took a chance on someone who 
wanted to be a professional student and you never looked back. For that I am grateful. I am 
forever indebted to you for your patience, love, and willingness to talk about managerialism! 

xv 
Without you, none of this would have been possible. You believed in me when I didn’t believe in 
myself, and you told me to keep going. We made it!  
 
Sabrina, you weren’t even a thought when this whole journey began. You won’t 
remember all of the nights I was away, the hours of work that kept me from being able to nuzzle, 
or the many weekends I spent in an office instead of playing with you. But when you are old 
enough to hear the stories, I hope you understand that you were my inspiration. Let this 
dissertation be proof that if you believe you can do it, you will.

CHAPTER 1 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The nonprofit sector has been heavily influenced over the last 35 years by the New Public 
Management (NPM) model, which presumes that market-based strategies and practices are the 
most efficient and effective way to manage and structure nonprofit organizations, (Alexander, 
Brudney, & Yang, 2010; Eikenberry, 2009; Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004; James, 1998; Salamon, 
1993; Smith and Lipsky, 1995; Tuckman, 1998; Weisbrod, 1997; Young, 1998). These strategies 
and practices, typically associated with for-profit entities, are commonly employed by nonprofits 
and their adoption has become widely accepted as beneficial to organizational functioning and 
success. The belief that management practices derived in the for-profit sector—also referred to as 
managerialism—are the most effective means through which organizations can meet their 
missions and goals prevails, particularly in an increasingly difficult financial climate 
characterized by steep competition for resources and increased pressure from external 
constituents to demonstrate operational efficiency. As such, nonprofits of all sizes, with varying 
missions and goals, have adopted strategies and behaviors dictated by the principles of the NPM 
with the hope of ensuring financial stability and ultimately, survival (Bush, 1992, Frumkin & 
Andre-Clark, 2000, Landsberg, 2004).  

1 
However, given the inherent differences in the purpose and function of nonprofit and for-
profit organizations (Anheier, 2005) a critical exploration of managerialism as it relates to 
nonprofits and its impact on these types of organizations is necessary. This is particularly 
important in the context of Social Justice Nonprofit Organizations (SJNO), whose missions and 
activities are explicitly focused on responding to and alleviating the impact of social inequity and 
disparity on marginalized and oppressed populations (NASW, 2000), and are less concerned with 
profitability and efficiency.  
Social Justice Nonprofits 
Social Justice nonprofit organizations exist in a variety of forms, including but not 
limited to, advocacy/social movement organizations, social service agencies that provide direct 
services to disadvantaged populations, grassroots community-based organizations focused on 
advocating for the interests of a particular community, or organizations that create and 
implement direct service programs designed specifically to respond to the needs of individuals 
whose lives are directly affected by systemic social problems. Many SJNOs are also “hybrid” 
organizations, which combine multiple organizational forms such as advocacy and social service 
provision in order to better meet their goals (Minkoff, 2002; Hasenfeld & Gidron, 2005; Hyde, 
1992; Hyde, 2000). 
Although the meaning of social justice is highly contested, with definitions differing 
depending on context (Bonnycastle, 2011), the concept is commonly conceived as an outcome 
that can be achieved (often in the form of redistribution of tangible and intangible resources or 
systemic social change), or a normative ideal of justice to which society should strive 
(Bonnycastle, 2011; Rawls, 1971, 1999; Reisch, 2002; Van Soest, 1993). Many professional 
fields, notably social work and education, have embraced the concept of social justice as a 

2 
guiding principle (Cochran-Smith, 2004; McDonald, 2005; NASW, 2000; Reisch, 2002;). 
However, even within fields where the importance of employing a social justice practice 
framework is somewhat agreed upon, debate over both the definition of the concept and how to 
best achieve it remains rife (Reisch, 2002).   
Building upon the more commonly employed definition of social justice that embraces 
achieving systemic social change (Bonnycastle, 2011; Reisch, 2002), this study utilizes a 
definition that attempts to reflect the wide range of activities undertaken by social justice 
nonprofit organizations. By expanding the definition from one that focuses primarily on systemic 
social change efforts to one that includes any organizational activities or efforts focused (directly 
or indirectly) on responding to and alleviating the impact of social inequity and disparity on 
marginalized and oppressed individuals, groups, or communities, a more inclusive understanding 
of social justice oriented organizational practice is enabled. Furthermore, this more expansive 
definition allows for organizations whose work might normally be dismissed as not contributing 
to social justice (community mental health centers, for example) to be considered within a 
broader paradigm; one that actually views any work with disenfranchised populations as part of a 
greater social justice effort. Moreover, it establishes the concept as not simply a process aimed 
solely at achieving systemic change at the societal level, or a lens through which inequality can 
be analyzed and understood, but also as a dynamic and varied process focused on achieving 
greater equality for historically oppressed populations. Finally, it enables an enhanced, more 
nuanced understanding of nonprofit organizations that work with, or on behalf of, 
disenfranchised populations, whether at the individual, group, or community based level. This 
last point is particularly relevant to the fields of social work and social welfare, especially since 

3 
the nonprofit organization is often the mechanism through which social workers conduct their 
work.  
Despite the variance in structure and function between different types of SJNOs, all are 
guided by missions and goals that recognize and attempt, in some way, to address the 
disproportionate impact of social inequality on disadvantaged and oppressed populations. This is 
quite different from the goals of the for-profit entity, whose emphasis is on profit generating 
activity. It can therefore be argued that the purpose of SJNOs and for-profits are inherently 
incongruent, and that the trend of nonprofits adopting managerialist models rooted in the NPM, 
has the potential to result in unintended consequences for organizations. Such outcomes may 
include, but are not limited to, a diversion from organizational mission and goals (Alexander, 
1999; Alexander, Nank, & Stivers, 1999; Bush, 1992 Guo 2006; Eikenberry, 2009; Eikenberry & 
Kluver, 2004; Salamon, 2002; Weisbrod, 1998; Young, 2005).  
 
Several studies have explored the ways in which nonprofits embrace for-profit practices 
and behaviors. However, few have systematically examined the operationalization of the specific 
for-profit management practices and behaviors that nonprofit organizations have increasingly 
adopted over the last thirty years. Furthermore, research has failed to amply investigate the 
relationship between organizational structure and these behaviors, and the impact of this trend on 
nonprofit organizations also remains relatively unknown. This is especially important to explore 
given the responsibility that lies with SJNOs to provide critical social services to those in need, 
to adequately and effectively respond to the impact of social problems on disadvantaged and 
oppressed populations, and to advocate for systemic social change (Bush, 1992).  
Study Purpose and Overview 

4 
 
The notion of nonprofit organizations becoming more business-like in structure and 
function has gained considerable attention in recent years, with research on this topic 
proliferating in the fields of management and organizational leadership. However, despite the 
ever-increasing interdisciplinary interest in this topic, complexity of the issue means that 
understanding the nature of nonprofits adopting for-profit approaches and practices remains a 
challenging area of inquiry (Maier, Meyer, and Steinbereithner, 2016). Many scholars in a range 
of fields have contributed to the growing understanding of this phenomenon (see, for example, 
Alexander, 1999; Bush, 1992; Dart, 2004) Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004). Yet, as Maier, Meyer, 
and Steinbereithner (2016) explain, “scholars struggle to position their work in a larger context, 
it is not easy to build on previous findings and methodological developments, and research gaps 
are easy to identify”.  
 
Despite an increased understanding of the issue, considerable gaps in research centered 
on the ways in which nonprofits begin to resemble their for-profit counterparts in structure and 
function remain. In reviewing the relevant literature on the subject Meyer, Maier, and 
Steinbereithner (2016) conclude that the research on managerialism and nonprofit organizations 
would benefit from moving beyond framing the concept in terms of assets or challenges to this 
model, and that research emphasizing a greater understanding of the organizational structures 
and processes related to being “business-like” is necessary. Furthermore, more robust empirical 
investigation into the environmental and organizational factors that contribute to this 
phenomenon is critical. With these gaps in mind, this dissertation focuses on understanding how 
nonprofits become more business-like by examining the environmental contexts within which 
organizations operate.  

5 
 
The study specifically focuses on social justice nonprofit organizations. Although 
research has determined that managerialism is a widely occurring phenomenon within nonprofits 
of all types, research has yet to explore the concept exclusively in relation to this specific type of 
nonprofit. The emphasis on SJNOs expands the inquiry from one that has typically existed 
within the fields of organizational and management studies into the field of social welfare. 
Unlike the fields of organizational and management, social welfare emphasizes social justice 
approaches to lessening the adverse affects of inequity on disenfranchised individuals, groups, 
and communities. These efforts often take place through the structures and mechanisms of 
organizations, many of which are nonprofit organizations. While extant research provides some 
insight into how managerialism might affect organizations focused explicitly on social justice 
aims, the unique nature of these nonprofits and the critical role they play in within the broader 
field of social welfare lends itself to an exploration emphasizing these types of organizations.  
 
The purpose of this dissertation is therefore to better understand the environmental 
contexts within social justice nonprofits operate in order to a) ascertain the ways in which 
managerialism emerges, and b) examine the greater milieu within which it functions. To answer 
these questions a qualitative case study approach focusing on the perspectives and experiences of 
staff members at three social justice nonprofit organizations located in a large, metropolitan city 
of the United States was employed1. Forty-five intensive, semi-structured interviews were 
conducted and data were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory analytical techniques.  
Significance and Implications  
 
By focusing on the environments within which social justice nonprofits are situated, this 
dissertation contributes to the literature on managerialism and nonprofit organizations in several

ways. As the first study to explicitly investigate managerialism in social justice nonprofits from a 
social welfare perspective, the research provides both a theoretical and empirical 
conceptualization of the relationship of managerialism to social justice nonprofits. Using 
constructivist grounded theory analytical techniques allowed for an inductive rather than 
deductive approach to data analysis. Consequently, managerialism was treated as a sensitizing 
concept (Charmaz, 2014) throughout the analysis, rather than a construct exerted upon data. This 
technique of letting concepts inductively emerge (Charmaz, 2014) allowed for an organic 
exploration of the concept of managerialism. In other words, by focusing on the environmental 
context within which the organizations in the study existed, the realities of managerialism were 
allowed to emerge from the data in ways that confirmed its existence without making 
predetermined assumptions regarding if, and how, the approach was being employed. As such, 
this research is well positioned to provide insight into how environmental and organizational 
factors contribute to the emergence of managerialism in ways that are currently underdeveloped 
in the literature.  
 
By focusing on organizations whose primary missions and visions are geared toward 
advancing social justice purposes and goals, this study brings a social justice approach to bear 
upon the scholarly inquiry of managerialism and nonprofits. This is an innovative approach to 
the study of managerialism within nonprofits as it is the first study of its kind to use this 
framework to try to answer the larger questions about the role of nonprofit organizations in 
mitigating the effects of persistent systemic social inequality. An approach of this kind also lends 
itself to thinking about how the adoption of managerialism by social justice organizations might 
be impacting larger efforts at social change, which social justice is ultimately concerned with at 
varying levels.

The following chapter explores how managerialism and being “business-like” within 
nonprofit organizations is conceptualized in the existing research literature. The onset of this 
trend is explored, and a theoretical explanation using neoliberalism and institutional theory is 
provided to explain how and why this transition occurred. An in-depth examination of the 
current literature on this topic is also provided, the range of conceptualizations regarding the 
ways in which non-profits embracing for-profit tendencies and orientations is delineated. 
Furthermore, a theoretical framework for how to examine this trend from a social justice 
perspective is presented.

CHAPTER 2 
 LITERATURE REVIEW 
Background and History  
 
The Development and Institutionalization of For Profit Practices Within Non Profit 
Organizations 
Neoliberal Economic Theory and Practice 
 
Scholars in a range of fields have explored, in depth, the tendencies of nonprofit 
organizations to embrace models and practices typically found in the for-profit sector (Dart, 
2004; Hwang & Powell, 2009; Maier & Meyer, 2009; Sanders, 2012; Salamon, 1993; Sanders & 
McClellan, 2012; Weisbrod, 1998). The literature often attributes this inclination to a rise in 
neoliberalism; a set of political, economic, and social practices that emerged in the 1980s and has 
maintained a stronghold within the US and globally for the past 35 years (Eikenberry, 2009; 
Garrow & Hasenfeld, 2012). At its core, neoliberalism is characterized by principles of the free 
market, which suggest that human welfare is best secured and maintained by “liberating 
individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills” (Harvey, 2005, pp. 2), and by embracing the 
concepts of individual responsibility and work ethic (Hasenfeld & Garrow, 2012).  
 
The preponderance of neoliberal policies and practices has resulted in widespread 
embracing of deregulation, privatization, and an overall retraction of the state from the provision 
of services and the social safety net for vulnerable populations (Harvey, 2005; McEwen, 2005). 
Although these trends have, in part, contributed greatly to the exponential growth of nonprofit 
organizations during the latter part of 20th and beginning of the 21st centuries, they have also had 
a significant impact on the structure and function of nonprofits. This is particularly evident in 
both the increase of nonprofits providing services historically provided by the state, as well as 

9 
the types of organizational models nonprofits are likely to embrace, which increasingly resemble 
those typically found in the for-profit sector.  
 
Neoliberalism is, fundamentally, a set of economic principles that emerged after the 
Second World War as a reorganization of capitalism, which was experiencing a structural crisis. 
In response to this crisis, which was characterized by a decrease in the policies, practices, and 
institutions that had supported capitalism’s ultimate goal of capital accumulation, a neoliberal 
approach arose with the hope that the shift would restore the promise of capital growth 
(Campbell, 2005). Although greater detail regarding the ways in which capitalism adopted 
neoliberalism is beyond the scope of this research, it is important to note that the primary goal of 
the shift was, and remains, rooted in “ the systematic use of state power to impose (financial) 
market imperatives” (Saad-Filho & Johnston, 2005, p. 3). (This is not to be confused with ‘state 
interference’, which is differs from the mandates of neoliberalism, which states that “optimal 
outcomes will be achieved if the demand and supply for goods and services are allowed to adjust 
to each other through the price mechanism, without interference by government…(Crouch, 2011, 
p. 17).  
 
As an economic model, neoliberalism emphasizes market domination of the organization 
of society, which calls for “a minimal role for the state and maximal role for markets in 
organizing economic life [and by extension, social life] ”, and is most notably observed in the in 
the form of privatization of public services and state deregulation (McEwen, 2005). However—
and perhaps more importantly for a discussion of its impact on the nonprofit sector—
neoliberalism cannot be understood as simply an economic model, as its reach has extended far 
beyond economic systems. Rather, it is better understood as a set of economic, political, cultural, 
and social values, an ideology that has seeped deeply into all aspects of economic, political and 

10 
social life both nationally and globally (Saad-Filho & Johnston, 2005). The consequences have 
been widespread, resulting in what McChesney (1999) refers to as “a depoliticized citizenry 
marked by apathy and cynicism” (p. 10) as well as increased and persistent economic and social 
inequality due to increased concentration of power and wealth among elite groups and entities 
both nationally and globally (McCheseney, 1999; Saad-Filho & Johnston, 2005).  
 
With respect to the nonprofit sector in the United States specifically, Neoliberalism as 
both an economic model and an ideology is viewed as having has had a precise and lasting 
impact on the role nonprofits play in our society, as well as how these organizations are able to 
conduct themselves (Eikenberry, 2009). This is most notably observed in the devolution of state 
provided services to vulnerable populations that began in the 1980s under the Reagan 
Administration, the privatization of state enterprises, and of particular importance, the 
institutionalization of the logic of the New Public Management (NPM) model (Alexander, 1999, 
MacEwan, 2005).  
 
The New Public Management, which will be explored in depth in a subsequent section, is 
a reform movement characterized by three primary ideas: the efficiency of the market, the 
expediency of for-profit sector practices, technologies, and ideologies above all else, and the 
notion that management is a generic practice that can be universally applied regardless of setting 
(Crouch, 2011; Kaboolian, 1998). While the devolution of state provided services is significant 
to understanding the nonprofit sector as it currently exists, the onset of the New Public 
Management model is equally relevant in trying to better understand how nonprofits have 
become more “business-like” in structure and function. Given the focus of this research on this 
specific line of inquiry, the emphasis of this dissertation is on exploring how the New Public 

11 
Management has affected organizations, with particular attention paid to the impact of this trend 
on organizations. 
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 
The New Public Management Model (NPM) 
The institutionalization of for-profit, market-oriented management strategies and 
practices by SJNOs is symptomatic of the larger trend of nonprofits of all types and sizes 
beginning to resemble for-profit entities in both structure and behavior. As Sanders and 
McClellan (2012) note, “being business-like within the nonprofit sector is heralded as a much-
needed development that will lead to more efficient use of resources, increased accountability 
and more sustainable solutions to social problems” (p.70). This general trend of nonprofits 
adopting the ways of for-profit entities has been well-documented, with the literature focusing 
predominantly on the institutional changes nonprofits, particularly human service organizations, 
have undergone since the devolution of government funded social welfare programs that began 
in the 1980s and the implementation of the NPM model (Eikenberry, 2009; Eikenberry & 
Kluver, 2004; James, 1998; Salamon, 1993; Smith and Lipsky, 1995; Tuckman, 1998; Weisbrod, 
1997; Young, 1998). Such changes are characterized by the assumption that the use of for-profit 
strategies to achieve organizational goals yields optimal results (Alexander, 1999), and a primary 
focus of this literature has been on how nonprofit organizations have become more competitive 
in nature due to the increased reliance on revenue generation from government contracts or 
profit-generating activities.  
Strategies such as an increased focus on revenue generation and profitability, an 
emphasis on increasing efficiency through the maximization of resources, the implementation of 
concrete measurement systems designed to increase accountability, and the institutionalization of 

12 
for-profit rhetoric and language, are rooted in the New Public Management that emerged in the 
public sphere during the 1980s. The movement to adopt the strategies of the NPM was the result 
of a new political and institutional environment that placed greater emphasis on personal 
responsibility rather than social protection (Hasenfeld, 2010) and, as Alexander (1999) observes, 
presumes that market-based strategies and practices are the most efficient and effective way to 
manage and structure nonprofit organizations. The NPM model is characterized by a number of 
central tenets derived from a market-based orientation to organizational structure and 
management. Most notably, and perhaps most important in a discussion of the use of this model 
by SJNOs, is its focus on creating more efficient and accountable organizations whose work can 
be both measured and quantified.  
The main tenets of the NPM are operationalized by nonprofits in a number of ways that 
are distinctive of the for-profit sector. Greater control over and more disciplined use of resources, 
increased focus on accountability to funders (which emphasizes outputs rather than outcomes), a 
focus on efficiency rather than effectiveness, more formalized measurement and assessment 
procedures, and an increased use of and reliance on contracting with the goal of creating a more 
competitive environment are all characteristics of the NPM, and are seen as effective ways to 
ensure a more disciplined work environment that is aimed primarily at improving the 
organization’s financial bottom line (Anheier, 2005; Alexander, Nank, & Stivers, 1999; 
Landsberg, 2004; Hasenfeld, 2010). To achieve these goals, heavy emphasis is placed on 
streamlining organizational processes and procedures with the goal of “doing more with less” 
(Alexander, Nank, & Stivers, 1999), and greater importance is placed on implementing strategies 
that focus on financial and performance management, strategic planning processes, freedom and 
flexibility to manage, and improved regulation (Gruening, 1998). Additionally, many 

13 
organizations will often turn to for-profit sector professionals to implement these strategies, 
which leads to the appointment of individuals to the organization’s board of directors and the 
hiring of executive staff who posses expertise in business but lack what Landsberg (2004) calls, 
“mission-related acumen”.  
Furthermore, the NPM assumes the logic of the market (Hasenfeld, 2010), which posits 
that larger organizations have greater capacity to serve more people than smaller organizations, 
and that increased organizational capacity translates into greater impact. In accordance with this 
perspective, growth becomes the outcome, or “profit” for which organizations often begin to 
strive, and emphasis is shifted away from the organization’s true outcome, as defined by their 
mission statement. The NPM also suggests that like for-profit companies and businesses, all 
nonprofits should desire and plan for growth. Moreover, as Drucker (1974) notes, our society has 
become made up of large organizations upon which the responsibility of all kinds of social tasks 
lies.  
When considered in the context of organizational survival, which some believe is the 
primary reason organizations turn to for-profit strategies (Young, 2005), it becomes difficult to 
argue that the processes through which the abovementioned goals are achieved are negative in 
consequence. As the authors of many nonprofit management handbooks contend, these processes 
are designed to ensure organizational survival, which is undoubtedly necessary for an 
organization to meet its goals (Connors, 1980; Drucker, 1992; Eadie,1997; Epsy, 1996; 
Fristenberg, 1996; Grayson, & Tomkins, 1984; Hardy, 1972; Herman & Heimovics, 1991; 
Pappas, 1995; Pynes, & Schrader, 1997; Unterman, & Davis, 1984; White, 1981; Young, 1984). 
Without question, nonprofits must remain in existence in order to meet their missions, and 
finding the means to do so given the financial constraints many organizations face needs to be a 

14 
top priority (Young, 2005). However, others believe that survival is different and arguably more 
complex for the nonprofit than it is for the for-profit whose primary objective is profitability and 
financial health (Landsberg, 2004). According to this view, the nonprofit’s desire and potential to 
remain in existence should not be driven by the accumulation of financial wealth, but should be 
determined instead by the goal of meeting a particular social mission. Stated differently, though 
undeniably instrumental to an organization meeting its objectives, unlike the for-profit company, 
the accumulation of financial resources is ultimately not the nonprofit’s end goal (Anheier, 
2005). Rather, it is one of the many means through which an organization gains the capacity to 
continue to work towards meeting the mission for which it exists in the first place (Landsberg, 
2004; Young, 2005).  
Consequently, nonprofits face a paradox (Landsberg, 2004).  Faced with the growing 
challenges of ensuring survival in a tumultuous and competitive financial environment plagued 
by decreased support from both government and private funders, organizations are forced to 
adopt the ways of the for-profit sector to increase their financial security in an attempt to 
guarantee the organization has the means to continue meet its mission. However, as Landsberg 
(2004) and others have noted, doing so may ultimately threaten the organization’s abilities to 
effectively meet its social mission and goals in the most effective and appropriate ways possible 
(Bush, 1992; Alexander, 1999; Alexander, Nank, & Stivers, 1999; Eikenberry 2009; Eikenberry 
& Kluver, 2004; Salamon, 2002; Young, 2005). This is particularly important when considered 
in the context of SJNOs, since these types of nonprofits hold great responsibility in helping to 
mitigate social problems and respond to the needs of vulnerable and disenfranchised populations. 
Furthermore, in the case of SJNOs specifically, the NPM presumes that organizational growth 
equally rivals the importance of securing greater social equity for disenfranchised populations. 

15 
Moreover, it assumes that SJNOs are able to grow and expand, often with little to no increase in 
resources and expenditure, while simultaneously maintaining focus on their social justice 
missions. However, despite the widespread adoption of for-profit management practices and 
behaviors by all types of nonprofits, SJNOs included, it remains unclear if such models are, in 
fact, the most effective organizational approach. 
Nonprofits Being Business-Like 
Examinations of Nonprofits Looking and Behaving Like For Profits 
Several scholars have explored the ways in which nonprofits of all types embrace these 
traditionally for-profit tendencies and perspectives2, and studies have yielded mixed results 
regarding the impact of these trends on the structure and functioning of the organizations (see, 
for example, Eikenberry, 2009; Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004; Guo, 2006; James, 1998; Sloan, 
1998; Suárez & Hwang, 2012; Shoham, Ruvio, Vigoda-Gadot, & Schwabsky, 2006; Young, 
1998). In an attempt to provide an overview of several developments influencing the ways 
nonprofits become more “business-like” in their orientations, Eikenberry and Kluver (2004) 
focus on what has come to be termed the “marketization of the nonprofit sector”.  This 
overarching movement includes four primary tendencies—the generation of commercial revenue 
by nonprofits, contract competition, the influence of new and emerging donors, and social 
entrepreneurship. Examining how nonprofits start to look and act more like for-profits from this 
perspective provides one of many entry points into this inquiry, and situates this inclination 
within a principal framework of marketization.  
Other scholars, including Salamon (1993) have focused on this concept of marketization 
to explain the business-like shift that has occurred for nonprofits. Although undoubtedly useful 
                                                        
2 Scholars have typically explored this trend through four primary frameworks: commercialization, corporatization, 
marketization, and professionalization. Each of these frameworks will be explored, in depth, in a subsequent section. 

16 
in helping to promote our understanding of some of ways in which the transition has and 
continues to occur, the framework of marketization is somewhat limiting when trying to 
understand the ways that “being business-like” is operationalized within organizations. The 
limitations of this conceptualization will be explored in greater detail in a subsequent section. 
The commercialization of the nonprofit sector is another framework commonly utilized 
by researchers (see, for example, Weisbrod, 1998) to explore the transition that nonprofits appear 
to undergo when they become more “business-like”. The prevailing definition of 
commercialization within the nonprofit sector is understood as an increase of typically 
commercial activities to generate revenue. Young (1998) utilizes this definition to explore the 
impact of this tendency on national nonprofit social service associations, while Tuckman (1998) 
uses commercialization to analyze how increased competition in markets that are now inhabited 
by both for-profit and nonprofit firms (for example, health care) potentially leads to greater 
commercialization among nonprofits, which he posits ultimately serves to alter the 
organizational form of the nonprofit organization.  
Dart’s (2004) research examining a medium-sized social service agency, an organization 
characterized as typically nonprofit due to its strong focus on mission and its pro-social values, 
has been seminal in helping to conceptualize and identify what business-like structure, form, and 
to some degree, behavior within nonprofit organizations actually looks like within a specific 
organizational context. Observations and interviews with staff members yielded the 
identification of four main areas in which nonprofits have seemingly embraced for-profit 
behaviors and market-oriented strategies—goals, service delivery, management, and rhetoric. 
Within each of these areas the organization was seen as adopting strategies or engaging in 
behaviors that were identified as explicitly rooted in a for-profit orientation to success. 

17 
According to staff members who were interviewed, organizational goals became economically 
driven, with an increased focus on revenue generation and profitability rather than effectively 
meeting the needs of the clients served by the organization. The focus of service delivery shifted 
from providing appropriate, client focused services to providing services that were both efficient 
and concretely measurable. Management also reportedly began to take a heavily results-oriented 
approach aimed at the maximization of available resources, and rhetoric typically associated with 
the for-profit sector such as referring to the organization as an entrepreneurial enterprise, or 
considering the people who utilize the services of the organization to be consumers rather than 
clients, dominated the language used by staff (Dart, 2004).  
Though somewhat limited due to the lack of comparative data, Dart’s (2004) research 
nonetheless provides a useful and concrete understanding of some of the ways that staff members 
of nonprofits perceive their organization as engaging in behaviors that aid in the organization 
becoming more “business-like” in orientation, structure, and function. The typology derived 
from this study provides a framework that helps to more clearly elucidate the specific behaviors 
that nonprofit organizations engage in as they begin to adopt a for-profit orientation to meet their 
mission and goals, and it offers a clearer picture of how the trend of adopting for-profit models 
plays out within the context of an organization. 
Critiques 
Scholars have noted the inherent challenges of non-profits adopting market-based 
orientations, and critiques, albeit limited in quantity, have focused predominantly on how for-
profit perspectives and tendencies may lead organizations away from their missions and goals 
and from their philanthropic spirit and orientation (Bush, 2004; Alexander, 1999; Alexander, et. 
al, 1999; Dart, 2004; Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004; Landsberg, 2004; Lohmann, 2007; Maier & 

18 
Meyer, 2009; Weisbrod, 1998). Eikenberry and Kluver (2004) understand this challenge as 
occurring at the macro level of civil society. As the authors note, the nonprofit sector plays a 
significant role in contributing to and maintaining a strong and active civil society—an idea that 
has been long considered a distinguishing aspect of the United States when compared with other 
developed countries, and serves as a marker of a vibrant and functioning democracy (Anheier, 
2005; de Toqueville, 2003). This is accomplished through the sector’s role as “value guardians, 
service providers and advocates, and supporters of social capital” (Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004, 
p.135). However, according to Eikenberry and Kluver (2004), when nonprofits either choose or 
are forced to embrace marketization, as the authors define it, these specific roles become 
threatened, ultimately compromising the role of civil society.   
Salamon (1993) explores this development of marketization specifically in relation to the 
American social welfare system, describing it as the “penetration of essentially market-type 
relationships into the social welfare arena” (pg. 17). These relationships, according to Salamon 
(1993) are manifest in the ways that nonprofits embrace commercial activity (also known as 
commercialization), which ultimately serves to distort the long held distinction between for-
profit and nonprofit service providers, and raises questions about who is responsible for 
providing services to those in need. 
Based on surveys and focus groups conducted with staff members of nonprofits serving 
children and youth, Alexander (1999) observed that the shift in social services from government 
agencies to private nonprofits coupled with the implementation of NPM strategies appeared to 
have a profoundly negative impact on the abilities of organizations to serve their clients in ways 
consistent with their missions. Regardless of size, specific mission, budget, or clientele, the 
majority of the staff members involved in the study reported a shift in their organizational and 

19 
management structures. This alteration was characterized by many of the NPM principles, 
including an increased focus on demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency through 
systematic and measurable outcomes, greater pressure to focus organizational priorities on the 
financial bottom line rather than effective service provision, and the implementation of complex 
administrative systems designed to track and report fiscal and programmatic accountability 
measures (Alexander, 1999). 
Despite the acknowledgment of the staff members involved in the study that such 
adaptation was necessary given the constraints of the funding climate in which the agencies 
found themselves, the larger, more established organizations were better equipped to embrace 
such changes while maintaining operations, and to navigate the challenges associated with such a 
shift. However, for the smaller community based organizations with limited budgets and staff 
capacity, adaptation was much more difficult and often resulted in the implementation of fee-for-
services or the cutting of programs entirely, as well as the need to devote more resources to the 
development administrative and management capacity and less towards service delivery. The 
data indicated that the capacities of smaller organizations to adapt were much more limited and 
consequently, many of the surveyed agencies were faced with the serious challenge of not being 
able to provide core services to the neediest of clients. As such, much of the staff expressed 
concern regarding what was seen as a compromise of mission (Alexander, 1999). 
Furthermore, staff members believed that the capacity of organizations to continue 
serving the most disadvantaged through the provision of supportive services, advocacy, 
education, and research—core practices through which many nonprofits attempt to meet their 
missions—was compromised by the onset of business-like activities. Rather than continuing to 
concentrate on the enhancement of these core practices and meeting needs of the clients served 

20 
by the organization, many agencies shifted their focus to measuring and documenting outcomes 
to demonstrate programmatic and fiscal efficiency to funders. As such, staff members of both 
small and large organizations alike felt that the adoption of more market-based, for-profit 
oriented strategies and practices greatly compromised the public service character with which 
nonprofits are often associated. However, due to resources, larger organizations were more easily 
able to adapt to the changing atmosphere (Alexander, 1999).  
 
This study (Alexander, 1999; Alexander, et. al, 1999) provides valuable preliminary 
evidence that the use of management practices and strategies derived in the for-profit sector may, 
in fact, negatively impact an organization’s abilities to maintain focus on its mission. However, 
these findings are somewhat limited due the study’s focus on staff member perceptions. While 
the experiences of the staff may provide insight into what occurred within the organization, 
conclusions cannot be drawn about what actually resulted when the organization shifted to more 
for-profit oriented practices. Additionally, when considered in the context of SJNOs, whose 
missions and goals are explicitly focused on responding to social inequity, the Alexander, et. al 
(1999) investigation is further limited by the lack of consideration of how this trend affects the 
people who are served by these organizations. Nevertheless, this study provides some initial 
insight into the potential impact of this trend, and contributes to the establishment of a 
framework for future systematic and empirically grounded explorations of this question.  
Conceptualizations of Being Business-Like in the Literature 
The term “business-like” in relation to nonprofits is a colloquial term used to describe 
how an organization resembles traditional for-profit entities, as well as a concept that has made 
its way into the research literature on nonprofit organizations in recent years (see, for example, 
Bush, 1992; Dart, 2004; Sanders & McClellan, 2014). The concept itself is of relevance because 

21 
it suggests that nonprofits, at some point, were something other than “business-like” and that a 
change in orientation has occurred. However, there is little consensus in the literature on what 
the term means in actuality, or how it is operationalized. Instead, researchers employ the concept 
as an umbrella term to denote the myriad ways that nonprofit organizations have started to 
resemble for-profits in form, structure, and behavior.  
Analyses of nonprofits looking (form and structure) and acting (behavior) more like that 
of for-profits have almost exclusively focused on four main concepts: marketization, 
commercialization, corporatization, and professionalization. These concepts are used to describe 
the ways that nonprofit organizational forms, structures, and/or behaviors have changed to more 
closely resemble for-profit entities, and despite differences in meaning and consequence, the 
terms are often conflated and used interchangeably to examine this trend. Nevertheless, research 
in these four distinct areas has contributed greatly to our understanding of the ways in which 
nonprofits have seemingly become more like for-profits in various aspects, and has provided 
rationale for explaining some of the major changes and transitions that nonprofits have 
undergone in this area over the last thirty years. However, it is also important to explore the 
distinctions between these terms—particularly in the context of this study—because with the 
exception of professionalization to some degree, all of them fail to fully explain how nonprofits 
that have become more “business-like” in orientation actually function internally. Furthermore, 
minimal insight can be gained from research in these areas on the true impact of this trend on 
organizations. Moreover, with the exception of professionalization again, it can be argued that 
these concepts place heavy emphasis on understanding the changes in organizational structure 
and form that have taken place, rather than actual the actual of practices and behaviors of 
nonprofits.  Consequently, such analyses are seemingly limited in their utility when trying to 

22 
explore the actual “business-like” practices that nonprofits have adopted, the ways in which these 
practices are operationalized within organizations, and the impact of this trend on organizational 
form and structure overall.  
Defining and Delineating the Concepts 
 
Marketization and Commercialization. 
 
 
“Marketization” and “Commercialization” are two of the most commonly employed 
terms used to describe the changing orientation of nonprofit organizations from one based on a 
system of democratic values and moral underpinnings (Eikenberry and Kluver, 2004), to one 
grounded in the principles of the market. Marketization refers specifically to the ways in which 
nonprofits adopt market-driven methods and values to guide organizational activity and behavior 
(Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004). While this term differs somewhat in its definition from 
commercialization, the two are often conflated in literature, with marketization frequently used 
to describe what others have come to define as commercialization (see, for example, Guo, 2006). 
 
Commercialization, specifically in relation to nonprofit organizations, generally signifies 
the act of engaging in the production of goods and services with the explicit intent of generating 
income/profit (Tuckman, 1998; Weisbrod, 1998). The terminology of commercialization 
emerged in the 1990s when several scholars began to explore the increased commercial activity 
of nonprofit organizations and the impact of this activity on various subsectors as well as the 
nonprofit sector as a whole. This trend was being observed initially among large nonprofit 
entities such as hospitals and universities (Weisbrod, 1998), yet the increase in commercial 
revenue generating activity has since spread to other subsectors of nonprofit organizations, 
including to large charity organizations and human service organizations (Guo, 2006; Young, 
1998).  

23 
 
Research indicates that nonprofits have turned to profit generating activities primarily 
due to a changing funding environment characterized by a decrease in government and private, 
philanthropic funding sources (Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004; Salamon, 1993). According to 
research conducted by Salamon (1999) on the commercialization of the nonprofit human services 
sector, the revenue generated from commercial activities such as fees and other profit generating 
activities increased 600% between the years of 1977 and 1966 (Salamon, 1999, cited by Guo, 
2006). This increase was accompanied by a decrease in funding from government and private 
sources.  
 
Today, commercial activity with the intent of generating revenue is commonplace among 
many types of nonprofits, regardless of organizational focus or size. These activities take many 
forms, including: generating commercial revenue through “fee for service” or “user fee” 
activities; sale of merchandise; development of alliances or collaboration with for-profit entities, 
particularly for cause-related marketing campaigns; and the formation of for-profit subsidiaries 
(Weisbrod, 1998).  
 
Several authors include the principal definition of commercialization—the production of 
goods and services with a goal of generating profit/revenue—in their overall definition of 
marketization, suggesting that commercialization is simply one aspect of a larger, overarching 
trend of nonprofit organizations embracing the principles of the market (see, for example, 
Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004; Salamon, 1993). Others embrace a broader characterization of 
marketization that encompasses commercialization, but also includes trends such as contract 
competition, the influence of new and emerging donors, and social entrepreneurship (Eikenberry 
& Kluver, 2004; Grønbjerg & Salamon, 2012). 

24 
 
In addition to having to diversify revenue sources through commercial activity such as 
those described above, organizations also find themselves in a more competitive environment 
due to the retrenchment in government funding that began in the 1980s (Alexander, 1999; 
Grønbjerg & Salamon, 2012)—a trend that continues to impact the sector today (Grønbjerg & 
Salamon, 2012). This stressed funding environment, termed devolution, is characterized by a 
decrease in governmental support to nonprofits in the form of grants to an increase in contract 
and voucher funding based predominantly on performance measurement, among other variables 
(Alexander, 1999), as well as the “collective efforts [of government] to shift responsibility for 
federal programs down to the state and local levels (Alexander, Nank, & Stivers, 1999)”. As a 
result, organizations find themselves competing with other nonprofit organizations, as well as 
with for-profit entities that have entered into the business of providing services once seen as the 
primary responsibility of government or nonprofit organizations (Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004). 
This trend is particularly evident among social/human service nonprofit sector (see, for example, 
Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004; Salamon, 1993).  
 
As Eikenberry and Kluver (2004) note, organizations are now rewarded monies based 
primarily on performance management. This tends to favor for-profits with capital that, as result, 
can both outbid and outperform non-profits. Government is also more likely, in the name of 
efficiency, to award funding or to outsource services to any organization that can “prove” their 
abilities to deliver on the investment. Furthermore, as Ryan (1999) observes, nonprofit 
organizations were once awarded government funding because of their long histories in 
providing services based on their expertise in a particular area. They were granted monies to do a 
particular job or serve a specific function because they were seen as “reputable, committed, like-
minded community institutions” (Ryan, 1999, pp. 129). However, due a greater desire for 

25 
efficiency and increased outsourcing of what were typically seen as government provided 
services, these organizations are no longer viewed as the only option, or even the most viable or 
desirable choice for governments looking to address a particular problem (Ryan, 1999).  
 
In addition to commercial revenue generation and increased competition, marketization 
also includes the influence of a new and emerging philanthropic donor base, as well as the 
development of social entrepreneurship as a new organizational form (Eikenberry & Kluver, 
2004). Individual donors who view charitable causes as business investments lead what 
Eikenberry and Kluver (2004) refer to as the “new philanthropy”. Donors that engage in this type 
of giving characterize their contributions according to several business principles, including the 
perceived return on investment (ROI) and how closely aligned their giving is with their own 
desire for results-oriented values (Pozorski, 2000, cited by Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004).  
 
Social entrepreneurship has also become a prominent idea in nonprofit research in recent 
years—one that Eikenberry and Kluver (2004) directly associate with the shift to a more 
“marketized” nonprofit sector. A proliferation of research exploring this idea has emerged in the 
nonprofit literature, however little consensus exists regarding an exact definition of social 
entrepreneurship (Dacin, Dacin & Matear, 2010). Drawing upon a definition put forth by Dees, 
Emerson, and Economy (2001), the authors define social entrepreneurship as efforts led by 
“nonprofit executives who pay attention to market forces without losing sight of their 
organizations’ missions and seek to use the language and skills of the business world to advance 
the material well-being of their members or clients” (Eikenberry & Kluver, 2004, pp. 135). This 
new organizational form, one that seeks to actively combine market based principles and 
practices with social goals and missions, represents what Dart (2004) refers to as a shift “from 
the traditional understanding of the nonprofit organization in terms of strategy, structure, norms, 

26 
and values”; a shift that “represents a radical innovation in the nonprofit sector” (pp. 411). As 
research suggests, social entrepreneurship and the social enterprises formed as a result of this 
perspective can take on a multitude of forms and embrace varying strategies (see, for example, 
Dacin, Dacin & Matear, 2010). However, the driving force behind all social all entrepreneurial 
activity remains the desire to infuse the principles and practices of the market into organizations 
whose primary purpose and goals are, in some way, socially driven.  
 
Corporatization and Professionalization. 
 
The concepts of corporatization and professionalization, although employed less in the 
literature than commercialization and marketization, are also used to describe the shift that 
nonprofits have made to more market-based orientations. While commercialization and 
marketization tend to connote changes in organizational structure and form, the terms 
corporatization and professionalization are used more to describe organizational behavior, 
particularly in relation to management practices.  
 
Academic research on the corporatization of nonprofits has focused predominantly on 
specific subsectors of the nonprofit sector, most notably healthcare and education (with an 
emphasis on hospitals and universities) (see, for example, Alexander & Weiner, 1998; Castree & 
Sparke, 2000). Although sometimes conflated with some of the other concepts described, 
corporatization in relation to nonprofits is used primarily to describe a shift in management, 
specifically as it relates to governance of organizations (governance in this sense refers explicitly 
to an organization’s board of directors).  
 
As Hodgkin (1993) points out, the eighties and nineties saw an increased push for 
nonprofit organizations to adopt a model of governance typically utilized within for-profit 
companies. However, it must be noted that significant differences exist between for-profit and 

27 
nonprofit governance models. Some of these divergences are legally dictated, while others result 
from the different value systems and organizing models that inform for-profits and nonprofits. 
As Alexander and Wiener (1998) aptly note, “The philanthropic [governance] model stresses the 
values of community participation, due process, and stewardship. The corporate model stresses 
the values of strategy development” (p.225). However, despite these differences, the corporate 
model of governance is still seen a beneficial antidote to issues such board inefficiency 
(Hodgkin, 1993); an argument that is aligned with many of the other rationales for nonprofits 
adopting for-profit models and practices.  
 
Similarly to corporatization, professionalization is a term that has been used to discuss 
the onset and implementation of management ideas and practices derived in the for-profit sector. 
Unlike corporatization however, which has tended to focus almost exclusively on organizational 
governance at the board of directors level, professionalization refers to a wider conceptualization 
of management within organizations. The literature on the professionalization of the nonprofit 
sector delineates two specific trends that have greatly affected nonprofit organizations and the 
sector as a whole: the expansion of a culture of professionalism into the sector—defined as the 
incorporation of full-time, paid personnel (particularly at the management level) with a precise 
set of credentials—and the integration values and practices that are commonly associated with 
professionalism as it relates to the for-profit sector (Hwang & Powell, 2009; Landsberg, 2004; 
Suarez, 2010). The first involves a transformation that occurred over the course of the twentieth 
century that shifted the nonprofit sector from an informal web of less rationalized (less 
formalized) organizations to that of a highly rationalized, or more formalized third sector 
(Hwang & Powell, 2009). This change signified a substantial transformation that is characterized 
by the evolution of the sector from one that consisted primarily of “informal activities and 

28 
charitable do-gooders to [one based on] highly formalized endeavors by enterprising individuals 
(Hwang & Powell, 2009, pp. 270). Organizations that once relied almost exclusively on 
volunteers to implement activities and achieve organizational goals became much more likely to 
employ paid staff members at all levels of the organization, and the demand for managerial staff 
with a specific set of expertise became both normalized and pervasive (Hwang & Powell, 2009). 
This shift was accelerated during the period of the eighties and nineties as a result of devolution 
and the introduction of the New Public Management model, among other external factors and 
institutional pressures initiated by both the for-profit and government sectors.  
 
The second trend examined in the literature on professionalization within nonprofits is 
that of organizations adopting the specific practices and strategies often seen within for-profit, 
market-driven organizations; a trend that is mostly observed in relation to organizational 
management and behavior (Hwang & Powell, 2009; Landsberg, 2004; Suarez, 2010). As several 
authors have noted, this trend often consists of an increased focus on quality of products and 
services, efficiency (defined by cost management), improved and more systematic methods to 
ensure accountability to organizational stakeholders, particularly funders, flexibility and 
willingness to adapt to changing environments, an emphasis on product and service innovation, 
and a heightened focus on profitability, market forces, and the financial bottom line (Hwang & 
Powell, 2009; Landsberg, 2004; Suarez, 2010). Of all of concepts employed to explain the ways 
that nonprofits have become more “business-like” in structure and orientation, 
professionalization in this sense comes the closest to clarifying how being “business-like” is 
actually operationalized in the every day experiences of nonprofit organizations, particularly in 
relation to organizational management and the adoption of business-models derived from the for-
profit sector (Hwang & Powell, 2009).  

29 
 
The notion of professionalization undoubtedly contributes to the development of a more 
concrete conceptualization and understanding of the ways that nonprofits exhibit for-profit 
tendencies, perhaps more so than any of the other concepts (commercialization, marketization, 
and corporatization). However, several challenges with the idea of professionalization as it 
relates to nonprofits are worth noting. First, the literature in this area remains somewhat scarce, 
with only two empirical studies systematically examining (through quantitative and qualitative 
research methods) the role and impact of professionalization on nonprofits (see, Hwang & 
Powell, 2009 & Suarez, 2010).  
 
Secondly, while the literature on professionalization delves more deeply into exploring 
the specific practices and behaviors of nonprofits than that of the research on marketization, 
commercialization, and corporatization, it still falls short in creating a exhaustive and nuanced 
picture of what the tendencies of “being business-like” looks like within organizations. Hwang 
and Powell’s (2009) study on the professionalization of nonprofits in the San Francisco Bay area 
brings us closer to a clearer understanding of this trend, but given the heterogeneity of the study 
sample in terms of organizational focus and size, it can be argued that generalizations regarding 
the role and impact of behaviors and practices ushered in as a result of increased 
professionalization are difficult to make. Finally, using a term like “professionalization” to 
describe the shift that nonprofits have undergone in recent decades implies that nonprofits are 
something other than “professional”. Professionalization is a concept adopted directly from the 
for-profit lexicon, and while it is being used simply to denote a shift to a more for-profit 
orientation, for organizations that might be considered less “professional” by definitions put 
forth above, it undermines the ways that nonprofit leaders, staff members, and volunteers engage 
in their work. Furthermore, it delegitimizes the prior practices of organizations that made the 

30 
shift towards a more professionalized orientation by indicating that a change was necessary to be 
successful.  
Managerialism: A More Effective Model for Understanding “Being Business-Like” 
 
Much knowledge has been garnered from the research on marketization, 
commercialization, corporatization and professionalization regarding the multitude of ways that 
nonprofits of all types have been influenced and transformed by models and practices derived in 
the for-profit sector. Furthermore, as the literature demonstrates, nonprofit organizations have 
had to contend with various external influences, most notably the onset of New Public 
Management model, that have had a significant impact on organizational behavior. What remains 
less clear are the specific ways in which this has occurred, the impact this has had on the 
organizations themselves, and how this affects those who work within the organizations. Despite 
the wealth of both theoretical and empirical research exploring the transformation of nonprofits 
to more for-profit orientations, there remains a lack of understanding regarding the how 
nonprofits actually operationalize specific behaviors and practices that are heavily characteristic 
of and often associated with for-profit entities.  
 
Given its explicit focus on market-driven management behaviors and practices, 
managerialism—a concept derived from public management and critical management studies 
that is heavily utilized within the European organizational literature—provides a more effective 
framework through which the behaviors that seemingly resemble for profits can be examined and 
understood (Maier and Meyer, 2009). Yet, despite its conceptual potential for analyzing and 
understanding the operationalization of the for-profit behavior of nonprofits, it has yet to take 
hold within the United States among nonprofit organizational scholars.  

31 
 
Maier and Meyer (2009) define managerialism as “the dominance of management 
practices and ideas” (p.8). Advancing this definition further, Pollitt (1990) offers a 
characterization of the concept that is particularly effective in considering the influences of this 
tendency on nonprofit organizations. He describes managerialism as, “ a set of beliefs and 
practices, at the core of which burns the seldom-tested assumption that better management will 
prove an effective solvent for a wide range of economic and social ills” (Pollitt, 1990, p.1). This 
definition is effective in understanding for-profit tendencies within the context of nonprofits for 
two reasons. First, it understands managerialism as an ideology (set of beliefs), one of the 
primary approaches that have been employed to understand this concept within the public 
management and critical management literature (Maier and Meyer, 2009). This allows us to 
conceptualize how a particular set of beliefs, in this case the conviction that for-profit principles 
and practices are the most effective, has permeated our understanding regarding how the 
nonprofit sector should function. As an ideology, managerialism consists of a set of “values, 
ideas, and beliefs about the state of the world” (Pollitt, 1990, p. 7). This includes the idea that 
social progress is achieved through continued increases in economically defined productivity, 
that management itself is not only important, but is also fundamentally positive for 
organizations, that better management is the key to better institutional performance, and, as 
Pollitt (1990) notes, “suggests that world should be a place where objectives are clear, where 
staff are highly motivated to achieve them, where close attention is given to monetary costs, 
[and] where bureaucracy and red tape are eliminated” (p.7). 3According to a managerialist 
                                                        
3 It should be noted that management, as it is being described by Pollitt (1990), is not referring to personnel 
represented by positions of power in a hierarchical organizational structure. Rather, it is being used to describe the 
structure that exists within organizations to ensure organizational functioning based upon a managerialist 
perspective.  

32 
perspective, these values are achieved through good management practices, as they are defined 
by the for-profit sector (Pollitt, 1990).  
 
Secondly, it defines the concept as a process that leads to actual practices. This, perhaps 
more so than any of the other dominant paradigms explored in the literature, enables us to better 
understand how the aforementioned ideological underpinnings of managerialism are used to 
create a set of practices and behaviors, and how these practices and behaviors are operationalized 
within nonprofit organizations. The research conducted by Dart (2004) on nonprofits being 
business-like, and the theoretical analysis of Maier and Meyer (2009), are the only explicit and 
systematic explorations of these processes. The above-mentioned “manifestations of 
managerialism” put forth by Maier and Meyer (2009) are utilized within this study to better 
conceptualize how managerialism is understood and employed within social justice nonprofits, 
and to begin to comprehend the impacts of these trends on organizational staff.  
Theoretical Approaches to Understanding the Shift Towards Managerialism 
 
Processes of organizational change like managerialism have typically been explored 
through the lens of organizational theory (see, for example, Alexander, 2000; Hwang & Powell, 
2009), an interdisciplinary field that emerged in the 1940s (Scott & Davis, 2005). Organizational 
theory has proven effective in examining the actual changes that organizations undergo, and the 
theoretical frameworks of neo-institutionalism and resource dependency theory (two specific 
organizational theories arising out of institutionalism) are particularly useful in exploring the 
why organizations experience change. Both frameworks have relevance to this study since each 
aid in increasing our understanding of the reasons behind the adoption of managerialist 
paradigms by nonprofit organizations.  

33 
 
Managerialism, a change that has occurred at both the sector-wide level as well as the 
level of individual organizations, can ultimately be characterized as a radical institutional 
change. Greenwood and Hinnings (1996) define this type of change as the process of 
organizations shifting from one model to another, a change that represents a dramatic alteration 
to the very template, or as Petteigrew (1987) desrcibes it, the dominant beliefs or ideologies, 
from which an organization typically operates. Managerialism, as it is defined and utilized in this 
study, falls under this framework of radical change because, as research has indicated, it has 
caused a significant shift in both the structure and function of nonprofit organizations. The 
reason for this change can be best understood through the lens of two theoretical perspectives: 
Neoinstitutionalism and resource dependency theory.  
A Neoinstitutionalist explanation 
 
Neoinstitutionalism tends to focus more on organizational fields or sectors rather than 
individual organizations themselves. These fields are viewed as being able to influence 
organizations through the creation of “categories of structure, action, and thought” (DiMaggio & 
Powell, 1991, p. 13; Greenwood & Hinnings, 1996). Organizational fields make up the external 
environments that individual organizations are situated within, which influence organizations to 
adopt processes and procedures that are “defined by prevailing rationalized concepts of 
organizational work and institutionalized in society (Meyer & Rowan, 1991, p.41). The adoption 
of these processes, according to Meyer and Rowan (1991) serve to increase an organization’s 
legitimacy and its chances of survival, “independent of the immediate efficacy of the acquired 
practices and procedures” (p.41).  
 
External organizational environments are comprised of several key stakeholders, or 
constituents, that define the norms by which organizations are expected to function (DiMaggio & 

34 
Powell, 1991). In the case of nonprofit organizations, these stakeholders include funders 
(government as well as private), other organizations, and the communities the organization 
serves. However, the influence of stakeholders on an organization is far from uniform. Since the 
survival of nonprofits is often predicated upon its ability to secure and maintain funding (Pfeffer 
& Salancik, 1978), the degree of influence funders have on organizations is arguably elevated, 
potentially beyond that of other stakeholders. Given the prominence that funders play in the 
existences of nonprofits, a neoinstitutionalist perspective would posit that funders, as primary 
actors in the external organizational environment, have a significant impact on determining the 
trajectory organizations can and do take and the processes and procedures that they can employ. 
 
This helps to further explain the adoption of managerialism by nonprofits, which has 
been shown not to be an organic process derived internally within organizations, but a directive 
handed down from sources present within the external environment of nonprofits. 
Neoinstitutionalism would consider this shift in practice to be the result of institutional 
isomorphic processes, which DiMaggio and Powell (1991) describe as occurring through three 
primary mechanisms: coercive isomorphism, mimetic isomorphism, and normative isomorphism. 
Although a detailed description of each of these mechanisms are beyond the scope of this 
project, a brief explanation of two of the processes—coercive and mimetic isomorphism—will 
be provided to help further drive the Neoinstitutional explanation of the adoption of 
managerialism by nonprofits.  
Coercive and Mimetic Isomorphic Processes 
 
Coercive isomorphism refers to the “formal and informal pressures exerted on 
organizations by other organizations upon which they are dependent and by cultural expectations 
in the society within which organizations function” (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991, p.67). In the 

35 
context of managerialism, it can be argued that nonprofits have experienced a certain level of 
coercive pressure, particularly from the funding sources on which they are dependent, to adapt to 
managerialist mandates. A neoinstituionalist perspective would argue that in addition to 
attempting to ensure organizational survival this process has occurred in an attempt to increase 
organizational legitimacy, which is defined by external environmental sources (Scott, 2008). 
This pressure is ultimately based on prevailing notions of acceptable organizational behavior 
embraced by external environmental actors. In this case, these pressures are directly connected to 
the directives that have been derived from the New Public Management model that has come to 
dominate the pubic sector as well as the private, for-profit sphere.  
 
The second mechanism through which organizational change may occur, mimetic 
isomorphism, is viewed as a process of adaptation resulting from a state of organizational 
uncertainty. Where mimetic isomorphic processes are at play, uncertainty leads organizations 
look for “models” upon which they can build. This is again, often with the intention of increasing 
organizational legitimacy (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991). Organizations look to others within their 
organizational fields to determine what constitutes legitimate practices and procedures, which in 
the case of nonprofits, have come to be dominated by the widespread adoption of managerialism.  
 
According to neoinstitutionalsim, the prevalence of managerialist practices, particularly 
among larger organizations with adequate and stable funding sources (Willner, 2013), may 
therefore cause less stable organizations to look toward managerialist organizations as the ideal. 
The result would be organizations changing their models to mimic other nonprofits that exhibit 
higher levels of stability and legitimacy, with the goal of increasing their own sense of stability 
and legitimacy within the greater organizational field in which they are situated. 
A Resource Dependence Theory explanation 

36 
 
An alternative explanation Neoinstitutionalism to explain the reasons for organizational 
change is Resource Dependency Theory (RDT), a theory first introduced by Pfeffer and Salancik 
in 1978. Put simply, RDT posits that survival is directly connected to an organization’s abilities 
to secure and maintain resources (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). This creates a dependency on 
external actors that ultimately limits the autonomy of an organization to pursue its desired ends. 
Thus, organizations are constrained by their resource needs, and bound to external actors that 
serve to determine the organization’s ability to survive (Froelich, 1999). Furthermore, as 
Froelich (1999) observes, nonprofits exist in an environment that is simultaneously dictated by 
the need for resources to survive and notoriously characterized by the conditions of scarcity and 
insecurity, where resources are neither stable nor guaranteed. A Resource Dependency Theory 
explanation of the widespread adoption of managerialism by nonprofits effectively explains this 
shift because it directly relates to the idea that the resource imperative “results in the adaptation 
of organizations to requirements of important resource providers” (Froelich, 1999, p.247), as 
well as the management of dependencies through methods of compliance (Pfeffer & Salancik, 
1978).  
 
Both Neoinstitutionalism and Resource Dependency Theory offer frameworks that 
provide viable explanations as to why nonprofits might adopt managerialist practices and 
behaviors, even when such shifts in models and perspectives may not seem like the most 
appropriate for an organization to meet its desired ends. However, both theories, as well as 
organizational theory more generally, prove inadequate in explicating the specific challenges of 
adopting managerialism as it relates to nonprofits broadly, and to social justice nonprofit 
organizations more specifically. Neither theory facilitates an exploration of the effects of 
managerialism on these organizations. Furthermore, they do not reveal how managerialism might 

37 
result in the maintenance of systems of power and systemic social inequality, a primary question 
with which this research is concerned. Therefore, the use of a different theoretical approach is 
needed; one recognizes the change processes organizations undergo as a result of managerialist 
imperatives, but focuses more explicitly on understanding the impact of these changes on the 
organizations, the individuals that work in them, and the missions for which the organizations 
exist.   
 
 
 
 

38 
CHAPTER 3  
RESEARCH PARADIGM 
 
One of the premises upon which this research rests is that traditional theoretical 
approaches using organizational theory, which are often employed to better understand 
organizational behavior, are ineffective as a framework for studying managerialism and its 
effects on social justice nonprofits. While organizational theory, particularly Neoinstitutionalism 
and Resources Dependency Theory, provide insight into why the managerialist shift has and 
continues to occur, neither framework adequately allows for a critical exploration of the 
experiences of staff members within organizations and how managerialism impacts their abilities 
to work within the confines of this emergent organizational structure. Furthermore, analyses of 
organizational behavior rooted in organizational theory has historically relied on more 
positivistic, quantitative approaches, which, as Alvesson and Deetz (2000) note, have a tendency 
to lead to superficial and far removed analyses of the realities of organizational practices and the 
every day experiences of the individuals of which organizations are comprised.  
 
As such, a different, more critical approach was deemed necessary. Such an approach 
allows for a more nuanced understanding of managerialism, and supports the various aspects of 
the overall inquiry, which, in addition to the primary research questions, includes an attempt to 
understand the larger social change implications of social justice organizations embracing 
managerialist tendencies. To meet these goals this dissertation employed a critical research 
paradigm, rooted specifically in a Constructivist Grounded Theory. 
Critical Research Methods 
 
The term critical research denotes a broad research paradigm consisting of various 
theoretical perspectives as well as a range of research methodologies that are concerned with 

39 
interrogating assumptions that inform beliefs and actions (Eikenberry, 2009) and “questioning 
established social orders, dominating practices, ideologies, discourses, and institutions” 
(Alvesson & Deetz, 2000, p. 1). Typically, critical research embraces and encourages the use of 
qualitative, or “interpretive” methodologies aimed at the inductive examination of how realities 
are socially constructed. This includes actively exploring how research participants make 
meaning out of experiences, ideas, and practices, and situating the participant’s perspective as 
the central focus of analysis. Although these are often the goals of qualitative research broadly, 
qualitative methods that embrace a critical orientation, particularly those within the social 
science tradition, are focused on thinking critically about one’s research inquiries through the 
lens of critical theory (Alvesson & Deetz, 2000). Citing Brookfield (1987), Alvesson and Deetz 
(2007) explain that engaging in critical research in this way requires employing a form of critical 
thinking that includes:  
“Identifying and challenging assumptions behind ordinary ways of perceiving, 
conceiving, and acting; recognizing the influence of history, culture, and social 
positioning on beliefs and actions; imaging and exploring extraordinary alternatives, ones 
that may disrupt routines and established orders; and being appropriately skeptical about 
any knowledge or solution that claims to be the only truth or alternative” 
 
This supports a critical social science research that engages in critique rather than criticism, a 
critique that fosters “an examination of social institutions, ideologies, discourses (ways of 
constructing and reasoning about the world through the use of a particular language), and forms 
of consciousness in terms of representation and domination…[and allows for the exploration of] 
if and how these constrain human imagination, autonomy, and decision making” (Alvesson & 
Deetz, 2000, p.8).  
 
Furthermore, it contributes to a research process that serves to “make the world visible” 
(Denzin, Lincoln, & Smith, 2008, p.5) through a set of interpretive practices that value 

40 
emancipatory and empowering values (Denzin, Lincoln, & Smith, 2008). Qualitative research 
methods in the critical vain explicitly serve a political purpose aimed at liberation (Lather, 2007), 
and such methods allow for the development of what Denzin, Lincoln, and Smith (2007) refer to 
as a space based on “critical, collaborative, and dialogical work” (p.5). Such a space encourages 
the break down of the researcher/participant dichotomy as well as the power dynamics that 
accompany this hierarchical relationship, and allow for the processes of critique, resistance, and 
empowerment to begin to occur (Denzin, Lincoln, & Smith, 2008). 
Rationale for Using a Critical Research Paradigm 
 
The primary objective of this research is to resituate how the phenomenon of 
managerialism as it relates to social justice nonprofits is understood by exploring the unique 
experiences of staff members throughout the organizational hierarchy. The study is specifically 
concerned with how staff members understand and ascribe meaning to the specific approaches 
and practices employed by their organizations, and the function of these practices in the work 
lives of these individuals. Through an exploration of the perspectives of staff members from 
three unique social just nonprofit organizations, it is also hoped that a better understanding of 
managerialist practices specifically will emerge, and that greater understanding of the systemic 
impact of this trend on social justice nonprofit organizations will made apparent. Given the 
nature of these objectives, a critical research approach, as described above, is deemed an 
effective alternative paradigm from which these questions can begin to be explored.  
 
By including employees from all levels of organizational staff structure, this research 
enables a more holistic understanding of the environment within which the participating 
organizations function. Furthermore, research that has explored the role and/or impact of 
managerialism on nonprofit organizations has tended to focus on executive level staff members 

41 
(Executive Directors, CEOs, etc.) or members of the governance structure (Board of Directors, 
Advisory Board Members).  This study aimed to make visible the experiences of a range of staff 
members, including staff in middle management and frontline positions. The decentralization of 
the voices of staff members outside of executive and leadership roles, despite the critical role 
they play in operationalizing the activities of an organization, contributes to the marginalization 
of the experiences of these individuals’ experiences in research. As such, a critical research 
perspective, with its focus on re-centering lesser-heard perspectives (Denzin, Lincoln, and Smith, 
2008) was considered particularly appropriate for this particular study.  
 
A secondary goal of this study was to begin to understand the implications of social 
justice organizations embracing managerialist tendencies. As Deetz and Alvesson, 2008 observe, 
a primary purpose of critical social research consists of “challenging rather than confirming that 
which is already established…disrupting rather than reproducing cultural traditions and 
conventions [and]…encouraging productive dissention rather than taking surface consensus as a 
point of departure” (p.9). This perspective aligns with the goal of trying to depart from the 
established way of conducting research in this area by providing a new perspective that 
challenges the conventions about the managerialist tendencies of nonprofits that have been 
established through research that embraces a more positivist approach. To meet these goals a 
qualitative case study informed by the theoretical insights of constructivist grounded theory was 
employed. 
Research Questions 
 
Research on managerialism and nonprofits typically falls into one of three primary 
categories: research on the causes of the phenomenon, the structures and processes by which 
organizations become more managerial, and the effects of this trend (Maier, et.al, 2016).  

42 
This dissertation is driven by the goal of better understanding managerialism within the context 
of social justice nonprofit organizations, specifically as it relates to the latter two categories. By 
examining the broader context within which social justice operates from a range of staff member 
perspectives, the study focused on a) ascertaining how managerialism emerges within the 
organizational context; b) the relationship of managerialist processes to other types of 
organizational processes and: c) understanding the impact of managerialism on staff, clients, the 
organizations more generally.  With these aims in mind, this research answers the following 
questions:  
1) What are the environmental contexts within with social justice organizations operate 
within?  
a) How does the environmental context of these organizations impact the kinds of 
approaches and practices these organizations embrace? 
b) In what ways does the environmental context contribute to the emergence and 
adoption of managerialism by SJNOS? 
2) How do the practices of social justice nonprofits align with stated organizational 
missions and goals?

CHAPTER 4  
METHODOLOGY 
Study Design 
 
To answer the identified research questions, a qualitative Case Study approach informed by 
Constructivist Grounded Theory data collection and analytical techniques will be employed. 
Constructivist Grounded Theory is, in and of itself, a qualitative methodology. However, it will be 
utilized in this research not as the primary, singular method of collecting and analyzing data, but rather as 
a theoretical and methodological perspective to inform both data collection and analysis. This will be 
done within the greater context of a Case Study approach, which is often used when a research inquiry is 
aimed at investigating a contemporary social phenomenon in depth (Yin, 2014).  
 
In addition to other empirical approaches, case study research allows for the close observation of 
a particular occurrence in its “real world” context. The method is particularly well suited to both 
exploratory research and to investigations of organizational processes (Yin, 2014), of which this study is 
both. The study will utilize a “single-embedded” case study design, which grounds several units of 
analysis within the confines of a bounded case that is further situated within a greater context (Yin, 2014) 
(see figure 1) 
 
Yin (2014) identifies several distinct circumstances under which a “single case study” design is 
an appropriate choice. This study meets two of these criteria—a “critical” case and “common” case (Yin, 
2014).  A critical case requires the case to be selected based on a set of theoretical propositions of interest. 
According to Yin (2014), “the theory should have specified a clear set of circumstances within which its 
propositions are believed to be true. The single case then can be used to determine whether the 
propositions are correct or whether some alternative set of explanations might be more relevant” (p.51). 
The research questions of interest in this study are based on the theoretical supposition that managerialism 
inhibits social justice nonprofit organizations from conducting themselves in ways that enable the 
organizations to remain true to their missions and goals, and that unintended consequences result from 
having to exist and operate within ever increasing managerialist environments. By selecting a single 

44 
embedded case study design, as described above, the study has the potential to “contribute to knowledge 
and theory building by conforming, challenging, or extending the theory” (Yin, 2014, p.51) of 
managerialism that has been put forth.  
 
Secondly, the research at hand seeks to better understand the occurrences and conditions within 
an everyday context, or what Yin (2014) refers to as a “common” rationale. This study’s focus on the 
practices and processes of social justice organizations, and how they are impacted by the broader 
organizational environment within which the organizations are situated, lends itself to this type of design. 
The “case” is thus defined as the set of organizational approaches and processes undertaken by social 
justice organizations. Embedded within the case are several units of analysis, which in this instance are 
three distinct social justice nonprofit organizations. The issue of interest, the organizational environment 
that social justice organizations are situated within, serves as the greater context within which the overall 
case is situated (see figure 1).  
Figure 1 4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A single case study with multiple embedded units of analysis allows for several levels of rich 
analysis, which also makes the design particularly suitable for this study. Data can be analyzed within 
each subunit individually, between each of the subunits, and across the subunits as a whole (Baxter &

Jack, 2008). This will prove especially useful as it will enable the researcher to examine the impact of 
managerialism from multiple levels, leading to a better understanding the intricacies and nuances of this 
trend both within and across organizations, as well as the trend overall. 
Constructivist Grounded Theory Methodology and Analysis 
 
This study utilized a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach to collecting and analyzing data, 
within the context of a Case Study. Constructivist Grounded Theory is a derivative of Grounded 
Theory—a methodology developed by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss (1976) in the field of sociology 
to provide an alternative to the use of sociological theories they believed to be ill fitted for the research 
questions and populations upon which their research focused (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). A Grounded 
Theory approach is premised on the idea that theories should ultimately be “grounded” in the data 
collected, particularly in the actions, interactions, and social processes of people rather than the a priori 
approach typically utilized by researchers in the social sciences. (Creswell, 2007). Grounded Theory is, 
therefore, not about rigorously testing preconceived theories. Instead, it focuses on “discovering” theory 
from data that has been systematically gathered and analyzed, and is rooted in gaining understanding how 
people interpret and understand their realities. The goal is not necessarily to test hypotheses. Rather, it is 
to generate hypotheses from theory that has emerged directly from data, hypotheses that can then be used 
to conduct future research (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). This is accomplished through both data collection as 
well as analysis, making Grounded Theory both a research methodology as well as a product of inquiry 
(Charmaz, 2005).  
 
Despite its focus on qualitative methods and theory generation from data, Grounded Theory, as 
Glaser and Strauss conceived of it, has often been criticized for being too prescriptive and systematic, and 
relying too heavily on positivistic approaches (Charmaz, 2005, 2006; Creswell, 2007). Consequently, 
several variations of Grounded Theory have emerged since the inception of the methodology (see, for 
example, Corbin and Strauss, 1990) to counter these criticisms, perhaps the most notable being 
Charmaz’s development Constructivist Grounded Theory (CGT).  
 

46 
 
Constructivist Grounded Theory emerged as a popular method in the fields of nursing, education, 
and psychology, and is often utilized by researchers who embrace Constructivism—a paradigm that 
rejects the notion of an objective social reality (Charmaz, 2005; Mills, et. al, 2006a). Constructivism 
implies a relativist ontological perspective along with subjectivist epistemological viewpoint (Mills, et. al, 
2006b, p.9). Ontologically, Constructivism considers reality to be a socially constructed idea that is both 
varied and numerous, and directly connected to the interpretations, experiences, and social positions of 
the participants (Guba & Lincoln, 1994). Researchers who embrace this ontological perspective believe 
that meaning is historically and socially derived. Consequently, social interactions and the role they play 
in the lives of research participants are centralized throughout the entire research process (Creswell, 
2007).  
 
Epistemologically, the researcher is repositioned “as the author of a reconstruction of experience 
and meaning” (Mills, et. al, 2006a, p.26). He or she recognizes the explicit and implicit roles he or she 
plays in the research process, and understands and takes into account the a researcher’s personal, cultural, 
social, and historical experiences shape this process from start to finish (Creswell, 2007; Mills, et. al, 
2006a). Furthermore, there is a conscious consideration of the reciprocal relationship that exists between 
the researcher and participants, who together, are participating in the “co-construction of meaning” (Mills, 
et. al, 2006b, p.9).  
 
 
There are two primary distinctions between Constructivist Grounded Theory and earlier the 
earlier iterations of the methodology put forth by Glaser and Strauss (1967) and later, Strauss and Corbin 
(1990), that are worth noting. Unlike the previous versions upon which it is built, CGT uses 
Constructivism (as described above) to inform all aspects of the data collection, analysis, and writing 
processes. This is characterized by an emphasis on the subjective rather than objective nature of reality, 
and the co-construction of knowledge that is undertaken by the researcher and his or her participants.  
 
Secondly, CGT diverges from traditional Grounded Theory in that doesn’t adhere to the notion 
that data and theories can actually be “discovered” in the ways that Glaser and Strauss’ (1967) 
methodology presumes. Rather, as Charmaz (2006) notes, the tenet of subjectivity inherent in 

47 
Constructivism dictates that researchers are “part of the world that we study and the data we collect. We 
construct our grounded theories through our past and present involvements and interactions with people, 
perspectives, and research practices” (p. 10). In other words, the researcher is not at all disconnected from 
the research subject (as is presumed in more objectively based methodologies), the reality (or realities) in 
which the research processes is situated, or his or her own subjective reality that informs the way he/she 
approaches the research process. Unlike other forms of Grounded Theory, it is the fundamental ideas that 
inform and guide the data collection and analyses processes. 
Constructivist Grounded Theory Data Collection and Analysis 
 
Like Grounded Theory, CGT relies on the idea of collecting “rich data”, which can be collected 
through a variety of methods, including ethnography, observations, intensive interviewing, textual 
analysis, or any combination of these. However, regardless of the methods used, Charmaz (2006) cautions 
against thinking about one’s choice of methods as having the ability to provide automatic insight into the 
phenomenon being observed. Rather, the method of choice simply provides a tool for the researcher to 
begin observing and understanding the phenomenon informing the research inquiry. 
 
Unlike other forms of qualitative methods, research questions and conceptual ideas of interest are 
viewed as simply a way to commence the research process. From the standpoint of CGT, these pre-
conceived ideas serve simply as points of departure. Accordingly, the goal is to use research questions to 
help develop ideas rather than limit them, and as such, concepts of interest and importance are developed 
from studying the data and engaging in various levels of analysis from the beginning of the research 
process (Charmaz, 2006).  
 
Consequently, in a study informed by CGT, the process of data collection can shift or change at 
any time based upon the ideas that are developing from the data. This does not suggest that research 
questions are discarded based upon nascent ideas, or that prior data collection methods are abandoned mid 
study. Instead, it calls for a flexible data collection plan guided by emergent concepts, one that holds the 
potential of advancing, not stifling evolving ideas and concepts (Charmaz, 2006). For example, this could 
take the form of subsequent interviews with participants that utilize interview protocols based on the data 

48 
that emerged from the first set of interviews, employing another method entirely such as observations, or 
adding an additional data analysis technique such as Situational Analysis (Clarke, 2005). 
 
In a Constructivist Grounded Theory study data collection and analysis occur simultaneously. 
The primary method of data analysis coding, or the process of categorizing and applying analytical 
meaning to data with the goal of raising data to conceptual level (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). Unlike other 
types of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, codes are not preconceived. Rather, they are formed 
through studying the data closely, a process that allows for the link between data collection and emergent 
theories to take begin to take shape (Charmaz, 2006). Coding is typically divided into two main phases: 
initial coding and focused coding. Initial coding adheres closely to the data and attempts to aid the 
researcher in viewing each piece of data in terms of actions (Charmaz, 2006). Data is coded line-by-line 
and expressed as actions, which, according to Charmaz (2006), “curbs our tendencies to make conceptual 
leaps and to adopt extant theories before we have done the necessary analytical work” (p.48) 
 
 
Focused coding is the second phase in Constructivist Grounded Theory data analysis. This stage 
is defined as “using the most significant and/or frequent earlier codes to sift through large amounts of 
data” (Charmaz, 2006, p. 57) with the goal of determining the adequacy of the codes that were developed 
during the initial coding phase. In both stages, coding is guided by analytic strategies that consist of 
asking questions and making comparisons. Asking questions of the data helps the researcher probe more 
deeply into the data, to begin to develop preliminary answers about what participants have said, and to 
think critically about and become familiarized with the data that has been collected (Corbin & Strauss, 
2008). Other data analysis techniques include memo writing and Situational Analysis. Both methods will 
be utilized in this study and explored in greater depth in a subsequent section. 
Suitability of Constructivist Grounded Theory for This Study 
 
Although a range of qualitative methodologies can be employed to explore the research questions 
with which this study is concerned, it is believed that a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach was 
especially well suited for this particular research. As Creswell (2008) observes, Grounded Theory is an 
effective approach under the following conditions: 

49 
• 
When a suitable theory does not exist to explain a particular process 
• 
When theories may be outlined in the existing literature, but the samples and populations upon 
which these theories were tested are different from the population of interest to the researcher 
• 
When existing theories do not address the variables of interest in a particular study 
• 
When a theory is “needed to explain how people are experiencing a phenomenon” (p.66)   
 
As was stated earlier, the suitability of the organizational theories typically used to understand the 
concept of managerialism and how it relates to social justice nonprofits is questionable. Although these 
theories have been effectively used to explain the organizational change that nonprofits have undergone in 
relation to managerialism, the theories do not assist in shedding light on the impact of such changes on 
the organizations themselves or the individuals who comprise the organizations. Thus, they are limited in 
helping us to understand how program level staff experience managerialism (the primary inquiry with 
which this study is concerned), and as such, constitute an acceptable reason for employing a Grounded 
Theory approach (Creswell, 2008).  
 
Moreover, Constructivist Grounded Theory is considered an applicable methodology for studies 
exploring issues of social justice, the meta-framework within which this study is ultimately situated. 
Research concerned with social justice pays close attention to issues of power, equity, equality, 
hierarchical structures, democratic processes, and individual and collective rights. An emphasis is also 
placed on understanding the centrality of the interplay of these concepts (Charmaz, 2005). Charmaz 
(2005) contends that social justice research is ultimately about “exploring tensions between complicity 
and consciousness, choice and constrain, indifference and compassion, inclusion and exclusion, poverty 
and privilege, and barriers and opportunities…[and] taking a critical stance towards actions, 
organizations, and social institutions” (p.510). Using this conceptualization of social justice research, she 
believes that Constructivist Grounded Theory, with its focus on defining latent processes as well as 
explicit actions, is particularly well suited for studies formulated in this vein. Furthermore, it allows for 
the conjoining of critical inquiry and Grounded Theory processes, which Charmaz (2005) believes 

50 
“demands going deeper into he phenomenon itself and its sustained location in the world” in unique and 
productive ways that serve to enhance both social justice research inquiries as well as Constructivist 
Grounded Theory methodology.  
Study Procedures  
 
The principal goal of this study is to better understand the role that managerialism plays in 
assisting or hindering social justice nonprofit organizations in meeting their missions and goals. By 
exploring this question from the standpoint of a range of staff members at each organizational level at 
multiple organizations, it is hoped that the study will begin to provide an empirical appraisal of how 
managerialism impacts the work social justice nonprofits overall. To begin to answer these questions, 
Case Study informed by Constructivist Grounded Theory data collection and analysis techniques will be 
conducted.  
 
The primary method of data collection was the “intensive interview”; a commonly employed data 
collection method used in qualitative research generally, and Case Study research specifically (Yin, 
2014). Interviews were conducted with staff members at each organizational level at three distinct social 
justices nonprofit organizations located within a large, metropolitan city in the United States. The data 
collection process and specific interview protocol will be discussed in a subsequent section.  
Study Sample 
 
This study employed a purposive sampling approach in order to ensure the selection of 
information-rich cases related to the phenomena of interest (Patton, 2005). Specifically, criterion 
sampling and convenient sampling methods were used. Criterion sampling consists of choosing cases 
according to a specific set of established criteria (Palinkas, Horowitz, Green, Wisdom, & Hoagwood, 
2015). This approach was used to determine which organizations would participate in the study. 
Convenience sampling, which refers to a method of sampling based on the availability of participants to 
the researcher (Palinkas, et.al, 2015), was used recruit staff members from each of the three participating 
organizations.   

51 
 
Three social justice nonprofit organizations whose annual revenues are between $5,000,000 and 
$15,000,000 (details explaining the choice of these criteria will be provided in the subsequent section) 
were selected for participation in the study. Interviews were conducted with approximately 12-15 staff 
members at each organization for a total 46 study participants. The exact number of participants varied 
depending on the total number of staff members at each organization and the dispersion of staff across 
organizational departments. In an attempt to ensure parity across the participants in each of the three 
participating organizations, an organizational assessment of each organization was conducted to 
determine all of the positions occupied, as well as the individual departments each position fell within. 
Although staff structure differed across the organizations, to ensure a degree of uniformity in analysis the 
researcher gauged for similarities among staff positions across the three organizations and grouped these 
positions according to role and responsibility, as well as staff position within the organizational hierarchy. 
Every attempt was made to ensure the types of positions were equally distributed across the organizations. 
However, interest in participating in the study was not shared equally by people across positions, and 
some organizations wound up with more of one type of staff member than others.5 
Determining Organizations to Recruit for Participation  
 
The National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), administered through the Urban Institute, 
maintains an active database of current, registered nonprofit organizations throughout the United States. 
Data is collected on organizations using the IRS 990 form, the official form nonprofits are required to 
complete to officially register with the IRS and to provide current financial information. Using the 
advanced query tool (DataWeb) from this database, the names of all of the social justice organizations in 
the city where the research was taking place were generated in order to produce a list of eligible 
organizations. To develop this list, the following criteria was inputted into the query tool:  
1) Organizations that fit the determination of a social justice nonprofit organization (outlined in 
the next section) 
                                                        
5 The following chapter provides descriptive information on each of the types of positions 
represented in the study as well as the breakdown of participants by role 

52 
 
2) Organizations with annual revenue of at least $5,000,000 to $15,000,000. 
Social Justice Classification 
 
The IRS uses the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) to classify nonprofits into 26 
major categories, with subcategories being used to further classify organizations based on organizational 
purpose, activity, or population served. Social justice nonprofit organizations are not a designated 
category under the NTEE, but instead fall under many categories, including but not limited to, Human 
Services, Health, Mental Health/Crisis Intervention, and Education.  
 
Research on nonprofits, particularly research on the for-profit tendencies of organizations 
typically analyzes specific NTEE categories, for example the study of Human Services, Health Care, or 
Educational organizations (see, for example, Young, 1998; Sloan, 1998). However, the heterogeneity of 
the nonprofit sector, both within and across categories, subsequently makes generalization of 
organizational trends difficult. Therefore, research that aspires to examine organizations whose goals are 
rooted, however narrowly or broadly, in working to achieve social justice might be better served by an 
inter-categorical approach rather than the intra-categorical approach that is currently used by nonprofit 
organizational scholars. Such an approach broadens the lens through which we understand the work of 
social justice nonprofits by creating a social justice category in and of itself, and thus, a more inclusive, 
less homogenous unit of analysis.   
 
In 2013, the researcher conducted a pilot study to examine the relationship between 
managerialism and organizational size among social justice nonprofits in the city where the research was 
taking place. Using Content Analysis, a social justice categorization, as described above, was created to 
conduct this prior research. To develop this new, less heterogeneous category of organization (the primary 
unit of analysis in the study), each of the 26 major NTEE categories, as well as the subcategories, was 
assessed to determine how well each individual category fit within the definition of social justice 
employed in the research. Primary categories under the NTEE are focused on broad areas of emphasis, 
such as Education, Health Care, and Mental Health & Crisis Intervention. The focus area of each primary 

53 
category was assessed and evaluated for its potential to include organizations that focus specifically on 
serving historically underserved or disenfranchised populations. It was determined that 17 of the 26 
primary categories met the criteria to be included in a broader social justice category. 
The NTEE breaks down primary categories further into subcategories that focus more explicitly on 
organizational function/purpose. Although some subcategories such as “Alliances and Advocacy” are 
included in each of the 26 major categories, most are specific to the primary category’s area of focus. 
Specific subcategories include “Substance Abuse Prevention” (broader category: Mental Health & Crisis 
Intervention), “Youth Violence Prevention” (broader category: Crime & Legal Related), and 
“Reproductive Health Care” (broader category: Health Care). The definitions/descriptions of each of the 
subcategories within the 17 primary categories chosen for inclusion were also carefully evaluated as well 
for their potential to include organizations whose goals/purposes/functions were to respond to social 
issues/problems or serve individuals from typically disadvantaged populations. The content analysis 
conducted on the primary categories and the subcategories resulted in a singular Social Justice category, 
which included 17 major NTEE categories and 145 subcategories.  
Organization Query 
As was done with the pilot study (Willner, 2013) the 17 major NTEE categories and 145 subcategories 
were inputted into the query tool provided by the NCCS. Additionally, an annual income classification of 
$5,000,000 to $15,000,000 was included. Once a list of organizations was produced, each was assessed 
for a working website. The purpose of this was twofold. First, organizational websites often provide a 
great deal of information about the organization and its activities, including details regarding an 
organization’s missions, visions, and goals, and procedures. (Tuckman, Chatterjee, & Muha, 2004). As 
such, working websites were important in identifying each organization’s mission and vision statement—
a necessary component to determining if each organization returned by the query is, in fact, a social 
justice nonprofit (according to the definition of SJNO employed in this study). Secondly, websites often 
provide information on organizational structure. This typically includes information about departments 

54 
and staff members, which is important in assessing the overall structure of the organization and for 
identifying staff members to participate in the study  
 
Akin to the process utilized in the 2013 pilot study (Willner, 2013) the mission and vision 
statements of each organization with a working website were carefully evaluated to ensure a social justice 
emphasis, based upon the definition of SJNOs described earlier. Organizational structure was also 
determined during this assessment. Inclusion as an SJNO required the explicit identification of the 
organization’s target population as one or more historically oppressed or disenfranchised groups based on 
race, gender, class, sexual orientation, disability status, and/or age. Organizations that did not meet these 
criteria were excluded from the final list of organizations. Furthermore, the following organizational 
structures, due to their unique funding streams and structures, were excluded: membership organizations, 
national organizations that are based in the LA area, subsidiaries of larger organizations, international 
organizations that are based in the LA area, and foundations whose primary purpose is to provide funds 
other nonprofit organizations. 
Income Justification 
 
The income parameters ($5,000,000 to $15,000,000) used to run the query are based upon 
findings from the pilot research conducted in 2013, which indicated the presence of an income threshold 
when determining the degree of managerialism exhibited by social justice nonprofits. According to the 
findings, which examined organizations in five stratified income groups, changes in practices and 
behaviors related to managerialism appeared to begin to occur within social justice nonprofits when 
monies in excess of $5,000,000 we accumulated (Willner, 2013). As was done in the pilot study, the 
income parameter will again be capped at $15,000,000. It is believed that a difference of $10,000,000 
among potential organizations will wield enough variation among organizations to enable comparative 
analysis among participants to occur during the data analysis procedures, but will not result in so much 
variation between organizations that a comparison becomes impossible6.

determines a “large” organization, income is often used, both formally and informally, as a predictor of

Organization Identification and Participant Recruitment 
 
Using the query process described, a list of viable organizations has already been generated. The 
query produced a total of 125 possible organizations. Of these, 62 were eligible for participation (see 
eligibility criteria above). A basic histogram was used to determine the variability in income distribution 
among the eligible organizations, which led to the identification of three separate income categories 
within the broader range of $5,000,000 and $15,000,000—category 1: $5,000,000-$8,000,000, category 
2: $8,000,000-$11,000,000, and category 3: $11,000,000-$15,000.000.  Participation will be limited to 
one organization from each of the three income categories for a total of three organizations.    
 
The researcher drew upon existing relationships between herself and staff members at several of 
the eligible organizations to invite study participation. This was done through email, with follow up 
phone calls made as necessary. The study was described initially via email (see Appendix A for email 
transcript), and each initial contact was explicitly informed of what participation entailed and how 
involvement might benefit the organization.  
 
For two of the three organizations the initial contact was a program level staff member with 
whom the researcher had a personal relationship. After explaining the study in detail to these staff 
members, each agreed to speak with a higher-level staff member regarding the organization’s 
participation. In one case, a staff member in the organization’s communication department who also sat 
on the organization’s leadership team granted approval. In the second instance the initial contact 
consulted with the Chief Financial Officer of the organization about participation. It was this individual 
that eventually approved the request.  
                                                                                                                                                                                   
organizational size. There is an assumption that organizations with sizable budgets (which includes revenues and 
assets) have a greater capacity to devote resources to programs (Sanders & McClellan, 2012), which includes staff 
members to maintain and implement these programs. Furthermore, it is assumed that greater financial resources 
allows for increased organizational capacity, which can often include more robust programs, or the existence of 
multiple programs. It is likely that smaller organizations that administer programs of some kind have at least one 
program level staff member. However, organizations with higher revenues, with their abilities to devote greater 
resources to program development and maintenance, may be more likely to have more developed organizational 
structures, which includes an increased number of staff members at varying levels of the organizational hierarchy.  
 

56 
 
Contact with the third organization was made through a relationship the researcher had with a 
board member at the organization. This individual connected the researcher with the Senior Program 
Administrator, who agreed to pitch the study to the CEO. A conversation between the researcher and the 
CEO was arranged, during which the researcher’s intentions in conducting research of this kind and the 
details of study were discussed. The CEO agreed to include the organization in the study. 
 
Similar approaches to recruit staff members to participate were employed at each of the 
organizations. This approach consisted of designating a “point person” who would be responsible for 
reaching out to staff members to gauge their interest in sitting for an interview. At two of the 
organizations the initial contact became the point person. In one of these cases, the researcher consulted 
with this person to determine whom she would reach out to at various levels of the organizational 
structure. Given the large size of the staff (approximately 350 employees), it was determined that this 
approach would likely yield the best results as it was not possible to reach out to every person to request 
their involvement. Potential participants were determined based on whom the point person had some kind 
of relationship with. The role of the point person as a program level staff member in the development and 
communications department meant that initial requests were made mostly of lower level and middle 
management staff. Access to the leadership and upper level staff members came only with the completion 
of a successful interview with the Development Director, who also was a member of the organization’s 
leadership team. This conversation led to introductions to other leadership team members, which 
eventually led to access to members of the executive leadership team (CEO, COO, etc.). In the majority 
of the cases the point person made an “email introduction” between the researcher and the potential 
participant. After the introduction was made interviews were scheduled with interested participants. The 
same process took place to secure interviews with leadership and executive level staff. However, in this 
case staff members who had already sat for interviews made the introductions, as they were willing to 
connect the researcher to other members of the leadership and executive teams.  
 
A similar approach was taken at the second organization where the point person was the initial 
contact. In this case recruitment took a slightly different form because the size of the staff was 

57 
dramatically smaller (approximately 40 employees). Upon receiving approval from the CFO, the point 
person used an all-staff meeting to describe the study. Staff members were given the opportunity to “sign 
up” to participate. Those who indicated being interested included contact information, which was 
eventually passed on to the researcher. Email contact was then made with each of the interested staff 
members and interviews were arranged. 
 
The point person at the third organization was the Senior Program Director. Upon receiving 
approval from the CEO, he agreed to email all of the members of the leadership team regarding the study. 
The researcher was included on these emails and a follow up email from the researcher to each of the staff 
members was sent after the initial email was sent out. The majority of the participants at this organization 
came from this initial process. In cases where the participant had staff members who reported to him or 
her, the researcher asked to be connected to these employees in order to secure more interviews. The 
remaining interviews were secured through these connections.  
Data Collection 
In-Depth Interviews 
 
The primary method of data collection for this study was intensive, semi-structured interviews 
with staff members at three social justice nonprofit organizations located in a large, metropolitan city in 
the United States. Intensive interviews are commonly employed data collection method in Case Study 
research that allows the researcher to delve deeply into a subject or an experience with an individual to 
explore actions and processes (Yin, 2014). The method is highly appropriate for an interpretive inquiry, as 
this study is (Charmaz, 2006). Although intensive interviews are not the only form of data collection 
utilized in Case Study research (Yin, 2014), when Constructivist Grounded Theory approach is utilized in 
conjunction with this methodology, interviews are often the primary source of gathering information from 
participants because of their interpretive potential (Charmaz, 2006; Creswell, 2008).   
 
To conduct the interviews, an interview protocol (see Appendix B) made up of several pre-
determined, open-ended questions was utilized to prompt participants to begin thinking about their 
experiences regarding working within the organization (DiCicco-Bloom & Crabtree, 2006). Interviews 

58 
took the form of what Yin (2014) refers to as “guided conversations rather than [highly] structured 
inquiries” (p110), a common protocol format in both Case Study research as well as studies employing a 
Constructivist Grounded Theory perspective. Although participants were asked to discuss specific topics, 
the questions were broad enough to elicit open-ended conversation and discussion (Charmaz, 2006) about 
what each participant considers important or relevant to the overall topics of discussion, allowing for a 
more interpretive inquiry and, subsequently, analysis (Charmaz, 2006). In many cases, the interviews 
began with the researcher asking the participant to describe their role at the organization, which often led 
to an open ended conversation touching on a range of topics related to their jobs and their experiences.  
 
While a primary goal of the study was to examine managerialism, participants were not asked 
about this concept specifically. Rather, questions focused on individual experiences within ant the 
environmental and organizational contexts, and were geared towards stimulating conversation about how 
participants understand the goals of their organization, how they believe their organization go about 
trying to meet these goals (organizational processes), their unique experiences as a staff member at their 
organization, and their perspectives regarding the organizational culture overall. The tenets of 
managerialism discussed in the literature review will were used loosely as sensitizing concepts (Charmaz, 
2014) during data analysis.  
Researcher Bias in Data Collection 
 
In traditional Grounded Theory methodology, researchers are warned of the dangers of placing 
preconceived ideas upon their participants through overly structured data collection methods that may 
potentially bias findings and impede the process of emergent theoretical constructs (Creswell, 2007; 
Glaser, 1978). Alternatively, a Constructivist Grounded Theory approach acknowledges that bias is 
inherent in the research process, and that it is virtually impossible to enter a research situation without a 
degree of theoretical sensitivity and preconceived hypotheses regarding the phenomenon in question. 
Thus, unlike traditional Grounded Theory approaches, attention is paid to biases that researchers bring to 
research project, and the Constructivist Grounded Theorist is encouraged to understand how these 
predispositions potentially influence the both data collection and analysis. As Charmaz (2006) observes: 

59 
Neither observer nor observed come to a scene untouched by the world. Researchers and research 
participants make assumptions about what is real, possess stocks of knowledge, occupy social statuses, 
and pursue purposes that influence their respective views and actions in the presence of each other.  
 
In the case of this study, which is about how the environmental contexts within which nonprofits 
are situated impact the experiences of staff members, the researcher holds implicit and explicit biases that 
needed to be considered. First, she brings with her a disciplinary perspective derived in the social sciences 
and honed through two specific lenses: social work and critical social science research methodology. 
Secondly, having worked as a program level staff member in numerous managerialist social justice 
nonprofit organizations, the researcher has experiential knowledge that is intrinsic to her understanding of 
the phenomenon in question. These perspectives inherently influence the all aspects of the study, and was 
incumbent upon the researcher to consider (before and during data collection and analysis) how these 
perspectives may have caused her to look for certain processes and possibilities in the data (Charmaz, 
2006).  
 
The open-ended, semi-structured nature of the interview protocol helped in combatting some of 
this bias. Questions were broad and open-ended enough to elicit unanticipated and unencumbered 
discussion (Charmaz, 2006), but focus specifically on staff members’ experiences with the goal of 
exploring the participants’ experiences with their organizations. Furthermore, consistent memo writing 
(detailed in a subsequent section) was used to encourage a constant process of reflection in relation to 
these biases and how they impacted data collection and analysis. 
Protection of Participants 
 
Staff members were informed that involvement in the study is voluntary, even if the organization 
as a whole had decided to participate. Participant’s decisions to sit for an interview were not made 
publically available, nor was any individual’s involvement, or decision to not participate, be discussed 
with any other staff within the organization. This is to ensure that no staff member experienced adverse or 
undesirable consequences as a result of their decision (Yin, 2014). Individuals who agreed to participate 
were required to complete an informed consent form before participation commenced. This occurred at 

60 
the time of the interview, before questioning began. Participants, once again, were briefed on the purpose 
of the study. They were informed of their rights as participants, which were detailed in the consent form 
(see Appendix C for copy of form). They were also provided with the researcher’s contact information as 
well as the contact information for the Office of Protection of Research Subjects at the University of 
California, Los Angeles (UCLA). 
Data Analysis Procedures 
 
Data analysis was conducted using Constructivist Grounded Theory analytic techniques, which 
included data coding and memo writing (Charmaz, 2014; Clarke, 2006). 
Coding 
 
As was previously mentioned, the primary data analysis methods employed in Constructivist 
Grounded Theory studies involves the coding of data and is divided into two stages: initial coding and 
focused coding. Each interview was recorded and transcribed by the researcher. Upon the completion of 
each transcription, the data will be entered into Dedoose, a qualitative data analysis software package 
used to organize and sort data. Using this software, analysis began with an open, line-by-line coding 
procedure. This consisted naming portions of the data using gerunds, or action words. The purpose of 
open line-by-line coding is to “stay close” to the words of the participant to ensure the researcher is not 
labeling data with any preconceived ideas or concepts that may skew the analysis further in the process 
(Charmaz, 2014). Fifteen transcripts were open coded, at which point conceptual saturation was 
beginning to occur.  
 
Upon completion of the open coding process, a process of focused coding commenced. As was 
previously mentioned, the goal of focused coding is to determine the adequacy of the codes that were 
developed during the initial coding stage. During this process, open codes were grouped according to 
conceptual and analytical similarities. This processes yielded approximately 20 focused codes that were 
applied to the entirety of the interviews.  
Memo Writing 

61 
 
In addition to coding data, the researcher engaged consistent memo writing, a signature 
Constructivist Grounded Theory analysis technique. Memos are records written by the researcher to help 
make sense of the data analysis process (Corbin & Strauss, 2008; Glaser and Strauss, 1968; Charmaz, 
2007). The process occurs at all stages of analysis, and is designed to help further analysis and stimulate 
thinking about the data. They tend to be informal pieces of writing that help the researcher to engage 
further in “open data exploration, identifying/developing the properties and dimensions of 
concepts/categories, making comparisons and asking questions, elaborating the paradigm, and developing 
an [emerging] storyline” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 118). Furthermore, they serve as a way to help the 
researcher to be come more fully engaged in the data, to further develop ideas, and hone any subsequent 
data collection that might occur (Charmaz, 2008). Additionally, memos can be written about the actual 
data collection processes (interviews, observations, etc.) as well as the analysis procedures the researcher 
is employing. Both serve as way to help the researcher refine and think analytically about conceptual 
ideas of importance to the data and the study overall (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 118). The researcher 
engaged in memo writing after each interview, and throughout the analysis process. After each transcript 
was coded thoughts regarding the data were recorded, conceptual ideas were explicated, and comparisons 
across the interviews were made when relevant. Memos were used assist the researcher make sense of the 
processes were undertaken throughout the study (Corbin & Strauss, 2008; Glaser and Strauss, 1968; 
Charmaz, 2006), to assess for potential biases in data collection and analysis, and to encourage analytical 
thinking about the data at all stages.  
Theoretical Considerations for Data Analysis 
 
Managerialism, the theoretical framework that informs this study, was applied during the data 
analysis procedures. Although it was incumbent upon the researcher to ensure that her personal bias 
(which results partly from her critical theoretical orientation) did not influence the how data analyzed, 
ideas derived managerialism was used as an analytic concept to guide the data mining process. 
Furthermore, the tenets of managerialism were used to construct a framework for understanding the 
experiences and perspectives of the participants in relation to this concept. Since managerialism partly 

62 
informs the research questions, it is appropriate to employ these ideas as a conceptual framework through 
which the data was analyzed. However, great care will be taken to ensure that utilizing this concept in the 
analysis process does not divert the researcher away from seeing other emergent ideas and frameworks 
that are being used by participants to describe their experiences.    
Validation and Reliability 
 
The concept of validity in qualitative research is defined as “a commonsense way to refer to refer 
to the correctness or credibility of a description, conclusion, explanation, interpretation, or other sort of 
account (Maxwell, 2005, p. 106). Creswell (2007) and others observe that many perspectives regarding 
how to determine validity in qualitative research exist (Maxwell, 1992). These approaches range from the 
application of positivist quantitative conceptions of validity and reliability to discounting the notion of 
validity in qualitative research entirely (Creswell, 2007).  
 
In examining the research on validity and reliability within qualitative research paradigms, 
Creswell and Miller (2000) outline several techniques (derived from other researchers) for determining 
what Lincoln and Guba (1985) refer to the “trustworthiness” of a study. The authors suggest that 
researchers utilize at least two of these techniques to control for bias throughout the research process. To 
ensure trustworthiness in this study, the researcher will take the explicit steps of clarifying her personal 
bias from the outset, and ensuring dependability/reliability through the constant documentation of all 
research procedures undertaken. 
Researcher Bias in Data Analysis Procedures 
 
Miles and Huberman (1994) discuss bias as the possibility that researchers are honing in on 
specific data that fits with his or her particular theoretical orientation or preconceived ideas about the 
participants and the phenomenon in question. As was previously stated, the researcher holds several 
biases that need to be considered and consistently addressed throughout the research process. These 
include in-depth extensive experiential knowledge of social justice nonprofit organizations as well as 
theoretical and disciplinary orientations (Critical Theory and Social Work). To ensure these biases are not 
becoming overly present in the analysis procedures, memo writing (as detailed above) will be employed. 

63 
Through this reflective process, the researcher will continuously assess the role that her preconceived 
ideas, if any, are playing in identifying themes and domains in the data. Furthermore, staying “close” to 
the data in both the initial and focused coding phases of analysis will help to ensure that the researcher is 
staying true to the experience of the participants has they were described.  
Dependability/Reliability 
 
Dependability and reliability are used in qualitative studies to determine the extent to which study 
findings can be replicated in further research. In qualitative studies, the concern is not about reliability as 
it is defined in quantitative research. Rather, the goal is to determine if the findings are consistent and 
dependable with the data collected (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). This is accomplished through constant 
documentation of the processes undertaken by the researcher, including all data collection and analysis 
procedures, as well as the observations that occur throughout these processes. To ensure dependability 
and reliability in this study, the researcher developed what Lincoln and Guba (1985) refer to as an audit 
trail. All of the processes undertaken during each stage of the study were explicitly documented. These 
records help to ensure the record of all processes undertaken, as well as the rationale for any decisions 
made during both data collection and analysis.  
Study Limitations 
 
There primary limitation inherent in this research is the bias of the researcher, who has significant 
experience working in social justice nonprofit organizations, and has developed a specific theoretical 
orientation towards examining these organizations from an empirical perspective. As such, there is a risk 
that this perspective could be too heavily relied upon in both data collection as well as data analysis 
procedures, causing a potential threat to the validity of the study. As was previously mentioned, the 
researcher took great care in addressing this limitation by consistently engaging in the reflective process, 
specifically in the form of memo writing.

CHAPTER 5 
DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS  
 
Before addressing the primary research question with which this study is concerned, 
descriptive data regarding the organizations and the staff members that participated in the study 
will be provided. A total of 43 staff members at three different urban social justice nonprofit 
organizations agreed to participate in this case study. Organizations were selected based on the 
criteria for participation outlined in chapter 4.  
 
The following section will provide detailed information on each of the three the 
organizations and the staff members from each organization who agreed to participate in the 
study. The history, the missions, organizational goals related to missions, descriptions of the 
target population, staff structure, and information regarding funding structures will be 
highlighted.7 Additionally, staff profiles will be provided. However, information that can 
possibly lead to participant identification will be omitted to ensure confidentiality.8 Descriptions 
of the four distinct organizational levels of staff that were represented in the study—frontline 
staff, middle management, low-level executive leadership and high level executive leadership—
will also be provided.  
Participating Organizations 
Homeless Outreach and Assistance Coalition (HOAC) 
 
Homeless Outreach and Assistance Coalition (HOAC) is large homeless services agency 
providing transitional and permanent housing, and supportive services to homeless individuals 
and families in the urban area where the study took place. The organization was started more 
                                                        
7 Exact mission statements and other identifying information are not provided as the organizations were 
guaranteed anonymity as a condition of participation.   
8 Pseudonyms were used to protect the identities of the organizations and the staff members who 
participated  

65 
than 30 years ago by community members concerned by the city’s growing homeless population. 
Since then, HOAC has grown into a large, multi-site homeless services provider serving 
thousands of people annually. They have become a household name within city and pride 
themselves on being known as a leader in the homeless services field.  
 
Until recently, HOAC had only existed in the immediate region where the study was 
conducted. However, increased need coupled with opportunities to expand has led the 
organization to enter into other cities wanting to provide comprehensive homeless services. As 
such, the organization has experienced rapid growth over the last five years, which is 
accompanied by more sites serving more people as well as an exponential increase in staff.  
Mission and Goals  
 
The mission and goals of the organization can best be understood as working to alleviate 
the challenges associated with homelessness, providing homeless individuals with pathways out 
of housing instability, and working to permanently end homelessness. HOAC attempts to 
accomplish this by employing a multifaceted approach that not only provides housing to 
homeless individuals and families, but also connects these individuals with supportive services to 
ensure they are successful as they transition from a life of homelessness. These services include, 
but are not limited to, case management, assistance in finding a job, access to physical and 
mental health support, assistance with accessing public benefits, and population specific services 
such as services to homeless veterans. The organization strives to tailor supportive services to the 
needs of each of the individuals they serve making their approach both individualistic and 
holistic in nature.  
Organizational Staff Structure  

66 
 
HOAC has upwards of 350 staff members. The organizational structure consists of five 
distinct hierarchical levels and is rather complex in its organization. At the top of the 
organizational chart are the Senior Management Team members, or executive leadership. 
Directly below this team is a staff of directors. These individuals are situated between the senior 
staff and middle management. For the purposes of this research these staff members are referred 
to as “high level” staff. Middle managers make up the third level and are responsible for 
transferring information between program administration staff and the directors, and are 
generally tasked with running programs at the administrative level. The fourth level consists of 
program administration staff such as program directors. Together with middle management, 
these staff members are responsible for the maintaining the every day functioning, and ensuring 
the effective administration of the organization’s program sites and services. The fifth and final 
level is made up of front-line workers such as case managers, shelter workers, street outreach 
workers, etc. These staff members are the “boots on the ground” employees and are responsible 
for directly providing services to clients on a daily basis.  
Senior Management Team 
 
The Senior Management team consists of seven senior level managers, which include a 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO), a Chief Operating Officer (COO), a Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), and several other positions. This team is responsible for the majority of decision-making 
in the organization, and sets the agenda by which the organization operates as well as the pace at 
which they attempt to achieve their goals. The executive team is broken down into two smaller 
teams, each of which have different responsibilities in helping the organization work towards 
meeting its missions and goals. “The People Team” consists of the staff members responsible for 
maintaining the services and support aspects of the organization. “The Business Team” is 

67 
comprised of staff that is responsible for building and maintaining external relationships, and 
managing the finance and compliance aspects of the organization.  
Director Level Staff 
 
A team of directors is in place to provide leadership to each of the organization’s 
programmatic and priority areas. This team consists of 15 directors managing various 
departments including overall site management, development, communications, operations, and 
population specific programs, (veterans, for example). Staff at this level report directly to one or 
more Senior Management staff members.  
Middle Management  
 
Middle management at HOAC consists mostly of Associate Directors who are 
responsible for site management and higher-level program management. These positions report 
directly to a director level staff member, and often have a team of people for which they are 
responsible, including program directors where applicable. In some cases, depending on the 
department, middle managers are directly responsible for managing frontline staff. Middle 
managers represent a critical component of HOAC’s overall staff, as they are the conduits 
between the upper and lower levels of the organizational hierarchy. Information is passed bi-
directionally through these individuals and as such, the task of maintaining organizational 
communication often falls onto these individuals.  
Program/Front-line staff 
 
Program and front-line staff make up the two lowest levels of the organizational 
structure. These individuals make up the bulk of the staff responsible for implementing programs 
and services on a daily basis. Interaction with clients happens almost exclusively through these 

68 
staff members and they are often the first and primary point of contact for clients seeking 
assistance.  
Funding  
 
HOAC’s primary source of revenue is derived from local, state, and sometimes federal 
government grants and contracts. The rest of their income comes from private giving in the form 
of grants, gifts, and other fundraising efforts. They also seek donations for in-kind goods such as 
furniture to help furnish apartments for clients. In the 2015-2016 fiscal year, the organization 
received $15,000,000 (approximate) in government grants and contracts and $7,000,000 
(approximate) from other sources, making their total revenue approximately $22,000,000. This 
represents a significant growth from the previous fiscal year when the total revenue was 
approximately $15,000,0009 
Poverty Action and Relief Center (PARC) 
 
Poverty Action and Relief Center is a multi-service agency focused on providing services 
to individuals and families living in poverty. They are located in a predominantly low-income, 
majority Latino community in the urban area where the study was conducted and have been 
serving this geographic region for almost 40 years. Started as a small volunteer effort by 
concerned citizens, PARC now serves upwards of 35,000 people per month through a range of 
programs and services. The organization is driven by volunteer power and they pride themselves 
on their abilities to keep overhead costs low through their comprehensive volunteer program.  
 
PARC provides a range of services through a variety of programs such as emergency 
food assistance, a clothing thrift store, medical services, and employment training, and 
                                                        
9 HOAC was selected to participate in the study based on their income in the fiscal year 2014-2015, during the 
time when this research began. At that time, they fell into highest income category used for study inclusion 
identified in chapter 4. In the two years following, HOAC experienced significant growth in revenue. As such, 
their revenue is currently greater than that stipulated by the study’s inclusion criteria. 

69 
educational services focused on both children and adults. All services are provided free of cost, 
although small donations are solicited from clients for those who have the ability to contribute. 
PARC is almost entirely funded through private sources such as foundation grants, individual 
gifts, and fundraising efforts. The organization does not solicit or accept any forms of 
government funding.   
Mission and Goals  
 
PARC’s mission is focused on relieving the effects of poverty on individuals and 
families. The organization accomplishes this by providing clients with immediate relief such as 
clothing and food, and by offering opportunities for people to gain skills and assistance that 
focus on achieving self-sufficiency. Services include, but are not limited to, assistance with 
understanding how to access public benefits, educational opportunities such as English Language  
and computer literacy classes, tutoring for children, employment training, and physical health 
services that include health prevention and education. In attempting to help people lift 
themselves from the bonds of poverty, PARC’s goal is to holistically provide services in ways 
that support and respect the individuals seeking assistance.   
Organizational Staff Structure  
 
With just under 30 full-time staff members, PARC’s organizational structure has less 
administrative layers, and hierarchical levels are less distinguishable than in an organization like 
HOAC. The organization has a small executive team consisting of a Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO), a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a Chief Operations Officer (CFO). Several director 
level positions report to the executive team members, including the Director of Development, the 
Director of Volunteer Programs, Director of Communications, and Director of Programming. 
These positions are not considered to be executive level positions, but they are, nevertheless, 

70 
highly administrative in nature and these staff are ultimately responsible for ensuring the smooth 
operation of a range of organizational efforts and activities. These two organizational levels 
make up the “top half” of the organizational structure.  
 
The “bottom half” of the organizational structure consists of program level staff. This 
includes middle management positions, which, at PARC, are referred to as Associate Directors. 
These individuals are directly responsible for ensuring the effective administration of programs 
and services on a daily basis. Reporting directly to staff members at the Associate Director level 
are program level staff such as coordinators for such programs as the food bank and the 
education center. Client interaction takes place this level and at the front-line staff level, which is 
made up of case managers, health services workers, and education providers. In conjunction with 
staff at the program coordination level, the majority of client interfacing occurs at these two 
levels. Volunteers are utilized throughout the entire organizational structure to provide 
everything from assistance with fundraising and communication, help with the distribution of 
emergency food, or to teach sewing classes. Approximately 5000 volunteers contribute time to 
the organization annually with many of these individuals making long-term commitments to 
volunteering PARC.  
Funding  
 
The organization does not accept any government funding in the form of grants or 
contracts. As such, all of their funding comes from individual gifts, foundation funding, and 
fundraising efforts such as the annual gala event. In the 2014-2015 fiscal year the organization 
brought in approximately $14,000,000 in private funds, include any donations provided by 
clients who utilize PARC’s services (these donations usually range from about one to five 
dollars).

Aging Well  
 
The Aging Well has been serving older adults in the city where the research was 
conducted for over 100 years. The organization operated out of one primary site until a recent 
expansion led to the opening of two additional senior services sites. Aging Well serves primarily 
low-income, non-English speaking older adults who have little support in the way of family or 
other forms of community. At each of their three sites they provide supportive and enrichment 
services in the form of daily meals, case management services, and opportunities to engage with 
other seniors through a range of activities.  
Mission and Goals  
 
Aging Well’s primary purpose is help seniors in age well and with dignity. To meet this 
goal the organization provides a range of services both in house and at other off-site locations. In 
each of the organization’s three on-site locations daily meals are served, case management is 
provided for those in need of this type of assistance, and activities such as a range of wellness 
and enrichment classes are offered. Additionally, the organization offers transportation services 
to help seniors get to and from any of the service or sites, or to appointments such as doctor’s 
visits. Through each of these services, and at all of their sites, Aging Well is striving to build 
community among seniors to promote an innovative and positive aging experience that helps 
clients to thrive in their later years. 
Organizational Staff Structure  
 
Aging Well has a Senior Management Team as well as a Leadership Team. The Senior 
Management Team consists of the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Vice 
President of Administration, and the Vice President of Programs and Services. The Leadership 
Team is made up of various directors and service administrators, which include positions such as 

72 
the Senior Director for Social Services, Site Directors, the Development Director, and the 
Director for Government Relations and Advocacy. Each staff member at the Leadership level is 
responsible for the effective administration of one or more primary areas of the organization’s 
services, and Leadership Team members report directly a member of the Senior Management 
Team. Decision-making power is mostly held within the Senior Management Team level, with 
certain members of the Leadership Team being more privy to these processes than others.  
 
Reporting to the Leadership team are various program level and/or frontline staff 
members, and the reporting structure is department/site specific. For example, certain programs 
have several layers of case management staff in place, while others have case managers reporting 
directly to a member of the Leadership Team (The Senior Director of Social Services, for 
example). Staff structures at the direct service levels are determined based on the unique needs 
and goals of each department and/or service site.  
Funding 
 
Aging Well total revenue in the 2014-2015 fiscal year reached almost $5,000,000.  The 
organization receives a considerable amount of government funding, the majority of which is in 
the form of contracts with California Department of Aging. Other sources of income include 
private funding from fundraising and donation efforts and grants from foundations. The 
organization is currently exploring ways to diversify funding by adding a fee-for-service model 
to their existing funding portfolio.  
Participating Staff Members  
 
In total, 43 staff members between the three organizations agreed to be interviewed. Six 
staff members expressed interest in participating in a follow up a conversation after the initial 
interview, which brought the total number of interviews to 49. Table 1 provides a breakdown of 

73 
the participants by staff category. Tables 2, 3 and 4 provide general information on each of the 
participants including their title/position, their level in the organizational structure, the number of 
years they have been at the organization, and any other positions previously held within the 
organization.10. Staff members are grouped according to five distinct staff level categories: 
Executive Staff, Leadership Staff, Middle Management, Program Level Staff, and Frontline 
Staff.11 When necessary, position titles have been changed or generalized to ensure 
confidentiality.  
Executive Staff 
 
The executive staff category includes commonly held executive level positions such as 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO), President, and/or Executive Director, Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Program Officer, Vice Presidents, and Deputy 
positions. These positions usually work closely with the Board of Directors to set organizational 
priorities, with the top official (CEO/President/Executive Director) reporting directly to the 
board. 
Leadership Staff 
 
Leadership staff consists of staff members who hold significant leadership roles and 
responsibility within the organization. These individuals typically report directly to one or more 
members of the Executive team. They have a responsibility to help filter the organization’s 
agenda to the lower levels of the organization, and to provide guidance in helping organizational 
                                                        
10 Some titles/Positions with have been slightly modified to ensure confidentiality of the participant.  
11 These categories are general representations of organizational staff levels, are not fully representative of all Social 
Justice Nonprofits. They were devised based on the organizations in the case study, and denote the general structure 
of the three SJNOs that participated that participated in this research. It should be noted that organizational structure 
tends to be fluid and is often adapted to individual organizational needs and priorities.   
 
 
 

74 
priorities reach fruition. Each organization in the study has a unique leadership team structure, 
but this level of the organization is typically made up of Director level positions.  
Middle Management Staff  
 
Middle managers inhabit a unique position with the organization, as they are typically 
beholden to staff both above them and below them. They often answer to leadership team 
members, but will likely have a number of staff reporting to them as well, depending on the size 
and structure of the organization. Like leadership level staff, they bear responsibility for ensuring 
organizational priorities are realized. However, middle managers often have more control over 
the execution of these priorities on a day-to-day basis. The positions are administrative in nature, 
but these individuals tend to have more access to and visibility of daily operations and, as such, 
exist in closer proximity to clients than leadership or executive staff members. While titles and 
responsibilities differ depending on the organization, middle management level often includes 
positions such as Associate Directors, Senior Program Coordinators, etc.  
Program Staff 
 
Similarly to middle management, program staff is typically responsible for the 
administration of programs, but responsibilities of these staff members may be less 
administrative and more focused on coordination of direct services. In some cases they are the 
direct line to clients, in others, they may have other front-line staff reporting to them. These staff 
members typically have a strong understanding of the organization’s programmatic activities and 
are they are responsible for the implementation of programmatic priorities.  
 
Frontline Staff 
Front line staff consist of direct service workers such as case managers, shelter workers, 
homeless outreach workers, employment specialists, and community organizers, to name a few. 

75 
These individuals have the closest, most direct connection with clients, and are responsible for 
the daily administration of services. They are often the means through which clients 
communicate to other staff members, as client contact is often limited to these staff members.

CHAPTER 6 
 RESULTS 
 
The following chapter presents findings pertaining to the first research question and the 
related two sub questions. Context for understanding the environments within which the 
participating organizations were functioning is presented (RQ1) and the role the environmental 
context plays in determining organizational approaches and practices is described (RQ1a). 
Furthermore, the ways in which managerialism emerges and operates within the participating 
organizations is examined (RQ1b). The experiences of staff members recounted in this chapter 
are drawn from first hand accounts of the interviewees as well as observations made by the 
researcher during the course of data collection (recorded in memos). 
Understanding the Environmental Context of Social Justice Nonprofits  
 
The organizational environment is defined as the internal and external elements effecting 
organizational functioning and operations, including the abilities of organizations to be 
successful (Griffin, 2017). As chapter two illustrates, the internal and external environments of 
nonprofit organizations, social justice nonprofits included, has been profoundly altered by a set 
of economic, political, and social values associated with Neoliberalism. The institutionalization 
of these values has led nonprofits to increase their focus on achieving greater efficiency and cost 
effectiveness that can be assessed through measurable and quantifiable outcomes. The role that 
Neoliberalism has played in the configuring of nonprofit activities was a sensitizing concept 
throughout the data collection, with particular attention paid to when and how informants 
described their organization engaging in managerialist tendencies.  
 
However, in adhering to the primary goal of the study of better understanding the 
environmental contexts within which organizations operate, participants were never explicitly 

80 
asked about how they experience or understand these specific sensitizing concepts. Rather, the 
majority of the interviews began with the researcher asking the participant to “tell me what you 
do here”. 
 
In beginning with this open-ended prompt, the participants were given the freedom to 
engage with the researcher in whatever ways felt comfortable. Some informants centered their 
descriptions closely on their day-to-day tasks and responsibilities. For instance, when asked to 
talk about her role, one case manager stated “My job is to identify the needs of the people that 
come into the shelter and try and connect them to the right resources to help them be successful 
in housing”. Another staff member responsible for transportation coordination described her job 
by saying,  
I do phone calls. When clients call, first thing I do if it's a new client, I check their 
eligibility. [To be] eligible for the services they must be 65 and older or any individual 
who's not 65 but disabled. The people who get chemotherapy, they're on wheelchair, they 
get dialysis. I check their eligibility and I do intake form and send them an application to 
fill it out (staff member – middle management level). 
 
Others answered this question by speaking more explicitly about how their specific job fit into 
the broader goals and missions of the organization they worked for. For example, a middle level 
manager overseeing a large program focused on food distribution explained, 
[My job is to] oversee the general chaos and create a little bit of order out of it. It's my 
job to make sure we have enough food to distribute. I started in between the economic 
downturn and the Great Recession. We found a great need for more food and we started 
getting more food in, but also found it easier to get a lot of fresh produce in because of 
course, that's stuff that might have otherwise been thrown away. Not only because it was 
easier, but because it's better food, we started transitioning into as much fresh produce as 
we can possibly offer (staff member - middle management level).  
 
When asked about his role, this participant described his job not just in terms of daily tasks, but 
also as it related to the broader goals of the program he was running.  

81 
 
Regardless of how the participants chose to explain their role, in most cases this first 
open-ended question led participants to talk not just about their individual function at the 
organization, but about their experiences in attempting to meet their goals as someone tasked 
with a specific and defined set of responsibilities. In recalling their experiences, the existence of 
two distinct organizational environments emerged—the internal environment and the external 
environment. The data indicate that these two contexts are intricately connected. However, this 
next section will focus on distinguishing between the internal and external environment to better 
understand the unique function of each and the role they play in shaping the approaches and 
practices of the organizations. The relationship between the internal and external environmental 
contexts will be further explored a subsequent section of this chapter. 
 
The internal environment. 
 
The internal environment is understood best as the immediate context within which the 
daily organizational activities take place. Staff often described this as the “culture” of the 
organization. Participants at each of the organizations alluded to their organizational cultures as 
consisting of both positive attributes that supported their success as well as challenging aspects 
that contributed to difficulties in fully achieving goals related to their specific jobs. On the 
positive end of the spectrum, participants believed that their organizations valued creating a 
space where clients were served with dignity and respect and that doing so was considered 
integral to the success of staff and the organizations overall. This was described this as taking 
place in two primary ways: supporting client well-being and supporting agentic processes among 
clients. 
 
Positive attributes of the internal environment  
 
Supporting client wellbeing  

82 
 
All of the staff believed that their primary role was to make a positive difference in the 
lives of clients. Regardless of position, their primary goal was always seen as supporting client 
wellbeing. This occurred in a variety of ways, and was dependent upon the individual’s role 
within the organization. For one staff member, the language the organization used to talk about 
clients and their experiences was really important in providing services that supported the 
upholding of dignity and respect for the people the organization served. This individual’s 
previous workplace supported what she described as a “rich recovery-oriented psycho-social 
kind of environment” and in her role as a middle manager she worked very hard to instill this at 
her current organization. She explained, 
We talk about the use of language and how important it is. I don’t like to say we housed 
people, which is so common. I like to say we helped people find a home. As much as we 
can limit the use of [the term] clients or us versus them…I want [staff] to do that.  
 
She goes on to say,  
We serve people. We don’t manage people. I hate [the term] case management, even 
though we have to use it…I don’t allow there to be a staff bathroom in the shelter and a 
client bathroom. If it’s not clean enough for you then it’s not clean enough for them (staff 
member – middle management level). 
 
For this staff member, creating an environment focused on helping people through challenges, 
rather than seeing the population as challenging, was vital to continuing to be able to support the 
wellbeing of the people served. In describing her efforts to instill this type of approach among 
her staff she explained, “…staff aren’t aloud to say, “Oh, that person can’t be helped”. It’s like, 
“no, you just haven’t figured out a way yet.” For her, making sure she reinforced an environment 
where staff felt empowered to creatively figure out ways to support clients was paramount.  
 
For another participant, a member of leadership, viewing the work of his organization as 
social justice work was an important part of the type of environment he wanted to foster. He 

83 
believed social justice needed to be an inherent part of the agency and that serving people from 
this perspective was critical to supporting an environment focused on helping older adults in 
ways that promoted dignity. He explained that although the organization does not engage in 
activities that are typically viewed as social justice, community organizing for example, social 
justice is at the “core” of the organization. 
Our mission is to help older adults survive, stay healthy, [and] stay independent. And so 
we believe that…as a way of improving their lives and improving the community…that 
is social justice, and that’s what we’re all about. We may not speak of it that way, but the 
core of it really is, these older adults should be treated better and, by God, we’re going to 
do it (senior staff member-executive staff level). 
 
 
Supporting agentic processes among clients  
 
Participants also described the ways that they were committed to creating an environment 
where clients were supported in developing personal agency. For many of the staff members, 
particularly those who worked in program or frontline positions, constructing a space where 
clients were not just provided with services, but were supported as individuals with unique 
needs, was very important. Additionally, many talked about how this was not just part of their 
individual approach to the work, but that it was important for the organization to encourage the 
maintenance of an organizational environment where supporting agentic processes among clients 
was considered critical to success.  
 
In most cases, and despite any challenges that they may have faced in their work, 
participants believed their organizations were successful at building an environment that 
encouraged this type of interaction between staff and clients. For example, in describing her 
experience working with a client, one staff member recalled,  
…a homeless client came in and volunteered with me. And he was saying it took him a 
long time to come in because he was so ashamed to come in and say he needed help. But 
once he came in, and he realized that there was no shame to asking for help, that everyone 
that he met made him feel so welcome, and which thank God we did. But part of that, is 

84 
not treating clients like they're less than. That just because they're in need, that somehow 
they're less…In asking them to contribute, whether it's through volunteer service, or 50 
cents, or whatever they can give, it’s recognizing that they're still an equal. Equal to each 
other, equal to us whether we're on one side or the other of the service table (staff member 
- leadership staff level).  
 
In addition to ensuring that clients are treated with high levels of dignity, this particular example 
illustrates how staff members work to support clients in developing and exerting their agency, 
despite experiencing challenges such as homelessness. By encouraging the individual to 
participate in the programs in any way he could, a process of self-determination was able to 
occur for this client. For this staff member, it felt particularly important to encourage this, and to 
create an environment where despite the range of challenges people faced, clients had the 
opportunity, and felt comfortable, contributing to the overall work of the organization.  
 
In another instance, a middle management staff member explained that he believed the 
role of the organization was to create an environment where clients not only felt comfortable 
seeking services, but one where they could learn to care for and serve themselves in ways that 
were empowering. He explained,  
…one of the things that we try to do is not just teach them... Not just give them fish, but 
teach them. So to empower them, too…we have classes that really teach them how to 
manage their chronic diseases, or memory issues that they might be having…they learn 
[that] you have to play a role in the care of yourself. Whether it's taking your medication, 
whether it's having conversations with your doctor, or whether it's when you're going 
through case management…the idea is they push them to be part of the solution. Not just, 
"We're gonna do this for you, all you have to do is sit down, and we're gonna do 
everything for you." No. Part of it is, "We want you to also be a part of this. It's a care 
plan," that "We're partners in this, it's not just we're gonna do everything for you. We 
have a role, but you also have a role. So together, we're going to get to where we need to 
get for you”…the idea is to empower the client (staff member – middle management). 
 

85 
This person in particular believed that in his middle management role that he had a responsibility 
to helping to advance an environment where staff valued their role in helping clients to develop a 
sense of personal agency, and where they felt capable to do so.  
 
Challenging attributes of the internal environment  
 
Although staff members believed there were many positive aspects to their organizational 
environments, they also described the internal environment as one where barriers to success were 
common. Many explained that despite serving clients in ways that promote well-being and 
personal agency, they perceived several barriers within the organizational environment that 
sometimes hindered them from providing services in the ways they believed were in the best 
interest of the clients. Although these barriers were felt at the individual staff level, they were 
seen as contributing to an environment in which difficulty often became the norm rather than the 
exception.  
 
The data revealed four primary challenges that staff experienced as encumbering their 
success. These challenges included: 1) Experiencing disconnect; 2) Feeling disenfranchised in 
role; 3) Lacking control; 4) Lacking clarity. In many cases, the challenges were often related to 
one another, meaning that the experience of one type of difficulty often preceded the onset of 
another type, or there was an interdependent relationship existing between the challenges that 
were described.  
 
Experiencing disconnect  
  
One of the primary challenges faced by participants centered on the experience of 
disconnect. This was experienced in two primary forms: disconnect from other staff and 
members of leadership, from organizational processes and decision-making, or both. 
Furthermore, it was often acknowledged, particularly by leadership or executive level staff 

86 
members, that this was a pervasive problem throughout the organizations and, in some cases, 
proved to be consequential to the organization’s abilities to meet fully meet their goals.  
 
The first way in which staff felt disconnected was from other staff members. This most 
notably occurred between frontline and program level staff and leadership and/or executive level 
staff. A case manager at HOAC described her organization as existing in “silos”, which she 
believed was an intentional action on the part of leadership. She did not feel that leadership 
valued the interdepartmental transmission of information or that it was seen as an important 
process for the organization to engage in. While she understood these silos as somewhat 
necessary for helping to keep order in her rapidly expanding organization, she believed that the 
leadership of the organization actively intended to create a certain type of “corporate culture” 
based on separation and status. She described this as a mandate coming from the CEO, who she 
had never met but who she understood to be well-revered, particularly by the board of directors. 
She had had minimal interaction with him, and when she did have the opportunity to meet him, 
she described the encounter by saying, “he wouldn’t shake my hand…I could just tell that we 
weren’t going to engage like that”.  
 
This participant continued by saying that the CEO and other members of the leadership 
team do not really have an interest in what goes on in the organization on a day-to-day basis, nor 
do they appear to be concerned when program level operations are not going as well as they 
could or should be. She went on to say: 
I think as long as the building isn’t on fire and we’re not on the nine o’clock news, the 
people at the top don’t care what’s happening.. If they don’t have to hear about it, as long 
as all they hear is positive…[that] the goals are met…they don’t want to hear about the 
day to day…the nitty gritty…the challenges you face...But I would actually like you to 
know what’s happening (staff member-frontline staff level).   
 

87 
For her, this feeling of disconnect went beyond being something that was bothersome for her. 
She felt that existing in silos and limiting communication between the different levels of the 
organization posed a significant challenge, as it was not the type of environment that she 
believed supported people in being able to provide high quality services for the clients. She 
followed this up by saying, “I know [we] need more communication…[we] can’t [continue to] 
operate like this…it will ultimately lead to ruin…[they] can’t keep treating people like this, 
[they] can’t just keep putting people down…something bad will happen”. For her, this lack of 
communication stemming from disconnect between the highest staff levels and the rest of the 
staff was actively contributing to discontent that affected the quality of the work people were 
able to do.   
 
A program coordinator provided another example of the disconnect that prevailed 
between staff levels when she recounted her experiences with the board of directors at PARC. 
Although the board members are technically not staff, they hold a considerable amount of 
decision-making power within the organization and, thus, wield a great deal of power overall. 
For this participant, not only did she feel physically disconnected from the board, she believed 
them to be fundamentally disengaged from the work of her program. She believed the long-term 
investment required to help the children in PARC’s education programs to be successful was 
seen as by the board as deterrent to their involvement. In other words, since education programs 
do not necessarily yield immediate results in the ways that providing food through a food bank 
does, she felt that board members were not necessarily interested in learning about her program 
or being involved in a volunteer capacity (she discussed how board members contributed their 
time through volunteering with PARC’s food assistance program, for example). She continued to 
describe this disengagement by saying: 

88 
I don’t know the board members. I see them once every two years. But I wish that they 
would…take more of an interest in Youth Services…just to see what we do day-to-day. 
‘Cause they see it once a year on a tour, they get a blurb at a meeting or something, but I 
fell like seeing is believing, and I just wish that more of them were invested in it (staff 
member-program staff level).  
 
When considering what she attributed their lack of investment to, she explained: 
People wanna see immediate results. They wanna see a three year strategic plan or your 
yearly goals. But when you’re talking about kids, you’re talking about kids that are deep 
in poverty, deep in immigration issues, deep in the worst schools in [the] school district, 
and we’re expecting them to climb out of this somehow, and that’s the long haul. That’s 
not gonna get fixed by one school supply drive…one canned food drive…I am not trying 
to downplay these things, but I feel like people [on the board] feel like “I participated in a 
food drive! Yay for me!”  But it’s like, “come fucking tutor once a week, for two months. 
And be in this with us for the long haul. Be in it with us, be in it with them.” It sucks to 
feel like the board isn’t down for that…. Because I could give a shit about the gala, about 
the fucking networking opportunities. Come and mentor these kids, because you guys are 
the professionals” (staff member - program staff level).  
 
For this participant, the physical disconnect from board members was only part of the problem. 
She felt their engagement with her program, which necessitated some level of commitment either 
through volunteering or through just understanding it better, was marginal at best. As such, she 
experienced a lack of engagement that affected her ability to navigate her role at PARC in ways 
that felt productive. She was highly committed to the children she served and the program she 
ran. However, the lack of commitment from the people who held so much decision-making 
power, who she did not feel “lead by example”, posed a significant challenge for her.  
 
In other instances, disconnect resulting from lack of communication placed staff in what 
they perceived as precarious situations. Many participants talked about being cut out of decision-
making processes that directly affected them or their programs and departments. However, this 
was not seen as simply a lack of communication, but an active effort on the part of leadership or 
executive staff members to, as one case manager referred to it, “silo” the staff, thereby stymieing 

89 
communication processes across departments and between upper and lower staff members. 
When asked about how she understood this, she explained that communication was simply not 
considered important, and that from where she sat, it seemed more important that a clear lines of 
delineation exist.  
 
In explaining the processes surrounding decisions for one of the sites at Aging Well, a 
participant in a middle management position spoke of how the process took place at the 
leadership level without including those staff members primarily responsible for implementing 
the decisions. As a middle manager in charge of running a site, being excluded from decisions 
that affected the day-to-day operations of his programs represented a challenging disconnect that 
had critical implications. He concluded that the senior level staff at Aging Well did not include 
middle managers in their decision-making processes because they simply did not deem it 
important to do so. However, this participant felt differently. For him, “If  [decisions] are 
impacting my department or my center, I think I should be part of that conversation, [it should 
not be] you guys deciding, “here’s what we came up with” or “we think this is best for your 
department”.  
 
He goes on to explain how the senior staff and other members of leadership had become 
increasingly more physically disconnected from the work that was taking place on a daily basis 
as well as the experiences of the employees. As such, they were not fully aware of the challenges 
faced by middle managers like him, who were constantly faced with mitigating lower-level 
difficulties encountered by frontline and program level staff. It was the “unrealistic expectations” 
of the daily occurrences that made him believe even more fervently that communication about 
decisions needed to be improved and that the processes needed to be more inclusive of staff 
outside of the leadership level. In describing the challenge this dynamic posed, he stated:  

90 
I think [it] hurts the organization because it affects morale…If you would’ve had that 
conversation with me, I could’ve told you, “lets do it differently”, or  “lets really think 
about this. Can we make a cut here, or do we make it in another department? What makes 
more sense? (staff member - middle management level).  
 
 
Feeling disenfranchised in role 
 
Another challenge articulated by staff, one that was often connected to the experience of 
disconnection, was that of feeling disenfranchised in their individual roles. In these instances 
participants recounted the ways in which the discordance experienced by the organization at 
varying levels led to individuals feeling deprived of agency, autonomy or the ability to be 
effectual in one’s job. This was often related to a specific process or procedure undertaken by the 
organization, or a perspective embraced by the organization more generally. Akin to the feelings 
of disconnect, the experiences of disenfranchisement described were also seen as contributing to 
significant challenges for staff in meeting the goals specific to their roles and helping the 
organization in meeting its mission.  
 
In some cases, the disenfranchisement referenced by participants took the shape of 
feeling dispensable. Despite the hard work and constant effort to meet outputs and outcomes, it 
was understood that there would always be another person willing to do the work. Therefore, 
staff felt that members of leadership did not invest in them in the ways they wanted or needed to 
be in order to do their jobs successfully, even though this individualized investment was seen as 
particularly critical given the emotionally charged and often difficult nature of the work. When 
talking about the difficulties, a program coordinator at PARC described what she believed to be 
the dispensable nature of employees in the following way:  
I feel like there’s this endless supply of people that are willing to work for no money, just 
to be part of something amazing. And so I burn out, who gives a shit. There’s like five 
other people that want [my] job (staff member-program staff level).  
 

91 
That she could easily be replaced by someone equally as passionate as her made her believe that 
she was viewed as not worth investing in on a deeper level. Another participant, a middle 
manager who also believed that there was a lack of investment in staff, specifically described the 
lack of investment in staff as a devaluation that had significant impacts on the abilities of the 
organization to meet its goals.   
I think it affects employee morale, which I think then affects the product that we put out. 
Employees need to feel wanted, valued. And so, the question is then, “When an employee 
doesn’t feel valued, do they really put forward their best effort? Can we be doing more?” 
I think the answer is yes. But again, an employee isn’t gonna do more if he doesn’t feel 
valued. So I think, in that sense, it affects our ability to really have a deeper 
impact…when 20 percent of your staff do 80 percent of the work…it might lead to 
burnout…we’ve had five positions leave…three of those were really key (staff member – 
middle management level).  
 
In this example the participant describes a devaluing process that is occurring, which, in addition 
to staff not feeling invested in, is also seen as happening because certain staff are bearing the 
burden of having to do a majority of the work. For this participant, burnout was a key factor, but 
like one of the program coordinators at PARC explained, this was not seen as a problem because 
of how easily replaceable the staff were. Furthermore, the participating middle manager whose 
experience was described above saw the devaluation of staff as having a direct impact on the 
caliber of services they were able to provide, and the organization’s “deeper impact”. Another 
front line staff member summed these challenges up by saying, “I think ultimately you can’t 
reach your goal if you don’t treat your employees as people too” (staff member-frontline staff 
level). 
 
Lacking control  
 
Experiencing a lack of control was challenge frequently described by participants, and it 
was often discussed in relation to having little power over organizational processes that affected 

92 
them and their clients, or having to rely on others to meet their goals. As a consequence of this 
lack of control, staff often felt that they had to engage in negotiation processes of sorts in order 
to manage less than desirable outcomes resulting from the decisions or processes undertaken by 
others. Furthermore, the inability to control processes was seen as a considerable barrier to being 
successful in one’s role, or in being able to help the organization work towards meeting its goals.  
 
For many staff members, frontline members in particular, the need to rely on others was 
seen as impeding the provision of the high quality services. In one example, a case manager at 
HOAC described the ways in which departments needed to work together in order to secure 
housing for a specific individual, but because of the competing demands bearing down upon 
people, working together was becoming very difficult. In this instance one case manager 
described the process of securing housing for a one client in particular as becoming increasingly 
problematic. She viewed this occurrence as resulting from staff in other departments being 
unclear about their roles, a confusion that resulted partly from an increase in responsibilities and 
the blurring of lines between departments. This blurring had occurred because the organization 
had been awarded a very large contract to serve veterans, which, at the time, was a new clientele 
focus for HOAC. The department responsible for locating housing for clients was inundated with 
having to meet the contract’s high outputs very quickly and, as such, their abilities to help other 
non-contract clients became increasingly limited. 
 
Consequently, this participant was left without many resources to find a client with a time 
sensitive situation the housing she needed, nor did she possess the required knowledge to secure 
the housing on her own. She described the department that was supposed to support her in this 
process as not just inundated, but unwilling to even acknowledge her requests for assistance. 
When asked how she understood this incident, she explained, “…that’s part of the culture [here] 

93 
people can elect to just ignore you and nobody calls them on it, and nobody above you is gonna 
correct you, ‘cause everybody has too much to do”. She continued by saying that she didn’t 
believe anyone to be intentionally acting “nefariously”, but that the nature of the work and the 
constant balancing of competing demands made it “hard to keep anybody accountable…I have 
so much to do, and other people have so much to do. And I don’t want to fault them, because I 
know we’re all working hard, and we all wear too many hats” (staff member-frontline staff 
level). The lack of control that she felt from having to rely on others whose capabilities were 
strained made her feel that she was not able to sufficiently meet her client’s needs. Although she 
vowed that she was going to do everything she could to ensure housing was acquired, she was 
not able to do so without experiencing considerable stress for both her and the client she was 
working with.  
 
In another occurrence a member of the leadership team at HOAC described how the locus 
of control sat with the individuals at the very top of the organization. Even though she was in a 
relatively high leadership role herself, because decisions about processes were micromanaged, 
she was not able to help streamline processes that she believed her level of responsibility should 
be responsible for. Small decisions that would move processes along more quickly, or could be 
streamlined for lower level staff, were required to pass through executive leadership. This 
participant was not entirely clear why she was prohibited from making smaller, more 
inconsequential decisions without engaging in consultation, but she felt it was partly result of the 
executive team members constantly being on the defensive about how they spend money or the 
manner by which they make decisions. She said:  
I think that decisions could be made at a lower level, meaning, I think some of our 
directors could make decisions13. We’re ordering backpacks for $25 dollars for our new 
                                                        
13 The directors she was referring were one organizational level below the leadership team member, who was 
in a leadership position.  

94 
staff, it’s like, “I really don’t care”…It’s not a huge purchase, to order a few 
backpacks…but it needs so many layers of approval (staff member – leadership staff 
level). 
 
When asked why she believed it required so many “layers of approval”, she remarked:  
There’s the control…and I think it’s a lot of like a cover your tush kind of thing. So when 
the directors buy something…I have to sign off on everything. So then a lot of times I’m 
asking for approval when I don’t think I should have to ask for approval (staff member – 
leadership staff level).  
 
 
Lacking clarity  
 
The final way in which participants described facing a challenge to their success was in 
the lack of clarity experienced regarding decisions, processes, or practices employed by the 
organization. In several instances, regardless of having clearly stated organizational missions and 
visions, participants described being unsure of what the goals and values of their organizations 
were in practice. Staff at multiple levels, including leadership, confronted this lack of clarity 
surrounding values. A development staff member at HOAC said, “I think [there’s] a lack of 
clarity…around…the organizational values…[even though] we’ve had a lot of discussions 
around that and what those look like”. Another staff member, a program coordinator at PARC, 
stated that she was so involved in maintaining her own program that was unclear about what the 
other goals of the organization were. In both cases, the participants saw the lack of understanding 
surrounding goals and values to be problematic to meeting the overall missions and continuing to 
move the organizations forward.   
 
For frontline and programmatic level staff, this lack of clarity was particularly 
disconcerting as it meant staff lacked tangible understanding about decisions that impacted them 
directly them on a daily basis. In describing the imminent closure of the site she worked at, one 
case manager described the sharing of information regarding the closure as a cryptic and 

95 
secretive process that no one at the site seemed privy too. She explained the closure, and the 
subsequent layoffs, as something staff only postulated about, as they were not provided any 
concrete information. However, the behavior of higher-level staff indicated to her that something 
was transpiring regarding the center. “I figured it out a month ago, that we were all getting laid 
off” she said. When she inquired about it, “no one was gonna confirm or deny that…but I was 
like, “Okay, I’m not stupid”. When asked about how this information was eventually handed 
down to center staff, she said a meeting was held but little information was provided. All they 
were told was that center operations don’t “break even”, that HOAC didn’t have the “focus or 
money to put to it” so they were going “close it and sell the land”. She concluded her explanation 
of this experience by saying, “I don’t even know what happened with the maintenance man…no 
one told him [about the closure], no one even invited him to the meeting (staff member-frontline 
staff level)”  
 
A middle management staff member at Aging Well also described a general lack of 
clarity regarding decisions and processes. When asked to describe what be believed to be reasons 
for the persistent lack of transparency, he postulated: 
I don’t know if it’s a “we know best” mentality [about] “what you need, and what’s good 
for you”, or whether it’s, “we’re too busy” or maybe, “we don’t value your opinion.” I 
don’t know, I can’t pinpoint the reason why it’s done this way. I know that all the 
leadership books tell you…the best way to get the best out of your employees is to be 
inclusive, so they understand why you decided this. So they’re part of decision making, 
so it’s just not an order, but it’s like, “I had a part in this, so…if we fail, well, I’m 
responsible for it, because I held to decide this” (staff member – middle management 
level) 
 
In this instance this participant described the how he understood the lack of clarity, and the ways 
in which he saw it affecting the staff and the organization overall. He linked this lack of 
transparency about how decisions are made to the ways in which people felt a lack of control 

96 
over their jobs and how they are often disenfranchised in their roles. In doing so, his explanation 
of the lack of understanding surrounding organizational processes explicates the ways in which 
many of the challenges faced by staff are intrinsically linked to one another. 
 
The external environment  
 
In addition to describing the internal environments of the organization, staff also 
indicated there was an external environmental context within which their organizations were 
functioning. This environment, which was often discussed in terms of the relationship the 
organization had with external stakeholders, clearly impacted the organizations overall 
functioning. According to staff members’ experiences, this relationship was predominantly based 
on the ideas of dependency and control.  
 
Being Dependent on External Stakeholders. 
 
The concept of “being dependent on external stakeholders” is a primary theme that 
emerged from interview data and analytic memos. In many cases, participants described the 
ways in which they understood the relationship the organization had with external stakeholders, 
most notably funders and policy makers, as exerting significant control over organizational 
processes and procedures. While this is often viewed as an inherent part of the structure of non-
profits given the role the external environment plays in organizational functioning (Pfeffer and 
Salancik, 1978), this relationship of dependency was frequently described by participants as 
more than just a benign consequence organizational life. Instead, this relationship was regarded 
as having a significant impact on organizational functioning, and although not explicitly 
described as the “environment” by participants, when the experiences of the staff members were 
collectively analyzed, it became clear that the organizations were operating within an 
environmental context shaped by this dependency.  

97 
 
Two distinct dimensions related to the theme of “being dependent on external 
stakeholders” were evident in the data: 1) being controlled by funding and funders and 2) 
responding to the changing landscape of the field. Together, these two dimensions of 
dependency help illumine the criticalness and complexity of the relationship between the 
organizations and external stakeholders, and construct an understanding of the type of 
environment social justice nonprofits organizations are existing within. 
 
Staff members at each of the organizations in the study described the importance of 
securing and maintaining adequate funding in order to maintain operations and organizational 
success. Although one’s position in the staff hierarchy determined the degree knowledge held 
regarding funding procedures and protocols, almost every participant understood that the ability 
of the organization to do continue to do their work was predicated on securing and maintaining 
sufficient funding. However, staff also recognized that doing so was a continual challenge and 
that organizational practices were guided by navigating this difficulty.  
 
Being controlled by funders and funding. 
 
While it is widely understood that securing funding is necessary to ensuring an 
organization’s survival, the ways in which the participants explained the role that funding plays 
was unique in that it was often described through a lens indicating an experience of dependency 
and control. Many of the participants, particularly those who worked in development 
departments or were in leadership roles, explained that the funding structures of nonprofit 
organizations are highly complex and, in some cases, are made up of many different sources. 
These include government funding sources as well as private funding sources from individual 
donors, foundations, and other smaller fundraising efforts.  Although some organizations engage 

98 
in income generating activities, for example, fee-for-service based programming, many 
organizations are primarily reliant upon grants, contracts, or gifts to support their activities.  
 
As such, these organizations are not only engaged in a relationship of dependency, but 
one ultimately characterized by control. This control is intensified by the one directional nature 
of the relationship, meaning that the organizations are dependent upon funders, not the other way 
around.  
 
In discussing the challenges his organization faces, one executive staff member whose 
primary role revolved around maintaining and supporting programming and services remarked:  
...Nonprofits [are] the recipients of the generosity of individuals, corporations, 
foundations, and government…If you have a ripple in the economic system, or a tidal 
wave in the economic system that upsets the entire market base and reduces investment, 
that ripples out through foundations. It ripples out through corporations and it can also of 
course impact the Federal budget where there’s less money to go around. If there’s less 
money to go around, nonprofits get cut. They don’t have the money. And when 
nonprofits get cut they either go out of existence, or they reduce staff, or they reduce 
services. So that becomes a very challenging environment (staff member - leadership 
staff level). 
 
 
This excerpt exemplifies the difficult reality of being controlled by funding and funders. 
The availability of funding, and the ways in which it is distributed, have a direct impact on the 
structure and functioning of organizations. For this participant, whose success as a senior 
program executive was intricately tied to understanding organizational funding needs, the 
question was not simply about providing the best possible services for the older adults served by 
his organization. It was as much about survival, which he described as challenging because 
“social service agencies are always [subject] to the vagary of funding sources”.  
 
Like this participant, participants at all staff levels were acutely aware of how 
organizational processes were connected to the relationship the organization has to both funders 
and the funding bodies providing the money, and this awareness appeared to permeate all aspects 

99 
of people’s experiences. At the program and frontline staff levels, this was often described as 
having to deal with what one participant referred to as “financial realities”. In her recount of the 
difficulties she regularly faced as a program coordinator organizing activities and events for the 
children participating in her education programs, one program coordinator explained that she 
was often told:  
There are financial realities that we just need to deal with…and we’re told that a lot...It’s 
why we can’t get busses for the kids. It’s why we can’t get a cost of living [salary] 
increase for three years…it’s disheartening (staff member - program staff level). 
 
In this instance, a shortage of financial resources is cited for the motives behind certain 
decisions. While this is not an uncommon occurrence in nonprofits where needs almost always 
exceed available resources, this provides an example how the relationship that exists between the 
organization and funding can potentially have an adverse on organizational processes. For this 
participant, being told that there wasn’t any funding for transportation for her program’s event, 
which required bussing students to the organization to participate, meant that the program was 
ultimately falling short of its meeting its goals. Not only did this threaten the success of the 
event, it also placed a significant burden on her as program coordinator. She describes the 
circumstances surrounding the event in the following way: 
…Every August we bus 240 third graders [to PARC] to get free shoes, free backpack, 
dental and vision screenings…We have this partnership with [the elementary school], 
and their principal is amazing. She makes sure that her 3rd graders and their teachers are 
free that day so they can come…[but] we don’t get funding for the buses. It’s like 
“here’s no money, here’s no fucking funding, get those kids over here. Do it, lets see 
you work” (staff member-program staff level). 
 
 
For other staff members, their understanding of organizational decision making processes 
was centered on how organizational decisions are ultimately connected to the goal securing and 
maintaining funding. When HOAC decided to add a focus on homeless veterans to their 

100 
programming priorities, this decision was understood by one case manager as being based on the 
availability of funding concentrated on serving veterans, not the capacity of the organization to 
serve the unique needs of this population. Although the organization was positioned to provide 
services to homeless veterans, this had not traditionally been a singular focus of HOAC’s work 
in the way the funding was going to require it to become. In describing the onset of the veteran 
focused programming, she said:  
HOAC wanted the money, and we jumped. Because the VA (Veteran’s Administration) 
said we’ll give you…X amount of dollars…do this for X amount of dollars. Of course, 
[HOAC would] love X amount of dollars, please give us X amount of dollars and we’ll 
do whatever it is that you ask (staff member-frontline staff level).  
 
She goes on to say, “ I feel like that’s just how HOAC operates. Give us X number of dollars and 
we’ll do whatever you say. Just like a prostitute…[but] do we have our own vision?” 
 
One of the executive level staff members focused on programming described a similar 
process when she talked about the placement of an HOAC employed case manager in the 
emergency room at a hospital to help with the triaging of homeless individuals. While she agreed 
with the need for a staff member focused on hospital-based intervention, she revealed that 
organization went about creating this position at the request of a healthcare company. There was 
little consideration for the capacity of the organization to staff the position appropriately and, as 
a result, program outcomes were extremely poor. She describes her understanding of this 
example in the following way:  
I think a lot of it was these pots of money, that didn’t really make sense, that ended up 
costing the organization in the long haul…One example was, we got $50,000 from Sanai 
Heath Corporation14 to put an individual in the emergency room. $50,000 is not enough 
for a full-time person. It’s not enough for the staff, [and] it’s not a realistic model because 
one person in the emergency room triaging individuals who are homeless, the outcomes 
were abysmal. [The] outcomes were set up too high by Sanai [and] the money was too 
                                                        
14 This is a pseudonym   

101 
low but we went for it anyway…I don’t disagree [with the effort], except for the fact that 
it has to be fully funded…I don’t just want money because there’s money (executive staff 
member – leadership staff level). 
 
The participant went on to say that certain executive staff members had a personal interest in 
“getting more into health and hospital work” as it related to homelessness, which partially drove 
the organization’s decision to partner with Sanai in this way. According to her, this desire, 
combined with the availability of funds and opportunity to obtain them, was ultimately what 
drove the decision—not a well-thought out plan based in a strategic assessment of organizational 
capacity or current priorities.  
 
Other ways that that participants indicated the organization being controlled by funding 
and funders was through the practices of appeasing funders that often took place. One participant 
expressed concern about the organization’s inclination to homogenize clients based on 
race/ethnicity, and the impact this might have had on the way staff understood the unique 
experiences of the predominantly Latino population they served. She explained: 
…the reality is, we serve so many people from so many varied backgrounds. Like, 
Mexicans are not the same as Central Americans, are not the same as South 
Americans…Mexicans are not the same as Chicanos, are not the same as Puerto Ricans. 
We are not the same and yet under that [Hispanic] umbrella we all get grouped 
into…Hispanic. We serve people that are from various indigenous groups, from various 
parts of the continent. And I felt like that should be recognized (staff member-program 
staff level).  
 
When asked why she believed the organization grouped all of these individual groups together, 
she said she understood the process to be about making funding reporting procedures as simple 
as possible for the funders. The participant remarked:  
We had a couple of talks about it in staff meetings and it was decided that simpler was 
just better. Lump everyone together…those are the only terms that are accepted [by 
funders]. You’re either Hispanic, White, Black, like, check a box (staff member - 
program staff level).  

102 
 
This process did ultimately simplify reporting procedures, but at what this participant considered 
to be the expense of the clients. She believed that for an organization serving a predominantly 
Latino clientele whose experiences were shaped by chronic poverty, issues related to 
immigration status, and other difficulties, it was important for staff to know how their 
background impacted their experiences, and that services should be developed and implemented 
with this diversity in mind. Yet, while other staff acknowledged the loss of information through 
the homogenization process described, it was determined that decisions about how clients should 
be identified in the organization’s systems should ultimately be made less complicated in order 
to appease the needs of the funders and their reporting systems, which required simplified 
processes.  
 
In another example a development staff member described how the decision of PARC to 
not apply for or accept any government funding was not based solely on the difficult reporting 
procedures that accompanied these types of funding streams but also on the desire to not alienate 
more socially conservative donors. This type of donor was common at PARC and was described 
as coming “through their church, so they’re about service, they’re about charity, and they like it 
that we’re lean and mean and so efficient”. These donors were viewed as less likely to want to 
support the organization if government funds were used to support clients, as they were 
understood by the CEO to be: 
…conservative mindsets who won’t wanna fund us because they think we’re catering 
to…the welfare mom or something…she doesn’t want to show [that we serve] a  lot of 
Latinos…especially Latinos with a lot of family members, cause it’ll piss off the 
conservative white people on our board and amongst the donors (staff member-leadership 
staff level). 
 

103 
To further explain the relationship between not accepting government funding and appeasing 
conservative donors, this participant recounted the following experience with putting together 
mailings and other materials highlighting the work of the organization:  
She doesn’t want to show a lot of Latinos, she definitely doesn’t want to show a lot of 
Latinos with a lot of family members, ‘cause it’ll piss off the conservative white people 
on our Board and amongst our donors. She’s literally said that to me ‘cause it comes off 
looking badly. So she wants black people, white people. But 75% of our clients are 
Latinos. 
 
She went on to say:  
I’ve gotten hate mail during the holidays, especially when Obama was…running for 
office. I got hate mail [in response to] my direct [mailing] saying… “How dare you spend 
money on…my taxes are going to pay for these people who are lazy and don’t deserve 
it”…they’re usually anonymous, but the few [aren’t], I usually take the opportunity to 
write them a letter saying, “I appreciate your perspective, but I want you to know that 
PARC doesn’t take government funding” (staff member-leadership staff level).  
 
In both of these examples, the organizations were seen by the participants as making the choice 
to appease donors rather than do what was best or the organization or aligned with their 
priorities, goals, or values.  
Responding to the changing landscape of the field. 
 
The relationship of dependency that organizations have with external stakeholders was 
also characterized by what many participants described as “responding to the changing landscape 
of the field”. This consisted of the organization making significant changes or engaging in 
different processes and procedures based on policy changes or initiatives and/or perceived 
developments in industry standards. This often took the shape of responding to an increased 
public awareness or outcry surrounding a particular social issue, (increased homelessness in city 
where the research was undertaken, for example), adapting to trends within the policy arena 
aimed reducing long term care costs, (for the aging population, for example), attempts at 

104 
attracting more funding, or simply responding to the growth of a field resulting from increasing 
need.  
 
In several instances, participants described the way an increase in the general public’s 
awareness about a particular social issue impacted how the organization made decisions 
regarding the type of funding to seek or the programs that should be implemented. For example, 
as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began to draw to a close, the public’s awareness of veteran 
issues increased, and providing services to the veteran population became a both a policy and 
funding priority. As a result, an influx of both public and private funding was made available to 
support veteran focused services, and organizations like HOAC were presented with 
opportunities to add veteran services to their existing repertoire of services.  
 
In the case of HOAC specifically, the Veteran’s Administration (VA) awarded a large 
contract to the organization to help upwards of 300 homeless veterans find housing in a rather 
short period of time. This contract was in direct response to the amplified public focus on the 
veteran community, whose homelessness rates were spiking at the time. As result of the contract, 
which totaled $5,000,000 dollars a year, the organization rapidly developed and implemented 
veteran specific programming, an area that had not previously been a primary organizational 
priority. The opportunity to apply for this specific source of funding from the VA effectively 
altered the boundaries of the organization’s service provision, and added a focus to the existing 
range of programmatic priorities. As one frontline level participant described it: 
We’re just not an agency that’s gonna necessarily turn things down that could potentially 
fill a gap in services that we don’t already have. The way I think of it is, I don’t want 
anyone to come into our sites and be turned away because we don’t have a program to 
serve them (staff member – frontline staff level). 
 

105 
 
Another participant, an executive staff member at HOAC whose role focused on 
programming, described the intensified concern of the public regarding issue homelessness more 
generally as contributing to an escalation in funding opportunities at the local level, which 
created more opportunities for HOAC to secure resources. She said: 
I think there’s been a greater emphasis on homeless services. A few years ago, a point-in-
time count came out and I think the world finally looked at it and said, “Oh my gosh. LA 
is the capital of homelessness”. And it gave [an] opportunity to us to be able to apply for 
funding that hadn’t been there before…There’s more county money coming in, there’s 
more city money coming in. So I think it’s had to be that place where there was an 
agency that had to take on that…and HOAC was poised to be able to do that in a way that 
a lot of the other agencies hadn’t been ready to (executive staff member – leadership staff 
level). 
 
In both of these instances, an increased public emphasis on funding homeless services 
contributed to a direct and calculated response on the part of the organization. These responses 
were viewed by participants as having a significant impact on how the organization went about 
securing resources, and the types of services that were being provided. 
 
In another example, the onset of a collaboration between the Aging Well and the 
healthcare industry was described by a member of the leadership staff as partly a response to the 
need and desire to reduce overall healthcare costs for the greater aging population. She explained 
development of this new relationship by saying: 
This population is starting to cost the [healthcare] system a heck of a lot of money just by 
the sheer aggregate number of how many people there are. Aging is a new phenomenon 
in our communities…women are living to 86 and men to 82, and that’s continuing to 
rise…the squeaky wheel gets the grease…Now this population is becoming significant 
enough…that they’re starting to [say], “Okay, we need to…figure this out”…Now that a 
quarter of our population’s gonna be over the age of 65 and we have less people coming 
into the workforce which means we have less taxes going into our system to support a 
growing population, they’re forced to start looking at these things that they have never 
had to before (staff member-leadership staff level). 
 

106 
This collaboration was focused on bringing together what this participant and others referred to 
as the “medical model” and the “social model”, the former of which is highly concerned about 
the increasing cost of serving a rapidly growing population of aging adults. The two models 
coming together to think about how to better serve the older adult population was described as 
resulting, in part, from the healthcare industry realizing:  
We have to address how people access our services, what their home life is like, what 
their social determinants of health are, so their access to food and resources and 
transportation, where they actually live. All of those things play into whether they’re 
going to be compliant with their medical issues. And the medical model is finally 
realizing that the…social [service] providers hold that piece, that’s what we do, we hold 
the relationships. The medical model doesn’t necessarily hold trusted relationships with 
the people that they’re trying to influence, but we do. So there’s been a push to bring 
these two models together because you have to address somebody’s living environment 
and their access to services if you want them to comply (staff member-leadership staff 
level). 
 
In increasing the focus on the factors that impact an individual’s ability to comply with medical 
treatment, not only are health services becoming more holistic, but money is being saved in the 
long run.  
 
Furthermore, the onset of the “medical model’s” concern with the “social model’s” 
approach to serving older adults represented what Aging Well viewed as an opportunity to secure 
greater funding for their services and to diversify the organization’s funding sources long term. 
One leadership staff member recounted, “…it’s the desire to have a better spread of funding, to 
diversify our funding sources. It’s also a national trend now. I was at a Meals on Wheels 
conference about a month ago, and big strands of the conference were about how to do business 
with the healthcare industry”. Further, the collaboration represented a prospect to increase the 
social model’s financial sustainability. Another leadership team member said: 
The realization that the two have to come together and that we just gotta figure it out 
along the way is clear because there’s so much funding that goes into the medical model, 

107 
that it could help the social model become sustainable if we could tap into that funding. 
Because what happens, if we can help them save money, now there’s more money 
available in the pot, and we can get some of that money, some of that money…paid to the 
medical model could be saved (staff member-leadership staff level).  
 
She goes on to explain that the precariousness of nonprofit funding represents a challenge for the 
security of the services they provide, despite the ever-increasing need for social services focused 
on older adults. As such, the organization understands their collaboration with the healthcare 
model as a strategic decision focused on: 
Sustainability and aligning ourselves with a funding source that is a steady funding 
source that is not going to go away over the next 50 years…where some of the programs 
that we operate here, funding comes and goes out of those program. They aren’t 
guaranteed that they’re gonna be around, but by aligning ourselves with the medical 
model, that funding’s going to be around, and they’re putting money into it…the idea is 
that we need to diversify our revenue, so one of those ways is to align ourselves with 
healthcare, and the realization that [the] healthcare [industry] is having is that “wow, 
these social [service] providers can really impact and affect the health of our seniors 
(staff member-leadership staff level). 
 
Finally, the constant increase in the need for services in all three of the fields the organizations in 
the study represent was a driving force behind each one needing to respond to the changing 
landscape of the field. One leadership team member best explained this when he remarked:  
As more and more baby-boomers come into their older adult time, 10,000 people a day 
come into Social Security and Medicare. It’s a big group and depending what they grew 
up with, what their expectations were, what their professional jobs were, they have very 
different expectations of what they might want out of life. So, it may be that the role of 
senior centers might change…the inclusion of more technology…we might see more of 
that, but certainly, I think we’re gonna see different issues and wants and needs from 
slightly changing, more tech-savvy, older adult population that starts coming though. And 
I think that’s gonna be fascinating. So, the world’s gonna be shifting and we’re hoping 
that by looking forward…we’ll continue to be well-positioned to serve them (staff 
member-leadership staff level)  
 
Responding to Relationship of Dependency with External Environment   

108 
 
The following section highlights the relationship between environmental context and the 
kinds of approaches and practices embraced in by the participating organizations, answering the 
two secondary research questions. As evidenced by the data, organizations are affected in a 
variety of ways by their internal and external environments. However, it is the latter that appears 
to most directly impact the types of approaches and practices undertaken by the organization. 
 
The data indicates that a set of response processes to the challenges imparted by the 
external environment took place at both the macro (organizational) and the micro (staff) levels 
within each of the organizations. At the macro level, staff understood their organizations as 
taking specific and calculated actions to respond the range of challenges faced by the relationship 
of dependency between the organizations and external stakeholders. These response processes 
were described as occurring in two primary ways: 1) adapting to changing organizational needs 
and 2) employing managerialism. Although participants did not refer explicitly use the term 
managerialism, they described several manifestations of the trend (illustrated in chapter 2). These 
included 1) embracing a corporatized approach; 2) engaging in organizational growth; 3) 
focusing on outputs; and 4) striving to maintain image.  
 
At the micro level, staff engaged in their own personal response processes, many of 
which were described as resulting from the macro response practices the organizations were 
engaging in. These processes were less collective in nature, and more about the ways each 
individual staff member felt they needed to engage in their work in order to navigate some of the 
challenges that they believed resulted from the macro level processes. The following section will 
detail both sets of processes described in the data.  
 
Macro level response processes. 

109 
 
Adapting to changing organizational needs. 
  
 
Participants explained the needs of the organizations changing as a result of the 
dependent relationship they had with external stakeholders. As such, staff members at all levels 
were engaged in an adaptation process in order to successfully navigate the evolving needs. For 
example, the fee-for-service model that Aging Well was planning to implement in order to 
diversify funding sources and to evolve with the changing nature of the aging field represented a 
dramatic shift for an organization that, in all it’s time serving older adults, had never charged for 
services. This paradigm shift, although not entirely misaligned with organizational goals and 
missions (it was occurring in order to maintain programming into the future) ultimately created a 
shift in the needs of the organization.  
 
This shift was characterized by a change in perspective regarding the types of 
partnerships the organization needed to enter into, particularly with the health care industry. It 
also signified a need for greater operational efficiency, as this was something that was demanded 
by those with the organization would be partnering. While the shift was understood as an 
important modification given the changing nature of the aging field, it was unclear how it would 
ultimately affect the organization.  
 
Of particular concern was the effect this would have on the individual staff and the 
culture, which was underpinned by a strong commitment to serving older adults rather than a 
concentrated focus on the organization’s bottom line. Consequently, the shift to fee-for-service 
required several forms of adaptation which one member of the organization’s leadership team 
saw as affecting multiple aspects of the organization. First, she believed that frontline and other 
program level staff was going to endure a significant adjustment as the change was going to 

110 
require several procedural adaptations. For instance, frontline workers were going to have to start 
to  
…“understand some high level thinking that they might not normally think [about]. Like 
implementation and delivery, they need to understand that these are two different payer 
sources and that our Older Americans Act funded employees have to provide what 
they’re expected to provide…but there’s going to need to documentation…to 
demonstrate that we’re keeping these two [payer sources] separate, because the Feds 
certainly don’t wanna pay for our business development” (staff member-leadership staff 
level). 
 
She goes on to explain that the she believed Aging Well was going to undergo a significant 
cultural adaptation as well, which she described in the following way: 
…the biggest way I see it impacting our organization is going to be in the culture. That’s 
what I see. In the nonprofit world we have always…been expected to provide services for 
free. No one cares how we get our funding and no one realizes that this is a business also. 
So many of our contracts that we hold, they don’t pay for overhead costs, and so that’s a 
challenge…Well, not only does the external world look at us and expect us to provide 
services for free, but the culture inside the organization at the low-level staff is also that 
we take care of everyone and provide whatever is needed (staff member-leadership staff 
level). 
 
When pressed further to discuss this cultural conflict she believed was ensuing, she responded: 
The conflict is in the values. Are you valuing the dollar or the person? And can you value 
both at the same time? That’s a challenge. I don’t know that I have an answer to that. I 
think it’s what we’re all trying to figure out.  But I am a very black and white person, I 
see things for how they are. I don’t beat around the bush. We love Betty, and we wanna 
provide services to Betty, but Betty can’t sink the whole ship. The ship needs to stay 
afloat (staff member-leadership staff level).  
 
This excerpt exemplifies much of the conflict experienced at the organizations in regards to the 
relationship of dependency on external stakeholders. In this case, there was a shift in 
organizational needs that resulted from the relationship of dependency with external sources 
(funders and evolving nature of the field). This shift produced a state of disconnect that was 
characterized by wanting to meet the needs of clients but also needing to maintain the financial 

111 
vitality of the organization (the onset of fee-for-service). However, as this participant observed, 
doing so was seen as having significant repercussions for the staff and the organization overall, 
and a negotiation process of sorts would be required in order to help staff transition to this new 
model. Regardless, the changes had to ensue, and the focus needed to be on how to help people 
adapt.  
 
Embracing managerialism. 
 
In addition to adapting to changing organizational needs, the organizations’ responses to 
the external environment included several manifestations of managerialism described in Chapter 
2. It was evident from the data that adopting a managerialist approaches were seen as an 
appropriate and, in some cases, necessary response to the challenges ensuing from the 
relationship of dependency with external stakeholders. The managerialist response process took 
place in four distinct ways: 1) corporatizing the organization; 2) engaging with and perceiving 
organizational growth; 3) focusing on outputs; and 4) striving to maintain image. 
 
Embracing a corporatized approach. 
 
As the organizations attempted to manage some of the discord at the macro level, 
engaging in more corporate oriented philosophies and/or practices were seen as appropriate 
responses. For instance, in making sure that the organization presented well externally, one 
participant described HOAC’s CEO as making sure that the organization focused on strategic 
brand development (a common practice of for-profit entities). Although a strong brand was seen 
as an important representation of the work of the organization, one member of the leadership 
team remarked, “I think the way we face externally is very important”, meaning that the 
perception of the organization to external stakeholders was something that was highly 
emphasized by leadership, specifically the CEO. In talking about the Aging Well’s attempts at 

112 
implementing fee-for-service supported services, a leadership team member described the 
importance of understanding the organization in more traditionally for-profit terms. She 
explained, “…we have to start looking at ourselves as a business rather than a free service. 
Because we’re not a free service, it costs money to keep the lights on, it cost money to have 
employees and insurance and things like that” (leadership staff member-leadership team staff 
level). She continued to explain this more corporate oriented perspective by saying: 
As we make this transition [to fee-for-service], I think there will be more internal 
regulation and that will affect the culture. And that we at the top-level staff need be very 
intensely and acutely aware of how bottom-level staff is going to be affected by the 
implementation of these changes because…in any business or organization that I’ve ever 
been in, there’s a total disconnect between upper-level management and frontline staff. 
There always has been, always will be the way I see it, because you have different value 
systems, you’re approaching things in different ways (staff member-leadership staff 
level). 
 
As a member of the leadership staff this participant was acutely aware of the potential disconnect 
that could ensue as a result of taking a more traditionally for-profit, or corporatized, vantage 
point to the work. However, this was also seen as necessary in order to successfully navigate the 
terrain of discord that resulted from dependency on external stakeholders, and so a more 
corporatized approach was willingly being embraced by the leadership team overall. When asked 
what she believed the overall impact on the organization might be, one participant responded:  
If we’re going to start operating like a business and functioning that way, I could see us 
needing to start regulate things, to make sure that our dollar is going the longest. But we 
also need to keep in mind that we can never become the medical model because we can’t 
forget our end user. We have to make sure that we’re here to provide [services] but how 
can we organization ourselves internally to where we can provide exceptional service in 
the least amount of time with the lowest cost in order to be sustainable (staff member-
leadership staff level). 
 
This excerpt highlights the potential conflict that emerges from embracing a more corporate 
philosophy. The participant emphasizes that the focus needs to remains on the client, however, 

113 
she buttresses this statement with concept of cost efficiency and financial sustainability, two of 
the principal effects of the macro level discord resulting from the relationship the organization 
has with external stakeholders.  
 
Engaging with organizational growth. 
 
Organizational growth was a critical goal described by staff at each organization in the 
study. However, this goal was rarely achieved without significant challenges. For HOAC and 
LAOFA in particular, growth was seen as necessary to keep up with mounting need, as well as a 
direct consequence of the relationship with funders and need to respond to the changing 
landscapes of their respective fields. PARC was engaging in some growth, but the experience 
was described differently since their funding was secured entirely from private sources. In other 
words, the relationship with government funding and policy makers appeared to have an impact 
on how HOAC and LAOFA understood and engaged with growth strategies.  
 
In most cases, the desire to grow was mission driven in the sense that it stemmed from 
wanting to help more people a development staff member asserted: 
I think an important part of [the growth] is mission driven for us…it’s the ability to help 
more people. So, if you’re like, “hey we’re housing one hundred people this year.” That’s 
awesome, but if we can feel like we could house two hundred, then we’re going to do that 
because we feel like we owe that to the community, to the clients that we’re working 
with, um, to our funders, to our partners, to continue to figure out more ways to help 
people given the growth [and] complexity, and the problematic nature of [homelessness] 
(staff member – leadership staff level). 
 
However, despite the mission-driven nature of the growth that this participant described, 
engaging in expansion while continuing to meet the mission in ways that do not conflict with the 
values of the organization sometimes proved challenging. For instance, he describes an example 
where growth is not aligned with organizational capacity, which was common. In describing an 
example of misalignment he said: 

114 
…we have [an opportunity for a] new program and there’s funds for that program, but 
there aren’t any funds to hire someone to be able to…run it. And then we sit at this table 
and we decide, like, “OK that’s a big program, it needs someone to run it…full-time.” 
But we don’t have that money…so what are we going to do?” So even though you’re 
already working fifty or sixty hours a week, we’re going to ask you to do it. Which 
means that [we’re] not effective. Or as effective as you could be. Which then has a 
result…not only on the staff member or members, but also on the clients…it’s not really 
taking into account what the implications of that growth look like for the rest of the 
organization (staff member – leadership staff level). 
 
Another participant, a leadership staff member at LAOFA, described this growth-related 
challenge when he contemplated the following: 
How do you maintain the quality of what you’ve been doing? How do you maintain your 
mission and vision, and don’t get mission creep in some other place? How do you 
manage [growth] effectively and efficiently, and how do you meet the public need for 
these services? So growth [is] a double-edged sword. It brings the opportunity to serve 
more people, but it also brings the challenges of, how do you underpin that? How do you 
have the structural framework, the staffing, the capacity to serve more people? (staff 
member – leadership staff level) 
 
In both instances, growth is mission-driven and results from the organization wanting to serve 
more people. Furthermore, the funding to do so is available and the evolving nature of the field is 
all but requiring the organizations to engage in expansion. However, these examples make 
evident that the capacity to engage in growth does not always accompany opportunity and, as 
such, a conflict arises.  
 
Focusing on outputs. 
 
Focusing on outputs refers to the emphasis placed on “needing meet the numbers”. As 
several participants understood it, the goals of the organizations were often seen as being in 
conflict with the goal of funders, particularly government contractors. While the need to meet 
numerical goals dictated by external sources is not a new phenomenon for nonprofits, the 
intensity of needing to adhere to these mandates contributed to the macro state of discord. 

115 
Specifically, the conflict was felt between wanting and needing meeting outcomes (substantive 
changes/impact for clients) connected to organizational mission and goals, and having to meet 
outputs (number of clients served, etc.) dictated by external sources. In most cases, the outputs 
represented a greater number than the organization believed they could meet while also 
maintaining quality and integrity of services.  
 
This conflict is particularly salient for frontline and program level staff members, many 
of which are tasked with actualizing the focus on outputs on a daily basis. In discussing the 
pressure that staff experience when faced with having to meet outputs a case manager at HOAC 
said, “ If I have twelve months to meet the targets sometimes I end up having to enroll a very 
large amount in one month to catch up for the number I was missing in the previous month…and 
I want to enroll many more [than the minimum allowed] so I can be sure to make the target”. As 
this participant noted, meeting the target set forth by the particular contract she was working 
under became a primary focus, which she felt took her away from being able to center her 
attention on the needs of the individuals she was trying to house. She did her best to maintain the 
integrity of the services she was providing but acknowledged that it was difficult to do so at all 
times given the pressure she felt to meet the numbers.  
 
In another occurrence a program coordinator at PARC discussed the challenges 
associated with what she and others believed were arbitrary number goals assigned based on the 
desire to appease funders. Since PARC doesn’t have any government contracts, their focus on 
outputs takes a bit of a different form than the other two organizations in the study. Nevertheless, 
the intense focus on numbers existed, and the emphasis on outputs was seen as a way for the 
organization to prove their worth to a funding community that often relied on outputs rather than 
outcomes to determine the service effectiveness. This participant referred to these numbers as the 

116 
“sexy numbers that people want to know”, which was in reference to the job readiness program 
she was charged with coordinating.  
 
The program was created with an initial goal of preparing 1000 clients to obtain jobs. 
However, it was not clear to this participant, or other staff members, how the goal of 1000 clients 
was arrived at nor were the avenues to attain this goal clearly defined among the staff responsible 
for meeting this goal. As one participant described it, the goal was “arbitrary”. Furthermore, the 
program was viewed as a way of addressing a current trend in the field of reducing poverty, 
which was focused on helping people obtain jobs after the economic crisis of 2008, which meant 
that it was in direct response to the evolving landscape of the field. However, the program was 
never designed with job attainment in mind, it was designed to prepare people to “put their 
resume out there and get a job…[to develop] marketable…skills” (development staff member – 
leadership staff member level). However, the readiness of the clients was not the concern for 
funders. Instead they were concerned with how many people actually obtained employment. One 
participant describes this discrepancy by saying, “the funders don't care. They want to see how 
many people actually got jobs…[but] we're not set up to be a job placement program, we only 
have a job readiness program”. Another staff member confirms this sentiment when she stated: 
There was no groundwork on how it’s going to be done…so I feel like…while we’re 
trying to make people job ready, trying to strengthen the program…and [proving 
that]…we’re actually doing a good job with training these folks…but I feel like that’s not 
what people wanna hear. They wanna know how many people got jobs. They ask 
questions, “oh, you’re making people job ready, so that means they’re getting a job?” It’s 
like, “no, not necessarily” (staff member - middle management level). 
 
These examples show the ways in which focusing on outputs become a response to the external 
pressures exerted upon the organization by funders and the evolving landscape of the field within 
which they operate. In each instance, the organization prioritized numbers over other measures, 
and while program quality was not necessarily being advertently sacrificed, the staff questioned 

117 
their abilities to maintain the integrity of the services they were providing while having to focus 
on outputs.  
 
Maintaining image. 
 
The final way that managerialism is operationalized as a response process to the 
organizations existing in a state of macro level discord is through efforts to maintain 
organizational image. The image that organizations project is a seen as critical. This is 
particularly so for higher-level staff members who are concerned with maintaining a strong 
relationship with funders and policy makers that, through the relationship of dependency, exert 
control over the organizations. This control, which often takes the shape of organizations 
attempting to secure funding or other opportunities simply because they are available, is seen by 
staff members as partly driving the focus on maintaining image. One director level staff member 
at HOAC communicated this focus on maintaining image as being connected to the focus on 
outputs, which she believed bolstered the external facing image of the organization. She said: 
To [the leadership], “we’re a state-wide agency! Look at our numbers!” Blah, blah, blah. 
They never talk about our retention rate, but, “Look at our numbers!” And even yesterday 
I was at a meeting with [other industry people] and they were like, “You guys are the best 
in the industry”, and I’m [thinking]… “no we’re not…” (staff member – leadership staff 
level) 
 
When pressed to explain how she understood the organization wanting to be viewed as the “best 
in the industry”, she went on to say that she believed it was the goal of HOAC’s leadership to be 
revered by funders, policy makers, and other organizations in this way. She specifically 
described the CEO as wanting HOAC to be seen as “really packaged and nice and pretty…and 
he wants to be known as…the best in the industry”. When asked how she comprehended what it 
meant to seen in this light, she recalled, “ it means we don’t apologize that we are the best and 

118 
that we’re going to take all these contracts and go in and help [solve] homelessness. Bold is 
another one, that we’re bold, we’re out there…we’re go-getters”.  
 
Another leadership level staff member also understood the relationship her organization 
had with funders as creating conflict that was connected to the need for externally-facing 
success, and consequently a push to maintain image. She explained: 
We just got $5 million for a brand new program but…it’s one of those things, though, it’s 
not exactly a model that we [already] had…The city and county have really put a lot 
more money into homeless services. And so again, it was one of those things where…a 
lot of the communities we were in, wanted to apply for rapid re-housing for individuals. 
And so it was like, well, if we don’t apply, we might not be seen as a leader in this, which 
we’re not, because we don’t do rapid re-housing for individual, we do it for families and 
veterans (staff member – leadership staff level). 
 
When asked why she believed the organization decided to apply funding for this even though it 
wasn’t something they had expertise in, she replied, “I think we want to be seen as a leader in the 
city and county funding opportunities” (leadership team member – leadership staff level). For 
this participant, applying for and getting the $5 million dollar contract was less about providing 
services and more about making sure the organization continued to establish themselves as a 
critical player in the homeless services field. Although HOAC was not completely inexperienced 
in the rapid rehousing model, providing these services to individuals was not an area they had 
developed expertise in. The contract they had been awarded was going to rapidly thrust the 
organization into providing these types of services without the infrastructure needed to 
successfully implement the program.  
 
These illustrations provide insight into the ways that the organizations focus on 
maintaining image as a response to the relationship of dependency the organizations are in with 
external stakeholders. As the participants described, this relationship is understood as leading to 
the a focus on maintaining an externally-facing image focused on success, which is seen as the 

119 
way by which external stakeholders determine an organization’s abilities to serve and their 
legitimacy within the larger service field.  
 
Micro level response processes. 
 
In addition to the macro level processes the organizations engaged in, participants also 
alluded to the ways that they as individuals responded to the challenges resulting from the 
relationship with the external environment. This took place through a personal, individual 
response process that consisted of three distinct actions of negotiation on the part of staff a) 
accepting mediocrity, b) balancing competing demands, and c) bearing the burden. Each of these 
responses signifies a modification of both thought process and behavior related to individual job 
roles and responsibilities.  
 
Study participants described feeling like they were unable to do their very best work 
because of some process or procedure that was resulting from the response of the organization to 
the challenging relationship they were in with external stakeholders. They also reported feeling 
like they were forced to contend with feelings of conflict created by demands that contrasted 
with organizational goals or individuals’ roles in helping to meet these goals. Overall, they felt 
negatively challenged to meet organizational outcomes, and in each of these processes staff 
negotiated with themselves and others in order to continue to provide services and to work 
towards organizational goals and missions. While not always ideal, the negotiation that staff 
engaged in allowed them to continue to do their jobs in ways that felt acceptable and enabled 
them attempt to work towards organizational goals from a place of strength rather than deficit.  
 
Accepting mediocrity. 
 
In many cases participants described how they felt they were not able to do their very 
best work because of some process, person, or organizational belief obstructing their abilities to 

120 
do so. As such, many staff explained having to come to terms with not achieving everything they 
would like to in their role or not being able to work from a place entirely informed by their 
personal or professional belief system. While this was frustrating for many, they also used this 
realization as a kind of negotiation process with themselves that served, in some ways, as a form 
of self-preservation in a difficult environment. This acceptance was participants’ way of 
responding to the micro level discord they were forced to exist within.  
 
One participant, a development staff member at HOAC, talked about having to accept 
“doing less” as the nature of working in a resource scarce environment where organizational 
needs are always changing and adaptation to these changes are a part of organizational life. In 
providing an example of how accepting mediocrity materializes for staff, he said:  
Lets just say a contract says that we can have a 1 to 35 caseload, but the program [staff] is 
telling us it really needs to be 1 to 20. At times, we’ll make that decision, that even 
though we know it’s not perfect, we’re going to keep that 1 to 35 caseload. For monetary 
reasons, for budgetary reasons, maybe we don’t have the staff, or whatever. Well, those 
extra fifteen clients on that caseload, are they getting everything they deserve, that we as 
an organization…kind of…like a social contract, should be giving them? I don’t know. 
Maybe? Maybe not, I doubt it….[But]…if you have a social worker that’s telling you that 
they’re maxed out and they don’t have the time to invest in the individual clients, that’s a 
problem. Go hire someone. Even if it means it’s going to have a negative impact on…the 
organization’s bottom line (staff member – leadership staff level).  
 
He continued, talking specifically about how accepting mediocrity is a response to the turmoil 
often created for staff and the organization more generally from engaging in an organization 
growth effort. He explained this conflict in the following terms: 
You have all this growth and…[say] you have a million dollar budget, but you have about 
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars of extra capital expense you need to make, and 
you only have a hundred thousand dollars to do this. So you’re making tough decisions 
about how you’re going to spend that money. You’re prioritizing things, you’re putting 
others in the cue. Like, this year we’re going to do IT, next year we’re going to do 
phones, the year after that we’re going to patch the ceiling. All of which are necessities, 
all of which have an impact on the organization, on morale, on your outcomes (staff 
member – leadership staff level). 

121 
 
 
In both of the examples provided by this participant, staff has to accept working at a level that is 
perhaps less than ideal or does not meet their personal or professional standards. The examples 
indicate how the decisions that organizations are making in response to the macro level state of 
conflict trickle down in ways that directly impact staff on an individual level. As such, accepting 
mediocrity becomes a method of defense. A leadership team member, best describes this as 
“perfection [being] the enemy of good”. He goes on to say: 
Good is okay. Good is good enough. [But] it’s a tough position…to be in. Sometimes 
philosophically, particularly when you’re talking about human lives, or you take a step 
back and you’re talking about…whole programs…If you’re spread too thin, you don’t 
have the resources to get any given program done, and…let’s just stay the contract says 
you have to help a hundred people, but we know if we were really kind of focused and 
doing it right, we could help two hundred people. But we’re not, and we can’t, so we’re 
just going to have to accept the level of…I’ll use a word I am not comfortable using, 
mediocrity. And just because we have too many things going on, we can’t focus on that 
one thing…and that’s challenging and I think that has a trickle down effect on staff, and 
on clients…and it’s something that has permeated the organization (staff member – 
leadership staff level).  
 
 
A third staff member, a person in a middle management role summed up having to accept 
mediocrity by stating:  
…it’s important for [the organization] to say we’re the best in the industry…but in my 
directors group because we meet every week, all of us feel terrible…we don’t feel like 
we’re the best in the industry. We feel like we do shitty [work], we’re forced to do shitty 
work, and we wish we could do more (staff member - middle management level).  
 
In each of the instances participants recalled the ways that having to accept doing less than they 
would like to do or know they can or should do, was an organizational reality faced regularly by 
staff members at all levels of the organization. As one participant explained, there was a “trickle 
down” factor, that he believed made it even more difficult for program and frontline staff 
members, who were tasked with the serving clients directly. Furthermore, he was certain that 

122 
having to embrace mediocrity did not just affect staff but ultimately affected clients in the long 
run. Regardless, they continued to work to the best of their abilities and with the organizational 
missions and its clients in mind. 
 
Bearing the burden 
 
In addition to having to accept working to a standard that was less than desirable, 
participants also talked about responding to the micro state of discord through a process of 
“bearing the burden”. This was portrayed as instances where participants felt responsible for 
outcomes that were not entirely aligned with the missions or goals of the organizations or when 
participants felt negatively challenged to meet organizational outcomes. Moreover, this response 
was described as bearing an emotional burden inflicted by the challenges staff experienced in 
their role.   
 
When describing her experience as a shelter case manager, one participant talked about 
the challenges she faced in providing a certain level of service to her clients in the face of the 
forthcoming closure of the shelter. Although it was closing, the shelter was still housing clients 
and she did not feel that the organization was maintaining the space to the best of its ability, 
which she felt the clients picked up on. When asked to elaborate on this she explained: 
People won’t stay [in the shelter] if it’s a bad environment, and you won’t ever [be able 
to] help them if they leave…and if it’s not being kept clean, if things aren’t fixed, if the 
guests can’t get along, if the staff are so afraid for their jobs, they’re so afraid of what’s 
happening because no one is communicating with them…the [clients] eat it up…they 
operate from a survival place, so those kinds of emotions…they’re much quicker to jump 
on that stuff, much quicker to react than people who feel stable (staff member – frontline 
staff level). 
 
She felt that in her role as a case manager her job was not only to provide resources. She also felt 
it was her responsibility to keep clients, who were already vulnerable, from this engaging in the 
emotionality resulting from the sense of instability that she described. This instability, induced 

123 
by a sense of turbulence taking place at the shelter, was something she believed she needed to 
personally take on in order to protect her clients. She continued to describe the burden she 
experienced by saying: 
What I feel like I do a lot of is damage control and peace keeping, and [telling clients] 
“no, it’s cool guys, there’s gonna be housing,” or “we’re gonna do this and don’t give 
up.” And it’s just holding that hope and making sure that we stay, and we continue to 
engage in what we’re doing, even when I’m just lying through my teeth, or I don’t have 
anything to offer them, really. Or I know that HOAC isn’t gonna do anything in my heart, 
but I have to make them feel like, “oh yeah, HOAC knows that that’s broken but they’ll 
fix t, don’t worry.”…I have to tell them that, and it gets exhausting to lie to people all day 
(staff member – frontline staff level). 
 
This participant believed that the impending closing of the shelter, which was linked to the 
changing organizational needs of HOAC, led the organization to make certain decisions in 
regards to service provision at that location. These decisions placed front level staff in tough 
positions of not being able to provide services in the ways they needed to or wanted to for clients 
that were still living in the shelter. Consequently, she did what she could to make to ensure the 
emotional stability of the clients even though, as she indicated, they picked up on the unrest that 
was occurring. For her, the most important thing was maintaining a positive experience for 
clients living in the shelter, which meant bearing the emotional burden that ensued from the state 
of instability.  
 
A program coordinator’s experience at PARC was also characterized by not wanting the 
clients to experience any of the “behind the scenes” turmoil the organization was experiencing 
due to having to respond to ongoing “financial realities”. She prided herself on the programs she 
helped to build and maintain and was very concerned with making sure her clients continued to 
have a positive and enriching experience at the organization, even if it meant emotionally 
exerting herself to shield them. She explained:  

124 
I hear really good, really wonderful feedback from clients that say that they really 
appreciate the services, that they enjoy the services…I don’t think they are aware of what 
goes on behind the scene…I don’t ever want to make them aware of how hard this is. I 
feel like I am keeping up the façade and it seems to be working. The clients are 
happy…they’re getting served. Kids are in music class…kids are in art class, that’s a 
great thing…they’re learning something. I mean, that’s what it’s all about….[and] I hope 
[the difficulties] are not impacting them (staff member – program staff level). 
 
Another example of how staff is burdened by the challenges that result from having to respond to 
micro level discord is in the pace of work they have to endure. The organizations in the study, 
particularly HOAC, were very focused on growth and expansion. These efforts were outcomes of 
the pressures exerted on the organization at various levels, starting with dependent relationship 
they have with external stakeholders. As such, growth often led to what one development staff 
member at PARC described existing in a frenetic environment resulting from taking on too much 
and not knowing what to let go of. This frequently meant working at an unsustainable pace. 
Although the organizations were always looking to take on new things in order to serve clients 
better, she explained, “since I started it’s just gotten busier and busier and busier…there’s just no 
downtime and you can see it in the staff and in me. It’s just always crazy because we haven’t 
identified what not to do”. When asked to further explain what it meant to be working in a 
“crazy” environment such as the one she was alluding to, she continued, “…it’s having five 
projects going, not even able to finish two of them properly, even though they’re closing out, and 
already having to worry about…starting three more along the ways”.  
 
Another staff member at PARC described the environment similarly, but her 
understanding of the frenetic nature of the organization was experienced differently. 
Nevertheless, there was a burden being borne. This participant explained the nature of the 
organization constantly needing and wanting to do more led her to being “guilty of caring way 
too much”. She continued by saying, “I invest way too much emotional energy into this 

125 
place…maybe at unhealthy levels…and I think it contributes to burnout, I [don’t think I] should 
be so emotionally invested…I give so much here” (staff member - program staff level). 
 
Balancing competing demands. 
 
The last way that participants described responding to existing in a state of micro discord 
was through the process of having to balance competing demands, which was characterized by 
staff feeling like they had to balance or navigate demands that were believed to be in conflict 
with individual roles or the missions and goals of the organization. This was most often 
experienced in relation to the mandates placed on staff from a member of the leadership team 
(including board members), funders, or both. These mandates, though not imparted directly to 
staff, were often communicated through all levels of the organization and, as such, staff felt that 
there was a balancing act that required significant managing on a daily basis.   
 
In talking about the implementation of the job-training program at PARC one participant, 
a middle manager, remarked on how she constantly had to provide “evidence” that outputs were 
being met or that her program was effective. These effectiveness standards were not driven by 
the guidelines by which the program was created. Rather such standards were designated by 
external sources (funders, board of directors, etc.) as the criteria by which the program should be 
deemed successful. The most specific example of this is illuminated by the focus of external 
stakeholders on job attainment, rather than job preparation. The latter, however, was the core 
objective of the program. Nevertheless, since this was not something that was ever fully 
explained to funders or board members nor were people corrected regarding their 
misunderstanding of the program, this misconception persisted and was something this 
participant was forced to maneuver on a regular basis.  

126 
 
In describing how she balanced this, she talked about another organization whose entire 
focus was to provide employment for people. She explained, “we’re not Bridging Futures15, 
where [they] help people get jobs, we’re PARC, [where] we help people get work experience so 
they can put something on their resume…so there’s [an inconsistency between] what I was hired 
to do and what [I’m] expected to do”. This inconsistency again was a result of leadership and 
other external stakeholder’s misunderstanding about the goals of the program. The refusal on the 
part of the leadership to correct this error led this participant into a balancing act that she 
described as taking her away from the work she was expected to do in regards to job readiness. 
She further explained these competing demands of placating external funders while continuing to 
meet the tasks at hand in the following way:  
If I give a presentation, the questions are usually from board members or from 
visitors…they wanna know about [employment]. But…I just told you that our focus is on 
the groundwork of [preparing people for jobs]…but…they always ask me how many 
people got employed, or what are you doing for people to get employed, or what are you 
doing as an incentive to congratulate the people who got employed so that they will 
report back to you that they got [a job]…I’m like, “let me think about that one, what are 
some incentives…”, and when they stop asking me, that’s when I’m like OK, let me 
concentrate on what I really need to do in this process (staff member - middle 
management level). 
 
In another illustration of having to balance competing demands a member of development and 
the leadership team at HOAC discussed how these more macro level demands create an 
imbalance for staff members. He recalled the how an expectation of funders that monies are used 
appropriately created a sense of pressure that was always at the forefront of his and other 
leadership team members’ minds. In this case, the competing demands took the shape of funders 
versus organizational needs. He described this imbalance by providing the following example: 
                                                        
15 This is a pseudonym  

127 
If we have a million dollar budget, and I am spending ten percent of it on [administrative 
costs], I have nine hundred thousand for programs. If I am spending twenty percent on 
[administrative costs], I only have eight hundred thousand to spend on programs…it’s 
like that hundred degree pie…there’s only so much, if you take from here, or you add 
here, it’s taking from here. So how do we maximize, [especially] when there’s an 
expectation on the part of funders and public that we’re going to manage their dollars in 
more…effective, respectful way? (staff member – leadership staff level) 
 
Another staff member in leadership at HOAC remarked on how the critical need to financially 
support administrative services and general overhead conflicted with the lack of support to do so. 
As a staff member whose job was dominated by budget responsibilities, she was constantly 
engaged in a balancing act between the organization and its staff and the funders. Like many 
other participants she highlighted that the need for administrative and infrastructure support was 
absolutely critical, yet consistently underfunded due to what she believed was a lack of trust on 
the part of funders, both public and private, regarding how monies are spent. When describing 
the relationship with government funding bodies, she talked about it being a process of “proving 
[that] every dollar you’ve spent” is going to exactly what the contract stipulates, which is rarely 
overhead or administrative support.  Consequently, it was believed that the programs and other 
aspects of the organization suffered, and staff members were left managing these competing 
demands in order to not dissuade funding sources from contributing in the future. When asked 
what she believed to be the overall impact of having to balance this particular set of competing 
demands, she stated:  
…we’re caught in the cycle of just being able to barely do what has to be done, and in 
many cases, not being able to do anything outside of that. We're often, and especially at 
the staff level, there's no opportunity to think outside-of-the-box or to try something 
different or to have the flexible funds, to say, "You know what, I think that for this 
person, paying to have the car fixed is gonna be the key to them being successful in the 
long run." And it's so restrictive that that's not even an option…We would love to be able 
to push that [funding] down to the case management level…[but we] can't because if we 
were to do that, then come an audit time, that expense would 100% become unallowed, 

128 
which means we would never get paid for it, or we have to pay it back (staff member – 
leadership staff level). 
 
Existing In a State of Discordance  
 
Each of the organizations in the study has a clear mission upon which their work is based, 
and meeting this mission is the principal focus of the work. The data confirms that the 
organizations work very hard at and are extremely committed to serving their mission and 
meeting related goals. However, the findings also suggest that despite the commitment that 
individual staff members and the organizations overall have to meeting their missions in the most 
client centered ways possible, this does not occur without considerable challenge. In many cases 
these challenges were not seen as simply job-related difficulties. For some staff members, they 
were viewed as significant impediments to being successful. In analyzing the challenges 
described by participants, a theme of discordance within the organizations became evident. 
Though talked about differently depending on an individual’s role and responsibilities, this idea 
was present throughout the data and when analyzed, a process by which this discord develops 
was discerned.  
 
The term discord means a “lack of agreement or harmony”. Despite experiencing success 
in meeting their mission-related goals, this lack of agreement or harmony was something that 
emerged at all levels of the organization (although it was experienced differently depending on 
one’s position within the staff hierarchy and the responsibilities accompanying their position). 
Utilizing the findings presented in this chapter, the conceptual model in figure 6.1provides a 
framework for understanding the discord that emerges at different levels of the organization, and 
it suggests that as a result of this dissonance, organizations face difficulties in fully realizing their 
missions and goals. This does not imply that organizations are not meeting their missions, or that 

129 
mission drift (a shifting from original mission to a new purpose) is occurring. Rather, it implies 
that the challenges staff members described as an central aspect of their experiences are 
impacting the organization in ways that potentially hinder the full achievement of mission related 
goals.  
 
A Conceptual model of discordance 
Figure 6.1: Conceptual Model of Discordance 
                     
 

130 
 
The model in figure 6.1 consists of three distinct stages. The first stage includes the 
relationship of dependency on external stakeholders and the macro level state of discord that 
emerges from this relationship. This discord takes place at highest level of organizational 
processes and decision-making, meaning that organizational decisions are associated with the 
dependence on funding bodies as well as the trends taking place in the field (e.g., services to the 
aging adult population), sometimes at the expense of what is best for the organization and its 
clients. It also represents a disharmony between the types of approaches needed for the 
organization to meet its identified goals and mission, and the approaches external sources deem 
as best or most effective.  
 
Stage 2 encompasses a response to the macro level state of discord, the subsequent 
emergence of a micro level state of discord, and the ensuing response. The first set of responses 
is rooted in organizational processes that, again, occur most often at the higher, or more macro 
levels of the organization. This is not to be confused with the organizational staff hierarchy, as 
the data indicates that staff at any level may partake in these responsive processes. Rather, the 
processes are more aligned with higher, more macro level actions that often become lines of 
reasoning by which the organization engages in certain actions or specific procedures. Based on 
these macro level actions, a more micro level state of discord develops and, like the state of 
discord taking place at the macro level, emerges as a disharmony. However, at this level, the 
tension lies more at level of daily practices and procedures that staff of all levels engage in and, 
in part, to the response to the macro level state of discord taking place during the first stage of 
the model. Staff again responds to this discord, but the mechanisms by which they do so are 
more concentrated at the individual decision-making and action level.  

131 
 
Stage 3 consists of experiencing barriers to success that staff experience. These barriers, 
which also characterize the internal environment of the organizations, can be understood as 
resulting from staff having to engage in responses to both the macro and micro levels of discord. 
When understood as a process, the model helps to illuminate some of the challenges 
organizations face in fully working towards their mission, despite their intended commitment 
and efforts.  
 
The following section will utilize the results of the study to explain how the process of 
discord indicated by the model emerges within social justice nonprofit organizations. In doing 
so, the ways in which the approaches and practices employed by the organizations contribute to 
the organizations facing difficulties in fully actualizing their missions and mission related goals 
becomes clear.  
 
Stage 1 
Being dependent on external stakeholders. 
 
The legal structure of nonprofit organizations makes them inherently dependent upon 
external stakeholders for survival. In the case of social justice nonprofits this dependency, more 
often than not, this takes the shape of receiving funding from government grants and contracts, 
foundation funding, and funding from individuals. Each of the organizations in the study receive 
funding from any or all of these sources, with two of the three organizations relying primarily 
upon government funding in the form of contracts and, to a lesser extent, grants. One of the 
organizations does not accept any government funding, a decision in response to the difficulties 
resulting from extensive reporting requirements attached to government contracting and grant 
processes, and, according to one participant, to appease conservative donors who “like that we 

132 
don’t take government funding, so none of their tax dollars go to us” (development staff member 
– leadership staff member level).  
 
The dependency on external stakeholders took place in two primary ways: being 
controlled by funding/funders and responding to the evolving landscape of the field. Staff 
members at all levels of each of the organizations believed that their organization was heavily 
reliant on the relationship the organization had with various external sources, and it was often 
acknowledged as somewhat of a necessary evil. The organization cannot accomplish their goals 
or work towards meeting their missions without funding, but as the data indicates staff 
experienced the relationship between the organizations and the funders/funding sources 
(sometimes differentiated by staff) as at best, challenging and at worst, oppressive.  
 
Additionally, policies or public understanding surrounding the issues with which the 
organizations were concerned also emerged as creating a relationship with external stakeholders 
based on dependence. Despite a long history in serving their target populations with a deep and 
intrinsic understanding of the issues faced, they perceived the larger landscape of the field as 
dictating decision-making processes at macro levels. For instance, several staff members at 
Aging Well, the older adult services organization in the study, talked about the organization’s 
efforts to partner with the health care industry to provide services. This was a new model for this 
organization which, historically, had always made decisions regarding the types of services to be 
provided and had always kept service provision “in house”. However, according one participant,  
“…the hot trend and the movement today in aging is…how are we going to lower 
Medicare costs, how we’re gonna provide better serve at a lower cost, keep 
people healthier longer? And there’s more people accessing this system so we’ve 
got to figure out how to minimize costs…(staff member – leadership staff level).  
 

133 
A rapidly growing aging population and the ensuing drain on resources have created a need for 
the healthcare industry to begin thinking about how to provide services differently. The financial 
influence held by this industry ultimately provides a space for them to enter into the service 
provision conversation that has historically not included in the industry in this way and allows it 
to play a part in shaping the direction of the field of older adult service. However, this new 
relationship did not come without significant challenges. Yet, the industry’s level of influence, as 
well as the potential for funding that accompanies partnerships such as this, represents an 
example of the dependency on external stakeholders that was frequently referred by participants 
at this particular organization. 
Existing in state of macro level discord. 
 
The highly dependent relationship organizations have with external stakeholders 
produces a state of macro level discord, which can best be understood as a disharmony between 
the types of approaches the organizations believe are necessary to embrace in order to meet its 
identified goals and mission, and those that are dictated by external sources in the manner of 
funding or policy decisions. Study participants characterized this conflict as a disconnect 
between what they believed the approach should be to doing the work and what was actually 
occurring based on funding mandates or trends in the field. While there was not always a 
complete lack of agreement regarding approach, a discontent was present on the part of several 
staff members who felt negatively challenged by the amount of control funders appeared to exert 
over the decision making processes of the organization and the everyday administration of the 
work. Although this process occurs at the macro organizational level, lower level staff members 
are not precluded from experiencing the discord as organizational level decisions affect staff 
throughout the organizational hierarchy.  

134 
 
Several participants recalled the way that the “financial realities” of the organization 
impacted the types of decisions that were made at the higher levels of the organization. For 
instance, in describing PARC’s decisions regarding temporary staffing of the education program 
when the program coordinator went on leave, she recalled that an ever-increasing concern over 
having sufficient resources led leadership to inadequately staff her program during her absence. 
She believed her program was not provided with the staffing needed to amply support the day-to-
day activities. She talked specifically about the leadership’s decision to temporarily operate the 
program with volunteers rather than a full-time staff person, which she believed was detrimental 
to the overall program’s functioning. While she acknowledged the quality of the volunteers that 
give their time to the organization, she believed that to charge volunteers with running a program 
that is normally run by a full-time staff member ultimately did a disservice to the program as 
well as its participants. She described the experience in the following way: 
…I had been here for three years. I had built the program up. It was really a lot more 
work than before, and I hoped, and I talked about hiring somebody [for when I was on 
leave]. I talked about even hiring a part-time person. I knew college students that would 
love a part-time job for three months and they were just like, “No”. They were just like, 
“No, you need to find a volunteer to do that.” And when I spoke with [my supervisor] 
she’s like, “oh, good. Then they’re gonna save some money. This is great! While you’re 
off for three months they’re gonna save some money…I’m like, “Is this all I am? A line 
in your budget?” (Staff member-program staff level). 
 
The decision to save money rather than adequately support the program during this participant’s 
absence was viewed as one that was made without the well being of the program or the clients it 
served in mind. Rather, the primary consideration was that of “saving money”, made this 
participant question the organization’s commitment to the people her program served and the 
education program overall. This decision, which she described as being based on “financial 
realities”, conflicted with what she understood the goals of the values of organization to be. 

135 
 
In another example a case manager at HOAC discussed her understanding of staff 
shortages as being related to both the “financial realities” of the organization as well as the ways 
that higher-level decisions are made based on funding opportunities, not organizational priorities. 
She believed these decisions, while perhaps necessary given certain constraints, nevertheless 
created significant strain on program operation. While she admittedly felt like she did not fully 
know the whole picture given her limited access as a case manager to leadership and 
management level decision making processes, she believed that decisions were ultimately made 
without full consideration for program capacity. For instance, in describing HOAC’s expansion 
into different markets, she felt that the attainment of funding did not always come with enough 
planning to implement programs sufficiently or appropriately. She said,  
…they don’t appropriate enough, or something gets misappropriated and all of a sudden I 
don’t know why [but] you can’t the staff or…you can’t hire people. I don’t know why, 
but that seems to be HOAC’s issue, hiring. I don’t understand. But yeah, like in 
Fresno…they opened Fresno. They make one woman…the executive director, and the 
financial officer, and the hiring manager, and this and that and that. And she said, “fuck 
you” and quit one day. And walked out. There was way too much for one person to do 
(staff member - frontline staff level).  
 
In this case, a new service site was created through the acquisition of an existing organization in 
the city of Fresno16. The opportunity to expand into this geographic location was in line with the 
organization’s expansion strategy and goals, which was focused on developing services in new 
markets to meet unmet needs, often at the request of city and community leaders. An executive 
team member at HOAC described the agency’s expansion as being driven partly by the 
organization “wanting to try to fill a need and ultimately, our mission’s really broad, it’s to end 
homelessness…so if we’re doing that, then we want to be able to do that for as many people and 
as many communities as possible”. She goes on to explain:  
                                                        
16 Not the actual city where this expansion took place 

136 
When you've been in one community for so long, again, many people within the LA 
community still think of HOAC as a shelter operator, and that's just such a small piece of 
what we do now. We're trying to shift that perception, but at the same time, in other 
communities, for example in Fresno, we have this expertise in terms of these field-based 
services, the mental health services and the other aspects that we're really trying to shift 
more and more towards…we can pursue Medi-Cal certification in those areas where it 
would be harder to do [in LA], and then we can come back and do it here once we've got 
the experience elsewhere. So there's those kinds of things, you just have opportunities 
that you wouldn't have in a larger market by going into other areas (staff member- 
executive staff level).  
 
The combination of the need for services, the desire for HOAC’s expertise on the part of policy 
makers and city leaders, and the availability of funding and other opportunities made available to 
HOAC to engage in regional expansion led the organization to incorporate rapid and expansive 
growth into their organizational strategy. However, as one case manager noted, this effort was 
not always met with the same enthusiasm from staff given the degree of stress this placed on 
existing services and employees. In other words, the organization’s enthusiasm and desire to 
expand was not always aligned with their capacity to do so. Nevertheless, as many participants 
noted, HOAC continued the expansion because not doing so was viewed as posing a risk to the 
organization’s abilities to secure future funding. An executive staff member described this reality 
in the following way:  
I would say one of our challenges too is that we actually, probably a year and a half to 
two years ago, we decided we don't really want to grow much anymore, we need [the 
infrastructure] to catch up to [the growth], but the environment hasn't really allowed for 
that because if you don't apply for something, for example, homeless services has gotten 
so much attention and funding over the past few years, if you stay out of it right now 
because you're like, "We've gotta get ourselves together," then you miss the boat and you 
can't get back in (staff member- executive staff level). 
 
This example points to the control that ensues from the dependent relationship organizations 
have with external stakeholders. As this participant revealed, to cease applying for funding that 
was being made increasingly available due to the evolving landscape of homeless services—even 

137 
though a focus on infrastructure was necessary at that time—would have posed serious risk to 
the financial health, and perhaps the legitimacy, of the organization. As such, applying for 
funding and the acquisition of service sites through organizational mergers continued relatively 
unabated for approximately five years, regardless of the lack of organizational infrastructure to 
support the growth.  
 
This does not imply that organizational leadership did not recognize existence or 
significance of this conflict. As was observed by one executive staff member, the organization 
did acknowledge the need to focus on infrastructure. However, they were forced to contend with 
making certain decisions, which ultimately propelled HOAC into a state of macro level discord 
fueled by the organization’s dependent relationship with external stakeholders. Furthermore, this 
instance indicates the ways in which the evolving landscape of the field and the control that 
funders have over organizations work in concert with one another to further reinforce the 
relationship of dependency. In this case, the dissonance takes the shape of making decision to not 
focus on developing critical infrastructure to support the programmatic work of the organization 
developed during a growth period. As one case manager alluded to, this had severe repercussions 
for staff and programming more generally.  
 
Stage 2. 
Responding to state of macro level discord. 
 
The discord that resulted from the dependent relationship between the organizations and 
external stakeholders produced several mechanisms of response on the part of staff which, for 
each of the organizations in the study, became a primary lens through which they made decisions 
and implemented daily practices and procedures. As was previously described, the responses 
emerged in two primary ways following ways: a) adapting to changing organizational needs, b) 

138 
employing managerialism. Again, staff often discussed their understanding of these responses as 
conflicting with what they believed to the best or most appropriate ways to meet missions and 
goals. Because of these processes, which staff described as having a more direct impact on the 
everyday practices and procedures implemented at various organizational levels, another state of 
discord emerged, this time at the more micro level.  
 
During the course of the research, Homeless Outreach and Assistance Coalition (HOAC), 
the homeless services agency in the study, was engaged in the closing of long held service site, 
which, according to leadership, had become financially burdensome to the organization. This 
site, a temporary homeless shelter serving approximately 60 chronically homeless individuals, 
was to close rather quickly, and the staff would be laid off. Staff knew little information 
regarding the closure, but they understood the termination as a direct response to the city’s push 
toward a rapid rehousing model—a model that focused on quickly rehousing homeless 
individuals and that discouraged transitional housing models such as the traditional homeless 
shelter. As a result of this shift in perspective, organizations were redirecting transitional housing 
funds into contracts designed to fund the rapid rehousing model.  
 
Despite the organization’s long history of the providing some sort of transitional housing 
as part of their service model, the shift in funding priorities meant that the needs of the 
organization were changing, and, thus, an adaptation process had to occur. Although she was not 
entirely sure of the reasons a case manager at the site being closed speculated that shifts in 
perspectives regarding how to serve the homeless on the part of policy makers, and subsequently, 
funding changes to services were to blame. She said,  
It’s not cost effective to run anymore…it just isn’t…it just doesn’t work. I don’t know 
why…but I think that [the organization has] a whole other vision that I’m not even privy 
to, and I could speculate all day about…I think they want to go completely to permanent 
housing, I think that’s what they want to do…[because] Housing First is the way of the 

139 
future, and that shelters and 90 day stuff doesn’t get as much funding anymore because 
everyone wants to be Housing First, so nobody wants to fund the shelters (staff member – 
frontline staff level). 
 
For this participant, the closure of the shelter and the move toward focusing on more permanent 
housing presented a conflict. She understood this shift as beneficial in the goal of helping to 
decrease homelessness, but she felt that the organization closed the shelter because 1) it just 
“didn’t have the focus or the money to put to [the site]” and 2) they wanted to sell the land. For 
her, the organization was compromising its commitment to clients by not thinking about the 
repercussions of closing transitional housing and moving to a predominantly rapid 
rehousing/housing first model. In discussing the move toward the rapid rehousing model and the 
subsequent closure of the shelter, she remarked, “Do you just want people to sit on the street 
until they can go to housing? Why don’t you want a place for them to go in-between?”  
 
Existing in a state of micro level discord  
 
This case manager’s experience illustrates an example of how micro level discord 
emerged as a result of the organization’s response to the more macro level discord. The closure 
of the shelter contributed to the feelings of conflict at the individual level, meaning that it shaped 
her every day experiences as a case manager directly serving clients, and it created a personal 
dissatisfaction with the decisions the organization made and the practices to carry out these 
decisions. Figure 6.2 indicates the process by which this took place. 

140 
Figure 6.2: Micro Level Discord
 
 
Responding to state of micro level discord.  
 
Similar to the responses to the macro level stage of discord, a response to the more micro 
level state of discord emerged. These responses consist of the ways that staff described having 
to: a) accept mediocrity, b) balance competing demands, and c) bear the burden. Each of these 
responses signifies a modification of both thought process and behavior related to individual job 
roles and responsibilities. Study participants described feeling like they were unable to do their 
very best work because of some process or procedure that was resulting from the response to 
macro level discord. They also reported feeling like they were forced to contend with feelings of 
conflict created by demands that contrasted with organizational goals or individuals’ roles in 
helping to meet these goals. Overall, they felt negatively challenged to meet organizational 
outcomes.   
 
For instance, Poverty Action and Relief Center (PARC) developed and implemented a 
job-training program based on the increased focus of funders and policy on job preparation and 
creation after the 2008 economic recession. The leadership at PARC believed that, as a poverty 
relief organization, they were well positioned to respond to this broader call to help people re-
enter the workforce, which also had the widespread backing of both government and private

sources. Consequently, the organization established a goal of making 1000 individuals “job 
ready” and implemented a job-training program to meet this objective. However, for the staff 
responsible for securing funding and/or executing the program, the program often felt more 
focused on meeting numbers rather than providing quality job training which, for one staff 
member, made her feel like her job was simply to “push numbers as well” (development staff 
member – leadership staff member level). She went on to describe the program as “wrong on so 
many levels…a top-down failure in leadership. We should have never set this arbitrary goal 
with the strange number without having worked on it [as a staff]. It’s the tail wagging the dog.”  
 
Stage 3. 
 
Experiencing job related challenges.  
 
For many participants, the modification process that occurred as a result of the micro 
level discord experienced contributed to what staff experienced as significant barriers to success. 
These challenges included experiencing disconnect, feeling disenfranchised in role, lacking 
control, lacking clarity, and facing barriers to success, and the challenges were often described in 
relation to the internal organizational culture. For the participants, most of whom did not occupy 
the highest of executive levels, (CEOs, for example), they experienced feeling both disconnected 
from decision-making processes and procedures, and discontented with the ways in which 
hierarchical staff structures contributed to the creation of what was described as impenetrable 
silos.  
 
Staff also described lacking both control and clarity regarding decisions making 
processes and the everyday practices and procedures that governed their jobs. This lack of clarity 
and control often forced staff members to engage in negotiation processes that were aimed at 
managing the ramifications of decisions or processes by which they were unable to directly 

142 
engage in. Finally, a sense that the staffs’ modification of thought processes and behaviors 
towards the micro level discord often resulted in significant barriers to success in their role. 
Though different depending on the position and role, almost all of the study participants 
identified barriers they believed kept them from being as successful as they would like to be or 
knew they could be.  
Experiencing Difficulties in Working Towards Mission  
 
The conceptual model of discordance expounded upon in this chapter illuminates how 
organizations enter into a state of discordance at varying levels because of the relationship of 
dependency and control they are in with external stakeholders. The ways in which this 
discordance materializes, the varying responses that emerge to counter this dissonance, and the 
challenges to success that staff face as result of this process were explained. In doing so, the 
model demonstrates how a range of difficulties emerge throughout organizations that inhibit 
them from being able to always work in ways that wholly support the mission and goals to the 
fullest extent.  
 
It is clear from the data that staff at all levels work very hard to ensure quality services 
for clients and, regardless of the range of challenges experienced, passion and commitment to 
helping the organization meet its missions and goals remains a driving factor in continuing to do 
the work. Many staff described their commitment to the clients and the social issue the 
organization responded more broadly, as the reason for enduring the challenges that were 
believed to be inherent to the nature of nonprofit and social justice work. However, despite their 
incessant drive to continue to support the well-being of clients in best, most empowering ways 
possible, the data also revealed that the discordance experienced by the organizations sometimes 
keeps the organization from fully realizing their missions and goals. This does not imply that the 

143 
organizations are not successful in their efforts or that they are drifting from their intended 
objectives. Rather, it indicates that because of the dependent relationship that the organizations 
have with external stakeholders, which often dictates much of what they can and cannot do, 
meeting their missions to the fullest of their abilities, or in the ways they want to, becomes an 
enduring challenge characterized by disconnect.  
 
In the case of HOAC, the organization was engaged in a rapid and continued growth 
process that expanded the organization from a regional nonprofit to a statewide player in the 
field of homeless services. Staff size increased from approximately 50 employees to upwards of 
350 staff members in a period of three or so years. This growth, which was one of the responses 
to the dissonance that the organization faced from existing in a relationship of dependency with 
external stakeholders, had a dramatic impact on all levels of the organization. In many cases 
programs were extended beyond capacity in order to handle the growth. New emphases were 
added to the roster of existing services, particularly in the realm of veteran homelessness and, as 
many staff noted, other organizational priorities suffered.  
 
The mission on the agency was focused on ending homelessness, and everything they did 
was in service to this mission. However, given the constant state of transition and development 
the organization was engaged in, staff questioned whether or not HOAC was, in fact, fully 
working towards it mission and goals in the ways they intended. For one staff member, the idea 
of “things looking good on paper” was the driving force behind all decisions. In other words, 
decisions might seem appropriate or advantageous in theory, but in practice the implementation 
often proved far more complicated. She stated, “I just feel like…you could talk about the people 
we serve all you want but go work with them and that's a whole other ball game (executive staff 
member – executive staff member level)”.  

144 
 
While this type of approach was never seen as one that was used to be intentionally 
injurious to the organization, the implications were, nevertheless, often felt to be just that.  One 
executive team member explained this by providing the following example related to the rapid 
adoption of veterans services:  
“ The agency is like “woo hoo!” But then you just start seeing the ramifications…We 
have a lot of veterans falling out of housing. The staff turnover rate was 
phenomenal…we have a huge turnover…and so what happens is the veteran is like 
“whatever.” You know? Because relationships are important in this work…so if [a client] 
has five case managers within two months, they’re going to be like, “what is this stupid 
case management?”…They’re not going to have that person that they feel comfortable 
going to all of the time (staff member – executive staff level).  
 
This illustration provides insight into how the organization exists within a state of discordance, 
and illuminates the challenges in fully realizing mission and goals that ensue.  The relationship 
of dependency on external stakeholders led HOAC to engage in unremitting growth that resulted 
in a dramatic organizational expansion.  
 
The availability of funding and the changing landscape of the field forced the 
organization into a state of macro level discord where responding to these factors was considered 
obligatory. As the process of expansion began, a response on the part of staff members took 
place, which included, but was not limited to, an intense focus on outputs. This, in turn, created a 
micro level state of disharmony where staff felt forced to accept mediocrity in their work, to 
balance many competing demands, and to bear a substantial burden since outcomes for clients 
could rarely be fully met. As a result of all of these processes, staff faced substantial barriers to 
being successful in their roles. In the example provided by the executive staff member, this led to 
high staff turnover and clients not being provided with the high quality services the organization 
intended to deliver. She described the clients as being negatively impacted by this whole process. 
Since the primary purpose of the organization is to provide services to homeless individuals, 

145 
when breakdowns in the minutiae of the programs and services occur in the ways that this 
participant described, working to realize the mission in the most comprehensive way possible 
becomes difficult.  
Chapter Summary  
 
This chapter described the types of internal and environmental contexts social justice 
nonprofits exist within and the effects of these environments on the approaches and practices of 
the organizations. The findings indicate that the external environment plays a significant role in 
dictating the kinds of approaches the organization takes to meet its missions and goals, and the 
practices they employ on a daily basis are intricately connected to these approaches. These 
approaches and practices take place, albeit differently, at both the macro and micro levels of the 
organizations. 
 
In describing their experiences with the approaches and practices embrace by their 
organizations, staff alluded to the emergence of a state of discordance that permeates the 
organization. This discord was described as occurring at both the macro and micro level, and 
participants described having experienced several barriers to success as a result. Furthermore, in 
discussing the ways that they felt challenged by the organizations’ approaches and practices, it 
became evident the existence of macro and micro discord potentially limits the organizations’ 
abilities to meet their missions and goals to the fullest extent desired. 
Pre and Post Analysis Impressions  
 
The researcher held certain impressions of the organizational processes taking place prior 
to beginning the study. These impressions informed the research questions and the study 
procedures. The primary concept of interest was managerialism, and the researcher was sensitive 
to how managerialist processes and practices were taking place in each of the organizations in 

146 
the study. Table 6.1 contains pre and post study impressions of the researcher. The a priori 
column indicates the impressions the researcher had of managerialism, as well as how it was 
might be manifested within an organizational context. The post analysis column indicates the 
reality of managerialism within organization compared to the researcher’s initial impressions.

CHAPTER 7 
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS  
 
This dissertation study is guided by the assumption that there are inherent differences in 
the purpose and function of nonprofit and for-profit organizations (Anheier, 2005). As such, it is 
questionable whether the adoption of approaches and practices rooted in the for-profit sector are 
the most appropriate means for organizations focused on social justice and social change to meet 
their intended missions and goals. Nevertheless, nonprofit organizations of all kinds and sizes are 
compelled, for a variety of reasons, to embrace the principles and practices of managerialism 
(Maier, et.al, 2016) and doing so has become conventional.  
 
Research on nonprofits becoming more “business-like” in their structures and functions 
has garnered considerable interest from the academic community in recent years, particularly 
among scholars in the fields of organizational and management studies. Nevertheless, despite the 
proliferation of research on varying aspects of this topic, an understanding of how managerialism 
is operationalized by organizations and the implications of this trend, remains an underdeveloped 
area of inquiry (Maier, et.al, 2016). With this in mind, this research sought examine the 
processes by which nonprofit embrace and operationalize managerialist approaches and 
practices, and the effects of this trend on the staff, clients, and organizations more generally. 
Doing so within the context of social justice nonprofit organizations expressly moves the 
research beyond the realm of organizational and management studies into the field of social 
welfare.  
 
Furthermore, the emphasis on social justice organizations extends the examination of the 
effects of managerialism beyond a focus on internal organization structures and processes to one 
that assesses how managerialism impacts the relationships organizations have with larger social 

148 
change efforts. Since one of the goals of social justice organizations is to mitigate the effects of 
systemic inequality on disenfranchised populations, analysis of the consequences of 
managerialism within this specific context provides a framework for beginning to examine how 
the adoption of managerialist practices and approaches may inadvertently contribute to the 
maintenance of inequality. 
 
Rather than focusing explicitly on managerialism during interviews with participants, a 
more exploratory approach to data collection was taken. In other words, participants were never 
explicitly asked about the how they understood managerialism, or whether they believed their 
organizations were operating in ways akin to for-profits. Instead, a range of questions were 
developed (see appendix B) to encourage participants to talk openly and honestly about their 
roles and responsibilities, their experiences working for their organization, and their 
understandings of organization’s missions and goals. This was an intentional approach informed 
by the perspectives of constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014). Although the researcher 
was sensitive to the concept of managerialism throughout data collection, avoiding the concept 
directly created allowed space for it to emerge organically in the conversations. In other words, 
participants were free to describe their experiences in whatever way felt appropriate, which 
meant that if managerialism was important or relevant it would likely emerge from the 
conversation. This did, in fact, prove to be the case as most of the participants referenced some 
element of managerialism during the interviews.  
 
Approaching the research from an environmental perspective meant that the study was 
not limited to simply exploring managerialism. Rather, the participants at each organization were 
able to reflect upon and construct their experiences working at their organizations in ways that 
were complex, highly personal, and unique to the individual. As such, a holistic picture of each 

149 
organization emerged, one that not only reflected how managerialism is operationalized, but also 
enabled the distinctive nature of each organization and their shared experiences and challenges to 
become visible.  
The Environmental Contexts of Social Justice Nonprofits  
 
Existing In a State of Discordance   
 
In accordance with the theory of Neoinstitutionalism, which states that organizations are 
influenced by their external environments to adopt certain processes or procedures, this research 
revealed that the organizations in this study were engaged in complex processes of adaptation 
focused on ensuring both survival and vitality. This is not unique to these organizations, as most 
nonprofits find themselves beholden to external stakeholders secure funds and to establish 
legitimacy to ensure their survival. However, what emerged from the data was a more complex 
and multifarious picture than is typically depicted in the research examining the relationship of 
nonprofits organizations to their external environments.  
 
The study revealed that nonprofit organizations are not only highly influenced by their 
environments (DiMaggio & Powell, 1991), but that this relationship is characterized by a 
dependency that has a significant impact on all aspects of the organization. In other words, 
participants at all levels of the organizations described their organizations as being exceedingly 
reliant upon the whims of funders and policy makers. This dependency was explained in ways 
that illuminated a sense of uncertainty and doubt that permeated the organization from the top to 
the bottom. Furthermore, it contributed to the organizations existing in a perpetual state of 
discordance, which ultimately came to characterize the environment within which these 
organizations existed. Subsequently, a conceptual model of discordance was developed to better 
understand this unique environmental context. The model not only illustrates the states of 

150 
discordance these organizations exist within, but also illuminates the approaches and practices 
the organizations embrace as a result of this unique environment. Furthermore, it establishes the 
specific ways that managerialism emerges and is adopted as a result of the organization’s 
environment.  
 
The model suggests that as a result of the highly dependent relationship organizations 
have with external stakeholders, discordance at varying organizational levels occurs. As chapter 
7 explains this is most commonly understood as a sense of tension between what the 
organization and its staff have to do in order for the relationship to remain in good standing, and 
what is believed to be best for the organization. This tension results in decisions that are made at 
the macro and micro levels based on what the organization believes it needs to do to continue 
working towards meeting its mission and goals, and what individual staff need to do to continue 
their work in ways that feel professionally and personally acceptable (this is described in varied 
ways among the participants). These decisions result in a range of response processes designed 
manage the tension that arises. However, as the model suggests, these response processes often 
lead to more experiences of discord rather than harmony, ultimately resulting in staff at varying 
levels facing multiple barriers to doing their jobs in ways that they deem to be successful.  
 
At the macro level, these response processes consist of adapting to the changing needs of 
the organization, embracing a corporatized approach, engaging with organizational growth 
processes, focusing on outputs, and striving to maintain organizational image. At the micro level, 
the processes take the shape of accepting mediocrity in one’s work, balancing competing 
demands, and bearing an emotional burden.  
 
Managerialism As a Response to Discord 
 

151 
 
Although participants were not asked explicitly about it, the data confirmed that 
managerialism was occurring in four primary ways within the organizations: 1) embracing a 
corporatized approach; 2) engaging in and perceiving organizational growth; 3) focusing on 
outputs and; 4) maintaining image (Maier & Meyer, 2009). These findings are aligned with other 
studies showing evidence of nonprofits for adopting a corporatized approach and increasing 
focus on outputs (Alexander, 2009; Dart, 2004), and confirm the Neoinstitutional thesis that 
organizations will adopt practices and procedures that are defined by external stakeholders as the 
norm. 
 
Staff members did not use the term managerialism to describe these indicators, nor did 
they refer to any of these processes as the organization becoming more “business-like” in its 
function or orientation. Rather, they described these tactics as higher-level organizational 
approaches that are taken in order to respond to and manage the macro level discord that ensues 
from the relationship of dependency the organizations have with external stakeholders. These 
approaches emerged as a result of the discord the organizations were experiencing, and were 
viewed as the means by which the state of dissonance could be successfully navigated and 
managed. In other words, embracing managerialist approaches was done with the best of 
intentions and in direct response to the organizational environment of discord. Regardless, in 
many cases participants described the opposite effect occurring. These efforts to respond to the 
macro state of discord resulted not in successful management of the conflict, but in the 
emergence of additional discord at the micro level.  
 
To navigate discord at the micro levels, much of which was described by participants as 
occurring because of the onset of managerialism, another set of responses were employed. 
However, in this case, the responses were concentrated more heavily on the individual actions 

152 
that staff members needed to engage in order to navigate the discordance while continuing to 
their jobs. Many participants, particularly those at lower levels of the staff structure, described 
instances where they believed the response processes they had to engage in, accepting mediocrity 
in their work, for example, negatively affected service quality and clients’ experiences. Although 
they did not describe these challenges in terms of managerialism specifically, since the response 
processes resulted from the practices of managerialism employed by the organization, it can be 
reasonably concluded that managerialism has an adverse effect at the micro level as well. These 
findings are similar to those reported in other studies, such as the research conducted by 
Alexander (1999) and Alexander, et.al (1999).  
Meeting Missions and Goals  
 
The final stage of the conceptual model of discordance indicates the barriers to success 
faced by staff, which were seen as resulting from the organization having to function in an 
environment characterized by discord. These barriers were experienced by staff at all levels 
(although not every staff member experienced each of the barriers identified), and were 
described as experiencing disconnect, feeling disenfranchised, and lacking control and clarity 
about organizational decisions and processes. For participants that described experiencing these 
barriers to success, the challenges were often discussed in relation to the organization’s overall 
mission and goals. Staff members felt that the barriers they experienced to meeting success, as 
they defined it, ultimately contributed to the organization not being able to fully realize their 
missions and goals in the ways intended.  
 
This is not to say that the organizations were failing to meet their missions. Rather, it 
infers that the challenges staff experienced, many of which led to participants feeling like they 
were unable to meet their full potential related to their specific roles and responsibilities, 

153 
contributed to the organization not being to realize their missions to the fullest extent possible. 
That is to say, staff viewed their success as inherently connected to the success of the 
organization. When one failed to achieve in the ways desired, so did the other. These findings 
point to the ways in which the experiences of staff are inherently connected to the abilities of the 
organizations to maximize their potential related to meeting goals and achieving missions. This 
was an unanticipated finding that presents opportunities for future research examining the 
relationship between staff experience and organizational success.  
 
The conceptual model describing how these organizations exist in a state of discordance 
also suggests that while the approaches and practices of social justice nonprofits are intrinsically 
rooted in the effort to maintain a focus on mission and goals in service to this purpose, many of 
these processes ultimately serve to encumber their efforts. As such, the findings indicated that 
the organizations might be inadvertently working against these aims. Although the organizations 
were never intentionally working to destabilize their mission related efforts, in many ways the 
critical relationship of dependency that the organizations had with external stakeholders served 
to do so. This occurred differently within each of the organizations in the study depending on 
organizational size, structure, and staff make up. Nevertheless, this destabilization was evident, 
to some degree, in each of the organizations. However, as the data reveals, they are often left 
with little in the way of other options, as the relationship of dependency significantly restricts the 
organizations from working in ways that they believe to be more aligned with achieving mission 
related outcomes. 
 
This study was explicitly concerned with advancing greater understanding of the 
environmental contexts within which social justice nonprofits operate, and how managerialism 
emerges and is operationalized within these specific contexts. In exploring these questions the 

154 
ways in which the practices of SJNOs support or hinder the organization’s missions and goals 
became evident. Processes such as engaging in funding diversification due to the precariousness 
of existing funding sources, for example, were seen as effective means by which to continue to 
support the organization’s mission. However, as many staff noted, there were additional 
processes or practices that emerged from these types of efforts that were seen as resulting in 
significant unintended consequences for staff and the organization overall.  
 
These unintended consequences can be understood best as a conflict of values. This 
conflict is characterized by a disharmonious relationship between meeting the needs of clients 
and communities with dignity and support informed by a set of professional values (the social 
work code of ethics, for example), and a set of values imposed by external stakeholders that is 
based on expediency and efficiency informed by a for-profit perspective. As the data indicates, 
the latter not only directly contradicts the former in certain ways, but not adhering this particular 
set of values is seen as threatening to the organization’s very survival. As such, the organizations 
are left with little alternative, and the cycle of discord identified in the conceptual model 
continues.  
Persisting In Spite of Challenges 
 
As this study suggests, existing in a state of discordance contributes to an environment 
where social justice nonprofits are forced to contend with a range of macro and micro level 
challenges. While these difficulties do not prohibit the organizations from meeting their goals, 
the data indicates that they experience several challenges that impede them from meeting their 
goals to the fullest extent. However, the data also suggests that these challenges do not define 
these organizations, they are simply a part of the reality of doing the very difficult work of trying 
to improve the lives of individuals and communities affected by systemic inequality.  

155 
 
Although participants frequently recounted the difficult experiences they had due to their 
organization’s reliance on external stakeholders and the relationship of dependency that ensued, 
they also discussed the ways they continued to positively impact clients, regardless of the 
challenges they encountered. While they often believed they could do more and wanted to think 
about ways to do so, they were also confident that the organizations were effectively contributing 
to lessening the impact of the overall social problem they addressed (homelessness, poverty, and 
aging for low-income older adults). Furthermore, while the challenges identified were described 
as difficult to navigate at times, they were not seen as deterrents. Rather, they were understood as 
a part of the reality of doing the difficult work of caring for others. Regardless of the difficulties 
faced, staff acknowledged that it was still possible to maintain high standards and to keep the 
well being of clients at the forefront of their work. Although this was not always easy for the 
organization as a whole given the range of challenges they faced resulting from the relationship 
of dependency with external stakeholders, staff felt capable of doing so as individuals. Their 
commitment to the work was evident and was seen as a driving factor in working through the 
challenges they experienced, irrespective of how insurmountable some of the difficulties seemed 
at times. This is a testament to the individuals as well as the organizations overall who, despite 
existing in a paradoxical state shaped by needing to persevere in the face of persistent 
discordance, continue to successfully work towards meeting their missions. 
Implications For Future Research  
 
This study increases our understanding of how the environments within which nonprofit 
organizations operate contribute to the organizations’ abilities to fully meet their missions and 
goals in ways that they deem appropriate for the clients they are responsible to. The findings 
were complex and multidimensional, and led to the creation of a conceptual model that can 

156 
inform further research aimed at understanding how managerialism emerges and is 
operationalized, as well as the potential impact of this trend on organizations and larger efforts at 
mitigating social problems.   
 
While staff often talked about how they believed the approaches and practices of their 
organizations impacted clients, the interviews tended to remain focused on the organizational 
processes and the impact they had on participants. For some, particularly frontline staff members 
who worked regularly with clients, their experiences could not be divorced from that of the 
clients, and so the conversation naturally included their perspectives on client impact. However, 
other staff members did not speak as explicitly on the subject, either because it did not come up 
as part of the conversation or because their role as a higher-level staff member disconnected 
them from the day-to-day interaction with clients.  
 
As such, this research provides a somewhat limited understanding of how the 
environment within which social justice nonprofit organizations or managerialism operates 
impacts client outcomes. This presents an opportunity for future research to expand upon some 
of the insights garnered in this study in an effort to more fully understand how clients are 
affected by environmentally induced organizational processes. Furthermore, since frontline staff 
were the participants most likely to make the connections to client experiences, research focusing 
explicitly on the experiences of these of employees at social justice nonprofits would be 
appropriate. This also represents an opportunity to continue to bridge the study of organizations 
with the field of social welfare, as client outcomes are a primary concern social of social welfare 
research.   
Implications For Organizational Practice  

157 
 
This research has considerable implications for practice in the fields of social welfare, 
nonprofit management, and other professions where social justice is a primary concern. The data 
indicated that much of the concern regarding challenges the organizations faced as a result of 
existing in a state of discordance was related to a conflict of values. Although they did not 
always use this language explicitly, many staff described their experiences with the 
organization’s approaches or practices in ways that indicated a compromise of their professional 
values.  
 
Research in this area may compel external stakeholders to treat their relationship with 
organizations differently, or to take the social imperative these organizations have and the values 
that accompany it into greater account. However, it is not likely that this needle will be quickly 
moved, so it remains up to the organizations, particularly leadership, to pay active attention to 
how the value systems between the organizations and their external environments may be 
competing, and the unintended consequences that may arise from this process.  
 
All of the organizations in the study had, or were about to engage, in a formal strategic 
planning process, indicating that planning and reflection was a valued part of the organizational 
culture. However, understanding the conflicting nature of the competing sets of values might 
need to go beyond engaging formal strategic planning or other processes where staff is able to 
provide input. Instead, it necessitates a paradigm shift on the part of the organization to include a 
process of continual reflection and feedback focused explicitly on understanding and navigating 
the competing set of values, and approaching this shift from the range of staff perspectives 
represented, not just those at the top of the hierarchy. It is through this type of process that 
organizations focused on increasing equity for disenfranchised individuals and communities will 

158 
be able to achieve this goal internally as well, conceivably leading to greater success in meeting 
their missions and goals.
