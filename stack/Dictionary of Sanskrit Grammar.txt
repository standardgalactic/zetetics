FOREWORD
The first edition of "A Dictionary o f Sanskrit Grammar" by Mahamahopa- 
dhyaya Professor Kashinath Vasudev Abhyankar was published in 1961 as 
Gaekwad's Oriental Series No. 134 by the Oriental Institute under the authority of 
the M. S. University of Baroda. In 1977 its second revised edition by MM. Professor 
Kashinath Vasudev Abhyankar and Dr. Jayadevbhai Mohanlal Shukla was publish­
ed with an addition of "about three hundred new entries" (Preface to the second 
edition by Dr. J. M. Shukla) as Gaekwad’s Oriental Series No. 134. Within a very 
short span of time the edition went out of print indicating its importance and utility 
as a reference-book.
There has been an incessant demand for this book and we are happy to bring 
out its third edition.
I tender my most sincere feelings of gratitude to Professor Dr. M. N. Desai, 
Vice-Chancellor, M. S. University of Baroda for his keen interest and for providing 
facilities for the reprint. I am grateful to Professor Ramlal Parikh, Vice-Chancellor, 
Gujarat Vidyapeeth, Ahmedabad for his interest in this work by persuading the 
Navajivan Press to accept the printing of this work, "A Dictionary of Sanskrit 
Grammar" by photo-offset process. We are thankful to Shri Jitendra T. Desai, 
General Manager, Navajivan Press, Ahmedabad, for his cooperation and for 
expediting the printing. I am also thankful to Shri P. N. Srivastav, Manager, M. S. 
University of Baroda Press and also Shri N. N. Shah, Technical Assistant and my 
other colleagues in the Oriental Institute for cooperation and toy expediting the 
publication of this work.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
Within a few years after the publication of ‘ A  Dictionary of Sanskrit 
Grammar \ the book became out of print. 
With continuous inquiries pouring in 
about its availability it was thought necessary that a second edition should be 
made available to the serious students of Sanskrit learning. Hence, a request was 
sent to the Director, Oriental institute, Baroda for the issue of a second edition. 
He readily accepted the request.
Prof. K . V. Abhyankar, my revered teacher asked me to revise all the entries, 
add a few more references to the existing entries and further add about three 
hundred new entries. 
I readily accepted his suggestion. The new entries are 
mostly of the nature of semantic terms.
Before the printing of the book was taken up a tragic event took place. 
Prof. Abhyankar, with Mrs. Abhyankar, their two brilliant young grand children, 
and an aged servant, met with an unnatural and tragic death. 
Sanskrit scholars 
in India and the West were shocked at this unprecedented vagary of Destiny.
Prof. Abhyankar was the most authoritative of the grammarians active in 
India. 
He enriched research in Vyakaranasastra by his scholarly works like 
Vakyapadlya, Mahabhasyadlpika, Paribhasasamgraha and others which are 
indispensable to students of grammar.
I express my deep and sincere sense of gratitude to Dr. A . N. Jani, the 
present Director, Oriental Institute, Baroda, for planning the completion of 
printing of this book in a record time of about ten months. 
But for his zest and 
vigour the work would not have been completed so soon.
I am particularly thankful to Shri Siddhartha Y . Wakankar, Research 
Officer of the Oriental Institute, for scrupulously correcting the proofs of this 
work.
I thank the mthorities and workers of the M. S. University Press for 
expediting the pri ting of the present work.

INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST EDITION
Object of this Dictionary
No apology is needed for undertaking the compilation of the present 
‘ Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar’, which, although concise, is expected to meet 
the needs of Sanskrit scholars and research students of Vyakarana and other 
Sastras by serving as a useful reference book in their study of, and research 
work in, any branch of Sanskrit learning. 
The many independent treatises in 
the several Sastras and the learned commentaries upon them, as also 
the 
commentaries on classical poems and dramas, are, in fact, full of grammatical 
explanations of words and constructions, involving a liberal use of grammatical 
expressions and technical terms at several places. 
The elementary knowledge 
of grammar 
which a scholar of Sanskrit possesses, is not found 
sufficient 
for his understanding fully the grammatical references in these books, especially 
so at present, when the practice of sending young boys to the Sanskrit 
Pathasalas to study the standard classical works with commentaries along with 
some standard elementary treatises on grammar, has already stopped. 
The 
number of Sanskrit Panditas and Sastrins, who had to obtain a sound footing in 
grammar before they undertook the study of the higher texts of the several Sastras, 
and who, therefore, could be consulted by young scholars and research workers 
in the several Sastras, has also diminished considerably. 
The usual Sanskrit 
Dictionaries such as those of Monier Williams, V. S. Apte and others are found 
of no avail in supplying explanations of the grammatical technique which confronts 
modem scholars at every step in their critical reading of the several Sanskrit texts. 
Under these circumstances, it is only the technical dictionaries of the type of the 
present ‘Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar ’ that can render a valuable assistance to 
scholars and research workers in their reading of the higher Sanskrit texts in the 
Several Sastras,
Beginnings of Sanskrit Grammar
Every science has necessarily its own terminology and a special vocabulary. 
The remark is true with respect to Sanskrit Grammar or Vyakaranasastra which 
has developed as a science during the last two thousand years and has got several 
technical terms and numerous words with a special grammatical significance. 
The origin of grammar can well-nigh be traced to the Period of the Brahmanas
i.e. about 1000 B.C., when Vedic scholars began to discuss the meaning of the 
inspired Vedic hymns by carefully showing disconnected, the words of the Vedic 
hymns and noting down the differences in accents as also the changes caused by 
their coalescence in the continuous recital or the Samhitapa|ha. 
They also 
tried to explain the sense of the Vedic words by tracing them back to the roots 
of suitable senses and laid down rules for their proper and correct pronunciation. 
These three pursuits viz. 
(a) the discussion of the features of the Pada text,

( b ) the derivation of words, and (c) directions regarding the proper pronuncia­
tion of the Vedic words, were carried on with vigour with a view to preserving 
the Vedic texts intact, and the treatises dealing with these three branches were 
respectively called by the names Pratisakhya, Nirukta and Sik$a, all of which 
could rightly be called Vyakarana or Grammar, as they were devoted to determining 
the correct words as distinguished from the incorrect ones. 
Although a 
number of .books were written by Vedic scholars in these three branches, not 
more than five or six Pratisakhya works, a solitary Nirukta work, and a few 
$ik$a works are the only available works at present.
Development of Sanskrit Grammar
In course of time, on the analogy of the derivation of words, an analysis 
of the word into its constituent elements such as the base, the affix, the augments 
and the modifications, was undertaken by grammarians. 
This separation of the 
different elements of a word constituted Vyakarana or grammar, which was deve­
loped as an art by ancient grammarians like Apisali, Sakatayana and others before 
Panini. 
It was Panini who carried it to perfection, and his work, the Astadhyayl, 
compact yet exhaustive, and laconic yet clear, is simply a marvellous product 
of art by a man of amazing intelligence. 
As a result, the works on grammar by 
all ancient scholars who flourished before Panini disappeared in course of time 
leaving only a few quotations behind them. 
Panini 'was followed by a number 
of grammarians who wrote popular treatises on grammar, based, no doubt, on 
Panini’s srammar, some of which, in their turn came to have auxiliary works, 
glosses and explanatory commentaries. 
These different treatises, written by 
Sarvavarman, Candragomin, Devanandin, Palyaklrti Sakatayana, Hemacan- 
dra, Kramadlsvara, Jumaranandin, Supadma and others with their auxiliary 
works and commentaries, came to be looked upon as different systems of grammar. 
These treatises present two kinds of treatment: some of them are arranged in 
Sutras in the same manner as the Aftadhyayi of Panini which treats one after 
another the several grammatical elements such as technical terms, padas of roots, 
case-relations, compound words, krt affixes, taddhita affixes, substitutes, accents 
and euphonic changes; while others give a topic-wise treatment following in that 
respect the ancient grammarians before Panini such as Indra, Vedic Sakatayana 
and others who treated one after another the different topics of grammar such 
as the euphonic changes, declension, conjugation, compound formation, nouns 
derived from roots, nouns derived from nouns and the like. 
The 
special 
feature of all these grammars was that they entirely omitted the Vedic peculiari­
ties and accents.
Sanskrit Grammar as a Science
The subject of Sanskrit grammar was first treated as a science by the two 
epoch-making grammarians, first by Katyayana, a few centuries after Panini, 
and then by Patanjali, the exponent of Katyayana, who lived in the second 
century B.C. 
It was carried to perfection by the stalwart grammarian Bhartrhari 
of the fifth century A,D, 
Later grammarians, prominent among whom were

xi
Jayaditya, Vamana, Kaiyata, Haradatta, Bhattoji, Kondabhatta and Nagesa, 
developed by their substantial contributions, the work of Panini as a science to 
such an extent that the number of smaller and greater works well nigh rose to 
eight hundred and that of the authors to four hundred. 
The grammar of Panini, 
"which is looked upon as the standard oneat present gives about a hundred technical 
terms, more than two hundred suffixes, about two thousand primary roots and 
more than five thousand special words arranged in more than two hundred and 
fifty classes according to the special grammatical peculiarities shown by .each 
class. 
The number of indepedent primary words, besides these five thousand 
special words, if roughly estimated, may exceed even twenty-five thousdan. 
Besides these primary roots, primary nouns, affixes and technical terms in the 
different Sastras, there is a vast number of secondary roots and secondary nouns, 
which is rather impossible even to be approximately determined.
Nature and Scope of this Dictionary
The preparation of a comprehensive dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar, 
a subject which has been developed fully by Sanskrit Grammarians for the last 
two thousand„years, is certainly a stupendous work which can only bs done by 
a band of grammarians who have got a sound footing in the subject. 
In the light 
of what has been said above, the present dictionary is only an honest and humble 
attempt in that direction, made by the compiler who was inspired to-undertake 
this rather arduous venture by his close study of the subject for more than sixty 
years according to the traditional method of the East, combined with the critical 
and comparative method of the West. 
As the work was done single-handed, 
and finished within a limited time with a view to making it available to students 
and scholars of Sanskrit at as early a date as possible, the number of books con­
sulted was a limited' one. 
The number of entries is more than four thousand 
out of which the important ones are in the form of short articles supplying very 
briefly the necessary information from the different sources with quotations from 
or references to the original works. 
All the standard works in grammar have 
been carefully consulted including the available Pratisakhya works, the Mahabha- 
sya, the Kasika, the Vakyapadiya, the Siddhanta-Kaumudi and others. 
The 
Katantra, the Sakatayana, the Jainendra, the Haima and other grammars, as also 
the different Paribhasa works have been consulted at important places. 
Minor 
works and commentaries are not consulted as. the important words and topics 
occurring therein have been mos.ly included here on account of their occurrence 
in the major works. 
Atention is, of course, paid to grammaical importance and 
significance, and only such words and such senses of them as have a grammatical 
significance, have been included in the present dictionary along with affixes, aug­
ments, substitutes and technical terms mostly given in Panini’s grammar. 
Names 
of authors and books, printed as well as found in a manuscript form, have been 
included as far as practicable in the present work. 
A  scrupulous attention has 
been paid to the Pratisakhya works, the Mahabhasya and the Kasika which are 
looked upon as supremely authoritative in the, field of Sanskrit grammar. 
It 
must be admitted that the scholarly index works of Dr. Bothlingk and Dr. Renou

were found very useful in providing references to standard grammar 
works. 
The abbreviations for the titles of books consulted and those of grammatical 
terms are given separately at the beginning of the present* Dictionary of Sanskrit 
Grammar ’. 
Names of books and authors have been sometimes given in the 
Roman script and sometimes in the Devanagari script.
Conclusion
• 
Acknowledgements are due to Mr. M. N. Chapekar, Aryasanskriti Mudrana- 
laya, Poona, who has given ample co-operation in getting this Dictionary printed 
in the shortest possible time. 
For facility of printing, accents of Vedic passages 
and words are not shown, nor italics haye been used for Sanskrit terms written 
in the Roman script nor the breaking of a word at the end of a line is done scrupu­
lously at the end of a syllable or a constituent part. 
In spite of all possible 
care, some slips have crept in for which the indulgence of the reader is craved. 
It is expected that Sanskrit scholars will make full use of this work and offer their 
valuable suggestions for future undertakings of this type.
A  sincere sense of gratitude must be conveyed to Dr. Bhogilal J. Sandesara, 
the Director of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, at whose initiative the project 
of this ‘Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar,’ undertaken some years ago, but post­
poned from time to time, was not only pursued with vigour, but completed and 
turned into a volume in the Gaekwad Oriental Series.

HINTS FOR THE USE OF THIS D ICTIO N ARY <
1. 
Words in this dictionary are arranged in the serial order of the Sanskrit 
alphabet which is current everywhere, viz. 
the fourteen vowels beginning with 
ar and ending with an, and then the thirtythree consonants consisting of the five 
guttural, the five.palatal, the five cerebral, the five dental and the five labial conson­
ants and then the four semi-vowels and the four sibilants, 
aj is taken as a com- 
bination of f  and %, and ^ as one of ^  and
2. 
Words are given in their noun-base (Jtr%tn%R) such as 
am*, 
etc., without thie addition of any case affix.
3. 
At places of option where any one of the anusvara and the parasayarna 
could be used, the anusvara is consistently used, and a place after the vowels and 
before the consonants is assigned to it in the alphabetical order. 
For example, 
the words containing 
anusvara such 
as 
spot, 
Hfrt, HcTPT, 
HstQRoi 
g-ga, g-ferr etc., are all placed after e and before Bfj
etc.
4. 
Each word entered, has got only one paragraph assigned to it, although 
the explanation of the word may cover sometimes a full page or more.
5. 
The meaning or meanings o f a word are given immediately after it, 
and therefore no capital letter is used at the beginning of the word with which 
each meaning begins.
6. 
The various senses of a word are given one after another with serial 
numbers placed before them. 
The several senses of a word are arranged as far 
as possible in their chronological order of origin.
7. 
The various senses are usually illustrated with quotations from standard 
authors with full references as far as possible,. 
From among the Pratisakhya 
works, the RkpratiSdkhya is generally quoted, while from among the numerous 
grammar works, the Mahabha$ya and the Kasika are quoted profusely.
8. 
The first figure in references, which is generally the Roman one, refers 
to the main section such as the adhyaya or the Kanda or the Patala, while the 
next one refers to the subordinate sections, such as the stanza or the Sutra or the 
like. 
When there are three figures they refer to the adhyaya, the pada and the 
Sutra in the case of Pacini, and to the Mandala, the Sukta and the stanza in 
the case of the Rksamhita
9. 
When a particular form is illustrated, the illustration begins with the 
abbreviation ‘ e.g. 
while usually, when the sense given, is illustrated, the explan­
ation or the quotation in Sanskrit begins with the abbreviation *cf\

xiv
11. 
As the senses given in such dictionaries are more or less technical or 
conventional, the literal or the usual sense of the words is given only when it is 
allied to the conventional sense.
12. 
Sanskrit words are generally given in the Devanagarl script; when, 
however, the Roman script is used, 
the diacritical marks which are in current 
use at present, are employed.
10. 
Each of the different senses of a word dr of the uses of a word in
different ways, begins with a separate number ( 1 ), ( 2 ), (3 ), etc,;, when, however, 
the same sense is given with different shades of it, by words which are practically 
synonymous, no separate numbers are given, the shades of sense being, separated 
by a colon, or by a comma.

element of the anusvara became 
more prevalent later on in Palj, 
Prakrit, Apabhramsa and in the 
spoken 
modern 
languages while

the consonantal element became 
more predominant in classical Sans­
krit.

alphabet; traditional enu­
meration of phonetically indepen­
dent letters generally beginning with 
the vowel a (sr). 
Although the 
number of letters and the order in 
which they are stated differ in 
different 
treatises, still, qualita­
tively they are much the same. 
The Sivasulras, on which Panini’s 
_ grammar' is based, enumerate 9 
vowels, 4 semi-vowels, twenty-five 
class-consonants and 4 sibilants. 
The nine vowels are five simple 
vowels or monothoegs ( 
) as
they are called in ancient treatises,
. and the four diphthongs, (
)
.
 
The four semi-vowels y, v,
W ^3 ) called antasthavarna, the 
twenty-five 
class-consonants 
or 
mutes called sparsa, and the four 
usman letters s, §, s and h (
are the same in all the PratiSa- 
lchya and grammar works although 
in the Pratisakhya works the semi­
vowels are mentioned after the class 
consonants. 
The 
difference 
in 
numbers, as noticed, for example 
in the maximum number which 
reaches 65 in the Vajasaneyl-Pra- 
tisakhya, is due to the separate 
mention of the long and protract­
ed vowels as also to the inclusion

6
of the Ayogavaha letters, and their 
. number. 
The 
Ayogavaha letters 
are anusvara, Visarjanlya, jihvamu- 
liya, upadhmanlya, nasikya, four 
yamas and, svarabhakti 
The Rk 
Pratisakhya does not mention I (e£), 
but adding long a ( a ? r ) £ ( f ) u ( 3’ ) 
and r ( 55) to the short vowels, 
mentions 12 vowels, and mention­
ing 3 Ayogavahas 
and a f) 
lays down 48 letters. 
The 
Rk 
Tantra Pratisakhya adds the vowel 
I ( 55) ( short as also long ) and 
mentions 14 vowels, 4 semi-vowels, 
25 mutes, 4 sibilants, and by add­
ing 10 ayogavahas viz. 4 yamas, 
nasikya, visarjanlya jihvamimya, 
upadhmanlya and two kinds of 
anusvara, and thus brings the total 
number to 57. 
The R.k Tantra 
makes a separate enumeration'by 
putting 
diphthongs 
first, 
long 
vowels afterwards and short vowels 
still afterwards, and puts semi­
vowels first before mutes, for pur­
poses of framing brief terms or 
pratyaharas. 
This enumeration is 
called varnopadesa in contrast with 
the other one which is called varn- 
oddesa. The Taittiriya Pratisakhya 
adds protracted vowels and lays 
down 60 letters; 
The 
Siksa of 
Panini lays down 63 or 64 letters, 
while the Vajasaneyi-Pratisakhya 
gives 65 letters, cf. V. Pr. VIII.
1-25. 
The alphabet of the modem 
Indian Languages is bassed on the 
Varnasamamnaya 
given 
in 
the 
Vajasaneyi-Pratisakhya. The Pra- 
tisakhyas call this enumeration by 
the name Varna-samamnaya. 
The 
Rk. tantra uses the terms Aksarasa- 
mamnaya and Brahmarasi which 
are picked up later on by Patanjali.

separation as in

force such as setting aside even

( 1 )  not nitya or 
obligatory; 
optional; ( said of a rule or pari- 
bhasa whose application is volun­
tary ). Regarding the case and con- 
jugational affixes it can be said 
that those affixes can, in a way, 
be looked upon as nitya or obliga­
tory, as they have to be affixed to 
a crude nominal base or a root, 
there being a dictum that no crude 
base vvithout an affix can be used, 
as also, no affix alone without a 
base can be used. 
On the other 
hand, the taddhita and krt affixes 
as also compounds are voluntary 
as, instead of them an independent 
word or a phrase can be used to 
convey the sense. 
For a list of 
sjich nitya affixes see M. Bh. on V.

used in the sense of not-nitya, the 
word

This udatta was given to only one

a highly 
technical 
term 
in 
Panini’s 
grammar 
applied 
in a 
variety of ways to rules 
which 
thereby 
can 
supersede 
other 
rules. 
The 
term 
is 
not 
used 
by 
Panini 
himself. 
The Varti- 
kakara has used the term 
thrice 
( See 
I. 4.2 Vart. 
8, VI. 1. 106 
Vart. 10 and VIII. 2.6 
Vart. 1) 
evidently in the sense of * imme­
diate 
' urgent % of earlier occur­
rence’ or the like. 
The word is 
usually explained as a Bahuvrlhi 
compound meaning ‘ srct: srfrffj fql?r- 
tufir 
’ (a rule or operation which 
has got the causes of its application 
within those of another rule or 
operation which 
consequently is 
termed 
). 
ajrckff, in short, is a 
rule, whose causes 
of 
operation 
occur earlier in the wording of the 
form, or in the process of formation. 
As an 
rule occurs to the mind 
earlier, as seen above, it is looked 
upon as stronger than any other 
rule, barring of course amgr? rules 
or exceptions, if the other rule pre­
sents 
itself simultaneously. 
The 
Vartikakara, hence, in giving pre­
ference to 
rules, uses generally 
the wording 
which is
paraphrased by arercf ffeirK  
which is looked upon as a paribhasa. 
Grammarians, succeeding the Varti­
kakara, not-only looked upon the 
operation as weaker than ar?cr- 
*ff, but they looked upon it as 
invalid or invisible before the 
operation had taken place. 
They 
laid down the Paribhasa 3if§s 3%^- 
which has been thoroughly 
discussed by Nagesa in his Pari- 
bhasendusekhara. 
The 3RRfcf is 
taken in a variety of ways by Gram­
marians: 
( 1 )  having causes 
of 
application within or before those 
of another e.g. 
from the root 
(1e +  3 +  q ) where the qqi- sub­
stitute for ? is sjixRsf being caused 
by 3 as compared to guna for 3 
which is caused by q, (2 ) having 
causes of application occurring be­
fore those of another in the word­
ing of the form, (3 ) having a 
smaller number of causes, ( 4) oc­
curring earlier in the order of several 
operations which take place 
in 
arriving at the complete form of a 
word, ( 5) not having 
( tech-

29
nical term ) as a cause of its appli­
cation, (6) not depending upon 
two words or padas, ( 7 ) depending 
upon -a cause or causes of a general 
nature (
as opposed to one 
which depends on causes of 
a 
specific nature {
)
.
the phrase is used gene­
rally for the iftmm ‘ srfe® sjfefffFcTCf ’ 
described above. 
See 
the word 
3FS*3f. 
The 
has got a very
wide field of application and is used 
several times in setting aside diffi­
culties which present themselves 
in the formation of a word. 
Like 
many other paribhasas this pari­
bhasa. is not a paribhasa of universal 
application.
the strength which an 
afitaranga rule or operation possesses 
by virtue of which it supersejdes all 
other rules or operations, excepting 
an apavada rule, when or if they 
occur simultaneously in the forma­
tion of a word.
characterized by the nature 
of an antaranga operation which 
gives that rule a special strength to 
set aside other rules occurring to­
gether with it.

being characterized ( 1 )

There is no difference pf opinion 
regarding the. fact that, out of the 
four standard kinds of words jot, 
sutler, 3qgn andf?mcr, the'first two 
kinds htt[ and sfreqRT do possess an 
independent sense of their own. 
Regarding possession of sense and 
the manner in which the sense is 
conveyed, by the other two viz. the 
Upasargas 
(prepositions) 
and 
Nipatas ( particles) there is a strik­
ing difference of opinion among 
scholars 
of grammar. 
Although 
Panini has given the actual designa­
tion q^ to words ending with either 
the case or the conjugational affixes, 
he has looked upon the different 
units or elements of a Pada such as 
the base, the affix, the augment 
and the like as possessed of in­
dividually separate senses. 
There 
is practically nothing in Panini’s 
sutras to prove that Nipatas and 
Upasargas do not possess an in­
dependent sense. Re: Nipatas, the 
iule 
which means that ^
and other indeclinables are called 
Nipatas when they do not mean 
gvf, presents a riddle as to the 
meaning which =3 and the like 
should convey if they do not mean 
or 
i.e. a substance. 
The 
Nipatas cannot mean 
or verbal 
activity and if they do not mean 
or ^sq, too, they will have to be call­
ed 
( absolutely meaningless) 
and in that case they would not be

41
termed Pratipadika, and no case- 
affix would be applied to them. 
To avoid this difficulty, the Varti- 
kakara had to make an effort and 
he wrote a Vartika 
srrfcrqfefER l p. I. 2,45 Var. 12. As 
a matter of fact the Nipatas 
m 
and others do possess a sense as 
shown by their presence and ab­
sence ( sja^i and 
). The sense, 
however, is conveyed rather in a 
different manner as the word gjjf, 
or ggrra, which is the meaning 
conveyed by ^ in *re: 
cannot
be substituted for =3 as its synonym 
in the sentence 
Looking
to the different ways 
in 
which 
their sense is conveyed by nouns 
and verbs on the one hand, and 
by affixes, prepositions and inde- 
clinables on the other'hand, Bhar» 
trhari, possibly 
following 
Yaska 
and 
Vyadi, 
has developed 
the 
theory of stores as contrasted with 
and laid down the dictum 
that 
indeclinables, 
affixes 
and 
prepositions (3q?rfs ) do not directly 
convey any specific sense as their 
own, 
but they are 
mere 
signs 
to show some specific property or 
excellence of the sense conveyed 
by the word to which they are 
attached; cf. also the 
statement

The Grammarians, just 
like the rhetoricians' have stated 
that the connection between words ! 
and their senses is a permanent 
one (ft®), the only difference in 
their views being that the rhetori­
cians state that words are related, 
no doubt permanently, 
to their 
sense by means of 
or conven­
tion which solely depends on the 
will of God, while the Grammarians 
say that the expression of sense 
is only a natural function of words;

.
deduced from the phrase a*%<?i]forra; 
frequently used by the Varttikakara. 
The Paribhasa 
lays 
down 
that 
‘when a combination 
of 
letters 
employed in Grammar, is possessed 
of a sense, it has to be taken as

42
possessed of sense and not such a 
one as is devoid of sense. ’
conveyance or 
expression 
of sense, cf. sfsrfftraifr 53:
P. I. 2.64 Vart. 33. It is only a 
nature of words that they convey 
their sense. 
This statement of the 
Vartikakara is taken as a standard 
dictum which is fully 
consistent 
with the doctrine of
a factor which determines 
the 
intended -sense out of 
the 
various senses 
that arise in the 
mind. Such factors are syntactical 
connection in a sentence

In writing, 
there is observed the practice of ;

The 
Atharva-Prati-
sakhya defines 
as the ’ separa­
tion of two padas joined in Samhita. 
( A .P r .I I . 3.25, II. 4.5). 
In the 
recital of the pada-patha, when the 
word-elements are uttered separate­
ly, there is a momentary pause 
measuring one matra or the time 
required for the utterance of a short 
vowel. (See for details Vaj. Prat.

Sutrapatha of Panini consisting of 
eight books ( adhyavas) containing 
in all 3981 Sutras, as found in the 
traditional recital, current at the 
time of the authors of the Kasika. 
Out of these 3981 Sutras, seven are 
found given as Vartikas in the \ 
Mahabhasya and two are found in i 
Ganapatha. 
The 
author 
of the I 
Mahabhasya has commented upon j 
only 1228 of these 3981 Sutras. 1 
Originally there were a very few 
differences of 
readings 
also, as 
observed by Patanjali ( see Mbh on
I. 4.1); but the text was fixed by 
Patanjali which, with a few addi­
tions made by the authors of the 
Kasika, as 
observed above, has 
traditionally come down to the t 
present day. The Astadhyayi is ! 
believed to be one of the six Ved- : 
anga works which are committed to 1 
memorygby the reciters of Rgveda. 
The text of the Astadhyayi is recited 
without accents. The word 3?gl«u#

STRW invalid; of suspended validity 
for the time being; not functioning 
for the time being. The term is 
frequently used in Panini’s system 
of 
grammar in 
connection with 
rules or operations which are preve­
nted, or held in suspense, in conn­
ection with their application in the
process of the formation of a word. 
The. term ( strIs ) is also used in 
connection with rules that have 
applied or operations that have 
taken place, which are, in certain 
cases, made invalid or invisible as 
far as their effect is concerned and 
other rules are applied or other 
operations are allowed to take place, 
which ordinarily have-been preven­
ted by those rules which are made 
invalid had they not been inva­
lidated. 
Panini ; has 
laid 
down 
this invalidity on three different 
occasions ( 1 )  invalidity by the 
rule 
VIII.2.1. 
which
makes a rule or;; operation in the 
second, third and fourth quarters 
of 
the 
eighth 
chapter 
of 
the 
Astadhyayi invalid when any pre­
ceding rule is to be applied, (2 ) 
invalidity by the rule
which enjoins 
mutual 
invalidity 
in the case of operations prescribed 
in the Abhlya 
section beginning 
with the rule 
( VI. 4.22).
and going on upto the end of the 
Pada ( VI 4.175), ( 3) invalidity of 
the single substitute for two letters, 
that has already taken place, when 
^is to be substitued for g., or the 
letter a. is to be prefixed, cf.
Rfe (V I. 1.86). 
Although- Panini 
laid down the general rule that a 
subsequent rule or operation, in 
case of 
conflict, 
supersedes the 
preceding rule, in many cases it 
became necessary for him to set 
that rule aside, which he did by 
means of the stratagem of invalidity 
given above. 
Subsequent gram­
marians found out a number of 
additional cases where it became 
necessary to supersede the 
sub­
sequent rule which they did by 
laying down a dictum of invalidity 
similar to that of Panini. 
The 
author of the Varttikas, hence, laid 
down the doctrine that rules which 
are nitya or antaranga or apavada, 
’ 
are stronger than, and hence super­
sede, the ariitya, bahiranga 
and 
utsarga rules 
respectively. Later 
grammarians have laid down 
in 
general, 
the 
invalidity 
of 
the 
bahiranga rule when the antaranga 
rule occurs along with it or sub­
sequent to it. 
For details see 
Vol. 7 of Vyakarana Mahabhasya 
( D. E. Society’s edition) pages 217- 
220.

- lines 
5^ ,. a^Ffqra ^
^it -B *rig: R. Pr. X II. 5 where 
f aipjqta ’ and ‘ *ng ’ are used as 
synonyms. As the root form such 
as 'fi, g etc. as distinct from the 
verbal form, is never found in
■
 
actual use, it is immaterial whether 
the word means root or verb. In 
the passages quoted above from the 
Nirukta and the Mahabhasya refer­
ring to the four kinds of words, the 
word akhyata could be taken to 
mean root ( *tt§ ) or verb ( ftiqi^ ). 
The - akhyata or verb is chiefly 
concerned with the process of being

55
srtw
and becoming while nouns ( aTOft) 
have sa'ttva or essence, or static 
element as their meaning. Verbs 
and nouns are concerned not merely 
with the activities and things in 
this world but with every process 
and entity ; cf.
=g£ Nir. I . ; 
BtlT I
TOT: 
I Laghumanjusa. When
a krt. affix is added to a root, the 
static element predominates and 
hence a word ending with a krt. 
affix in the sense of bhava or verbal 
activity is treated as a noun and; 
regularly declined ; cf.
3<R}cf^ vrqfa M. Bh. on II. 2. 19 and 
III. 1.67, where the words w ,  ^2JT, 
TO and others are given as instances. 
Regarding indeclinable words end­
ing with krt. affixes such as 
f ^ ,  
and others, the modern grammari­
ans hold that in their case 
the 
verbal activity is not shadowed by 
the static element and hence they 
can be, in a way, looked upon as 
akhyatas ; cf. aisqqfa)

cf. 
JftnfefiR:, 
P.
III. 3.108 Vart. 2.3. 4. where such 
appendages to be added to the roots 
or letters are given. The word snjpg 
is an old word used in the Nirukta, 
but the term 3rt»F$p appears to be 
used for the first time for such 
forms by Haradatta; cf. 
i
TfR^r: Padam- 
afijail on VII. 2. 31. In the traditi­
onal oral explanations the second 
part of a reduplicated word is term­
ed aiFl'ip which is placed second
i.e. after the original by virtue of 
the convention 
al­
though, in fact, it is said to possess 
the sense of the root in contrast 
with the first - which 
is 
called 
abhyasa. 
A nice distinction can, 
however, be drawn between the four 
kinds of 
adventitious 
wordings 
found in grammar viz. 
aiwne and 3)iqq which can be briefly 
stated as follows: The former two 
do not form a regular part of the 
word and are not found in the 
actual use of the word; besides, they 
do not possess any sense, while the 
latter two are found in actual use 
and they are possessed of sense. 
Again the agantu word is simply 
used for facility of understanding 
exactly and correctly the previous 
word which is really wanted; the 
wording, besides serving this pur­
pose, is of use in causing some 
grammatical operations, sjvqre is 
the first part of the wording which 
is wholly repeated and it possesses 
no sense by itself, while, agama 
which is added to the word either 
at the beginning or at the end or 
inserted in the middle, forms a 
part of the word and possesses the 
sense of the word.
3TFTTT augment, 
accrement, a word 
element which is added to the primi­
tive or basic word during the process

56
of the formation of a complete 
word or pada.' The agama is an 
adventitious word 
element 
and 
hence differs from adesa, the substi­
tute which wholly takes the place 
of the original ( or 
' Out of
the several agamas mentioned by 
Paiiini, those that are marked with 
mute 5 are prefixed, those, marked 
with fj j are affixed, while those, 
marked with 
are placed imme­
diately after the last vowel of the 
word. The augments become a part 
and parcel of the word to which 
they are added, and the character­
istics of which they possess; cf.

STTWWTspJ a term 
used in 
contrast 
to the term 
for such verbal
and 
krt 
affixes, 
as 
are 
not 
personal endings of 
verbs 
nor 
marked with the mute 
letter 51, 
cf. 
1 srm rpi 
r
P. III. 4. 113 and 114. The personal 
endings of verbs in the perfect 
tense and the benedictive 
mood 
are termed ardhadhatuka, cf. P.III.
4. 115, 116; while both the terms 
are promiscuously found utilised in 
the Vedic Literature; cf. P. III.
9
4.117. 
The main utility of the 
ardhadhatuka term is the augment 
f  ( ?^ ) to be prefixed to the ardha­
dhatuka affixes. The term 
was in use in works of the old 
Vaiyakaranas; cf. am i STI'fcrRHig

It cannot be said how 
the term ardhadhatuka originated. 
Probably such affixes or pratyayas, 
like the krt affixes generally 
as 
could be placed after certain roots 
only were called ardhadhatuka, as 
contrasted with the verbal and the 
present 
participle 
affixes which 
were 
termed 
sarvadhatuka 
on 
account of their being found in use 
after every root.

( 1 )  a letter or a group of letters 
attached to a word which is not 
seen in actual use in the spoken 
language; cf. 
?a.> Sak. I. 1.5,
Hem. 1. x.37. The fg. letters are 
app'ied to a word before it, or after 
it, and they have got each of them 
a purpose in grammar viz. causing 
or preventing certain grammatical 
operations in the formation of the 
complete word. Panini has not given 
any definition of the word 
, but 
he has mentioned when and where 
the vowels and consonants attached 
to words are to be understood as 
53.; ( cf. 
t etc.
P. I. 3.2 to 8 ) and stated that these 
letters are to be dropped in actual 
use; cf. P. 1. 3.9. It appears that 
grammarians before Panini had also 
employed such s3. letters, as is clear 
from some passages in the Maha­
bhasya as also from their use in 
other systems of grammar as also 
in the Unadi list of affixes, for pur­
poses similar to those found served 
in Panini’s grammar. Almost all 
vowels and consonants are used as
15. for different purposes and the 5^ 
letters are applied to roots in the 
Dhatupatha, nouns in the Gana- 
patha, as also to affixes, augments 
and substitutes prescribed in gram­
mar. Only at a few places they are 
attached to give facility of pronun­
ciation. Sometimes .the 
lettersi 
especially vowels, which are said 
to be 1^, when uttered as nasalized 
by Panini, are recognised only by 
convention; cf. 
qifa-
# n : ( S. K . on P. I. 3.2). The word- 
Icfj which literally means going away 
or disappearing, can be explained 
as a mute indicatory letter, smsr-
mi spsir h 
1
In Panini’s ' grammar, the mute 
vowel sr applied to roots indicatesthe 
placing of the Atmanepada affixes 
after them, if it be uttered as anu­
datta and of affixes of both the 
padas if uttered svarita ; cf. P. I. 3.
12, 72. The mute vowel sn signifies 
the prevention of

He is nowhere 
quoted by Panini. Many quotations 
believed to have been taken fromfi 
his work are found scattered in 
grammar works, from which it ap­
pears that there was an ancient 
system prevalent in the eastern 
part of India at the time of Fanini 
which could be named 
to which Panini possibly refers by 
the word srrera. From references, it 
appears that the grammar was of 
the type of Jrfw, discussing various. 
topics of grammar such as alphabet, 
coalescence, 
declension, 
context,
8 compounds, derivatives from nouns 
and roots, conjugation, and changes
in the base. 
The treatment was 
later on followed by Sakatayana 
and writers of the Katantra school.

yu|ji4 affixes headed by the affix 301., 
which are similar to krt affixes of 
Panini, giving derivation mostly-of 
such words as are not derived by 
rules of Panini. No particular sense 
such as agent, object etc. is menti­
oned in connection with these affixes 
but, as Panini has stated in “
” P- Ill- 4.75. the various 
Unadi- affixes are applied to the 
various roots as prescribed in any 
Karaka sense, except the 
and 
the aWKR; in other words, any one 
of the senses, agent, object, instru­
ment and abode, is assigned to the 
Unadi affix as suits the meaning of 
the word. Although some scholars 
believe that the Unadi affixes are 
given by a grammarian later than 
Panini as there are words like cfpsjjs, 
^5K and others included in the list 
of Unadi words and that there are 
. 
many interpolated Sutras, still the 
Unadi 
collection must be looked 
upon as an old one which is defini­
tely mentioned by Pacini in two
different rules; 
cf. Panini 3^k41 
3p m  P. III. 3.x and cn*W ii% n^:
III. .4. 75. Patanjali- apparently 
ascribing the collection to Sakata­
yana, as seen from an interesting 
passage of M.Bha. on 30115% fpsqj 
has given a very interesting discus­
sion about these Unadi affixes and 
stated on the strength of the Vartt- 
ika, fralciils[5rra^r:, that these affixes 
and the words given in the Unadi 
collection should not be considered 
as genuinely derived. 
The deriva­
tion is not a very systematic and 
logically correct one and therefore 
for practical purposes, the words 
derived by the application of the 
affixes 3^ and others 
should be 
looked upon as underived; cf. 3<nR- 
M. Bh. on. P.
I. 1.16, III. 4. 77, IV. I. 1, VI. 1.
62, 
VII. 1. 2, VII. 2. 8 etc. There 
is a counterstatement also seen in 
. the Mahabhasya 3qR3t sgcTSllPf, re­
presenting the other view prevailing 
at the time ; cf. M. Bh. on III. 1. 
133; but not much, importance 
seems to be attached to it. The 
different systems of grammar have 
different collections of such words 
which are also known by the term 
. Unadi. Out of the collections belon- - 
ging to Panini’s system, three colle­
ctions are available at present, the 
collection into five padas given in 
the printed edition of the Siddhanta 
Kaumjidi, the collection into ten 
Padas given in the printed edition 
of the Prakriya-KaumudI and the 
collection in the Sarasvatikaijtha- 
bharaiia of Bhoja forming Padas x,
2 and 3 of the second Adhyaya of

(Unadi khanda in Prakriyasarva-

characteristics of the acute accent. 
The acute is the prominent accent 
in a word— a simple, word as also a 
compound word-and when a vowel 
in a word is possessed of the acute 
accent, the remaining vowels have 
the STjf^ra or the grave 
accent. 
Accent is a property of vowels and 
consonants 
do not 
possess any 
independent accent. They possess 
the accent of the adjoining vowel 
connected with it. The acute accent 
corresponds to 
what is termed 
‘ accent’

English

other 
languages.

This remark shows that in ancient

This sense 
gave rise to, or was based upon, an 
allied sense, viz ihe meaning of 
‘ ^  ’ i.e. possession. 
Possibly the 
sense ‘ possession ’ further develop­

of the fruit or result for self or

Some scholars
like Sakatayana hold the view that 
separated from the roots, prefixes 
do not express any specific sense as 
ordinary 
words 
express, ' while 
scholars like Gargya hold the view 
that prefixes do express a sense e,g.
si means beginning or nvw;

It is' doubtful, however, 
which view Panini himself held. 
In his Atmanepada topic, he has 
mentioned 
some 
specific 
roots 
as possessing some specific senses 
when preceded by some specific 
prefixes, (see P. I. 3.20, 24, 2540, 
41, 46, 52, 56, etc.), which implies 
possibly 
that 
roots 
themselves 
possess various senses, while pre­
fixes are simply instrumental in 
indicating or showing them. On the 
other hand, in the topic of the 
Karmapravacaolyas, 
the 
same 
words sr, TO etc. which, however, are 
not termed Upasargas for the time 
being, although they are called 
Nipatas, are actually assigned some 
specific senses by 
Panini. 
The 
Varttikakara has defined 
as 
STOn: P. I, 3.Z. Vart. 7, 
leaving it doubtful whether the sq- 
W or prefix possesses an independ­
ent sense which modifies the sense 
of the root, or without possessing 
any independent sense, it shows 
only the modified sense of the root 
which also is possessed by the root. 
Bhartrhari, 
Kaiyata 
and 
their 
followers including Nagesa have 
emphatically given the view that 
not only prefixes 
but 
Nipatas, 
which include sr, TO and others as 
Upasargas as well as Karmapra- 
vacaniyas, do not denote any sense, 
but they indicate it; they are in fact 
and not

question in X II. 6-9 where, as ex­
plained by the commentator, it is

89
stated that prefixes express a sense 
along with roots or nouns to which 
they are attached. 
It is not clear 
whether they convey the sense by 
denotation or indication, the words 
tjRg; in stanza 6 and 
in
stanza 8 being in favour of the 
former and the latter views respec­
tively; cf.

themselves, do not 
possess any sense, but they indicate 
" the sense of the verb or noun with 
which they are connected.

attributed to Sakatayana according 
to Nagesa, while 3?ff?3R is held as

by
others. It bears a remarkable simil­

and changes of g, and q^to ^ and m. 
respectively. It cannot be definitely

works belonging to the Asvalayana 
Sakha of the Rg Veda. The work

a century or so after Panini’s time. 
It is possible that the work, which 
is available, is based upon a few 
ancient Pratisakhya works which 
are lost. Its authorship is attributed 
to Saunaka. The work is a metrical 
one and consists of three books or 
Adhy3yas, 
each Adhyaya 
being 
made up of six Patalas or chapters. 
It is written, just as the other 
Piatisakhya works, with a view to 
give directions for the proper recita­
tion of the Veda. It has got a

gj i Bhasavrtti on p. I. 2.64. There 
is a dictum of grammarians that 
every individual object requires a 
separate expression to convey its 
presence. 
Hence, when there is a 
dual sense, the woid has to be re­
peated, as also the word has to be 
multiplied when there is a plural 
sense. In current spoken language, 
however, in such cases the word is 
used only once. 
To justify this 
single utterance for conveying the 
sense of plurality, Panini has laid 
down a general rule 
*PFr
and many other similar rules 
to cover cases of plurality not of 
cue and the same object, but plural­
ity caused by many objects, such 
as plurality caused by ideas going 
in pairs or relations such as parents, 
brothers and sisters, grand-father 
a ud grand-scn, male and female.

15gr; similarly ?^r: for many trees,

irrespective of the individuals being 
some males and 
some females. 
Panini has devoted 10 Sutras to 
this topic of Ekaiesa. 
The Daiva 
grammar has completely 
ignored 
this topic. Patanjali has very criti­
cally and exhaustively 
discussed 
this topic. 
Some critics hold that 
the topic of 
did not exist in
the original Astadhyayi of Panin! 
but it was interpolated later on, 
and adduce the long discussion in 
the Mahabhasya 
especially 
the 
Purvapaksa therein, in support of 
their argument. Whatever the case 
be, the Varttikakara has comment­
ed upon it at length; hence, the 
addition must have been made im­
mediately after Panini, if at all 
there was 
any.

( feat) 
as 
sampradana, 
apadana or adhikarana is also treat­
ed as karma, if it is not meant or 
desired as apadana, sampradana etc. 
It is termed 
in such cases ;
cf.
KaS. on I. 4.51. See the word spfifiRT 
above. Karman or object is to be 
achieved by an activity or f%qt; it 
is always syntactically connected 
with a verb or a verbal derivative. 
When connected with verbs 
or 
verbal derivatives, indeciinables or 
words ending with the affixes 33;, %  
'37^, etc-> it is put in the 
accusative case. 
It is put in the 
genitive case when it is connected 
with affixes other than those men­
tioned above ; cf. P. II. 3,65, 69. 
When, however, the karman is ex­
pressed (3?faft?r) by a verbal termi­
nation (ffl^), or a verbal noun 
termination (fa;), or a noun-affix
- (crfeft), or a compound, it is put

I l l
in the nominative case. 
e.g. 
fifa%, srk Iff:, fa :, s n fe : SW etc. 
It is called srfaffa in such cases; 
cf. P. II. 2.1. 
See the word arafflfts 
above. 
The object 
or 
Karman 
which is ffEeMU is described to be 
of three kinds with reference to 
the way in which it is obtained 
-from the activity. It is called 
when a transformation or a change 
is noticed in the object as a result 
of the verbal activity, e.g. SitSTpT 
sr 
etc. 
It is called 
STM when no change is seen to 
result from the action, the object 
only coming into contact with the 
subject, e.g. grt 
srtf^i tR*lf?r
etc. It is called 
when the object 
is brought into being 
under 
a 
specific name; e.g.

the activity of the agent or

To show facility
of a verbal activity on the object, 
when the agent or karta is dispens­
ed with, and the object is looked 
upon as the agent, and used also 
as an agent, the verbal terminations 
fit, w: etc. are not applied in the 
sense of an agent, but they are 
applied in the sense of an object; 
consequently the sign of .the voice 
is not 3T (^ra.), but q 
and the 
verbal terminations are cf, 
etc. 
(3^) instead of 
%, 
to etc. 
In 
popular language the use of an 
expression of this type is called 
Karmakartari-Prayoga. For details

name of an important small 
treatise on grammar which appears 
like a systematic abridgment of the 
Astadhyayi of Panini. 
It ignores 
many unimportant rules of Panini, 
adjus*s many, and altogether omits 
the Vedic portion and the accent 
chapter of Panini. 
It probably be­
longed to Aindra system as opposed 
to Mahes vara system. 
It is also 
explained as Kasakrtsnatantra. 
It 
la\s down the Sutras in an order 
different from that of Panini divid­
ing the work into four adhyayas 
dealing with technical terms, samdhi 
rules, declension, 
syntax, 
com­
pounds 
noun-affixes 
( taddhita 
affixes) conjugation, voice, and ver­
bal derivatives in an order, 
ihe 
total number of rules is 1412 sup- ' 
plemented by many subordinate 
rules or Varttikas. 
The treatise is 
be'ieved to have been written by 
, Sarvavarman, called Sarvavarman 
or Sarva or Sarva, who is said to 
have lived in the reign of the Sata- 
vah-uia kings. The belief that Panini 
refers to a work of Kalapin in his 
rules IV. 3.108 and IV. 3.48 and 
that Patafijali’s words 
and
Support.it, has notmuch 
strength. 
The 
work 
was very 
popular especially among those who 
wanted to study spoken Sanskrit 
with ease and attained for several 
years a very prominent place among 
text-books on grammar especially 
in Behar, Bengal and Gujarat. 
It 
has got. a large number of glosses 
and commentary works, many of 
which are in a manuscript form at

115
<\ _ 
fr- _
present. Its last chapter ( Caturtha- I 
Adhyaya) is ascribed to Varanici. ! 
As the arrangement of topics is 
entirely different 
from 
Panini’s 
order, inspite of considerable resem­
blance of Surras and their wording, 
it is probable that the work was 
based on Papini but composed on 
the models of ancient grammarians 
viz. Indra, Sakatayana ar.d others 
whose works, although not available 
now, were available to the author. 
The 
grammar 
Katantra is also 
called Kalapa. A comparison of the 
Katantra Sutras and the Kalapa 
Sutras shows that the ore is a 
different version of the other. The 
Katantra Grammar is also called 
Kaumara as it is said that the 
original 
instructions 
for 
the 
grammar 
were 
received by the 
author from Kumara or Karttikeya.

mentary on Katantrastitras. 
The 
commentary 
ascribed 
to Durga­
simha was popular as proved by a 
number of commentaries upon it, 
- 
one of which is written by Durga­
simha 
himself. 
Some 
of 
these 
commentaries are Sisyahifa or Nyasa 
by Ugrabhuti, Katantrapanjika by 
Trilocanadasa, Katantravistara by 
Vardhamana, Katantrap3risi§tatika 
of Pundarlkaksa and a gloss by 
another Durgasimha.

the well-known author of The 
Varttikas on the sutras of Panini. 
He is also believed 
to be the 
author of the Vajasaneyi Prati­
sakhya 
and many 
sutra works 
named after him. 
He is believecl
to be a resident of South India on 
the strength of the remark fsfacrfen 
51%nT?iK made 
by Patanjali 
in 
connection with the statement ‘ iwr 
which is looked upoh.as 
Katyayana’s Varttika. Katya refers 
to Sakatayana and Sakalya (see Vaj. 
Pra. III. 9 ) and mentions Vajapya- 
yana ( I. 2.64. Va. 35 ). Vya4i ( on 
P. 1.2.64 Va. 45) and Pauskarasadi 
( 011 P. 8.4.48 ). 
The authorship 
of Pratljnasutra and Bhasikasutra 
is attributed to him. 
He is called 
Vakyakara 
and 
Madhyamamuni. 
Some scholars say that ■
 Vararuci 
was also another name given to him, 
in which case the 
Varttikakara 
Vararuci 
Katyayana 
has to be 
looked upon as different from the 
subsequent writer named Vararuci 
to whom some works on Prakrit and 
Katantra grammar are 
ascribed.

- 
means ' the capacity in which a 
thing becomes instrumental in brin­
ging aboufan action’. This capacity 
is looked upon as the sense of the 
case-affixes which express 
it. M.

respectively used which, hence, are 
called Karakavibhaktis, as contras­
ted with Upapadavibhaktis, which 
show a relation between two sub­
stantives and.hence arel'ooked upon 
as weaker than the Karakavibhaktis; 
cf. gqqs^ffi: 3^ 3if3^ fet$2i{ft Pari. 
Sek. Pari. 94. The topic explaining 
Karakavibhaktis is looked upon as 
a very important

chapter in 
treatises of grammar 
and there are. several small com-

ing with karakas only.

( 1 )  name given to the reputed 
gloss ( ff% ) on the Sutras t>f Panini 
written by the joint authors Jaya-

122
ditya and Vamana in the 
7th 
century A.D. Nothing definitely can 
be said., as to which. portion was 
. written by jayaditya arid which by 
Vamana, or the whole work was 
jointly 
written. 
Some scholars 
believe that the work was called 
. Kasika as it was written in the 
city of Ka£i and that the gloss 
on the first five Adhyayas was 
written by: Jayaditya and that on 
the last three by.Vamana. Although 
it is written in a scholarly way, 
the work forms an excellent help 
to 
beginners to understand 
the 
sense of the pithy Sutras of Panini. 
The work has not only deserved 
but obtained 
and. maintained a 
very prominent position among stu­
dents and scholars of .Panini’s gram­
mar in spite of other works.like the 
Bhasavjtti, the Prakriya Kaumudi, 
the. Siddhanta Kaumudi and others 
written by equally learned scholars. 
Its wording is based almost on the- 
Mahabhasya, which it has followed, 
avoiding, of course, the scholarly 
disquisitions 
occurring here and 
. there in the Mahabhasya. 
Traditi­
onally it is called R3ilf% because it 
is a common treatise on Vedic and 
classical grammar. 
It has derived 
great help from 
Candravftti. 
It 
appears that 
manj' commentary 
works were written on it, the well- 
known among them being the Kasi- 
kavivaranapafijika or Nyasa written 
by Jinendrabuddhi and the Pada- 
manjaii by Haradatta. For details

When a 
person sinks in a well, he is soiled 
with dust and dirty water. 
But 
when at the proper depth he gets 
clean water, he becomes cleaner with 
the help of that water. 
Similarly 
when a person learns corrupt words 
he accrues great demerit. However, 
with the knowledge of correct words, 
he is not only free from the earlier 
demerit but also adds to the stock 
of his merits, cp. M. Bh. Paspasa-

The biggest or 
widest notion of the universal or

though on many an Occasion vyakti

If it is claimed that a particular 
word is without any purpose, the 
object of it being achieved in some 
other 
way, 
the 
commentators 
always try to assign some purpose
or the other for the use of the word 
in the Sutra. Such a word or words 
or sometimes even the whole Sutra 
is called 
or indicator of a
particular thing. 
The Paribhasas 
or rules of interpretation are mostly 
derived by indication 
(^TTOif&s) 
from a word or words in a Sutra 
which apparently appear to be 
or without purpose, and which are 
shown as $1% after the particu'ar 
indication (
)
 is drawn from 
them. The frTOS is shown to be con­
stituted of four parts, 
STTW, 
and actress. 
For the 
instances of Jfiapakas, see Paribha 
§endusekhara. Purusottamadeva in 
his Jnapakasamuccaya has drawn 
numerous conclusions of the type 
of fTq;i from the wording of Panini 
'Sutras. The word pqjfi and 
are 
used many times as synonyms al­
though fTO sometimes refers to the 
conclusions drawn from a wording 
which is frm  or indicator. For in­
stances of fTTO, cf. M. Bh. on Mahe- 
ivara Sutras 1,3, 5, P. 1. 1.3, 11, 18, 
23, 51 etc. The word

The. earliest use of the 
word 
in the sense given above, 
is found in the Paribhasasflcana of 
Vyadi. 
The Paribhasa works on 
other systems of grammar such as 
the Katantra, the Jainendra and 
others have drawn similar Jfiapakas 
from the wording of the Sutras in 
their systems. Sometimes a Jnapaka 
is not regularly constituted of the 
four parts given above; it is a mere 
indicator and is called 
instead 
of Sim.

a conclusion or inference, drawn

with a view to assigning a purpose to

II. 1.6, II. 1.20, II. 1.49, etc., and

Sometimes, the compound gets a

tatpurusa compound is optional as 
generally

are,

desire of the speaker. Some tat-

?«pcrfqfi( a peculiar feature 
in 
the 
interpretation of the rules of Panini, 
laid down by the author of the 
Sutras himself by virtue of which 
an adjectival word, qualifying its 
principal word, does not 
denote 
itself, but something ending with 
it also ; cf. 
P. I. 1.72.
This feature is principally noticed 
in the case of general words or 
adhikaras which are put in a parti­
cular rule, but which occur in a 
large number of subsequent rules ; 
for instance, the word 3lRmFvh(d, 
put in P. IV. 1.1, is valid in every 
rule upto the end of chapter V and 
the words Brer:, 
qsn etc. mean 
srWICi 
«i5T^lci;etc. Similarly
the words W t: (P . III. 1.91) and 
(P. VI. 4.1) occurring in a 
number of subsequent rules have 
the adjectival words to them,, which 
are mentioned in subsequent rules, 
denoting not only those words, but 
words ending with 
them. In a 
large number of cases this feature

181
of eRsriwr is not desirable, as it 
goes against arriving at the desired 
forms, and exceptions deduced from 
Panini’s rules are laid down by the 
Varttikakara and later grammarians; 
cf. Par. Sek. Pari. 16, 23, 31; also 
Mahabhasya on P. I. 1.72.
a convention similar to the 
of Partini, laid down by the 
. Varttikakara laying down that in 
case an operation is prescribed for 
something 
followed 
by a single 
letter, that single letter should be 
taken to mean a word beginning 
with that single letter ; cf.

word cdis used by Yaska in II, 5. 
Panini has used the word crf&a not 
for words, but for the suffixes which 
are added to form such words at all 
places { e. g. in I. 1.38, IV. 1.17, 
76, VI. 1.61 etc.) 
In fact, he has 
begun the enumeration of taddhita 
affixes with the rule afgcfT: ( P. IV. r»' 
76) by putting the term fifer for 
affixes such as it, «)f, s^etc! which 
are mentioned thereafter. In his 
rule ^TlfertmraTai and in .the Vartti- 
ka 
< I. 4.1 Vart. 41)
which are similar to V. Pr. 1. 27 
quoted above, the word fffer app­
ears. to be actually used for words 
derived from nouns by secondary 
affixes, along with the word fig; 
which also means words derived 
from roots, although commentators 
have -explained there the terms 
and ?rfer for 
and cT^cTRT. The 
term ftfer is evidently echoed in 
the Sutra 
ftcPL which, although 
it is not the first Sutra of the 
taddhita section, may imply that 
there were possibly long lists of 
sscoadary aouns with the senses of

secondary suffixes, and nfer was 
perhaps, the first sense given there. 
The number of taddhita suffixes 
mentioned by Panini is quite a large 
one ; there are in fact n ro  rules 
given in the taddhita section cover­
ing almost two Adhyayas viz. from 
P. IV. 1.76 to the end of the fifth 
Adhyaya. The main sub-divisions 
of taddhita affixes mentioned by 
commentators are, Apatyadyartha- 
ka ( IV. 1.92 to 178 ), Raktadyarth- 
aka (IV . 2.1 to 91), Saisika (IV .
2. 92 to IV. 3.133 ), Pragdlvyatlya 
(IV . 3.134 to 168), Pragvahatlya 
( IV. 4.1 to IV. 4.74 ), Pragghitlya 
( IV. 4.75 to IV. 4.109 )j Arhiya 
(V . 1. 1 to 71), Thanadhikarastha 
( V. 1.72 to V. 1.1x4 )> Bhavakarm- 
arthaka (V. 1. 115 to V. 1. 136), 
Pancamika ( V. 2.1 to V. 2.93), 
Matvarthlya ( V. 2.94 to V. 2. 140), 
Vibhaktisamjnaka (V . 3.1 to V. 
3.26) and Svarthika ( V. 3.27 to V. 
4.160 ). 
The samasanta affixes ( V. 
4„68 to V. 4.160 ) can be included 
in the Svarthika affixes.

have been revised from time to 
time and taught by various acaryas

the followers of the

ed into two main parts, each of

sections called adhyayas, and dis­
cusses the various topics such as 
letters and their propertirs, accents,

or 
also. A work on Pari-
bhasas named 
in which
Paribhasas are explained and estab­
lished as based on the Katantra 
Vyakarana sutras, is attributed to 
Durgasimha. It is doubtful whether 
this commentator Durgasimha is 
the same as Durgacarya, the famous 
commentator of Yaska’s Nirukta. 
There is a legend that Durgasimha 
was the brother of Vikramaditya, 
the founder of the Vikrama Era.

\gftq4 lit. meaning of a root, the verbal 
activity, named ferr or *rr$; cf.
fe i; M. Bh. on III. 2.84, III,
2.115. 
The verbal activity is des­
cribed generally to be made up of 
a series of continuous subordinate 
activities carried on by the different 
karakas or agents and instruments 
of verbal activity helping the pro­
cess of the main activity. 
When 
the process of the verbal activity is 
complete, the completed activity is
looked upon as a substantive or 
dravya and a word denoting it, such 
as TOi, or qin does not get conjuga- 
tional affixes, but it is regularly 
declined like a noun. 
Just as w #, 
T®1F, ^ 1 ,  and TO35 are given as 
srifrefen'J, in the same manner feiT, 
SW,

given as to?#, as they are shown by 
a verbal form, although strictly, 
speaking verbal activity ( fen or 
sir) alone is the sense of a root, as 
stated in the Mahabhasya.

Tasgaon in Satara District, who 
received his education in Benares. 
For some years he stayed under 
the patronage of Rama, the king 
of Srngibera at his time. He was

a particle which -possesses no

Nipata is given as one 
of the four categories of words viz. 
snrrq;, sn^RT, 
and ftqTcr by all 
the ancient writers of Pratisakhya, 
Vyakarana and Nirukta works ; cf. 
Nir. I. 4, M .Bh. on I. 1.

The Nipatas are looked upon as 
possessed of no sense; cf. frmcr: 
TOSjq; R. Pr. X II. 8, V. Pr. VIII. 
50, (com. by U vvata). Panini has 
not given any 
definition of the 
word friTO, but he has enumerated 
them as forming a class with =% at 
their head in the rule 
where the word sfer% conveys an 
impression that they possess no 
sense, the sense 
being 
of 
two 
kinds 
and 
and the Nipatas 
not possessing any one of the two. 
The impression is made rather
firm 
by the 
statement 
of 
the 
Varttikakara- “ rcqRrctrc'Nrer s # - 
P- !• 2- 45 Vart. 12. 
Thus, 
the question whether the 
Nipatas possess any sense by them­
selves or not, becomes a difficult 
one to be answered. Although the 
Rkprati^akhya in X II. 8 lays down 
that the Nipatas are expletive, still 
in the next verse it says that some 
of them do possess sense; cf. §Jqrai-
% e rw : on
which Uvvata remarks 
ffmcTT: 
I The remark 
of Uvvata appears to be a sound 
one as based on actual observa­
tion, and the conflicting views have 
to be reconciled. This is done by 
Bhartrhari who lays down that 
Nipatas never directly convey the 
sense but they indicate the sense. 
Regarding the sense indicated by 
the Nipatas, it is said that the sense 
is never Sattva or Dravya or sub­
stance as remarked by Panini; it is 
a certain kind of relation and that 
too, is not directly expressed by 
them but it is indicated. Bhoja in 
his Srngaraprakasa 
gives a very 
comprehensive definition of Nipata 
as
ftqrraT: 1
He gives six varieties of them, viz.
srgqKi#, 
fJ&snt, 
and 
3*f^{%Tfi^it#, 
and 
mentions more than a thousand of 
them. For details see Bhartrhari’s 
Vakyapadlya II. 189-206.
the view that the nipatas 
and the upasargas too, as cont­
rasted with nouns, pronouns and 
other indeclinables, only indicate 
the sense and do not denote i t ; 
this view, as grammarians say, was 
implied in the Mahabhasya and 
was prominently given in the Vak­
yapadlya by Bhartfhari which was

followed by almost all later gra­
mmarians. See fjpncT.

V. 4.77 etc. etc. The
phrase mtcRlfigs^is very frequen­

some technical difficulties in the 
formation, of a word are not some­
times to be taken into considera­

name of a class of works which 
were composed to explain the collec­
tions of Vedic words by means of 
proposing derivations of those words 
from roots as would suit the sense. 
The Nirukta works are looked upon
as supplementary to grammar works 
and there must have been a good 
many works of this kind in ancient 
times as shown by references to the 
writers of these viz. Upamanyu, 
Sakatayana, Sakapuni, Sakapurti 
and others, but, out of them only 
one work composed by Yaska has 
survived; the word, hence has been 
applied by scholars to the Nirukta of 
Yaska which is believed to have 
been written in the seventh or the 
eighth century B.C. i.e. a century 
or two before Panini. 
The Nirukta 
works were looked upon as subsi­
diary to the study of the Vedas 
along with works on 
phonetics 
( ftl5JT), 
rituals 
( 
), 
grammar 
( 
) prosody (
)
 and astro­
nomy (
)
 and a mention of 
them is found made in the Chando- 
gyopanisad. 
As many of the deri­
vations in the Nirukta appear to be 
forced and fanciful, it is doubtful 
whether the Nirkuta works could 
be called scientific treatise^ ©The 
work of Yaska, however, has got 
its own importance and place among 
works subsidiary to the Veda, being 
a very old work of that kind and 
quoted by 
later 
commentators. 
There were some glosses and com­
mentary works written upon Yaska’s 
Nirukta out of which the one by 
Durgacarya is a scholarly one. It is 
doubtful whether Durgacarya is the 
same as Durgasimha, who wrote a 
Vrtti or gloss on the Katantra Vya­
karana. 
The word 
is found in 
the Pratisakhya works in the sense 
of * explained ’ and not in the sense 
of derived; cf. R. Pr. XV. 6; V. Pr.
IV. 19,195.

'Tf'fecT writer of Citprabha, a com­

on 
the 
Paribhasendu-

LaghuSabdendulekhara is also as­
cribed to him. 
He was a Gauda 
Brahmana whose native place was 
Kuruksetra. He lived in the begin­
ning of the nineteenth century.
the reputed author 
of 
the 
Mahabhasya, known as the Patafi- 
jala Mahabhasya after him. 
His 
date is determined definitely as the 
second century B.C. on the strength 
of the internal evidence supplied by 
the text of the Mahabhasya itself. 
The words Gonardlya and Gonika- 
putra which are found in the Maha­
bhasya are believed to be referring 
to the author himself and,. on their 
strength, he.is said to have been the 
son of Gonika and a resident of the 
country called Gonarda in his days. 
On the strength of the internal 
evidence supplied by the Maha­
bhasya, it can be said that Patanjali 
received his education, at Taksasila 
and that he was, just like Panini, 
very familiar with pillages and to wns 
in and near Va^ika. and Gandhi.ra 
countries. 
Nothing can definitely 
be said about his birth-place, and

232
although it might be believed that 
his native place was Gonarda, its 
exact situation has not been defined 
so far. 
About his parentage too, 
no definite information is available. 
Tradition says that he was the 
foster-son of a childless woman 
named Gonika to whom he was 
handed over by a sage of Gonarda, 
in whose hands he fell down from 
the sky in the evening at the time 
of the offering of water-handfuls to 
the Sun in the w est; cf. wg, +  bis# , 
the derivation of the word given by 
the commentators. 
Apart from an­
ecdotes and legendary information, 
it can be said with certainty that 
Patanjali was a thorough scholar of 
Sanskrit Grammar who had studied 
the available texts of the Vedic 
Literature and Grammar and avail­
ed himself of information gathered 
personally by visiting the various 
schools of Sanskrit Grammar and 
observing the methods of explana­
tions given by teachers there. 
His 
Mahabhasya supplies an invaluable 
fund of information on the ways in 
which' the Grammar mles of Panjni 
were explained in those days in the 
various grammar schools. 
This in­
formation is supplied by him in the 
Varttikas which he has exhaustively 
given and explained. 
He had a re­
markable mastery over Sanskrit 
Language which was a spoken one 
at his time and it can be safely said 
that in respect of style, the Maba: 
bhasya excels all the, other, Bhasyas 
in the different branches of learning 
put pf which two, those of Sabara- 
swamin 
and 
Sankaracarya, are 
selected for comparison. It is believ­
ed by scholars that he was equally 
conyersant with other sastras, espe­
cially Yoga and Vaidyaka, on which 
he has written learned treatises. He 
is said to be the author of the Yoga-
sutras, which, hence, are called 
Patanjala Yogasutras, and the red­
actor of the CarakasamhitS. 
There 
are scholars who believe that he 
wrote the Mahabha§ya pnly, and 
npt the other two. They base their 
argument mainly on the supposition 
that it is impossible for a scholar to 
have 
an 
equally 
unmatching 
mastery over three different sastras 
at a time- 
The argument has no 
strength, especially in India, where 
there are many instances of scholars 
possessing sound 
scholarship 
in 
different 
branches 
of 
learning. 
Apart from legends and statements 
of Cakradhara, Nagesa and others, 
about his being the author of three 
works on three different sastras, 
there is a direct reference to Patan­
jali's proficiency in Grammar, Yoga 
and Medicine in the work of King 
Bhoja of the eleventh century and an 
indirect one in the Vakyapadlya of 
Bhartrhari pf the seventh century 
A.D . There is a work on the life of 
Patanjali, written by a scholar of 
grammar of the South, 
named 
Ramabhadra, which 
gives many 
stories and incidents of his life out 
of which it is difficult to find out 
the grains of true incidents from the 
legendary husk with which they 
are covered. For details, see Patan­
jala Mahabhasya, D. E. Society’s 
edition, Yol. VII pages 349 to 374.

The definition ‘ 3}#:
is attributed to the ancient gram-' 
marian * Indra *, who is believed to 
have been the 'first Grammarian of 
India. Panini has defined the term 
q^ as ‘ 
q ^ ’ P. I. 4.T4. 
His 
definition is applicable to complete 
noun-forms and verb-forms and also 
to prefixes and indeclinables where 
a case-affix is placed and elided 
according to him ; cf. 
p.
II. 4.82. The noun-bases before case 
affixes and tad. affixes, mentioned 
in rules upto the end of the fifth 
adhyaya, which begin with a con­
sonant excepting ^ are also termed 
q? by Panini to include parts of 
words before the case affixes 
f*na., g etc. as also before the tad. 
affixes Jig;, 
etc. which are given 
as separate padas many times in the 
pada-patha of the Vedas; cf. ?nfc-
P. 1. 4.17. See for details 
the word q^qis. There are given 
four kinds of padas or words viz. 
’jm, airier, a*rair and fJraicr in the 
Niiukta and Pratisakhya works; cf.

The verb endings or affixes ffr, is, 
and others are also called q^. The 
word q^ in this sense is never used 
alone, but with the word q^r or 
snw% preceding it. The term q^q^ 
stands for the nine affixes fsq., erg, 
...TO., while the term sTiw%q^stands 
for the nine affixes <r3 strain 
cf. 
q^q^ ., a^ F n w ^ q^ . 
It is 
possible to say that in the terms 
TO^q^ and 3iRji%q^ also, the term q^ 
could be taken to inean a word, and
It is very likely that the words t o -  
q^ and 
were originally used
in the sense of * words referring 
to something meant for another’ 
and ' referring to something mant 
forself * respectively. Such words, 
of course, referred to verbal forms, 
roughly corresponding to the verbs 
in the active voice and verbs in the 
passive voice. There ate some mod­
ern scholars of grammar, especially 
linguists, who like to translate q ^ q ?  
as * active voice' and 3ftm%q? as
* passive voice ’. Panini appears, 
however, to have adapted the sense 
of the terms qr?%q? and 
and
taken them to mean mere affixes 
just as he has done in the case of 
the terms iq/and aUjcT. Presumably 
in ancient times, words current in 
use were grouped into four classes 
by the authors of the Nirukta works, 
viz. ( a ) fsi; ( words derived from 
roots) such as sfirtf, 
etc.,
( b ) fffe r (words derived 
from 
nouns) such as 
etc.p
( c ) Parasmaipada words viz. verbs 
such as *?=}%, q^%, and ( d ) Atma­
nepada words i.e. verbs like
etc. Verbs 
and j #  or 
and 
were looked upon as both 
words and 
words. The
question of simple words, as they are 
called by the followers of Pacini, 
such as 5tf,3\3.nr,3r*, and a number 
of similar underived words, did not 
occur to the authors of the Nirukta 
as they believed that every noun

heface could 
be

Pada-text. The term is applied to 
ancient Vedic scholars 
3Tl%*J,
and others who wrote the 
Padapatha of the Vedic Samhitas. 
The 
term 
is 
applied 
possibly 
through misunderstanding by some 
scholars to the Mahabhasyakara 
who has not divided any Vedic 
Samhita, but has,, in fact, pointed 
out a few errors of the Padakaras 
and stated categorically that gra­
mmarians 
need not follow 
the 
Padapatha, but, rather, the writers 
of the 
Padapatha 
should 
have 
followed 
the rules of grammar. 
Patanjali, in fact, 
refers by the 
term 
to 
Katyayana, 
who
wrote the Padapatha; and the Pra­
tisakhya of the Vajasaneyi-Samhita

According to the 
Padasamskara alternative, 
every 
word is formed independently, and 
after formation the words are syn­
tactically connected and used in a 
sentence. The sense of the sentence 
too, is understood after the sense of 
every word has been understood; 
cf.

alternative viz. 
a whole
sentence is brought before the mind

Many times the writers of Sutras 
lay down certain conventions for 
the proper interpretation of their 
rules, to which additions are made 
in coarse of time according to neces­
sities that arise, by commentators. 
In the different systems of gram­
mar there are different collections 
of Paribhasas. 
In Panini’s system, 
apart from commentaries thereon, 
there are independent collections 
of Paribhasas by Vyadi, Bhojadeva, 
Purusottamadeva, Siradeva, Nila- 
kantha, Haribhaskara, Nagesa and 
a few others. There are independ­
ent collections of Paribhasas in the 
Katantra, 
Candra, 
Sakatayana, 
Jainendra and Hemacandra systems 
of grammar. It is a noticeable fact 
that many Paribhasas are common, 
with their wordings quite similar or 
sometimes identical in the different 
systems. 
Generally the collections 
of Paribhasas have got scholiums 
or commentaries 
by 
recognised 
grammarians, which in their turn 
have sometimes other glosses or 
commentaries upon them. ThePari-

TIPnFt the illustrious ancient 
gram­
marian of India who is well-known 
by his magnum opus, the Astaka or 
Astadhyayi which has maintained 
its position as a unique work on 
Sanskrit grammar unparalleled upto 
the present day by any other work 
on grammar, not only of the Sans­
krit language, but of any other 
language, classical as well as spoken. 
His mighty intelligence grasped, 
studied and digested not only the 
niceties of accentuation and forma- 
- 
tion of Vedic words, scattered in 
the vast Vedic Literature of his
time, but those of classical words 
in the classical literature and the 
spoken Sanskrit language of his 
time in all its different aspects and 
shades, noticeable in the various 
provinces and districts of the vast 
country. 
The result of his careful 
study of the Vedic Literature and 
close observation of the classical 
Sanskrit, which was a spoken langu­
age in his days, was.the production 
of the wonderful and monumental 
work, the Astadhyayi, which gives 
an authoritative description of the 
Sanskrit language, to have a com­
plete exposition of which, several 
life times have to be spent, in spite 
of several commentaries upon it, 
written from time to time by several 
distinguished scholars. The work is 
a 
linguist’s and .not a language 
teacher’s. 
Some Western scholars 
have described it as a wonderful 
specimen of human intelligence, or 
as a notable manifestation of human 
intelligence. 
Very little is known 
unfortunately 
about 
his native 
place, parentage or personal history. 
The account given ab.out these in 
the Kathasaritsagara 
and 
other 
books is only legendary and hence, 
it has very little historical value. 
The internal evidence, supplied by 
his work shows that he lived in the 
sixth or the seventh century B.C., 
if not earlier, in the north western 
province of India of those days. 
Jinendrabuddhi, the author of the 
Kasikavivaranapanjika or Nyasa, 
has stated that the word qrsrgic men­
tioned by him in his sfltra ( IV. 
3.94 ) refers to his native place and 
the word 
derived by him
from the word 2jF«5T$|<c by that sutra 
was, in ' fact his own name, based 
upon the name of the town which 
formed his native place. Panini has 
shown in his work his close knowl­

247
edge of, and familiarity with, the 
names of towns, villages, districts, 
rivers and mountains in and near 
Vahlka, the north-western Punjab 
of the present day, and it is very 
likely that he was educated at the 
ancient University of 
Taksasila. 
Apart from the authors of the Prati­
sakhya works, which in a way could 
be styled as grammar works, there 
were scholars of grammar as such, 
who preceded him and out of whom 
he has mentioned ten viz. Apisali, 
Sakatayana, 
Gargya, 
Sakalya, 
Kasyapa, 
Bharadvaja, 
Galava, 
Cakravarmana, Senaka and Sphota- 
yana. 
The'grammarian Indra has 
not been mentioned by Panini, al­
though tradition says that he was 
the first grammarian of the Sanskrit 
language. It is very likely that 
Panini had no grammar work of 
Indra before him, but at the same 
time it can be said that the works 
of some grammarians mentioned by 
Panini such as Sakatayana, Apisali, 
Gargya and others had been based 
on the work of Indra. The mention 
of several gsnas as also the exhaus­
tive enumeration of all the two 
thousand and two hundred roots in 
the 
Dhatupatha 
can very well 
testify to the existence of systematic 
grammatical works before Paijini of 
which he has made a thorough 
study and a careful use in the com­
position 
of 
his Ganapatha and 
Dhatupatha. His exhaustive gram­
mar of a rich language like Sanskrit 
has not only remained superb in 
spite of several other grammars of 
the language written subsequently, 
but its careful study is felt as a 
supreme necessity by scholars- of 
philology and linguistics of the pre­
sent day for doing any real work in 
the vast field of linguistic research.

As nine sutras out of these are des­
cribed as Varttikas and two as 
Ganasutras by Patanjali, it is evi­
dent that there were 3972 Sutras 
in the Astaka of Panini according 
to Patanjali. A verse current among 
Vaiyakarana schools

the 
number to be 3996; cf. sftfnr

name 
given 
to 
the 
collection of 
explanatory 
pithy 
notes of the type of Sutras written 
mainly by Katyayana. 
The Vart­
tikas are generally written in the 
style of the Sutras, but sometimes 
they are written in verse 
also. 
The total number of Varttikas is 
well-nigh above 5000, 
including 
Varttikas in Verse. There are three 
kinds of Varttikas; cf.
f e n  
1 i
ll 
NageSa appears to have 
divided Varttikas into two classes

248
as shown by his definition ‘
If this
definition be followed, many of the 
Varttikas given in the Mahabhasya 
as 
explaining 
and 
commenting 
upon the Siitras will not strictly 
be termed as Varttikas, and their 
total number which is given as 
exceeding 5000; will be reduced 
to about 1400 or so. 
There are 
some 
manuscript 
copies 
which 
give this reduced number, and it 
may be said that only these Vartti­
kas were written by Katyayana 
while the others were added by 
learned grammarians after Katya­
yana. In the Mahabhasya there are 
seen more than 5000 statements of 
the type of- Varttikas out of which 
Dr. Kielhorn has marked about 
4200 as Varttikas. At some places 
the Mahabhasyakara has quoted 
the names of the authors of some 
Varttikas or their schools, in words 
such as 
7sf%, 
75%,
atainF: qsfar. etc. 
Many of the 
Varttikas given in the Mahabhasya 
are not seen in the Kasikavrtti, 
while some more are seen in the 
Kasikavrtti, which, evidently are 
composed by scholars who flourish­
ed after Patanjali, as they have not 
been noticed by the Mahabhasya­
kara. It is very difficult to show 
separately the statements of the 
Bhasyakara popularly named 'Isfis* 
from the Varttikas of Katyayana 
and others. For details see Vol. 
VII Mahabhasya, D. E. Society’s 
edition, pp. 193-214.
a gloss on the grammar 
rules of Panini. Many glosses were 
written from time to time on the 
Sutras of Panini, out of which the 
most important and the oldest one 
is the one 
named 
Kasikavrtti, 
written by the joint authors Jaya-
ditya and 
Vamana in the 7th 
century A.D. It is belived that the 
Kasikavrtti was based upon some 
old Vrttis said to have been written 
by fPr,
and others. Besides Kasika, the 
famous Vrtti, and those of jPt, fo fj 
and others which are only reported, 
there are pther Vrttis which are 
comparatively 
modern. Some of 
them have 
been printed, while 
others

available from a Sutravrtti called 
Bhagavrtti which is ascribed to 
Bhartrhari, but, which is evidently

works on grammar are ascribed to 
him, the prominent ones among 
which are the Bhasavrtti and the 
Paribhasavrtti, the Ganavrtti and 
the Jnapakasamuccaya and a com­

with a view to including all letters 
beginning with the letter uttered 
and 
ending 
with the letter that

attributed 
to 
Indra.

given the method of forming the 
Pratyaharas and he has profusely 
used them. For a list of Pratya­

The treatise ex­
plains many words which, although 
current in language and literature, 
cannot be easily formed by rules of 
grammar. The author has tried to 
form them by . applying rules of 
grammar given in the grammatical 
systems of Panini and Katantra. 
The alphabet given in this treatise 
is according to the system of the 
Tantra 
Sastra 
which 
shows a 
scholarship of. the author in that 
branch. The grammar was studied 
much in Bengal and Assam.

1 The original form of 
words. It originally included roots 
also. Ancient 
works like Sabda 
parayana included them aU. The 
term infaq#?;, although mentioned 
in the Brahmaiia 
works, is not 
found in the Pratisakhya works 
probably because those works were 
concerned with formed words which 
had been actually in use. The regu­
lar division of a word into the base 
( si^f?) and 
the 
affix ( sra?) is 
available, first in the grammar of 
Panini, who has given two kinds of 
bases, the noun-base and the verb- 
base. 
The noun-base 
is named 
Pratipadika by him while the verb- 
base is named Dhatu. The defini­
tion of Pratipadika is given by him 
as a word which is possessed of 
sense, but which is neither a root 
nor a suffix ; cf, 
jfj%-
q-fep;. P. I. 2.45. Although his 
definition 
includes, the 
Krdanta 
words, the taddbitanta words and 
the compound words, still, Panini 
has mentioned them separately in 
the rule frafegfTTHMJ P. I. 2,45 to 
distinguish 
them 
as 
secondary 
noun-bases as compared with the 
primary 
noun-bases 
which 
are 
mentioned in the rule 3Tlpi^rT$p;q$qq: 
Thus, Panini implies four 
kinds of Pratipadikas 
f  iftT, 
cffecIFtT and etrrcj. The Varttikakara 
appears to have given nine kinds-

Ulf?R11^ . a  work on Vedic grammar 
of a -specific . nature, 
which is 
concerned mainly with the changes, 
euphonic and others, in the Pada 
text of the Samhita as compared 
with the running text,.theSamhita 
itself. The Pratisakhya works are 
neither concerned with the sense of 
words, nor with their division into 
bases and affixes, nor with their 
etymology. They contain, more or 
less, Vedic passages arranged from 
the point of view of Samdhi. In 
the 
Rk 
Pratisakhya, 
available 
. to-day, 
topics of metre, 
recital, 
phonetics and the like are introduc- 
' ed, but it appears that originally 
the IJ.k Pratisakhya, j ust like the 
Atharva Pratisakhya, was concern­
ed with euphonic 
changes, the 
other 'subjects being 
introduced 
later on. The word 
shows
that there wereJ such treatises for

everyone of the several Sakhas or 
branches of each Veda many of 
which later on disappeared as the 
number of the followers of those 
■branches dwindled. Out 
of the 
remaining ones also, 
many were 
combined with others of the same 
Veda. A t present, only five or six 
Pratisakhyas are available which 
are the surviving representatives of 
the ancient ones— the Ilk Prati­
sakhya by Saunaka, the Taittiriya
. 
Pratisakhya, the Vaj asaneyi Prati­
sakhya by Katyayana, the Atharva 
Pratisakhya and the Rk Tantra by 
Sakatayana, which is practically a 
Pratisakhya of 
the Sama . Veda. 
The word 
or 
was also
used for the Pratisakhyas as they 
were the outcome of the discussions 
of learned scholars iii Vedic assem­
blies ; cf. <Tft*rfar 
. Although 
the Pratisakhya works in. nature, 
are 
preliminary . to 
works 
on 
grammar, it appears that the exist­
ing PratiSakhyas, 
which are the 
revised and enlarged editions of the 
old ones; are written after Panini’s 
grammar, each one of the present
, Pratisakhyas.representing, of course, 
several 
ancient 
PratiSakhyas, 
which were written before Panini. 
Uvvata, a learned scholar of the 
twelfth century has written a brief 
commentary on the Ilk Pratisakhya 
and another one on the Vajasaneyi 
Pratisakhya. The Taittiriya Piati­
sakhya has got two commentaries 
— one by Somayarya, called Tri- 
bhasyaratna and the other called 
Vaidikabharana written by6Gopala- 
yajvan. There is a commentary by 
Ananta Bhatta. on the Vajasaneyi 
PratiSakhya. These commentaries 
are called Bhasyas also.

a 
reputed 
scholar belonging to the Eastern 
school of grammarians which flouri­
shed in Bengal and Behar in the

294
loth, n th  and 12th centuries. The 
gloss is very useful for beginners 
and it has given a clear explanation 
of the 
different 
sutras without 
going into 
difficult niceties and 
discussions. The treatise does not 
comment upon Vedic portions or 
rules referring to Vedic Language 
because, as the legend goes, king 
Laksmana Sena, for whom the gloss 
was written, was not qualified to 
understand 
Vedic 
Language; cf.

lit. the great commentary. 
The word is 
uniformly used by 
commentators and classical Sans­
krit writers for the reputed comm­
entary on Panini’s Sijtras and the 
Varttikas thereon, by Patanjali in 
the 2nd century B.C. 
The comm­
entary is very scholarly yet very 
simple in style, and exhaustive 
although omitting a .number of 
Panini’s rules. It is the first and 
oldest existing commentary on the 
Astadhyayi of Panini, and, in spite 
of some other commentaries and 
glosses 
and 
other 
compendia 
written later on 
to explain the 
Sutras of Panini, it has remained 
supremely authoritative and fur­
nishes the last and final word in all 
places of doubt; cf. the remarks 
i t
etc. scattered here and there in 
several Vyakarana treatises forming, 
in fact, the patent words used by 
commentators when they finish any 
, chain of arguments. 
Besides com­
menting on. the Sutras of Panini, 
Patanjali, the author, has raised 
many other grammatical issues and 
after discussing them fully 
and 
thoroughly, given his conclusions 
which have become the final dicta 
in those matters. 
The work, in 
short, has become an encyclopaedic 
one and hence aptly called 
or 
Biro. 
The work is spread over such 
a wide field of grammatical studies 
that not a single grammatical issue 
appears to have been left out. The 
author appears to have made a 
close study of the method and ex­
planations of the Sutras of Panini 
given at various academies all over 
the country and incorporated the 
gist of those studies given in the 
form of Varttikas- at the various 
places, in his great work. 
He has 
thoroughly scrutinized and com­
mented upon the Varttikas many 
of which he has approved, some of 
which he has rejected< and a few of 
which he has supplemented. Besides 
the Varttikas which are referred to 
above, he has quoted stanzas which 
verily sum up the arguments in ex­
planation of the difficult sutras, 
composed by his predecessors. There 
is a good reason to believe that 
there were small glosses or com­
mentaries on the Sutras of Panini 
written by learned teachers at the 
various academies, and the Varttikas 
formed in a way, a short pithy 
summary of those glosses or Vrttis. 
The explanation of the word =rar 
org 
given by Kaiyata may
be quoted in support of this point. 
Kaiyata 
has at one place even 
stated that the argument of the 
Bhasyakara is-in consonance with 
that of Kurti, his predecessor 
The 
work is divided into eightyfive sec­
tions which are given the name of 
lesson or 
by the author, pro­
bably because they form the subject 
matter of one day’s study each, if 
the student has already made a 
thorough study of the subject and 
is very sharp in intelligence, cf. 3?§r 
fMtra; 
(the 
explanation
given by the commentators). Many 
commentary works were written on 
this magnum opus of Patanjali 
during the long period of twenty 
centuries upto this time under the 
names Star, fecqufr,
= w r , 
?gft, ira, spftqr, sqreqm
and the like, but only one of them

is found
complete. The learned commentary 
by Bhartrhari, 
written 
five cen­
turies before the Pradipa, is avail­
able only in a fragment and that 
too, in a manuscript form copied 
down from the original one from 
time to time by the scribes very

carelessly. The available comment­
ary is upto the first seven Ahnikas 
of Mahabhasya 
(upto P. 1.1.53). 
Two other commentaries which are 
comparatively modern, written by 
Narayanasesa and Nllakantha are 
available biit they are also incom­
plete and in a manuscript form. 
Possibly Kaiyatabhatta’s Pradipa 
threw into the background 
the 
commentaries of his predecessors 
and no grammarian after Kaiyata 
dared write a commentary superior 
to Kaiyata’s Pradipa or, if he 
began, he had to abandon his work 
in the middle. 
The commentary of 
Kaiyata is such a scholarly one and 
so written to the point, that later 
commentators have almost identifi­
ed the original Bhasya. with the 
commentary Pradipa and many a 
time expressed the 
two 
words

denotation of two 
or more things by one single mem­
ber by virtue of their being put 
together in a dvandva compound 
of two or more words; the gram­
marians advocate this doctrine stat­
ing that in a dvandva compound 
such as qzqfr or 
, the word m  
has the capacity of expressing the 
sense of both qs and qs, which in a 
sentence •qz: qzsi, it does not possess. 
Similarly qz also has the capacity of 
conveying the sense of both qs and 
m . Possibly this theory is advocat­
ed by grammarians, on the analogy 
of words like f e ll or HRTCT for TOI- 
wiwr for

division of a rule which has 
been traditionally given as one sin­

formation of certain words, which 
otherwise are likely to be stamped

author of the Mahabhasya have 
very frequently taken recourse to 
this method of 3tirft*nn ; cf. P.1 1.3

removing difficulties and has to be 
followed as a last recourse, the 
Varttikakara has suggested it very 
often, and sometimes a sutra which 
is divided by the Varttikakara into

recognised as a

( i)  a reputed ancient gram-
- marian who 
is 
identified 
with 
Katyayana, the prominent author 
of the Varttikas on the Sutras of 
Panini. Both the names 
and 
are mentioned in comment­
ary works in connection with the 
Varttikas on the Sutras of Panini, 
and it is very likely that Vararnci 
was the individual name of the 
scholar, and Katyayana his family 
name. 
The words <SJPI and 
are found used in fslokavarttikas in 
the Mahabhasya on P. H I. 2,3 and
III. 2.1 r8 where references made 
are actually found in the prose

There is no reference at all in the 
Mahabhasya

mmarian later than Patanjali, who
has been associated with Sarvavar­
man, (the author of the first three 
Adhyayas of the Katantra Sutras), 
as the author of the fourth Adhya­
ya. Patanjali does not associate
with Katyayana at all. His 
mention of ^ f%  as a writer of a 
Kavya is a sufficient testimony for 
that. Henc-% it appears probable 
that Katyayana, 
to 
whom the 
authorship of the Vajasaneyi Prati­
sakhya and many other works allied 
with Veda has been attributed, was 
not associated^ with Vararuci by 
Patanjali, and. it is only the later 
writers who identified the gramma­
rian Vararuci, who composed the 
fourth Adhyaya of the Katantra 
Grammar and wrote a Prakrit Gra­
mmar and some other grammar 
works, with 
the ancient revered 
Katyayana, the author of Vartti­
kas, the Vajasaneyi Pratisakhya 
and the Pnspasutra; (3 ) There 
was a comparatively modem gra­
mmarian named

small treatise on genders of words 
consisting of about 125 stanzas 
with a commentary named Linga-

Panini 
has not mentioned them actually 
but the fourteen Siva Sutras, on 
which he has based his work, men­
tion only 9 vowels and 34 conso- 
nants, the long vowels being looked 
upon as varieties of the short ones. 
The Siksa of Panini mentions 63 or 
64 letters, adding 
the letter s  
(1.^38); cf. % fa:

Pratisakhya adds four 
( Visarga, 
Jihvamuliya, 
Upadhmanlya 
and 
Anusvara) to the forty three given 
in the Siva Sutras and mentions 47. 
The Taittiriya Pratisakhya men­
tions 52 letters viz. 16 vowels, 25 
class consonants, 4 semivowels, six 
sibilants ( Wi, %, ft, f., 
-% ) 
and 
anusvara. 
The 
Vajasaneyi 
PratiSakhya mentions 65 letters 3 
varieties of sr, ir, 3, m and 
two 
varieties of <?, K, sit, aft, 25 class- 
consonants, four semivowels, four 
sibilants, and fsifiJj#!, aqstnifta, WJ-

V. Pr. VIII. 25. The Rk Tantra 
gives 57 letters viz. 14 vowels. 25

sibilants, 
Visarga, 
Jihvamuliya, 
Upadhmanlya, Anunasika, 4 yamas
and 
two 
Anusvaras. 
The 
§.k 
Tantra gives two different serial 
orders, the Uddesa ( common ), and 
the Upadeia 
( tiaditional). 
The 
common order or Uddesa gives the
14 vowels beginning with sr, then 
the 25 class consonants, then the 
four semivowels, the four sibilants 
and lastly the eight ayogavahas, viz. 
the visarjanlya and others. 
The 
traditional order gives the diph­
thongs first, then long vowels ' ( arr, ■
3[, f  and ® ) then short vowels 
( %  cE, f, 3 and lastly sr ), then semi­
vowels, then the five fifth conso­
nants, the five fourths, the five 
thirds, the five seconds, the five 
firsts, then the four sibilants and 
then the eight ayogavaha letters 
and two Anusvaras instead of one 
anusvara.

followed the traditional order with 
a few changes that are necessary for 
the technique of his work.

possess the sense, as individually in

f.jje theory or view that indi­
vidual letters are severally possess­

the difference in the meanings of

the difference in their initial letter..

far as the interpretation or the 
expression of sense is concerned, 
the sentence alone being capable of 
conveying the sense, the formation 
of individual words in a sentence 
is explained by putting them in a 
sentence and knowing their mutual 
relationship. The word jih; cannot 
be explained singly by showing the

Vasudevadik§ita was a resident of 
Tanjore who lived in the beginning 
of the eighteenth century A.D. and 
wrote a few works on Purvaml- 
mamsa.
373J3HT ( 
) surnamed Abhyankar, 
who lived from 1863 to 1942 and 
did vigorous and active work of 
teaching pupils and writing essays, 
articles, commentary works and 
original works on various Sastras 
with 
the same scholarship, zeal 
and acumen for fifty years in Poona. 
He wrote JjstfsRKr, a commentary 
on the Laghusabdendusekhara and 
a commentary on the Pari- 
bhasendusekhara in 1889. His works 
total more than twenty-five. His 
edition 
of the Patanjala 
Maha­

with full translation and 
notes in Marathi can be called his 
magnum opus. See 31*43^.

an affix placed between a root

jugational signs 1^, 
§, ^r, -sr^, 
3, -Sir and qfj, arrq., as also ^zr, 313,, 
fill., 
and ^3 with its substitutes. 
Although the term f^Wl is used by 
ancient grammarians and 
freely 
used by the 
Mahabhasyakara in 
connection with the affixes, menti­
oned in the sutras of Panini, such 
as ^ra., 
and others, the term is 
not found in the Sutras of Panini. 
The vikaranas are different from 
the major kinds of the 
regular 
affixes 
and other similar
' ones. The vikaranas can be called 
fisC; so also, as they are mentioned 
in the topic ( srfq-JRR;) of affixes or

an ancient term used in the 
Pratisakhya works for a stop or 
pause in general at the end of . a 
word, or at the end of the first 
member of a compound, which is 
shown split up in the Padapatha, 
or inside a word, or at the end of a 
word, or at the end of a vowel when 
it is followed by another vowel. The 
duration of this virama is different 
in 
different 
circumstances; but 
sometimes under the same circum­
stances, it is described differently 
in the different Pratisakhyas. Gener­
ally, there is no pause between two 
consonants as also between a vowel 
and a consonant preceding or follow­
ing it. 
The Taittiriya Pratisakhya 
has given four kinds of 
( a ) 
*k(N<W, pause at the end of a foot 
or a verse of duration equal to three 
matras or moras, ( b ) W w r  pause 
between two 
words of duration 
equal to two matras; e.g. f t  f*?T «§r 
cqfT, ( c ) pause between two words 
the preceding one of which ends in 
a vowel and the following begins 
with a vowel, the vowels being not 
euphonically combined ; this pause 
has a duration of one matra e.g. g 
fTO:, 5T 
, ( d ) pause between 
two vowels inside a word which is a 
rare occurrence; this has a duration 
of half a matra; e.g.

which has both the vowels short, 
and mTfaqir which has got both the

is given in the Siksa where their 
duration is given as one matra, one

a
treatise on the use of words written 
as a helpful guide to Sanskrit 
writers, by a grammarian named 
Somayajin in 1848 A.D.
Import of a sentence 
according to the grammarians, in 
which verbal activity occupies a 
predominant place, and the residing 
place of the subject as also that of 
the verbal activity is identical in 
the active voice, while the object 
and the verbal activity have got 
the same place of residence in the 
passive voice. The other auxiliaries 
of activity such as the instrument,
location and the like, are connected 
with the verbal activity. The im­
port of the sentence 
q^ifcr, in 
short, can be expressed as
a small treatise on gram­
mar written by a scholar of gram­
mar named Kasinatha, who has also 
written a few more small works

work by Bhattoji Diksita on the 
interpretation of words and sent­
ences, based upon the learned dis-
- cussion on that subject introduced 
in the Mahabhasya, Vakyapadlya, 
Pradipa etc. and discussed fully in 
his Sabdakaustubha by the author 
himself. The work although scholar­
ly and valuable, is compressed in 
only 72 verses ( karikas) and has to 
be understood with the help of the 
Vaiyakaranabhusana or Bhusana- 
sara, written by Kondabhatta, the 
nephew of the author.

an 
extremely 
popular work on the subject of 
Sanskrit grammar written for the 
use of students, which, although 
difficult at a few places, enables the 
students by its careful study to get 
a command over the subject and 
enable him to read other higher 
works on grammar. The work is, 
based on the Astadhyayi of Panini 
without omitting a single Sutra. 
The arrangement of the Sutras is 
entirely different, as the author, for 
the sake of facility in understand­
ing, has divided the work into 
different topics and explained the 
Sutras Required for the topic by 
bringing them together in the topic. 
The main topics or Prakaranas are 
twelve in 
number, viz. ( 1 )  g fi-

ful, no doubt, for the study of 
grammar, but no topic belonging 
to Siksa is given by Pagini which 
apparently means that these works 
do not come under the subject or 
province of Grammar. The reason 
why the Siksa topics are not given 
by Panini, is worth consideration. 
These Siksa works are not speci­
fically related to a particular Veda

name of the Pratisa­
khya 
treatise pertaining to the 
White 
Yajurveda 
which is also 
called the Vajasaneyi-Pi atiSakhya. 
This work appears to be a later one 
as compared with the other Prati­
sakhya 
works and 
bears 
much 
similarity with some of the Sutras 
of Panini. It is divided into eight 
chapters by the author and it deals 
with letters, their origin and their 
classification, the 
euphonic 
and 
other changes when the Samhita 
text is rendered into the Pada text, 
and accents. The work appears to 
be a common 
work for all the 
different 
branches of the 
White 
Yajurveda, being probably based 
on the individually different Prati­
sakhya .works of 
the 
different 
branches of the Sukla Yajurveda 
composed in ancient times. Katya- 
yara is traditionally believed to be 
the author of the work and very 
likely he was the same Katyayana 
who wrote the Varttikas on the 
Sutras of Panini.

several augments and substitutes, 
the phonetic combinations, which 
resulted inside the word or pada, 
had to explain by reason of the

a term used in connec­
tion with Panini’s first seven books 
and a quarter of the eighth, as con­
trasted with the term 
Tripadi, 
which is used for the last thtee 
quarters of the eighth book. The 
rules or operations given in the 
Tripad!, are stated to be. asiddha 
or invalid for purposes of the appli­
cation of the rules in the previous 
portion, 
viz. 
the 
Sapadasapta- 
dhyayl, and hence in the formation 
of words all the rules given in the 
first seven chapters and a quarter, 
are applied first and then a way is 
prepared for the rules of the last 
three quarters. It is a striking thing 
that the rules in the Tripadi mostly 
concern the padas or formed words, 
the province, in fact, of the Prati- 
sakhya treatises, and hence they 
should, as a matter of fact, be appli­
cable to words after their forma­
tion and evidently to accomplish 
this object, Panini has laid down 
the convention of the invalidity in

name of a voluminous grammar 
work ascribed to king Bhoja in the 
eleventh century. The grammer is 
based very 
closely 
on Panini’s 
Astadhyayi, 
consisting of 
eight 
chapters or books. Although the 
affixes, the augments and the sub- 
stiutes are much the same, the 
order of the Sutras is considerably 
changed. 
By the anxiety of the 
author to bring together, the nece- 
ssaiy portions of. the Ganapatha, 
the Unadipatha and the Paribhasas, 
which the author has included in 
his eight chapters, the book instead 
of being easy to. understand, has 
lost the element - of brevity' and 
become tedious for reading. Hence 
it is that it is not studied widely. 
It has an 
auto-commentary by 
Bhoja himself. There is a comm­
entary 
called 
HrdayaharinI 
by 
Dandanatha, Purusakara .by Krsna, 
Ratnadarpana by Ramasimhadeva 
and a work called Prakriyasindhu- 
setu mentioned by Vitthala in his 
Prasada. For details see pp. 392,

Although it is said that the actual 
text of Pacini was modified from 
time to time, still it can be said with 
certainty that it was fixed at the 
time of the Bhasyakara who has 
noted a few different readings only. 
The Sutra text approved by the 
Bhasyakara was followed by' the 
authors of the Kaiika excepting in 
a few cases. It is customary with 
learned Pandits and grammarians 
to say that the recital of the Sutras 
of Pacini was originally a conti­
nuous one in the form of a Samhita- 
text and it was later on, that it was 
split up into the different Sutras, 
which explains according to them 
the variation in the number of 
Sutras which is due to the different 
ways of splitting the Sutrapatha.

viz. five simple vowels sr, ?, 3, w,. 55,

of the long varieties of the first 
four such as sir, f, 3>, and

increased to thirteen and further to

by adding the pluta 
forms, there being no long variety 
for 55 and short one for the dipht­

means accent, a

vowels and not by consonants/as 
they are 
entirely 
dependent on 
vowels and can at the most be 
said to possess the same accent 
as the vowel with which they are 
uttered 
together. 
The 
accents 
are mentioned to be three; the 
acute 
(a^lTl), the 
grave arg^re 
and the circumflex ( ^ % )  defined 
respectively as
and guTfTC: 
by Panini ( P. I.
2.29, 30, 31). The point whether 
fWTfPC 
means" a combination 
or 
coming together one after another 
of the two, or a commixture or 
blending of the two is critically 
discussed in the Mahabhasya. ( vide 
M. Bh. 
on P. I. 
2.31). There 
are, however, two kinds of svarita 
mentioned by Panini and found 
actually in use: ( a )  the indepen­
dent 
as possessed by the word
^  ( from which possibly the word 
t^KcT was formed) and a few other 
words as also many times by the 
resultant vowel out of two vowels
• ( 
and aig^ra) combined, and 
(b ) 
the 
enclitic 
or 
secondary 
svarita by - which name, 
one or 
more grave vowels occurring after 
the udatta, in a chain, are called ; 
cf. P. VIII. 2.4 VIII. 2.6 and VIII. 
4.66 and 67. The topic of accents 
is fully discussed by the authors of 
the Pratisakhyas as also by Panini.

itself 
arose from the first viz. ' vowel

Although the rules of 
the Astadhyayi are 
not 
recited 
at present with the proper accents 
possessed by the various vowels as 
given by the Sutrakara, still, by 
convention and traditional explana­
tion, certain words 
are 
to 
be 
believed as 
possessed of certain 
accents. In the Dhatupatha, by 
oral tradition the accents of the 
several roots are known by the 
phrases m  
sw^tTT:, BWfai'-
5rai:, 
put therein 
at
different 
places. 
In the 
sutras, 
a major purpose is served by the 
circumflex accent with which such 
words, as are to continue to the 
next or next few or next many rule, 
have been marked. 
As the oral 
tradition, according to which the 
Sutras are recited at present, has 
preserved no accents, it is only the 
authoritative word, 
described as
* prutijiia ’ of the ancient gramma­
rians, which now is available for 
knowing 
the svarita.

on the 
Kasikavrtti which is held by gramm- J 
arians as the standard vrtti or gloss 
on the sutras of Panini, and studied 
especially in the schools of the sout­

another name was Sudarlana. His 
father’s name was Padmakumara.

of the 
twelfth century after Kaiyata. His 
scholarship in Grammar was very 
sound and he is believed to have

a Jain sage and scholar of 
remarkable erudition in the reli­
gious works of the Jainas as also in 
several Sastras. He. was a resident 
of Dhandhuka in Gujarat, who* like 
Sankar'acarya took H^re^gjr at a 
very early age and wrote’ a very 
large number of original books and 
commentaries, the total number of 
which may well nigh exceed fifty, 
during his long life of eighty-four 
years (1088 to 1172). He stayed
• 
at Anhilavada-Pattana in the North 
Gujarat and was patronised with 
extreme reverence by King Kumar- 
apala who, in fact, became his- devo­
ted pupil. Besides the well-known 
works on the various Sastras like 
Kavyanusasana, 
Abhidhanacint- 
amani, DeSfnamamala, YogaSastra, 
Dvyasrayakavya, TrisastiSalakapu- 
rusacarita and others which are 
well-known, he wrote a big work on 
grammar called 
by him,
but popularly known by the name
'. 
or 
The work
consists of eight books or Adhyayas, 
out of which the eighth book is 
devoted to Prakrit Grammar, and 
can be styled as a Grammar of all 
the Prakrit dialects. The Sanskrit 
Grammar of seven chapters is based 
practically upon Panini’s Astadh­
yayi, the rules or sutras referring 
to Vedic words or Vedic' affixes or 
accents being 
entirely 
omitted. 
The wording of the Sutras is much 
similar to that of Panini; at some 
places it is even identical. The 
order of the treatment of the sub­
jects in the 
is not,' 
however, similar to that obtaining 
in the Astadhyayi of Panini. He 
is • mainly indebted to Panini and 
Amoghavrtti and Jainendra Maha- 
. vrtti. It is somewhat topicwise as 
In the Katantra Vyakarana. The 
first Adhyaya and a quarter of the 
second are devoted to Samjna, 
Paribhasa 
and 
declension; 
the 
second Pada of the second Adhyaya 
is devoted to karaka, while the 
third Pada of it is devoted to 
cerebralization and the fourth to 
the Strlpratyayas. The first two 
Padas of the'third Adhyaya are 
devoted to Samasas or compound 
words, while the last two Padas of 
the third Adhyaya and the fourth 
Adhyaya are devoted to conjuga­
tion. The fifth Adhyaya is devoted 
to verbal derivatives or krdanta, 
while the sixth and the seventh 
Adhyayas are devoted to forma­
tions of nouns from nouns, or tadd­
hita words. On this Sabdarmsasana, 
which is just like Panini’s Astadh­
yayi, the eight adhyaya of Hema- 
^andra being devoted to the gra­
mmar of the Arsa languge similar 
to Vedic grammar of Panini, Hema­
candra has himself written 
two 
glosses which are named 
and

and the famous commentary 
known as the Brhannyasa. Besides 
these works viz. the 
the two Vrttis on it and the Brha­
nnyasa, he has given an appendix 
viz. the Linganusasana. The Gra- 
. mmar of Hemacandra, in short, 
introduced a new system of gra­
mmar different from, yet similar to, 
that of Panini, which by his fol­
lowers was made completely simi­
lar to the Paninlya system by 
writing works similar to the Sid- 
dhantakamudi, the Dhatuvrtti, the 
Manorama and the Paribhasendu­
sekhara. He has drawn very freely 
on earlier Brahmanical and Jain 
grammatical works.
