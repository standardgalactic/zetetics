Generation of laboratory nanoflares from 
multiple braided plasma loops

Solar flares are intense bursts of electromagnetic radiation accompanied 
by energetic particles and hard X-rays. They occur when magnetic flux 
loops erupt in the solar atmosphere. Solar observations detect energetic 
particles and hard X-rays but cannot reveal the generating mechanism 
because the particle acceleration happens at a scale smaller than the 
observation resolution. Thus, details of the cross-scale physics that explain 
the generation of energetic particles and hard X-rays remain a mystery. 
Here, we present observations from a laboratory experiment that simulates 
solar coronal loop physics. Transient, localized 7.6-keV X-ray bursts and 
a several-kilovolt voltage spike are observed in braided magnetic flux 
ropes of a 2-eV plasma when the braid strand radius is choked down to 
be at the kinetic scale by either magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink or 
magnetic Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. This sequence of observations 
reveals a cross-scale coupling from MHD to non-MHD physics that is likely 
responsible for generating solar energetic particles and X-ray bursts. All the 
essential components of this mechanism have been separately observed in 
the solar corona.
Energetic particles and X-ray bursts are generated by solar flares. This 
generation cannot be explained by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) 
physics and instead, is presumed to depend on non-MHD physics, hav-
ing a characteristic length scale that is smaller than can be modelled 
by MHD. Because MHD is valid only for scale lengths greatly exceeding 
the ion skin depth, which in the solar corona is about 1–10 m, it is likely 
that the scale length of the non-MHD physics that occurs when MHD 
breaks down is of this order. Existing solar observation technology 
provides considerable information about energetic particles and the 
X-ray burst generation processes1–5. However, because the best resolu-
tion of solar observations is about 105–106 m6,7 and so is much coarser 
than the ion skin depth, many fine details cannot yet be resolved. Thus, 
understanding how energetic particles and X-rays are produced is a 
critical problem. Parker8,9 proposed that energetic particles and X-ray 
bursts are created by the dissipation of tiny tangential magnetic dis-
continuities formed from convection-caused continuous and random 
motion of magnetic field photospheric foot points. He labelled the basic 
unit of impulsive energy release a ‘nanoflare’ and proposed that large 
X-ray-producing solar flares are swarms of nanoflares, each of which 
is too small to be resolved by existing observational methods. On the 
other hand, Alfvén and Carlqvist10 and Carlqvist11 proposed a related 
but somewhat different model, wherein a double layer forms in a solar 
magnetic flux tube when the electric current density becomes very 
large and exceeds some threshold. The electric field associated with 
the double layer would accelerate particles to high energy.
We report here laboratory observations from a new configuration 
of the Caltech laboratory experiment12–17 replicating solar coronal 
loops and interpret these observations in terms of a combination of 
the Parker nanoflare and the Alfvén–Carlqvist double-layer concepts. 
Specifically, transient localized 7.6-keV X-ray bursts, which we refer 
to as nanoflares, are observed to result from the instability of braided 
magnetic flux tubes containing 2-eV plasma. The phenomenological 
sequence leading to these bursts is determined by detailed observa-
tions using multiple interrelated diagnostics. These experimental 
results reveal a clear path where certain types of MHD dynamics precipi-
tate fine-scale mechanisms, beyond the scope of MHD, that generate 
solar X-ray bursts and energetic particles.
Figure 1 shows the experimental setup. Plasma-filled, 
current-carrying magnetic flux tubes (plasma loops) are created by a 
magnetized electrode structure having multiple gas nozzles that can

intercepts the detector to where the ray intercepts the plasma loop. 
Using this procedure, the location of the source of the X-ray burst was 
determined to be near where the plasma loop breaks as indicated by the 
white boxes in the 3.48- and 3.88-μs frames in Fig. 2a. The uncertainty 
in where the X-rays originate, shown by the box size, results from the 
pinhole size and the signal spread on the detector array. As shown in 
Fig. 2c,d, the X-ray burst occurs at the same time as a voltage spike 
measured across the plasma loop.
The detector array can alternatively be configured to measure 
X-ray energy; this is achieved by replacing the pinhole by multilayer 
aluminium (Al) foils placed flush against the scintillators as shown in 
Fig. 3a. Calibration for this energy-measuring mode is based on the 
X-ray intensity I through metal foil of thickness d having the depend-
ence I = I0e−d
λ, where I0 is the incident signal and λ is a material- and 
energy-dependent attenuation length. The energy dependence of the 
X-ray attenuation length for Al is shown in Fig. 3b ref. 20. When an X-ray 
burst is incident on the detector configured as in Fig. 3a, the signal is 
larger for detectors having fewer layers of Al foil. The X-ray attenuation 
length is determined by normalizing each group of signals to the con-
trol amplitude (channels with no foil) and then, performing a linear 
regression on the log of the normalized signal. This measured attenu-
ation length is then used to obtain the X-ray energy by comparing with 
the attenuation-length plot for Al in Fig. 3b. Each group of 32 channels 
was considered separately to reduce the impact of signal variation 
across the 12.8-cm width of the detector and variation in the individual 
photomultiplier tube modules. Figure 3c shows the time dependence 
of the 128-channel typical X-ray raw signal using the foil layers, and  
Fig. 3d shows the X-ray signal strength of the 128 channels with the Al 
filter location/strength overlaid as grey bars. Measurements from over 
100 shots show that the X-ray energy ranges from 6 to 10 keV, with an 
average of 7.6 keV.
The voltage spike indicates a sudden increase in the electrical 
resistance in series with the inductive circuit. This can be explained by 
two associated effects: (1) the development of a kinetic instability when 
the electron drift velocity vd = Jaxial/ne, where Jaxial is the axial current 
density, n is the electron density and e is the electron charge, associated 
with electric current exceeds a characteristic wave velocity, such as 
Alfvén velocity, and (2) a geometric stretching effect. When the electron 
drift velocity exceeds a threshold, waves are destabilized and increase 
the local effective electrical resistivity10,21. The fastest-growing ideal 
MHD instabilities are incompressible18, which means that the volume 
of the kinking loop segment must remain constant during the kink-
ing. However, when a loop segment kinks, the length l of the segment 
axis must increase as seen in Fig. 2. The constraint that the segment 
is incompressible and so, has constant volume requires lπr2 = const, 
where r is the loop radius. The cross-section πr2 of the stretched loop 
segment thus decreases as the kinking stretches l; decrease of the loop 
cross-section means that the loop axial current density Jaxial = I/πr2 
increases. The electron drift velocity Jaxial/nqe consequently increases 
and causes a kinetic instability that increases resistivity η. Furthermore 
and even without an increase in resistivity, the segment electrical 
resistance Rsegment = ηl/πr2 will increase from the geometric stretch-
ing (increase in l/r2). Thus, stretching not only can instigate a kinetic 
instability that would increase local η, but stretching also increases the 
resistance Rsegment simply from the change in aspect ratio. The sudden 
appearance of substantial resistance at the kink location has an effect 
equivalent to splicing a large resistor into the circuit at the location of 
the instability. The inductive energy of the entire circuit LI2/2 could, 
in principle, be dumped into this region of increased resistivity. The 
large voltage jump along the length of the kinking loop strand segment 
resulting from LdI/dt would accelerate electrons and ions to extreme 
energies, and the bremsstrahlung radiation of the electrons would 
produce X-rays.
An electric circuit simulation verifies the idea that the voltage spike 
associated with the X-ray burst is induced from a sudden increase of 
be open or closed to produce different plasma loop configurations. 
The plasma loops originate from the gas nozzle positions. This arrange-
ment enables the creation of multiple braided strands. The experiment 
proceeds as follows. An arched 0.01- to 0.3-T vacuum magnetic field is 
produced on a slow (millisecond) timescale by electromagnets located 
behind the electrodes. Gas is then injected into the electrode region 
by valves opened on a submillisecond timescale. High voltage (3–6 kV) 
is applied across the electrodes on a fast (microsecond) timescale, 
breaking down the gas and creating plasma. The plasma is fully ion-
ized and has density n ~ 1021 m−3 and temperature ~2–10 eV. The plasma 
duration is ~10 μs.
Figure 2a shows a sequence of high-speed photographs made by 
an Imacon 200 camera showing the evolution of a braided structure of 
multiple current-carrying plasma loops. The main capacitor bank was 
charged to 5 kV for this sequence, and the bias field coil was charged 
to 80 V. The braided structure consists of at least two strands on its 
upper part near the electrode (see the 2.68-μs image in Fig. 2a). The 
hoop force resulting from the electric current flowing along the plasma 
loop drives a localized expanding bulge of the braided loop structure; 
this bulge becomes the kink instability seen in the 2.68- and 3.08-μs 
images in Fig. 2a. A kinking loop segment must lengthen as a result of 
the deformation of its axis but because ideal MHD instabilities, such as 
a kink, are incompressible18, the volume of the segment must remain 
constant. To maintain constant volume, the radius of the segment 
must decrease; therefore, the rapid lengthening of the loop segment 
by the kink chokes the loop radius, so it becomes a thin filament and 
then, finally breaks at 3.08–3.48 μs.
When the thin filament breaks, an X-ray burst is detected by the 
128-channel X-ray detector19 array shown in Fig. 1. A pinhole is put in 
front of the X-ray detector. The location of the X-ray source is deter-
mined by tracing a ray passing through the pinhole from where the ray

Fig. 1 | Experimental setup. The electrode structure has multiple gas nozzle 
positions (holes), which can be open or closed and allow different configurations. 
This allows the creation of multiple braided strands. In this experiment, four 
holes are open on each electrode. The electrodes are mounted on the end dome 
of a 1.0-m-diameter, 1.5-m-long stainless steel vacuum chamber. Two solenoids 
are behind the electrodes to generate an arched magnetic field. The capacitor 
powering the solenoids is charged to a voltage Vb, so the bias magnetic field 
provided by the solenoids can be expressed as B = αVb, where α is a constant. 
Position within the vacuum chamber is described with a Cartesian coordinate 
system, as shown, with origin at the midpoint between electrodes, z along the 
vertical direction relative to the electrode plane and y along the line between 
the two electrode centres. Vacuum measurements of the bias field were made13 
for Vb = 50 V at x = 0 cm and z = 3.81 cm for two different values of y. These 
give B = (0, 0.02, 0.08) T at y = 5.08 cm and B = (0, 0.04, 0.03) T at y = 7.62 cm. 
Diagnostic devices include a visible-light fast framing camera, a gated linear 
spectroscopic array with a 1-μs time resolution, a 128-channel X-ray scintillator 
detector array, and a high-voltage probe (Tektronix P6015) measuring the voltage 
across the two electrodes.

resistivity. The LTspice circuit simulation software22 is used to simulate 
the experimental circuit diagram presented in Extended Data Fig. 
1a. As there are spikes from both voltage and current measurements 
shown in Extended Data Fig. 1c,d, the resistance change should also be 
a spike-like peak function. To represent the cause of these spikes, as 
shown in Extended Data Fig. 1b, a Gaussian time-dependent function 
is used to describe the sudden transient increase of resistivity. This 
assumed time-dependent resistance causes the circuit model to pro-
duce voltage and current spikes that nearly duplicate the experimen-
tally measured voltage and current spikes; this is seen by comparing 
Extended Data Fig. 1c,d, from the experiment, with Extended Data Fig. 
1e,f, from the circuit simulation.
To see why a kinetic instability should develop when a loop strand 
is choked, consider the situation when the electron drift velocity is 
near the Alfvén velocity. The loop strand has both an axial magnetic 
field Bz and a local azimuthal magnetic field Bφ, where the latter is 
associated with the current density in the strand by Ampere’s law via 
μ0Jz = r−1∂/∂r(rBφ). The ratio of electron drift velocity to the Alfvén 
velocity is23

If Bφ is of order Bz, vd will become of order vA if the length scale of r 
becomes of the order of di. The density of the hydrogen plasma loop 
is n = 1 × 1021 m−3 as measured from Stark broadening of the Hβ line; 
the ion skin depth is thus di = 0.72 cm. Before the kink instability, the 
diameter of a single strand is thus very close to di. The choking of the 
strand by the kink instability will consequently reduce the strand radius 
to be smaller than di. This enables a kinetic instability in the choked 
strand, which will increase the resistivity in the strand. This resistivity 
increase together with the increase in strand segment l/r2 increases 
the local electrical resistance.
A magnetic Rayleigh–Taylor instability (MRTI; or Kruskal–Schwar-
zschild instability24) can also occur in the plasma loop as shown in 
Extended Data Fig. 2, and the MRTI works similarly to the kink instability 
to choke the plasma strand radius down to the kinetic scale.
We define a single X-ray burst as a laboratory nanoflare and some-
times, observe multiple nanoflares. Figure 4a shows an experiment 
shot where the plasma loop is composed of two separate strands. Two 
separate X-ray bursts are detected in Fig. 4b, and two ~3-kV spikes were 
measured as shown in Fig. 4c. These bursts and associated voltage 
spikes are presumed to be generated as each of the two strands went 
unstable and broke via the mechanism described above. Three labora-
tory nanoflares in one shot have also been observed.

Fig. 2 | Time series images of experimental plasma loop evolution and X-ray 
and voltage measurements. a, A two-strand braided structure is observed in 
time series images of hydrogen plasma loop evolution. With the expansion of 
the plasma loop, a kink instability occurs near the top of the loop. It chokes the 
strand radius down and breaks the strand at later time. A local hard X-ray burst 
is observed from the boxed regions in frames 7 and 8. The uncertainty in the 
origin of the X-rays is due to the size of the pinhole and the spread of the signal 
on the camera. The image is false coloured. The full evolution video can be

These experimental results suggest a multiscale instability 
sequence wherein solar loops initially governed by ideal MHD dynam-
ics kink, which then chokes the current channel, and trigger kinetic 
instability, which then instigates opening switch-like processes that 
cause solar X-ray bursts.
The MHD behaviour reported here can be scaled to the many other 
situations governed by MHD because MHD has no intrinsic length scale.

Typical values of the experiment (left column) are scaled according to the MHD scaling described in the text. The scaled values (centre column) are in good agreement with approximate values 
for the solar corona (right column). This close correspondence indicates MHD similarity between the two systems and the relevance of the experimental parameter regime to that of the solar 
corona. The experiment plasma has a density of 1021 m−3 and a temperature of 5 eV. The solar corona has a density of 1017 m−3 and a temperature of 200 eV28.

scaled to equivalent systems in space plasmas. Table 1 shows charac-
teristic parameters of the experiment; the solar corona and the experi-
ment are scaled to the solar corona using a1 = 10−8, a2 = 1 × 105 and 
a3 = 9 × 102. The scaled characteristic parameters have magnitudes 
similar to that of the solar corona.
A critical distinction between the laboratory and solar situations 
is that the initial state of the laboratory experiment is much closer to 
kinetic instability than at first consideration would apparently be the 
case for the solar situation. The initial current channel radius in the 
experiment is around di so that the kink instability does not have to 
choke the current channel cross-section very much. In contrast, the 
nominal radius of a solar coronal loop is of order of 106 m, whereas the 
ion skin depth for nominal solar corona densities is of order of 1–10 m. 
The length of the solar loop would have to increase by an unrealisti-
cally large amount to choke the 106-m radius to be of the order of 10 m. 
The solar situation could nevertheless develop a kinetic instability on 
realizing that a solar coronal flux rope is not monolithic but instead, is 
a fractal braid of successively smaller braided filamentary flux ropes: 
that is, strands. The finest strand would be close to ion skin depth: 
that is, ~10–100 m. Because of this fractal braiding, an MHD instability 
only has to choke an individual finest MHD-governed strand by a small 
factor to instigate kinetic instability.
A finest-scale structure of 10 m is consistent with the required mag-
netic field diffusion time. Solar loops are stable for timescales of hours 
and have an internal axial current providing the J × B inward force that 
balances outward forces from the pressure gradient in the direction of 
the loop radius. The time for this current to become distributed over 
the loop cross-section is the magnetic field diffusion time τr = μ0r2/η, 
where r is the radius and η is the resistivity. The temperature of a solar 
corona loop is T = 200 eV, so Spitzer resistivity gives η = 7 × 10−7Ω  m. 
Thus, a 3,600-s diffusion time corresponds to a 45-m radius. If the solar 
corona loop was a monolithic structure (like a solid copper wire) hav-
ing a 106-m radius rather than being constituted by fractal strands, the 
magnetic field diffusion time would be 6 × 104 years, which is orders of 
magnitude greater than observed characteristic solar magnetic field 
evolution timescales. This implies that a fractal structure is necessary 
for a solar corona loop to have a distributed current. Filamentary 
decomposition of a flux rope is analogous to Litz wire26, which is com-
posed of braided tiny insulated wire strands. This structure can enhance 
current penetration compared with a single monolithic conductor, and 
so, it links more interior flux and increases the inductance27.
The essential components of this mechanism have been separately 
observed in nature. Solar observations imply that coronal loops are 
composed of braided flux ropes because as imaging resolution has 
increased over the years, each improvement in resolution has revealed 
finer-scale structures28. Braided loop structures have commonly been 
observed on the Sun: for example, by the high-resolution Corona Imager1. 
Fast-growing ideal MHD instabilities, such as the kink instability and the 
MRTI, are common in solar loop structures29,30. Previous study has shown 
that a large current flows through the solar loop, and the current disrup-
tion from LdI/dt can generate voltage spikes up to 106 kV10. Fleishman 
et al.3,5 measured the rapid magnetic field decay in a solar flare region, 
which implies a strong inductive electric field with associated voltage 
spike V = −dϕ/dt = −LdI/dt, where the magnetic flux is ϕ = ∫B ⋅ dS = LI and 
I is the electric current. Nanoflares have also been observed2,4.
A specific highly relevant example is the kink-driven solar flare 
observed in active region NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration) 11163 on 24 February 201131, which had an evolution 
very similar to what was observed in the Caltech laboratory experi-
ment. Compared with the Caltech experiment, it has a bigger length 
scale (20 Mm) but a slower timescale (10 s). The MHD behaviour of 
both situations can be scaled and compared using Table 1. Figure 5a–c 
presents high-resolution observations of this kink-driven solar flare 
as observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory–Atmospheric Imag-
ing Assembly6, while Fig. 5d–f shows the comparable situation in the 
Caltech laboratory experiment. In both the active region and the labo-
ratory experiment, a kink instability developed on a loop segment; in 
both cases, the axial stretching produced by the kink chokes the radius 
of the segment, and then, the choked segment breaks. Figure 5g shows 
the hard X-ray signal from Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spec-
troscopic Imager (RHESSI)32 for the solar kink-driven instability, and  
Fig. 5h shows the X-ray signal from the laboratory experiment.
It is thus reasonable to propose the following path for how solar 
eruptions create energetic particles and X-rays. (1) A solar flux rope is 
conjectured to be a braid of a very large number of fine-scale flux ropes, 
with the finest-scale being somewhat larger than di. (2) Electric current 
flows along the flux rope, and the corresponding hoop force causes a 
segment or segments of the flux rope to bow out. (3) Each strand then 
develops a fast-growing MHD instability, such as the kink instability or 
MRTI, which then chokes the strand down to a critical scale, at which 
time kinetic instabilities develop and together with the stretching of the 
length of the unstable strand, increase the resistance of the choked seg-
ment. (4) This increase in resistance corresponds to an opening switch, 
so the inductive energy of the entire circuit would be dumped into this 
region of increased resistance. (5) A high voltage drop resulting from 
LdI/dt would accelerate electrons and ions to extreme energies, and 
the bremsstrahlung radiation of the electrons would produce X-rays.
The particle acceleration mechanism proposed here is also likely 
relevant to space and astrophysics regimes. A similar voltage spike 
double-layer structure has been observed in Earth’s plasma sheet and 
identified as a cause for particle accelerations33.
Methods
Plasma loop generation
A diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in Fig. 1. Magnetic 
flux tubes (plasma loops) were formed in the following sequence. 
First, an arched 0.01- to 0.3-T vacuum magnetic field linking the two 
electrodes was produced on a slow (millisecond) timescale by elec-
tromagnets located behind the electrodes. Next, hydrogen gas was 
injected through four nozzles at each electrode by valves opened on 
a submillisecond timescale. Finally, high voltage (3–6 kV) was applied 
across the electrodes on a fast (microsecond) timescale, breaking 
down the gas and creating the plasma loop. These steps and the asso-
ciated equipment are described in more detail in a series of previous 
publications12–17.
X-ray diagnostics
The 128-channel X-ray detector shown in Fig. 1 was composed of a linear 
array of 128 cerium-doped lutetium yttrium orthosilicate (LYSO(CE)) 
scintillators (OST Photonics), which were fibre coupled to a photomul-
tiplier tube array (4× Hamamatsu H7260-100). The photomultiplier 
tube signals were digitized by a 128-channel, 125-MHz digitizer (CAEN 
R5560). The X-rays were viewed through a custom 254-μm-thick poly-
imide window. Visible light was prevented from entering the detector 
by an 18-μm-thick Al foil. Further details about this diagnostic and 
the X-ray transparent window are described elsewhere19. For pinhole 
imaging, the 0.7- × 51-mm rectangular pinhole was laser cut into a 
0.76-mm-thick stainless steel sheet and mounted 16 cm from the 
detector surface. The pinhole mask was 69 cm from the centre of the 
electrodes.

Extended Data Fig. 1 | Solar loop experiment circuit simulation.  
(a) Experiment circuit diagram. The plasma part of the circuit is represented as an 
inductor and a time-dependent resistor. The plasma inductance is assumed to be 
50 nH, which is obtained by simplifying the plasma loop as a half circle loop of 
wire with 5 cm loop major radius and 1 cm minor (wire) radius. The voltage and 
current spikes are both peak functions, so the corresponding resistance change 
is presumed to be also a peak function. We use Gaussian function 
Rplasma = R0 exp(−a(t −t0)
2) to represent the transient change of the plasma 
resistance where R0 is the peak resistance value, and t0 is the resistance peak time, 
and a is related to the full width at half maximum (FWHM). They are chosen 
according to the relative voltage spike amplitude, voltage peak time and the 
voltage spike FWHM. In the simulation, R0 = 0.4Ω, t0 = 3.65 μs and a = 5 μs −2 are 
used. The corresponding plasma resistance is plotted in (b). (c, d) Voltage and 
current measurement from experiment Shot # 9258. As shown in (a), the voltage 
measured in (c) is the voltage across the plasma part and an extra inductor. We 
also measured the voltage across the plasma part by connecting two voltage 
probes directly to the top electrode and bottom electrode and then subtracting 
the two voltages. The voltage trace across the plasma is similar but has a several 
kV larger voltage spike compared with (c). (e, f) Voltage and current curves from 
the simulation. Voltage and current spikes similar to the experimentally observed 
spikes are reproduced by the transient resistance increase.

Extended Data Fig. 2 | Magnetic Rayleigh Taylor instability observation.  
A four-strand braided structure is shown in time series images of hydrogen 
plasma loop evolution. With the expansion of the plasma loop, a magnetic 
Rayleigh Taylor instability occurs on the loop and plays the same role as a kink 
instability to choke the strand radius down and break the strand at later time. The 
full evolution video can be found in Supplementary Movie 2.
