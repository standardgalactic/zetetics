Preface 
WHY GRAPH COLORING? 
Graph coloring problems? The four-color problem has been changed into the four-
color theorem, so is there really much more to say or do about coloring? Yes there is, 
and for several reasons! 
First, the last word on the four-color problem has not been said. The ingenious 
solution by K. Appel, W. Haken, and J. Koch [1, 2], based on the approach of 
H. Heesch, is a major achievement, but to some mathematicians the solution is 
unsatisfactory and raises new questions, both mathematical and philosophical. 
Second, graph coloring theory has a central position in discrete mathematics. 
It appears in many places with seemingly no or little connection to coloring. A 
good example is the Erdös-Stone-Simonovits theorem [3] in extremal graph theory, 
showing that for a fixed graph G the behavior of the maximum number f(n, G) 
of edges in a graph on n vertices not containing G as a subgraph depends on the 
chromatic number x(G) of G: 
/(n,G) = 
X(G) - 2 
«-<* 
„2 
2 * ( G ) - 2 ' 
Third, graph coloring theory is of interest for its applications. Graph coloring 
deals with the fundamental problem of partitioning a set of objects into classes, 
according to certain rules. Time tabling, sequencing, and scheduling problems, in 
their many forms, are basically of this nature. 
Fourth, graph coloring theory continually surprises by producing unexpected 
new answers. For example, the century old five-color theorem for planar graphs due 
to P.J. Heawood [4] has recently been furnished with a new proof by C. Thomassen 
[5], avoiding both the use of Euler's formula and the powerful recoloring technique 
invented by A.B. Kempe [6], thus making it conceptually simpler than any previous 
proof. 
And finally, even if many deep and interesting results have been obtained during 
the 100 years of graph coloring, there are very many easily formulated, interesting 
problems left. This is the most important reason for us, and our book is an attempt 
xv 

XVI 
Preface 
to exemplify it. As far as we know it is the first book devoted to unsolved graph 
coloring problems, but a number of papers sharing the same topic have preceded 
it—for example, many of the "problems and results" papers by P. Erdös (referred to 
throughout the book), surveys by W. Klotz [7], Z. Tuza [8], and J. Kahn [9], problem 
sections in proceedings and newsletters (such as the column by D.B. West [10]), 
and lists of "problems from the world surrounding perfect graphs" by A. Gyärfäs 
[11] and V. Chvätal [12]. A list of 50 carefully selected problems in graph theory is 
contained in the book by J.A. Bondy and U.S.R. Murty [13]. Finally, two interesting 
collections of geometry problems, by H.T. Croft, K.J. Falconer, and R.K. Guy [14], 
and by W. Moser (McGill University, Canada) and J. Pach [15], share some of our 
general ideas and contain some coloring problems. 
In a delightful paper W.T. Tutte [16] described several difficult coloring con-
jectures, many of them generalizing the four-color theorem. The paper showed, in 
Tutte's words, that "The Four Colour Theorem is the tip of the iceberg, the thin end 
of the wedge and the first cuckoo of spring." 
THE PROBLEMS 
In selecting and presenting the more than 200 problems for this book we had four 
main objectives in mind: 
1. Each problem should be simple to state and understand, and thus problems 
requiring several or complicated definitions are not included. Only a few of 
the problems have the character of a broad research program; most of them 
are specific questions. We have aimed to select for each problem its most 
attractive formulation, which may not always be the most general or the most 
specific. But very often we mention more general versions and/or special 
cases in the comments. 
2. The list of problems should tell not only what is not known in graph coloring 
theory. The comments should also provide an exposition of the major known 
graph coloring results. 
3. The history of the problems, and the credit for them and for the results 
presented, should be as accurate and complete as possible. 
4. The list should not consist just of "impossible" problems, but also of questions 
where progress is definitely possible. 
We did not intend to write a textbook to be read from beginning to end, but 
rather a catalog suitable for browsing. Chapter 1 contains a common basis of graph 
coloring terminology and a collection of important theorems. The remaining 16 
chapters comprise the main body of the book, each containing a list of open problems 
within a separate area. The necessary background for understanding each problem 
and the information directly related to it appear together with the statement of the 
problem. Each chapter is intended to be self-contained and is closed by its own 
separate list of references. We have paid a price in terms of having to allow some 

Preface 
χνιι 
redundancies, but we think that the level is tolerable even for the thorough reader. 
To make the presentation short and succinct, we have included very few proofs and 
pictures. Proofs, outlines of arguments, or figures have been added in a few cases 
when we did not have an appropriate source of reference. 
There is one remark we should make concerning the organization of the refer-
ences. When consulting any given one of the bibliographies it may seem strange that 
different papers by the same author(s) and published within the same year are not 
always listed in a consecutively numbered fashion. For example, there is a reference 
to a paper of Edmonds [1965b] in Chapter 2, but there is no reference to a paper of 
Edmonds [1965a] preceding it in the bibliography. The explanation is that we have 
chosen to maintain a consistent numbering of the references throughout the entire 
book. In other words, the numbering is exactly as it would have been, had the refer-
ences all been put together into one big list. Thus the same paper is being referred to 
in the same manner throughout. 
UPDATES 
The present activity in discrete mathematics is so extensive that a work of this nature 
is outdated before it is written! Solutions, partial results, and new ideas appear all 
the time. And there will be interesting questions that we have overlooked, and also, 
solutions or partial solutions. In some cases we have probably not met objective 3. 
We apologize for all such cases, and we shall be grateful for corrections, comments, 
and information. 
For easy access to any new and updated information, we have installed an ftp-
archive at Odense University, Denmark. You can reach this facility via f t p using the

The senior author, Bjarne Toft, learned graph theory from G.A. Dirac, starting in 
1966, at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. Dirac's lectures were captivating. He 
presented the subject as a general and serious mathematical theory, and he did so 
with rigor and care, to an extent which made some of his colleagues think that graph 
theory is just a collection of easy facts with trivial proofs. Dirac's thorough style, 
strongly influenced by the book of Denes König [17], was, however, a delight for 
his students. Later, in 1968-1970 and in 1973, Toft spent semesters at the Hungarian 
Academy of Sciences in Budapest, Hungary, the University of London, England, and 
the University of Waterloo, Canada. Later, in 1985-1986, while visiting the University 
of Regina, Canada, and Vanderbilt University, United States, the first steps toward 
this book were taken. 
Tommy Jensen first learned graph theory at Odense University, Denmark, in the 
first half of the 1980s under the supervision of Bjarne Toft, and later, while studying 
at the University of Waterloo, Canada, enjoyed the benefit of receiving supervision 
from D.H. Younger. He owes the beginning of his interest in mathematics to his 
father, Emil Jensen, who sadly did not get to see the finished version of this book. 
We are glad for the opportunities given to us to learn from some of the greatest 
mathematicians in graph theory, such as P. Erdös, to whom we dedicate this book, 
and J. Edmonds, T. Gallai, and W.T. Tutte. We are most grateful for the helpfulness 
and generosity we have met from many sides. In connection with the present work 
we would like to thank a very large number of people who supplied information— 
their names may be found in appropriate places in this book. In particular, we wish 
to thank the following for showing their interest in the project by giving us highly 
qualified comments and suggestions at various stages: M.O. Albertson, N. Alon,

Of course we alone are responsible for all errors, inaccuracies, and omissions. 
Finally, we would like to express our appreciation of the support received from 
Wiley-Interscience and their editorial staff, in particular Maria Allegra, Elizabeth

Graph Coloring Problems

Introduction to Graph Coloring 
1.1. BASIC DEFINITIONS 
Partitioning a set of objects into classes according to certain rules is a fundamental 
process in mathematics. A conceptually simple set of rules tells us for each pair of 
objects whether or not they are allowed in the same class. The theory of graph coloring 
deals with exactly this situation. The objects form the set of vertices V(G) of a graph 
G, two vertices being joined by an edge in G whenever they are not allowed in the 
same class. To distinguish the classes we use a set of colors C, and the division into 
classes is given by a coloring φ : V(G) —► C, where φ{χ) Φ φ(ν) for all xy belonging 
to the set of edges E(G) of G. If C has cardinality k, then φ is a k-coloring, and 
when k is finite, we usually assume that C = {1,2,3,..., k). For i E C the set φ~'(/) 
is the ith color class. Thus each color class forms an independent set of vertices; 
that is, no two of them are joined by an edge. The minimum cardinal k for which 
G has a ^-coloring is the chromatic number x(G) of G, and G is \(G)-chromatic. 
The existence of the chromatic number follows from the Well-Ordering Theorem of 
set theory, and conversely, considering cardinals as special ordinals, the existence 
of the chromatic number easily implies the Well-Ordering Theorem. However, even 
if it is not assumed that every set has a well-ordering, but maintaining the property 
that every set has a cardinality, then the statement "Any finite or infinite graph has a 
chromatic number" is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice, as proved by Galvin and 
Komjäth [1991]. 
If the condition ψ(χ) Φ φ(ν) for all xy (= E(G) is dropped from the definition of 
coloring, then ψ is called an improper coloring of G. Accordingly, the term proper 
coloring is sometimes used when we want to emphasize that this condition holds. 
For a hypergraph H with vertex set V{H) and edge set £(//), a coloring ψ : 
V(H) —► C must assign at least two different colors to the vertices of every edge in 
H. That is, no edge is monochromatic. If the edges of// all have the same size r, we 
say that H is r-uniform. Thus the 2-uniform hypergraphs are exactly the graphs. We 
do not normally allow loops in graphs, nor edges of size at most 1 in hypergraphs; 
when we do, it will be stated explicitly. We do allow multiple edges. A graph or 
hypergraph without multiple edges is simple. The term multigraph is used when we 
explicitly want to say that multiple edges are allowed in a graph, and the multiplicity

Introduction to Graph Coloring 
μ(ΰ) will denote the maximum number of edges joining the same pair of vertices in 
a multigraph G. 
The theory of hypergraph coloring is extremely rich, and graph coloring is just 
one special case. Ramsey theory can be viewed naturally as another special case (see 
Graham, Rothschild, and Spencer [1990]). 
A homomorphism of a graph G into a graph H is a mapping / : V(G) —* V{H) 
such that f(x)f(y) is an edge of H if xy is an edge of G. A /t-coloring of G can then 
be thought of as a homomorphism of G into the complete Ar-graph Kk. In general, a 
homomorphism of G into a graph H is called an H-coloring of G. 
An edge coloring of a hypergraph (or graph) H is a mapping φ': £(//) —» C, 
where nondisjoint edges are mapped into distinct elements of the color set C. If C 
has k elements, then φ' is a k-edge coloring. The minimum cardinal £ for which 
H has a k-edge coloring is the edge-chromatic number χ'(Η), and H is said to be 
x'(Hy edge-chromatic. 
A. face coloring of a map Mona surface S (i.e., a bridge-less graph embedded 
on S) with a set F(Af) of faces (or countries) consists of a mapping φ : F(M) —♦ C, 
where neighboring faces (those with a common borderline) are mapped into different 
elements of the color set C. This corresponds to a vertex coloring of the dual graph 
G, defined by having vertex set V(G) = F(M) and an edge xy £ E(G) for every edge 
of M on the common borderline of the faces x and y. When the map M is embedded 
on S, its dual graph can also be embedded on S without crossing edges. 
As with face coloring, both hypergraph coloring (with at least three colors) and 
edge coloring can be translated into vertex-coloring of graphs, as we shall see. 
In the following we deal almost exclusively with graphs rather than with maps, 
even in cases where the results were initially obtained for face coloring. In the time 
before the papers of Whitney [1932b] and Brooks [1941], coloring theory dealt 
almost exclusively with maps, even though Kempe [1879] had drawn attention to 
vertex colorings of graphs: "If we lay a sheet of tracing paper over a map and mark a 
point on it over each district and connect the points corresponding to districts which 
have a common boundary, we have on the tracing paper a diagram of a 'linkage! 
and we have as the exact analogue of the question we have been considering, that of 
lettering the points of the linkage with as few letters as possible, so that no two directly 
connected points shall be lettered with the same letter. Following this up, we may 
ask what are the linkages which can be similarly lettered with no less than n letters? 
The classification of linkages according to the value of n is one of considerable 
importance!' 
Vertex coloring of infinite graphs with a finite number of colors, or more generally 
//-coloring with a finite graph //, can always be reduced to finite instances. For vertex 
coloring, this is the content of the following theorem, which may be derived from 
a theorem of Rado [1949]. Gottschalk [1951] gave a short proof of Rado's theorem 
using compactness. A similar proof gives an extension of the theorem that includes 
//-coloring in general. 
Theorem 1 (de Bruijn and Erdös [1951]). If all finite subgraphs of an infinite 
graph G are k-colorable, where k is finite, then G is k-colorable. 

Graphs on Surfaces 
3 
A short direct graph-theoretic proof of Theorem 1 was obtained by L. Posa, 
and may be found for example in the book by Wagner [1970]. It was actually 
already contained in the Ph.D. thesis of G.A. Dirac at the University of London in 
1951. However, as pointed out by G. Sabidussi [personal communication in 1993], 
this particular proof does not generalize to //-colorings as readily as the proof of 
Gottschalk. Because of Theorem 1 we shall only deal with finite graphs in the 
following, except when explicitly stating otherwise. 
The reader looking for proofs of the theorems in this chapter may in many cases 
have to consult the references. However, a well-written general exposition of graph 
coloring theory, including proofs of several of the theorems we mention, can be found 
in the classical book on extremal graph theory by Bollobäs [1978a]. Another good 
general source is the forthcoming Handbook of Combinatorics, edited by L. Loväsz, 
R.L. Graham, and M. Grötschel, and published by North-Holland. 
1.2. GRAPHS ON SURFACES 
Many other areas of graph theory besides coloring theory originated from The four-
color problem of Francis Guthrie: Is every planar graph 4-colorable? Well-written 
accounts of the problem are contained in the monographs by Ringel [1959], Ore 
[1967], Biggs, Lloyd, and Wilson [1976], Saaty and Kainen [1977], Barnette [1983], 
and Aigner [1984]. 
The four-color problem seems first to have been mentioned in writing in an 
1852 letter from A. De Morgan to W.R. Hamilton, written on the same day as 
De Morgan first heard about the problem from his student Frederick Guthrie, Fran-
cis Guthrie's brother. It first appeared in print in an anonymous book review by 
De Morgan in 1860 (see Wilson [1976]), and later as an open problem raised by Cay-
ley [ 1878] at a meeting in the London Mathematical Society and in a paper by Cayley 
[1879]. A proposed solution by Kempe [1879] stood for more than a decade until 
it was refuted by Heawood [1890] in his first paper. Heawood proved the five-color 
theorem for planar maps and the best possible twelve-color theorem for the case 
where each country consists of at most two connected parts. Moreover, he extended 
the problem to higher surfaces. Dirac [1963] gave an excellent survey of Heawood's 
achievements. 
The higher surfaces (i.e., compact 2-dimensional manifolds) can be classified 
into three types as follows (see, e.g., Massey [1991]). The sphere with g handles 
attached is denoted by Sg (of Euler characteristic ε = 2 — 2g), the projective plane 
with g handles attached by Ps (of Euler characteristic ε = 1 - 2g), and the Klein 
bottle with g handles attached by Kg (of Euler characteristic ε = — 2g). In each case 
g may assume the value zero. Note that the surfaces Sg are orientable, whereas Pg 
and Kg are nonorientable. 
Theorem 2 (Heawood [1890]). Let Sbea surface of Euler characteristic ε. When 
ε < 2, every graph GonS can be colored using the Heawood number Η(ε) of colors,

Introduction to Graph Coloring 
given by 
A graph of seven mutually adjacent vertices, the complete 7-graph Κη, embeds on 
the torus Si, hence 7 (— H(0)) colors are both sufficient and necessary for toroidal 
graphs. 
The topological prerequisite for Heawood's formula is Euler's formula, implying 
that every graph G embedded on a surface S of Euler characteristic ε has at most 
3|K(G)| - 3ε edges. Since a minimal ^-chromatic graph G has minimum degree 
8(G) > k - \, such a graph G satisfies 
(k - \)\V(G)\ < 2|£(G)| < 6|V(G)| - 6ε. 
Since \V(G)\ ^ k, it follows for k > 7 that (k — l)k + 6ε ^ 0, which in turn implies 
that k < Η(ε). 
For the Klein bottle K0 the Heawood formula gives a seven-color theorem. 
However, Franklin [1934] proved that six colors suffice to color any graph on the 
Klein bottle. This is the only case where the Heawood number is not the right answer 
to the coloring problem for higher surfaces. 
Theorem 3 (Heffter [1891], Tietze [1910], Ringel [1954,1959,1974], Ringel and 
Youngs [1968]). For a surface S of Euler characteristic ε < 2, where S is not the 
Klein bottle, the Heawood number Η(ε) is the maximum chromatic number of graphs 
embeddable on S. 
The proof of this major result, completed in 1968, was obtained by embedding 
the complete //(e)-graph KH(e) on the surface with Euler characteristic ε. This is of 
course sufficient for a proof of Theorem 3. It is in fact also necessary. 
Theorem 4 (P. Ungar and Dirac [1952b], Albertson and Hutchinson [1979]). 
For a surface S of Euler characteristic ε < 2, and S different from the Klein bottle, 
any H^)-chromatic graph on S contains KH(B) α$ a subgraph. 
Dirac's arithmetic did not cover the cases e = — 1 and 1, but these cases were 
later settled by Albertson and Hutchinson [1979]. The idea of the result of Theorem 4 
and a proof in the case of the torus were first obtained by P. Ungar, as mentioned by 
Dirac [1952b]. 
After various attempts and the achieving of partial results on the four-color 
problem by many mathematicians, Appel and Haken [1976a] announced a complete 
proof. The four-color theorem for plane triangulations (i.e., plane graphs in which all 
faces are triangles), and hence for all planar graphs, follows immediately by induction 
from 

Graphs on Surfaces 
5 
Theorem 5 (Appel and Haken [1977a], Appel, Haken and Koch [1977]). There 
exists a set U of 1482 configurations such that 
(a) Unavoidability: any plane triangulation contains an element ofU, and 
(b) Reducibility: a 4-coloring of a plane triangulation containing an element of 
U can be obtained from 4-colorings of smaller plane triangulations . 
This is the same basic idea as in Kempe's proof, where U consisted of vertices 
of degree at most 5. Kempe's only mistake was in his argument for the reducibility of 
vertices of degree equal to 5. The detailed techniques of Appel, Haken, and Koch are 
further developments of methods of Heesch [1969], who was the first to emphasize 
strongly the possibility of a proof of the four-color theorem along these lines (see 
Bigalke [1988]). The proof of part (a) is based on Euler's formula and an elaborate 
"discharging procedure." Whereas this part of the proof can in principle be carried 
out by hand, Appel, Haken, and Koch had to use computer programs to verify that 
each member of their unavoidable set U of configurations submits to one of two 
types of reducibility that Heesch had named "C-reducibility" and "D-reducibility." 
Combining this fact with results of Bernhart [1947], they proved that U satisfies (b) 
of Theorem 5. 
Several surveys of the proof of Theorem 5 exist: for example, Appel and Haken 
[1977b, 1978] and Woodall and Wilson [1978]. Due to its length, extensive use of 
verification by computer, some inaccuracies, and omissions of details, the proof of 
Theorem 5 has been surrounded by some controversy. Appel and Haken [1986,1989] 
have themselves addressed the questions raised. Recent accounts of the situation have 
been given by F. Bernhart [Math. Reviews 91m:05005] in an informative review of 
the book by Appel and Haken [1989], and by Kainen [1993]. 
Very recently, N. Robertson, D.P. Sanders, RD. Seymour, and R. Thomas [per-
sonal communication from N. Robertson and RD. Seymour in 1994] have obtained 
a new, improved proof of the four-color theorem by using the same general approach 
as that of Appel, Haken, and Koch. This proof has less than 700 configurations and 
is based on a simpler discharging procedure. In addition, the proof avoids some of 
the more problematic details of the proof by Appel, Haken, and Koch (we describe 
these in Problem 2.1). However, it still relies on extensive computer checking. 
An early approach to coloring problems for plane maps and graphs concerned 
studying the number P(G,k) of all possible different ^-colorings of a graph G 
with colors 1,2,... ,k. Birkhoff [1912] noted that P{G,k) as a function of k can 
be expressed as a polynomial, the so-called chromatic polynomial of G, P{G, k) = 
a\kn + atkn~x + ■ ■ ■ + a„k of degree n = |V(G)|. In particular, χ{β) is the smallest 
nonnegative integer that is not a zero of P(G, k). Whitney [1932a, 1932b], Birkhoff 
and Lewis [1946], Tutte [1954,1970b], and Read [1968] are some of the researchers 
who have developed the theory of chromatic polynomials. A well-written survey was 
given by Read and Tutte [1988]. 
One of Tutte's surprising and beautiful results is the following golden identity. 

6 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
Theorem 6 (Tutte [1970b]). Let M be a plane triangulation on n vertices. Then 
P(M, T + 2) = (T + 2) · T3"-m · (P(M, T + l))2, 
where τ is the golden ratio |(1 + V5), with τ + 1 = τ2 and τ + 2 = ,/5τ. 
Tutte [1970b] noted that P(M,r + 1) Φ 0. Hence we have the curious con-
sequence that P(M, T + 2) is positive, where τ + 2 = 3.618 
Of course, the 
four-color theorem is equivalent to the statement that P(M, 4) is positive. 
As explained by Saaty [1972] and Saaty and Kainen [1977] the four-color theo-
rem has many equivalent formulations. A particularly noteworthy result is 
Theorem 7 (Wagner [1937]). If all planar graphs are 4-colorable, then 4-color-
ability extends to the class Q of all graphs from which a complete 5-graph K$ cannot be 
obtained by deletions (of vertices and/or edges) and contractions of edges (removing 
possible loops that might arise). 
Thus the four-color theorem is equivalent to the case k = 5 of the famous 
Hadwiger's Conjecture (Hadwiger [1943]). Let Qbea class of graphs closed un-
der deletions (of edges and/or vertices) and contractions of edges (removing possible 
loops that might arise). Then the maximum chromatic number of the graphs in Q 
equals the number of vertices (k — I) in a largest complete graph in Q. 
For k = 4 this was proved by Dirac [1952a]. Recently, Robertson, Seymour, 
and Thomas [1993a] gave a complete characterization of all 6-colorable graphs from 
which the complete graph K6 cannot be obtained by deletions and contractions. As 
a corollary of the characterization, all such graphs are in fact 5-colorable, assuming 
the four-color theorem. This proves that Hadwiger's conjecture for k = 6 is also 
equivalent to the four-color theorem. Hadwiger's conjecture is true for Q the class of 
all graphs embeddable on the same surface S. This follows from Theorems 3,4, and 5 
above, and from a paper by Albertson and Hutchinson [1980a] for the Klein bottle. 
A deep extension of the five-color theorem for planar graphs was conjectured by 
Grünbaum [1973] and proved by Borodin [1979a]. The proof is reminiscent of the 
four-color proof by Appel, Haken, and Koch; it involves an unavoidable set of some 
450 reducible configurations (but no computers). 
Theorem 8 (Borodin [1979a]). Every planar graph has an acyclic 5-coloring, that 
is, a 5-coloring in which each pair of color classes induces a subgraph without cycles. 
As for 3-colorings of planar graphs, the most important results are 
Theorem 9 (Heawood [1898]). A plane triangulation can be 3-colored if and only 
if all vertices have even degrees. 

Vertex Degrees and Colorings 
7 
Theorem 10 (Grötzsch [1959]). Every planar graph G without triangles is 3-
colorable. Moreover, any proper 3-coloring of a 4-cycle or a 5-cycle can be extended 
to a 3-coloring of all ofG. 
Recently, Thomassen [1993c] gave a short proof of Grötzsch's theorem and 
proved that every graph on the torus without cycles of length three or four is 3-
colorable. The induction proofs given by Grötzsch and Thomassen both depend on 
coloring extension arguments—prescribed colorings of special subgraphs, such as 
4-cycles and 5-cycles in the case of Theorem 10, may be assumed extendable to all 
of G. Another new proof of the first, essential, part of Theorem 10, free of coloring 
extension arguments, was obtained by Borodin [1993a, 1994a]. 
Grünbaum [1963] made the assertion that if G is a planar graph with at most 
three triangles, then G is 3-colorable. To prove this extension of Grötzsch's theorem, 
Grünbaum extended the statement a bit further to make the induction run. However, a 
counterexample to Griinbaum's extended theorem was found by T. Gallai. The basic 
claim of Grünbaum (that if a planar graph G has at most three triangles, then G is 
3-colorable) is true, as proved by Aksionov [1974], with a proof based on the ideas 
introduced by Grünbaum and Grötzsch. 
An informative survey of 3-colorability in general was given by Steinberg 
[1993a], recently updated by Steinberg [1993b]. 
1.3. VERTEX DEGREES AND COLORINGS 
Brooks [1941] observed that every graph G may be colored by A(G) + 1 colors, 
where A(G) is the maximum degree of G, and he characterized the graphs for which 
Δ ( 0 colors are not enough. 
Theorem 11 (Brooks [1941]). x(G) < A(G) + 1 holds for every graph G. More-
over, x(G) = A(G) + 1 if and only if either A(G) Φ 2 and G has a complete 
(A(G) + \)-graph ^ ( G ) + 1 as a connected component, or A(G) = 2 and G has an 
odd cycle as a connected component. 
The coloring number col(G) is defined as the smallest number d such that for 
some linear ordering < of the vertex set, the "back-degree" \{y : y < x,xy G E(G)}\ 
of every vertex x is strictly less than d. In other words, if the vertices of G are 
X\,x2,... 
,JC„, then 
col(G) = 1 + minmax{i/(;tp(,),Gp(,·))}, 
P 
i 
where the minimum is taken over all permutations p of {1,2 
«}, and Gp(,) is the 
subgraph of G induced by xpW, xp(2),.... 
*p(,), and where d(x, H) denotes the degree 
of a vertex x in a graph H. It is clear that col(G) ^ A(G) + 1, hence the inequality 
X(G) < col(G), 

8 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
obtained by sequentially coloring the vertices of G with col(G) colors, strengthens 
the inequality of Theorem 11. 
A smallest last order xp(i),xp(2)>... ,xp(„) of the vertices of G is obtained by 
letting Xpd) be a vertex of minimum degree 5(G,) in the subgraph 
Gj = G — {Xp(i+\),Xp(i+2), ■ ■ ■ ,Xp(n)}· 
for i = n, n - 1,..., 1. It follows that 
col(G) < 1 + max S(G,) < 1 + max Ö(G'). 
I Sis« 
C'CG 
In fact: 
Theorem 12 (Halin [1967], Matula [1968], Finck and Sachs [1969], Lick and 
White [1970]). 
col(G) = 1 + max 8(G[xD(\\,x0n\,... 
,x„<r\]) = 1 + max 8(G'), 
where xp(\), xP(i), ■■■, *P(«) is a smallest last order. 
Theorem 12 implies that col(G) is the smallest number k + 1 such that G is k-
degenerate; that is, every nonempty subgraph G1 of G has a vertex of degree at most 
k in G'. Moreover, the middle term in Theorem 12 shows that it is easy to calculate 
col(G): Among the n\ possible orders on the vertex set of G, the minimum in the 
definition of col(G) is attained by a smallest last order, and among the 2" induced 
subgraphs of G it is possible to find a G' giving the maximum value of S(G') among 
the only n easily obtained induced subgraphs G[xP(\),xP(2),... ,xPa)]. 
The coloring number was introduced and studied by Erdös and Hajnal [ 1966], the 
so-called Szekeres-Wilf number 1 + maxG-cG S(G') by Szekeres and Wilf [1968], 
and the property of being ^-degenerate by Lick and White [1970]. The Szekeres-
Wilf number was used implicitly by Vizing [1965a], who proved that the edge-
chromatic number of a graph G equals the maximum degree Δ when Δ s 2k and 
maxG/cc S(G') ^ k. 
Another useful and deep generalization of the inequality x(G) s A(G) + 1 is 
Theorem 13 (Hajnal and Szemeredi [1970]). A graph G may be colored by 
A(G) + 1 colors such that for any two colors i and j , where 1 < i < _/ < A(G) + 1, 
the numbers of vertices of color i and color j differ by at most one (i.e., the A(G) + 1 
color classes are equal or almost equal in size). 
1.4. CRITICALITY AND COMPLEXITY 
An element t of V(G) U E(G) is critical if x(G - t) < x(G). G is critical, or more 
precisely, x(G)-critical, if all edges and vertices of G are critical. The Λ-critical graphs 

Criticality and Complexity 
9 
are thus the minimal graphs with respect to subgraph inclusion in the class of all k-
chromatic graphs. If the vertices of G are critical, but not necessarily the edges, we 
say that G is x{G)-vertex-critical. No /t-critical graph can be infinite by Theorem 1. 
For k = 1,2, and 3 they are KUK2, and odd cycles, respectively. 
Theorem 14 (König [1916,1936]). A graph is 2-colorable if and only if it does not 
contain an odd cycle. 
The importance of the notion of criticality is that problems for ^-chromatic 
graphs in general may often be reduced to problems for ^-critical graphs, and these 
are more restricted than /r-chromatic graphs in general. Critical graphs were first 
defined and used by Dirac [1951, 1952a, 1952b, 1952c, 1953]. In terms of critical 
graphs Theorem 11 of Brooks may be reformulated as follows. 
Theorem 15 (Brooks [1941]). In a k-critical graph G all vertices have degree at 
least k — 1. Moreover, if all vertices have degree equal to k — 1, then either G is the 
complete k-graph Kk,ork = 3 and G is an odd cycle. 
A later generalization, the basis for a simple proof of Theorem 4 due to Dirac 
[1957b], is 
Theorem 16 (Dirac [1957c]). Let G be a k-critical graph. Ifk>4andG 
Φ Kk, 
then 
2\E(G)\ >(k- 
l)\V(G)\ + (k- 3). 
Dirac's original proof of Theorem 16 was rather complicated. Shorter and more 
elegant proofs were given by Kronk and Mitchem [1972a] and by Weinstein [1975]. 
Dirac [1974] characterized all ^-critical graphs G for which equality holds in Theo-
rem 16 (in each of these cases \V(G)\ — 2k - 1 holds). A further very important and 
elegant generalization of Brooks' theorem is 
Theorem 17 (Gallai [1963a]). Let Gbea k-critical graph with k > 4 and G Φ Kk. 
Then every block in the subgraph ofG induced by the vertices of degree k - 1 inG 
is either complete or an odd cycle. Moreover, 
2\E(G)\ > (k - 1)|V(G)| + ^ | | V ( G ) | . 
Using matching theory, Gallai [1963b] also obtained deep structural results on 
^-critical graphs on at most 2k — I vertices. All these results on fc-critical graphs are 
positive in the sense that they restrict the behavior of critical graphs. In his doctoral 
dissertation Stiebitz [1985] proved that in general the structure of it-critical graphs 
is manageable so long as the subgraph induced by the vertices of degree at least k 
is (k - 2)-colorable or complete (this is also explained in the survey by Sachs and 
Stiebitz [1989]). 

10 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
There are, however, also a large number of negative results showing that critical 
graphs may have a very unrestricted behavior. Thus A-critical graphs for k ^ 4 may 
have many edges (Dirac [1952a], Toft [1970a], V. Rödl and Stiebitz [1987b]), many 
independent vertices (Brown and Moon [1969], Simonovits [1972], Loväsz [1973b]), 
and high minimum degree (Simonovits [1972], Toft [1972b]). This is in sharp contrast 
to the situation for k = 3, when the only critical graphs are the odd cycles. A further 
such observation, based on the existence of 4-critical graphs with many edges, was 
made by V. Rödl and published by Toft [1985]: The number of nonisomorphic 4-
critical graphs on n vertices is larger than c(" ) for some c > 1. 
A constructive characterization of ^-chromatic graphs was obtained by G. Hajos 
in his approach to the four-color problem: A graph is Hajos-k-constructible if it can 
be obtained from complete ^-graphs Kk by repeated applications of the following two 
operations. 
(a) Hajos' construction: Let Gi and Gz be already obtained disjoint graphs with 
edges x\y\ and xzyi. Remove X\y\ and x^yi, identify x\ and Xi, and join y\ 
and v2 by a new edge. 
(b) Identify independent vertices. 
Theorem 18 (Hajos [1961]). A graph has chromatic number at least k if and only 
if it contains a Hajos-k-constructible subgraph. Every k-critical graph is Hajos-k-
constructible. 
Hajos' construction is extremely useful. However, despite its seemingly large 
generality and power, no interesting applications of Theorem 18 have been found. In 
particular, obtaining a proof of the nonexistence of 5-critical planar graphs, which 
was perhaps what Hajos hoped to achieve, seems far beyond its reach. 
A much more restricted type of critical graphs was introduced by Dirac [1960, 
1964a]. Let the notation G2 ^ G\ denote that G2 can be obtained from G\ by deletions 
of vertices and/or edges and contraction of edges, in any order. The terminology that 
Gi is a minor or a subcontraction of G \ is often used. The ^-chromatic graphs minimal 
with respect to s are called k-contraction-critical. For each value of k there is only 
one known Λ-contraction-critical graph, namely Κ^. The conjecture that there is no 
other is equivalent to Hadwiger's conjecture, known to be true for k ^ 6, with the 
cases k = 5 and 6 depending on the four-color theorem (see Section 1.2). 
Criticality also applies to hypergraphs, both uniform and nonuniform. If we say, 
based on the negative results stated above, that a rich and uncontrolled behavior of k-
critical graphs begins with k = 4, then for hypergraphs a similar rich and uncontrolled 
behavior starts in the 3-critical 3-uniform case (Loväsz [1973a], Toft [1975a], Müller, 
Rödl, and Turzik [1977]). 
The difficulty in characterizing the 4-critical graphs or the 3-critical hypergraphs 
is reflected in the difficulty of obtaining polynomial algorithms for graph 3-coloring 
or hypergraph 2-coloring. Both types of problems are NP-complete (for definitions 
of MP-complete and the classes NP and P, see the authoritative book by Garey and 
Johnson [1979]). 

Criticality and Complexity 
11 
Theorem 19 (Karp [1972], Lovasz [1973a], Stockmeyer [1973], Garey, Johnson, 
and Stockmeyer [1976], Toft [1975a], see also Garey and Johnson [1979]). The 
following problem types are NP-complete. In particular, there is a polynomial al-
gorithm for one of them if and only if there are polynomial algorithms for all of 
them. 
1. Hypergraph k-colorability. 
2. Graph k-colorability. 
3. Graph 3-colorability. 
4. 3-colorability for planar graphs of maximum degree 4. 
5. Hypergraph 2-colorability. 
6. 2-colorability for 3-uniform hypergraphs. 
An interesting recent negative result on approximative algorithms, mentioned in 
the very informative survey by Johnson [1992], is the following. 
Theorem 20 (Lund and Yannakakis [1993]). There is a positive constant eo such 
that if there is a polynomial graph coloring algorithm using, for every graph G, at 
most x(G) · | V(G)|*° colors, then there is a polynomial algorithm to determine x(G) 
for all G. 
At first sight the if part seems to ask for little, but the then part shows that it 
is in fact a lot, in particular NP would be equal to P and all six problem types in 
Theorem 19 would be polynomially solvable. 
An important class of hypergraphs deserves mentioning since it allows a poly-
nomial algorithm for the problem of &-colorability. If the edges of a hypergraph 
form the circuits of a matroid, then a coloring of the hypergraph corresponds to a 
partitioning of the elements of the matroid into classes that are independent in the 
matroid sense. This coloring problem has a very beautiful and satisfactory solution 
by Edmonds [1965a], both in terms of characterizing the chromatic number by a 
min-max theorem and in terms of a polynomial algorithm for determining its exact 
value. For definitions of matroids and a fine exposition of the basic theory, including 
the partitioning results of Edmonds, see the book by Welsh [1976], in particular 
Chapters 8 and 19. 
In general, hypergraphs might be expected to behave much more chaotically 
than graphs. However, for k ^ 4 the ^-critical hypergraphs seem no worse than 
the ^-critical graphs, since ^-critical hypergraphs can be transformed into it-critical 
graphs as follows. For an edge A of a hypergraph H take a (k — l)-critical graph 
G (disjoint from H) such that \V(G)\ ^ \A\. Remove the edge A from H without 
removing any vertices, and join each vertex of G to exactly one vertex of A in the 
remaining hypergraph so that each vertex of A is joined to at least one vertex of G. If 
the hypergraph H' obtained is (k - l)-colorable, then His(k— l)-colorable. In many 
special cases, for instance a graph consisting of an odd cycle completely joined to a 
Kk-4, the hypergraph //' is (/: — 1 )-colorable if and only if// is (k — l)-colorable, and 

12 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
//' is fc-critical if and only if// is ^-critical. In particular, hypergraph (k - 1 )-coloring 
can be reduced to graph (k — l)-coloring when k & 4. 
The construction method described above was used by Toft [1974a, 1975a], but 
the basic idea is due to B. Descartes in the case where H is the /t-critical r -uniform 
hypergraph consisting of all subsets of size r on (k - l)(r - 1) + 1 vertices. Thus 
constructively, the following theorem can be proved by induction over it. 
Theorem 21 (Descartes [1947,1948b, 1954], Kelly and Kelly [1954]). For every 
k ^ 4 there exists a k-chromatic graph in which every cycle has length 6 or more. 
1.5. SPARSE GRAPHS AND RANDOM GRAPHS 
The size of a largest complete subgraph, tt>(G), is obviously a lower bound for the 
chromatic numberx(G), and w(G) = 1 implies that x(G) - l.Zykov [1949] showed 
by examples that apart from these there are no relations between ω and χ in general. 
Theorem 21 shows this when w(G) = 2. 
The constructions of both Descartes and Zykov give ^-chromatic triangle-free 
graphs for all k, but the graphs obtained have vertex numbers exponential in it, as have 
the graphs of Mycielski [1955]. Erdös [1958] proved by a geometric construction the 
existence of ^-chromatic triangle-free graphs with only a polynomial number (k50) 
of vertices. Shortly thereafter Erdös obtained the following even more striking result 
with his elegant nonconstructive probabilistic method. 
Theorem 22 (Erdös [1959]). For all g > 4 and for sufficiently large k there exist 
k-chromatic graphs on at most kcg vertices (c > 0 constant) in which all cycles have 
lengths at least g. 
The proof given by Erdös shows that the best possible constant c of Theorem 22 
satisfies c ^ 2. A good exposition of the proof of a result very similar to Theorem 22, 
with the condition of k being "sufficiently large" removed at the cost of increasing 
the constant to c = 4, is given in the seminal book of Bollobäs [1978a]. Constructive 
inductive proofs of the existence for all g and k (without the bound on the number 
of vertices) were obtained by Loväsz [1968] and by NeSetril and Rödl [1979]. These 
constructions also included r-uniform hypergraphs—this extension was in fact es-
sential for making the induction work. More recently, Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak 
[ 1988] showed that a class of Ramanujan graphs provides explicit examples of graphs 
satisfying Theorem 22 for all g and k with c = 4 (their constructions do not involve 
the consideration of hypergraphs). 
The proof of Theorem 22 by Erdös was one of the first applications of the 
probabilistic method to graph coloring. The classical paper by Erdös and Renyi 
[1960] contained the definition of a random graph. For a positive integer n and real 
number p with 0 ^ p s 1, a random graph G{n,p) is a graph on n vertices so that 
for each unordered pair x, y of these, xy is an edge of G(n, p) with probability p 

Perfect Graphs 
13 
independently of all other pairs. The fine book by Bollobäs [1985] contains a vast 
collection of techniques and results in this area of graph theory. 
One of the most studied problems on random graphs has been the determination 
of the chromatic number of random graphs G(n, p), for p a fixed edge probability, 
as n approaches infinity. For many years it seemed possible that x(G(n,p)) might 
be distributed over a relatively wide range of values, even when n gets very large. 
However, that this is not the case was shown by Bollobäs, who managed to prove 
Theorem 23 (Bollobäs [1988]). For p fixed with 0 < p < 1 a random graph, 
G(n, p) satisfies 
Q - o(l))log(l/(l - P))^-n 
^ x{G(n,p)) < {^- + o(l))log(l/(l - 
p))^ 
with probability —»1 as n —► °°, where o(\) denotes a function of n converging to 
zero as n —► °°. 
It follows from Bollobäs' theorem with p = | that almost all graphs G satisfy 
(ΓΛ 
W{G)\ 
Af(G) 
21og2|V(G)|· 
Bollobäs, Catlin, and Erdös [1980] and independently Kostochka [1982] proved 
the important probabilistic result that Hadwiger's conjecture (see Section 1.2) is true 
for almost all graphs. Alon and Spencer [ 1992] gave a well-written in-depth treatment 
of the probabilistic method, including outlines of proofs of Theorems 22 and 23. 
1.6. PERFECT GRAPHS 
The opposite extreme of sparse graphs are perfect graphs. A graph G is perfect if 
G and each of the induced subgraphs of G has chromatic number equal to the size 
of its largest complete subgraph. The idea of perfect graphs grew out of the work 
of T. Gallai, who was among the first to emphasize the importance of min-max 
theorems for graphs and to apply linear programming duality in combinatorics (see 
Gallai [1958, 1959]). Gallai [1958] published a result, due to himself and D. König 
dating back to 1932, that in today's language would be phrased "the complement of 
any bipartite graph is perfect." Other such early results were obtained by Hajnal and 
Suränyi [1958], Berge [1960, 1961], Dirac [1961], and Gallai [1962]. The definition 
of perfect graphs appeared in Berge [1963a, 1966],' and this topic has been one of the 
'We do not know if the term "perfect graph" was used or if the perfect graph conjecture was mentioned 
in any publication prior to Berge [1963a]. Two other papers by Berge [1961, 1963b], often mentioned as 
the original sources to "perfectness" and to the perfect graph conjecture, do not explicitly refer to perfect 
graphs. Many historic details are contained in a manuscript by C. Berge, "The history of the perfect graphs" 
EC 94/02, Institut Blaise Pascal, Universite Paris VI, March 1994. 

14 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
most fruitful in graph theory, relating also to linear programming and computational 
complexity. Grötschel, Loväsz, and Schrijver [1981] proved, based on the existence 
of a polynomial algorithm for linear programming, that the chromatic number of a 
perfect graph can be computed in polynomial time (see also the recent interesting 
survey by Loväsz [1994]). For a general graph the problem of deciding if it is k-
colorable is W-complete for k S: 3, as first proved by Karp [1972]. An excellent 
survey of perfect graphs was presented by Loväsz [1983a] (see also the interesting 
Introduction written by Berge and Chvätal [1984] containing many historical details). 
Many classes of graphs are perfect, among them bipartite graphs and their com-
plements, triangulated graphs (where every cycle of length at least 4 has a diagonal, 
also called chordal or rigid circuit graphs) and their complements, comparability 
graphs (where the vertices are the elements of a partial order, and xy ε E(G) if and 
only if x and y are comparable), interval graphs (the intersection graphs of finite sets 
of intervals on the real line), and the graphs of Meyniel [1976] (where every odd 
cycle of length at least 5 has at least two diagonals). 
Inspired by a conjecture of Shannon [1956] on optimal codes, C. Berge and 
A. Ghouila-Houri studied the class of graphs containing neither odd cycles of length 
greater than or equal to 5 nor their complements as induced subgraphs. Such graphs 
are now commonly referred to as Berge graphs. Berge conjectured in the early 1960s 
that these graphs are precisely the perfect graphs. This implies the weaker, but also at 
the time unsolved conjecture that a graph is perfect if and only if its complement is 
perfect. In an attack on this weaker conjecture, Fulkerson [1971, 1972] considered a 
seemingly more restricted class of pluperfect graphs. Let G be a graph with vertices 
x\, x%,..., xn having nonnegative integer weights (wi, w2, ■. ■, w„) = w. Let \(G, w) 
denote the minimum number of independent subsets of V(G), where the same set may 
be counted more than once, such that χ,· is in at least w, of the sets for each /, Let w(G, w) 
denote the maximum weight of a complete subgraph of G—thus \(G, I) = x(G) and 
o>(G,l) = <o(G), where I = (1,1 
1). It is easy to see that x(G,w) > <o(G, w). 
A graph is pluperfect if x(G, w) = w(G, w) for all nonnegative integer weights w. 
Note that a graph is perfect, by definition, if and only if \(G, w) = w(G, w) for all 
(0, l)-valued weights w. 
Based on the duality theory of linear programming Fulkerson proved that the 
complement of a pluperfect graph is pluperfect. Loväsz then proved the following 
replacement theorem: If G is a perfect graph and x is a vertex of G, then replacing x by 
a perfect graph K joined completely to all the neighbors of x in G, one again obtains 
a perfect graph. This theorem implies that the pluperfect and the perfect graphs are 
in fact the same. Thus Loväsz obtained the first proof of Berge's weak perfect graph 
conjecture, changing it to the perfect graph theorem. 
Theorem 24 (Loväsz [1972a, 1972b]). A graph is perfect if and only if its comple-
ment is perfect. 
Loväsz gave two further proofs of the perfect graph theorem, the first of which 
was based on hypergraphs. In the second proof he extended Theorem 24 by charac-
terizing the perfect graphs as follows. 

Edge-Coloring 
15 
Theorem 25 (Loväsz [1972a]). A graph G is perfect if and only if every induced 
subgraph HofG satisfies 
«(//) ■ ω(Η) > |V(//)|, 
where a(H) is the size of a largest independent set of vertices in H, and ω(Η) is the 
size of a largest complete subgraph ofH. 
The stronger conjecture by Berge, also discovered by P.C. Gilmore, remains a 
challenging unsolved problem. The bulk of evidence in support of the conjecture 
has been steadily increasing over the years, beginning with the pioneering work by 
Gallai, Berge, and others mentioned above. 
Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture (Berge [1963a, 1966]). The perfect graphs are 
precisely the Berge graphs. Equivalently, the nonperfect graphs for which all induced 
proper subgraphs are perfect are precisely the odd cycles of length at least 5 and 
their complements. 
Chvätal [1984b] formulated the following "semistrong perfect graph conjecture": 
IfG and H are graphs on the same vertex set, with the property that any four vertices 
induce a path in G if and only if they induce a path in H, then G is perfect if and only 
ifH is perfect. 
This statement implies the perfect graph theorem since the complement of a path on 
four vertices is again a path. It is also implied by the strong perfect graph conjecture. 
The semistrong perfect graph conjecture was proved by Reed [1987]. A probabilistic 
argument of Prömel and Steger [ 1992] implies that the strong perfect graph conjecture 
is "almost true." They proved that almost all Berge graphs are perfect. 
1.7. 
EDGE-COLORING 
Let us first note that the edge-chromatic number χ'(Η) of a graph or hypergraph H 
equals x(L(H)), where L(H) is the line graph of//, defined by V(L(//)) = £(//) and 
E(L(H)) = {xy : x and y are distinct nondisjoint edges of//}. 
Thus edge coloring is equivalent to vertex coloring of a line graph. 
Compared with vertex coloring the theory of edge coloring has received less 
attention until relatively recently. However, much studied areas, such as map coloring, 
matching theory, and Latin squares, have strong connections to edge coloring. The 
first important observation on edge coloring was Tait's theorem. 

16 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
Theorem 26 (Tait [1880]). The faces of a 3-regular plane graph G can be 4-colored 
if and only ifG can be 3-edge-colored. 
The next important result was a theorem of D. König, obtained in connection 
with his study of factorizations of bipartite graphs. 
Theorem 27 (König [1916]). For a bipartite graph G (with multiple edges allowed) 
the edge-chromatic number χ'(β) equals the maximum degree A(G). 
An η-edge coloring of a complete bipartite graph K„iH corresponds to a Latin 
square. The following theorem answers a conjecture of T. Evans from 1960 on 
completing partial Latin squares and also characterizes the extremal cases. 
Theorem 28 (Andersen and Hilton [1983]). A partial edge coloring φ of at most 
n edges ofKnn can be extended to an n-edge coloring ofK„„ except in the following 
two cases: 
(a) For some uncolored edge xy there are n colored edges of different colors, 
each one incident with x or y. 
(b) For some vertex x and some color i, the color i is not incident to x, but it is 
incident to all vertices yfor which xy is uncolored. 
Following Tait and König, the next breakthrough was the theorem of Vizing, 
obtained independently by Gupta. 
Theorem 29 (Vizing [1964, 1965b], Gupta [1966]). Let G be a multigraph of 
multiplicity μ(ο). Then χ'(β) < A(G) + μ ( 0 . 
From this result one can prove the theorem of Shannon [1949] that x'(G) ^ 
3A(G)/2. 
It follows immediately from Vizing's theorem that x'(G) is equal to either A(G) 
or A(G) + 1 when G is simple (μ(ΰ) = 1). For the line graph H of G we have 
X(H) = x'(G) and A(G) = ω{Η) [provided that A(G) a 3J. Therefore, Theorem 29 
with μ(0 
= 1 may be formulated as follows. When H is a line graph of a simple 
graph, χ(Η) equals ω(Η) or ω(Η) + 1. 
It was proved by Beineke [1970] that H is a line graph L(G) of a simple graph 
G if and only if H does not contain any one of nine specified graphs as induced 
subgraphs. To obtain the same conclusion for χ(Η) as above, all but two of these 
forbidden subgraphs can in fact be eliminated. Thus we have the following interesting 
generalization of Vizing's theorem for simple graphs. 
Theorem 30 (Kierstead and Schmerl [1983]). IfH is a simple graph containing 
neither a complete 5-graph with an edge missing nor a complete bipartite graph Κ\τ, 
as an induced subgraph, then χ(Η) is equal to ω(//) or ω(//) + 1. 

Orientations and Integer Flows 
17 
1.8. 
ORIENTATIONS AND INTEGER FLOWS 
The chromatic number of a graph G has been characterized in terms of orientations 
of G in two different ways. The "only if" parts are easy to obtain by directing the 
edges from smaller to larger colors. 
Theorem 31 (Minty [1962]). A graph G is k-colorable if and only if G has an 
orientation in which the flow ratio of any cycle C (i.e., the maximum of m/n and 
n/m, where n is the number of edges of C pointing in one direction and m is the 
number of edges ofC pointing in the opposite direction) is at most k — 1. 
Theorem 32 (Roy [1967], Gallai [1968]). A graph G is k-colorable if and only if 
G has an orientation in which the length of every directed path is at most k — 1. 
Weaker versions of Theorem 32 were obtained earlier by Vitaver [1962] and 
Gupta [1963], and a stronger version is due to Bondy [1976]. 
Replacing "cycle" by "edge-cut" in the formulation of Minty's theorem, then 
instead of characterizing /:-colorability, the new statement characterizes the property 
of having a fc-flow. A (nowhere zero, integer) k-flow in an undirected graph is an 
assignment to each edge of a direction and a weight from {1,2 
k - 1} such 
that for each vertex v the sum of the weights on the edges directed into v equals 
the sum of the weights on the edges directed away from v. Since there is a duality 
between cycles and edge cuts in graphs, "^-coloring" and "/>flow" are in a sense dual 
concepts. For example, Theorem 14 (König's theorem) restricted to planar graphs 
can be formulated in the following dual version: A planar graph has a 2-flow if and 
only if all its vertices have even degrees. The fact that the word "planar" can be 
removed is essentially the classical theorem of Euler [1736] that a necessary and 
sufficient condition for a connected graph to have an Euler tour is that all degrees be 
even. Theorem 9 of Heawood and Theorem 26 of Tait can similarly be extended to 
nonplanar graphs by omitting the word "planar" in their integer flow reformulations: 
A 3-regular planar graph has a 3-flow if and only if it is bipartite, and it has a 4-flow 
if and only if it is 3-edge-colorable. 
The following conjecture may be seen as a far-reaching generalization of the five-
color theorem for planar graphs (note that "bridge" and "loop" are dual concepts). 
5-Flow Conjecture (Tutte [1954]). Every graph without bridges has a 5-flow. 
As opposed to the five-color theorem for planar graphs, the 5-flow conjecture, 
which includes nonplanar graphs, would be the best possible. The Petersen graph 
has a 5-flow but not a 4-flow. The best result in the direction of Tutte's conjecture, 
strengthening an earlier 8-flow theorem proved by Kilpatrick [1975] in his Ph.D. 
thesis and independently obtained by Jaeger [1976a], is 
Theorem 33 (Seymour [1981a]). Every graph without bridges has a 6-flow. 

18 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
In a &-flow the numbers \,2,...,k— 
1 may be thought of as elements of Z*, the 
integers modulo k, and the flow can then be described as a (nowhere zero) "Lk-flow. 
For an Abelian group A, a (nowhere zero) A-flow in a graph G is an assignment of a 
direction and a nonzero value from A to every edge of G such that for every vertex 
v G V(G) the sum in A of the weights of edges directed into v equals the sum in A 
of the weights of edges directed away from v. 
It is easy to see that the number of different (not necessarily nowhere zero) 
A-flows in G is |A|'£(G)'~'£(/r", where F is a spanning forest in G which satisfies 
\E(F)\ = |K(G)|-(the number of connected components in G). Using the principle 
of inclusion and exclusion it follows that the number of different (nowhere zero) 
A-flows in G is independent of the detailed group structure of A and depends only 
on the order |A|. This observation is due to Tutte [1954]. Tutte also observed that a 
graph has a k-f\ow if and only if it has a Z^-flow, and hence if and only if it has an 
A-flow for some Abelian group A of order k. Younger [ 1983] and Jaeger [1988] gave 
original well-written surveys of integer flows. 
1.9. LIST COLORING 
A surprising type of relation between colorings and orientations was obtained recently. 
Theorem 34 (Alon and Tarsi [1992]). Let G be an orientation of a graph G. If the 
number of spanning Eulerian subgraphs ofG with an even number of edges differs 
from the number of spanning Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges, then 
for any assignment of a set A(v) ofd+(y) + 1 colors to every vertex v ofG, where 
d+(v) denotes the out-degree of v in G, there exists a proper coloring (pofG such 
that φ(ν) e A(v)forall 
v E V(G). 
A directed graph H is Eulerian if each vertex v £ V(H) has out-degree d+(v) 
equal to its in-degree d~(v). The number of even spanning Eulerian subgraghs of a 
directed graph G is always at least one, since H with V(H) = V(G) and E(H) = 0 
is such a subgraph. Thus in particular an orientation without odd directed cycles 
satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 34. When applied to the special case of acyclic 
orientations, the theorem generalizes the inequality x(G) ^ col(G). 
The proof of Theorem 34 is algebraic and based on a study of the properties of 
the graph polynomial 
fc(*\ ,X2 
*«)= 
Π 
(·*' ~ -^) 
ViVjBE(G) 
<<j 
in n = \V(G)\ variables X\,X2 
xn< where the vertices of G have been arranged in 
some fixed order v\,V2,···, 
v„. This polynomial was introduced by Sylvester [1878] 
and studied also by Petersen [1891]. Interesting descriptions of graph colorability in 
terms of the graph polynomial were found by D.J. Kleitman and Loväsz [1982,1994] 

List Coloring 
19 
and by Alon and Tarsi [ 1992]. Kleitman and Loväsz's result simply states that x(G) ^ 
k if and only if fa is the sum of graph polynomials /« for a family of graphs H with 
V(H) = V(G) and AT* C H. Alon and Tarsi's result is slightly more involved to 
formulate. Given n polynomials Q\(x), Qz(x), ..., Qn(x) without multiple zeros over 
the field of complex numbers C, Alon and Tarsi proved that G has no vertex coloring 
φ : V(G) -» C such that Q,(<p(t>,)) = 0 for all i = 1,2,..., n, if and only if there 
exist polynomials g,(xi, x%,..., x„) such that the graph polynomial for G can be ex-
pressed as 
fa(Xl, Xl, ■ ■ ■ . Xn) = 
X 
gi(Xl ,Xl,...,X„)· 
Qi(Xi). 
The "if" part of this statement is the easy part. The proof of Theorem 34 is obtained by 
combining this result with results describing the connection between the coefficients 
of/o and orientations of G. 
The idea of associating with each vertex v of G a list A(v) from which the color 
of v has to be chosen in a coloring of G is due independently to Vizing [1976] and 
to Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor [1979]. The list-chromatic number xe(G) of G is the 
smallest number k for which, for any assignment of a list A(v) of size at least k to 
every vertex v £ V(G), it is possible to color G so that every vertex gets a color from 
its list. G is said to be k-choosable if xe(G) < k, and the list-chromatic number of G 
is also sometimes called the choice number, denoted by ch(G). 
It is clear that x(G) ^ Xe(G). But equality does not hold in general. Let H be 
a 3-chromatic Λ-uniform hypergraph with n edges. Then X((Knn) > k + 1, as can 
be seen from assigning lists corresponding to the edges of H to the vertices on both 
sides of K„f„. Thus H = Kj, gives ^(^3,3) ^ 3. However, the following remarkable 
extension of Brooks' theorem to list colorings is true. It was obtained by Vizing and 
independently by Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor. 
Theorem 35 (Vizing [1976], Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor [1979]). 
Xe(G) < A(G) + 
1 holds for every graphG. Moreover, Xe(G) = A(G) + 1 if and only if either A(G) Φ 2 
and G has a complete (A(G) + 1)-graph ^Δ(Ο)+Ι as a connected component, or 
A(G) = 2 and G has an odd cycle as a connected component. 
The list-coloring problem for planar graphs has been solved quite recently. A 
conjecture that Heawood's five-color theorem can be generalized to list coloring is 
due to Vizing in 1975 [personal communication from O.V. Borodin in 1985]. The 
conjecture was also posed independently by Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor [1979]. Voigt 
[1993] proved that unlike the situation for the usual coloring of planar graphs, "five" 
cannot be replaced by "four" in this conjecture, by giving an example of a planar 
graph with 238 vertices that has list-chromatic number five. The upper bound of five 
was proved by C. Thomassen with a very short and elegant induction argument. 
Theorem 36 (Voigt [1993], Thomassen [1993e]). The maximum list-chromatic 
number of planar graphs is five. Moreover, if each vertex on the boundary of the 

20 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
infinite face of a plane graph G has a list of three colors assigned to it, and if each 
remaining vertex has a list of five colors assigned to it, then there exists a coloring of 
G so that every vertex receives a color from its list. 
The proof by Thomassen of the last part of Theorem 36 does not make use 
of Euler's formula, and the procedure for finding a coloring of G does not involve 
re-coloring of previously colored vertices. Thomassen remarked that the proof is per-
haps the simplest known proof for Heawood's five-color theorem. One may observe 
[personal communication from D. Hanson in 1993] the interesting implication of 
Theorem 36 that if G is a planar graph with a connected bipartite induced subgraph 
H, then it is always possible to extend a 2-coloring of H to a 5-coloring of G. In 
addition, Thomassen's proof directly implies a simple linear 5-coloring algorithm, 
compared to degree 2 polynomial algorithms derived from the traditional proofs of 
Heawood's five-color theorem. 
As pointed out by O.V. Borodin [personal communication in 1993] it should be 
noted that Voigt's example mentioned above shows that the sphere is the only surface 
S for which the maximum list-chromatic number ^(S) of graphs embeddable on 
S exceeds the maximum chromatic number x(S) of graphs on S. That is, for every 
surface S other than the sphere, xe(S) = x(S). This can be seen by observing that 
a minimal graph G of list-chromatic number k must have minimum degree 8(G) 3: 
k — 1. Thus similarly to the derivation of Heawood's upper bound x(S) s Η(ε) (see 
Theorem 2), where ε denotes the Euler characteristic of S, one can derive the stronger 
bound X((S) ^ Η(ε). Using Theorem 3, xe(S) = *(S) follows, except when S is the 
Klein bottle. To show that Xe(G) £ ^(Klein bottle) = 6 if G is embedded on the 
Klein bottle, one may assume by minimality that the minimum degree of G satisfies 
g(G) 2= 6. An easy application of Euler's formula for the Klein bottle implies that G 
is 6-regular, thus Theorem 35 gives the desired bound on Xe(G). 
In general, the list-chromatic number satisfies x(G) ^ Xe(G) ^ col(G). In some 
instances treated above, χ( behaves more like χ than like col. As a further example 
of this, \t satisfies Theorem 1, as noted by Johnson [1994], whereas col does not 
satisfy Theorem 1 (see Erdös and Hajnal [1966]). However, Alon [1993] showed with 
a probabilistic proof that there exists a function g such that if Xe(G) £ s, then the 
average degree of G (and of all subgraphs of G) is bounded from above by g(s), and 
hence col(G) is bounded from above by g(s) + 1. Thus a class of graphs has bounded 
list-chromatic number if and only if it has bounded coloring number. Since col is 
an easily controlled parameter, this can be used in constructions of classes of graphs 
G where x(G) and Xe(G) behave very differently. For example, if Gj is d-regular, 
then col(G</) = d + ί —»=» as <i —* °°> and hence also Xi(Gd) ~* °°· But χ(βα) may 
of course be bounded from above, even by 2. 
For the list-edge-chromatic number x[(G), where the lists of colors are assigned 
to the edges of G and each edge must be colored with a color from its list, it is 
expected that this number is always equal to the edge-chromatic number of G. The 
following conjecture first appeared in print in a paper by Bollobäs and Harris [1985], 
but it was thought of earlier by V.G. Vizing, R.P. Gupta, and by M.O. Albertson and 
K.L. Collins, all independently (see Häggkvist and Chetwynd [1992]). 

Generalized Graph Coloring 
21 
List-coloring Conjecture. Every graph G satisfies x'e(G) = x'{G). 
The special case G = Kn „ is a classical problem due to J. Dinitz. It is often 
formulated in terms of an n X n array of sets all of size n and asks if it is always 
possible to choose one element from every set so that the chosen elements from 
each row are distinct as are the chosen elements from each column. F. Galvin gave 
a very short argument answering the Dinitz problem in the affirmative [personal 
communications from N. Alon and L. Goddyn in 1994]. The same argument can 
easily be extended to show that the list-coloring conjecture holds for every bipartite 
graph G. 
Borodin [ 1990b] proved that χ[ - Δ holds for planar graphs of maximum degree 
Δ > 14. 
For d-regular d-edge-colorable planar graphs the conjecture χ[ — χ' is true, as 
proved by Ellingham and Goddyn [1993] using Theorem 34. The case d = 3 is 
implied by results of Vigneron [1946] (see also Jaeger [1989] and Kauffman [1990]) 
and Scheim [1974] combined with Theorem 34. This implies by Theorem 26 that the 
four-color theorem is equivalent to the statement that every 2-connected 3-regular 
planar graph has list-edge-chromatic number 3, see Alon [1993], who remarked that 
this had been observed independently by F. Jaeger and M. Tarsi. 
Fleischner and Stiebitz [1992] used Theorem 34 to prove that any 4-regular 
graph whose edges partition into pairwise disjoint triangles together with a Hamilton 
cycle is 3-colorable.2 Theorem 34 in fact gave even more, namely that such a graph 
is 3-choosable. Thus in some cases when considering an open problem of the form 
X(G) ^ k, it may be of advantage to consider the stronger statement xe(G) ^ k—if 
it is true! Recent surveys of list colorings were given by Häggkvist and Chetwynd 
[1992] and by Alon [1993]. 
1.10. GENERALIZED GRAPH COLORING 
Problems, results, and definitions in graph coloring theory have variations, extensions, 
and/or reformulations ad infinitum, it seems. For example: 
Theorem 37 (Mihok [1992]). Let T be a tree on k + 1 vertices (k 2: 4) and let 
G be a k-critical graph not containing T as a subgraph. Then G is the complete 
k-graphKit. 
The case of Theorem 37 when T is the it-star (i.e., the complete bipartite graph 
K\jc) is the essential part of Theorem 15 (Brooks' theorem). Thus the statement of 
Theorem 37 is obtained from Theorem 15 by replacing K\ik by an arbitrary tree on 
k + 1 vertices. 
Other variations and extensions in graph coloring theory have been described 
by Jones [1974], Hedetniemi [1973], and Harary [1985], among others. Following 
2As observed by Fellows [1990], this is equivalent to a theorem on integer partitions. However, the often 
stated claim that it was formulated as an open problem by I. Schur seems based on a misunderstanding 
[personal communication from Fellows in 1994]. 

22 
Introduction to Graph Coloring 
Borowiecki and Mihok [1991], we shall briefly describe a language that may be used 
in formulating problems of graph coloring in a general setting. 
Let Pi, P2,. ■ ■, Pk be graph properties. A(PUP2,-., 
Pu-partition of a graph G 
is a partition (Vit V2,..., V*) of the vertex set V(G) such that the subgraph G[Vi\ 
induced by V, has property Λ for i = 1,2 
k. If G has a (P\, P2, · · ·, /^-partition, 
then we say that G has property Px · P2 ·... · Pk- If P\ = P2 = · · · = Pk = P, then 
P\ · P2- ... ■ Pk = Pk. Letting O denote the property to be without edges, Ok is the 
property to be Λ-colorable. The possible uniqueness of a factorization P\ · P2· ...· Pk 
of a reducible property into irreducible properties seems unexplored. 
In particular, it seems fruitful to consider hereditary properties, meaning those P 
that are preserved in all subgraphs of graphs having P. The set of all such properties 
(considering a property as the set of mutually nonisomorphic graphs having the 
property) forms a lattice L under inclusion. A hereditary property P is determined 
uniquely by its associated set F{P) of forbidden subgraphs defined by 
F(P) = {G : G £ P, but H e P for every proper subgraph H of G}. 
For example, Τ{&) is the class of (k + l)-critical graphs. 
Define the completeness of a hereditary property P as the maximum k for 
which Kk+\ has P (only the property consisting of all graphs has infinite com-
pleteness). Let Lk denote the elements of L with completeness k. Then Lk is a 
sublattice of L with least element Ok to have at most k + 1 vertices, for which 
F(Ok) — {the complement of ^ + 2 } , and largest element /* not to contain £*+2. for 
which Tik) = {Kk+i}· The property Ok+] to be (k + l)-colorable is in Lk; likewise, 
the property S* to have maximum degree Δ at most k (with F(Sk) = {/^u+i}). and 
for a particular tree T on k + 2 vertices the property not to contain T as a subgraph. 
Theorems 11 and 37 explore some relations between these elements of L. We will 
mention some further relations that are connected to usual graph coloring and can be 
stated naturally as generalized graph coloring results. 
Let Cp be the property to be p-degenerate (i.e., to have coloring number at most 
p + 1). Then it is not hard to see that for all p, q s 0, 
Cp+q+\ £ Cp · Cq. 
A similarly expressed but less trivial result is 
Theorem 38 (Loväsz [1966]). Let Sp be the property to have maximum degree at 
most p. Then for p,q ^ 0, 
Theorem 38 implies a Brooks-type result for graphs G without a Kr subgraph 
(r > 4): 
X(G) < ^ V ( G ) + 2)

found independently by Borodin and Kostochka [ 1977], Catlin [ 1978a], and Lawrence 
[1978]. Another very interesting result is 
Theorem 39 (Bollobäs and Manvel [1979]). With properties SP,CP, and Ip defined 
as above, and with p,q S: 1 satisfying pq > 1, 
Sp+q Π Ip+q-\ C (Cp-i Π Sp) · {Cq-\ ΙΊ Sq). 
Note that for p,q ^ 1, since the chromatic number never exceeds the coloring 
number, 
(c,-, n Sp) ■ (c,_, n sq) c c H · c,_, <ζορσ< = o"^. 
Theorem 39 may thus be regarded as yet another extension of Brooks' Theo-
rem 11 for the case Δ > 3, which we can reformulate as follows. 
Theorem 40 (Brooks [1941]). With properties Sp and Ip defined as above and for 
n > 3 ,

1.11. FINAL REMARKS 
This brief introduction to graph coloring hopefully indicates that graph coloring 
theory has come a long way since its beginnings almost one and a half century ago. 
But very many challenging unsolved problems remain. So let us now embark on our 
journey into the jungle of these problems, remembering the words of the Danish poet 
and designer Piet Hein:

2.1. FOUR-COLOR THEOREM 
Does there exist a short proof of the four-color theorem, that every planar 
graph is 4-colorable, in which all the details can be checked by hand by 
a competent mathematician in, say, two weeks? 
Is it possible by a short argument at least to exhibit a number N such 
that if there is a 5-chromatic planar graph, then there is a 5-chromatic 
planar graph of at most N vertices? That is, is there a short argument to 
demonstrate that the four-color problem is a finite problem? 
Does there exist a graph coloring algorithm A (possibly derived from a 
complicated proof of the four-color theorem) such that A, with a planar 
graph G as input, produces a 4-coloring of G in at most c · \V(G)\d steps, 
where c is a constant and d < 2? 
Finally: Is there a short argument that proves the existence of a polynomial 
algorithm to decide if a given planar graph is 4-colorable? 
■ 
The celebrated four-color problem, due to F. Guthrie, asks if every planar graph 
is 4-colorable. A proposed solution by Kempe [1879] stood for more than a decade 
until it was refuted by Heawood [1890] in his first paper. For a brief sketch of the 
history of the problem see Chapter 1. 
The proof of the four-color theorem by Appel and Haken [1977a] and Appel, 
Haken, and Koch [1977] was based on the same basic idea as Kempe's proof, that 
is, to find a set of unavoidable and reducible configurations (see Theorem 5 in 
Chapter 1). But where Kempe's configurations were vertices of degree at most 5, 
Appel and Haken's initial set had 1936 configurations (Appel and Haken [1977a, 
1989] announced that proofs with only 1482, 1405, and 1256 configurations are 
possible). The unavoidability of the set of configurations was obtained by an elaborate 
"discharging procedure" and their reducibility established by computer calculations. 
The four-color proof was the first example of a mathematical proof relying heav-
ily on the use of computers. It is interesting to note that in the early days of the

Planar Graphs 
development of electronic computers, M.H.A. Newman at the University of Man-
chester wrote a letter dated 8 February 1946 to J. von Neumann at Princeton University 
stating that with the advent of fast electronic computers "... mathematical problems 
of an entirely different kind from those so far tackled by machines might be tried, e.g. 
testing out (say) the 4-color theorem [sic] ..." (Newman [1946]). (A team headed 
by Newman built an electronic computer that became operational in mid-1948 in 
Manchester, England. Presumably it was the first working electronic stored-program 
computer; see, e.g., Randell [1980].) The use of computers in mathematical proofs 
should not necessarily be avoided; in fact, one would tend to trust a computer more 
than a human being testing a very large number of logically clear cases. However, 
the four-color theorem seems such a simple statement that one would want a more 
elegant and more easily checkable proof than the one presented by Appel and Haken. 
Gardner [1980] remarked: "The proof is an extraordinary achievement 
To most 
mathematicians, however, the proof of the four-color conjecture [sic] is deeply un-
satisfactory" 
Regarding the time involved in checking parts of their proof by hand, Appel 
and Haken [1978] wrote: "A person could easily check the part of the discharging 
procedure that did not involve reducibility computations in a month or two" 
N. Robertson, D.P. Sanders, P.D. Seymour, and R. Thomas [personal commu-
nication from N. Robertson and P.D. Seymour in 1994] have recently obtained a 
new improved proof of the four-color theorem, essentially using the same approach 
as Appel, Haken, and Koch. This proof, based on a simpler discharging procedure, 
involves less than 700 configurations. 
Concerning the question of finiteness; for all surfaces (compact 2-dimensional 
manifolds) other than the sphere, the coloring problem is finite, as shown by Dirac 
[1956, 1957a] and by Schumacher and Wagner [1985]. For example, for a surface S 
of Euler characteristic ε s —2 it is very easy to prove that the maximum chromatic 
number among all graphs embeddable on S equals the maximum chromatic number 
among such graphs of size at most (—6e). If no simple proof of the four-color theorem 
for the plane can be obtained, it would be very desirable to have at least a simple 
proof of the finiteness. An answer to the following question would provide a step in 
this direction: 
Does there exist a number N > 0 so that for all « s N every configuration 
(without separating triangles) consisting of an n-ring containing m interior vertices, 
where m > 3n/2 — 6, is reducible1 or contains a smaller reducible subconfiguration? 
In essence, this question was asked by Appel and Haken [ 1977a], except that they 
stated it without any lower bound N for ring size. Their conjecture, that the answer 
1 Here "reducible" means, more precisely, "D-reducible"—for a discussion of the concept of D-reducibility 
introduced by H. Heesch, see Whitney and Tutte [1975]. Informally, if a D-reducible configuration is 
contained in a plane triangulation, one may simply delete all the vertices interior to the bounding outer 
ring of the configuration and consider a possible 4-coloring of the remaining graph. If any such 4-coloring 
exists, then the original graph can also be 4-colored, either by extending the existing 4-coloring directly 
to the vertices in the interior, or by modifying the coloring by some sequence of color-pair (or "Kempe-
chain") interchanges (involving only the vertices of the configuration ring and the vertices exterior to it) 
to obtain some other coloring which can be thus extended. 

Four-Color Theorem 
33 
to the question in its original stronger form is affirmative, would strengthen the four-
color theorem (take n = 3, say, or remove a vertex of small degree n from any plane 
triangulation and consider the remaining n-ring configuration). If the weaker version 
of Appel and Haken's question as formulated above can be answered in the affirmative, 
then proving finiteness of the four-color problem might be possible: A suitable 
extension of a separator theorem proved by Lipton and Tarjan [1979] (see also Alon, 
Seymour, and Thomas [1994]) might be used to find reducible configurations in all 
sufficiently large plane triangulations. This possibility was brought to our attention by 
P.D. Seymour [personal communication in 1994]. A related question of unavoidability 
in plane triangulations of certain sets of "likely to be reducible" configurations was 
solved by Appel and Haken [1976b] and independently by Stromquist [1975]. 
The algorithmic version of the four-color problem was brought to our attention by 
P. Ungar [personal communication in 1986]. To say that a problem is "simple," as seen 
from an algorithmic viewpoint, means that it can be solved in a polynomial number 
of steps, and preferably such that the polynomial has a low degree d. Since every 
planar graph has vertices of degree at most 5 it is easy to give a linear (i.e., d — 1) 
6-coloring algorithm for planar graphs: Arrange the vertices in a smallest last order 
X\,X2,... ,x\,. ■■ ,xn (i.e., JCJis of smallest degree in G — x„— x„-\ - · · · - xi+i)and 
color the vertices sequentially in the order 
χλ,Χ2,...,χη. 
Heawood's proof of the five-color theorem can similarly be translated into a 
5-coloring algorithm with at most c · |V(G)|2 steps for any planar graph G. In fact, 
linear 5-coloring algorithms for planar graphs were presented by Matula, Shiloach, 
and Tarjan [1980, 1981] and independently by Chiba, Nishizeki, and Saito [1981]. 
A particularly simple linear 5-coloring algorithm is implicit in a recent new proof of 
the five-color theorem given by C. Thomassen (see Theorem 36 in Chapter 1). 
It has been widely stated (e.g., Matula, Shiloach and Tarjan [1980], Frederickson 
[1984], Boyar and Karloff [1987], Nishizeki and Chiba [1988], or Chrobak and Yung 
[1989]) that the proof by Appel, Haken, and Koch can be translated into a polynomial 
algorithm with d = 2 for 4-coloring an arbitrary planar graph. This misconception, 
as it seems, may possibly be due to some of the early descriptions of the proof—for 
example, an informal discussion given by Haken [1977] that omitted certain critical 
details concerning the logical structure of the proof. We will now address these critical 
points in a little more detail. 
The proof by Appel, Haken, and Koch contains a particular treatment of non-
induced configurations as a special case, Suppose that G contains a configuration C 
belonging to the unavoidable set U. Because of the particular concept of "configura-
tion containment" used in the proof, it may be the case that distinct vertices and/or 
edges of C have been identified in G, or that there exist edges of G joining vertices that 
are nonadjacent in C. When either case occurs, the usual reduction methods do not 
necessarily apply. However, the limited ring size and diameter of the configurations 
in U ensures that a short separating cycle (of length at most 6, which is crucial) can 
be detected in G. Results of Bernhart [1947] must then be applied to reducing such a 
cycle. An immediate algorithmic implementation of A. Bernhart's reduction unfor-
tunately produces an algorithm A with possibly an exponential worst-case behavior. 
Essentially, the reduction may require consideration of 4-colorings of as many as 92 

34 
Planar Graphs 
smaller reduced graphs in order to obtain eventually a 4-coloring of G. Hence, as a 
rough estimate of the worst-case behavior of A, the algorithm may perform as many 
as 92|V(G)I steps before finishing. Appel and Haken [1989] addressed this problem 
in an appendix, where they showed that one can in fact obtain a polynomial time 
algorithm from a modified version of their proof. Due to complications in dealing 
with noninduced configurations, they succeeded only in constructing an algorithm 
with d = 4. 
The newly obtained proof of N. Robertson, D.P. Sanders, P.D. Seymour, and 
R. Thomas, using a simpler discharging procedure, gives an unavoidable set with 
configurations that can be reduced in a straightforward manner, avoiding the com-
plications just described. In fact, from this proof a quadratic (i.e., d = 2) 4-coloring 
algorithm for planar graphs can be derived [personal communication from P.D. Sey-
mour in 1994]. 
In contrast, the existence of a polynomial 3-coloring algorithm A1 for 3-colorable 
planar graphs is unlikely. Such an A1 could be used to decide if a given planar graph is 
3-colorable or not in a polynomial number of steps. However, this decision problem is 
NP-complete even for graphs of maximum degree at most 4, as proved by Stockmeyer 
[1973] and Garey, Johnson, and Stockmeyer [1976] (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1). 
See also the book on W-completeness by Garey and Johnson [1979]. 
There is another related algorithmic question that has been asked. Is there a 
polynomial algorithm that takes a planar graph G as input and gives as output the 
number of distinct 4-colorings of G? However, a positive answer to this question 
seems extremely unlikely. Vertigan and Welsh [1992] reported negative results on a 
wide range of combinatorial enumeration problems for planar graphs. In particular, 
the problem of counting the 4-colorings of a planar graph is #P-complete, even 
when restricting to plane triangulations with all degrees even. Enumeration problems 
that are #P-complete are widely considered even more unlikely to be polynomially 
solvable than their counterparts among the decision problems, the NP-complete 
problems (for a brief introduction to enumeration problems and the class #P, see 
Garey and Johnson [1979]). 
The last question is due to S. McGuinness [personal communication in 1991], 
asking for a short argument proving that the problem of deciding if a given pla-
nar graph is 4-colorable can be solved in polynomial time. A short proof of the 
four-color theorem would give such an algorithm—indeed a very trivial one, always 
answering YES for all input graphs! Perhaps one possible approach to McGuinness' 
question would be to consider the possibility of a polynomial algorithm for decid-
ing 3-colorability of a 4-regular planar graph. It follows from the theorem of Tait 
(Theorem 26 in Chapter 1) that the four-color theorem is equivalent to the statement 
that the (planar and 4-regular) line graph of any 3-regular planar graph without a 
bridge is 3-colorable. A polynomial algorithm for 3-coloring the line graph of any 
3-regular planar graph without a bridge is in fact equivalent to a polynomial algorithm 
for 4-coloring any planar graph. Thus the polynomial 4-coloring algorithm of Appel 
and Haken [ 1989] gives a polynomial algorithm for 3-coloring 2-connected 4-regular 
planar line graphs. However, not every 2-connected 4-regular planar graph can be 
3-colored, as shown by Koester [1985a, 1985b, 1990]. Deciding 3-colorability of a 

Cartesian Sequences 
35 
planar graph of maximum degree four is W-complete (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1), 
but this does not seem to imply that deciding 3-colorability of a 4-regular planar graph 
is iV/'-complete. 
The finiteness question and the question of McGuinness appear to be indepen-
dent, and both seem considerably weaker than the problem of finding a short proof 
of the four-color theorem.

(a) two neighboring letters are different, and

■ 
This problem does not have the appearance of a graph coloring problem. However, 
the sisters Blanche and Rose Descartes proved in 1968, using the theorem of Whitney 
[1931] on Hamilton cycles in 4-connected plane triangulations, that the existence of 
Cartesian sequences as described above is in fact equivalent to the four-color theorem 
(see Descartes and Descartes [1968]). 
This equivalent formulation of the four-color problem is little known. In a let-
ter to R. Steinberg, written in October 1978 in Paris, B. Descartes expressed her 
sentiments: "Malheureusement, nous n'avons pas reussi a demontrer la verite de 
l'hypothese celebre des quatre couleurs. Malgre celaje crois que nos resultats sont 
tres interessants. Cependant, je n'ai vu qu'une seule reference ά nos idees dans la

We are grateful to C.A.B. Smith [personal communication in 1990] for bring-
ing this problem and the letter from B. Descartes to our attention. We also thank 
R. Steinberg for giving permission to quote from a private letter. 
Another intriguing reformulation of the four-color theorem due to Kauffman 
[1990], and also based on Whitney's theorem, states that for any two bracketings L 
and/? of a vector cross product expression «i X vi X · ■ · X v„, there exists a solution 
to L — R Φ 0 with each v, G {i,j, k}, the standard unit orthogonal basis of Ä3.

2.3. 
INTERSECTION GRAPHS OF PLANAR SEGMENTS 
Let L be a finite set of finite line segments in the plane. The intersection 
graph of L is the graph whose vertices correspond to the elements of L, 
and xy is an edge of the graph if and only if the two line segments in L 
corresponding to x and y cross (i.e., they intersect and are nonparallel). 
If G is a planar graph, is G isomorphic to the intersection graph of such 
an L consisting of line segments of at most four different slopes? 
■ 
This question was apparently first asked by West [1991b], who remarked that it 
is a particularly ambitious question, since it would imply the four-color theorem, but 
that no counterexample is known. Without loss of generality one may assume that 
each line segment is either vertical, horizontal, or has slope +1 or a for some fixed 
a (this follows by an affine transformation). It is not clear to us if one may further 
assume that a = - 1 without loss of generality. 
It is not even known if every planar graph is the intersection graph of some 
collection of line segments L. This problem was raised by Scheinerman [ 1984] in his 
Ph.D. thesis, where he proved that every outerplanar graph (i.e., a graph with a plane 
embedding so that one of the face boundaries contains all the vertices of the graph) 
is the intersection graph of some L. He also proved that there exists a representation 
of any given planar graph as an intersection graph of pairs of line segments; that is, 
every vertex may correspond not only to one, but also to two line segments. 
Hartman, Newman, and Ziv [ 1991 ] proved that every bipartite planar graph is the 
intersection graph of some L consisting only of vertical and horizontal line segments. 
This was proved by Duchet, Hamidoune, Las Vergnas, and Meyniel [1983] in the 
more restricted case when one side of the bipartition consists only of vertices of 
degree two. 
The following question was asked by Scheinerman [personal communication in 
1993]: If G is a 3-colorable planar graph, is G isomorphic to the intersection graph 
of an L consisting of line segments of at most three different slopes? 
■ 
2.4. RINGEL'S EARTH-MOON PROBLEM 
Consider maps on two spheres (earth and moon), such that each country 
consists of one connected part on each sphere. How few colors f2 do 
we need to color all such maps? (As usual, neighboring countries get 
different colors, and the two parts of each country get the same color.) ■ 
This problem is due to Ringel [1959], who remarked that 8 =s f2 ^ 12. As 
reported by Gardner [1980] and by Ringel [1985], T. Sulanke proved in 1974 that in 
fact9</ 2. 
The dual formulation of the problem asks for the maximum chromatic number 
of graphs of thickness 2. The thickness of a graph G is defined to be the smallest 

Ore and Plummer's Cyclic Chromatic Number 
37 
number of planar graphs whose union is G. Let /, denote the maximum chromatic 
number of graphs of thickness t. Then f\ = 4 is the four-color theorem. Sulanke's 
graph showing 9 s / 2 consists of a 5-cycle completely joined to a K6. This graph is 
9-chromatic and of thickness 2. 
Since a graph G of thickness t has at most (3i · \V(G)\ - 6t) edges and thus 
a vertex of degree at most 6r — 1, it follows (like the six-color theorem for planar 
graphs) that /, :£ 6/. The thickness t(Kp) of the complete graph Kp is [(p + 7)/6j, 
except that f(^9) = ?(ΑΊ0) = 3. This was shown in a series of papers by, among 
others, Beineke and Harary [1965], Mayer [1972], Alekseev and Gonchakov [1976], 
and Vasak [1976] (see the survey by White and Beineke [1978]). This gives 
6f - 2 < /, < 6t 
for t > 3. 
Ringel [1985] remarked that surprisingly this is a little tighter than the known bounds 
for/2. 
■ 
2.5. 
ORE AND PLUMMER'S CYCLIC CHROMATIC NUMBER 
The cyclic chromatic number xc(G) of a 2-connected plane graph G is the 
minimum number of colors in an assignment of colors to the vertices of 
G such that for every face-bounding cycle F of G the vertices of F have 
different colors. Obviously A*(G) ^ xc(G), where A*(G) is the size of 
a largest face. 
I s x c ( G ) < f - A * ( G ) ? 
If G is 3-connected, is *f(G) < A*(G) + 2? 
■ 
The cyclic chromatic number was introduced by Ore and Plummer [1969]. They 
were motivated by the dual problem of coloring maps such that countries with a 
common border line or a common border point get different colors. Ore and Plummer 
[1969] proved that xc(G) < 2 · A*(G). Borodin [1992a] improved the bound to 
XC(G) < 2 · A*(G) - 3 for A*(G) > 8. The conjecture *C(G) s § · A*(G) was 
implicitly stated by Borodin [1984]. 
Restricting attention to 3-connected planar graphs G, Plummer and Toft [1987] 
proved that xc(G) ^ A*(G) + 9 and, among other similar results, that xc(G) ^ 
Δ *(G) + 4 if Δ (G) ^ 42. They noted that the prism graph and subdivisions thereof 
would show the bounds suggested above to be best possible. O.V. Borodin [personal 
communication in 1987] proved among other results that the inequality xt(G) s 
A*(G) + 3 holds whenever A*(G) > 24 (Borodin [1990c]). 
ForA*(G) = 3 the statement xc(G) ^ 4 is the four-color theorem. For A*(G) = 
4, a theorem of Borodin [1984, 1985, 1989c], proving a conjecture of Ringel [1965] 
on 1-embeddable graphs, implies that xc(G) < 6 (see also Problem 2.14). 
For A*(G) = 5 and G 3-regular, the problem has also been attacked by Borodin 
[personal communication in 1993], who found (but did not publish) a complicated 

38 
Planar Graphs 
sketch of an argument that in this case xc(G) =£ 7. If correct, this implies that the 
square of a 3-regular planar graph G with Δ *(G) = 5 is 7-colorable, that is, G can be 
7-colored such that any two vertices of distance at most 2 are colored differently. This 
would give a partial answer to a question asked by Wegner [1977], if every 3-regular 
planar graph has such a 7-coloring (see Problem 2.18). 
■ 
2.6. VERTEX PARTITIONINGS W.R.T. COLORING NUMBER 
Let G be a planar graph. Is it possible to partition the vertex set into two 
classes V\ and V2 such that 
(a) Vi is independent, and 
(b) every subgraph of the graph induced by V2 has minimum degree at 
most 3? 
■ 
This possible generalization of the five-color theorem is due to Borodin [ 1976a]. 
A graph G, every subgraph of which has minimum degree at most d, is said to be 
if-degenerate and to have coloring number at most d + 1, that is, 
col(G) = 1 + max min (d(x,H)). 
HQG x£V(H) 
It is easy to see (by a straightforward induction argument, or by coloring G sequen-
tially, or from a critical subgraph of G) that x(G) < col(G). 
An (i|,/2 
i'm)-partition of G is a partitioning of the vertex set of G into 
m parts V\, V2, · · ·. Vm such that the induced subgraph G[Vj] has coloring number 
col(G[V/]) s ij for every j = l,2,...,m. 
Thus the problem asks for (1,4)-partitions 
of all planar graphs. Since, by an application of Euler's formula, every planar graph 
has coloring number at most 6, it is easy to show by an inductive argument that G 
has an (i\, i2,..., z'm)-partition if X l s j £ m ij ^ 6. In particular, every planar graph has 
a (3,3)-partition. In fact, Chartrand, Geller, and Hedetniemi [1971] observed that it 
has a partitioning of the vertex set into two classes V] and V2 such that the subgraphs 
induced by Vi and V2 are outerplanar graphs. (A graph is called outerplanar if it can be 
embedded in the plane with all its vertices on the outer face boundary. The outerplanar 
graphs form a proper subset of the set of planar graphs of coloring number at most 
3.) It is much more difficult to obtain a partitioning of the edge set of a planar graph 
into two sets E\ and E2 such that G, = (V(G), £,) for each i - 1,2 is outerplanar, but 
this has recently been achieved by Heath [1991]. 
The existence of a partitioning of the edge set of a planar graph into three 
sets such that the corresponding subgraphs G, (/' = 1,2,3) are acyclic follows from 
the result of J. Edmonds mentioned in Section 1.4. In fact, it follows that there 
exists a partitioning of the edge set into six sets such that each corresponding graph 
G, (i = 1,2,..., 6) is acyclic and has no path of length 3 (i.e., it is a "star forest"). In 
this statement, "six" can be reduced to "five" by a result of O.V. Borodin (Theorem 8 
in Chapter 1). This was observed by S.L. Hakimi, J. Mitchem, and E.E Schmeichel 

Vertex Partitionings w.r.t. Coloring Number 
39 
[personal communication from N. Alon in 1994], thus answering a question posed 
by Algor and Alon [1989], who proved that "five" is best possible. 
Borodin [1976a] conjectured, similarly to the above, that every planar graph has 
a (2,3)-partition (i.e., a partition of the vertex set into two classes V\ and V2 such 
that the subgraph G\ induced by V\ is a forest, and every subgraph of the graph G2 
induced by V2 has minimum degree at most 2). This conjecture was recently proved 
by Thomassen [1993d]. Thomassen [personal communication in 1993] expected that 
a solution to the (1,4)-partition problem might also be obtainable by similar methods. 
More generally, Borodin [1979a] conjectured that a planar graph G has a 5-
coloring such that the union of k arbitrary color classes, k < 4, induces a subgraph 
of coloring number at most k. In the same paper Borodin proved the existence of a 
5-coloring in which any two color classes together induce an acyclic subgraph (i.e., a 
forest, i.e., a subgraph of coloring number at most 2). This result was conjectured by 
Grünbaum [ 1973], who proved that every planar graph has such an acyclic 9-coloring. 
The number 9 was improved to 8 by Mitchem [1974], to 7 by Albertson and Berman 
[1976,1977], to 6 by Kostochka [1976], and finally, to Grünbaum's conjectured value 
5 by Borodin [1976b, 1979a, 1993a] (Theorem 8 in Chapter 1). Borodin's proof was 
a major achievement—being somewhat similar to the known proofs of the four-color 
theorem it involves around 450 reducible configurations, and it took several years to 
complete [personal communication in 1993]. The corollary that every planar graph 
has a (l,2,2)-partition (i.e., a partition into an independent set and two forests) was 
first obtained by Stein [1970, 1971]. 
Attempts at generalizing the four-color problem along these lines have been un-
successful. Planar graphs do not in general have (l,3)-partitions, as can for example 
be demonstrated from the graph of the icosahedron, a 5-regular triangulation. Fur-
thermore, Chartrand and Kronk [1969] gave an example of a planar graph G without 
a (2,2)-partition. The dual G* of G is the famous non-Hamiltonian 3-regular planar 
graph discovered by Tutte [1946]. Indeed, Stein [1970, 1971] made the striking ob-
servation that a plane triangulation G has a (2,2)-partition if and only if the dual G* 
has a Hamilton cycle. Finally, Wegner [1973] produced an example of a planar graph 
G such that every pair of different colors in any 4-coloring of G induces at least one 
cycle, and hence G has no (l,l,2)-partition. A conjecture by Grünbaum [1973] that 
a triangle-free planar graph has a 4-coloring in which any two color classes together 
induce an acyclic subgraph, was disproved by Kostochka and Melnikov [1976]. 
A weaker question than asking for a (2,2)-partition of a planar graph is the 
following, asked by Albertson and Berman [ 1979]: Does every planar graph G contain 
an induced forest on at least |V(G)|/2 vertices? The theorem of Borodin [1976b, 
1979a] implies an induced forest on at least 2\V(G)\/5 vertices. A classical weaker 
question was posed independently by Vizing [1968] and by P. Erdös (see Bondy and 
Murty [1976]): If G is planar, is it then true that G contains an independent set of 
I V(G)|/4 vertices? The affirmative answer follows from the four-color theorem, but 
no direct proof seems to be known. Albertson [1976] proved, independently of the 
four-color theorem, the similar statement with |V(G)|/4 replaced by 2|V(G)|/9. 
A 1-embeddable graph, which can be drawn in the plane such that every edge is 
crossed by at most one other edge, is 6-colorable, as proved by Borodin [1984, 1985, 
1989c]. Borodin [personal communication in 1993] made the suggestion that perhaps 

40 
Planar Graphs 
it is possible to strengthen this result by showing that every 1-embeddable graph has 
a (2,2,2)-partition. Archdeacon [1983] conjectured that every 1-embeddable graph 
has a partition of its vertex set into two sets V\ and V2 such that V\ induces a forest 
and V2 induces a planar graph.

2.7. VERTEX PARTITIONINGS W.R.T. MAXIMUM DEGREE 
Let G be a planar graph, and let Am(G) denote the smallest possi-
ble value of the sum A(G[V|]) + A(G[V2]) + · · ■ + A(G[VJ), where 
(Vi, V2,..., Vm) is a partitioning of the vertex set of G and A(G[V,·]) 
denotes the maximum degree of the induced subgraph G[V,·] for / = 
1,2,... ,m. 
What is the best possible upper bound/2(Δ) on A2(G) as a function of the 
maximum degree Δ of G? What is the best possible upper bound /3(Δ) 
onA3(G)? 
■ 
These two questions generalize a question asked by O.V. Borodin [personal 
communication in 1993] on determining the value of ΗΙΤΙΛ—=ο/3(Δ), shown to be less 
than or equal to 6 by a result of Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall [1986]. However, as 
pointed out by P. Mihok [personal communication in 1993], examples (see below) 
found by Broere and Mynhardt [ 1985b] show that the number 6 is, in fact, the right 
answer to Borodin's original question. 
For partitioning into classes Vi and K2 there is no upper bound on A(G[Vi]) + 
A(G[V2]), and consequently, /2(Δ) —► °° as Δ —» <». This was proved by Mihok 
[1983b], who gave examples showing /2(Δ) 2: νΔ for infinitely many values of Δ. 
The corresponding questions for partitioning into four or more classes have been 
solved with the four-color theorem, which implies that each class may be chosen as 
an independent set of vertices, hence fm(A) = 0 for all m S: 4. 
A theorem of L. Loväsz (Theorem 38 in Chapter 1) implies that fm(A) s Δ -
m + 1 without assuming planarity. The facts stated above on partitionings of planar 
graphs into three or more parts demonstrate that for planar graphs this bound can be 
greatly improved. 
A closely related partitioning problem was studied by Cowen, Cowen, and 
Woodall [1986] and by Wessel [1988] (see also the comprehensive survey by Woodall 
[1990]). They considered partitions of V{G) into m parts such that each part induces 
a subgraph with maximum degree bounded by a constant k S: 0. Hence G is m-
colorable if and only if G has such a partition with k = 0. Cowen, Cowen, and 
Woodall proved that every planar graph G allows such a partition with (m, k) = (3,2) 
and gave a simple argument, independent of the four-color theorem, to show that G 
always has a partition with (m,k) = (4,1). The former result was improved by Poh 
[1990], who proved a conjecture of Mihok [1983b] and independently of Broere and 
Mynhardt [1985b], that the vertices of G can be partitioned into three parts, each in-
ducing a forest consisting of a union of disjoint paths. (Goddard [1991] also claimed 
to have proved this result, but M. Borowiecki pointed out a flaw in the proof [personal 

The Three-Color Problem 
41 
communication from P. Mihok in 1993].) On the other hand, as shown by Broere and 
Mynhardt [1985b], for any fixed L^2 
there is a planar graph GL such that V(GL) 
cannot be partitioned into three parts, each inducing a subgraph of GL without an 
induced path of length L. For L sufficiently large GL also provides an example of a 
planar graph with ^(GL) = 6. 
W. Wessel [personal communication in 1988] disproved a conjecture by Cowen, 
Cowen, and Woodall [1986], suggesting that every planar graph has a partition of the 
vertex set into three parts, each inducing a union of disjoint paths such that the union 
of any two of these parts induces an outerplanar subgraph (i.e., with an embedding 
in the plane such that all its vertices lie on the boundary of a single face). The 
counterexample by Wessel consists of the graph K4 with each edge (x, y) replaced by 
six internally disjoint (x, y)-paths of length two. 
Goddard [ 1991 ] remarked that it is not known if the vertex set of a planar graph 
can be partitioned into two sets, one inducing a union of disjoint paths, the other induc-
ing an outerplanar graph. This would strengthen the result by Poh [1990] mentioned 
above, since Mihok [1983b] has shown that the vertex set of any outerplanar graph 
can be partitioned into two sets, each inducing a union of disjoint paths. However, 
Thomassen [1993d] proved that the answer to Goddard's question is negative.

2.8. 
THE THREE-COLOR PROBLEM 
Does there exist an extension of Heawood's three-color theorem, that the 
vertices of a plane triangulation can be 3-colored if all degrees are even, 
to a sufficient condition for 3-colorability of a wider class of planar 
graphs? 
■ 
The theorem of Heawood [1898] (Theorem 9 in Chapter 1) gives a necessary and 
sufficient condition for 3-colorability of plane triangulations. A "good characteriza-
tion" in the sense of Edmonds [ 1965b] for 3-colorability of planar graphs in general 
seems beyond hope, because it is an W-complete problem to decide if a planar 
graph, even of maximum degree at most 4, is 3-colorable. This was shown by Garey, 
Johnson, and Stockmeyer [1976] (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1, and for proofs see 
also the book on A^-completeness by Garey and Johnson [1979]). The words "even 
of maximum degree at most 4" above may be misleading. Edwards [1986] proved, 
as conjectured by Welsh and Petford [1985], that for a fixed a > 0 and graphs G in 
which all vertices have degree at least a ■ \V(G)\, the question of 3-colorability is 
solvable in polynomial time. 
Kempe [1879] seemed to suggest the following: For each vertex x of a plane 
graph G, consider the vertices y Φ x so that G contains a face with both x and y 
on its boundary. If the number of such vertices y is even for all x E V(G), is G 
then 3-colorable? That the answer is negative can be seen by examples such as the 
4-chromatic plane graph shown in Figure 1. 
A necessary and sufficient (but not "good") condition for 3-colorability of planar 
graphs was obtained by Krol [1972, 1973]. The easily proved result of Krol says 

42 
Planar Graphs 
Figure 2.1. A 4-chromatic planar graph. For each vertex x, the union of the face boundaries containing x 
contains six other vertices. 
that a planar graph G is 3-colorable if and only if G is a subgraph of some plane 
triangulation with all degrees even. 
It would be very interesting to extend Heawood's result to include the triangle-
free planar graphs. These are 3-colorable by the theorem of Grötzsch [1959] (The-
orem 10 in Chapter 1). By the theorems of Grötzsch and Krol every triangle-free 
planar graph can be embedded in a plane triangulation with all degrees even. Is 
there a simple way to see this directly, thus giving a new simple proof of Grötzsch's 
theorem? 
In contrast, characterizing 2-colorable graphs is easy. A graph G is 2-colorable if 
and only if all its cycles are even, as proved by D. König (Theorem 14 in Chapter 1). 
In particular, a plane graph G is 2-colorable if and only if each face is bounded by an 
even number of edges (counting an edge with the same face on both sides twice as a 
bounding edge for the face). 
Steinberg [1993a, 1993b] gave a thorough survey of the three-color problem. 
■ 
2.9. 
STEINBERG'S THREE-COLOR PROBLEM 
If G is a planar graph without 4-cycles and without 5-cycles, is G then 
3-colorable? 
■ 

Steinberg's Three-Color Problem 
43 
According to Aksionov and Melnikov [1978], this question was posed by 
R. Steinberg in 1975. The question can, of course, also be formulated as follows: If 
G is a 4-critical planar graph, is it then true that G contains a 4-cycle or a 5-cycle? 
A partial result was obtained by Abbott and Zhou [1991a], who showed that 
a 4-critical plane graph must contain a cycle of length 4 or 5 or a face of size k, 
where 6 ^ k ^ 11. They also gave an infinite family of 4-critical planar graphs with 
no cycles of length 4 and six cycles of length 5, and another infinite family without 
cycles of length 5 and only four cycles of length 4. 
O.V. Borodin [personal communications in 1992 and 1993] has proved the in-
teresting result that every plane graph of minimum degree at least three contains two 
triangles with a common edge, or a face of size k, where 4 ^ k ^ 9, or a face of size 
10 bounded by vertices all of degree three. A truncated dodecahedron, obtained from 
the graph of the dodecahedron by replacing each vertex by a triangle, shows that the 
latter case may occur. The result of Borodin implies (e.g., by Gallai's Theorem 17 in 
Chapter 1, or by a short direct argument) that a 4-critical plane graph must contain 
a cycle of length 4 or a face of size k, where 5 ^ k s 9. In particular, every planar 
graph without ^-cycles, where 4 < k < 9, is 3-colorable. This result was obtained 
independently by Sanders and Zhao [1994]. 
Borodin [1994b] proved his result by a simple discharging argument. Let G be 
planar of minimum degree at least 3 and without two triangles with a common edge, 
and fix an embedding of G in the plane. If V and F denote the set of vertices and 
faces, respectively, it follows by Euler's formula that 
£ (/■(*) - 4) = -8 = £ μ(χ), 
jrevuf 
xevuF 
where r(x) is the degree of x if x £ V and the size of x if x £ F,.and where 
μ(χ) = r(x) — 4 is the initial "charge" on x. Define a new charge μ* by modifying 
μ according to the following rules: 
(a) Transfer a charge of - 1 / 3 from every facial triangle to each of the three 
vertices on its boundary. 
(b) Transfer 2/3 from every face of size > 3 to each boundary vertex of degree 
3 contained in a triangular face. 
(c) Transfer 1 /3 from every face of size > 3 to each boundary vertex of degree 
3 not contained in a triangular face. 
(d) Transfer 1 /3 from every face of degree > 3 to each boundary vertex of 
degree 4 contained in two triangular faces. 
(e) Transfer 1/3 from every face of degree > 3 to each boundary vertex of 
degree 4 contained in a nonneighboring triangular face. 
It is clear that μ* satisfies 
£ 
μ*(χ) = X μ(χ) = -8 < 0, 
x&VUF 
xeV\JF 

44 
Planar Graphs 
and it is not hard to check that every x G V U F with μ*(χ) < 0 must be a nontrian-
gular face of G, and moreover x must either be of size at most 9, or of size 10 having 
only boundary vertices of degree 3 each contained in a neighboring triangle. This 
finishes the proof. 
Grötzsch [1959] proved that if G is a planar graph without triangles, then G is 
3-colorable (see Theorem 10 in Chapter 1). 
■ 
2.10. 
GRÜNBAUM AND HAVEL'S THREE-COLOR PROBLEM 
Let G be a planar graph and let d(G) denote the minimal distance between 
two triangles in G, given by the number of edges in a shortest path joining 
two triangles in G. If d(G) is finite, but sufficiently large, say 4 or 5, is G 
then 3-colorable? 
■ 
If d(G) = <*, then there is at most one triangle in each component of G, and 
by the theorem of Grötzsch [1959] (Theorem 10 in Chapter 1) and an extension by 
B. Grünbaum and by Aksionov [1974], G is indeed 3-colorable. Grünbaum [1963] 
asked if d(G) s 1 is sufficient, but this was disproved by Havel [1969]. It is known 
that d(G) < 3 will not do (Aksionov and Melnikov [1978]), and for d(G) = 2 there 
is a 3-connected example of Ma [ 1984] showing this. 
The smallest known examples of 4-chromatic planar graphs with d(G) s 1, 
d(G) & 2 and d(G) ^ 3 have 16, 32, and 44 vertices, respectively. Aksionov and 
Melnikov [1978] conjectured that smaller examples than these graphs do not exist. 
At a conference in Boca Raton in 1986, M.O. Albertson remarked [personal 
communication] that it might be better to look for other conditions on triangles that 
force G to be 3-colorable. Perhaps d{G) is the wrong parameter. Borodin [1993a] has 
expressed that "... one acquires a conviction that the positive solution ofGriinbaum-
Havel' s problem "hardly" exists'.' Borodin [1994c] explained the difficulties encoun-
tered in attempts to solve the problem. 
■ 
2.11. GRÖTZSCH AND SACHS'THREE-COLOR PROBLEM 
Let G be a 4-regular plane graph or multigraph and suppose that G has 
a cycle decomposition 5 (i.e., each edge of G is in exactly one cycle of 
the decomposition) with every pair of adjacent edges on a face always in 
different cycles of 5. Such a graph G arises as a superposition of simple 
closed curves in the plane with tangencies disallowed. 
If the cycles of 5 can be partitioned into four classes, such that two cycles 
in the same class are disjoint, is x(G) S 3 ? 
■ 
Without the condition of S being partitioned into four classes, the question is 
due to H. Grötzsch and was asked by Sachs [1974, 1978] at several conferences. A 

Barnette's Conjecture 
45 
4-chromatic example consisting of five overlapping geometric circles in the plane 
was discovered by Koester [1984, 1985a, 1985b, 1990], who also found a 4-critical 
example consisting of seven overlapping circles. On the other hand, Jaeger [1978] 
proved that x{G) s 3 if the cycles of S can be partitioned into three classes, such that 
two cycles in the same class are disjoint. 
Jaeger [1976b] asked if, without any condition of S being partitionable, G is 
edge-colorable in 4 colors, that is, if x'{G) = 4? This question has been studied by 
Jaeger [1978] and Jaeger and Shank [1981], who among other things proved that if S 
can be partitioned into four classes as described above, then x'(G) = 4, and that the 
corresponding statement with five classes implies the four-color theorem. 
■ 
2.12. 
BARNETTE'S CONJECTURE 
Let G be a simple 3-colorable planar graph. Is it possible to partition the 
vertex set of G into two subsets so that each induces an acyclic subgraph 
ofG? 
■ 
Grünbaum [1970b] mentioned that the following conjecture is due to D. Barnette: 
If G is a 3-connected bipartite 3-regular planar graph, then G has a Hamilton cycle. 
Barnette's conjecture is true if and only if the answer to the question above is 
affirmative. This is a consequence of two theorems: 
Theorem (Krol [1972, 1973]). 
Let G be a simple planar graph. Then G is 3-
colorable if and only if there exists a simple plane triangulation H containing G as 
a subgraph, so that all the vertices ofH have even degrees. 
Theorem (Stein [1970,1971]). 
Let H be a plane triangulation. Then there exists 
a partitioning of the vertex set ofH into two subsets each of which induces a forest if 
and only if the dual H* has a Hamilton cycle. 
We note that for a 3-regular connected plane graph G 
G is 3-connected <=> G is 3-edge-connected » G 
is simple, 
where G* is the plane dual of G. Thus the condition of 3-connectivity in Barnette's 
conjecture corresponds dually to the restriction to simple graphs. 
It is not difficult to find examples which show that the condition of 3-connectivity 
in Barnette's conjecture cannot be omitted. Moreover, Tutte [1946] found an example 
of a 3-connected planar graph without a Hamilton cycle; hence the conjecture is false 
for nonbipartite graphs. Finally, a conjecture of Tutte that the condition of planarity 
can be removed, was disproved by J.D. Horton (see Bondy and Murty [1976]). Bondy 
and Murty [1976] included Barnette's conjecture in their list of open problems in 
graph theory. They remarked that P. Goodey has established its truth for plane graphs 
all of whose faces have size four or six. 

46 
Planar Graphs 
P. Mihok [personal communication in 1993] first pointed out to us that Barnette's 
conjecture is equivalent to a question about coloring planar graphs. He formulated the 
following problem: Does there exist a planar graph G satisfying x(G) = Q(G) — 3? 
Here g(G), the point arboricity of G, denotes the minimum number of colors used in 
a coloring of the vertices of G so that each color class induces an acyclic subgraph. 
The parameter ρ, which is clearly a lower bound for χ, was introduced by Chartrand, 
Kronk, and Wall [1968], who observed that if G is a simple planar graph, then 
ρ ( 0 ^ 3. Hence the answer to the question asked by P. Mihok is negative if and only 
if Barnette's conjecture is true. 
■ 
2.13. LIST-COLORING PLANAR GRAPHS 
Is every 3-colorable planar graph 4-choosable, i.e. for any given assign-
ment of a list of size 4 to every vertex, is it possible to color the graph 
properly so that each vertex receives a color from its own list? 
Does there exist a polynomial algorithm that takes as its input any 2-
connected 3-regular planar graph G and a list of three different colors 
for each edge, and gives as output an edge-coloring of G with each edge 
having received a color from its list? 
■ 
The second question was asked in the excellent survey by Alon [1993], who 
explained that every 3-regular 3-edge-colorable planar graph has list-edge-chromatic 
number χ'( = 3 (see also Section 1.9). The combination of this statement with the 
four-color theorem implies, by the theorem of P.G. Tait (Theorem 26 in Chapter 1), 
that it is always possible to color the edges of G as described. However, a polynomial 
algorithm for finding such a coloring seems unknown. 
It was proved, more generally, by Ellingham and Goddyn [1993] that every d-
regular d-edge-colorable planar multigraph has list-edge-chromatic number χ'( = d, 
thus giving an affirmative answer to a special case of the list-coloring conjecture (see 
Section 1.9). It is not known if an algorithmic proof can be obtained. 
Almost all natural questions for list coloring of vertices of planar graphs have 
been solved, except the first question above, due to T.R. Jensen and M. Stiebitz. 
Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor [1979] characterized the class of all 2-choosable graphs. 
Thomassen [1993e] proved with a very elegant argument that every planar graph 
is 5-choosable, with a proof that can be translated into a simple linear algorithm 
for finding a list coloring. Voigt [1993] showed that not every planar graph is 4-
choosable. Kratochvfl and Tuza [1993] observed that every triangle-free planar graph 
is 4-choosable, and Voigt [ 1994] showed that such graphs are not always 3-choosable. 
Gutner [1994] obtained very strong negative results on the possibility of obtaining 
polynomial algorithms for deciding 3- and 4-choosability of planar graphs, namely 
by proving that the problem of deciding if a given planar graph is 4-choosable is 
MP-hard, and that the problem of deciding if a given triangle-free planar graph is 
3-choosable is also NP-havd (see Garey and Johnson [1979] for an introduction to the 
theory of NP-hard problems). Thomassen [1994] gave an algorithmic proof showing 

Kronk and Mitchem's Entire Chromatic Number 
47 
that a planar graph is 3-choosable if each of its cycles has length at least 5, and 
remarked that this result strengthens the theorem of Grötzsch [1959] (Theorem 10 in 
Chapter 1) without making use of Euler's formula in the proof. 
Alon and Tarsi [1992] proved that every planar bipartite graph is 3-choosable. 
Their proof was based on algebraic methods (see also Section 1.9), and did not 
immediately suggest an efficient algorithm for coloring the vertices of a given bipartite 
planar graph with given lists of size 3. Such an algorithm can be obtained, as noted 
by Alon [1993], by an application of a theorem of M. Richardson (see Problem 13.9). 
In contrast, Gutner [1994] proved that when the lists assigned to the vertices of a 
bipartite planar graph are allowed to have three different lengths 2, 3, and 100, it is 
an NP-hard problem to decide if a coloring exists. 
■ 
2.14. 
KRONK AND MITCHEM'S ENTIRE CHROMATIC 
NUMBER 
The entire chromatic number ^En(G) of a plane multigraph G is the 
minimum number of colors in a coloring of the vertices, edges, and faces 
of G, where incident or adjacent elements are colored differently (two 
faces touching only in a vertex may be colored the same, and likewise 
a face and an edge touching in only one vertex). Is XEa{G) ^ A(G) + 4, 
where A(G) denotes the maximum degree of G? 
■ 
An affirmative answer was conjectured by Kronk and Mitchem [1972b, 1973]. 
Izbicki [1968] reported that M. Neuberger proved the conjecture for 3-regular graphs, 
assuming the truth of the four-color theorem. Kronk and Mitchem proved this without 
using the four-color theorem. Hence every 3-regular plane graph has an entire coloring 
using seven colors. 
For Δ sufficiently large, Borodin [1987, 1988, 1992c, 1993b] has shown in a 
series of papers that the answer is affirmative. Summing up the results, Borodin 
proved *En(G) =£ Δ ( 0 + 4 if A(G) > 7, and moreover χΕη(β) < A(G) + 2 when 
Δ ( 0 ^ 12. The latter bound is best possible, as shown by the example of the 
complete bipartite graph K\n—but it is not known if the bound for Δ < 11 can 
be improved. For 2-connected G, Borodin [personal communication in 1993] has 
obtained *En(G) < A(G) + 1 if A(G) > 20. From the results stated above it follows 
that Kronk and Mitchem's conjecture has been solved except for Δ(ο) = 4,5, or 6. 
The first consideration of a problem of this type is due to Ringel [1965], who 
considered simultaneous colorings of vertices and faces (not edges). Ringel's six-
color conjecture, that every planar graph can be thus 6-colored, was proved by 
Borodin [1984, 1985,1989c]. This follows from the theorem that every graph which 
is 1-embeddable in the plane (i.e., embeddable such that every edge is crossed by at 
most one other edge) is vertex 6-colorable in the usual sense. Ringel [ 1965] proved the 
case when G is 3-regular. Archdeacon [1983] proved the case when G is triangle-free, 
and he also proved a five-color theorem for bipartite G. 
Melnikov [1975] conjectured that the edges and faces of G can be colored with 
A(G) + 3 colors so that no pair of incident or adjacent elements receive the same 

48 
Planar Graphs 
color. Borodin [1994d] proved that if A(G) s 10, then A(G) + 1 colors suffice for 
such a coloring. Melnikov's conjecture remains open for A(G) ^ 7. 
■ 
2.15. 
NINE-COLOR CONJECTURE 
Let G be a 3-regular plane graph. Is it possible to color the faces of G 
with nine colors in such a fashion that for each edge e of G all (four or 
fewer) faces incident with the ends of e have pairwise different colors? ■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative is due to Bouchet, Fouquet, Jolivet, 
and Riviere [1987], who proved that twelve colors are sufficient. They also conjec-
tured that only seven colors are needed if G is a 3-regular bipartite planar graph (i.e., 
if G can be face-colored using three colors, see Theorem 9 in Chapter 1). 
Borodin [ 1990a] improved the upper bound on the number of colors to eleven. He 
considered the dual problem of what he termed "diagonal coloring" of the vertices in 
a plane triangulation. Borodin [personal communication in 1993] has expressed that 
a bound of ten colors seems attainable using similar techniques. Bouchet, Fouquet, 
Jolivet, and Riviere [1987] and Borodin [1992b] also considered the generalization 
of this problem to other surfaces. 
■ 
2.16. 
UNIQUELY COLORABLE GRAPHS 
A ^-chromatic graph G with exactly one &-coloring, that is, any two k-
colorings induce the same partition of the vertex set, is called uniquely 
^-colorable. Is it possible to give a structural characterization of the 
uniquely 3-colorable and 4-colorable planar graphs? Can these classes be 
recognized by polynomial algorithms? 
■ 
Uniquely colorable graphs were introduced and studied by Cartwright and Harary 
[1968] and Harary, Hedetniemi, and Robinson [1969], and the planar kind by Char-
trand and Geller [1969], who proved that a uniquely 3-colorable planar graph has at 
least two triangles, and that a uniquely 4-colorable planar graph is a triangulation. 
A class C of uniquely 4-colorable planar graphs can be obtained from the complete 
graph K4 by repeatedly inserting new vertices of degree 3 in triangular faces. Does C 
contain all the uniquely 4-colorable planar graphs? Tutte [1976] mentioned a stronger 
conjecture by R. Cantoni according to which the graphs in C are precisely the duals 
of the 3-regular planar graphs with exactly three Hamilton cycles. By the result on 
uniquely 4-colorable planar graphs of Chartrand and Geller [1969] mentioned above, 
and by the classical arguments of RG. Tait (see Theorem 26 in Chapter 1), the dual of 
a uniquely 4-colorable planar graph is a uniquely 3-edge-colorable 3-regular planar 
graph. It is not hard to see that every uniquely 3-edge-colorable 3-regular graph has 
exactly three Hamilton cycles, since the union of any two color classes must form 

Density of 4-Critical Planar Graphs 
49 
such a cycle. Hence Cantoni's conjecture would imply that a 3-regular planar graph 
G is uniquely 3-edge-colorable if and only if G has exactly three Hamilton cycles. 
Is there some way to prove this weaker statement directly? Thomason [1982] gave 
examples to show that the condition of planarity cannot be removed. 
Uniquely k-colorable graphs in general were studied by among others Nesetiil 
[ 1972], Osterweil [ 1974], and Bollobäs [ 1978b]. The existence of uniquely it-colorable 
graphs without short cycles was obtained by Nesetril [1973], E. Artzy and Erdös 
[1974], and Bollobäs and Sauer [1976]. A more general existence theorem was ob-
tained by Müller [ 1975,1979] (see Problem 17.13 for a formulation of this interesting 
result).

where the range of G is the set of all 4-critical planar graphs? 
■ 
G.A. Dirac and Gallai [1964] asked the question about L and conjectured that 
the answer is L = 2. Moreover, they made a stronger conjecture, saying that if G is a 
4-critical planar graph, then \E(G)\ s 2 · \V(G)\ - 2, thus strengthening a conjecture 
of G.A. Dirac that G must contain at least two vertices of degree 3. The minimum 
degree of G is at least 3, since G is 4-critical. Hence if G satisfies the conjectured 
inequality, it follows that G must contain at least four vertices of degree 3. 
Counterexamples to these conjectures were produced by Koester [1985a, 1985b, 
1990], who found examples of 4-regular 4-critical planar graphs. Such graphs G 
satisfy \E(G)\ = 2 ■ |V(G)|, and the smallest known example has 80 edges and 40 
vertices. Abbott and Zhou [ 1991 b] proved that examples exist for all | V(G) | & 40 for 
which | V(G)\ is congruent to 1 modulo 3, and they asked if any examples exist where 
\V(G)\ is not congruent to 1 modulo 3. Grünbaum [1988] used Koester's graph in a 
construction to prove that L > 79/39. He also proved that L = supG \E(G)\/\V(G)\ 
(taken over all 4-critical planar graphs G), and \E(G)\/\V(G)\ < L for any 4-critical 
planar graph G. The lower bound has been improved to L s 39/19 by Koester 
[1991] and independently Abbott and Zhou [1991b]. Koester [1991] also proved 
the upper bound L < 5/2. Combining the results of Grünbaum and Koester gives 
the inequality 2|£(G)| < 5| V(G)| for all 4-critical planar graphs G. It follows that G 
contains a vertex of degree 3 or 4, a result shown independently by Abbott, Katchalski, 
and Zhou [to appear]. 
Families of 4-critical planar graphs with a low density of edges can be found by 
repeated applications of the construction of G. Hajos (see Theorem 18 in Chapter 1). 
For any fixed number n s 4, except n = 5, the construction gives a 4-critical planar

graph G with \V(G)\ = n and 
\E(G)\ =

for n = 0 (mod 3) 
(5/i - 2)/3 
for n s 1 (mod 3) 
. (5« + 2)/3 
for n = 2 (mod 3), n Φ 5. 
Thus we have / < 5/3; does equality hold? Are the values for \E(G)\ given above 
the best possible? For nonplanar graphs they are not; it is possible to obtain 4-critical 
graphs G with \V(G)\ = n = 2 (mod 3),« > 8 and \E{G)\ = (5n - l)/3, using the 
same construction but starting from a (unique and nonplanar) 4-critical graph with 8 
vertices and 13 edges (see Toft [1974b]). 
The lower bound / & 3/2 is immediate from the condition of 4-criticality. The 
theorem of T. Gallai that a ^-critical noncomplete graph G on n vertices satisfies 
\E(G)\ > (* - l)n + £f-^n 
(Theorem 17 in Chapter 1) provides the slightly better bound / >: 20/13. Can this 
bound be further improved? Note that the bound has been derived without assuming 
planarity of G. 
■ 2.18. SQUARE OF PLANAR GRAPHS 
Can the vertices of a planar graph of maximum degree 3 be colored with 
seven colors such that if two vertices have distance at most 2, then they 
are colored differently? 
■ 
Equivalently, this asks for the chromatic number of the square of a planar graph 
of maximum degree at most 3. 
The problem is due to Wegner [1977], who proved that eight colors are sufficient 
and that seven colors would be the best possible. The problem was brought to 
our attention by O.V. Borodin [personal communication in 1992]. It has also been 
mentioned by Gionfriddo [1986]. 
Borodin [personal communication in 1993] considered the problem for 3-regular 
graphs without faces of size greater than 5. He found, but did not publish, a compli-
cated sketch of an argument proving that the squares of such graphs can always be 
7-colored. If correct, it would also solve, for this restricted class of graphs, a problem 
of Ore and Plummer [1969] on the cyclic chromatic number of plane graphs (i.e., the 
smallest possible number of colors used in a coloring so that two vertices adjacent to 
a common face must receive different colors; see also Problem 2.5). 
We do not know a 3-connected 3-regular planar example that requires seven 
colors; hence one might ask if six colors suffice in this case. Wegner [1977] observed 
that a 3-connected 3-regular planar graph of diameter two has at most six vertices. 
More generally, when asking the same question for graphs of maximum degree Δ,

and he proved that these numbers cannot be replaced by smaller values. 
For larger distances d > 2 the problem was studied by Wegner [1977] in the 
planar case, and it has been studied also for nonplanar graphs by Kramer and Kramer 
[1969a, 1969b] and Kramer [1972]. Kramer and Kramer [1986] more recently con-
sidered the case d = 3 for bipartite 3-regular planar graphs and proved that for this 
problem eight colors are necessary and sufficient (assuming the four-color theorem). 
A variation of the problem has also been studied where it is only required that 
vertices of distance equal to d be colored differently. E. Sampathkumar has presented 
a 5-color theorem and a 4-color conjecture for planar graphs and every odd distance 
d, as reported in Graph Theory Newslett. 6 (No. 3, 1977). A 3-regular purported 
counterexample to the conjecture presented in Graph Theory Newslett. 6 (No. 5, 
1977) can actually be 3-colored. However, we found that the graph of Figure 2 serves 
as a counterexample, since it needs five colors for d = 3. For even distance d, there 
is no bound on the number of colors, as can be shown from subdivisions of complete 
bipartite graphs K\„.

Graphs on Higher Surfaces

3.1. HEAWOOD'S EMPIRE PROBLEM 
Let M be a map on a surface S of Euler characteristic ε, and let each 
country of the map have at most m disjoint connected parts. Heawood 
[1890] proved (compare Theorem 2 in Chapter 1) that the countries of M 
can be colored by at most 
H(e,m) = i · Urn + 1 + ^/(6m + l)2 - 24e) 
colors such that neighboring countries get different colors and all parts 
of the same country get the same color, except possibly in the case ε = 2 
and m = 1 (the four-color problem). For which surfaces S are Η(ε, m) 
colors necessary for some maps on S? 
■ 
The higher surfaces, that is, the compact 2-dimensional manifolds, can be clas-
sified as follows. The sphere with g handles attached Sg has Euler characteris-
tic ε = 2 - 2g. The projective plane with g handles P^ has Euler characteristic 
ε — 1 — 2g, and the Klein bottle with g handles Kg has Euler characteristic ε = —Ig. 
The surfaces Sg are orientable, whereas PÄ and Kg are nonorientable. 
The topological prerequisite for Heawood's formula is that a graph G (with at 
least 3 vertices and without loops and multiple edges) embedded on S satisfies 
\E(G)\ < 3 · |V(G)| - 3 · e(S) 
where E(G) and V(G) are the sets of edges and vertices of G, respectively. The 
derivation of Heawood's formula from this can be found in Ringel [1959] and in 
Hutchinson [1993], among others. 
For the sphere (ε = 2) with m = 2 and for the torus (ε = 0) with m — 1, 
Heawood [1890] showed by examples that H(2,2) = 12 and H(0,1) = 7 colors are 
necessary for some maps.

Graphs on Higher Surfaces 
By embedding a complete graph of size H(2 - 2g, 1) on Sg for 1 < g < 7, 
Heffter [1891] answered the question affirmatively for these orientable surfaces and 
» i = l . Extracts from the original papers of Heawood and Heffter are contained in 
the excellent book by Biggs, Lloyd, and Wilson [1976]. Still for the case m = 1, 
Dirac [1952b, 1957b] proved for every map on a surface S of Euler characteristic 
e = 0 o r s : S - 2 that if it needs Η(ε, 1) colors, then it must contain Η(ε, 1) mutually 
neighboring countries (Theorem 4 in Chapter 1). The cases ε = 1 and ε = - 1 did 
not yield to Dirac's arithmetic, but these were covered by Albertson and Hutchinson 
[1979]. The idea of such a result and a proof for the torus were both originally due 
to P. Ungar. An embedding of a map with Η(ε, 1) mutually neighboring countries 
is possible for any given surface S of Euler characteristic e < 1, except the Klein 
bottle, by the remarkable theorems of Ringel [1954] and Ringel and Youngs [1968] 
(see Theorem 3 in Chapter 1) for the nonorientable and orientable cases, respectively 
(the excellent monographs by Ringel [1959, 1974] contain expositions of these and 
related results). 
A large number of affirmative answers have been obtained for m > 2 as well. 
These are summarized in Table 3.1. 
As for the case of the torus and m 2 2, a construction by H. Taylor was announced 
by Taylor [1981b], by Jackson and Ringel [1983,1985], and by White [1984], but we 
have not been able to find any literature that describes the result in detail. A research 
problem posed by Taylor [1979] may suggest a feasible idea for obtaining such a 
construction. At any rate, a complete solution for the torus was contained in the more 
general result of Jackson and Ringel [1985].

Grünbaum's 3-Edge-Cotor Conjecture 
61 
As can be seen, there are unsolved problems for m = 2, both in the orientable 
and nonorientable cases, the simplest being S3 and P2, respectively. For m = 3 the 
simplest unsolved cases are S3 and K2. Only a single case is known where the answer 
is not affirmative. For m = 1 Franklin [1934] proved that 6 colors are sufficient to 
color every map on the Klein bottle, whereas //(0,1) = 7. Jackson and Ringel [1985] 
suspected a negative answer for the Klein bottle also for m = 2, but Borodin [1989a] 
showed this not to be so by giving an embedding of ÄT13 as a 2-pire on the Klein 
bottle, thus showing that//(0,2) = 13 colors are needed. 
■ 
3.2. 
GRÜNBAUM'S 3-EDGE-COLOR CONJECTURE 
Is it true for every triangulation (without loops and without multiple 
edges) of an orientable surface that it is possible to label the edges by 
three colors in such a fashion that the edges of each triangle have three 
different colors? 
■ 
An affirmative answer was conjectured by Grünbaum [1969], who remarked that 
the conjecture cannot be generalized to nonorientable surfaces, but that if four colors 
are available, a labeling is possible for all surfaces. This follows, in dual formulation, 
from the theorem of V.G. Vizing (Theorem 29 in Chapter 1) that every simple graph 
G has an edge coloring using A(G) + 1 colors in such a fashion that each vertex is 
incident with edges of different colors. 
The Petersen graph can be embedded on the projective plane such that the projec-
tive dual is a triangulation of the projective plane without a labeling in three colors. 
Hence the natural extension of Grünbaum's conjecture to nonorientable surfaces 
would fail already for the projective plane. 
The Petersen graph also has an embedding on the torus such that the toroidal dual 
is a triangulation without a labeling in three colors. However, this triangulation has 
multiple edges. Grünbaum's conjecture implies that an embedding of a snark on an 
orientable surface has a dual with multiple edges. (A "snark" is a nontrivial 4-edge-
chromatic 3-regular graph, see Isaacs [1975] and Gardner [1976]. Here "nontrivial" 
means without triangles and without edge cuts of fewer than four edges, except three 
edges incident to the same vertex.) Embedding properties of some of the known 
snarks have been studied by Tinsley and Watkins [1985], and by Szekeres [1975], 
who proved that the snarks of Isaacs [1975] are not counterexamples to Grünbaum's 
conjecture. 
For the plane, the equivalent dual of the conjecture says that in a 3-connected 
3-regular plane graph G the edges can be 3-colored in such a fashion that each 
vertex is incident with three edges of three different colors. P.G. Tait (Theorem 26 
in Chapter 1) proved that this statement is equivalent to the existence of a usual 
4-coloring of the regions into which G divides the plane (see the book by Biggs, 
Lloyd, and Wilson [1976]). Since the four-color problem can be reduced to 3-regular 
plane maps, Grünbaum's conjecture for the plane is thus equivalent to the four-color 
theorem.

Graphs on Higher Surfaces

3.3. ALBERTSON'S FOUR-COLOR PROBLEM 
Let S be a surface of Euler characteristic ε. Does there exist a constant, 
M(e), such that for every graph G embeddable on S, all but Μ(ε) of the 
vertices of G can be 4-colored? In particular, if G is toroidal, can all but 
three of the vertices of G be 4-colored? 
■ 
This question was first asked by Albertson [1981], but related questions have 
been considered by, among others, Berman and Paul [1989]. 
Since a graph G on S has at most 3 · \V(G)\ — 3 · ε edges, and hence minimum 
degree at most 6 so long as \V(G)\ > (-6ε), it follows from a smallest last order of 
the vertices and a sequential coloring that all but (-6e) of the vertices of G can be 
7-colored. By a slightly more involved argument using induction and the theorem of 
R.L. Brooks (Theorem 11 in Chapter 1), it can be proved that all but (-9e + 1) of 
the vertices of G can be 6-colored. (Outline of argument: If there is a vertex of degree 
at most 5, then OK by induction. If all degrees are greater than or equal to 6, then 
delete all vertices of degree at least 7 and one vertex from each Κη in the remaining 
graph.) Thus with 4 replaced by 6 the answer to Albertson's problem is affirmative. 
With 4 replaced by 5 the answer is also affirmative. Thomassen [1993b] has shown 
that every graph on S can be 5-colored except for at most 2ι3~2ε vertices. Berman 
and Paul [1992] proved, using the four-color theorem, that every graph embedded on 
Sg, the sphere with g handles, can be (improperly) 5-colored with at most 74g — 36 
edges joining two vertices of the same color. With 4 replaced by 3 the answer is 
negative, since graphs on S can contain arbitrarily many disjoint copies of K4. 
An affirmative answer to Albertson's question immediately implies the four-color 
theorem, since arbitrarily many copies of a hypothetical 5-chromatic planar graph 
would be embeddable on S. Berman and Paul [1992] suggested a weaker version of 
Albertson's question, not directly implying the four-color theorem: For the sphere 
with g handles Sg, is there a number N such that every graph on SÄ has an improper 
4-coloring without a monochromatic tree (i.e., a tree with all its vertices colored 
the same) of more than N vertices? With "tree" replaced by "path" the answer is 
affirmative as shown by Berman and Paul [1989]. 
Albertson and Hutchinson [1978] proved that g · >/2n vertices can always be 
removed from a graph G with n vertices embedded on Sg to leave a planar graph. 
Thus yfln vertices can be removed from a toroidal graph on n vertices to leave a 4-
colorable graph (by the four-color theorem). The result by Albertson and Hutchinson 
[1978] has been improved by Hutchinson and Miller [1987], who showed that g · V2n 
can be replaced by 26 · yfgn. 
It is tempting to suggest that all locally planar graphs on any surface are 4-
colorable (with some suitable definition of locally planar). However, Fisk [1978] 
constructed 5-chromatic graphs that are embeddable on all surfaces except the sphere 
and furthermore seem to satisfy every reasonable local planarity definition (see Al-
bertson and Stromquist [ 1982]). Albertson and Stromquist [ 1982] considered a partic-
ularly natural notion of "local planarity," and they proved that a graph is 5-colorable 
if it can be embedded on the torus in such a way that all its noncontractible cycles 

Improper Colorings 
63 
are long (of length at least 8), a best possible result by Fisk's examples (a cycle 
is "contractible" if its deletion disconnects the surface in such a way that one of 
the resulting components is homeomorphic to a plane disc). Thomassen [1993a] 
characterized all 6-chromatic graphs embeddable on the torus and proved that they 
have noncontractible triangles, thus answering a question asked by Albertson and 
Hutchinson [1980b]. 
Hutchinson [1984] defined "locally planar" to mean that all edges are "short" 
(relative to the dimensions of the surface) and proved that such locally planar 
graphs on any surface are 5-colorable. This result was generalized by Thomassen 
[1993b], who proved that there exists a number «(S) such that every graph 
embedded on S without noncontractible cycles of length at most «(S) can be 5-
colored. Related results were derived by quite elementary techniques by Fisk and 
Mohar[1994]. 
■ 
3.4. IMPROPER COLORINGS 
Let S be a surface of Euler characteristic e. What is the smallest number, 
Κ(ε), such that for all graphs G embeddable on S there is an improper 
3-coloring in which every vertex is adjacent to at most Κ(ε) vertices of 
the same color as itself? 
■ 
The conjecture that such a constant Κ(ε) exists for every s < 2 was made by 
Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall [1986] and proved by Archdeacon [1987], who gave 
the bound 
tf(e)<max{15,[-3e/2]-l}. 
O.V. Borodin [personal communication in 1993] suggested that it might be possible 
to obtain an improvement of this upper bound. Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall [1986] 
proved for the plane, with ε = 2, that the right answer is K(2) = 2. They also 
considered the corresponding question for improper it-colorings in general and proved 
that every graph embedded on a surface S with β < 2 has an improper 4-coloring in 
which every vertex is adjacent to at most max{14,[—4e/3l — 1} vertices of the same 
color. For improper 2-colorings no similar bound exists for any surface. This follows 
from a construction by Mihok [1983b]. 
The result of Cowen, Cowen, and Woodall [1986] mentioned above, together 
with the four-color theorem (see Section 1.2), implies that every plane graph has an 
improper ^-coloring in which every vertex is adjacent to at most d vertices of the 
same color as itself if and only if (k > 3 and d > 2) or (k s 4 and d > 0). Woodall 
[1990] asked as an unsolved problem to find analogous conditions for toroidal graphs 
or graphs embeddable on the projective plane. 
The problem of vertex partitioning a graph on a surface into at most k parts 
with each part inducing a d-degenerate subgraph has been solved by Lick and White 
[1972] and Borodin [1976a].

3.5. 
NUMBER OF 6-CRITICAL GRAPHS 
ON A SURFACE 
Let S be an orientable or nonorientable surface. Is the number of noniso-
morphic 6-critical graphs embeddable on S 
finite? 
■ 
The question was raised by Thomassen [ 1993a], who proved that there are exactly 
four 6-critical graphs on the torus (see Problem 3.6). This answered a question of 
Albertson and Stromquist [1982]. Albertson and Hutchinson [1980b] also studied 
6-chromatic toroidal graphs. 
If G is Ar-critical and embeddable on a surface S of Euler characteristic ε, then 
(since the minimum degree of G is at least k — 1) 
(k - I) · \V(G)\ < 2 · \E(G)\ s 6 ■ \V(G)\ - 6 · ε. 
Thus for k > 8, 
\V(G)\ < -6e/(* - 7). 
Since 8-chromatic graphs can only be embedded on surfaces with ε s —2 by the 
formula of Heawood [1890] (Theorem 2 in Chapter 1), the inequality is only of 
interest for such surfaces. Hence for all k ^ 8 the number of ^-critical graphs on a 
fixed surface with ε ^ - 2 is finite. Coloring problems for higher surfaces are thus 
often of a finite nature. It was Dirac [1956, 1957a] who first noted and used this 
finiteness. 
Mohar [1993] and Thomassen [1993a] independently observed that the number 
of 7-critical graphs on S is finite, arguing as follows: T. Gallai proved that the vertices 
of degree k — 1 in a ^-critical graph induce a subgraph whose blocks are either odd 
cycles or complete graphs (Theorem 17 in Chapter 1). Thus considering an embedding 
of a 7-critical graph different from the complete graph Κη, it cannot have a vertex v 
of degree 6 adjacent to six other vertices of degree 6 so that all the faces incident to 
v are bounded by triangles. However, Mohar and Thomassen noted that every graph 
of minimum degree at least 6 that can be embedded on S and has sufficiently many 
vertices must contain such a vertex v. Mohar [1993] gave the upper bound —60e 
for the number of vertices of a 7-critical graph on a surface of Euler characteristic 
<?< - 1 . 
In fact, the "moreover" part of Gallai's theorem (Theorem 17 in Chapter 1) easily 
implies that a 7-critical graph different from Κη on a surface of Euler characteristic 
£ < — 1 has at most — 69e vertices. 
The result of Mohar [ 1993] and Thomassen [ 1993a] immediately implies that for 
any surface there is a polynomial algorithm to decide for a given graph embeddable 
on the surface if it is 6-colorable. A more direct argument for this, giving a linear 
algorithm, was presented by Edwards [1992]. 

Toroidal Polyhedra 
65 
Constructions by Fisk [1978] (see also Albertson and Stromquist [1982]) show 
that the number of 5-critical graphs on any surface except the sphere is infinite. Fisk's 
examples consist of triangulations of the surface with all vertices of even degree, 
except two adjacent vertices of odd degree, and he showed that no such graph is 
4-colorable.

3.6. 
TOROIDAL POLYHEDRA 
A toroidal polyhedron consists of plane convex polygons joined along 
their edges, without bending or twisting the polygons out of shape, 
such that their union is topologically equivalent to the surface of a 
torus. Can the faces (i.e., the polygons) of a toroidal polyhedron be 
colored with four colors so that two adjacent faces are always colored 
differently? 
■ 
This question was asked by Barnette [1985], who proved with a simple argument 
that six colors suffice, and conjectured that four would also suffice. C. Thomassen 
[personal communication in 1994] has proved a five color theorem by showing that 
no 6-critical graph embeddable on the torus can be realized as a subgraph of the 
dual graph of a toroidal polyhedron, where the vertices of the dual graph correspond 
to the faces of the polyhedron, and the edges to the pairs of adjacent faces. This 
was obtained as an application of a theorem of Thomassen [1993a] that there exist 
precisely four different 6-critical toroidal graphs: the complete graph on 6 vertices 
Afö, the graph on 8 vertices obtained by joining a 5-cycle completely to a ΛΓ3, a 
graph on 9 vertices obtained by applying Hajos' construction (see Section 1.4) to 
two copies of K4 followed by joining the resulting graph completely to a K2, and 
finally a 6-regular graph on 11 vertices described by Albertson and Hutchinson 
[1980b]. 
Without the geometrical restriction on the embedding, there exist maps on the 
torus that require seven colors, as shown by Heawood [1890]. Thus, with the restric-
tion one can do better. 
Croft, Falconer, and Guy [1991] included Barnette's problem as Problem B24 
in their list, and they asked in general for the number of colors needed to color the 
faces of non-convex polyhedra of other topological surfaces. For which surfaces do 
the polyhedra require fewer colors than arbitrary maps? 
Of course, toroidal polyhedra are not convex. For arbitrary convex polyhedra 
four colors always suffice, by the four-color theorem. 
C. Thomassen [personal communication in 1994] has pointed out that it is 
possible to arrange five plane polygons, not all convex, joined along their edges such 
that their union forms part of the surface of a torus, with the five corresponding 
faces pairwise adjacent. Thus for the variation of the problem when the faces are not 
required to be convex, a five-color theorem would be best possible. It is however not 
obvious to us if six colors always suffice in this case.

3.7. POLYNOMIAL COLORING OF EMBEDDED GRAPHS 
Let S be a fixed orientable or nonorientable surface and let k > 0 be a 
fixed number. Does there exist a polynomial algorithm for deciding if a 
given graph embedded on S can be 
fc-colored? 
■ 
The question was asked by Thomassen [1993a], who proved that the answer 
is affirmative for k > 6. The problem is open for k = 4 except on the sphere (see 
Section 1.2), and for k = 5 except on the sphere, the projective plane (Albertson 
and Hutchinson [1979]), and the torus (Thomassen [1993a]). For k = 3 the decision 
problem is W-complete even for the sphere (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1). For 
triangle-free graphs the answer is affirmative for all k ^ 4 [personal communication 
from J. Gimbel in 1994]. The problem of the existence of a polynomial algorithm for 
deciding 3-colorability of triangle-free graphs on a given surface has been studied by 
J. Gimbel and C. Thomassen. It seems open for all surfaces other than the sphere. For 
the sphere the existence follows from Grötzsch's theorem (Theorem 10 in Chapter 1). 
Thomassen [1993a] asked if it is true that only a finite number of 6-critical graphs 
can be embedded on S (Problem 3.5). An affirmative answer to this question would 
imply an affirmative answer to the question above for k = 5. 
It seems slightly more difficult to find polynomial algorithms for A:-coloring a 
graph embedded on S. Appel and Haken [ 1989] first obtained a polynomial algorithm 
for 4-coloring graphs on the sphere, and a quadratic algorithm for this problem was 
obtained by N. Robertson, D.P. Sanders, P.D. Seymour and R. Thomas [personal com-
munication from N. Robertson and P.D. Seymour in 1994]. The proof by Thomassen 
[1993a] leads to a polynomial algorithm for finding a 5-coloring of a graph on the 
torus if such a coloring exists. 
■ 
3.8. SPARSE EMBEDDED GRAPHS 
What is the largest possible chromatic number of a graph that can be 
embedded on a surface S and in which every cycle has length at least 
g? In particular, if G is embedded on the Klein bottle and every cycle 
in G has length at least 5, is G then 3-colorable? Similarly, what is the 
maximum chromatic number of a graph G that can be embedded on a 
surface S and for which the number of triangles in G is bounded by a 
constant tl 
■ 
For graphs embedded on the torus, the question corresponding to the question 
above for graphs embedded on the Klein bottle is due to Kronk and White [1972], 
who proved that the answer for the torus is affirmative with 3 replaced by 4, and also 
with 5 replaced by 6. The answer is negative with 5 replaced by 4, as can be seen from 
the triangle-free 4-chromatic graph by Mycielski [1955]. The similar statements also 
hold for graphs embeddable on the projective plane and the Klein bottle, as proved 
by Woodburn [19891, who asked the 3-colorability question for both these surfaces. 

Ringel's 1-Chromatic Number 
67 
Thomassen [ 1993c] proved that the answer to Kronk and White's question for 
graphs on the torus is affirmative. He also proved that the answer is affirmative for 
graphs on the projective plane. For both surfaces Thomassen [1993c] even allowed 
cycles of length 3 or 4 in the graph, but each such cycle must be noncontractible (i.e., 
it does not bound a region homeomorphic to a plane disc). A similar strengthening for 
the Klein bottle cannot be obtained, since the complete graph K4 has an embedding 
without contractible cycles. A theorem of Kronk [1972] implies that every graph 
embeddable without contractible triangles on the torus or the Klein bottle can be 
4-colored. 
Kronk [1972] studied the chromatic numbers of triangle-free graphs on surfaces 
in general. Some of his results were improved by Cook [1975], in particular sufficient 
conditions for 3-colorability. It has recently been investigated, if every graph that can 
be embedded on the double torus (i.e., the sphere with two handles) and whose cycles 
are all of length at least 6 can be 3-colored. A solution to this problem has recently 
been announced by J. Gimbel [personal communication in 1994], who remarked that 
perhaps the answer is affirmative even with "6" replaced by "5." General results in 
this direction were obtained by Fisk and Mohar [1994]. 
Sherman [1993] investigated the maximum chromatic number x(S, f) of graphs 
with at most / triangles on a surface S. She proved ^(torus, 15) = 5 and ^(double 
torus, 7) = 5. It is easy, from a theorem of G.A. Dirac (Theorem 16 in Chapter 1) 
and Euler's formula, to see that ^(torus, 1) £ 4 (and the 4-chromatic triangle-free 
graph of Mycielski [1955] shows that in fact equality holds). The largest value of / 
for which ^(torus, i) = 4 seems unknown—it is known to be at least 2 and at most 
9. Thomassen [1993a] proved that there are exactly four different 6-critical graphs 
on the torus. An examination of these graphs reveals that a 6-chromatic toridal graph 
has at least 20 triangles. Thus a best possible bound is χ(torus, 19) ^ 5 (the complete 
graph K5 shows that equality holds, and K(, shows ^(torus, 20) > 6). 
Graphs embeddable with all faces even-sided have been studied by Hartsfield and 
Ringel [1989], Youngs [1991], and Hutchinson [1994]. Best possible upper bounds 
for x are known for an infinite number of cases, but not for all. 
The motivation for the results and open problems mentioned above is the theorem 
of H. Grötzsch, and its extension by B. Grünbaum and V. A. Aksionov (see Theorem 10 
in Chapter 1 and the discussion following it), that every planar graph with at most 
three triangles is 3-colorable. 
■ 
3.9. 
RINGEL'S 1-CHROMATIC NUMBER 
The 1 -chromatic number, χΧ (S), of a surface S is the maximum chromatic 
number \(G) for all graphs G 1-embeddable on S (i.e., embeddable on S 
such that no edge is crossed over by more than one other edge). Known 
bounds are: 
X,(S*)^U-(9 + V 6 4S + 1 7)| 
for 
S^h 

68 
Graphs on Higher Surfaces 
and for even x,(Sg), 
*
i ( S g )-|r(
i 3 +v
i 4 4*
+ 2 5)| for g-L 
Are these bounds together best possible? 
■ 
Ringel [1981] proved these Heawood-type bounds and posed the problem also 
for nonorientable surfaces. He gave the following Heawood-type upper bound for a 
nonorientable surface Nf/ of Euler characteristic ε = 2 - q{q > 1). 
X,(N,)£|^.(9 + V32^+T7)J, 
where N9 = P(<?_u/2 for q odd and N? = K(<?_2)/2 for q even. 
For the sphere S0 Ringel [1965] proved that 6 < X\(S0) < 7 and Borodin [1984, 
1985, 1989c] proved that Xi(So) = 6. Exact answers are known for a few more 
cases in addition to the sphere: χ, (torus) = χ, (Klein bottle) = 9 and x,(S83) = 41 
are due to Ringel [1981 ], and χ, (projective plane) = 7 is due to Schumacher [1984]. 
Korzhikf 1991] proved the following results: *,(S26) = 25,37 < x,(S75) ^ 39,39 < 
X,(S79) < 40, *,(N247) = 49, and 39 < x,(N1S8) ^ 40. 
Korzhik [1994] obtained the following lower bounds (at the First Estonian Con-
ference on Graphs and Applications, May 1991, dedicated to the 70th birthday of F. 
Harary, Korzhik announced slightly weaker bounds, with the constants 34 replaced 
by 58 and 54, respectively): 
*.<S*) s [\ ■ (9 + V64g + 17)J - 34 
for orientable surfaces, and 
X,(N,)s|j(9 + y327TT7)J-34 
for nonorientable surfaces N9. Thus Ringel's bounds are asymptotically almost best 
possible. Korzhik also announced that the Heawood-type upper bound for nonori-
entable surfaces N, is exact for q = 6,28,66,72,128,200(seeKorzhik[1993,1994]). 
The similarly defined 2-chromatic number, x2(S), was studied by Schumacher 
[1990], who obtained the bound 
X 1(S)£|J.(ll+Vl21-40e)J 
when S has Euler-characteristic ε. He also gave the exact answers χ2 (projective 
plane) = χ2(torus) = χ2 (Klein bottle) = 10and^2(S5) = 16.

3.10. BORODIN'S CONJECTURE ON DIAGONAL COLORING 
Let S be a surface of Euler characteristic ε and G be a graph embedded as 
a triangulation on S (i.e., all the faces of the embedding are triangles). A 
diagonal ^-coloring of G is a coloring of the vertices of G with k colors, 
so that for each edge e of G all (four or fewer) vertices belonging to 
the boundary of one of the two faces incident to e have different colors. 
Let A'diag(S) denote the diagonal chromatic number of S, defined as the 
minimum k for which every triangulation of S has a diagonal ^-coloring. 
Is it true that 
W S ) = \ \ · (13 + V169 - 48s) I 
except if S is the sphere? 
■ 
Borodin [1992b] proved that the right-hand side of this expression gives an 
upper bound for ^diag(S), thus improving an earlier bound obtained by Bouchet, 
Fouquet, Jolivet, and Riviere [1987], and he conjectured that the improved bound is 
best possible. For the torus Si with ε = 0 the answer is affirmative, since Bouchet, 
Fouquet, Jolivet, and Riviere [1987] proved that Xdiag(Si) = 13. 
For the sphere, Bouchet, Fouquet, Jolivet, and Riviere [1987] proved (in a dual 
formulation) that Xdiag(So) — 12 and conjectured that ^diag(So) = 9 (Problem 2.15). 
Borodin [1990a] improved the upper bound to Xdiag(So) — 11 · 
■ 
3.11. ACYCLIC COLORINGS 
A ^-coloring of a graph G is called acyclic if every subgraph of G in-
duced by the union of two color classes is a forest (i.e., without cycles). 
Determine for every surface S the minimum number a(S) such that ev-
ery graph embeddable on S has an acyclic a(S)-coloring. Is a(S) always 
equal to x(S), the maximum chromatic number of graphs embeddable on 
S, except for the sphere and the Klein bottle? 
■ 
Acyclic colorings were defined and studied by Grünbaum [1973], who proved 
that every planar graph has an acyclic 9-coloring. This was improved to 8 by Mitchem 
[1974], to 7 by Albertson and Berman [1976, 1977], to 6 by Kostochka [1976], and 
finally to Grünbaum's conjectured value 5 by Borodin [1976b, 1979a] (Theorem 8 
in Chapter 1). Kostochka and Melnikov [1976] proved that the value 5 cannot be 
improved even for bipartite graphs with coloring number at most 3 (i.e., those in 
which every nonempty subgraph has minimum degree at most 2). 
Albertson and Berman [ 1976], and independently O. V. Borodin, observed that no 
surface was known, except the sphere, for which a(S) is strictly larger than the usual 

70 
Graphs on Higher Surfaces 
chromatic number χ(β). Borodin conjectured that a(S) = #(S), except when S is the 
sphere. However, there is in fact at least one further exception, namely the Klein bottle, 
as noted by Mohar, Robertson, and Sanders [1994]. They observed that the complete 
8-graph K& when removing the edges of three vertex-disjoint paths of lengths 1, 2, 
and 2, respectively, shows that a(Klein bottle) > 7 (whereas ^(Klein bottle) = 6, see 
Theorem 3 in Chapter 1 and the accompanying discussion). Albertson and Berman 
[1976] proved that a(torus) ^ 8, and Mohar, Robertson, and Sanders [1994] that 
a(projective plane) < 7 (but x(torus) = 7 and χ (projective plane) = 6, see Theo-
rem 3 in Chapter 1). More generally, Albertson and Berman [1978] proved that 
a(Sg) s Ag + 4 for the sphere with g handles. This was improved to a(Sg) =£ c · g1^ 
for a positive constant c, with a similar extension to nonorientable surfaces, by Mohar, 
Robertson, and Sanders [1994]. 
■ 
3.12. COCHROMATIC NUMBERS 
The cochromatic number, z(G), of a graph G is the minimum number of 
subsets into which V(G) can be partitioned so that each subset induces 
either an independent set of vertices or a complete graph. Determine z(S), 
the maximum z(G) for graphs G embedded on a surface S. 
■ 
The problem is due to Straight [1979,1980], who determined the answers for the 
sphere [z(S0) = 4],theprojectiveplane[z(P0) = 5], the Klein bottle [z(Ko) = 6], the 
projective plane with one handle [z(P0 = 6], and the Klein bottle with one handle 
[ζ(Κ,) = 7]. Straight [1979] conjectured for the torus Si that z(S,) = 5. This was 
proved by Thomassen [1993b], who moreover proved that a coloring with five colors 
can always be chosen such that at most one color class consists of a complete graph. 
Straight [1979] conjectured more generally that z(S) equals the maximum n for which 
the disjoint union of K\, K2, K3,..., Kn is embeddable on S, and he observed that this 
number is certainly a lower bound for z(S). This conjecture was disproved by Gimbel 
[1986]. 
Recently, z(S) has been studied by J. Gimbel and C. Thomassen [personal com-
munication in 1994]. See also Problem 17.3 for more information on cochromatic 
numbers.

3.13. GRAPHS ON PSEUDO-SURFACES 
The pseudo-surface S(0; n, 2) is obtained from the sphere S0 by iden-
tifying pairs of points *, and y, for / = 1,2,..., n, where xux2,-.., 
x„, 
yi,y2 
yn are all distinct. With pairs replaced by triples, one obtains 
the pseudo-surface S(0; n, 3), and so on. With S0 replaced by the sphere 
with g handles Sg one obtains the pseudo-surface S(g; n, 2), and so on. 
What are the maximum chromatic numbers for graphs embeddable on 
such pseudo-surfaces? 
■ 

Graphs on Pseudo-Surfaces 
71 
This problem for S(0; n, 2) was introduced and studied by Dewdney [1972] and 
mentioned by White [1973]. When a graph is embedded on a pseudo-surface it is 
normally assumed, as Dewdney [1972] did, that the singular points on the surface 
cannot be interior points on curves representing edges. Hence if the embedding 
of a graph G contains one of the singular points, then it is a vertex of G. With 
this understanding, the maximum chromatic number χ* for graphs embeddable on 
S(0; n, 2) was determined by Borodin and Melnikov [1974] (see also White [1984]). 
This can be done using standard arguments and splitting results proved by Borodin 
and Melnikov [1974] and independently by Hartsfield, Jackson, and Ringel [1985]. 
Dewdney [1972] observed that the bound X* — 4 + n always holds, and that 
it holds with equality for n = 1,2. White [1978] reported that M. O'Bryan and 
J. Williamson in 1973 proved equality also for n = 3,4. Supposing that equality 
holds in χ* ^ 9, a 9-critical graph G on S(0; 5,2) satisfies 
8 · \V(G)\ < 2 · \E(G)\ < 6 · (|V(G)| + 5) - 12 
because the minimum degree is at least 8 and G can be made planar by splitting 
at most 5 vertices. Hence \V(G)\ s 9 and G = K9. But it is known that K9 needs 
6 splittings of vertices to become planar. Thus χ* ^ 8 and, in fact, K% embeds on 
S(0; 5,2), hence χ* = 8. More generally, a ^-critical graph on S(0; n, 2) satisfies 
(*-l)-|V(G)|£6-(|V(G)| + » ) - 1 2 . 
Hence for k > 7, 
(k - 7) · * < 6n - 12, 
implying that 
* = S J J - ( 7 + >/1+24B)J. 
(*) 
The right-hand side of (*) gives χ* for 6 < n < 12, as can be deduced from the 
splitting results of Borodin and Melnikov [1974] and Hartsfield, Jackson, and Ringel 
[1985]. [A.K. Dewdney, in Math. Reviews 54 (#5031) 1977, reported that T. Sulanke 
obtained this result independently.] An interesting case is χ*2 = 12, where (*) gives 
χη s 12, and an example of Heawood [1890] of a planar map with 12 mutually 
neighboring countries each with two parts gives χ*2 ~Si 12. In a fc-critical graph with 
k s 13 each vertex has degree at least 12, and hence the splitting of some vertices into 
pairs of new vertices gives a graph of average degree at least 6 and thus a nonplanar 
graph. Therefore, χ* = 12 for all « > 12. 
A variation is to look for the maximum chromatic number of graphs embeddable 
on at least one surface obtained from the sphere by successively identifying n pairs of 
points, not necessarily distinct (i.e., points to be identified may themselves have been 
obtained by earlier identifications). The results of Hartsfield, Jackson, and Ringel 

72 
Graphs on Higher Surfaces 
[1985] show this number for n > 6 to be the right-hand side of (*). For n < 5 the 
number is equal to χ*. 
Another variation is the case where edges of embedded graphs may pass through 
singular points. Let for this case the maximum chromatic number for graphs embed-
dable on S(0; n, 2) be denoted by χ**. Clearly, χ** > χ* holds for all n, and equality 
holds for n < 12. For n > 13, (*) remains an upper bound; an improved bound can, 
however, be obtained as follows. Let G be embedded as described; then 
(* - 1) · \V{G)\ < 6 · (\V(G)\ + Sl) - 12 + 2s2, 
where s, is the number of vertices of G situated in singular points and .?2 the number of 
edges passing through singular points. Note that a planar graph can be obtained from 
G by deleting s2 edges and splitting each of s\ vertices into a pair of new vertices. 
Thus 
(* - 1) · |V(G)| < 6 · |V(G)| + 4s, - 12 + 2 · (s, + s2) 
< 10 ■ |V(G)| - 12 + In, 
and therefore for k ä 11, 
( * - 11)·*< -12 + 2/j, 
implying 
k<\ i ( l l +V73 + 8n)|. 
(**) 
Borodin and Melnikov [1974] have shown that (**) gives the correct value of χη 
for all n s 12. From the derivation above the same conclusion follows for a surface 
obtained from the sphere by successive identification of n not necessarily distinct pairs 
of points. Borodin and Melnikov furthermore considered the similar problem, with n 
distinct pairs, for higher orientable or nonorientable surfaces and proved that for any 
fixed S, the corresponding Heawood-type bound is the best possible, provided that n 
is sufficiently large, depending on S (see also Borodin [1989a]). Splitting results of 
Hartsfield [1986] become relevant for coloring problems on pseudo-surfaces obtained 
by identifying pairs of points on the torus. 
For pairs of points on the sphere it appears that all the natural variations of 
the problem have been solved. With triples of points identified instead of pairs the 
problem seems only sparsely studied. As noted by Kainen [1972], it follows from the 
föur-color theorem that the maximum chromatic number of graphs embeddable on a 
pseudo-surface S(0; 1, /) for t > 2 is equal to 5. 
For a given S(g; n, t) and a given k, one may ask if there exists a polynomial 
algorithm to decide £-colorability of graphs embeddable on S(g; n, /). In particular, 
the cases g = 0 and k — 4,5 seem interesting. A positive answer for g < g0, with 
t = 2 and k = 5 would seem to provide (by arguments of Thomassen [1993b]) a 

Bibliography 
73 
positive answer to a question by Thomassen [1993a]: Does there exist a polynomial 
algorithm to decide 5-colorability of graphs embeddable on Sg0? 
Different types of pseudo-surfaces are the spindle surfaces. A spindle surface 
can be obtained from a graph G by replacing each edge xy of G by a topological 
sphere with x and y as two distinct points. These surfaces were studied by Bodendiek, 
Schumacher, and Wagner [1985], by Schumacher and Wagner [1985], who described 
coloring properties of spindle surfaces, and by Wagner and Bodendiek [1990].

4.1. THE COLORING NUMBER 
The coloring number col(G) of a graph G on n vertices X\,x2,...,x„ 
is 
defined by 
col(G) = mmmaxidiXpui.Grt)) + 1}, 
P 
I 
where the minimum is taken over all permutations p of {1,2,...,«} and 
GP(,) is the subgraph of G induced by xpm,xp(2), ■ ■. ,xP«)· The coloring 
number satisfies 
X(G) < col(G) < A(G) + 1, 
where A(G) is the maximum degree of G. Several questions can be posed, 
among them the following four: 
1. For which graphs G is \(G) = col(G)? 
2. More restrictive: Which graphs satisfy x(G') = col(G') for all induced 
subgraphs G'ofG? 
3. Which graphs are ^-critical with respect to col; that is, for which graphs 
G is col(G') < col(G) = k for all proper subgraphs G' of G? 
4. More restrictive: Which graphs G satisfy col(G') < col(G) = x(G) 
for all proper subgraphs G' of G? 
■ 
The coloring number was first defined (and in particular studied for infinite 
graphs) by Erdös and Hajnal [1966]. For finite graphs of size n the coloring number 
seems at first sight to be a "difficult" parameter because the minimum is taken over 
n\ possible permutations. However, as explained in Theorem 12 and the discussion 
of it in Chapter 1, there is a very simple polynomial algorithm to compute col(G) for

Degrees 
any graph G. This was first discovered by Matula [1968] and independently by Finck 
and Sachs [1969]. 
Moreover, col(G) is equal to the upper bound for the chromatic number given by 
Szekeres and Wilf [1968]: 
SW(G) = max min (d(x,H) + 1). 
HQG xGV(H) 
This fact was proved by Halin [1967] and independently by Matula [1968], by Finck 
and Sachs [1969], and by Lick and White [1970] (Theorem 12 in Chapter 1). Lick and 
White [ 1970] defined a graph G to be ^-degenerate if and only if every subgraph H of 
G has minimum degree at most k. Thus by the results stated above, G is ^-degenerate 
if and only if col(G) ^ k + 1. Simöes-Pereira [1976] gave a survey of ^-degenerate 
graphs. 
The background for question 1 is the theorem of Brooks [1941] (Theorem 11 in 
Chapter 1), characterizing those G for which x(G) = A(G) 4- 1. It is easy to see that 
col(G) = A(G) + 1 if and only if G has a A(G)-regular connected component. Thus 
a characterization of those G for which x(G) = col(G) would provide a substantial 
extension of Brooks' theorem. However, there seems to be so many graphs with 
X(G) = col(G) that no reasonable characterization is possible. Also, it follows from 
a result of Garey, Johnson, and Stockmeyer [1976] that it is an WP-complete problem 
to decide if a given planar graph G with col(G) = 4 satisfies x(G) < 4. This decision 
problem also becomes iVf-complete when "planar graph" is replaced by "line graph"; 
this follows from a result of Holyer [1981]. Thus one cannot expect that it should be 
possible to give a simple characterization of graphs satisfying x(G) = col(G). 
One may perhaps still expect that if further restrictions are added on other 
parameters of G it will be possible to characterize the graphs for which x(G) = col(G). 
A.V. Kostochka investigated the problem when restricting to graphs all of whose 
cycles have length at least g, where g is fixed, and he proved in 19801 that such 
examples exist for all g [personal communication from Kostochka in 1993]. 
Question 2 is due to O.V. Borodin, who posed it in 1978. It is similar in spirit 
to the definition of the perfect graphs of C. Berge (see Section 1.6), but as Borodin 
remarked [personal communication in 1985] it seems a simpler concept: Berge's 
perfect graphs are defined in terms of two "difficult" graph parameters ω and χ, 
whereas Borodin's perfect graphs are defined in terms of one "difficult" (χ) and one 
"easy" (col) parameter. 
A graph G as in question 2 was called "ω-perfect" by Gasparyan and Markosyan 
[1990] (see also Reed [1990]), who noted that clearly, no such graph contains an 
even cycle as an induced subgraph, and they proved that if G is not ω-perfect, then 
G contains an even cycle or an even cycle with exactly one diagonal as an induced 
subgraph. They pointed out that the situation for ω-perfect graphs is in some sense 
more complicated than for Berge's perfect graphs; the complement of an ω-perfect 
graph is not always ω-perfect. However, they proved that G and G's complement 
1 Kostochka published this in a paper distributed by the Russian Academy of Sciences in Novosibirsk, but 
it is not generally accessible. 

Coloring of Decomposable Graphs 
79 
G are both ω-perfect if and only if neither G nor G contains an even cycle as an 
induced subgraph. In comparison, the strong perfect graph conjecture of C. Berge 
(Section 1.6) suggests that G is perfect (in Berge's sense) if and only if neither G nor 
G contains an odd cycle of length at least 5 as an induced subgraph. 
Christen and Selkow [1979] characterized other classes of "perfect" graphs 
defined similarly in terms of (a) χ and Γ, (b) ω and Γ, (c) χ and φ, and (d) ω and 
ψ, where ω is the size of a largest complete subgraph, Γ is the Grundy number (see 
Problem 10.4), and ψ is the achromatic number (see Problem 10.5). These numbers 
satisfy ω ^ χ s Γ ^ φ; however, Γ and ψ have no direct relation to the coloring 
number (e.g., a tree has coloring number 2 and can have arbitrarily large Γ, and two 
disjoint 5-cycles completely joined by edges has coloring number 8 and Γ = ψ = 6). 
For question 3, again there seems to be too many graphs that a simple char-
acterization is possible. But of course these graphs are polynomially recognizable. 
Borodin has informed us [personal communication in 1985] that the best character-
ization seems to go along the following lines: G is (k + l)-critical w.r.t. col if and 
only if (i) G is connected, (ii) 5(G) = k, (iii) the vertices of degree at least k + 1 
in G are independent, and (iv) col(G — x) < k for all x of degree k in G. A simi-
lar characterization was given by Mihok [1981b]. Mihok studied (n,k - l)-critical 
graphs. Such a graph G is improperly vertex-colorable in n colors, but not in n - 1 
colors, such that each color class C induces a subgraph G[C] with col(G[C]) s k, but 
every proper subgraph of G is colorable in this fashion in n - 1 colors. Thus Mihok's 
concept "(2,k — l)-critical" is equivalent to the concept "(k + l)-critical w.r.t. col." 
The (n,k - l)-critical graphs were first studied for the case k = 2 by Bollobäs and 
Harary [1975], Kronk and Mitchem [1975], and Mihok [1976, 1981a]. 
Question 4 is due to Borodin, who posed it in 1974. It has been investigated by 
A. V. Kostochka. The graphs in question form a subset of the graphs critical w.r.t. χ. 
Finally a remark on similar questions for list coloring. The list-chromatic number 
Xe(G) satisfies x(G) s xe(G) ^ col(G), hence each of the four problems given above 
may be split into two new problems, by replacing x(G) and col(G), respectively, by 
Xe(G). 
■ 4.2. COLORING OF DECOMPOSABLE GRAPHS 
If the edges of G can be decomposed into two subsets, one inducing a 
subgraph Hi of coloring number at most 2 (i.e., it is a forest), and the 
other inducing a subgraph H2 of coloring number at most 3, can G be 
5-colored? 
■ 
The question is due to M. Tarsi, who conjectured that the answer is affirmative, 
and it appeared in Klein and Schönheim [1991]. The problem is similar in spirit to 
a question of N.W. Sauer raised at the International Conference on Combinatorics 
celebrating P. Erdös' eightieth birthday, held in Keszthely, Hungary, in July 1993: 
If the edge set of G can be partitioned into sets E\ and E2 such that the connected 
components of the subgraph induced by E\ are "stars" (i.e., complete bipartite graphs 

80 
Degrees 
Klm for m S: 1) and the subgraph induced by E2 is a forest, is it true that G is 3-
colorable? Sauer's question was answered affirmatively by Stiebitz [1993]. Stiebitz 
has proved, more generally, that if G is the union of a forest and a bipartite graph B 
with bipartition (R,S), where every vertex in S has degree at most t in B, then G is 
(t + 2)-choosable, that is, Xe(G) < / + 2 [personal communication in 1994]. 
It is easy to find a 6-coloring of G by combining a 2-coloring of //t with a 
3-coloring of H2, since adjacent vertices in G must receive different colors in at 
least one of the two colorings. Asking if a 5-coloring is possible can be considered 
an interesting parallel to the 5-flow conjecture of W.T. Tutte (Problem 13.1). The 
decomposition of G into subgraphs H\ and H2 is dual, in a sense, to a decomposition 
used by P.D. Seymour to prove the 6-flow theorem (Theorem 33 in Chapter 1). 
Seymour proved that the edge set of any bridge-less graph can be partitioned into two 
subsets, one inducing a subgraph with a 2-flow, the other inducing a subgraph with a 
3-flow, and these flows together easily combine into a 6-flow of the union (see also 
the discussion in Problem 13.2). 
A far more general problem was suggested by Klein and Schönheim [ 1991,1993] 
and Klein [ 1992]. G is called (m \, m2,..., mk )-composed if G is the union of k graphs 
H\,H2,...,Hk, 
where W, is m,-degenerate (i.e., has coloring number at most m, + 1) 
for / = 1,2, ...,k, and m\ :£ m2 s · · · < mk. Define 
v(mltm2,...,mk) 
= m{ + m2 + ■ · ■ + mk + - · (l + y 1 + 8 · X ^ / M , / « / ) . 
Klein and Schönheim conjectured that every (m\,m2,..., 
m,t)-composed graph can be 
v(m\, m2,..., m*)-colored. The motivation for this conjecture is a theorem by Klein 
and Schönheim [1991] for k = 2, and by Klein [1992] and Klein and Schönheim 
[1993] for general k, that the complete graph K„ is (/nj, m2,..., m*)-composed if and 
only if n ^ v(m\,m2 
mk). The case (m\,m2) - (1,2) of the latter conjecture is 
the conjecture of Tarsi stated above.

4.3. COLOR-BOUND FAMILIES OF GRAPHS 
Let Q(H) denote the set of all graphs not containing the graph H as an 
induced subgraph. If T is a tree, does there exist some function/r(x) with 
fr(x) —* °° as x —► oo so that 
X(G) > /r(col(G)) 
for all 
G G G(T), 
where col(G) is the coloring number of G (i.e., the largest number k so 
that G has a subgraph of minimum degree k — 1)7

The question was asked by P. Mihok [personal communication in 1993]. It was 
inspired by a question raised by Gyärfäs [1975] and independently Sumner [1981] 

Edge-Disjoint Placements 
81 
asking for an upper bound on x(G) for G £ Q{H), expressed as a function of w(G), 
the size of a largest complete subgraph in G (see Problem 8.11). 
Kierstead and Penrice [1990] proved that the answer to the question by Gyärfäs 
and Sumner is affirmative when H is a forest consisting of disjoint trees Ti,T2 
T„, 
if and only if it is affirmative for each tree Γ,. A proof of this was also presented by 
Sauer [1993]. Wagon [1980] had previously obtained this result for the case when 
each tree Γ, is a complete graph K^. The corresponding statement is not true for 
Mihok's problem, since forbidding the graph consisting of three vertices and only 
one edge as an induced subgraph, one obtains the class of all complete multipartite 
graphs, and these can have arbitrarily high coloring numbers for any fixed chromatic 
number. 
For any graph H with at least one cycle, the question corresponding to Mihok's 
for the family of graphs Q{H) has a negative answer, since there exist bipartite graphs 
of arbitrarily high vertex degrees (and hence arbitrarily high coloring number) and 
with shortest cycles of arbitrarily high length. However, it was shown by Gasparyan 
and Markosyan [1990] (see also Reed [1990]) that 
X(G) > 1 + col(G)/2 
holds for any graph G without an induced even cycle. 
If T is a tree with fewer than 4 vertices, the answer is clearly affirmative with

EDGE-DISJOINT PLACEMENTS 
Let G\ and G2 be two graphs both on n vertices, and let A(Gi) and A(G2) 
be their maximum degrees. Is it true that if 
(A(G,) + l)-(A(G 2) + l ) < / i + l, 
then G\ and G2 can be embedded edge-disjointly in the same complete 
n-graph K„l Or equivalently, if the condition is satisfied, is Gx then 
isomorphic to a subgraph of the complement G2 of G2? 
■ 
The problem is due to Bollobäs and Eldridge [1976, 1978] (see also Bollobäs 
[1978c]) and independently to Catlin [1976, 1977]. The problem was studied by 
Catlin [1974, 1976, 1980] and by Sauer and Spencer [1978], who proved that the 
conclusion is true if 
2 · A(Gi) · A(G2) < n 
(the first mention of this result seems to be a footnote in the paper by Catlin [1974]). 
It would be of considerable interest even to improve the factor 2 to a smaller value.

Degrees 
This problem does not have the form of a coloring problem; however, a coloring 
of a graph G can be thought of as an edge-disjoint placement of G and a graph with 
complete connected components. In particular, an affirmative answer would provide a 
very considerable extension of the deep coloring theorem (Theorem 13 in Chapter 1) 
of Hajnal and Szemer&li [1970], as noted by Bollobäs [1978a, 1978c]. The theorem 
of Hajnal and Szemeredi states that a graph G of maximum degree A(G) and with 
\V(G)\ = k ■ (A(G) + 1) has a (A(G) + l)-coloring in which each color class has 
precisely k vertices.

4.5. 
POWERS OF HAMILTON CYCLES 
Let k be a positive integer, and let G be a graph with minimum degree 
8(G) at least k\V(G)\/(k + 1). Does G contain a Mi power of a Hamil-
ton cycle as a subgraph? That is, can the vertices of G be arranged in 
a cyclic order xux2,... 
,x\v(G)\> SO that each xt is adjacent in G to all 
the vertices χί+ι,χι+2,... 
,*,·+* for i — 1,2,..., |V(G)|, adding subscripts 
modulo |V(G)|? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative was made by Seymour [1974b]. The 
case/k = 1 is a classical theorem of Dirac [1952c]: If G Φ K2 and 8(G) > |V(G)|/2, 
then G has a Hamilton cycle. The case k = 2 is an unsolved conjecture due to Posa 
[1963]. 
Posa's conjecture that if G satisfies 8(G) s 2| V(G)|/3 then G contains the square 
of a Hamilton cycle, was studied by Faudree, Gould, Jacobson, and Schelp [1991] and 
by Fan and Häggkvist [1994]. Fan and Kierstead [1993] and J. Quintana [personal 
communication from H.A. Kierstead in 1994], proved the so far strongest known par-
tial results, namely that "> 2|V(G)\/3" can be replaced by "> (17|V(G)| + 9)/24" 
and by "> 7|V(G)|/10 + 2," respectively. Fan [personal communication in 1993] 
reported the following result obtained by Kierstead: For any ε > 0 there is a number 
c(s) such that if 
8(G) s ^ - 
■ \V(G)\ + c(e), 
then G contains the square of a Hamilton cycle. Moreover, Fan and Kierstead [per-
sonal communication in 1994] proved that if G has minimum degree 8(G) at least 
(2|V(G)| - l)/3, then G contains the square of a Hamilton path. 
Seymour's conjecture is not obviously connected to graph coloring. However, 
its truth would extend the theorem of Hajnal and Szemeredi [1970] (Theorem 13 in 
Chapter 1) that every graph G of maximum degree A(G) and with k ■ (A(G) + 1) 
vertices has a (A(G) + 1 )-coloring in which every color class has size k. Consider 
the complement G of such a G with minimum degree 
8(G) = \V(G)\ - 1 - A(G) = ^ 
· \V(G)\.

Brooks' Theorem for Triangle-Free Graphs 
83 
Seymour's conjecture would imply that G contains the (k — 1 )st power of a Hamilton 
cycle C Thus G can be colored by giving any k consecutive vertices on C color 1, 
then the following k consecutive vertices on C color 2, and continuing like this until 
all vertices of G are colored. 
■ 4.6. BROOKS'THEOREM FOR TRIANGLE-FREE GRAPHS 
Find a best possible upper bound for the chromatic number x(G) of a 
graph G in terms of the maximum degree A(G), provided that the graph 
is triangle-free or, more generally, provided that the graph contains no 
Kr+l. 
■ 
This problem is due to Vizing [1968], who after mentioning Brooks' theorem 
said: "Further investigations could be conducted taking into account a more exact 
relation between the maximum degree and the maximum size of a complete subgraph. 
Perhaps one should start with estimates of the chromatic number of a graph without 
triangles and given maximal degree for vertices'.' Another early reference is the paper 
by Grünbaum [1970a]. 
The theorem of Brooks [1941] (Theorem 11 in Chapter 1) states that if 3 ^ A(G) 
and G contains no K^G)+i, then x(G) ^ A(G). Borodin and Kostochka [1977], Catlin 
[1978a], and Lawrence [1978] independently proved that if 3 < r < A(G) and G 
contains no Kr+l, then 
*<G) - 7 T T ' ( Δ ( σ ) + 2)· 
If G is triangle-free it does not contain a K4, and therefore 
X(G) < \ ■ (A(G) + 2). 
Catlin [1978a] remarked: "However, in this case it would be natural to expect that 
the bound can be improved!' For graphs G without 4-cycles, Catlin [1978b] proved 
that 
X(G) < I ■ (A(G) + 3). 
Kostochka [personal communication in 1987] proved in 19782 that this bound is 
indeed true also for triangle- free graphs. It has been proved by J.H. Kim for triangle-

generally accessible.

, ^ „ c · A(G) 
X(G) s -——— 
log A(G) 
for a constant c > 0. It follows from work by Kostochka and Mazurova [1977] that 
this bound is of best possible order of magnitude. They found for any given integer 
Δ > 3 a triangle-free graph G for which A(G) = Δ and 
X(G) > 
Δ 
21ogA 
They in fact proved the much stronger result that such a G exists with any prescribed 
length of a shortest cycle. In contrast, Kostochka [1978a] has shown that for any 
graph G where all cycles are sufficiently long (depending on Δ = A(G)), 
X(G) < | + 2. 
A. Johansson [personal communication in 1994] has suggested that if r > 2 and 
G contains no Kr+,, and if Δ is sufficiently large, then 
X(G) si cir)

where c(r) is a constant depending only on r, and log(''"l) denotes the (r — 1) times

Catlin [1978b] managed to weaken the condition on G and still get good bounds 
on x(G). If r > 3 and G contains no K~+2 (the complete (r + 2)-graph minus one 
edge) as a subgraph, then 
X(G) =£ - ^

GRAPHS WITHOUT LARGE COMPLETE SUBGRAPHS 
Find the best possible lower bound in terms of k for the maximum degree 
A(G) of a Λ-chromatic graph G not containing a Kk- \. 
■ 
The theorem of Brooks [1941] (Theorem 11 in Chapter 1) gives A(G) > k. A 
conjecture of Lawrence [1978], also mentioned by Bollobäs [1978a], suggests the 
bound A(G) a 2k — 5. For 4 < k < 5 this is true by Brooks' theorem. However, for 
k > 8 the conjecture is false, as shown by the counterexamples of Catlin [1979] to 
Hajos' conjecture (see also the paper by Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m and Toft [1981]): If 
G consists of five disjoint copies of Kla+\ arranged in a cycle with neighboring ones 
completely joined, then G has chromatic number 5a + 3, does not contain a ΑΓ4α+3, 
and is (6a + 2)-regular. Thus the factor 2 in Lawrence's conjecture is too large; the 
most one can hope for is 6/5. 
If instead of not containing a Kk-\, one imposes the weaker condition of not 
containing a Kk, then Brooks' bound A(G) > A: is the best possible for 4 < k s 8. 
However, Borodin and Kostochka [1977] conjectured that it can be improved for 
k > 9 (Problem 4.8). 
Mozhan [1983] considered the stronger condition that G should contain no 
complete graph on more than 2 [(A — 1 )/3j + 1 vertices as a subgraph, and he proved 
that for k s 9 this implies that A(G) 2jfc+ 1. Borodin [personal communication in 
1993] has informed us that there exists an unpublished deposited manuscript by 
Mozhan, where it is proved even stronger, that if the largest complete subgraph of G 
has at most k — 29 vertices, the conclusion A(G) > £ + 1 also holds.

Jt-CHROMATIC GRAPHS OF MAXIMUM DEGREE k 
Does there exist a &-chromatic graph without a Kk as a subgraph and of 
maximum degree k for any value of k s 9?

Borodin and Kostochka [1977] posed this problem and conjectured that the 
answer is no. Beutelspacher and Hering [1984] proved that if x(G) = A(G) — k and 
G does not contain a Kk, then |V(G)| a 2k — 1, and they showed that there are 13 
critical graphs for which \V(G)\ = 2k — 1. All of them are 8-colorable, and only 
one has chromatic number equal to 8, namely the 8-chromatic counterexample to 
Hajos' conjecture, due to Catlin [1979], consisting of five disjoint copies of Κτ, in 
cyclic order with neighboring copies completely joined. Beutelspacher and Hering 
thus also (independently) arrived at the question if x(G) = A(G) = k and G 2 Kk 
can occur only for finitely many k.

TOTAL COLORING 
Let G be any graph or multigraph on n vertices. The total chromatic 
number x"(G) is the smallest number of colors needed to color all the 
elements of V(G) U E(G) in such a way that no two adjacent or incident 
elements receive the same color. Let Δ be the maximum degree of G. If 
G is simple, does 
X"(G) < Δ + 2 
hold? More generally, if μ denotes the multiplicity of G, does 
X"(G) < Δ + μ + 1 
hold? 
■ 
Total coloring was introduced by Vizing [1964, 1965b] and independently by 
Behzad [ 1965] in his Ph.D. thesis. They both formulated the question above for simple 
graphs and conjectured that the answer is affirmative. The conjecture was mentioned 
in 1967 by A.A. Zykov in the problem session at a conference in Manebach, German 
Democratic Republic (see Zykov [ 1968b]). Also the conjecture that the answer to the 
second question above is affirmative is due to Behzad [1965] and independently to 
Vizing [1968]. 
An easy lower bound for the total chromatic number is x"(G) a Δ + 1. Upper 
bounds were obtained by Behzad, Chartrand, and Cooper [1967], who proved the 
conjecture for bipartite multigraphs, by Kostochka [1977a, 1978b, 1979], and by 
Hind [1988, 1990]. Kostochka proved that 
X"(G) . | ] Δ ] 
for any multigraph G. Initially, Kostochka proved this bound for all except finitely 
many values of Δ. Later he obtained proofs also for the exceptional values. Hind 
gave the bound 
x"(G)<x'(G) + 2\jtfGJ], 
where x'(G) is the edge-chromatic number of G. Recently, Sanchez-Arroyo [1993] 
proved 
X"(G) < X'(G) + |jX(G)J + 2, 
giving a bound which is in some cases better than Hind's, that is, when the chromatic 
number of G is not too large, among such values all x(G) satisfying 2 ^ x(G) s 23. 

Total Coloring 
87 
Häggkvist and Chetwynd [1992] proved that if t satisfies t\> n, then 
X"(G) s X'(G) + t. 
In particular, the inequality x"(G) ^ Δ + μ + t follows by the theorem of Vizing 
(Theorem 29 in Chapter 1), stating that x'(G) < Δ + μ. An upper bound of x"(G) 
< 
x'(G) + t + 1, again with f! > n as above, was obtained independently by McDiarmid 
and Reed [1993]. The bound is better than Hind's bound when x(G) is moderately 
large, say x(G) > (logn)3. 
Hind [1992] proved, using the theorem of Hajnal and Szemer6di [1970] (Theo-
rem 13 in Chapter 1), the bound 
*"(G)<A+2|~£l+l, 
which is better than other known bounds when n is large and Δ is large relative to n. 
R. Häggkvist [personal communication in 1993] has informed us of a recent 
result obtained by A. G. Chetwynd and himself: 
x"(G)<A 
+ 18·Δ1/3·1οδ(3Δ). 
The total chromatic number x"(G) is closely related to the list-edge-chromatic number 
Xg(G), defined as follows. Let each edge xy of G be assigned a list A(JCV) of λ colors; 
then a A-coloring is an edge-coloring in which every edge is assigned a color from its 
list. The list-edge-chromatic number x[(G) is the minimum number λ for which such 
a coloring exists for any given Λ with λ colors in each list. Clearly, x'^G) s 
x'(G). 
The bound 
X"(G) ^ xi(G) + 2 
is easily obtained: First color the vertices of G with at most x't{G) + 2 > Δ different 
colors. Now color each edge of G with a color chosen from the x[(G) different 
colors not assigned to either vertex incident to it. The list-coloring conjecture (see 
Section 1.9), that every graph or multigraph G satisfies x'e(G) = x'(G), would imply, 
using Vizing's theorem (Theorem 29 of Chapter 1), that 
X"(G) < Δ + μ + 2 
always holds. 
The total coloring conjecture has been proved for graphs of sufficiently small 
maximum degree. It was proved for Δ = 3 by Rosenfeld [1971] and independently 
by Vijayaditya [1971], and an algorithmic proof was presented by Yap [1989a]. For 
Δ = 4 Kostochka [1977b] gave a proof of x"(G) ^ 6. The case Δ = 5 was settled 
in the doctoral thesis of Kostochka [1978b, 1979], who proved that x"(G) < Δ + 2 
is valid for all multigraphs G with Δ ^ 5 (this proof was published in Russian, but 

88 
Degrees 
Kostochka has informed us that an English version is under preparation [personal 
communication in 1994]). Also, for simple graphs G of maximum degree satisfying 
A(G) s \V(G)\ — 5, the conjecture has been verified by Yap, Wang, and Zhang 
[1989, 1992]. 
For a simple graph Gof minimum degree 5(G) 5: 5(|V(G)| + l)/6 the conjecture 
has been verified by Chetwynd, Hilton, and Zhao Cheng [1991], and also for even 
values of \V(G)\ when 6(G) > 3(|V(G)| - l)/4. Hilton and Hind [1993] improved 
these results by showing that the condition 8(G) s 3|V(G)|/4 is sufficient for all 
values of |V(G)|. For (simple) complete /-partite graphs the conjecture was proved 
by Yap [1989a]. 
If G is a simple planar graph, Behzad and Vizing's total coloring conjecture has 
been proved with the exception of the cases Δ = 6 or 7. For Δ ^ 5 it follows by the 
results on graphs of small maximum degree mentioned above. For Δ s 14 the total 
chromatic number of G is, in fact, equal to Δ + 1, as proved by Borodin [1989b], 
who also added the question: Is there a smaller number that can replace 14? In the 
same paper Borodin proved the conjecture for G simple and planar with Δ > 9. For 
Δ = 8, Borodin [personal communication in 1993] has informed us that x"(G) ^ 1 0 
can be proved from the four-color theorem (see Section 1.2) combined with a theorem 
of Vizing [1968] that the edge-chromatic number of a simple planar graph G with 
Δ s 8 is x'(G) = Δ. To prove this, first color the edges with colors 1,2,..., 8 such 
that no two adjacent edges receive the same color, and color the vertices with colors 
7,8,9,10 so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color. Then recolor every 
edge e whose color is either 7 or 8 with one of the at least two colors from {7,8,9,10} 
not occurring on either vertex incident to e. That such a recoloring is possible is a 
special, and easy, case of the theorem of V.G. Vizing and independently P. Erdös, 
A.L. Rubin, and H. Taylor (Theorem 35 in Chapter 1) generalizing Brooks' theorem 
to list colorings: The list-chromatic number of any graph is at most as large as its 
maximum degree, except if the graph is complete or an odd cycle. This completes the 
proof for Δ = 8. The argument can immediately be generalized, also for nonplanar 
multigraphs, to a proof of the statement that x(G) s 4 implies 
X"(G) < x'(G) + 2. 
The idea of the proof above for Δ = 8 seems due to Yap [1989b], but a full proof 
may have been first presented by Andersen [1993]. Yap [1989b] noted that the 
remaining open cases Δ = 6 and 7 of the total coloring conjecture for simple planar 
graphs would follow from Vizing's planar graph conjecture (see Problem 12.7) that 
if Δ > 6, then x'(G) = Δ. With Δ = 6, Borodin [1989b] has obtained *"(G) < 9. 
McDiarmid and Reed [1993] proved that the total coloring conjecture of Behzad 
and Vizing is in a very strong sense true for almost all simple graphs: There exists 
a constant c < 1 so that only a fraction o(c" ) of all simple graphs on n vertices are 
counterexamples to the conjecture having χ" > Δ + 2. 
The simple graphs G satisfying the total coloring conjecture fall into two classes. 
Type 1 graphs have x"(G) = A(G) + 1, whereas type 2 graphs have x"(G) = 
A(G) + 2. The question of distinguishing between the two types has been addressed 
by Chetwynd and Hilton [1988b] and Hilton [1990, 1991]. Chetwynd and Hilton 

Acyclic Coloring 
89 
[1988b] proposed a conjecture (Conjecture 1 in their paper) to do so for graphs of 
high maximum degree; however, the conjecture fails already for A(G) = | V(G)| - 2, 
as proved by Chen and Fu [1992]. (But perhaps the examples of Chen and Fu are the 
only counterexamples when A(G) > ||V(G)|; this has very recently been proposed 
in a manuscript "Totally critical graphs and the conformability conjecture" by G.M. 
Hamilton, A.J.W. Hilton, and H.R. Hind.) 
Sanchez-Arroyo [1989a, 1989b] proved that it is NP-complete to decide for a 
given graph G ifx"(G) = A(G) + 1. McDiarmid and Sanchez-Arroyo [1994] proved 
that for every fixed k > 3 it is even JVP-complete to decide for a given /t-regular 
bipartite graph G if x"(G) = k + 1. 
Chetwynd [1990] gave a survey on total coloring, and Häggkvist and Chetwynd 
[1992] wrote a detailed survey on list coloring and total coloring.

EQUITABLE COLORING 
The equitable chromatic number, XEq(G), is defined as the least k for 
which G has a ^-coloring in which the sizes of the color classes differ by 
at most one. If G is connected, is XEq(G) at most the maximum degree 
A(G), unless G is an odd cycle or complete? 
■ 
The question is due to Meyer [1973]. An affirmative answer would extend the famous 
theorem of Brooks [1941] (Theorem 11 in Chapter 1). Hajnal and Szemeredi [1970] 
proved that *Eq(G) s A(G) + 1 for all G (Theorem 13 in Chapter 1). 
Lih and Wu [1991] have shown that the answer is affirmative for all connected 
bipartite graphs. Chen and Lih [1994] determined the equitable chromatic number of 
any tree. If the answer is negative in general, one might ask for a characterization of 
those G for which *Eq(G) = A(G) + 1. 
■ 
4.11. ACYCLIC COLORING 
The acyclic chromatic number, a(G), is defined as the least k for which 
G has a usual ^-coloring, so that, in addition, the union of any two color 
classes induces a subgraph of G without cycles. Find a best possible upper 
bound for a(G) in terms of the maximum degree Δ of G. 
■ 
The acyclic chromatic number was introduced by Grünbaum [1973] and was studied, 
in particular for graphs embedded on surfaces, by Albertson and Berman [1976] 
and Borodin [1979a, 1993a] (see Theorem 8 in Chapter 1), among several others. 
Grünbaum [1973] noted that it is easy to obtain bounds for a(G) that are quadratic 
in Δ, and he asked if a(G) < Δ + 1. Albertson and Berman [1976] reported that this 
was answered in the negative by R Erdös, who proved by probabilistic methods the 
existence of graphs G with a(G) a Δ 4 / 3" ε. 
Albertson and Berman [1976] mentioned a conjecture of Erdös that a(G) = 
ο(Δ2). This conjecture was proved by Alon, McDiarmid, and Reed [1991], who

Degrees 
showed probabilistically that there exists a constant c\ > 0 such that a(G) ^ c\ · 
Δ4/3. On the other hand, they proved that there exists a constant c2 > 0 such that 
there exist graphs of maximum degree Δ and acyclic chromatic number larger than 
c2 . Δ4/3 · (logA)-'/3 for infinitely many Δ. Alon, McDiarmid, and Reed remarked 
that they would suspect the upper bound to be of best possible magnitude, but that 
no families of graphs G have been constructed for which a(G) grows this rapidly as 
a function of Δ. 
For specific values of Δ the problem does not seem very much studied. Clearly, 
a(G) < 2 if and only if G is a forest. Grünbaum [1973] proved that a(G) < 4 for 
Δ = 3, and a(G) < 6 for Δ = 4 , and he remarked that the former bound is best 
possible, but that he expected that the latter could be improved. The bound a(G) :£ 5 
for Δ = 4 was indeed proved by Burstein [ 1979], who mentioned that this result had 
also been obtained by A.V. Kostochka. 
Answering a question of Albertson and Berman [1976], Kostochka [1978b] 
proved in his doctoral thesis that it is an M'-complete problem to decide if a given G 
satisfies a(G) ^ 3. In fact, the problem remains M'-complete even if G is restricted 
to be planar and bipartite with col(G) ^ 3. Alon, McDiarmid, and Reed [1991] 
remarked that there is a simple polynomial algorithm for coloring G acyclically with 
Δ2 colors, and that it would be interesting to find a polynomial algorithm for coloring 
acyclically with ο(Δ2) colors.

This problem is due to L.S. Melnikov and was mentioned by Vizing [1968] and 
by Zykov [1968a]. The suggested lower bound would be best possible as shown by 
Melnikov. A best possible upper bound established by Nettleton [1960] and Dirac 
[1964b] is 
X(G) < \V(G)\ - [w(G)/2j. 
■ 4.13. INDUCED-ODD DEGREE SUBGRAPHS 
Let /(G) denote the largest cardinality of a set of vertices W C V(G) 
such that the induced subgraph G[W] has only odd vertex degrees. If G 

Strong Chromatic Number

is without isolated vertices, is 
|V(G)| 
X(G) 
f(G) 
? 
The question was asked by Scott [1992], who proved that for any graph G without 
isolated vertices, 
^ ( G ) S 2 Ä G ) · 
The bound suggested above would be the best possible, as shown by the graph 
obtained from the complete 6-graph by removing the edges of a perfect matching.

4.14. 
STRONG CHROMATIC NUMBER 
If the number |V(G)| of vertices of G is divisible by the number k ^ 1, 
then G is said to be strongly ^-colorable if every partition of V(G) into sets 
of size k allows a proper ^-coloring of G such that each set of the partition 
contains a vertex from every color class. If \V(G)\ is not divisible by k, 
G is defined to be strongly ^-colorable if the graph obtained by adding 
k ■ \\V(G)\/k] 
— |V(G)\ new isolated vertices to G is strongly ^-colorable. 
For any graph G, the strong chromatic number, sx(G), of G is the smallest 
number k for which G is strongly ^-colorable. What are the best possible 
bounds on s\(G) in terms of the maximum degree A(G) of G? 
■ 
The problem was introduced and studied by Alon [1988] and independently by 
Fellows [1990]. They both obtained exponential upper bounds on sx(G) in terms of 
A(G). A much better bound was later established by Alon [1992], who showed that 
there exists a constant c such that s\(G) ^ c · A(G), with a proof suggesting a rough 
estimate of c » 108. Alon [1988] studied the problem of finding a lower bound for 
s\(G) and proved that for any Δ s 1 there exists a graph G with A{G) = Δ and 
sx(G) > 31Δ /2J, hence implying that c > 3/2. Alon [1992] remarked that the actual 
value of c is probably much closer to 3/2 than to the estimated upper bound. The 
lower bound has, however, been improved by Fleischner and Stiebitz [1993] to c 2: 2. 
A particularly well-studied special case is the graph C3„, the cycle of length 3n. 
The question if sx(C3„) = 3 for all n > 1 was asked by P. Erdös at MIT in 1987 as 
an extension of a problem of D.Z. Du, D.F. Hsu, and F.K. Hwang (see West [1991a] 
and also Fleischner and Stiebitz [1992]). Fellows [1990] reported that the question 
was asked independently by J. Schönheim, and that I. Schur formulated the following 
equivalent conjecture many years ago: For any partition of the set Z of integers into 
triples, there is another partition (Si, S2, S3) of Z such that each S, contains a member 

92 
Degrees 
of each triple but no consecutive pair of integers. (It has later transpired that the 
problem was incorrectly attributed to Schur, due to a misunderstanding in an oral 
communication in which Hsu was mentioned [personal communication from Fellows 
in 1994].) The problem was solved in the affirmative by Fleischner and Stiebitz [1992] 
using the deep theorem of N. Alon and M. Tarsi (Theorem 34 in Chapter 1); a proof 
was also obtained by Sachs [1993] using elementary methods. 
For a cycle with An vertices it was remarked by Alon [ 1992] that C^n can be shown 
strongly 4-colorable using the methods of Alon [1988,1992] or Fellows [1990]. This 
was also proved by W. Fernandez de la Vega. However, a characterization of graphs G 
withA(G) = 2 and sx(G) = 4 seems unknown. Constructions of Gallai[ 1963a] show 
that if G has a subgraph consisting of two disjoint cycles, one of length m and one 
of length 2m, where m ^ 3, then s\(G) > 3. J. Huang [personal communication in 
1993] observed that sx(G) > 3 if G contains a cycle of length 1 modulo 3. Fleischner 
and Stiebitz [1993] remarked that the best possible upper bound for sx(G) for all G 
with A(G) = 2 is not known.

Critical graphs were first defined and used by G.A. Dirac when he studied for 
his Ph.D. at the University of London under the supervision of R. Rado. In 1949 
he told P. Erdös about his new concept, and Erdös' first reaction was to ask for 
the maximum number of edges in critical graphs (see Erdös [1985, 1989] and Toft 
[1970a]). Dirac immediately observed that a 6-critical graph with many edges can be 
obtained by completely joining two disjoint odd cycles of the same length (see Dirac 
[1952a]). If G has n vertices, the number of edges is n 2/4 + n. To this day no better 
6-critical example has been obtained for any value of n, nor has it been proved that 
the graphs constructed by Dirac are the best possible (except for small values of n). 
We conjecture that the graphs of Dirac are not the best possible. If it is required only 
that x(G - x) < x(G) = 6 for all vertices x of G (i.e., G is 6-vertex-critical), then it 
is known that there are such graphs on n vertices and at least 3n2/10 edges (see Toft 
[1978]). 
The bounds F4(n) > n2/\6 
for all values of n with n > 4 and n Φ 5, and 
Fsin) > 4n2/31 for all values of n with n ^ 5 and n Φ 6, were shown constructively

Critical Graphs 
by Toft [1970a]. Again, no better constructions have been found. However, it seems 
likely that the constant 4/31 for 5-critical graphs can be improved—for 5-vertex-
critical graphs it can be improved to 1 /4; this can be obtained from two odd cycles 
of equal lengths using the result of Toft [1978] that a graph is the complement of 
a vertex-critical graph if and only if all its blocks are. In the 4-critical graphs with 
many edges constructed by Toft [1970a] most edges are concentrated in bipartite 
subgraphs, but V. Rödl and Stiebitz [1987b] proved that this need not be so. 
The corresponding question for ^-critical r -uniform hypergraphs was studied 
by Toft [1975a], who proved that the correct order of magnitude is 0{nr) for k s 4 
and gave for k = 3 the lower bound c · ri""', where c > 0 is a constant. Loväsz 
[1976] subsequently gave an interesting linear algebra proof that the correct order of 
magnitude is indeed 0(n r - 1) for k = 3.

5.2. 
MINIMUM DEGREE OF 4-AND 5-CRITICAL GRAPHS 
Let 8k(n) be the maximum possible minimum degree in a ^-critical graph 
on n vertices. What is the order of magnitude of δ4(«)? In particular does 
there exist a constant c > 0 such that δ4(«) ^ cnl What is the order of 
magnitude of δ5(«)? Do /--regular 4-critical graphs exist for all r ^ 3? ■ 
Simonovits [1972] and Toft [1972b] independently proved that δ4(«) > c«1/3 by 
construction. This may be the best possible order of magnitude. The "in particular"-
question above is due to P. Erdös (see Erdös [1985,1989]). Erdös posed the question 
about δ4(η) when G.A. Dirac in 1949 presented him with examples of 6-critical 
graphs obtained by completely joining two odd cycles of the same length, showing 
δβ(η) ^ n/2. Perhaps one should first try to look at the problem of determining δ*(«) 
for k = 5—it might be easier than for k = 4. 
Erdös [ 1989] asked the question about the existence of r -regular 4-critical graphs 
and he conjectured that the answer is affirmative. He also remarked that no such graph 
seems known for any value of r s 6. By the theorem of R.L. Brooks (Theorem 11 
in Chapter 1), the only 3-regular 4-critical graph is the complete graph K4. Gallai 
[1963a] constructed the first examples of 4-regular 4-critical graphs, in fact an infinite 
family of these. Later constructions were due to Koester [1985b, 1990] (of planar 
examples) and Youngs [1992]. 
A triangle-free edge-transitive 4-regular 4-critical graph G was discovered by 
Jensen and Royle [1989]. The vertices of G are numbered 1,2,..., 13 with ij an edge 
of G if and only if/ — ,/ = 1,5,8, or 12 modulo 13. G has the curious property of being 
embeddable on the torus such that the toroidal dual graph G* is isomorphic to G. 
G is not embeddable on the Klein bottle. Five-regular 4-critical graphs seem more 
scarce. One example has been found by T.R. Jensen. The vertices are the integers 
1,2,..., 24. The edge set consists of the pairs of vertices with difference 5 or 12, the 
pairs of even vertices with difference 2, and the pairs of odd vertices with difference 
4. (All differences are taken modulo 24.) 

Critical Graphs With Few Edges

5.3. 
CRITICAL GRAPHS WITH FEW EDGES 
Let fk(n) denote the minimum number of edges possible in a ^-critical 
graph (k ^ 4) on n vertices (n > A: + 2). What is the value of /*(«)? For 
3 ·& s ■& k, let R(k, s) denote the largest integer such that every ^-critical 
graph G without a complete s-graph as a subgraph satisfies 
2 ■ |E(G)| & (* - 1) ■ |V(G)| + ÄGU). 
Determine R(k, s). 
■ 
The natural first question asks for an extension of the theorem of R.L. Brooks 
(Theorem 11 in Chapter 1), which implies that 
2fk(n)>(k-l)n 
+ l. 
Dirac [1957c] proved (Theorem 16 in Chapter 1) 
2/t(«)2£ ( * - ! ) « + ( * - 3 ) . 
Dirac's proof was rather long. Shorter and more elegant proofs were found by Kronk 
and Mitchem [1972a] and Weinstein [1975]. Dirac [1974] also gave a complete 
description of the extremal cases. 
Gallai [1963a] proved that the second term tends to infinity with n: 
2fk(n) a (k - 1)» + 
-p^n 
(Theorem 17 in Chapter 1). Moreover, Gallai [1963b] determined the exact value 
of fk(n) for n s 2k - 1. Ore [1967] suggested the following: If G is it-critical on n 
vertices with a minimum number of edges, then a fc-critical graph obtained from G 
and Kk by the construction of Hajos [1961] (see Section 1.4) is perhaps a it-critical 
graph on n + k — 1 vertices with a minimum number of edges? This would imply 
that/t(« + k - 1) = /»(#!) + \k(k - 1) - 1. 
For* = 4,the suggestion of Ore together with/4(4) = 6,/4(6) = 10,/4(7) = 11, 
and/4(8) = 13 (see Toft [1974b]) would imply equality in 
/4(») *|j«]. 
In general, the values oifk(ri) for n^2k 
and the suggestion of Ore imply a suggested 
value of fic(n) for all n. However, fk(2k) is not known for k S 5. 

100 
Critical Graphs 
The same question may be asked for ^-critical graphs with no Kg as a subgraph, 
I fixed, 3 £ t < k. At the International Conference on Combinatorics in Keszthely, 
Hungary, July 1993, J. Schönheim asked this question in general, and he also asked 
in particular: Is it true that a 10-critical graph on n vertices without K9 as subgraph 
has more than 5« — 11 edges? 
The fact that (lim„_a> fk(n)/n) exists was mentioned by Liu [1976], but the 
argument goes back, via H.L. Abbott and L. Moser, to Fekete [1923]. We shall 
present the argument in the case k = 4. We let f(ri) denote fain). 
By Hajos' construction and the preceding remarks, 
f(n + m) < /(«) + f(m + 1) (« > 6, m > 5) 
(5.1) 
and 
f{n) < 5-n (n > 6).

The conjectured value of (lim„_oc Uin)/ri) is 5/3. 
As mentioned above, Dirac [1957c] proved that Rik,k) = k — 3 (Theorem 16 
in Chapter 1), and moreover proved the generalization Rik,s) > (k — 3) + ik — s). 
Weinstein [1975] proved that R(k,s) > (k - 3) + 2(k - s), and that for fixed s the 
growth ofRik, s) is in fact at least quadratic in k.

5.4. FOUR-CRITICAL AMENABLE GRAPHS 
Let G be a graph of chromatic number x(G) — k > 1. G is called 
amenable if for every nonconstant mapping / : V(G) —► {1,2,... ,k} 
there exists a proper vertex coloring φ : V(G) —*{l,2,...,k} 
so that 
φ(χ) Φ f(x) for all x £ V(G). Determine the minimum number, n4, of 
vertices in a 4-critical nonamenable graph. 
■ 
T. Gallai asked if all 4-critical graphs are amenable (see Toft [1970a]). However, 
a construction due to V. Rödl and Stiebitz [1987b] gave, as pointed out by B. Toft, 
examples of 4-critical nonamenable graphs. The smallest such example shows that 
n4 < 50. 
Brown, Kelly, Schönheim, and Woodrow [1990] proved the so far best known 
lower bound n4 s 10. The obvious generalization of determining the number «* for 
k Φ 4 has also been studied. For k = 3, Kelly and Kelly [1954] observed that all 
odd cycles are amenable, hence n3 does not exist. B.Aa. S0rensen and Toft [1974a] 
proved that nk s 1 \k - 24 for all k > 5. 
■ 
5.5. FOUR-CRITICAL DEGREE 5 PROBLEM 
Let G be a 4-critical graph with a vertex x of degree 5 and let N be the set 
of neighbors of x in G. Let / : N —► {1,2,3} be a nonconstant mapping. 
Does there exist a 3-coloring φ of G - x with colors 1,2, and 3, such that 
<Piy) * fiy) for all y in ΛΓ? 
■ 

102 
Critical Graphs 
This question was raised by Toft [1974a], who proved that the answer is always 
YES for x of degree less than 5 and sometimes NO for x of degree greater than 5. 
For general k > 5 the answer to the corresponding question is YES for x of degree 
2k - 3 or less, and NO for x of degree 2k - 2 or more (see Toft [1974a]); hence the 
only remaining unanswered case is the one above. 
■ 
5.6. 
LARGE CRITICAL SUBGRAPHS OF CRITICAL GRAPHS 
For k > 4, does a large ^-critical graph necessarily contain a large (k— 1)-
critical subgraph? 
■ 
This question was asked by J. Nesetril and V. Rödl at the International Colloquium 
on Finite and Infinite Sets in Keszthely in Hungary in 1973 celebrating the sixtieth 
birthday of P. Erdös. For k = 4 the answer is affirmative: Kelly and Kelly [1954] 
proved that every large ^-critical graph contains a long cycle, and since a /t-critical 
graph is 2-connected with odd cycles, there has also to be a long odd cycle. An 
alternative argument was given by Voss [1977, 1991]. 
Fork 3: 5 the question is unsettled. Stiebitz [1987b] proved that if every (k - 1)-
critical subgraph of a ^-critical graph G is as small as possible (i.e., is a Kk- \), then 
G = Kk. 
■ 
5.7. 
CRITICAL SUBGRAPH COVERING A 2-PATH 
Let P be a path of length 2 in a ^-critical graph {k S: 4). Is there a 
(k — l)-critical subgraph containing P? 
■ 
This question is due to Toft [1974b], who proved that for each pair of edges et 
and ei in a /t-critical graph there is a (it - l)-critical subgraph containing e\ but not 
containing ei-
An affirmative answer to the question for k - 4 follows from a theorem of 
Dirac [1964a], and was also obtained by Wessel [1981]. If the answer to the question 
is negative for some value of k s 5, then by the construction of Hajos [1961] (see 
Section 1.4) it is possible to obtain arbitrarily large ^-critical graphs where all (k— 1)-
critical subgraphs are of bounded size. Hence the answer to the question of J. Nesetril 
and V. Rödl above (Problem 5.6) would also be negative. 
For Ä-vertex-critical graphs Toft [1974b] observed that for any two vertices x 
and y there is always an induced (k - l)-vertex-critical subgraph containing x but 
not y. An example of a 4-critical graph containing two vertices x and y not joined 
by any induced path of odd length, and thus not both contained in the same induced 
odd cycle, has been found by S. Hougardy [personal communication in 1993]. This 
negatively answers a question posed by Duchet and Meyniel [1989] if it is true that 
two distinct vertices in a /t-critical graph are always joined by some induced path of 
odd length. 

Number of Critical Subgraphs 
103 
■ 
5.8. 
NONINDUCED CRITICAL SUBGRAPHS 
Let G be a ^-critical graph (k a 4). If G is not a complete graph, does 
there exist a (k — l)-critical noninduced subgraph of G? 
■ 
Stiebitz [1985] asked this question and proved the weaker result that if every 
(k - l)-critical subgraph of G is a copy of the complete graph ΑΓ^_ι, then G is itself 
the complete graph Kk. 
Although not difficult to prove, Stiebitz' weaker result is of interest for two 
different reasons. First, it shows that if all (k — 1 )-critical subgraphs of a ^-critical 
graph are as small as possible (k s 4), then G itself is as small as possible. This is of 
interest in connection with the problem by J. Ne§etril and V. Rödl on the existence of 
large (k — l)-critical subgraphs of ^-critical graphs (Problem 5.6). Second, it implies 
that the nonperfect graphs for which all proper subgraphs are perfect are precisely the 
odd cycles of length at least 5 (compare with the strong perfect graph conjecture as 
stated in Section 1.6). Thus the problem asks for generalizations of these statements. 
■ 
5.9. 
NUMBER OF CRITICAL SUBGRAPHS 
If G is a ^-critical graph on n vertices, is it true that G contains n distinct 
(k — l)-critical subgraphs? 
■ 
The question was asked by T. Gallai [personal communication in 1984], and it 
was mentioned by Stiebitz [1985], who proved that G contains at least log2 n distinct 
(k - l)-critical subgraphs. 
The problem has a natural generalization to vertex-critical graphs: If G is k-
vertex-critical, does G contain n distinct induced subgraphs that are (k — l)-vertex-
critical? We note that an affirmative answer to this question would solve Gallai's 
problem above. Abbott and Zhou [ 1993b] improved Stiebitz' lower bound by showing 
that if G is &-vertex-critical, then G contains at least (n(k — l)!)1^*"" subgraphs that 
are (k — l)-vertex-critical. The results were proved by using an observation of Toft 
[1974b], that for any two vertices x and y of a fc-vertex-critical graph there is an 
induced (k - l)-vertex-critical subgraph containing x but not y. It follows by a 
simple argument that G has at least log2 n induced (k — l)-vertex-critical subgraphs. 
Abbott and Zhou [1993b] refined this argument and obtained their stronger result. 
T. Gallai conjectured that every ^-critical graph G on n vertices contains at most n 
copies of Kk- x as subgraphs. This conjecture was settled in the affirmative by Stiebitz 
[1985] for k = 4 and by Abbott and Zhou [1992] for all k > 5. Moreover, Abbott 
and Zhou [1992] proved that if G contains exactly n copies of Kk-\, where k s 4, 
then G — Kk, and if G is 4-critical with n > 6 and contains exactly n - 1 triangles, 
then G is an odd wheel (i.e., a vertex completely joined to an odd cycle). Abbott and 
Zhou suggested that perhaps every ^-critical graph o n « ^ i + 2 vertices contains at 
most n — k + 3 complete (k - 1 )-graphs (k > 5). An odd wheel completely joined to 
a complete graph shows that this would be best possible. For k £ 7 the suggestion of 
Abbott and Zhou was confirmed by Su [1994a, 1994b],who conjectured (and proved 

104 
Critical Graphs 
for k s 7) that every ^-critical graph on n s k + 2 vertices has an edge contained 
in at most one Kk-\. 
■ 
5.10. SUBGRAPHS OF CRITICAL GRAPHS 
If H is a subgraph of some ^-critical graph (k s: 4), is it then true that 
H is a subgraph of a ^-critical graph G, where \V(G)\ :S c* · | V(//)| for 
some constant c* depending only on kl 
■ 
This question was posed by Stiebitz [1987b]. Green well and Loväsz [1974] char-
acterized the possible subgraphs of ^-critical graphs, and this was done independently 
by Müller [1975, 1979]: A graph H is a proper subgraph of some £-critical graph if 
and only if// is (k - l)-colorable and for every edge xy £ £(//) the graph H - xy is 
(k - 1 )-colorable with x and y colored the same. In particular, any (k - 2)-colorable 
graph can be used as //, and for such H there is a ^-critical G such that H CG and 
\V(G)\ =£ 2 ■ \V(H)\ + dk 
for a constant <4 depending only on k, as observed by Toft [1974a]. 
■ 
5.11. MINIMAL CIRCUMFERENCE OF CRITICAL GRAPHS 
The circumference of a graph G is the maximum length of a cycle in G. 
Let 
Lk(n) — min(circumference of G) 
G 
where the minimum is taken over all ^-critical graphs G with at least n 
vertices. What is the order of magnitude of Lk(ri)7 
■ 
Lk(n) is a nondecreasing function of n. Kelly and Kelly [1954] proved that, 
in fact, Lk(n) —» °° as n —♦ °°. Concerning an upper bound, Kelly and Kelly [1954] 
proved that L4(/i) s c ■ (log n)2. After subsequent improvements by Dirac [ 1955] and 
Read [1957], Gallai [1963a] obtained the best result so far, namely 
, , s^ 
2(k- 1) 
Lk<,n) < r—7 
T7 · log n 
log(* - 2) 
for k 5: 4 and infinitely many values of n. 
M 5.12. THE ERDÖS-LOVÄSZ TIHANY PROBLEM 
Let G be a ^-chromatic graph containing no Kk, and let a and b be natural 
numbers with a, b S: 2 and a + b = k + I. Does there exist a pair of 
disjoint subgraphs of G of chromatic numbers a and b, respectively? 
■ 

Vertex-Critical Graphs Without Critical Edges 
105 
The case k = 5 and a = b = 3 was asked by Erdös [1968] and generalized by 
L. Loväsz in this way. 
The question of Erdös (k = 5 and a = b = 3) was settled in the affirmative by 
Brown and Jung [1969], and the case (it, a, b) = (4,2,3) can be dealt with likewise. 
The case (it, a, b) = (5,2,4) has been solved by Mozhan [1986] and independently by 
Stiebitz [1987a, 1988]. Moreover, Stiebitz [1988] solved the cases (it, a, b) = (6,3,4) 
and (7,3,5). 
For the case a = 2 the problem can be formulated as follows: A it-chromatic 
graph G is "double-critical" if for every edge xy of G the graph G — x — y is 
(k - 2)-colorable. Is Kk the only double-critical graph? This formulation resembles 
Hadwiger's conjecture, and some (not very deep) relations between the two were 
exhibited in Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m and Toft [1981]. 
■ 
5.13. 
PARTIAL JOINS OF CRITICAL GRAPHS 
Let two disjoint graphs G\ and G2 be k{- and ^-critical, respectively. A 
partial join of G\ and G2 is obtained from the union of G{ and G2 by 
adding a set of new edges each joining a vertex of G\ to a vertex of G2. 
Characterize the critical graphs that are partial joins of smaller critical 
graphs. In particular, do so when G\ and G2 are both odd cycles, or when 
G\ is complete. 
■ 
For complete joins, where all vertices of G\ are joined to all vertices of G%, the 
graph G obtained is (k\ + £2)-critical as observed by Dirac [1952a]. The questions on 
partial joins were asked by T. Gallai [personal communication in 1969], who knew 
examples of critical graphs being partial noncomplete joins of smaller critical graphs 
(see the description of Gallai's graphs given by Krusenstjerna-Hafstrom and Toft 
[1981]). Gallai also observed that every critical partial join of two complete graphs 
must be a complete join—this is equivalent to the fact that the complement of every 
bipartite graph is a perfect graph! 
Other examples of critical partial joins were presented by Youngs [ 1992]. Stiebitz 
and Wessel [1993] characterized the critical partial joins of a complete graph and an 
odd cycle. 
■ 
5.14. 
VERTEX-CRITICAL GRAPHS WITHOUT 
CRITICAL EDGES 
Is there some positive function / so that for every k ^ 4 there exists a 
graph G satisfying 
(i) x(G) = k, 
(ii) x(G - x) = k - 1 for all x E V(G) and 
(Hi) x(G - A) = k for all A C E(G) with |A| < /(«) 
where n = | V(G)|? If there is such an / , how fast can it grow? 
■ 

106 
Critical Graphs 
This question was formulated by Erdös [ 1989J. At the time when this problem was 
raised, there were no known graphs G of any chromatic number k satisfying (i)-(ni) 
even with f(n) = 1, that is, vertex-critical graphs without critical edges. For k ^ 3, 
clearly no such graph exists. A 5-vertex-critical graph without critical edges was given 
by Brown [1992], who observed that the following graph due to Chvätal, Graham, 
Perold, and Whitesides [1979] will do: The vertices of G are the integers modulo 17 
with i* and j joined by an edge if and only if i — j G {2,6,7,8,9,10,11,15} (addition 
modulo 17). Similarly constructed examples have been found by T.R. Jensen; in 
particular 5-vertex-critical 8-regular examples on 21 and 25 vertices, a 6-vertex-
critical 10-regular example on 21 vertices, and an 8-vertex-critical 14-regular example 
on 29 vertices. 
It remains open whether any examples exist for k = 4. It seems unknown if there 
exist examples of k-vertex-critical graphs without critical edges for infinitely many 
k, or examples of 5-vertex-critical graphs on n vertices and without critical edges for 
infinitely many n.

The Conjectures of 
Hadwiger and Hajos 
■ 
6.1. HADWIGER'S CONJECTURE 
Let G be a fc-chromatic graph. Is it true that by successive contractions of 
edges, G can be contracted into a graph containing Kk as a subgraph? 
Alternatively, is it true that G contains k disjoint connected subgraphs 
G\, G2, ■■ ■ ,Gk such that for all 1 and j , where 1 < 1 < 7 < k, there is an 
edge xy in G with x G V(G,) and y G V(Gj)l 
A third formulation: Let G 2: // mean that H is a minor of G (i.e., that 
// can be obtained from G by successive deletions of vertices and edges 
and/or contraction of edges). Let Q be a minor-closed class of graphs 
(i.e., if G E Q and G > //, then // G £). Is it true that the maximum 
chromatic number of graphs in a minor-closed class Q is equal to the size 
of a maximum complete graph in Ql 
A fourth formulation: A ^-chromatic graph G is contraction-critical if 
(G 2: H and G Φ H) implies that χ(Η) < k. Is the only ^-chromatic 
contraction-critical graph the complete £-graph Kkl 
■ 
That the answer to each of these equivalent questions is affirmative was conjec-
tured by Hadwiger [1943] and proved by him for k = 3. For k = 4 it was proved 
by Dirac [1952a]. For k = 5 an affirmative answer implies the four-color theorem. 
Wagner [1937] characterized the maximal graphs not contractible into K5 and ob-
served that they are all 4-colorable provided that all planar graphs are (Theorem 7 
in Chapter 1). Thus Hadwiger's conjecture for k = 5 and the four-color theorem are 
equivalent. For short proofs of Wagner's theorem and the equivalence theorem, see 
Halin [1964] and Young [1971], respectively. The book by Ore [1967] contains a 
detailed chapter on Hadwiger's conjecture. 
When Dirac [1952a] proved Hadwiger's conjecture for k = 4, he actually proved 
the stronger statement that any graph of minimum degree at least 3 can be contracted

The Conjectures of Hadwiger and Hajos 
into a graph containing K4 as a subgraph. Thus any graph G without such a contraction 
(usually such a graph is referred to as a "series-parallel" graph) has coloring number 
satisfying col(G) :£ 3 and there is a simple sequential algorithm for 3-coloring G 
(see Theorem 12 in Chapter 1, and also the survey paper by Matula, Marble, and 
Isaacson [1972]). More recently, Seymour [1990] has proved that the following 
"almost greedy" algorithm also ^-colors any series-parallel graph G for any t > 3 ( a 
similar algorithm is due to Brelaz [1979]): 
Initially, none of the vertices of G are colored. At each step of the algorithm, some 
vertices have been colored, and some remain uncolored. Among the uncolored vertices, 
one is chosen such that the number of different colors received by its already colored 
neighbours in G is maximum. This vertex is then colored with any color 1,2,..., k not 
already received by any of its neighbours, and the algorithm proceeds to the next step. 
When all vertices of G have been colored, or when the algorithm fails in being able to 
assign a color to some vertex, it stops. 
As indicated by Seymour, for k > 2 there is a bipartite graph that the algorithm may 
fail to £-color. He remarked that the series-parallel graphs form a surprisingly large 
class of graphs for which this simple algorithm always succeeds. 
Dirac [1964a] proved for k = 6 that a 6-chromatic graph G can be contracted 
into a graph containing a Κ^, a complete 6-graph with one edge missing. Mayer 
[1989b, 1992] initiated an attack on Hadwiger's conjecture for k — 6 by extending 
the proof methods used to solve the four-color problem (see Theorem 5 in Chapter 1). 
Mayer obtained a number of partial results, but not a complete proof. Robertson, 
Seymour, and Thomas [1993a] recently obtained a proof of Hadwiger's conjecture 
for k = 6. The result can be considered an extension of the result by Wagner [1937] 
(Theorem 7 in Chapter 1) that the truth of the conjecture for k = 5 is equivalent to 
the four-color theorem. Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas [1993a] showed that any 
minimum contraction-critical 6-chromatic graph, different from the complete graph 
K6, is an "apex graph" (i.e., it has a vertex whose removal leaves a planar graph). As 
a consequence, the four-color theorem implies Hadwiger's conjecture for k = 6. 
A graph is said to be "discatenable" if it can be embedded in R3 such that any two 
disjoint cycles are not concatenated (i.e., they are contained in disjoint topological 
balls). Sachs [1983] asked for the maximum chromatic number of discatenable graphs. 
As a consequence of the theorem of Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas [1993a] the 
statement that all discatenable graphs are 5-colorable is equivalent to the four-color 
theorem. For characterizations of discatenable graphs, see Robertson, Seymour, and 
Thomas [1993b]. 
Dirac [1964a] observed that contraction-critical fc-chromatic graphs different 
from Kk have minimum degree at least k. Mayer [1989a] proved the Brooks-type 
theorem that not all vertices can have degree k, and this was extended by Stiebitz 
and Toft [1993] to the result that there must be at least k - 4 vertices of degree at 
least k + 1. Stiebitz and Toft also proved that no four vertices of degree k induce a 
Kl (i.e., Κύ, minus an edge), thus giving an abstract extension of the planar graph 
diamond theorem of Birkhoff [1913] that no four vertices of degree 5 in a minimum 
counterexample to the four-color theorem induce a K± . 

Hajos' Conjecture 
111 
Jakobsen [1970,1971] proved for k = 7,8,and9thatafc-chromaticgraphcanbe 
contracted into a graph containing a Κη~, Κη , and Κη, respectively. Wagner [1964] 
proved the existence of a function f(k) such that any /(Jt)-chromatic graph can be 
contracted into a graph containing a Kk. A strong result of this type follows from an 
extremal result of Mader [1968a]: If a graph G satisfies 
| £ ( G ) | 2 = 8 - [ ^ " | . | V ( G ) | , 
then G can be contracted into a graph containing a AT*. It follows that every graph of 
chromatic number 16 · \k log k/ log 2] can be contracted into a graph containing a Kk. 
Kostochka [1982] improved Mader's extremal result, replacing 8 · \k log k/log 2] by 
c · k · yjlog k/ log 2. Moreover, Kostochka proved that this order of magnitude is best 
possible. This was also noted by Fernandez de la V6ga [1983] as a consequence of 
the calculations of Bollobäs, Catlin, and Erdös [1980]. Thomason [1984] estimated 
a value of c — 2.68 for k sufficiently large. 
Connectivity properties of contraction-critical λ-chromatic graphs have been 
found by Dirac [I960], Mader [1968b], and Toft [1972a]. Bollobäs, Catlin, and Erdös 
[1980] and independently Kostochka [1982] have proved that Hadwiger's conjecture 
is true for almost all graphs. By joining G completely to a large complete graph, 
Hadwiger's conjecture holds for the graph H obtained, if and only if it holds for G. 
Using this very simple observation it follows that to prove Hadwiger's conjecture for 
all k it suffices to prove it for all k and graphs H on at most ck vertices for any fixed 
c> 1. 
Vizing [1968] asked if Hadwiger's conjecture can be proved at least for line 
graphs of multigraphs. For line graphs of simple graphs it is not difficult to prove Had-
wiger's conjecture using the theorem of V.G. Vizing (Theorem 29 in 
Chapter 1). 
Concerning algorithms related to the general Hadwiger conjecture, N. Robert-
son reported (at the 11th British Combinatorial Conference at Goldsmith's College, 
University of London, in July 1987) on recent developments in his joint work with 
P.D. Seymour on graph minors. They had been able to describe an algorithm that for 
fixed k accepts a graph G and in low-degree polynomial time finds either 
(a) a Kk+1 minor of G, 
(b) a it-coloring of G, or 
(c) a minor H of G with no Kk+l as a minor and no it-coloring (i.e., a coun-
terexample to Hadwiger's conjecture).

6.2. 
HAJOS'CONJECTURE 
Let G be a fc-chromatic graph with k = 5 or 6. Does G contain a subdi-
vision oiKkl 
(A subdivision is obtained by replacing edges by internally 
disjoint paths.) 
■ 

112 
The Conjectures of Hadwiger and Hajos 
This question is attributed to G. Hajos. For k £ 4 the answer to the corresponding 
question is YES, as proved by Dirac [1952a]. For k s 7 the answer is NO, as pointed 
out by Catlin [1979]. The counterexamples of Catlin consist of five disjoint complete 
graphs G\, G2, G3, G4, and G5, with G5 and G\ completely joined, and G, and G,+i 
completely joined for / = 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let C(i) denote such a graph, with all 
the graphs G, being complete ί-graphs. Then C(3) is a counterexample to Hajos' 
conjecture for k — 8. 
The graphs described above were known prior to the paper of Catlin [1979]; 
they were in fact discovered and investigated by T. Gallai [personal communication 
in 1969] (see Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m and Toft [1981] for an account of Gallai's 
results), and independently by Borodin and Kostochka [1977], who conjectured that 
all λ-chromatic graphs of maximum degree k contain Kk as a subgraph when k s 9 
(see Problem 4.8). The reason for assuming that k a 9 was Borodin's and Kostochka's 
knowledge of C(3) as an 8-chromatic counterexample to their conjecture [personal 
communication from Borodin in 1993]. Also, the Catlin graphs are line graphs of so-
called ring multigraphs (cycles with multiple edges). The edge-chromatic numbers of 
ring multigraphs (i.e., the usual chromatic numbers of their line graphs) were given in 
Section 4.1 of the book by Ore [1967], where they were attributed to B.L. Rothschild 
and J. Stemple. 
Thus the main achievement of Catlin [1979] was not the discovery of the explicit 
graphs providing counterexamples to Hajos' conjecture, but rather, that he lead us out 
of a blind alley thinking that the conjectures of Hadwiger and Hajos were basically 
of the same nature, as had been the common belief prior to his work. The two 
conjectures are indeed very different. In fact, Erdös and Fajtlowicz [1981] proved 
that the statement "G contains a subdivision of the complete ^(G)-graph" is false for 
almost all graphs (see also the sharp estimate of x(G)/o),op(G) for random graphs 
by Bollobäs and Catlin [1981], where w,op(G) is the largest k for which G contains a 
subdivision of AT*). 
Mader [1972] proved the extremal theorem that if |E(G)| > 2*_1 · |V(G)| holds, 
then G contains a subdivision of AT*. This implies that if G is (2* + l)-chromatic, 
then G contains a subdivision of AT*. For small values of k stronger results are known: 
Pelikan [1969] proved from an extremal result for AT5~ (i.e., K5 minus an edge), that 
every 5-chromatic graph contains a subdivision of K$ . Thomassen [1974] proved 
that if \V(G)\ > 5 and |£(G)| a 4|V(G)| - 10, then G contains a subdivision of K5, 
implying that every 9-chromatic graph contains a subdivision of K$. Dirac [ 1964c] had 
conjectured that \E(G)\ > 4|V(G)| - 10 can be replaced by |£(G)| > 3|V(G)| - 5, 
but this remains an open problem. 
■ 
6.3. THE (m, n)- AND [m, n]-CONJECTURES 
A graph is said to have property Pm if it contains no subdivision of 
the complete graph ATm+i and no subdivision of the complete bipartite 
graph ATl(m+2)/2j,f(m+2)/2i· (A subdivision is obtained by replacing edges by 
internally disjoint paths.) 

The (m, n)- and [m, n]-Conjectures 
113 
Let x„(G) denote the minimum number of colors in an improper coloring 
of the vertices of G in which each color class induces a subgraph having 
property P„. For which values of m and n (m s « > 1) is it true that all 
graphs G having property Pm satisfy xn(G) ^ m — n + 1? 
Let x'n(G) denote the minimum number of classes in a partition of the 
edges of G for which each class of edges forms the edge set of a subgraph 
having property Pn. For which values of m and n (m > n > 2) is it true 
that all graphs G having property Pm satisfy x[iG) — w — n + 1? 
What are the answers to the corresponding questions in terms of contrac-
tions rather than subdivisions? That is, in terms of the property Qm that 
no Km+l and no ^(„+2)/2]κ»ι+2)/2ΐ can be obtained by successive deletions 
of vertices and edges and/or contraction of edges, rather than in terms of 
the property Pm. 
■ 
The conjectures that the answers to the first two questions are always affirmative, 
called the (m, n)-conjecture for vertex partitions and the [m, n]-conjecture for edge 
partitions, were posed by Chartrand, Geller, and Hedetniemi [1971] in an interesting 
paper, where they pointed out that many seemingly unrelated concepts in graph theory 
are closely related. 
For m - 1, 2, 3, and 4 the properties Pm are "without edges," "without cycles," 
"outerplanar," and "planar," respectively. Thus χχ is the usual chromatic number, 
χ2 the vertex arboricity, χ} the vertex outer thickness, and χ4 the vertex thickness. 
Moreover, χ'2 is the arboricity, χ'} the outer thickness, and χ^ the thickness. 
Chartrand, Geller, and Hedetniemi [1971] proved the (m, n)-conjecture for all 
ordered pairs (m, n) with 1 < Ü < m < 4, except for the case (m, n) = (4,1), which 
is the four-color theorem (see Section 1.2). They also proved the [m, n] -conjecture 
for all ordered pairs [m, n] with 2 < « < w < 4, except the case [m, n] = [4,3]. 
The [4,3]-conjecture was recently proved by Heath [1993], who also obtained a 
polynomial algorithm to divide the edges of a planar graph into two outerplanar 
subgraphs. This is perhaps the deepest achievement in this area so far (not taking the 
four-color theorem into account). Finding the proof of this result was very difficult and 
required considerable effort [personal communication from Heath in 1993]. Heath 
was motivated by applications to stack and queue layouts in computer science, and 
he developed his proof without knowing about the paper of Chartrand, Geller, and 
Hedetniemi [1971]. 
The (m,«)- and [m, n]-conjectures were mentioned in the excellent survey by 
Woodall [1990]. (In this survey it was, however, mistakenly stated that the [4,3]-
conjecture had been solved by Chartrand, Geller, and Hedetniemi [1971].) Woodall 
[1990] remarked that perhaps the corresponding conjectures in terms of contractions, 
rather than subdivisions, are more likely to be true. 
Indeed, it follows from arguments as those used by Erdös and Fajtlowicz [1981] 
that for all fixed values of n the (m, n)-conjecture is false for almost all graphs. 
Moreover, Hanson and Toft [1994] have proved that the type of graphs used by 

114 
The Conjectures of Hadwiger and Hajos 
Catlin [1979] to give counterexamples to Hajos' conjecture (see Problem 6.2) also 
give counterexamples to the (m, n)-conjecture for n = 1 and m sufficiently large. 
They asked if the smallest such counterexample is the graph C(ll) consisting of 
five disjoint complete 11-graphs G\,Gi, G3, G4, and G5, with G5 completely joined 
to G\, and G, completely joined to G,+ i, / = 1, 2, 3, and 4. This graph seems to 
have property Ρ2η, but x(C(\ 1)) = 28 > m — n + 1 =27. However, Hanson and 
Toft [1994] proved that C(t) satisfies property Pm for m = It + 2 [y/t + 4j. Thus 
X, (C(0) ^ 5f/2 > m - n + 1 = m for r > 29. This shows constructively that the 
(w, n)-conjecture fails for n = 1 and w sufficiently large. 
The case n = 1 of the (w, n)-contraction conjecture of Woodall [1990], that all 
graphs G having property Qm satisfy xn(G) < m - n + 1, may be regarded as a 
weaker version of Hadwiger's conjecture (see Problem 6.1). The case (4,1) of the 
(m, n)-contraction conjecture is precisely the four-color theorem. Hanson and Toft 
[1994] noted that, interestingly, the next two cases (5,1) and (6,1) seem simpler. 
They can be proved without resorting to the four-color theorem, using a result of 
Mader [1968b] that a ^-chromatic graph with k - 6 or 7 can be contracted either into 
a K/c or into a ^-connected graph. 
■ 6.4. HADWIGER DEGREE OF A GRAPH 
Let G be any graph. The Hadwiger degree μ(β) is defined as the smallest 
nonnegative integer such that there exists a graph H Φ G with χ{Η) 
ä 
X(G) obtained from a subgraph G' of G by contracting μ(ϋ) mutually 
disjoint, nontrivial, connected subgraphs of G' into equally many single 
vertices. If no such integer exists, define μ(ϋ) = °°. 
By definition, G is critical if and only if μ(β) S: 1, and G is contraction-
critical if and only if μ(β) = °°. Is it true that if x(G) < 7 and G is not 
complete, then μ(β) < 1? 
■ 
The concept of Hadwiger degree was introduced and studied by Krusenstjerna-
Hafstr0m and Toft [1981] in their remarks to the conjecture of Hadwiger [1943]. A 
possible formulation of Hadwiger's conjecture is the following: 
Conjecture. IfxiG) = kandG* 
Kk, then μ(Ο) < k. 
Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m and Toft proved the affirmative answer to the question 
for 4-chromatic graphs; this follows from the theorem of Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m 
and Toft [1980], which states that any such graph G, where G Φ K4, contains an 
odd cycle C without diagonals so that G - V(C) is a connected graph with at least 2 
vertices. Hence: 
Theorem. Ifx(G) = ΑαηάΰΦ 
ΚΛ, then μ(σ) < I. 

Scheine Conjecture 
115 
They remarked that this strengthening of Hadwiger's conjecture for k = 4 does 
not follow directly from the truth of G. Hajos' conjecture for k = 4 (first proved 
by Dirac [1952a]) that every 4-chromatic graph contains a subdivision of K4 as a 
subgraph. 
Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m and Toft [1981] showed that for any n > l there exists 
a graph G with Hadwiger degree μ(ΰ) = n. Each of their examples satisfies x(G) = 
5μ(ϋ) - 2, thus every known example of a graph with Hadwiger degree at least 2 
has chromatic number at least 8. 
■ 
6.5. GRAPHS WITHOUT ΟΌΌ-Κ5 
A graph H is called an oda-Kk if the following hold: 
(a) V(H) can be partitioned into k subsets Vy, V2,..., Vk each of which 
induces a tree in H. 
(b) For each pair i,j £ {1,2, ...,k} with i Φ j there exists exactly one 
edge etj from V, to Vj. 
(c) Each cycle C in H satisfies \E(C)\ = \E(C) Π £| (mod 2), where 
£ = {dj: i,j = 1,2,...,*;/ =£7}. 
If G does not contain an odd-K5 as a subgraph, is G 4-colorable? 
■ 
The question was raised by A.M.H. Gerards at the Fourth Bellairs Workshop on 
Combinatorial Optimization held in March 1993 in Holetown, Barbados. He conjec-
tured that the answer is affirmative. The statement implies the four-color theorem but 
is not implied by it directly. 
Gerards [personal communication in 1993] and P.D. Seymour asked more gen-
erally: Is it true that every ^-chromatic graph contains an odd-Äf* as a subgraph? 
This would be substantially stronger than the conjecture of Hadwiger [1943]. An 
affirmative answer for k — 4 was given by Catlin [1979]. 
■ 
6.6. SCHEME CONJECTURE 
A Λ-scheme in a graph G consists of a subset X = 
{xi,x2,...,Xic}ofk 
different vertices of G together with (*) paths Ptj (1 < / < j < i) in G, 
where Pjj joins JC, and Xj and where P^ and PM are disjoint whenever i,j,h,l 
are all different. Does every ^-chromatic graph contain a it-scheme? 
■ 
The question was raised by P. Duchet and H. Meyniel at the Silver Jubilee 
Conference on Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo in 
1982 (see Duchet [1984b]). 

116 
The Conjectures of Hadwiger and Hajos 
If Hadwiger's conjecture is true, then the scheme conjecture is also true. Thus 
the scheme conjecture can be viewed as a weakened form of Hadwiger's conjecture. 
Conversely, for k = 5 the scheme conjecture implies the four-color theorem, as 
explained by Duchet [1984b], hence it also implies Hadwiger's conjecture for k = 5 
by the equivalence theorem of Wagner [1937] (Theorem 7 in Chapter 1). The scheme 
conjecture for k = 5, Hadwiger's conjecture for k = 5, and the four-color theorem 
are thus all equivalent. 
■ 
6.7. 
CHROMATIC 4-SCHEMES 
Let G be a 4-chromatic graph. Does there exist a 4-coloring f of G 
and four vertices χι,χ1,χ3,χΛ 
in G such that/(;t,) = / for / = 1,2,3,4 
and such that JC, and Xj are joined by a path Py in G whose vertices are 
alternately colored i and; for 1 < i < j < 4? Such a 4-coloring is called 
a chromatic 4-scheme. 
■ 
This question is due to Duchet [ 1984b], who proved that the corresponding state-
ment is not true for ^-chromatic graphs, for k 2: 5, when generalizing the definition 
of a chromatic 4-scheme in the obvious way to a chromatic ^-scheme for k s 5. For 
k < 3 the corresponding statement for any Λ-chromatic graph is true. 
For the more restricted class of ^-critical graphs, the statement that any such graph 
allows a chromatic λ-scheme is false for each value of k for which the /t-chromatic 
counterexample exhibited by Duchet [1984b] is also ^-critical. Duchet's examples 
were first published by Catlin [1979], and it follows from results of T. Gallai (see 
Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m and Toft [ 1981 ]) that these graphs are ^-critical (disregarding 
the special cases of complete graphs and odd cycles) if and only if k s 8 for * even, 
or k 2: 9 and not of the form 2" + 3 or 3 ■ 2a + 3 for k odd. We do not know any 
k-critical counterexamples for other values of k. In particular, we do not know if such 
examples exist for k = 4, 5,6,7, or 13. 
A further weakening of the question for general k s 4 was conjectured by 
Duchet and H. Meyniel (see Duchet [1984b]): Is it true that every Λ-chromatic graph 
G contains a subgraph G' such that G' has a chromatic ^-scheme? G' does not have 
to be fc-chromatic. For k = 5 even this statement implies the four-color theorem (see 
Problem 6.6). 
■ 
6.8. 
ODD SUBDIVISIONS OF K4 
Does every 4-chromatic graph contain a subdivision of K4 in which each 
of the six paths replacing the edges of K4 has odd length? 
■ 
This question was raised by Toft [1975b]. Since then it has appeared elsewhere 
(e.g. in Thomassen [1988]) and it was mentioned by P.D. Seymour at the Graph 
Minors Workshop in Seattle, 1991 (see West [1991b]). 
Catlin [1979] proved that a 4-chromatic graph has a subdivision in which each 
of the four triangles of the K4 is transformed into an odd cycle. This requires at least 

Kostochka's Conjecture on Hadwiger Number 
117 
two of the six paths to be odd. Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m and Toft [1980] proved that 
at least the three paths corresponding to the edges of a Kj, subgraph of K4 can be 
chosen to be odd; moreover, Thomassen and Toft [1981] proved that three edges of 
any spanning tree of K4 can be left undivided, corresponding to paths of length one. 
It seems unknown if four of the six paths replacing the edges of ÄT4 can be chosen to 
be odd. Recently, Jensen and Shepherd [1993] answered Toft's question affirmatively 
for line graphs and for 4-critical graphs of minimum degree three. 
■ 
6.9. NONSEPÄRÄTING ODD CYCLES IN 
4-CRITICAL GRAPHS 
Is it true that every 4-critical graph G contains an odd cycle C without 
diagonals such that G — V(C) is connected and has at most two end 
blocks? 
■ 
The question was asked by Krusenstjerna-Hafstr0m and Toft [1980], who proved 
that there exists a C such that G — V(C) is connected. Moreover, they gave an example 
showing that there does not always exist a C such that G - V(C) is 2-connected. 
If true, the statement above would imply that every 4-chromatic graph contains a 
special subdivision of ΑΓ4 in which the three edges of any spanning tree of K4 are left 
undivided and at least one of the remaining three edges is replaced by an odd path 
(see also Problem 6.8). 
■ 
6.10. MINIMAL EDGE CUTS IN 
CONTRACTION-CRITICAL GRAPHS 
Let G be a contraction-critical ^-chromatic graph (k ^ 5), that is, x(G) = 
k, and if H is any proper minor of G, then χ(Η) < k (see also Problem 
6.1). Let £ be a minimal edge cut of G with G\ and G2 the two connected 
components of G - E, and let n < k/2. If \E\ ^ nk - n2, is it then true 
that |V(G,)| ^ n — 1 for either i = 1 or i — 2 except precisely when 
|£| = nk- n2 and G = Kkf 
■ 
The question is due to Toft [1972a], who proved that the answer is affirmative for 
1 < n ^ 3. Note that if Hadwiger's conjecture is true (i.e., every it-chromatic graph 
can be contracted into a graph containing Kk as a subgraph, see Problem 6.1), then 
G = Kk and the answer is affirmative. 
■ 
6.11. KOSTOCHKA'S CONJECTURE ON 
HADWIGER NUMBER 
Let G be any graph on n vertices. The Hadwiger number 17(G) is defined 
as the maximum number of vertices in a complete graph into which a 
subgraph of G can be contracted. If G has Hadwiger number k, is it true 

118 
The Conjectures of Hadwiger and Hajos 
that 
where G denotes the complement of G and c* is a constant depending 
only on kl 
■ 
This was conjectured by Kostochka [1989] (see also Stiebitz [1992]). The lower 
bound is the best possible, as can be seen from the graphs consisting of disjoint unions 
of complete graphs Kk. 
The conjecture of Hadwiger [ 1943] may be formulated in terms of the Hadwiger 
number: Is it true that \(G) £ TJ(G)? Hadwiger's conjecture would imply the conjec-
ture due to Duchet and Meyniel [1982], that the following question has an affirmative 
answer: If a(G) denotes the maximum size of an independent set of vertices in G, is 
it true that 
a(G) · T)(G) > nt 
Kostochka [1989] noted that his conjecture would imply Duchet and Meyniel's 
conjecture. 
Nordhaus and Gaddum [1956] proved the following inequality relating the chro-
matic number of G to the chromatic number of G's complement G: 
X(G) + 
X(G)^n+l. 
Zelinka [1976] asked if the similar inequality holds for the Hadwiger number, that 
is, is it true that 
7j(G) + TJ(G) < n + 1? 
This question was answered in the negative by Kostochka [1981]. However, Kos-
tochka did prove, for n > 5, the best possible bound 
T,(G) + T,(G)^yJ. 
Stiebitz [ 1992] considered the general problem of finding lower and upper bounds 
for 17(G) when TJ(G) is fixed. He settled Kostochka's conjecture for k s 3 by proving 
that if 2 <k < 3, then 
(k+\\ 
k+\ 
For k = 2 this inequality was first proved by Kostochka [1989].

■ 7.1. BLANCHE DESCARTES' TRIANGLE-FREE GRAPHS 
The graphs Gk (k a 3) of Blanche Descartes are defined as follows. G3 is 
an odd cycle. Gi+i hasasetXof£(|VXG*)| - 1) + 1 independent vertices 
and (|ν[^)ΐ) mutually disjoint copies of Gk (all disjoint from X as well). 
Each copy of Gk corresponds to a unique subset of X of size | V(Gk)\ and 
the copy and the subset are joined in Gk+\ by |^(G*)| disjoint edges. Are 
the graphs Gk+i thus obtained (k + l)-critical? 
■ 
If G3 is the 7-cycle, then each Gk has minimum cycle length at least 6 and 
moreover satisfies x(Gk) 2 k. This is the famous construction of Descartes [1947, 
1948b, 1954] of triangle-free jt-chromatic graphs (see Theorem 21 in Chapter 1). 
After presenting the argument for x(Gk) > k, Descartes wrote: "This does not prove 
that Gk is k-chromatic, but if it is not we can obtain a k-chromatic graph from it by 
deleting some vertices and their incident edges." It seems likely, however, that Gk is 
in fact Jt-critical. This question was mentioned by Toft [1970b]. For the other early 
constructions of triangle-free λ-chromatic graphs by Zykov [1949] and Mycielski 
[1955], the criticality problem was solved by Schäuble [1969]. 
It is easy to see that G4 is 4-critical. Suppose that Gk is ^-critical for some t s 4 , 
Then Gk+\ is (k + l)-critical if the following question has a positive answer. Let 
/ : V(Gk) —♦ {1,2,..., k} be a nonconstant mapping. Does there exist a ^-coloring 
φ of Gk with colors 1,2,..., k such that φ(χ) Φ f(x) for all vertices x £ V(Gk)l 
The answer for ^-critical graphs in general is NO, as shown by B.Aa. S0rensen for 
k > 5 (see Toft [1974a]) and by V. Rödl and Stiebitz [1987b] for the case k = 4, 
even with / taking only three different values. T. Gallai observed that the answer for 
k-critical graphs in general is YES when / takes only two different values [personal 
communication in 1969] (see Toft [1974a]).

7.2. GRÜNBAUM'S GIRTH PROBLEM 
Does there exist a ^-chromatic ^-regular graph without triangles for k = 5 
and it = 6? 
■ 
Grünbaum [1970a] conjectured more generally that for k S: 3 and g ^ 4 there is 
a fc-chromatic fc-regular graph without cycles of length less than g, that is, a graph of 
girth at least g. 
The conjecture of Grünbaum was disproved for k a 7 and g ^ 4 indepen-
dently at about the same time by Borodin and Kostochka [1977], Catlin [1978a], and 
Lawrence [1978] (see Section 1.10 and Problem 4.6). For the cases (k,g) = (4,4) 
and (k,g) = (4,5) positive answers were given by Chvätal [1970b] and Grünbaum 
[1970a]. Kostochka [1978a] proved that there is no 5-chromatic graph of maximum 
degree five with shortest cycle of length at least 35. Also, for 6-chromatic graphs 
Grünbaum's conjecture fails for g large enough. We do not know what the situation 
is for 4-chromatic graphs. 
■ 
7.3. SMALLEST TRIANGLE-FREE Λ-CHROMATIC GRAPHS 
Let n(k) denote the smallest possible number of vertices in a ^-chromatic 
graph without triangles. What is the order of magnitude of «(&)? Is 
n(k + 1) < 2n{k) for all k > 4? What is the value of n{k) for k = 6? ■ 
The problem is due to Erdös [1967]. 
The constructions of Descartes [ 1954], Kelly and Kelly [ 1954], Mycielski [ 1955], 
and Zykov [1949] all give at least exponential upper bounds for n(k), the best being 
Mycielski's construction showing that n(k) ^ 3 · 2k~2 - 1. For k = 2,3, and 4, in fact, 
equality holds: n(2) = 2, n(3) = 5, and w(4) =11. For k = 5 Grinstead, Katinsky, 
and Van Stone [1989] showed that 21 < n(5) £ 22, and Jensen and Royle [1989] 
found that, in fact, n(5) = 22. From this and Mycielski's construction it follows that 
n(6) < 2n(5) + 1 = 45. We do not know if n(k + 1) < 2n(k) for all k > 5. 
Erdös was the first to give polynomial upper bounds. A geometric construc-
tion of Erdös [1958] shows n(k) < c ■ k50, where c is constant, as explained by 
Sachs [1969]. The probabilistic method of Erdös [1959, 1961] gives even better 
bounds. The lower bound [(logw)/(41ogfc)J for the maximal girth of a graph on 
n vertices of chromatic number at least k (see Theorem 22 in Chapter 1 and the 
discussion following it) implies that n(k) s kx6. In fact, Erdös [1961] proved by 
probabilistic arguments the existence of a constant c\ such that for all n & 2 there 
is a triangle-free graph G on n vertices with a(G) < c\ ■ y/n · log«, where a(G) is 
the size of a largest independent set of vertices in G. This G has chromatic number 
k, where 
k > n/a{G)

Therefore, 
n(k) <c\-k2·

< c2 · /t2 · log2(*16). 
It follows that there is a constant c2 such that for all k 
n(k)^c2-{k-\ogk)2. 
As far as a lower bound for n(k) is concerned, using the Ramsey result in the 
classical paper by Erdös and Szekeres [1935] that r(3, t) < t{l + l)/2 (i.e., that any 
graph on i(f. + 1 )/2 vertices either has a triangle or ί independent vertices), it follows 
that n(k) > k(k - l)/2 + 1. (Explanation: A triangle-free graph G on k(k - l)/2 
vertices has a set X\ of k - 1 independent vertices. Color all vertices in X\ by the 
color 1. The triangle-free graph G - X\ has (k - l)(k - 2)/2 vertices and a set X2 
dik-2 
independent vertices. Color all vertices inX2 by the color 2. Continue like 
this to obtain a (k - l)-coloring.) 
The bound on the Ramsey number r(3,t) was improved by Graver and Yackel 
[1968] and by Ajtai, Komlos, and Szemerodi [1980], who proved that there is a 
positive constant C3 such that any triangle-free graph G on n vertices has at least 
C3 ■ yjn log n independent vertices. This implies, as we shall indicate below, the lower 
bound in 
c5 · k2 ■ log k < n(k) <c2-(k- 
log kf. 
(*) 
Thus the order of magnitude of nik) is almost determined. 
Let us explain how the lower bound of (*) can be obtained. We do this in some 
more detail than in the interesting paper by Erdös and Hajnal [1985] (note that this 
paper contains a misprint in the formulation of (*)). We begin by making the following 
general observation. 
Proposition. Let Q be a class of graphs that is closed under taking induced sub-
graphs. Suppose that a(G) > f(\V(G)\)for 
all G E Q, where f : [2, °°) -» R+ is a 
positive, nondecreasing, continuous function. Then 
holds for every GGQ with \V(G)\ > 2. 

Smallest Triangle-Free it-Chromatic Graphs

Proof. The proof is by induction over the number of vertices n ^ 2. For n = 2 the 
result is obviously true. Assume that it is true for graphs with fewer than n vertices 
and let \V(G)\ = n. Let X be an independent subset of V(G) of size a(G). Then if 
\X\ ^ n — 1, G must clearly be bipartite. Otherwise, G — X has at least 2 vertices, 
and by induction hypothesis

> X(G) - 1 - 2 + 1 
= X(G) - 2. 
This proves the result. Observe that what we do here is to use a greedy coloring of G: 
color as many vertices as possible with color 1, then as many as possible with color 
2, etc. 
■ 
With Q the class of triangle-free graphs and f(x) — C3 · yfxlogx it follows for a 
triangle-free ^-chromatic graph on n vertices that

and hence that 
n S c5 · k2 · log n

which gives the lower bound of (*). 
Similar to asking for a smallest possible number of vertices in a triangle-free 
^-chromatic graph, one can ask for the smallest possible number ng(k) of vertices in 
a ^-chromatic graph without cycles of length less than g. Even for k = 4 and g = 5 
the answer is unknown. A 4-critical example showing «s(4) ^ 2 1 can be described as 
follows: The vertices are the integers 1,2,... ,21 with/and y joined by an edge if and 
only if either i + j = 0 modulo 3 and / — j = ± 1 modulo 7, or i + j = 1 modulo 3 
and i — j = ± 1, ±2, or ±3 modulo 21 [personal communication from D.A. Youngs 
in 1991].

7.4. LARGE BIPARTITE SUBGRAPHS OF 
TRIANGLE-FREE GRAPHS 
Let G be a triangle-free graph on n vertices. Is it possible to obtain a 
bipartite graph from G by deleting at most n2/25 edges? 
■ 
The question was asked by Erdös [1990a], who conjectured that the answer is 
affirmative. That the number n2/25 would be the best possible can be seen from a 
graph whose vertex set is the union of 5 disjoint classes U\ 
i/5 all of the same 
size m, such that U, is completely joined by m1 edges to £/,+1 (adding modulo 5) for 
i = 1.....5. 
Erdös, Faudree, Pach, and Spencer [1988] proved that every triangle-free graph 
G can be made bipartite by deleting at most n2/18 + n/2 edges, and they also 
proved that n2/25 edges are sufficient if G satisfies \E(G)\ s n2/5. Erdös, Györi, 
and Simonovits [1991] proved the stronger result that if L is any fixed 3-chromatic 
graph, and G is a graph having at least n2/5 - o(n2) edges and not containing L 
as a subgraph, then G can be made bipartite by removing at most n2/25 + o(n2) 
edges. 
Using a "greedy" algorithm, it is easy to find a subset of at most \ \E(G)\ edges 
of any graph G whose removal leaves a bipartite subgraph. Hence the conjecture by 
Erdös remains open only in the interval 
% < ««a < %■ 
The similar problem for triangle-free regular graphs has also been studied (see 
Locke [1990] for results and references). 
If G has no complete 4-graph K4 as a subgraph, it has been conjectured that G 
can be made bipartite by deleting at most (1/9 + o(l))n2 edges. This would be best 
possible, as can be seen from complete tripartite graphs with the same number of 
vertices in each class. This conjecture was mentioned by Erdös, Faudree, Pach, and 
Spencer [1988]. 
■ 
7.5. SPARSE SUBGRAPHS 
If G has a large chromatic number (depending on g and k), must G 
contain a subgraph with chromatic number at least k in which each cycle 
has length at least gl 
■ 
This question is due to A. Hajnal and Erdös [1969, 1971]. 
Rödl [1977] proved that for given k and n there exists a number <p(k,n), such 
that if G is a graph with chromatic number at least <p(k, ri), then G either contains 
a complete «-graph or G has a triangle-free A:-chromatic subgraph. This implies an 
affirmative answer to the question for g = 4, by the existence theorems for triangle-

7.6. 
NUMBER OF ODD CYCLE LENGTHS 
Let C0(G) denote the set of odd cycle lengths in a graph G: 
CoiQ) = {2m + 1 : G contains a cycle of length 2m + 1, for m S: 1}. 
If |C0(G)| = k, is it true that 
X(G) < 2k + 2, 
with equality if and only if G contains a complete graph on 2k + 2 vertices 
as a subgraph? 
■ 
This was conjectured by B. Bollobäs and P. Erdös (see Erdös [1990b]). Erdös 
[1990b] reported that for k = 1 the conjecture is true, as observed by Bollobäs and 
S. Shelah. 
An elegant argument by Neumann-Lara [1982] shows that every edge in a 
(2k + 3)-critical graph G is contained in a cycle of length 1 modulo 2m for all 
m in the interval 1 s m ^ k 4- 1. 
■ 
7.7. MAXIMUM GIRTH OF ft-CHROMATIC GRAPHS 
Let gk(n), where n > k ^ 4, be the maximum girth of ^-chromatic graphs 
on n vertices (i.e., there exists a ^-chromatic graph on n vertices in which 
all cycles have length at least g*(«), and gk(n) is the largest such number). 
Does 
gk(n)

Section 1.5)

The upper bound for gk(n) is easy to obtain by considering the distance classes 
with respect to any fixed vertex of a graph with the given three parameters. For k = 3 
one has that g^(ri) equals n for n odd, and n — 1 for n even. 

128 
Sparse Graphs 
Kostochka [1988] considered a very related problem: Let kg(n), where n ^ 
g > 4, be the maximum chromatic number of graphs on n vertices in which all cycles 
have length at least g. For g fixed, what is the asymptotic behavior of kg(n) as n —► o°? 
Kostochka proved that 
„l/Cg-D 
log« s kg(n) < n2/(«~2), 
where the upper bound is again derived from a simple argument involving distance 
classes. Note that the lower bound for kg(n) can be translated to a new lower bound for 
gk(n), which is asymptotically worse than the bound obtained by Erdös but improves 
it when n is small.

7.8. MAXIMUM RATIO χ/ω 
Let ft)(G) denote the number of vertices of a largest complete subgraph 
of G. Does the limit

7.9. CHROMATIC NUMBER OF SPARSE RANDOM GRAPHS 
For c > 0 constant, let Gc(ri) be a random graph on n vertices and with 
edge probability c/n; hence Gc(ri) has ~ cn/2 edges. What is the largest 
integer k = /(c) for which the probability that Gc(ri) has chromatic num-
ber exactly k has a nonzero limit as n —► °°? 
■ 
The question was asked by P. Erdös in the appendix, written by him, to the book 
by Alon and Spencer [1992]. For 0 < c < 1 it is known that /(c) = 3. This was 
proved by Luczak and Wierman [1989]. 
Erdös and Spencer [1974] (p. 96) gave as an exercise to prove that for every 
ε > 0 there exists c(e) such that Vc > c(e):

Thus the behavior of/(c) as c —► °° is roughly determined. Similar results, especially 
for edge probabilities c(n)/n, where c(w) is a function of n with c(n) —* °° and 
c(ri)/n —► 0 as n —► °°, can be found in Bollobäs [1985].

8.1. STRONG PERFECT GRAPH CONJECTURE 
A graph G is perfect if every induced subgraph H of G has chromatic 
number equal to the size of a maximum complete subgraph of H, 
χ(Η) = ω(Η) for every induced subgraph H of G. 
It is easy to see that a perfect graph is a Berge graph (i.e., neither G nor 
its complement G contains an odd cycle of length at least 5 as an induced 
subgraph). Is it true that G is perfect if and only if G is a Berge graph? ■ 
The question and the conjecture that the answer is affirmative is due to Berge 
[1963a, 1966] (and it was also discovered by P.C. Gilmore). For more details on the 
background of the problem, see Section 1.6. 
The corollary of the conjecture, now known as the perfect graph theorem, that 
G is perfect if and only if G's complement G is perfect, was proved by Lovasz 
[1972a, 1972b] (Theorem 24 in Chapter 1), who proved two different extensions of 
this statement. Concerning one of the proofs, Loväsz [1972b] wrote: "It should be 
pointed out that thus the proof consists of two steps and the more difficult second 
step was first carried out by Fulkerson!' The contributions of D.R. Fulkerson are 
contained and described in Fulkerson [1970, 1971,1972,1973]. 
Extending the perfect graph theorem, Loväsz [1972a] proved (Theorem 25 in 
Chapter 1) that a graph G is perfect if and only if every induced subgraph H of G 
satisfies 
a(H) ■ ω(Η) > \V(H)\. 
Thus to prove the strong perfect graph conjecture it suffices to prove that if G is a 
Berge graph, then a(G) · w(G) > |V(G)|. In particular, max{a(G), w(G)} would be 
at least IV(G)!1^2. It seems not even known if there is a positive constant ε such that 
max{a(G), OJ(G)} s |V(G)|E. This problem is due to L. Lovasz (see Erdös and Hajnal 
[1989]).

Perfect Graphs 
Several other equivalent versions of the strong perfect graph conjecture were 
given by Sachs [1970], Wessel [1977] and Chvatal [1984a], among others. The draft 
paper by Chvatal [1993] contains a wealth of interesting problems and results of 
many different types concerning perfect graphs and Berge graphs, and it is updated 
with recent new additions by several contributors. 
A version of the strong perfect graph conjecture in terms of vertex-critical graphs 
is due to Wessel [1977] (see also Toft [1985]): 
Conjecture. Let Gbea vertex-critical k-chromatic graph (k ^ 4) with the property 
that for all k' < k every induced vertex-critical k '-chromatic subgraph of G is the 
complete graph Kki. Then either G = Kk or G = C2k-i-
This version of the conjecture was proved for k = 4 by Tucker [1977a]. More-
over, Stiebitz [1987b] noted the truth of the partly stronger and partly weaker version 
where the condition "for all k' < k every induced vertex-critical jfc'-chromatic sub-
graph of G is the complete graph Kk" is replaced by "every vertex-critical (k — 1)-
chromatic subgraph of G is the complete graph Kk~ \." 
Parthasarathy and Ravindra [1976] proved the strong perfect graph conjecture 
for graphs not containing, as an induced subgraph, a 3-star Κ\$. Hence to prove, 
in the formulation given above, that either G = Kk or G = C2t-i> it1S sufficient to 
prove that G does not have a K\j as an induced subgraph. 
Many classes of perfect graphs are known (see Berge [1975], Golumbic [1980] 
or Loväsz [1983a]). Meyniel [1976] and independently Karapetyan and Markosyan 
[1976] proved a conjecture by Olaru [1972], that G is perfect if every odd cycle of G 
of length at least 5 has at least 2 diagonals. Such a graph G is often called a "Meyniel 
graph." Hoäng [1987] proved that a graph G is a Meyniel graph if and only if G is 
so-called "very strongly perfect"; that is, for every induced subgraph H of G, each 
vertex of H belongs to an independent set of vertices in H that intersects the vertex 
set of every maximal complete subgraph of//. 
A recent probabilistic result by Prömel and Steger [1992] shows that almost all 
Berge graphs are perfect.

8.2. 
MARKOSYAN'S PERFECT GRAPH PROBLEMS 
An edge xy of a graph G is said to be a-critical if a(G - xy) > a(G), 
where a(H) is the size of a maximum independent set of vertices in H. 
Let C be the set of vertices of a connected component of the subgraph 
of G formed by all α-critical edges. The subgraph of G induced by C 
is called an α-critical component of G. (Note that not all edges of the 
α-critical components are necessarily a-critical.) 
If G is a Berge graph (i.e., G contains neither odd cycles of length greater 
than or equal to 5 nor their complements as induced subgraphs), is it then 
true that all α-critical components of G are complete? 

Bold Conjecture 
133 
If all α-critical components of G and of all induced subgraphs of G are 
complete, is it then true that G is perfect? 
■ 
The two questions were raised by Markosyan [1981] (see also Math. Reviews 
87k:05082). As explained below, the statement that both questions have positive 
answers is equivalent to the strong perfect graph conjecture (Problem 8.1). 
In a sense Markosyan's problems break the strong perfect graph conjecture into 
two separate parts. This can be done using any property P for which (1) all perfect 
graphs have P, and (2) all graphs having P are Berge graphs. Then the strong perfect 
graph conjecture, that all Berge graphs are perfect, implies that (a) all Berge graphs 
have P, and (b) all graphs having P are perfect. On the other hand, (a) and (b) together 
imply the strong perfect graph conjecture. 
Markosyan's problems are (a) and (b) above with P the property that the a-critical 
components of G and of its induced subgraphs are all complete. This P satisfies (2) 
as is easily seen. To see that it satisfies (1), let G be perfect. Then the complement 
of G is perfect and G has a covering of all its vertices with a(G) disjoint complete 
subgraphs. For any α-critical edge xy the two vertices x and y are contained in the 
same one of the a(G) complete subgraphs, implying that all α-critical components 
are complete. 
■ 
8.3. 
BOLD CONJECTURE 
A pair of vertices (x, y) of a graph G is an co-critical pair if w(G + xy) > 
co(G), where G + xy denotes the graph obtained by adding the edge xy 
to G and ω(Η) is the size of a maximum complete subgraph in H. Let 
il(G) be the graph on the vertex set V(G) whose edges correspond to the 
ω-critical pairs of G. Prove or disprove the following conjecture: If G is a 
uniquely ^(G)-colorable perfect graph, then there exists some color class 
C (w.r.t. the unique coloring of G with x(G) colors) such that the induced 
subgraph il{G)[C] is connected. 
■ 
G. Bacso raised this conjecture, naming it the "bold conjecture," at the Interna-
tional Conference on Combinatorics dedicated to P. Erdös on his eightieth birthday 
and held in July 1993 in Keszthely, Hungary. 
The conjecture implies the strong perfect graph conjecture (Problem 8.1). The 
implication is not immediate, but Bacso indicated that it can be deduced from linear 
algebra results of Padberg [1974], implying that if G is a minimal imperfect graph, 
then for every vertex v E V(G) the graph G — υ is uniquely colorable with x(G) — 1 
colors. This statement was first explicitly stated and shown by Tucker [1977b] and 
later in a more general setting by Bland, Huang, and Trotter [1979]. These proofs 
were also based on linear algebra arguments, and no purely graph-theoretic proof 
seems known (see also Problem 8.8).

RASPAIL (SHORT-CHORDED) GRAPHS 
A graph G is called a Raspail graph (or a short-chorded graph) if every 
odd cycle of length at least 5 has a short diagonal, that is, an edge of the 
graph joining vertices of distance 2 apart on the cycle. Are Raspail graphs 
perfect?

These graphs were first studied around 1975-76 by C. Berge, P. Duchet, M. Las 
Vergnas, and H. Meyniel at the address 54 Boulevard Raspail in Paris. V. Chvätal 
therefore suggested the name Raspail graph (see Sun [1991]). 
A proof that every Raspail graph is perfect would generalize many known results, 
since the class of Raspail graphs contains many of the known classes of perfect 
graphs—on the other hand, it seems not contained in any of the well-known classes 
(see the paper by Lubiw [1991] for details). Partial results have been obtained by 
Lubiw [1991] and Sun [1991]. 
As explained by Lubiw [1991], the complements of Raspail graphs are exactly 
the graphs in which every odd cycle of length at least 5 has a "long diagonal," that 
is, an edge of the graph joining two vertices as far apart as possible on the cycle. 
In particular, Raspail graphs are special Berge graphs, and thus the truth of the 
strong perfect graph conjecture (Problem 8.1) would imply that all Raspail graphs 
are perfect. 
As a more restricted open problem, Lubiw [1991] asked for a proof that a Raspail 
graph is perfect if its complement is also a Raspail graph.

"SEMISTRONG" PERFECT GRAPH CONJECTURE 
Let the edges of a complete graph be (improperly) colored with colors 
red, green, and black in such a way that the red edges induce a subgraph 
that is perfect, as do the green edges. Suppose that the subgraph induced 
by the black edges is not perfect. Does there exist a K4 subgraph with 
its six edges colored so that each of the colors red and green induces a 
simple path of length at least 1, and the color black induces a simple path 
of length at least 2? 
■ 
Extending the perfect graph theorem of Loväsz [1972a, 1972b] (Theorem 24 in 
Chapter 1) that the complement of a perfect graph is perfect, Cameron, Edmonds, 
and Loväsz [ 1986] proved that if the edges of a complete graph are colored with three 
colors so that no triangle gets three different colors (such a coloring is sometimes 
called a "Gallai partition," e.g., in the paper by Körner, Simonyi, and Tuza [1992]), 
and if two of these colors each induces a perfect graph, then so does the third color. 
They made the conjecture that the answer to the question above is affirmative, in a 
different formulation, as a possible strengthening of Loväsz's theorem. 
Cameron, Edmonds, and Loväsz observed that the strong perfect graph con-
jecture would imply their conjecture, and that this conjecture in turn would imply 

Neighborhood Perfect Graphs 
135 
Loväsz's perfect graph theorem. A different conjecture of V. Chvätal having the 
same "semistrong" property was proved by B. Reed (see Section 1.6). Assigning 
colors to the edges of a complete graph subject to restrictions similar to those con-
sidered by Cameron, Edmonds, and Loväsz has applications in algebraic logic (see 
Tuza [1991]). The result of Cameron, Edmonds, and Loväsz has been generalized by 
Kömer, Simonyi, and Tuza [1992] in terms of additivity of a functional called "graph 
entropy." The generalization is based on an information-theoretic characterization of 
perfect graphs obtained by Csiszär, Körner, Loväsz, Marton, and Simonyi [1990]. 
(The connections to algebraic logic and information theory were pointed out to us by 
L. Loväsz [personal communication in 1993].)

8.6. 
HOÄNG'S CONJECTURE ON 2-COLORING EDGES 
The "leaves" of a path are the two edges incident to the vertices of degree 
one in the path. Is it true that a graph G is perfect if the edges of G can 
be (improperly) colored with two colors so that the two leaves of every 
induced path on four vertices receive different colors? 
■ 
The question is due to Hoäng [to appear] (it also appeared in Math. Reviews 
92i:05097). It is easy to see that a graph with an (improper) 2-coloring of the edges 
as described does not contain an odd cycle of length at least 5 nor its complement 
as an induced subgraph; that is, it must be a Berge graph. Hence the strong perfect 
graph conjecture would imply that the answer to the question is affirmative. 
Similarly, Chvätal [1993] has asked if it is true that a graph G is perfect if there 
exists an orientation of G in which the two leaves of any induced path on four vertices 
point in different directions on the path (such a G is called an "opposition graph"). 
Partial results were obtained by Olariu [1988]. 
■ 
8.7. 
NEIGHBORHOOD PERFECT GRAPHS 
A neighborhood in a graph G is a subgraph induced by a vertex and its 
neighbors in G. The maximum number of edges in G, no two of which 
belong to the same neighborhood, is denoted by aN(G). The minimum 
number of neighborhoods containing all edges of G is denoted by 
PN(G). 
If aN(G') — PN(G') for every induced subgraph G' of G, then G is called 
neighborhood perfect. Is it true that every neighborhood perfect graph is 
also perfect? 
■ 
This question is due to Lehel and Tuza [1986], who observed that neighborhood 
perfect graphs are in fact Berge graphs (but the converse is not true). Thus the question 
can be considered a special case of the strong perfect graph conjecture (Problem 8.1). 

136 
Perfect Graphs 
No polynomial algorithm for recognizing a neighborhood perfect graph seems known, 
and neither does a structural characterization of this class of graphs. 
■ 
8.8. MONSTERS 
A minimal imperfect graph can be defined as a graph G satisfying 
(a) x(G) > <u(G), and 
(b) for every proper subset X of V(G) the induced subgraph G[X] satisfies 
X(G[X]) = o>(G[X]). 
A minimal imperfect graph with a largest complete subgraph of size 
a>(G) ^ 3 and with a largest independent set of vertices of size a(G) a 3 
is called a "monster." 
Describe properties of monsters. For example: 
(1) Obtain lower bounds on the size of monsters. 
(2) Prove that a monster has two complete subgraphs of size ft>(G) with 
o>(G) — 1 vertices in common. 
(3) If C is a complete subgraph of G of size o>(G), prove that G - C is 
uniquely (^(G) - l)-colorable. 
(4) Prove that a monster has no odd pair of vertices (i.e., it has no pair 
of nonadjacent vertices such that every induced path between them 
has odd length). 
(5) Prove for all vertices x of a monster G that G — x has an even pair 
of nonadjacent vertices. 
■ 
The perfect graph theorem (Theorem 24 in Chapter 1) implies that the comple-
ment of a minimal imperfect graph is also minimal imperfect. A minimal imperfect 
graph G with w(G) = 2 is an odd cycle, and with a(G) = 2 an odd-cycle comple-
ment. Thus monsters are precisely minimal counterexamples to the strong perfect 
graph conjecture (Problem 8.1). According to Chvätal [1993], the term "monster" 
was suggested by P. Duchet. 
By Loväsz's extended perfect graph theorem (Theorem 25 in Chapter 1), minimal 
imperfect graphs G with \V(G)\ = n, <i)(G) = ω, and a(G) = a satisfy 
(c) n = 1 + αω, 
(d) for all vertices x of G the subgraph G - x has an ω-coloring with ω color 
classes of size a, and a covering with a disjoint complete ω-graphs. 
Graphs satisfying (c) and (d) are called (a, 6>)-graphs. Many examples of such graphs 
were presented by Chvätal, Graham, Perold, and Whitesides [1979]. 

Square-Free Berge Graphs 
137 
The following properties were first obtained for minimal imperfect graphs by 
Padberg [1974], then for (a, w)-graphs in general by Bland, Huang, and Trotter 
[1979]. 
(e) G has exactly n complete subgraphs of size ω and exactly n independent sets 
of size a, 
(f) every vertex of G is contained in exactly ω complete subgraphs of size ω 
and in exactly a independent sets of size a, 
(g) every complete subgraph of size ω is disjoint from exactly one independent 
set of size a, and vice versa. 
Moreover, Tucker [1977b] and Bland, Huang, and Trotter [1979] proved for (a, di-
graphs that 
(h) For all vertices of G the graph G — x is uniquely ω-colorable, and it has a 
unique cover with a disjoint complete subgraphs. 
The proofs of (e)-(h), both for minimal imperfect graphs and for (a, w)-graphs in 
general, were based on linear algebra arguments. Can more direct graph-theoretical 
proofs be given? The question is due to J. Fonlupt and mentioned by Chvätal [1993]. 
Many other properties of minimal imperfect graphs have been established by 
Chvätal [1985] and others (see Chvätal [1993]). Questions (l)-(5) above can all be 
found in the very interesting list of unsolved problems by Chvätal [1993], containing 
many additional questions. 
Lam, Swiercz, Thiel, and Regener [1979] established that monsters have at least 
21 vertices, and Chvätal [1993] reported that V.A. Gurvich and V.M. Udalov have 
increased this number to 25. Question (2) is due to Fonlupt and Sebo [1990] and 
question (3) to Sebö [1992], who proved that question (3) is equivalent to the strong 
perfect graph conjecture (Problem 8.1). Meyniel [1987] proved that no minimal 
imperfect graph contains an even pair. Question (4) was posed by Chvätal [1993], 
and question (5) by S. Hougardy.

8.9. 
SQUARE-FREE BERGE GRAPHS 
Let G be a graph whose induced subgraphs are neither odd cycles of 
length at least 5 nor the complements of odd cycles of length at least 5 
nor 4-cycles. Is it true that G is perfect? 
■ 
Gyärfäs [1987] reported that the question is due to J. Lehel, who noted that 
the answer is known to be affirmative when "4-cycle" is replaced by "//" for any 
graph H on 4 vertices, except H = 2K2 = C4, the complement of a 4-cycle. This 
was proved for H = AT4 by Tucker [1977a], for H = Κ^ (Κ^ minus an edge) by 
Parthasarathy and Ravindra [1979], and Tucker [1987] (who pointed out a mistake 
in the proof by Parthasarathy and Ravindra [1979]), for H = Ki3 by Parthasarathy 

138 
Perfect Graphs 
and Ravindra [1976], for H = f4 (the path with 4 vertices) by Seinsche [1974], 
and for the graph consisting of a K$ and a Kj with a vertex in common, it follows 
from a theorem of Meyniel [1976] and, independently, Karapetyan and Markosyan 
[1976]. For the remaining 4-vertex graphs it follows from the perfect graph theorem 
by Loväsz [1972a, 1972b] (Theorem 24 in Chapter 1), which states that G is perfect 
if and only if the complement G is perfect. 
In Lehel's question as stated above, the condition that G must not contain an 
induced subgraph that is the complement of an odd cycle is superfluous. This follows 
from the observations that the complement of a 5-cycle is a 5-cycle and that the 
complement of an odd cycle of length at least 7 contains C4 as an induced subgraph. 
Wagon [1980] proved that if G is any graph without C4 as an induced subgraph, 
then x(G) ^ w(G) · (<u(G) + l)/2. By the perfect graph theorem, the question by 
Lehel has an affirmative answer if and only if any G containing neither C4 nor the 
complement of an odd cycle of length at least 5 as an induced subgraph satisfies 
X(G) = o>(G). 
If one cannot prove that when G contains neither C4 nor any C2m+i> for « 5 2, 
as an induced subgraph, then \(G) = w(G), is it at least possible to prove x(G) ^ 
f(<u(G)) for some linear function /? Is there any function / for which it is possible 
to prove this? 
■ 
8.10. WEAKENED STRONG PERFECT 
GRAPH CONJECTURE 
Does there exist some function / such that for every Berge graph G, that 
is, for every graph G without an odd cycle of length at least 5 or the 
complement of such a cycle as an induced subgraph, 
X(G) 
< /(<Ü(G)), 
where a)(G) denotes the maximum size of a complete subgraph in G? ■ 
The strong perfect graph conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the best 
possible / one could hope for, namely f(x) = x, is a valid answer to this question. 
The much weaker conjecture, that some such / exists, was proposed by Gyärfäs 
[1987], who added that it is surprising that even this is not known. 
When asking this question, Gyärfäs suggested that one could try to prove one of 
the following stronger conjectures: 
Conjecture 1. There exists a function f\ such that for every graph G without any 
induced odd cycle of length at least 5 as a subgraph, x(G) ^ /i(w(G)). 
Conjecture 2. For every m > 2 there exists a function fm such that for every 
graph G without any induced odd cycle of length at least 2m + 1 as a subgraph, 
X(G) < /„(«(G)). 

Gyärfäs' Forbidden Subgraph Conjecture 
139 
A weaker version of Conjecture 2 was also suggested by Gyärfäs: 
Conjecture 3. For every I s 4 there exists a function gi such that for every graph 
G without a cycle of length at least I as an induced subgraph, x(G) £ gi(w(G)). 
Conjecture 3 holds for / = 4 with g4(x) = x, and this is equivalent to the state-
ment that triangulated (also called "chordal" or "rigid circuit") graphs are perfect 
(Hajnal and Suränyi [1958], Berge [1961], Dirac [1961]). For / > 5 the conjecture is 
open. 
■ 
8.11. GYÄRFÄS'FORBIDDEN SUBGRAPH CONJECTURE 
Let H be any graph and let Q(H) denote the set of all graphs not containing 
H as an induced subgraph. If F is a forest, does there exist a function 
fF, such that *(G) < /F(a>(G)) for all G G G(F), where a>(G) denotes the 
size of a maximum complete subgraph of G? 
■ 
The question was posed by Gyärfäs [ 1975], and independently by Sumner [1981]. 
A family Q of graphs is called χ-bound if there exists a function / such that 
X(G) s /(ÜJ(G)) 
for all 
G G Q. 
P. Erdös proved the existence, for all g > 0 and sufficiently large k > 0, of graphs 
Ggjc with xiGgj) — k and no cycles of length < g (Theorem 22 in Chapter 1). Hence 
if £(//) is a χ-bound family, it follows that H is a forest. Gyärfäs [1975] conjectured 
that the converse is also true. 
Kierstead and Penrice [1990] proved that if F is a forest, then Q{F) is χ-bound 
if and only if Q(T) is χ-bound for every connected component T of F. This was also 
proved by Sauer [1993]. 
Gyärfäs [1987] proved that for a star S on n > 3 vertices (i.e., S is the graph 
K\„-\ 
consisting of one vertex joined to n — 1 independent vertices), Q(S) is a 
χ-bound family and /·? satisfies 
r ( w - l . j c + l ) - l 
, 
— 
—z—-— 
s fs(x) s r(n - 
l,x), 
n — 2 
where r is the Ramsey function: r (p, q) is the smallest number such that every graph 
on r(p, q) vertices either contains a complete graph on p vertices or an independent 
set of q vertices. Gyärfäs [1987] also proved that if Pn denotes the path on n vertices 
for n > 2, then G(Pn) is χ-bound, and 
/ f , W s ( « - i r ' . 
A graph B is called a "broom" if B can be obtained from a path and a star 
by identifying an end-vertex of the path with a vertex of the star. Gyärfäs [1987] 

140 
Perfect Graphs 
remarked that it is possible to extend the results above on stars and paths and prove 
that Q(B) is ^-bound for any broom B. It has been proved by Kierstead and Penrice 
[1994] that Q{T) is χ-bound for every tree T of radius at most two (i.e., there is a 
vertex in T of distance at most two from every other vertex). For triangle-free graphs, 
the positive answers for brooms and radius two trees were first obtained by Gyärfäs, 
Szemeredi, and Tuza [1980]. 
A generalization of Gyärfäs' problem is to ask, given a collection of graphs G,· 
for 1 s / < »i, if there is an upper bound for the chromatic numbers of the family of 
graphs Q(G\ ,Gi,..., Gm) without any of the given graphs as an induced subgraph. For 
example, the conjecture of Gyärfäs and Sumner says that Q(K„, T) has this property 
for any number n and any tree T. Kierstead and Rödl [1993] proved that the family 
G(K„,Kn„, T) is χ-bound for any n and any tree T, where Kn<n denotes the complete 
bipartite graph with « vertices on each side. As an approximation to Gyärfäs and 
Sumner's conjecture, Sauer [1993] suggested a problem of showing that there is an 
odd cycle C such that Q(K„, T, C) is χ-bound, assuming that Q(K„, T) is not χ-bound.

8.12. QUASIPERFECT GRAPHS 
Let G be an orientation of a graph G, where an edge e of G may correspond 
to two directed edges of G joining the same pair of vertices as e, one in 
each direction. A subset S C V(G) is called a kernel of G if 
(a) S is independent in G, and 
(b) for every vertex x of G with x £ S, there is a directed edge xy in G 
such that y E S. 
An orientation G of G is called "normal" (or sometimes "admissible") if 
every complete subgraph of G has a kernel in G (necessarily consisting 
of a single vertex). 
G is "quasiperfect" (sometimes called "nearly perfect" or "solvable") if 
for every normal orientation of G, all induced subgraphs have kernels. 
Conjecture 1. Every perfect graph is quasiperfect. 
Conjecture 2. Every quasiperfect graph is perfect. 
■ 
In May 1987 at the Nato Advanced Research Workshop on Cycles and Rays 
held in Montreal, C. Berge mentioned that Conjecture 1 had been raised by Berge 
and Duchet in 1979, and that Conjecture 2 had been raised by Berge and Duchet in 
1982. Conjecture 1 was also mentioned by Berge [1985] (page 325), and it appeared 
in Berge and Duchet [1988a]. Conjecture 2 appeared in print in Berge and Duchet 
[1988b]. 

Perfect Graph Recognition 
141 
A quasiperfect graph is a Berge graph, since there is no kernel for the (normal) 
orientation of an odd cycle into a directed cycle, and similarly for the complement 
of an odd cycle. Hence the truth of the strong perfect graph conjecture (Problem 8.1) 
would imply Conjecture 2. Conversely, if it could be proved that a Berge graph 
is always quasiperfect, then Conjecture 2 would imply the strong perfect graph 
conjecture. 
A weaker question than the conjunction of Conjecture 1 and Conjecture 2 was 
also mentioned by Berge in 1987: Is it true that the complement of a quasiperfect 
graph is quasiperfect? This would follow from Conjecture 1 and Conjecture 2 by the 
perfect graph theorem of Loväsz [1972a, 1972b] (Theorem 24 in Chapter 1), that G 
is perfect if and only if G is perfect. 
Kernels in directed graphs were studied by König [ 1936] (using the term "Punkt-
basis zweiter Art"), by von Neumann and Morgenstern [1944], and by Richardson 
[1953], who proved that every directed graph without odd directed cycles has a kernel. 
For graphs G such that every odd cycle (x\,X2,... ,X2k+\>xi) (k — 2) has two 
diagonals XiX,+2 and *ί+ι·*;+3 (adding subscripts modulo 2k + 1) Conjecture 1 is 
true, as proved by Duchet and Meyniel [1983]. Conjecture 1 was proved by Maffray 
[1984,1986] for graphs G such that every cycle in G of length at least 4 has a diagonal 
(i.e., G is triangulated, also called "chordal" or "rigid circuit"), or every odd cycle of 
G of length at least 5 contains two noncrossing diagonals (sometimes such a graph 
is called a "Gallai graph"). Blidia [1986] proved Conjecture 1 for parity graphs (a 
graph is a parity graph if it allows an orientation such that for every pair of vertices 
x, y, where χ Φ y, all vertex-minimal directed paths from x to v have lengths of the 
same parity). Champetier [1989] proved Conjecture 1 for comparability graphs (the 
vertices of such a graph are the elements of a partially ordered set, with two of them 
adjacent in the graph if and only if they are comparable). A similar result for a more 
special class of perfect graphs was obtained by Blidia and Engel [1992]. 
Maffray [1992] proved that Conjecture 1 and Conjecture 2 are both true for line 
graphs. The line graph L(G) of a graph G is the graph with vertex set V(L(G)) = E(G) 
and two vertices of L(G) joined by an edge of L(G) if and only if they are adjacent 
edges in G. Hence a line graph is perfect if and only if it is quasiperfect. Perfect line 
graphs have been completely characterized by Trotter [1977], who proved that L(G) 
is perfect if and only if G has no odd cycles of length at least 5. 
It seems unknown if the perfect graphs by Meyniel [1976], in which every 
odd cycle of length at least 5 has at least two diagonals, are quasiperfect. It seems 
also unknown if the perfect "weakly triangulated" graphs by Hay ward [1985] are 
quasiperfect; these are the graphs with the property that no induced subgraph is a 
cycle of length at least 5 (regardless of its parity) or the complement of such a cycle. 
Blidia, Duchet, and Maffray [1993] proved that when joining an independent set of 
vertices completely to a quasiperfect graph the resulting graph is again quasiperfect.

PERFECT GRAPH RECOGNITION 
Is there a polynomial algorithm to decide if any given graph G is perfect? 
That is, does there exist a polynomial algorithm to determine for any G 

142 
Perfect Graphs 
whether every induced subgraph H of G satisfies χ{Η) = ω(Η), where 
ω(Η) is the maximum size of a complete subgraph in HI 
Is it an JVP-problem to decide whether a given graph G is perfect? That 
is, if G is perfect, does there exist a certificate of this fact that can be 
checked in polynomial time in the size of G? 
■ 
The problem of polynomial recognition of perfect graphs has been studied by a 
number of people (see, e.g., Loväsz [1983a], Whitesides [1984], Grötschel, Loväsz, 
and Schrijver [1988], and Tuza [1990]). Chvätal, Lenhart, and Sbihi [1990] specifi-
cally addressed the second question "Are perfect graphs in NP?" Many algorithmic 
questions for perfect graphs were answered by Grötschel, Loväsz, and Schrijver 
[ 1981 ]; among other results they proved that the chromatic number of a perfect graph 
can be determined in polynomial time. 
Based on the results of Loväsz [1972a] and Padberg [1974], it can be proved that 
the decision problem "is G a perfect graph?" belongs to the class co-NP (see Loväsz 
[1983a]); that is, if G is not perfect, then there exists a certificate of this fact that can 
be checked in polynomial time in the size of G (see Garey and Johnson [1979] for 
the precise definitions of NP and co-NP). 
Assuming the strong perfect graph conjecture is true, then proving that a graph 
G is perfect is equivalent to demonstrating that both G and its complement G have 
no odd cycles of length at least 5 as induced subgraphs. However, it seems open if 
the decision problem "Is G without induced odd cycles of length at least 5?" belongs 
to NP. Clearly, the problem belongs to the class co-NP. Shmoys [1981] proved that 
it is JW-complete to decide, for a given graph G and given integer k, if G has an 
induced odd cycle of length at least k (also, Reed [1990] mentioned this result). A 
related result was obtained by Bienstock [1991], who proved that the decision prob-
lem, with G and a vertex x G V(G) given as input, "Is there an induced odd cycle of 
length at least 5 in G passing through xV is WP-complete. The results of Shmoys and 
Bienstock seem to indicate that it is a difficult problem to decide if a graph contains 
an induced odd cycle of length at least 5. Nevertheless, it may still be a polynomi-
al^ solvable problem to decide if a graph or its complement has such an induced 
cycle. 
For each class Q of graphs in Table 8.1, all graphs in Q are perfect graphs, and 
there is a polynomial algorithm to decide if any given graph G belongs to Q. More 
results on special classes of perfect graphs can be found in Golumbic [1980] and in 
a survey by Duchet [1984a]. 
Lubiw [1991] considered the class of graphs in which every odd cycle 
{x\,xi, ■.. ,X2k+\) (k s 2) has a "short diagonal" (i.e., an edge *,·*,-+2 adding indices 
modulo {2k + 1)) and asked if there exists a polynomial time recognition algorithm 
for this class of graphs. 
For each class of graphs Q in Table 8.2, it is known that the strong perfect graph 
conjecture holds for Q. That is, if G G Q, then G is perfect if and only if G is a Berge 
graph. For some of these classes G, it is an open problem if there exists a polynomial 
time algorithm to recognize the graphs G in Q that are perfect.

tope"—the convex hull in RV(G) of the set of (0, l)-valued incidence 
vectors of the independent sets of vertices in G. That is, Pi(G) is the 
convex hull of all vectors of the form (xv = δνΧ : ν G V(G)), where 
X C V(G) is independent in G, and 
- 
_ f 1 
if v G X 
bvX'\0 
iiv^X. 
Let Q(G) denote the set of vectors (xv : v G V(G)) in RV(G) satisfying the 
set of inequalities (a)-(c): 
(a) 0 < xv < 1 for all v G V(G) 
(b) xu + xv < 1 for all uv G E(G) 
(c) X K : » £ C } < (\C\ - l)/2 for all vertex sets C of odd cycles in G. 
The incidence vector (xv = 8ViX : v G V(G)) of any independent set 
X C V(G) satisfies (a), (b), and (c), hence P,(G) C ß(G). G is called 
i-perfect if the inclusion holds with equality, P/(G) - Q(G). 
Is it possible to characterize /-perfect graphs in purely graph-theoretic 
terms? 
Is every r-perfect graph 4-colorable? 
■ 
Chvätal [1975] first considered i-perfect graphs, and he conjectured that every 
series-parallel graph, that is, a graph without a subgraph that can be obtained from 
K4 by subdivisions of edges (see Dirac [1952a]), is /-perfect. We note that Af4 is not a 
/-perfect graph, since (5.3.5.5) belongs to Q{K4) but not to Ρι{Κ4). The conjecture 
by Chvätal [1975] was proved by Boulala and Uhry [1979], and their result was 
improved by Gerards and Schrijver [1986], who showed that a graph G is /-perfect if 
none of its subgraphs is an "odd K4"—a graph H obtained from K4 by subdivisions 
of edges such that every triangle becomes an odd cycle in H. 
Catlin [1979] proved that if G has no odd ΑΓ4 as a subgraph, then G is 3-colorable. 
A.M.H. Gerards and F.B. Shepherd [personal communication in 1993] extended the 
result of Gerards and Schrijver [ 1986] by proving that any graph G without an odd ΑΓ4 
as a subgraph is "strongly /-perfect"; that is, every subgraph of G, whether induced 
or not, is /-perfect. They then extended Catlin's result by proving that any strongly 
/-perfect graph is 3-colorable. 
F.B. Shepherd [personal commpnication in 1992] conjectured that P/(G) has the 
"integer decomposition property" (see Schrijver [1986]) for any /-perfect graph G. 
This would imply that the constant vector x = (|, |,..., 5), which satisfies (a), (b),

and (c) and hence belongs to P/(G), can be written as a sum 
X= 
--(Χχ 
+ Χγ + Xz), 
where χχ,χγ,χζ 
G P/(G) have integer coordinates. Now by (a) and the definition of 
Pi(G), Χχ,Χγ, xz are the incidence vectors of independent sets Χ,Υ,Ζ C V(G) that 
partition V(G), hence G would be 3-colored. However, M. Laurent and A. Schrijver 
disproved Shepherd's conjecture by exhibiting a 4-chromatic f-perfect graph. It re-
mains unknown if every i-perfect graph is 4-colorable [personal communication from 
Shepherd in 1994]. 
Grötschel, Loväsz, and Schrijver [1988] gave a discussion of i-perfect graphs, 
and they remarked that the decision problem "Is G a /-perfect graph?" is in co-NP, 
but not known to be in NP or in P (see Garey and Johnson [1979] for definitions). 
Combining the results of Loväsz [1972b] and Fulkerson [1970, 1973], Chvätal 
[1975] showed that a graph G is perfect if and only if P/(G) is determined by the 
following two sets of inequalities: 
xv > 0 
for all v G V(G), and 
(d) Σ{χν : v G C} ^ 1 for all vertex sets C of complete subgraphs of G. 
A graph G is called A-perfect (see Grötschel, Loväsz, and Schrijver [1988]) if P/(G) 
is determined by the inequalities (a), (c), and (d). Thus both perfect graphs and t-
perfect graphs are A-perfect. Grötschel, Loväsz, and Schrijver [1986] proved that if 
G is A-perfect, then it is possible to find a maximum independent set of vertices of G 
in polynomial time. We do not know if the chromatic number of an A-perfect graph 
can be determined polynomially.

9.1. HADWIGER-NELSON PROBLEM 
Let G be the infinite graph with all the points of the plane as vertices and 
having xy as an edge if and only if the points x and y have distance 1. 
What is the chromatic number \(G) of G?

Soifer [1991, to appear] has investigated the history of this problem. It was 
first thought of in 1950 by E. Nelson, who noted that x(G) 2 4.A fellow student, 
J. Isbell, also in 1950, noted that x(G) ^ 7. Isbell communicated the problem to 
several people, among them V. Klee, who passed it on to H. Hadwiger (Hadwiger 
[1961]). Eventually, it was published for the first time by Gardner [I960]. Erdös 
[1981] mentioned the problem as one of his favorites. A comprehensive survey was 
presented recently by Chilakamarri [1993], and another will be given by Soifer [to 
appear], 
Hadwiger [1945] proved, as a special case of a result for higher-dimensional 
Euclidian space, that if the points of the plane are partitioned into five congruent 
closed sets, then at least one of the sets contains for every positive real number d a 
pair of points of distance d. He also proved that the corresponding statement for a 
partitioning into seven sets is false, and in fact his argument shows that x(G) s 7. 
This is demonstrated by a tessellation of the plane by regular hexagons of diameter 1 
(or slightly less than 1) and a 7-coloring in which the interior points of each hexagon 
all get the same color (and boundary points get one of the adjacent colors). 
To argue the bound 4 s \(G), suppose to the contrary that the plane has a 3-
coloring. Then a diamond, consisting of two equilateral triangles ABC and BCD of 
sidelength 1 and sharing the side BC, shows that any two points A and D of distance 
V3 must have the same color. Then an isosceles triangle ADE with sidelengths 
\AD\ = \DE\ = V3 and \AE\ = 1 gives a contradiction, as A, D, and E must all have 
the same color, which is impossible since A and £ have distance 1. Thus there is a 
system of only seven points in the plane that already requires four colors. This 7-point 
configuration was first published by Moser and Moser [1961].

Hadwiger-Nelson Problem 
151 
G is an infinite graph, but by the theorem of N.G. de Bruijn and P. Erdös 
(Theorem 1 in Chapter 1) it contains a finite ^(G)-chromatic subgraph. It is therefore 
sufficient to consider the chromatic numbers of the finite subgraphs of G. 
Croft [1967] considered how "dense" a plane set with no two points of unit 
distance can be. The density δ of such a set is defined as the maximum possible 
limit of the ratio between the measure of its intersection with a very large disc and 
the disc's area. Croft [1967] showed 0.2293 < 8 < 0.2857. To obtain a four-color 
theorem for the Hadwiger-Nelson problem thus seems out of reach; not even a set 
that realizes no unit distance and covers 25% of the plane has been found. 
Erdös asked if there is a g such that if G' is a subgraph of G in which all cycles 
have length at least g, then G' is 3-colorable. Wormald [1979] proved that such a g 
must be at least 5. 
The Hadwiger-Nelson problem may be considered as the overlapping and equal-
size case of Ringel's circle problem (Problem 9.2). 
Hadwiger and Debrunner [ 1960] mentioned that A. Heppes studied a very similar 
problem around 1958, inspired by a suggestion of Erdös. Consider the smallest 
number of colors in a coloring of the points of the plane such that no color class 
realizes all distances. This is called the "polychromatic" number of the plane, denoted 
by χρ (see Soifer [1992b]). In the Hadwiger-Nelson problem we are looking for a 
coloring of the plane such that each color class does not realize the distance 1. In 
the problem of determining the polychromatic number we look for colorings of the 
plane where each color class / does not realize some distance 4. Such a coloring of 
the plane with k colors is said to be of type (d\, άι 
<4). (The notion of "type" was 
first introduced by Soifer [1992a, 1992b].) Raisktf [1970] noted that 
where the upper bound is due to S.B. Stechkin (see Soifer [1992b]). This was 
also proved by Woodall [1973] in an interesting paper on problems related to 
the chromatic number of the plane. Soifer [1992a, 1992b] obtained a 6-coloring 
of type (1,1,1,1,1,1/V5), and Hoffman and Soifer [1993] obtained one of type 
(1,1,1,1,1,^2- 1). Recently, Soifer [1994] proved that for any r in the interval 
[y/2 - 1,1/V5] there is a coloring of type (1,1,1,1, l.r). 
By induction it is easy to see that G contains d-regular finite subgraphs Gj for 
all d: Obtain Gd from two copies of Gj-1, such that one is translated a distance of 1 
away from the other in some suitably chosen direction. Thus by an application of a 
theorem of N. Alon (see Section 1.9), it follows that the list-chromatic number of G 
is infinite (but we do not know if it is Xo)· 
The problem has also been generalized and considered in higher dimensions. Let 
G„ denote the graph obtained by joining points at unit distance in «-dimensional real 
space. It is known that 
5 < x ( G 3 ) ^ 2 1 , 
where the lower bound follows from a general result of Ralskii [1970], who proved 
that in any decomposition of R" into n + 1 sets, all distances are realized in one set 

152 
Geometrie and Combinatorial Graphs 
of the decomposition. The upper bound 21 is an easy generalization of the argument 
above for R2 (see also Szekely and Wormald [1989]). The best known general bounds 
on \{Gn) are 
(1 + 0(1)) · (6/5)" < x(G„) < (3 + o(l))". 
The upper bound was obtained by Larman and Rogers [1972], and the lower bound 
by Frankl and Wilson [1981], thus solving a problem of Erdös, who asked if x(G„) 
grows exponentially with n. (See the papers by Erdös and Simonovits [1980], Erdös 
[1981], and Szekely and Wormald [1989] for further results and references.) 
The corresponding problem with the vertex set restricted to the set of points 
in n dimensions with rational coordinates has also been studied (see the paper by 
Zaks [ 1992] for references and known results). The smallest n for which this problem 
remains open is n = 5, where at least six colors are needed, as proved by Chilakamarri 
[1990]. For n = 2 the rational points of the plane can be colored with only two colors, 
as proved by Woodall [1973]. It would also seem natural to consider the graph induced 
by the set of all points in the plane that are constructible with ruler and compasses; 
this graph needs four colors, but we do not know if four suffice.

9.2. 
RINGEL'S CIRCLE PROBLEM 
Let C be a set of circles in the plane. The circles may be of different sizes, 
and they may overlap; however, no three circles in C can have a common 
tangent at a common point. Let G be the graph with vertices C and edges 
CjCj for circles C, and C, having a common tangent at a common point 
of C, and C;. Is there an upper bound on the chromatic number of G, and 
if so, what is a best possible upper bound? Is it 5? 
■ 
The problem is due to Ringel [1959]. It is known that K5 is not a graph of this 
type; however, the graph obtained from two disjoint copies of Κ$, say G\ and G2, 
by removing an edge xiy, from each G„ identifying X\ with x2 and joining y\ and yi 
by a new edge (this is the Hajos construction; see Section 1.4) is 5-chromatic and of 
the desired type. This result is due to Jackson and Ringel [1984a]. No 6-chromatic 
example seems to be known. 
For nonoverlapping circles the maximum chromatic number is 4 by the four-color 
theorem. Any planar graph can, in fact, be represented as the intersection graph of 
nonoverlapping circles, as proved by W.R Thurston. This result has a very interesting 
history going back to R Koebe in 1936, as explained by Sachs [1991] (see also the 
comments to Problem 16 in Bang-Jensen and Toft [1992]). 
For nonoverlapping circles of equal size, the maximum is still 4. That it is at 
most 4 in this case can be proved easily by induction without using the four-color 
theorem, as pointed out by Jackson and Ringel [1984a], by remarking that two 
circles at maximum distance correspond to vertices each of degree at most 3 in the 

Sphere Colorings 
153 
corresponding graph. The case of overlapping circles of equal size is unsolved—it is a 
famous problem due to H. Hadwiger and E. Nelson (see Problem 9.1). For dimension 
3 (and higher) all four versions (overlapping or nonoverlapping; equal size or not 
equal size) of the problem are unsolved (see also Problem 9.3). 
■ 
9.3. SACHS'UNIT-SPHERE PROBLEM 
Let M be a set of unit spheres in R" such that no two have interior points 
in common. Let G be a graph with vertex set M and edges xy whenever 
spheres x and y touch. What is the maximum chromatic number χ„ for 
these graphs? 
■ 
This problem is due to Sachs [1968]. It is the nonoverlapping and equal-size 
higher-dimensional case of Ringel's circle problem (Problem 9.2). It is easy to see 
that \2 = 4, but even χ3 is unknown. Jackson and Ringel [1984a] reported that 
■ 
9.4. SPHERE COLORINGS 
The chromatic number x(Sj) of a sphere of radius r in R3 is the minimum 
number of colors possible in a coloring of the points of the surface of 
S? in which any two points at unit (chordal) distance apart are colored 
differently. Is x(S?) = 4 for all r > 1/2? In particular, is χ(5?) = 4 for 
r — 1Λ/3? More generally, in dimension n, is x(S"~]) = n + 1 for all 
« > 3 a n d a l l r > 1/2? 
■ 
Answering a question of P. Erdös, Simmons [1974] proved 4 < Χ(^, rd ar>d 
reported a coloring due to E. Straus showing x(S2 ,-) ^ 5. A 4-coloring of the 
surface of S2 is obtained by projecting the four faces of an inscribed tetrahedron 
onto the surface of the sphere, and letting the resulting spherical triangles define the 
four-color classes. The sidelength of the inscribed tetrahedron is V8/3, which is also 
the (chordal) sidelength of each spherical triangle. The diameter can be obtained as 
the, somewhat larger, (chordal) distance 2/y 3 — V3 from a vertex of the triangle to 
the midpoint of its opposing side. Therefore, when scaling to radius r, the bound 
X(S2) s 4 holds for 1/2 < r < y3 - V3/2. This result is due to Simmons [1975]. 
Simmons [1975, 1976] conjectured that x(.S,) = 4 for all values of r > 1/2 
(trivially x(S,) = 1 for r < 1 /2 and x(Sh2) = 2). The number 4 as a lower bound 
for x(S?) is an open problem for 1/2 < r < l/>/3. Simmons [1976] proved that 
4 < x(S}) for r > 1 /yß and that equality holds for r = 1 /yfl. A similar problem 

154 
Geometrie and Combinatorial Graphs 
of Hadwiger [1961] and E. Nelson asks for x(S%,), where the bounds 4 < x(S£) s 7 
are known (see Problem 9.1). 
Loväsz [1983b] considered the same problem in higher dimensions and proved 
the deep and interesting result that for the sphere S" ' in R" of radius r, one has n s 
X(S"~') for all r > 1 /2, thus answering a question of P. Erdös and R.L. Graham posed 
at the Hungarian Combinatorial Conference in Eger, Hungary, in 1981. Moreover, 
Loväsz [1983b] observed that by inscribing a regular simplex in the sphere, one 
gets x(S"~{) ^ « + 1 for 1/2 < /- s /(«). The value of /(«) given by Loväsz is, 
however, incorrect. For n — 3 the correct value obtained from the inscribed simplex is 
^3 - V3/2, as first noticed by Simmons [ 1975]. The correct values of f(n) for « > 2 
seem to be V(" + 2)/(« + l)/2 for n even, and ^{n + 3 - yf(n - l)(n +~3)/8 for n 
odd [personal communication from U. Haagerup in 1994]. Loväsz [1983b] remarked 
that it is unknown if the lower bound n is ever attained when n s 3 (it is attained 
when n = 2). The last question posed above is thus due to Loväsz. 
■ 9.5. GRAPHS OF LARGE DISTANCES 
Let S be a finite set of points in Rd. Let d\ > d2 > · · ■ > dk > · · · be the 
distances between the points in S, and let G(S, k) be the graph with vertex 
set S having an edge xy for all x, y £ S such that the distance between x 
and v is at least dk. How large can x(G(S, k)) be as a function of d and kl 
How large can x(G(S, k)) be, when S is restricted to the set of vertices of 
a convex polytope in Rd? 
■ 
These questions were asked by Erdös, Loväsz, and Vesztergombi [1988, 1989]. 
They studied the problem for d = 2 and obtained the best possible bounds that if S C 
R2 has cardinality \S\ 2: c ■ k2, where c is a positive constant, then x(G(S,k)) < 7, 
and if S consists of the vertices of a convex polygon, then x(G(S, fc)) < 3. They also 
proved that if 5 consists of the vertices of a convex polygon, then x(G(S, k)) < 3k, 
independently of the size of 5, and conjectured that the correct answer is 2k + 1, 
attained by a regular (2k + l)-gon. 
For d > 2, Erdös, Loväsz, and Vesztergombi [1988] showed that x(G(S,k)) 
cannot be bounded independently of k, even for large \S\. They also remarked that 
the case when S consists of the vertices of a convex polytope seems to be the most 
difficult, and noted that even for k = 1 the problem is far from solved. A suggested 
bound of x(G(S, 1)) s d + 1 for k = 1 would be equivalent to the discrete version 
of a long-standing open problem of Borsuk [1933], who asked: Can every set in 
Rd of diameter 1 be partitioned into d + 1 sets of diameter smaller than 1? This 
question was answered negatively by Kahn and Kalai [1993], who described finite 
sets S in dimension d with x(G(S, 1)) > (\.2pd when d is sufficiently large, thus 
giving counterexamples for d = 1325 and for all d ^ 2014. The best known general 
upper bound for k - 1 seems to be x(G(S, 1)) < 2d~l + 1 due to Lassak [1982]. 

Prime Distance Graphs 
155 
Bounds are known that grow more slowly with d asymptotically, but they all grow 
exponentially fast (see Problem D14 in Croft, Falconer, and Guy [1991] for further 
references and results on Borsuk's problem). 
For the convex case, and |5| large enough depending on d and k, Erdös, Loväsz, 
and Vesztergombi [1988] made the conjecture that x(G(S, k)) is bounded by the least 
number h(d) for which every compact set in R^ with diameter 1 can be partitioned 
into hid) sets with diameter smaller than 1. 
■ 
9.6. 
PRIME DISTANCE GRAPHS 
For any V QV, where V denotes the set of all primes, let Z(T>) denote 
the graph with the integers as vertex set and with an edge joining / and j 
if and only if 1/ — y'| e V. Which sets V satisfy χ(Ζ(Ί))) = 4? 
■ 
Eggleton, Erdös, and Skilton [1985,1986] posed this problem. They proved that: 
(i) x(Z(V)) = 4, 
(ii) x(Z(V)) <2if2<2X>or£> = {2}, and 
(Hi) x(Z(V)) > 3 if 2 e V and \D\ > 2; if in addition 3 g I>, then x(Z(V)) = 3, 
and moreover they conjectured that χ(Ζ(Τ>)) — 4 if and only if {2,3}CP and V 
contains a pair of twin primes. Eggleton, Erdös, and Skilton [1990] proved that the 
"if" part of this conjecture is true. However, counterexamples to the "only if" part 
were discovered by Eggleton [ 1987], by H. Walther, and by N. Alon and J. Schönheim, 
as reported in Eggleton, Erdös, and Skilton [1988]. 
Clearly, P ' C D implies that χ(Ζ(Τ>')) < χ(Ζ(Χ>)). Hence it follows from (i) 
above that Z(V) can always be 4-colored, and from (ii) and (iii) that Zip) can be 3-
colored if {2,3} £ V. Eggleton, Erdös, and Skilton [1985] proved that© = {2,3,5} is 
the only example of χ(Ζ(Ί))) = 4 and \T>\ s 3. Voigt and Walther [1991] announced 
that the minimal sets V = {2,3, p, q) without twin primes for which χ(Ζ(Τ>)) = 4 can 
be completely characterized by (p,q)E {(11,19), (11,23). (11,37), (11,41), (17,29), 
(23,31), (23,41), (29,37)}. This may suggest, as an appropriate weakening of the 
original conjecture by Eggleton, Erdös, and Skilton [1986], to ask the question: Is 
there, for every fixed cardinality, only a finite collection of minimal sets V of the 
given size for which V is without twin primes and χ(Ζ(Τ>)) = 4? It is not likely that 
the condition "without twin primes" can be removed, since by the result of Eggleton, 
Erdös, and Skilton [1990] this would imply the existence of only finitely many pairs 
of twin primes, thus solving a long-standing open problem in number theory. 
The motivation for this problem arose from a study by Eggleton, Erdös, and 
Skilton [1985] of natural extensions of the (by itself easy) 1-dimensional version of 
the problem by Hadwiger [ 1961 ] and E. Nelson of coloring the points of the plane so 
that pairs of points of unit distance are colored differently (Problem 9.1). Eggleton, 
Erdös, and Skilton [1985] mainly considered coloring the points of the real line 
subject to various conditions on the distances between pairs of points belonging to 
the same color class.

Voigt [1992] considered both the problem above and a generalization of it to 
infinite distance sets not necessarily consisting only of primes.

CUBE-LIKE GRAPHS 
Let 5 be a set of n elements and C C 2s a family of subsets of 5. The "cube-
like graph" Qs{C) is the graph with vertex set 2s, where two vertices x, y C 
S are adjacent if and only if their symmetric difference χΔγ belongs to C. 
Is it possible to give a formula in terms of n and d, where 0 < d ^ n, for 
the chromatic number of the graph Q^ = Qs(Cd), where Cd denotes the 
family of all subsets of S of size at most dl Qfn can also be described as 
the graph obtained from the usual n-dimensional cube by joining all pairs 
of distinct vertices at (graph-theoretic) distance at most d. 
What are the possible values of k for which there exist 5 and C C 2s such 
that x(Qs(C)) = k7 
U 
Cube-like graphs were introduced by L. Loväsz, thereby providing a nontrivial 
class of graphs having only integer eigenvalues (see Harary [1975]). 
The first question asks for the chromatic number of a special class of distance 
graphs. The distance graph Q„(d\, d.2,. ■., <4) is the graph whose vertex set consists 
of the subsets of a set with n elements, with two being adjacent if and only if 
their symmetric difference has exactly d-, elements for some / = 1,2,...,*. Dvorak, 
Havel, Laborde, and Liebl [1990] studied such graphs, and they conjectured that the 
chromatic number of any distance graph is a power of 2. Payan [1992] disproved 
their conjecture, giving as a counterexample the graph ßö(4) with x(Qe(4)) = 7, and 
he reported that a computer search has shown that this graph is the smallest such 
example. 
For G any simple graph, define Q(G) = Qv(C){E{G))- F. Jaeger [personal com-
munication in 1992] proved that x(Q(G)) < 2rio&*(C)1. In fact, equality holds if 
X(G) :£ A—this follows from a general result of Payan [1992], who proved that a 
cube-like graph of chromatic number 3 does not exist. Since G is the subgraph of Q(G) 
induced by the 1-element subsets of 2V(G\ one has the inequality x(G) ^ x(Q(G)), 
and thus x(Q(G)) = 2ίΙο&*(01 for 
an graphs G with x(G) < 4. Jaeger [personal 
communication in 1993] asked if equality holds for all graphs. 
However, the answer to Jaeger's question is negative. Let G be the 5-chromatic 
graph obtained by joining a complete graph K^ completely to a 5-cycle. G can also be 
described as the graph obtained from Κη by deleting the edges of a 5-cycle. Assume 
that V(G) = {1,2,...,7} and let the deleted 5-cycle consist of edges 12, 23, 34, 
45, and 15. Q(G) has two isomorphic connected components, one corresponding to 
the even subsets of V(G), the other to the odd subsets. We have found that Q(G) 
allows a 7-coloring by coloring the component corresponding to the odd subsets as 
follows: 

Cube-Like Graphs 
157 
Color classes 
1. 1, 5,123, 267, 345, 12345, 12567, 13467, 13567, 23467 
2. 2,136, 157, 234,12467, 13456, 23567,24567 
3. 3,4, 126, 145, 567,12347, 12357, 34567 
4. 6, 137, 147, 236, 247, 257, 357,456, 12356, 12456 
5. 7, 127, 146, 156, 256, 347, 12346,12457,13457, 23456 
6. 124, 134, 135, 235, 245, 367,467,12367,14567, 1234567 
7. 125, 167, 237, 246, 346, 356, 457, 23457 
Thus 
X(ß(G))) < 2ilog>*(G)1 = 8, 
where the last equality follows from x(G) = 5. 
Linial, Meshulam, and Tarsi [1988] proved that ^(β^.,) = 2ί1ο& π1 if n is of the 
form 2', 2' - 1,2' - 2, or 2' - 3. Hence for the complete graph G = K„, with n of this 
form, x(Q(G)) = 2ilogj *(G)1, since ß(G) has two connected components isomorphic 
to the graph Q2
n_,, one corresponding to the even-sized subsets of V(G) and the other 
corresponding to the odd-sized subsets. It follows that x(Q(K„)) = 2^log2"' for all 
« :£ 8. For « = 9 the bounds 
13 < x{Q(K9)) < 16 
were noted by Dvorak, Havel, Laborde, and Liebl [1990]. Very recently, G.F. Royle 
[personal communication in 1993] found a 14-coloring of Ql (i.e., of Q(K9)) us-
ing a randomized computer search. It remains open if a 13-coloring of this graph 
exists. 
It is known that there exist cube-like graphs with chromatic number 2" for all 
« ä: 0, for example the graphs Q(K2«) or equivalently Ö2»(2), by the above-mentioned 
result of Linial, Meshulam, and Tarsi [1988]. Payan [1992] showed that cube-like 
graphs cannot have chromatic number 3, but some have chromatic number 7. Do 
cube-like graphs of chromatic number 5 or 6 exist? Does there exist a function / 
such that an «j-chromatic cube-like graph exists if and only if 2" — /(«) £ m s 2" 
for some «? It follows from the results above that / must satisfy /(2) = 0, /(3) ^ 1, 
and/(4)>2. 
Graphs that are "cube-like" in a different sense can be obtained as follows. For 
q > 2 let Q(q)d
n be the graph whose vertices are the q" different «-tuples on a set 
of q elements, and where two are adjacent if and only if they are distinct and differ 
in at most d coordinate places. Thus Q^ = Q(2)^. The chromatic numbers of such 
graphs seem very little studied for q > 2. We note that x(Q(q)l) s (q — 1)« + 1, 
with equality if q is a prime power and if there exists a perfect 1-error-correcting 
q-ary linear code of length «. A coloring of Q{q)2„ can be obtained by using such 
a code together with its {q — 1)« distinct co-sets as color classes. A particular case 
of equality occurs when there exists an integer m so that n = (qm — l)/(q — 1),

implying the existence of a 1 -error-correcting <7-ary Hamming code of length n (see 
Mac Williams and Sloane [1986]).

ODD GRAPH CONJECTURE 
Let k s 2 and let Ok denote the graph whose vertices are the (k — 1)-
subsets of the set {1,2,..., 2k — 1}, with an edge joining a pair of vertices 
if and only if their corresponding subsets are disjoint. Is Ok k-edge-
colorable if k Φ 3 and k is not a power of 2? 
■ 
The question was asked by Biggs [1972], conjecturing that the answer is affir-
mative. He noted that O3 is the Petersen graph, which is not 3-edge-colorable. When 
k is a power of 2, Ok is a ^-regular graph with an odd number of vertices; it can 
therefore not be A-edge-colored. 
Ok is a special case of a "Kneser graph," defined similarly on the set of d-subsets 
of any set of size n, where 0 < d s n/2. Since 0* is always defined for a set of odd 
size 2k— 1, it is usual to refer to Ok as an "odd graph." (See Problems 9.13 and 17.10 
for questions about vertex colorings of Kneser graphs.)

9.9. 
CHORD INTERSECTION GRAPHS 
Given a geometric circle in the plane, as drawn by compasses, and a set C 
of its chords, the corresponding chord intersection graph G has V(G) = C 
and two vertices x and y joined by an edge if the two chords x and y cross. 
Such a graph is often referred to as a "circle graph." Find a best possible 
upper bound for the chromatic number x(G) of a chord intersection graph 
in terms of the size w(G) of a largest complete subgraph of G. 
■ 
As reported by Melnikov [1985] the problem is due to I.A. Karapetyan, who 
proved that all triangle-free chord intersection graphs are 8-colorable. L.S. Melnikov 
[personal communication in 1985] informed us that A.V. Kostochka improved "8-
colorable" to "5-colorable." It seems unknown if it can be improved to "4-colorable." 
This problem was mentioned by Gyärfäs and Lehel [1985]; who also mentioned a 
5-coloring algorithm found by Lehel. 
Gyärfäs [1985, 1986] and Kostochka determined an exponential upper bound in 
<o(G) for the chromatic number x(G). Kostochka and J. Kratochvil found an improved 
such bound [personal communication in 1994]. From the well-known existence of 
^-chromatic graphs without triangles no such upper bound in w(G) for x(G) exists in 
general (see Section 1.5). Does a polynomial upper bound in w(G) for x(G) exist for 
chord intersection graphs? 
The problem of characterizing chord intersection graphs has been studied by 
Fournier [1978], de Fraysseix [1984], and Wessel and Pöschel [1985]. Algorithms 
for recognizing chord intersection graphs in polynomial time were described by 

Gyarfns and Lehel's Triangle-Free L-Graphs 
159 
Bouchet [1985, 1987], Gabor, Hsu, and Supowit [1985], Naji [1985], and Spinrad 
[1994]. For circular arc graphs the corresponding problem by Tucker [1975] has been 
solved by Karapetyan [1980]. 
Bielecki [1948] posed a similar problem for 2-dimensional box intersection 
graphs G; that is, the vertices of G correspond to rectangles with sides parallel to the 
coordinate axes in the plane, and two vertices are joined by an edge in G whenever 
the corresponding rectangles overlap. Bielecki's problem was solved by Asplund and 
Grünbaum [1960], who proved a best possible result: A 2-dimensional box inter-
section graph G without triangles is 6-colorable. The smallest 6-chrpmatic example 
found by Asplund and Grünbaum has about 50,000 vertices, and they remarked that 
it would be interesting to know whether the size of non-5-colorable families may 
be substantially reduced. Moreover, Asplund and Grünbaum [1960] obtained the 
inequality x(G) s 4co(G)2 for all 2-dimensional box intersection graphs G. They 
remarked that even this bound seems quite crude. 
For 3-dimensional box intersection graphs without triangles no upper bound on 
χ in terms of ω exists. This result follows from a construction due to Burling [1965].

GYÄRFÄS AND LEHEL'S TRIANGLE-FREE 
L-GRAPHS 
Two line segments AB and AC in the plane with AB vertical (with B above 
A) and AC horizontal (with C to the right of A) is called an L-shape. Let 
£ be a set of L-shapes in the plane. The corresponding L-graph G has 
V(G) = C and two vertices x and y joined by an edge if and only if the 
two L-shapes x and y have a common point. Does there exist a constant 
k such that x(G) £ k for all L-graphs G without triangles? 
■ 
The problem is due to Gyärfäs and Lehel [ 1985], who represented the 4-chromatic 
triangle-free Mycielski graph on 11 vertices as an L-graph, thus proving k ^ 4. The 
problem for L-graphs with infinite vertical segments has been studied by S. McGuin-
ness [personal communication in 1993]. 
Gyärfäs and Lehel [1985] considered several similar problems for other classes 
of graphs, among them chord intersection graphs, where £ is replaced by a set C of 
chords of a geometric circle and two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if 
the two corresponding chords cross. For triangle-free such graphs G the upper bound 
X(G) £ 5 has been obtained by Lehel and A.V. Kostochka; however, no 5-chromatic 
example is known (see Problem 9.9). 
For "boxes" instead of L-shapes, that is, rectangular regions with sides parallel 
to the coordinate axes, the corresponding problem due to Bielecki [1948] was solved 
by Asplund and Grünbaum [ 1960], who proved that the best possible upper bound for 
the chromatic number of a triangle-free 2-dimensional box intersection graph is 6. 
For triangle-free graphs, in general, no upper bound on χ exists, and this holds 
true even for triangle-free 3-dimensional box intersection graphs, as proved by 

160 
Geometrie and Combinatorial Graphs 
Burling [1965]. The opposite extreme holds for interval graphs (i.e., 1-dimensional 
box intersection graphs). These are perfect and hence satisfy χ = ω (see the mono-
graph by Golumbic [1980]). 
■ 
9.11. ERDÖS-FABER-LOVÄSZ PROBLEM 
Let Kl, K2,..., 
Kk be complete graphs, all of size at most k, and assume 
that for any two of them the intersection is either empty or exactly one 
vertex. Let G be the union of K', K2,..., 
KkAs G ^-colorable? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative was made at a party in Boulder, 
Colorado, in September 1972. Erdös [1981] has offered $500 for a proof or a coun-
terexample. 
The class described above contains perhaps the simplest graphs for which 
the chromatic numbers are not known. Using the hypergraph H with vertex set 
{K\K2,..., 
Kk) and edges Ex consisting of all those K> sharing a common vertex x 
of G, the Erdös-Faber-Loväsz conjecture can be formulated as follows: Let H be a 
hypergraph with k vertices and with edges each pair of which has at most one vertex 
in common. Then H is edge-colorable in k colors (where incident edges as usual get 
different colors). Kahn and Seymour [1992] proved that one can assign nonnegative 
real weights to sets of mutually disjoint edges of H, such that the weights add up 
to at most k, and for every edge the sum of the weights of the sets containing it 
is at least 1. This is the fractional version of the Erdös-Faber-Loväsz conjecture, 
which in effect asserts that this can be done with (0,l)-valued weights. In particular, 
for a graph H the theorem of V.G. Vizing (Theorem 29 in Chapter 1) implies that 
χ'(Η) s Δ(//) + 1 < k, where χ' denotes the edge-chromatic number and Δ the 
maximum degree. 
Mitchem [1978], and independently Chang and Lawler [1988], obtained the 
bound x(G) < ]3k/2 - 2l for k > 3. Kahn [1992] proved that asymptotically the 
conjecture is almost true; more precisely he proved that x(G) < k + o(k). Kahn 
[1994b] mentioned a suggestion by Erdös to remove the restriction on the intersection 
of the complete graphs: If G is the union of k complete graphs of size k, is it then 
possible to bound x(G) as a function of OJ(G), the size of a largest complete subgraph in 
G? Kahn [1994b] added that it is conceivable that x(G) = o(G) might always hold, 
which would imply the Erdös-Faber-Loväsz conjecture. Horäk and Tuza [1990] 
obtained a best possible bound on x(G) in terms of k: If G is the union of k complete 
jfc-graphs, then x(G) < k3/2. 
For the union of critical graphs in general, without restrictions on the intersec-
tions, Erdös recently asked for the maximum chromatic number f(k, £) of the union 
of a it-critical and ^-critical graph [personal communication in 1994]. It is easy to see, 
by removing a common vertex of the two graphs, that f(k,£) £ {k — \)(£ — 1) + 1. 
Is this the best possible? Since K5 is the union of two 5-cycles, one gets /(3,3) = 5. 
Is/(4,4) =10? 

General Kneser Graphs 
161 
The following problem was suggested by Klotz [1989]: If G is the union of 
complete subgraphs of size at most k so that each vertex of G is contained in at most 
r of them, does 
X(G) s [r - 1 + i j · k 
hold? Klotz proved that the right-hand side is an upper bound for <o(G) and char-
acterized the graphs for which it is equal to w(G). He remarked that for r - 2 the 
answer is affirmative by the theorem of Shannon [1949], that χ'(Η) < 3Δ(//)/2 for 
a multigraph H. 
U 
9.12. 
ALON-SAKS-SEYMOUR PROBLEM 
If the edge set of G is the disjoint union of the edge sets of m complete 
bipartite graphs, is it true that \(G) < m + 1? 
■ 
Kahn [1994b] reported that N. Alon, M. Saks, and P.D. Seymour raised this 
question and conjectured that the answer is affirmative. 
The question generalizes a theorem of Graham and Pollak [1972] stating that the 
edge set of the complete graph K„ cannot be partitioned into the edge sets of fewer 
than n - 1 complete bipartite graphs. A very elegant short algebraic proof of the 
theorem of Graham and Pollak is due to Tverberg [1982], but no combinatorial proof 
seems known. Kahn [1994b] wrote that the conjecture of Alon, Saks, and Seymour 
".. .presents the nice challenge of either extending the algebraic proofs (which would 
be very appealing, but does not seem easy), or at least finding a combinatorial proof 
of the Graham-Pollak Theorem, a goal which has also proved fairly elusive." 
Replacing "complete bipartite graphs" with "complete graphs on m vertices" in 
the Alon-Saks-Seymour problem, and replacing "x(G) ^ m + 1" with "x(G) ^ m" 
leads to a formulation of the Erdös-Faber-Loväsz problem (Problem 9.11). 
■ 
9.13. 
GENERAL KNESER GRAPHS 
For integers n > k > t > 0 the general Kneser graph K(n, k, t) is defined 
as the graph with the set of all /:-subsets of the set {1,2 
n} as vertex 
set and two such sets X and Y joined by an edge if and only if |X Π Y\ < t. 
What is the chromatic number χ{Κ(η, k, t)) of K(n, k, i)? 
■ 
Frankl [1985] asked this question and conjectured that x(K(n, k, t)) = T(n, k, t), 
for n sufficiently large and t s 2, where T(n, k, t) is the smallest number of i-subsets 
of an n-set X such that any ^-subset of X contains at least one of the i-subsets. 
Thus T(n, k, t) is an obvious upper bound for χ(Κ(η, k, t)). Frankl [1985] proved the 

162 
Geometrie and Combinatorial Graphs 
conjecture for t = 2, and he showed that χ(Κ(η, k,t)) = (1 + o( 1 ))T(n, k, t) holds for 
all t s 3. The problem of determining T(n, k, t) is a famous extremal problem due to 
Turän [1941, 1954, 1961 ]. It was solved for / = 2 by Turän [1941, 1954] (this is the 
famous Turän's Theorem, to be found in most graph theory textbooks, e.g., Bondy 
and Murty [ 19761), a°d remains open for i ^ 3 , For some of the known estimates for 
T(n,k,t), see Brouwerand Voorhoeve [1979] and Fiiredi [1991]. Füredi [1991] gave 
a comprehensive survey of Turän-type problems, drawing attention to the special 
case k = 4 and t = 3. He mentioned that, in memory of Turän, P. Erdös has offered 
$ 1000 for the determination of T(n, 4,3). 
Kneser [1955] conjectured \(K(n,k, 1)) = n - 2k + 2 for all n > k > 1. This 
was proved by Loväsz [1978], and with a shorter proof by Bäräny [1978]. A more 
general version of Kneser's conjecture was stated and proved by Sarkaria [1990]. 
Tort [1983] proved that χ(Κ{η, 3,2)) = T(n, 3,2) f = (^γ^) 
j for n > 6.

9.14. QUESTION OF GALLAI RELATED TO 
SPERNER'S LEMMA 
Let n > 1 and let S - {5, : / = 1,2 
m) (m > 1) be a set of n-
dimensional simplexes together forming a subdivision of an «-dimensional 
simplex S, that is, 5 = UiS(Sm5„ where each pair S, and Sj have disjoint 
interiors (1 < i < j ^ m), and if some point p £ R" is a vertex (a zero-
dimensional face) of 5, for some i = 1,2, ...,m, 
then p is a vertex of 
every Sj such that p G Sj. 
Let G be the graph obtained from S as follows. The vertices of G are of 
three kinds: 
(a) a vertex vp for each p G R" that is a vertex of some S, G 5, 
(b) vertices «,·,/'= 1,2,..., m, each corresponding to a simplex of S, and 
(c) n + 1 vertices v\ v2,..., υ"+ι, corresponding to the n + 1 (n — 1)-
dimensional faces F\, Fi,..., Fn+i of 5. 
The edges of G join vp to v, if p G 5„ and vp to v' whenever p G Fj. 
Finally, the vertices v1, v2,..., v"+l form a complete (« + l)-subgraph 
ofG. 
It follows from Sperner's simplex lemma in n dimensions that G is an 
(n + 2)-chromatic graph. Is Gan(« + 2)-critical graph? Is G naturally a 
member of a larger class of (n + 2)-chromatic graphs defined in purely 
graph-theoretical terms? Is G a member of such a class of (« + 2)-critical 
graphs?

The statement x(G) = n + 2 is, in fact, equivalent to then-dimensional version of 
Sperner's lemma proved by Sperner [1928]. This fact was first observed by T. Gallai, 
who also raised the question of criticality and proved that the answer is affirmative in 
the 2-dimensional case [personal communication in 1969] (see the paper by Nielsen 
and Toft [1975]). The answer to the question of criticality may possibly be known 
to topologists to be affirmative for n > 3, but we have not found any references to 
support this. 
In one dimension G is an odd cycle of length at least 5, hence G is 3-critical. 
In two dimensions G can be represented as a plane graph Γ consisting of a 6-cycle 
C with vertices s\, t\, S2, ti.s^Js in cyclic order, together with edges (s\, S2), (v2, S3), 
and (S3,s\) outside C together with vertices and edges inside C such that all faces 
inside C are bounded by 4-cycles. Gallai [personal communication in 1969] proved 
that such a plane graph Γ is critical 4-chromatic if and only if (i) Γ has no vertex of 
degree 2, and (ii) every 4-cycle of the graph Γ — (si,S2) " fe.^) ~ (*3>·?ι) is the 
boundary of a face in Γ. It is not hard to see that conditions (i) and (ii) are satisfied by 
the graph Γ representing G. The critical members of the class of 4-chromatic planar 
graphs obtained by replacing the 6-cycle C by any cycle of length 2 modulo 4 were 
characterized by Nielsen and Toft [1975]. 
Tompkins [ 1964] gave an extremely well-written introduction to Sperner's lemma 
and some of its applications, including a proof using a counting argument. As far as 
we know, the first proof using graph theory was presented by Wagner [1970], and 
such a proof was also included, for the 2-dimensional case, in the introductory text 
on graph theory by Bondy and Murty [1976]. These proofs rely on the very elemen-
tary graph-theoretic proposition that the number of odd-degree vertices in a graph 
is always even. Thus Sperner's lemma has become a classical example of applying 
graph theory to proofs of nontrivial results in other mathematical fields.

10.1. POLYNOMIAL GRAPH COLORING 
Does there exist a polynomial graph coloring algorithm producing for 
every graph G a coloring of G using at most c · x(G) · \V(G)\i~s 
colors, 
where c and ε are constants satisfying c > 0 and 0 < e ^ 1 ? 
■ 
The question is due to Johnson [1978]. Based on an argument of P. Erdös, 
Johnson [ 1974] showed the existence of a polynomial algorithm A using A(G) colors 
to color any arbitrary graph G of chromatic number x(G) at least 2, where 
A(G) < c ■ logx(G) · |V(G)|/log|V(G)|, 
implying that the performance guarantee A(G)/x(G) is at most c ■ |V(G)|/log |V(G)|. 
Halldorsson [1990] improved the bound to 
A(G)/x(G) < c · \V(G)\ ■ (loglog|V(G)|)2/(log|V(G)|)3, 
and this seems to be the currently best known order of magnitude for a polynomial 
graph coloring algorithm. 
Based on a general method by Arora, Lund, Motwani, Sudan, and Szegedy [ 1992] 
for proving the intractability of a range of combinatorial approximation problems, 
Lund and Yannakakis [1993] proved that for some constant ε^ > 0, no polynomial 
graph coloring algorithm A has a performance guarantee A(G)/x(G) s 11/(01*°, 
unless NP = P (Theorem 20 in Chapter 1). A corollary of this result is an affirmative 
answer to a question of Johnson [ 1978]: 
Theorem. If there is a polynomial graph coloring algorithm that uses at most 
c ■ x(G) colors (where c is a positive constant) to color any given graph G, then there 
exists a polynomial algorithm to determine x(G). 
If there is a polynomial algorithm to decide for any graph G if G is 3-colorable, 
then NP = P and there is a polynomial algorithm to determine x(G) (see Theorem 19

in Chapter 1). Using this, Garey and Johnson [1976] proved the theorem for c < 2. 
For c < 4/3 there is a very simple proof (see Garey and Johnson [1979]). 
Restricting the discussion to 3-colorable graphs, Wigderson [1983] proved that 
there exists a polynomial algorithm for coloring any such graph on n vertices with 
0(yfi) colors. This was improved by Blum [1990] to 0(«3/8 log5/8 n) colors, the so 
far best known bound. We do not know if there exists a constant k and a polynomial 
algorithm for coloring any 3-colorable graph with k colors. Khanna, Linial, and Safra 
[1993] have shown that such a k must be at least 5, unless NP = P. 
Even if there is a polynomial algorithm to decide for any planar graph G of 
maximum degree 4 if G is 3-colorable, then NP=P would follow (see Theorem 19 
in Chapter 1). But for graphs in general of maximum degree 3 Brooks' theorem 
(Theorem 11 in Chapter 1) gives a very simple such polynomial algorithm. If, in 
contrast to asking for just the existence of a 3-coloring, the number of different 3-
colorings is wanted, then the situation changes drastically. Edwards [1992] proved 
that asking for the precise number of different 3-colorings of a 3-regular bipartite 
graph is already a #P-complete problem. Enumeration problems in this class are 
considered even more unlikely to be polynomially solvable than their counterparts 
among the decision problems, the iW-complete problems (see Garey and Johnson 
[1979]). 
■ 
10.2. POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATION 
Does there exist a function g and a polynomial algorithm that for any 
given input graph G will find a number s, such that the chromatic number 
of G satisfies s < \{G) < g(s)l 
■ 
This question was asked by Alon [1993], who proved that if the chromatic 
number x(G) is replaced by the list-chromatic number xe(G), then the corresponding 
question has a positive answer (see Problem 17.2). The proof uses the existence of a 
polynomial algorithm for the coloring number (see Sections 1.3 and 1.9). 
■ 
10.3. EVEN CHROMATIC GRAPHS 
If x(G) is known to be even, does there exist a polynomial algorithm to 
decide if x(G) < 4? 
■ 
This problem is due to Kratochvil and Nesetfil [1989], and it was posed by 
Nesetril at the graph theory meeting in memory of G.A. Dirac, held at Sandbjerg, 
Denmark, in June 1985. 
The corresponding problem with x(G) £ 2 can be solved by a simple polyno-
mial algorithm. The corresponding problem with x(G) ^ 6 is NP-complete, since a 
polynomial algorithm to decide the answer to this could be used to decide for any 
graph G whether x(G) ^ 3 (take two disjoint copies of G joined completely and 

170 
Algorithms 
decide if this even chromatic graph is 6-colorable), and this 3-coloring problem is 
known to be NP-complete (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1). 
Khanna, Linial, and Safra [ 1993] proved that if there is a polynomial algorithm 
with output YES for all 3-colorable graphs and output NO for all non-4-colorable 
graphs (and either of the two answers for 4-chromatic graphs), then NP = P. We 
express this by saying that it is ΝΡ-\ι&τά to distinguish between "χ £ 3" and "χ ^ 5." 
It follows that it is NP-hard to 4-color 3-colorable graphs (and more generally, that 
it is NP-hard to (5k — l)-color 3&-colorable graphs), and also that it is W-hard 
to distinguish between "χ ^ 4" and "χ s 6." However, this does not exclude the 
possibility that there is a polynomial algorithm that can distinguish between "χ s 4" 
and "χ 5: 6" for the special class of even-chromatic graphs (although it makes it 
seem unlikely). 
A related question was asked by Thostrup [1992]. If it is known for some g > 3 
that 
(i) X(G) Φ 7, and 
(ii) every cycle in G has length at least g, 
does there exist a polynomial algorithm to decide if x(G) ^ 6? If condition (ii) is 
removed, this problem becomes MP-complete by the construction mentioned above. 
If condition (i) is removed, the problem becomes W-complete, since then the NP-
complete problem of deciding whether a given graph G is 6-colorable can be reduced 
to it. This follows from the existence of 7-critical graphs H with cycles of length 
at least g (Theorem 22 in Chapter 1): The reduction consists in applying Hajos' 
construction (see Theorem 18 in Chapter 1) with such an H for each edge of G—the 
obtained graph is 7-chromatic if and only if x(G) > 6. However, neither reduction 
shows that the combined problem given above is NP-complete. Thostrup [1992] 
showed that if this problem is NP-complete (with g = 43), then the problem of 
deciding whether a given graph has an orientation as a Hasse diagram of some 
partially ordered set is NP-complete. (A directed graph is the Hasse diagram of a 
partially ordered set if and only if none of its cycles has all, or all but one, of the edges 
of the cycle of the same direction on the cycle.) A proof that the problem of deciding 
whether a given graph has an orientation as a Hasse diagram is indeed WP-complete 
was published by Ne§etril and Rödl [1987]. Thostrup [1992] pointed out a mistake in 
the proof, and it has since been corrected by NeSetril and Rödl [1993] using a deep 
result of Lund and Yannakakis [ 1993] (Theorem 20 in Chapter 1). A more elementary 
proof was given by Brightwell [1993]. 
■ 
10.4. GRUNDY NUMBER 
A Grundy coloring of order lc of a graph G is a Ar-coloring of G with 
colors 1,2,..., k such that for each vertex x the color of x is the smallest 
positive integer not used as a color on any neighbor of* in G. The Grundy 

Achromatic Number of a Tree 
171 
number T(G) is the largest integer k for which G has a Grundy coloring 
of order k. Is it an W-complete problem to decide for given G and k if 
no > *? 
■ 
This problem was first raised by Hedetniemi, Hedetniemi, and Beyer [1982], 
who proved that there is a linear algorithm to determine Γ(Γ) for any tree T. The 
Grundy number was perhaps first defined by Christen and Selkow [1979]. Grundy 
colorings go back to Grundy [1939], who studied such colorings for directed graphs 
corresponding to games, and they were used by Berge [1958] to study kernels of 
directed graphs. 
The usual sequential polynomial graph coloring algorithms, as described by 
Matula, Marble, and Isaacson [1972] and Johnson [1974], give Grundy colorings. 
The smallest integer for which G has a Grundy coloring is the chromatic number 
X(G). Moreover, 
X(G) < T(G) s φ(Ρ) 
where t//(G) is the achromatic number (defined in Problem 10.5). Both #(G) and 
ij/(G) are difficult to determine, as their determination has been shown NP-complete 
by Karp [1972] (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1) and Yannakakis and Gavril [1980], 
respectively. 
The so-called ordered chromatic number of Simmons [1982, 1983, 1985] is 
equal to the Grundy number. This was noted by P. Erdös in collaboration with Hare, 
Hedetniemi, Laskar, and Pfaff [1986] and by Erdös, Hare, Hedetniemi, and Laskar 
[1987]. They reported that this was also observed by E. Brickell. 
■ 
10.5. ACHROMATIC NUMBER OF A TREE 
The achromatic number \jt(G) of a graph G is the maximum number of 
colors possible in a coloring of G with any two different colors adjacent 
somewhere in G. Is it an MP-hard problem to determine for a given tree 
T and a given number k if ψ(Τ) 2Jt? 
■ 
The achromatic number was introduced by Harary, Hedetniemi, and Prins [1967]. 
That the answer to the question above is affirmative was suspected by Hedetniemi, 
Hedetniemi, and Beyer [1982]. For general graphs G it is an MP-hard problem to 
determine t//(G) as proved by Yannakakis and Gavril [1980]. 
The most important reference to achromatic numbers is the paper by Färber, 
Hahn, Hell, and Miller [1986]. They proved among many other things that for any 
fixed k there is a polynomial algorithm to decide if </f(G) = k. Moreover, the problem 
for trees has a polynomial algorithm for certain special classes of trees.

10.6. ON-LINE COLORING 
Given a graph G with an ordering JC, < x2 < · · · < x„ of the vertices, 
an on-line algorithm A with input (G, <) produces a coloring of G by 
assigning a color to each vertex X\, x2,..., 
x» one at a time, where the color 
assigned to x, depends only on the subgraph G[x\, JC2, ..., *,] induced by 
the vertices up to and including xt together with their induced ordering. 
Over all possible orderings < let A(G) denote the maximum number of 
colors used by A to color G. 
The performance ratio rA(G) of A on G is the ratio A(G)/x(G), and the 
performance function pA of A is defined by 
pA(n) = max rA(G), 
where the maximum is over all graphs G with n vertices. 
What is a best possible bound for the performance function pA of an 
on-line algorithm ΑΊ 
■ 
The question has been considered by Loväsz, Saks, and Trotter [1989]. It is 
clear that pA(n) s n for any on-line algorithm A. Loväsz, Saks, and Trotter explicitly 
described an on-line algorithm A with a better than linear performance function 
pA{n)<{\ + 0 ( 1 ) ) · ^ - , 
log n 
where log* n denotes the smallest k for which the k times iterated logarithm 
log(*' n = log log... log n (k times) 
gives log'*' n ^ 1. They remarked that the algorithm can be modified to color any 
3-colorable graph on n vertices with at most 
n log log log n 
log log n 
colors, where c > 0 is a constant. 
A first lower bound for the performance function of an on-line coloring algorithm 
A was obtained by Bean [1976], who proved the result (originally stated in terms of 
recursive functions) that for any integer t > 0 there exists a tree T on 2' vertices such 
that A(T) > t. It follows that 
ΡΛ(η) > -log2 n. 

On-Line Coloring 
173 
Loväsz, Saks, and Trotter [1989] pointed out that there exists an on-line algorithm 
A such that A(G) s 2 log2 n for any bipartite graph G on n vertices. Thus when 
restricting to bipartite graphs on n vertices the best possible performance ratio is 
close to log2 n. Improved lower bounds for graphs in general have been obtained by 
Vishwanathan [1992] and by M. Szegedy, who, as reported by Loväsz, Saks, and 
Trotter [1989], proved that 
, » 
i 
ΡΛ(Ό s 
-
(log2 n)2 
for any on-line coloring algorithm A. Vishwanathan [1992] in particular studied the 
lower and upper bounds that can be obtained when restricting to graphs of bounded 
chromatic numbers. The informative survey by Kierstead and Trotter [ 1992] contains 
a discussion of the bounds given above and additional results and open problems. 
For any class of graphs Q the on-line chromatic number x*{Q) is defined as the 
smallest number k such that there exists an on-line algorithm A for which XA(G) S k 
for every member G of Q (if no such number k exists, define x*(Q) = °°). A graph G 
has on-line chromatic number x*(G) = x*({G}). Gyärfäs, Kiräly, and Lehel [1993] 
proved that deciding if a graph has on-line chromatic number at most 3 is polynomial 
for bipartite graphs, for triangle-free graphs, and for connected graphs, and they 
conjectured that it is polynomially decidable also in general. However, they made 
another conjecture that it is an NP-complete problem to decide for a given graph if it 
has on-line chromatic number at most 4. 
For the class OL(3) of graphs with on-line chromatic number at most 3, 
Gyärfäs, Kiräly, and Lehel [1993] announced the result x*(QL{7>)) = 4. The in-
equality x*(OL(3)) < 5 was proved independently by K. Kolossa. Gyärfäs, Kiräly, 
and Lehel conjectured that x*(OL(k)) is finite for all Ü 4 . 
Because of applications to dynamic storage allocation, many authors have studied 
the problem of on-line coloring restricted to interval graphs, the intersection graphs 
of finite collections of intervals on the real line. In particular, the on-line algorithm 
"First Fit" FF (also sometimes called "the greedy algorithm") has been studied by 
many authors. Given (G, <) as input, FF assigns to every vertex x, (1 < / < n) of 
G the smallest possible color from Z+, that is, the smallest color not yet assigned to 
any vertex adjacent to x, among the previously colored vertices. Woodall [1974] and 
independently Chrobak and Slusarek [1984] proved that if G is an interval graph, then 
FF(G) is bounded by a quadratic function of x(G) (note that x(G) = <o(G), since 
interval graphs are perfect; see Section 1.6), and they asked if a linear upper bound 
exists. W. Just improved the upper bound to 
FF(G)<c-x(G)-\ogx(G), 
where c > 0 is constant (see Gyärfäs and Lehel [1988]). The question by Woodall, 
Chrobak, and Slusarek was answered in the affirmative by Kierstead [1988], who 
proved that 
rFF(G) < 40 

174 
Algorithms 
for any interval graph G. The bound of 40 was further improved by Kierstead and 
J. Qin to 129/5 as reported by Kierstead and Trotter [1992]. The best known lower 
bound 
FF(G) s y · X(G) + c' 
for any interval graph G, and c' a constant, is due to M. Slusarek (see Gyärfäs and 
Lehel [1988]). 
Kierstead and Trotter [1981] obtained an exact answer for the on-line coloring 
problem restricted to interval graphs: There exists an on-line coloring algorithm A 
satisfying 
A(G) < 3*(G) - 2 
for any interval graph G. Moreover, this bound is best possible. 
A probabilistic result obtained by McDiarmid [1979] states that for any ε > 0 
almost all graphs G satisfy 
rFF(G) < 2 + e. 
Results on lower bounds for the algorithm FF were obtained by Kuöera [1991]. An-
thony and Biggs [1993] studied the expected number of colors used by the algorithm 
FF to color G when all possible orderings of the vertex set are considered equally 
likely to appear in the input. They called this number the "mean chromatic number" 
X(G), and proved that for paths and even cycles it approaches the value 3 as the length 
tends to infinity. 
■ 
10.7. EDGE-COLORING MULTIGRAPHS 
An edge-coloring of a graph or a multigraph G is an assignment of colors 
to the edges of G such that no two adjacent edges are assigned the same 
color. The edge-chromatic number x'(G) is the minimum number of 
colors needed in an edge-coloring of G. Does there exist a polynomial 
edge-coloring algorithm A such that either A{G) = x'(G) or A{G) ^ 
A(G) + 1, where A(G) is the number of colors A uses on G and A(G) is 
the maximum degree of G? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative is due to Goldberg [1984b], who 
proved that the problem of finding χ'(β) is polynomial on the class of multigraphs 
with x'(G) > (9A(G) + 6)/8. This result was also obtained by Hochbaum, Nishizeki, 
and Shmoys [1986]. In addition, Goldberg [1984a, 1984b] and Hochbaum, Nishizeki, 
and Shmoys [1986] obtained polynomial edge-coloring algorithms A with A(G) ^ 
(9x'(G) + 6)/8. 

Complexity of Directed-Graph Coloring 
175 
Hochbaum, Nishizeki, and Shmoys [ 1986] conjectured that there is a polynomial 
edge-coloring algorithm A with A(G) < x'(G) + 1. The truth of this would follow 
from the truth of Goldberg's conjecture stated above. 
For a simple graph G it was proved by V.G. Vizing that x'(G) is either A(G) or 
A(G) + 1 (Theorem 29 in Chapter 1). It is an NP-complete problem to decide for 
a given 3-regular simple graph G whether x'(G) = 3 or x'(G) = 4, as proved by 
Holyer[1981]. 
For the usual chromatic number χ no polynomial vertex-coloring algorithm A for 
which A(G) ^ c ■ x(G) + d, where c and d are constants and c < 2, can exist (unless 
NP = P). This is a result of Garey and Johnson [1976]. (For further information, see 
the discussion and the Theorem in Problem 10.1.) 
■ 
10.8. 
COMPLEXITY OF DIRECTED-GRAPH COLORING 
Let H be a fixed directed graph. An //-coloring of a directed graph G 
is a mapping / : V(G) —» V(H) such that f(x)f(y) 
is a directed edge 
of H whenever xy is a directed edge of G. Such an / is also called a 
homomorphism from G to H. For which H is there a polynomial algorithm 
to decide for any G whether G has an //-coloring? For which H is this 
decision problem MP-complete? 
■ 
The corresponding //-coloring problem for undirected graphs G and H with 
H = Kji, the complete graph with k vertices, asks whether there exists a usual k-
coloring of G. This problem is polynomially solvable for k s 2 and NP-complete for 
i t > 3 (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1). 
For undirected graphs and H bipartite, it is clear that G has an //-coloring if 
and only if G is bipartite. Hence the //-coloring problem is polynomially solvable 
if// is bipartite. Maurer, Sudborough, and Welzl [1981] and independently NeSetfil 
[1981] proved that if // is an odd cycle, then the problem of deciding //-colorability is 
W-complete, and they conjectured that it remains an NP-complete problem for any 
nonbipartite graph H. This conjecture was proved by Hell and Nesetril [1989,1990]. 
Thus the complexity of undirected //-coloring is well understood. 
Nesetiil [1981] proved that it is an WP-complete problem to decide, given any 
C3-colorable graph G (i.e., G is 3-colorable), whether G is Cs-colorable, where C* 
denotes the cycle of length k. This special problem on undirected //-coloring was 
also considered independently by Füredi, Griggs, and Kleitman [1989]. More general 
problems in this direction were treated by Brewster and MacGillivray [1991]. 
Gutjahr, Welzl, and Woeginger [1992] proved that the //-colorability problem 
can be solved by a polynomial algorithm when the underlying undirected graph of// 
is a path. However, they also proved that there exists an H for which the underlying 
graph is a tree, and the problem is NP-complete. 
Bang-Jensen, Hell, and MacGillivray [1988] considered the //-colorability prob-
lem for semicomplete digraphs //. These are directed graphs without any loops and

Algorithms 
with each pair of vertices joined by a directed edge in at least one direction. They 
proved that //-colorability is an W-complete problem if H is a semicomplete di-
graph containing at least two directed cycles, and that the problem can be solved by 
a polynomial algorithm otherwise. 
Bang-Jensen and Hell [1990] formulated the following conjecture: 
Conjecture. Let H be a directed graph without vertices of in-degree or out-degree 
zero. If H does not allow a homomorphism to its shortest directed cycle, then H-
colorability is NP-complete. Otherwise, H-colorability is polynomially decidable,

10.9. PRECEDENCE CONSTRAINED 
3-PROCESSOR SCHEDULING 
Is there a polynomial algorithm to solve the decision problem: Given an 
acyclic directed graph G and an integer k, is it possible to give a ^-coloring 
of the vertices of G, φ : V(G) — {1,2, ...,£}, so that 
(ί) φ(χ) < <p(y) for all .xy E E(G), and 
(ii) the number of vertices colored / is at most 3 for every / = 
\,2,...,kl 
■ 
The question seems first asked by Garey and Johnson [1977, 1979 (listed as 
open problem 8)]. They formulated an equivalent problem in terms of multiprocessor 
scheduling: When given a set T of tasks with a partial order ) on T describing the 
order in which pairs of tasks may be carried out, and a number m of processors that 
each can carry out one task per unit of time, can all tasks in T be carried out by the 
processors within a deadline D? With m = 3, D = k, and letting G be the directed 
graph corresponding to (T,)), one gets the formulation described above. 
Fujii, Kasami, and Ninomiya [1969] described a polynomial algorithm to solve 
the corresponding 2-processor problem, and thus answered the question for m = 2. 
Other algorithms for the 2-processor problem were presented by Coffman and Graham 
[1972] and Garey and Johnson [1977] (see also the informal essay on combinatorial 
scheduling theory by Graham [1978] containing outlines of all three algorithms). 
Concerning the w-processor problem for m > 2, Garey and Johnson [1979] 
remarked that it is not known for any fixed such m whether the /w-processor problem 
can be solved in polynomial time or is W-complete. If m itself is given as part of the 
input, the problem becomes NP-complete, as shown by Ullman [1975]. 
With condition (ii) left out, the problem becomes easy. In fact, it becomes 
equivalent to determining the length of a longest directed path in the acyclic G. 
With condition (i) left out, the problem can be restated in terms of undirected 
graph G: Is it possible to k-color G so that at most 3 (in general m) vertices receive 
the same color? For m — 2 this problem is solvable in polynomial time, since it is 
equivalent to finding a maximum matching in G, the complement of G, which can be 
done by the polynomial algorithm of Edmonds [1965b]. For m — 3 the problem of 
partitioning the vertices of G into triangles reduces to this problem, and this shows 
that it is NP-complete by a result of Garey and Johnson [1979].

11.1. DIRECT PRODUCT 
Let G X G' denote the direct product of G and G\ that is, the graph with 
vertex set V(G) X V(G') and edges (a,a')(b,b') 
for all ab G E(G) and 
a'b' G E(G'). It is easy to see that 
X(GXG')<mm{X(G),x(G')}. 
Does equality hold? 
■ 
This question was asked by Hedetniemi [1966]. It first went relatively unnoticed, 
but was later raised independently by others; in particular, L. Loväsz suggested the 
problem and attracted greater attention to it around 1972 [personal communication]. 
Also, Greenwell and Loväsz [1974] mentioned the question. 
Hedetniemi [1966] noted that the answer is affirmative for x(G) = x(G') = 3, 
and conjectured that the answer is affirmative in general. El-Zahar and Sauer [1985] 
proved this in the case x(G) = x(G') = 4. Duffus, Sands, and Woodrow [1985] gave 
a well-written and comprehensive survey of the problem. 
A number of partial results have been obtained by Duffus, Sands, and Woodrow 
[1985], and more recently, Sauer and Zhu [1992] attacked the conjecture with an 
original approach using Hajos' construction (see Theorem 18 in Chapter 1). 
The conjecture cannot be extended to infinite graphs. Miller [1968] proved 
that the direct product of all odd cycles C2n+i, for n ^ 1, is a bipartite infinite 
graph. Hajnal [1985] proved that the product of two N|-chromatic graphs may have 
countable chromatic number (see also Problem 16.13). 
The direct product was defined by Berge [1958] who called it simply the "prod-
uct" of graphs; independently Culik [1958] defined it as the "cardinal product." It 
was referred to by Ore [1962] as the "Cartesian product." Weichsel [1962] called it 
the "Kronecker product," and other authors (Harary and Trauth [1966], Harary and 
Wilcox [1967]) named it the "tensor product." Miller [1968] used the term "cate-
gorical product," Borowiecki [1972] the term "conjunction," Loväsz [1979] the term 
180

Wreath Product 
181 
"(weak) direct product," and Nesetril and Rödl [1983] the term "direct product." The 
latter seems to have become the most preferred. 
Nesetfil and Rödl [1985] described 28 (= 256) different products of two graphs 
G and G', all defined on the vertex set V(G) X V(G'), by considering for each pair of 
vertices x, y of G and each pair x', y'of G' the 22 combinations of xy and x'y' being or 
not being edges of G and G', respectively, and the 26 possible graphs on four labeled 
vertices. Pu§ [1988] studied the chromatic properties of these special products, and 
he proved that for every such product *, if there exists a function f(i,j) such that 
X(G*G') = 
f(x(G),x(G')), 
then either f(i,j) = 1, f(i,j) = /, f(i,j) = j , or f(i,j) = max(i,j), or possibly * is 
the direct product and f(i, j) = min(i,y). We note, however, that even with the vertex 
set restricted to V(G) X V(G'), products have been defined that do not belong to 
this particular class of products: for example, the "wreath product" by Anderson and 
Lipman [1985] (see Problem 11.2). 
■ 
11.2. WREATH PRODUCT 
Let GpG' denote the graph with vertex set V(G) X V(G') and an edge 
(x,x')(y,y') 
if and only if either x = y and x'y' £ E(G'), or xy E. E(G) 
and φ(χ') = y' for some automorphism φ : V(G') —» V(G') of G'. 
Is it true that if x'{G) = A(G), then x'iGpG') 
= MGpG1), where χ' 
denotes the edge-chromatic number and Δ the maximum degree? 
■ 
This was conjectured by Anderson and Lipman [1985]. The theorem of V.G. Viz-
ing (Theorem 29 in Chapter 1) implies that x'(GpG') is equal to either &(GpG') or 
MGpG') + 1. 
Sabidussi [1957, 1960] defined the "Cartesian product" GDG' with vertex set 
V(G) X V(G'), and an edge (x, x')(y, y') if and only if either x = y and x'y' G £(G'), 
or xy G £(G) and x' = y' (this product was studied earlier by Shapiro [1953]). If 
X'(G) = A(G), then *'(GDG') = A(GDG') (see exercise 6.2.6 in Bondy and Murty 
[1976]). It is clear that GDG' is a subgraph of GpG', and that they are identical if 
and only if G' has trivial automorphism group. 
The "lexicographic product" (sometimes referred to as the "composition") G[G'] 
of G with G', first defined by Harary [1959], has vertex set V(G) X V(G'), and an 
edge (x, x')(y, y') if and only if x = y and x'y' G E(G'), or xy G £(G). Anderson and 
Lipman [1985] proved for this (noncommutative) graph product that if x'(G) = A(G), 
then x\G[G')) = A(G[G']). The wreath product and the lexicographic product are 
related by GpG' C G[G'] with equality if and only if G' has transitive automorphism 
group. Vertex colorings of lexicographic products have also been investigated (see 
Ciiek and Klavzar [1993] and Kaschek and Klavzar [1993]).

11.3. A VERY STRONG PRODUCT 
A product * for graphs such that 
(i) G*G' 
can be obtained in a polynomial number of steps in the sizes 
\V(G)\ and \V(G')\, 
(ii) x(G) ■ x(G') > x(G * G') > c · x(G) ■ x(G') for some fixed constant 
c > 0 , 
appears unknown. Does such a product exist? With c = 1 ? With c > 3/4? 
If the answer is affirmative with c > 3/4, then this would give a new simple 
proof of the consequence of the theorem of C. Lund and M. Yannakakis (Theorem 20 
in Chapter 1), conjectured by Johnson [1978], that the existence of a polynomial 
graph coloring algorithm A using at most r\{G) + d colors to color any graph G {r 
and d being fixed constants) implies the existence of a polynomial algorithm A' to 
determine the exact value of x(G): Suppose that such an A exists and let N be any 
integer satisfying t** ~' 4N > r 3N + d. Apply A to the graph G*G* · ■ -*G(N factors) 
and determine if x(G) ^ 3, thus solving an W-complete problem polynomially; this 
implies the existence of A1 (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1). 
The theorem of C. Lund and M. Yannakakis (Theorem 20 in Chapter 1) is in fact a 
much more general theorem on approximative algorithms. However, the more general 
theorem does not seem to follow directly from the existence of a strong product. On 
the other hand, the existence of a strong product as described might perhaps be so 
strong as to imply the existence of a polynomial algorithm to determine the chromatic 
number of a graph, which would imply that NP = P (see Theorem 19 in Chapter 1). 
The special product © ("Cartesian sum") defined by Ore [1962]: 
(a) V(G © G') = V(G) X V(G'), and 
(b) (JC, x')(y, y') G E(G ®G')if 
and only if either xy G E(G) or x'y' e E(G') 
or both, 
might be a possible first guess. The chromatic properties of this product were in-
vestigated by Yang [1968], Borowiecki [1972], and Pus [1988]. It is not difficult 
to see that x(G © G') £ x(G) ■ x(G'), and that equality does not always hold. 
For example, x(C5 © C5) ^ 8, as pointed out by Borowiecki [1972]. Ciiek and 
Klavzar [1993] proved that if G and G' are vertex-critical and not complete, then 
X(G © G') < x(G) ■ x(G'). There does not seem to be any known lower bound better 
than x(G ©G')^ 
c· maxfaiG), x(G')} for a constant c > 0 (see the survey by Cizek 
and Klavzar [1993]). 
A weaker product, usually called "the strong product," has been investigated in 
detail by Vesztergombi [1981] and recently by Klavzar [1993]. This product of G 
and G' is defined as the graph with vertex set V(G) X V(G') and having an edge 

Hajos Versus Ore 
183 
(x, x')(y, y') whenever either [x = v and x'y1 £ £(G')] or [xy £ E(G) and x' = y'] 
or [xy £ £(G) and x'y' £ E(G')]. The strong product of G and G' is a subgraph of 
the Cartesian sum G © G'.

11.4. GALLAI'S PROBLEM ON DIRAC'S CONSTRUCTION 
Let G be a graph obtained from two disjoint graphs Gi and G2 by joining 
some of the vertices of Gi to some of the vertices of G2. Consider the 
statements 
(a) G\ and G2 are both critical, 
(b) G\ and G2 are completely joined in G, 
(c) G is critical. 
Under what circumstances do (a) and (c) together imply (b)? 
■ 
This question is due to T. Gallai [personal communication in 1969]. That (a) and 
(b) together imply (c) is the construction by Dirac [1952a] (see also the important 
paper of Gallai [1963a]). Moreover, (b) and (c) together imply (a). 
As noted by Gallai, the question has an affirmative answer when G\ and G2 
are both complete. This is in fact the statement that the complement of a bipartite 
graph is perfect, first proved by D. König and Gallai [1959]. This result was used as 
a lemma by Brown and Jung [1969] and Toft [1972a, 1974a]. Stiebitz and Wessel 
[1993] answered Gallai's question completely in the case when G\ is a complete 
graph and G2 an odd cycle. 
As shown by Youngs [1992], one can obtain a 4-critical graph from two 7-cycles 
by joining some of the vertices of one cycle to some of the vertices of the other. 
Thus (a) and (c) do not imply (b) when G\ and G2 are odd cycles. It remains open to 
characterize the pairs of cycle lengths for which it is possible to obtain 4-critical or 
5-critical graphs in this fashion. 
■ 
11.5. HAJOS VERSUS ORE 
A graph is Hajos-fc-constructible if it can be obtained from complete 
^-graphs Kk by repeated applications of the following two operations: 
(a) (Hajos' construction) Let G\ and G2 be already obtained disjoint 
graphs with edges XjVi and jc2y2. Remove xxy\ and x2y2, identify xx 
and x2, and join yi and y2 by an edge. 
(b) Identify independent vertices (replace multiple by single edges). 

184 
Constructions 
Such a Hajos-£-constructible graph is said to be Ore-/t-constructible if 
operation (b) is used following operation (a) only on pairs (zj, z 2),..., 
(z\, z,2) of vertices, where z{, z\ 
z) are distinct vertices of G) - JCJ and 
z2, z\,..., 
z2 are distinct vertices of G2 — x2. 
Is every Hajos-£-constructible graph Ore-£-constructible? 
■ 
Hajos f 1961] proved that a graph has chromatic number at least it if and only 
if it contains a Hajos-£-constructible subgraph (Theorem 18 in Chapter 1). Ore 
[1967] noted that the proof shows that it must in fact contain an Ore-/t-constructible 
subgraph, and remarked that for some applications it is essential to use the more 
specific form, but he did not give any examples to show this. 
From the definition it seems that the class of Ore-fc-constructible graphs is much 
more restricted than the class of Hajos-£-constructible graphs. But no example of 
a Hajos-&-constructible graph that is not Ore-£-constructible seems to be known. 
This problem was mentioned by Hanson, Robinson, and Toft [1986]. A striking 
difference between the two definitions is that there seems to be no immediate finite 
algorithm to decide whether a given graph is Hajos-£-constructible or not (for Ore-
it-constructibility it is a finite process to check all possibilities). One might speculate 
that perhaps there exist graphs for which this is an undecidable problem. Undecidable 
graph coloring problems were studied by Burr [1984]. 
In his talk given at the 25th anniversary celebration in 1992 at the Department 
of Combinatorics and Optimization, University of Waterloo, Canada, W.T. Tutte 
addressed the peculiar feature of Hajos' theorem that it seems to promise so much 
and yet has achieved so little. Tutte [ 1992] proved Hajos' theorem in a slightly stronger 
form than the original; sufficiently strong to obtain Brooks' theorem (Theorem 11 in 
Chapter 1) as a consequence. 
■ 
11.6. LENGTH OF HAJOS PROOFS 
If a graph G has chromatic number at least k, then this can be proved by 
a Hajos proof, which consists in constructing G from complete ^-graphs 
by the following operations: 
(a) (Hajos' construction) If G, and G2 are already obtained disjoint 
graphs, then remove an edge xxyx from G\ and an edge x2y2 from 
G2, identify JC, and x2 and add the edge yty2. 
(b) Identify two vertices not joined by an edge in an already obtained 
graph (replace multiple by single edges). 
(c) Add new vertices and edges to an already obtained graph. 
How long is a Hajos proof for a graph on n vertices? Are there interesting 
classes of graphs for which Hajos proofs are short? 
■ 

Construction οΓ Hajos Generalized by Dirac 
185 
Loväsz [1982] wrote that the algorithmic complexity aspect of the theorem of 
Hajos [1961] (Theorem 18 in Chapter 1) is an unexplored territory. He also remarked 
that the perfect graphs are those obtainable in just one step. Mansfield and Welsh 
[1982] initiated a complexity study. Among other things they noted that a polynomial 
upper bound on the length of a Hajos proof in terms of \V(G)\ would imply that 
NP = co-NP, which is considered unlikely. 
A more restricted type of Hajos proof was introduced by Ore [1967], who 
proved that one may restrict the use of operation (b) to identifying vertices of G\ with 
vertices of G2 following a use of operation (a). Using the result that there are c(" * 
nonisomorphic ^-critical graphs on n vertices for k 5: 4, due to V. Rödl and published 
by Toft [1985], Hanson, Robinson, and Toft [1986] observed that there are graphs 
on n vertices for which a shortest Hajos proof of Ore type requires at least en/ log n 
uses of operation (a). 
■ 
11.7. HAJOS CONSTRUCTIONS OF CRITICAL GRAPHS 
A ^-critical graph can be obtained from complete ^-graphs by the follow-
ing two operations: 
(a) (Hajos' construction) If G\ and G2 are already obtained disjoint 
graphs, then remove an edge x^yx from G\ and an edge x2y2 from 
G2, identify x\ and x2 and add the edge yiy2. 
(b) Identify two vertices not joined by an edge in an already obtained 
graph (replace multiple by single edges). 
Can every ^-critical graph G be obtained in this way such that the graphs 
in each step of the construction of G are all Λ-critical, when 4 < k ^ 7? 
■ 
The result given above follows from the theorem of Hajos [1961] (Theorem 18 in 
Chapter 1), and the problem is due to Hajos [personal communication from T. Gallai 
in 1969]. 
For general k the answer is NO, as shown by the 8-chromatic counterexample 
to Hajos' conjecture due to Catlin [1979] (see Problem 6.2). But perhaps it is true 
for general k that operation (a) can always be restricted to be used on ^-critical 
graphs exclusively? For the restriction of Hajos' construction due to Ore [1967] (see 
Problem 11.5), this last question has a negative answer for k s 6, as noted by Hanson, 
Robinson, and Toft [1986]. 
■ 
11.8. 
CONSTRUCTION OF HAJOS GENERALIZED BY DIRAC 
Let G\ and G2 be disjoint ^-critical graphs (k 2: 4) and for i — 1,2 let //, 
be a complete Λ-graph in G, where 1 < h < k — 2. For i = 1,2 let yt be 

186 
Constructions 
a vertex of G, - //, joined to a vertex *, of//,. Obtain G from Gt and G2 
by identifying //, and // 2 to a new complete A-graph H so that *ι and x2 
are identified, delete the edges χ^ and join y\ and y2 by a new edge. Is G 
^-critical? 
■ 
This question was asked in the excellent survey of critical graphs with vertices 
of degree k - 1 by Sachs and Stiebitz [1989]. The construction is due to G.A. Dirac, 
who may have known the answer to the problem. 
For h = 1 the construction is the well-known construction of Hajos [1961] (see 
Theorem 18 in Chapter 1). For h £ 2 the answer is affirmative, and this is also the 
case in general when each vertex x of H is joined to either y\ or yi in G. Thus the 
question asks if criticality is preserved, also when this condition is not fulfilled. 
■ 
11.9. FOUR-CHROMATICITY IN TERMS 
OF 3-COLORABILITY 
Let x(G) s 4 and G ~£ K4. Does G contain two vertices x and y and 
two 3-colorable subgraphs Gi and G2, both containing x and y, but not 
containing the edge xy such that 
(a) in every 3-coloring of Gi the independent vertices x and y get different 
colors, and 
(b) in every 3-coloring of G2 the independent vertices x and y get the 
same color? 
■ 
This question was raised by B. Toft in lectures on graph coloring theory at the 
University of Regina in 1985. 
With 4 replaced by 3 (and K4 by Ki) the answer is affirmative. With 4 replaced 
by any Λ > 6 (and AT4 by K^) the answer is negative. For example, for k = 8 this is 
shown by the 8-chromatic counterexample to Hajos' conjecture, due to Catlin [1979], 
by an argument of Hanson, Robinson, and Toft [1986] (it does not contain a subgraph 
of type G2). 
Tutte [1992] observed that for every pair of vertices x and y of distance 2 in 
a <fe-critical graph, there is always a (k - l)-colorable subgraph containing x and 
y, in which x and v must receive different colors in any (k — l)-coloring. Hence 
subgraphs of type G\ always exist. Tutte's observation implies that if x(G) & k, then 
G contains k vertices x\,x2 
** and a collection of (k — l)-colorable subgraphs 
dj, 1 < j < y < &, such that G,j contains *, and Xj, and *, and xj receive different 
colors in any (k - l)-coloring of Gy. (For a proof, consider a ^-critical subgraph, 
any one of its vertices x\, and any k — 1 neighbors X2,X3,...Xk, and use Tutte's 
observation for those pairs / and j such that JC, and Xj are nonadjacent. Note that 
Gij = K2 for ally.) 
This gives a characterization of graphs of chromatic number at least k in terms 
of (k — l)-colorability. This characterization does not give a polynomial explanation

of x(G) s 4, that is, the characterization is not "good" in the sense of Edmonds 
[1965b]. A polynomial explanation of x(G) 2: 4 cannot be expected, since then the 
iVP-complete problem "x(G) s 3?" would also be in co-NP and hence NP — co-NP. 
This is considered unlikely (see Garey and Johnson [1979]).

Edge Colorings 
12.1. GOLDBERG'S CONJECTURE 
If X'(G) > A(G) + 2, is it then true that x'(G) = w(G) with 
w(G) = max 
HCG 
Γ e(H) Ί 
lu«(//)jr 
where e(H) and v(//) denote the number of edges and vertices of H, 
respectively? 
■ 
If x'(G) s A(G) + 2, then by the theorem of Vizing [1964] (Theorem 29 in 
Chapter 1) G has multiple edges. All graphs G satisfy w(G) s 
x'(G). 
The question seems to have been thought of first by Goldberg [1973, 1984b] 
around 1970. An early related result is due to Vizing, who proved in his doctoral 
dissertation in 1968 that if G is a multigraph for which x'(G) equals the general upper 
bound 3A(G)/2 of Shannon [1949], then G contains a subgraph on three vertices 
and 3A(G)/2 edges, implying that x'(G) = w(G) [personal communication from 
Goldberg in 1986]. 
Equivalent conjectures have been stated by others, in particular by Andersen 
[1977] and Seymour [1979a]. 
Conjecture (Andersen [1977]). Let G be critical w.r.t. χ' and let x'{G) s A(G) + 
2. Then for any edge e & E(G) there is a (x'(G) — \)-edge coloring ofG — e such 
that no color is missing at two different vertices. 
The fact that Andersen's conjecture is equivalent to Goldberg's conjecture was 
proved by Goldberg [1984b]. 
Giving another equivalent formulation, Seymour [1979a] asked, independently 
of Goldberg and Andersen: If G is any graph or multigraph, is 
X'(G) < max{A(G) + l,w(G)}?

Jakobsen's Conjecture 
191 
Seymour also suggested a weaker conjecture (Problem 12.3) equivalent to the state-
ment that any graph or multigraph G satisfies x'(G) ^ max{A(G), w(G)} + 1. 
An affirmative answer to Goldberg's conjecture has been proved for A(G) ^ 7 
by Andersen [1977], for A(G) < 9 by Goldberg [1977, 1984b], and for A(G) ^ 11 
by Nishizeki and Kashiwagi [1985, 1990]. Marcotte [1990] has proved that the 
conjecture is true for any graph that does not contain the graph K$ (the complete 
5-graph minus one edge) as a minor (i.e., as a subcontraction, a graph obtained by 
successive deletions of edges and vertices and contractions of edges). 
Plantholt and Tipnis [1991] verified the conjecture for all multigraphs G with 
sufficiently high maximum degree A(G) relative to the number of vertices and tne 
multiplicity of G. 
Goldberg [1984b] also stated his problem with the roles of Δ and w interchanged: 
If x'(G) > w(G) + 2, is it then true that x'(G) = A(G)? Equivalently, is 
X'(G) < max{A(G),w(G) + 1}? 
■ 
12.2. JAKOBSEN'S CONJECTURE 
Let G be critical w.r.t. χ'. lfm is odd, « 5 3, and 
„ _. 
m · A(G) + (m - 3) 
is it then true that G has at most m — 2 vertices? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative was formulated by Jakobsen [ 1975], 
who noted from the so-called "ring multigraphs" (e.g., a 5-cycle with two more copies 
of each edge added) that it would be best possible. Andersen [ 1977] stated a conjecture 
(equivalent to a conjecture of Goldberg [1973, 1984b]; see Problem 12.1 for both 
conjectures), and he proved that an affirmative answer to that conjecture implies an 
affirmative answer to Jakobsen's question. Hence Jakobsen's question is a weaker 
version of Goldberg's conjecture. 
For m = 3 the affirmative answer is the theorem of Shannon [1949]. For m = 5 
it was obtained by B.Aa. S0rensen [unpublished], Andersen [1977], and Goldberg 
[1973], for m — 7 by B.Aa. S0rensen [unpublished] and Andersen [1977], for m = 9 
by Goldberg [1977, 1984b], and for m = 11 by Nishizeki and Kashiwagi [1985, 
1990]. 
An affirmative answer to the problem in general implies that if G is critical w.r.t. 
χ' and x'(G) s A(G) + 2, then 
|V(G)| < A(G) - 1 if A(G) > 2 and A(G) is even, and 
\V(G)\ < A(G) - 2 if A(G) > 3 and A(G) is odd. 

192 
Edge Colorings 
Hence for a fixed A(G) (or a fixed x'(G)) there are only finitely many critical 
graphs with x'(G) & A(G) + 2, assuming an affirmative answer to Jakobsen's conjec-
ture. Also this weak version of Jakobsen's conjecture (and of Goldberg's conjecture) 
seems unsolved. 
■ 
12.3. SEYMOUR'S r-MULTIGRAPH CONJECTURE 
Let r > 1. A multigraph G is said to be an r-multigraph if G is r -regular 
and for all X C V(G) with |X| odd, the number of edges between X 
and V(G) — X is at least r (in particular, |V(G)| is even). If G is an 
r -multigraph, is it true that x'(G) < r + 1 ? 
■ 
This problem is due to Seymour [1979a], who mentioned that the answer is 
affirmative for r < 6, and conjectured that the answer is affirmative in general. 
Moreover, he related the conjecture to other problems; in particular, a positive answer 
to the conjecture of Goldberg [ 1973, 1984b] implies a positive answer to Seymour's 
question (see Problem 12.1): Let for any graph or multigraph G 
w(G) — max 
HCG 
Γ e(H) 1 
|iH")J|' 
where e(H) and v(H) denote the number of edges and vertices of H, respectively. 
Then, as proved by Seymour [1979a], the conjecture on r-multigraphs is equivalent to 
x'(G) < max{A(G),w(G)} + 1. 
The conjecture by Goldberg is equivalent to 
x\G) < max{A(G) + IMG)}. 
From the partial results for Goldberg's conjecture, the answer to Seymour's 
problem is affirmative for r < 11. 
■ 
12.4. WEAK CRITICAL GRAPH CONJECTURE 
Does there exist a constant c > 2 such that if G is a multigraph of 
maximum degree Δ that is critical w.r.t. χ' and satisfies x\G) ^ A(G) 4- 1 
and \V(G)\ < c · Δ, then \V(G)\ must be odd? 
■ 
Jakobsen [1974] formulated what came to be known as "the critical graph conjec-
ture," that any graph or multigraph critical w.r.t. χ' and satisfying χ' > Δ must have 
an odd number of vertices. Beineke and Wilson [1973] independently formulated a 

Vizing's Planar Graph Conjecture 
193 
similar conjecture. The critical graph conjecture was eventually disproved: Goldberg 
[1979, 1981] found infinitely many counterexamples for Δ = 3 . Counterexamples 
for Δ = 4 were found by Fiol [1980], who obtained such an example with only 18 
vertices. However, counterexamples with Δ s 5 have not been found. For a detailed 
discussion of the critical graph conjecture, see the expository paper by Chetwynd and 
Wilson [1983]. 
According to Yap [1980], Goldberg formulated the question above and conjec-
tured that the answer is affirmative. From the known counterexamples to the critical 
graph conjecture, c would have to be strictly smaller than 9/2. We do not know if the 
conjecture can be proved for c — 2 or any value of c between 1 and 2.

12.5. CRITICAL MULTIGRAPH CONJECTURE 
If G is critical w.r.t. χ' and satisfies x'(G) ^ A(G) + 2, is it then true that 
|V(G)|isodd? 
■ 
G has multiple edges by the theorem of Vizing [ 1964] (Theorem 29 in Chapter 1), 
which states that if G is simple, then x'(G) ^ A(G) + 1. The corresponding question 
with the assumption x'(G) S: A(G) + 2 replaced by x'(G) & A(G) + 1 was asked 
by Jakobsen [1974]. Beineke and Wilson [1973] independently asked a very similar 
question. But counterexamples with x'(G) = A(G) + 1 = 4 and 5 were found by 
Goldberg [1979, 1981] and Fiol [1980] (see also Yap [1980]). 
The question has an affirmative answer if Goldberg's conjecture (Problem 12.1) 
has an affirmative answer. This was pointed out by Andersen [1977]. 
■ 
12.6. VIZING'S 2-FACTOR CONJECTURE 
Let G be a simple graph. If G is critical w.r.t. χ' and x'(G) = A(G) + 1, 
does G have a 2-factor, that is, a spanning 2-regular subgraph? 
■ 
Vizing [1965b] conjectured that the answer is affirmative. 
A related conjecture by Fiorini and Wilson [1978], that every critical graph with 
an even number of vertices has a 1-factor, was disproved by Choudum [1993]. 
■ 
12.7. VIZING'S PLANAR GRAPH CONJECTURE 
Let G be a simple planar graph of maximum degree A(G) equal to either 
6 or 7. Is x'(G) = A(G)? 
■ 
This question is due to Vizing [1965a, 1968], who proved that the answer is 
positive for A(G) s= 8 and negative for A(G) ^ 5. Since G is simple, G satisfies 

194 
Edge Colorings 
A(G) < x'(G) ^ A(G) + I by the theorem of Vizing [1964] (Theorem 29 in Chap-
ter 1). 
O. V. Borodin [personal communication in 1993] attracted our attention to a much 
more general result proved by Vizing [1965a]: For k > 0 and G any simple graph, 
not necessarily planar, 
col(G) < k 
A(G) > 2k :
41J=*X'(G) = A(G). 
Since any planar graph G satisfies col(G) ^ 6 by Euler's formula, the positive 
answer follows for A(G) 5: 10. Vizing provided additional arguments showing that 
the bound A(G) > 10 can be weakened to A(G) > 8. 
■ 
12.8. MINIMAL NUMBER OF EDGES IN 
^-CRITICAL GRAPHS 
Let G be a simple graph on n vertices. If G is critical w.r.t. χ' and 
X'(G) = A(G) + 1, is it true that 
2|£(G)| > n ■ (A(G) - 1) + 3? 
■ 
This question is due to Vizing [1965b, 1968]. Vizing [1968] remarked that 
its truth would imply a positive answer to the case A(G) = 7 of the planar graph 
conjecture of Vizing [1965a] (Problem 12.7). The cases A(G) < 5 have affirmative 
solutions, see K. Kayathri's paper in Graphs Combin. 10,139-144, 1994. 
The truth of the statement implies that |£(G)| > (A(G))2/2. Vizing [1968] re-
marked: "// is not clear how to prove this even in the case when A(G) is even and the 
critical graph has A(G) + 1 vertices'.' This case was, however, solved by Plantholt 
[1981]. Further results in this direction, when n is small compared to Δ, were obtained 
by Plantholt [1983] and Chetwynd and Hilton [1984a, 1984b, 1989b]. For Δ > n/3 
an affirmative answer to Vizing's question would follow from an affirmative answer 
to Hilton's overfull subgraph conjecture (Problem 12.10). 
The same question for multigraphs has a negative answer. Chetwynd and Hilton 
[1988a] found a critical multigraph of maximum degree 7 with nine vertices and 
twenty-eight edges. This example is obtained from the Petersen graph by replacing 
every edge xy of a 1-factor by five parallel edges joining x to v, followed by the 
deletion of one vertex from the resulting graph. 
12.9. 
INDEPENDENT SETS IN ^'-CRITICAL GRAPHS 
Let G be a simple graph on n vertices, with x'(G) = A(G) + 1, and 
X'(G') < A(G) for every proper subgraph G' of G. Is it true that G cannot 
have more than n/2 pairwise nonadjacent vertices? 
■ 

The Δ-Subgraph Conjecture 
195 
Vizing [1968] remarked: "// appears perfectly natural (...) How can this be 
proved?" 
■ 
12.10. HILTON'S OVERFULL SUBGRAPH CONJECTURE 
A simple graph His called overfull if \E(H)\ > MH) ■ {\V(H)\/2\ 
(imply-
ing that χ'(Η) > Δ(//)). Let G be any simple graph. If G contains an over-
full subgraph H with Δ(//) = A(G), then this implies x\G) 
= A(G) + 1. 
Is the converse implication true, assuming that A(G) > |V(G)|/3? 
■ 
The question was raised by A.J.W. Hilton at the meeting in Sandbjerg, Denmark, 
June 1985. It appeared in print in Chetwynd and Hilton [1986, 1989b]. 
The theorem of Vizing [1964] (Theorem 29 in Chapter 1) states that if G is 
simple, then x'(G) < A(G) + 1. Thus equality holds in x'(G) > χ'(Η) > MH) + 
1 = A(G) + 1 when H is a subgraph of G as above. 
If A(G) s | V(G)|/3, the converse implication is not always true, as can be seen 
from the Petersen graph with one vertex removed. 
The conjecture is true for all G such that A(G) s | V(G)| — 3, as proved in papers 
byPlantholt[1981,1983] and by Chetwynd and Hilton [1984a, 1984b, 1989b]. Hilton 
[1989] has announced that the conjecture has been proved by Chetwynd and himself 
in the case when A(G) > (V21 - 1) · (|V(G)| + l)/4 + 1 and \E(G)\ = L|K(G)|/2J. 
Many interesting consequences of Hilton's overfull subgraph conjecture were 
described by Hilton and Johnson [1987]. In particular, the following two conjectures 
on graphs G that are vertex-critical w.r.t. χ'; that is, G is simple, x'(G) = A(G) + 1, 
and x'(G - v) < X'(G) for all v G V(G): 
Conjecture 1. Let G be a simple graph with an even number of vertices and 
satisfying A(G) > | V(G)|/3. Then G is not vertex-critical w.r.t. χ'. 
Conjecture 2. Let G be a simple graph with A(G) 2: |V(G)|/2. Then G is vertex-
critical w.r.t. χ' if and only ifG is overfull. 
It seems unknown both how to prove the "if" part and how to prove the "only if" 
part of the latter conjecture without assuming Hilton's overfull subgraph conjecture. 
The condition A(G) s |V(G)|/2 cannot be sharpened, as can be seen from infinitely 
many examples, constructed by Hilton and Johnson [1987], of overfull graphs G with 
A(G) = (|V(G)| - l)/2 that are not vertex-critical w.r.t. χ'. 
M 12.11. 
THE Δ-SUBGRAPH CONJECTURE 
Let G be a simple graph of maximum degree Δ, and let G^ denote the 
subgraph induced by the vertices of degree Δ in G. If 

196 
Edge Colorings 
(i) Δ > f(|V(G)| - 3), and 
(ii) G4 has minimum degree at most 1, 
is*'(G) = A? 
■ 
This was conjectured by Chetwynd and Hilton [1989a], who proved that the 
answer is affirmative if (i) is replaced by 
As[^|V(G)|J+^|V(CA)|-3. 
and that (i) would be best possible. 
If G is a simple graph such that G& is a forest (i.e., without cycles), then x\G) = 
A(G), as proved by Fournier [ 1973]. This also follows from Vizing 's adjacency lemma 
(Vizing [1965a]; see also Chapter 11 in the book by Fiorini and Wilson [1977]): If// is 
a critical graph with maximum degree Δ, that is, χ'(Η) = Δ + 1 and χ'(Η - e) = Δ 
for every edge e 6E £(//), and if u and v are adjacent vertices of//, where the degree 
of v is d, then 
(i) if d < Δ, then u is adjacent to at least Δ — d + 1 vertices of degree Δ, and 
(ii) if öf = Δ, then u is adjacent to at least two vertices of degree Δ. 
The truth of the conjecture would follow from the truth of Hilton's overfull 
subgraph conjecture (Problem 12.10), as proved by Chetwynd and Hilton [1989a]. 
Generalizations of Fournier's result were obtained by Hoffman and Rodger 
[1988]. 
■ 
12.12. REGULAR GRAPHS OF HIGH DEGREE 
Let G be a ^-regular simple graph with an even number of vertices and 
such that k > |V(G)|/2. Is G 1-factorizable (i.e., /fc-edge-colorable)? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative appeared in Chetwynd and Hilton 
[1985]. The question may go back to G.A. Dirac in the early 1950s (see Chetwynd 
and Hilton [1989c]). An interesting consequence is that for any regular graph G 
with an even number of vertices, either G or its complement G has a 1-factorization. 
One might possibly consider a similar statement for nonregular graphs: Is it true 
for every simple graph G with an even number of vertices that either x\G) = A(G) 
or x'(G) = A(G)? Hilton [1989] proved that Hilton's overfull subgraph conjecture 
(Problem 12.10) would imply the conjecture above on ^-regular simple graphs. 
Chetwynd and Hilton [1985] proved the conjecture for k > |V(G)| - 5. They 
also proved that if G is ^-regular with \V(G)\ even and k > 0.849 · |V(G)|, then 
G is 1-factorizable; later Chetwynd and Hilton [1989c] improved the bound to k £ 
\(\Jl — 1) ■ |V(G)|, and this appears to be the best known result ofthis type. Chetwynd 

Petersen Coloring 
197 
and Hilton [1985] remarked that R. Häggkvist has announced that for any ε > 0 there 
exists N > 0 so that every &-regular graph G with an even number of vertices and 
satisfying \V(G)\ s N and k > (± + e) · |V(G)| is 1-factorizable. 
A slightly stronger version of the conjecture was mentioned by Chetwynd and 
Hilton [1985]: If G is it-regular on 2n vertices, where k > 2[(n + l)/2j - 1, is G 
1-factorizable? 
Chetwynd and Hilton [1985] made an even stronger conjecture: Let n > /c > 2. 
If G is ^-regular and |V(G)| = 2«, is it true that the complement G has a 1-factor 
F such that both G U F and G - E{F) have 1-factorizations, unless k is odd and G 
is the graph KkJl1 Faudree and Sheehan [1984] asked the same question without the 
condition on G — E(F). 
■ 
12.13. BERGE AND FULKERSON'S CONJECTURE 
If G is a 3-regular simple graph without bridges and H is obtained from 
G by duplicating each edge, is it then true that H is 6-edge-colorable? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative is due to C. Berge (see Seymour 
[1979a]) and Fulkerson [1971], who first formulated it in print. A weaker version 
of the conjecture suggests that the edges of G can be covered with five 1-factors. 
This would immediately follow from a 6-edge coloring of H after deleting one color 
class. The weaker conjecture is also due to C. Berge [personal communication from 
F. Jaeger in 1994]. 
An attractive equivalent reformulation of the conjecture is the following, where 
a graph is called "even" if each of its vertices has an even degree. Is it true that 
the edge set of any graph without bridges can be covered with a family of six even 
subgraphs, with repetitions allowed, such that every edge is contained in exactly 
four members of the family? The equivalence of the two questions was explained 
by Jaeger [1988]. The 8-flow theorem (see Section 1.8) is equivalent to the weaker 
statement obtained by replacing "six even subgraphs" by "seven even subgraphs." 
See also Problems 12.14 and 13.2 for related questions and discussion. 
Support of the conjecture was found by Seymour [1979a], who proved that it 
is possible to find two families T\ and T2 of 1-factors of H such that every edge is 
contained exactly once more in a member of T\ than in a member of T2. Berge and 
Fulkerson's conjecture is equivalent to the same statement with Ti = 0 . 
■ 
12.14. PETERSEN COLORING 
If G is a 3-regular bridge-less graph, is it possible to color the edges of 
G, using the edges of the Petersen graph as colors, in such a way that any 
three mutually adjacent edges of G are also colored with three edges that 
are mutually adjacent in the Petersen graph? 
■ 

198 
Edge Colorings 
The question was asked by Jaeger [1988], who conjectured that the answer 
is affirmative. This would imply the conjecture of C. Berge and Fulkerson [1971] 
on multicolorings of cubic graphs (Problem 12.13). It would also imply the cycle 
double cover conjecture by Szekeres [1973] and Seymour [1979b], who conjectured 
independently that every bridge-less graph has a family of cycles, possibly with 
repetitions, such that every edge of the graph is contained in precisely two of the 
cycles. 
■ 
12.15. TUTTE'S CONJECTURE ON 3-EDGE COLORINGS 
Let G be a 3-regular simple graph without bridges and without a subdi-
vision of the Petersen graph as a subgraph. Is x'{G) = 3? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative is due to Tutte [1966, 1969] (see 
also early roots of the question in Descartes [1948a], as well as the delightful paper 
by Tutte [1978]). 
It is a consequence of the conjecture that if G is a planar 3-regular simple 
graph without bridges, then x'(G) = 3. This statement is equivalent to the four-color 
theorem by the theorem of P.G. Tait (Theorem 26 in Chapter 1; see also Fiorini and 
Wilson [1977]). 
Tutte's conjecture implies the conjecture of H. Grötzsch, that if G is a planar 
graph of maximum degree three, then G is 3-edge-colorable if and only if G does not 
contain a subgraph all of whose vertices have degree three, except for one vertex of 
degree two (see Seymour [1981b]). Seymour [1981b] observed that the conjecture 
of Grötzsch implies that if G is a 3-regular bridge-less graph with a vertex v so that 
G - v is planar, then G can be 3-edge-colored. This is directly implied by Tutte's 
conjecture, since the graph obtained from the Petersen graph by deleting a vertex is 
nonplanar. See also Problem 13.2. 
Examples of 3-regular simple graphs G without bridges having x'(G) = 4 (called 
"snarks" by Gardner [1976], and usually taken to contain no edge cut of size 3 or 
less that separates two cycles, and to be without cycles of length less than five) are 
difficult to find (Descartes [1948a]), but since the paper of Isaacs [1975], several 
families of snarks have been found (see the excellent survey by Watkins [1989]). 
However, it is unlikely that a simple characterization of such graphs can be found; it 
is an JVP-complete problem to recognize a snark by a result of Holyer [1981]. 
Jaeger and Swart [ 1980] conjectured that every snark has a cycle of length at most 
six. This conjecture was disproved by M. Kochol, who produced examples of snarks 
with arbitrarily long shortest cycles, that is, of arbitrarily high girth. This was done 
using a general construction of graphs without £-flows from existing ones, for t s 4 , 
due to M. Kochol and M. Skoviera [personal communication from M. Skoviera in 
1994]. See Problem 13.2 for the extension, in terms of fc-flows, of Tutte's conjecture 
to bridge-less graphs in general. 
Supporting results for Tutte's conjecture were given by Seymour [1979a]. An 
interesting partial result was obtained by Ellingham 11984], who noted that the 2-

Grötzsch and Seymour's Conjecture 
199 
factor theorem of Petersen [1891] can be used to classify all 3-regular bridge-less 
graphs according to the number of odd and even cycles in 2-factors. In terms of 
2-factors, Tutte's conjecture is equivalent to the statement that every bridge-less 3-
regular graph without a subdivision of the Petersen graph as a subgraph has a 2-factor 
consisting of a disjoint union of even cycles. Ellingham considered 3-regular graphs 
with 2-factors consisting of precisely two odd cycles without diagonals. He proved 
Tütte's conjecture for these graphs by proving that each either contains a subdivision 
of the Petersen graph as a subgraph or has a Hamilton cycle (i.e., a 2-factor consisting 
of only one even cycle). 
■ 
12.16. GRÖTZSCH AND SEYMOUR'S CONJECTURE 
A simple graph H is called overfull if \E(H)\ > Δ(//) · |JV(//)|/2j (im-
plying that χ'{Η) > Δ(//)). If G is any simple planar graph, is it true that 
either χ'(β) 
= A(G) or G has an overfull subgraph// with Δ(//) = A(G)? 
The affirmative answer was conjectured by Seymour [1979c]. The special case of 
the conjecture with A(G) = 3 is due to H. Grötzsch (see Seymour [1981b]): Is it true 
that if G is any planar graph of maximum degree three, then G is 3-edge-colorable if 
and only if no subgraph of G can be obtained from a 3-regular graph by deleting an 
edge and replacing it by a path of length two? 
Grötzsch and Seymour's conjecture was formulated independently by Hoffman, 
Mitchem, and Schmeichel [ 1992], who also listed a number of its implications, among 
them the following: 
(i) The four-color theorem. 
(ii) The planar graph conjecture of Vizing [1965a] (Problem 12.7). 
(Hi) The critical graph conjecture (Jakobsen [ 1974], Beineke and Wilson [ 1973]) 
for planar graphs (see Problems 12.4 and 12.5). 
(iv) A polynomial algorithm for determining x'(G) for any planar graph G. 
(v) The statement that for any (A(G) - 1 )-edge-connected planar graph G, 
either x'{G) = A(G), or G is overfull. 
Each of (ii)-(v) seems open. A further implication (also open) is 
(vi) Every planar graph G satisfies x'{G) = max{A(G), w(G)}, where w(G) is 
the parameter of G defined in Problem 12.1. 
Kilakos and Shepherd [1993] have suggested the strengthening of (vi) that the con-
clusion holds not only for planar graphs, but for all graphs that do not contain a 
subdivision of the graph obtained from the Petersen graph by deleting any vertex.

CYCLE-DECOMPOSABLE 4-REGULAR 
PLANE MULTIGRAPHS 
Let G be a 4-regular plane multigraph, and suppose that G has a cycle 
decomposition S; that is, each edge is contained in exactly one cycle of 
S, such that every pair of adjacent edges in the same face are always in 
different cycles of the decomposition. Is x'{G) = 4? 
■ 
The question was asked by Jaeger [1976b]. It was proved by Jaeger and Shank 
[1981], and with a short proof by Jaeger and Koester [ 1990], that if S can be partitioned 
into four classes of pairwise disjoint cycles, then x'(G) ^ 4. Jaeger and Shank [1981] 
proved that the corresponding statement with five classes implies the four-color 
theorem. 
■ 
12.18. 
SEYMOUR'S PLANAR 4-MULTIGRAPH CONJECTURE 
Let G be a planar 4-multigraph; that is, G is 4-regular, and for every 
X C V(G) with \X\ odd, the number of edges between X and V(G) - X 
is at least 4 (in particular \V(G)\ is even). Is x'(G) < 4 ? 
■ 
This problem is due to Seymour [1979a], who noted that an affirmative answer 
implies the four-color theorem by a result of Kotzig [1957]. Also, an affirmative 
answer implies an affirmative answer to the problem of Jaeger [1976b] on cycle-
decomposable 4-regular plane multigraphs (Problem 12.17). 
■ 
12.19. 
UNIQUELY 3-EDGE-COLORABLE PLANAR GRAPHS 
Does every uniquely 3-edge-colorable planar graph different from Kl3 
contain a triangle? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative can be found in Fiorini and Wilson 
[1978] and it originated from a paper on edge-colorings by Fiorini [1975], who 
omitted a detail when formulating the conjecture "a uniquely 3-colorable planar 
graph contains a 3-circuit." This has led to an alternative question that is seemingly 
weaker than the one stated above and also remains open: Is it true that every uniquely 
3-edge-colorable 3-regular planar graph contains a triangle? 
Restricting the discussion to 3-regular graphs, every uniquely 3-edge-colorable 
graph has exactly three Hamilton cycles; hence the conjecture above would follow 
from a conjecture by R. Cantoni (see Tutte [1976]), also posed by Greenwell and 
Kronk [1973], that every 3-regular planar graph with exactly three Hamilton cycles 
contains a triangle. Thomason [1982] found examples of 3-regular nonplanar graphs 
with exactly three Hamilton cycles, but with more than one 3-edge-coloring; it follows 

List-Edge-Chromatic Numbers 
201 
from these examples of certain generalized Petersen graphs that Cantoni's conjecture 
cannot be extended to nonplanar graphs. 
If the answer is affirmative, then all uniquely 3-edge-colorable 3-regular planar 
graphs can be obtained from K4 by repeatedly replacing vertices by triangles. The 
word "planar" cannot be removed as shown by the generalized Petersen graph P (9,2). 
This was first observed by Tutte [ 1976]. It seems unknown if there are other nonplanar 
counterexamples (see Fiorini and Wilson [1978]). Zhang [1993] has conjectured 
that the planarity condition may be weakened, and that the answer to the following 
question is affirmative: Does every uniquely 3-edge-colorable 3-regular graph without 
any subdivision of the Petersen graph as a subgraph contain a triangle? 
■ 
12.20. 
LIST-EDGE-CHROMATIC NUMBERS 
Let each edge xy of G be assigned a list A(xy) of λ permissible colors. 
A Λ-coloring is an edge-coloring in which each edge is assigned a color 
from its list. The list-edge-chromatic number x't(G) is the minimum num-
ber λ for which such a coloring always exists no matter what the lists 
look like (but they are all of size λ). It is clear that x'e(G) ^ 
x'(G). 
Is X^G) = χΧΟΊ 
* 
This conjecture first appeared in print in a paper by Bollobäs and Harris [ 1985]. 
Chetwynd and Häggkvist [1989] mentioned that the problem may have been studied 
earlier by R.P. Gupta and referred to implicitly by Erdös [1979]. The conjecture has 
also been attributed to M.O. Albertson and K.L. Collins, and it was independently 
formulated by V.G. Vizing as early as in 1975 (see the excellent survey of this and 
related problems by Häggkvist and Chetwynd [1992]). 
Hind [1988] proved x't(G) ^ (9/5) · A(G) for any multigraph G and x'e(G) < 
(5/3) · A(G) for any triangle-free multigraph G. The conjecture above and the bound 
X'(G) s (3/2) ■ A(G) by Shannon [1949] would imply that the constant 9/5 can be 
improved to 3/2. For simple graphs G with sufficiently large maximum degree Δ, 
Bollobäs and Hind [1989] proved that 
^(G)<(7/4)-A+i251ogAl. 
R. Häggkvist [personal communication in 1993] and J.C.M. Janssen were the first 
to obtain an upper bound behaving asymptotically as Δ + o(l) for a simple graph, 
namely 
* ; < Δ +c-A 2 / 3-logA 
where c > 0 is a constant. 
Kostochka [1992] proved that if all the cycles in G are sufficiently long relative 
to A(G), then x't{G) ^ A(G) + 1. If the conjecture above is true, the same bound 
would hold for any simple graph, since by the theorem of Vizing [1964] (Theorem 29 
in Chapter 1), a simple graph G satisfies x'{G) £ A(G) + 1. 

202 
Edge Colorings 
A famous special case of the conjecture is due to J. Dinitz (see Chetwynd 
and Häggkvist [1989]). Dinitz conjectured in 1978 that given any collection of sets 
Sjj (1 < /',y < n) all of size n, there exists a Latin square (fy : 1 s i,y < n), so 
that ijj £ Sjj for all i,j. In terms of list coloring, the Dinitz conjecture translates to 
Xe(Kn,n) - n. Janssen [ 1993] obtained partial results using the theorem of N. Alon and 
M. Tarsi (Theorem 34 in Chapter 1). Recently, F. Galvin proved the conjecture with 
a very short proof using similar ideas, but based on less powerful results [personal 
communications in 1994 from N. Alon and L. Goddyn]. In fact, J.A. Bondy [personal 
communication in 1994] has pointed out that the proof can be obtained by combining 
a theorem of M. Richardson dating back to 1953 (see Problem 13.9) with a result 
of Gale and Shapley [ 1962]. Galvin's proof of Dinitz' conjecture can be extended to 
show x'fiG) = x'(G) for every bipartite graph G.

12.21. 
STRONG CHROMATIC INDEX 
A strong &-edge coloring of a graph or multigraph G is an assignment of 
k colors to the edges of G in such a way that any two adjacent vertices in 
G are not incident to two distinct edges of the same color. Equivalently, 
the vertices incident to any color class induce a 1-regular subgraph of G. 
The strong chromatic index sx'(G) is the smallest number k for which G 
has a strong £-edge coloring. 
If the maximum degree of G is Δ, does 
«v'rtTk < 1 5 Δ 2 / 4 
i f Δ i s e v e n ' 
x ( ' ~ X5Δ2/4 
- Δ / 2 + 1 / 4 
if Δ is odd 
hold? 
If G is bipartite, is sx'(G) =£ Δ2? 
If G is 3-regular and planar, is sx'(G) s 9? 
■ 
The first question seems first considered at a conference in Prague in 1985 by 
P. Erdös and J. Neäetfil, who conjectured that the answer is affirmative (see Faudree, 
Gyärfäs, Schelp, and Tuza [1989]). The last two questions were asked by Faudree, 
Gyärfäs, Schelp, and Tuza [1990]. 
It is easy to find a strong edge coloring of G with at most 2Δ2 — 2Δ + 1 colors. 
This shows that the conjecture of Erdös and NeSetfil is true for Δ < 2. However, 
as remarked by Horäk, Qing, and Trotter [1993], it appears very hard to prove 
sx'(G) s (2 — β)Δ2 for some ε > 0. A result in support of the conjecture of Erdös 
and Nesetril was obtained by Chung, Gyärfäs, Trotter, and Tuza [1990], who proved 
that if G contains no induced 1 -regular subgraph with more than one edge, then G 
has at most 5Δ2/4 edges. 

Scheduling Without Waiting Periods 
203 
For 3-regular graphs, the best possible inequality sx'(G) s 10 was obtained 
independently by Andersen [1992] and by Horäk, Qing, and Trotter [1993]. Horäk 
[1990] proved sx'(G) < 23 for Δ = 4. The conjecture of Erdös and Nesetfil is 
unsolved for Δ s 4. 
For bipartite G the second question above remains open even if Δ = 3 . Faudree, 
Gyärfäs, Schelp, and Tuza [1990] also asked if sx'(G) s 7 if G is bipartite without 
a 4-cycle, and if sx'(G) s 5 if G is bipartite and without cycles of sufficiently large 
lengths. 
The inequality sx'(G) £ 9 for G 3-regular and planar would be best possible, 
since equality holds for the prism graph on six vertices.

12.22. VIZING'S INTERCHANGE PROBLEM 
Let φ be any given fc-edge coloring of a multigraph G, where G satisfies 
X'(G) ä A(G) + 2. An "interchange" with respect to colors a and ß, 
1 < a < ß S ί, consists in swapping the two colors on the edges of a 
connected component of the subgraph of G induced by all edges colored 
a or β, thus obtaining a new edge coloring of G using at most k colors. 
Is it possible to obtain an edge coloring of G with x'{G) colors from φ by 
a sequence of interchanges? 
■ 
The question was asked by Vizing [1965b, 1968]. 
If x'(G) 2: A(G) + 2 then, by the theorem of Vizing [1964] (Theorem 29 in 
Chapter 1), G has multiple edges. Vizing [1965b] proved that *'(G) £ A(G) + M(G), 
where /A(G) is the multiplicity of G (i.e., the maximum number of edges joining 
the same pair of vertices) and he noted that a (A(G) + /u,(G))-edge coloring and a 
3A(G)/2-edge coloring (corresponding to the bound proved by Shannon [1949]) can 
be obtained from an arbitrary edge coloring by interchanges. 
It is not clear to us if it is possible in general to obtain a ^'(G)-edge coloring from 
an arbitrary edge coloring of a graph or multigraph G by a sequence of interchanges. 
For vertex coloring this is not the case, as can be seen from a 4-coloring of the graph 
obtained from the complete tripartite graph #4,4,4 by removing the edges of four 
disjoint triangles. 
■ 
12.23. SCHEDULING WITHOUT WAITING PERIODS 
Call a coloring of the edges of a graph with colors 1,2,3,... a "consecutive 
coloring" if the colors received by the edges incident to each vertex are 
distinct and form an interval of integers. Let G be a bipartite graph with 
vertex partition (X, Y). If all vertices of X have the same degree dx and 
all vertices of Y have degree dy, does G allow a consecutive coloring? ■

Edge Colorings 
This question arose from a practical scheduling problem: At the Saint Canute 
High School in Odense, Denmark, parent consultations are arranged by letting each 
parent, or couple of parents, decide beforehand on a list of teachers that he/she/they 
would like to consult. Each meeting between parent(s) and a teacher lasts for the same 
fixed amount of time. The problem is to create a schedule without waiting periods 
for neither parents nor teachers. Letting X represent the set of teachers and Y the set 
of parents/couples of parents, and letting an edge xy represent a meeting of teacher* 
with parent(s) y, we obtain an instance of this coloring problem (without the degree 
constraints), where each color corresponds to an assigned time-slot. 
This particular variation of edge coloring for multigraphs in general seems first 
studied under the name of "interval coloring" by Asratyan and Kamalyan [ 1987] and 
by Sevast'yanov [1990]. 
Let us first consider the problem for bipartite graphs without degree constraints. 
Then it is not always possible to color the edges consecutively. The first example 
showing this seems due to Sevast'yanov [1990]. In the fall of 1991 we received 
examples found independently by P. Erdös and by A. Hertz and D. de Werra. To 
obtain Erdös' example take a finite projective plane P of order p and let X represent 
the set of points of P and Y the set of lines, with xy an edge if and only if the point 
A" belongs to the line y. Finally, join one new vertex z to all the vertices of Y. For 
p > 3 , this bipartite graph G cannot be consecutively colored. The vertices of the 
part X U {z} of the bipartition contains vertices of two different degrees p + 1 and 
p2 + p + 1, whereas the vertices in Y all have degree p + 2. For p = 3, G has 27 
vertices and Δ = 13. The example by Sevast'yanov has 28 vertices and Δ = 21. A 
smaller example, due to Hertz and de Werra, has 21 vertices and Δ = 14. We do not 
know any examples with Δ < 12. For Δ s 3 such examples do not exist, as proved 
by Hansen [1992]. 
If G is Δ-regular, then by the 1-factor theorem of D. König (Theorem 27 in 
Chapter 1) it is always possible to Δ-edge-color G, and of course such a coloring is 
also a consecutive coloring. 
For bipartite graphs where all vertices in X have degree dx and all vertices in 
Y have degree dy, Hansen [1992] noted that the answer to the question above is 
affirmative in the case dx = 2 and dy is any even number, and that this statement is 
in fact equivalent to the 2-factor theorem of Petersen [ 1891J: Every 2r -regular graph 
has a decomposition into 2-regular edge-disjoint subgraphs. The simplest unsolved 
case of the problem stated above is (dx,dy) = (3,4). The (2,5) case has recently 
been settled in the affirmative by D. Hanson, C. Loten, and B. Toft. The solution uses 
six colors and is based on a simple application of the theorem of Bäbler [1938] and 
Gallai [1950] that a bridge-less 5-regular graph has a 2-factor. This is in fact the key 
to a complete affirmative solution for the case (2, dy) with dy odd. 
Hansen [ 1992] proved that the complete bipartite graph Km,„ has a consecutive 
coloring using m + n — gcd(w, n) colors, and claimed that in general dx + dy — 
gcd(dx, dy) colors are necessary. However, he noted that this number of colors is not 
always sufficient. 
Asratyan and Kamalyan [1987] proved that for a given bipartite graph with 
bipartition (X, Y) and a given number k of colors, it is an W-complete problem

to decide if there exists a fc-coloring that is consecutive on X. Sevast'yanov [1990] 
proved that in general it is an W-complete problem to decide for a given bipartite 
graph if it has a consecutive coloring (allowing any number of colors).1 
For nonbipartite graphs, consecutive colorings were studied by Asratyan and 
Kamalyan [1987], We note that a ^-regular graph is consecutively colorable if and 
only if it can be fc-edge-colored.

Orientations and Flows 
■ 
13.1. TUTTE'S 5-FLOW CONJECTURE 
A fc-flow in an undirected graph G is an assignment to each edge of G of 
a direction and a value \,2,...,k— 
1 such that for each vertex x the sum 
of the values of edges directed into x is equal to the sum of the values 
of the edges directed out of x. Does every graph without bridges have a 
5-flow? 
■ 
This question is due to Tutte [1954]. Kilpatrick [1975], in a Ph.D. thesis, and 
Jaeger [1976a, 1979] proved independently that every graph without bridges has an 
8-flow. Seymour [1981a] proved that it has a 6-flow (Theorem 33 in Chapter 1). 
Steinberg [1984] proved Tutte's 5-flow conjecture for graphs embeddable on 
the projective plane. The similar result for orientable and nonorientable surfaces of 
Euler-characteristic at least - 2 was obtained independently by M. Möller, Fouquet 
[1985], Jensen [1985], and Möller, Carstens, and Brinkmann [1988]. 
Not every graph without bridges has a 4-flow. The unique smallest bridge-less 
graph without a 4-flow is the Petersen graph. Tutte [1966] conjectured that if G is 
without a bridge and has no 4-flow, then G has a subgraph contractible to the Petersen 
graph (see Problem 13.2). The corresponding weaker statement with 4 replaced by 5 
appears to be open. 
An "apex graph" is a graph G with a vertex v e V(G) so that G — v is planar. 
Tutte's 4-flow conjecture would imply that every bridge-less apex graph has a 4-flow. 
As pointed out by Seymour [1981b], this statement is equivalent to the following 
conjecture of H. Grötzsch: If G is a planar graph with A(G) s 3, then G can be 
3-edge-colored if and only if G has no subgraph all of whose vertices have degree 3 
except precisely one vertex of degree 2 (see Problem 12.16). This conjecture implies 
the four-color theorem by the theorem of P.G. Tait (Theorem 26 in Chapter 1). The 
reduction methods used in proving the 5-flow conjecture for graphs embedded on 
low-genus surfaces can be applied to showing that an apex graph without bridges has 
a 5-flow. 
£-flows and &-colorings are related by theorems of Tutte [1950]. Following 
Jensen [1985], we shall explain the close relation using results of Minty [1962,1967]

Orientations and Flows 
(see Theorem 31 in Chapter 1). In a directed graph G the "flow ratio" of a cycle (or an 
edge cut) is max{w/«, n/m}, where n is the number of edges pointing in one direction 
and m the number of edges pointing in the opposite direction. If the edges of the cycle 
(or the edge cut) all point in the same direction, then the flow ratio is infinite. A graph 
G has a vertex ^-coloring if and only if there exists an orientation G of G with flow 
ratio at most k - 1 for every cycle (Theorem 31 in Chapter 1). Similarly, a graph has 
a &-flow if and only if there exists an orientation G of G with flow ratio at most k — 1 
for every edge cut (Minty [ 1967]). From the well-known duality between cycles and 
edge cuts in graphs (see, e.g., Chapter 2 of Seshu and Reed [1961], Chapter 12 of 
Bondy and Murty [1976], or Chapter 3 of Bryant and Perfect [1980]) the duality 
between Λ-colorings and fc-flows follows. This relationship was implicit already in 
the work of Ghouila-Houri [ I960]. 
In particular, if G is planar and G* is its dual graph, then the following statements 
are equivalent: 
(a) G has a vertex A:-coloring, 
(b) G* has a A>flow, 
(c) G* has a face it-coloring. 
Thus Tutte's 5-flow conjecture suggests a far-reaching generalization of the five-color 
theorem of Heawood [1890]. 
Tutte [1978] gave a very interesting introduction to difficult graph coloring 
problems and /k-fiow problems. Younger [1983] and Jaeger [1988] each gave an 
original and well-written survey of &-flows.

13.2. TUTTE'S 4-FLOW CONJECTURE 
A 4-flow in an undirected graph G is an assignment to each edge of G of 
a direction and a value 1, 2, or 3 such that for each vertex x the sum of 
the values of edges directed into x is equal to the sum of the values of the 
edges directed out of x. Is it true that if G has no bridge and no subgraph 
contractible to the Petersen graph, then G has a 4-flow? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative is due to Tutte [1966]. The conjec-
ture implies that every planar graph without bridges has a 4-flow, and this is equivalent 
to the four-color theorem. 
Jaeger [1979] proved that every 4-edge-connected graph has a 4-flow. The proof 
relies on the interesting and useful fact that a graph has a λ-flow if and only if it has 
a (nowhere zero) A-flow for any Abelian group A with k elements; that is, the value 
assigned to each edge is an element of A\{0} (assuming A is additive). This can be 
proved by nonconstructive counting arguments using the principle of inclusion and 
exclusion, and it follows from the work of Tutte [1954]. (No constructive proof has 
been published so far as we know. However, the arguments given by Minty [1967] 
for the case k = 4 seem to provide a key to a constructive proof also in general.) 

TYitte's 4-Flow Conjecture 
211 
In particular, G has a 4-flow if and only if G has a (Z2 © Z2)-flow. This is, in fact, 
the same as an edge cover E(G) = E\ U E2 so that E\ and E2 are disjoint unions of 
edge sets of cycles in G. Jaeger proved that every 4-edge-connected graph has such 
an edge cover, and he also proved that every 2-edge-connected graph G has a similar 
edge cover E(G) = E{ U E2 U £3, hence a (Z2 © Z2 © Z2)-flow, hence an 8-flow. 
The 6-flow theorem of Seymour [1981a] (Theorem 33 in Chapter 1) was proved in 
the equivalent formulation that every 2-edge-connected graph has a (Z2 © Z3)-flow. 
It seems unknown whether the 4-flow conjecture is equivalent to its restriction to 
3-regular graphs, that is, the statement that every bridge-less 3-regular graph without 
a subgraph contractible to the Petersen graph has a 4-flow. Note that a 3-regular graph 
has a 4-flow if and only if it has a (Z2 © Z2)-flow, which again corresponds to a 
3-edge coloring (see also Problem 12.15). A conjecture of Jaeger and Swart [1980], 
that every 4-edge-chromatic 3-regular graph contains a cycle of length at most 6, 
was recently disproved by M. Kochol, who applied to the Petersen graph a general 
construction, due to M. Kochol and M. Skoviera, of new graphs without a &-flow 
(where ifcs4) from existing ones [personal communication from M. Skoviera in 
1994]. The smallest example by Kochol of such a graph without cycles of length 6 
or less has somewhere between 200 and 300 vertices. 
Weaker forms of Tutte's 4-flow conjecture still imply the four-color theorem: 
Conjecture 1. IfG has no bridge and no subgraph contractible to K5, then G has 
a 4-flow. 
Conjecture 2. IfG has no bridge and G — x is planar for some vertex x, then G 
has a 4-flow. 
Seymour [1981b] proved that Conjecture 2 is equivalent to a conjecture of 
H. Grötzsch (see Problem 12.16): 
Conjecture 3. IfG is planar with maximum degree at most three, then G is 3-edge-
colorable if and only ifG has no subgraph in which one vertex has degree two and 
all others have degree three. 
At the Graph Minors Workshop held in Seattle in 1991, C.-Q. Zhang suggested 
another weaker form of Tutte's 4-flow conjecture as follows. Assume that G has 
no bridge and no subgraph contractible to the Petersen graph. Alspach and Zhang 
[1993] proved for G 3-regular, and Alspach, Goddyn, and Zhang [1993] proved for G 
in general that G has a cycle double cover (i.e., a collection of cycles C\, C 2,..., Cm 
in G, possibly with repetitions, so that every edge of G is contained in exactly two 
cycles C, and C; where ι Φ j). Denote by £(G) tne smallest possible number of colors 
in a coloring of the cycles of a cycle double cover of G so that no two cycles sharing 
an edge are colored the same. Equivalently, the cycles must be colored so that each 
color class corresponds to a subgraph of G with all degrees even. Then Tutte's 4-flow 
conjecture is equivalent to £(G) s 3. Zhang asked if there is a constant number k so 
that £(G) £ kl Perhaps this can be proved at least for k - 8 or k = 6? 

212 
Orientations and Flows 
A conjecture was made by Szekeres [1973] and independently by Seymour 
[1979b] that every graph G without a bridge has a cycle double cover. A stronger 
version was formulated by Celmins [1984]: Let £(G) be defined as above, defining 
£(G) = oo if G has no cycle double cover. Is it true that £(G) ^ 5 if G has no bridge? 
Jaeger [1985] wrote an in-depth survey of the cycle double cover conjecture, with 
emphasis in particular on the relation to integer flows. Also, a more recent paper by 
Fan [1992] explored this relationship. 
■ 
13.3. TUTTE'S 3-FLOW CONJECTURE 
A 3-flow in an undirected graph G is an assignment to each edge of G of 
a direction and a value 1 or 2 such that for each vertex x the sum of the 
values of edges directed into x is equal to the sum of the values of the 
edges directed out of x. Is it true that if G has no bridge and no edge cut 
consisting of three edges, then G has a 3-fiow? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative was formulated by W.T. Tutte in 
1972 (see the interesting survey by Steinberg [1993a]). 
The existence of a Λ-flow is equivalent to the existence of a modulo fc-flow 
(i.e., a Λ-flow in which the values and sums of values are calculated modulo k) as 
proved by Tutte [1950] (see also Younger [1983]). By reversing the direction of the 
edges of value 2 in a 3-fiow, it follows that G has a 3-flow if and only if G has an 
orientation such that the in-degree minus the out-degree at each vertex is 0 modulo 
3. For example, a 3-regular graph has a 3-flow if and only if it is bipartite. 
An equivalent conjecture was presented in the section on unsolved problems in 
Bondy and Murty [1976]: Every 5-regular simple graph without bridges and edge 
cuts of size three allows an orientation so that each vertex has in-degree 1 or 4. That 
the 3-flow conjecture is implied by its restriction to 5-regular graphs seems first to 
have been observed by Tutte. 
A planar graph G has a 3-flow if and only if its dual graph G* has a ver-
tex 3-coloring (see Problem 13.1). Since the 3-color problem for planar graphs is 
W-complete, as proved by M.R. Garey, D.S. Johnson and L.J. Stockmeyer (see 
Theorem 19 in Chapter 1), no good necessary and sufficient condition for the 3-color 
problem or for the 3-flow problem can be expected. Tutte's 3-flow conjecture suggests 
a possible sufficient condition for 3-flows. 
For 2-flows there is, of course, a simple necessary and sufficient condition: G 
has a 2-flow if and only if all degrees in G are even. 
The relation described above between 3-flows and 3-colorings shows that Tutte's 
3-flow conjecture implies the theorem of H. Grötzsch (Theorem 10 in Chapter 1) that 
a planar graph G without triangles has a vertex 3-coloring. 
A partial result was obtained by Steinberg and Younger [1989], who proved 
that the 3-flow conjecture is true for graphs embeddable on the projective plane. 
C. Thomassen [personal communication in 1993] remarked that the 3-flow conjecture 
for graphs embedded on the torus would follow from results of Thomassen [1993c], 

Jaeger's Circular Flow Conjecture 
213 
if the conjecture can be proved for every graph G for which G — e is planar for some 
edge e G £(G). 
A weaker conjecture by Jaeger [1988], that there exists an integer k such that 
every graph without an edge cut consisting of fewer than k edges has a 3-flow, is 
also open. Tutte's conjecture suggests this for k = 4. Lai and Zhang [1992] proved 
that if k is an integer such that G has no edge cut of fewer than k edges, and if 
k > 41og2 \V(G)\, then G has a 3-flow. 
■ 
13.4. BOUCHET'S 6-FLOW CONJECTURE 
A bidirection of a graph G is an orientation of each end of every edge 
of G (giving four possibilities for every edge: ° 
» 
»-o, o— 
« 
o, 
o 
» < 
o and o-i 
>-o). A bidirected fc-fiow on G is a bidirection 
of G and an assignment of a value 1, 2 , . . . , k — 1 to each edge such that 
for each vertex x of G, the sum of the values of the edges whose ends 
at x are directed into x equals the sum of the values of the edges whose 
ends at x are directed out of x. Is it true that if G has a bidirected fc-flow 
for some value of k and some bidirection of G, then G has a bidirected 
6-flow with respect to the same bidirection? 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative is due to Bouchet [1983], who 
proved that this is so with 6 replaced by 63 = 216. Moreover, Bouchet [1983] ob-
served that the Petersen graph shows that the value 6 would be best possible. 
A. Zyka from Czechoslovakia proved in his Ph.D. thesis that the conjecture is 
true with 6 replaced by 30. This was also done by J.-L. Fouquet. Khelladi [1987] 
proved the conjecture with 6 replaced by 18 for 4-connected graphs. 
■ 
13.5. JAEGER'S CIRCULAR FLOW CONJECTURE 
An orientation of a graph is called a mod (2p + l)-orientation (p > 1), 
if the out-degree of every vertex is congruent, modulo 2p + 1, to its in-
degree. Is it true for all p 2: 1, that every 4p-edge-connected graph has a 
mod(2p + l)-orientation? 
■ 
Jaeger [1981] conjectured that the answer is affirmative and proved that G has 
a mod (2p + l)-orientation if and only if G has a circular (2p + l)-flow, defined as 
follows. For i ^ 2 a circular λ-flow in G consists of an orientation of G together 
with an assignment to each edge of G of a ^-vector cy for some / and j satisfying 
1 < i,j s k and |i - j \ €Ξ {\,k - 1}, where the /th coordinate of c,y is 1, the y'th 
coordinate is — 1, and all other coordinates are 0. Furthermore, for each vertex x of 
G, the (vector) sum of the values on the edges directed into x is equal to the sum of 
the values on the edges directed away from x. 

214 
Orientations and Flows 
Jaeger [1981] pointed out that the circular flow conjecture for p = 1 is equivalent 
to the 3-flow conjecture of W.T. Tutte (Problem 13.3), and that the conjecture for 
p — 2 implies the 5-flow conjecture of Tutte [1954] (Problem 13.1). 
■ 
13.6. 
BERGE'S STRONG PATH PARTITION CONJECTURE 
Let G be a directed graph and k an integer, where 1 < £ < max \V(P)\ 
(maximum taken over all directed paths P in G). A set V of disjoint di-
rected paths P\,P2 
Pt in G that covers all vertices of G is called 
a path partition of G. Such a V with a minimum value of Bk(P) = 
X|=1 mm{k, \V(P)\} is called jfc-optimal. 
Is it true that for every ^-optimal path partition V of G there exists a 
^-coloring of an induced subgraph of G such that the number of different 
colors on Pf is min{fc, I V(P,)|} for every P, in ΤΊ 
■ 
The conjecture that the answer is affirmative is due to C. Berge and is called 
the "strong path partition conjecture" (see Sridharan [1993a, 1993b]). Berge posed 
the conjecture in an attempt to unify the theorem of Gallai and Milgram [1960] 
and the theorem of B. Roy and T. Gallai (Theorem 32 in Chapter 1). 
For k = 1 the conjecture has been proved by Linial [1978], generalizing the 
theorem of Gallai and Milgram [ 1960] that every directed graph G has a path partition 
with at most a paths, where a is the maximum number of independent vertices in G. 
For k = max |V(P)\ the conjecture has been proved by Berge [1983], generaliz-
ing the theorem of Roy and Gallai. 
The conjecture implies the weaker conjecture that every directed graph G has 
a path partition V with Bk(V) of value at most the maximum number of vertices in 
an induced ^-colorable subgraph of G. This weaker statement, due to Linial [1981], 
has been named the "weak path partition conjecture" by C. Berge (see Sridharan 
[1993a, 1993b]). Sridharan [1993a, 1993b] proved the strong path partition conjecture 
for some special classes of graphs. 
■ 
13.7. 
BERGE'S DIRECTED PATH-CONJECTURE 
If G is a 4-chromatic graph and G is any orientation of G, does there 
exist a directed path P in G and a 4-coloring of G with each color class 
containing exactly one vertex from ΡΊ 
■ 
Berge [1980] conjectured that if G is any orientation of a graph G of chromatic 
number k s 3, then there exists a directed path P in G and a ^-coloring of G such that 
each color class intersects P in exactly one vertex. The conjecture would strengthen 

Minimal Orientations of Critical Graphs 
215 
the theorem of B. Roy and T. Gallai (Theorem 32 in Chapter 1), which states that 
every orientation of G contains a directed path with k vertices. 
For k = 3 the conjecture is true, but for k s 5 it was disproved by Meyniel 
[1989]. Thus only the case k = 4 remains unsolved. The conjecture of Berge [1980] 
might still be true for all ^-critical graphs with t ä 4 . 
Gallai [1968] formulated a conjecture relating in a different way to the theorem 
of B. Roy and T. Gallai. He conjectured that given any ^-critical graph G there exists 
an orientation of G with a unique directed path on k vertices. This conjecture was 
disproved by Youngs [1993] (see Problem 13.8). 
■ 
13.8. MINIMAL ORIENTATIONS OF CRITICAL GRAPHS 
Let G be a /c-critical graph. When does there exist a minimal orientation 
G of G, defined as an orientation G having exactly one directed path of 
length k — 1? What is the largest possible value f{k) such that every it-
critical graph of maximum degree at most f(k) has a minimal orientation? 
It is known that/(4) s 4 and/(5) 2: 5. Does equality hold in either case? 
Does a minimal orientation always exist when G is without a triangle? 
■ 
The first question was asked by Gallai [1968], who proved that every orientation 
of a ^-chromatic graph has at least one directed path of length k — 1 (Theorem 32 in 
Chapter 1). This result was obtained independently by B. Roy. 
The proof given by Gallai [1968] shows that if there exists an orientation with 
exactly one directed path of length k — 1, then there exists an acyclic such orientation 
G. Assigning to each vertex x of G the length, <P(JC), of a longest directed path in G 
ending in x, one obtains a /t-coloring φ of G with exactly one path in G of length k - 1 
having its vertices colored 1,2,... ,k in this order. Conversely, every such coloring 
φ gives an acyclic orientation of G with exactly one directed path of length k — 1 by 
directing the edge (i,j) from i to j when φ(ί) < φ(]). Thus Gallai's question can be 
rephrased in terms of colorings instead of orientations. 
A breakthrough for Gallai's question was achieved by Youngs [1993], who gave 
the first examples of critical graphs without minimal orientations. The basic example 
of Youngs is 4-critical with 14 vertices and of maximum degree 5. Thus /(4) < 4. 
By joining G completely to a complete graph K^-4, where k s 5, a ^-critical graph 
without a minimal orientation and of maximum degree k + 9 is obtained. Thus 
f(k) ^ k + 8 for all k s 5. By joining G completely to a triangle-free (k - 4)-critical 
graph, where t ä 6 , one obtains a ^-critical graph without minimal orientations (as 
will be explained below) and without complete subgraphs of size 6. 
D. Hanson and B. Toft have noted that Youngs' 4-critical graph without a minimal 
orientation is the first member of a sequence consisting of ^-critical graphs for all 
k > 4. Each graph has a 7-cycle C with vertices X\,X2,- -.,χη in cyclic order, and 
for k s 4 it consists in addition of seven mutually disjoint copies G\, G^,. ■ ■, G7 of 
the complete (k — 3)-graph, each of which is disjoint from C, with G, completely 
joined to the vertices JC,·, x,+1, and x,+3 (indices modulo 7) for i = 1,2,..., 7. Hanson 

216 
Orientations and Flows 
and Toft could show that also the second member of this sequence, with k = 5, on 
21 vertices and of maximum degree 8, has no minimal orientation. This implies a 
bound of/(5) ^ 7. It is not clear if every graph in the sequence is without a minimal 
orientation, which would imply improved upper bounds on f(k) for some small values 
of*. 
Youngs [1993] proved for k > 5 that every k-critical graph of maximum degree 
k has a minimal orientation. Hence f(k) ^ k for k s 5. It is not known if/(5) = 5. 
Only few jfc-critical graphs of maximum degree k are known for A: > 5, and it has 
been conjectured that they do not exist at all for k & 9 (see Problem 4.8). It is open 
if every 4-critical graph of maximum degree 4 has a minimal orientation. 
If disjoint graphs G\ and G2 are k\ -critical and jt2-critical, respectively, and if G 
is the complete join of Gj and G2, obtained by joining all vertices of G\ to all vertices 
of G2 by edges, then G is (kx + £2)-critical. Gallai [1968] noted that if both G\ and G2 
have minimal orientations, then G has a minimal orientation. D. Hanson and B. Toft 
noted that the converse is also true. This follows from the observation, due to Las 
Vergnas [1973] and easily proved by induction, that the complete join of two directed 
paths that start from vertices x and y, with an arbitrary direction assigned to each 
edge joining the paths, always contains a directed Hamilton path (a path containing 
all vertices of the two paths) starting in x or in y. Taking the complete join of p copies 
of Youngs' basic 4-critical example without a minimal orientation, one thus obtains 
a 4/?-critical graph on 14/? vertices in which every orientation has at least 2P directed 
paths of length Ap — 1. Thus the minimum number of directed paths of length k — 1 
in a λ-critical graph can grow exponentially with k and with the number of vertices 
in the graph. 
Bondy [1976] proved the following stronger version of the theorem of Roy and 
Gallai: If H is any strongly connected orientation of a ^-chromatic multigraph H (i.e., 
for every pair of vertices A' and y there is a directed path from x to y in //), where 
k > 2, then H contains a directed cycle of length at least k. This was conjectured by 
M. Las Vergnas (see the collection of open problems in Bondy and Murty [1976]). 
The theorem of Roy and Gallai can be proved from this statement by joining a new 
vertex to each vertex of the given graph by two edges, one in each direction. For the 
theorem of Bondy, similar questions to those given above may be raised, replacing 
"orientation" by "strongly connected orientation" and "directed path of length k — \" 
by "directed cycle of length at least k." But we are not aware of any work done in 
this direction. 
■ 
13.9. ALON-TARSI ORIENTATIONS 
AND CHROMATIC NUMBER 
Let G be an orientation of a graph G. An Eulerian subgraph of G is a 
directed subgraph H such that the in-degree of every vertex in H is equal 
to its out-degree in H. A subgraph H is called "even" or "odd" according 
to the parity of \E(H)\. Define AT(G) to be the smallest number k so that 
there exists an orientation G with the number of even spanning Eulerian 

Alon-Tarsi Orientations and Chromatic Number 
217 
subgraphs different from the number of odd spanning Eulerian subgraphs, 
and so that every vertex of G has out-degree at most k - 1 in G. 
Does there exist a polynomial algorithm to evaluate AT(G) for any given 
graph G? Does there exist a polynomial algorithm to color a graph G with 
at most AT(G) colors (or with lists of colors of size at most AT(G) at the 
vertices)? 
■ 
Alon and Tarsi [1992] used algebraic methods to prove that 
X(G) < Xe(G) < AT(G) 
(Theorem 34 in Chapter 1) and remarked that it would be interesting to find a 
nonalgebraic proof of the inequality x(G) ^ AT(G). They noted that a polynomial 
algorithm exists when restricting to acyclic orientations G—in such an orientation 
there is exactly one even spanning Eulerian subgraph, namely the edge-less graph, 
and no odd spanning Eulerian subgraph. The acyclic orientations of G provide the 
upper bound 
AT(G) < col(G), 
where col(G) denotes the coloring number of G (i.e., the largest number k such that 
there exists a subgraph of G with minimum degree k - 1). It is easy to determine 
the number col(G) and to find a coloring of the vertices of G with col(G) colors (see 
Theorem 12 and the discussion of it in Chapter 1). 
Another upper bound for xe(G), call it R(G), is obtained by considering only ori-
entations G without odd directed cycles. Again, such a G has no odd spanning Eulerian 
subgraph. Hence xt(G) < AT(G) < R(G) < col(G). The inequality xe(G) < R(G) 
can also be proved by a direct argument. As noted by Alon and Tarsi, it is not difficult 
to decide if G has an odd directed cycle, by looking at odd powers of the adjacency 
matrix of G, or by checking if G has a subgraph corresponding to a strongly con-
nected component of G and containing an odd cycle (see Theorem 6.14 of Harary, 
Norman, and Cartwright [1965]). A theorem of Richardson [1953] implies that if G 
has no odd directed cycle, then G has a "kernel," that is, an independent set S of 
vertices so that every vertex in G not belonging to 5 has at least one out-neighbor 
in S. J.A. Bondy, R. Boppana, and A. Siegel noted (see Alon and Tarsi [1992]) that 
Richardson's theorem can be used directly to color G from lists of size Δ + (G) + 1 
in polynomial time, where Δ + (G) denotes the maximum out-degree of the vertices 
in G (apply Richardson's theorem to the induced subgraph on the set of vertices 
containing color 1 in their lists, and color the vertices belonging to its kernel with 
color 1; continue with the next color, etc.). However, it does not seem clear how to 
determine the number R(G) polynomially. 
Two important theorems on list coloring were obtained by determining the 
value of R(G) for G belonging to a given class of graphs. Alon and Tarsi [1992] 
proved that every bipartite planar graph is 3-choosable (see also Problem 2.13), and 
F. Galvin proved the list-coloring conjecture (see Section 1.9) for all bipartite graphs, 
in particular settling a famous conjecture of J. Dinitz (see also Problem 12.20).

14.1. COEFFICIENTS OF CHROMATIC POLYNOMIALS 
LetP(G,k) 
= ic" +alk"~l 
+ a2k"~2 + ■■■ + a„-xk + an be the chromatic 
polynomial of G. That is, P(G, k) is the number of different 
k-colorings 
of G with colors 1,2 
k. Is it true that the absolute values of the 
coefficients form a unimodal sequence, that is, 
1 < M < |<z2| < · · · < |fl,_,| < \a,\ > k + , | > · · · > |a„_,| 
a |a„| - 0 
for some / with 1 < /' < «? 
■ 
Attention to this problem was drawn by Read [1968]. As an equivalent refor-
mulation one may ask: Is the statement "|α,| > |α,-+ι | and |α,+ ι | < \ai+z\" false for 
all il 
Hoggar [ 1974] conjectured more strongly that the inequality α,α,+2 < aj+, holds 
for all / with 1 s i < n - 2. A sequence of numbers satisfying this inequality is 
said to have the strong logarithmic concavity property, implying that it is unimodal 
in absolute value. Hoggar observed that the class of polynomials with coefficients 
satisfying strong logarithmic concavity is closed under multiplication, and that this is 
not the case for the class of polynomials with coefficients that are unimodal in absolute 
value. From the definition of chromatic polynomials it is clear that P(G, k) ■ P(H, k) 
is the chromatic polynomial of the disjoint union of the graphs G and H; hence the 
class of chromatic polynomials is closed under multiplication. Read and Tutte [1988] 
remarked that this makes the question by Hoggar [1974] seem the more natural of 
the two. 
The strong logarithmic concavity, and hence the unimodality property, has been 
verified for the chromatic polynomials of all graphs on less than 10 vertices, as 
reported by Read and Tutte [1988]. 
For accounts of related properties of the coefficients of chromatic polynomials 
see Meredith [1972], Wilf [1976], Farrell [1980], Brenti [1992], and the classical 
paper by Whitney [1932b].

14.2. CHARACTERIZATION OF CHROMATIC 
POLYNOMIALS 
Is it possible to find a set of necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions 
for a polynomial to be the chromatic polynomial of some graph? 
■ 
The question was asked by Read [1968], who proved that the chromatic polyno-
mial P(G, k) of a graph G on n vertices satisfies the following necessary conditions: 
(i) The degree of P(G, k) is n, 
(ii) the coefficient of k" is 1, 
(iii) the coefficient of kn'1 is -|E(G)|, 
(iv) the constant term is 0, 
(v) the terms alternate in sign, and 
(vi) P(G, λ) < λ(λ - l)""1 for any positive integer λ, if G is connected. 
However, Read [1968] also noted that these conditions are not sufficient for charac-
terizing chromatic polynomials among all polynomials. 
Read and Tutte [1988] remarked that for any given polynomial, at least it is 
possible by (i) and (iii) above to determine the number of vertices and edges a graph 
must have, if it exists, in order to have the given chromatic polynomial. What remains 
would be to generate all such graphs and calculate their chromatic polynomials, 
which is finite process, but certainly very impractical. 
Some additional necessary conditions are obtained by studying the zeros of 
P(G, k). It follows from (ii), (iv), and (v) that k = 0 is a zero, that P(G, λ) is nonzero 
for any real number λ < 0, and that all rational zeros must be integers. Since P{G, k) 
is the number of fc-colorings of G, it follows that P(G, k) has no rational zeros other 
than 0,1,2,..., x(G) - 2, x(G) - 1. It can be proved (see Tutte [1974a]) that P(G,\) 
is nonzero for all real numbers 0 < λ < 1 (for further results along these lines, see 
Problem 14.5). 
Lehmer [1985] gave a complete list of all chromatic polynomials of graphs on 
at most 6 vertices, and a random sample of chromatic polynomials of graphs on 10 
vertices. 
■ 
14.3. CHROMATIC UNIQUENESS 
Let P(G, k) denote the chromatic polynomial of G. G is called chromati-
cally unique if P(G, k) = P(H, k) implies that// is isomorphic to G. What 
is a necessary and sufficient condition for G to be chromatically unique? ■ 
This question was asked by Chao and Whitehead [1978]. It is a natural variation 
of the question about chromatic equivalence (Problem 14.4) posed by Read [1968]: 
What is a necessary and sufficient condition for two graphs to have the same chromatic 
polynomial? 

222 
Chromatic Polynomials 
Chao and Whitehead [1978] proved that all cycles with at least 3 vertices and 
all 0-graphs with at least 4 vertices are chromatically unique. A 0-graph is the union 
of two cycles with one edge in common. Loerinc [1978] proved that generalized 
θ-graphs are chromatically unique; these are formed by joining two vertices by three 
paths that are pairwise disjoint except for their endpoints. It is clear that complete 
graphs and edge-less graphs are chromatically unique. 
Chao and Whitehead [1978, 1979] asked for the values of n a 4 for which the 
wheel W„, consisting of one vertex joined completely to the vertices of a cycle of 
length n — 1, is chromatically unique, and they showed that W„ is chromatically 
unique for n = 4, 5, but not for n = 6. Xu and Li [1984] proved that every W„ 
with n odd is chromatically unique, and that W% is not. Li and Whitehead [1992] 
showed that Wl0 is chromatically unique. The results for Wg and WK were obtained 
independently by R.C. Read (see Read and Tutte [1988]). For Wn with n even and 
« > 12 the question of chromatic uniqueness is open. Tutte [1970a] gave a general 
formula for P(W„, k) for n > 4. 
G is called an //-homeomorph, if G can be obtained from H by a series of subdi-
visions of edges. Whitehead and Zhao [1984a] gave explicit lists of infinite families 
of chromatically unique /^-homeomorphs. They also described infinite families of 
pairs of chromatically equivalent A^-homeomorphs; additional such families were 
recently found by Whitehead [1993]. Weiming [1987] proved that almost all K^-
homeomorphs are chromatically unique. The proof is based on a lemma by Chao 
and Zhao [1983], stating that if G is a Af4-homeomorph and G' is a graph such that 
P(G', k) = P(G, k), then G' is also a A^-homeomorph. There is no known character-
ization of the chromatically unique ÄVhomeomorphs. 
Chao and Novacky [1982] considered the graphs T(n,k), for n S: k a 2, intro-
duced by Turän [ 1941,1954], and proved that any such graph is chromatically unique. 
T(n, k) has n vertices in k parts of sizes that differ by at most 1, each part consisting 
of an independent set, and all pairs of vertices from different parts being adjacent. Xu 
[1991] showed that every complete bipartite graph Km,„ with m ^ n ^ 2 i s chromat-
ically unique, as conjectured by Salzberg, Lopez, and Giudici [1986]. It seems open 
if complete ^-partite graphs for k s 3 in general are chromatically unique. 
Chia [1986] showed that every connected chromatically unique graph G has 
at most two blocks. If G has exactly two blocks, each block is vertex-transitive and 
chromatically unique. Moreover, if H is a vertex-transitive 2-connected chromatically 
unique graph, then every connected graph with blocks H and K2 is chromatically 
unique. The latter result was conjectured by Whitehead and Zhao [1984b]. Read 
[1987] called a graph "weakly chromatically unique" if it is chromatically unique, 
but the graph obtained by adding a new isolated vertex is not. He then proved a 
stronger form of the conjecture of Whitehead and Zhao [1984b] by showing that G 
is weakly chromatically unique if and only if G consists of two blocks H and K2, 
where H is a chromatically unique vertex-transitive graph. More results related to 
connectivity can be found in Read [1987]. Chia [1986] conjectured that all connected 
vertex-transitive graphs are chromatically unique. This conjecture was disproved by 
Liu and Li [1991]. 
Some additional results and open problems can be found in the survey by Bari 
and Kahn [1989] and in the excellent expository paper by Koh and Teo [1990]. 

Chromatic Equivalence 
223 
The known results on chromatic uniqueness "were obtained by painstaking 
detective work—by carefully wringing from a chromatic polynomial every drop of 
information about the graph, until it could be shown that there was only the one 
possibility'.' (Read and Tutte [ 1988]). Results concerning relations between chromatic 
polynomial and graph structure can be found in Eisenberg [1970], Meredith [1972], 
Farrell [1980], Whitehead and Zhao [1984b], and Whitehead [1989]. From this point 
of view, the problem is closely related to the problem of characterizing chromatic 
polynomials (Problem 14.2): Is there a practical method to determine for a given 
polynomial if it is the chromatic polynomial of some graph? 
■ 
14.4. CHROMATIC EQUIVALENCE 
What is a necessary and sufficient condition for two graphs to have the 
same chromatic polynomial? 
■ 
This question was asked by Read [1968], who noted, for example, that all trees 
with the same number of vertices are chromatically equivalent, and observed that 
more nontrivial examples exist as well. 
Some variations of the question were stated in Read and Tutte [1988]: Given two 
graphs, is there a way of recognizing that they are chromatically equivalent without 
actually working out the chromatic polynomial for either of them? And, if given one 
graph, is there a way of constructing different graphs that have the same chromatic 
polynomial? 
If G is the union of two smaller graphs G\ and Gi that intersect in a complete 
graph Kr = G, f]G2, then (see, e.g., Read [1968]) 
P(G.k)= 
nG^-PiG.k) 
k{k- 
l)(ik-2)---(fc-r + 1) 
In general, it is possible to form nonisomorphic graphs starting from the same G\, G2, 
and r, hence such graphs are chromatically equivalent. For example, all connected 
graphs with the same collection of blocks are chromatically equivalent, one particular 
case being all trees of the same size. More general examples arise from the class of 
triangulated graphs (also called chordal graphs or rigid circuit graphs) introduced by 
Hajnal and Suränyi [1958] and characterized by Dirac [1961], denned as the class 
of graphs for which every cycle of length at least 4 has a diagonal (i.e., an edge 
joining two nonconsecutive vertices of the cycle). Dirac showed that triangulated 
graphs are precisely the graphs that can be built up, starting from a single vertex, by 
successively introducing one new vertex and joining it to the vertices of a complete 
subgraph in the existing graph. Knowing the sizes of the complete subgraphs used 
in the construction of a triangulated graph G is sufficient to determine P(G,k) by the 
formula given above: Let m, (0 £ r < ω) be the number of complete r -graphs used 
to construct G. Then 
P(G,k) = kmo(k - l)""(k - 2)"'2 ■■■(k- <a)m". 

224 
Chromatic Polynomials 
Many different triangulated graphs have the same sequence mo,mum2 
ma; thus 
they are all chromatically equivalent to G. Dmitriev [1980] gave infinitely many 
examples showing that a graph that is not triangulated can be chromatically equivalent 
to a triangulated graph. The smallest example found by Dmitriev is obtained from 
the complete graph K6 by subdividing an edge by one new vertex (this particular 
example was also found earlier and independently by Read [1975]). A nontrivial 
result obtained by Dmitriev [ 1982] states that if H has chromatic polynomial 
P(H,k) = k{k - l)(k - 2) ■ ■ ■ (k - ω + l)(k - m)m", 
then H is in fact a triangulated graph. Borodin and Dmitriev [ 1991 ] proved the similar 
result that if 
P(H,k) = k(k - \)(k - 2) ■ ■ ■ (k - ω + 1)(* - u>)m">(k - j), 
where 0 =£ j < ω, then H must also be triangulated. Since the triangulated graphs have 
chromatic polynomials of a particularly simple form, it seems an interesting problem 
to characterize graphs that are chromatically equivalent to triangulated graphs. A 
somewhat similar problem was solved by Wakelin and Woodall [1992J. 
For graphs on n vertices, η ϊ 3 , any G and H must be chromatically equivalent 
if they have identical collections of isomorphism types for their n vertex-deleted 
subgraphs. This was proved by Tutte [1967, 1979]. The reconstruction conjecture 
suggests that G and H are in fact isomorphic (see Bondy and Hemminger [1977]). 
Tutte's result can also be expressed by saying that the chromatic polynomial is "re-
constructible". The chromatic number is thus reconstructible, but it seems unknown 
if the edge-chromatic number is. 
Akiyama and Harary [1981] asked whether there exists a graph G that is not 
isomorphic to its own complement G, but is chromatically equivalent to G. This 
question was answered affirmatively by Koh and Teo [1991]. 
A certain operation of "rotor flipping" was introduced by Brooks, Smith, Stone, 
and Tutte [1940], and studied also by Tutte [1974b, 1980] and Lee [1975]. A rotor 
R of a graph G is a subgraph with a rotational symmetry Θ such that the vertices 
of attachment for R (i.e., the vertices of G incident both to elements of £(/?) and to 
elements of E(G) - E(R)) form an orbit under the action of Θ. The rotor/? is "flipped" 
by replacing R in G by its reflection. Read and Tutte [1988] remarked that it is not 
known if rotor flipping can change the chromatic polynomial of a planar graph. Foldes 
[ 1978] proved that rotor flipping may change the chromatic polynomial of a nonplanar 
graph. It has been pointed out by J.H. Przytycki [personal communication in 1994] 
that results obtained by Jones [ 1992] on invariants in knot theory can be translated into 
partial results on the effects of rotor flipping on the chromatic polynomial of a planar 
graph, thus providing certain sufficient conditions that the chromatic polynomial will 
remain unchanged following the operation. The connections with knot theory were 
first described by Anstee, Przytycki, and Rolfsen [1989] and developed further by 
Traczyk [1989]. 

Zeros of Chromatic Polynomials 
225 
■ 
14.5. ZEROS OF CHROMATIC POLYNOMIALS 
What numbers can be zeros of the chromatic polynomial of a graph G? 
What is the answer if G is restricted to be planar? What if G is restricted 
to be a plane triangulation? 
■ 
Read [1968] asked this question for graphs G in general. It follows from basic 
results (see Problem 14.2) that P(G, λ) = 0 for λ = 0,1,2,..., \(G) - 2, X(G) - 1, 
and that these are the only rational solutions, but in general not all the solutions. 
Moreover, from the observation that the coefficients of P(G,k) alternate in sign 
follows that P(G, λ) Φ 0 for all λ < 0. Tutte [1974a] showed that P(G, λ) Φ 0 for 
0 < λ < 1, which has been extended to a slightly more general result by Woodall 
[1992a]. 
Woodall [1977] proved that if m,n > 2 have different parities, then P(Km„,\) 
= 
0 has a solution in the interval 1 < λ < 2, where Km,„ denotes the complete bipartite 
graph with parts of size m and n. Woodall [1977] also proved that for fixed m s 2, 
and any integer i with 2< i < m/2, P(Kmn, λ) = 0 has real solutions λ arbitrarily 
close to i, for n chosen large enough. 
Jackson [1993] proved that P(G,k) never has a zero in the interval 1 < λ s 
32/27, and that the value 32/27 is best possible. It seems unknown if there exists 
any zero-free interval of the form λ] < λ < λ2, where 32/27 < λ( < λ2. Jackson 
[1993] conjectured that if G is 3-connected and not bipartite, then P(G, λ) Φ 0 for 
all λ in the interval 1 < λ < 2. This is true if G is a plane triangulation (Birkhoff 
and Lewis [1946]), and it has been verified by computer search for general graphs G 
on at most nine vertices by G.F. Royle, as reported by Jackson [1993]. 
The statement "P(G,4) > 0 for every planar graph G" is equivalent to the four-
color theorem, and remains equivalent when G is restricted to the class of plane 
triangulations. In an attempt to settle the four-color problem, Birkhoff and Lewis 
[1946] studied the zeros of chromatic polynomials of plane triangulations. They 
proved that P{G, λ) > 0 holds for every plane triangulation G and all λ ~5L 5, and 
formulated a conjecture that would imply the truth of the corresponding statement 
with 5 replaced by 4, and moreover with P(G, λ) replaced by any derivative PU\G, λ) 
for 1 < / < |V(G)|. The conjecture of Birkhoff and Lewis [1946] has remained 
unsolved. It is not even known if there exists a planar graph G with P(G, λ) = 0 
for any λ in the interval 4 < λ < 5. Possible extensions and generalizations of the 
Birkhoff-Lewis conjecture have been considered by S. Beraha, Queens College, City 
University of New York [personal communication in 1994], 
Woodall [1992b] proved that the unique real zero (= 2.547...) of the polynomial 
f 3 _ g(2 + 29f — 32 is the smallest noninteger real zero of the chromatic polynomial 
of any plane triangulation. This polynomial divides the chromatic polynomial of the 
octahedron graph. Woodall [ 1977] had conjectured this result, and he also conjectured 
that if G is a plane triangulation, then P(G, λ) Φ 0 in the interval 2.678... < λ < 3. 
The latter conjecture has been disproved by Woodall, who instead conjectured that 
there are no zero-free intervals between 2.547 ... and 3 [personal communication 
from B. Jackson in 1994].

14.6. BERAHA CONJECTURE 
Let n b e a positive integer and define B„ — 2 + 2 cos(2ir/n). Is it true 
for every ε > 0 that there exists a plane triangulation G such that the 
chromatic polynomial P{G, k) of G has a zero λ in the interval Bn — ε < 
λ < Bn + e? 
■ 
The question was asked by Beraha [ 1975J in his Ph.D. thesis, and it was men-
tioned by Tutte [1974a]. 
The numberB„ = 2 + 2cos(2rr/n) is occasionally referred to as the nth Beraha 
number. The first few such numbers are 4,0,1,2, τ 2^,..., where τ = (1 + yß)/2 
(the "golden ratio"). This sequence satisfies Ηην-,οοΑ,, = 4; hence the truth of the 
conjecture implies the existence of plane triangulations having chromatic polynomi-
als with zeros arbitrarily close to 4. Beraha and Kahane [1979] showed that such 
triangulations indeed exist, and they pointed out the connection with the four-color 
problem. The four-color theorem is equivalent to the statement that the chromatic 
polynomial of any planar graph has no zero equal to 4. 
It is clear that the conjecture is true for B2 = 0, Bj, = 1, Β4 = 2, and B& = 3, by 
the existence of 4-chromatic planar graphs. Beraha, Kahane, and Reid [1973] proved 
that the conjecture holds for By and ßio- For S5 = τ2, Tutte [1970a] proved that the 
chromatic polynomial of a plane triangulation G is small at τ2: 
On the other hand, Tutte [1970b] also proved that P(G, τ2) is nonzero for every plane 
triangulation G. Hence to prove the conjecture for Β$, one has to prove the existence 
of an infinite family of plane triangulations with zeros tending to τ2. This was done 
by Beraha, Kahane, and Weiss [1980]. The conjecture appears to be open for n = 8, 
9 and n > 11.

14.7. CHESSBOARD PROBLEM 
Find a general formula for the chromatic polynomial P(Xm,„,\) of the 
graph Xmjl associated with anmXn "chessboard"—the graph with ver-
tices at the integer lattice points (x, y) with 1 < Λ: < «, 1 < >> < m, and 
in which each vertex is joined to the four or fewer vertices at distance 1 
from it. 
■ 
The problem was stated in the survey article by Read and Tutte [1988], adding 
that: "This is an easy question to ask, but without doubt a fiendishly difficult one to 
answer" However, they also added that finding an answer might be within the bounds 
of possibility.

General formulas for the chromatic polynomials of certain infinite families of 
graphs were found by Biggs, Damerell, and Sands [1972]. Read and Tutte [1988] 
mentioned additional cases where such formulas have been found.

mial in terms of a homogeneous symmetric function, and investigated problems on

Hypergraphs

15.1. ERDÖS' PROPERTY B 
Let T be a family of sets called edges. T is said to have property B if 
there is a subset 5of U T such that every edge has nonempty intersection 
with S and with 5, where S denotes the complement of S in U ?■ What 
is the minimum number m(ri) of edges in a family T of «-sets not having 
property ß? 
■ 
In terms of hypergraph coloring, this problem asks for the minimum number of 
edges possible in a 3-chromatic n-uniform hypergraph. It is due to Erdös [ 1963,1964], 
who gave the upper bound 
m(n) < n22"+l. 
Beck [1978] established the lower bound 
«s "ε2" < m(n) for all ε > 0 and all n > η(ε). 
A short proof of Beck's result was given by Spencer [1981]. 
Erdös [1963] gave the so far only known exact values m(2) = 3 and m(3) = 7. 
Based on work of Abbott and Hanson [1969], the upper bound m(4) s 23 was 
proved by Seymour [1974a] and Toft [1975a]. Moreover Aizley and Selfridge [1977] 
announced the lower bound w(4) s 19. The recursive upper bound 
m(2k + 1) < (2* + 1) ■ m(2k - 1) + 22* for all k > 1, 
giving the still best known bound m(5) ^ 51, was found by Abbott and Hanson 
[1969]. Toft [1975a] obtained the bound 
m{2k + 2) < (2* + 2) · m(2k) + 22k+i + if2* + 2 J for all k > 1.

Hypergraphs 
The results of a computer search carried out by Exoo [1990] were interpreted by 
the experimenter as evidence that the correct value of m(4) is, in fact, 23. Exoo 
11990] searched for improved upper bounds for m(ri) also for other small values of n. 
However, his constructions did not improve any of the known bounds obtained from 
the recursive formulas given above. 
It seems unknown if the edges of a minimum family of w-sets not having property 
B always have pairwise nonempty intersection, or at least have so for n not too large. 
It is the case for n = 2 and 3, but seems unlikely for n > 4. 
The minimum number of vertices in a 3-chromatic «-uniform hypergraph is 
obviously 2« - 1, attained by taking all «-sets of the 2« - 1 vertices as edges. 
Seymour [1974c] proved with an elegant linear algebra argument that the number of 
edges in any 3-chromatic hypergraph is at least as big as the number of vertices, and he 
called a 3-chromatic hypergraph with equal numbers of edges and vertices "square" 
(see also Problem 15.9). The graph K$ and the finite projective plane of order 2 (also 
called the "Fano configuration," having seven vertices and seven edges) are the unique 
2- and 3-uniform 3-chromatic hypergraphs with minimum edge numbers. They are 
both square. Does this behavior persist for larger values of «? For all values of «? 
Perhaps giving an indication that this situation might change for n ^ 4, Thomassen 
[1992] has proved that every critical 3-chromatic square hypergraph has either an 
edge of size at most 3 or a vertex of degree at most 3. 
Property B was introduced and studied by Bernstein [1908] and Miller [1937] in 
the infinite version. A more general property B(s), due to Erdös, has been studied in 
detail by Abbott and Liu [1979, 19811 (see Problem 15.2). 
■ 
15.2. PROPERTY B(s) 
Let T be a family of «-sets called edges. T is said to have property B(s), 
i s n, if there is a subset S of the set \J T such that 0 < \F Π S\ < s for 
every F E f , Let m(n, s) denote the size of a smallest family F of «-sets 
not having property B(s). What is the behavior of m(n, s)7 Determine the 
exact value of m(n, s) for any « and s where « > s > 4. Is it true for all 
ί > 4 that the inequality m{n, s) < m(s, s) holds for some «? 
■ 
The problem of determining or estimating m(n,s) was raised by Erdös and 
Hajnal [1961] and studied by Abbott and Liu [1979, 1981]. It is not difficult to see 
that m(n, 2) = 3 when n is even and m(n, 2) = 4 when n is odd. Moreover, it is known 
that m(n, 3) = 7 when n is divisible by 3 or 4. No exact value of m(n, 4) seems to 
be known (see Abbott and Liu [1988]). The case of m(4,4) is a long-standing open 
problem (see Problem 15.1). Seymour [1974a] and Toft [1975a] obtained the bound 
/w(4,4) < 23, based on a construction by Abbott and Hanson [1969]. 
The last question was asked by Abbott and Liu [ 19871, who in solving a problem 
of P. Erdös had shown that the inequality m{n, s) s m(s, s) does not hold in general. 
In particular they proved that m(n,s) < m(s,s) for .v sufficiently large and n large 
compared to .5. 

Finite Projective Planes 
233 
The corresponding question for j < 3 has a negative answer, as shown by Abbott 
and Liu [1979]. For s = 4 the answer is affirmative, since the bound w(4,4) ^ 1 9 
has been announced by Aizley and Selfridge [1977], and m(8,4) s 15 was proved 
by Abbott and Liu [1987]. The property S(4) was treated in detail by Abbott and 
Liu [1988], and Exoo [1990]. They proved m(n,4) ^ 29 except possibly for the 
eight values n — 19,23,29,31,37,38, 46 and 47. For s = 5 the answer seems 
unknown. 
Property B(n) of a family T of n-sets is equivalent to 2-colorability of T and is also 
called property B. Thus m(n, n) equals the function m(n) due to Erdös [1963, 1964] 
(see Problem 15.1). Property B was introduced by Bernstein [ 1908] and Miller [ 1937]. 
■ 
15.3. FINITE PROJECTIVE PLANES 
A finite projective plane of order n > 1 has n2 + n + 1 points and n2 + 
n + 1 lines all of size n + 1, with each point on exactly n + 1 lines, each 
pair of points on exactly one line, and each pair of lines having exactly 
one point in common. Does there exist a constant s for which the points 
of every finite projective plane of order n ^ 3 can be colored with colors 
1 and 2 such that the number of points of color 1 in each line lies strictly 
between 0 and s? 
■ 
A finite projective plane of order n may be thought of as an (n + l)-uniform 
(n + l)-regular hypergraph //(«) with each pair of vertices contained together in 
exactly one edge, and each pair of edges having exactly one vertex in common. For 
n = 1 and n = 2 the hypergraph H(n) is K$ and the Fano configuration, respectively, 
each of which is 3-chromatic. For n s 3 it is easy to see that //(«) is 2-colorable 
(e.g., consider three edges that do not share a common vertex, and for each vertex of 
H(n) color it 1 if it is contained in precisely one of these edges; otherwise, color it 2). 
The stronger property asked for above, that there exists a set S of vertices such that 
0 < \E Π S\ < s for all edges E, is called property B(s). For an «-uniform hypergraph 
the property B(n) is simply the property B to be 2-colorable (see Problem 15.1). 
The property B(s) was proposed by Erdös and Hajnal [1961] as a stronger form 
of property B (see also Abbott and Liu [1979]). The question above is due to Erdös 
and was stated by Erdös, Silverman, and Stein [1983], who proved with probabilistic 
methods that H(n) has property B(c log n) for c > 2e and n large enough. In addition, 
they gave a constructive proof that every H(n) has property B(n — c'^fn), where 
c' > 0 is a constant. 
It is not known for which values of n there exist projective planes of order n. All 
known planes are of prime power order. A special type, the projective plane PG(2, p') 
of order n = p'', where p is a prime, can be constructed from the 3-dimensional 
vector-space GF(p')3 over the finite field GF(p') with p' elements, letting the points 
and lines of PG(2,p') be the 1- and 2-dimensional subspaces, respectively (see, e.g., 
the authoritative book by Hall [1986]). For PG(2,p') and p > 3 Abbott and Liu 
[1985] replaced 2e in the result of Erdös, Silverman, and Stein [1983] by the smaller 

234 
Hypergraphs 
constant 2 / log 2. Moreover, Boros [1988] proved that the projective plane PG(2, p') 
has property B(p + 2) for all p a 3, thus extending an earlier result by Bruen and 
Fischer [1974] that PG(2,3') has property ß(5). 
■ 
15.4. STEINER TRIPLE SYSTEMS 
A Steiner triple system (STS) is a pair (V, £), where V is a set of n > 3 
vertices and £ is a set of 3~subsets of V such that each 2-subset of V is 
a subset of exactly one of the sets in £. (V, E) is ^-chromatic if V can be 
partitioned into k sets none of which contains an element of £ as a subset, 
but cannot be partitioned into fewer than k such sets. For which pairs 
(«, k) do ^-chromatic Steiner triple systems of order n exist? 
■ 
The chromatic numbers of Steiner triple systems were first studied by Rosa 
[ 1970a, 1970b]. It has been known since Kirkman [ 1847] that a STS of order n exists 
if and only if « = 1 or 3 (mod 6). Rosa [1970a, 1970b] proved that a 2-chromatic 
STS exists only if n = 3, and that a 3-chromatic STS exists of every possible order 
n > 7. The non-2-colorability was generalized to Steiner (f + l)-systems (where 3 
and 2 are replaced by t + 1 and t, respectively) with t even, by Gionfriddo and Lo 
Faro Π993]. 
De Brandes, Phelps, and Rödl [1982] proved that a 4-chromatic STS of order n 
exists for every n > 25 with n = 1 or 3 (mod 6), except possibly for n = 39, 43, or 
45. They conjectured that a 4-chromatic STS exists for each of these three values. 
For every i ä 3 there exists a number «* such that for every n = l o r 3 (mod 6) 
with n 2: nk there exists a ^-chromatic STS of order n. This was proved by de Brandes, 
Phelps, and Rödl [ 1982]. By the results mentioned above, it is known that /i3 = 7 and 
25 s /z4 ^- 49. De Brandes, Phelps, and Rödl [1982] gave as a general upper bound 
nk :£ ck2 log k, 
where c > 0 is a constant. Phelps and Rödl [1986] proved that this inequality gives 
the right order of magnitude for «*. 
Let n = 1 or 3 (mod 6) be fixed, and let 
C(n) = {k : there exists a ^-chromatic STS of order «}. 
De Brandes, Phelps, and Rödl [1982] conjectured that C(n) is an interval. 
Concerning the computational complexity of determining the chromatic number 
of a Steiner triple system, Phelps and Rödl [ 1984] proved that deciding 14-colorability 
of a STS is WP-complete, hence the existence of a polynomial algorithm to determine 
the chromatic number of any given STS is not to be expected. De Brandes, Phelps 
and Rödl [1982] asked if it is a difficult problem to decide 3-colorability of a Steiner 
triple system.

15.5. STEINER QUADRUPLE SYSTEMS 
A Steiner quadruple system (SQS) is a pair (V, £), where V is a set of 
n > 4 vertices and £ a set of 4-subsets of V such that each 3-subset of V 
is a subset of exactly one of the sets in £. (V, €) is ^-colorable if V can 
be partitioned into k sets none of which contains an element of £ as a 
subset. Does a 2-colorable SQS on n vertices exist for every n = 2 or 4 
(mod 6) except n - 14? 
■ 
The question was asked by Phelps [1991]. Hanani [1960] proved that a Steiner 
quadruple system of order n > 4 exists if and only if n = 2 or 4 (mod 6). Phelps and 
Rosa [1980] proved that no SQS of order n = 14 is 2-colorable. 
Two-colorable Steiner quadruple systems were first studied by Doyen and Van-
densavel [1971], who proved that a 2-colorable SQS of order n exists for every 
n = 4 or 8 (mod 12). Phelps and Rosa [1980] proved the existence for order 
n = 2 ■ 5" ■ \3h ■ IT for all a,b,c > 0. Phelps [1991] found a 2-colorable SQS 
of order n = 22; hence the smallest open cases are n = 30 and n = 38. Gionfriddo 
and Lo Faro [1993] proved that if a 2-coloring exists, then the two-color classes must 
be of equal size. Gionfriddo, Milici, and Tuza [to appear] obtained a necessary and 
sufficient condition for 2-colorability, from which the equal size of the color classes 
also follows. 
Colbourn, Colbourn, Phelps, and Rödl [1982] gave a polynomial algorithm for 
deciding 2-colorability of any SQS.

15.6. MINIMUM-WEIGHT 3-CHROMATIC HYPERGRAPHS 
Let the weight of an edge F in a hypergraph H be 2"|f|, and let the weight 
w{H) of H be the sum of the weights of all the edges of H. Define f(n) as 
the infimum of all possible weights of 3-chromatic hypergraphs in which 
every edge has size at least n. 
What is the order of magnitude of /(«)? Is /(«) equal to the weight of 
an «-uniform 3-chromatic hypergraph? If not, what are the values of c 
within the interval 1 ^ c < 2 that will ensure this to be the case with 
weight c^|/r| (instead of 2"|F|) for each edge F? Is c = 1 the only such 
value? 
■ 
Erdös [1963] introduced /(n), proved 1/2 s f(n), and conjectured /(«) —♦ 
oo as n —► t» (this conjecture was also mentioned in the very interesting paper on 
3-chromatic hypergraphs by Erdös and Loväsz [1975]). From the upper bound m(n) < 
n22"+1 of Erdös [1964] for the minimum number m(ri) of edges in a 3-chromatic n-
uniform hypergraph (see Problem 15.1) it follows that /(«) < m(n)/2" < 2«2, and 
moreover that if the weight is changed to c~'/'', with c > 2, for each edge F (instead 
of 2~"r'), then the corresponding function/ must be identically 0. 

236 
Hypergraphs 
Erdös and Selfridge [ 1973] described a generalization of the inequality 1 /2 s 
/(«) in an interesting game-theoretic setting. In a so-called positional game played 
on H two players alternately select a previously unselected vertex of H. The goal of 
each player is to collect all the vertices of some edge of//. Erdös and Selfridge [1973] 
proved that if w(H) < 1 /2, then the second player has a strategy that forces a draw. 
This implies that H has a 2-coloring in which the sizes of the color classes differ by at 
most one. Such equipartite colorings of hypergraphs have been studied by Berge and 
Sterboul [1977]. Positional games in general, and in particular higher-dimensional 
versions of Tic-tac-toe, were studied by Hales and Jewett [1963], Erdös and Selfridge 
[ 1973], and Beck [ 1981 ] (see also the book by Berge [ 1989], where Chapter 4 contains 
a treatment of hypergraph coloring and, as a special case, positional games). 
Beck [1978] proved Erdös' conjecture that/(«) --♦ °° as n —» ». Indeed, 
7/(n)-H002 > 
n 
where k2 denotes a "stack" of 2's of height k denned inductively by °2 = 1 and 
k+]2 = 2('2). 
As mentioned, we have the bound /(n) s m(n)/2" by the definition of m(n). 
Beck [1978] stated that he could not decide if strict inequality holds, and thus the 
second question above was raised. 
■ 
15.7. POSITIONAL GAMES 
A positional game POS(//) on a (finite) hypergraph H is a "Tic-tac-toe" 
type of game played by two players. The players alternately select a 
previously unselected vertex of H. The goal of each player is to collect 
all the vertices of some edge of H. Describe sufficient conditions under 
which the second player has a strategy to force at least a draw: for example, 
conditions of the type Δ(//) < f(n), where Δ(//) is the maximum degree 
of H and /(«) is some function of the minimum edge size n of H. The 
question may also be posed for restricted classes of hypergraphs, such as 
«-uniform hypergraphs, or "linear" hypergraphs (where any two edges 
share at most one vertex). 
■ 
Since in the game POS(//) it cannot be a disadvantage to start, and since its 
length is finite, there is always a strategy for the first player to force at least a draw. 
There may also be a strategy for the second player to force at least a draw (as, indeed, 
is the case for the usual game of Tic-tac-toe). A necessary condition for the second 
player to have a strategy to force at least a draw is that H has a 2-coloring in which 
the sizes of the color classes differ by at most one. Such equipartite 2-colorings have 
been studied by Berge and Sterboul [1977] (see also Berge [1989]). 
If the number of edges in an «-uniform hypergraph is strictly less than 2"~\ 
then the second player can force a draw, as proved by Erdös and Selfridge [1973], 
who also proved that this is best possible. The extremal situations in connection 

Tic-Tac-Toe 
237 
with the theorem of Erdös and Selfridge were investigated by Lu [1992]. For linear 
hypergraphs the corresponding number of edges is of the order of magnitude 4", as 
conjectured by P. Erdös and proved by Beck [1981]. 
Erdös and Loväsz [1975] proved that if// is «-uniform and Δ(//) < 2"~l /{An), 
then H is 2-colorable. This was the first application of the now famous Loväsz local 
lemma (see Chapter 4 in Graham, Rothschild, and Spencer [1990], or Chapter 5 in 
Alon and Spencer [1992]). The problem above asks for a similar theorem with the 
stronger conclusion that the second player can force a draw. The problem was raised 
by Beck [1981], who asked as one of the most interesting problems on positional 
games: For which order of magnitude of Δ(//) for an «-uniform hypergraph H is 
there a strategy for the second player to force a draw? 
Hales and Jewett [1963] noted that if all the edges E\,E2,...,EmoiH 
have size 
at least n, and if Δ(//) £ n/2, then H has distinct vertices x\,y\,X2,yi·--- 
,Xm,y», 
such that Xj, yt E £,· for all i (by a standard argument from matching theory). The 
second player consequently has a simple strategy for forcing a draw: whenever the 
first player chooses some JC,·, the reply is to choose the corresponding y„ and vice 
versa. 
Beck and Csirmaz [1982] gave an excellent overview of many variations and gen-
eral results on positional games, including infinite versions. Some of their problems 
with particular relevance to hypergraph coloring were answered by Galvin [1990]. 
■ 
15.8. 
TIC-TAC-TOE 
The (k, ri) version of the positional game Tic-tac-toe, for positive integers 
k and n, is played on a "board" consisting of a hypergraph H{k, ri) defined 
as follows. The vertices of H(k, ri) are the k" integer coordinate points 
(a\, a2,..., 
an) with 1 < a, < fc for all i, and the edges of H(k, ri) are all 
possible sets of k of these points on a straight line in R". The hypergraph 
H{k, ri) is called the «-dimensional cube of side k. 
In Tic-tac-toe on H{k, ri) two players alternately select a previously un-
selected vertex of H(k, ri). The goal of each player is to collect all the 
vertices of some edge of H(k, ri). 
Determine for which pairs (k, ri) the hypergraph H(k, ri) has a 2-coloring. 
Determine for which pairs (k, ri) the hypergraph H{k, ri) has an equipartite 
2-coloring, that is, a 2-coloring such that the color classes differ in size by 
at most one. Determine for which pairs the second player has a strategy 
to force at least a draw when playing Tic-tac-toe on H(k, ri). 
As weaker problems, but still extremely difficult in terms of finding 
exact answers, or just orders of magnitude, consider the following three 
questions. For each n, what is the largest value p(w) of k for which H{k, ri) 
is not 2-colorable? For each n, what is the largest value σ(η) oik for which 
H{k, ri) is not equipartite 2-colorable? For each n, what is the largest value 

238 
Hypergraphs 
τ(η) of k for which the second player in Tic-tac-toe on H(k, n) cannot 
force a draw? 
Can the second player force a draw when the number of vertices is at 
least twice the number of edges? 
■ 
For a general description of positional games on a hypergraph, see Problem 15.7. 
Tic-tac-toe for higher dimensions has been studied by Gardner [1959], Hales and 
Jewett [1963], Erdös and Selfridge 11973], Paul [1978], and Beck [1981], among 
others. A fine survey was given by Patashnik [1980], including a description of a 
computer investigation of the case //(4,3) of 3-dimensional Tic-tac-toe of side 4, 
also called "Qubic." 
A necessary condition for the second player to have a strategy to force at least a 
draw is that H(k, n) have an equipartite 2-coloring. Of course, the first player might 
have a winning strategy even if H(k, n) has an equipartite 2-coloring. For Tic-tac-
toe there is only one known example of this kind, namely the game of "Qubic" as 
analyzed by Patashnik [1980J. 
The ^-uniform hypergraph H(k, n) has ((k + 2)" - k")/2 edges (see Moser [ 1948] 
for an elegant four-line proof, and also Paul [1978] and Patashnik [ 1980]). Thus the 
final question above asks if the second player can force a draw when ^ > 2 · (21'" -
1) ' (= In/ log 2). The question is due to Hales and Jewett [ 1963] and was answered 
in the affirmative by Beck [1981] for n > 100. The background for the question is 
the simple observation that if there is a pair of vertices in each edge, such that all 
the pairs are pairwise disjoint, then the second player has an easy strategy to force 
a draw. For example the game "Five-in-a-row" on a 5 X 5 board (i.e., Tic-tac-toe on 
H(5,2)) allows such a "Hales-Jewett pairing". The game "Four-in-a-row" on a 4 X 4 
board has not enough room for a Hales-Jewett pairing, but the second player can 
force a draw nevertheless. Indeed, the second player can force a draw when playing 
Four-in-a-row on a 5 X 5 board (see Chapter 22 in Berlekamp, Conway and Guy 
[1982] for these and many other interesting results and variations on Tic-tac-toe; for 
example, a proof that "Nine-in-a-row" on an infinite 2-dimensional board has a draw 
strategy for the second player). 
As for the functions p, σ, and τ, of course p(«) ^ σ(η) < τ(η). Hales and Jewett 
[1963] proved that p(n) -* <x as n —♦ », and p(n) ^ n for all n. They also established 
an exponential upper bound on τ(/ι), namely τ(η) < 3" - 2. Beck [ 1981 ] proved that 
τ(η) < (log 3/log 2)« + 4^/w log n + 4 for n > 100. 
Paul [1975, 1979] proved that σ(η) < n - 1 for n > 4, p(n) < n - 2 for n > 8, 
and p(n) < « - 3 for « > 15. The result on "Qubic" by Patashnik [1980] referred 
to above shows that τ(3) > 4. While p(2) = 2, p(3) = 3, and p(4) = 3, the exact 
values of p(«) remain unknown for n ^ 5. Graham, Wen-Ching Winnie Li, and Paul 
[1981a, 1981b] proved that p{ri)/n — 0 as n — <». 
The result that p(n) —♦ * as n —» » can also be expressed as follows. For a given 
it there exists a least integer HJ(k) such that the hypergraph H(k, ri) has chromatic 
number at least 3 for all n ä HJ(k). This is a Ramsey theory formulation of the 

Square Hypergraphs 
239 
Hales-Jewett theorem. (To be precise, the function HJ(k) is usually defined in terms 
of a subhypergraph C(k, n) of H(k, n), where an edge consists of points JC|, x2 
x* 
from {1,2,... ,k}" so that in each coordinate./' either the jt,y are constant, or A-,, = /.See 
Graham, Rothschild, and Spencer [ 1990]. We do not know if this makes any significant 
difference for the corresponding function, but we expect not.) Graham, Rothschild, 
and Spencer [1990] said that"... the Hales-Jewett theorem strips van der Waerden's 
theorem of its unessential elements and reveals the heart of Ramsey theory. It provides 
a focal point from which many results can be derived and acts as a cornerstone for 
much of the more advanced work." (The theorem of van der Waerden is described in 
Problem 15.12.) The slow growth of p(n) is equivalent to a fast growth of HJ(k). The 
best upper bound for HJ(k) so far has been obtained by Shelah [ 1988] (see Graham, 
Rothschild, and Spencer [1990] for a very fine exposition of Shelah's extraordinary 
achievement and its implications). Graham, Rothschild, and Spencer [1990] men-
tioned that the senior author (R. Graham) has a standing offer of $1000 for a proof 
(or disproof) that HJ(k) < ck2 for some constant c > 0 (defining "m inductively by 
°m = 1 and "+]m = m("m) for n,m s 0). In the same way that p(n) corresponds to 
HJ(k), so does the function τ(«) correspond to a function GHJ(k). Concerning this 
function Graham, Rothschild, and Spencer [1990] remarked that"... the exact nature 
ofGHJ remains a puzzle." 
■ 
15.9. SQUARE HYPERGRAPHS 
A hypergraph H with an equal number of vertices and edges, say with 
|V(H)\ = \E(H)\ = v, is called a square hypergraph of size v. 
Does there exist a polynomial algorithm to decide for a square hypergraph 
if it is critical 3-chromatic? 
Determine for all integers n S: 2 the least possible size w(n) of a 
critical 3-chromatic square hypergraph in which every edge has size 
at least n. 
■ 
Square hypergraphs may at first sight seem rather esoteric. However, Seymour 
[1974c] showed that they are extremely interesting combinatorial objects. Seymour 
[1974c] proved with a simple linear algebra argument that a critical 3-chromatic hy-
pergraph H satisfies \E(H)\ s \V(H)\. Moreover, he proved that if \E(H)\ = \V(H)\, 
then the dual hypergraph H* is also a critical 3-chromatic square hypergraph. (The 
dual hypergraph H* has £(//) as vertex set and an edge for each vertex A of H 
consisting of all the edges in H containing x.) This implies that the second problem 
posed above is equivalent to the following: Determine for all integers n s 2 the least 
possible size w(n) of a 3-chromatic square hypergraph in which all vertices have 
degree at least n. 
Even more strikingly, Seymour [1974c] characterized the critical 3-chromatic 
square hypergraphs in terms of directed graphs. He proved that given a critical 3-

240 
Hypergraphs 
chromatic square hypergraph H of size v, the collection of edges E\,Ei,...,Ev 
has a 
system of distinct representatives x\,xt 
xv where x, S £, for 1 < / < v. Define 
a directed graph G(H) on the vertex set {*i,.*2>... ,x»} of // by joining each *,· to 
all the vertices of £,· — *,· with edges directed away from *,. Then G(H) is strongly 
connected and without directed cycles of even length. Conversely, from any strongly 
connected directed graph G without even cycles, define a hypergraph H(G) on the 
vertex set V(G) by letting each vertex x correspond to an edge consisting of x itself 
together with alHhe vertices in G that can be reached by one edge directed away 
from x. Then H(G) is a critical 3-chromatic square hypergraph, as shown by Seymour 
[1974c]. 
Thus to ask for a polynomial algorithm to decide if a square hypergraph is critical 
3-chromatic is equivalent to ask for a polynomial algorithm to decide if a directed 
graph is without directed cycles of even length. This difficult problem has been 
attacked by Thomassen [1985, 1986, 1992] and Seymour and Thomassen [1987]. 
The related problem of deciding if a square hypergraph has chromatic number at 
least 3 seems very hard; in fact, it is equivalent to the WP-complete problem (see 
Theorem 19 in Chapter 1) of deciding if a given hypergraph is 2-colorable. Indeed, 
by adding new edges and new vertices to any given hypergraph it is easy to produce 
a square hypergraph that is 2-colorable if and only if the given one is. 
In a paper on qualitative matrix theory, Thomassen [1986] investigated so-
called sign nonsingular square matrices. These are nonsingular (i.e., with nonzero 
determinants) real matrices for which changes of nonzero elements to other values 
of the same signs do not destroy nonsingularity. Using the aforementioned result 
of Seymour [1974c] it can be seen that the (0,l)-valued incidence vectors of a 
critical 3-chromatic square hypergraph of size v form the rows of a (0,1 )-valued sign 
nonsingular irreducible matrix of rank v, and vice versa (see Thomassen [1986]). (A 
sign nonsingular matrix is said to be irreducible if it cannot be written, after permuting 
rows and columns, as 
0 M3J 
where M\ and Λ/3 are nonempty square matrices.) This gives yet another interest-
ing equivalence between critical 3-chromatic square hypergraphs and a seemingly 
different type of structure. 
Concerning the function w it is not clear that w(n) exists for all values of «. Indeed 
Loväsz [1975] asked about this, formulated as a problem on even directed cycles. 
Thomassen [1985] proved constructively, in terms of directed graphs without even 
cycles, that w(n) exists for all n and satisfies 2"" ' < w(n) ^ 4". Thus w(n) grows 
exponentially with n. The only exact values that are known seem to be w(2) = 3 and 
w(3) = 7. 
Thomassen [1992] proved that every critical 3-chromatic square hypergraph 
either has an edge of size at most 3 or a vertex of degree at most 3. This result was 
again obtained as a corollary of an interesting result on directed graphs without even 
cycles.

15.10. SIZE OF 3-CHROMATIC UNIFORM CLIQUES 
A hypergraph is said to be a clique if any two edges have a nonempty 
intersection. What are the possible values of the number of edges and the 
number of vertices of n-uniform 3-chromatic cliques? 
■ 
This question is due to Erdös and Loväsz [1975], who noted that every n-
uniform clique is 3-colorable. A result of Catczynska-Kartowicz [1964] implies that 
there is only a finite number of «-uniform cliques for any fixed n. Thus numbers 
min |.F|, min | U-^l. M{n) = max \F\, and N(n) = max HJ-^I exist for all «, where 
the minima and maxima are taken over all 3-chromatic «-uniform cliques T. For the 
maxima Erdös and Loväsz [1975] established the following inequalities: 
«!(e - 1) < M(«) < n" 
l / 2 n - 2 \ 
„ 
„ 
mr, x 
n(ln- 
\\ 
2\n-x)+2n-2^N{n)^2{n-l) 
Tuza [1985] gave improved bounds on N(n): 
Jin - 4\ 
„ 
„ 
x7 
(in - \\ 
(in - 4\ 
2{n-l)+2n-4^N^^{n-l) 
+ 
{n-l) 
and conjectured (see Erdös [1984]) that this lower bound is best possible for n > 4 . 
The special values N(3) = 7 and N(4) = 16 were determined by Hanson and Toft 
[1983]. For the function M, Tuza [to appear] obtained the improved upper bound 
M(«)<(1 - \/e + o(l))n", 
where o(l) —► 0 as n —♦ °°. 
In an «-uniform clique with the weaker property that no set of n - 1 vertices 
intersects all edges, the minimum possible number of edges is bounded by c ■ n for 
some constant c. This deep result was obtained by Kahn [1994a] (see also Kahn 
[1994b]). 
■ 
15.11. MONOCHROMATIC SUM-SETS 
For n > k > 0 and for every fc-subset 5 C {1,2,...,«} let P(S) denote 
the set of all numbers that can be written as a sum without repetitions of 
elements in S; that is, P(S) = {£,e/1 : / C S}. Let TnM be the family of 
those sets P(S) that are contained in {1,2,...,«}, 
Tn* = {P(S)C{l,2,...,n}:SC{l,2,... /n}and|S| = *}. 

242 
Hypergraphs 
For every positive k, if there exists a number n so that the hypergraph ΤηΜ 
is not 2-colorable, let F(k) denote the smallest such n. What is the order 
of magnitude of F(k)l 
■ 
It follows from a theorem attributed to J. Folkman that F(k) exists for all k > 0 
(see Graham, Rothschild, and Spencer [1990]). The problem of determining an upper 
bound on F(k) was studied by Taylor [1981a], who obtained 
F(k) < 4*~33, 
where "m denotes a "stack" of m's of height n, defined inductively by °m = 1 and 
n+im = m"mfoTn,m>0. 
A lower bound was proved by Erdös and Spencer [1989]: 
F(k) > 2ck2/logk 
for a constant c > 0. No better bounds seem known. 
■ 
15.12. ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 
For n > k > 0 let W„,k denote the family of subsets of {1,2,..., n} con-
sisting of arithmetic progressions of k terms, that is, subsets {a, a + b, a + 
2b,...,a 
+ (k- ])b} with a,b> 0anda + (* - \)b < n. York > 0 let 
W(k) denote the smallest n (it exists) such that in any 2-coloring of the 
integers 1,2 
n, some element of W„,* is monochromatic. Does W(k) 
satisfy 
W(k) < c*2 
for some constant c > 0 (where "m is defined inductively by °m = 1 and 
"+1m = m"mforn,w>0)? 
■ 
The question was asked by R.L. Graham (see Shelah [1988]), who conjectured 
that the answer is affirmative. Graham offered $1000 for a proof of this conjecture. 
The theorem of van der Waerden [1927] states that W(k) exists for all k > 0, 
as conjectured by 1. Schur (see A. Brauer's introduction to /. Schur—Gesammelte 
Abhandlungen, Springer-Verlag, 1973). Other proofs were given by Hales and Jewett 
[1963], Graham and Rothschild [1971], and Furstenberg [1982], without producing 
a "reasonable" upper bound for W(k). The first such bound was proved by Shelah 
[1988], who was in fact awarded $500 by Graham for the improved bound, half of 
the original prize for settling the conjecture completely (Graham, Rothschild, and 
Spencer [1990] reported that the original offer of $1000 still stands, nevertheless). 
Shelah's bound can be formulated in terms of the Ackermann hierarchy /o,/i ,/2,... 

Unprovability 
243 
of functions from the set of nonnegative integers to itself, defined inductively as 
follows: 
fo(x) = x + 1, and 
/; +iW = / ; W W f o r i > 0 , 
where / w denotes the function / iterated x times. Expressed in terms of these 
functions, Shelah [1988] obtained the upper bound W(k) ^ faic'k) for a constant 
c' > 0, thus substantially improving the previously known bounds. These involved 
functions similar to the Ackermann function /»(JC) = fx(x), which grows very rapidly 
compared with any function /*(*) for fixed k > 0. (Graham, Rothschild, and Spencer 
[1990] included a proof and a discussion of Shelah's result in their monograph on 
Ramsey theory.) The Graham conjecture would imply that W(k) < fo(ck) for constant 
c > 0 . 
The best known lower bounds for W(k) grow exponentially. Graham, Rothschild, 
and Spencer [ 1990] remarked that this is perhaps the right order of magnitude. Prömel 
and Voigt [1990] obtained stronger versions of van der Waerden's theorem formulated 
in terms of hypergraph coloring. Alon, Caro, and Tuza [1989] investigated a "totally 
multicolored" version of the problem, where each color is used at most a constant 
number of times, and where the aim is to find arithmetic progressions all terms of 
which are colored differently. 
■ 
15.13. 
UNPROVABILITY 
For positive integers p, n, and N, with p,n < N, let VPi„,N be the family 
of sets where each set consists of all p-subsets of a set Y, for all sets 
Y Q{\,2,...,N} 
with \Y\ > n and \Y\ > min Y. Let r„,p(k) be the smal-
lest N, if one exists, such that Vp,„iAr is not ^-colorable. Is it possible to 
prove from the Peano axioms of arithmetic that rp+i p(2) exists for all 
p > 0? 
■ 
The problem was mentioned by Paris [1990] and by Loebl and NeSetril [1991]. 
Paris and Harrington [1977] proved that r„jP(k) exists for all integers n, k, p > 0 and 
also proved that the existence cannot be proved from Peano's axioms. Thus Paris 
and Harrington gave the first example of a natural combinatorial statement that is 
unprovable. The first example of a true statement that can be formulated but not 
proved in Peano arithmetic was given by Gödel [1931]. 
Paris [1990] reported that the result of Paris and Harrington [1977] was later 
strengthened, in one direction by Paris and Harrington, who showed that the existence 
for all it > 0 of rk+\pk(k) is unprovable, and in another direction by J. Quinsey, who 
proved that the existence for all p > 0 of rp+ χ ρ(3) is unprovable in Peano arithmetic. 
Ketonen and Solovay [1981] suggested that the existence of functions such as 
y(P) = rp+i,p(2) might be shown unprovable by showing that y(p) grows faster than

15.14. THE DIRECT PRODUCT OF HYPERGRAPHS 
Given two hypergraphs H = (X,S) and H' = (Y,F), with E = (£, : 
/' G /), T = (Fj : j G /), their direct product is a hypergraph H X H1 
with vertex set X X K and with edges £, X F,· for (i,j) G I XJ. Given 
p,q > 0 let/(p,qr) denote the smallest chromatic number χ(Η X //') of 
any direct product where χ(Η) — p and χ(Η') = <?. is it true that 
f(p, q) -■-> oo as p, ^ —» oo? 
g 
This problem was posed by Berge and Simonovits [1974]. They remarked that 
the problem of finding a good estimate for f(p, q) seems to be difficult. 
Berge and Simonovits [1974] proved that the maximum chromatic number of 
a direct product H X //', with χ(Η) = p and χ(Η') — q, is attained by the product 
Kjx K*, where Kr
m denotes the hypergraph consisting of all /-subsets of a set of size 
m. Sterboul [1974] proved among other similar results 
™—°° 
yjm 
The chromatic numbers of direct products of the form K'm X Ks
n were also studied 
by Erdös and Rado [1956] and by Chvätal [1969].

15.15. MAXIMAL COMPLETE SUBGRAPHS 
IN PERFECT GRAPHS 
Let G be a graph and let F{G) denote the hypergraph with vertex set 
V{G) whose edge set is the family of subsets of V(G) consisting of the 
vertex sets of the maximal complete subgraphs of G. Does there exist 
some constant k so that it is always possible to &-color the hypergraph 
HG) if G is a perfect graph? 
■ 
This question was asked by Duffus, Sands, Sauer, and Woodrow [1991], who 
proved that F{G) can be 2-colored if G is a comparability graph, that is, if V(G) is the 
set of elements of a partially ordered set P with two elements x and y ofP joined by an 
edge in G if and only if JC and y are comparable in P. The comparability graphs form 
a well-known class of perfect graphs (see, e.g., Berge [1975]). Duffus, Kierstead, 
and Trotter [1991] proved that if G is the complement of a comparability graph G, 

Coloring Triangulable Manifolds 
245 
then T(G) is 3-colorable. By the perfect graph theorem of L. Loväsz (Theorem 24 in 
Chapter 1) G is perfect if G is perfect. 
For graphs G in general, there is no constant k such that T(G) can always be 
colored using at most k colors. This follows from constructions of triangle-free graphs 
with arbitrarily high chromatic numbers (Theorem 21 in Chapter 1). 
■ 
15.16. COLORING TRIANGULABLE MANIFOLDS 
For a finite simplicial complex K of dimension m > 1, define HK as the 
hypergraph having the (m - 2)-dimensional Simplexes of K as its vertex 
set, and having, for every (m — l)-dimensional simplex in K, an edge 
containing precisely the vertices that form the faces of the simplex. 
For m > 1, let X be any "triangulable" m-dimensional space; that is, X 
is homeomorphic to the geometric realization \K\ of a finite simplicial 
complex K. K is then said to triangulate X. Define the (possibly infinite) 
chromatic number χ(Χ) of X as 
χ(Χ) = supx(HK) where K triangulates X. 
K 
Do there exist a n m ^ 3 and two m-dimensional (closed, Hausdorff) 
triangulable manifolds X and Y with χ(Χ) Φ χ(Υ)Ί 
■ 
This question was asked by Sarkaria [1983a],1 who anticipated a negative answer. 
It should be noted that all manifolds of dimension m ^ 3, but not all manifolds of 
dimension m > 3, are triangulable (see Massey [1991] for results and references). 
The answer to the corresponding question for m = 2 is affirmative since every 2-
dimensional manifold can be triangulated, and since the bound given by P.J. Heawood 
for any surface S of Euler characteristic e(S) < 2, 
*(s) - U (
?+^
49 ~
 24e<
s))J 
(see Theorem 2 in Chapter 1) is met with equality, except in the case of the Klein 
bottle with ^(Klein bottle) = 6 (see Theorem 3 in Chapter 1). Hence there exist 
2-dimensional manifolds of all chromatic numbers larger than 5. 
For dimension m ä 3 Sarkaria [1982] proved, using the four-color theorem, 
that every closed triangulable manifold X has chromatic number χ(Χ) ^ 4. Sarkaria 
[1983a] also gave a short proof of χ{Χ) ^ 6, using ideas of Grünbaum [1970b] and 
without using the four-color theorem.

Hypergraphs 
Sarkaria [1981, 1983b, 1987] introduced and studied more general chromatic 
numbers χ,(Χ) for 0 ^ /' < m defined as follows. Given a triangulation K of X, 
χ,(Κ) is defined as the chromatic number of the hypergraph having the /-dimensional 
Simplexes of K as its vertices, with edges corresponding to the (j + 1 )-dimensional 
simplexes of K, and with hypergraph incidence defined by simplicial containment. 
Let 
χΧΧ) = sup χ: (K) where K triangulates X. 
K 
Among other results, Sarkaria proved that xm_t(X) = 2forallw s 2, and that χ^Χ) is 
infinite if m > 2i + 2, and he conjectured that χ<(Χ) is finite if m ^ 2/ + 2. Grünbaum 
[1970b] studied similar hypergraphs. However, he considered the different coloring 
problem of coloring the vertices subject to the condition that no two vertices belonging 
to the same edge may be colored alike. 
Sarkaria [1981, 1987] also studied the chromatic number of pseudo-manifolds. 
In two dimensions these are obtained from surfaces by identifying finite sets of single 
points (for the general definition, see, e.g., Massey [1991]). He thus formulated 
a generalization of the empire problem of P.J. Heawood (Problem 3.1) to higher 
dimensions.

15.17. BERGE'S CONJECTURE ON EDGE-COLORING 
Let the closure of a hypergraph //, denoted by H, be defined as the 
hypergraph with the same vertex set as //, such that E is an edge in H if 
and only if £ is a nonempty subset of some edge in H. In particular, ft in 
general contains loops (i.e., edges of size 1). H is said to be linear if the 
intersection of every pair of edges in H contains at most one vertex. If// 
is linear, is it true that 
χ'φ) = Δ(//), 
where the edge-chromatic number χ' is the smallest number of colors that 
can be used to color the edges so that two edges receive different colors 
if they have nonempty intersection, and where Δ denotes the maximum 
degree? 
■ 
This question was asked by Berge [1990], who conjectured that the answer is 
affirmative. 
Berge's conjecture would generalize the theorem of V.G. Vizing (Theorem 29 in 
Chapter 1) that a simple graph G can be edge-colored with A(G) + 1 colors. Vizing's 
theorem follows by observing that a simple graph is always linear, and that G is

obtained from G by adding one loop for every vertex, hence A(G) = A(G) + 1. (Note 
that the "degree" of a vertex means precisely the number of edges containing it—thus 
a loop is not counted twice, as it is mostly practiced for graphs.) 
Stein [1983] proved Δ(//) = Δο(//) for every linear hypergraph H, where Δ0 
denotes the maximum number of edges with pairwise nonempty intersection. In 
general, it is clear that χ' ^ Aj > A. Thus for Berge's conjecture it is sufficient to 
prove the seemingly weaker statement χ'φ) 
s Δο(//). The conjecture that Δ0(//) = 
Δ(//) holds for the closure of every hypergraph H is an unsolved conjecture of Chvätal 
[1974a]. 
Partial results on the conjectures of Berge and Chvätal were obtained by Gion-
friddo and Tuza [1994].

Infinite Chromatic Graphs

16.1. SPARSE SUBGRAPHS OF HIGH CHROMATIC NUMBER 
Is it true for every integer g ^ 4 that every K0-chromatic graph contains 
an X0-chromatic subgraph in which every cycle has length at least g? 
Is it true for every infinite cardinal κ > X0 that every κ-chromatic graph 
contains a triangle-free κ-chromatic subgraph? 
Is there any infinite cardinal κ for which it is true for every integer g > 4 
that every κ-chromatic graph G contains an X0-chromatic subgraph in 
which every cycle has length at least gl 
■ 
It is an easy consequence of the theorem of de Bruijn and Erdös [1951] (The-
orem 1 in Chapter 1) that a graph G has infinite chromatic number if and only 
if G contains an infinite sequence {G*} of pairwise disjoint finite graphs such that 
X(Gk) 5: k. The union of the graphs G* is X0-chromatic, and therefore the study of 
Xo-chromatic graphs reduces in a sense to finite graphs. 
Indeed, it follows from the preceding observation that an affirmative answer to 
the first question stated above for a value g0 of g is equivalent to an affirmative 
answer to Problem 7.5 for go and all k. To see this, assume first that the answer to 
Problem 7.5 is negative for some value k0 of k. Let G be the disjoint union of finite j -
chromatic counterexamples G, for infinitely many j . Then G is X0-chromatic without 
a £0-chromatic subgraph in which every cycle has length at least g0. But then G is a 
counterexample to the first question above. Conversely, suppose that the answer to 
Problem 7.5 is affirmative for go and all k. For an Xo-chromatic graph G consider 
an infinite sequence {Gy} of disjoint finite subgraphs of G with G; being y-chromatic. 
Then there exists an infinite sequence {W*} of disjoint subgraphs of the graphs from 
{Gj} so that Hk is fc-chromatic and every cycle in each //* has length at least go- The 
union H of all the graphs //* is an X0-chromatic subgraph of G in which every cycle 
has length at least g0. 
The first question is due to P. Erdös and A. Hajnal, and it has been solved in the 
affirmative for g = 4 by V. Rödl (see Problem 7.5).

Infinite Chromatic Graphs 
If N0 in the first question is replaced by ar.y larger cardinal, then the answer 
is negative for g ä 5 . This follows from the result of Erdös and Hajnal [1966] that 
every graph of chromatic number strictly larger than x, where κ ^ No, contains 
the complete bipartite graph K„ K< as a subgraph for every positive integer n (κ+ 
denotes the least cardinal satisfying κ ' > κ) and hence contains 4-cycles (see also 
the comprehensive survey on infinite graphs by Thomassen [ 1983]). However, the 
problem remains open for g — 4. This gives rise to the second question above, due to 
Erdös and Hajnal, who conjectured that the answer is affirmative (see Erdös [1975]). 
The existence of triangle-free κ-chromatic graphs for all infinite cardinals κ was 
first proved by Erdös and Rado [1959]. The order of such graphs may, in fact, be just 
K (see Erdös and Rado [ I960]). More generally, the existence for every integer g of 
«-chromatic graphs with all odd cycles of length at least g was proved by Erdös and 
Hajnal [1966]. 
The third question above is a weaker version of the first question. Again it is due 
to P. Erdös and A. Hajnal, who conjectured that the answer is affirmative (see Erdös 
[1975]). 
■ 
16.2. INFINITE CHROMATIC SUBGRAPHS 
Let m and n be cardinals where m> n, and let G be a graph of chromatic 
number m. Is it true that G has a subgraph of chromatic number n? 
■ 
The question was asked by Galvin [1973], who remarked that for n ^ No and 
any m > n the answer is affirmative by the theorem of de Bruijn and Erdös [1951] 
(Theorem 1 in Chapter 1), and he asked in particular if the answer is affirmative for 
m - N2 and n - Ni. Komjäth [1988] proved that the affirmative answer with m = N2 
and n = Ki is consistent with the peculiar statement 2*° = N3, but he remarked that 
it is not known if it is consistent with the generalized continuum hypothesis. 
If one asks for an induced subgraph of G with chromatic number n, the question 
is also open. However, and perhaps surprisingly, Galvin proved (see Erdös [1981]) 
that with this stronger conclusion, the affirmative answer for m = N2 and n = N] 
implies the continuum hypothesis. 
■ 
16.3. ALMOST BIPARTITE SUBGRAPHS 
Is it true that for every f(n) —* °° there is always a graph of chromatic 
number No every «-vertex subgraph of which can be made bipartite by 
deleting at most f(n) edges? 
■ 
The question was asked by Erdös, Hajnal, and Szemeredi [1982], In particular, 
they asked if the statement holds for f(n) = logw n, the i times iterated logarithm, 
for any fixed i > l . Rödl [1982] solved the corresponding question for r-uniform 
hypergraphs in the affirmative for all /■ s 3. 

Trees in Triangle-Free Graphs 
253 
Erdös, Hajnal, and Szemeredi [1982] pointed out that the problem is of finite 
character. In this connection they mentioned a construction due to L. Loväsz, giving 
for some constant c and for every k & 2 a finite graph Gk of chromatic number k + 2, 
such that every subgraph H can be made bipartite by deleting at most c\V(H)\l~1//k 
edges. We do not know if this is best possible. The union of an infinite sequence of 
graphs Gk with Λ —» «> shows that for the particular function /(«) = en the answer 
is affirmative. Loväsz's construction is not given in detail in the paper by Erdös, 
Hajnal, and Szemeredi [1982]. For k = 2 it is due to Gallai [1963a] and is formed by 
completing an n X n grid (with n even) to a square tessellation of the Klein bottle. 
The construction for larger values of k seems to be a generalization of this (but we 
do not know exactly how it is defined). Other constructions with similar properties 
can be derived from further results of Loväsz [1983b]. 
The answer to the question for every f(n) —* *>, obtained by replacing "chromatic 
number No" with "uncountable chromatic number" is negative. Erdös, Hajnal, and 
Szemerodi [1982] proved that every graph G with uncountable chromatic number 
contains a subgraph H with n vertices, for infinitely many n, such that the number of 
edges that must be removed from H to make the graph bipartite is at least d · n, for a 
constant d > 0 depending on G. 
The question was mentioned by Erdös [1992], who offered $100 for a solution. 
■ 
16.4. LARGE FINITE n-CHROMATIC SUBGRAPHS 
Is there a function / : Z+ —► Z+ for which every graph of uncountable 
chromatic number contains an «-chromatic graph of at most /(«) vertices 
for all n 2:1? 
■ 
The question is due to Erdös [1975]. Erdös, Hajnal, and Szemeredi [1982] 
proved that if such a function /(«) exists, then /(«) must tend to infinity faster than 
any function obtained by iterating the exponential function a fixed number of times. 
The answer to the corresponding question for graphs of chromatic number K0 
is that no such f(n) exists. In fact, for any function / : Z+ —» Z+ there exists a 
graph Gf of chromatic number x(Gf) = K0 so that for all n s 3, every subgraph 
H C G/ on f(n) vertices has chromatic number χ(Η) < n. Gf can be constructed as 
follows: For each k > 3 let G* denote a ^-chromatic graph on n* vertices for which 
every subgraph of G* on at most nk/2 vertices is 3-colorable, where n3 s 2/(3) 
and nk s max{2/(&), n*_ [} for k S: 4. The existence of such graphs G* for all k s 3 
follows from a result of Erdös [1962]. Finally, let Gf be the disjoint union of all the 
graphs Gk. 
The problem was mentioned by Erdös [1992], who offered $250 for a solution. 
■ 
16.5. TREES IN TRIANGLE-FREE GRAPHS 
If G is a triangle-free graph of infinite chromatic number, does G contain 
every finite tree as an induced subgraph? 
■ 

254 
Infinite Chromatic Graphs 
The question was asked by Gyärfäs [1975], who conjectured that the answer is 
affirmative. To prove this for all infinite chromatic numbers it suffices to prove it 
for the chromatic number K0 (this follows from the theorem of de Bruijn and Erdös 
[1951], see Theorem 1 in Chapter 1 and the discussion in Problem 16.1). 
The existence of triangle-free κ-chromatic graphs for all infinite cardinals κ was 
first proved by Erdös and Rado [1959]. The order of such graphs may, in fact, be 
just K (see Erdös and Rado [I960]). More generally, the existence for all integers g 
of κ-chromatic graphs in which all odd cycles have length at least g was proved by 
Erdös and Hajnal [1966]. 
Gyärfäs, Szemeredi, and Tuza [1980] proved, among other results, that the 
conjecture is true for every graph G without a 4-cycle (such a G is automatically 
No-colorable by a result of Erdös and Hajnal [1966]). 
■ 
16.6. UNAVOIDABLE CLASSES OF FINITE SUBGRAPHS 
Let A be a class of finite graphs. What properties must A have that for 
every infinite cardinal κ there should be a graph G of chromatic number 
K every finite subgraph of which should be in ΑΊ In particular, does this 
hold when A is the set of finite subgraphs of any graph with chromatic 
number ^!? 
■ 
The question was asked by Erdös [1975], motivated by the "in particular" ques-
tion due to Taylor [ 1971 ]. Erdös [ 1985] gave an excellent overview of this and related 
problems. 
Erdös and Hajnal [1966] proved that A must contain all bipartite graphs. Erdös, 
Hajnal, and Shelah [1974] proved among other results that A must contain all cycles 
of length at least g for some g. 
If A\ and A2 are two classes of finite graphs with the property described above, 
is Ai Π A2 also such a class? This question was asked by Erdös [1985]. 
Erdös [1985] asked what the answer would be if "finite (sub)graph" is replaced 
throughout by "countable (sub)graph." Perhaps if A is the set of countable subgraphs 
of any graph with chromatic number K2. there exists for every cardinal κ some graph 
of chromatic number κ so that all its countable subgraphs belong to A. 
The problems above have also been studied by Hajnal and Komjäth [1984]. 
■ 
16.7. 4-CHROMATIC SUBGRAPHS 
Let Gi and G2 be two graphs of uncountable chromatic number. Is there 
a 4-chromatic graph G which is a subgraph of both G\ and G2? 
■ 
The question was asked by Erdös [1985]. 
The similar statement for 2-chromatic graphs is true. Erdös and Hajnal [1966] 
proved that any graph of uncountable chromatic number in fact contains all finite 

Set of Odd Cycle Lengths 
255 
bipartite graphs as subgraphs. The similar statement for 3-chromatic graphs is also 
true by a theorem of Erdös, Hajnal, and Shelah [ 1974], that every graph of uncountable 
chromatic number has odd cycles of all sufficiently large lengths. 
Erdös [1990b] remarked that it is not impossible that 4 can be replaced by X0. 
A. Hajnal proved that 4 cannot be replaced by Xi (see Erdös [1985]). 
■ 
16.8. AVOIDING 5-CYCLES AND LARGE 
BIPARTITE SUBGRAPHS 
Does there exist a graph with uncountable chromatic number not contain-
ing a 5-cycle and not containing a complete bipartite subgraph KN0,X0? 
■ 
This question is due to P. Erdös and A. Hajnal (see Erdös [1975]). 
Hajnal [1971] proved that there is a graph with chromatic number X] that does 
not contain a triangle and also no ^χ,,,κ,,. 
Erdös and Hajnal [1966] proved that every graph with uncountable chromatic 
number contains the complete bipartite graph ΑΓ,,,χ, as a subgraph for every n > 0. 
■ 
16.9. CONNECTIVITY OF SUBGRAPHS 
Is it true that every graph of chromatic number at least K] has a subgraph 
that cannot be disconnected by deletion of a finite set of vertices? 
■ 
The question is due to Erdös and Hajnal [1966], who proved that there is a graph 
of chromatic number X] every subgraph of which can be disconnected by the deletion 
of a countable set of vertices (see also Erdös [1975]). 
Komjäth [1986] proved that every graph of uncountable chromatic number con-
tains an «-connected subgraph of uncountable chromatic number for every finite 
number n. Komjäth [ 1988] also proved that if one asks for a subgraph of uncountable 
chromatic number and of infinite connectivity, then both the positive answer and the 
negative answer are consistent. Komjäth [1988] added that maybe the affirmative 
answer to the question of Erdös and Hajnal is provably true. 
The variation of the problem when "deletion of a finite set of vertices" is re-
placed by "deletion of a finite set of edges" has been attacked by R. Diestel and 
C. Thomassen. This also remains an open problem, and it seems a difficult one 
[personal communication from C. Thomassen in 1993]. 
■ 
16.10. SET OF ODD CYCLE LENGTHS 
Let G be a graph of chromatic number X0- Denote by ri\ < n2 < «3 < ■ ■ · 
the sequence of odd integers n, for which G contains a cycle of length «,. 

256 
Infinite Chromatic Graphs 
Is it true that 
The question is due to P. Erdös and A. Hajnal (see Erdös [1975]). They conjec-
tured that the answer is affirmative. 
Erdös [1990b] suggested that perhaps the upper density 
hm sup 
N 
N 
is in fact positive. 
Erdös [1994] asked if there is a constant c > 0 so that the inequality 
*","**& 
& * ' 
holds, and asked if perhaps it holds with c = ^. Moreover, if mi < m-i < m^ < · ■ · 
is the sequence of integers m, for which G has cycles of length m,·, is it then true that 
1 
v- 1 
limsup-—- > — = 1? 
A similar conjecture of Erdös concerning the set of both even and odd cycle 
lengths in G was studied and solved by Gyärfäs, Komlos, and Szemeredi [1984], 
with further results obtained by Gyarfas, Prömel, Szemeredi, and Voigt [1985] (see 
also Bollobäs [1986]). 
See Erdös and Hajnal [1985] and Erdös [ 1994] for discussions of these and other 
related problems. 
16.11. UNAVOIDABLE CYCLE LENGTHS 
Call an infinite sequence of integers «i < u2 < u3 < · ■ · "unavoidable" if 
every graph with infinite chromatic number must contain a cycle of length 
Uj for somey. Is it possible to characterize all such unavoidable sequences? 
More specifically, is it true that any given sequence u.\ < u2 < «3 < · · ■ 
is unavoidable if and only if it satisfies 
oc 
1 
Can it at least be determined if the sequence (2" : n S: 2) is unavoidable? 

Direct Product 
257 
The first question was discussed by P. Erdös and P. Mihok at a party given by 
J. Nesetfil in Prague in 1982. They considered in particular the sequence (2" : n S: 2), 
the status of which seems to remain open (see Erdös and Hajnal [1985]). The possible 
complete characterization of unavoidable sequences was suggested by Mihok [ 1983a] 
in his doctoral thesis. 
The suggestion of Mihok is partially supported by a result of Bollobäs [1977], 
implying that every infinite arithmetic progression is unavoidable. 
■ 
16.12. COLORING NUMBER 
The coloring number col(G) of a graph G is the smallest cardinal κ 
such that for some well-ordering < of the vertex set of G, the degree 
of every vertex x in the subgraph induced by the vertices y with y :S x 
is strictly less than κ. For cardinals m and n, where m > n, when does 
col(G) = m imply that G contains a subgraph G' (or an induced subgraph) 
of coloring number «? Is this always the case when m and n are finite and 
m = n+ 1? 
■ 
This question was asked by E.C. Milner in connection with the International 
Conference on Combinatorics in Keszthely, Hungary, in July 1993, held in celebration 
of the eightieth birthday of P. Erdös. 
Forcol(G) = n + 1, when n is an integer, there is not necessarily a finite subgraph 
G' of G with col(G') = n. Erdös and Hajnal [1966] proved that if col(G') < n for all 
finite subgraphs G' of G, then col(G) < 2« - 2, and in fact this is the best possible. In 
particular, the theorem of de Bruijn and Erdös [1951] (Theorem 1 in Chapter 1) does 
not hold when replacing the chromatic number by the coloring number. It does not 
hold even if "all finite subgraphs" is replaced by "all countable subgraphs" (we are 
grateful to E.C. Milner [private communication in 1994] for drawing our attention 
to this fact stemming from the paper by Erdös and Hajnal [1966]). Related problems 
in the infinite case have been studied by Erdös and Hajnal [1966, 1971] and Shelah 
[1975a, 1975b]. 
The corresponding question for the chromatic number instead of the coloring 
number has been raised by Galvin [ 1973] (Problem 16.2). This question has a positive 
answer for the case of« s X0 by the theorem of de Bruijn and Erdös. 
■ 
16.13. DIRECT PRODUCT 
The direct product G X H of two graphs G and H is the graph with vertex 
set V(G X H) = V(G) X V(H) and an edge (JC, y)(x', y') G E(G X H) if 
and only if xx' G E(G) and yy' G £(//). 
Does there exist a pair of graphs G and H with x(G) = χ(Η) = Kk+2 and 
X(G XH)<Kk 
for some it > 0? 

258 
Infinite Chromatic Graphs 
Does there exist a pair of graphs G and H for which x(G) = χ(Η) = Χω 
and \(G X H) < Χω, where ω denotes the first infinite ordinal? 
■ 
Both problems were mentioned by Erdös [1985]. 
A. Hajnal proved that \(G X //) is infinite if x(G) and χ(Η) are both infinite 
(see Erdös [1985]). Moreover, Hajnal [1985] proved that if G has infinite chromatic 
number and H has finite chromatic number, then x(G X //) = x(H). 
Hajnal [1985] proved that there are graphs G and H with x(G) = χ(Η) = X*+, 
and x(G X H) = N* for all A: > 0. 
It follows from results by L. Sokoup and by R. Laver and M. Foreman that the 
following statement is consistent, but not provable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory 
extended with the generalized continuum hypothesis: There are graphs G\,Gi with 
X(Gt) = \V(Gj)\ = X2 (i = 1,2) such that*(G| X G2) = X0 (see Hajnal [1985]). 
For finite graphs it is an open problem due to S.T. Hedetniemi, whether there ex-
ists a pair of graphs G and //for which x(G X H) < min{x(G),x(H)} (Problem 11.1). 
■ 
16.14. PARTITION PROBLEM OF GALVIN AND HAJNAL 
If the chromatic number of G is uncountable, does there exist a partition 
V(G) = \JaXa of V(G) into uncountably many subsets, so that every 
induced subgraph G[Xa] has uncountable chromatic number? 
■ 
The question was raised by Hajnal [ 1970]. It is a stronger version of a conjecture 
by F. Galvin proved by Hajnal [1970]: If x(G) > N0> then there exists a partition 
of V(G) into two parts so that the subgraph induced by each part has uncountable 
chromatic number. 
The problem was studied by Komjäth [ 1990], who proved that a negative answer 
is consistent, assuming that the existence of measurable cardinals is consistent (see a 
textbook on large cardinals, e.g., Drake [1974] or Jech [1978]). Thus a proof of the 
affirmative answer to Hajnal's question would also be a proof of the nonexistence of 
measurable cardinals. This would solve a classical open problem in set theory.1 
■ 
16.15. SMALL SUBGRAPHS OF LARGE 
CHROMATIC NUMBER 
Is it consistent that if \V(G)\ = Κω+ι and x(G) = Ni, then G has a sub-
graph H with \V{H)\ = Νω and χ(Η) = Ν, (ω denotes the first infinite 
ordinal)? 
■ 
'it is, however, generally believed that the existence of measurable cardinals is consistent, even though 
the consistency itself is known to be unprovable on the basis of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. 

Bibliography 
259 
The corresponding question with "consistent" replaced with "true" is due to 
P. Erdös and A. Hajnal (see Erdös [1985]). This version of the problem was also 
asked by Shelah [1975a]. However, it was proved by Komjäth [1988] that it is in fact 
consistent that there exists a graph with Κω+1 vertices and chromatic number N|, such 
that every subgraph whose vertex set has strictly smaller cardinality is of countable 
chromatic number. Komjäth noted that the question above remains open. 
Many similar questions were treated by Erdös and Hajnal [1968] and discussed 
by Erdös [1985].

17.1. LIST-COLORING BIPARTITE GRAPHS 
Determine the smallest number n{k) of vertices in a bipartite graph G 
of list-chromatic number exceeding k, for & s 2. That is, no matter how 
lists of colors of size k are assigned to the vertices of G, it is impossible 
to (properly) vertex-color G such that every vertex receives a color from 
its list. 
■ 
The problem is due to Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor [1979]. 
Let m(k) denote the minimum number of edges possible in a 3-chromatic k-
uniform hypergraph, that is, the minimum number of k-sets in a family of sets not 
having property B (see Problem 15.1). Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor [1979] proved that 
m(k) + 2 < n(k) < 2m(k). 
It is known that m(3) = 7, m(A) < 23, m{5) < 51, and that in general m(k) < k22k+] 
(see Problem 15.1). However, the order of magnitude of m{k), and hence of n(k), has 
not been determined. 
Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor [1979] observed that «(2) = 6 = 2m(2), and they 
remarked ".. .although it is most likely that «(3) = 14, it would be quite a sur-
prise if n(k) = 2m(k) were to persist for large k." Indeed, Hanson, MacGillivray, 
and Toft [1994] confirmed the exact value of n(3) = 14. Moreover, they noted that 
n(k) s kn{k — 2) + 2k, which does not improve n(k) s 2m(k) when using the best 
known bounds for m{k) for k odd (see Abbott and Hanson [1969]). It is, however, an 
improvement for k even. In particular, using this bound one obtains n(4) s 40 and 
n(6) < 304, compared to the best known bounds 2m(4) < 46 and 2m(6) £ 360 (see 
Seymour [1974a] and Toft [1975a]). List-chromatic numbers of complete bipartite 
graphs with one side much larger than the other were obtained by Hoffman and 
Johnson [1993]. 
For graphs of chromatic numbers at least 3 the corresponding problem has not 
yet been studied, as far as we know.

17.2. LIST-COLORING THE UNION OF GRAPHS 
Let G and H be two graphs on the same set of vertices. If G is ^-choosable 
and H is /-choosable, is their union W-choosable? 
■ 
As pointed out by N. Alon [personal communication in 1994J this question is 
a special case of a question of Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor [ 1979J. A graph is (a : b)-
choosable if for any assignment of lists of length a to the vertices of the graph it is 
possible to choose a ft-subset of the list for each vertex while keeping the chosen 
^-subsets disjoint for adjacent vertices. A conjecture of Erdös, Rubin, and Taylor 
[1979] states that if G is (a : ft)-choosable then it is also (am : fern)-choosable for 
every positive integer m. If true, then G being ^-choosable (i.e., (k : l)-choosable) 
would imply that G is (kl : /)-choosable. This together with H being /-choosable 
easily implies that G U H is W-choosable. 
The existence of a function f(k, /) such that G U H is f(k, /)-choosable was 
proved by N. Alon [personal communication in 1994]. It follows from the theorem 
of Alon [1993], stating that if a graph is ^-choosable, then there is an upper bound 
d(k) on its average degree depending only on k. The value of d(k) obtained by Alon 
(by a probabilistic proof) is 4(*) log ( 2(k
k )), which is superexponential in k. 
A closely related question is the following. Let G be ^-choosable and let GU2] 
denote the graph obtained from G by replacing each vertex by two independent 
vertices. Find a best possible upper bound for X((G[f2\) in terms of k. If G is bipartite, 
is G[h] then k2-choosable? Note that in the latter case G[li\ is the union of two graphs 
each consisting of two disjoint copies of G. Of course G and GU2] have the same 
chromatic number, and the question here is how much their list-chromatic numbers 
can differ. 
Alon [1993] noted that his result mentioned above, combined with a polynomial 
algorithm for the coloring number (see Section 1.3), implies the existence of a function 
g and a polynomial algorithm that for a given input graph G finds a number s, such 
that the list-chromatic number xe(G) lies between s and g(s). Alon [1993] remarked 
that no similar result seems known for the usual chromatic number (Problem 10.2). 
■ 
17.3. COCHROMATIC NUMBER 
The cochromatic number z(G) of a graph G is the smallest number of 
sets into which the vertex set V(G) can be partitioned so that each set 
is either independent or induces a complete graph. Is there a constant 
c > 0 with the property that if x(G) = n then G has a subgraph H where 
z(H) >c-n/\ogrii 
■ 
The question was asked by J. Gimbel at the Julius Petersen Graph Theory 
Conference at Hindsgavl, Denmark, in July 1990 (see Gimbel [1992]). 

Star Chromatic Number 
263 
Erdös, Gimbel, and Straight [1990] considered the problem of bounding the 
cochromatic number z(G) in terms of x(G) when the size w(G) of a largest complete 
subgraph in G is bounded by a constant. They proved that if w(G) < /, then z(G) > 
X(G) — r(t, t), where the Ramsey number r(s, t) denotes the smallest positive integer 
n such that every graph with n vertices contains either a complete s-graph or an 
independent set of t vertices. Lesniak and Straight [1977] proved that if w(G) < 3, 
then z(G) = x(G), except for G = K2. Erdös, Gimbel, and Straight [1990] proved 
that if w(G) < 4, then z(G) s x(G) — 1, except for G = #3, and they conjectured that 
if w(G) < 5 and z(G) > 3, then z{G) s x(G) — 2. The conjecture is best possible, 
since there exist graphs G that satisfy w(G) = 4, x(G) = 6, and z(G) = 3, as shown 
by Erdös, Gimbel, and Straight [1990]. 
The cochromatic number was first introduced by Lesniak and Straight [1977], 
and it has also been studied by Straight [1979, 1980], Gimbel [1984, 1986], Broere 
and Burger [1986, 1989], Gimbel and Straight [1987], Erdös, Gimbel, and Kratsch 
[1992], and Erdös and Gimbel [1993]. 
■ 
17.4. STAR CHROMATIC NUMBER 
Let G be a graph, and let k and d be positive integers with k > 2d. A 
(k, <f)-coloring of G is an assignment φ : V(G) —♦{1,2 
k} of colors 
to the vertices of G in such a way that d ^ |φ(«) — φ(ν)\ < k — d holds 
for every edge uv. The star chromatic number is defined as 
X*(G) = inf{*/rf : G has a (M)-coloring}. 
Is it possible to characterize the 3-colorable graphs G that satisfy x*{G) — 
χ(β)Ί Is it possible to characterize the graphs G that are critical and satisfy 
X*(G) = x(G)l Is there a triangle-free 5-critical such example? A graph 
G is called *-perfect if χ*{Η) = χ{Η) for every induced subgraph H of 
G. Is such a graph perfect? Is every Berge graph *-perfect? 
■ 
The star chromatic number was introduced and studied by Vince [1988], who 
noted that the Petersen graph is an example with χ* = χ = 3, and that the Mycielski 
graph is a critical graph with χ* = χ, A usual ^-coloring is equivalent to a (k, 1)-
coloring as defined above, and thus χ* < χ holds. In fact ω ^ χ* < χ, where ω 
denotes the size of a largest complete subgraph. 
Vince [1988] showed that in the definition of x*(G), the "inf" can be replaced 
by "min" taken over all k s |V(G)|. 
The star chromatic number was studied also by Bondy and Hell [1990], by Zhu 
[1992], by Guichard [1993], who proved that it is in general W-hard to decide if 
X*(G) = x(G), and by Abbott and Zhou [1993a, 1994], who proved the existence 
of triangle-free graphs G with x*(G) = x(G) = k for all i s 3 , and asked the third 
question above. 

264 
Miscellaneous Problems 
A perfect graph is *-perfect, and a *-perfect graph is a Berge graph, hence 
the affirmative answers to both of the last two questions would be equivalent to an 
affirmative answer to the strong perfect graph conjecture (see Section 1.6, Problem 
8.1, and also Problem 8.2). 
■ 
17.5. HARMONIOUS CHROMATIC NUMBER 
A harmonious ^-coloring of a graph G is a coloring of the vertices of G 
with k colors so that adjacent vertices receive different colors, and for 
all i,j with 1 < / < 7 < & at most one edge joins a vertex of color / to a 
vertex of color 7. The harmonious chromatic number xH(G) is the smallest 
k such that G has a harmonious ^-coloring. 
Let n, t > 0 be integers and let TnJ denote the complete n-ary tree with 
t levels; that is, the vertices of T„,, are partitioned into t levels so that 
level 1 contains a single vertex, each vertex in level /, for 1 < / < t, is 
adjacent to exactly one vertex in level / — 1, and each vertex in level 
m, for 1 s m < t, is adjacent to n vertices in level m + 1. What is the 
harmonious chromatic number of T„ ,? 
■ 
The harmonious chromatic number was introduced by Frank, Harary, and Plan-
tholt [1982], and independently by Hopcroft and Krishnamoorthy [1983] in a slightly 
different version, allowing that two adjacent vertices are colored with the same color. It 
was studied in the version above by Lee and Mitchem [1987] and by Mitchem [1989], 
who mentioned that the value of XH{T„,,) does not seem known in general. Mitchem 
[1989] solved the simplest nontrivial case by proving that ΧΗ(Τ„ΊΙ) = \\{n + 1) . 
The harmonious chromatic number was also studied by Miller and Pritikin [ 1991 ] 
andbyKundrik[1992]. 
■ 
17.6. 
ACHROMATIC NUMBER 
Let G be a graph. The achromatic number *I/(G) is defined as the largest 
number k for which the vertices of G can be colored with k colors so that 
for all 1 s i < j < k at least one edge of G joins a vertex of color / to a 
vertex of color 7. Is it possible to characterize all graphs with [z\ edges 
and achromatic number « for « > 2? 
■ 
The achromatic number was introduced and first studied by Harary, Hedetniemi, 
and Prins [1967] and by Harary and Hedetniemi [1970]. The problem was posed 
by Farber, Hahn, Hell, and Miller [1986]. An achromatic number </»'(G) for edge 
coloring was defined by Bouchet [1978] and also studied by Jamison [1989]. Both 
considered the problem of determining i//'(G) for complete graphs G. 

Multiplicative Graphs 
265 
■ 
17.7. SUBCHROMATIC NUMBER 
Let G be a graph. The subchromatic number Xs(G) is the smallest num-
ber k such that the vertices of G can be partitioned into k disjoint sets 
X\,Xi,... 
,Xk, where each induced subgraph G[X,] is the disjoint union 
of complete graphs. Given n > 0, what is the maximum subchromatic 
number S(n) of all graphs on n vertices? 
■ 
Subchromatic numbers were introduced by Mynhardt and Broere [1985] as a 
special case of a more general concept, and studied by Albertson, Jamison, Hedet-
niemi, and Locke [1989], who asked this question. Albertson, Jamison, Hedetniemi, 
and Locke [1989] asked for a characterization of graphs G with xs(G) - 2 and gave 
many partial results. These results seem to indicate that a straightforward characteri-
zation should not be expected. 
■ 
17.8. MULTIPLICATIVE GRAPHS 
A homomorphism/ from a graph G to a graph F is a mapping/ : V(G) —* 
V(F) such that every edge uv of G is mapped to an edge f(u)f(v) 
of F. 
The direct product G X H of two graphs G and H is the graph with vertex 
set V(G X H) = V(G) X V(H) and edge set E(G XH) = {(x1.y1Xx2.y2) : 
X\X2 (Ξ E(G) ana yxy2 e £(//)}. 
Is it possible to characterize the graphs M that are multiplicative, that 
is, have the property that for any G and H, if there is a homomorphism 
/ : G X H —» M, then there is also a homomorphism from at least one of 
the graphs G and H to M? More precisely: Is there a polynomial algorithm 
for recognizing multiplicative graphs? 
■ 
Multiplicative graphs seem first studied by Nesetfil and Pultr [1978]. The ques-
tion above was asked in this general setting by Albertson [1987]. The statement 
that every complete graph if* is multiplicative is equivalent to a conjecture due to 
Hedetniemi [1966] (see Problem 11.1), that for all graphs G and H, 
Note that there is a homomorphism from G to K^ if and only if G can be it-
colored. It is easy to see that Hedetniemi's conjecture is true for k < 2, and it was 
proved by El-Zahar and Sauer [1985] for k = 3. For k s 4 the conjecture remains 
unsolved. 

266 
Miscellaneous Problems 
The theorem of El-Zahar and Sauer [1985] was extended by Häggkvist, Hell, 
Miller, and Neumann-Lara [1988], who proved that all cycles are multiplicative. 
Zhu [1992] conjectured that if Gf is the graph with vertex set {0,1,.... k - 1}, 
where; and y are joined by an edge if and only ifminfli — j\,k — \i — j\} ^ d,thenGf 
is multiplicative for all d, k > 0 with 2d < k. He showed that this would be equivalent 
to replacing χ by χ* in the conjecture of Hedetniemi [1966], where χ* denotes the 
star chromatic number defined by Vince [ 1988] (see Problem 17.4). 
Albertson [1987] remarked that results by Hedrlin and Pultr [1965] and Hell 
[1974] imply the existence of classes of graphs that are not multiplicative. 
A question asked by Nesetril and Pultr [1978] appears to stand open: What is the 
smallest nonmultiplicative graph? 
■ 17.9. REDUCIBLE GRAPH PROPERTIES 
A property P of graphs is hereditary if, whenever the graph G has property 
P, and H is a subgraph of G, then H also has property P. C denotes 
the lattice of all hereditary properties ordered by inclusion (see also 
Section 1.10). 
For PUP2 G £ the property P, · P2 is defined as follows. G G P, · P2 
if and only if V(G) can be partitioned into two sets Vi and V2 such that 
G[Vj] £ Pi for / = 1,2, where G[V,] denotes the subgraph of G induced 
by Vi. A property R = P, ■ P2, where PitP2 
G C\{0}, 
is said to be 
reducible, and P\ and P2 are said to divide R. 
Is the factorization of every property in £ into irreducible properties 
unique? Equivalently, is every irreducible property Q also "prime," that 
is, whenever Q divides P\ · P2, does it follow that Q divides Pi or P{] 
For a given hereditary property P, a reducible property R = P\ · P2 is 
called a "minimal reducible bound" for P if P C R and there is no 
reducible property R' C R satisfying P C R'. What are the minimal re-
ducible bounds for the class of planar graphs? 
■ 
The first question is due to P. Mihok [personal communication in 1993], who 
remarked that the answer is probably negative. The property of being ^-colorable 
has factorization Ok, where O denotes the property of not having edges, and it is not 
difficult to see that this factorization is unique for all k s 1. 
The second question was asked by P. Mihok and B. Toft at the International Con-
ference on Combinatorics held in Keszthely, Hungary, 1993, dedicated to 
P. Erdös on his eightieth birthday. Mihok [1993] proved that the class of outer-
planar graphs, where each member has an embedding in the plane such that every 
vertex lies on the boundary of the infinite face, has exactly two minimal reducible 
bounds. 

Γ-Colorings 
267 
■ 
17.10. 
Γ-COLORINGS 
Let G be a graph and let T be a finite set of nonnegative integers with 0 E. 
T. For a positive integer n, an «-tuple Γ-coloring of G is an assignment S of 
«-sets of nonnegative integers to the vertices of G, so that if i GE S(x) and 
j G S(y) for any edge xy E E(G), then i - j & T. Define sp£(G) as the 
minimum difference, taken over all «-tuple Γ-colorings 5 of G, between 
the largest number and the smallest number in the union (J*ev(G) $(χ) °f 
all the assigned sets. The number sp£(G) is called the «-tuple Γ-span of G. 
For fixed numbers k > 1, « > 0, r > 0 and with T = {0,1 ,...,/■}, is it 
true that 
{sp£(G) : X(G) = *} = {(r + 1)(* - 1) + 2(#i - 1) 
(n + r)k - (r + 1)} 
always holds? 
■ 
Füredi, Griggs, and Kleitman [ 1989] conjectured that the answer to the question is 
affirmative. They proved, and Tesman [1989] did so independently, that the following 
inclusion holds: 
{sp£(G): x(G) = k] C {(r + 1)(* - 1) + 2(« - 1),...,(« + r)k - (r + 1)}, 
and they proved that equality holds when n — 2. 
It was remarked by Fiiredi, Griggs, and Kleitman that the truth of their conjecture 
for r = 0 (i.e., for T - {0}) would imply the theorem of Loväsz [1978], conjectured 
by Kneser [1955], on the chromatic numbers of Kneser graphs (see Problem 9.13). 
An elementary proof of Loväsz's theorem is not known; thus it would seem that 
an easy proof of the conjecture should not be expected. The Kneser graph Gt(n), 
where n ^ / > 0, is denned as the graph with vertex set V(G,(n)) equal to the set 
of f-subsets of the set {1,2 
n}, with two ί-subsets A and B adjacent if and only 
if A Π B = 0 . The more general graph Gt(n,d), where n > / > 0 and d > 0, has 
the same vertex set as G,(n), but A and B are adjacent in Gi(n,d) if and only if 
minfla - b\ : a G A,b E B) > d. In particular, G,(n, 1) = G,(n). Fiiredi, Griggs, 
and Kleitman conjectured 
X(G,(d(k- 
1) + 2 ί - 1,<ί))>* 
for all t, d, k > 0, and they proved that this would follow from their conjecture on 
n-tuple T-colorings. For d = 1 this last conjecture is the theorem of Loväsz. 
Bollobäs and Thomason [1979] introduced the problem of coloring the vertices 
of a graph with equally sized sets, subject to the condition that the sets assigned to 
any two adjacent vertices must be disjoint, and they observed the connection with 
Loväsz's theorem on Kneser graphs. 

268 
Miscellaneous Problems 
In the special case (k,n,r) = (3,2,1), Fiiredi, Griggs, and Kleitman found a 
complete characterization in terms of homomorphisms. They proved that if G is 3-
chromatic, then sp^ 1}(G) = 6 if and only if G is homomorphic to a cycle of length 
5; otherwise, sp^0 ,j(G) = 7. A homomorphism from a graph G to a graph H is a map 
/ : V(G) — V(H) so that if xy G E(G) then f(x)f(y) E £(//). If such an / exists, G 
is said to be homomorphic to H. Note that any usual ^-coloring of G is equivalent to 
a homomorphism from G to the complete £-graph. See also Problem 10.8. 
An «-tuple Γ-coloring with n = 1 is called a T-coloring. In the simplest case 
T = {0}, a Γ-coloring of G is the same as a usual coloring of G. The concept 
was introduced by Hale [1980], when studying the practical problem of assign-
ing a transmitting frequency to each of a number of radio and television stations 
Χχ,Χϊ,... ,Xm. Such an assignment must be done subject to the condition that any 
pair of stations geographically close enough to interfere with each other should trans-
mit signals that differ sufficiently in frequency. A graph G is defined with vertex set 
V(G) = {X\ ,Xj 
Xm} and with an edge between any pair of stations that are mu-
tually close. T corresponds to the set of so-called "disallowed channel separations," 
and any T-coloring of G corresponds to an assignment of a frequency to each station 
as desired. 
For further results and references, see the comprehensive survey on T-colorings 
and their generalizations by Roberts [1991]. Results on T-colorings were also ob-
tained by Liu [1992]. A generalization called "list T-coloring" has been introduced 
and studied by Tesman [1989, 1993]. 
■ 
17.11. GAME CHROMATIC NUMBER 
Let G be a graph and let k be a positive integer. The following two-person 
game is played on G: Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice having 
the first move. Both players know G and k from the beginning. A move 
consists in choosing a vertex v from G that has not yet been assigned 
a color and assigning to v a color from {1,2,... ,k} distinct from the 
colors assigned previously (by any of the two players) to the vertices in 
G adjacent to v. The game stops with Alice the winner if after \V(G)\ 
moves G has been colored. Bob is declared the winner if at some point 
of the game there is a vertex that cannot be assigned a color; that is, the 
vertex is already adjacent to vertices of all the k different colors. 
The game chromatic number xK(G) is defined as the smallest k for which 
Alice has a winning strategy. Clearly, 
X(G) s Xg(G) =£ W(G)\. 
What is the best possible upper bound for the game chromatic number of 
a planar graph? 
■ 

Harary and Tu/.a's Coloring Games 
269 
The game chromatic number was introduced by Bodlaender [1991], who proved 
that the maximum game chromatic number of all trees is either 4 or 5. Faigle, Kern, 
Kierstead, and Trotter [1993] proved that the game chromatic number of any tree is 
at most 4. The question was asked by Kierstead and Trotter [1993], who proved that 
7 < max xg(G) < 33, 
G planar 
where the upper bound was proved using the four-color theorem (see Section 1.2). 
The same arguments except using Heawood's weaker five-color theorem would give 
an upper bound of 41. Moreover, Kierstead and Trotter remarked that the lower bound 
can be improved to 8. For outerplanar graphs (i.e., graphs with an embedding in the 
plane such that all vertices lie on the boundary of a single face) Kierstead and Trotter 
gave the bounds 
6 < 
max 
xg{G) < 8. 
G outerplanar 
Faigle, Kern, Kierstead, and Trotter [1993] have shown that there is no upper 
bound for xg(G) as a function of x(G). In fact, there exist bipartite graphs of arbitrarily 
high game chromatic numbers. However, Kierstead and Trotter [1993] proved that 
there exists a function / such that if G does not contain a subdivision of the complete 
«-graph K„ as a subgraph, then xg(G) ^ /(«). In particular, for any surface S, there is 
a smallest number ^(S) such that every graph embeddable on S has game chromatic 
number at most xg(S). 
■ 
17.12. HARARY AND TUZA'S COLORING GAMES 
Let G be a graph and let k be a positive integer. The two following two-
person games, Achievement and Avoidance, can be played on G: Alice 
and Bob alternate turns, with Alice having the first move. Both players 
know G and k from the beginning. A move consists in choosing a vertex 
v from G that has not yet been assigned a color and assigning to v a color 
from {1,2,..., k} distinct from the colors assigned previously (by any of 
the two players) to the vertices in G adjacent to v. The player who makes 
the last move is the winner in the Achievement game, but loses in the 
Avoidance game. 
Characterize those graphs G and integers k for which Alice has a winning 
strategy in Achievement, and those G and k for which she has a winning 
strategy in Avoidance. 
■ 
The Avoidance and Achievement coloring games were studied by Harary and 
Tuza [1993]. They proved for the Petersen graph and 1 < fc < 3 that Alice has a

Miscellaneous Problems 
winning strategy in Achievement if and only if k = 1 or k = 2, and that she has a 
winning strategy in Avoidance if and only if k = 1 or k = 3. They also analyzed the 
games for paths and cycles in the case k = 2. 
If the number of colors is greater than the maximum degree A(G), then obviously 
the winner is determined only by the parity of the number of vertices in G. Harary 
and Tuza [1993] drew attention to three particular nontrivial cases: k - A(G), k — 
X(G), and k = 1, and they remarked that it remains an open problem to analyze the 
Achievement and Avoidance games on paths and cycles when k = 1.

17.13. COLORING EXTENSION GAME 
Let m, n, and k be integers with 3 ^ k < m < 2k and £ < n. Two players, 
the "mapmaker" and the "explorer," play the following game. First the 
explorer presents n independent vertices H and the mapmaker responds 
with an m-coloring of H. Then the explorer presents a ^-colorable ex-
tension Hi of H (i.e., H\ contains H as a subgraph), and the mapmaker 
responds with an /n-coloring of H that can be extended to an /«-coloring 
of//,. Then the explorer presents a ^-colorable extension H2 of Hu and 
the mapmaker responds with an m-coloring of H that can be extended to 
an m-coloring of H2. And so on. The explorer wins if the mapmaker is 
forced to use all possible m-colorings of H in this process (not consider-
ing a renaming of colors as a different coloring). For which values of m, 
n, and k does the explorer have a winning strategy? 
■ 
This problem is due to Beigel and Gasarch [1991]. They proved that for 3 ^ 
k = m the explorer always has a winning strategy. This also follows from a result of 
Müller [1975, 1979], even if the explorer may only use graphs where all cycles are 
long. The remarkable result of Müller is the following. 
Theorem (Müller [1975,1979]). 
Let H be an independent set of vertices and let 
P\,P2,...,Pr 
denote different partitions ofH into at most k classes (k >: 3). Then 
there exists a k-chromatic graph G with H C V (G) such that G has precisely r different 
k-colorings φ,, <P2> ■. ·, <fV (where colorings obtained by renaming or permuting the 
colors are considered the same), and for all i the restriction of φ, to H partitions H 
into color classes like Pi. Moreover for any given i, there exists such a G in which all 
cycles have length at least i and any two vertices ofH have distance at least I. 
On the other hand, Beigel and Gasarch [1991] remarked that it follows from 
techniques of Bean [1976] that for m = 2k, the mapmaker has a winning strategy. It 
seems unknown where the situation changes between k and 2k. 

Winning Hex

17.14. WINNING HEX 
Let G{m, n) be a planar graph consisting of an m X n grid with a complete 
set of parallel diagonals added, say all the diagonals directed northeast. 
More formally, G(m, n) has mn vertices {a, b), where a and b are integers 
satisfying 1 < a < m and 1 < b < «. The vertices {a, b) and (c, d) are 
joined by an edge in G(rn, n) if and only if either (a — c and b — d = 
± 1) or (a - c = ±1 and b = d) or {a - c = b - d = ±1). The graph 
G{m, n) may be thought of as the planar dual of an m X n diamond-shaped 
board of hexagons (disregarding, when forming the dual, the infinite face 
surrounding the board). 
The positional game Hex is played on the "board" G(m, n). Two players 
alternately select a previously unselected vertex of G(m, n). The goal of 
the first player (respectively, the second player) is to complete a path in 
G{m, n) joining the two horizontal sides (respectively, the two vertical 
sides). Find a winning strategy for the first player when playing Hex on 
G(m, n), at least for small values of n. The case G( 11,11) of the standard 
Hex board would be of particular interest. 
■ 
Hex was invented in 1942 by Piet Hein while contemplating the four-color prob-
lem, and independently in 1948 by John F. Nash (see Gardner [1957,1959]). Gardner 
[1957] wrote "It is something of an occasion these days when someone invents a 
mathematical game that is both new and interesting. Such a game is Hex, introduced 
15 years ago at Niels Bohr's Institute of Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen. It may 
become one of the most widely played and thoughtfully analyzed mathematical games 
of the century'.' 
Hex may be thought of as a variation of the positional games played on a 
hypergraph (see Problem 15.7). The hypergraph H{m,n) in question has the same 
vertex set as G(m, n) and two sets of edges A and B, where the edges of A (respectively, 
B) correspond to the vertex sets of paths joining the horizontal sides (respectively, 
vertical sides). (Note that the vertex sets of paths joining opposite corners are in 
both A and B.) The complete bipartite graph #|^|,|s| is not vertex list-colorable when 
associating with the vertices in one side the sets in A as lists, and in the other side 
the sets in B. This coloring statement is equivalent to the Ramsey-type statement that 
if the vertices of G{m, n) are partitioned into two classes, then either there is an edge 
in A with all vertices in the first class or there is an edge in B with all vertices in the 
second class. In particular, this implies that Hex cannot end in a draw. Interestingly, 
the fact that Hex cannot end in a draw has been shown by Gale [1979] equivalent to 
Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. 
Since Hex is finite there is always a winning strategy for the first or for the second 
player. In the symmetric cases when m = n it cannot be a disadvantage to start, hence 
there is a winning strategy for the first player. It seems that explicit winning strategies 
have been found only for n ^ 5 (see Gardner [1959]). It may, of course, be possible 

272 
Miscellaneous Problems 
that winning strategies can be described in quite simple terms without the strategy 
being practical. For example, we do not know if the following strategy always works: 
Select a vertex contained in the largest number of "good" paths not containing any 
of the vertices already selected by the opponent. 
Algorithmic aspects of Hex type games on graphs in general were considered 
by Even and Tarjan [1975]. They proved that the problem to determine which player 
has a winning strategy in a given position of the game on a given graph is PSPACE-
complete. Reisch [1981] subsequently proved that in fact usual n X n Hex is PSPACE-
complete. Thus if the problem to determine which player has a winning strategy in 
a given position on an n X n Hex board is solvable in polynomial time, then any 
problem solvable in polynomial space is solvable in polynomial time as well. This is 
considered unlikely (see Garey and Johnson [1979] for an introduction to the class 
PSPACE, and to PSPACZ?-complete decision problems). 
A similar game played on the edge set of a graph is due to C.E. Shannon and is 
called Shannon's Switching Game. Given a graph G and two distinguished vertices u 
and v of G, two players alternately select an edge, one player with the goal of forming 
a path in G from u to v, the other player with the goal of collecting enough edges that 
their removal would destroy all such paths. Lehman [1964] generalized this game 
from graphs to matroids and gave a complete characterization of the instances of 
the general game that are won for either player, including an efficient method for 
determining the best move in any possible situation. A solution of Lehman's version 
of Shannon's Switching Game based on the matroid intersection theorem of Edmonds 
[1965a] was presented in Chapter 19 of the book on matroid theory by Welsh [1976]. 
A graph-theoretical solution of Shannon's Switching Game was given by Bruno and 
Weinberg [1970J. 
Further variations of Hex have been described by Gardner [1975], Evans [1974, 
1976], and Alpern and Beck [1991J.
