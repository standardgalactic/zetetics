CHAPTER 14
Radioactivity and the Earth’s Interior
14.1
Historical Note
The discussion in Fermi’s notes of the density in the Earth’s
interior is very short, scarcely half a page.
However, the
brief summary notes of the Sixth Washington Conference on
Theoretical Physics show this to be a subject that interested
Fermi greatly at the time these notes were written and one
in which he was regarded as an expert.
The yearly three-day Washington Conferences on Theo-
retical Physics began in 1935. They were the brainchild of
the physicist and, later, cosmologist Russian refugee George
Gamow, then a recent arrival in the United States. Aided in
their organization by fellow refugee Hungarian Edward Teller
and the Carnegie Institution’s Merle Tuve, they loosely mod-
eled the meetings on the annual gatherings hosted by the
eminent Danish physicist Niels Bohr in Copenhagen during
which a small group of physicists gathered for informal dis-

198

cussions not marked by an oﬃcial record of the proceedings.
One way in which Washington diﬀered from Copenhagen
was that a topic for discussion was chosen each year and
the group attending was constituted with this in mind. The
Washington meetings were a great success from the start, in
part because they provided an informal atmosphere for Amer-
ican physicists to become acquainted with recent emigres such
as Gamow and Teller.
The 1938 conference, with topic of “Stellar Energy and
Nuclear Processes,” is notable for drawing the leading nu-
clear physicist Hans Bethe into applying his expertise to as-
trophysics. The 1939 conference, whose topic was “Low Tem-
perature Physics and Superconductivity,” is best remembered
for the organizers’ decision to abandon the planned schedule
and have the ﬁrst two talks be on nuclear ﬁssion, a discovery
that had been announced only weeks earlier. The impact of
the talks was magniﬁed by the universal respect for the ﬁrst
two speakers, Niels Bohr and Enrico Fermi.
14.2
The Sixth Washington Conference on The-
oretical Physics
The chosen topic for 1940 was “The Interior of the Earth.”
Though, as stated earlier, proceedings were not published, a
brief summary of the discussions was issued, giving us some
idea of what transpired. The ﬁrst day’s discussions, centering
on the physical state and composition of the Earth’s interior,
were introduced and led by Fermi. This was a mark of both
his interest and expertise in the subject.
Fermi began by
asserting that if electrons could be treated as moving inde-
pendently, the pressure-volume relation could be dealt with
by statistical reasoning, but of a very diﬀerent sort than is

14.2. THE SIXTH WASHINGTON CONFERENCE

used at normal pressures, densities, and temperatures. It was
known that the center of the Earth had a mass density of ap-
proximately 12 g/cm3, and was composed predominantly of
iron.
Fermi was interested in the question of whether the
pressure there could be explained by assuming that the iron
atoms were completely stripped of their electrons, and that
the electrons formed a free gas obeying what is now called
“Fermi-Dirac” statistics. If the temperature is very low, this
is a completely quantum mechanical regime. For particles of
mass m and number density ρ, the pressure of an ideal Fermi
gas is (Landau and Lifshitz 1980)
P = π(9π)1/3
5me
ℏ2ρ5/3,
(14.1)
where ℏis Planck’s constant divided by 2π. Using a mass den-
sity for the Earth of 12 g/cm3, and assuming the composition
is 100% iron, the density of electrons is
ρ = 3.37 × 1024 electrons/cm3.
For electrons stripped from the iron nuclei, Fermi’s suggestion
was to assume they form an ideal Fermi gas, in which case
Eq. (14.1) can be used to compute the pressure. Using the
known values of ℏand the electron mass, this gives
Pearth−center = 1.7 × 108Patmosphere.
This is much higher than the estimate found by Fermi as
described in Sec. (2.3). Fermi correctly concluded that the
center of the Earth is not an ideal Fermi gas of electrons.
However, in the realm of astrophysics, such gases do occur
inside white dwarf stars. Fermi then went on to give esti-
mates of the melting point of iron at such pressures on the
assumption that a solid melts when the thermal vibrations of
its atoms reach a certain fraction of its interatomic distance.

Such questions are not discussed in Fermi’s lecture notes.
We have included this aside to show how involved Fermi was
in geophysics questions at the time of the lectures.
14.3
Estimates of the Earth’s
Interior Density
There is a long history of attempting to describe the Earth’s
potential energy by models of the planet’s shape and density
distribution. The items of data that were used, most of them
discussed earlier in these notes, are: (1) total mass; (2) ellip-
ticity of the meridian; (3) diﬀerence of moments of inertia;
and (4) density at surface. Many analytic parameterizations
of the Earth’s density were given over the years. The reader
may recall that in Sec. (2.3), Fermi wrote down a simple for-
mula for ρ(r) in Eq. (2.38)). Two nineteenth-century exam-
ples, the ﬁrst by Edouard Roche and the second by Friedrich
Helmhert (Brush 1996) are presented below, with ρ measured
in g/cm3 and Re the Earth’s radius. Roche’s formula is
ρ = ρ0[1 −βr2/R2
e],
(14.2)
where ρ0 = 10.1, β = 0.764, and Helmhert’s formula is
ρ = ρ0[1 −β1r2/R2
e + β2r4/R4
e],
(14.3)
where ρ0 = 11, β1 = 1.04, β2 = 0.275.
Such parameterizations assume that the Earth’s density
varies smoothly, as if there were no discontinuities in its chem-
ical composition. Such is not the case as is seen by the abrupt
change in the impedances1 of seismic waves that takes place
1The impedance I of a seismic wave of velocity v in a medium of
density ρ, is I = ρv.

at a depth of approximately 2900 m below sea level. Known
as the Gutenberg discontinuity, so named after the late Ger-
man geophysicist Beno Gutenberg, this corresponds to the
boundary between the Earth’s solid mantle and its liquid core.
Fermi also quotes data showing the rise in density in g/cm3
to be linear from a value of 3.4 at a depth of 60 km to one of
4.7 at 1200 km and again linear from 4.7 at 2450 km to 5.0
at 2900 km, the point of the Gutenberg discontinuity (Brush
1996). From there until the Earth’s center, which lies at a
depth of 6371 km, he quotes a constant value of 11.0 g/cm3.
This, as noted earlier, is less than the modern value of the
density of the Earth in the inner core, 12.0 −13.0 g/cm3.
14.4
Early Estimates of the Age of the Earth
The discovery of radioactivity near the turn of the twentieth
century had a profound and immediate eﬀect on geophysics,
most notably on the ongoing debate of the Earth’s age. Early
estimates of this number, principally those of Lord Kelvin,
followed from calculations of heat conduction and were based
on observed temperature gradients near the Earth’s surface.
Depending on the assumptions made, the number obtained
varied from twenty million years to upwards of a hundred
million years, insuﬃcient to account for the observed time of
geological changes and certainly too short for the evolution of
species by natural selection proposed by Charles Darwin and
Alfred Wallace. Radioactivity showed that highly signiﬁcant
and previously unaccounted sources of heat were likely to be
present in the Earth’s crust and that, as has proved the case,
any calculation needed to take into account these new sources
(Jackson 2006).

CHAPTER 14. RADIOACTIVITY
14.5
Radioactive Decay Equation
Within a relatively short time, the work of Lord Ruther-
ford and others determined that radioactive decay was due
to the spontaneous disintegration of atomic nuclei and could
be characterized by the emission of alpha, beta, and gamma
rays (Cook 1973). These were respectively due to a nucleus
emitting a helium nucleus, an electron, or a photon. It was
quickly seen that in all cases the rate of decay was simply pro-
portional to N, the number of nuclei present in the original
sample,
dN/dt = −λN,
(14.4)
where λ was known as the decay constant. Accordingly the
number of daughter nuclei grows as
dN1/dt = +λN.
(14.5)
The solution to Eq. (14.4 )is
N(t) = N(0) exp(−λt).
(14.6)
The half-life of the decaying nucleus, T1/2, is the time in which
N(t) is reduced to half its original value. It is simply given
by
exp(−λT1/2) = 1/2
(14.7)
so that λT1/2 = ln 2.
14.6
Heat by Radioactivity within the Earth
It is believed that radioactivity is responsible for approxi-
mately half of the 47 Tw (1 Tw = 1012 watts) ﬂowing to the
surface from the Earth’s interior, the other half being pri-
mordial heat generated by a variety of causes during Earth’s

14.6. RADIOACTIVITY WITHIN THE EARTH
203
formation. While this amount of heat is only 0.027 % of the
173,000 Tw from insolation, the latter only penetrates a few
tens of centimeters into the Earth. Primordial heat and ra-
dioactivity are responsible for observed geological processes
such as plate tectonics and volcanic activity.
The key radioactive elements are thorium; the two isotopes
of uranium; and the rare isotope of potassium, 40K. This last
isotope constitutes some 0.012% of the potassium found in
nature and decays with a long life-time: 1.25 × 109 years.
Its two principal decay modes are to 40Ca, accounting for
89% of the decays, and 40Ar, for the remaining 11%. Though
comparatively rare, this potassium isotope is important in
the Earth’s heat production because potassium is relatively
abundant, of the order of a few percent in both granite and
basalt, the principal components of the Earth’s crust. As a
side note, this decay is also responsible for the almost 1% of
the Earth’s atmosphere being composed of argon. The heat
generated per second by a gram of each of these radioactive
elements is listed in Table (14.1) (this data is from Fermi’s
notes) and Table (14.2) lists the percentages of these elements
in common rocks.

With these numbers Fermi was in a position to estimate
the amount of heat generated in the Earth by radioactivity.
Multiplying the proportional amount of each radioactive el-
ement in a type of rock by the heat generated per gram by
that element, we ﬁnd for the case of granite

+ (5.6 × 10−9) × (2 × 10−5) (Th)
= 3.6 × 10−13cal/(g s).
The biggest unknown lies in estimating how many grams of
the material containing the radioactive isotopes are present in
the Earth. The value for granite of 3.2 × 1020 cal/year given
below in Table (14.3) corresponds to estimating that granite
makes up ≈0.5% of the Earth’s mass, or the total amount
of granite is ∼3 × 1025 g. This is a reasonable estimate given
that although granite is the main component of the ﬁrst few
tens of kilometers of the continental crust, there is little of
it elsewhere in the Earth. Making similar estimates for the
other types of rock and multiplying our results by the num-
ber of seconds in a year, 3.15×107, Fermi obtained estimates
of the amount of heat generated in the Earth measured in
units of cal/year for each of the four types of rock. These are
listed in Table (14.3). Given the relative scarcity of radioac-
tive elements in peridotite, it seems surprising at ﬁrst glance
that it is the principal contributor to the heat balance. The
answer is quite simple: peridotite is the dominant rock in the
Earth’s mantle and therefore constitutes a far larger compo-

nent of the Earth’s volume than either granite or basalt, key
elements of the considerably smaller crust of the Earth.
To appreciate the scale of the heating due to radioactivity,
imagine that the heat generated by radioactivity remained
entirely within the Earth rather than escaping into the atmo-
sphere. The sum of the heat production for the rocks listed
in Table (14.3) is Hrad = 26.2 × 1020 cal/year. Taking the
speciﬁc heat of rock as approximately ce = 0.2 cal/(g K) we
would then expect the Earth’s temperature to rise by
Hrad
Mece
=
26.2 × 1020
6 × 1027 × 0.2 = 2.2 × 10−6K/year
or more than 2000 K in a billion years. This has not happened
because heat escapes into the atmosphere.
The methods and the calculations above are correct, but
the results reﬂect data available in 1941. Modern measure-
ments have improved and changed our present understanding
of these numbers. In particular the estimate of heat gener-
ated by radiation that reaches the Earth’s surface, Hrad =
26.2 × 1020 cal/year, is almost an order of magnitude larger
than the value we presently believe to be true.
There are
many reasons for the discrepancy, including overly large esti-
mates of the amount of radioactive material present, partic-
ularly true in the case of peridotite. Some of the heat also
surely is responsible for the movement of the tectonic plates,
a phenomenon unknown or at least unaccepted in 1941. In
addition, it was believed at the time that the thickness of the
crust underneath the oceans and the continents was compa-
rable. We now know that this is not the case. Whereas the

206
CHAPTER 14. RADIOACTIVITY
continental crust, a material comparatively rich in uranium
and thorium, extends for 30 km or so, the oceanic crust has
a thickness of only a few kilometers.
14.7
Uranium Decays and Lead
Isotope Abundances
In what follows Fermi focuses on three of the four isotopes
that contribute signiﬁcantly to radioactively generated heat
in the Earth. Each one of these three, 238U, 235U, and 232Th,
has a long decay chain that terminates in one of the four
stable isotopes of lead, the lead isotopes having respective
atomic weights of 208, 207, 206, and 204. They have signiﬁ-
cant abundances in common lead (52.4%, 24.1%, 22.1%, and
1.4%, respectively), and all four have primordial components,
but only the ﬁrst three are produced as the end products of
radioactive decay by elements of higher atomic number. We
list below the three principal modes in question and their
respective half-lives.
Table 14.4: Decay Modes of Uranium Isotopes
238U →8He4 + 6e−+ 206Pb
T1/2 = 4.56 × 109 year
235U →7He4 + 4e−+ 207Pb
T1/2 = 7.13 × 108 year
232Th →6He4 + 4e−+ 208Pb
T1/2 = 1.31 × 1010 year
As indicated, the transition from uranium or thorium to
lead comes as the conclusion of many steps that involve either
the emission of an electron or of an alpha particle.The half-
life measurements given in Fermi’s notes diﬀer slightly from
the presently determined best values but are close enough for
the calculations below.
There is a subtlety here which is worth mentioning.
In

14.8. RADIOACTIVE DATING
207
principle the decay of, e.g., 238U involves fourteen steps in
succession, eight of them involving the emission of an alpha
particle and six of them that of an electron. This raises the
question of what does λ mean? The ith daughter in the decay
chain satisﬁes
dNi+1/dt = λiNi −λi+1Ni+1
(14.9)
rather than the the simple form of Eq. (14.5), so it would
appear that we have to solve a large set of simultaneous dif-
ferential equations. Fortunately this is not the case because,
in all three of isotope decays listed above, the ﬁrst decay has
a much longer half-life than all the others, or equivalently,
λ1 ≪λ2, λ3, ... λn,
(14.10)
so the T1/2 quoted in the table above is the T1/2 for the ﬁrst
decay in the chain. This reasoning does not hold for 40K,
which has two decay modes with comparable lifetimes, but
we will not pursue that case here.
14.8
Using Radioactive Isotopes for Dating
There are many examples of employing radioactive isotopes
to date rocks or other materials. We shall give one example
here. It makes use of zircon, a mineral that during its forma-
tion incorporates uranium and thorium but not lead into its
crystal structure. Any lead present in an undamaged sample
of zircon is therefore the result of uranium or thorium decay.
Let N238(t) be the number of 238U atoms present at time
t, where t is the number of years since the rock was formed,
i.e., it is the age of the zircon rock.
Likewise, let N206(t)
be the number of 206Pb atoms present at time t. We know
that N238(0), the number of 238U atoms at the time of the

208
CHAPTER 14. RADIOACTIVITY
zircon rock formation, is equal to N238(t) + N206(t) because
originally there was no lead in the zircon and the 238U atoms
that decayed are now present in the zircon as 206Pb atoms.
Writing this as an equation, we have
N238(0) = N238(t) + N206(t),
(14.11)
or, dividing by N238(t),
N238(0)
N238(t) = 1 + N206(t)
N238(t).
(14.12)
Using the radioactive decay law, Eq. (14.6), we have
N238(t) = N238(0)e−λ238t,
(14.13)
so Eq. (14.12) becomes
eλ238t = 1 + N206(t)
N238(t).
(14.14)
Taking logarithms of both sides, we obtain
t = (
ln(1 + N206(t)
N238(t))
λ238
) = (
ln(1 + N206(t)
N238(t))
ln(2)
)(T1/2)238,
(14.15)
where from Table (14.4), (T1/2)238 = 4.56 × 109year. The
last form of Eq. (14.15) is quite useful. It gives the age t of
a sample of zircon as a fraction of the half-life of 238U. The
fraction depends only on the ratio of 206Pb to 238U at time
t in the sample. Fermi gives an example of such dating to
determine the age of geological eras. In Table (14.5), we use
his method to calculate the ages of various eras in the Earth’s
history, using Eq. (14.15) to calculate the age of the era from
the Pb/U ratios.
As a check on the results obtained using the decay of 238U
to 206Pb, we can instead use the decay of 235U to 207Pb. The

where from Table (14.4), (T1/2)235 = 7.13 × 108years.
The general method described above is known as U-Pb
dating and is one of the oldest and most reliable methods
of radiometric dating. As the preceding discussion hopefully
makes clear, the discovery of radioactivity and the use of
radiometric dating revolutionized the understanding of the
age of the Earth. Present estimates are consistent with the
time required for biological and geological evolution.
