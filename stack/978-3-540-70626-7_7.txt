Atomic Models, J.J. Thomson’s
“Plum Pudding” Model
Klaus Hentschel
In 1897, Joseph John Thomson (1856–1940) had announced the discovery of a cor-
puscle. Others soon called it  electron, despite Thomson’s stubborn preference for
his original term, borrowed from Robert Boyle (1627–91) to denote any particle-
like structure. Very soon afterwards, Thomson began to think about how to explain
the periodicity of properties of the chemical elements in terms of these negatively
charged corpuscles as atomic constituents. Chemical properties would thus have to
depend on the number and constellations of these corpuscles inside the atom. They
would have to have stable positions in it, bound by electrostatic and possibly kinetic
forces. Because under normal conditions chemical atoms are electrically neutral,
the total electric charge of all these negatively charged electrons had to be com-
pensated for by an equal amount of positive charge. For Thomson it was natural to
