History 
“Mechatronics” term coined by engineer Tetsura Mori in 1969 at 
Yasakawa Electric Corp. 
Upto 1980 mechatronics meant only combination of electronics and 
mechanical engineering 
Computing technology added later with development of computers

System 
A system can be thought as box or 
block diagram 
Having an input and corresponding 
output 
Inputs and outputs of system important 
not what goes inside the system

Components of Mechatronics Systems 
Mechanical System 
Electrical System 
Information System 

Mechanical Systems and Analysis 
Types of Systems  
Rigid – Rigid Multibody Simulation 
Deformable – Failure analysis, Finite Element Method (FEM) 
Fluid – Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
 
Some mechanical components used 
Rigid - Gears, drives, cams, bearings, etc. 
Flexible – Electroactive polymers, Shape memory alloys, 
fiber reinforced material 
Fluid - Hydraulic cylinder, pneumatic cylinder, etc. 

Electrical Systems 
Motors and generators 
Sensors and actuators 
Solid state devices 
Circuits – signal conditioning, amplifiers, etc. 
Contact devices – relays, switches. Circuit breakers, fuses, 
etc. 
 

Information System 
Information System consist of four parts 
Communication Systems 
Signal Processing 
Control System 
Numerical Solvers for Optimization 
Under Information System following activities are performed 
Modeling 
Simulation 
Automatic Control 
Optimization 
 

Traditional Vs Mechatronics Based 
Design 
In traditional design individual subsystems were designed 
sequentially 
Mechanical engineer designs mechanical elements 
After that control engineers designs control system 
In mechatronics, all subsystems are designed concurrently as 
there is tight interaction between the subsystems 
Example of temperature control devices  
Traditional bimetallic strip based design 
•Concurrent design in mechatronics 
•More compact and easily 
reprogrammable 
•Electronics and mechanical parts 
complement each other 
•Most design and error checking 
completed using Simulation 
 
 

Closed-Loop and Open Loop Systems 
Open loop system look only it 
its input to determine what it 
should do 
 
Closed loop system looks both 
at its input as well as output to 
determine what to do

Examples 
Open Loop System 
 Control system of a microwave turns it off after set time 
Does not look at temperature of food to “decide” turning off microwave 
No feedback 
Regulator of Ceiling Fan depends on electrical resistance in the circuit 
No feedback RPM is received by the regulator 
 
Closed Loop System 
Temperature control system looks at the sensor readings of 
surrounding temperature 
If different than desired temperature takes action 
 

Summary 
System is an abstraction represented using box or block 
diagram which has an input and corresponding output/s 
Mechatronics ssytem has following subsystems 
Electrical System 
Mechanical System 
Information System 
Traditional design is sequential while mechatronics based 
design is concurrent
