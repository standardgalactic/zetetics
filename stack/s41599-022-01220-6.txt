According to the literature, educational technologies present several learning beneﬁts to
promote online education. However, there are several associated challenges, and some
studies illustrate the limitations in elaborating educational technologies, called Design lim-
itations. This aspect is responsible for unleashing various issues in the learning process, such
as gender inequality, creating adverse effects on cognitive, motivational, and behavioral
mediators, which opposes the ﬁfth UN’s Sustainable Development Goal. Therefore, many
studies notice the harmful effects of stereotypes in educational technologies. These effects
can be included in the design, like colors or other stereotyped elements, or how the activity
is conducted. Based on this, the present study aimed to verify the predominance of color
bias in educational technologies available on the WEB. This study developed a computa-
tional solution to calculate male and female color bias in the available educational tech-
nology web pages. The results suggest the prevalence of the development of educational
technologies with a male color bias, with an imbalance among genders, without adequate
customization for age groups. Furthermore, some environments, such as Computer Science,
present a higher color bias for men when compared to women. Despite both scales being
independent, results indicated interesting evidence of a substantial prevalence of colors
associated with the male scale. According to the literature, this may be associated with
dropout and lack of interest in female students, especially in sciences, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics domains.

Introduction
S
tudies debated various features contained in educational
technologies, including beneﬁts, challenges, and strategies of
online education (Bailey and Lee, 2020). The current sce-
nario caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has expanded the niche,
and the need for educational technologies in order to improve
teaching-learning processes and styles (Dhawan, 2020). More-
over, according to Dhawan (2020), this promotes the growth of
educational technologies, providing suggestions to academic
institutions as to how to deal with the challenges associated with
online learning, training, and further education to develop stu-
dents’ independence by improving digital skills to an academic
level (Jackman et al., 2021). This also provides support for tea-
chers in the students’ inquiries (Goudeau et al., 2021), prevent
cheating (Li et al., 2021), and increase engagement. Especially
when it is not possible to have direct contact with students in the
classroom due to the current pandemic scenario and when pro-
cedures need to be adjusted to manage academic subjects and
teaching resources (Gillett-Swan, 2017; Hafeez et al., 2021).
Alongside the issues mentioned above, opportunities also arise,
such as possibilities to develop new teaching methods (Almossa
and Alzahrani, 2022), learning support from artiﬁcial intelligence
interactions (Pataranutaporn et al., 2021), improving access to
education in rural zones, and study hours ﬂexibility (Adedoyin
and Soykan, 2020; Vlachopoulos, 2020).
Nevertheless, some studies illustrate the limitations in elabor-
ating educational technologies (Schöbel et al., 2020), frequently
called Design limitations. That is, attributes that may be used for
an adequate elaboration of educational technologies (Klock et al.,
2015), in a manner in which technologies become more custo-
mized, in aspects such as (i) age; (ii) gender; (iii) motivations;
and, lastly, (iv) student proﬁle. The latter is necessary because
students of different proﬁles may interact differently with the
teaching platforms (Espinoza et al., 2020). Students can be
encouraged by different attributes such as videos, quizzes,
experience points (Geving, 2007; Hill, 2006). This use of attri-
butes may help prevent inequalities, such as (i) some students
learn more than others; (ii) lower engagement in certain student
groups (Forman et al., 2020); (iii) students of opposite genders
not being able to understand the exact issue (Pedro et al., 2015);
and (iv) high evasion rates per student group.
This stereotype limitation in educational technologies is
responsible for unleashing many problems (Darling-Hammond
et al., 2020). Learning inequalities lead to various adverse effects
(Pennington et al., 2016) such as cognitive mechanisms mediated
by cognitive load (Croizet et al., 2004; Kith et al., 2022) leading to
a decrease in cognitive performance due to the effects of stereo-
type threat. The decrease in work memory due to stereotype-
related distractions (Doncel-García et al., 2022; Johns et al., 2008;
Schmader and Johns, 2003; Turner and Engle, 1989). These may
also lead to mind-wandering, with studies reporting an increase
in stereotype-related thoughts and concerns when those were
triggered in priming tasks (Brown Morris, 2022; Rydell et al.,
2014; VanLandingham et al., 2021). Additionally, motivational
mechanisms mediated by achievement goals showed that high
difﬁculty activities induced apprehension (Chalabaev et al., 2008;
Elliot and Church, 1997; Seo and Lee, 2021). Moreover, dejection
in groups in uneven scenarios was related to lower performance
(Hoeve, 2022; Keller and Dauenheimer, 2003). Lastly, behavioral
mechanisms mediated by anxiety may affect the use of gamiﬁed
technologies with gender discrepancies (Albuquerque et al., 2017;
Grier et al., 2022). Also, self-efﬁcacy was reported to have a sig-
niﬁcant impact on performance and motivation when partici-
pants are presented with stereotyped cues (Maddux, 1993;
Navarro et al., 2022; Schunk, 1989). Such issues are objects to
studies in a strand of the literature called Stereotype Threat,
which consists of an individual’s exacerbated concern of being
evaluated based on a negative stereotype (Myers et al., 2014). This
stereotype is characterized by the incidence of patterns prone to
please a certain group (Lippmann, 1946). This preference may
lead to better results among individuals of target groups when
compared to those of impaired groups, as is evidenced by learning
performance indicators (Hsu et al., 2022), which was reported to
be due to effects brought by cognitive (Kith et al., 2022; Schmader
et al., 2008), and behavioral mechanisms (Gerstenberg et al.,
2012). Anxiety is a potential mediator in this process, promoting
a signiﬁcant impact on learning performance, and is frequently
related to stereotype threat.
Several studies noticed adverse effects of stereotypes in edu-
cational technologies, whether these are included in the design
through stereotyped colors, elements, and texts or during the
execution of an activity. By using elements of stereotyped design,
Chang et al. (2019) presented evidence that interactions in
educational platforms with stereotyped Avatars cause a decrease
in women’s learning performances when interacting with these
Avatars with male-dominated design. Albuquerque et al. (2017)
proposed an experiment to analyze colors in gender-stereotyped
gamiﬁed environments in order to assess if gender-related colors
inﬂuenced students’ anxiety levels. The study used blue for male-
stereotyped environments, lilac for female-stereotyped, and gray
for the control setting. Results concluded that changes in
women’s anxiety levels were more signiﬁcant than those of men
while using male-stereotyped technology. Nonetheless, stereo-
type threat may be centered not only around attributes such as
colors composing educational technologies but also the interac-
tions with the elements themselves. Christy and Fox (2014)
discussed the conﬁguration of ranking tables and texts in
scoreboards regarding stereotype threat. According to the
authors, there was evidence that women, when in a setup with a
female-dominant ranking table, presented lower performances in
the mathematics test when compared to women in a setup with a
male-dominant ranking table.
Three aspects of stereotype threat (text, interactions, and col-
ors) are considered in educational technologies. The textual
analysis depends on speciﬁc language nuances (AlBadani et al.,
2022). This type of analysis would require universal linguistic
models able to handle at least most world languages. Therefore,
besides a large amount of data, it would also require high com-
putational power for training and realignment for each language
(Taghizadeh and Faili, 2022) including regional variations. On the
other hand, to observe stereotype effects on users’ interactions
would require data user logs in every single system, as well as
users to follow a standardized data collection (Nguyen et al.,
2022), which would exponentially increase the task’s complexity.
However, using colors and their biases, we can focus on just a few
aspects of the design of educational technologies (Albuquerque
et al., 2017; Kuo et al., 2022). Therefore, the data collection and
analysis complexity can be reduced by applying the tools to
collect color data.
Motivated by the adverse effects of stereotype threat in edu-
cational technologies, this study aimed to verify the existence of
prevalence in the level of color preferences (a.k.a. color bias) in
educational technologies. Additionally, this study aimed to pre-
sent how color design is used, considering speciﬁc aspects such as
the type of technology, context, and target audience, regarding
gender and age. Given the availability of information on the web,
we chose to focus on four types of educational technologies: (i)
CMS—content management systems; (ii) RLE—remote learning
environments
(AVA—Virtual
Learning
Environments);
(iii)
Gamiﬁed Environments; and lastly (iv) MOOCs—Massive open
online courses, used as teaching technologies of seven teaching

In order to evaluate the color bias in educational technologies and
the prevalence of color preferences, the following research ques-
tions were formulated: The gender category was divided into male
and female only.
1. What is the color preference (color-bias) in educational
technology design?
2. What is the color preference (color-bias) present in
educational technologies design according to the teaching
subjects (context)?
3. What is the color preference (color-bias) concerning the
colors present in the design according to the types of
educational technologies?
4. What is the color preference (color-bias) present in
educational technologies design according to the age range
of the target group?
This article is organized in the following manner: section two
describes the theoretical framework and the related studies, pre-
senting stereotype threats, the metrics used, and the gamiﬁed
educational settings of this study. Section three presents the
proposal and describes the tools used in this study. Section four
presents and discusses the results. Lastly, in section ﬁve, the study
conclusions are addressed.
Theoretical framework
The following section presents a brief literature review with the
main
concepts
and
theories
adopted
as
a
basis
for
the
present study.
Stereotype threat. Stereotype, in its conceptualization, has a
Greek origin which means (“stereo” —rigid; “typos”—impres-
sion). The concept was used to represent a form of impression
manufactured in metallic parts for the production of books
during the 18th century (Del Boca and Ashmore, 1980). In 1981,
Walter Lippman aggregated a new conceptualization of the word,
deﬁning it as previously constituted mental representations,
which somehow inﬂuenced the ability to conduct activities.
Stereotypes became known as beliefs, resulting in a prejudiced
judgment regarding a speciﬁc target, and became an object of
study for social psychology. Such studies observed the intellectual
complexity
linked
to
the
development
of
activities
when
comparing performance (Yzerbyt et al., 1997). It was noted that
when the stereotype unleashes a negative sense, the individual
may suffer a series of issues, which may affect psychological
mediators-namely,
cognitive,
behavioral,
and
motivational
mechanisms. When the effect is perceived, the individual who
is affected enters a state of threat (Pennington et al., 2016).
Stereotype threat consists of negative effects on an individual’s
performance in a certain task (Shapiro and Neuberg, 2007).
Several studies in the literature observe the effects of stereotype
threats in social groups (identity groups and non-identity groups,
Gonzales et al., 2002; Martiny et al., 2012). These studies often
identiﬁed decreased performance when participants of minority
groups faced stereotyped environments. Some studies investi-
gated and discussed the stereotype threat effect (Flore and
Wicherts, 2015; Lamont et al., 2015; Nguyen and Ryan, 2008;
Shewach et al., 2019) and its correlation with performance (Lewis
Jr and Michalak, 2019). Through the development of activities to
evaluate the performance of minority groups while performing a
task and developing stereotyped scenarios to simulate and verify
stereotype threat effects. The attributes related to stereotype
threat comprise elements such as colors in the design of
educational technologies.
Effects caused by stereotypes and performance decreases are
present in much of educational technology’s attributes. Based on
that, studies discussed educational technologies that may favor a
group. Nonetheless,
when the technology presents gender
stereotypes, this may greatly disfavor the learning process of the
other group. Gender stereotyped educational technologies are
currently an essential subject of study associating possible causes
and effects. For instance, Albuquerque et al. (2017) presented a
study on the impact of stereotype threat and anxiety on the
performance of a logic test. Nonetheless, the subject still raises
many questions due to curious results. Christy and Fox (2014)
presented evidence that women when in a setup with a female-
dominated ranking table presented lower performances in the
mathematics test when compared to women in a setup with a
male-dominated ranking table.
Educational Technologies and color-bias. Colors are understood
as objects that have three components (Ibraheem et al., 2012): (i)
hue—the combination that can be made by using shades of red,
green, and blue (RGB); (ii) saturation—the attenuation degree of
a speciﬁc color, i.e., its intensity; (iii) brightness - an attribute that
deﬁnes the characteristic of light emission, that is, the state of
giving out or reﬂecting light.
However, a color can be much more than an element of design:
it may be related to different feelings, emotions, and desires
(Rider, 2010) and related to how human brains can capture it.
Understanding the whole process of assimilation, from its
activation to how the perception can inﬂuence human behavior
through colors, is the object of the study of color psychology
(Singh and Srivastava, 2011; Whitﬁeld and Whiltshire, 1990).
Based upon this relation, understanding the primary feelings
and emotions aroused through the perception (Webster, 1996) of
a speciﬁc color, it is possible to elaborate a correlation with the
meaning of the information which a particular color may convey.
The literature presents various studies relating feelings originating
from colors, ranging from tranquility to the impression of
something hazardous (Simmons, 2011).
In order to understand further the color relations with
emotions and behavior, studies considered individual color
preferences as a way to relate one’s emotion to his/hers current
mental state. Through that, it was possible to observe the changes
in color emotional response throughout the years, as well
correlate color preferences with gender (Cunningham and
Macrae, 2011) or according to age group (Pope et al., 2012).
Some studies (Best et al., 1975; Clark and Clark, 1940; Duckitt
et al., 1999) observed that colors are also associated with trend
biases: positive-white and negative-black, which can be strongly
linked to documents that represent cultural and racial groups.
Studies also reported that the relationships between colors and
human beings could be further extended into characteristics that
involve the perception of color based on gender. Hill (2002)
analyzed the relationship between skin colors and the meaning
attached to it. In this study, results suggested that men related the
skin with female characteristics based on the color tone associated
with the skin. Furthermore, Jakobsdóttir et al. (1994) presented
signiﬁcant differences between color preferences between men
and women and discussed the guidelines for developing graphics
(images) that should be used. This was also pointed out by
Volman and van Eck (2001), who considered color as a possible
leveling attribute for gender equity in educational technologies.
Although the literature does not directly address existing color
bias in educational technologies, it has no shortage of studies that
show that color bias can directly inﬂuence some elements or
mediators, whether in the design (Albuquerque et al., 2017;
Richard, 2017) or in the educational scope itself (Brandon et al.,
HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-022-01220-6

2021). The literature presents evidence that although colors are
strongly related to children’s future choices, stereotyped elements
belonging to the same gender can inﬂuence them even more
(Karniol, 2011). Furthermore, studies also reported that graphic
elements are generally perceived differently by men and women,
which allows questions about differences in learning in educa-
tional technologies to arise (Chanlin, 2001).
The issue of gender in educational technologies. Currently,
many studies present factors that should be better explored in
educational technologies. Although several factors such as age
group, ethnic group, and culture inﬂuence inclusion parameters,
gender remain one of the easiest to control and study due to its
number of classes. Studies reported distinct styles in the learning
process between men and women, as well as choices by dis-
ciplines more suited based on these proﬁles (Steffens and Jelenec,
2011). Comparisons can identify trends, such as mentioned by
Steffens et al. (2010), Vuletich et al. (2020): women prefer dis-
ciplines directed towards the elaboration of content for personal
growth, while men tend to logic and reasoning.
Among other gender-related aspects, the subject of stereotypes
and educational technologies and how it has the potential to favor
a group while disfavoring or hindering the learning of other has
been approached by scholars in recent years. Albuquerque et al.
(2017) presented a study on the negative impact of stereotype
threat and increased anxiety in the performance in logic tests.
Moreover, Lee and Nass (2012) showed that, in educational
technologies, the females tend to be fewer concerns associated
with stereotypes and presented overall better performances in
math tests while cooperating instead of when competing.
Components included in the design exert inﬂuence over results
as well as Chang et al. (2019) presented evidence that women who
had their learning performance impaired while interacting with
male instructors used non-verbal sexist behavior. Furthermore,
Christy and Fox (2014) reported that women, when in a setup
with a ranking table that is female-dominant, showed lower
performance in the math tests when compared to women in a
setup with a male-dominant ranking table. However, the
moderator’s
avatar
did
not
signiﬁcantly
impact
women’s
performance in the same conditions.
Related works. Subjects like safety and moral standards have
been associated with many arguments considering the World
Wide Web since its early days. Using the large amount of data
that has been produced on the internet in recent years Sagiroglu
and Sinanc (2013), researches highlighted ethical aspects (Ogbuke
et al., 2022), privacy (Saura et al., 2021) and security (Díaz et al.,
2022) of the immense amount of data. Other studies pointed to
data bias in applications with artiﬁcial intelligence and natural
language processing (Caliskan et al., 2017; Hellman, 2020;
Kleinberg et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2021; Pessach and Shmueli,
2020). Moreover, some authors observed ﬂaws in algorithmic
fairness in education (Kizilcec and Lee, 2020) and further dis-
cussed challenges to accessing this data for research, considering
ethics and justice.
Silva et al. (2019) suggested a possible solution with a
supervised learning approach to detect gender stereotypes in
online educational technologies. Similarly, Silva et al. (2019)
proposed the implementation of a data collection technology on
websites available on the WEB to extract gender bias from the
contents present on its pages. In order to construct these datasets,
the authors proposed a search that included website contexts not
restricted to educational, although in this study, they only
analyzed educational sites. Furthermore, the authors proposed a
computational solution based on image and text processors and a
bias management system (Fig. 1).
The limitations found in Silva et al. (2019) proposal can be seen
in two dimensions: Technical and Ethical, the Ethical dimension
being the most critical. In the Technical dimension, it is observed
that the collected data are only from the main page of the
corresponding educational technology. Therefore, explicit stereo-
types might be present on other pages of the same technology,
generating inaccuracies in calculating color bias in the sample.
Additionally, no smoothing in the pixel calculation was observed
in this study. The principle behind this smoothing process is to
allow calculations of page similarity based on RGB standards,
considering averages only. In turn, the ethical dimension is of
utmost importance due to morality issues and from a legal point
of view: the authors referred to the data collection process
without considering permission criteria and which pages are
accessible for collection or not. Thus, works that discuss, for
example, areas correlated with ethical principles also need to
conduct studies that follow these same ethical standards, and
studies should present summarized comparisons with the main
research topics of each proposal (Table 1).
Methodology
The current study investigates the presence of color bias existing in
educational technologies. Furthermore, based on the assumption of
its existence, observe the impact of this bias on diverse target
audiences and their respective age groups. Thus, observe if there are
color differences in technologies by respective types and context.

The character of the present study is observational and intends
to detect and measure the color preference level in educational
technologies, considering male and female gender. In order to
answer our research questions, a computer solution was created
to estimate the color preference level among genders through a
process developed to identify colors in educational technologies
(Fig. 2). The developed algorithm receives the Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) of a given educational technology and identiﬁes
the colors contained on the main page. This tool also access
colors on secondary pages of the respective educational tech-
nology. The representation of similarities between colors is not
adequate colors are composed of three shades. Therefore, to
calculate similarities between them, it was necessary to perform
two treatments: (i) standardization—which consists of applying a
standard between collected colors, varying tonality between 0 and
255—this assures the averages of the RGB components of the
processed colors. Moreover, the standardization allows calculat-
ing a resulting color, simplifying interpretation. Furthermore, this
process was necessary to normalize all the pixels on a page,
highlight the most present colors for analysis, and discard rare
colors that could have affected the results. In other words, only
the most frequent colors were considered for the analysis, thus
resulting in color equalization (Yongan et al., 2012; Zhong et al.,
2008);
(ii)
LUV
softening—consists
of
applying
a
vector
decomposition, consisting of the more accurate vector repre-
sentation (Kakooei and Baleghi, 2022) between two colors. In
other words, with LUV softening, it is possible to calculate how
close two colors are in terms of similarity, creating a more
semantic representation of the colors in a vector space. The LUV
softening effect produces more pragmatic colors, which place
them closer to human visual perception and facilitate identiﬁ-
cation (Zhang et al., 2020). Furthermore, LUV softening was the
base calculation of smoothing for constructing the male and
female scales in each educational technologies page and classi-
fying them according to how they are perceived by the human
eye, considering color segmentation in its hue, saturation, and
brightness. After these two processes (standardization and soft-
ening), the predisposition of existing colors was calculated in
male and female scales based on gender-related color perception.
The construction of these gender-based scales considered the
color range that best ﬁts current preference proﬁles. According to
Fulcher and Hayes (2018), Yeung and Wong (2018), the color
range of pink and purple was a preference for females, while blue
and green for males. Kodžoman et al. (2022), Kuo et al. (2022)
also presented color ranges of pink and blue as colors with pre-
ference highest levels among women and men, respectively.
Based on these classic scales and color ranges, the male scale
taken as a basis was proposed by Silver and Ferrante (1995),
presenting color preferences for masculine colors in shades of
green and blue. For the female scale, it was taken as a basis, the
scale proposed by Hallock (2003), where women’s color pre-
ference for shades of red, pink, and purple is displayed. Lastly,
with the colors and scales arranged, the calculation of the male
and female preference levels for each page composing the edu-
cational technology is carried out through the cosine.
Materials. The computational solution in this study is com-
posed of processing modules described in further detail below.
Moreover, the source code collected data and statistical analysis
are available in an available online repository1 for access and
evaluation. Overall, a total of six processing modules were used,
as follows:
●
Encase and anonymity of technology links: The algorithm
receives as input a ﬁle called ’urls.txt’ containing links to
educational technologies. Afterward, it applies a hashing
function to encrypt the access link. Given this, the
algorithm creates a new spreadsheet (dictionary.csv) with
a list of URLs with encrypted data to organize the samples
that will be collected in the next step;

●
Collection of pages links: The algorithm accesses the
spreadsheet ﬁle, accessing links of educational technolo-
gies homepages, retrieving all the pages contained in that
technology and that have access permission (more details
in section “Ethics on data collection procedure”), then, a
new spreadsheet ﬁle (pages.csv) is created containing the
pages associated with the educational technology being
processed;
●
Pages screenshot: the algorithm access the “pages.csv”
spreadsheet ﬁle scanning page by page, taking a screenshot,
and saving it;
●
Pixels collection and normalization: The algorithm ran-
domly scans each of the screenshot images, collecting a
total of 3000 colored pixels above the white color tone.
White-colored pages were discarded by the tool for further
analysis. Nonetheless, these pages were recorded in a ﬁle
(’whitepageslist.txt’). In order to guarantee the average of
the colors in the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) pattern, the
algorithm applied pixel normalization to colored/non-
white pages. The RGB model was chosen as a standard
broadly used, and due to its compatibility with all color
systems adopted for educational technologies’ develop-
ment (Olsson, 2014);
●
LUV smoothing: This step transformed the RGB pattern
into a LUV decomposition to assure the representation of
colors with greater accuracy, especially considering the
variety of color shades to serve as input to the next step;
●
Similarity calculation: The distance between the colors of
the scales was calculated with the colors extracted from
sampled pages to calculate the degree of similarity
between the male and female scales. The cosine was the
metric chosen for representing more accurately, follow-
ing the metrics established by Tao et al. (2017) and
Techapanurak et al. (2019, 2020). Cosine calculation
further allows the measurement of the distance between
two values and considers directionality, as blue and red
would present opposite directions in the scale. It is worth
remembering that both color scales are standardized
with LUV smoothing leveling similarities calculation. As
the ﬁnal step, similarity values were aggregated by page
and, thus, the values of respective levels of female and
male preference.
Ethics on data collection procedure. The present study used data
mining concepts on the Web, taking into account authorization
of which ﬁles can be accessed and collected through permissions
ﬁles (like robots.txt and meta-tags, Van Wel and Royakkers,
2004), such as Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP). These establish
standards for whether to access data and which part of this data is
permitted by query robots available on the Web, comprising
ethical norms and principles and the use of information that does
not require approved access.
Therefore, the robots.txt ﬁle was checked to verify access
permissions
for
each
site’s
web
page
(i.e.,
educational
technologies). The ﬁle follows a structure of which agents and
which pages can get accessed. Generally, an asterisk indicates
that any computer agent (robot) will not be able to consult or
access the respective page, which was listed in the body of the
ﬁle. Some speciﬁcations allow robots to access certain content,
such as Facebook or Twitter agents that can have access to
proﬁle content.
Pages like users, proﬁles, products, buy, and about/personal
have access restrictions for any agent. However, pages such as
“index” or “about” may have granted access to robots.txt example
ﬁles. Figure 3 shows a ﬁle example with the speciﬁc pages without
permissions to access.
The literature concerned with such ethical concepts follows this
convention (robots.txt or meta-tags) from web data mining for
open linked data (Oren et al., 2008), web content mining
(Költringer and Dickinger, 2015), mining learners participating
data in learning environments (Kop et al., 2011). All of these
ethical concepts were taken into account for the construction of
the data of this study.
The process of link extraction and sampling for building the
dataset (“pages.csv”) used in this study was developed in three
stages: (i) web mining; (ii) ethical mining; and (iii) data
collection (Fig. 4)
●
Web mining module: The ﬁrst stage consisted in accessing
main sites, also called Indexes or Homepages. This step
checked the presence and access granted by Robots.txt
ﬁles. All links referenced on this page were veriﬁed
according to such restrictions and access permissions in
the second stage;
●
Ethical mining module: The second step applied access
ﬁlters to what may or may not be consulted on pages that
could be accessed later. All inclusions and deletions were
performed by consulting the Robots.txt ﬁle, following the
standards of each site. Links with access restrictions were
deleted, and links with access permission passed to the next
step to build the dataset;
●
Data collection: Links with access permissions were stored
in a ﬁle called pages.csv, with privacy and anonymity of
information. Once stored, the links were encapsulated and
encoded in string hash, which hid any category of the
relation of the data collected with the respective site.
Data and descriptive analysis. This study conducted a manual
search for educational technologies between August and Sep-
tember 2021. A total of 88 technologies were considered, indexed
each by its respective access link (Tables 2 and 3). However, as 15
of these presented access restrictions and speciﬁc permissions,
thus, 73 educational technologies were considered, and data from
3136 pages were collected.
Besides the access links for these educational technologies,
other information was also extracted manually, such as type of
technology, teaching subject, users’ numbers, and age. This data
was available either on “about us” links or in available reports by
the educational technology itself. Therefore, it was possible to
map four types of technologies manually: (i) CMS—content
management systems; (ii) RLE—remote learning environments
(AVA—Virtual Learning Environments); (iii) Gamiﬁed Environ-
ments; and lastly, (iv) Massive open online courses (MOOCs),
divided in seven themes (Business, Computer Science, Languages,
Math, Multidisciplinary, Programming, and Sciences). Moreover,
the ages according to the target audience that was informed by
the technologies. This primary data analysis revealed a total

“impact” of 2,494,082,054 users (registered students) in these
educational technologies.
In order to understand the data in general terms and describe
general statistical analysis, the data was divided into two strands
(Table 4). The ﬁrst strand is related to understanding the data
and organizing it for further analyses (Table 5). It was observed
from this data analysis a high outlier interference, mainly for
Skewness and Kurtosis values. The second strand presented data
considering measures of trend and locality with Winsorized
variants. In this manner, the values would be less impacted by the
presence of outliers. The means provided evidence of high values
belonging to the male scale, indicating a mild male preference.
Furthermore, the standard error and M-estimator presented
values that indicate the ability to generalize the data to reality and
its surroundings, respectively.
Therefore, by observing data description and characteristics,
this study opted for robust statistical methods to analyze the
results. This is due to the large number of issues reported by the
literature (Mair and Wilcox, 2020), especially when there are
violations of data normality. Evaluating the color preference level,
or rather, bias, was used in the one-way comparison of multiple
trimmed groups means statistic test as an alternative to the simple
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Regarding male and female color
preference scales belonging to the same subject evaluation, these

two scales were estimated in each technology and considered
related groups. Therefore, we used Yuen’s trimmed mean t-test in
this analysis due to its robustness for two dependent groups. The
Winsorized Correlation test calculated current correlation levels
between the male and female scales. Since its use is familiar to the
Person correlation, it adds robust effects to the tests (Mair and
Wilcox, 2020).
In the present study, the impact is the number of users who,
in
some
form,
are
impacted
by
using
the
educational
technologies considered in this evaluation (Table 4). The
information related to such metrics was extracted from the
educational technologies pages or was contained in documents
and records available on the WEB. It is relevant to highlight that
some researchers considered at least one year of data showing
the amount of educational technologies users. However, values
remained extremely high despite this outdated information.
Nonetheless, the total amount of users under impact is more
than 2 Billion people. In some manner, individuals made use of
these platforms for acquiring knowledge, whether for training or
learning new content.
The context class was elaborated, considering the activities
and courses the technology in question offers. It is relevant to
point out that a technology belonging to multidisciplinary
contexts must contain more than one speciﬁc teaching subject.
However, it is noted that technology of the multidisciplinary
context could contain the minority contexts classiﬁed with a
single sampling only (n = 1). It is also vital to note that in this
analysis, the computer science and business contexts had only
one technology integrating the group. In contrast, most
technologies tend to diverse contexts, mainly towards indepen-
dent learning of a discipline or course. Regarding the languages
context, technologies that focused on teaching languages speech
or writing as mechanisms for literacy were considered. When
referring to STEM2 ﬁelds, there was a total of 19 technologies.
Despite comprising only one technology of the sample,
computer science showed a high male bias level. Moreover, this
differed from the programming context because the specialty of
the
technology
is
turned
towards
disciplines
composing
computer science, whereas programming is only centered
around the art of programming.
While observing the impact, as expected, technologies of multiple
subjects technologies presented the highest number of users.
Nevertheless, an intriguing fact is that even when adding
educational technologies of STEM focus, despite constituting a
representative majority when compared to languages, the impact
provided by STEM was inferior, summing 6.372%, with a difference
of almost 20% between these contexts. Such an effect can suggest a
considerably low demand for courses in this category.

The technologies belonging to the gamiﬁed environment type
possessed the highest representativeness, with a total of 49 (63%)
out of the 73 educational technologies. Furthermore, it was the
group of technologies that presented the higher impact. One
possible explanation may be that gamiﬁed technologies have
become more prominent in recent years due to game elements
and characteristics, which aggregate engagement and playfulness
in the learning process.
The descriptive data helps to understand the gender-based
differences related to preference level by context and reveals
differences and variations among male and female color scales
(Fig. 5). It is important to emphasize the expected low variations
due to single sampling in computer science and business
contexts. However, an opposite correlation is noted in behavior
between female and male preference scales. In most cases, the
mean values of the female and male scales tend to be presented
in the opposite direction. In the sciences context, it is observed a
mean of higher values for the female scale, whereas, for the male
scale, there is mild evidence that it is the contextual modality
with the lowest mean.
Figure 6 presents the variation between the preference levels with
target group variation. For all age groups, the male scale level is
observed as higher. However, in the female scale boxplots, the
medians evidence differences between them, while the male scales
pattern is practically unchanged, with little variability in the median.
An intriguing fact is the 6–17 boxplot, which despite having a
minimum value and ﬁrst quartile lower than the remaining values,
the correlated boxplot in the female scale does not present an

is possible to observe that they all have a high male bias regardless of the context.

opposite effect, differing from the behavior observed in the variation
of scale levels by context.
The preference levels of female and male scales under the
technology type show that male scales presented a low variation
between medians (Fig. 7). In contrast, the cms type possesses a
higher variability for the levels in the female scale. However,
boxplots’ behavior still presents a total predominance for the male
gender in these technologies, as aforementioned.
Results
The analysis was segmented into two parts to facilitate results
interpretation. The ﬁrst part is related to evaluating the impact of
color bias data only through the main pages belonging to edu-
cational technologies. The second part evaluated the combination
of pages of each technology to understand the relationship
between bias levels and their respective pages, adjusted to context,
target audience, and age group, providing a deeper analysis.
Research Question 1 (Color-bias). Concerning the color bias in a
descriptive analysis, the collected data presented different stan-
dards. Signiﬁcant p-value for data belonging to a non-standard
distribution conﬁrm this (Table 6). The p-values are signiﬁcant
for the B measures, even with W close to 1, and Male L., with W a
little further from 1. Therefore, for a more compressed analysis,
tests adopted were used for the robust analysis, and transfor-
mations in the ﬁnal scales could be applied for softening and
standard testing. However, the development of machine learning
models was used to avoid losing power and size of the effect and
ensure a reliable scale for future analyses.
Results of the comparison between the calculated male and
female preference levels in each technology were organized with
trimming levels and reliability levels, considering preference bias
and effect size (Table 7). The comparison was made through three
adjustments of trimming level of adjusted mean values: (i) 10%;
(ii) 20% and, lastly, (iii) 30%. The results showed that the male
bias level is always higher than the female in the technologies
evaluated in this experiment. Beyond a high effect size, degrees of
freedom (df) indicate the number of ways or dimensions in which
the preference levels can move without violating the restrictions,
therefore, continuing to have a signiﬁcant result.
In order to understand comparisons between the quantiles 3,
observe the reliability interval, and the behavior of the relation-
ship between the two preference levels (male and female),
conﬁdence intervals were listed (Table 8). Each interval was
organized for each quantile, with their respective signiﬁcance

values. Based on the obtained values, it was possible to observe a
reduction of a signiﬁcant effect between quantiles.
The variation among male and female preference levels was
plotted alongside its preference intervals (Fig. 8). The plots
further conﬁrmed the polarity of preference when low values were
obtained in the female scale, while the highest values were found
in the male scale. Consequently, when the female preference level
tends to zero, the male preference levels would reach the highest
values, and vice-versa.
Results of the robust correlation level among preference levels,
as well as their statistical signiﬁcance, were calculated considering
the critical reliability value of 95% (Table 9). It is noticed that an
inverse
correlation
reinforces
the
polarity
or
contrariwise
proportion effect previously mentioned. Furthermore, the varia-
tion of levels in their respective reliability intervals indicated a
weak-moderate effect of −0.4947 taking into account the strength
of correlation on standard scales. The p-value for this comparison
was of 0.00002, indicating a signiﬁcant correlation in this analysis.
Research Question 2: Color-bias in educational technologies by
type. The color bias was also investigated to evaluate variations of
preference level bias by educational technology type. As afore-
mentioned in the descriptive statistic subsection, the technology
types considered for this research were: (i) CMS—content man-
agement systems; (ii) RLE—remote learning environments (AVA
—Ambientes Virtuais de Aprendizagem); (iii) Gamiﬁed Envir-
onments; and lastly (iv) MOOCs—Massive open online courses.
Results for technology types color bias were calculated
separately for gender. For males, p-values (<0.001) presented
statistically signiﬁcant differences, indicating noteworthy differ-
ences among color bias in their technologies. A paired analysis
using adjustment of denominated p post hoc tests on the trimmed
means was conducted to highlight divergent technologies or those
which possess high levels of preference bias (Table 10). Results
indicated that CMS technologies displayed the highest male-
oriented bias levels for colors inherent to the design, while RLE
was the technology type with the lowest male color bias. Despite
signiﬁcant p-value for MOOC and gamiﬁed environments, the
latter took second place among environments with the highest
male color bias. The results also presented a 0.38 correlation
value, indicating a weak to moderate relationship between
technology types. However, while considering existing differences
between color levels belonging to the male colors scale, it is
necessary to verify the existence of female levels of difference.
Still, as mentioned by distinct authors, the scales are not
dichotomous and are not complementary. The results demon-
strated that technology types with the highest female bias are RLE
and CMS, followed by MOOC and, lastly, gamiﬁed environments
(Table 11). Moreover, CMS and MOOC presented similar
preference
levels,
representing
non-signiﬁcant
p
values
(0.14434). The existing correlation between educational technol-
ogies’ colors that consider color preference for the female gender
is also weak to moderate, with a value of 0.26.
Research Question 3: color-bias in educational technologies by
teaching subjects. The preference bias among educational tech-
nology contexts presented statistically signiﬁcant differences for
some of the contexts. The color preference belonging to the male
Fig. 8 Variation of preference levels in their reliability intervals. The ﬁgure shows the variation of the correlation between colors with feminine biases of
colors with masculine biases. When there is much male bias, the colors with female bias are almost nil. On the other hand, the higher the female colors, the
lower the male color values.

scale indicated the highest male color bias is that of Computer
Science, followed by Programming. On the opposite side, Busi-
ness and Sciences presented the lowest male bias compared to the
other contexts, with relatively the same male bias level. Tech-
nologies of Languages, Math, and Multidisciplinary contexts
presented intermediary levels of male bias. Moreover, the two
latter also presented similar levels, with non-signiﬁcant p values
(p = 0.38063) (Table 12).
Statistically signiﬁcant differences were also found in educa-
tional technologies by teaching subjects on the female scale (Table
13). Test results identiﬁed a correlation among levels to be
considered
from
moderate
to
strong,
with
a
0.69
value.
Technologies belonging to Business contexts presented the
highest female preference levels, followed by the Sciences, which
also presented the highest color variability on the female scale. On
the other hand, technologies associated with the Computer
Science context presented the lowest levels of female preference.
Nevertheless, Programming was the third-largest context com-
pared to other technologies within the female color scale level.
Math, Languages, and Multidisciplinary contexts presented
closely related color levels for the female gender.
Research Question 4: color-bias in educational technologies by
age group. The age-group analysis did not indicate signiﬁcant
differences between males (Table 14) considering technologies
divided by their respective target groups or referring to their
appropriate age groups. Therefore it is possible to infer that the
technologies presented equivalent bias loads. In other terms,
regardless of age group, educational technologies presented
similar high values among target groups. Therefore, paired ana-
lyses were not conducted, given that the technologies were divi-
ded by their respective age groups and did not present statistically
signiﬁcant differences in male color bias.
In this analysis, females presented statistically signiﬁcant
differences
between
the
age
groups
of
these
educational
technologies concerning color level, with a p-value of <0.001
(Table 15), despite the weak effect size (0.11) in the scale. The
paired comparisons were conducted with adjusted p-values to

detect signiﬁcant differences between female age groups. Results
indicate differences among educational technologies for the
01–18 years old group, which presented the lowest female
preference levels. The remaining technologies presented pre-
ference levels without signiﬁcance, with equivalent color scales for
age groups.
Discussion
The discussion is centered around answering, discussing, and
pointing out the effects and results produced and presented in the
previous section to facilitate the comprehension of the results,
aligned with the hypotheses of this research.
Therefore, the null hypothesis was rejected, resuming the ﬁrst
research question, which investigated the existence or not of a
color
bias
in
educational
technologies.
Results
indicated
H1.1“statistically signiﬁcant differences between color levels in
educational technologies”. The results show an overall male-
oriented bias toward colors in the design of educational tech-
nologies. One point that raises attention is that currently,
women are still a minority in technology courses. Some studies
further discuss this gender imbalance (Cheryan et al., 2017;
Shein, 2018; Stevenson, 2020), and these report males as the
majority in these areas. This imbalance could consist a sig-
niﬁcant inﬂuence factor in the development of educational
technologies, which are often strongly biased towards the male
gender. Another reason may be the groups responsible for
developing these technologies, which could be imbalanced and
composed mainly of males. According to the American Com-
puter Science Association4, women represent 18% of the stu-
dents who graduate in computer science. Furthermore, women
sum up to 37% of the students in undergraduate programs
belonging to the STEM ﬁelds (science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics; Cheryan et al., 2017).
When observing the results for research question 2 (color bias
in educational technologies by type), the null hypothesis was
rejected, indicating the presence of H2.1 “statistically signiﬁcant
differences between the color levels in educational technologies
by type”. Thus, the presence and dilution of attributes related to
each technology’s color bias and design elements are identiﬁed.
Correlating results for the male scale, gamiﬁed environments
presented the lowest bias levels for the female scale and a high
male bias. Therefore, it is logical to raise assumptions that
advantages for the male gender in diverse aspects referring to
their colors are present in these environments. In turn, content
management systems (CMSs)—systems built exclusively for
content management, presented colors tied to the solution
archetype and its respective educational resources. The student’s
follow-up is even higher since it is a presentation and content
exhibition of educational technology. According to De la Varre
et al. (2014), about evasion, these system modality ﬂaws are
related to the lack of mediation from tutors and teachers. These
ﬂaws can be classiﬁed as a potential problem for opposite-
gender students in this type of technology due to the heavily
inﬂuential role of color bias.
Concerning the third research question, which aimed to
observe the color bias in the context of educational technologies,
the results showed that H3.1 “statistically signiﬁcant differences
between the color levels in educational technologies by context”.
Hence, rejecting the null hypothesis. Nonetheless, the technol-
ogy context with the highest level of male color bias and the
lowest level of female bias was Computer Science. Once again,
since women in this ﬁeld of study can be considered a minority
(as in STEM ﬁelds generally), can this bias be a fundamental
factor for women’s disinterest and evasion rates in this course
modality? Some studies discuss representativeness and media-
tors such as anxiety of women in these courses (Camp, 2002;
Nicolai, 2001) or overall personal interests?. Authors further
discussed anxiety through stereotype threat in educational
technologies in the performance in logic activities (Albuquerque
et al., 2017). Thus, relating the aspect mediated by color inter-
ference to the emergence of possible stereotype threats in edu-
cational
technologies
could
generate
anxiety
and
further
reinforce this issue for female students.
Finally, the results of the fourth research question, color bias in
educational technologies by age group (H4), showed two strands
for each age group. The ﬁrst strand did not reject the null
hypothesis for male color bias, and the second rejected the null
hypothesis for female bias. The literature on color psychology and
their preferences identiﬁes that each age and gender presents a
certain level of preferred colors. While divergence of colors can be
based on gender, obtained through the scales used in this study,
different age groups might present it as well (Hallock, 2003). It is
possible to raise some assumptions about the current study
results. The ﬁrst is that technologies present the same level of
color bias for males, implying that males do not shift in color
preference as much. The second is the lack of standardization in
the elaboration of technologies for colors belonging to the female
gender, with age not being a factor taken into consideration.
Conclusion
The presented and discussed results in this study align with the
current literature. Despite both scales being independent, the
results present evidence of the strong predominance of colors
belonging to the male scale in these evaluated technologies. In
other terms, educational technologies are elaborated with a strong
bias toward the male gender. This bias can be related to the more
signiﬁcant number of male students who graduate in the listed
ﬁelds of the study compared to the number of female students
who seek universities or further education in these areas.
Nevertheless, the development of technologies that consider
the possibility of color customization is still limited. Different
technologies, regardless of the type and applied context, present
low variance in color use when compared to each other. Fur-
thermore, based on our results, gender should be a factor of
utmost importance to make educational technologies more
inclusive and egalitarian. This limitation is perhaps an associated
cause of the evasion of female students in the STEM ﬁelds.
Despite independent preferences in the scales, it was possible to
observe a dichotomy between colors, reinforcing the opposite
effect of gender-related preferences. The existing correlation
between male and female colors showed a moderate negative
effect, indicating an opposite effect to the effect observed.

Limitations, threats to validity and future works. This study
comprised only 73 educational technologies collected randomly,
with 3136 pages from the WEB. With their respective ages, the
target group could be better deﬁned if more precise information
was available on the educational technology’s websites. Moreover,
the number of users was estimated based on the report for some
technologies, which can indicate an inaccuracy of the number of
students, indicating only the number of registered students. We
acknowledge that while there can be cases of more than one
student using the same proﬁle, there is also the possibility of
students having more than one proﬁle, thus causing variation in
the actual number of users.
In the future, we plan to expand this study aims and collect
data to observe the effect of textual elements also extracted from
the educational technologies to analyze negative stereotypes
contained in the textual content. Furthermore, future work is
intended to improve analysis towards age group, considering the
preference scale in this study. Additionally, we intend to increase
the dataset generated in this study to build models to use artiﬁcial
intelligence capable of predicting male and female color bias.
