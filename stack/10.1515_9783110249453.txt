Foreword
Perinatal Programming – The State of the Art
The traditional view on the origins of health and diseases is changing rapidly. More 
and more it becomes clear that there is no static interaction between genes and the 
environment during the life span but that plastic conditioning of the biological ‘hard-
ware’ occurs, especially during critical periods of life in the womb and neonatal period, 
co-determining the long-term fate of an organism. This ‘setting’ of fundamental life func-
tions and dispositions for diseases has been introduced as perinatal programming and 
might be the most important mechanism in the developmental origins of health and 
disease, beyond classical teratogenesis and aging. Because it opens fundamentally new 
perspectives of preventing diseases before they start to develop genuine prophylaxis 
seems to become possible, and this should be of enormous beneﬁ t for the individual as 
well as for societies in the future.
Overall, ﬁ ve major topics have evolved in the current biomedical discussion on this 
issue, namely the ‘left hand side’ and the ‘right hand side’ of the ‘U-shaped curve’ on 
long-term risk in relation to decreased or increased birth weight and its determinants, 
general environmental exposures, hormonal and nutritional inﬂ uences on program-
ming, the role of epigenetics, and general mechanistic concepts and perspectives in 
the ﬁ eld. These overall aspects consequently framed the program of a scientiﬁ c sym-
posium, which was organized and hosted by the ‘Experimental Obstetrics’ research 
group of the Charité, Berlin, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the Charité, 
University Medicine Berlin, and the 200th anniversary of the Humboldt University of 
Berlin, Germany, in 2010. Plenary lectures from worldwide recognized speakers, most 
of them providing pioneer work for decades, highly valuable ‘hot-topic’ presentations, 
the attendance of plenum participants from some 30 countries and ﬁ ve continents, and 
respective ‘pro-and-con’ discussions in the plenum on each of the major topics made 
this congress a ‘landmark-meeting’.
To present this critical come-together in the developmental origins approach to a 
broader scientiﬁ c community and readership, review chapters on selected congress 
contributions compose this volume on Perinatal Programming – The State of the Art. 
Epidemiological, clinical, experimental, and conceptual work is summarized, link-
ing periconceptional, fetal, and neonatal exposures, such as, mal- and overnutrition, 
stress, infection, xenobiotica, glucocorticoid medication, and so forth, to increased 
long-term risk of developing metabolic, cardiovascular, allergic, mental, reproductive, 
malign, and, in general, disorders and diseases associated with modern lifestyle, even 
independently from classical genetic dispositions. Consequently, all of this may open 
important new chances and challenges of perinatal medicine for a primary prevention 
of long-term health risks globally and, moreover, sharpens our view on fundamental 
mechanisms of developmental processes and ontogenesis, in general.
I am very grateful to many people for enabling this volume. First, I would like to thank 
the authors for their engaged cooperation, providing pioneer work up to very timely 

xii    Foreword
issues, which make this book a ‘State-of-the-Art’ summary. Especially, I would like to 
thank my long-term scientiﬁ c co-worker Thomas Harder, MD, MScE, for many hours 
of highly reliable editorial work on the book manuscript. Many thanks must go to Elke 
Rodekamp, MD, for valuable assistance in organizing the respective meeting. Last but 
not least, I would like to express my personal gratitude to Günter Dörner, MD, for many 
years of creative collaboration and discussions on the overall topic, and Joachim W. 
Dudenhausen, MD, FRCOG, and Cornelius Frömmel, MD, for enabling the continua-
tion of our research work at the Charité, Berlin, during recent years.
Aiming to promote the idea and ﬁ eld of epigenetic, environmentally determined 
early development, ontogenesis, and, consequently, prevention, I would like to express 
my sincere hope that this book will ﬁ nd a wide circulation and reﬂ ection.

1 The past and future of perinatal medicine
Joachim W. Dudenhausen
Although perinatal medicine is as old as humanity, this designation was not used until 
the second half of the 20th century. However, during thousands of years, healers, sha-
mans, doctors, priests, physicians, and midwives strove to help the women that were in 
the childbirth process. Up to the 19th century, some reliable sources were known about 
affections of women, for example, from Soranus of Ephesus and Galen. The 19th cen-
tury was marked by progress of surgery, the increased use of anesthesia, and the ﬁ ght 
against puerperal fever. Scientists such as Adolphe Pinard, who invented the instrument 
that carries his name; Christian Doppler, who established the physical effect known 
after his name; and Etienne Tarnier, who invented the traction forceps in obstetrics, are 
representatives of these decades.
Since 1950, an increase of basic and clinical investigation on normal and risk preg-
nancy has occurred in the developed world. New knowledge about physiology and 
pathophysiology of the pregnant woman, fetus, and newborn and the development of 
new techniques and methods led to the birth of a new interdisciplinary subspecialty: 
perinatal medicine .
In the scientiﬁ c era of medical knowledge, perinatal medicine can be said to have 
ﬁ ve highlight moments: (1) the auscultation of the fetal heart beats by Le Jumeau de 
Kergaradec in 1821; (2) the entering of the amniotic cavity by Bevis in 1952; (3) the 
introduction of labor monitoring and fetal heart rate monitoring by Roberto Caldeyro-
Barcia in 1956 and Konrad Hammacher in 1962; (4) the study of fetal acid-base balance 
and chemical monitoring of the fetus during labor by Erich Saling in 1962 in Berlin; and 
(5) the use of ultrasonography in obstetrics by Ian Donald in 1965. The international 
cooperation in perinatal medicine of these days in the middle of the 20th century was 
demonstrated at the symposium ‘Effects of Labor on the Fetus and the Newborn’ held 
October 1–3, 1964, in Montevideo/Uruguay (XFig. 1.1).
Besides Montevideo, New York, and other cities of the world, the focus on child 
health in obstetrics  was developed in Berlin. We credit Erich Saling with the focus 
on the child and the collaboration with pediatricians, which thereby created perinatal 
medicine (Saling, 1966, 1968).
In the second half of the last century perinatal scientists like Günter Dörner in Berlin 
have found that intercellular messengers such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and cy-
tokines are capable of programming central nervous controllers during perinatal brain 
organization (Dörner et al., 1986).
In the meantime, perinatal medicine is becoming one of the biggest interdisciplinary 
new ﬁ elds of human medicine. Not only are obstetricians and neonatologists explor-
ing the up-to-now unknown intrauterine space intensively, but also other disciplines 
of medicine are joining them and discovering the intrauterine compartment from their 
point of view in order to ﬁ nd out which features are of particular importance for the later 
stages of human health.

2    1 The past and future of perinatal medicine
Each year, 600,000 women around the world die during pregnancy, in childbed, or as 
a result of unsafe abortion. Of these deaths, 99% occur in developing countries. Over 
the past 15 years, this ﬁ gure has remained the same – this is an outrage that nobody can 
accept, and the tragedy of it is that the majority of these deaths could have been and 
could be avoided.
Poverty  is one of the most serious causes of illness, and illness is one of the most 
serious causes of poverty. An absolute necessity for interrupting this cycle is better edu-
cation . Therefore, information campaigns and prevention are cornerstones of our work 
in perinatal medicine. We must work toward strategies and their deployment all over 
the world to provide mothers and children with access to better education and, thereby, 
to improve their health status (Dudenhausen, 2009).
Looking around our world, we are all aware that the problems and challenges we 
face in perinatal medicine differ from one region to the next. At the same time, there 
are other tasks that we must address on a global level. The various regions of the world, 
with their different health care systems and different demands for health care, are look-
ing for different solutions from us in perinatal medicine. Looking at the basic sciences, 
the insights we gain today may serve the global solutions of tomorrow. That is why we 
should meet and discuss ideas to get inspiration so that we get to a point where high-
tech medicine inﬂ uences basic care levels and where clinicians and scientists learn 
from each other.
From another perspective, perinatal medicine is confronted with changes in human 
reproductive behavior. The changes in established social structures and the accessibility

On the other hand, in certain regions of the world, families are started at an increasingly 
later age, and fewer children are born. In 1970, the average age of a woman in Europe 
giving birth to her ﬁ rst child was 24 years; in 2002, it was 29 years.
While families are started later, they are completed earlier: in the 1960s, during the 
time of the so-called baby boom in Germany, an average family had three to four chil-
dren. In 2005 the fertility rate  was 1.3 children. Whether we regret or welcome this 
decline in the birth rate, the fact is that its consequences will affect perinatal medicine 
in the future. The application of reproductive medicine, the numbers of multiple preg-
nancies, intrauterine programming, and primary prevention in obstetrics are all aspects 
that will be the main focus in the future.

2 Perinatal brain programming and functional teratology
Günter Dörner
Three hundred years ago the Charité was founded, 200 years ago the Humboldt Uni-
versity was founded, and about 100 years ago Selmar Aschheim (XFig. 2.1A, left) began 
here in our laboratories to investigate problems of reproductive and sexual endocri-
nology . These studies, carried out in collaboration with Bernhard Zondek (XFig. 2.1A, 
right), led to the detection of large amounts of estrogens in the urine of pregnant women 
and, hence, to the isolation and elucidation of the chemical structure and synthesis of 
estrogens by Butenandt and Doisy, who received the Nobel Prize. Moreover, the discov-
ery of gonadotrophins (human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG], follicle-stimulating hor-
mone [FSH], and luteinizing hormone [LH]) and the development of the ﬁ rst  bioassay 
for detection of early pregnancy were achieved (Aschheim-Zondek-Test).
In 1945 Walter Hohlweg came from Steinach in Vienna and the Schering AG Berlin 
as successor of Aschheim to the Charité, and in 1951 he founded the Institute of Experi-
mental Endocrinology  (XFig. 2.1B). During that time, my teacher Hohlweg (XFig. 2.1C, 
left) made a number of outstanding discoveries in sexual endocrinology, for example, 
(a) the discovery of a gonadotrophin regulating sex center in the brain, (b) the ﬁ rst devel-
opment of orally active estrogens and progestagens in collaboration with H. Inhoffen, 
and (c) the detection of the ovulation-inducing positive estrogen feedback effect for LH 
(Hohlweg-Effect )
After erection of the Berlin wall in 1961, Hohlweg returned to his home country, 
Austria, and I was appointed Professor and Director of the Institute of Experimental 
Endocrinology. During decades of research, we could demonstrate by extensive experi-
mental, clinical, and epidemiological investigations that hormones , neurotransmitters , 
and cytokines  are not only regulators of fundamental processes of life; in critical, mostly 
pre- and early postnatal developmental periods, they are organizers and programmers 
of their own life-long controllers within the neuro-endocrine-immune system  (NEIS). 
By neurotransmitters and neurohormones, the brain – as central nervous controller of 
the NEIS – acts on the endocrine and immune system. The endocrine system interacts 
via hormones with the nervous and immune system, while the immune system, by 
cytokines and antibodies, acts on the nervous and endocrine system (XFig. 2.2).
Life is based on ontogenetic interactions between genes and the environment. In 
higher organisms these interactions are controlled by the NEIS. Here, neurotransmitters, 
hormones, and cytokines are mediators between the environment and the genes and 
can decisively affect gene expression. Most of all, during critical pre- and early postna-
tal organization periods, neurotransmitters, hormones, and cytokines codetermine, by 
means of their environment-dependent quantities, the life-long qualities of their own 
controllers. Thus, a pre- and early postnatal programming  and self-organization  of the 
brain and NEIS does occur, that is, an environment-dependent predetermination of their 
functional and tolerance ranges for the total life (ontogenetic basic rule ). Accordingly, we 
could demonstrate that unphysiological concentrations of neurotransmitters, hormones,

and cytokines during brain organization give rise to dysfunctions and important diseases 
in later life, which means they can act as endogenous functional teratogens. Conse-
quently, developmental neuro-endocrine-immunology  and functional teratology  were 
introduced (Dörner 1975, 1976).
In addition to the ontogenetic basic rule mentioned before, in the last 3 decades I have 
published 10 ontogenetic theses and recommendations for a neuro-endocrine-immune 
prophylaxis. They propagate most of all a pre- and early postnatal optimization of the 
natural and psychosocial environment. Consequently, unphysiological concentrations 
of neurotransmitters, hormones, and cytokines can be prevented as endogenous func-
tional teratogens of the NEIS. Such prevention is also possible by timely correction of 
genetically conditioned unphysiological concentrations of these chemical messengers 
(Dörner 1975, 1976; Dörner et al., 2001).
As early as 1974, I reported about our epigenetic ﬁ ndings at an International Confer-
ence on ‘Neurobiology of CNS-Hormone Interactions’ in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, 
USA, and in 1976 in Halle, Germany, as member of the German Academy Leopoldina. 
In the USA, our scientiﬁ c results were remarkably acknowledged and were used as a 
basis to promote the foundation of epigenetic centers and of a task force for improved 
cooperation between geneticists and environmental physicians.
In East-Germany, we could achieve the following results:
1.  Introduction of a ‘baby-year’. That means, since 1976 mothers could take a 1-year 
long maternity leave with continuation of the full salary after the birth of a second 
or following child, since 1986 already after the birth of the ﬁ rst child, and after 
the birth of the third child even for 1½ years. Due to these measures, mental and 
psychosocial capacities of children could be signiﬁ cantly increased. In animal 
experiments, we could demonstrate that early postnatal maternal psychosocial 
deprivation is followed by a decrease of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine during 
brain organization and life-long diminished mental capacity (Dörner et al., 2008).
2.  By means of improved diagnosis and therapy of gestational diabetes  we could 
prevent fetal hyperinsulinism and reduce the prevalence of childhood-onset 
diabetes  to less than one-third. In animal experiments, we had shown that perinatal 
hyperinsulinism can result in diabetes mellitus, and this effect appeared to be even

heritable through the maternal line (Dörner and Plagemann, 1994). Most recently, 
diabetes mellitus was recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the 
ﬁ rst and only noncommunicable disease to be considered as threat to mankind.
3.  By means of increased breast-feeding  rates in connection with the ‘baby-year’ 
and prevention of overnutrition during the ﬁ rst 3 months of postnatal life we 
could reduce the development of obesity in children and juveniles by more than 
one-third (Dörner et al., 2008).
Recently, the president of the general health insurance company in Germany (AOK) 
reported that the successive diseases of childhood- and juvenile-onset obesity may cost 
about 70 billions Euros annually for the Federal Republic of Germany.
On the other hand, we could not prevent the application of the insecticide DDT, 
which resulted in a clear reduction of birth rates in East-Germany, caused by signiﬁ -
cantly increased disturbances of spermiogenesis as well as increased rates of polycystic 
ovaries.
Furthermore, I suggested four decades ago that we should recognize hetero-, bi-, 
and homosexuality as natural variations of sexual orientation because they are based 
on various sex-hormone and neurotransmitter concentrations during sexual brain 
organization. Hence, homosexuality could and should no longer be prosecuted and 
considered as a disease.
Thus, I achieved the total cancellation of prosecution of homosexuality in East-
Germany and, by counselling the parliament, also in New Zealand during the 1980s. 
This was followed by a worldwide liberalization of the legislation for homosexuality 
during the following decades. In 1989, at the World Conference for Perinatal Psychol-
ogy and Medicine in Jerusalem, I also proposed the cancellation of homosexuality from 
the register of diseases of the WHO, and this was realized soon afterwards. Magnus 
Hirschfeld introduced his unfulﬁ lled guiding principle ‘per scientia ad iustitiam’, which 
I would like to extend to ‘per scientia ad veritatem, sanitatem, et iustitiam’ (per science 
to truth, health, and justice).
As early as in 1985, we organized in East-Berlin an International Symposium titled 
‘Systemic Hormones, Neurotransmitters and Brain Development’. The proceedings 
of this conference already contain some of the most important ﬁ ndings on ‘Develop-
mental Neuro-Endocrine-Immunology’ to understand the importance of environment- 
dependent developmental processes for human epigenesis and global health (Dörner 
et al., 1986).
Already in this context, I have published the following 10 ontogenetic theses  and 
recommendations for promotion of health and prevention or correction of unphysi-
ological concentrations of systemic hormones and/or neurotransmitters during brain or-
ganization, that is, by prevention or correction of the following unfavorable conditions 
during pre- and/or early postnatal life: (1) iodine deﬁ ciency; (2) hyperinsulinism, mostly 
induced by gestational diabetes; (3) hypoxia; (4) stress; (5) placental insufﬁ ciency and 
other gestational disorders; (6) quantitative and/or qualitative malnutrition; (7) radia-
tion and pollution by environmental chemicals; (8) abuse of drugs, hormones, alcohol, 
and nicotine; (9) psychosocial deprivation; and (10) abnormal levels of systemic hor-
mones and/or neurotransmitters, induced by genetic defects (e.g., congenital hypothy-
roidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, phenylketonuria, and other inborn errors of 
metabolism) (Dörner, 2000).

2 Perinatal brain programming and functional teratology    9
In June 2000, Bill Clinton, Craig Venter, and Francis Collins declared the rough 
chemical elucidation of the human gene code as a great turning point in the history 
of mankind. Shortly before, in January of the same year, I had emphasized at a Par-
liamentary Evening in Berlin the importance of the pre- and early postnatal natural 
and psychosocial environments, which, during the critical organization period of the 
NEIS, codetermine the life-long capacities of body and mind, especially by perinatal 
 programming of the brain as controller of the NEIS.
Meanwhile, the great importance of the epigenetic code for ontogenesis, which I 
have postulated since the 1970s as the beginning of the transition from structural to 
functional genomics, becomes also generally acknowledged by the geneticists. It is 
ﬁ nally based on methylation  of DNA, histone modiﬁ cations, and RNA-interference by 
micro-RNA.
In 2001 – some years after the publication of our 10 theses for perinatal promo-
tion of health and prevention of important diseases – the International Society for 
 Developmental Origins of Health and Disease was founded.
In November 2009, the sixth World Congress of this Society was organized, titled 
‘From Developmental Biology to Global Health’, similar to what we had postulated 
since the 1970s.
In 2003, the European Society for Primal Health Care was founded, which has sup-
ported our recommendations for a pre- and early postnatal neuro-endocrine-immune 
prophylaxis in all European countries.
Today, I can ascertain that due to primary neuro-endocrine-immune prophylaxis the 
ontogenesis of millions of human beings could meanwhile be improved. Furthermore, 
by improving ontogenesis, socio- and phylogenesis are also improved and vice versa 
(XFig. 2.3). Consequently, primary neuro-endocrine-immune prophylaxis is not only a 
possibility for prevention of medical maldevelopments, but also of sociocultural and 
even economic maldevelopments.
Recently, on the occasion of my 80th birthday, I received a letter from the Presi-
dent of the Leopoldina Prof. Volker ter Meulen, in which the hope was expressed that 
our ontogenetic theses, which represent the basic rules for protection and optimal  
development of progressing life, may also be taken into account for future legislation.
I would like to mention, that our successful research work was only possible with 
excellent co-workers, for example, Andreas Plagemann, Fritz Stahl, Franziska Götz, 
Wolfgang Rohde, Rolf Lindner, and Renate Tönjes; special technical assistants and

Finally, I have to emphasize that the worldwide acknowledgement of the importance 
of perinatal brain programming , functional teratology , and primary neuro-endocrine-
immune prophylaxis  and their beneﬁ cial clinical utilizations was only possible by the 
excellent research work of outstanding experts in many countries. I am very pleased that 
many of them gave lectures at this International meeting on ‘Perinatal Programming – The 
State of the Art’ and celebrate with us the bi- and tricentenary of  Humboldt-University

3  Experimental models of low birth weight – insight 
into the developmental programming of metabolic 
health, aging and immune function
Chantal A. A. Heppolette, Donald Palmer, and Susan E. Ozanne
The thrifty phenotype hypothesis states that nutrition in utero can program irreversible 
metabolic changes in the fetus and subsequently inﬂ uence the risk of developing metabolic 
syndrome and associated diseases in adulthood. These include cardiovascular disease, type 
2 diabetes and hypertension. Animal studies using nutritional, surgical and pharmacological 
manipulations, have shown that a suboptimal fetal environment can result in fetal growth 
retardation, subsequent low birth weight and alterations in body composition and metabo-
lism. These predispose offspring to a poor metabolic proﬁ le in later life, especially when they 
experience rapid early postnatal growth and an obesogenic environment. Recent evidence 
suggests a wider range of conditions resulting from such developmental programming. These 
include mental health, osteoporosis, immune function and even the aging process. It is also 
now apparent that a wider range of exposures during gestation in addition to nutrition, can 
inﬂ uence long term health and not necessarily through changes in fetal growth. This paper re-
views the current evidence for the role of developmental programming in metabolic diseases, 
aging and immune function.
3.1  Developmental programming and the metabolic 
syndrome in humans
The global pandemic of metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes  (T2D), obesity  and 
cardiovascular disease  (CVD) have devastating consequences on human morbidity, 
mortality and quality of life, in addition to the economic strain on healthcare systems. 
The population shift towards a demographic of a higher obesogenic phenotype in the 
relatively short time span of two generations, suggests that it is driven by environmental 
factors rather than genetic contributions. Whilst current environment for the individual 
is accepted as having a crucial impact on their health, accumulating evidence sug-
gests that early environmental factors such as nutritional and environmental imbalances 
in utero and in early postnatal life play a vital role in determining the long-term health 
of an individual.
3.2 The thrifty phenotype hypothesis 
Epidemiological studies by Anders Forsdahl in Norway were the ﬁ rst to suggest a 
 causative link between early life environmental factors and disease in later life (Forsdahl, 

12    3 Experimental models of low birth weight
1977). Here a positive correlation was found between mortality from atherosclerotic 
heart disease in individuals aged between 40 and 69, and infant mortality (used as an 
index of quality of life) in the same county (Forsdahl, 1977). Later studies by Barker 
outlined the detrimental effect of poverty, poor nutrition and maternal health on in-
fant mortality and risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Barker and Osmond, 1986). 
Through studies of UK cohorts Barker and colleagues demonstrated a link between low 
birth weight  and subsequent CVD, indicative of an important role played by the fetal 
environment (Barker, 1995).
The thrifty phenotype hypothesis (or Barker hypothesis to which it is often referred) 
was proposed in 1992 by Hales and Barker to provide a mechanistic framework by 
which the early environment, and in particular early nutrition affects long-term health. 
It is outlined in XFig. 3.1.
It suggests that a growing fetus when subjected to limited nutrition undergoes an 
adaptive response, whereby the growth of crucial organs such as the brain is maintained 
at the expense of the viscera such as the endocrine pancreas. In addition metabolism 
is programmed to promote nutrient storage to maximise its chance of survival. Conse-
quentially the structure and function of the body is altered (Hales and Barker, 1992). 
However these adaptations can become detrimental if the postnatal environment differs 
to that experienced in utero. This is especially evident when malnutrition  in utero is 
followed by adequate or over-nutrition postnatally. The reduced endocrine pancreatic 
mass  and altered muscle and fat metabolism are unable to deal appropriately with 
relative over-nourishment and conditions including the metabolic syndrome, type 2 
diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension can ensue (Hales and 
Barker, 1992). The metabolic syndrome  involves the onset of visceral obesity, hypertri-
glyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol, hypertension, fasting hyperglycemia and insulin 
resistance.

3.2.1 Signiﬁ cance of low birth weight 
Birth weight is a key indicator of growth in utero. In normal pregnancy birth weight is 
highly variable and inﬂ uenced more heavily by the intra-uterine environment than the 
genome (Carr-Hill et al., 1987). This is demonstrated by studies showing that the birth 
weights of half siblings have a correlation coefﬁ cient of 0.1 when sharing the same 
father and 0.58 when sharing the same mother (Carr-Hill et al., 1987). The growth rate 
of a fetus is limited by its supply of nutrition and oxygen, so maternal malnutrition 
and placental disruption can therefore result in low birth weight. Additional markers 
of malnutrition include disproportionate head circumference, body length and weight.
Low birth weight is considered a signiﬁ cant risk factor for T2D, CVD and the metabolic 
syndrome  (Hales and Barker, 2001; Lindsay and Bennett, 2001). The Hertfordshire study 
of 64 year old males, was the ﬁ rst to demonstrate that low birth weight increases the 
susceptibility towards T2D and metabolic syndrome, where no threshold level of birth 
weight was evident (Hales et al., 1991). Such ﬁ ndings have been repeated in numerous 
countries worldwide. The Dutch famine , which occurred from November 1944 to May 
1945, provided direct evidence that maternal nutrition can inﬂ uence fetal growth and 
long term health. This demonstrated that individuals in utero at this time had lower birth 
weights and increased plasma glucose concentration and increased fasting pro-insulin 
concentration, amounting to increased insulin resistance by age 50 (Ravelli et al., 1998). 
Their growth had accelerated after the famine when their nutritional environment was 
restored. This is indicative of catch-up growth which predisposes individuals towards 
metabolic syndrome (Ravelli et al., 1998). It has since been demonstrated that famine 
during early gestation alters fetal lipid metabolism whereas when this insult occurs 
during mid to late gestation, glucose/insulin metabolism is affected (Ravelli et al., 1998). 
The Leningrad famine  occurred between 1941 and 1944 so the period of malnutrition  
was prolonged and accelerated catch-up growth did not occur (Stanner and Yudkin, 
2001). Consequentially the association between famine exposure and altered glucose/
insulin metabolism was not statistically signiﬁ cant, although this study was also weak in 
statistical power (Stanner and Yudkin, 2001). An association between catch-up growth  
and increased mortality from CVD has also been demonstrated (Eriksson et al., 1999). 
Further studies from UK cohorts showed similar associations between low birth weight 
and adult central adiposity using DEXA scanning (Kensara et al., 2005).
Twin studies provide a key insight into the signiﬁ cance of in utero environmental 
inﬂ uences on birth weight on developmental programming as they negate confound-
ing genetic and maternal factors. Even though on average twins are born of a lower 
weight compared to singleton counterparts, they do not have a higher incidence 
of cardiovascular-related mortality (Christensen et al., 2001; de Geus et al., 2001). 
However a recent study of monozygotic and dizygotic twins born between 1926 and 
1958 revealed a negative correlation between birth weight and blood pressure inde-
pendent of genetic factors (Bergvall et al., 2007). In a retrospective study in Denmark 
involving monozygotic and dizygotic twins  discordant for T2D and impaired glucose 
tolerance, birth weights were lower in those individuals who suffered from T2D and 
impaired glucose tolerance (Poulsen et al., 1997). Twin studies have also demonstrated 
a negative relationship between birth weight and unhealthy body composition charac-
teristics such as waist-to-hip ratio, skin-fold thickness and reduced muscle mass (Loos 
et al., 2001).

14    3 Experimental models of low birth weight
3.2.2 High birth weight and maternal obesity  in humans
Elevated birth weight can be equally detrimental to the health of the child in later 
life as low birth weight (Catalano et al., 2003). There is growing interest in maternal 
hypernutrition given the rise in birth weights and incidence of “large for gestational age” 
(LGA) babies in developed countries (Surkan et al., 2004). Studies in more contempo-
rary populations have shown that a U- or J-shaped association can exist between birth 
weight and obesity and T2D in later life. This especially occurs in cultures where T2D 
is prevalent in the population, for example in the Pima  Arizonian Indians (McCance 
et al., 1994).
Various factors are considered inﬂ uential in overweight births including maternal 
obesity, maternal hypernutrition, maternal hyperglycaemia and pre-pregnancy maternal 
body composition (Sacks et al., 2006). Children born of mothers who were obese prior 
to pregnancy have a tendency towards being overweight in childhood, and this is a key 
predictor of obesity in adulthood (Field et al., 2005). Although this could be explained 
by genetic inheritance, a further study reported that moderate weight gain between suc-
cessive pregnancies resulted in more complications such as LGA births (Villamor and 
Cnattingius, 2006). Offspring of obese women and those with gestational diabetes, are 
themselves more likely to have greater neonatal fat, develop insulin resistance, become 
obese in later life and have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome  (Catalano et al., 
2003). Sibling pair studies in the Pima Arizonian Indian population, where siblings were 
discordant for maternal diabetes, show a strong offspring diabetic and obesogenic trait 
acquired in pregnancy (Dabelea and Pettitt, 2001).
3.2.3 Effects of early postnatal nutrition
In addition to the environment in utero, nutrition and subsequent growth during the early 
postnatal period can also have signiﬁ cant effects on long-term health. McCance was the 
ﬁ rst to observe an effect of early infant malnutrition on susceptibility to infection in rats 
(McCance, 1962). Since then there have been numerous animal studies demonstrating 
that early nutrition can permanently inﬂ uence blood lipids levels, insulin levels, blood 
pressure, body fat proportion, atherosclerosis, behaviour, learning and longevity (Hahn, 
1984; Lewis et al., 1986; McCance, 1962; Ozanne and Hales, 2004). Human studies 
have been implemented in order to investigate the nutritional programming effects of 
breast milk  and formula milk on long term health (Lucas, 2005). Preterm infants fed 
human breast milk have reduced incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in comparison 
to those fed formula milk (Lucas and Cole, 1990). This effect was most dramatic in 
infants born after 30 weeks of gestation when other risk factors were diminished (Lucas 
and Cole, 1990).
Cardiovascular disease is affected by both the type and composition of milk during 
lactation, which in turn inﬂ uences postnatal growth (Lucas, 2005). Retrospective studies 
have shown that breast-fed infants have reduced risk of CVD, hypercholesterolemia, 
obesity, T2D and hypertension compared to formula fed infants (Lucas, 2005). Such 
effects could be due to socio-biological confounding factors so intervention trials have 
been implemented in order to overcome these. Here pre-term infants whose mothers 
chose not to breast feed, were randomly assigned to either human milk from donor 
mothers or formula milk (Singhal et al., 2004). Those infants fed human milk for at least 

3.3 Evidence for developmental programming of the metabolic syndrome    15
one month had reduced blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, leptin resistance and insulin 
resistance in comparison to those fed formula milk  (Singhal et al., 2004). These effects 
were still observed 13–16 years post intervention and the greater the consumption of 
breast milk during the neonatal period, the lower the risk factor status in later life (Sing-
hal et al., 2004). In summary these observational studies and intervention trials provide 
compelling evidence suggesting that the intake of breast milk in infancy reduces the risk 
of metabolic syndrome in later life.
These trials also compared the effects of enriched and standard formula on preterm 
infants and found that infants fed the growth-promoting enriched formula showed in-
creased cardiovascular risk factors in later childhood (Singhal et al., 2004). However 
preterm infants fed enriched formula had better neurocognitive functioning and reduced 
risk of degenerative bone disease in later life compared to those fed standard formula 
(Lucas, 2005). In a separate study full term infants who were small for gestational age 
were given growth-promoting formula and had elevated diastolic blood pressure  6–8 
years following the study, compared to those fed standard formula (Singhal and Lucas, 
2004). More recently a clinical trial was performed where full term infants whose moth-
ers chose to formula feed, were randomized to receive formula milk with either high 
or low protein content. Those fed the high protein milk had greater weight gain, which 
suggests that low protein feeding in infancy may protect against later obesity  (Koletzko 
et al., 2009).
3.3  Evidence for developmental programming of the metabolic 
syndrome from animal models
Animal models  can further our understanding of developmental programming and have 
provided direct evidence for the effect of the early environment on long term health. 
Such models include maternal calorie restriction, low protein, hypernutrition and obe-
sity, vitamin restriction, hyperglycemia, hypoxia, iron restriction, psychological stress, 
intrauterine artery ligation and dexamethasone treatment amongst others. Despite the 
multitudinal possible insults to the fetus, the phenotypic outcomes are fairly similar, 
suggesting common mechanisms underlying these changes.
3.3.1 Calorie restriction and malnutrition
Maternal malnutrition during critical periods of development in utero has various effects 
on offspring, including predisposing towards the development of the metabolic syn-
drome. The concept of implementing maternal malnutrition to programme adult disease 
began with Winick and Noble who observed that malnutrition during fetal development 
resulted in reduced pancreatic cell number (Winick and Noble, 1966). The timing of the 
insult is crucial, as revealed by animal models where malnutrition during early gesta-
tion results in small well proportioned babies, but neonates with malnutrition during 
late gestation have normal weight with altered proportions (Widdowson and McCance, 
1975).
Maternal calorie restriction  (CR) can alter the programming of adipocyte metabo-
lism and body composition which later predisposes towards obesity  (Bispham et al., 
2005). For example sheep of low birth weight  have a higher neonatal fat proportion, 

16    3 Experimental models of low birth weight
compared to sheep of higher birth weight (Greenwood et al., 1998). This is especially 
evident when the insult of nutrient restriction is administered during the period of op-
timal placental growth, again implying a sensitive time window for exposure (Budge 
et al., 2005). 30% reduction in food intake during gestation in rodents severely impairs 
fetal growth and predisposes towards adulthood hypertension, elevated fasting plasma 
insulin concentration, glucose intolerance and heightened food intake in later life (Vick-
ers et al., 2000). Wistar rats fed a 50% calorie restricted diet from day 15 of pregnancy 
gradually lost glucose tolerance , and insulinopenia and loss of β-cell mass was evident 
with age (Garofano et al., 1999). Severe (70%) maternal CR in Wistar rats led to altered 
plasma insulin at birth and hypertension  in adulthood (Woodall et al., 1996).
Effects are exacerbated when an intra-uterine calorie restricted diet is followed by 
postnatal hypernutrition (Budge et al., 2005). For example rodents subjected to moder-
ate (50%) and severe (70%) prenatal caloric restriction, have high fat deposition when 
given a hypercaloric or high fat diet postnatally (Vickers et al., 2000).
3.3.2 The maternal low protein (MLP) diet
The availability of protein is a key determinant of fetal growth. Amino acids determine 
pancreatic β cell differentiation, replication and insulin secretion and as insulin acts as 
a crucial growth factor in the fetus, protein indirectly inﬂ uences the rate of fetal growth 
(Hales and Barker, 1992). The earliest investigation into the Maternal Low Protein  (MLP) 
diet was led by Weinkove who demonstrated that perinatal and postnatal low protein 
diets produced permanently impaired insulin secretion  (Weinkove et al., 1974). Since 
then MLP diets have been used to explore the links between fetal malnutrition and im-
paired growth and subsequent CVD, T2D and associated pathologies. For example, a low 
protein diet during gestation results in a programmed increase in postnatal  production 
of enzymes for glucose synthesis even when the postnatal diet is normal (Desai et al., 
1995). Rats fed a MLP diet during gestation have low birth weight, evidence of growth 
restriction in utero. If followed by the same diet during lactation permanent growth-
restriction results and this is maintained into adulthood (Desai et al., 1996).
An MLP diet restricts fetal growth and has a permanent effect on offspring health 
(Langley and Jackson, 1994). As in human studies, MLP insults have sensitive time 
windows . Maternal protein restriction during pregnancy and lactation results in hyper-
tension and an age-dependent loss of glucose tolerance  which is especially evident in 
male offspring (Petry et al., 2001). This is associated with β-cell dysfunction and insulin 
resistance . More recently Kwong et al showed that rat dams fed a low protein diet of 
9% from conception through to implantation followed by standard chow resulted in 
offspring developing elevated glucose levels by day 4 and hypertension in adulthood 
(Kwong et al., 2000).
The MLP rat model has been modiﬁ ed giving recuperated (Recup) and postnatal 
low protein (PLP) diets which enable us to identify critical time windows of nutritional 
programming  (Ozanne, 2001). In this model recuperated rats are fed a low protein diet  
of 8% during pregnancy which results in low birth weight, then cross-fostered during 
lactation to a mother fed a control diet containing 20% protein (Desai et al., 1996). By 
weaning at 21 days these Recup animals have similar body weights to controls as they 
have undergone catch-up growth ( Jennings et al., 1999). This increases stress in the in-
dividual and its long-term effects include elevated fasting glucose concentration, β-cell 

3.3 Evidence for developmental programming of the metabolic syndrome    17
dysfunction and increased susceptibility to T2D  and vascular dysfunction (Tarry-Adkins 
et al., 2008). Postnatal low protein (PLP) rats are fed a normal protein diet (20%) dur-
ing pregnancy then cross-fostered during lactation to a mother fed a low protein diet 
(8%) until weaning where their diet is restored to normal levels (Ozanne and Hales, 
2004). These offspring undergo slow early growth during the suckling period and long-
term effects include enhanced insulin sensitivity, reduced insulin and glucose con-
centration, dampened albuminuria and reduced susceptibility to CVD (Tarry-Adkins 
et al., 2008).
3.3.3 Maternal iron deﬁ ciency
Iron deﬁ ciency anemia occurs when iron absorption is insufﬁ cient, usually due to 
depleted dietary levels, resulting in reduced formation of hemoglobin. Maternal hemo-
globin levels are associated with offspring birth weight and preterm birth in a U-shaped 
relationship (Rasmussen, 2001). A similar relationship is likely to occur between 
haemoglobin levels and perinatal mortality although this is not yet fully established. 
Iron deﬁ ciency anemia results in defective placental vascularisation and dysregula-
tion of maternal and fetal hormones such as IGF-1  and cortico-releasing hormone, 
which when elevated, can induce preterm labor and pre-eclampsia, and inhibition 
of IGF-1 production, resulting in defective fetal development (Rasmussen, 2001). This 
was shown in a rodent model of maternal iron restriction, where offspring also had el-
evated blood pressure by 40 days of age, in addition to having low birth weights (Lewis 
et al., 2002). Further maternal iron restriction studies have shown increased glucose 
tolerance  and fasting serum triglyceride in 3 month old rats subjected to maternal iron 
restriction although these effects were not maintained through to late adulthood (Lewis 
et al., 2001).
3.3.4 Intrauterine artery ligation
The fetal environment in humans is severely impaired by placental disruption caused 
by maternal smoking, pre-eclampsia and abnormal placenta development (Baschat and 
Hecher, 2004). Uteroplacental insufﬁ ciency  is occurring more commonly in western 
society and results in disrupted fetal growth and subsequently low birth weight (Baschat 
and Hecher, 2004). Thus animal models have been engineered to study such effects 
on offspring. For example fetuses from maternal bilateral uterine artery ligation s were 
hypoxic, hypoglycemic, with dampened insulin and IGF-1 levels (Ogata et al., 1986). 
Uteroplacental insufﬁ ciency also leads to poor development of the pancreas, liver and 
kidney, and can result in T2D and gender-speciﬁ c development of hypertension in adult 
life (De Prins and Van Assche, 1982; Merlet-Benichou et al., 1994; Moritz et al., 2009; 
Vuguin et al., 2004).
3.3.5 Maternal glucocorticoid exposure
Fetal development is free from glucocorticoid  exposure until the late trimester, where 
upon glucocorticoids stimulate the maturation of tissues and organs (Fowden and For-
head, 2004). Early or overexposure to glucocorticoids results in growth retardation and 

18    3 Experimental models of low birth weight
subsequently low birth weight in offspring (Reynolds et al., 2001). This environment is 
mimicked in animal studies by the administration of dexamethasone, a potent synthetic 
glucocorticoid. Resultantly elevated levels of glucocorticoids especially during the ﬁ nal 
trimester of gestation, predispose offspring towards insulin resistance , glucose intoler-
ance and hypertension  (Benediktsson et al., 1993; Lindsay et al., 1996; Nyirenda et al., 
1998). Glucocorticoids may also provide a link between maternal calorie restriction, 
maternal protein restriction and fetal growth retardation. In these models, glucocorticoid 
levels are elevated (Langley-Evans et al., 1996). However it is important to consider that 
maternal exposure to dexamethasone can dampen maternal food intake (Woods and 
Weeks, 2005).
3.3.6 Models of maternal hypernutrition and maternal obesity
Several studies have demonstrated the signiﬁ cance of hypernutrition during gestation 
and lactation on the subsequent development of obesity in offspring. An early study in 
baboons showed that overfeeding during the pre-weaning stage resulted in an irrevers-
ible increase in adiposity in female offspring via adipocyte hypertrophy (Lewis et al., 
1986). A further study observed an increase in fat pad weight by weaning age in the 
offspring of rats fed a 40% fat diet during pregnancy and lactation (Guo and Jen, 1995). 
Such changes persist into adulthood demonstrated by the increase in body weight 
and visceral fat depot at 6 months in offspring of rat dams fed a 24% fat diet (Khan 
et al., 2004).
Maternal obesity  has also been linked to the programming of other metabolic 
diseases. Offspring exposed to maternal obesity / hypernutrition in utero and during 
lactation develop hypertension , increased adiposity, insulin resistance  and glucose 
intolerance (Samuelsson et al., 2008). A recent study in sheep showed that maternal 
obesity before and during gestation led to impaired glucose and insulin regulation, in 
addition to changes in adiposity in offspring in later life (Long et al., 2010). The effects 
of maternal obesity on the cardiovascular system of offspring have also been observed, 
with the occurrence of hypertension, vascular dysfunction, hypercholesterolemia and 
hyperlipidemia (Drake and Reynolds, 2010; Samuelsson et al., 2008).
3.4 Developmental programming of aging 
Characteristics of the metabolic syndrome are age-associated and there is now evi-
dence for the existence of developmental programming of aging. The maternal low 
protein model in rodents has shown reduced longevity, accelerated aging, and accel-
erated pancreatic islet and kidney telomere shortening  in animals that undergo fetal 
growth restriction and accelerated postnatal catch-up growth  as a result of maternal 
protein restriction ( Jennings et al., 1999; Ozanne and Hales, 2004; Tarry-Adkins et al., 
2008). In contrast slow growth during lactation in rodents results in extended longevity, 
increased antioxidant enzymes, suppressed renal telomere shortening, and fewer aortic 
DNA single strand breaks (Chen et al., 2009a; Ozanne and Hales, 2004; Tarry-Adkins 
et al., 2008). Such ﬁ ndings suggest that pathways of cellular senescence and aging are 
responsive to environmental cues early in life and that the rate of aging is irreversibly 
established at such early time points.

3.5 Developmental programming and immunity    19
3.5 Developmental programming and immunity
Although initial focus of developmental programming was on nutrition and its effects on 
metabolic disease, this has since been expanded to include a range of early exposure 
types and numerous health outcomes. One such area of growing interest is the effects 
of the early environment on the immune system. An efﬁ cient and functional immune 
system is considered vital for the protection against infection, autoimmune diseases 
and tumor growth. These conditions however are more prevalent in the elderly due to 
age-dependent immune deterioration, termed immunosenescence (Aw et al., 2008).
3.5.1  Developmental programming of adaptive immunity  
in humans
Epidemiological data from human studies have shown that in rural Gambia the birth 
season can predict infection-related adult mortality (Collinson et al., 2003). Those 
born during the hungry season where food supplies are limited are more prone to 
infection and have a smaller thymic volume in comparison to those born in the harvest 
season (Collinson et al., 2003). This is also evident in Guinea-Bissau where a reduc-
tion in thymic weight is associated with increased infection-related mortality (Aaby 
et al., 2002). Reports from the Philippines and Pakistan showed a positive correlation 
between birth weight and subsequent antibody response to a polysaccharide antigen 
(McDade et al., 2001). A longer period of breast-feeding was also shown to increase 
thymic volume in infants, which is indicative of increased immune capacity (Moore 
et al., 2009).
3.5.2  Developmental programming of adaptive immunity 
in animal models
Various animal studies have shown that maternal malnutrition during gestation can 
have detrimental effects on thymus  development in the offspring. For example sheep 
offspring whose mothers were malnourished during gestation, have reduced thymic 
mass (Osgerby et al., 2002). Thymic mass and architecture was defective in rat offspring 
given half the feed in utero with consequential dampened cellular and humoral im-
mune responses at 4 months of age (Schuler et al., 2008). Prenatal malnutrition can 
also reduce the secretion of the thymic active hormones such as thymopoietin in rat and 
human offspring (McDade et al., 2001; Schuler et al., 2008).
More recently Odaka and colleagues showed that a maternal high fat diet  in mice can 
cause immune dysfunction  in the offspring (Odaka et al., 2010). A signiﬁ cant reduction 
in thymic cortical thickness and splenocyte count was observed in animals born from 
mothers that were given a high fat diet during gestation. In addition it was observed that 
these animals had an increased level of TNFα production together with an alteration of 
speciﬁ c antibody responses (Odaka et al., 2010). The maternal low protein  model has 
also demonstrated immune effects in offspring. Thymi from mice exposed to maternal 
protein restriction during lactation (PLP) were approximately 50% heavier at 3m than 
at 21d, whereas control animals demonstrated no difference in thymic weight during 
this period (Chen et al., 2009b). PLP thymi also had increased expression of SIRT1, an 
important factor in mediating the positive effects of CR on lifespan, and a reduction in 

20    3 Experimental models of low birth weight
p16, a robust biomarker of cellular ageing (Chen et al., 2009b). This implies a reduction 
in thymic aging in animals that undergo slow early postnatal growth. Prenatal stress  is 
another method of insult with immune programming implications. Shown in rodent and 
pig studies, thymus size, morphology and function is altered by maternal psychological 
stress (Hashimoto et al., 2001; Tuchscherer et al., 2002). Prenatal stress can also lead 
to defective T lymphocyte cell counts and speciﬁ c antigen responses (Gotz et al., 2007; 
Sobrian et al., 1997).
3.5.3 Developmental programming of innate immunity 
Atopic diseases are considered to have a high genetic component but growing evi-
dence suggests a role for the prenatal environment in inﬂ uencing the development of 
conditions such as eczema , hayfever and asthma  (Los et al., 2001). Recent studies in 
Danish and Swedish twins suggest low birth weight to be a signiﬁ cant risk factor for 
the development of childhood asthma (Kindlund et al., 2010). Conversely studies on 
Swedish twins discordant for childhood atopic eczema revealed a positive association 
between birth weight and disease incidence (Lundholm et al., 2010). Maternal intake of 
foods high in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids like ﬁ sh protects against the development 
of such atopic diseases which are positively associated with the maternal intake of foods 
high in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as vegetable and sunﬂ ower oils (Calder 
et al., 2010). These studies indicate that the human innate immune system is susceptible 
to programming, particularly when associated with allergic reactions, although low and 
high fetal growth can have opposing outcomes on different allergies.
In rodents maternal food restriction during gestation and lactation results in elevated 
basal inﬂ ammation but reduced cytokine responses in offspring (Desai et al., 2009). 
Maternal obesity increases macrophage accumulation, inﬂ ammatory cytokines and 
factors of the inﬂ ammatory signaling pathway in placenta of sheep offspring during 
mid- gestation (Zhu et al., 2010). Maternal psychological stress also inhibits the innate 
immune system of offspring, with effects including impaired functioning of  macrophages, 
natural killer cells and neutrophils (Bellinger et al., 2008).
3.6 Conclusions
Observations from both human and animal studies have revealed a variety of maternal 
insults capable of programming a wide range of health outcomes in later life which are 
outlined in XFig. 3.2.
Suboptimal fetal nutrition alters fetal growth resulting in metabolic and structural 
changes in tissues at birth. These are further exacerbated by early postnatal hypernutri-
tion. Changes in the epigenotype have been suggested to play a role in mediating long 
term effects of developmental programming. In addition to the already substantial evi-
dence supporting the role of developmental programming in the metabolic syndrome 
and associated pathologies, there is now growing support for the effect of early life 
environment on developing other conditions. Most diseases affected by developmental 
programming are age-related. Consistent with this observation, growing evidence sug-
gests an effect of prenatal and early postnatal exposures on the structure and function 
of the immune system, which have already been reported to become impaired with age

under normal conditions. Therefore targeting early life as a critical period for optimiza-
tion of nutrition and environment exposures has the potential to maximize the chances 
of the population to age healthily.

4  Cardiovascular consequences of IUGR: 
Experimental aspects
Simon C. Langley-Evans
Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) resulting in low weight at birth (LBW) has long been 
a focus of interest in the context of early life programming of disease. The etiology of IUGR 
in humans is complex, but LBW has widely been interpreted as a marker of maternal under-
nutrition. Varied approaches adopted to limit fetal nutrition in animals have been shown to 
have consistent cardiovascular outcomes across small and large animal species. Offspring of 
animals subject to any form of nutrient restriction during pregnancy manifest raised blood 
pressure in later life and this may be associated with impaired endothelium-dependent and 
independent vasodilation, atherosclerosis and greater susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion 
injury. From a mechanistic perspective it seems likely that a sub-optimal environment during 
organogenesis and tissue maturation results in remodelling of structures involved in cardiovas-
cular functions and regulation of those functions. Unfortunately there is remarkably little data 
that considers the perhaps transient changes to expression of genes, proteins and pathways in 
embryonic and fetal life that may establish permanent changes in tissue structure and func-
tion. It is clear, however, that maternal undernutrition establishes strong cellular memories of 
the initial insults, which continue to exert their inﬂ uence across multiple generations and in 
cell culture. Nutritional effects upon epigenetic markers across the genome are suspected to 
play a key role in establishing such a memory, but to date, few candidate genes with a clear 
cardiovascular function have been shown to be targets for such effects.
4.1 Intrauterine growth retardation  and maternal undernutrition .
Data obtained from historical cohorts of men and women from developed and de-
veloping countries, is suggestive of associations between early life factors and risk of 
cardiovascular disease. In the late 1980’s Barker and colleagues reported that among 
men and women born in Hertfordshire (UK) during the period 1911–1932, coronary 
heart disease mortality (Barker et al., 1989), blood pressure (Barker et al., 1990), oc-
currence of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (Hales et al., 1991) were all 
more prevalent in individuals who were of lower weight at birth. This was a fascinating 
observation and like other similar ﬁ ndings from other cohorts, suggested that factors 
which inﬂ uence growth in utero may also irreversibly inﬂ uence organ development 
and physiological function. A key aspect of these observations was that programming 
of function occurred within the normal range of birthweights and was not dependent 
upon occurrence of preterm birth or what would be regarded as clinically relevant 
intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), resulting in low birthweight  (LBW, weight less 
than 2.5 kg at birth).

28    4 Cardiovascular consequences of IUGR: Experimental aspects 
Whilst fetal growth and eventual weight at birth are heavily determined by genetics, 
and by a wide variety of maternal environmental and lifestyle factors (XFig. 4.1), most 
attention for researchers interested in the early life origins of disease was focused upon 
undernutrition as a possible driver of early life programming. This was an interesting 
choice as the relationship between maternal nutritional status and fetal growth appears 
to be weak in humans (Harding, 2004). Even in populations subjected to severe famine 
situations, average birth weights vary by no more than 20–25%, and when considering 
variation in birth weight across the normal range, the inﬂ uence of maternal nutrition is 
greatly outweighed by factors such as social class, maternal size and maternal physical 
activity. There are few robust studies where estimated intakes of energy or nutrients can 
be related to birth weight or proportions (e.g. length, head circumference, ponderal 
index) in humans (Doyle et al., 1992; Langley-Evans & Langley-Evans, 2003; Mathews 
et al., 1999).
Attempts to demonstrate relationships between maternal nutrient intake in pregnancy 
and long-term cardiovascular function  in the resulting offspring are few and far between 
in the literature (Campbell et al., 1996; Gillman et al., 2004; Godfrey et al., 1994) and 
this is only to be expected given the nature of the problem and the time-span required 
for a properly conducted evaluation. Where such data does exist it can be difﬁ cult to 
interpret. For example Campbell et al. (1996) reported that blood pressures of middle 
aged men were related to their mother’s protein intake, but with the association going 
in opposite directions dependent upon carbohydrate consumption. As stated above, 
there is little in the literature to demonstrate ﬁ rm associations between maternal nutrient 
intakes and birth weight within the normal range. The lack of clear information relating 
limited nutrient intake to long-term consequences should not be surprising given the 
near impossibility of the task of accurately estimating even macronutrient intakes, let 
alone micronutrient intakes, in population studies. Although attractive, searching for 
evidence that maternal intake of protein, or iron or zinc in relation to programming of

Maternal nutritional status is one of a number of different inﬂ uences upon fetal development 
which may adversely impact upon later physiological function and risk of disease in adulthood.

4.2 Long-term cardiovascular consequences of undernutrition    29
disease in humans is perhaps misguided and in this context we could learn a lot from 
the errors made in cancer epidemiology over the last 30 years. A focus on trying to 
break diet-cancer relationships down into simple effects of single nutrients failed to 
take into account the ways in which nutrients interact with each other, with the genes 
carried by individuals and with other risk factors in the environment (Gerber, 2001). It 
is overly simplistic to assume that intakes of a single nutrient are representative of the 
whole range of dietary and environmental exposures experienced by individuals. In the 
cancer ﬁ eld this ultimately led to misguided trials of interventions using antioxidant 
nutrients with disastrous effects upon some participants (Bjelakovic and Gluud, 2007) 
and it is now recognized that whole dietary patterns give a better representation of 
associated risk. The human diet comprises varied mixtures of foods, each providing 
different combinations of nutrients, prepared in a variety of different ways. This means 
that within each food and within each meal, there is considerable scope for interactions 
between nutrients, and between nutrients and the non-nutrient components of food-
stuffs (Gerber, 2001). As such it will be the combinations of factors in the habitual diet of 
any pregnant woman that determine the responses of her developing child, rather than 
intakes of speciﬁ c nutrients or foods.
Despite these problems with epidemiological approaches to investigation of early life 
programming of cardiovascular functions, a wide diversity of experimental models have 
been developed to demonstrate the biological plausibility of programming by maternal 
undernutrition. Such models have enabled the downstream consequences of speciﬁ c 
manipulations of either maternal nutritional status or fetal growth to be characterized 
and provide useful vehicles for studies which aim to identify the mechanistic basis of 
early life programming.
4.2  Long-term cardiovascular consequences of undernutrition: 
Animal models of programming
Although animal models  may over-simplify the relationship between maternal nutri-
tional status and long-term programming, they carry the major advantages of control 
over confounding factors and the ability to sample invasively and across the whole 
lifespan. Models of programming have been reported using a wide range of species 
including small animals (rats, mice and guinea pigs), large animals (sheep and pigs) 
and non-human primates. Diverse nutritional manipulations have been applied during 
pregnancy, pregnancy and lactation and for speciﬁ c periods within pregnancy. Some 
strategies have been designed speciﬁ cally to elicit IUGR, including ligation of the uter-
ine artery (Persson & Jansson, 1992) or placental reduction (Owens et al., 2007), whilst 
others have been used to model a variety of forms of undernutrition, including global 
food restriction (Kind et al. 2002; Vickers et al., 2003; Woodall et al., 1996), micronutri-
ent deﬁ ciency (Gambling et al., 2005) and macronutrient restriction (Langley & Jackson, 
1994; XFig. 4.2). Despite the diversity of approach, the common phenotypic endpoint 
which has been reported in all cases, is raised blood pressure. Vickers and colleagues 
(2003), for example, reported that offspring of rat dams fed just 30% of ad libitum food 
intake were born extremely growth retarded and by 100 days of age were hypertensive. 
The programming effect of maternal undernutrition  on blood pressure was exacerbated 
by postweaning feeding of the offspring with a hypercaloric diet. Gambling et al., (2005) 

30    4 Cardiovascular consequences of IUGR: Experimental aspects 
modelled maternal iron deﬁ ciency anemia by feeding rats a low iron diet prior to and 
during pregnancy. Offspring from these pregnancies exhibited higher blood pressure in 
early adulthood.
The most extensively characterized of all animal models of programming by under-
nutrition involves the feeding of a low protein diet  during pregnancy (Langley and 
Jackson, 1994). Offspring of dams subjected to this relatively mild insult are of normal 
birthweight but exhibit higher blood pressure than controls from the age of weaning 
onwards (Langley-Evans et al., 1996a; 1996b; 1996c). The causes of this hypertension 
appear to be multifactorial and may be partly driven by a deﬁ cit of nephrons  in the 
kidney  (Langley-Evans et al., 1999), by increased peripheral vascular resistance and 
defects of the renin-angiotensin system  (McMullen et al., 2004). It is clear that vascular 
function is abnormal as isolated vessels exhibit blunted vasorelaxation in response to 
acetylcholine and other evidence of endothelial cell dysfunction (Torrens et al., 2006). 
When the hearts from low protein exposed animals are mounted on Langendorff perfu-
sion apparatus and function is monitored ex vivo, they exhibit differences in responses 
to β-agonists and have an impaired recovery following ischemia-reperfusion events 
(Elmes et al., 2007;2008). Many of these effects show sex differences, but the over-
all phenotype that is programmed by maternal protein restriction is consistent with 
 abnormal cardiovascular physiology.
High blood pressure  and endothelial cell dysfunction  are merely risk factors for car-
diovascular disease and are not in themselves disease states. As most of the animal 
models that have been used to assess early life programming of the cardiovascular sys-
tem are based upon rodents, there is very little evidence that maternal undernutrition 
Fig. 4.2: Animal models of cardiovascular programming. A variety of approaches have been 
taken to model the developmental origins of disease. Programming of blood pressure is the 
primary marker of early life inﬂ uences upon the cardiovasculature, and this can be demonstrated 
by manipulation of fetal growth or fetal hormone exposure to generate IUGR. In contrast to these 
extreme approaches, the imposition of both under- and over-nutrition during pregnancy will 
program hypertension in the resulting offspring.

results in endpoints that are representative of the observed associations between early 
life factors and coronary heart disease and coronary mortality in humans. The trans-
genic apo E*3 Leiden mouse  carries a mutated version of the human apo E3 gene and 
develops atherosclerosis  if fed a cholesterol containing atherogenic diet. This is a useful 
model to consider inﬂ uences upon the development of atherosclerotic disease (Yates 
et al., 2008). When male apo E*3 Leiden mice were mated with wild type females and 
the pregnancies were maintained on a low protein diet, the resulting apo E*3 Leiden 
offspring had an exaggerated increase in total plasma cholesterol and developed larger 
atherosclerotic lesions than mice exposed to the control diet in utero (XFig. 4.3). This 
provided the ﬁ rst direct evidence that coronary heart disease can be programmed by 
protein restriction in fetal life.
Not all, if any, of these experimental studies in animals can be truly said to be repre-
sentative of nutritional problems that are seen in humans. Whilst iron deﬁ ciency anemia 
is endemic among pregnant women in some parts of the world, it would be rare to 
see it in isolation, as poor iron status is inevitably associated with “fellow travellers”, 
such as vitamin A, zinc and folate deﬁ ciencies. Similarly it can be argued that protein 
restriction of the magnitude used in rodent studies does not really reﬂ ect the range of 
protein intakes across the social classes in women in developed or even developing 
countries (XFig. 4.4). These concerns are largely unimportant as the animal models 
serve a far more important function in that they demonstrate the biological plausibility 
of the developmental programming hypothesis. The observation that an iron deﬁ cient 
diet appears to programme a similar phenotype to a low protein diet or a maternal diet 
that is high in fat or providing only 70% of ad libitum calories, and across different spe-
cies, is of huge signiﬁ cance. The existence of common responses to diverse insults sug-
gests that only a limited range of mechanisms are likely to underpin the  programming 
of physiological function.

32    4 Cardiovascular consequences of IUGR: Experimental aspects 
4.3 The mechanistic basis of cardiovascular programming
In considering the mechanisms which link fetal experience to risk of disease in adult 
life there are two key questions that need to be addressed. Firstly, what are the direct 
responses to maternal insult which initiate the progression to compromised physiologi-
cal and metabolic function? Secondly, what are the processes which subsequently take 
the individual to a disease state?
4.3.1 Primary responses
A simplistic view of the association between maternal undernutrition  and later disease 
might feature the statement that a simple lack of nutrients impacts upon the growth of 
organs during rapid phases of cell proliferation and development. Observations from a 
number of animal experiments demonstrate that this is not the case. In sheep and in rats, 
restriction of maternal nutrition during the pre-implantation phase can result in long-
term cardiovascular consequences (Kwong et al., 2000; Sinclair et al., 2007; Watkins 
et al., 2008). Manipulation of nutritional status at this stage precedes the period when 
a fetal nutrient supply is established by a considerable period of time. This implies that 
some other signal must be passed between mother and fetus, perhaps conveying some 
endocrine or metabolic indicator of sub-optimal nutritional status.

from plant and animal sources calculated from the 2004 Food and Agriculture Organisation, 
global food balance sheets. Availability data represent an over-estimation of actual population 
intakes, which will vary considerably within each region. It is clear that signiﬁ cant numbers 
of adults will be at risk of marginal protein intake in developing countries by virtue of low 
availability of protein rich foods and a heavy reliance on lower quality plant sources. This can be 
regarded as justiﬁ cation for the use of a low protein diet model of nutritional programming, but 
it is important to note that similar populations will simultaneously be blighted by deﬁ ciencies of 
vitamin A, iron, zinc and iodine. Taken from Langley-Evans (2009).

4.3 The mechanistic basis of cardiovascular programming    33
It is clear that whatever the nature of this signal, it is capable of leaving a long-term 
memory of the nutritional insult within the embryonic/fetal cells. Feeding ewes a diet 
that was deﬁ cient in methyl donors  during the periconceptual period  resulted in male 
offspring that were heavier and fatter, elicited altered immune responses to antigenic 
challenge, were insulin-resistant, and had elevated blood pressure (Sinclair et al., 2007). 
In rats, there is clear evidence that hypertension and renal insufﬁ ciency programmed by 
a maternal low protein diet  can be transmitted to subsequent generations via either the 
maternal or paternal line (Harrison et al. 2008). Primary cell cultures derived from neo-
natal cardiomyocytes also exhibit altered glucose uptake if derived from rats exposed to 
a low protein diet in utero (Austin and Langley-Evans, 2011).
The existence of the cellular memory of early life events that is implied by the above 
observations is often attributed to programmed changes in DNA methylation  and his-
tone acetylation  (Lillycrop et al., 2007, Burdge et al., 2009). DNA methylation is a 
potent suppressor of gene expression, either through blocking access of transcriptional 
machinery to the chromatin structure surrounding speciﬁ c gene promoters, or through 
interference with the binding of transcription factors to DNA, whilst acetylation of 
histones promotes gene expression. Epigenetic marks are believed to be stably inher-
ited and this may therefore allow phenotypic traits, acquired as a result of nutritional 
programming, to be passed on to subsequent offspring, or to cells which are divid-
ing in culture. Changes in such marks in response to periods of undernutrition may 
provide important mechanisms through which expression of genes and proteins are 
perturbed by nutritional signals, beyond the period when the signal is withdrawn. For 
example, we have recently shown that maternal protein restriction in the rat results in 
hypomethylation of the adrenal AT1b receptor , with an associated increase in gene 
expression (Bogdarina et al., 2010; XFig. 4.5). This is a similar ﬁ nding to that of Lillycrop 
et al. (2005) who reported differential methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor  and 
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α following protein restriction.

34    4 Cardiovascular consequences of IUGR: Experimental aspects 
In terms of endocrine imbalance during pregnancy, most attention has focused upon a 
possible contribution of glucocorticoid s to nutritional programming (Seckl, 2004). During 
normal rat pregnancy the expression of the enzyme 11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  
(11ßHSD2) in placenta plays a critical role in maintaining a gradient of active glucocor-
ticoids, with maternal corticosterone concentrations being up to 1000-fold higher than 
fetal. This is an essential function that allows the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis  to develop independently of maternal inﬂ uences. Experiments in which synthetic 
glucocorticoids, which are poor substrates for 11ßHSD2, are administered to pregnant 
rodents, result in offspring which develop hypertension  (Benediktsson et al., 1993) and 
similar effects are produced when 11ßHSD2 activity is inhibited in pregnancy (Langley-
Evans, 1997; Lindsay et al., 1996). Studies of human and animal pregnancies have 
shown that low birthweight is associated with reduced activity of 11ßHSD2 in placenta  
(Benediktsson et al., 1993, Shams et al. 1998). Our own work, supported by indepen-
dent laboratories has shown that both enzyme activity and 11ßHSD2 mRNA expression 
are down-regulated (Bertram et al., 2001; Langley-Evans et al., 1996d) in pregnancies 
associated with undernutrition (both global undernutrition and protein restriction). This 
has led to the suggestion that nutritional programming may be partly mediated by an 
associated disruption of the maternal-fetal glucocorticoid gradient. This may in itself 
disturb the normal developmental pattern of gene expression, since glucocorticoids are 
important regulators of gene expression which promote growth retardation and early 
tissue maturation. It is important to appreciate that a glucocorticoid-driven theory of 
nutritional programming would not be exclusive of a role for nutritional modulation of 
epigenetic regulation. When rats fed a low protein diet were treated with metyrapone to 
inhibit maternal synthesis of endogenous glucocorticoids, methylation and expression 
of the AT1b receptor  were normalized along with offspring blood pressure (Bogdarina 
et al., 2010) (XFig. 4.5).
The above processes, or other signals that maternal nutritional status is less than op-
timal, will inevitably alter the expression of a wide range of genes. To date, there has 
been little research aimed at identifying which genes and processes are most affected 
during key phases of growth and maturation. It is a major challenge to identify these 
primary targets for programming stimuli as, ﬁ rstly, there has not been an effective 
characterization of exactly when programming is initiated, and secondly because 
the period during which expression is altered need only be transient. For example a 
relatively short period in which genes which favour cell proliferation are suppressed 
would result in an organ that is morphologically compromised. Similarly a brief acti-
vation of genes could promote greater commitment of progenitor cells to a particular 
lineage.
4.3.2 Secondary processes
Two decades ago Alan Lucas (1991) attributed programming to a change in the number 
or type of cells that are present within an organ. An organ that matures with altered 
morphology as a result of a programming insult might be expected to have a reduced 
capacity to perform physiological function. Although today this concept is often  ignored, 
with epigenetic processes being favoured as drivers of programming, the idea that tissue 
remodelling takes place remains attractive and is supported by a number of  experimental 
observations.

4.3 The mechanistic basis of cardiovascular programming    35
Many organs in humans have completed their development by the time of birth and 
in rodents, although the developmental window extends a short way into postnatal life, 
much of tissue growth and maturation is complete by the time of birth. If insults impact 
upon cell proliferation or differentiation during periods of rapid growth, then it would 
be expected that organs will mature at a lower size and with a reduced functional 
capacity. There are numerous examples of this available from experimental models 
that are associated with programming of high blood pressure. In the pancreas of rats 
exposed to low protein diet s in utero there are fewer islets, smaller islets and reduced 
vascularisation of the islets that are present (Snoeck et al., 1990). The same maternal 
insult is also associated with altered size and neuronal densities in hypothalamic cen-
tres that regulate food intake (Plagemann et al., 2000), with reduced vascularisation of 
the brain cortex (Bennis-Taleb et al., 1999), alterations to the bone growth plate (Mehta 
et al., 2002) and differences in muscle ﬁ bre types (Mallinson et al., 2007).
Tissue remodelling is perhaps best demonstrated by consideration of the numbers 
of nephrons  present in the kidney. Nephron number appears to be highly sensitive to 
variation in the quality and quantity of nutrients in the maternal diet (Langley-Evans 
et al., 1999; Vehaskari et al., 2001). Rat offspring from dams fed either low protein 
diets or subjected to iron deﬁ ciency exhibit reductions in nephron number that are of 
the order of 20–30% (XFig. 4.6). Similar observations have been made in sheep that 
experienced maternal food restriction in early fetal life (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2004). 
Lower nephron number appears to be a consequence of disruption of tissue differentia-
tion, since organ size is generally reported to be normal despite the signiﬁ cant nephron 
deﬁ cit. Interestingly there are studies of humans which indicate that LBW is associated 
with lower nephron number, and that the presence of a reduced nephron complement 
is associated with hypertension  (Hughson et al., 2006). Remodelling of the kidney can

SEM for 10 observations per group. Lower nephron number at birth, as a result of maternal 
undernutrition, results in higher systemic blood pressure as a consequence of a vicious cycle 
of rising intra-renal pressures to maintain renal function and progressive nephron loss.

36    4 Cardiovascular consequences of IUGR: Experimental aspects 
therefore be regarded as a consequence of exposures that drive IUGR and as a driver of 
the cardiovascular disease that is observed subsequent to IUGR.
Subsequent to the irreversible modiﬁ cation of organ structure through tissue remodel-
ling, it is relatively simple to determine how physiological processes become disturbed. 
For example, changes to renal morphology, with a reduction in the number of functional 
nephrons would produce local increases in blood pressure to maintain renal function 
(XFig. 4.6). This would eventually result in greater systemic pressure (Brenner and Cher-
tow, 1993). Renal injury is also an endpoint of this process and the offspring of rats 
fed a low protein diet in pregnancy exhibit an earlier onset of impaired renal function, 
associated with morphological evidence of tissue damage ( Joles et al., 2010; XFig. 4.7). 
Similarly remodelling of centres in the hypothalamus such that sympathetic outﬂ ow is 
altered could also impact upon homeostatic control over blood pressure. Changing the 
proﬁ le of cell types within a tissue may result in altered patterns of hormone receptor 
expression and responsiveness. These in turn may establish altered expression of genes, 
proteins and pathways which will therefore appear to have been programmed by early 
life experience. The existence of disease or disordered physiological processes may 
exacerbate such changes.
Targets such as these have often been the subject of mechanistic investigations, and 
the identiﬁ cation of speciﬁ c genes, proteins and pathways that appear programmed 
by early undernutrition is certainly a cause for some excitement. For example, we, 
and others, have reported that fetal exposure to protein restriction results in the early 
up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α , the expression of which 
is suppressed with ageing (Erhuma et al., 2007; Lillycrop et al., 2005). Although this ap-
pears to provide an explanation of the programming of metabolic disturbance, it has not

been possible to establish whether the changes in gene and protein expression directly 
cause, or are a consequence of the metabolic phenotype. It is important to remember, 
that these processes are almost certainly not the primary drivers of programming. The 
events and processes that initially drive tissue remodelling are the true mechanisms 
through which the maternal diet programs disease. Those processes may be difﬁ cult to 
identify as they may only operate in short, discrete periods of embryonic and fetal life 
and those windows of opportunity have yet to be isolated.
4.4 Research priorities
It is perhaps surprising that more than twenty years after the initial epidemiological ﬁ nd-
ings of Barker and colleagues from the Hertfordshire cohort were published, and ﬁ fteen 
years after the publication of the ﬁ rst robust animal model of cardiovascular program-
ming (Langley and Jackson, 1994), that we have not identiﬁ ed the primary processes that 
link exposure to maternal undernutrition, to disease in later life. The main laboratories in 
the developmental origins of adult disease ﬁ eld have spent much of that time collecting 
evidence of phenotype in multiple experimental models, and characterising the nature of 
the responses to early life undernutrition. The study of the pathways that lead to disease, 
consequent to early life programming events is clearly of interest and may potentially 
be exploited from a therapeutic perspective, but I would contend this is not the most 
important issue. It is clear from studies of animals that even short periods of exposure to a 
nutritional insult can have effects upon the embryo or fetus that will persist for the rest of 
the lifespan and may even be passed on to subsequent generations. It is of primary impor-
tance to identify what the processes are that are responsible for this. What, for example, 
causes quite profound tissue remodelling following a relatively mild shift in maternal 
nutritional status? It is critical to know if the effects observed in animals also hold true for 
humans and to know whether the processes that may act upon the embryo also hold true 
for a late gestation fetus or a neonate. Whilst in the past our fascination lay in the fact that 
early insults could exert permanent effects upon whole body physiology, our attention 
needs to shift back towards what is happening at the time of the insult. If we can acquire 
knowledge of why epigenetic markers are so responsive to the prevailing environment 
in utero then we can begin to address questions about whether programming effects can 
be reversed or somehow manipulated to produce positive health outcomes in later life.

5  Fetal programming of endocrine function in IUGR 
offspring depends on the cause of low birth 
weight: Evidence from animal models and 
the human FIPS-study
Eva Nüsken, Anja Tzschoppe, Jörg Dötsch, and Kai-Dietrich Nüsken
Low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) can be caused by a number of 
different conditions, which are not accounted for in many experimental settings. Therefore, 
the objective of our present studies is to analyze the impact of different causes of low birth 
weight on fetal programming of endocrine function using the example of two key candidate 
molecules: IGF-1 and leptin.
Methodologically, we have established two different models of intrauterine growth restric-
tion in the rat – the model of bilateral uterine artery ligation (UAL) and the model of low pro-
tein nutrition (LPN). In humans, we have established a prospective multicenter study (“FIPS”) 
studying placental tissue and umbilical cord blood from growth-restricted neonates with 
anomalous placental Doppler velocimetry (IUGR), small for gestational age neonates with 
normal placental Doppler (small for gestational age [SGA]) and healthy controls  (appropriate 
for gestational age [AGA]).
Our results indicate that fetal programming of leptin and IGF-1 depends on the cause of 
low birth weight rather than birth weight itself. UAL and LPN both induce IUGR but have 
opposing impacts on placental as well as fetal hepatic leptin and IGF-1 gene expressions 
at birth. In addition to differing windows of exposure, we speculate that availability of nu-
trients and occurrence of hypoxia, respectively, might be the pivotal differences leading to 
distinct programming. In humans, the underlying cause for fetal programming of metabolic 
disease via reduced neonatal free leptin might be prenatal unfavorable placental environ-
ment (IUGR, as evidenced by reduced placental perfusion), not low birth weight (SGA). In 
conclusion, morbidity after low birth weight should be analyzed referring to the underlying 
 pathophysiological cause rather than referring to low birth weight itself.
5.1 Introduction
Intrauterine growth restriction  is known to be associated with disease in later life 
(Varvarigou, 2010). Consequently, the importance of early human development on the 
predisposition for disease in later life has become an important topic of research, and 
various models have been developed to study the effect of low birth weight  on later 
morbidity. In humans, low birth weight and intrauterine growth restriction are caused 
by a number of different conditions. In many experimental settings, however, these dif-
ferent causes are not accounted for. Therefore, the objective of our present clinical and 

42    5 Fetal programming of endocrine function in IUGR offspring
experimental studies is to analyze the impact of different causes of low birth weight on 
fetal programming of endocrine function.
5.2  Leptin and IGF-1, two key candidate molecules 
of endocrine programming
More than a decade ago it was demonstrated that uterine artery ligation  (UAL) results 
in decreased serum levels of IGF-1  and elevated serum concentrations of IGFBP-1  in 
the fetus (Unterman et al., 1993). Offspring of UAL dams develop impaired glucose 
tolerance as well as altered lipid metabolism and global adiposity in later life (Nüsken 
et al., 2008; Simmons, Templeton, and Gertz, 2001). Similarly to rodent data, IGF-1 is 
decreased and IGFBP-1 is elevated in cord blood from human SGA neonates (Verhae-
ghe et al., 1993) who are at higher risk to develop a disturbed glucose tolerance  and 
diabetes mellitus, respectively (Hales et al., 1991). Altered IGF-1 (Brugts et al., 2010; 
Dunger, Yuen, and Ong, 2004; Rajpathak et al., 2009) and IGFBP-1 (Heald et al., 2001; 
Lewitt et al., 2008) levels are associated with disturbed glucose tolerance in adults. 
Likewise, decreased IGF-1 serum concentrations as well as IGF-1 hepatic gene expres-
sion, respectively, and elevated IGFBP-1 serum concentrations and elevated IGFBP-1 
hepatic gene expression were measured in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes 
mellitus (Han, Kang, and Park, 2006). Thus, IGF-1 and IGFBP-1 might play a pivotal role 
in fetal programming of later metabolic disease and are of high interest when comparing 
different models of IUGR.
Leptin  was discovered in 1994 and plays an essential role in the regulation of energy 
homeostasis, food intake, body composition, and reproductive function (Ahima and 
Flier, 2000). It is known to reduce food intake by regulating the activity of neurons 
in the hypothalamus  (Bouret, Draper, and Simerly, 2004). In this context, Bouret and 
colleagues were able to show that leptin deﬁ ciency during a critical period of brain 
development in neonatal mice induced permanent disruption of neural projection 
pathways from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, leading to the development 
of adiposity later on (Bouret et al., 2004). Because a dysregulation of appetite might be 
responsible for the development of adiposity in SGA infants, leptin is a key candidate 
of metabolic programming. Additionally, leptin is of interest in IUGR as it seems to be 
related to intrauterine growth (Koistinen et al., 1997) and insulin sensitivity (Miras et al., 
2010). However, leptin data from IUGR studies is conﬂ icting. Leptin gene expression 
in perirenal visceral fat from male IUGR lambs was signiﬁ cantly decreased compared 
to controls (Dufﬁ eld et al., 2009). In humans, some authors report increased leptin 
cord blood  levels in IUGR infants (Shekhawat et al., 1998) whereas most others found 
decreased umbilical leptin concentrations ( Jaquet et al., 1998;  Pighetti et al., 2003; 
Yildiz, Avci, and Ingeç, 2002). These conﬂ icting results might be explained by the fact 
that the underlying pathophysiological cause is not accounted for in most IUGR studies.
5.3 Animal models of IUGR
Worldwide, various animal models have been used to study the impact of intrauterine 
growth restriction. In our group, we have established two different, widely used models 

5.3 Animal models of IUGR    43
of IUGR  in the rat. The model of bilateral UAL  is used to induce IUGR by placental 
insufﬁ ciency  (Nüsken et al., 2008), whereas the model of low protein  (LP) nutrition 
simulates the situation of mothers who suffer from malnutrition (Plank et al., 2006).
In UAL dams, we perform the ligation on day 19 of pregnancy. Both uterine horns 
are carefully pulled out of the abdomen and both uterine arteries and veins are ligated 
at the most caudal point accessible. After the ligation, blood ﬂ ow to the fetuses is only 
supplied from cranially via the ovarian artery. Therefore, the phenotype of intrauterine 
growth restriction is most severe in caudal fetuses. Fetuses from ligated dams (LIG) are 
compared to both fetuses of sham-operated dams ([SOP] in whom the suture material 
was not ﬁ xed but removed after identical anesthetic and surgical procedures) and to 
fetuses of unoperated controls (C). In the LPN model, dams are fed a low protein diet 
(LP; 8% casein) throughout pregnancy. The control dams are fed an isocaloric normal 
protein (NP) diet (17% casein).
In studies using the UAL model, there are several methodological aspects to be con-
sidered. As to the fetal position in the uterine horn, we found that caudal fetuses from 
ligated dams were most severely growth-restricted and that placental gene expression 
of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1 ) measured by RNA protection 
assay at birth was increased only in fetuses near the ligation site (caudal) but not in 
fetuses far from the ligation (Nüsken et al., 2007; XTab. 5.1). It is also important to note 
that the UAL model requires untreated controls because sham operation alone induces 
not only IUGR but also alterations of gene expression at birth as well as long-term 
pathogenic programming of adiposity and disturbed lipid metabolism (Nüsken et al., 
2008).
Comparing the UAL model with the LPN model, there are three main methodological 
differences. First, the cause of low birth weight is different (low blood ﬂ ow vs. malnutri-
tion). Secondly, the window of exposure varies (last 4 days of pregnancy vs. complete 
pregnancy). Thirdly, birth weight in fetuses of ligated dams (LIG) and of sham-operated 
dams (SOP) depends on the fetal position in relation to the ligation site (Nüsken et al., 
2007; XTab. 5.1), whereas all fetuses of LP dams are born too small irrespective of 
their position in the uterine horn. Analysis of gene expression at birth demonstrated 
that leptin  expression in the placenta s of LIG and SOP fetuses was signiﬁ cantly down-
regulated compared to control fetuses. Conversely, leptin in placentas of LP fetuses

was signiﬁ cantly upregulated compared to NP. Similarly, IGF-1 gene expression in 
the placenta was reduced in group LIG but increased in group LP. In fetal liver, IGF-1 
expression was signiﬁ cantly downregulated in LIG fetuses but unaltered in LP fetuses 
(Nüsken et al., 2011).
In conclusion, comparison of the UAL model with the LPN model provides strong 
evidence that the cause of low birth weight, not low birth weight itself, is crucial when 
studying IUGR-associated fetal programming. In addition to differing windows of expo-
sure, we speculate that availability of nutrients and occurrence of hypoxia, respectively, 
might be the pivotal differences leading to distinct programming.
5.4 Human IUGR study (FIPS)
In humans, we have established a prospective multicenter study (Fetal programming – 
IUGR – Placental markers – Study ; FIPS) to identify placental genes with predictive 
value for the development of obesity and metabolic disorders after intrauterine growth 
restriction based on the hypothesis of an alteration of gene expression by fetal program-
ming. As we deﬁ ne IUGR by a birth weight Z-score < 10th percentile and anomalous 
placental Doppler velocimetry during pregnancy, all of the IUGR pregnancies in this 
study experience placental insufﬁ ciency . Further inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
listed in detail by Tzschoppe et al. (2010a).
In the present study (Tzschoppe et al., 2010a, 2010b) we primarily aimed to compare 
placental leptin synthesis and leptin binding capability in venous cord blood between 
IUGR newborns and neonates born AGA. Secondly, these parameters were analyzed in 
an additional group of neonates with low birth weight but normal uterine and umbilical 
artery Doppler velocimetry (SGA, deﬁ ned by a birth weight Z-score < 10th percen-
tile) and also compared to IUGR newborns. We enrolled 21 newborns with prenatal 
ultrasound-proven IUGR (9 males, 12 females), 33 healthy AGA neonates (19 males, 
14 females), and 14 SGA newborns without IUGR (7 males, 7 females). 62% of the 
IUGR, none of the SGA, and 45% of the AGA infants were premature. Further clinical 
characteristics of the three groups at birth are listed in XTab. 5.2. In all neonates, we 
determined the concentration of leptin and soluble leptin receptor  (sOB-R) in venous 
cord blood at birth. Moreover, placental gene and protein expression of leptin were mea-
sured. For statistical analysis, measurements were log-transformed to normalize the data.
Comparing IUGR to AGA neonates, plasma log-leptin concentration in venous 
cord blood did not differ signiﬁ cantly. However, the concentration of log-sOB-R was 
 signiﬁ cantly elevated in IUGR newborns ( p = 0.01, XFig. 5.1).
On the placental level, log-leptin mRNA was signiﬁ cantly higher in IUGR than in 
AGA neonates (relative gene expression, p = 0.01). Ligand blotting analysis revealed 
that the increase in leptin mRNA levels was accompanied by increased leptin protein 
expression in placentas of IUGR infants (XFig. 5.2).
To investigate the effect of prenatal placental environment on potential pathological 
fetal programming in lean human neonates, we compared IUGR newborns with the ad-
ditional group of SGA neonates. Whereas no signiﬁ cant difference was found for plasma 
log-leptin concentration in venous cord blood ( p = 0.70, XFig. 5.3), the concentration 
of log-sOB-R was elevated in IUGR ( p = 0.01, XFig. 5.3) compared to SGA neonates.

(derived from Tzschoppe et al., 2010b)
Considering placental gene expression, log-leptin mRNA was signiﬁ cantly higher in 
IUGR than in SGA newborns (relative gene expression, p < 0.001, XFig. 5.4).
Ligand blotting analysis showed that leptin protein expression was reduced in SGA 
compared to IUGR neonates (XFig. 5.2).
Thus, not low birth weight (SGA), but prenatal unfavorable placental environment 
as evidenced by reduced placental perfusion (IUGR) might be the underlying cause for 
fetal programming of metabolic disease via reduced neonatal free leptin. In analogy 
to rodent models (Bouret et al., 2004), we speculate that leptin deﬁ ciency after IUGR 
might induce a dysregulation of appetite and energy expenditure due to insufﬁ cient 
formation of speciﬁ c hypothalamic circuits. In conclusion, morbidity after low birth 
weight should be analyzed referring to the underlying pathophysiological cause rather 
than referring to low birth weight itself.

5.5 Summary    47
5.5 Summary
Following the ﬁ rst publications by, for example, Dörner (Dörner and Mohnike, 1973) 
and Barker (Barker and Osmond, 1986) on the association between early human de-
velopment and morbidity in later life, numerous clinical and experimental studies have 
focused on the implications of low birth weight. However, in many of these studies, it 
is unclear whether intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is present, and the underlying 
pathophysiological cause of low birth weight is not accounted for. Looking at leptin and 
IGF-1, which are both key molecules of endocrine programming, our present studies in 
animals and humans demonstrate that fetal programming of endocrine systems does not 
depend on low birth weight itself, but on the cause of low birth weight.
In rats, uterine artery ligation (UAL) on day 19 of pregnancy, as well as low protein 
nutrition (LPN) throughout pregnancy, are established models for the induction of low 
birth weight subsequent to IUGR. The experimental setting of both models clearly varies 
in the window of exposure (last 4 days of pregnancy vs. complete pregnancy) and in the 
underlying pathophysiological cause of low birth weight (low blood ﬂ ow vs. malnutri-
tion). Although both models induce IUGR, they have opposing impact on placental as 
well as fetal hepatic leptin and IGF-1 gene expressions at birth (Nüsken et al., 2011). 
This is reﬂ ected by the distinct long-term outcome of the two animal models. Offspring 
of ligated dams develop disturbed glucose tolerance, altered lipid metabolism, and 
global adiposity in later life (Nüsken et al., 2008; Simmons et al., 2001). In contrast, our 
speciﬁ c low protein nutrition results in only minor metabolic changes in the offspring 
(Plank et al., 2008). Additionally, LPN seems to induce arterial hypertension and kidney 
disease much earlier in life than UAL (Langley-Evans, Langley-Evans, and Marchand, 
2003; Vehaskari, Aviles, and Manning, 2001; Wlodek et al., 2008). Thus, these models 
provide strong evidence that the cause of low birth weight is crucial when studying 
IUGR-models.
Because the relevance of observations in animals for humans is limited, we have 
initiated a prospective controlled multicenter study in humans named “FIPS” (Fetal 
programming – IUGR – Placental markers – Study), aiming at predicting later disease 
by analyzing the placenta and venous cord blood right after birth (Dötsch, Schild, and

48    5 Fetal programming of endocrine function in IUGR offspring
Struwe, 2008). In the afterbirth of infants suffering from intrauterine deprivation re-
sulting in IUGR (proved by pathological Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical and/or 
uterine arteries during pregnancy), important regulating systems for cell growth and 
transport through the placenta are studied. During the following 6 years, the patients are 
examined annually with regard to growth, overweight, blood pressure, kidney function, 
and glucose tolerance.
As to leptin, data from the FIPS study indicates that increased leptin binding ca-
pacity results in reduced biologically active circulating leptin concentrations in IUGR 
neonates, but not in neonates with low birth weight and normal Doppler (SGA). Fur-
thermore, current preliminary data demonstrates that IUGR neonates only, but not SGA 
neonates, show a signiﬁ cant decrease of circulating IGF-1 (Tzschoppe et al., 2010a, 
2010b). Therefore, human data also demonstrates that the cause of low birth weight is 
a key factor for fetal programming of endocrine systems.
In conclusion, morbidity after low birth weight should be analyzed referring to the 
underlying pathophysiological cause rather than referring to low birth weight itself.

6  Intrauterine corticosteroids for lung maturation: 
Observations of HPA axis function and cardiac 
autonomic balance in the neonate
Leonhard Schäffer, Tilo Burkhardt, Maren Tomaske, Manfred Rauh, 
and Ernst Beinder
The putative long-term effects of antenatal glucocorticoid treatment for accelerating lung 
maturation in pregnancies at risk for preterm birth is still a matter of debate. Different ani-
mal models have shown that antenatal glucocorticoid exposure has a persistent impact on 
the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) – axis regulation and that the developing cardiac 
autonomic system is sensitive toward antenatal glucocorticoids. In the human, the situation 
is less clear. Long-term observations in adolescents and young adults have rather focused on 
classic signs of disease manifestation such as blood pressure. Risk-factors for cardiovascular 
and metabolic disease, however, may transform into apparent clinical manifestation at a more 
advanced age when stability of these systems can be less compensated by the organism. Our 
studies analyzed whether a single course of antenatal betamethasone treatment has a direct 
and continuous effect on the developing HPA axis and the cardiac autonomic system. To this 
end, resting- and stress-induced salivary levels for cortisol, cortisone, and α-amylase as well 
as heart rate variability parameters as early signs of system alteration were analyzed. These 
studies were conducted in healthy newborns born late preterm or at term. Our studies show 
that a single course of antenatal betamethasone treatment induces a signiﬁ cant suppression of 
HPA-axis reactivity in healthy infants that is present several weeks later in early postnatal life. 
In contrast, the cardiac autonomic balance appears not to be primarily affected. Antenatal 
betamethasone treatment may therefore alter the HPA axis in a manner that predisposes these 
individuals toward a development of diseases in later life.
6.1 Introduction
Antenatal glucocorticoid administration  is an established procedure in pregnancies 
with an imminent risk for preterm delivery . Before 34 weeks of gestation, maternal 
administration of synthetic glucocorticoids, such as betamethasone  or dexamethasone , 
signiﬁ cantly reduces perinatal mortality and morbidity by maturational effects on the 
immature fetal lungs and decreases the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis and severe 
cerebral hemorrhage (Roberts and Dalziel, 2006).
Evidence from animal models, however, suggests that excess glucocorticoid exposure 
during intrauterine development may entail long-term alterations in the functionality and 
balance of homeostasis regulating systems. Indeed, major physiologic systems involved 
in the development of hypertension  and the metabolic syndrome  are glucocorticoid 

52    6 Intrauterine corticosteroids for lung maturation
sensitive targets during intrauterine development (Drake, Tang, and Nyirenda, 2007; 
Seckl, 2004). In the rat, maternal antenatal dexamethasone treatment results in elevated 
blood pressure in the offspring (Benediktsson et al., 1993; Woods and Weeks, 2005). 
Likewise, the maternal administration of dexamethasone in the sheep induces hyperten-
sion during adulthood (Dodic et al., 1998, 2002). Glucocorticoid s are likewise involved 
in programming of glucose tolerance and metabolism. Again, in the rat as well as in 
the sheep, persistent alterations in glucose and insulin levels have been found in adult 
offspring after intrauterine glucocorticoid exposure (Moss et al., 2001; Nyirenda et al., 
1998).
6.2 Vulnerability of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis  represents the organism’s central organ 
of stress regulation and is involved in preservation of cardiovascular and metabolic 
stability, and elevated cortisol  levels have been linked to arteriosclerosis and diabetes 
(Sapolsky, Romero, and Munck, 2000). The HPA axis and its key limbic regulator, the 
hippocampus, are especially sensitive to glucocorticoids because this system is tightly 
regulated through a feedback mechanism involving glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralo-
corticoid receptors (MR) at the level of the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and pituitary 
gland to inhibit HPA activity ( Jacobson and Sapolsky, 1991). The HPA axis has been 
shown to be vulnerable to excess glucocorticoid exposure during its maturational stage 
(Kapoor, Petropoulos, and Matthews, 2008; Owen, Andrews, and Matthews, 2005). 
As such, overexposure to glucocorticoids results in attenuated hippocampal GR and 
MR expression. The resulting permanently increased cortisol levels and hypertension in 
the adult rats suggest an impaired negative feedback sensitivity of the HPA axis (Levitt 
et al., 1996). Further alterations at different levels of the HPA  axis are likewise targets 
of glucocorticoid receptor alterations (Dean et al., 2001). Thus, glucocorticoid induced 
permanent alterations of these receptors may induce a resetting of the balance and 
reactivity of the HPA axis in later life.
6.3 Vulnerability of the sympathetic nervous system
The sympathetic nervous system  (SNS) development has been shown to be sensitive 
toward antenatal glucocorticoids as well. In fact, the SNS is closely interconnected with 
the HPA axis as glucocorticoids provide direct signals for noradrenergic system  matura-
tion in the brainstem and thus on central noradrenergic activity (Slotkin et al., 1992). 
Furthermore, cardiac noradrenergic innervation is directly affected by glucocorticoids 
(Bian, Seidler, and Slotkin, 1993). Adrenergic cardiovascular drive and noradrenergic 
inﬂ uences play a key role in the development or progression of hypertension  and the 
metabolic syndrome  in the adult (Grassi et al., 2009), making this system another key 
candidate for glucocorticoid induced long-term alterations in system balance. This no-
tion is supported by experiments showing a sustained elevation of blood pressure and 
altered baroreceptor heart rate response in fetal sheep and the baboon and increased 
central and peripheral vascular resistance after glucocorticoid administration (Derks 
et al., 1997; Fletcher et al., 2002; Koenen et al., 2002; Schwab et al., 2000).

6.5 HPA axis functionality in neonates after intrauterine betamethasone treatment     53
6.4 Findings in humans
Findings of putative alterations of HPA-axis activity and SNS balance in the human 
after intrauterine glucocorticoid exposure are less clear. Premature neonates failed to 
increase cortisol levels in response to a stressor after intrauterine exposure to gluco-
corticoids for lung maturation (Davis et al., 2004, 2006). In the neonate as well as in a 
cohort of preterm born children at the age of 14 years, blood pressure  was signiﬁ cantly 
increased after prenatal glucocorticoid treatment (Doyle et al., 2000; Kari et al., 1994). 
In contrast, a large prospective follow-up study did not ﬁ nd signiﬁ cant alterations in 
blood pressure and resting cortisol levels in 30-year-old adults after a single course 
of antenatal betamethasone treatment for lung maturation. Physiological functional-
ity when challenging these systems was not available. Nevertheless, during a glucose 
challenge, clear indicators for the presence of insulin resistance  were present in these 
individuals (Dalziel et al., 2005). In fact, studies have mainly focused on classical signs 
of disease manifestation; however, these signs may not become apparent until a later 
age when compensatory mechanisms fail after a certain threshold is reached.
If indeed the HPA axis and the SNS experience permanent alterations after intrauter-
ine glucocorticoid exposure, these alterations should be detectible after birth. Consider-
ing the fact that these alterations may be mild and clinically not apparent during early 
life due to a high compensatory reserve being only “exhausted” over many years, we 
aimed to not only analyze HPA and SNS balance under resting conditions but also to 
challenge these systems.
A further rationale to analyze these systems in neonates was that in a normal postna-
tal period, temporarily challenged systems normalize in response to a normal postnatal 
environment, while permanently altered systems may become apparent, but postnatal 
compensatory system reactions may not have had the time to develop.
6.5  HPA axis functionality in neonates after intrauterine 
betamethasone treatment
To analyze the functionality of the HPA axis, we applied a simple noninvasive method 
by measuring cortisol  and cortisone levels in salivary samples. Salivary cortisol reﬂ ects 
the unbound, active fraction of cortisol and is highly correlated with plasma cortisol 
levels (Calixto et al., 2002; Gunnar, 1989), making this method especially valuable 
for infants where blood sampling is less desired by parents. Likewise, to analyze for 
functionality under challenge, we made use of the routinely conducted heel-prick test 
72–96 h after delivery, which has been shown to be an adequate stimulus for HPA-axis 
activation (Gunnar, 1992). Resting cortisol levels and cortisol levels after this challenge 
were measured. While resting levels of cortisol were comparable between the infants 
with antenatal betamethasone treatment and controls, we found that the neonatal 
HPA axis was signiﬁ cantly suppressed in infants with betamethasone  treatment after 
the stimulus as these infants failed to adequately increase cortisol release (Schäffer 
et al., 2009; XFig. 6.1). Because these infants were born near or at term and the mean 
interval between glucocorticoid treatment and delivery was more than 8 weeks, it is 
rather unlikely that these effects may only be a transient short-term effect consider-
ing that short-term effects of antenatal glucocorticoid exposure  have been described to 
last for about 1 week after administration (Ballard et al., 1980; Parker et al., 1996). 

54    6 Intrauterine corticosteroids for lung maturation
The possibility that the decreased cortisol response in the study group would be the 
result of an increased conversion of cortisol to cortisone by an altered activity of the 
11ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase  could also be excluded because cortisol and corti-
sone levels were strongly correlated in the study group, thus excluding this possibility. 
Therefore, it appears that a single course of antenatal betamethasone treatment for im-
minent preterm delivery has a suppressive effect on HPA-axis reactivity that persists at 
least for more than a mean of 8 weeks when these pregnancies continue and infants are 
delivered near or at term.
6.6  The cardiac autonomic system after intrauterine 
betamethasone treatment
A sensitive parameter to analyze early alterations in the cardiac sympathetic – 
 parasympathetic balance is heart rate variability  (HRV), which is a well-established 
noninvasive measure of cardiac autonomic control that has been shown to be related to 
hypertension (Guzzetti et al., 1991; Langewitz, Ruddel, and Schachinger, 1994) and to 
predict future adverse cardiovascular events in adults (Algra et al., 1993). Analyses of HRV 
have been suggested for putative prognostic use in children as well (Stewart, 2000). Analy-
sis from 24 h Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) tracings calculating various parameters for 
short- and long-term analyses during active and resting states did not reveal any signiﬁ cant 
difference between betamethasone exposed infants and controls (Schäffer et al., 2010).
To further support our conclusion, we supplemented our electrophysiological studies 
by measuring salivary α-amylase  levels during resting conditions and after a stressful 
stimulus (heel-prick test). Salivary α-amylase is secreted by acinar cells in the salivary 
glands that are richly innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve ﬁ bers, 
inﬂ uencing the release of α-amylase by classic neurotransmitters (Turner and Sugiya, 
2002). Studies in humans and animals have suggested that the activation of the auto-
nomic nervous system  leads to a high activity of salivary α-amylase (Asking and Gjor-
strup, 1987; Chatterton et al., 1996; Schneyer and Hall, 1991; Steerenberg et al., 1997). 
Furthermore, α-amylase levels have been found to be associated with cardiovascular

physiology and are suggested to be a surrogate for cardiovascular autonomic system 
balance (Granger et al., 2007), thereby making this parameter a promising indicator for 
cardiac autonomic function.
Interestingly, α-amylase levels rather decreased in betamethasone -exposed neo-
nates in response to the stress event as compared to controls (Schäffer et al., 2010). 
We speculate that the slightly attenuated α-amylase response might be explained by 
the altered HPA-system sensitivity rather than by direct effects of steroid exposure 
on the sympathetic system as these systems are closely interconnected. Thus, it appears 
that the neonatal cardiac autonomic system is primarily unaffected by a single course of 
betamethasone treatment for lung maturation.
6.7 Summary
To our best knowledge, the presented studies are the ﬁ rst to analyze stress physiology 
in healthy term or near term delivered infants after a single course of betamethasone 
administration at a much earlier time in pregnancy. These early signs for alterations in 
the balance and activity of the HPA axis and the cardiac autonomic system may further 
contribute to the understanding of origins of disease development.
According to our results, a single course of antenatal betamethasone treatment for 
imminent preterm delivery entails alterations in HPA-axis responsiveness that persist 
into postnatal life. If this alteration of the HPA-axis balance really persists during life, 
it may represent a signiﬁ cant risk factor for the development of diseases in later life. In 
contrast, according to our results, cardiac autonomic balance appears to be preserved 
after exogenous glucocorticoid treatment at least in the neonate. However, due to the 
mutual interaction between the HPA axis and the SNS, this system may be subject to 
later alterations as the organism further matures.
Considering the beneﬁ cial effects of antenatal glucocorticoids to signiﬁ cantly re-
duce infant morbidity and mortality in pregnancies at risk for preterm delivery before 
34 weeks of gestation, it is clear that these measures outweigh putative long-term 
risks according to current knowledge. Nevertheless, thorough evaluation in these cases 
is mandatory to ensure a clear indication for antenatal glucocorticoids. Prophylactic 
 treatment in low-risk situations for preterm delivery should be avoided.

7 Feast or Famine: In the fast lane to puberty
Deborah M. Sloboda, Angelica B. Bernal, Graham J. Howie,

Early life adversity, particularly inadequate nutrition, has been shown to induce long-term 
adverse metabolic and cardiovascular consequences in offspring. Research into the devel-
opmental programming of disease has now incorporated aspects of reproductive physiology, 
suggesting that reproductive function may similarly have a developmental origin. Although 
evidence for early life nutritional inﬂ uences on reproductive function is mounting, a clear un-
derstanding of the link between maternal nutrition and offspring ovarian maturation has not 
been established. We have shown that maternal undernutrition, and in some circumstances, 
maternal high fat feeding, before or during pregnancy or during early postnatal life, can alter 
the reproductive function of the offspring. This early nutritional imbalance may exert its effects 
on reproductive factors such as timing of puberty, gonadal development and pituitary-gonadal 
activity. Very few studies have investigated the effects of maternal undernutrition on ovarian 
function/development. Nevertheless, it is clear that the developing gonad is sensitive to its 
immediate environment and nutritional perturbations can have long-term consequences on 
adult reproductive function.
7.1 Introduction
There is now considerable epidemiological and experimental evidence indicating 
that early life environmental signals, including nutrition, affect subsequent develop-
ment leading to patho-physiologies including obesity and insulin resistance. These 
signals induce highly integrated responses in endocrine-related homeostasis, resulting 
in persistent changes to the developmental trajectory  producing an altered adult phe-
notype (Hanson and Gluckman, 2008). However where the intrauterine and postnatal 
environments differ markedly, such modiﬁ cations to the developmental trajectory may 
prove maladaptive (Gluckman et al., 2008). Evidence that reproductive maturation and 
function is similarly inﬂ uenced by early life events is now emerging from animal studies 
and selected human populations. As the reproductive system and its hormonal control 
mechanisms are largely established during fetal life, adverse environmental inﬂ uences 
such as inadequate maternal nutrition can exert deleterious effects on the structure and 
function of reproductive organs.
Over the past century, the average age at menarche has advanced considerably: in 
Europe, menarcheal age  has fallen from 17 to ~12.5 years of age, although the rate of 
decline is slowing (Kaplowitz, 2006; Parent et al., 2003). Historically, the onset of men-
arche  was proposed to be dependent upon a critical level of body fat (Frisch 1987), but 
evidence now exists across populations for the role of prenatal nutritional inﬂ uences 

60    7 Feast or Famine: In the fast lane to puberty
and the age at menarche (Cooper et al.; 1996, Cox et al., 2009a; Garn, 1987). Over 
a decade ago, Cooper et al. ﬁ rst demonstrated that low birth weight  predicted altered 
female reproductive function  (Cooper et al., 1996). Since then, early life events have 
been associated with ovarian and breast cancer  (Elias et al., 2004), the timing of onset 
of menarche (Sloboda et al., 2007) and menopause (Elias et al., 2003) and factors likely 
to negatively impact on reproductive function (Elias et al., 2007; Ibanez and de Zegher, 
2006; de Zegher and Ibanez, 2009).
Studies of selected human populations have provided insight into the mechanisms 
that might underpin associations between early life events and reproductive function. 
Girls born at a low birth weight  (LBW) showed a marked reduction in ovarian and 
uterine size both during neonatal life and in adolescence (Ibanez et al., 2000; Ibanez 
et al., 2003) and demonstrated concentrations of gonadotrophins  that were persistently 
elevated by almost 50% at 18 years of age (Ibanez et al., 2003). It has been reported that 
growth restricted girls demonstrated a reduction in primordial follicle number  compared 
to gestationally matched appropriately grown infants (de Bruin et al., 1998; de Bruin 
et al., 2001), suggestive of reduced ovarian follicular reserve (Broekmans et al., 2006).
In large Caucasian cohorts, LBW and greater weight gain in childhood acted inde-
pendently to reduce the age at menarche (Adair, 2001; Cooper et al., 1996; Sloboda 
et al., 2007). Similar effects are seen in central fat distribution  and insulin sensitivity at 
age 8 years (Garnett et al., 2001; Ibanez et al., 2008). We have recently shown in a 
normal population of adolescent girls that birth weight and postnatal BMI predicted 
age at menarche (Sloboda et al., 2007). The earliest age at menarche  was seen in girls 
with lower than the median estimated birth weight and higher than the median BMI 
at 8 years of age. Our data, together with those previously reported, suggest that the 
association between intrauterine and postnatal growth patterns and age at menarche 
can be extended to encompass the entire birth weight range, and not simply selected 
growth-restricted populations (Sloboda et al., 2007).
Alterations in reproductive function have clear impacts on future generations and 
investigations of the transgenerational effects of early life events on reproductive func-
tion have increased in number. In women whose early menarche was associated with 
increased adult weight and shorter height, their offspring were more likely to be taller 
and fatter (Ong et al., 2007), pointing towards a feed forward cycle of obesity  and early 
reproductive maturation. Children of overweight and obese mothers are more likely to 
become obese and overweight putting them at risk of early pubertal maturation. The 
need to break this cycle of early maturation and obesity is essential, a cycle that likely 
results in subsequent re-programming of the next generation for the same fate.
Ovarian function is exquisitely sensitive to nutritional status and clinical and experi-
mental studies have demonstrated that a decline in ovarian follicular reserve, changes 
in ovulation rates and altered age at onset of menarche are all vulnerable to early life 
inﬂ uences (Gardner et al., 2009; Sloboda et al., 2009). Recently, reports suggest that 
nutritional quality as well as the source of macronutrients has been associated with pu-
bertal onset. Children with lower diet quality pre-puberty experienced pubertal growth 
spurt at an earlier age than children with a higher diet quality (Cheng et al., 2010). 
Further, protein intake from dairy but not animal meat particularly at age 5–6 years 
in childhood, was associated with earlier indices of puberty (pubertal growth spurt, 
menarche, voice break; Gunther et al., 2010). Intriguingly, these associations were 
independent of body mass index. Early life cues inﬂ uence development during critical

periods that extend prior to childhood and infancy right to conception and including 
the early embryonic or fetal period. Follow-up studies of survivors of the Dutch Hunger 
Winter  have attributed altered reproductive function in the offspring of mothers who 
experienced famine, to contrasting prenatal and postnatal nutritional status; although 
no signiﬁ cant effect on long term fertility was observed in this cohort (Lumey, 1998). 
However menstrual irregularity (Elias et al., 2007), decreased age at natural menopause 
(Elias et al., 2003), and increased risk of breast cancer  (Elias et al., 2004) were observed.
When considering present day social and cultural conditions however, the global-
ization of agriculture and food processing has changed worldwide food availability 
and the last thirty years have seen a 10-fold increase in the number of people with 
access to high caloric diets (Seidell, 1999; Seidell, 2000). Many studies of populations 
undergoing transition from relatively poor nutrition to a “Westernized” high fat and high 
carbohydrate diet have demonstrated that this transition may alter key health indices in 
adult life and lead to lifelong adverse effects, which may include impacts on reproduc-
tive function  (Victora et al., 2008). Together, with changes in the physical demands of 
work and increased mechanization (Seidell, 2000) a signiﬁ cant increase in the global 
incidence of obesity now exists. In developed countries, 15–20% of women between 
the ages of 25 and 55 years are obese (Seidell, 2000), and therefore have increased risks 
of infertility and cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Increasing numbers of women 
in developed countries are starting pregnancy overweight and gaining excess weight 
during pregnancy. In developed societies caloric and/or fat consumption are generally 
excessive and, maternal obesity  is now a common pregnancy complication (Catalano, 
2007). Importantly, these effects may be self-perpetuating, as offspring of obese mothers 
are themselves prone to obesity, giving rise to transgenerational effects (Armitage et al. 
2008; Shankar et al., 2008). The effects of maternal obesity on reproductive function in 
the offspring are unclear, although childhood obesity and insulin resistance is associated 
with early menarche, suggesting that reproductive and metabolic complications of 
offspring born to obese mothers are likely to go hand in hand (Armitage et al., 2005; 
Kaplowitz, 2008).
7.2 Animal studies
Much of what we know regarding nutrition and reproductive outcomes is derived from 
experimental studies in animals. Maternal protein restriction throughout pregnancy in 
the rat had either no effect on pubertal age in male and female offspring, but signiﬁ cantly 
reduced both long-term fertility  (Zambrano et al., 2005) and longevity in adult females 
(Guzman et al., 2006) or delayed pubertal onset and reduced Kiss1 mRNA levels in 
the hypothalamus (Iwasa et al., 2010). Experimental fetal growth restriction in the rat 
using uterine artery ligation  late in pregnancy delayed puberty in the offspring, as did 
late gestational and postnatal caloric restriction (Engelbregt et al., 2001; Leonhardt 
et al., 2003). Altered follicular development, reﬂ ected by an increased number of antral 
follicles of small size and reduced number of large sized antral/Graaﬁ an follicles has 
been reported following a maternal global dietary restriction  of 50%; this is consistent 
with increased circulating FSH levels observed at weaning. The reduced number of 
mature antral follicles implies that factors involved in later stage of follicular develop-
ment may be disturbed by perinatal maternal undernutrition (Leonhardt et al., 2003). 

62    7 Feast or Famine: In the fast lane to puberty
Maternal protein restriction during pregnancy or lactation resulted in delayed puberty  
and increased reproductive cycle length (Guzman et al., 2006). Similar results are also 
evident for maternal malnutrition occurring during lactation, via protein and energy 
restriction, with disrupted folliculogenesis  (reduction in primordial, large antral follicles 
and corpora lutea), altered levels of steroid hormone receptor isoforms and factors re-
quired for ovarian angiogenesis (Veiga Ferreira et al., 2010). Furthermore, decreased 
mRNA expression of key factors regulating ovarian function , namely aromatase, leptin 
and FSH, LH and leptin receptors are also observed in the ovaries of adult rat offspring 
(da Silva Faria et al., 2009).
Hilakivi-Clarke and colleagues demonstrated that consumption of a high-fat diet 
throughout pregnancy resulted in an early pubertal onset in the offspring independent 
of either changes in total body weight or caloric intake before puberty (Hilakivi-Clarke 
et al., 1997). It has been suggested that pubertal onset was accelerated in offspring of 
undernourished mothers to maintain the ability to reproduce in a high-risk environment 
and in offspring of high-fat fed mothers, advanced pubertal onset was to opportunisti-
cally enhance reproductive ﬁ tness (Sloboda et al., 2009). Although maternal nutritional 
adversity assigns effects on pubertal onset in offspring, the mechanisms underpinning 
these changes are largely unknown.
We have recently investigated both ‘feast’ and ‘famine’ conditions early in life effects 
on reproduction. We have shown that nutritional deﬁ cits and excesses during intrauter-
ine, lactational and post-weaning periods resulted in the acceleration of pubertal onset 
and subsequent changes in ovarian function (Sloboda et al., 2009).
In our studies, depending on the offspring’s nutritional history during the prenatal and 
lactational periods, subsequent nutrition and body weight gain did not further inﬂ uence 
offspring reproductive tempo and was rather dominated by prenatal nutrition (XFigs. 7.1 
and 7.2). These results suggest that nutrition during early critical  developmental  windows 
sets the tempo of reproductive development.

We also demonstrated that whereas maternal calorie restriction  led to early pubertal 
onset, it also resulted in a reduction in progesterone  concentrations in offspring later in 
life (XFig. 7.3).
In contrast, we found that maternal high fat feeding induced early maturation but was 
associated with elevated progesterone concentrations in adult offspring, although this 
reached statistical signiﬁ cance in the PLHF offspring only (XFig. 7.4). We suggest that 
two different developmental pathways in our study led to the acceleration of pubertal 
timing but with different consequences for ovarian function  (Sloboda et al., 2009).

The mechanisms underlying these changes are unclear. Altered oxidative stress con-
ditions may underpin many of the known associations between early life nutritional ad-
versity and altered later life physiologic function (Loui et al., 2009; Theys et al., 2009). 
Oxidative stress  plays an important role in normal reproductive processes and has been 
implicated in reproductive pathologies (Agarwal et al., 2006). It is possible that oxida-
tive stress may be the common link between early life nutritional insults and altered 
reproductive function. Although relatively little is known about the role of oxidative 
stress during intrauterine fetal development, experimental studies have documented the 
role of redox balance in the modiﬁ cation of gene expression and the deleterious effects 
of oxidized proteins contributing to cell toxicity, inﬂ ammation, apoptosis and endo-
thelial dysfunction (Luo et al., 2006). Mitochondrial function  was altered in embryos 
and oocytes of mothers that were nutritionally challenged (Igosheva et al., 2010). It is 
well recognized that disruption of redox homeostasis alters gene expression and that 
the accumulation of oxidized proteins has a deleterious effect on cell function (Chakra-
varti and Chakravarti, 2007). Although the accumulation of carbonylated proteins is 
a general marker of oxidative stress in damaged and aging tissue, the monitoring of 
speciﬁ c protein modiﬁ cations can provide additional insight into the nature and site of 
oxidative stress. The peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant thiol proteins, which includes 
the mitochondrial protein peroxiredoxin 3 (Prx 3), is responsible for breaking down 
endogenous hydroperoxides (Cox et al., 2010). Excess hydrogen peroxide can also 
hyperoxidize the active site cysteine of Prxs, thereby inactivating the protein (Cox et al., 
2009b; Musicco et al., 2009).
In our studies of maternal nutrient manipulation, we have observed that maternal 
undernutrition signiﬁ cantly reduced primordial, secondary and antral follicle number  in 
adult offspring in a manner that was dependent upon the timing of nutrient restriction. 
Speciﬁ cally, a reduction in early stage follicle populations was observed in offspring 
born to mothers undernourished throughout both pregnancy and lactation, whereas 
antral follicles were reduced in offspring born to all mothers that were undernutrition

regardless of whether the period of undernutrition was restricted to pregnancy or 
lactation or both (unpublished observations). These reductions were associated with 
decreased mRNA levels of genes critical for follicle maturation and ovulation. We also 
demonstrated increased ovarian oxidative stress in offspring born to undernourished 
mothers regardless of the timing of the undernutrition. However, only those mothers 
whose undernutrition included the period of pregnancy produced offspring with re-
duced ovarian peroxidoxin 3 mRNA levels (unpublished observations). We hypothesize 
that this reduction may be suggestive of an inability to cope with increased oxida-
tive stress conditions. Taken together, we propose that these data support the possi-
bility that maternal undernutrition, especially during the period of pregnancy, results 
in  accelerated ovarian ageing in offspring.
7.3 Conclusions
Our ﬁ ndings speciﬁ cally highlight the importance of the prenatal environment and 
further contribute to the mounting evidence for the inﬂ uence of early life factors, in 
particular maternal nutrition, on reproductive function in later life. Disorders of repro-
ductive health are increasingly common and are of major public health importance in 
both developed and developing societies. Further studies will provide better insight 
into the mechanisms underlying these processes and may have signiﬁ cant implications 
not only for the current understanding of reproductive pathologies but also for future 
generations’ reproductive ability.

8  Early life origins of diabetes and obesity: General 
aspects and the thin – fat baby paradigm
Chittaranjan S. Yajnik, Urmila S. Deshmukh
The increasing realization that obesity and type 2 diabetes are best prevented has focused 
researchers’ attention on the inﬂ uence of early life factors. The environment in utero has been 
shown to program the body composition and metabolic-endocrine axes, which  determine 
the individual’s adaptability to later-life exposures. Accumulating evidence suggests that epi-
genetic mechanisms contribute to this programming. Thus, maternal factors (nutrition and 
metabolism) that inﬂ uence the in utero milieu have a large role to play in the primordial 
prevention of chronic diseases. Optimizing adolescent health rather than focusing only on 
adult lifestyle modiﬁ cations would be much more beneﬁ cial and cost effective in preventing 
obesity and diabetes.
8.1 Introduction
The escalating burden of chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer is well recognized, although these 
do not appear in the millennium development goals. Obesity  and diabetes  are now 
epidemic in many economically developing and newly industrialized nations (low and 
middle income countries [LMIC]), and are considered to be the most challenging health 
problems in the 21st century. These conditions affect a very large number of people; 
more than 1 billion adults are overweight in the world (World Health Organization, 
2010), and 285 million people are diabetic (International Diabetes Federation, 2009). 
Together, the two are major contributors to the global burden of chronic diseases and 
disability.
The current dogma proposes that obesity, diabetes, and other related disorders have 
a genetic susceptibility and are precipitated by adult lifestyle factors, including poor 
diet and lack of physical activity. Recent diabetes prevention trials have therefore tar-
geted the middle-aged, obese, and glucose-intolerant subjects for primary prevention  
of  diabetes. We consider these as attempts to ﬁ x the problem after the horse has bolted.
There is increasing interest in the newly established ﬁ eld of developmental origins 
of health and disease (International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and 
Disease, 2010). Recent discoveries have highlighted that intrauterine factors inﬂ uence 
susceptibility to NCDs by nongenetic mechanisms. This has led to a growing belief in 
the possibility of primordial prevention of diabetes and related disorders.
This review focuses on the impact of the intrauterine environment on the risk of 
diabetes and obesity in later life.

70    8 Early life origins of diabetes and obesity
8.2 Nutrition and diabetes
It is interesting to see the evolution of ideas in this ﬁ eld. In 1965, a WHO Expert Com-
mittee on diabetes commented, “evidence that malnutrition protects adult populations 
from diabetes seems unassailable” (World Health Organization, 1965). In 1980, another 
WHO Expert Committee wrote, “malnutrition is probably a major determinant of diabe-
tes” (World Health Organization, 1980). They introduced a new category: malnutrition-
related diabetes mellitus (MRDM). However, in 1997 the Expert Committee dropped 
the entity of MRDM from their classiﬁ cation (The Expert Committee Report, 1997). Even 
though there can be no doubt that overnutrition precipitates type 2 diabetes (T2D), it is 
relevant that India, the world’s capital of diabetes, also ﬁ gures prominently in the world 
hunger map. In addition to holding more than 50 million diabetic patients in 2010, 
India also holds the largest number of low birth weight (LBW) babies and more than 
8 million severely undernourished children. These statistics point toward contribution 
of both early life undernutrition  and later life overnutrition in the etiology of T2D. Our 
research focused attention on these factors by describing the thin – fat Indian diabetic 
patient (Yajnik et al., 2002), which refers to poor lean mass and a relative excess of fat 
mass, especially deposited in and around the abdomen. More excitingly, we described 
that the small and thin Indian baby was adipose (Yajnik et al., 2003), thus focusing the 
attention on intrauterine life as an important determinant of the epidemic of diabetes 
and CVD.
Our ﬁ ndings were stimulated by the research of Hales and Barker, who caused a 
sensation in the 1980s by describing an association between birth weight  and risk of 
diabetes (Hales and Barker, 1992). They proposed that fetal undernutrition disturbed 
the development of fetal pancreas and also promoted insulin resistance (IR) in various 
organs. Thus, low birth weight predicted diabetes, which they called the “thrifty pheno-
type” hypothesis . This idea was variously expressed as “fetal origins of adult diseases,” 
“small baby syndrome ,” etc. During this period considerable stress was given on low 
birth weight, though Barker and his colleagues had described a continuous and graded 
association of the birth weight (Barker, 1997).
One of the difﬁ culties for the scientists to appreciate the association of lower birth 
weight with diabetes was the previously described association between macrosomia 
and future risk of diabetes in babies born to diabetic mothers . These two ideas have 
stimulated a considerable amount of research in the link between intrauterine growth 
and future risk of diabetes. This chapter discusses some aspects of this association.
8.3 Maternal nutrition, fetal growth, and future health
More than 50 years ago, McCance wrote, ‘The size attained in utero depends on the 
services which the mother is able to supply; these are mainly food and accommodation’ 
(McCance, 1962). Thus, maternal size and the nutrients transferred through placenta 
determine the size of the fetus.
Pedersen and Freinkel were the ﬁ rst to highlight the role of maternal diabetes in 
inﬂ uencing the long-term health of the offspring. Pedersen proposed that maternal 
glucose and other fuels cross the placenta and cause fetal islet hyperplasia and hy-
perinsulinism, which causes overgrowth in insulin sensitive organs (Pedersen, 1977). 

8.3 Maternal nutrition, fetal growth, and future health    71
Freinkel expanded the use of the term teratogenesis  from the conventional reference to 
fetal malformation to include fetal macrosomia  and future obesity and diabetes (fuel-
mediated teratogenesis) (Freinkel, 1980) (XFig. 8.1).
During development, different organs and systems are susceptible to the maternal 
metabolic changes at different times based on the developmental schedule. Freinkel 
(1980) suggested that pregestational diabetes, which affects the fetus until conception, 
would have more wide-ranging effects than gestational diabetes (GDM), which begins 
later. Severity of maternal metabolic disturbance will determine the size of the effect.
Data from Pima Indians  in Arizona, US, showed that the risk of obesity and  diabetes 
was higher in offspring who were born to mothers who were diabetic during the preg-
nancy, compared with those born to nondiabetic mothers and mothers with pre-diabetes 
(Pettitt et al., 1988). This ﬁ nding indicates a stronger role for intrauterine hyperglycemia 
in the etiology of obesity and diabetes compared to genetics. However, it is possible 
that mothers who are diagnosed with diabetes at a younger age might transmit an excess 
of genetic risk. A subsequent study of siblings  in the same population showed that 
those born after the mother was diagnosed with diabetes were heavier and more likely 
to have diabesity (diabetes and obesity) compared with those who were born before 
mother was diagnosed with diabetes (Dabelea, Hanson, and Lindsay, 2000). There was 
no  corresponding paternal inﬂ uence. These ﬁ ndings conﬁ rm a role for pregnancy hyper-
glycemia rather than genetics or postnatal environment in the risk of childhood obesity. 
Studies in Chicago (Silverman et al., 1995) showed similar ﬁ ndings in the offspring 
of diabetic mothers and also showed an association between amniotic ﬂ uid insulin 
concentration and risk of obesity-hyperglycemia in the offspring.
On the other hand, a follow-up study of people born in Hertfordshire, UK, demon-
strated that lower birth weight increased the risk of diabetes and associated disorders 
(Barker, 1997). Interesting ﬁ ndings were reported in children of Dutch women who 
were exposed to Hunger Winter , providing a more direct proof of association between

Fig. 8.1: Fuel-mediated teratogenesis of Pedersen and Freinkel. Maternal fuels cross the placenta 
and inﬂ uence islet development and fetal insulin secretion. In diabetic pregnancies there is islet 
hyperplasia, hyperinsulinism, and excess growth of insulin responsive tissues and organs. This 
leads to macrosomia, perinatal metabolic problems, and early onset obesity and type 2 diabetes 
(modiﬁ ed from Freinkel, 1980).

intrauterine undernutrition and risk of NCDs (Roseboom, de Rooij, and Painter, 2006). 
One of the ﬁ rst studies involving these offspring showed that if the exposure to famine 
was in the third trimester of pregnancy, offspring were less likely to be obese in adult 
life, but exposure to famine during the ﬁ rst and second trimesters was associated with 
higher risk of obesity (Ravelli, Stein, and Susser, 1976).
Subsequent to the demonstration of the association of birth weight and type 2 diabetes, 
Lucas deﬁ ned fetal programming as “a process whereby a stimulus applied in utero 
establishes a permanent response in the fetus leading to enhanced susceptibility to 
later disease” (Lucas, 1991). There is now ample evidence that maternal nutritional 
imbalance involving both macro- and micronutrients has a programming effect on 
the fetus. Data on the role of speciﬁ c nutrients is now accumulating from animal and 
human studies. We have coined the term nutrient-mediated teratogenesis  to describe 
this  phenomenon (Yajnik, 2009).
Maternal obesity without hyperglycemia can also have substantial effect on the risk 
of obesity in the child (Catalano et al., 2009). This raises the possibility that nonglu-
cose fuels (e.g., lipids) might also be important. In clinical practice we have been too 
glucocentric and have forgotten about the original concept of mixed nutrients in the 
teratogenic process.
8.4  Developmental plasticity, programming, teratogenesis, 
and predictive adaptive res ponse
The ability of the growing fetus to respond to the environmental cues and assume dif-
ferent sizes and functional characteristics is called developmental plasticity  (Bateson, 
Barker, and Clutton-Brock, 2004). It describes the ability of the fetus to achieve differ-
ent phenotypes with a given genotype. An intrauterine challenge puts constraint on 
the structural and functional development of the fetus, limiting its ability to respond 
effectively to a changing environment. It is thought that the fetus perceives these en-
vironmental cues as indicative of the postnatal environment, and the adaptations are 
appropriate for such an environment (predictive adaptive response ) (Gluckman, Han-
son, and Spencer, 2005). If the postnatal environment is different, the adaptations may 
become inappropriate, and the individual has an increased susceptibility to disease.
The concept of nutrient-mediated teratogenesis and fuel-mediated teratogenesis  refers 
to different ends of the spectrum of the effects of nutritional and metabolic challenges 
in utero, and can be looked upon as the two sides of the same coin. We have used 
the term dual teratogenesis  to describe the situation in rapidly transiting populations 
(XFig. 8.2) (Yajnik, 2009).
Intrauterine undernutrition produces small, thin, and adipose babies who are insulin 
resistant and remain so (small, thin, and insulin resistant) if postnatal nutrition is not 
excessive. These individuals have low rates of NCD, as seen in rural populations in 
India. Postnatal overnutrition promotes obesity and hyperglycemia, frequently without 
correction of the micronutrient deﬁ ciencies. For example, in a study in Mysore, India, 
GDM was associated with low circulating vitamin B12  concentrations (Krishnaveni 
et al., 2009). In such a condition, the fetus is exposed to multiple adverse programming 
inﬂ uences, resulting in a phenotype of excess adiposity, pancreatic islet dysfunction, 
and a tendency toward diabetes and CVD at a young age. Such a dual teratogenesis

is proposed to contribute to the rapidly rising epidemic of obesity – diabetes in modern 
India (Yajnik, 2009).
8.5  Birth weight: An exposure, an intermediate variable, 
or only a marker?
It is important to note that the biological association between birth weight and dia-
betes is U-shaped, that is, both low and high birth weight are associated with higher 
risk of diabetes. The risk associated with large birth weight is mostly ascribed to the 
effect of maternal hyperglycemia, but risk of maternal obesity also is increasingly 
recognized.
A recently published systematic review (Whincup et al., 2008) covering data from 
31 populations examined the association of birth weight and type 2 diabetes in 152,084 
individuals, including 6,090 diabetes cases. The association between birth weight 
and type 2 diabetes was inverse in 23 populations (statistically signiﬁ cant in 9) and 
positive in 8 (statistically signiﬁ cant in 2 native North American populations). Overall,

Fig. 8.2: The ﬁ gure shows the interrelationship of two major maternal factors (undernutrition 
and overnutrition) in fetal programming. An undernourished mother produces a small (thin-
fat), insulin resistant baby. If this baby remains undernourished in postnatal life, the cycle 
is propagated. If the thin-fat insulin-resistant baby is overnourished it becomes obese and 
hyperglycemic. An obese and hyperglycemic mother produces a macrosomic baby at higher 
risk of obesity and hyperglycemia. Thus, the intergenerational insulin resistance – diabetes cycle 
is propagated through a girl child. Rapid transition shifts the balance from undernutrition to 
overnutrition and contributes to escalation of the diabetes epidemic. Improving health of a girl 
child is of paramount importance in controlling the diabetes epidemic (Yajnik, 2009).

1 kg increase in birth weight reduced type 2 diabetes risk by 25%, and by 30% after 
adjusting for adult BMI. The association was strongly graded and continuous (XFig. 8.3).
It is important to understand that the story is not about birth weight but about fetal 
programming and that intergenerational prevention of type 2 diabetes and obesity will 
need to target maternal nutrition and metabolism.
8.6 Role of postnatal growth 
Longitudinal follow up in birth cohorts from both developing and developed popu-
lations has helped our understanding of the interactions between intrauterine and 
 postnatal growth and risk of type 2 diabetes and CVD.
In the Pune Children’s Study (PCS) at the King Edward Memorial Hospital, Pune, 
we followed up more than 400 children whose birth weights were available from the 
labor-room record. At 4 years of age we studied their anthropometry, glucose tolerance , 
and circulating insulin  concentrations. We demonstrated that after oral glucose load, 
30 min plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were inversely related to the birth 
weight (Yajnik et al., 1995). This provided the ﬁ rst proof for Barker’s hypothesis  in a 
developing country. We followed up these children at 8 years of age to study their 
metabolic characteristics. In addition to conﬁ rming the association of low birth weight 
with increased insulin resistance , we observed that the levels of risk factors for diabetes 
and CVD (glucose, insulin resistance, lipids, blood pressure, leptin concentrations, etc.) 
were highest in children who were born the lightest but were heaviest at 8 years of age

Fig. 8.3: Associations of birth weight with type 2 diabetes. The biological association appears 
to be U-shaped, that is, both low and high birth weight are associated with the risk of diabetes. 
Depending on the relative role of maternal undernutrition (nutrient-mediated teratogenesis) and 
overnutrition (fuel-mediated teratogenesis), the shape of the graph varies as shown from the 
systematic review by Whincup et al. (Compiled from Yajnik, 2004 and Whincup et al., 2008).

8.7 Contributions of the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study    75
(Bavdekar et al., 1999). The offspring from New Delhi Birth Cohort who are followed 
from birth were studied at 28 years of age (Bhargava et al., 2004). Those who were dia-
betic were born lighter, had grown slower during infancy but had grown progressively 
faster from 3 years of age, and had an earlier adiposity rebound  compared to those who 
were normal glucose tolerant.
Glucose tolerance was tested in adults participating in the Helsinki Birth Cohort 
Study (1934–1944) (Eriksson et al., 2006). Both, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 
diabetes, were associated with low birthweight ( p < 0.0001, adjusting for current BMI), 
and low weight gain between birth and 2 years increased the risk. A one standard devia-
tion (SD) increase in weight at 2 years protected against hyperglycemia (odds ratio [OR] 
0.76, 95% conﬁ dence interval [CI] 0.69–0.84); the effect was greatest in those with low 
birth weight. Thus, this study deﬁ ned intrauterine life, infancy, and childhood as critical 
periods for future risk of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.
8.7 Contributions of the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study
The Pune Maternal Nutrition Study (PMNS) cohort was established between 1992 and 
1996 in six villages near Pune, India, to investigate the inﬂ uence of maternal body size  
and nutrition during pregnancy  on fetal growth and future metabolic risks in the off-
spring (Rao et al., 2001). More than 800 pregnancies were studied. The average mother 
in the PMNS was aged 21 years, weighed 42 kg (BMI 18.1 kg/m2), and had a dietary in-
take of 1700 kcal/day and 45 g proteins/day during pregnancy. The newborns weighed

on average 2700 g with a ponderal index of 24.1 kg/cm3; 28% were LBW (< 2500g). In 
comparison with babies born in the UK (3500 g, ponderal index 27.3 kg/cm3), Indian 
babies were lighter, shorter (47.3 cm vs. 50.2 cm), and thinner, but the sub-scapular 
skin-fold measurements were relatively well preserved (z score 0.53; 95% CI 0.61, 
0.46) (XFig. 8.4) (Yajnik et al., 2002, 2003). Thus, the Indian babies were short and 
thin but fat, corroborating our description of Indian adults.
Recently, we compared whole body magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) measurements 
of adipose tissue and its distribution in healthy full-term Indian babies (Pune) with those 
in white European newborns (London, UK) (Modi et al., 2009). Though smaller in weight 
(95% CI for difference 0.757 to 0.385 kg, p < 0.001), head circumference (2.15 
to 0.9 cm, p < 0.001) and length (2.9 to 1.1 cm p < 0.001), the Indian babies had 
similar whole body adipose tissue content (0.175 to 0.034 l, p = 0.2) (XFig. 8.5).
Adipose tissue distribution was distinctly different. Indian babies had signiﬁ cantly 
greater absolute adiposity in all three abdominal compartments, internal (visceral) 
(0.012 to 0.023 l, p < 0.001), deep subcutaneous (0.003 to 0.017 l, p = 0.006), and su-
perﬁ cial subcutaneous (0.006 to 0.043 l, p = 0.011) but a signiﬁ cant reduction in non-
abdominal superﬁ cial subcutaneous adipose tissue (0.184 to 0.029 l, p = 0.008). 
Thus, this study conﬁ rmed that differences in adipose tissue distribution exist at birth, 
which could be an important risk factor for diabetes and related disorders. Conventional 
measurements of birth size are not sensitive to these vital differences. Further research 
must focus on periconceptional, intrauterine, and early postnatal exposures that modify 
the tissue deposition pattern. In yet another study we demonstrated higher insulin and 
leptin concentrations but lower adiponectin  concentrations in the cord blood  of Indian 
babies compared to the European babies (XFig. 8.4) (Yajnik et al., 2002).

8.8 Genetics and epigenetics of fetal growth and diabetes-obesity    77
The PMNS also improved our knowledge of maternal determinants of fetal growth. 
More frequent intake of green leafy vegetables, fruit, and milk (foods rich in micronutri-
ents) by mother predicted larger newborn size, whereas macronutrient  intake (calories 
and proteins) did not, highlighting the importance of micronutrients  in fetal growth (Rao 
et al., 2001). About two-thirds of women had low vitamin B12  concentrations; hardly 
anyone was folate deﬁ cient. About one-third had high total homocysteine  (tHcy) con-
centrations, and more than 90% had high methyl malonic acid (MMA) concentrations, 
attributable to the deﬁ ciency of vitamin B12 (Yajnik et al., 2008).
High maternal tHcy concentration predicted intrauterine growth restriction (Yajnik 
et al., 2005). Higher maternal frequency of consumption of green leafy vegetables and 
milk and higher erythrocyte folate concentrations during pregnancy predicted higher 
offspring adiposity at 6 years. The effect of maternal folate was exaggerated by vitamin 
B12 deﬁ ciency; the offspring of mothers who had lowest vitamin B12 and highest folate 
 concentrations were the most insulin resistant (XFig. 8.6) (Yajnik et al., 2008).
Thus, attention was focused on the importance of maternal one-carbon metabolism 
for fetal growth and programming of diabetes and related disorders. One-carbon me-
tabolism is important for nucleic acid and protein synthesis and epigenetic methylation 
of DNA. This regulates cellular growth and differentiation.
8.8 Genetics and epigenetics of fetal growth and diabetes-obesity
Do genetic factors have a role in fetal growth and programming of NCDs? One obvious 
pathway to investigate was insulin mediated fetal growth, which was proposed as an im-
portant mechanism for fuel-mediated teratogenesis. Hattersley et al. (1998) investigated 
the possibility that genetic determinants of insulin secretion and activity could explain 
the association between fetal size and future risk of diabetes (fetal insulin hypothesis ).

B12 and highest folate concentrations (Yajnik et al., 2008).

78    8 Early life origins of diabetes and obesity
They investigated the inﬂ uence of the glucokinase gene  (GCK) on fetal growth, and 
showed an important interaction between maternal genotype (GCK mutation) and 
phenotype (hyperglycemia) with fetal genotype in inﬂ uencing offspring birth weight 
(Hattersley et al., 1998). After the discovery of many type 2 diabetes predisposing poly-
morphisms in the genome wide association studies (GWAS), they have demonstrated 
that some of these markers are also associated with birth weight (e.g., fat mass and 
obesity-associated gene [FTO]). Additionally, in GWAS of birth weight (Freathy et al., 
2009), they found that some of the polymorphisms predicting birth weight are also type 
2 diabetes genes. These ﬁ ndings will no doubt improve our understanding of regulation 
of fetal growth and etiology of type 2 diabetes. However, the effect of maternal nutrition 
and metabolism is crucial for fetal growth. This is obvious from the variability of birth 
weight between and within populations, between the ﬁ rst and later pregnancies, and 
from the description of a reduction in offspring birth weight after maternal bariatric 
surgery (Smith et al., 2009).
Animal data also highlights the role of maternal rather than paternal inﬂ uence on 
fetal growth. It is interesting, however, that skeletal growth of the fetus seems to be more 
inﬂ uenced by paternal factors (presumably genetic) (Knight et al., 2005).
One recent exciting development is the discovery of the factors regulating gene ex-
pression. These factors have improved our understanding of the interactions between 
the environment and genes. Developmental plasticity is largely a function of regula-
tion of gene function. Waddington called these processes epigenetic (Van Spebroeck, 
2002). Current understanding is that the methylation  of DNA bases, acetylation of 
histones, and noncoding RNAs (iRNA) are important mechanisms that regulate the 
gene expression. Methylation of cytosine residues in the cytosine-phosphatidyl-
guanosine (CpG) islands is regulated by methyl donors in the diet, including folate, 
vitamin B12, betaine, and choline (Waterland and Jirtle, 2003). Our demonstration of 
the role of folate  and vitamin B12  in regulation of fetal growth, body composition, and 
programming of insulin resistance  therefore assumes a special signiﬁ cance (Yajnik 
et al., 2008).
Waterland and Jirtle (2003) fed agouti mice with a methylating cocktail during preg-
nancy. The progeny had varying coat color and were less obese compared to controls, 
despite inheriting the same genotype. This was related to methylation of the promoter 
region of the agouti gene , which is responsible for determining coat color. Such epi-
genetic changes are heritable for many generations and potentially may be involved in 
fetal programming.
This idea is also supported by experiments in sheep. Ewes were made methionine 
deﬁ cient, their ova were fertilized in vitro, and the blastocysts were transferred to 
surrogate mothers with normal methionine status (Sinclair et al., 2007). The offspring 
(especially males) were obese and insulin resistant and had alterations in DNA methyla-
tion at a number of sites within the genome. Epigenetic regulation of glucocorticoid 
receptor  and peroxisome proliferator activator alpha (PPAR-α) gene s have been shown 
to be involved in fetal programming due to a low protein diet in rodents (Lillycrop et al., 
2005). The ﬁ rst evidence in humans supporting the hypothesis that early-life environ-
mental conditions can cause epigenetic changes in humans that persist throughout life 
has been provided in the Dutch Hunger Winter Families Study  (Heijmans et al., 2008). 
They showed that individuals who were prenatally exposed to famine during the Dutch 
Hunger Winter in 1944–45 had, 6 decades later, less DNA methylation of the imprinted 

References    79
IGF2 gene compared with their unexposed, same-sex siblings. The association was 
 speciﬁ c for periconceptional exposure.
The GWAS polymorphisms associated with birth weight, obesity, and type 2 diabetes 
are the obvious candidates for future epigenetic studies to inform on the important 
environmental regulators.
8.9 Conclusion
We suggest a modiﬁ cation to the conventional gene-lifestyle dogma of type 2 diabetes. 
The susceptibility to diabetes and other NCDs is also inﬂ uenced by epigenetic processes 
and fetal programming. Maternal nutrition and metabolism are major determinants of 
these processes. Prevention of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other NCDs should start 
with improvement of the health of young girls who would be mothers tomorrow. The 
current models of diabetes prevention in postreproductive, obese, glucose intolerant 
women are unlikely to reduce the escalating epidemic in the young. Along with efforts 
to control hyperglycemia in the elderly, there is an urgent need to plan intergenera-
tional prevention  by improving nutrition and metabolism of young girls before concep-
tion. This could provide a multigenerational beneﬁ t and should be the focus of future 
research.

9  The outcome in offspring of obese mothers: 
Clinical and experimental aspects
Lucilla Poston
Obesity amongst pregnant women has increased in recent decades and has become a major 
concern for health care providers because of the associated risk of morbidity and mortality for 
mother and child. Increasingly it is recognized that there may be longer term consequences 
for the infant, with evidence supporting a role for an independent association between expo-
sure to maternal obesity in utero and the risk of later obesity. Observational and prospective 
mother-child cohort studies provide an increasing evidence base for this ‘transgenerational 
transfer’ of obesity risk but causality is difﬁ cult to establish. Animal models have provided 
strong and consistent supportive data and also have shed light on mechanistic pathways, 
notably the likelihood that maternal humoral factors adversely inﬂ uence development of the 
hypothalamus leading to irreversible changes in energy balance. These and other recent stud-
ies highlighting the presence of hypertension in young offspring of obese rodents are begin-
ning to inﬂ uence protocol design in human – child cohorts and have considerable potential 
to inform intervention studies in obese women to reduce the incidence of childhood obesity.
9.1 Introduction
The number of obese adults is predicted to rise to over 700 million by 2015 (World 
Health Organization, 2006). More than 42 million children under 5 are estimated as 
overweight  and childhood obesity  tracks strongly to adolescence and adulthood (Reilly 
et al., 2003; Wardle et al., 2006). Because of associated morbidity and mortality, this 
world wide epidemic of obesity is likely to lead to a reversal in the trend of longer life 
expectancy (Franks et al., 2010; Olshansky et al., 2005).
Amongst the many complications of obesity are those which inﬂ uence reproductive 
health. Inevitably, in recent years, the numbers of obese pregnant women have increased 
in parallel with the incidence of obesity in the general population. Few countries have 
nationally available statistics but cohort studies in the UK show upward trajectories 
in pregnant women (Heslehurst et al., 2010), and in the United States, approximately 
20% of Americans are obese when they become pregnant (Chu et al., 2009; Kim et al., 
2007). Obesity in pregnancy presents a substantial increase in risk for the health of the 
mother and her unborn child. Obese women have a higher than average risk of early 
pregnancy loss, gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia  and are more likely to suffer 
from complications in labor and post partum haemorrhage. Their infants are at greater 
risk of congenital anomalies, macrosomia , still birth and of complications in early post 
natal life (Nelson et al., 2010). These and a wide range of other maternal and infant 

84    9 The outcome in offspring of obese mothers
complications are likely to arise from the profoundly altered maternal metabolic state 
associated with obesity. Obese pregnant women demonstrate marked peripheral and 
hepatic insulin resistance (Sivan et al., 1997) and in the post-prandial state, the circula-
tory increase in metabolic fuels; glucose, lipids and amino acids facilitate transfer of 
excess nutrients to the fetus (Nelson et al., 2010). Whilst the immediate consequences 
of this are apparent in the demonstration of increased birthweight and adiposity infants 
of obese women (Hull et al., 2008; Sewell et al., 2006), there may be longer term con-
sequences of pre-natal exposure to maternal obesity for the health of the child, notably 
an increased risk of obesity in later life.
9.2 Associations between obesity in mother and child
Parental obesity  is a strong risk factor for childhood obesity, with many reports iden-
tifying associations between paternal or maternal obesity  and offspring BMI (Lake 
et al., 1997). With regard to the inﬂ uence of obesity in pregnancy on the developing 
child, numerous observational studies have reported independent associations between 
maternal BMI  as measured in pregnancy and the BMI of the offspring in childhood 
and adulthood (Koupil and Toivanen, 2008; Laitinen et al., 2001; Li et al., 2005; Li 
et al., 2007; Reilly et al., 2005; Salsberry and Reagan, 2005; Whitaker, 2004). However, 
BMI provides a poor index of fat mass , and interpretation is confounded by the lack 
of accurate body compositional analysis in either the mother or the child, or both. 
Nonetheless, in the few reports where associations between maternal BMI/adiposity 
in pregnancy and offspring adiposity have been addressed, an independent and posi-
tive association has also been reported (Blair et al., 2007; Burdette et al., 2006; Gale 
et al., 2007; Mingrone et al., 2008). Importantly, if there were to be a speciﬁ c added risk 
of obesity to the child from an in utero inﬂ uence, a stronger association of the child’s 
BMI or adiposity with maternal obesity than with paternal obesity would be expected. 
Relatively few studies have both maternal and paternal weight data available at the time 
of the index pregnancy but several have shown a stronger association of maternal than 
paternal BMI with offspring BMI (Catalano et al., 2009; Lawlor et al., 2007; Lawlor et al., 
2008; Pirkola et al., 2010; Salsberry and Reagan, 2005). In one investigation from the 
UK ALSPAC cohort , the predominant maternal effect was reported to be explicable by 
inheritance of the variant of the FTO gene  association with obesity (Lawlor et al., 2008). 
However, most of the larger studies have relied upon self-reported parental weights and 
heights, and some may have inherent bias when paternal height and weight is supplied 
by the mother, as in the ALSPAC cohort (Davey Smith et al., 2007). In a recent study 
using data pooled from the Annual Health Surveys for England in which parental BMI 
was directly measured (but not during pregnancy), a strong and graded association 
was found between parental weight status and risk of childhood obesity, which was 
signiﬁ cantly stronger for maternal weight (Whitaker et al., 2010). This was interpreted 
as possibly supporting a role for a direct inﬂ uence of the maternal environment but, as 
recognized by the authors, this association may have alternative explanations such as 
the role played by the mother in determining the diet of the child, speciﬁ cally because 
of the recognized lower degree of control of familial diets among families with obese 
mothers (Wardle et al., 2002).

9.2 Associations between obesity in mother and child    85
9.2.1 Gestational weight gain and childhood obesity
Excessive gestational weight gain  (GWG) is associated with adverse pregnancy out-
come (Rasmussen and Yaktine, 2009) and an association between GWG and offspring 
BMI has been reported by some (Kleiser et al., 2009; Mamun et al., 2009; Moreira 
et al., 2007; Oken et al., 2007; Oken et al., 2008), but not all investigations (Catalano 
et al., 1995; Koupil and Toivanen, 2008). Two recent studies have addressed relation-
ships between gestational weight gain and childhood fat mass, as directly measured, 
and both of these have reported positive associations (Crozier et al., 2010; Fraser et al., 
2010).
9.2.2 Association or causality?
In light of current evidence it is not possible to attribute causality  to relationships 
between maternal obesity or gestational weight gain and the risk of obesity in the 
child. To date no prospective randomised trial in obese pregnant women has deter-
mined whether or not an intervention can reduce adiposity in the child which, if 
proven, would provide strong support for causality. Several small studies have at-
tempted to improve pregnancy outcome through lifestyle interventions in obese 
women but although a few have shown a reduction in gestational weight gain, 
none was powered to address neonatal outcome or for relevant outcomes in the 
children beyond infancy (Nelson et al., 2009; Ronnberg and Nilsson, 2010). In the 
absence of interventional trials, several observational cohort studies have addressed 
the role of potential modiﬁ ers of the relationship between obesity in mother and 
child, including shared dietary and physical activities, and some have shown little 
modiﬁ cation effect. However few cohorts have the capability to address the potential 
confounding inﬂ uence of all the recognized early life determinants of childhood obe-
sity, including duration of breast-feeding, maternal smoking, short duration of child-
hood hours of sleep and a rapid post natal growth trajectory (Gillman et al., 2008; 
Monasta et al., 2010). Furthermore only one attempt has been made to address the 
role of shared genetic susceptibility in deﬁ ning the more pronounced maternal BMI 
versus paternal BMI association with childhood obesity (Lawlor et al., 2008). Several 
large intervention studies  currently underway in obese pregnant women have the 
potential to directly address the validity of the hypothesis of maternal-child ‘transmis-
sion’ of obesity, and by determination of obesity related genetic traits, identify the role 
of gene-environment interactions (Nelson et al., 2010). According to the hypothesis, 
a reduction of pre-pregnancy BMI would also have the potential to reduce offspring 
adiposity, but hitherto no RCT has recruited women to a weight loss regime or normal 
care prior to pregnancy and followed the children to assess the effect on childhood 
adiposity. One report indicates that pre-pregnancy weight loss reduces the risk of 
obesity in the child; increasing numbers of morbidly obese women are undergoing 
surgical intervention  to promote weight loss and this observational study has shown 
that children born to women after biliopancreatic diversion bariatric surgery have a 
lower risk of obesity than siblings born before their mother had surgery (Smith et al., 
2009). This certainly infers, but does not prove, an inﬂ uence of the maternal in utero 
 environment on offspring obesity risk.

9.3 Experimental models of maternal obesity
Whilst observational studies from human cohorts have provided a strong rationale 
for pursuit of the hypothesis of transgenerational ‘transmission of obesity’, the current 
evidence base is less than adequate to inform public health  strategy. Because of the 
rapid expansion of supporting evidence, national and international public health rec-
ommendations and guidelines have highlighted the immediate need for intervention 
studies in obese women to conﬁ rm or refute the hypothesis (National Institute for Health 
and Clinical Excellence, 2010; Poston et al., 2011), and several are underway. How-
ever, the optimal intervention should be developed from a sound understanding of the 
 underlying mechanistic pathways, and in this regard animal models have the potential 
to provide important insight.
Several laboratories, including our own, have addressed the hypothesis that mater-
nal obesity predisposes the progeny to obesity in later life. We have investigated the 
offspring of obese dams  in an experimental design in which female rats and mice are 
fed a sugar and fat rich highly palatable diet before pregnancy and during pregnancy 
and lactation ( Nivoit et al., 2009; Samuelsson et al., 2008). Adult offspring develop an 
increase in fat mass with age (Samuelsson et al., 2008). As these observations parallel 
many from other laboratories, the transgenerational transmission of obesity  in rodents 
is reproducible and occurs in different strains of mice and rats, despite diverse dietary 
protocols used for generation of maternal obesity (Bayol et al., 2007; Chang et al., 2008; 
Dunn and Bale, 2009; Ferezou-Viala et al., 2007; Levin and Govek, 1998; Sen and 
Simmons, 2010; Shankar et al., 2008; Srinivasan et al., 2006). The variety of maternal 
diets  might suggest that obesity per se rather than elements of the diet are responsible 
for the ‘programming’ of offspring obesity. However, distinction between the relative 
inﬂ uence of maternal obesity and diet represents a practical challenge in study design, 
although one elegantly designed investigation in which the weight of rats dams fed an 
obesogenic diet was maintained at the control level by pair feeding to controls sug-
gested that maternal fat mass was the critical determinant, since the offspring as the 
pair fed animals maintained the same weight as controls (White et al., 2009). Other 
investigators consider that the increased saturated fat content of an obesogenic diet 
alone is adequate for development of offspring obesity (Carmody et al., 2010). Also, in 
a recent study of non-human primates in which Japanese macaque monkeys were fed a 
high fat diet during pregnancy  the offspring developed increased adiposity at 6 months 
of age (McCurdy et al., 2009), which was independent of maternal weight and therefore 
considered to be induced by an element of the diet. Several studies in which rodents 
have been fed puriﬁ ed diets with differing fat composition during pregnancy have dem-
onstrated widely differing effects on the offspring phenotype depending on the fatty acid 
composition (Amusquivar et al., 2000; Korotkova et al., 2005). For example, a recent 
report demonstrated that a maternal diet rich in medium chain fatty acids can offer pro-
tection against the development of obesity in offspring when they are challenged with a 
fat rich diet (Dong et al., 2011). This literature at present does not present a clear mes-
sage as to which dietary fats are to be avoided or which may afford protection against 
offspring obesity, most likely due to the variety of dietary protocols and feeding regimes 
used and differing methods of assessment of offspring adiposity. Nonetheless, with im-
proved standardization of methods between laboratories, these studies could play an 
important role in understanding of the relative inﬂ uences of maternal dietary fatty acids 

9.3 Experimental models of maternal obesity    87
and fat mass per se on the risk of obesity in the offspring, and thereby  translate to dietary 
advice for obese pregnant women.
Whilst it is clear that obesity and/or diets rich in saturated fat increase the risk of obesity 
in the offspring, few laboratories have attempted dietary intervention studies in obese 
dams to investigate the potential for reversal of increased offspring adiposity, although 
these would be necessary to inform interventions in pregnant women. An interesting 
addition to the recent literature is the observation that antioxidant  supplementation in 
obese pregnant rats prevents the development of obesity in the offspring. Supplement-
ing rat dams’ fat rich ‘western diet’ with vitamins A, E and C led to reversal of adiposity 
in 2 week old and in 2 month old offspring (Sen and Simmons, 2010). Whilst vitamin 
A is contraindicated in human pregnancy, an intervention with antioxidant supplements 
could be feasible in pregnant women, although we have previously reported adverse 
pregnancy outcomes of high dose antioxidants (vitamins C and E) when administered to 
pregnant women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia, which included a large sub group 
of obese women (Poston et al., 2006).
9.3.1 Pathways contributing to development of offspring obesity
Recent developments provide important insight into the mechanisms which underlie 
the association between maternal obesity and offspring obesity in the various animal 
models. Some investigators, including ourselves, have suggested that adipocyte func-
tion may be permanently affected. We reported an increase in adipocyte size  and in-
creased mRNA expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation in offspring of 
obese mice (beta-adrenoceptor 2 and 3, 11 beta HSD-1, and PPAR-γ 2) (Samuelsson 
et al., 2008). In addition, Sen and Simmons observed that the antioxidant supplement 
regime led to reversal of altered offspring fat tissue expression of proadipogenic and 
lipogenic genes (PPARγ, Pref-1,Wisp 2, SREBP1, AcCoA, FAS, FAT) (Sen and Simmons, 
2010); the gene expression proﬁ le in the offspring prenatally exposed to maternal obe-
sity could infer that the exposure leads to continued expansion beyond neonatal life of 
the adipocyte pre-cursor pool which would contribute to the development of obesity. 
This proﬁ le may also indicate that obesity related oxidative stress may contribute to an 
increase in adipocyte differentiation  and fat tissue expansion.
Changes in adipocyte development and differentiation may play a permissive role 
in the generation of offspring obesity, but ultimately increase in fat mass must result 
from a change in energy balance in which expenditure is less than intake. Persistently 
altered mitochondrial function  acquired early in life could inﬂ uence energy balance 
(Symonds et al., 2009) and we have reported abnormalities in mitochondrial function 
in skeletal muscle  from offspring of obese dams which may have widespread implica-
tions for energy homeostasis (Shelley et al., 2009). Further investigations are required 
to interrogate the role of mitochondrial function in the different models, especially in 
adipocytes and from the different fat depots. This is a pertinent area of research which 
is relatively underexplored.
The most remarkable and consistent phenotypic feature of the animal models is the 
observation from our laboratory and others that the offspring of obese or fat fed dams 
are hyperphagic, with the suggestion that ‘programming’ of enhanced appetite  plays 
a major role in increasing fat tissue mass in the offspring (Chang et al., 2008; Nivoit 
et al., 2009; Samuelsson et al., 2008; Walker et al., 2008). Associations between obesity 

88    9 The outcome in offspring of obese mothers
in mothers and satiety in their children has never been formally studied in mother-child 
cohorts but there are validated methods by which satiety can be addressed and these 
animal studies have already inﬂ uenced ongoing studies, now addressing the effects of 
maternal obesity on childhood appetite.
Several plausible mechanisms for the increase in offspring appetite in the animal 
models have been proposed; ﬁ rstly the potential role of fetal hyperinsulinemia . Obesity 
in pregnant women is associated with increased risk of GDM and we have shown 
that diet induced obesity in pregnant rats is associated with maternal insulin resistance  
(Holemans et al., 2004), and associated maternal post prandial hyperglycemia would 
be expected to lead to fetal hyperinsulinemia. Plagemann and colleagues propose that 
fetal hyperinsulinemia leads to dysfunction of critical pathways of development in 
the neuronal hypothalamic networks  central to appetite regulation, thus permanently 
increasing food intake leading to adulthood obesity and insulin resistance (Plage-
mann, 2005; Plagemann et al., 1999a; Plagemann et al., 1999b; Plagemann et al., 
1998). Although not speciﬁ cally investigated in models of maternal diet induced obesity, 
fetal hyperinsulinemia could play an important role in development of the hyperphagia 
observed.
A second mechanism, the focus of recent investigations in our laboratory, is the 
potential role of hyperleptinemia and its inﬂ uence on hypothalamic development of 
appetite regulatory pathways. Rodents demonstrate a post natal leptin ‘surge’  which is 
unrelated to appetite regulation or growth and is considered to play a physiological role 
in development of the hypothalamic appetite regulatory pathways (Bouret, 2010). In rat 
pups from obese dams we measured the post natal leptin proﬁ le from birth to weaning 
and showed an exaggerated surge compared to controls. In weanling pups we also 
reported evidence for altered development of neural projections between the arcuate 
and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. This was associated with markers of 
central leptin resistance, as demonstrated by measurement of pSTAT3 expression in 
the arcuate nucleus  in response to exogenous leptin administration; pSTAT3 expres-
sion normally increases in response to leptin but this was blunted in the offspring of 
the obese dams compared to the controls. In addition, leptin administration  did not 
lead to the anticipated reduction in food intake observed in control animals. Thus the 
young offspring of obese dams demonstrated central leptin resistance  (Kirk et al., 2009), 
leading to the hypothesis that the exaggerated leptin surge promotes central leptin 
resistance which in turn prevents normal development of the hypothalamic appetite 
regulatory pathways, thereby leading to persistent hyperphagia  and increased adiposity. 
Others have similarly shown that offspring from dams fed a high fat diet have reduced 
sensitivity to the anorectic effects of leptin (Walker et al., 2008). The relationship of 
these observations to the human situation is unknown, although maternal visceral fat 
mass is the major determinant of plasma leptin in pregnant from the ﬁ rst trimester and 
obese pregnant women demonstrate hyperleptinemia (Fattah et al., 2011). In human 
pregnancy fetal hypothalamic development is almost complete by birth, therefore the 
period of hypothalamic vulnerability to leptin, should leptin similarly be a neurotrophic 
hormone in man, is more likely to be in the antenatal, rather than the postnatal period 
(Grayson et al., 2010a).
Obesity, as well as consumption of a high fat diet, is associated with a marked in-
ﬂ ammatory proﬁ le, and prenatal exposure to inﬂ ammatory mediators may inﬂ uence 
fetal brain development. Grayson et al have reported that fetuses of Japanese macaques  

9.3 Experimental models of maternal obesity    89
consuming a high fat diet demonstrate increased circulating and hypothalamic cy-
tokines, and have postulated that these contribute to the perturbations in the central 
melanocortin (proopiomelanocortin , POMC) and serotonin systems observed in the 
fetal brain which may affect energy homeostasis and cardiovascular function, as well 
as offspring behaviour (Grayson et al., 2010b; Sullivan et al., 2010). Notably, reversal 
of the maternal diet after four years of a high fat dietary intake was associated with 
normal fetal proopiomelanocortin mRNA expression. The inﬂ ammatory state of obesity 
is also associated with oxidative stress and it would be interesting to determine whether 
antioxidant supplementation in these non-human primate achieves reversal of offspring 
adiposity as reported in obese rat dams and their offspring (Sen and Simmons, 2010) 
(XFig. 9.1).
Should any or all of these proposed pathways be proven to contribute to the devel-
opment of obesity in offspring of obese/fat fed animals, then different approaches to 
intervention could be developed for obese pregnant women. In relation to hyperin-
sulinemia, strategies which improve insulin resistance should be considered; indeed 
several ongoing randomized controlled trials are relevant e.g. the UPBEAT trial in the 
UK, which aims to improve pregnancy outcome in obese women by recommending 
a low glycemic index diet and/or increased physical activity. Follow up of children 
from trial participants will be invaluable in establishing whether improved control of 
maternal glucose homeostasis may reduce childhood adiposity. Current strategies for 
reducing gestational weight gain to improve pregnancy outcome, which focus more on 
calorie restriction may however be more apposite should hyperleptinemia  and inﬂ am-
matory responses  be greater determinants of offspring adiposity. In addition, the fat 
composition of the diet may be all important. Whilst further corroborative studies are 
needed, especially in non-human primates, animal models have considerable potential 
to inform future interventions in pregnancy which may contribute to curtailment of 
childhood obesity.
9.3.2 Cardiovascular function in the offspring of obese animals
There are many examples of developmental programming of cardiovascular dysfunction 
by states of maternal undernutrition, recently reviewed (Ojeda et al., 2008) but few 
inflammatory

inferred from studies in experimental animals.

90    9 The outcome in offspring of obese mothers
investigators have addressed whether exposure to maternal obesity in animals is associ-
ated with cardiovascular dysfunction  in the offspring. The hypothalamus plays a critical 
role in blood pressure  control through the melanocortin system, and in circadian varia-
tion of blood pressure via the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Since developmental plasticity 
of the hypothalamus appears to be central in determining abnormal energy balance in 
the offspring of obese dams, investigation of cardiovascular function is also of obvious 
interest. Furthermore, several studies have reported an association between maternal 
BMI or gestational weight gain in human pregnancy and offspring blood pressure (Law-
lor et al., 2004; Mamun et al., 2009; Oken, 2009; West et al., 2010). However, because 
of the established relationship between obesity and blood pressure, it is important to 
determine whether the development of childhood obesity underpins this relationship or 
whether there is an independent risk of hypertension in the child of an obese mother; 
indeed in a recent study of 99 diabetic women and their children an association be-
tween maternal BMI and offspring systolic blood pressure, which was independent of 
maternal diabetes status, was attenuated towards null after adjustment for child attained 
BMI. However correction for offspring BMI did not impact upon an association between 
maternal BMI and offspring E-selectin, a cardiovascular risk marker (West et al., 2010).
Animal studies offer the opportunity to delineate ‘cause and effect relationships’. We 
have shown that adult offspring of diet-induced obese mice and rats develop hyperten-
sion (Samuelsson et al., 2008; Samuelsson et al., 2010) using protocols in which blood 
pressure  was measured by the method of remote telemetry, enabling continuous mea-
surement of blood pressure in conscious unrestrained animals. By assessment in young 
male and female rat offspring (30 days) with prior exposure to maternal obesity we 
were able to demonstrate elevation of blood pressure before development of increased 
fat mass. The blood pressure was also higher than controls at 90 days of age, and by 
180 days the increase in blood pressure in male offspring was associated with loss of 
diurnal variation. The 30 day and 90 day old offspring dams also showed an enhanced 
response to restraint stress, and supranormal renal noradrenaline content and renin 
mRNA expression. Spectral analysis of the blood pressure tracings revealed increased 
low frequency oscillations in 30 and 90 day old offspring compared to controls, and 
at 90 days investigation of blood pressure responses to noradrenaline and sodium ni-
troprusside identiﬁ ed reduced baroreﬂ ex sensitivity. Taken together, these observations 
strongly suggested the hypertension is of sympathetic origin. We also investigated the 
blood pressure response to exogenous leptin. Leptin increases blood pressure through 
an increase in hypothalamic and nucleus tractus solitarius efferent sympathetic tone via 
the renal nerve (Mark et al., 2009). The offspring of the obese dams demonstrated an 
enhanced pressor response to leptin injection. Although in apparently contrast to the 
leptin resistance observed in relation to food intake, it is recognized that cardiovascular 
and appetite regulatory actions of leptin are attributed to different regions of the hypo-
thalamus. Indeed, the young lean offspring presented a very similar phenotype of ‘selec-
tive leptin resistance’ to that observed in adult obese rodents (Rahmouni et al., 2005). 
Future research will focus on deﬁ ning the central mechanisms responsible, particularly 
the role of the POMC system and the melanocortin receptor types 3 and 4 (MC3/4R) 
since these are implicated in leptin induced elevation of blood pressure (Tallam et al., 
2006). Importantly, these observations have provided a rationale for investigation of 
blood pressure and blood pressure variability in the children of obese mothers in on-
going mother-child cohort studies. Indeed, there is already some limited evidence to 

References    91
suggest that children of obese mothers may be prone to hypertension through altered 
autonomic control including a report of an association between maternal BMI and fetal 
cardiac sympathovagal activation (Ojala et al., 2009).
9.4 Summary
In summary, the evidence for an independent association between maternal obesity 
and offspring obesity is strong, although causality remains to be proven. Animal studies 
have shown unequivocal support for the transgenerational inﬂ uence of maternal obesity 
on the developing offspring and, importantly have provided mechanistic insight at a 
depth practically not possible in human studies. These have already informed ongoing 
mother-child cohort studies and, inevitably, will play an important role in development 
of intervention studies  in obese women with the aim of preventing childhood obesity.

10  Short and long term effects of gestational obesity : 
Clinical observations
Patrick M. Catalano
There has been a signiﬁ cant increase of obesity in women of reproductive age in the past 
decades. Hence, compared to normal weight women there exists alterations in maternal me-
tabolism prior to conception. Since obese women are more insulin resistant, when coupled 
with the increased insulin resistance of pregnancy, there is the additive effect making in-
creased nutrients availability to the developing fetus.
The infant of the obese women weighs more at delivery because of increased fat and not 
lean body mass. In addition to adiposity, these neonates have increased insulin resistance. 
Increased insulin resistance in the neonate correlates with maternal insulin resistance and 
body fat. There has been a signiﬁ cant increase in children and adolescent obesity in the past 
decade. Multiple perinatal factors have been related to childhood obesity including maternal 
pre-pregnancy obesity, gestational weight gain and glucose intolerance, such as gestational 
diabetes. In our 8 year follow up of women with both normal glucose tolerance and gesta-
tional diabetes, maternal pregravid BMI was the strongest predictor of childhood obesity, 
independent of maternal glucose status or weight gain during pregnancy.
In summary our research group has been focusing on maternal factors facilitating fetal fat 
accretion. We hypothesize maternal obesity because of the increased insulin resistance, pos-
sibly mediated through inﬂ ammation, create a signiﬁ cant risk for the next generation because 
the process of obesity for the offspring is initiated in utero. Therefore if the treatment of obesity 
begins with prevention, then the perinatal period of development is an important focus for 
additional research.
10.1 Maternal metabolism in normal pregnancy
The metabolic alterations in normal human pregnancy can be considered as having two 
distinct phases. Early gestation can be considered as the time through about 28 weeks 
of gestation. Metabolically, early pregnancy is characterized as an anabolic state, mani-
fested by a decrease in insulin sensitivity, increase in energy expenditure, accretion of 
maternal adipose tissue and placental growth and hormone production. Late gestation 
can be considered catabolic because of the further decreases in insulin sensitivity re-
sulting in increased lipid mobilization for maternal energy needs and increased nutrient 
availability for fetal-placental energy needs and growth. However, because of the recent 
increases in overweight  and obesity in women of reproductive age over the past few 
decades, these shifts in the population weight distribution have resulted in alterations in 
maternal metabolism during pregnancy and increased fetal growth.

10.2 Fetal growth  and body composition
There has been a signiﬁ cant increase in obesity in the last 40 years not only in developed 
areas of the world but also in developing countries (World Health Organization, 2000). 
In the United States approximately 55% of the population is either overweight or obese 
and 30% are obese based on WHO BMI criteria (Ogden et al., 2006). Furthermore, 7% 
of women of reproductive age population have a BMI >40, or Class III obesity (Ogden 
et al., 2006). In Asian populations, because of differences in body composition, the 
criteria for risk of metabolic dysfunction such as diabetes  and  cardiovascular disease are 
different than in a Caucasian population. A BMI of 23–27.5 is designated as increased 
risk and a BMI greater than 27.5 as high risk for metabolic dysfunction (World Health 
Organization, 1999). Approximately 11% of US children are obese based on the Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), i.e. weight for height greater than 2 standard 
deviations for age and gender (Ogden et al., 2008). Last, there has been reported a 
signiﬁ cant increase in the mean term birth weight  in various European populations 
(Orskou et al., 2001; Surkan et al., 2004).
Anath has reported that between 1985 and 1998 in the United States there has been 
an 11 to 12% decrease in small for gestational age (birth weight less than the 10th per-
centile for gestational age) neonates, whereas there has been a 5–9% increase in large 
for gestational age  neonates (birth weight greater than the 90th percentile for gestational 
age), in the white and black populations, respectively (Anath and Wen, 2002). In our 
own population in Cleveland Ohio, there has been a signiﬁ cant mean 116g increase 
in term birth weights from 1975 through 2005. The increases in birth weight reﬂ ect 
increases through the entire range of birth weights, i.e. there has been an increase from 
the 5th to 95th percentiles. These increases in birth weight remain after adjustment for 
gender, ethnicity and gestational age (Catalano, 2007).
In our research, we have elected to assess fetal growth using estimates of body com-
position . The rational for this is that at birth, we as humans have the greatest percent 
of body fat as compared with most other mammalian species. At birth the term human 
has approximately 12–16 percent body fat , depending on the methodology used. In 
contrast most murine models have 1–2% body fat (Widdowson, 1950). The increases in 
murine body fat occur during weaning. Non human primates at birth have in the order 
of 3–5 percent body fat (Ausman et al., 1982; Russo et al., 1980). Last guinea pigs have 
8–10 percent body fat at birth. Of interest, humans share with guinea pigs a hemocho-
rial type of placenta.
Based on animal husbandry studies and human autopsy data, lean body mass or fat 
free mass has a strong relationship with genetic factors for e.g. males weigh more at birth 
compared to females because of the increase in lean and not fat mass (Moulton, 1923; 
Sparks, 1984). In contrast fat mass at birth is strongly related to maternal  environmental 
factors such as pre pregnancy obesity, weight gain and diabetes.
At birth infants of women with gestational diabetes  (GDM) weigh more than women 
with normal glucose tolerance because of increased fat mass but not lean body mass 
(XTab. 10.1). This relationship holds when the data are adjusted for confounding 
 variables such as gestational age and ethnicity.
Furthermore even when only considering those newborns whose weight for gesta-
tional age are appropriate for gestational age (AGA), the neonates of women with GDM 
have increased percent body fat as compared with the AGA neonates of women with

normal glucose tolerance. Similarly, it has long been recognized that maternal pregravid 
obesity is a risk factor for fetal overgrowth or macrosomia . In a study by Sewell et al. 
they reported that in contrast to infants of women with a pregravid body mass index  
(BMI, kg/m²) BMI less than 25, overweight and obese women with a pregravid BMI 
greater than 25 had infants at birth whose weight were greater because of a signiﬁ cant 
increase in fat mass and not lean body mass (Sewell et al., 2006) (XTab. 10.2).
Furthermore, women with a BMI greater than 25 gained signiﬁ cantly less weight as 
compared to the lean or average weight women (BMI less than 25). Using a stepwise re-
gression analysis maternal pregravid BMI was the strongest correlate and accounted for 
approximately 7% of the variance in neonatal body fat and percent body fat. Maternal 
well controlled GDM accounted less than 2% of the variance in fat mass and percent 
body fat (XTab. 10.3).
Maternal weight gain  is a potentially modiﬁ able variable in relationship to fetal 
growth. While increased weight gain in average weight women is associated with an 
increase in both lean and adipose tissue, in obese women excessive weight gain is 
associated primarily with an increase in adipose and not lean tissue. Therefore achieve-
ment of both normal pregravid weight and appropriate weight gain in pregnancy, (based 
on Institute of Medicine 2009 recommendations (Rasmussen and Yaktine, 2009)) are the 
optimal means to achieve appropriate fetal growth and prevent adiposity.
At birth the infants of obese women have an altered metabolic proﬁ le as compared 
with the infants of lean mothers (XTab. 10.4). At birth not only do these infants have 
signiﬁ cantly increased adiposity, but also higher umbilical cord leptin  concentrations 
reﬂ ecting this increased adipokine  production by the adipose tissue. Although there was 
no increase in cord blood TNF-alpha  or C reactive protein, the neonates of the obese

mothers had increased IL-6  concentrations, indicating the possibility of an early inﬂ am-
matory milieu. Last the cord blood insulin  concentrations were signiﬁ cantly greater and 
there was a trend towards an increase in cord blood glucose.
In neonates estimates of insulin resistance as estimated by clamp studies are very low 
and reﬂ ect primarily increased peripheral rather than hepatic insulin sensitivity (Far-
rag et al., 1997). Our group recently reported that at birth, neonates of obese women 
were signiﬁ cantly more insulin resistant (using HOMA estimates of insulin resistance ) 
as compared with infants of lean women (XFig. 10.1).

10.3 The child of the obese woman    101
These data are consistent with a recent report by Dyer et al, who using a minimal 
model technique, described increased insulin resistance in LGA term neonates com-
pared with poorly grown neonates between 24 and 48 hours after birth (Dyer et al., 
2007). There is a signiﬁ cant correlation between neonatal insulin resistance and neo-
natal percent body fat (XFig. 10.2). Last, maternal insulin resistance also had a strong 
correlation with fetal insulin resistance even when adjusted for various confounders 
such as fetal adiposity (Catalano et al., 2009a). These data suggest the possibility of 
genetic or epigenetic factors relating to neonatal insulin resistance.
10.3 The child of the obese woman
One of the goals of our research has to assess the perinatal factors related to the de-
velopment of obesity and metabolic dysfunction in later life. Maternal glucose intoler-
ance during pregnancy, gestational weight gain, maternal pregravid weight and fetal 
overgrowth have all have been implicated in childhood obesity  (Boney et al. 2005; 
Dabelea et al., 2000; Oken et al., 2007). Our group has recently published the results

102    10 Short and long term effects of gestational obesity: Clinical observations
of a prospective longitudinal cohort evaluating the perinatal risk factors of childhood 
obesity. In this study we evaluated children of women with GDM  and normal glucose 
tolerance (NGT) at birth and at approximately 8 years of age (Catalano et al. 2009b). At 
the time of follow up, the children were rank ordered into tertiles based on CDC criteria 
for overweight and obesity (Kuczmarski et al., 2002). A subset of the children had body 
composition estimated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and basal labora-
tory studies. Children in the upper tertile for height and weight had signiﬁ cantly greater 
energy intake , skinfold thickness and leptin  concentrations than those in the ﬁ rst two 
tertiles. Children in the upper tertile for percent body fat  had signiﬁ cantly greater waist 
circumference, insulin resistance, triglyceride concentrations and leptin concentrations 
as compared with children in tertiles 1 and 2. There was a signiﬁ cant correlation be-
tween percent body fat at birth and body fat at follow up (XFig. 10.3) but not between 
birth weight and weight of the child at follow-up. The strongest predictor for a child 
being in the upper tertile for CDC weight percentile was maternal pregravid BMI greater 
than 30. The odds ratio was 3.75 (95% CI of 1.39, 10.10). The risk for a child being 
in the upper tertile for percent body fat was maternal pregravid BMI greater than 30, 
with an odds ratio of 5.45 (95% CI of 1.62, 18.41). We concluded that although well 
controlled GDM during pregnancy is an important factor related to childhood obesity, 
that maternal pregravid obesity, independent of maternal glucose status or birth weight 
was the strongest  predictor of childhood obesity in our study population.
10.4 Maternal factors facilitating fetal fat accretion
There are multiple factors related to the metabolism in obese women associated with 
fetal fat accretion. The longitudinal changes in insulin sensitivity during pregnancy 
in normal weight (BMI less than 25), overweight (BMI 25–29.9) and obese women 
(BMI greater than 30) are shown in XFig. 10.4. There are signiﬁ cant ( p = 0.0004) 
decreases in insulin sensitivity with advancing gestation in all women, regardless of 
pregravid BMI.

However, obese women have signiﬁ cant decreased insulin sensitivity  prior to con-
ception as compared to normal and overweight women. Therefore, although there is a 
similar percent decrease in insulin sensitivity with advancing gestation, obese women 
have less of an actual net decrease in insulin sensitivity. Based on Pima Indian studies 
over a number of years, the decrease in net insulin sensitivity is inversely correlated 
with weight gain (Swinburn et al., 1991). This relationship between change in insulin 
sensitivity and weight gain are consistent with the epidemiological studies reporting 
decreased gestational weight gain in obese as compared with non-obese women during 
pregnancy (Chu et al., 2009).
The alterations in insulin sensitivity are not only relating to glucose metabolism 
but also other nutrients such as protein and lipids. XFig. 10.5 shows the longitudinal

changes in maternal fasting triglyceride  concentrations in the same population. Again, 
although there is a signiﬁ cant increase basal triglyceride concentrations with advanc-
ing gestation, obese women have increased triglycerides before pregnancy, which are 
greatly increased by late gestation. This is because of a decreased ability of insulin to 
suppress lipolysis in late gestation. These metabolic alterations in obese women, both 
in early and late gestation result in an abnormal metabolic milieu for the develop-
ing placenta and fetus. These metabolic changes not only result in increased nutri-
ent availability for the fetal growth/overgrowth but may alter fetal gene expression, 
which may become manifest as metabolic dysregulation in the future, i.e. perinatal 
programming.
The decrease in insulin sensitivity  in pregnancy has been ascribed to various placental 
hormones. Because once the placenta has delivered there is a signiﬁ cant improvement 
in insulin sensitivity. Previously, the decrease in insulin sensitivity during pregnancy 
has been ascribed to placental hormones such as human placental lactogen and pro-
gesterone. However, more recent data points to cytokines and inﬂ ammation as putative 
factors. For example, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha ) has a strong correlation 
with the changes in insulin sensitivity, as estimated by the euglycemic clamp, during 
pregnancy (Kirwan et al., 2002). Additionally, the post receptor defects in the insulin 
signaling cascade are consistent with the mechanism of cytokines relating to insulin 
resistance (Friedman et al., 2008).
Because of the macrophage inﬁ ltration of white adipose tissue (WAT), obesity is 
considered as an inﬂ ammatory condition. The increase in cytokines  is one of the links 
between obesity and insulin resistance and constitutes a component of the metabolic 
syndrome. Furthermore pregnancy in and of itself is also considered an inﬂ ammatory 
state (XTab. 10.5). Therefore, maternal obesity in addition to the signiﬁ cant decreases in 
insulin sensitivity in late pregnancy results in a marked inﬂ ammatory state. Since to the 
best of our knowledge maternal cytokines do not cross the placenta (Aaltonen, 2005), 
any inﬂ ammation  in the fetus is not a function of maternal inﬂ ammation but possibly 
endogenous to the fetus.

10.5 Summary
On the basis of the available evidence, our working hypothesis is that maternal obesity 
because of the increased insulin resistance, possibly mediated through inﬂ ammation, 
creates a signiﬁ cant risk for the next generation. At birth the fetus of the obese women 
has metabolic compromise already apparent because of increased adiposity. In child-
hood the strongest correlate with obesity and metabolic dysregulation is maternal pre-
gravid obesity and not maternal weight gain, birth weight or well controlled GDM. If 
prevention is the goal to prevent further increases in obesity in the population, then the 
perinatal period of development is an important focus for additional research (Catalano, 
2003).

11  Emerging role of neuroendocrine 
programming in obesity
Sophie M. Steculorum and Sebastien G. Bouret
The incidence of obesity and diabetes in children and adults continues to rise at an alarming 
rate worldwide. Epidemiological and animal studies suggest that maternal, fetal, and postna-
tal health and nutrition, including obesity, diabetes, and malnutrition, may contribute to the 
development of these diseases. The precise biological mechanisms underlying this metabolic 
programming are still poorly understood. Nevertheless, there is compelling evidence that 
obesity and other related diseases may be a consequence of alterations in the developmental 
processes of neuroendocrine systems involved in energy balance regulation. Experimental 
data indicate that changes in nutrition during critical periods of development may affect the 
architecture and molecular signature of hypothalamic pathways involved in body weight and 
energy balance regulation. In addition, metabolic hormones, including leptin and insulin, 
are important mediators of the nutritional status and appear to exert profound organizational 
effects on hypothalamic appetite-related pathways.
11.1 Introduction
During the past three decades, the prevalences of obesity  and type 2 diabetes  have 
increased at alarming rates in the vast majority of developed countries (Ebbeling, Paw-
lak, and Ludwig, 2002; Wang et al., 2008). A number of obesity cases often manifest 
during childhood and early adulthood. Of particular concern is the ﬁ nding that obese 
children and adolescents are more likely to become obese adults (Serdula et al., 1993; 
Whitaker et al., 1997). For example, epidemiological data indicate that approximately 
80% of children who were overweight at ages of 10–15 years remained obese at age 25 
(Whitaker et al., 1997). Despite an obvious relationship between obesity and a Western 
lifestyle, including a sedentary lifestyle and the overconsumption of energy-rich but 
nutrient-poor food, it is also clear that different individuals exposed to the same obe-
sogenic environments display different responses in terms of obesity predispositions. 
There appears to be a genetic basis for a subpopulation of obese patients, but genetics 
alone cannot explain why obesity has increased so rapidly in recent decades. Recent 
epidemiological and animal studies have revealed that changes in the hormonal and 
nutritional environments during critical periods of development may increase the sus-
ceptibility for the development of obesity and diabetes in later life (Godfrey, Gluckman, 
and Hanson, 2010; Levin, 2006; McMillen and Robinson, 2005; Plagemann, 2006). 
Perinatal factors that contribute to lifelong obesity include both maternal and neonatal 
diabetes, obesity, and malnutrition (for review see Levin, 2006; McMillen and  Robinson, 
2005; Plagemann, 2006; Sullivan and Grove, 2010). The observation that both a surfeit 

108    11 Emerging role of neuroendocrine programming in obesity 
and a paucity of energy supply during perinatal development are associated with similar 
metabolic outcomes suggests that the processes underlying programmed obesity may 
share common biological mechanisms.
The regulation of energy balance and glucose homeostasis is governed by a variety 
of organs and tissues. Among these tissues, a primary importance has been given to the 
hypothalamus, which contains sets of neurons that are devoted to metabolic regulation. 
Empirical experiments using physical lesions of speciﬁ c hypothalamic structures and, 
more recently, studies using transgenic approaches have revealed the importance of 
neurons within the  arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (ARC), the ventromedial hypothalamic 
nucleus (VMN) , the dorsomedial nucleus  (DMH), the paraventricular nucleus  (PVH), 
and the lateral hypothalamic area  (LHA) in the regulation of body weight and glucose 
levels (for review see Berthoud, 2006; Elmquist et al., 2005; Saper, Chou, and Elmquist, 
2002; Sawchenko, 1998). The ARC appears to be a predominant site of integration of 
peripheral blood-born signals, including endocrine and metabolic factors. Neurons 
located in the ARC, such as the neurons coproducing neuropeptide Y (NPY)  and agouti-
related peptide (AgRP) , or neurons containing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) -derived

simpliﬁ ed schematics illustrating the possible routes and neuronal populations relaying hormonal 
and nutrient signals from the periphery to the brain. Circulating hormones that reﬂ ect peripheral 
energy status, such as insulin, leptin, and ghrelin, act directly within a complex neuronal network 
in the hypothalamus to regulate energy balance and glucose homeostasis. The arcuate nucleus of 
the hypothalamus (ARC) contains a collection of heterogeneous neuronal populations, in particular 
neurons coexpressing neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) and another distinct 
neuronal population containing proopiomelanocortin (POMC). These neurons send extensive 
projections to other parts of the hypothalamus, including the paraventricular (PVH) and dorsomedial 
(DMH) nuclei of the hypothalamus, and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). These neuronal 
projections represent important routes for the actions of leptin, insulin, and ghrelin at the hypothalamic 
level. This ﬁ gure was created in part using illustrations from “Servier Medical Art” with permission.

peptides, directly respond to peripheral hormonal signals, such as the adipocyte-derived 
hormone leptin, the pancreas-derived hormone insulin, and the gut-derived hormone 
ghrelin (XFig. 11.1) (Elmquist et al., 2005; Myers Jr et al., 2009; Sawchenko, 1998).
In particular, leptin  and insulin , which are anorexigenic hormones, activate POMC 
neurons and inhibit NPY neurons to reduce food intake and increase energy expendi-
ture. In contrast, orexigenic hormones such as ghrelin stimulate NPY neurons and inhibit 
POMC neurons. Both NPY/AgRP- and POMC-containing neurons project extensively 
to other key hypothalamic nuclei, including the PVH, DMH, and LHA (XFig. 11.1). 
These target nuclei contain subpopulations of neurons that also play a crucial role in 
energy balance regulation and include neurons that produce anorexigenic peptides, 
such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) 
and oxytocin in the PVH, and neurons that express orexigenic neuropeptides, such as 
orexins and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) in the LHA. Based on the critical 
role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of metabolism, it is clear that impairments of 
hypothalamic development during perinatal life may result in severe metabolic regula-
tion. This chapter summarizes the developmental changes that have been observed in 
the hypothalamus in response to changes in the early nutritional and hormonal environ-
ment. It also discusses how the resetting of a diverse array of neuroendocrine systems 
may have long-term effects on the regulation of metabolism and energy balance.
11.2  Development of hypothalamic neuroendocrine 
pathways controlling appetite
The formation of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus is characterized by various devel-
opmental processes that fall into three major categories: (1) the birth of new neurons 
(i.e., neurogenesis ), (2) the migration  of these cells to their ﬁ nal destination, and (3) the 
formation of functional circuits that include axon growth and synaptogenesis (for review 
see Bouret, 2010a; Markakis, 2002). XFig. 11.2 provides a broad overview of the major 
developmental stages of hypothalamic nuclei and areas involved in appetite regulation .
Neurons that form hypothalamic nuclei originate from the proliferative zone of the 
third ventricle (Markakis, 2002). Classic experimental tools for the study of neurogen-
esis have included the administration of the thymidine analog, BrdU, during critical 
windows of development and have revealed that the majority of neurons that com-
pose the hypothalamus are born between embryonic day (E) 12 and E14 in mice and 
between E12 and E17 in rats (XFig. 11.2) (Altman and Bayer, 1986; Ishii, Gibbons, 
and Bouret, 2009; Padilla, Carmody, and Zeltser, 2010). Part of the complex process of 
hypothalamic development also includes the proper migration of neurons from their 
sites of origin (i.e., the proliferative zone of the third ventricle) to their ﬁ nal positions 
in the mature hypothalamus. This developmental process occurs primarily during late 
gestation in rodents (McClellana, Parker, and Tobet, 2006). In both rats and mice, the hy-
pothalamus is still relatively immature at birth and continues to develop during the ﬁ rst 
2 weeks of postnatal life when neurons send axonal projections to their target sites and 
form functional synapses. Axonal labeling experiments indicate that ARC axons reach 
each of their nuclei during the ﬁ rst 2 weeks of postnatal life (XFig. 11.2) (Bouret et al., 
2004a; Grove et al., 2003; Nilsson et al., 2005). The formation of synapses, which are 
the neurobiological substrates of almost all cell-to-cell communication, follows. In the 

110    11 Emerging role of neuroendocrine programming in obesity 
rodent hypothalamus, synapses mature gradually from birth to adulthood (Matsumoto 
and Arai, 1976; Melnick et al., 2007). The considerable importance of postnatal hypo-
thalamic development in rodents differs from humans and nonhuman primates  (NHPs) 
in which the hypothalamus develops almost entirely during fetal life. Immunohisto-
chemical studies performed in Japanese macaques  have shown that arcuate projections 
containing NPY  and POMC  peptides are fully mature at birth and that the development 
of these projections is initiated as early as the late second trimester of gestation (Grayson 
et al., 2006). These results suggest that different species may display different periods of 
vulnerability to environmental insults based on the temporal and regional maturation 
patterns of the hypothalamus.

hypothalamus occurs in three major phases: (1) the birth of new neurons (neurogenesis), (2) the 
migration of these neurons to their ﬁ nal location, and (3) the formation of functional circuits that 
include neurite extension and the formation of functional synapses. Each of these developmental 
events appears sensitive to a variety of environmental insults that include maternal and neonatal 
obesity, diabetes, malnutrition, and genetic predispositions to obesity. This ﬁ gure was created in

11.3 Animal models of metabolic programming    111
mechanisms by which changes in the perinatal nutritional and hormonal environments 
predispose individuals to obesity (XTab. 11.1).
11.3.1 Perinatal obesity
Maternal high-fat diet  (HFD) feeding during pregnancy is probably the most widely 
used approach for studying the consequences of maternal obesity in both rodents and 
in NHPs. Offspring born to obese females fed an HFD (45% to 60% of calories from fat) 
during gestation only or during both gestation and lactation become progressively over-
weight, hyperphagic, and glucose intolerant and display an increase in adiposity (Chen, 
Simar, and Morris, 2009; Kirk et al., 2009). Remarkably, a short exposure to an HFD 
during pregnancy without development of metabolic syndrome also predisposes the off-
spring to obesity , which includes an increase in body weight, fat mass, and food intake 
(Chang et al., 2008). These data suggest that maternal obesity per se is not required for 
metabolic programming, but transient and short exposures to nutritional and hormonal 
challenges during gestation are sufﬁ cient to induce long-term metabolic alterations in 
the offspring. Because of the importance of postnatal organ development, including 
the brain, in rodents, animal models of postnatal metabolic programming have been 
developed to speciﬁ cally target this developmental period. An approach that has proven 
extremely fruitful for the study of postnatal overfeeding is a reduction of litter size. Pups 
raised in small litters (SL)  display accelerated growth during the preweaning period. 
Accordingly, pups raised in small litters exhibit heavier body weight as early as the 
second week of postnatal life, and these animals remain heavier throughout life (Bouret 
et al., 2007; Davidowa and Plagemann, 2000; Glavas et al., 2010). In addition, postna-
tally overfed animals show accelerated and exacerbated weight gain when fed an HFD 
(Glavas et al., 2010). The model of diet-induced obesity (DIO)  developed by Barry Levin 
(Levin et al., 1997) is particularly well-suited for the study of the underlying biological 
processes that contribute to the development of obesity in humans because Levin’s 
DIO rats share several features with human obesity, including polygenic inheritance. 
This animal model is also useful for the study of the relative contribution of genetic 
versus environmental factors in metabolic programming. In this model, the offspring of 
mothers genetically predisposed to DIO are obese, hyperphagic, and glucose intolerant 
when fed a high-energy diet compared to offspring born to diet resistant mothers (Levin 
et al., 2003; Ricci and Levin, 2003).
11.3.2 M aternal diabetes
Almost all animal models of maternal obesity are associated with hyperglycemia and 
insulin resistance. Accordingly, it is often difﬁ cult to determine whether the metabolic 
abnormalities of pups born to obese dams are caused by changes in the dams’ diet or 
whether they are a consequence of maternal diabetes. The manipulation of glucose 
levels without an alteration of the diet can be performed experimentally by injecting 
streptozotocin (STZ) , a pancreatic beta-cell toxin. Using this approach, rodent studies 
indicate that dams (either rats or mice) treated with STZ during early gestation are hypo-
insulinemic and hyperglycemic and give birth to pups that are overweight, hyperphagic, 
and hyperglycemic (Plagemann et al., 1998; Steculorum and Bouret, 2009).

114    11 Emerging role of neuroendocrine programming in obesity 
11.3.3 Perinatal malnutrition
Well-validated rodent models of intrauterine growth retardation  include animals born 
to dams that were either caloric-restricted (food-restricted, FR) or fed a low protein diet  
(protein-restricted, PR) during pregnancy and lactation. The offspring born of and raised 
by FR or PR mothers have a low birth weight  and slow growth during the preweaning 
period. In contrast, pups born to FR or PR dams but raised by lactating mothers fed ad 
libitum display a rapid catch-up growth  during the ﬁ rst postnatal week (Coupe et al., 
2009; Cripps et al., 2009; Yura et al., 2005). Although adult animals born to malnour-
ished mothers display normal body weight, they are hyperphagic and glucose intoler-
ant and display an increased sensitivity to diet-induced obesity (Coupe et al., 2009; 
Vickers et al., 2000; Yura et al., 2005). The rodent models of divergent litter size can 
also be used to speciﬁ cally study the role of postnatal undernutrition on metabolic and 
developmental outcomes. For example, raising pups in large litters (LL)  decreases milk 
availability and attenuates preweaning growth. Interestingly, pups raised in LLs display 
rapid weaning-to-adult weight gain that is associated with an increase in adiposity and 
glucose intolerance (Bouret et al., 2007).
11.4  Assessment of neuroendocrine regulation in metabolically 
malprogrammed animals
Resistance to the regulatory action of metabolic hormones is a hallmark of obesity in 
adult individuals. For example, most forms of obesity are associated with a diminished 
response of the hypothalamus to the appetite-suppressing effects of leptin (Enriori et al., 
2006; Myers, Cowley, and Munzberg, 2008) (XTab. 11.2).
Interestingly, animals perinatally predisposed to obesity also exhibit leptin resistance . 
Therefore, adult offspring born to obese (HFD and DIO) and undernourished dams 
display a blunted response to the anorectic effects of leptin (Kirk et al., 2009; Levin 
and Dunn-Meynell, 2002; Yura et al., 2005) (XTab. 11.3). Moreover, this diminished re-
sponse to leptin is associated with a reduced ability of leptin to induce pSTAT3, a marker 
of LepRb activation, in arcuate neurons, which demonstrates that this is a centrally 
mediated phenomenon (Bouret et al., 2008; Kirk et al., 2009, Yura et al., 2005). Insulin 
sensitivity  also appears to be affected in rats selectively bred to develop DIO (Clegg 
et al., 2005). Remarkably, DIO rats are leptin- and insulin-resistant before they become 
obese (Bouret et al., 2008; Clegg et al., 2005), which suggests that this hormonal resis-
tance may initiate the development and maintenance of obesity. Leptin and insulin re-
sistance have also been described in arcuate neurons of adult rats subjected to chronic 
postnatal overnutrition (Davidowa and Plagemann, 2000, 2007). Electrophysiological 
studies indicate that the arcuate neurons of rats raised in small litters  are less inhibited 
by leptin and insulin, and some of these neurons are actually partially activated by these 
hormones (Davidowa and Plagemann, 2000, 2007). A likely mechanism underlying 
the hormonal resistance is an alteration in receptor expression and/or signaling. For 
example, a downregulation of hypothalamic leptin receptor  mRNA has been described 
in several animal models of nutritional programming, including SL, DIO, and maternal 
malnutrition, and an altered leptin binding has been reported in the hypothalamus of 
DIO rats (Chen et al., 2009; Cripps et al., 2009; Irani, Dunn-Meynell, and Levin, 2007; 
Levin et al., 2003, 2004).

11.5 Structural inﬂ uences of perinatal nutrition    119
Other regulatory processes are also perturbed in animals born in an obesogenic en-
vironment, such as an imbalance in the hypothalamic expression of appetite regulators 
(XTab. 11.3). In most cases, programmed overweight is associated with an elevated 
ratio of orexigenic to anorexigenic neuropeptide expression in the hypothalamus. For 
example, both maternal obesity  and undernutrition as well as postnatal overnutrition 
and undernutrition cause an overall increase in the expression of orexigenic neuropep-
tides, such as NPY  and AgRP , and a decrease in the expression of anorexigenic neuro-
peptides, such as POMC  and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript peptide 
(CART) (Chen et al., 2009; Coupe et al., 2009; Cripps et al., 2009; López et al., 2005; 
Remmers et al., 2008; Srinivasan et al., 2008). It has been postulated that the elevated 
ratio of orexigenic to anorexigenic neuropeptides may explain the increased drive to eat 
in perinatally malprogrammed animals. However, the application and generalization 
of the results of mRNA studies warrant a good degree of caution until the relationships 
between mRNA and protein levels are well characterized. In other words, gene expres-
sion approaches may be useful for mechanistic studies, but unless they are used in 
conjunction with an examination of protein levels and localization, these studies may 
not always prove useful for the prediction of an adverse effect. Nevertheless, it appears 
that the observed changes in neuropeptide gene expression reﬂ ect an acquired mecha-
nism that originates from a malprogramming of hypothalamic neuropeptidergic systems 
during early life rather than being a consequence of metabolic dysfunctions, such as 
overweight and hyperphagia. Consistent with this idea, changes in neuropeptide gene 
expression are often observed as early as embryonic life and/or during the ﬁ rst postnatal 
weeks, that is, prior to the development of overweight and hyperphagia (Chen et al., 
2009; Cripps et al., 2009; Gupta et al., 2009; Morris and Chen, 2009; Remmers et al., 
2010; Srinivasan et al., 2008; Terroni et al., 2005). In addition to its adverse effects 
on the expression of appetite-regulating genes, postnatal overfeeding affects neuronal 
response to neuropeptides. For example, PVH neurons of chronically overfed pups 
display reduced electrophysiological responses to arcuate neuropeptides, such as NPY, 
AgRP, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), and CART (Davidowa, Li, 
and Plagemann, 2003).
11.5  Structural inﬂ uences of perinatal nutrition on hypothalamic 
appetite-related networks
As described previously, the developing hypothalamus is exposed to two distinct 
environments: one in utero and the other extra utero. These developmental periods 
represent important windows of sensitivity during which alterations of the nutritional 
and metabolic environments may lead to structural abnormalities in the hypothalamus, 
such as changes in cell numbers and/or neuronal connectivity.
11.5.1 Determination of neuronal cell numbers
The capacity of diet to alter proliferation in the neuroepithelium has been demonstrated 
recently in rodents. In the case of maternal high-fat feeding, hypothalamic cell prolifera-
tion is increased in rats and results in higher numbers of neurons containing orexigenic 
neuropeptides (i.e., galanin, enkephalin, dynorphin, MCH, and orexin) in the PVH and 

120    11 Emerging role of neuroendocrine programming in obesity 
LHA (Chang et al., 2008). In general, rodent studies indicate that the adverse effects of a 
maternal obesogenic environment are similar on hypothalamic cell numbers  when they 
occur either during gestation or during gestation and lactation. For example, offspring 
of HFD mothers cross-fostered with control mothers during lactation exhibit similar 
changes in orexigenic cell numbers and metabolic outcomes compared with pups 
raised by HFD mothers during pregnancy and lactation (Chang et al., 2008). Increased 
nutrition and growth, speciﬁ cally during early postnatal life, also inﬂ uences neural cell 
numbers in the hypothalamus and results in higher number of neurons that produce 
orexigenic neuropeptides (Plagemann et al., 1999c). In sharp contrast to perinatal 
overfeeding, maternal undernutrition  is associated with a reduction in the number of 
orexigenic neurons (García et al., 2010). However, whether this change in neuronal cell 
numbers is the result of a reduction of neurogenesis and cell migration or an enhance-
ment of programmed cell death remains to be investigated. The observation that the 
thickness of the neuroepithelium of the cortical plate is reduced in the fetuses of under-
nourished mothers supports the idea that maternal malnutrition may reduce cell prolif-
eration during embryonic life (Gressens et al., 1997). Moreover, expression screening 
indicates that a maternal low protein diet  downregulates various genes involved in brain 
development, including cell proliferation and differentiation genes (Coupe et al., 2010). 
Furthermore, astrocytogenesis, which directly follows the neurogenic period, is also 
affected by maternal diet. At weaning, the offspring of protein-restricted mothers have 
a reduced number of astrocytes  and a reduction in the glia-to-neuron ratio (Plagemann 
et al., 2000). These ﬁ ndings are particularly interesting because of the reported role of 
glial cells in the development of the nervous system and in processes such as synaptic 
plasticity and synaptogenesis (see Lemke, 2001).
11.5.2 Determination of neuronal connectivity
Impaired organization of hypothalamic circuits is a common feature of nutritional 
malprogramming. In particular, perturbations in the establishment of ARC neural 
projections have been reported in virtually all animals subjected to nutritional insults 
during perinatal life (XTab. 11.3). However, the degree of alterations may differ de-
pending on the nature of the nutritional insult. In both rodents and NHPs, the chronic 
consumption of an HFD during pregnancy induces a reduction in the density of ARC 
AgRP ﬁ bers that innervate the PVH (Grayson et al., 2010; Kirk et al., 2009). Similarly, 
maternal diabetes  alone (i.e., without maternal obesity) causes a reduction in the 
density of arcuate orexigenic (AgRP )- and anorexigenic (aMSH)-containing ﬁ bers that 
innervate the PVH (Steculorum and Bouret, 2009). Moreover, maternal undernutrition 
affects the overall organization of hypothalamic neural projections (Coupe et al., 2010; 
Delahaye et al., 2008; Yura et al., 2005). Therefore, both a surfeit and a paucity of 
nutrition during gestation impair hypothalamic neural projections. This paradoxical 
observation is exempliﬁ ed in animal models of chronic postnatal overnutrition and un-
dernutrition. Animals raised in either small or large litters display a disruption of arcuate 
projections containing aMSH and AgRP peptides (Bouret et al., 2007). Moreover, in 
intrauterine growth-retarded animals, the timing of catch-up growth is an important 
determinant for postnatal hypothalamic development. Whereas early catch-up growth 
ameliorates the abnormal organization of hypothalamic pathways and is highly ben-
eﬁ cial for markers of brain development, including markers of cell adhesion and axon 

11.6 Developmental signals inﬂ uencing the ultimate architecture    121
elongation, late catch-up growth causes more detrimental neurodevelopmental effects 
in the  hypothalamus (Coupe et al., 2010).
It is important to recognize that the nervous system, including the hypothalamus, 
continues to remodel and change not just early in development but throughout the 
entire period of development and even during adulthood in response to environmental 
inﬂ uences and genetically programmed events. Consistent with this idea, recent data 
from Horvath and collaborators (2010) have shown a signiﬁ cant remodeling of synapses  
in obese-prone (DIO) rats, particularly in response to nutritional challenges. First, obese-
prone DIO rats fed a chow diet display increased inhibitory inputs to POMC  neurons 
compared to obesity-resistant (diet-resistant, DR) rats. Second, POMC neurons of obese-
prone DIO rats exposed to an HFD lose synapses, whereas control  (obesity-resistant) 
rats show an increase in POMC synaptic coverage (Horvath et al., 2010).
11.6  Developmental signals inﬂ uencing the ultimate architecture 
of neuroendocrine feeding pathways
An important number of developmental signals control the ultimate architecture of hy-
pothalamic feeding pathways. These signals can inﬂ uence one or multiple components 
of hypothalamic development, including neurogenesis, axonal growth, and synaptogen-
esis. Among this array of signals, particular attention has been paid to the importance 
of hormones in hypothalamic development. A particular salient example is the role of 
leptin  in hypothalamic development (for review see Bouret, 2010b; Udagawa et al., 
2007). Recent data from our laboratory indicate that embryos that lack leptin (Lepob/
Lepob ) have a decrease in cell proliferation in the neuroepithelium of the third ventricle 
(Ishii et al., 2009), which is the embryonic brain structure that ultimately generates 
hypothalamic neurons. Consistent with these data, the number of neurons involved 
in feeding regulation, in particular POMC, orexin A, and MCH neurons, is reduced in 
the hypothalamus of Lepob/Lepob mice (Ishii et al., 2009). These observations are con-
sistent with the ﬁ nding that fetuses of HFD dams, which are hyperleptinemic, display 
an enhanced neurogenesis  in the developing hypothalamus (Chang et al., 2008; Gupta 
et al., 2009). The organizational effects of leptin are not restricted to a cell number 
determination. Leptin also inﬂ uences the strength of axonal projections of neuroendo-
crine systems that are involved in appetite regulation. One hypothalamic nucleus that 
has received a signiﬁ cant amount of attention with respect to the leptin inﬂ uence on 
hypothalamic circuit development is the ARC. As noted previously, ARC  neural projec-
tions develop primarily postnatally in rodents, and leptin is a required hormonal signal 
for the normal development of these pathways. Mice lacking leptin or leptin receptors 
show excessive reductions in the density of arcuate axons that innervate the PVH  (Bou-
ret et al., 2004b). Similarly, obese leptin receptor-deﬁ cient Zucker rats have a reduced 
density of AgRP-immunoreactive nerve ﬁ bers in the PVH (Bouret and Simerly, 2007). 
The magnitude of leptin levels during the ﬁ rst postnatal weeks is particularly important 
for the proper development of ARC axonal projections. Therefore, animals raised in 
SLs or animals born to obese dams show elevated postnatal leptin levels that are as-
sociated with the disrupted development of ARC projections (Bouret et al., 2007; Kirk 
et al., 2009). Similarly, animals raised in LLs or pups born to undernourished mothers 
exhibit blunted postnatal leptin levels that are also associated with perturbations in the 

122    11 Emerging role of neuroendocrine programming in obesity 
development of ARC axonal projections (Bouret et al., 2007; Delahaye et al., 2008; Yura 
et al., 2005). Remarkably, daily leptin treatment during early postnatal life in pups born 
to undernourished dams normalizes their metabolic abnormalities (Vickers et al., 2005), 
which indicates that metabolic malprogramming is potentially reversible with leptin 
administration during speciﬁ c phases of developmental plasticity. Leptin continues to 
remodel hypothalamic circuits not just early in development but throughout the entire 
life span. For example, the seminal work of Pinto and colleagues (2004) demonstrated 
a signiﬁ cant and rapid synaptic remodeling in the ARC of Lepob/Lepob mice in response 
to leptin injections during adult life.
In fact, a variety of hormones play orchestrated roles in the development of the 
neuroendocrine systems. For example, insulin has long been associated with brain 
development. Interestingly, a reduced number of arcuate neurons has been reported in 
the offspring of diabetic mothers, and this reduction of neuronal cell number is prevent-
able by the normalization of glycemia using pancreatic islet transplantation  (Franke 
et al., 2005). These key observations suggest that maternal insulin and/or glucose levels 
are critical for the proper determination of neuronal cell number in the hypothala-
mus. Correct insulin levels during early postnatal life also appear to be an important 
determinant for proper hypothalamic development. Cross-fostering  experiments have 
shown that normal neonates raised by diabetic mothers during the lactating period 
have an alteration in the number of arcuate neurons (Fahrenkrog et al., 2004). Also, 
intra-hypothalamic hyperinsulinism induced experimentally during early postnatal life 
causes structural alterations in the hypothalamus and life-long metabolic dysregula-
tion (Plagemann et al., 1992, 1999b). Neonatal insulin levels can not only determine 
hypothalamic neuronal cell numbers but also inﬂ uence the number of astrocytes in the 
hypothalamus. Whereas hypoinsulinemic pups born to protein-restricted dams display 
a reduction in the number of astrocytes (Plagemann et al., 2000), the offspring of dia-
betic mothers have increased insulin levels that are associated with an increase in the 
numbers of astrocytes  (Plagemann et al., 1992, 1999a). The observation that insulin 
simulates glial ﬁ brillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression further supports a role for 
this hormone in astrocyte development and function (Toran-Allerand et al., 1991). In 
addition, insulin is an important axonotrophic factor. The incubation of hypothalamic 
explants in vitro with insulin causes neurite extension (Toran-Allerand et al., 1988). Fur-
thermore, in vivo experiments indicate that insulin acts in synapse development (Kessler 
et al., 1984), which suggests a role for insulin in synaptogenesis. Other hormones, such 
as ghrelin and corticosterone, also have organizational effects on hypothalamic neural 
circuits by modulating the synaptic inputs of arcuate POMC  and NPY  neurons in adult 
mice (Gyengesi et al., 2010; Pinto et al., 2004).
11.7 Perspectives and conclusions
It is now clear from several different ﬁ elds of research that the disruption of neurode-
velopmental processes can lead to diseases later in life. The current stage of knowledge 
of neuroendocrine programming is probably just the tip of the iceberg considering the 
important potential for this emerging ﬁ eld and the complexity of hypothalamic develop-
ment. A comprehensive understanding of perinatally acquired obesity will require a 
map of the neuroendocrine system’s intricate wiring diagram, the breakdown of which

will ultimately be responsible for the emergence of a particular metabolic phenotype. 
A better understanding of how neuroendocrine pathways develop under a particular 
intrauterine and/or extrauterine environment is also critical for the development of in-
terventional studies to ameliorate and hopefully reverse the metabolic malprogramming 
of the fetus and/or neonate.

12  Genetic inﬂ uences on the long-term effects of 
the perinatal environment on energy homeostasis 
and offspring obesity
Barry E. Levin
Much of human obesity is inherited as a polygenic disorder which can then be inﬂ uenced by 
perinatal factors. In rodents, perinatal manipulations can have a major impact on the devel-
opment of neural systems that regulate energy homeostasis, i.e. the balance among energy 
intake, expenditure and storage. To assess gene-environment interactions, we selectively bred 
rats to develop diet-induced obesity (DIO) or to be diet-resistant (DR) when fed a high fat 
diet. Maternal obesity throughout gestation and lactation in DIO, but not DR dams augments 
the development of obesity in their offspring. However, if DR neonates are fostered to obese 
DIO dams, they do become obese on high fat diet possibly due to high insulin levels in 
the milk of obese DIO dams. Importantly, alterations of the early postnatal and pre-pubertal 
environments can also have major, long-term effects on the development neural pathways 
and the sensitivity to hormones involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Although 
the development of these pathways differs temporally between humans and rodents, animal 
models offer the potential for identifying factors in the perinatal environment that might be-
come therapeutic targets to prevent the development of obesity in genetically predisposed 
individuals. More importantly, such models might provide clues for the prevention of obesity 
as primary goal for stemming the obesity epidemic.
12.1 Introduction
The idea that the perinatal nutritional environment can affect the metabolic status of off-
spring arose from epidemiological studies in offspring of mothers who were exposed to 
gestational undernutrition during the famine that followed World War II in Holland (Rav-
elli and Belmont, 1979; Ravelli et al., 1976; Ravelli et al., 1998; Stein et al., 1995) and 
Germany (Dorner, 1973). Although the results varied with regard to outcome, these and 
other studies (Barker, 1995; Barker, 1998) suggested that undernutrition during various 
stages of gestation is associated with an increased risk of adverse metabolic outcomes 
in offspring. These include obesity, diabetes, hypertension, stroke and other metabolic 
outcomes (Gillman et al., 2001; O’Tierney et al., 2009; Plagemann et al., 2002; Ravelli 
et al., 2000). However, as might be expected from a heterogeneous population, such 
outcomes vary considerably. This is not surprising with regard to obesity since almost 
70% of human obesity is inherited as a polygenic trait  (Bouchard and  Tremblay, 1990; 
Stunkard et al., 1986) and the most common forms of human obesity arise from the 
 interactions of multiple genes, environmental factors, and behavior (Comuzzie and 

130    12  Genetic inﬂ uences on the long-term effects perinatal environment
Allison, 1998). Thus, different long-term outcomes would be expected in offspring de-
pending upon the interaction of their perinatal environment and genetic backgrounds.
In addition to gestational undernutrition, maternal obesity  can also predispose to 
offspring obesity. Although it is known that parental obesity has a high correlation with 
offspring obesity (Maffeis et al., 1994; Schaefer-Graf et al., 2005), the inability to identify 
individual obesity-prone humans accurately before they become obese makes interpre-
tation of such data difﬁ cult with regard to the role of environment x gene interactions. 
Finally, although strides have been made with sophisticated imaging techniques to link 
obesity with altered brain function (Baicy et al., 2007; Batterham et al., 2007; Del Parigi 
et al., 2002; Farooqi et al., 2007; Matsuda et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2001), these tech-
niques still lack sufﬁ cient resolution to assess the function of complex brain regions that 
regulate energy homeostasis such as the hypothalamus and brainstem. Thus, many of the 
advances in our understanding of how genotype interacts with the brain – body-external 
environment interface to alter the regulation of energy homeostasis  in offspring have 
utilized animal models. These interactions are the subject of this review with a speciﬁ c 
focus on the perinatal and pre-pubescent periods since this is the time during which the 
development of these systems are highly susceptible to environmental perturbations.
12.2 Neural control of energy homeostasis
Energy homeostasis is the balance between intake and expenditure, where adipose 
depots act as the buffer for any imbalance between the two. The regulation of energy 
homeostasis reﬂ ects an ongoing dialogue among the internal and external environments 
and the brain . The brain senses and integrates a multitude of hormonal, metabolic and 
hard wired neural signals from peripheral sensors and organs to regulate both the con-
trol of individual meals and the long-term balance between intake and expenditure. 
Leptin , which is produced by adipose depots in proportion to their size, acts as the 
prototypic signal for informing the brain as to the status of peripheral adipose stores 
(Zhang et al., 1994). As depot size increases due to energy excess, leptin levels increase 
to provide a tonic, negative feedback on anabolic, and a positive feedback on catabolic 
neural circuits. Insulin , although produced by the pancreas, indirectly reﬂ ects adipose 
levels (Bagdade et al., 1967; Polonsky et al., 1988) and acts as an additional long-
term negative feedback signal. A variety of gut neuropeptides are produced in response 
to both pre- and postingestive factors to modulate short-term regulation of individual 
meals (Shin et al., 2009). Many of these peptides are sensed by vagal and sympathetic 
afferents which terminate in critical brainstem areas (Shin et al., 2009). In addition, 
peripheral metabolic substrates such as glucose, fatty acids, ketone bodies and lactate, 
as well as cytokines, signal the brain via these same autonomic afferents, as well as by 
direct transport across the blood-brain barrier  (Levin, 2006; Levin et al., 2004b; Patter-
son and Levin, 2008). These signals are sensed and integrated by a distributed network 
of “metabolic sensing” neurons located in discrete areas throughout the brain. These 
include critical hypothalamic nuclei such as the arcuate  (ARC) and ventromedial  (VMN) 
nuclei (Levin, 2006; Levin et al., 2004b; Patterson and Levin, 2008). The integrated 
signals from this network are relayed to neuroendocrine and autonomic output areas of 
the hypothalamus (paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA)) 
and hindbrain. In addition, neurons in areas of the brain involved in motivation, reward 

12.4 Gene x environment interactions in the development of obesity    131
and memory are engaged by many of the same afferent signals from the periphery 
(Levin, 2006; Levin et al., 2004b; Patterson and Levin, 2008).
12.3 Development of neural systems controlling energy homeostasis
Progenitor cells arise in a number of sites throughout the nervous system and differ-
entiate during development into glial and neural elements. In the hypothalamus , new 
neuron formation (neurogenesis ) takes place in the neuroepithelial lining of the third 
cerebral ventricle from which they migrate to their ﬁ nal destination (Altman and Bayer, 
1978; Cottrell et al., 2009; Kokoeva et al., 2005; Kokoeva et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2005). 
At this point, neurons send out axons to their target areas. Neurons whose axons that 
form functional target connections survive and those that do not undergo apoptotic 
cell death (Botchkina and Morin, 1995; Fujioka et al., 1999). While there are many 
similarities, there are critical differences in the temporal patterns of central nervous 
system development between humans and rodents. For example, whereas the human 
hypothalamus is completely developed at birth (Ackland et al., 1983; Bugnon et al., 
1982; Burford and Robinson, 1982; Koutcherov et al., 2002; Mai et al., 1997), most 
rodent hypothalamic neurons are born during late gestation (Markakis, 2002) but ARC 
projections to the PVN are not completed until postnatal day (P)12–14 in rodents 
(Bouret et al., 2004a; Grove et al., 2003; Grove and Smith, 2003). Also, while some 
hypothalamic neurogenesis continues into early postnatal, and, in some cases, adult 
life in rodents (Cottrell et al., 2009; Kokoeva et al., 2005; Kokoeva et al., 2007), it 
is unknown whether similar continued neurogenesis occurs in humans. Finally, other 
brain areas also undergo different temporal patterns of this developmental sequence 
and these  patterns are different in human vs. rodent brains.
Regardless of the temporal sequences, there are numerous factors that can inﬂ u-
ence neural development. Importantly, both leptin and insulin can affect the migration 
(Udagawa et al., 2006), survival (neurotropic) and process outgrowth (neurotrophic) 
of developing neurons (Bouret et al., 2004b; Bouret et al., 2008; Puro and Agardh, 
1984; Recio-Pinto et al., 1984; Tanaka et al., 1995; Udagawa et al., 2006). Rodents 
with deﬁ cient leptin signaling have abnormal development of ARC-PVN axonal projec-
tions of anabolic neuropeptide Y  (NPY/ agouti-related peptide  (AgRP) and catabolic 
proopiomelanocortin  (POMC) neurons involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis 
(Bouret et al., 2004b; Bouret et al., 2008). On the other hand, injection of insulin into 
the dam during the last week of gestation ( Jones and Dayries, 1990; Jones et al., 1995; 
Jones et al., 1996) or directly into the hypothalamus on or before P8, produces  obesity 
and associated alterations in hypothalamic development (Plagemann et al., 1992; 
Plagemann et al., 1999b). Thus, during early development, leptin and insulin play a 
primary role in neural development. Later, their primary roles involve the regulation of 
metabolic function and energy homeostasis.
12.4 Gene x environment interactions in the development of obesity
Both maternal undernutrition (caloric or protein) or obesity, as well as offspring over-
nutrition can lead to obesity and/or diabetes in adult offspring of both humans and 

132    12  Genetic inﬂ uences on the long-term effects perinatal environment
rodents (Buckley et al., 2005; Faust et al., 1980; Fernandez-Twinn et al., 2004; Guo and 
Jen, 1995; Jones and Friedman, 1982; Jones et al., 1984; Jones et al., 1986; Kennedy, 
1957; Levin et al., 2005; Ozanne et al., 2004; Ravelli et al., 1998; Ravelli et al., 1999; 
Samuelsson et al., 2008). In rodents, such perinatal environmental manipulations have 
lasting effects on the development and function of hypothalamic pathways and systems 
involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis (Cripps et al., 2009; Gorski et al., 2006; 
Heidel et al., 1999; Irani et al., 2009; Jones et al., 1995; Le Foll et al., 2009; Levin and 
Dunn-Meynell, 2002; Plagemann et al., 1998a; Plagemann et al., 1998b; Plagemann 
et al., 1999a). With the exception of one rodent study (Reifsnyder et al., 2000), most 
others were carried out either retrospectively in humans or in animal models where 
genetic predispositions towards obesity were not considered. This lack of such gene x 
environment interaction studies ﬁ rst led us to develop substrains of rats which we se-
lectively bred for their propensity to develop diet-induced obesity  (DIO) or to be diet-
resistant (DR) when fed a 31%, 25% sucrose high energy (HE) diet (Levin et al., 1997). 
The resulting phenotypic traits have been remarkably stable due to their polygenic mode 
of inheritance  (Levin et al., 2003a). The obesity of DIO rats occurs only after exposure 
to diets similar to the HE diet. This obesity is associated with hyperphagia , insulin resis-
tance , hypertension  and hyperlipidemia (Ricci and Levin, 2003). Thus, this rat strain has 
many of the characteristics of a polygenically inherited metabolic syndrome seen in a 
majority of obese humans (Bouchard and Perusse, 1993; Stunkard et al., 1986).
Importantly, selectively bred DIO rats have an early postnatal resistance to the behav-
ioral and physiological effects of leptin on neural development and energy homeostasis. 
By P10 they have reduced signaling downstream of the long, signaling form of the 
leptin receptor (Lepr-b) in the ARC (Bouret et al., 2008). Before they become obese 
they have reduced Lepr-b gene expression (Levin et al., 2003b; Levin et al., 2004a), 
binding of leptin to its receptor (Irani et al., 2007) and the excitatory effects of leptin 
on their ARC and/or VMN neurons (Irani et al., 2009). These early postnatal molecular 
and cellular aspects of leptin resistance  are associated with a reduced trophic effect 
on the outgrowth of ARC-PVN AgRP and alpha-MSH axonal projections (Bouret et al., 
2008). In the VMN,  they also have reduced dendritic arborizations (Labelle et al., 2009) 
and numbers of neurons (Levin, 1996) and sensitivity to the effects of glucose and fatty 
acids (Le Foll et al., 2009). After weaning, leptin resistance in non-obese DIO rats is 
associated with reduced anorectic and thermogenic effects of leptin as compared to DR 
rats (Gorski et al., 2007). In addition to this inherent leptin resistance, DIO rats have 
both reduced ARC binding of insulin to its receptors (Irani et al., 2009) and a reduced 
anorectic response to centrally administered insulin (Clegg et al., 2005). DIO rats also 
have altered hypothalamic norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin function before 
they become obese (Hassanain and Levin, 2002; Levin, 1995; Levin, 1996; Wilmot 
et al., 1988).
Using this model, we showed that making DIO dams obese during gestation and 
lactation caused their adult offspring to become obese and insulin resistant when fed 
only a low fat diet and further accentuated their obesity when placed on HE diet (Levin 
and Govek, 1998). In addition, these offspring had fewer PVN norepinephrine reuptake 
transporters  (Levin and Dunn-Meynell, 2002). Since these transporters remove norepi-
nephrine from the synapse and since PVN norepinephrine infusions cause hyperphagia 
and obesity (Leibowitz et al., 1984), the reduced complement of PVN transporters in 
offspring of obese DIO dams would be predicted to increase PVN NE levels and to 

12.4 Gene x environment interactions in the development of obesity    133
increase their adiposity. On the other hand, neither maternal intake of HE diet nor 
obesity during gestation and lactation caused DR offspring to become obese (Levin 
and Govek, 1998). These studies show the critical importance of gene x environment 
interactions in determining the obesity phenotype of offspring.
These interactions also affect the sensitivity to leptin and metabolic substrates on 
metabolic sensing neurons in the hypothalamus. Offspring of lean DIO dams have fewer 
VMN  neurons that are excited and more that are inhibited by leptin than do offspring 
of lean DR dams. Maternal intake of HE diet during gestation and lactation reduces the 
number of leptin-excited neurons in both DIO and DR offspring but has a much greater 
inhibitory effect on neurons from offspring of obese DIO dams (Irani et al., 2009). The 
VMN is also enriched in metabolic sensing neurons which respond to both glucose and 
long chain fatty acids. Whereas offspring of lean DIO dams have two fold more VMN 
neurons that are inhibited by glucose (GI neurons) than do those of lean DR dams, this 
difference is eliminated in offspring of obese DIO dams (Le Foll et al., 2009). Similarly, 
while offspring of lean DIO dams have more GI neurons that are either excited or 
inhibited by oleic acid than do lean DR offspring, maternal obesity exaggerates this 
difference in offspring of obese DIO dams (Le Foll et al., 2009). Thus, VMN neurons in 
DIO rats are generally less responsive to both hormonal and metabolic signals from the 
periphery than are those from DR rats and this difference is exaggerated by maternal 
intake of HE diet and the development of obesity in DIO dams.
Since a great deal of hypothalamic development occurs postnatally in rodents  (Bouret 
and Simerly, 2007), manipulation of the postnatal environment can have major effects 
on this development in genetically predisposed animals. Cross-fostering obesity-resistant 
DR pups to obese (but not lean) DIO dams causes them to become obese and insulin 
resistant when fed HE diet as adults (Gorski et al., 2006). Their obesity is associated with 
an anabolic proﬁ le in their hypothalamus (increased ARC AgRP and decreased VMN 
Lepr-b and insulin receptor mRNA expression) (Gorski et al., 2006). This adverse effect 
of fostering DR pups to obese DIO dams may be due to the high insulin levels present in 
their milk (Gorski et al., 2006) since rat pups absorb insulin from milk  during the early 
postnatal period (Koldovsky et al., 1995; Sanchez et al., 2005) and increasing hypo-
thalamic insulin levels during this period causes obesity in adult offspring (Plagemann 
et al., 1992). Unfortunately, while DR rats can be made more obese by raising them in 
an obesogenic environment, the opposite is not true. Fostering offspring of either lean 
or obese DIO dams to DR dams does not prevent their development of obesity when 
they are later exposed to HE diet (Gorski et al., 2006). Thus, these studies demonstrate a 
potent, genotype-speciﬁ c effect of the postnatal environment on altering the phenotype 
of offspring.
Even though most postnatal hypothalamic development is thought to be completed 
during the ﬁ rst 2 weeks of life (Bouret and Simerly, 2007), it is likely that both hypo-
thalamic and other brain area development continues over longer postnatal periods 
 (Burnett et al., 2009; Ellgren et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2009; Kokoeva et al., 2005; Kokoeva 
et al., 2007; Lehmann et al., 2009). Although exercise  causes weight loss in obese adult 
male rodents, (Levin and Dunn-Meynell, 2004; Levin and Dunn-Meynell, 2006; Mayer 
et al., 1954), they regain their lost weight as soon as exercise ceases (Applegate et al., 
1984). In light of the continued brain development during early life, we hypothesized 
that beginning exercise prior to puberty might have a persistent effect on lowering body 
weight in DIO rats. Thus, when male DIO rats were fed HE diet and given access to a 

134    12  Genetic inﬂ uences on the long-term effects perinatal environment
running wheel for only three weeks, beginning at four weeks of age, they gained less 
weight than sedentary DIO rats. Moreover, when the wheels were removed, they main-
tained their lower body weight and adiposity for up to two and a half months (Patterson 
et al., 2008). Their obesity resistance was associated with an increased sensitivity to the 
anorectic effects of leptin and increased binding of leptin and signaling downstream of 
the leptin receptor in the ARC (Patterson et al., 2009). Unexpectedly, although this early 
onset exercise did not correct the defective development of the ARC-PVN pathways of 
exercising DIO rats, caloric restriction during this same period further decreased the 
density of ARC axons in the PVN in association with increased weight gain above that 
seen in sedentary rats when ad libitum food intake was restored (Patterson et al., 2008). 
Thus, interventions begun as late as weaning, but prior to puberty onset, can have long 
lasting positive or negative effects on brain function and structure and body weight gain 
phenotype in genetically obese DIO rats.
12.5 Summary and conclusions
Once it develops, only surgical intervention has proven effective as a treatment for obe-
sity in humans. For that reason, prevention is the best strategy to ﬁ ght the world-wide 
epidemic of obesity. Because energy homeostasis is regulated by the brain and because 
the development of neural systems that regulate energy homeostasis are affected by a 
number of perinatal and early pre-pubertal interventions, this developmental period 
provides a potential time window for identiﬁ cation of factors that might prevent the 
development of obesity. Since human obesity has a strong underlying genetic predis-
position, a focus on gene x environment interactions in surrogate rodent models is a 
reasonable approach to identifying potential preventive strategies. Of course, to apply 
lessons learned from such animal models would require that we prospectively be able 
to identify humans who are at high risk for becoming obese. Thus, research in this 
ﬁ eld should also focus on early identiﬁ cation of common traits shared by obesity-prone 
animal models and humans and on factors that alter the likelihood that such individu-
als will become obese. Our studies suggest that a proﬁ table area for exploration is 
the identiﬁ cation of speciﬁ c factors produced by alterations of the perinatal nutritional 
and metabolic environments and physiological interventions such as exercise that 
increase the inhibitory feedback of signals such as leptin as a strategy for producing 
 pharmacological interventions to prevent and/or treat early onset obesity.

13  Perinatal programming in offspring of diabetic 
mothers: Clinical data
Peter Damm, Louise Kelstrup, Elisabeth R. Mathiesen, 
and Tine Dalsgaard Clausen
The epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes has a major impact on public health and un-
derlines the urgency for identiﬁ cation of risk groups to target preventive strategies. Studies of 
developmental origins of health and disease have highlighted the possible role of intrauterine 
exposure to maternal diabetes in the pathogenesis of overweight, type 2 diabetes, and car-
diovascular disease. Furthermore, diabetes in pregnancy may also affect cognitive function 
in the offspring. This review primarily includes human studies of long-term implications for 
the offspring of maternal diabetes during pregnancy – with special focus on recent studies 
performed in Copenhagen. We ﬁ nd that fetuses exposed to intrauterine hyperglycemia have 
a signiﬁ cantly increased risk of development of type 2 diabetes/prediabetes, overweight, and 
the metabolic syndrome in childhood and adult life.
Thus, based on literature and own studies, we conclude that women with gestational 
diabetes or type 1 diabetes during pregnancy should be informed about the excess risk of 
overweight, type 2 diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome in their offspring and that preven-
tive strategies toward diabetes and cardiovascular disease are urgently needed in the next 
generation.
13.1 Introduction
Studies of developmental origins of health and disease have put focus on the possible 
role of intrauterine exposure to maternal diabetes in the pathogenesis of overweight, 
type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (Dabelea, 2007; Gillman, 2005), and diabe-
tes in pregnancy may also affect cognitive function in the offspring (Rizzo et al., 1991).
The majority of previous studies have been performed in ethnically mixed  populations, 
and data from Caucasians are limited.
The aim of this chapter is to summarize the possible long-term implications of mater-
nal diabetes for the human offspring followed into adulthood with special focus on re-
cent studies performed in Copenhagen. As described previously in this book, low birth 
weight is strongly associated with later development of diabetes and cardiovascular 
disease, but, in fact, the relationship between birth weight and subsequent development 
of diabetes is U-shaped. This has been found in animal studies as well as in humans 
(Aerts, Holemans, and Van Assche, 1990; Egeland, Skjaerven, and Irgens, 2000; Pettitt 
and Knowler, 1998), and over the years, parallel studies of developmental origins of 
health and disease have focused also on the possible role of fetal overnutrition as seen 
in relation to maternal diabetes in pregnancy (Gillman, 2005).

13.2 Short-term implications for the offspring
Both pregestational diabetes (type 1  as well as type 2 diabetes ) and gestational diabetes  
(GDM) imply increased risk of several perinatal complications. The most severe and fre-
quent include perinatal mortality, congenital malformations, prematurity, macrosomia, 
shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, respiratory difﬁ culties, and jaundice.
Several studies have shown associations between increasing maternal glucose values 
during pregnancy and increasing risk of perinatal complications (Clausen et al., 2005; 
Jensen et al., 2001, 2003, 2004; Lauenborg et al., 2003; Metzger et al., 2008). It is 
now well established that intensiﬁ ed maternal glucose control improves the short-term/
perinatal outcome of both pregestational diabetic pregnancy (DCCT Research Group, 
1996) and GDM (Crowther et al., 2005; Landon et al., 2009).
13.3 Long-term implications for the offspring
In animal studies, intrauterine hyperglycemia  increases the risk of abnormal glucose tol-
erance, diabetes , overweight , and insulin-resistance in the offspring (Plagemann, 2005). 
Transplantation of islet cells, before the last third of pregnancy, normalizes maternal gly-
cemia and prevents harmful effects (Aerts and Van Assche, 1992; Harder et al., 2001).
At present there are no animal studies of cognitive function  in offspring exposed to 
intrauterine hyperglycemia, but in rodent models of type 1 diabetes cognitive function 
in adult animals is adversely affected by hyperglycemia in fetal life (Biessels and Gispen, 
2005). Deleterious effects of hyperglycemia are related to the severity of glycemic de-
rangement (Biessels et al., 1996) and are furthermore preventable through immediate 
insulin treatment (Biessels et al., 1998).
In animal models it is possible to separate genetic and environmental factors when 
long-term effects of intrauterine exposure to intrauterine hyperglycemia are studied. In 
contrast, this is more complicated in human studies, for example, because ideal control 
groups are very difﬁ cult to identify, and in fact, many published studies do not have 
optimal control groups. In our recent studies we aimed to separate the effect of genes 
and environment.
13.3.1 Studies in adults
Overall, there is only sparse literature addressing the risk of type 2 diabetes , over-
weight , and other cardiovascular risk factors  in adult offspring of women with diabetes 
during pregnancy  (Dabelea, Knowler, and Pettitt, 2000; Franks et al., 2006; Gautier 
et al., 2001; Nilsson, 1999; Pettitt et al., 1988, 1991; Pribylova and Dvorakova, 1996; 
Sobngwi et al., 2003), and only one study evaluates cognitive function in the offspring 
(Nielsen et al., 2007).
Findings are not uniform; the studies did not report data on lipid metabolism in the 
offspring, and only papers on the Pima Indians (Franks et al., 2006; Pettitt et al., 1991) as 
well as the study on cognitive function (Nielsen et al., 2007) included data on estimates 
of maternal glycemic control during pregnancy.
The population of Pima Indians  in Arizona has been followed prospectively with oral 
glucose tolerance tests  (OGTT) since 1965 (Pettitt et al., 1993). Papers have been pub-
lished demonstrating that diabetes in pregnancy and the level of 2-hour blood glucose 

13.3 Long-term implications for the offspring    143
during OGTT in pregnancy are strong predictors of overweight and type 2 diabetes in the 
offspring (Dabelea et al., 2000; Franks et al., 2006; Pettitt et al., 1988, 1991), and signs 
of impaired insulin sensitivity have been reported in the form of elevated levels of fast-
ing insulin (Pettitt et al., 1991). However, Pima Indians have very speciﬁ c genetics, with 
a prevalence of overweight and type 2 diabetes each reaching 70% by the age of 25, 
making it difﬁ cult to apply these ﬁ ndings to other populations.
In a study from Prague, 148 offspring of women with type 1 diabetes  were compared 
with 31 matched controls of healthy mothers without a family history of diabetes (Priby-
lova and Dvorakova, 1996). Offspring of women with type 1 diabetes had signiﬁ cantly 
higher blood glucose and insulin levels during OGTT as well as higher BMI  and blood 
pressure . Of the offspring studied, 9% had impaired glucose tolerance  (IGT) or type 2 
diabetes, and 5% had type 1 diabetes. A French study compared 15 offspring of mothers 
with type 1 diabetes (exposed) with 16 offspring of fathers with type 1 diabetes (unex-
posed) and found no difference concerning BMI, fat mass, waist – hip ratio, or blood 
pressure (Sobngwi et al., 2003). However, 33% of the exposed offspring compared with 
none of the nonexposed offspring had IGT. Exposed offspring with IGT had the overall 
lowest early insulin secretion index compared with exposed without IGT as well as un-
exposed. Exposed offspring had lower C-peptide levels than unexposed, and those with 
IGT had the lowest level of all, but none of the offspring had autoantibodies known to 
be associated with type 1 diabetes. The three groups had comparable insulin sensitivity.
Finally, a Danish study linked data from hospital records with data from the Dan-
ish Medical Birth Registry and the Conscript Registry (Nielsen et al., 2007). The study 
included 227 men 18 to 20 years old, born to women with gestational and pregesta-
tional diabetes. Controls were 736 unexposed men matched on birth year and maternal 
residence at time of birth. Offspring of women with diabetes during pregnancy had a 
signiﬁ cantly higher army rejection rate and insigniﬁ cantly lower test-scores at conscrip-
tion (3.0 points on the commonly used IQ-scale, P = 0.12) than controls. In a subgroup 
with available measures of maternal HbA1c during pregnancy, HbA1c  was inversely 
associated with cognitive performance .
13.3.2 Studies in children
There are markedly more follow-up studies in children up to adolescence (Aberg and 
Westbom, 2001; Boney et al., 2005; Bunt, Tataranni, and Salbe, 2005; Cho et al., 2000; 
Churchill, Berendes, and Nemore, 1969; Cummins and Norrish, 1980; Dahlquist and 
Kallen, 2007; Gillman et al., 2003; Hadden et al., 1984; Haworth, McRae, and Dilling, 
1976; Hillier et al., 2007; Hod et al., 1999; Hunter et al., 2004; Kowalczyk et al., 2002; 
Malcolm et al., 2006; Manderson et al., 2002; Metzger et al., 1990; Ornoy et al., 1998, 
1999, 2001; Persson and Gentz, 1984; Persson, Gentz, and Moller, 1984; Petersen et al., 
1988; Pettitt et al., 1983, 1985, 1987; Plagemann et al., 1997a, 1997b, 2005; Rizzo 
et al., 1990, 1991, 1994, 1995; Rodekamp et al., 2006; Schaefer-Graf et al., 2005; Sells 
et al., 1994; Silverman et al., 1995, 1998; Stehbens, Baker, and Kitchell, 1977; Vohr and 
McGarvey, 1997; Vohr, McGarvey, and Tucker, 1999; Weiss et al., 2000; Whitaker et al., 
1998). Several papers are from studies of the Pima Indians or from the Chicago group, 
but literature covers populations from most parts of the Western World.
Many studies are relatively small and include less than 100 exposed offspring or 
no internal control groups. Furthermore, some of the studies have limitations due to 

144    13 Perinatal programming in offspring of diabetic mothers: Clinical data
analysis, including maternal type 1 and type 2 diabetes together or high numbers lost 
to follow-up. Only one follow-up study of children from a small randomized trial in 
women with GDM has been performed, without deﬁ nitive conclusions (Malcolm et al., 
2006). The future will bring results from follow-up of offspring of mothers involved in 
the two trials on GDM treatment (Crowther et al., 2005; Landon et al., 2009).
There are several studies concerning glucose metabolism; the majority found 
increased risk of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes in offspring exposed to intrauterine 
 hyperglycemia, but others found no such indications.
There are also several studies evaluating overweight and cardiovascular risk factors 
in children born to women with diabetes in pregnancy, but only one study included 
all components of the metabolic syndrome  and found increased risk of the metabolic 
syndrome in 6–11-year-old offspring of women with GDM (Boney et al., 2005). The 
 majority of studies report an increased offspring risk of overweight  (Cho et al., 2000; 
Hillier et al., 2007; Hunter et al., 2004; Malcolm et al., 2006; Metzger et al., 1990; 
Pettitt et al., 1987; Plagemann et al., 1997b; Schaefer-Graf et al., 2005; Silverman 
et al., 1998; Vohr and McGarvey, 1997; Vohr et al., 1999; Weiss et al., 2000), though 
others are not consistent with this (Bunt et al., 2005; Gillman et al., 2003; Whitaker 
et al., 1998). According to individual cardiovascular risk factors , studies have reported 
increased systolic blood pressure , increased total cholesterol  and LDL, decreased HDL-
cholesterol, and increased waist-circumference in children of women with diabetes 
during pregnancy. However, ﬁ ndings are ambiguous as cholesterol, HDL, and waist 
circumference have also been found to be comparable between exposed and unex-
posed children, and levels of cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol  have even been found to 
be signiﬁ cantly lower in exposed offspring. Levels of triglycerides as well as diastolic 
blood pressure have uniformly been found unaffected.
Most studies have found indications of impaired insulin sensitivity  in diabetes-
 exposed offspring, however, one found signs of insulin secretion  deﬁ ciency (Plage-
mann et al., 1997a), and two studies found no indication of either (Bunt et al., 2005; 
 Manderson et al., 2002).
When it comes to studies of cognitive function in the offspring several different tests 
have been applied to children in different age groups, making it difﬁ cult to draw general 
conclusions because some subtests might be affected and others not. The following 
section, therefore, summarizes ﬁ ndings of the different studies in very general terms. 
Around half of the studies have found indications of impaired cognitive function  in 
offspring of women with diabetes in pregnancy (Aberg and Westbom, 2001; Churchill 
et al., 1969; Dahlquist and Kallen, 2007; Haworth et al., 1976; Hod et al., 1999; Kow-
alczyk et al., 2002; Ornoy et al., 1998, 1999, 2001; Petersen et al., 1988; Sells et al., 
1994; Stehbens et al., 1977), whereas the other half have not found this (Cummins and 
Norrish, 1980; Hadden et al., 1984; Persson and Gentz, 1984; Plagemann et al., 2005; 
Rizzo et al., 1990, 1991, 1994, 1995; Rodekamp et al., 2006; Silverman et al., 1998).
The most impressive studies are from the Chicago group and a group from Berlin as 
well as two large Swedish register studies; however, ﬁ ndings are to some extent not 
concordant. The Chicago group prospectively followed 200 children of women with 
GDM or pregestational diabetes and 30 controls of nondiabetic women with several 
tests from birth until the age of 16 years (Silverman et al., 1991). Test scores did not at 
any age differ between diabetes-exposed children and controls, but there were inverse 
 associations between estimates of maternal metabolism and offspring scores in cognitive 

13.4 Own studies    145
tests . The group from Berlin found no difference according to speech development in 
240 2-year-old diabetes-exposed offspring compared with the background population 
(Plagemann et al., 2005; Rodekamp et al., 2006). However, they found a dose – response 
relationship between ingestion of breast milk  from diabetic mothers during the ﬁ rst 
neonatal week and speech delay. Dahlquist and Kallen (2007) found lower school 
marks and an increased risk of not completing compulsory school in 6,400 16-year-
old offspring of women with unspeciﬁ ed diabetes during pregnancy compared with 
1.3 mil lion unexposed controls. Aberg and Westbom (2001) found an increased risk 
of hospitalizations for neurological/developmental disorders in 10-year-old offspring of 
women with pregestational diabetes (N = 3,874) as well as GDM (N = 8,684) compared 
with 1.2 million control-children of women without diabetes.
Finally, some studies in children demonstrate a direct association between estimates 
of maternal metabolism and overweight or other cardiovascular risk factors in the off-
spring; others fail to do so. As mentioned previously, the Chicago-group found several 
signiﬁ cant inverse associations between estimates of maternal glucose metabolism (i.e., 
fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, b-hydroxybutyrate, and free fatty acids) and offspring 
scores in cognitive tests, and this has also been found in other studies.
13.4 Own studies
We aimed to study the risk of type 2 diabetes  and prediabetes, as well as overweight  
and the metabolic syndrome  and the cognitive function  in adult offspring exposed to 
intrauterine hyperglycemia, focusing on associations between maternal glucose levels 
during pregnancy and offspring outcome.
A total of 597 subjects aged 18–27 years were studied. Four groups were chosen 
to represent various degrees of genetic disposition to type 2 diabetes and exposure to 
intrauterine hyperglycemia .
1.  Offspring of women with GDM (O-GDM), representing intrauterine hyperglycemia 
and a relatively high genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.
2.  Offspring of women who were screened for GDM because of risk indicators and 
elevated fasting blood glucose but had a normal OGTT (O-NoGDM), representing 
normal intrauterine glycemia and a relatively high genetic predisposition to type 
2 diabetes.
3.  Offspring of women with type 1 diabetes (O-Type 1), representing intrauterine 
hyperglycemia and a relatively low genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.
4.  Offspring of women from the background population (O-BP), representing normal 
intrauterine glycemia and a relatively low genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.
Of the eligible offspring, 56% participated, and no major demographic differences were 
found between participants and nonparticipants.
The subjects were examined thoroughly by OGTT, anthropometric examinations, 
blood tests, and testing of cognitive function. Furthermore, information on health, 
medication, smoking habits, and physical activity as well as information concerning 
current parental education and occupation and paternal diabetes status was collected 
(Clausen et al., 2008, 2009). Diabetes and prediabetes were classiﬁ ed according to the 
World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (WHO, 1999), and the metabolic syndrome 

146    13 Perinatal programming in offspring of diabetic mothers: Clinical data
was diagnosed based on the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria (Alberti, 
Zimmet, and Shaw, 2006).
We used ﬁ ve different estimates of intrauterine glycemia. In analyses based on all 
participants the assignment into four groups (O-GDM, O-NoGDM, O-Type1, and O-BP) 
was used as a surrogate measure of different levels of intrauterine glycemia. In analyses 
restricted to offspring of women who underwent an OGTT during pregnancy we used 
maternal fasting or 2-hour blood glucose. In analyses restricted to O-Type1, we used 
the mean maternal blood glucose in the ﬁ rst or third trimester as exposure variables. 
We tried carefully to correct for confounding in extensive statistical analyses. The preva-
lence of type 2 diabetes /prediabetes  was 21% in O-GDM, 12% in O-NoGDM, and 
11% in O-Type1 compared to 4% in O-BP. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes was 1% 
in O-NoGDM and 4% in O-Type1, whereas no O-GDM or O-BP had type 1 diabetes 
(XFig. 13.1).
Only 1 of the 11 cases of type 2 diabetes was known before the study, and the re-
maining were diagnosed during the study. Two of the nine cases of type 1 diabetes were 
diagnosed during the study. O-GDM had signiﬁ cantly higher fasting and 2-hour plasma 
glucose than O-BP, and also O-NoGDM had signiﬁ cantly higher fasting plasma glucose 
than O-BP. Finally O-Type1 had signiﬁ cantly higher 2-hour plasma glucose than O-BP.
The adjusted odds ratios (OR) for type 2 diabetes/prediabetes were markedly in-
creased in O-GDM (OR 7.76 (95% CI 2.58–23.39)), O-NoGDM (4.46 (1.38–14.46)) 
and O-Type1 (4.02 (1.31–12.33)) compared with O-BP.
A positive association between maternal glucose level and offspring risk of type 2 
diabetes/prediabetes was found.
The prevalence of offspring overweight  (BMI > 25kg/m2) was 40% in O-GDM, 30% in 
O-NoGDM, 41% in O-Type1, and 24% in O-BP, while the prevalence of the  metabolic 
syndrome was 24%, 15%, 14%, and 6%, respectively (XFig. 13.2).
In adjusted analyses the risk of overweight was signiﬁ cantly higher in O-GDM (OR 
1.79 (CI 95% 1.00–3.24)) and O-Type1 (OR 2.27 (1.30–3.98)) but not in O-NoGDM 
(OR 1.47 (0.78–2.78)) compared with O-BP. The risk of the metabolic syndrome was 
signiﬁ cantly higher in O-GDM, adjusted OR (4.12 (1.69–10.06)), O-NoGDM (2.74 
(1.08–6.97)), as well as in O-Type1 (2.59 (1.04–6.45)) compared with O-BP. A positive

13.5 Concluding remarks    147
association was found between maternal glucose levels and risk of the metabolic 
syndrome .
We ﬁ nd that our four groups are enriched with different combinations of exposure 
to intrauterine hyperglycemia and other risk factors for overweight and the metabolic 
syndrome, which enables us to some extent to evaluate the possible impact of intrauter-
ine hyperglycemia in a human model. In this context, we hypothesize that differences 
according to outcome between O-GDM and O-NoGDM as well as between O-Type1 
and O-BP could be partly explained by a lasting effect of intrauterine hyperglycemia. 
On the other hand, the difference between O-GDM and O-Type1 as well as between 
O-NoGDM and O-BP could be interpreted as a reﬂ ection of genetics and other risk 
factors.
13.5 Concluding remarks
The Copenhagen study (Clausen et al., 2008, 2009) demonstrated a high risk of type 2 
diabetes/prediabetes in adult offspring of mothers with GDM in a primarily Caucasian 
population, and data is in accordance with results from high-risk populations (Pettitt 
et al., 1988) as well as studies of children from Caucasian populations (Plagemann 
et al., 1997a; Silverman et al., 1998).
The ﬁ ndings of a higher risk of type 2 diabetes/prediabetes, overweight, and the meta-
bolic syndrome in O-Type1 compared with O-BP as well as several associations be-
tween maternal glucose values during pregnancy and adverse outcome in the offspring 
support the hypothesis that a hyperglycemic intrauterine environment play a role in the 
pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, overweight, and the metabolic syndrome, in addition 
to genetics and other risk factors. Aiming at glycemic levels as normal as possible in 
women with diabetes during pregnancy would prevent many of the perinatal complica-
tions and may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, overweight, the metabolic syndrome, 
and cognitive deﬁ cits in the offspring, but randomized trials are needed to prove this.

148    13 Perinatal programming in offspring of diabetic mothers: Clinical data
Mothers with gestational diabetes  as well as type 1 diabetes  in pregnancy should 
receive information about the increased risk in their offspring, and preventive strategies 
for diabetes and cardiovascular disease in these offspring are urgently needed.

14  Experimental observations on perinatal programming 
in offspring of diabetic mothers
Thomas Harder, Leona Aerts, Andreas Plagemann, 
and F. André Van Assche
Since the 1970s, epidemiological and experimental studies provided evidence that expo-
sure to a diabetic intrauterine environment increases the risk of developing overweight and 
diabetes in the offspring. Animal models of diabetes during pregnancy may discover the 
speciﬁ c effects of exposure to a diabetic intrauterine environment, independent of inherited 
trails. First evidence came from animal research in 1979, when it was demonstrated that mild 
diabetes in the pregnant rat induced gestational diabetes in the second generation and, as a 
consequence, macrosomia, increased insulin secretion, and B-cell hyperplasia in the fetuses 
of the third generation. It was postulated that overstimulation of the insulin producing B-cells 
in utero leads to a reduced capacity of insulin secretion in conditions of increased demand 
in later life, such as obesity and pregnancy. Beyond alterations in the periphery, overweight 
and metabolic disturbances in offspring of diabetic rat dams were found to be associated 
with perinatally acquired and persisting malformation of the ventromedial hypothalamic 
nucleus (VMN) and alterations of hypothalamic neurons expressing orexigenic neuropep-
tides like neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus (ARC). We hypoth-
esized that these hypothalamic alterations could at least be coresponsible for increased risk 
of overweight and diabetes in offspring of diabetic rat dams. Consequently, normalization 
of maternal glycemia during pregnancy must be able to prevent this “neuro-endocrine phe-
notype” and its metabolic consequences. Therefore, in a collaborative study we investigated 
the consequences of treatment of maternal diabetes by pancreatic islet transplantation in 
rats for the development of the aforementioned hypothalamic circuits. Our data showed that 
both disorganization of the VMN as well as increased expression of NPY in the ARC can be 
prevented by treatment of maternal hyperglycemia, accompanied by normalization of the 
long-term metabolic risk.
In summary, animal models support the hypothesis that maternal diabetes during pregnancy 
has an independent and long-lasting effect on risk of overweight and diabetes in the offspring. 
Beyond unraveling the biological mechanisms responsible, animal studies demonstrate that 
these alterations are accessible to measures of primary prevention.
14.1 Introduction
Two major pathophysiological paradigms have paved the way toward our current un-
derstanding of perinatal programming. Whereas one of these issues – the relationship 
 between prenatal undernutrition, low birth weight, and later metabolic and cardiovascular 

154    14 Experimental observations on perinatal programming in offspring
diseases – was brought into the focus of the scientiﬁ c community not more than about 
20 years ago, the other paradigm is much older and dates back to the middle of the last 
century. The potential long-term consequences of exposure to a diabetic intrauterine 
environment came into focus relatively soon after the formulation of the hypothesis 
named after J. Pedersen. He proposed that in diabetic pregnancies increased glucose 
passes along its concentration gradient to the fetus, where it leads to macrosomia  due 
to increased fetal pancreatic insulin secretion (Pedersen, Bojsen-Moller, and Poulsen, 
1954), which was shown to go along with pancreatic B-cell hyperplasia  (Van Assche 
and Gepts, 1971). Given these and other pathognomonic short-term consequences of 
maternal diabetes during pregnancy , such as hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and 
shoulder dystocia, the question quickly arose whether the long-term perspective of 
these infants might also be impaired. In this chapter, we give an overview of the results, 
hypotheses, and pathophysiological concepts developed since these days in the ﬁ eld 
of experimental research on perinatal programming in offspring of diabetic mothers  
(ODM), with a particular emphasis on the development of body weight and glucose 
metabolism.
In the ﬁ rst part of this chapter, we brieﬂ y review major epidemiological and clinical 
ﬁ ndings regarding the long-term outcome of ODM. In the second part, we present data 
from experimental approaches on animal (mainly rodent) models of exposure to mater-
nal diabetes and its long-term consequences for the offspring. This second part not only 
provides phenomenological data but also discusses etiological and pathophysiological 
models developed during recent years to explain the epidemiological and experimental 
ﬁ ndings. We conclude with a short summary and an outlook that highlights possible 
directions for future research.
14.2 Epidemiological and clinical studies
14.2.1 Historical notes
Probably the ﬁ rst epidemiological – clinical study that investigated a long-term impact 
of exposure to a diabetic intrauterine environment was published by Farquhar in 1969, 
reporting an increased risk of overweight in these offspring during childhood. These 
observations were conﬁ rmed a few years later by other investigators (Amendt, Michae-
lis, and Hildmann, 1976; Toeller et al., 1981) and were preceded by studies showing 
alterations of insulin secretion in ODM (Dörner et al., 1973). Historically, a second 
line of evidence indicating that maternal diabetes during pregnancy might be a risk 
factor for the later development of diabetes in the offspring came from epidemiological 
studies that investigated patterns of diabetes manifestation within families of patients 
with diabetes. In particular, the pioneering studies by Dörner et al. (1973) revealed that 
there is a signiﬁ cantly higher prevalence of diabetes in the maternal than in the paternal 
ascendance of patients with diabetes, which could later on also be shown to be present 
explicitly in patients having type 1 diabetes  (Dörner, Plagemann, and Reinagel, 1987). 
Particularly regarding type 2 diabetes , more recent studies could clearly conﬁ rm an ag-
gregation of diabetes cases in the maternal ascendance of patients with type 2 diabetes 
(Alcolado and Alcolado, 1991; Riley et al., 1997).

14.2 Epidemiological and clinical studies    155
14.2.2 Contemporary studies
Two more recent epidemiological studies can be regarded as the break-through for the 
public attention on the ﬁ eld of epidemiological research on long-term consequences of 
exposure to maternal diabetes during pregnancy for the offspring. In the ﬁ rst one, Pettitt 
and coworkers (1983) analyzed the prevalences of obesity in 5–19-year-old Pima Indi-
ans depending on whether the mothers of these participants have had type 2 diabetes 
during pregnancy, had no diabetes, or developed diabetes after the index pregnancy. 
This study showed that those offspring who were exposed to diabetes in utero had 
a higher prevalence of obesity  during childhood and adolescence than those whose 
mothers did not have diabetes or developed diabetes only after the index pregnancy. 
Subsequently, the group of Metzger from Chicago (Silverman et al., 1991) reported 
an increased risk of overweight  in a Caucasian population of ODM and showed that 
the degree of fetal hyperinsulinism , measured by amniocentesis, was positively cor-
related to the extent of overweight in the offspring during childhood. Remarkably, the 
same group subsequently published data that provided evidence for a long-term effect 
of adequate treatment of maternal diabetes. This study revealed that ODM who had 
fetal  hyperinsulinism, as an indicator of maternal gestational hyperglycemia, displayed 
higher prevalences of impaired glucose tolerance  (IGT) during adolescence than ODM 
who had normal fetal insulin levels. Moreover, the latter had prevalences of IGT that 
were very similar to those of the control group of offspring of nondiabetic women 
 (Silverman et al., 1995).
Subsequent epidemiological studies also indicated that the risk of overweight and 
IGT in ODM does not depend on the genetic background, that is, it develops indepen-
dent of whether the mother has type 1 diabetes or gestational diabetes (Claussen et al., 
2008; Plagemann et al., 1997a, 1997b; Weiss et al., 2000). Independency of genetic 
factors was further conﬁ rmed by an elegant study performed in the Pima Indian  popula-
tion. Dabelea and coworkers analyzed body weight and prevalence of type 2 diabetes 
in pairs of siblings born to women who had no diabetes during the pregnancy of the 
ﬁ rst sibling but were diabetic during the pregnancy of the second one. Those siblings 
who had been exposed to maternal diabetes in utero had a higher body mass index 
and increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to siblings from the normoglycemic 
pregnancies (Dabelea et al., 2000).
Beyond overweight and impaired glucose metabolism, epidemiological studies also 
provided evidence for an increased cardiovascular risk in ODM, as indicated by in-
creased systolic blood pressure  (Tam et al., 2008) and altered blood lipid proﬁ les (Weiss 
et al., 2000). Furthermore, there are also epidemiological studies indicating that the 
risk of developing type 1 diabetes is increased in offspring of women with gestational 
diabetes (Dörner et al., 1984, 1985, 1987, 2000; for review see Dörner and Plagemann, 
1994). However, impairments in long-term prognosis in ODM are not restricted to over-
weight, diabetes, and cardiometabolic diseases. A number of studies have shown that 
ODM also have, for example, an impaired cognitive (Rizzo et al., 1991; Sells et al., 
1994) and psychomotor development (Rizzo et al., 1995).
Taken together, a huge number of epidemiological and clinical studies performed on 
different geographical, ethnical, and genetic backgrounds strongly suggest that  exposure 
to a diabetic intrauterine environment increases the risk of developing adipogenic, 

156    14 Experimental observations on perinatal programming in offspring
cardiometabolic, and psychological alterations during later life. However, due to the 
observational nature of these studies, confounding and bias cannot be completely ex-
cluded. Animal models may help to clarify the speciﬁ c effects of exposure to maternal 
hyperglycemia and unravel underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.
14.3 Animal studies
14.3.1 Historical notes
The history of animal models  of diabetes during pregnancy goes back, at least, to studies 
using pancreatectomy (Hultquist, 1948) or alloxan (Bartelheimer and Kloos, 1952; Dunn 
and McLetchie, 1943) to induce hyperglycemia in pregnant rats. However, these models 
were complicated by high maternal and fetal mortality, thereby limiting their value for 
studies on long-term effects in the offspring. Therefore, subsequently, the majority of in-
vestigators used streptozotocin  (STZ) to induce diabetes in pregnant rats. STZ induces a 
selective destruction of pancreatic beta-cells (Rakieten, Rakieten, and Nadkarni, 1963), 
leading to a rapid reduction of pancreatic insulin content ( Junod et al., 1969). Rishi, 
Golob, and Becker (1969) were the ﬁ rst to use this substance to experimentally induce 
diabetes in pregnant rats. The biological half-time of STZ lies within some minutes 
(Reynolds et al., 1974), therefore, when given on the day of conception, as it has been 
done by the majority of investigators, a direct effect on the fetus can be excluded.
Application of a single dose of STZ on the day of conception prevents the develop-
ment of the physiological pancreatic beta-cell hypertrophy  in pregnant rat dams (De 
Vlieger, Casteels, and Van Assche, 2008; Van Assche, Gepts, and Aerts, 1980). As in the 
human, increased maternal blood glucose concentrations pass the placenta, following 
the concentration gradient of glucose, and stimulate fetal insulin secretion  (Asplund, 
1973). This leads to a sharp increase in fetal pancreatic insulin concentrations during 
late gestation (De Gasparo and Milner, 1980). Furthermore, this early stimulation of the 
functionally immature beta-cells results in pancreatic islet hypertrophy  (Aerts and Van 
Assche, 1977). However, these effects vary according to the dose of STZ used to induce 
hyperglycemia. Higher doses are known to induce more severe degrees of maternal 
hyperglycemia, which rather lead to decreased fetal pancreatic insulin concentrations 
(Kervran, Guillaume, and Jost, 1978) and increased beta-cell degranulation (Aerts and 
Van Assche, 1977). This also has consequences for the development of macrosomia  in 
the offspring: depending on the severity of maternal gestational hyperglycemia, either 
macrosomia (Eriksson et al., 1980), normal birth weights (Björntorp et al., 1974), or 
even decreased birth weights (Aerts and Van Assche, 1981; Plagemann et al., 1998a) 
were observed in offspring of STZ-diabetic rat dams.
14.3.2  Epigenetic intergenerational transmission of increased diabetes 
and overweight risk due to exposure to maternal diabetes
Already in the very ﬁ rst experiments performed by Bartelheimer and Kloos (1952) it 
was noted that offspring of (alloxan-) diabetic rat dams had increased body weight in 
adulthood. In the same model, Goldner and Spergel (1972) described the develop-
ment of impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia in the adult offspring. In the 

14.3 Animal studies    157
STZ model, Aerts and Van Assche proved in 1979 that exposure to maternal diabetes 
has long-term consequences for glucose homeostasis in the offspring. Moreover, in this 
publication it has been described that the diabetic phenotype is transmitted over more 
than one generation on the maternal side. F1 offspring show impaired glucose toler-
ance, as compared to offspring of control dams. This impaired glucose tolerance  is 
also present during pregnancy, that is, when F1 females are mated to control males 
(XFig. 14.1A; Aerts and Van Assche, 1979; Dörner et al., 1988). Thereby, the F2 off-
spring are again exposed to a hyperglycemic intrauterine environment that is generated 
by their (F1) mothers who spontaneously developed diabetes during pregnancy. As a 
direct consequence of this exposure, the F2 offspring develop perinatal hyperinsulinism  
(XFig. 14.1B). And again, this perinatal hyperinsulinism is followed by impaired glucose

158    14 Experimental observations on perinatal programming in offspring
tolerance in adulthood (XFig. 14.1C; for review, see Dörner and Plagemann, 1994). Re-
markably, such an intergenerational transmission of increased diabetes risk is restricted 
to the maternal line because F2 offspring that resulted from mating male F1 offspring 
of F0 diabetic rat dams with normoglycemic female F1 offspring of control dams have 
normal glucose tolerance (Dörner et al., 1988).
Although Bartelheimer and Kloos (1952) reported an increased body weight in off-
spring of rat dams with experimentally induced diabetes, only a limited number of stud-
ies investigated the development of body weight in these models. Nevertheless, it has 
been shown that offspring of STZ-diabetic rat dams develop overweight  in adulthood, 
resulting at least in part from increased food intake (XFig. 14.2B, C; Plagemann et al., 
1999a). Remarkably, the latter ﬁ nding is supported by epidemiological data showing an 
increased daily caloric intake in infantile and adolescent ODM (Mughal et al., 2010).
Beyond the development of metabolic-syndrome – like symptoms, such as over-
weight and impaired glucose tolerance, offspring of diabetic rat dams also have an 
increased disposition to type 1 diabetes: after application of a single “subdiabetogenic” 
dose of STZ, that is, a dose that does not induce hyperglycemia in control rats, offspring 
of diabetic rat dams show permanently increased basal glucose concentrations, speak-
ing for an increased vulnerability against beta-cell destroying agents (Plagemann et al., 
1992a). This hypothesis of an increased susceptibility to type 1 diabetes  after exposure 
to maternal gestational hyperglycemia is supported by epidemiological studies that, 
on the one hand, found an increased prevalence of gestational diabetes in mothers of 
children with type 1 diabetes (Dörner et al., 1987; see also 2.2) and, on the other hand, 
revealed that macrosomia at birth, being a key feature of ODM, is a risk factor for type 1 
diabetes during childhood (Harder et al., 2009).
Taken together, these data strongly speak for an epigenetic effect transmitted through 
the maternal line and indicate that the observed effects are produced in each generation 
de novo by exposure to a hyperglycemic intrauterine environment, which, itself, is the 
result of a disposition to diabetes, which, in turn, was induced by previous exposure to 
diabetes in utero and so on.

14.3.3 Other animal models
Besides maternal STZ treatment, other models have been developed to induce 
 materno-fetal hyperglycemia and/or perinatal hyperinsulinism in rodents. Bihoreau et al. 
(1986) induced maternal hyperglycemia by glucose infusions in pregnant rats, which 
is known to lead to fetal hyperinsulinism  (Asplund, 1973). A further model used the 
spontaneously hyperglycemic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat  to create a hyperglycemic intra-
uterine environment. To separate the genetic component from the effects of exposure to 
maternal diabetes, these authors performed transfer of blastocysts from the genetically 
inconspicuous background strain into the uterus of GK rat dams (Gill-Randall et al., 
2004). In a number of other studies, fetal or perinatal hyperinsulinism was induced by 
direct application of insulin to the rat fetus or neonate. Such a model of fetal insulin 
application has been described for the ﬁ rst time by Picon (1967). Besides further studies 
that used peripheral exogenous application during fetal (Catlin, Cha, and Oh, 1985) or 
neonatal life (Dörner and Götz, 1972; Plagemann et al., 1992b; Harder et al., 1998), 
intrahypothalamic insulin implantation has been performed to cause a selective intra-
hypothalamic hyperinsulinism during a critical period of the development of central 
nervous structures that are decisively involved in the central nervous regulation of body 
weight and metabolism (Plagemann et al., 1992c; see chapter 14.3.4 below for further 
details). The common phenotypic feature in all of these models is the development of 
overweight and/or diabetogenic alterations in later life, including IGT and alterations 
of insulin secretion like hyperinsulinemia. Moreover, very similar to the STZ-based 
model of gestational diabetes, in models of exogenous perinatal hyperinsulinism  also 
an increased type 1 diabetes susceptibility has been observed (Harder et al., 1999). 
Furthermore, the aforementioned alterations are not restricted to rodent models, as 
demonstrated by Susa and coworkers (1992) in rhesus monkeys , which also develop 
hyperinsulinemia in later life after exposure to fetal hyperinsulinism.
14.3.4 Pathophysiological mechanisms
Two major complexes of pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed to be 
responsible for the increased risk of overweight and diabetogenic alterations in the off-
spring of diabetic rat dams. The ﬁ rst one is related to peripheral mechanisms operating 
at the level of the pancreas and/or the skeletal muscle and liver. It has been proposed 
that, on one hand, exposure to maternal diabetes in utero leads to permanent alterations 
of insulin secretion. On the other hand, maternal diabetes has been suggested to be 
followed by insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and the liver (XFig. 14.3A; for review 
see Aerts, Holemans, and Van Assche, 1990).
Regarding alterations of insulin secretion  during later life, both decreased and in-
creased insulin levels can be observed in offspring of STZ-diabetic rat dams (Aerts and 
Van Assche, 1979; Aerts et al., 1990; Plagemann et al., 1999a). Initially, it was hypothe-
sized that a reduced capacity of insulin secretion in later life might be the consequence 
of hyperactivity of fetal B-cells (for review see Van Assche, Holemans, and Aerts, 2001). 
In this context, in particular in the case of severe maternal diabetes during pregnancy, 
several signs of an altered ultrastructure of pancreatric B-cells , including disorganiza-
tion of mitochondria and of the endoplasmatic reticulum, were observed (XFig. 14.4; 
Aerts and Van Assche, 1977; for review see Aerts and Van Assche, 2006).

14.3 Animal studies    161
Increased insulin secretion in adult life in offspring of STZ-diabetic rat dams might 
have developed in the context of insulin resistance  or might even have been causal for 
the latter. During euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp  experiments, offspring of dia-
betic dams needed lower glucose infusion rates to maintain euglycemia at a given level 
of plasma insulin, speaking for decreased insulin-dependent glucose uptake of skeletal 
muscle. Simultaneously, an impaired insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose 
production was observed in F1 offspring of diabetic rat dams (Holemans, Aerts, and 
Van Assche, 1991). Both the hepatic and the muscular component of insulin resistance 
have been suggested to be involved in the development of diabetogenic disturbances 
in ODM.
The second complex of potential pathophysiological mechanisms is related to the 
hypothalamic control of food intake, body weight, and glucose metabolism. It is long 
known that distinct nuclei in the mediobasal hypothalamus, such as the ventrome-
dial hypothalamic nucleus  (VMN), the lateral hypothalamic area  (LHA), and the 
arcuate hypothalamic nucleus  (ARC), play a decisive role in this context (for review 
see Kalra et al., 1999). In the rat, the critical perinatal developmental period of these 
hypothalamic structures lasts until the end of the third week of postnatal life (Dörner 
and Staudt, 1972; Pozzo-Miller and Aoki, 1992). It has therefore been suggested that 
perinatal hyperinsulinism resulting from exposure to maternal diabetes in utero leads 
to a malorganization and consecutive malfunctioning of such hypothalamic structures, 
thereby resulting in the perinatally acquired disposition to overweight and diabetes 
(XFig. 14.3B; Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; Plagemann, 2005, Plagemann, Harder, 
and Dudenhausen, 2008).
However, a necessary precondition for this hypothesis would be that peripheral 
hyperinsulinism of the fetus of the diabetic dam leads to increased levels of insulin 
within the hypothalamus. In fact, perinatally offspring of STZ-diabetic rat dams show 
not only peripheral hyperinsulinism, as measured by increased plasma insulin, but 
also an increased hypothalamic insulin content (Plagemann et al., 1998b). This central 
nervous hyperinsulinism during a critical window of perinatal development leads to an 
impaired organization of the VMN: studies showed that offspring of diabetic mother 
rats had a permanently decreased neuronal density/neuron number and a diminished 
neuronal size compared to control offspring, thereby showing a kind of hypotrophy and 
hypoplasia of this important satiety center (Plagemann et al., 1999b).
By contrast, the antagonistic LHA was morphologically unaltered (Plagemann et al., 
1999b). These ﬁ ndings led to the conclusion that a perinatally acquired dysbalance be-
tween these two functionally antagonistic centers might contribute to the development 
of overweight  and diabetogenic alterations induced by exposure to maternal diabetes 
in utero. Hypotrophy and hypoplasia of the VMN might result in a diminished function 
of this satiety center, thereby leading to a relative overactivity of the antagonistic LHA, 
which would stimulate appetite and subsequent weight gain as well as pancreatic insu-
lin secretion (XFig. 14.5; Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; Plagemann, 2005; Plagemann 
et al., 2008).
However, the VMN is not the only hypothalamic structure that exhibits signs of mal-
organization and malfunction due to exposure to perinatal hyperinsulinism. During 
recent years, it has become clear that neuropeptides in the ARC play an important role 
in the regulation of food intake, body weight, and metabolism (for review see Kalra 

162    14 Experimental observations on perinatal programming in offspring
et al., 1999). Among them, neuropeptide Y  (NPY) is known to be the most potent orexi-
genic neuropeptide that is regulated via the circulating satiety factors leptin and insulin 
with both of them physiologically suppressing NPY expression. In offspring of diabetic 
rat dams, the expression of NPY in the ARC was found to be permanently increased 
and was positively correlated to increased food intake in adulthood, despite increased 
insulin levels (XFig. 14.2A). These data gave rise to a second pathophysiological con-
cept: perinatal hyperinsulinism  induces a resistance of the NPYergic system against 
the regulatory signals leptin and insulin, which leads to hyperphagia and consecutive 
overweight and its diabetogenic consequences (XFig. 14.6; Plagemann et al., 1998b, 
1999a).
14.3.5 Malprogramming by maternal diabetes during the neonatal period
One important question with regard to the etiopathogenesis of long-term adipogenic and 
metabolic alterations in ODM is whether the impact of exposure to maternal diabetes 
is restricted to the prenatal period, or whether there might be an independent inﬂ uence 
of exposure to breast milk from diabetic mothers in these processes. In fact, results from 
epidemiological studies suggest that neonatal exposure to breast milk from diabetic 
mothers might be coresponsible for the increased risk of obesity  and diabetogenic dis-
turbances observed in the offspring (Buinauskiene, Baliutaviciene, and Zalinkevivius, 
2004; Kerssen et al., 2004; Plagemann et al., 2002). This appears to be biologically 
plausible because breast milk  from mothers with diabetes shows considerable altera-
tions in its composition compared to breast milk from nondiabetic women, such as in-
creased levels of glucose and insulin ( Jovanovic-Peterson et al., 1989; Neubauer, 1990). 
However, these issues are still a matter of intensive debate (Plagemann et al., 2007;

Plagemann and Harder, 2011; Rodekamp et al., 2009) because contrary results also 
have been published (Hummel et al., 2009; Mayer-Davis et al., 2006).
Interestingly, Reifsnyder, Churchill, and Leiter (2000) demonstrated that pups of New 
Zealand obese mice  (a genetic animal model for obesity and type 2 diabetes) suckled 
by their biological (diabetic) mothers became more obese and had higher insulin and 
leptin levels in adulthood than their littermates, who were reared by control dams, 
independent of their genetic background. Given these epidemiological and experi-
mental ﬁ ndings, we hypothesized that the functional and hypothalamic alterations in 
the offspring of diabetic rat dams described previously might partly be a direct con-
sequence of exposure to milk from diabetic rat dams. To investigate this, offspring of 
control rat dams were cross-fostered neonatally onto STZ-diabetic rat dams (CO-GD) 
and compared to their litter mates reared by normoglycemic control dams (CO-CO) 
(Fahrenkrog et al., 2004). At weaning, CO-GD rats showed signs of a structural and 
functional “malprogramming ” of relevant hypothalamic structures. Immunopositivity 
of the main orexigenic neuropeptides NPY  and agouti-related peptide  (AgRP) was in-
creased in the ARC, despite unchanged levels of the regulatory signals insulin and leptin. 
Simultaneously, CO-GD rats displayed decreased immunopositivity of the anorexigenic 
neuropeptide proopiomelanocortin  (POMC) and its post-transcritional cleavage prod-
uct alpha- melanocyte-stimulating hormone  (alpha-MSH). Interestingly, in contrast to 
pups exposed to maternal diabetes prenatally, the structure of the VMN was not altered 
(Fahrenkrog et al., 2004).
Taken together, in the context of the aforementioned epidemiological and clinical 
studies, these animal data speak for an independent effect of exposure to “diabetic” 
breast milk for the development of long-term alterations of body weight and metabolism 
in ODM, which might be the result of a neonatal “malprogramming” of hypothalamic 
regulatory systems.

14.3.6 Prevention of neuroendocrine malprogramming
Given the aforementioned results and conclusions, one might hypothesize that normal-
ization of maternal glycemia during pregnancy must be able to prevent these alterations. 
We tested this hypothesis using a novel model of therapeutic intervention in diabetic 
rat dams. As shown in XFig. 14.7A, on day 15 of gestation diabetic rat dams were ran-
domly assigned to either the treatment group (TxGD) or the placebo group (TsGD). In 
TxGD dams, an intraportal pancreatic islet transplantation  was performed using 2,000 
islets collected from newborn rats, whereas TsGD and CO dams only received a sham 
transplantation. Islet transplantation had a very fast effect on maternal blood glucose

levels: already 24 hours after the operation, blood glucose in islet-transplanted TxGD 
dams was no longer signiﬁ cantly different from blood glucose of CO mothers, whereas 
glucose values were still increased in sham-transplanted TsGD dams (XFig. 14.7A) 
(Franke et al., 2005; Harder et al., 2001, 2003).
In a ﬁ rst experiment it was shown that this treatment regimen in the third trimester 
of pregnancy was able to prevent the development of impaired glucose tolerance  and 
altered insulin secretion in the adult offspring (Aerts and Van Assche, 1992). Subse-
quent studies indicated that this effect might be due to prevention of malorganization  
of hypothalamic nuclei involved in the life-long regulation of body weight and me-
tabolism. As shown in XFig 14.7B, the number of neurons in the VMN  from offspring 
of TxGD dams was not different from those from offspring of CO mother rats, whereas 
in the offspring of TsGD dams a signiﬁ cantly reduced number of VMN neurons was 
observed (Harder et al., 2001, 2003). Simultaneously, the increased orexigenic signal-
ing in the ARC induced by exposure to maternal diabetes also was prevented: offspring 
of TxGD dams did not differ in NPY  expression from CO offspring. By contrast, off-
spring of sham-transplanted TsGD dams had an increased NPY expression in the ARC 
(XFig. 14.7C) (Franke et al., 2005). Thereby, this series of experiments showed that 
malorganization and malprogramming of hypothalamic regulatory structures of body 
weight and metabolism in ODM can be prevented by timely correction of maternal 
hyperglycemia during pregnancy.
14.4 Conclusions and outlook
Taken together, experimental data support the results obtained in various epidemio-
logical studies that exposure to maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy has an inde-
pendent impact on later risk of developing a wide spectrum of alterations, ranging from 
overweight, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and alterations of insulin 
secretion to an increased type-1-diabetes – like beta-cell vulnerability. Remarkably, 
the majority of these alterations were observed not only in one single experimental 
approach, but also in a variety of different animal models of maternal diabetes and 
perinatal hyperinsulinism. The pathophysiological mechanisms elucidated in these 
studies and models include disorganization of pancreatic beta-cell ultrastructure as well 
as malorganization and consecutive malprogramming of hypothalamic structures that 
are decisively involved in the long-term regulation of food intake, body weight, and 
glucose metabolism. Thereby, these data strongly support the importance of detection 
and therapy of all kinds of maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy as preventive 
measures with regard to long-term health of the offspring (XFig. 14.8).
Given this current “state of the art,” the question of future research directions in 
this ﬁ eld arises. One topic will deﬁ nitely relate to the consequences of obesity during 
pregnancy, related or not to the presence of gestational diabetes, as it is also in the focus 
in other chapters of this volume. A further highly promising ﬁ eld for the future relates 
to mitogenic effects of insulin as a possible causal factor for cancer  (Draznin, 2010). 
In this context, one might expect that perinatal hyperinsulinism may put ODM at an 
increased risk of developing various types of cancer (Harder, Plagemann, and Harder, 
2008, 2010; Van Assche, 1997; Van Assche et al., 2010). In fact, meta-analyses have 
shown that fetal macrosomia, as it is pathognomonic for ODM, leads to an increased

risk of breast cancer  (Xue & Michels, 2007), astrocytoma  and medulloblastoma  (Harder 
et al., 2008), neuroblastoma  (Harder et al., 2010), as well as nephroblastoma  (Chu 
et al., 2010). It will be a challenge for the future to use appropriate animal models to 
verify these epidemiological ﬁ ndings and to develop pathophysiological concepts that 
might ultimately lead to the introduction of measures of primary prevention.

15  Prenatal infections and long-term mental outcome: 
Modeling schizophrenia-related dysfunctions 
using the prenatal PolyI:C model in mice
Joram Feldon and Urs Meyer
Based on the epidemiological association between maternal infection during pregnancy and 
enhanced risk of neurodevelopmental brain disorders in the offspring, a number of in-vivo 
models have been established in rats and mice in order to study this link on an experimental 
basis. One such model is based on prenatal exposure to the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-
polyribocytidilic acid (PolyI:C) in mice. This model has proven to be an excellent experimen-
tal tool to study the contribution of immune-mediated neurodevelopmental disturbances to 
complex behavioral and cognitive functions, which are especially known to be disrupted in 
schizophrenia and related psychotic disturbances. Since its initial establishment, the PolyI:C 
model has made a great impact on researchers concentrating on the neurodevelopmental and 
neuroimmunological basis of complex human brain disorders such as schizophrenia, and as 
a consequence, the model now enjoys wide recognition in the international scientiﬁ c com-
munity. In this chapter, we summarize the features and methodology of the prenatal PolyI:C 
model with particular emphasis on its implementation in the mouse species. We highlight 
that the mouse PolyI:C model can successfully examine the inﬂ uence of the precise timing 
of maternal immune activation, the role of pro- and anti-inﬂ ammatory cytokines, and the 
contribution of gene – environment interactions in the association between prenatal immune 
challenge and postnatal brain dysfunctions relevant to schizophrenia. Finally, we discuss 
how the PolyI:C model offers a unique opportunity to study the ontogeny of abnormal brain 
and behavioral functions and establish and evaluate early preventive interventions aiming to 
reduce the risk of long-lasting brain dysfunctions following prenatal exposure to infection.
15.1 Introduction
Disturbances directed at the maternal host during pregnancy can lead to direct physio-
logical changes in the fetal environment and negatively affect the normal course of early 
brain development in the offspring (Rees and Harding, 2004; Rees and Inder, 2005). This 
can have long-lasting consequences for the development of postnatal brain dysfunctions, 
in which the primary cerebral insult or pathological process occurs during early brain 
development long before illness is clinically manifest. One prominent example of such 
neuropathological outcomes is schizophrenia. This disabling brain disorder seems to be 
associated with aberrations in early neurodevelopmental processes caused by a combi-
nation of environmental and genetic factors that predispose the organism to long-lasting 
neuropathology  and psychopathology  (Fatemi and Folsom, 2009; Rapoport et al., 2005).

172    15 Prenatal infections and long-term mental outcome
Converging evidence suggests that maternal infection during pregnancy  is one of the 
relevant environmental factors that can increase the risk of schizophrenia  and related 
disorders in the offspring. Numerous (but not all) retrospective epidemiological studies 
have found a higher risk of schizophrenia in offspring born to mothers with viral or 
bacterial infections during early-to-middle stages of pregnancy (reviewed in Brown, 
2006, 2008; Brown and Susser, 2002; Fatemi, 2005). Importantly, the establishment 
of prospective epidemiological approaches has provided clear serologic evidence for 
at least some of the infectious agents implicated in the prenatal infectious etiology of 
schizophrenia (Brown et al., 2004, 2005, 2009; Mortensen et al., 2007). Moreover, 
some of the reported effects identiﬁ ed by prospective epidemiological approaches ap-
pear to be relatively strong in magnitude (see, e.g., Brown et al., 2001). Even though all 
epidemiological studies are observational in nature (and thus cannot demonstrate cau-
sality), it is possible to comment on causal interferences from recent prospective epide-
miological ﬁ ndings, which demonstrate markedly enhanced risk of schizophrenia and 
related disorders following serologically documented prenatal exposure to infection.
The epidemiological association between maternal infection during pregnancy  and 
enhanced risk of schizophrenia in the offspring is not limited to a single viral or bacte-
rial pathogen. Rather, a multitude of infectious agents is involved in this association, in-
cluding inﬂ uenza (Brown et al., 2004), rubella (Brown et al., 2001), toxoplasma gondii 
(Brown et al., 2005), measles (Torrey, Rawlings, and Waldman, 1988), polio (Suvisaari 
et al., 1999), herpes simplex (Buka et al., 2001), as well as infection with bacterial 
pathogens (Sørensen et al., 2009) and genital and/or reproductive infections (Babulas 
et al., 2006). Considering the wide variety of infectious agents involved, it has been sug-
gested that factors common to the immune response to a multitude of pathogens may 
be the critical mediators of the association between prenatal infection and enhanced 
risk of schizophrenia. As discussed in detail elsewhere (Gilmore and Jarskog, 1997), 
abnormal expression of pro-inﬂ ammatory cytokines and other mediators of inﬂ amma-
tion in the maternal host and eventually in the fetal brain may interfere with normal fetal 
brain development. However, there are several alternative (but not mutually exclusive) 
mechanisms whereby prenatal exposure to infection can bring about changes in brain 
and behavioral development (for a detailed discussion of such alternative mechanisms, 
see Fatemi, 2005; Meyer, Feldon, and Fatemi, 2009; Meyer, Feldon, and Yee, 2009). 
These include infection-induced stimulation of maternal/fetal stress response systems 
(Koenig, Kirkpatrick, and Lee, 2002), placental insufﬁ ciency and maternal/fetal nutri-
tional deprivation (Brown and Susser, 2008; Susser, St Clair, and He, 2008), as well 
as penetration of viral pathogens and/or antibodies to the fetal brain (Aronsson et al., 
2002; Whitley and Stagno, 1997). XFig. 15.1 provides a schematic summary of putative 
neuroimmunological, developmental, and genetic factors involved in the association 
between prenatal exposure to infection and enhanced risk of neurodevelopmental brain 
disorders.
Based on the epidemiological association between maternal infection during preg-
nancy and enhanced risk of schizophrenia in the offspring, a number of in-vivo models 
have been established in rats and mice in order to study this link on experimental grounds 
(Meyer and Feldon, 2010; Meyer, Feldon, and Fatemi, 2009; Meyer, Feldon, and Yee, 
2009). One such model is based on prenatal exposure to the viral mimic polyriboino-
sinic-polyribocytidilic acid (PolyI:C) in mice. This model has proven to be an excellent 
experimental tool to study the contribution of immune-mediated neurodevelopmental

Fig. 15.1: Summary of putative neuroimmunological, developmental, and genetic factors 
involved in the association between prenatal exposure to infection and enhanced risk of 
neurodevelopmental brain disorders. Both the precise timing of maternal infection and the 
genetic background of the maternal host determine the speciﬁ city of the maternal immune 
response to infection, which in turn may signiﬁ cantly inﬂ uence the speciﬁ city of inﬂ ammation-
mediated neurodevelopmental disturbances in the fetus. Genetic abnormalities may directly 
induce mal-neurodevelopment and/or act synergistically with prenatal infection/inﬂ ammation 
to increase the risk of long-lasting alterations in brain and behavioral development. Activation 
of the fetal immune system may also participate in the induction of altered neurodevelopmental 
trajectories; however, this is critically inﬂ uenced by the precise stage of prenatal development. In 
addition to stimulation of immunological factors in the maternal immune system, some infectious 
pathogens may cross the placenta and negatively affect fetal brain development directly upon 
penetration into fetal brain tissue. Furthermore, activation of the maternal immune system induces 
direct physiological changes in the maternal host, including sickness behavior and stress, which 
in turn may result in (temporary) undernutrition of the mother. Together with the maternal and/or 
fetal inﬂ ammatory responses, these additional physiological changes may lead to fetal growth

restriction, obstetric complications, and alterations in postpartum maternal behavior, all of 
which may additionally affect normal fetal and/or neonatal brain development. Disturbances in 
early (prenatal and neonatal) brain development may predispose the offspring to alterations in 
subsequent postnatal brain maturation and may alter the offspring’s sensitivity to environmental 
factors during this period, ﬁ nally cumulating into adult neuropathology and psychopathology. 
In-vivo models of prenatal infection and/or immune activation represent indispensable 
experimental tools to elucidate the relative contribution of these various neuroimmunological, 
developmental, and genetic factors to enhanced risk of neurodevelopmental brain disorders

disturbances to complex behavioral and cognitive functions especially known to be 
disrupted in schizophrenia and related psychotic disturbances. Since its initial establish-
ment, the PolyI:C model of prenatal immune activation has made a great impact on 
researchers concentrating on the neurodevelopmental and neuroimmunological basis 
of complex human brain disorders such as schizophrenia, and as a consequence, the 
model now enjoys wide recognition in the international scientiﬁ c community.
The aim of the present chapter is to summarize the main features of and ﬁ ndings 
from the prenatal PolyI:C model in mice. First, we provide a brief introduction into the 
symptomatology of schizophrenia and discuss experimental approaches that allow the 
assessment of schizophrenia-like behavioral, cognitive, and psychopharmacological 
abnormalities in mice. We then describe the general design of the prenatal PolyI:C 
model in mice, thereby highlighting some relevant methodological considerations. 
Next, we provide an overview of the prenatal PolyI:C-induced brain and behavioral 
pathology and discuss how the long-term consequences of PolyI:C-induced immune 
challenge are critically dependent on the precise prenatal timing as well as on the 
postnatal developmental stage and genetic background of the affected individuals. 
Finally, we demonstrate that the prenatal PolyI:C model in mice offers a unique op-
portunity to study the relative contribution of speciﬁ c neurochemical abnormalities to 
schizophrenia-related brain dysfunctions and to evaluate early preventive interventions 
aiming to reduce the risk of long-lasting brain dysfunctions following prenatal exposure 
to viral-like infection.
15.2 Schizophrenia and animal models
Schizophrenia  is a major form of psychotic disorder that affects approximately 1% of 
the population worldwide (Tamminga and Holcomb, 2005). It is characterized by pro-
found disturbances in mental functions, emotions, and behavior, and it disrupts many 
of the most basic human processes of perception and judgment. Typically, the psychotic 
symptoms in schizophrenia are divided into three main categories: positive, negative, 
and cognitive symptoms (Crow, 1980; Elvevag and Goldberg, 2000; Goldman-Rakic, 
1991, 1994; McGlashan and Fenton, 1992; Nuechterlein and Dawson, 1984). Posi-
tive symptoms refer to features that are normally not present but appear as a result 
of the disease process. These include visual and/or auditory hallucinations, delusions, 

15.2 Schizophrenia and animal models    175
paranoia, and major thought disorders. On the other hand, negative symptoms refer to 
features that are normally present but are reduced or absent as a result of the disease 
process. This symptom category includes social withdrawal, apathy, anhedonia, alogia, 
and behavioral perseveration. Finally, the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia involve 
disturbances in executive functions, working memory impairment, and inability to 
 sustain attention.
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the etiology of schizophrenia involves aber-
rant neurodevelopmental processes in which the primary cerebral insult or pathologi-
cal process occurs during early brain development long before the illness is clinically 
expressed (Fatemi and Folsom, 2009; Rapoport et al., 2005). According to the neurode-
velopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia , an interaction between early neurodevelop-
mental disturbances  and periadolescent brain maturation  seems to be necessary in order 
to trigger the onset of full-blown psychotic behavior, which typically emerges during 
adolescence or early adulthood. However, despite the growing consensus that schizo-
phrenia is a brain disorder, a comprehensive neurobiological account of the disease 
(including the etiology, neuropathology, pathophysiology, psychopharmacology, and 
genetics) remains a considerable challenge to clinicians and scientists alike. Further-
more, the available symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia is only partially success-
ful, and therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is clearly warranted 
(Kapur and Remington, 2001; Tamminga, 1999). Together with direct exploration of 
these issues in human subjects, basic research in animals represents a fruitful approach 
to studying the neurobiological basis of brain and behavioral disturbances relevant to 
schizophrenia in order to establish and evaluate novel pharmacological therapies for 
their treatment. Indeed, the use of animal models allows a stringent experimental con-
trol of subjects in genetically homogenous populations and facilitates the identiﬁ cation 
of neurobiological factors contributing to distinct forms of schizophrenia-related brain 
and behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore, animal models provide indispensable tools 
for testing hypotheses that cannot be directly addressed in human subjects for technical 
and ethical reasons, including the veriﬁ cation of causal relationships in  epidemiological 
studies.
The attempt to model any human psychiatric condition in animals has always been 
met with some skepticism, and schizophrenia is a particularly illustrative case (Boksa, 
2007; Low and Hardy, 2007). The obvious reason for this is that the clinical manifesta-
tion of schizophrenia in humans includes symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, 
and major thought disorders, which are speciﬁ c to humans and impossible to ascertain 
without structured interviews. Hence, it is impossible to mimic a complex human brain 
disorder such as schizophrenia in animals. However, one fruitful experimental approach 
is to focus on individual behavioral, physiological, and neuroanatomical phenotypes 
of the disorder rather than to model the entire syndrome (Arguello and Gogos, 2006; 
Lipska and Weinberger, 2000).
In parallel with similar efforts in humans, behavioral neuroscience and related re-
search ﬁ elds have established a wide variety of sophisticated paradigms that allow the 
assessment of schizophrenia-related traits  in experimental models  and clinical trials. 
Such cross-species translational paradigms have been developed for the identiﬁ cation 
and characterization of neuropsychological, cognitive, and psychopharmacologi-
cal core dysfunctions implicated in human psychotic disorders. XTab. 15.1 provides 
a sample of the most commonly used paradigms for the phenotypic characterization

c Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle reﬂ ex refers to the reduction of startle reaction 
to a startle-eliciting stimulus (pulse) when it is shortly preceded by a weak stimulus (prepulse). It 
is an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that reﬂ ects the ability to ﬁ lter or gate intrusive 
sensory-motor information. 
d Latent inhibition (LI) and Kamin blocking (KB) are forms of selective associative learning con-
sidered to index an organism’s capacity to ignore irrelevant stimuli. LI is usually described as the 
retardation in learning about the signiﬁ cance of a stimulus as a result of its prior nonreinforced 
(nonconsequential) repeated pre-exposures. In associative conditioning, pre-exposure of the to-
be-conditioned stimulus (CS) impedes the subsequent development of the conditioned response 
(CR) following pairings between the same CS and a signiﬁ cant event, the unconditioned stimulus 
(US). KB refers to the impediment of the development and/or expression of a CR when a target 
conditioned stimulus (CS2) is presented as part of a compound that includes another CS (CS1) that 
had been used previously to establish a CR. 
e Sustained attention and vigilance can be assessed using the 5-choice serial reaction time test 
(5-CSRTT), which tests the ability of a subject to sustain spatial attention divided among a number 
of locations over a large number of trials. This capacity is measured by the subject’s accuracy of 
reporting the correct stimuli. 
f Working memory is a special short-term memory buffer with a limited temporal capacity and 
is used to hold relevant information active in order to guide on-going behavior, including com-
prehension, reasoning, and problem solving. Numerous experimental paradigms can be used for 
the assessment of working memory in experimental animals, including the delayed nonmatch to 
sample/position (DNMTS/P) task, the radial arm maze, the Morris watermaze, and the Y-maze. An 
important component of working memory as assessed in these paradigms is the short-term storage 
of trial-unique information, whereby unique information about speciﬁ c stimuli (e.g., spatial loca-
tion and object information) is retained brieﬂ y in a short-term memory buffer and discarded after 
an appropriate response is executed. 
g Executive functions are commonly referred to as a collection of brain processes that are crucial 
for planning, problem solving, maintenance of goal-directed behavior, and behavioral/cognitive

paradigms of intradimensional/extradimensional shifts and discrimination reversal learning. An 
intradimensional shift occurs when the subject is required to cease responding to one feature of a 
particular perceptual dimension (e.g., “red” for the dimension color) and begins responding to a 
new feature of the same dimension (e.g., “blue”). On the other hand, an extradimensional shift oc-
curs when the subject is required to switch responding to a novel feature of a previously irrelevant 
perceptual dimension (e.g., from the color “blue” to “circles” from the dimension “shape”). In 
reversal learning, subjects ﬁ rst learn to respond differentially (typically approaching or avoiding) to 
two stimuli of opposing valence (S1+ vs S2−), and are then confronted with the same two stimuli 
but with the reversed valence (S1− vs S2+). The ability to recognize an unexpected consequence 
from a previously established associative learning rule and then to switch the response  contingency 
accordingly is crucial to reversal learning. 
h Social behavior is commonly referred to as behavior that takes place in a social context and 
results from the interaction between and among individuals (of the same species). Because most 
of the commonly used experimental animals, including rats and mice, are highly social animals, 
social interaction and recognition tests can be efﬁ ciently used to study social behavior under 
experimental conditions. 
i Stereotypy is deﬁ ned as uniform, repetitive, and compulsive actions within a restricted pattern 
that often have no obvious goals or end-points. Stereotype behavior can be assessed using open 
ﬁ eld or holeboard exploration tests, in which persistent repetitions of particular actions can be 
measured by observing the animal’s behavior over a certain period of time. 
j/k One effective and informative way to assess the functional consequences of altered dopa-
mine- and/or glutamate-associated neurotransmission is to measure a subject’s behavioral sensitiv-
ity to acute treatment with dopamine receptor agonists such as amphetamine or NMDA-receptor 
antagonists such as ketamine, dizocilpine (MK-801), and phencyclidine (PCP). This can be coupled 
with in-vivo microdialysis in order to have a parallel measure of extracellular neurotransmitter 
release before, during, and after the drug challenge. Adapted from Meyer and Feldon (2010).

of schizophrenia-related neuropsychological, cognitive, and psychopharmacological 
core dysfunctions in rats and mice. These paradigms have been proven valuable and 
informative experimental tools for assessing psychosis-like traits in a variety of lesion-
based, genetic, or psychopharmacological rodent models  (for a review see Arguello and 
Gogos, 2006; Castner, Goldman-Rakic, and Williams, 2004; Meyer et al., 2005; Swerd-
low and Geyer, 1998; Weiner 2003). It should be emphasized that the collection of 
paradigms summarized in XTab. 15.1 is far from exhaustive. Theoretically, they are also 
not mutually exclusive of each other, even though they have been developed as tests of 
schizophrenia-related dysfunction largely independently of each other. Conversely, the 
neural substrate underlying performances on each of these behavioral, cognitive, and 
psychopharmacological tests share considerable common elements, and their identiﬁ -
cation is particularly crucial to the disease process of schizophrenia. Hence, the power 
of validation is magniﬁ ed many fold when these tests are applied as a battery of tests for 
the phenotypic characterization of functional abnormalities relevant to complex neuro-
psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, especially when the experimental model 
system does not rely on any speciﬁ c presumption of the disorder’s neuronal substrates.
The extent to which it is possible to extrapolate from animal model systems to the 
clinical condition in humans, and consequently the value of the information that may 

15.3 Features and methodology of the mouse prenatal PolyI:C model    179
be derived from animal models, depends on several validity criteria of the model. In 
general, there are three main criteria that should be applied for the validation of an 
animal model (Willner, 1984, 1986):
x  Face validity : This refers to phenomenological and symptomatological similarities 
between the features of the model and the clinical condition. For example, face 
validity reﬂ ects the degree of descriptive similarity between the behavioral abnor-
malities seen in the model system and the human psychopathological condition. 
Face validity also includes the etiological and/or epidemiological signiﬁ cance of 
the experimental manipulation used for the induction of a particular phenotype 
that aims at mimicking the human condition.
x  Construct validity : This refers to the degree of similarity between the mechanisms 
underlying the particular phenotype in the model and that underlying the pheno-
type in the condition that is being modeled. Hence, construct validity accounts 
for mechanistic similarities between the model and the clinical condition. In the 
context of animal models of human brain disorders, construct validity is a theory-
driven, experimental substantiation of the behavioral, pathophysiological, and/or 
neuronal elements of the model. Hence, it reﬂ ects the degree of ﬁ tting of the theo-
retical rationale and of modeling the true nature of the symptoms to be mimicked 
by the animal model.
x  Predictive validity : This implies that the model allows extrapolation of the effect 
of a particular experimental manipulation from one species to another (e.g., from 
rodents to humans) and from one condition to another (e.g., from the preclinical 
model in animals to the clinical condition in humans). A narrower concept of 
predictive validity is used in psychopharmacological contexts. Here, predictive va-
lidity usually implies that pharmacological compounds that are known to inﬂ uence 
a clinical state in humans should have a similar effect in the animal model. Hence, 
this validity criterion refers to the sensitivity of the model system to clinically ef-
fective drugs. As a consequence, pharmacological treatments that precipitate or 
exacerbate a human pathological condition should exert a similar effect on the 
model, whereas those pharmacological treatments relieving the human pathologi-
cal condition should have a similar beneﬁ cial effect on behavioral and/or cognitive 
abnormalities modeled in animals.
It should be emphasized that no animal model is likely to fulﬁ ll all validity criteria at 
the same time. In fact, validity criteria are often restricted to the speciﬁ c purpose of the 
model, and there is no general consensus about how to weigh the different categories 
of validity in the model evaluation process.
15.3 Features and methodology of the mouse prenatal PolyI:C model
In the mouse prenatal PolyI:C model , pregnant dams  are exposed to the viral mimic 
PolyI:C at a speciﬁ c gestational stage, and the brain and behavioral consequences of the 
prenatal immunological manipulation are then compared in the resulting offspring rela-
tive to offspring born to vehicle-treated control mothers. PolyI:C is a commercially avail-
able synthetic analogue of double-stranded RNA. Double-stranded RNA is  generated 
during viral infection  as a replication intermediate for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) or 

180    15 Prenatal infections and long-term mental outcome
as a by-product of symmetrical transcription in DNA viruses. It is recognized as foreign 
by the mammalian immune system  through the transmembrane protein toll-like recep-
tor 3 (TLR3). TLRs are a class of pathogen recognition receptors that recognize invariant 
structures present on and/or associated with virulent pathogens. Upon binding to TLRs, 
double-stranded RNA or its synthetic analogue PolyI:C stimulates the production and 
release of many pro-inﬂ ammatory cytokines , including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α (Meyer et al., 2006b, 2008a). In addition, PolyI:C is a 
potent inducer of the type I interferons IFN-α and IFN-β (Takeuchi and Akira, 2007). 
Administration of PolyI:C can, therefore, efﬁ ciently mimic the acute phase response to 
viral infection.
There are several advantages to using viral-like immunogens such as PolyI:C instead 
of viral pathogens in in-vivo animal models of prenatal immune activation. Firstly, un-
like viral pathogens, PolyI:C can be easily handled without stringent biosafety precau-
tions. Secondly, the intensity of the cytokine-associated immune responses  can be easily 
controlled by appropriate dose-response studies (Cunningham et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 
2005; Shi et al., 2003). Thirdly, PolyI:C-induced immunological challenges in rodents 
are time-limited, ranging from 24 to 48 h depending on the precise dose used (Cunning-
ham et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 2005). This facilitates the precise timing of the maternal 
immune activation corresponding to speciﬁ c periods of fetal development. This aspect 
is particularly relevant when prenatal immune activation models are designed with the 
aim of exploring the impact of the precise timing in the association between prena-
tal immune challenge and postnatal brain dysfunctions. Finally, maternal exposure to 
PolyI:C can alter pro- and anti-inﬂ ammatory cytokine levels in the three relevant com-
partments of the maternal – fetal interface of rodents, namely the placenta, the amniotic 
ﬂ uid, and the fetus, including the fetal brain (Gilmore, Jarskog, and  Vadlamudi, 2005; 
Meyer et al., 2006b, 2008a).
Compared to infection models  using viral pathogens (Fatemi et al., 1999, 2002a, 
2002b, 2008, 2009; Shi et al., 2003), one limitation of the PolyI:C model of immune 
activation is that it does not readily mimic the precise immunological insults occurring 
in the human environment. That is, it falls short in modeling the full spectrum of im-
mune responses normally induced by viral exposure. Rather, it mimics especially the 
cytokine-associated viral-like acute phase responses in the maternal host and, thereafter, 
in the fetal environment. However, this aspect of the PolyI:C-based immune activation 
model is helpful in order to test speciﬁ cally whether imbalances in maternal and/or fetal 
cytokine levels may be one of the crucial mediating factors in the link between maternal 
infection and the emergence of brain and behavioral pathology in the offspring.
Even though the principal design of the prenatal PolyI:C model in mice appears to be 
relatively simple and straightforward, several methodological considerations need to be 
taken into account to guarantee a successful realization. A detailed discussion of these 
considerations can be found elsewhere (see Meyer, Feldon, and Fatemi, 2009). Here, 
we would like to restrict our discussion to one of the most relevant methodological 
considerations, namely the species-speciﬁ c timing of corresponding brain development 
in mice and humans.
Because prenatal development differs essentially between mice and humans, a care-
ful extrapolation of the timing of brain development from mice to humans must be 
taken into account in the design and interpretation of translational neurodevelopmental 
studies. In terms of percentage of gestation and developmental biology, the gestational 

15.4 Schizophrenia-related phenotypes in the mouse prenatal PolyI:C model     181
period in mice would only cover the ﬁ rst and early-to-middle second trimester of 
human pregnancy (Clancy, Darlington, and Finlay, 2001; Clancy et al., 2007a, 2007b; 
Kaufman, 2003). In the mouse species, development corresponding to the third tri-
mester of human pregnancy would already be ex-utero, that is, during the ﬁ rst 10 days 
of postnatal development. One consequence is that in-vivo mouse models can only 
translate into experimental investigations of the long-term brain and behavioral effects 
of prenatal environmental insults during the ﬁ rst and early-to-middle second trimester 
of human pregnancy. Early neonatal immune activation and/or infections would thus be 
needed in experimental mouse (or rat) models in order to explore the long-term neuro-
developmental impact of immunological insults corresponding to late (third trimester) 
gestational infections in humans (see e.g., Hornig et al., 1999; Hornig and Lipkin, 2001; 
Pletnikov et al., 2000, 2002a, 2002b; Pletnikov, Moran, and Carbone, 2002).
It should also be noted that the exact correspondence of fetal developmental progres-
sion can also signiﬁ cantly differ between two closely related species such as rats and 
mice. Indeed, many key events in fetal development occur approximately 2 days later 
in rats as compared to mice (Clancy et al., 2001, 2007a, 2007b). A careful examination 
of the spatiotemporal events in prenatal brain development  across different species is 
therefore indispensable for the delineation of the precise neurodevelopmental impact 
of prenatal environmental insults in humans as well as in rodents. The correspondence 
of fetal developmental progression in different species can be compared using data-
base-driven Web sites. Such programs are based on statistical algorithms that integrate 
hundreds of empirically derived developing neural events in 10 mammalian species, 
including rats, mice, and humans (http://translatingtime.net/; see also Clancy et al., 
2007a, 2007b).
15.4  Schizophrenia-related phenotypes in the mouse 
prenatal PolyI:C model
In the following sections, we review experimental ﬁ ndings derived from the prenatal 
PolyI:C model as applied primarily in the mouse species. Thereby, we focus on func-
tional phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. A detailed 
review of the long-term neuroanatomical and neurochemical consequences of prenatal 
(PolyI:C-induced) immune challenge can be found elsewhere (Meyer and Feldon, 2009, 
2010).
15.4.1 Dose-response studies
Based on the seminal work by Fatemi and colleagues, who studied the brain and be-
havioral consequences of prenatal exposure to human inﬂ uenza  in mice (Fatemi et al., 
1999, 2002a, 2002b, 2008, 2009; Shi et al., 2003), our laboratory established a com-
prehensive dose-response study with the aim of exploring the effects of prenatal PolyI:C-
induced immune challenge at low, middle, or high intensity on schizophrenia-related 
phenotypes in adulthood (Meyer et al., 2005). For this purpose, pregnant mice on gesta-
tion day (GD) 9 were subjected to a single injection of PolyI:C at a dose of 2.5, 5, or 
10 mg / kg (i.v.), or were treated with corresponding vehicle (sterile pyrogen-free  saline 
solution). The selected gestational window (i.e., GD 9) in mice corresponds roughly to 

182    15 Prenatal infections and long-term mental outcome
the middle-to-late ﬁ rst trimester of human pregnancy, with respect to developmental 
biology and comparable percentage of gestation in mice and humans (see previous 
section). Behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacological phenotyping was conducted using 
a variety of paradigms summarized in XTab. 15.1, including assessment of locomotor 
activity  in a novel environment (open ﬁ eld), prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic 
startle reﬂ ex , latent inhibition  (LI), US-pre-exposure effect (USPEE), working memory  in 
the Morris water maze, left – right discrimination reversal learning  in operant chambers, 
and locomotor response to acute treatment with a low dose (2.5 mg / kg, i.p.) of the 
indirect dopamine receptor agonist amphetamine (AMPH).
This initial dose response study conﬁ rmed that maternal immune activation by 
PolyI:C on GD 9 can lead to impairments in multiple neuropsychological, cognitive, 
and pharmacological domains, therefore mimicking a wide spectrum of psychopathol-
ogy seen in schizophrenia patients (Meyer et al., 2005). Notably, some behavioral 
deﬁ cits showed a clear dose-dependent relationship across the three doses of PolyI:C 
examined, whereas some did not. The former includes PPI deﬁ ciency, attenuation of 
the USPEE, and enhanced reaction to systemic AMPH, which all emerged in adult mice 
subjected to prenatal treatment with 5 or 10 mg / kg PolyI:C (i.v.), but not so follow-
ing PolyI:C exposure at a dose of 2.5 mg / kg (i.v.). On the other hand, all three doses 
examined led to the disruption of LI, spatial working memory impairment when the 
demand in temporal retention was high, and reduced spatial exploration as assessed in 
the open ﬁ eld test.
The identiﬁ ed dose-dependent effects of prenatal PolyI:C treatment given via the i.v. 
route are consistent with the dose-dependent nature of PPI disruption emerging follow-
ing prenatal PolyI:C administration on GD 9 using i.p. routes in mice (Shi et al., 2003), 
as well as with the differential efﬁ cacy of PolyI:C treatment at low (~ 1 mg / kg, i.v.) versus 
middle (~ 4 mg / kg, i.v.) intensity to disrupt adult PPI in rats (Fortier, Luheshi, and Boksa, 
2007; Wolff and Bilkey, 2008). Together, the apparent impact of the precise immune 
stimulus intensity in the prenatal PolyI:C model suggests that there is a threshold of 
(viral-like) immune activation that is required to induce long-term brain and behavioral 
pathology in the offspring. The dose-dependent nature of prenatal PolyI:C treatment 
parallels the ﬁ ndings derived from human epidemiological studies, suggesting that 
only a minority of offspring born to an infected mother eventually develop schizophre-
nia (Fatemi, 2005). According to the dose-response ﬁ ndings obtained in the prenatal 
PolyI:C model, maternal (viral-like) infection during pregnancy may enhance the risk of 
schizophrenia in the offspring only if the prenatal infectious process is associated with 
relatively strong immunological reactions in the maternal and/or fetal compartments.
15.4.2 Prenatal time-window studies 
The strength of the association between maternal infection during pregnancy and en-
hanced risk of schizophrenia appears to be critically inﬂ uenced by the precise prenatal 
timing. Many of the initial retrospective epidemiological studies found a signiﬁ cant 
association between maternal viral infection during pregnancy and a higher incidence 
of schizophrenia in the progeny only when the maternal host was infected in the second 
trimester of human pregnancy (e.g., Mednick et al., 1988; Stöber et al., 2002; Wright 
et al., 1995). However, recent ﬁ ndings from epidemiological studies using prospectively 
collected and quantiﬁ able serologic samples indicate that there has been a somewhat 

15.4 Schizophrenia-related phenotypes in the mouse prenatal PolyI:C model     183
excessive emphasis on second trimester infections. For example, there is serologic 
evidence that inﬂ uenza infection in early gestation (i.e., in the ﬁ rst trimester of human 
pregnancy) is associated with the highest risk of schizophrenia in the offspring (Brown 
et al., 2004). This thereby challenges the prevailing view that inﬂ uenza infection during 
the second trimester of pregnancy may confer the maximal risk for the offspring to 
develop schizophrenia and related disorders in adulthood. A similar conclusion can 
be drawn from recent epidemiological studies investigating the effects of maternal ex-
posure to rubella infection (Brown et al., 2001), genital and reproductive infections 
(Babulas et al., 2006), and bacterial infections (Sørensen et al., 2009). The ﬁ ndings from 
these studies all point to more extensive effects on elevating the risk of schizophrenia 
if the maternal host is infected early in pregnancy, that is, from the periconceptional 
period to the end of the ﬁ rst trimester.
It follows that the vulnerability to infection-induced neurodevelopmental abnormali-
ties associated with schizophrenia differs between distinct stages of fetal development. 
However, when comparing the epidemiological data derived from initial retrospective 
and recent prospective studies, it is still debatable whether there is a time window with 
maximal vulnerability in the prenatal infectious etiology of this disorder. Furthermore, 
the relevant neuroimmunological and developmental factors underlying the temporal 
dependency of the link between prenatal infection and risk of schizophrenia remain 
largely unidentiﬁ ed thus far.
Animal models of prenatal immune activation provide a powerful tool to examine 
the critical window hypothesis using prospective factorial research designs. This can be 
achieved by comparing the effects of prenatal immune challenge at distinct gestational 
stages, relative to prenatal control treatment, on the susceptibility to structural and 
functional brain abnormalities in postnatal life. Our laboratory has conducted a series 
of experiments designed to evaluate the inﬂ uence of the timing of maternal PolyI:C-
induced immune challenge on the emergence of brain and behavioral dysfunctions in 
the resulting offspring (Meyer et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2008c). These experiments demon-
strated that the precise time of prenatal immune activation is a critical determinant of 
the speciﬁ city of both the structural and the functional brain abnormalities in later life. 
Indeed, we found that maternal PolyI:C-induced immunological stimulation at different 
gestational times precipitates distinct psychopathological and neuropathological symp-
tom clusters in the offspring. More speciﬁ cally, prenatal PolyI:C treatment (at 5 mg / kg, 
i.v.) on GD 9 leads to a pathological proﬁ le characterized by suppression in exploratory 
behavior , abnormalities in selective associative learning  in the form of LI disruption and 
abolition of the US-pre-exposure effect, impairments in sensorimotor gating in the form 
of reduced PPI, enhanced sensitivity to the indirect dopamine receptor agonist AMPH, 
and deﬁ ciency in spatial working memory  when the demand on temporal retention is 
high. On the other hand, identical PolyI:C treatment on GD 17 leads to a partially over-
lapping symptom proﬁ le involving the emergence of perseverative behavior in the form 
of impaired discrimination reversal learning, deﬁ cits in spatial working memory and 
recognition memory even when the demand on temporal retention is low, potentiated 
response to AMPH and to the noncompetitive N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor 
antagonist dizocilpine (MK-801), as well as abolition of the US-pre-exposure effect. 
Hence, some of the identiﬁ ed pathological traits are clearly restricted to the symptom 
cluster associated with prenatal PolyI:C-induced immune activation in early/middle or 
late gestation (e.g., loss of LI and impairments in reversal learning), whereas others 

184    15 Prenatal infections and long-term mental outcome
are common to both symptom clusters (e.g., potentiation of AMPH sensitivity). Taken 
together, our prenatal time-window studies  in the mouse PolyI:C model indicate that the 
developmental vulnerability of speciﬁ c forms of postnatal brain dysfunction to prenatal 
exposure to immune-challenge varies across different gestational stages: maternal (viral-
like) immune activation in early/middle (GD 9) and late (GD 17) pregnancy can lead to 
divergent behavioral and cognitive dysfunctions in the offspring. A similar conclusion 
can also be derived from analyses at the immunological and neuroanatomical levels (for 
a detailed discussion, see Meyer et al., 2006a, 2006b, 2008c; Meyer, Yee, and Feldon, 
2007; Meyer, Feldon, and Yee, 2009).
Notably, the dissociation between the long-term functional effects of prenatal PolyI:C 
treatment in early/middle (GD 9) and late (GD 17) gestation may be related to differing 
symptom clusters of schizophrenia. It is known that schizophrenia is associated with 
myriad psychological and cognitive abnormalities. Symptoms tend to segregate into 
clusters (e.g., the positive–negative symptoms dichotomy in schizophrenia), which ap-
pear to follow separate developmental courses (Gross, 1997; Murray et al., 1992; Sporn 
et al., 2004). They also respond differentially to distinct classes of pharmacotherapy 
(Maguire, 2002) and are suggested to be associated with dysfunctions localized to 
discrete brain regions (Liddle et al., 1992). Based on genetic and epidemiological evi-
dence the possibility has been suggested that these symptom clusters or even subtypes 
of schizophrenia may correspond to distinct neurodevelopmental disturbances (e.g., 
 Cannon et al., 2003; Stöber et al., 2002).
One hypothesis emerging from our prenatal time-window studies in the mouse 
PolyI:C model postulates that the distinction between early/middle and late pregnancy 
immune challenge may capture the positive–negative dichotomy of schizophrenia 
(Sullivan et al., 2006). Experimental data available so far readily indicate that prenatal 
viral-like immune challenge at early/middle pregnancy in mice leads to a variety of ab-
normalities associated with positive symptoms  of schizophrenia, including increased 
sensitivity to acute dopaminergic stimulation (Meyer et al., 2005, 2008b, 2008c), 
loss of the LI effect (Meyer et al., 2005, 2006a, 2006c), and abnormal sensorimo-
tor gating, which is related to enhanced striatal dopaminergic activity (Meyer et al., 
2005, 2008c; Vuillermot et al., 2010). On the other hand, viral-like immune activa-
tion on late gestation particularly leads to the emergence of behavioral, cognitive, 
and pharmacological dysfunctions associated primarily with (but not limited to) the 
negative symptoms , such as perseverative behavior (Meyer et al., 2006b) and strong 
potentiation of the sensitivity to NMDA-receptor antagonism (Meyer et al., 2008c). A 
follow-up characterization of the long-term consequences of GD 17 PolyI:C exposure 
in mice further supported our hypothesis that late prenatal immune challenge can lead 
to behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities relevant to the negative symptoms of 
schizophrenia. In a recent study, we found that prenatal PolyI:C treatment on GD 17 
led to signiﬁ cant deﬁ cits in social interaction, anhedonic behavior, and alterations in 
the locomotor and stereotyped behavioral responses to acute apomorphine treatment 
in both male and female offspring (Bitanihirwe et al., 2010a, 2010b). In addition, 
male but not female offspring born to immune-challenged mothers displayed behavior/
cognitive inﬂ exibility as indexed by the presence of an abnormally enhanced LI ef-
fect (Bitanihirwe et al., 2010b). Prenatal immune activation in late gestation also led 
to numerous, partly sex-speciﬁ c, changes in basal neurotransmitters levels, including 
reduced dopamine and glutamate contents in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, 

15.4 Schizophrenia-related phenotypes in the mouse prenatal PolyI:C model     185
as well as reduced gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glycine contents in the 
hippocampus  and prefrontal cortex , respectively (Bitanihirwe et al., 2010b). Taken to-
gether, the constellation of behavioral and neurochemical abnormalities that emerges 
following early/middle (GD 9) and late (GD 17) prenatal PolyI:C exposure in mice 
leads us to conclude that these immune-based experimental model systems provide 
powerful neurodevelopmental animal models for the positive and negative/cognitive 
symptoms of schizophrenia, respectively.
Further examination and evaluation of the structural and functional consequences 
of in-utero immune challenge at different times of gestation may provide important 
insight into the fundamental neuroimmunological and neuropathological mecha-
nisms underlying the segregation of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
from a neurodevelopmental point of view. Indeed, animal models are indispensable 
experimental tools in the study of possible causal links between speciﬁ c neuronal 
dysfunctions and distinct forms of abnormal behavior. They are, therefore, valuable 
in the exploration of speciﬁ c brain and behavioral relationships in complex neu-
ropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, which is characterized by multiple 
behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacological pathologies that are likely to involve 
neuronal disturbances beyond one single brain region and neurotransmitter system. 
Importantly, given that prenatal PolyI:C treatment in mice leads, at least in part, to 
differential behavioral and cognitive pathological outcomes depending on the precise 
prenatal timing and immune stimulus speciﬁ city, the mouse PolyI:C model provides 
a unique opportunity to link speciﬁ c neuronal dysfunctions with distinct forms of 
psychosis-related behavior.
15.4.3  Gene-environment and environment-environment 
interaction studies
Maternal infection during pregnancy is relatively common (Laibl and Shefﬁ eld, 2005; 
Longman and Johnson, 2007). Yet, most offspring of mothers exposed to infection 
during pregnancy do not develop severe neurodevelopmental brain disorders such as 
schizophrenia. This suggests that if in-utero exposure to infection plays a role in the eti-
ology of these brain disorders, then it probably does so by interacting with other factors, 
including genetic factors . Therefore, exploring the inﬂ uence of the genetic background 
seems highly relevant in the association between prenatal immune challenge and risk 
of neurodevelopmental disorders.
In the experimental study of such gene – environment interactions , one may ﬁ rst 
consider the examination of genes that are directly involved in innate and acquired 
immunity. Some of the identiﬁ ed genetic risk factors of schizophrenia include promoter 
polymorphisms  of pro-inﬂ ammatory (Boin et al., 2001) and anti-inﬂ ammatory cytokines  
(Chiavetto et al., 2002), as well as human leukocyte antigens and alleles (Wright et al., 
2001). The precise immune-related genetic background of the maternal host may inﬂ u-
ence the liability to certain infections, or result in an excessive or inappropriate inﬂ am-
matory response in the maternal periphery and thereafter in the fetal system. This may 
in turn determine the impact of prenatal infection on early neurodevelopmental pro-
cesses and subsequent brain and behavioral development. We have recently obtained 
direct experimental evidence for this hypothesis by comparing the long-term functional 
consequences of prenatal PolyI:C exposure in wild-type mice and transgenic mice 

186    15 Prenatal infections and long-term mental outcome
constitutively overexpressing the anti-inﬂ ammatory cytokine IL-10  in macrophages. 
The results show that enhanced IL-10-mediated anti-inﬂ ammatory signaling during 
prenatal development is sufﬁ cient to prevent the emergence of multiple behavioral 
and pharmacological abnormalities in the adult offspring after prenatal immune chal-
lenge by PolyI:C (Meyer et al., 2008a). In another study, Smith and colleagues (2007) 
have demonstrated that prenatal PolyI:C treatment is inefﬁ cient in inducing behavioral 
maldevelopment in animals with a genetic deletion of the pro-inﬂ ammatory cytokine 
IL-6  relative to wild-type animals. Hence, recent investigations in mice designed to 
examine immunological gene – environment interactions have successfully shown that 
the association between prenatal immune challenge and emergence of schizophrenia-
like behavioral and pharmacological dysfunctions is critically inﬂ uenced by the anti-
inﬂ ammatory and pro-inﬂ ammatory genetic background of the infected host. These 
initial ﬁ ndings should be extended to the evaluation of other immune-associated ge-
netic risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders (Boin et al., 2001; Chiavetto et al., 
2002; Wright et al., 2001).
An examination of the genes that have been identiﬁ ed as major genetic susceptibil-
ity  factors of neuropsychiatric disorders of neurodevelopmental origin certainly also 
warrants consideration. For schizophrenia, this may include neuregulin-1  (NRG-1), 
catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and/or disrupted in schizophrenia-1  (DISC-1) 
(Harrison and Weinberger, 2005). It is likely that many of these genes as such play 
only minor roles in infectious or inﬂ ammatory processes. Nevertheless, disruption of 
neurodevelopmental mechanisms by abnormal expression of these genes may act syn-
ergistically with prenatal infection/inﬂ ammation to increase the risk of long-lasting neu-
rodevelopmental brain disorders (Ayhan et al., 2009). This scenario would be consistent 
with the hypothesis that the etiopathology of major neuropsychiatric disorders such as 
schizophrenia involves aberrations in neurodevelopmental processes that are caused 
by an interaction between environmental and genetic factors (Tsuang, 2000; van Os, 
Rutten, and Poulton, 2008). Therefore, the inclusion of genes beyond those involved in 
innate and acquired immunity is clearly warranted in experimental investigations of the 
role of gene – environment interactions in the association between prenatal infection 
and postnatal brain dysfunctions (Fatemi et al., 2008).
In addition to gene – environment interaction studies, the mouse prenatal PolyI:C 
model may also be an excellent experimental tool to study interactive effects between 
discreet environmental risk factors  implicated in schizophrenia. Besides prenatal infec-
tion, exposure to stressful situations and/or drugs of abuse during periadolescent matu-
ration have often been discussed as constituting signiﬁ cant postnatal environmental 
factors that can increase the risk and/or facilitate the expression of adult mental illness, 
especially schizophrenia (Corcoran et al., 2003; Henquet et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 
2006). Importantly, the susceptibility to such postnatal environmental insults may be 
critically dependent on preceding vulnerability factors acting during early (fetal and 
early postnatal) brain development. In accordance with a “multiple-hit” hypothesis  of 
mental illness (Keshavan, 1999; Keshavan and Hogarty, 1999), prenatal immune chal-
lenge may thus render the brain more vulnerable to periadolescent exposure to stress 
and/or drugs of abuse, thereby facilitating the development of full-blown brain abnor-
malities relevant to schizophrenia and related disorders. Experiments are currently 
underway in our laboratory to explore these issues directly using the prenatal PolyI:C 
model in mice.

15.4.4 Longitudinal studies
The onset of full-blown psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenia typically occurs 
in adolescence or early adulthood (Rapoport et al., 2005; Tamminga and Holcomb, 
2005). One prevalent hypothesis suggests that this maturational dependency is related 
to the functional maturation of intracortical connectivity, especially within prefrontal – 
temporolimbic cortical pathways (Keshavan and Hogarty, 1999; Weinberger and Lipska, 
1995). Other theoretical accounts of this maturational delay focus on the inﬂ uence of 
(sex-dependent) hormonal reﬁ nements occurring during the periadolescent stage of life 
(Halbreich and Kahn, 2003) and/or interactions with exposure to stressful situations and 
associated changes in the stress-response system (Corcoran et al., 2003; Phillips et al., 
2006).
Given the postpubertal onset of schizophrenia in the human clinical condition, lon-
gitudinal investigations that take into account both pre- and postpubertal stages  of life 
are highly essential in attempts to model schizophrenia-like dysfunctions in animals. 
In many developmental rodent models, postnatal days 28–35 are typically chosen as 
prepubertal stages of development, whereas postnatal day 56 and beyond is typically 
regarded as the postpubertal life span (Koshibu, Levitt, and Ahrens, 2004; Spear, 2000). 
These developmental stages are deﬁ ned based on the gradual attainment of sexual ma-
turity and discontinuities in age-speciﬁ c behavior from younger to older animals (for 
rats see Spear, 2000; for mice see Koshibu et al., 2004).
Consistent with the postpubertal onset of full-blown psychotic behavior in schizophre-
nia, most of the psychosis-related functional brain effects of prenatal PolyI:C-induced 
immune challenge appear to be dependent on postpubertal maturational processes. 
Our own experimental investigations in mice show that various behavioral, cognitive, 
and pharmacological abnormalities induced by prenatal PolyI:C treatment emerge only 
at postpubertal stages of life, not at prepubertal stages (Meyer et al., 2006c, 2008b; 
Vuillermot et al., 2010). For example, prenatal PolyI:C treatment on GD 9 leads to 
signiﬁ cant deﬁ cits in LI and PPI only when the offspring reach early adulthood (post-
natal day 70) but not during their pubertal stages of development (postnatal day 35; 
Meyer et al., 2006c, 2008b; Vuillermot et al., 2010; see also Ozawa et al., 2006). A 
similar conclusion can be drawn from experimental investigations conducted in rats, 
showing that prenatal PolyI:C treatment on GD 15 leads to the postpubertal onset of LI 
disruption (Zuckerman and Weiner, 2003; Zuckerman et al., 2003). This maturational 
delay  is indicative of a progression of pathological symptoms from prepubertal to adult 
life, which is consistent with the postpubertal onset of full-blown psychotic behavior in 
schizophrenia and related disorders (Fatemi and Folsom, 2009; Rapoport et al., 2005).
Against this background, the prenatal PolyI:C model provides a unique opportunity to 
identify the nature and developmental character of progressive brain changes relevant 
to schizophrenia, in general, and to psychosis-related disorders following exposure to 
prenatal and/or perinatal insults, in particular. Given that the PolyI:C model is character-
ized by a high degree of face and construct validity for schizophrenia-like pathologies, 
it is an excellent experimental tool to identify such progressive brain changes relevant 
to the onset of full-blown psychosis. For example, we have recently found a striking 
developmental correspondence between the onset of enhanced striatal dopamine D1 
and D2 receptor expression and abnormalities in the behavioral sensitivity to the mixed 
dopamine D1/D2 receptor apomorphine as well as disruption of PPI in prenatally 

188    15 Prenatal infections and long-term mental outcome
PolyI:C-treated offspring, with both the neuroanatomical and behavioral effects emerg-
ing only in adult but not in peripubertal subjects (Vuillermot et al., 2010). This par-
ticular example demonstrates that the PolyI:C-based model of schizophrenia can be 
successfully used to study the developmental correspondence between speciﬁ c brain 
and behavioral dysfunctions relevant to the onset of the disease in humans.
15.4.5 Symptomatic pharmacological treatment  studies
An important feature of the PolyI:C model is that at least some of the behavioral and 
cognitive deﬁ cits induced by this immune-associated manipulation can be normalized 
by acute and/or chronic antipsychotic drug treatment, thus supporting the predictive 
validity of the model for schizophrenia-like dysfunctions. For example, Ozawa and 
colleagues (2006) have shown in mice that the prenatal PolyI:C-induced deﬁ cits in 
novel object recognition can be ameliorated by chronic treatment with the atypical 
antipsychotic drug clozapine. Similarly, we have recently found that chronic clozapine 
treatment can successfully improve spatial working memory deﬁ cits induced by prena-
tal PolyI:C exposure (Meyer et al., 2010). These beneﬁ cial effects are in accordance with 
numerous other studies conducted in rats or mice showing that schizophrenia-related 
behavioral dysfunctions induced by prenatal treatment with PolyI:C, the bacterial endo-
toxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or human inﬂ uenza virus can be normalized by acute 
treatment with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and/or the typical antipsychotic 
drug haloperidol (Borrell et al., 2002; Romero et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2003; Zuckerman 
and Weiner, 2003; Zuckerman et al., 2003). In addition, we found recent evidence that 
acute adult treatment with preferential dopamine D1 or D2 receptor antagonists is suf-
ﬁ cient to normalize the prenatal PolyI:C-induced PPI deﬁ cits in mice (Vuillermot et al., 
2010), emphasizing a critical role of dopaminergic abnormalities in the association 
between (viral-like) prenatal immune challenge and sensorimotor gating dysfunctions 
in adulthood.
One of the major difﬁ culties in the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia is that treat-
ment with currently available antipsychotic medications can only partially normalize 
psychopathological symptoms (Kapur and Remington 2001; Tamminga, 1999). With 
respect to their treatment, different psychotic symptoms respond differentially to phar-
macotherapy . Hence, there is still a need for the development and evaluation of novel 
compounds with antipsychotic properties that are effective in normalizing especially 
the negative and cognitive aspects of the disorder and that are accompanied by mini-
mal side effects. Based on the solid face and construct validity, the prenatal PolyI:C 
model may be applied as a pharmacological screening test against different aspects of 
schizophrenia-related deﬁ cits. Indeed, the model provides important new avenues for 
the establishment and characterization of novel antipsychotic drugs because it accounts 
for the developmental nature of schizophrenia-like pathology and incorporates the 
etiological signiﬁ cance of the disorder. Furthermore, because the relevant experimental 
manipulation is carried out in prenatal life, the prenatal PolyI:C model is devoid of 
invasive manipulations in the adult animal. It is thus highly suitable for the screen-
ing of antipsychotic drugs in the absence of confounding pharmacological or surgical 
interventions in the adult animal.
Another unique feature of the prenatal PolyI:C model is that the precise timing of the 
speciﬁ c environmental insult determines, at least in part, the speciﬁ city of the brain and 

15.4 Schizophrenia-related phenotypes in the mouse prenatal PolyI:C model     189
behavioral dysfunctions emerging in adulthood (see previous sections). This offers the 
possibility to evaluate a compound’s antipsychotic efﬁ cacy against speciﬁ c symptom 
proﬁ les or clusters. For example, prenatal PolyI:C exposure in early/middle gestation in 
mice may be a useful model to screen pharmacological compounds for their efﬁ cacy to 
correct positive-like symptoms, whereas prenatal PolyI:C exposure in late gestation may 
be a valuable tool to study compounds with potential therapeutic efﬁ cacy to normalize 
negative and cognitive symptoms.
15.4.6 Preventive pharmacological treatment studies
Therapeutic interventions during the offspring’s periadolescent development may rep-
resent an effective strategy to reduce the incidence of, or even prevent the emergence 
of, multiple brain dysfunctions following maternal infection during pregnancy. As 
already mentioned, the full spectrum of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacological 
abnormalities induced by prenatal immune challenge in rats and mice is dependent on 
postpubertal maturational processes and thus only emerges in adult, not prepubertal, 
subjects. This progression of pathological symptoms from periadolescent to adult life is 
remarkably similar to the progression of psychotic symptoms in individuals prodromally 
symptomatic for schizophrenia. The (initial) prodromal phase  of schizophrenia refers 
to a muted form of psychosis-related behavior, which precedes the onset of full-blown 
schizophrenic disorder (Klosterkötter et al., 2001). It has been suggested that early 
pharmacological treatment during the prodromal phase may prevent the subsequent 
emergence of a full-blown psychotic episode by attenuating or even halting the pro-
gression of the underlying pathology (McGlashan, 1996). The underlying rationale is 
primarily based on the hypothesis that the longer a psychotic state is left untreated, the 
more severe the long-term psychopathological outcome is likely to be (Perkins et al., 
2005). For this reason, chronic administration of antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs  
to periadolescent and/or adolescent subjects with prodromal symptoms has recently 
been introduced as preventive treatment of schizophrenia and other psychosis-related 
disorders in humans (Cornblatt et al., 2007; McGlashan et al., 2003, 2006; Woods 
et al., 2003).
In spite of the laudable rationale of this preventive approach, its implementation 
has provoked several ethical concerns and, therefore, still remains highly controversial 
(Haroun et al., 2006). One relative unknown is the conversion rate amongst individu-
als that have been identiﬁ ed as being at high risk for full-blown psychosis. With an 
estimation as low as 16% (Yung et al., 2008), one immediate implication of such pre-
ventive practice is that a substantial number of false-positive subjects (who otherwise 
would not progress into full psychosis) would be exposed to unnecessary antipsychotic 
and/or antidepressant drug treatment (Block, 2006), while the long-term side effects 
of such exposure in these individuals are unknown. Hence, the relative beneﬁ ts (i.e., 
successful prevention) and costs (i.e., long-term side effects in false-positive subjects) of 
preventive pharmacological interventions targeting periadolescent subjects identiﬁ ed 
as being at high risk for schizophrenia in later life must be comprehensively evaluated.
Considering the apparent lack of knowledge about the long-term consequences of 
early preventive pharmacotherapy, along with the ethical concerns and technical dif-
ﬁ culties in addressing these issues in humans, the explorative investigation of early pre-
ventive strategies in preclinical animal models is clearly warranted. Because a deﬁ ned 

190    15 Prenatal infections and long-term mental outcome
experimental manipulation allows the clear segregation of high-risk subjects from 
controls, the efﬁ ciency of preventive pharmacotherapy can be studied without potential 
confounds arising from treatment in false-positive subjects. The prenatal PolyI:C model 
in mice (and rats) is highly suitable for the experimental investigation of preventive 
pharmacological intervention in schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders because 
it mimics brain and behavioral abnormalities related to the full-blown schizophrenia 
phenotype in adult life, it incorporates etiological signiﬁ cance and the neurodevelop-
mental perspective of the disorder, and it captures the pathological progression from 
periadolescence to adulthood.
We have recently used the mouse PolyI:C model to study the efﬁ cacy of preventive 
antipsychotic or antidepressant drug treatment during the prodromal-like phase in the 
prenatal PolyI:C model of immune activation in mice (Meyer et al., 2008d; for a similar 
study in rats, see Piontkewitz, Assaf, and Weiner, 2009). The experimental data show 
that periadolescent treatment with reference antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs 
can successfully block at least some of the psychosis-related behavioral and pharma-
cological abnormalities in subjects predisposed to adult brain pathology by exposure 
to prenatal immune challenge (Meyer et al., 2008d; Piontkewitz et al., 2009). At the 
same time, however, this initial study has revealed numerous negative inﬂ uences of 
the early pharmacological intervention on normal behavioral development in control 
(i.e., “false-positive”) subjects (Meyer et al., 2008d). Hence, the PolyI:C-based prenatal 
immune activation model is sensitive for the detection of both beneﬁ cial and potentially 
harmful effects of chronic periadolescent pharmacological interventions designed for 
the preventive treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, especially schizophrenia.
15.5 Concluding remarks
Over the last two decades, the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia has 
been highly inﬂ uential in shaping our current thinking about modeling the disease in 
animals (Lipska and Weinberger, 2000; Meyer et al., 2005). The use of selective lesions 
in adult animals and the acute or chronic administration of psychotomimetic agents are 
indispensable tools in the elucidation of the contribution of speciﬁ c brain regions or 
neurotransmitters to the genesis of a speciﬁ c symptom or collection of symptoms and 
enjoy some degree of predictive validity, but they may be inaccurate, if not inadequate, 
in capturing the etiological mechanisms or ontology needed for a complete under-
standing of the disease (Lillrank, Lipska, and Weinberger, 1995; Lipska and Weinberger, 
2000; Meyer et al., 2005). This has motivated the establishment of neurodevelopmental 
animal models that aim at identifying the etiological processes whereby the brain, fol-
lowing speciﬁ c triggering events, develops into a “schizophrenia-like brain” over time. 
This approach not only is wider in its scope than conventional lesion and drug models, 
but also readily lends itself to addressing data and hypotheses concerning the subtle 
histopathological and neuroanatomical ﬁ ndings revealed in postmortem and imaging 
studies, as well as the contribution of genetic and environmental risk factors.
As a result of human epidemiological studies, a great deal of interest has been cen-
tered upon the establishment of neurodevelopmental animal models that are based on 
prenatal exposure to infection and/or immune activation. Unique to these models is 
their holistic appreciation of intricate interactions between the immune system and the 

References    191
development of the central nervous system. Besides other currently available models, 
the PolyI:C-based model of immune activation has achieved tremendous impact on 
researchers concentrating on the neurodevelopmental and neuroimmunological basis 
of complex human brain disorders such as schizophrenia. The constellation of the 
identiﬁ ed structural and functional brain abnormalities, and the fact that some of them 
show a developmental delay in their emergence, leads us to conclude that the PolyI:C 
model is a very powerful heuristic environmental – neurodevelopmental animal model 
of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. The heuristic value of this model rests 
on its ability to disrupt the development of the relevant brain circuitry and to mimic the 
diverse spectrum of neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and behavioral abnormalities in 
schizophrenia. Hence, it is characterized by a high level of face and construct validity, 
including intrinsic etiological signiﬁ cance to the disorder. Furthermore, even though the 
full potential of pharmacological screening tests against different aspects of psychotic-
related deﬁ cits awaits further exploration, initial ﬁ ndings suggest the PolyI:C model also 
fulﬁ ls predictive validity for schizophrenia-like pathology.
The epidemiological literature reporting enhanced risk of schizophrenia following 
early-life exposure to environmental insults such as infection is still evolving, and 
so are the attempts to model these associations in experimental animals. As recently 
pointed out by McGrath and Richards (2009), there is a “need to build shared discovery 
platforms that encourage greater cross-fertilization between schizophrenia epidemi-
ology and basic neuroscience research” (579). The establishment and application of 
the mouse (and rat) PolyI:C model represents an important step in this direction. At 
the same time, on-going epidemiological research is beginning to determine whether 
speciﬁ c environmental insults such as prenatal infection may confer vulnerability to 
speciﬁ c features of schizophrenia psychopathology and neuropathology (Brown et al., 
2009). Hence, the continual integration of epidemiological and experimental work will 
signiﬁ cantly further our understanding of the developmental, cellular, and molecular 
mechanisms involved in the precipitation of enhanced risk of schizophrenia follow-
ing early-life exposure to environmental insults and help to establish early preventive 
interventions that can successfully reduce the risk for exposed individuals to develop 
this disabling brain disorder.

16  Prenatal programming of cognition and emotion 
in humans: From birth to age 20
Bea R. H. Van den Bergh
While mediating and moderating factors and the long-lasting effect of exposure to prenatal 
maternal anxiety and stress (PMAS) on offspring behavior and (neuro)physiology are quite 
well-established in animal studies, in humans they are only beginning to be understood. In 
order to gain more insight in mechanisms underlying developmental (re)programming we 
examined emotion as well as cognition at both the behavioral and the (neuro)physiological 
level in the 15- to 20-year-old offspring of a cohort of pregnant women with varying degrees 
of anxiety (n = 86). In the 15-year-old offspring, HPA-axis function was measured through 
establishing a saliva diurnal cortisol proﬁ le, and depressive symptoms were measured with 
the Children’s Depression Inventory. Maternal anxiety at 12–22 weeks of pregnancy was 
in female and male offspring associated with a diurnal cortisol proﬁ le that was attenuated 
due to elevated cortisol secretion in the evening. Moreover, in female adolescents this high-
ﬂ attened cortisol proﬁ le mediated the link between PMAS and depressive symptoms. PMAS 
during week 12–22 of pregnancy was, at age 15 and 17, also associated with ADHD-related 
symptoms, lower intelligence scores, and impairments in endogenous cognitive control (i.e., 
the ability from within one self to control actions, strategies, and thoughts) as measured with 
neuropsychological tasks. Importantly, results of event-related potentials (ERPs) at age 17 
and fMRI at age 20 conﬁ rmed a less optimal endogenous cognitive control function. Our 
results indicate that PMAS enhances neurobiological vulnerability and inﬂ uences cognition 
and emotion, possibly by (re)programming) offspring (neuro)physiology and brain structure – 
function relationships.
16.1  Prenatal maternal anxiety  and stress are associated with less 
favorable developmental outcomes
The developmental programming hypothesis encompasses the role of developmental 
plasticity in response to environmental cues, for example, to early life events. The fetus 
responds to the uterine environment and to changes and disturbance in this environ-
ment, for example, to maternal stress or undernutrition, and to placental dysfunction. 
The physiological and metabolic adaptations that enable the fetus to adapt to altera-
tion in the early life environment may result in a permanent (re)programming of the 
 developmental pattern within key tissues and organ systems (Gluckman et al., 2008).
Experimental animal research starting around 1950 demonstrated that exposure to 
adverse environmental factors in early life has several short- and long-term effects on 
offspring behavior, affects developing brain areas (i.e., the hippocampus, amygdala, 

200     16  Prenatal programming of cognition and emotion in humans
and frontal lobes), and is associated with changes in neuronal circuits that are in-
volved in cognitive and emotional processing and in modulating stress responses 
(De Kloet, Joëls, and Holsboer, 2005; Seckl and Meaney, 2004; Weinstock 2008). In 
humans, since 1990, an increasing number of prospective studies show that expo-
sure to maternal anxiety  or stress during pregnancy  is associated with birth outcome 
and a range of less favorable child neurobehavioral outcomes . Most studies looked 
at emotional and behavioral problems  (i.e., temperamental reactivity, externalizing 
behavior) measured with self-report questionnaires or assessed development with 
behavioral observation scales. A small number of studies examined speciﬁ c aspects 
of cognitive function  and found evidence for reduced attention, lowered IQ scores, 
and lowered linguistic competence. In fact, the pattern of results mirrors the results 
of animal studies, including inconsistent ﬁ ndings that probably result from genetic 
differences; differences in intensity/severity, duration/ chronicity, controllability/cop-
ing, and the developmental timing of prenatal maternal anxiety and stress (PMAS); 
and differences in postnatal environment (e.g., in adversity or in maternal caregiving 
style). In animal studies these variables can be experimentally manipulated, and their 
differential effects were clearly demonstrated (for reviews, see Glover, O’Connor, and 
O’Donnell, 2010; O’Donnell et al., 2009; Van den Bergh et al., 2005b; Weinstock, 
2008) (see XFig. 16.1).
While the mediating and moderating factors mentioned and the long-lasting effect of 
PMAS on offspring are quite well-established in animal studies, in humans they are only 
beginning to be understood. In studies focusing on offspring biological systems possibly 
altered by PMAS, some studies examined hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA)-
axis function; they found evidence for altered basal- or stress-related cortisol secretion 
(e.g., O’Connor et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2005). The few studies that focused on CNS 
structures or structure – function relationships found altered (brainstem) auditory evoked 
related potential (DiPietro et al., 2010; Harvison et al., 2009) and gray matter volume

16.2 PMAS is associated with altered fetal, infant, and child    201
reductions in several parts of the brain, such as the prefrontal and premotor cortex, the 
medial temporal lobe, and the cerebellum (Buss et al., 2010).
Our study was aimed at a better understanding of developmental programming. Start-
ing in 1986, we studied a cohort of pregnant women with varying degrees of anxiety 
from 12–22 weeks of gestation until their offspring were 20 years old. In the next three 
paragraphs we shortly describe the design of the study and the neurobehavioral effects 
of PMAS in the fetus, neonate, and child and continue with effects observed in the 
14- to 17- and the 20-year-old adolescents. We examined the nature of some emotional 
and cognitive sequelae of PMAS at both the behavioral and the (neuro)physiological 
level in the following way:
1.  Emotion- and stress-related emotional problems: to uncover biological mechanisms 
underlying depressed mood we examined whether an offspring’s HPA-axis  activity 
mediates the link between PMAS and offspring depressed mood.
2.  Cognition: to uncover brain – behavior relationships we studied behavioral 
performance (reaction time and errors) on computerized cognitive tasks, and 
we simultaneously examined neural processes in the brain that are active while 
executing the tasks, namely with event-related brain potentials  (ERPs) and 
functional magnetic resonance imaging  (fMRI) measures.
16.2  PMAS is associated with altered fetal, infant, 
and child neurobehavioral development
Using a battery of standardized psychological questionnaires, anxiety and stress were 
measured in pregnant mothers during weeks 12–22, 23–31, and 32–40 of their preg-
nancy (n = 86). The main research variable, anxiety , was measured using the State Trait 
Anxiety Inventory (STAI). We had access to a full range of anxiety scores within our sam-
ple, including 25% women with high anxiety (i.e., mean state anxiety > 45). The same 
questionnaires were also completed by the mother at all postnatal research phases. This 
enabled us to control for the possible inﬂ uence of maternal anxiety in infancy, child-
hood, and adolescence. An important ﬁ nding was that although concurrent maternal 
anxiety had an inﬂ uence on many outcome measures – but not on all, for example, not 
on the fMRI measures – it did not erase the inﬂ uence of PMAS. Moreover, it is important 
to note that most of our ﬁ ndings have been shown to be (statistically) independent of 
potential confounding factors such as smoking and drinking during pregnancy and of 
birth weight.
In a ﬁ rst phase, we combined continuous ultrasound measurements (120 min) of 
body movements, eye movements and heart rhythm; this allowed us to identify be-
havioral states (i.e., sleep – wake cycles). It was shown that the state-dependent motor 
activity was signiﬁ cantly higher, and the percentage of time spent in quite (or deep) 
sleep was signiﬁ cantly lower in fetuses from pregnant women reporting high levels 
of anxiety compared to fetuses from pregnant women reporting low levels of anxiety. 
A mother’s anxiety during pregnancy explained between 10% and 25% of the differ-
ences in irritability, excessive crying, irregularities in biological functions, and (difﬁ cult) 
temperament  in the offspring during the ﬁ rst 7 months after birth. Clinical observations 

202     16  Prenatal programming of cognition and emotion in humans
about the neurological condition, general cognitive and motor development, and feed-
ing behavior revealed no signiﬁ cant differences between infants of high versus low 
anxiety pregnant women (Van den Bergh et al., 1989; Van den Bergh, 1990).
In a second phase the neurobehavioral development  of the 8- or 9-year-old children 
(n = 72; 38 boys) was studied. The most important result showed that signiﬁ cantly more 
behavioral self-regulation problems were reported in children from highly anxious 
mothers (explained variance between 17% and 22%). Scores on clinical scales indi-
cated problem behavior in the home situation and in class (as reported by mother and 
teacher) and during the test situations (as reported by a blind observer). They reﬂ ected 
impaired regulation of emotion and cognition, that is, attention deﬁ cit hyperactivity dis-
order (ADHD) -symptoms, externalizing behavior, and enhanced self-reported  feelings 
of anxiety (Van den Bergh and Marcoen, 2004).
16.3  PMAS is associated with adolescent emotion and HPA 
activity: HPA mediates the link between PMAS 
and adolescent depressed mood
So far our study is the only one that tested whether offspring HPA-axis mediates the 
link between PMAS and offspring emotional problems . It was shown in the 15-year-old 
offspring (n = 58; 29 boys) that (1) in both, boys and girls, PMAS during week 12 to 22 of 
pregnancy is associated with a high, ﬂ attened diurnal cortisol proﬁ le that shows elevated 
cortisol secretion in the evening; and (2) only in girls, there is an effect of PMAS on de-
pressed mood that can be explained, in part, by an effect of a ﬂ attened cortisol  proﬁ le on 
depressed mood (Van den Bergh et al., 2008). These results may indicate that PMAS pre-
natally (re)programs the HPA-axis and induces a vulnerability phenotype in the offspring. 
Although we cannot prove it, resetting of the HPA-axis setpoints by antenatal exposure 
to maternal anxiety during critical periods leading to a hyperactive HPA-axis seems a 
plausible underlying mechanism (De Kloet et al., 2005; Seckl and Meaney, 2004).
However, not only the HPA-axis  is supposed to be (re)programmed by PMAS. Animal 
research has shown that PMAS sequelae are also associated with alterations in neural 
circuits involved in emotional and cognitive processing. From the ﬁ rst month of gesta-
tion brain development proceeds as a continuous dialogue between the genome and 
the environment with the brain architecture of the fetus already established during the 
ﬁ rst two trimesters, and with most sensory organs already functional during the third tri-
mester of pregnancy. Environmental factors that disturb the expression of genes involved 
in cellular proliferation, migration, and differentiation may have an impact on early 
brain development and constrain sensory and cognitive/emotional development even in 
the absence of structural brain alterations (Meaney, 2010; Van den Bergh et al., 2005b).
In the past, neurosciences have focused more on the neural base of cognition (i.e., 
cognitive neuroscience) than on the neural basis of emotion (i.e., affective neurosci-
ence). Several computerized tasks measuring speciﬁ c aspects of cognitive function have 
been developed. The prefrontal cortex is thought to have a central role in cognition, for 
instance, in the control of attention and in executive functions. It is, therefore, of interest 
to determine whether PMAS may affect the development of the PFC and of areas related 
to this region.

16.4 PMAS is associated with adolescent cognition    203
16.4  PMAS is associated with adolescent cognition: Neuropsychological, 
ERP, and fMRI measures reveal evidence for impaired 
endogenous cognitive control
We investigated cognition with IQ tests and with computerized neuropsychological 
tasks at age 15 (n = 64; 33 boys) and 17 (n = 49; 29 boys). Based on the type of problem 
behavior shown to be associated with PMAS in infancy and childhood, three tasks that 
assess different functions closely tied to aspects of self-regulation and that are related to 
the prefrontal cortex were used at age 15: (1) visual attention control and working mem-
ory (Encoding), (2) response control (Stop Task paradigm), and (3) sustained attention 
(Continuous Performance Task; CPT). At the age of 17 the battery of tasks was extended 
to ﬁ ve tasks, tapping ﬁ ve typical prefrontal functions: (1) the ability to orient atten-
tion (Cued Attention), (2) working memory (N-back), (3) external response inhibition 
(Go/NoGo), (4) the ability to perform two tasks simultaneously (Dual Tasks), and (5) the 
ability to switch between response sets (Response Shifting).
A speciﬁ c pattern of cognitive deﬁ cits was shown in adolescents of mothers reporting 
high levels of anxiety during weeks 12–22 of their pregnancy. First, at both ages they 
were impaired in the CPT-task and Response shifting task, requiring the ability endog-
enously (i.e., autonomously, from within oneself and without external sources) to inhibit 
reactions to interfering and distracting stimuli or inhibit a learned response. Second, 
they had lowered scores on Vocabulary and Block Design, two subtests of the Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) at age 15. Third, they showed a de-
crease in performance when the cognitive load of the task was increased (e.g., in Dual 
Tasks) at age 17. Fourth, these adolescents performed adequately in tasks that triggered 
response inhibition in an exogenous manner and in tasks that measure working memory 
(Mennes et al., 2006; Van den Bergh et al., 2005a; Van den Bergh et al., 2006).
During some tasks, ERPs  were measured. ERPs are small changes in the electrical activ-
ity of the brain caused by an internal or external event. Using small electrodes placed on 
the scalp this electrical activity can be measured. When measuring ERPs during cognitive 
tasks, one can make inferences about the cognitive processes underlying the changes 
seen in the electrical currents, and functional signiﬁ cance can be ascribed to the ob-
served waveforms. We recorded ERPs with 19 scalp electrodes during four tasks, includ-
ing a Go/Nogo paradigm assessing exogenous cognitive control and a newly developed 
(sixth) Gambling task requiring high levels of endogenous control. No effects of PMAS 
were observed on the behavioral and ERP data of the Go/Nogo paradigm, but PMAS had 
an effect on the pattern of decision making in the Gambling task. These differences were 
evident both in a less optimal behavioral performance of the high PMAS group and in 
their brain activity. Particularly, the early frontal P2a ERP component measured during 
endogenous cognitive trials was related to the level of PMAS. These results were the ﬁ rst 
to show an actual link between brain activity of the offspring and the level of anxiety 
experienced by their mother during pregnancy (Mennes, 2008; Mennes et al., 2009).
ERPs are measured with millisecond accuracy and have an excellent temporal resolu-
tion regarding the ongoing cognitive processes. To complement the ERP results with 
spatial information about which areas in the prefrontal cortex show differences in func-
tionality related to prenatal maternal anxiety, we assessed endogenous cognitive control 
using fMRI at age 20. During fMRI scans the blood oxygenation level dependent (bold) 

204     16  Prenatal programming of cognition and emotion in humans
response is measured while performing a (cognitive) task; this response can be coupled 
statistically to that performance, actually relating cognitive processes to certain areas 
of the brain. At the age of 20, all 10 boys of the high anxious groups were invited to 
participate, as well as 10 boys matched on IQ of the low-average anxious group (ﬁ nal 
n = 18). In line with previous results of this follow-up study, it was again found that high 
PMAS was related to a less optimal pattern of decision making in the Gambling task and 
to an altered brain activation pattern. The results indicated that areas in the prefrontal 
cortex, such as inferior frontal junction, and areas in middle frontal gyrus were related 
to the level of PMAS (Mennes, 2008).
16.5 Conclusion
While in behavioral studies it is well-established that PMAS is associated with  offspring 
emotional and behavioral problems, our longitudinal study is the ﬁ rst to reveal evi-
dence for (neuro)physiological consequences of PMAS. In our sample the period be-
tween 12 and 22 weeks of pregnancy clearly is the most critical in generating (neuro)
physiological changes and associated unfavorable emotional and cognitive outcome, 
discernible even up to 20 years later. The ﬁ nding of a speciﬁ c time window makes it 
unlikely that the associations found can be explained by genetic mediations only. The 
results in the fetus and neonate show effects that must be independent of postnatal 
experience. The consistency in the results concerning cognitive function as measured 
with different methods from age 14–15 to age 20 is striking and shows the persistence 
of the effect. Although our results corroborate results from numerous preclinical studies, 
they need to be replicated before ﬁ rm conclusions can be drawn. It is plausible that 
physiological events involved in high antenatal maternal anxiety changed gene regula-
tory mechanisms and, hence, the expression of speciﬁ c genes in the placenta or fetus 
(Meaney, 2010). If this were the case, it would underline the importance of PMAS for 
offspring cognition and emotion.

17 Perinatal programming of allergy
Renate L. Bergmann and Karl E. Bergmann
Critical windows in the development of the human immune system may start preconcep-
tionally. In utero, allergen exposure occurs via maternal blood and via amniotic ﬂ uid. IgE 
synthesis was observed at 11 weeks gestation in fetal liver and lung. By 13–14 weeks fetal 
thymocytes respond to most mitogens, and in peripheral blood a response to inhalative and 
food allergens can be demonstrated at around 17 to 18 weeks. The intrauterine environment 
is different in atopic and nonatopic mothers. In addition to genetic factors in the fetus it may 
inﬂ uence the developing immune system. Regulatory T-cells (TReg ) play an important role in 
the fetal and postnatal development of tolerance, especially by the cytokine TGF-ß, which 
induces the development of TReg , and is produced by these cells. The capacity to generate 
TReg cells was impaired in neonates with a family history of allergy. Epigenetic programming 
translates the inﬂ uences of the maternal, fetal, and postnatal environment by imprinting the 
immune system. During pregnancy, maternal stress and smoking, infestation with parasites, 
exposure to farm animals, microbes, and food- and aero-allergens, to vitamins, DHA, anti-
oxidants, and medications have been shown to modulate the long-term immune response in 
the offspring. Likewise, the delivery method as well as the postnatal environment inﬂ uence 
the development of allergies, for example, bacterial colonization, infant diet, and exposure 
to environmental allergens and pollutants. In conclusion, perinatal inﬂ uences imprint long-
term reactivity in peripheral organs and cells, suggesting an effective peripheral programming 
beside that in the central nervous system.
17.1 Allergy and atopy
Allergy  is deﬁ ned by Johansson et al. (2004) as 
a hypersensitivity reaction initiated by speciﬁ c immunological mechanisms. Atopy  is a per-
sonal and/or familial tendency usually in childhood or adolescence, to become sensitized 
and produce antibodies in response to ordinary exposures to allergens , usually proteins. As a 
consequence, these persons can develop typical symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis or 
eczema. Atopy is a clinical deﬁ nition of an IgE-antibody high responder. The term atopy can 
not be used until IgE-sensitization has been documented by IgE antibodies in the serum or by 
a positive skin prick test.
IgE antibodies are part of the humoral system of adaptive immunity. They are secreted 
by B lymphocytes, which, together with the T lymphocytes, belong to the cellular part 
of the adaptive immunity. In collaboration with the innate immunity, also made up by 
humoral and cellular elements, both functions are integrated into the total host defense 

208    17 Perinatal programming of allergy
system (Turvey and Broide, 2010) (XFig. 17.1). Allergic or atopic diseases are complex 
genetic diseases resulting from multiple genetic and interacting environmental factors 
(Holloway, Yang, and Holgate, 2010). Epigenetic regulation is an important mechanism 
for the translation of environmental inﬂ uences on the developing immune system  during 
the perinatal period (Prescott and Clifton, 2009).
17.2 Early development of the immune system 
Critical windows in the development of the human immune system may start even 
preconceptionally, especially for the oocyte (West, 2002). At approximately the seventh 
to eighth week after conception lymphocyte progenitors appear in fetal liver. T-cell 
progenitors begin migration from fetal liver to thymus during the 9th week. Peripheral 
lymphoid tissues are populated by T-cells as early as 10 gestational weeks (Haynes and 
Heinly, 1995). The thymus divides into cortex and medulla, and after 16 weeks the 
orderly development of the thymocytes progresses from cortex toward medulla. The 
T-cell receptors (TCR) and (among others) the coreceptors CD4 and CD8 are expressed 
(corresponding to the major histocompatability complex class I and II antigens [HLA]). 
“Thymic education” of T-lymphocytes  with positive and then negative selection results 
in an export of single positive CD4 and CD8 T-lymphocytes after week 13. By 13–14 
weeks gestation fetal thymocytes respond to most mitogens, and in peripheral blood 
a response to inhalative and food allergens can be demonstrated at around 17 to 18 
weeks gestation ( Jones et al., 1996; Stites, Carr, and Fudenberg, 1974). Most of the stud-
ies have used proliferative assays, but antigen-speciﬁ c cytokine production, although 
poorer than in adults, has also been observed (Tang et al., 1994).
B cells  are abundant in bone marrow at 16–20 weeks of gestation (Holt and Jones, 
2000), but also, the liver is an important site of B-cell differentiation in mammals. 
B cells emerge into the circulation at 12 gestational weeks. Large amounts of IgG and 
IgM are produced by the spleen already at 10 weeks of gestation, but only IgG transverses

the placenta. IgE synthesis was observed at 11 weeks in fetal liver and lung. Neonates 
have low levels of serum IgM, IgA, and IgE, and their IgG is generally of maternal origin. 
Neonatal B cells are mature in their capacity to switch to IgE producing cells if they are 
given IL-4. But the immature T-helper cell function was suggested to be responsible for 
a lack of IL-4 production and, thus, for a low production of IgE (Holt and Jones, 2000).
Allergen exposure in utero could occur via amniotic ﬂ uid and via maternal blood: 
in healthy women undergoing diagnostic amniocentesis at 16–17 weeks gestation the 
house-dust-mite allergen Der p1 was detectable in amniotic ﬂ uid if the concentration 
in the mother’s plasma reached a threshold level (Holloway et al., 2000). With the 
progression of pregnancy a fetus swallows increasing volumes of amniotic ﬂ uid and is 
therefore even orally exposed to an aero-allergen. At term, higher Der p1 concentra-
tions were found in cord blood than in maternal blood, implying that Der p1 can cross 
the placenta  and challenge the fetus (Holloway et al., 2000).
17.3 Physiology and pathophysiology of early immune reactions
The two lymphocyte subpopulations of CD4 cells, namely Th1 and Th2 cells, are the 
source of important cytokines. The functional deviation from naïve Th0 cells into Th1 
and Th2 cells is inﬂ uenced by cytokines produced through the action of the innate 
immune system, involving the cytokines IL-12 and IFN-γ for the acquirement of the Th1 
cell function, and IL-4 for the Th2 cell function (Akira, Takeda, and Kaisho, 2001). Th1 
cells are mainly involved in cellular immune responses. They produce, for example, 
the interleukins IL-2, IL-12, and IFN-γ, while Th2 cells are engaged in the regulation of 
the humoral response and produce, for example, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13.
The Th2 cytokine IL-4 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergy (Mosman 
and Sad, 1996). IL-4 activates B cells to produce IgE, and IFN-γ downregulates this ef-
fect (Tang et al., 1994). The balance of these cytokines during a successful pregnancy is 
shifted toward Th2 activity, which was considered to be important for the protection of 
fetal cells from Th1 cell – mediated destruction (Wegmann et al., 1993). But Th1 activity 
seems to have a role in the promotion of the Th2 response, the regulation of the pla-
centation, and other important processes during pregnancy, therefore the term Th1-Th2 
cooperation seems to be a more appropriate concept than the term Th2 phenomenon 
of pregnancy (Wilczynski, 2005).
Neonates with a familial atopy risk compared to nonatopy-prone neonates showed 
a signiﬁ cantly lower IFN-γ – production upon in vitro stimulation of their cord blood 
mononuclear cells (Rinas, Horneff, and Wahn, 1993). The low IFN-γ production at birth 
was a risk factor for the development of atopic disease during the ﬁ rst year of life (Tang 
et al., 1994). Additionally, to less IFN-γ producing cells a higher percentage of IL-4 pro-
ducing cells was found in the cord blood of newborns who developed atopic dermatitis 
during the ﬁ rst 2 years of life (Herberth et al., 2009). IFN-γ production by pregnant 
women was lower in pregnancy than postpartum, and allergic women had an increased 
propensity to Th2 cell responses and failed to downregulate these responses in the latter 
half of pregnancy compared to nonallergic women (Breckler et al., 2008).
The intrauterine environment is therefore different in atopic and nonatopic mothers. 
Beside genetic factors it may inﬂ uence the developing immune system of the fetus. This 
explanation is supported by the observations that an early onset atopy is much more 

210    17 Perinatal programming of allergy
common in infants born to mothers with atopic disease than those born to fathers with 
atopic disease  (Moffat and Cookson, 1998; Warner et al., 2000).
17.4 Regulatory T cells
The adaptive immune system in the fetus has been regarded as functionally immature 
(see previous discussion). However, this has been challenged by the observation that 
regulatory Th cells (TReg), which are present at high frequency in fetal lymphoid tissue, 
actively suppress T cell proliferation and cytokine production in utero (Michaelsson 
et al., 2006). In the thymus of infants and adults, only a small number of Th cells are 
regulatory, recognized by the expression of their intracellular marker FOXP3, a nuclear 
transcription factor. In contrast, in the fetal lymph nodes and spleen, where mature 
T cells encounter antigen, 20%–25% of Th cells were TReg (Mold et al., 2008).
Substantial numbers of maternal cells cross the placenta to reside in fetal lymph 
nodes and induce the development of TReg cells, that suppress fetal antimaternal im-
munity and persist at least until early adulthood in the offspring (Mold et al., 2008). Fetal 
tolerance to maternal alloantigens can probably be used as a model for the response of 
the fetal immune system to other antigens encountered in utero, inducing, for example, 
a speciﬁ c tolerance to food antigens. In cord blood of atopic mothers TReg cell numbers, 
expression, and function were impaired (Schaub et al., 2008). TReg cells were generated 
when cord blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with a food antigen in the pres-
ence of a lipopolysaccharide , which is recognized by toll-like receptors (TLR) of the 
innate immune system and supports the induction of an adaptive immune response. 
Maternal farm exposure increased cord blood TReg cell numbers and decreased Th2 
cytokine levels (Schaub et al., 2009). An upregulation of genes of TLR2 and TLR4 of 
the innate immune system was still observed at school age when mothers had been 
exposed to stables during pregnancy (Ege et al., 2006). The capacity to generate TReg 
cells was impaired in neonates with a family history of allergy (Haddeland et al., 2005). 
Maternal smoking during pregnancy also inhibited neonatal immune responses to a 
variety of TLR ligands with the effect that the maturation of antigen presenting cells  and 
TReg cells was delayed (Noakes et al., 2006).
17.5 The role of mucosal surfaces 
Immune responses at mucosal surfaces are important in the development of allergy. The 
skin and gastrointestinal tract seem to be structurally mature already before birth, while 
the respiratory tract lags behind (Holt and Jones, 2000). Undamaged skin and mucosal 
membranes in the newborn and their secretions form an important mechanical defense 
against microbes. At delivery the sterile neonate meets microbes in the birth canal fol-
lowed by a more pronounced exposure to the microﬂ ora of the mother’s gut next to her 
anus. The mother’s gut microﬂ ora consists nearly completely of anaerobic bacteria of 
very low virulence (Hanson and Silverdahl, 2009). This supports the establishment of a 
normal commensal microﬂ ora in the newborn, which protects from colonization with 
pathogenic microbes on mucosal surfaces of the gut and the respiratory tract, building 
up mucosal immunity in the newborn. At 1 month of age almost all newborns are 

17.7 Murine models    211
colonized with anaerobic biﬁ dobacteria, which outnumber all other bacteria (Penders 
et al., 2006), but a delayed fecal colonization and a disturbed gut microﬂ ora up to 
6 months was observed in infants born by cesarean compared to vaginal deliveries 
(Grölund et al., 1999).
17.6 The role of early tolerance induction
Beside IgG antibodies that are transferred to the fetus via the placenta, breast-fed infants 
beneﬁ t from a high load of maternal SIgA via breast milk , antibodies directed against 
the mother’s microﬂ ora and her surrounding and not producing an inﬂ ammatory re-
sponse (Hanson and Silverdal, 2009). For the production of SIgA in the mother and 
in the developing infant intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) retain small numbers of live 
commensals for several days, which allows DCs to selectively induce IgA production 
(Mcpherson and Uhr, 2004). DCs may also play an important role in induction of tol-
erance, predominantly by induction of TReg cells (Frick, Grünebach, and Autenrieth, 
2010). When human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cocultivated in 
vitro with different (probiotic) lactic acid bacteria (e.g., biﬁ dobacterium lactis), it could 
be shown that they can induce TReg cells, but some strains are potent inducers, while 
others are not (De Roock et al., 2010). TReg cells employ a broad range of suppressor 
factors, such as IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-ß, which play an important 
role in maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and tolerance induction (Palomares et al., 
2010; Penttila, 2010). Two of the main functions of the TGF-ß-isoforms in the immune 
system are to promote and maintain tolerance to self, food, and environmental antigens 
and inhibit  inﬂ ammatory responses (Penttila, 2010).
17.7 Murine models
In lactating mice it could be demonstrated that even an airborn allergen was efﬁ ciently 
transferred from the mother to the newborn through milk and that tolerance induction 
did not require the transfer of immunoglobulins (Verhasselt et al., 2008). Rather, breast-
feeding -induced tolerance relied on the presence of TGF-ß during lactation and on breast 
milk – mediated transfer of an antigen leading to antigen-speciﬁ c protection from allergic 
airway disease (Verhasselt et al., 2008). The dietary antigen in the milk of antigen-exposed 
mice was in the same range as that of antigens in human milk, that is, 180 μg/l.
But maternal tolerance against ovalbumin by oral antigen could be induced by 
application already in the last trimester of pregnancy, or even before pregnancy, and 
it was transferred from the mother to the offspring and protected them against the 
development of an asthma-like phenotype (Polte and Hansen, 2008; Polte, Henning, 
and Hansen, 2008). Prenatally initiated and postnatally sustained LPS exposure pre-
vented allergen sensitization in offspring through an inhibition of the Th2 response 
(Gerhold et al., 2006). Prenatal stress not only reduced the corticotrophin-releasing 
hormone expression in the paraventricular nucleus of adult offspring, but triggered a 
higher Th2 response and higher IgE-levels in the offspring (Pincus-Knackstedt et al., 
2006).

212    17 Perinatal programming of allergy
17.8 Human milk
Antigen concentrations in human milk  of mothers vary considerably, and this is only 
partly explained by the atopic status of the mother, the infant, or the amount of aller-
genic food consumed (Palmer and Makrides, 2006). Additionally, it is well recognized 
that milk-allergic infants can have IgE mediated allergic symptoms to human milk due 
to cross sensitization or to genuine sensitization to human milk (Schulmeister et al., 
2007). Other breast milk constituents could also play a role in the development of 
atopic symptoms. Breast milk from atopic mothers and breast milk given to atopic 
infants differed in the concentration of several ingredients, for example, fatty acids, cy-
tokines, cow’s milk – speciﬁ c IgA antibodies, and TGF-ß (Böttcher et al., 2000; Duchen, 
Yu, and Björkstén, 1998; Järvinen et al., 2000; Österlund et al., 2004; Rothenbacher 
et al., 2005; Sidor et al., 2008).
17.9 Empirical results
The results of empirical studies support some of the discoveries in basic science and 
the pathophysiological ﬁ ndings, but in observational studies it is difﬁ cult to isolate the 
effect of a single risk factor among other factors inﬂ uencing the outcome positively 
or negatively. Therefore, even despite statistical control for cofactors, studies often  
produced conﬂ icting results.
Farmers’ children in New Zealand aged 5–17 years had a lower prevalence of asthma 
and eczema than rural reference children (Douwes et al., 2008). Dose – response as-
sociations were demonstrated for maternal exposure to farm animals and grain or hay 
products during pregnancy and reduced rates of hay fever and eczema in their chil-
dren. The risk for asthma was also signiﬁ cantly reduced, although it did not show a 
clear dose – response association. The strongest effect was observed for those children 
whose mothers had frequent exposure to farm animals during pregnancy and who were 
 currently exposed.
In a longitudinal study in the United States it was observed that in the ﬁ rst 9 years 
children from allergic families had a higher risk for sensitization and allergic rhinitis if 
they had been delivered by cesarean section compared to vaginal birth (Pistiner et al., 
2008). Repeat cesarean augmented the risk for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis but also for 
asthma in a large retrospective analysis of schoolchildren in the United States (Renz-
Polster et al., 2005). Growth of pathogenic bacteria in amniotic ﬂ uid samples or swabs 
during a cesarean delivery were risk factors for asthma up to the age of 17 years (Keski-
Nisula et al., 2009). In contrast, helminth infections of pregnant women in Uganda 
decreased the risk for atopic eczema in their children signiﬁ cantly, but Albendazol 
treatment resulted in higher eczema risk than placebo (Elliott et al., 2005).
Maternal smoking in pregnancy increased the risk of early wheezing (Lannerö et al., 
2006). In the longitudinal cohort study MAS-90 in Germany, maternal smoking in preg-
nancy  increased the odds for sensitization during the ﬁ rst 10 years twofold when chil-
dren had one allergic parent and ﬁ ve-fold when both parents were allergic (Keil et al., 
2009). In a randomized trial a high ﬁ sh oil supplement in late pregnancy compared to 
olive oil signiﬁ cantly reduced the hazard rate of asthma up to 19 years of age (Olsen 
et al., 2008). This ﬁ nding is supported by a German cohort study, observing a lower 

17.9 Empirical results    213
odds ratio for eczema in infants whose mothers had a high ﬁ sh intake in the last weeks 
before delivery (Sausenthaler et al., 2007).
A meta-analysis of trials on maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy 
does not suggest a protective effect of antigen avoidance on the incidence of atopic 
eczema during the ﬁ rst 18 months of life (Kramer and Kakuma, 2006). Preliminary 
studies observed an association between gastric acid suppression during pregnancy 
and childhood asthma, a protective effect of a dietary antioxidant on early wheezing, or 
associations between anxiety during pregnancy and asthma in the child (Cookson et al., 
2009; Dehlink et al., 2009; Litonjua et al., 2006). These observations are not easily 
explained by an inﬂ uence of the speciﬁ ed risk factors on the immune development of 
the fetus. The same might be true for the inﬂ uence of prematurity or of low birth weight: 
even after adjusting for smoking in pregnancy, gestational age, and familial and other 
confounders, the risk of low birth weight  increased the asthma risk at school-age in a 
Swedish cohort of twins and within monocygotic twin pairs, probably by programming 
lung development (Örtquist et al., 2009). However, in a large population-based study in 
Alaska, preterm birth  rather than intrauterine growth restriction had a higher impact for 
the asthma risk in the ﬁ rst 10 years (Gessner and Chimonas, 2007).
The “golden jubilee of controversy” on the protective role of breast-feeding against 
atopic diseases was acclaimed already in 1988 (Kramer, 1988), but the controversy still 
exists if the duration of any or of exclusive breast-feeding inﬂ uences the development 
of atopic diseases. Even the best statistical adjustment for covariates, for example, for 
atopic family history, cannot exclude “reverse causality” related to exclusive breast-
feeding and delayed introduction of other foods in infants with early symptoms of food 
allergy (Bergmann et al., 2002; Lowe et al. 2006).
The only randomized trial ever done in the area of human lactation is the PRO-
BIT study , which studied 17,046 healthy breast-fed infants in 31 maternity hospitals/
policlinics in Belarus, born in 1996–1997, which led to a large increase in exclusive 
breast-feeding at 3 months (44.3% vs 6.4%; p < 0.001) and a signiﬁ cantly higher preva-
lence of any breast-feeding up to and including 12 months. At the age of 6½ years, 
the experimental group had no reduction in risks of allergic symptoms or diagnoses or 
positive skin prick tests (Kramer et al., 2007).
Hypoallergenic formulas compared to conventional formulas given to infants from 
atopic families after weaning might offer some protection from allergic disease at least 
during the ﬁ rst years of life (Kneepkens and Brand, 2010; Szajewska and Horvath, 
2010).
Probiotics  during pregnancy, lactation, and early in infancy did not reduce the 
incidence of allergic rhinitis or asthma during childhood. A preventive effect on the 
development of atopic dermatitis could only be shown in some Finnish studies, so far 
(Kopp and Salfeld, 2009).
The timely introduction of complementary foods seems to play a role in tolerance 
induction. For instance, the prevalence of peanut allergy was 10 times higher in Jewish 
schoolchildren in the United Kingdom compared to those in Israel, although peanut is 
introduced earlier and is eaten more frequently and in larger quantities in Israeli than in 
UK infants after the ﬁ rst months of life (du Toit et al., 2008). A Swedish study found that 
the introduction of ﬁ sh before the age of 9 months was associated with a lower risk of 
eczema (Alm et al., 2009).

214    17 Perinatal programming of allergy
In recent years the advice on the introduction of complementary food was changed 
by many academic societies (ESPGHAN, et al., 2008; Greer et al., 2008; Höst et al., 
2008) and by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA, 2009). They all agree that 
there is no convincing scientiﬁ c evidence that avoidance or delayed introduction of 
potentially allergenic foods after the ﬁ rst 4–6 months of life reduces allergies in infants 
considered at increased risk for the development of allergy or in those not considered 
to be at increased risk. An Australian group even suggests that there is a window of 
tolerance from 3–4 months until 6–7 months (Prescott el al., 2008).
An overview of the perinatal risk factors is given in XFig. 17.2.
17.10 DNA methylation  and demethylation
FOXP3 gene appears to function as the master regulator in the development and func-
tion of regulatory T cells. RUNX transcription factors are a molecular link in TGF-ß 
induced FOXP3 gene expression (Klunker et al., 2009): because DNA methylation is 
a biologically and chemically stable epigenetic modiﬁ cation, locking long-term gene 
expression patterns, demethylation within the FOXP3 gene is used as a very speciﬁ c 
marker for natural TReg cells (Wieczorek et al., 2009). In vitro hypomethylation  induces 
FOXP3 expression and skewing toward a Th1 response, increasing the population of 
Treg cells (Kim and Leonard, 2007). In mice an in utero exposure to a diet rich in methyl 
donors (compared to a diet containing methyldonors, e.g., folic acid, in an amount suf-
ﬁ cient to prevent malformation) enhanced the severity of allergic airway disease in their 
offspring, and this predisposition appeared to be partially transmitted to subsequent 
generations (Hollingsworth et al., 2008). Methylation studies identiﬁ ed speciﬁ c genes, 
including RUNX3, that may play a fundamental role in the development and severity 
of this condition. In an Australian prospective birth cohort study folic acid taken in

supplement form in late pregnancy was associated with a small but signiﬁ cant increase 
in childhood asthma (RR 1.26) at 3.5 years (Whitrow et al., 2009). This is in line with the 
observation that FOX3 demethylation was increased in offspring of mothers with farm 
exposure (Schaub et al., 2009).
The proposed concept of a “maternally induced immunological imprinting phase à la 
Konrad Lorenz” seems to take shape (Lemke and Lange, 1999).

18  Perinatal origin of testicular germ cell cancer : 
Possible involvement of developmental 
reprogramming
Kristian Almstrup, Ewa Rajpert-De Meyts, and Niels E. 
Skakkebæk
Testicular dysgenesis syndrome is manifested as poor semen quality, undescended testes, 
hypospadias, or testicular germ cell cancer. The current hypothesis on the pathogenic events 
leading to testicular dysgenesis involves improper development of somatic nurse cells and 
consequently delayed germ cell development. Most evidence comes from testicular germ 
cell cancer, which is the most common cancer in young men. It develops through a pre-
invasive carcinoma in situ (CIS) stage. Much data indicate that the CIS cell is a neoplastic 
and pluripotent counterpart of a primordial germ cell (PGC) or gonocyte that has failed to 
differentiate. During their development both PGC and gonocytes undergo extensive epigen-
etic modiﬁ cations, including erasure and reestablishment of genome-wide DNA methylation 
and exchange of histone modiﬁ cations. This chapter reviews the current knowledge on the 
perinatal reprogramming of fetal germ cells and its possible involvement in testicular cancer 
pathogenesis.
18.1 Introduction
Testicular cancer  is today the most frequent cancer among young males and accounts 
for approximately 1% of all cancers in men. Worldwide, testicular cancer has more 
than doubled in the last 40 years, but the incidence varies considerably in different 
geographical areas and also between ethnic groups (Huyghe, Matsuda, and Thonneau, 
2003). Testicular cancer is 4.5 times more common among white men than black men 
in the United States (Moul et al., 1994) and twice more frequent in Denmark than Swe-
den (Chia et al., 2010). Interestingly, analysis of incidence rates in second-generation 
immigrants to Sweden has revealed that these acquire the Swedish risk irrespectively 
of the parental geographical origin (Hemminki and Li, 2002a, 2002b; Hemminki, Li, 
and Czene, 2002), indicating that the place of birth determines the risk. Clinical risk 
factors include male infertility  (RR = 3) (Mancini et al., 2007; Walsh et al., 2009) and 
a history of cryptorchidism (RR = 2–8) (Dieckmann and Pichlmeier, 2004; Wood and 
Elder, 2009).
Despite the observed increase in incidence, there has been a dramatic decrease in 
mortality as a result of new and effective treatments regimes. In particular cis-platin 
based therapies have proven effective (Einhorn, 2002; Peckham et al., 1983).  Testicular 
cancer nevertheless causes a signiﬁ cant amount of posttreatment complications as 

220    18 Perinatal origin of testicular germ cell cancer
survivors have a 2-fold higher standardized mortality rate (Fosså et al., 2004), a 2-fold 
higher risk of developing a secondary tumor, and up to 10-times increased risk of 
 developing metabolic syndrome (Feldman et al., 2008).
The vast majority of human testicular tumors are derived from germ cells. Testicular 
cancer manifests either as a seminoma  or nonseminoma , which are very different tu-
mors, both in terms of histology and treatment regimes. Seminoma is a homogeneous 
tumor composed of mitotically dividing germ cells, whereas nonseminomas are het-
erogeneous tumors that may contain varying proportions of undifferentiated embryonal 
carcinoma, partially differentiated somatic tissues (teratoma), and extra-embryonic ele-
ments, such as choriocarcinoma and yolk sac tumor (Ulbright, Amin, and Young, 1999). 
Both of these very different tumor types are preceded by a symptomless preinvasive 
stage, where the common precursor cell of germ cell tumors, the carcinoma in situ 
(CIS) cell (Skakkebaek, 1972), can be found in usually normally arranged seminiferous 
tubules (XFig. 18.1). CIS is also known as intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassiﬁ ed 
(ITGCN) or testicular intraepithelial neoplasia (TIN).
According to our hypothesis, understimulation or disarrangement of germ cells (pri-
mordial germ cells or gonocytes) during early development is a key event leading to 
disorders of germ cell differentiation. CIS cells, in similarity to early fetal germ cells, 
retain a high expression of pluripotency genes (Almstrup et al., 2004), and hormonal 
stimulation of these cells in pubertal testis is thought to increase proliferation and at 
some point triggers a malignant phenotype. During early fetal development migrating 
primordial germ cells as well as gonocytes undergo extensive epigenetic modiﬁ cations, 
which include erasure and reestablishment of genome-wide DNA methylation  and 
exchange of histone modiﬁ cations. These sequential epigenetic modiﬁ cations seem to 
be a prerequisite of normal germ cell development. This chapter focuses on the current 
knowledge on the early perinatal reprogramming of germ cells and possible  implications 
in testicular cancer pathogenesis.

AP-2γ (TFAP2C). AP-2γ is almost exclusively found in fetal and cancerous cells (Hoei-Hansen 
et al., 2004). On the left are tubules containing CIS cells (AP-2γ positive, dark), and on the right 
a tubule with normal spermatogenesis is shown. Bar represents 50 microns.

18.3 Testicular dysgenesis    221
18.2 Carcinoma in situ testis 
Carcinoma in situ was ﬁ rst described in 1972 (Skakkebaek, 1972) and already a few 
years later, morphological studies indicated that the CIS cell was very similar to fetal 
germ cells (Albrechtsen et al., 1982; Nielsen, Nielsen, and Skakkebaek, 1974; Skak-
kebaek et al., 1987). Comparative studies of protein markers (reviewed in Rajpert-De 
Meyts et al., 2003) and global gene expression proﬁ les of CIS cells (Almstrup et al., 
2004, 2007; Sonne et al., 2009) later substantiated that indeed CIS cells are very similar 
to gonocytes. Most likely the CIS cell in fact is a gonocyte, which failed to mature during 
perinatal development and later underwent malignant transformation. Further trans-
formation of CIS cells, however, most likely occurs during adaptation to the changed 
endocrine environment of the peri- and postpubertal testis. CIS cells undergo poly-
ploidization (Oosterhuis et al., 1989) and acquire a characteristic pattern of genomic 
aberrations, including gain of chromosome 12p (Ottesen et al., 2003; Rosenberg et al., 
2000), often seen as the isochromosome 12p (Atkin and Baker, 1982). Interestingly, 
embryonic stem cell lineages apparently gain chromosomal ampliﬁ cations in similar 
areas upon prolonged culturing, suggesting that chromosomal gains in these areas lead 
to survival advantages (Almstrup et al., 2004; Draper et al., 2004). In analogy to primor-
dial germ cells and gonocytes, CIS cells highly express transcription factors associated 
with embryonic stem cell pluripotency and somatic tissue-speciﬁ c stem cell lineages, 
including, for example, POU5F1/OCT-3/4, NANOG, GDF3, KIT, and AP-2J (Almstrup 
et al., 2004; Biermann et al., 2007; Hoei-Hansen et al., 2004, 2005; Looijenga et al., 
2003; Skotheim et al., 2005; Sperger et al., 2003).
Our current hypothesis is that developmental arrest of gonocytes is caused by disrup-
tion of the endocrine environment in the testis (niche). The niche comprises somatic cells 
(mainly Sertoli and Leydig cells), which secrete hormones and paracrine factors that stim-
ulate male-speciﬁ c germ cell maturation into spermatogonia (Rajpert-De Meyts, 2006). 
Indeed, evidence from animal models indicates that perinatally administered endocrine 
disrupters  like phthalates can induce dysgenic lesions in the testes of rats and rabbits 
(Fisher et al., 2003; Foster et al., 2001; Higuchi et al., 2003), similar to those frequently 
observed in patients with testicular germ cell cancer (Hoei-Hansen et al., 2003; Skak-
kebaek et al., 2003). Interestingly, these dysgenic patterns seem to be affecting primarily 
somatic cells, in particular Leydig cells, and not directly germ cells (Mahood et al., 2005). 
The effect on germ cells thus seems to be secondary but nevertheless adversely affects 
their perinatal development. Increased and widespread use of industrial products that 
act like endocrine disrupters (e.g., phthalates) combined with an increase in endocrine-
related diseases, which may cause dysgenesis of the testis, for example, obesity , have thus 
raised growing concerns of possible association between exposure of endocrine disrupt-
ing chemicals and human adverse effects. Indeed, elevated levels of chemicals, such as 
polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene, and chlordanes, have been detected in 
blood from the mothers of men with testicular cancer (Hardell et al., 2003).
18.3 Testicular dysgenesis
Clinical observations of patients with various kinds of disorders related to endocrine 
and reproductive function in 2001 lead to the hypothesis of the testicular dysgenesis 
syndrome  (TDS) (Skakkebaek, Rajpert-De Meyts, and Main, 2001). It was suggested

that many cases of poor semen quality, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism (undescended 
testis) may share the same etiological origin with testicular cancer, namely improper 
development of the testes. The hypothesis was based on observations of common risk 
factors, which in all cases seem to operate in utero or early infancy and that the trends 
in incidence follow each other within geographical regions (Boisen et al., 2004; Hem-
minki and Li, 2002b; Hemminki et al., 2002). However, not all of the symptoms may 
be present in an individual with TDS; that happens very rarely in patients with genetic 
disorders of sex differentiation, for example, AR or SRY mutations with only partial loss 
of the gene function (Isidor et al., 2009). Obviously, factors other than TDS may cause 
poor semen quality and genital malformations (see XFig. 18.2).
Of disorders regarded as part of the TDS, testicular cancer offers the best clinical, 
epidemiological, and biological evidence, and most of the knowledge related to TDS 
has been gained from testicular cancer.
18.4 Perinatal reprogramming of germ cells
In order to deduce possible effects of endocrine disruption on germ cells leading to 
development of CIS, it is a prerequisite to understand the perinatal reprogramming of 
environmental and
lifestyle factors
genetic defects and
polymorphisms
decreased Leydig cell
function
disturbed Sertoli cell
function
decreased testosterone, impaired
spermatogenesis, infertility
hypospadias
CIS
testicular cancer
cryptorchidism
gonadoblastoma
decreased INSL3
production
androgen
insufficiency
impaired germ
cell differentiation
testicular dysgenesis
Fig. 18.2: Outline of the TDS concept. Genetic factors increase sensitivity toward yet unknown 
environmental or lifestyle factors that cause testicular dysgenesis. Effects are probably induced 
primarily in the somatic nurse cells surrounding the germ cells. This in turn leads to a delayed 
germ cell maturation and decreased secretion of reproductive hormones. Probably depending on 
the susceptibility and how severe the effects are, fetal dysgenesis is manifested by several clinical 
outcomes, including impairment of testicular descent, hypospadias, neoplastic transformation 
of germ cells (CIS in testes or gonadoblastoma in intersex gonads), or some forms of impaired 
testicular function and spermatogenesis later in life. Adapted from Skakkebæk et al. (2007).

18.4 Perinatal reprogramming of germ cells    223
normal fetal germ cells. Most of our current knowledge on fetal germ cell development 
comes from studies in mice, probably due to difﬁ culties in obtaining sufﬁ cient material 
for human studies. During embryonic development, embryonic ectoderm gives rise to 
somatic germ layers and primordial germ cells (PGC), which are ﬁ rst observed at embry-
onic day E7.25 (mice) in the posterior end of the primitive streak. BLIMP1 positive cells 
are, however, already seen at E6.25 and mark pre-PGCs (Ohinata et al., 2005). BLIMP1 
is crucial for normal germ cell speciﬁ cation and is thought to be engaged in suppression 
of somatic programs by Hox genes (i.e., HoxA1 and HoxB1) (Ohinata et al., 2005). 
Approximately at embryonic day E8 (mice) PGC start to migrate toward the genital 
ridge and colonize the primitive gonad, which is tightly associated with the mesoneph-
ros. This primitive gonad is still sexually bipotential, and sex-determination ﬁ rst takes 
place between E10.5 and E11.5. Female germ cells are bound to subsequently enter 
meiosis, but male germ cells, gonocytes, continue to proliferate and later differentiate 
to prespermatogonia, which are locked in mitotic arrest. Expression of the gene Sry in 
precursors of Sertoli cells is thought to be one of the most important switches involved 
in sex-determination. If Sry is expressed, this subsequently triggers expression of Sox9 
and several other masculinizing genes that are essential for proper differentiation of 
Sertoli cells (recently reviewed in Koopman, 2010). Sertoli cells are stimulated, embed-
ding PGC/gonocytes and form cord structures, which in mice are seen at E12. Migration 
of human PGCs takes place during gestational week (GW) 4–6, and after GW 6 germ 
cells are found in the gonadal anlage and begin to be surrounded by immature Sertoli 
cells. From that point of time, the term gonocyte is used to describe the germ cells in the 
male gonad (Fujimoto, Miyayama, and Fuyuta, 1977).
During speciﬁ cation and migration mice PGCs undergo speciﬁ c epigenetic re-
programming, which includes genome-wide DNA demethylation (starting at E8), 
progressive erasure of histone H3 K9 demethylation (H3K9me2; starting at E7.5), and 
subsequently establishment of H3K27me3 (starting at E8.25) in a progressive, cell-by-
cell manner (Seki et al., 2005, 2007). Around the time of gonadal colonization (E11.5) 
further modiﬁ cations of the chromatin occur. Such epigenetic programs of PGCs pre-
sumably are tightly regulated during development and are a prerequisite for proper 
maturation of germ cells.
Both H3K9me2 and H3K27me3 are repressive modiﬁ cations, and in the period dur-
ing exchange of these modiﬁ cations (E7.5 and E8.25) the PGC is free of repressing 
chromatin leading to hypertranscription. Transcriptional activity dependent on RNA 
polymerase II is, however, transiently repressed in PGC during this period (Seki et al., 
2007). Accordingly, the histone methyltransferase, GLP, which methylates H3 at K9, is 
downregulated prior to H3K9 demethylation (Tachibana et al., 2008).
In early pre-PGC and migrating PGCs BLIMP1 (expressed from E6.25) is found in the 
nucleus complexed with PRMT5, where the complex mediates symmetrical methyla-
tion of histones H4 and H2A at arginine 3 (H4/H2AR3me2). When murine PGC arrive 
in the genital ridge this complex is translocated to the cytoplasm, leading to reduced 
levels of H4/H2AR3me2 (Ancelin et al., 2006). Translocation of Blimp1/Prmt5 to the cy-
toplasm leads to downregulation of Blimp1, which in turn coincides with re-expression 
of pluripotency-associated genes such as Nanog and Sox2 (Ohinata et al., 2005; Yabuta 
et al., 2006). In this particular stage, there is a signiﬁ cant difference between species: 
human PGCs do not express SOX2 while retaining high expression of NANOG and 
POU5F1 (Perrett et al., 2008).

224    18 Perinatal origin of testicular germ cell cancer
When mice PGCs colonize the genital ridge (E11.5) extensive chromatin and epi-
genetic reprogramming occurs. These include linker histone H1, H3K9ac, H3K9me3, 
H3K27me2, DAPI chromocenters, and H4/H2A R3me2 (Hajkova et al., 2008) and a 
second wave of DNA demethylation, where parental imprints are erased (Hajkova 
et al., 2002). Some parental imprints are already set again starting at E14.5, while 
others ﬁ rst are acquired at the newborn stage (Li et al., 2004). By FACS analysis of 
dissected urogenital ridges of an Oct4-GFP transgenic mouse, Hajkova et al. (2008) 
identiﬁ ed two Oct4+ (GFP) populations of PGCs at E11.5. These two populations 
were shown to reﬂ ect a developmentally primitive and a more advanced PGC popu-
lation. The advanced population showed low levels of H2A.Z, linker H1, H3K9ac, 
H3K9me3, and H3K27me3, as well as H2A/H4R3me2, when compared to the 
primitive population showing higher levels of these marks. Accordingly, the primitive 
population showed variations in the levels of DNA methylation  (5-methyl-cytosine 
levels), whereas the advanced population was practically devoid of DNA methylation 
(Hajkova et al., 2008).
After colonization PGC proliferate and when a sufﬁ cient amount is reached female 
germ cells enter meiotic prophase, while male germ cells (gonocytes) arrest in the 
G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle until after birth. After birth, gonocytes give rise to primi-
tive spermatogonia (spermatogonial stem cells) that start to proliferate and develop into 
spermatocytes at days 10–14 postnatal in mice.
PGC in the genital ridge are virtually devoid of DNA methylation (Reik and Walter, 
2001), but de novo methylation is initiated in male germ cells at E14.5 and thereafter 
in female germ cells, and mature gametes of both sexes will eventually become highly 
methylated. Additional DNA demethylation and histone modiﬁ cations take place in 
pubertal and adult male germ cells after meiosis during spermatogenesis (Bernardino 
et al., 2000; del Mazo et al., 1994; Norris et al., 1994). Histones are exchanged with 
transition proteins and ﬁ nally with protamines. Additionally, it has been suggested 
that remethylation and possible further chromatin modiﬁ cations may occur when 
 spermatozoa undergo ﬁ nal maturation in the epididymis (Xie et al., 2002).
18.5 Involvement of perinatal reprogramming in the CIS phenotype?
It has never been possible to cultivate CIS cells, nor does an appropriate animal model 
for CIS and testicular germ cell cancer exist. Investigations of CIS cells are thus limited 
to archived material from human testicular tissue, and very little is known about the 
epigenetic status of CIS cells. So far it is only known that CIS cells show H4/H2AR3me2 
modiﬁ cations (Eckert et al., 2008) and that CIS have very low levels of DNA methylation  
(Netto et al., 2008). Most seminomas show H4/H2A R3me2, while low levels are found 
in nonseminomas (Eckert et al., 2008). DNA methylation levels in seminomas are vari-
able but mainly low, while high levels are found in nonseminomas (Netto et al., 2008; 
Smiraglia et al., 2002). This pattern of DNA methylation coincides very well with our 
ﬁ ndings of high expression of the DNA methylation enzymes DNMT3A and DNMT3L 
in the undifferentiated component of nonseminoma, embryonal carcinoma (EC), when 
compared to seminoma and CIS (Almstrup et al., 2005).
From the limited knowledge of epigenetic patterns in CIS cells, these patterns seem 
to be retained in seminomas, while nonseminomas (EC) show a different and more 

References    225
“somatic-like” pattern. Similar relations have earlier been suggested from studies of 
histology and gene expression (Rajpert-De Meyts et al., 2003).
In recent years, studies of the mechanistic pathways affected by some environmental 
chemicals have suggested a possibility of heritable changes in epigenetic patterns in 
fetal germ cells (Anway et al., 2005, 2006). It is, therefore, a pertinent scientiﬁ c ques-
tion whether dysregulation of epigenetic patterns in fetal germ cells is involved in the 
pathogenesis of testicular cancer.
18.6 Concluding remarks
Both biological and epidemiological data indicate that testicular germ cell cancer has 
a fetal origin. Dysgenetic patterns similar to those frequently observed in human testes 
of testicular cancer patients can be mimicked by perinatal exposure to, for example, 
phthalates in rats. We do not have any direct human evidence, but the animal studies 
raise the likelihood of such environmental perinatal exposures in the pathogenesis of 
testicular cancer and testicular dysgenesis. Probably exposure in an early time-window 
during pregnancy is critical, but further reprogramming and genomic changes dur-
ing subsequent development are likely. Further investigations in humans are needed, 
 however, in order to prove direct effects of perinatal environmental exposure.

19 Epigenetic adaptation during early life
Moshe Szyf
Adaptation of the genome through sequence alterations to changing environments is a slow 
process that requires selection. However, the DNA molecule itself bears an additional level of 
information: the pattern of distribution of methyl groups that are covalently bound to cytosine 
bases in DNA. DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene function and serves as part 
of the mechanism that allows one genome to express multiple phenotypes in a multicellular 
organism. DNA methylation was originally proposed to serve as a marker of cellular identity 
that was generated during cellular differentiation. Recent data that will be discussed here sup-
ports the hypothesis that DNA methylation is a reversible biological signal and could therefore 
potentially serve in genome adaptation beyond cellular differentiation. DNA methylation is 
proposed to act as a genomic response to both physical and social signals from the environ-
ment at different time points in life and to serve as a genomic memory of these exposures at 
different time scales, stably altering gene expression programming and thus modulating the 
physical and behavioral phenotypes to respond to these environments.
19.1 DNA methylation patterns and cellular identity
DNA from bacteria to humans contains in addition to the 4 bases that are replicated by 
strict Watson and Crick rules modiﬁ ed bases such as 5-methylcytosine, 6-methyladenine 
and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. A two-step process generates these modiﬁ ed bases. First, 
the DNA is copied and in the second step enzymes termed DNA methyltransferases  
(DNMT) catalyze the transfer of methyl moieties to cytosines or adenines bases in DNA 
from the donor molecule S-adenosylmethionine  (Adams, 1995; Bestor and Verdine, 
1994). DNA methyltransferases exhibit different levels of speciﬁ city for the sequence 
context and this creates information in the DNA molecule. In vertebrates, the most com-
monly methylated cytosine is found in the CG dinucleotide  (Gruenbaum et al., 1981; 
Gruenbaum et al., 1982). In bacteria species-speciﬁ c DNA methylation patterns serve 
to differentiate self versus non-self and protect the bacteria from bacteriophage and 
foreign DNA invasion by restricting it with DNA methylation  resistant enzymes. What 
makes DNA methylation a unique set of information in multicellular organisms, par-
ticularly vertebrates, is the fact that it is differentially methylated in different cell types. 
DNA methylation was therefore proposed to confer cellular identity to the genome and 
thus explain the mystery of how could one genome encode multiple phenotypes in a 
multicellular organism as predicted by Waddington (Waddington, 1959).
In contrast to the situation in unicellular bacteria where the DNA methylation pat-
tern is strictly sequence speciﬁ c, the presence of a differential methylation patterns in 
different cell types in the same organism bearing the same genome implies that during 

230    19 Epigenetic adaptation during early life
embryogenesis , this pattern is differentially carved and sculpted (Razin and Riggs, 1980). 
Since cellular differentiation is extremely tight and highly conserved across individuals 
it implies that an innate process that is highly conserved across individuals generates 
DNA methylation patterns. As differentiation has been believed to be terminal, the DNA 
methylation pattern was believed to be terminal as well. It has been therefore the belief 
that DNA methylation patterns once generated are strictly conserved during the entire 
life course.
Two principles were believed to be responsible for the faithful maintenance of 
the DNA methylation patterns throughout life. First, DNA methylation patterns are 
faithfully copied during cell division by a semiconservative maintenance DNA meth-
yltransferase DNMT1 . The CG dinucleotide sequence is a principal target of DNA 
methylation (Gruenbaum et al., 1981) since it is preferentially recognized by vertebrate 
DNA methyltransferases (Gruenbaum et al., 1982). CG is the only dinucleotide se-
quence that contains a cytosine that is a palindrome and could be copied during cell 
division by a semiconservative DNA methyltransferase from the parental strand onto 
the daughter strand (Razin and Riggs, 1980). It was shown that DNMT1 prefers hemi-
methylated substrates that are generated during cell division when a methylated CG 
on the parental strand is replicated. Restricting DNA methylation to CG dinucleotides 
is essential for the heritability of the DNA methylation mark. Second, it was believed 
that no de novo methyltransferases or demethylases are present in cells after cellular 
differentiation is completed thus the pattern could be copied accurately but not altered 
(XFig. 19.1).

Fig. 19.1: Maintenance of DNA methylation pattern in somatic cells. It has been generally 
believed that in somatic cells the DNA methylation pattern is faithfully preserved because 
it is copied from the parental strand to the daughter strand by the semi-conservative DNA 
methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). De novo methyltransferases that add methyl groups to new sites 
or demethylase activities that remove methyl groups from DNA were believed to be absent in 
somatic cells. Recent data suggest that de novo methylation and demethylase activity are present 
in postmitotic fully differentiated cells such as neurons.

19.2 Early life environment and DNA methylation
The DOHAD hypothesis claims that the origin of late onset disease is in events that 
occur early in life and program gene expression in a manner that increases susceptibil-
ity to disease later in life (Hanson and Gluckman, 2008). Although the classic model of 
DNA methylation postulated high ﬁ delity of maintenance DNA methylation, stochastic 
changes in DNA methylation could still occur during gestation when the embryo is 
exposed to chemicals that interfere with DNA methylation enzymes during the critical 
time when these patterns are generated. Such stochastic changes could possibly result 
in altered gene expression leading to susceptibility to disease (Sinclair et al., 2007). 
Examples are nutritional restriction during pregnancy (Unterberger et al., 2009) and 
low folic acid /vitamin B12 diets during the periconception period (Bistulﬁ  et al., 2010; 
Herbert, 1986). An elegant illustration of how the dietary environment affects the supply 
of methyl donors and alters DNA methylation in the embryo resulting in changes in the 
coat color phenotype of the offspring comes from Randy Jirtle’s work with the Agouti 
mouse  model (Dolinoy et al., 2007a; Dolinoy et al., 2007b; Jirtle and Skinner, 2007; 
Waterland and Jirtle, 2003). Stochastic drifts in DNA methylation patterns could occur 
in sperm DNA (Flanagan et al., 2006) and some of these that escape erasure could 
be maintained and propagated in the embryo and result in polymorphisms in DNA 
methylation pattern that might affect gene expression  and the phenotype .
19.3  Reversibility of DNA methylation; adaptive 
responsivity of the methylome
The big question is whether the involvement of DNA methylation in adult disease is a 
result of accidental stochastic drift as predicted by the classic and well-accepted mod-
els of DNA methylation or whether these differences in DNA methylation reﬂ ect an 
adaptive response of the methylome  (genome wide DNA methylation pattern) to the 
environment. Moreover, the postnatal nutritional and social environment is critical for 
health trajectories later in life. An attractive hypothesis is that DNA methylation could 
adapt to changing environments by a truly physiologically adaptive response rather 
than a collection of accidents. If DNA methylation is adaptive to the environment it 
must be dynamic after birth and in postmitotic tissues as well. For DNA methylation to 
function as a biological signal that is responsive to the environment it must be revers-
ible (Ramchandani et al., 1999). However the general focus in the ﬁ eld was on DNA 
methyltransferases since it was believed that true active demethylation is energetically 
unfeasible. The great mystery in the ﬁ eld is the identity of the enzymatic processes that 
reverse the DNA methylation reaction.
We have previously shown that DNA demethylation  could be induced using drugs 
that inhibit histone deacetylation  and increase histone acetylation in a replication in-
dependent manner (Cervoni and Szyf, 2001; Szyf et al., 1985). Since these agents are 
not demethylating the DNA, these results imply that there must be enzymatic processes 
that remove methyl groups from DNA that are facilitated by increased histone acetyla-
tion. The most remarkable observations illustrating dynamic methylation-demethylation 
come from the brain where several studies have already shown demethylation in post-
mitotic neurons (Feng et al., 2010; Levenson et al., 2006; Miller et al., 2007; Weaver 

232    19 Epigenetic adaptation during early life
et al., 2004). Conditional knock out of DNMT1 in postmitotic neurons results in DNA 
demethylation (Feng et al., 2010).
The main open question is mechanism. The most widely accepted mechanisms for 
active DNA demethylation involve DNA repair and replacement of the methylated cy-
tosine nucleotide by an unmethylated cytosine nucleotide. One possible mechanism 
is removal of the methylated cytosine by a glycosylase activity, the abasic site is then 
repaired and replaced with an unmethylated cytosine (Razin et al., 1986). A study pro-
posed that DNMTs participate in demethylation by deaminating the methyl cytosine to 
thymidine creating a C/T mismatch repair, which is then corrected by a mismatch-repair 
mechanism (Kangaspeska et al., 2008). DNMTs were previously shown to deaminate 
5-methylcytosines (Shen et al., 1992; Zingg et al., 1998) under conditions of low SAM. 
Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 alpha (GADD45A), a DNA re-
pair protein was proposed to participate in catalysis of active DNA demethylation by 
an unknown DNA repair based mechanism (Barreto et al., 2007). However, this was 
disputed ( Jin et al., 2008). A very recent study suggested that demethylation in zebra 
ﬁ sh embryos involves a complex sequence of coupled enzymatic reactions; activation-
induced cytidine deaminase (AID, which converts 5-meC to thymine) and a G:T 
mismatch-speciﬁ c thymine glycosylase methyl-CpG binding domain protein 4 (MBD4) 
and repair promoted by GADD45A (Rai et al., 2008). AID has been implicated in the global 
demethylation in mouse primordial germ cells (Popp et al., 2010).
In contrast to these repair based mechanisms we have previously proposed that 
demethylation is truly a reversible reaction that involves removal of the methyl moiety 
rather than breaking the DNA and ﬁ xing it with an unmethylated cytosine (Ramchan-
dani et al., 1999). We proposed that the methylated DNA binding protein MBD2 was 
a bona ﬁ de demethylase that removed methyl groups from DNA and truly reversed the 
DNA methylation reaction. This is to date the only described bona ﬁ de demethylase. 
MBD2 has been implicated in the activation of both methylated and unmethylated 
genes (Angrisano et al., 2006; Fujita et al., 2003). Several groups (Ng et al., 1999; 
Wade et al., 1999) have contested the demethylase and transcriptional activating 
properties of MBD2. Studies by Detich et al. have demonstrated, however, MBD2 
demethylase activity in vitro (Detich et al., 2002). Hamm et al. (2008) have proposed 
an oxidative mechanism of 5-cytosine DNA demethylation by MBD2. According to 
this mechanism, oxidation of the methyl moiety generates 5-hydroxymethylcytosine 
by oxidation, which is followed by release of the methyl residue in formaldehyde. 
Interestingly, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine was recently discovered in mammalian DNA 
(Pelizzola et al., 2008). A recent study has shown that TET1, an enzyme that con-
verts methylcytosine to hydroxymethylcytosine, is required for maintaining the de-
methylated state of nanog in mouse ES cells supporting a possible role for TET1 and 
5-hydroxymethylcysoine as an intermediary in the demethylation reaction (Ito et al., 
2010). In summary, although there is no agreement as of yet on the mechanism of 
DNA demethylation , the presence of active demethylation in somatic cells is widely 
acknowledged (XFig. 19.2).
The fact that DNA methylation is reversible allows us to postulate that it could 
function as a mechanism for genome adaptation  to the environment (XFig. 19.3). It 
is possible that in addition to the well-established role of DNA methylation in confer-
ring cellular identity to the same genome, DNA methylation provides “environmental 
exposure” identity to similar genomes. Whereas cell type differential DNA methylation

Fig. 19.2: The DNA methylation equilibrium and mechanisms of demethylation of DNA. DNA 
is methylated by a transfer of a methyl moiety from the methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine 
(SAM) to the 5’ position on a cytosine ring by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) releasing 
S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH). Several demethylation reactions were suggested. Direct 
demethylation by a demethylase enzyme (dMTase) would release a methyl moiety (CH3) in the 
form of either methanol or formaldehyde reversing the DNA methylation reaction. Alternatively, 
the methyl cytosine ring could be modiﬁ ed by either deamination catalyzed for example by 
AID or by the DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) which were shown to catalyze deamination 
of 5-methylcytidine in the absence of SAM or hydroxylation of the methyl moiety catalyzed 
by TET1. The modiﬁ ed base is then excised and repaired. Alternatively, the bond between the 
sugar and the base is cleaved (by glycosylases such as MBD4 or 5-methylcytosine glycosylase 
5-MCDG) followed by repair. Repair proteins were shown to be associated with demethylation.

Fig. 19.3: Genome adaptation by DNA methylation in response to the perinatal environment; a 
model. Signals from the perinatal environment act on cellular signaling pathways in the brain, 
immune system and other tissues to modulate DNA methylation and thus stably adapt gene 
expression and the phenotype system-wide to the anticipated life-long environment. When 
there is a misﬁ t between the anticipated environment during the perinatal period and the real 
environment during adulthood the methylation pattern programming becomes maladaptive and 
would lead to health challenges.

234    19 Epigenetic adaptation during early life
patterns enable the same genome express multiple phenotypes in the same individuals, 
environmental methylome  programming would allow similar genomes express different 
phenotypes in different individuals that bear otherwise similar genes. Whereas innate 
processes that are highly conserved must deﬁ ne the origination of differential DNA 
methylation patterns during development, modulation of these patterns in response to 
environmental cues requires dynamic DNA methylation machinery.
19.4 Adaptation of the methylome early in life
We propose that DNA methylation serves as an adaptive mechanism of the genome 
to changing environments. Although stochastic polymorphisms in DNA methylation 
might in certain instances result in late onset disease (Feinberg and Irizarry, 2010), we 
propose that the response of the methylome to the environment is fundamentally a 
physiological response that is driven by signaling pathways. If indeed changes in DNA 
methylation are a physiological response to the environment, it has immediate implica-
tions on the frequency of such responses in the population and therefore on the size 
of the population that needs to be examined to unravel informative DNA methylation 
studies. Stochastic polymorphisms  in DNA methylation such as genetic polymorphisms 
will clearly require larger numbers than physiological responses. Although the evidence 
for such a “DNA methylation adaptive” mechanism is still sparse, there is emerging 
evidence for programming of behavior and metabolic state by early life environment in 
rodents and association studies in humans.
The most widely accepted deﬁ nitions of “epigenetics ” include heritability either 
mitotically or meiotically as a basic component. However, if indeed DNA methylation 
is dynamic in non-dividing cells then DNA methylation could potentially act at dif-
ferent time scales from rapid transient time scales (Kangaspeska et al., 2008; Métivier 
et al., 2008) to evolutionary time scales. Long-term adaptations in DNA methylation 
do not necessarily require mitotic stability. DNA methylation changes could occur in 
postmitotic cells such as neurons early in life and affect the life-long phenotype. These 
DNA methylation responses should not be limited to early-life. An interesting example 
of a DNA methylation change occurring in postmitotic neurons in adult rodents that 
has a long-term impact was recently reported; exposure of adult mice to chronic social 
stress induced demethylation of the corticotropin release factor (CRF) gene (Elliott et al., 
2010). We will focus here on examples of life-long DNA methylation “adaptations” that 
occur early in life in response to exposure to the social environment and have a life-long 
impact on the phenotype. These sparse but nevertheless thought-provoking examples 
could serve as a model for exploring the role of DNA methylation programming early in 
life in other late-onset disease including metabolic disorders.
The overall hypothesis that is proposed here is that the perinatal and postnatal early 
life environments which include the physical sphere, the biosphere and the social sphere 
modulate the methylome system-wide to adapt genome functions to the anticipated 
life long environments. Any misﬁ t between the anticipated and the real environments 
could turn this DNA methylation pattern from adaptive to ”maladaptive” leading to 
health disorders. There are a few examples from rodents, primates and humans that are 
consistent with this hypothesis.

19.5 Epigenetic programming by maternal care in the rat    235
19.5 Epigenetic programming by maternal care in the rat
There are several models that measure the impact of the early life social environment 
on behavior and other health phenotypes later in life. Models of maternal deprivation  
in primates  and rodents and natural variation in maternal care  in rodents were used to 
demonstrate the profound impact of maternal care and “nurture” on a panel of phe-
notypes in the offspring that last into adulthood (Ruppenthal et al., 1976; Suomi et al., 
1976).
In rodents a model of natural variation in maternal care was originally used to study 
the impact of maternal care on stress behavior and stress responsivity in the offspring. 
The major response mediating adaptation to stress is activation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) , with stimulation of corticotropin releasing factor  (CRF) 
and vasopressin  (VP) from parvocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular 
nucleus , stimulating pituitary ACTH secretion, which in turn triggers glucocorticoid 
secretion from the adrenal cortex. Hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor  controls the 
negative feedback of the axis by glucocorticoids thus attenuating the stress response. In 
the rat, the adult offspring of mothers that exhibit increased levels of pup licking/groom-
ing (i.e., high LG mothers) over the ﬁ rst week of life show increased hippocampal (GR) 
expression, enhanced glucocorticoid feedback sensitivity, decreased hypothalamic 
CRF expression and more modest HPA stress responses compared to animals reared 
by low LG mothers (Francis et al., 1999; Liu et al., 1997). A genetic explanation was 
ruled out by cross-fostering  studies that demonstrated that the behavior of the foster-
ing mother and not the genetic mother deﬁ ned the stress  responsivity of the offspring 
(Francis et al., 1999; Liu et al., 1997). We therefore tested the possibility that maternal 
behavior  resulted in differential DNA methylation in the offspring hippocampus  that 
mediated the change in the phenotype in response to the environment. Differences in 
DNA methylation and histone acetylation in the regulatory regions of the glucocorti-
coid receptor (GR exon 17 promoter) gene were observed in the hippocampus of the 
offspring of high and low LG mothers early in life and remained stable into adulthood 
(Weaver et al., 2004).
The implications of this early study are supported by recent studies in other mod-
els of early life social adversity. Exposure of infant rats to stressed caretakers that 
displayed abusive behaviour produced persisting changes in methylation of BDNF  
gene promoter in the adult prefrontal cortex (Roth et al., 2009). Early-life stress (ELS) 
in mice caused sustained DNA hypomethylation of an important regulatory region of 
the arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene (Murgatroyd et al., 2009). Interestingly, stressful 
environments such as chronic social stress could induce stable DNA methylation 
changes in adult mice as well (Elliott et al., 2010). This further illustrates that the brain 
has life-long mechanisms to adapt to changing social environments. This has impli-
cations on the possibility of therapeutics by either pharmacological or behavioral 
interventions aiming at altering adverse DNA methylation patterns later in life. Thus, 
although epidemiological and animal data suggests that the early life environment 
is critical, and there might be critical windows for DNA methylation programming 
early in life, these results suggest that the methylome continues to be responsive to 
stressful signals throughout life and that theses alter DNA methylation as well as the 
phenotype.

236    19 Epigenetic adaptation during early life
19.6  Signaling cascades leading from maternal care 
to epigenetic programming
An important question that remains to be answered is what are the mechanisms that 
link exposure to an environmental exposure early in life to a persistent differential DNA 
methylation in one or several tissues. A reasonable hypothesis is that exposure to envi-
ronmental cues results in ﬁ ring of a signaling cascade that activates transacting factors 
that deliver DNA and chromatin modifying enzymes to speciﬁ c regulatory sequences of 
genes. Evidence for such a mechanism comes from the rat maternal care model. Mater-
nal behavior triggers a signaling pathway that involves the serotonin receptor, increase 
in cAMP, recruitment of the transcription factor nerve growth factor-induced protein A  
(NGFI-A), (Weaver et al., 2007) which in turn recruits the histone acetyltransferase CBP, 
and the methylated DNA binding protein and candidate DNA demethylase MBD2 to the 
GR promoter unpublished data. Our hypothesis is that the increased histone acetylation 
triggered by CREB binding protein (CBP) or by other recruited histone acetyltransferases 
(HATs) facilitates the demethylation of the gene by MBD2 or other DNA demethylases 
(unpublished data). These data chart a possible conduit through which exposure to a 
social behavior such as maternal behavior results in epigenetic modiﬁ cation of a spe-
ciﬁ c gene in the brain. Although it is certain that there are other molecular pathways 
that link social exposure and changes in DNA methylation, in particular positions in 
the genome, this example provides evidence for the feasibility of transducing a social 
signal into a DNA methylation mark. Similar mechanism can transduce other critical 
environmental exposures such as nutritional or oxygen restriction.
A different signaling cascade linking social exposure to DNA demethylation was 
proposed more recently to explain how early life stress results in persistent life-long hy-
pomethylation of the arginine vasopressin (AVP) gene . The AVP promoter is methylated 
and bound by the methyl CpG binding protein MECP2. Depolarization of hypothalamic 
neurons triggers phosphorylation of MeCp2 at Ser438 by calcium dependent CamKII 
(calmodulin kinase II; Murgatroyd et al., 2009). This phosphorylation converts MeCp2 
from a transcriptional silencer with high afﬁ nity to methylated DNA into a transcrip-
tional activator with low afﬁ nity to methylated DNA that facilitates demethylation of 
the AVP gene (Zhou et al., 2006). The change in MeCp2 afﬁ nity to methylated DNA 
by phosphorylation in response to neuronal activation was shown before to facilitate 
demethylation of the BDNF promoter (Chen et al., 2003). This signaling pathway de-
lineates a direct link between neuronal activation and the phosphorylation state of a 
protein interacting with methylated genes in the brain. Neuronal activation resulting in 
signaling through phosphorylation of proteins interacting with methylated DNA might 
be a general pathway that links social exposure and the activation of neurons.
19.7  Reversibility of early life DNA methylation 
programming by maternal care
The changes in DNA methylation in response to early life stress remain into adulthood 
and they could possibly explain how early life experience would shape the phenotype. 
However, since DNA methylation is potentially dynamic as discussed above the critical 
question is whether patterns of epigenetic modiﬁ cation programmed early in life are 

19.8 Epigenetic programming by early life events in humans    237
ﬁ nal states or whether they are potentially reversible. The idea that epigenetic states 
might be reversible even in adult brain as well as other tissues has immense  implications 
on the potential for interventions to override the effects of early life adversity.
Our previous studies have shown that increasing histone acetylation using the HDAC 
inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) facilitates replication-independent demethylation of non-
replicating plasmid DNA in human cells (Cervoni and Szyf, 2001; Cervoni et al., 2002). 
This experiment demonstrated that human somatic cells contained the enzymatic ma-
chinery required to demethylate DNA in the absence of DNA replication and that it 
was possible to alter the DNA methylation pattern using pharmacological agents that 
change histone acetylation. We tested whether a similar strategy would reverse epi-
genetic states established through maternal care and whether they would reside in a 
change in the phenotype. Injection of the HDAC inhibitor TSA into the brains of adult 
offspring of low LG maternal care reversed the epigenetic programming of the GR exon 
17 promoter and reestablished stress  responsivity and open ﬁ eld behavior that was 
indistinguishable from the offspring of high LG maternal care (Cervoni and Szyf, 2001; 
Cervoni et al., 2002).
We have previously shown that it is possible to alter the state of methylation of a non-
replicating plasmid in the opposite way by treating cells with the methyl donor SAM  
which inhibits the DNA demethylation reaction (Detich et al., 2003.). Injection of the 
amino acid methionine, the precursor of SAM, into the brains of adult offspring of high 
maternal LG resulted in increased DNA methylation and downregulation of GR as well 
as heightened stress responsivity and an open ﬁ eld behavior that was indistinguishable 
from the adult offspring of low maternal LG (Weaver et al., 2004; Weaver et al., 2005). 
These data suggest that both the methylating and demethylating enzyme are present in 
the adult neuron and are amenable to pharmacological modulation.
19.8 Epigenetic programming by early life events in humans
An extremely important question is whether the results in rodents could be translated to 
humans? We therefore took advantage of a well phenotyped – brain bank to address the 
question of whether early life adversity leaves its mark in the DNA methylation pattern 
of the adult human brain hippocampus.
The ﬁ rst study looked at the promoter of the ribosomal RNA  (rRNA) genes. rRNA 
forms the skeleton of the ribosome, the protein synthesis machinery. Protein synthesis 
is essential for building new memories and creating new synapses in the brain. Our 
genome contains around 400 copies of the genes encoding rRNA. One possible way 
to control the protein synthesis capacity of a cell is through changing the fraction of 
active rRNA alleles in a cell (Brown and Szyf, 2007). We have previously shown that the 
fraction of rRNA genes that is active and is associated with the RNA Pol1 transcription 
machinery is unmethylated while the fraction that is inactive is methylated (Brown and 
Szyf, 2007). Our results showed that the suicide  victims who experienced childhood 
abuse had higher overall methylation in their rRNA genes and expressed less rRNA. 
This difference in methylation was region speciﬁ c: it was speciﬁ c to the hippocampus 
and was not observed in the cerebellum. Moreover, although signiﬁ cant methylation 
differences were observed between the controls and the suicide victims, no sequence 
differences were observed. The fact that the difference in methylation was brain-region 

238    19 Epigenetic adaptation during early life
speciﬁ c and that no sequence differences were observed further strengthens the con-
clusion that this difference in methylation is driven by an environmental rather than 
genetic variation (McGowan et al., 2008). RRNA genes are ubiquitously expressed and 
encode a ubiquitous function protein synthesis that seems to be an unlikely candidate 
to be affected by early-life adversity. However, protein synthesis is required for learning 
and memory in the brain. These data point to the possibility that the effects of early life 
adversity might not be limited to the usual suspects of highly tissue speciﬁ c genes whose 
speciﬁ c physiological function is well documented but that ubiquitously expressed 
genes might be involved as well.
In our second study, we examined whether epigenetic differences were driven by 
early childhood adversity or by other processes leading to suicide. We compared sui-
cide completers who were abused as children to suicide completers who were not. 
This time we looked at the GR exon 1f promoter that is homologous to the promoter 
affected by maternal care in the rat. Individuals with treatment-resistant forms of major 
depression show decreased GR expression and increased HPA activity. Site-speciﬁ c 
differences in DNA methylation in the GR exon 1f promoter between suicide com-
pleters who had reported social adversity early in life and suicide completers who did 
not experience social adversity early in life were detected. These differences in DNA 
methylation were associated with reduced expression of the GR gene. The site-speciﬁ c 
methylation interfered with binding of the transcription factor NGFI-A to the human GR 
exon 1f promoter. Reporter-activity transfection assays indicated that this site-speciﬁ c 
methylation inhibited GR promoter activity (McGowan et al., 2009). These data are 
a ﬁ rst demonstration that it is possible to identify the epigenetic imprints of early life 
exposure in the methylome in the adult brain. These epigenetic differences have func-
tional consequences resulting in reduced expression of a key regulator of the HPA axis.
Recently, this line of studies was extended to peripheral blood cell; the GR promoter 
was more methylated in lymphocytes in newborns exposed prenatally to maternal 
 depression than control newborns (Oberlander et al., 2008).
Epigenetic modulation of other candidate genes was implicated in suicide ; the 
Gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor alpha 1 subunit (GABRA1) promoter (Linthorst 
et al., 1995) within the frontopolar cortex (Poulter et al., 2008) and Tropomyosin-related 
kinase B (TRKB) in the frontal cortex of suicide completers (Ernst et al., 2009). It is 
 unknown yet whether these changes in DNA are also associated with early life adversity.
19.9 Genome-wide and system-wide effects of early life adversity
The ﬁ rst studies examining DNA methylation in the brain focused on a few gene sus-
pects that were very well known to mediate stress behavior as well as other dedicated 
brain functions. Most of our studies were biased toward the candidate gene approach 
assuming that phenotype associated with early life adversity would involve a few criti-
cal brain-speciﬁ c genes. In addition, unsurprisingly the ﬁ rst line of studies examining 
the impact of early life adversity focused on speciﬁ c brain regions. However, it is be-
coming clear that genes work in networks and that the total output of a network could 
be signiﬁ cantly affected by a combination of subtle changes in several nodes of a net-
work. The fact that methylation differences in suicide victims were found in rRNA genes 
(McGowan et al., 2008) supports the idea that genes outside the usual brain speciﬁ c 

References    239
suspects are involved. Preliminary data from our lab supports both the idea that changes 
in DNA methylation associated with early life adversity are genome-wide and that they 
are not limited to the brain.
We recently performed a detailed mapping of 6.5 megabases of DNA spanning 
the locus of the GR gene from both directions and identiﬁ ed numerous differences in 
DNA methylation between the suicide and the control groups. Recent high density-
epigenome mapping of chromosome 18 in the adult rat offspring of high and low ma-
ternal care reveals broad differences in DNA methylation and histone acetylation that 
cover wide regions of chromosome 18. We also started looking at association between 
early life adversity and DNA methylation differences in white blood cells. Our unpub-
lished data indicates associations between DNA methylation patterns in 45 year adults 
and social adversity early in life (Borghol et al., unpublished).
19.10 Prospects
DNA methylation is a stable mark that is part of the covalent structure of DNA. As such it 
is predicted to serve as a persistent epigenetic mark. On the other hand DNA methylation 
is laid down by enzymatic machinery that is potentially reversible. This bimodal nature of 
the methylome leaves us with important questions that are critical for both understanding 
how DNA methylation serves as a mediator of the link between perinatal environments 
and late-onset disease and how and when could we intervene to either protect or prevent 
the emergence of diseases driven by early life DNA methylation programming.
Are there critical periods for DNA methylation programming and if there are critical 
periods are they reversible later in life? A related question is whether the DNA meth-
ylation pattern continues to be responsive during adulthood and what is the relative 
contribution of the later-life exposures to the phenotype?
We propose that there are two time-scales of adaptations involving DNA methylation; 
those that occur in early life as well as life-long responses and that they have evolved to 
address different challenges of adaptation to the dynamic environment. There must be 
mechanisms that protect perinatal DNA methylation programming from environmental 
noise later in life and maintain it persistent during the life-course. This might imply that 
interventions should be preferably limited to this time zone. However, if mechanisms 
for DNA methylation changes during adulthood exist they could be harnessed for other 
interventional strategies later in life.
In any case the potential for DNA methylation changes later in life and during adult-
hood has important implications on the feasibility of either behavioral or pharmacologi-
cal interventions to reverse the trajectories of late onset disease. The critical challenges 
that need to be addressed are to deﬁ ne the timing and nature of efﬁ cacious interventions.

20  Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming: 
Vegetative imprinting by environment-dependent 
biocybernetogenesis
Andreas Plagemann
Life is a process of permanent environment-dependent development. Developmental origins 
of health and disease are framed throughout life but are particularly sustainable if shaped 
during critical periods of early life. This fundamental principle has a long history, but it was 
hidden in a niche during the past decades of gene myopia in biomedicine. Fortunately, the 
ﬁ eld meanwhile prospers enormously, but there still seems to be a lack of a general, overall 
concept that fulﬁ lls practicable semantic purposes and covers the whole spectrum of phe-
nomena and underlying mechanisms, appropriately.
Attempting a synthesizing, general concept  and semantics it is proposed here that “adap-
tive, predictive responses” (APRs) during critical developmental periods in pre- and early 
postnatal life lead to a perinatal programming of affected life functions. In this concept, APRs 
are mechanistically realized by a passive epigenomic and/or microstructural conditioning 
of the organism, leading to a homeostatic calibration  of functional and tolerance ranges 
at the subcellular, cellular, and up to the organismic level according to the environmental 
conditions experienced during critical developmental periods. This basic process of biocy-
bernetogenesis  in terms of a developmental vegetative training  or learning serves to optimize 
the self-organization of an organism in order to cope with the environmental conditions and 
challenges throughout later life. Programming by APRs generally occurs normative as a basic 
mechanism of ontogenesis. By alterations of the pre- and neonatal environmental conditions 
it may become disadvantageous or even harmful for the long-term individual health and 
reproductive ﬁ tness, what should be called malprogramming due to dysbiocybernetogen-
esis . Programming or malprogramming, as basically acquired modes of function, can even 
pass through generations of the maternal line by offering the resultant (altered) homeostatic 
milieu by mothers (affected females) to the next generation in utero, and so on. Thereby, over 
generations all of this may even affect phylogenesis and, consequently, evolution.
The most important and sustainable effects of perinatal programming occur if the main 
regulatory instances of the organism are affected, that is, the genome and/or the brain. In-
deed, exactly this has meanwhile been shown for all fundamental life functions (metabolism, 
growth, and body weight regulation; stress response; immunity and neuroendocrine-immune 
interaction; information processing and behavior; reproduction).
For instance, pre- and/or neonatal overfeeding (maternal diabetes/obesity, neonatal over-
feeding/rapid neonatal weight gain) have been shown epidemiologically, clinically, and 
experimentally to induce epigenomic and microstructural malprogramming  of the hypothal-
amo-adipo-pancreatic system, leading to long-term increased metabolic syndrome risk, which 
is then intergeneratively transmitted through the maternal line to subsequent generations but, 
most of all, is preventable by normalization of perinatal food supply.

244    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
In summary, environment-dependent biocybernetogenesis and perinatal programming are 
critical and essential parts of ontogenesis, affecting health and disease risks for the whole life 
span in terms of a basal, initial conditioning. In biomedicine, this opens enormous chances 
and challenges of a genuine prophylaxis  to the beneﬁ t of individuals and societies.
20.1 Historical and semantic notes
During recent years, the traditional understanding of the origins of health and diseases  
is fundamentally changing. It is becoming clear that the interaction between genes and 
environmental factors is not a static, independent process. Rather, during critical devel-
opmental periods, an environment-dependent conditioning  of the biological hardware 
occurs, especially during the fetal period and in the newborn. This early programming 
sustainably determines the long-term fate of an organism in terms of health and/or 
disease dispositions. The process has been introduced as perinatal programming and 
seems to be the most important developmental cause of diseases, beyond classical tera-
togenesis  and aging processes (Plagemann, 2004, 2010). As this opens new possibilities 
of a primary prevention, it likely not only leads to fundamental paradigmatic changes in 
developmental biology and medicine but opens new chances and challenges for public 
health policies.
Important roots of the ﬁ eld were planted at the Charité in Berlin by the endocrinolo-
gist Günter Dörner, who already in the 1970s proposed hormone-dependent pre- and 
neonatal preprogramming of long-term disease risks and a respective concept of func-
tional teratogenesis  (Dörner, 1974a, 1974b, 1975). Already in 1974, published in 1975, 
at an international Neurobiology Conference in Chapel Hill, Dörner formulated the 
following: 
Experimental and clinical data suggest that homeostatic variables, such as hormones, me-
tabolites and neurotransmitters, . . . during the critical organization phase  of an organism are 
capable of “preprogramming” the responsiveness of their own central nervous controllers and 
hence the functional and tolerance ranges of their self-organizing systems. 
By this proposal, for the ﬁ rst time a general, mechanistic principle on the long-term 
impact of environment-dependent programming during critical periods of early life was 
formulated, covering all elementary life functions.
Although this was a milestone, possibly even the natal hour of today’s perinatal pro-
gramming ﬁ eld, one should consider that the overall idea of developmental origins has 
a much longer history  (XTab. 20.1). Considering the actual discussion on epigenetic in-
heritance, it is closely related to the concepts of Lamarck (1809) and Waddington (1942) 
and regarding the fundamental impact of the external and internal environment for early 
ontogenesis to the work and achievements of Saint-Hilaire (1837) and Haeckel (1866). 
Essential mechanistic contributions then came from Stockard (1921), Spemann (Spemann 
and Mangold, 1924), and Ashby (1947). Particularly inﬂ uential were the observations by 
Konrad Lorenz (1935) on behavioral imprinting  during critical periods of early life.
All of this pioneer work during the 19th century and ﬁ rst half of the 20th century found 
a conceptual and semantic continuation during the 1960s, initially by Werboff and 

20.1 Historical and semantic notes    245
Gottlieb (1963), focusing on behavior, and Dubos, focusing on body weight regulation 
(Dubos, Savage, and Schaedler, 1966). It seems reasonable, however, to credit Dörner 
for having framed the concept in an overall, fundamental way. By introducing functional 
teratology he suggested a new, explanatory terminology, proposed hormone-mediated 
epigenetic organization by the environment as a general mechanism, addressed the 
whole spectrum of life functions, and drew far-reaching practical conclusions in terms of 
perinatal prevention  (Dörner, 1974a, 1974b, 1975, 1976, 1980). Already in this context 
and at this time, gestational diabetes as a paradigm of prenatal mal- and overnutrition 
came into the focus of the ﬁ eld, especially by fuel-mediated teratogenesis  introduced 
by Freinkel and Metzger (1979; Freinkel, 1980), as well as by the observation of “ges-
tational diabetes as a perinatally acquired condition”, described by the group of André 
van Assche (Aerts and Van Assche, 1979).
However, all of this was hidden in a niche until the early 1990s. Then, to the merit 
of epidemiologist David Barker and biochemist Nicholas Hales, the overall approach 
attracted more and more attention, and nowadays it belongs to the “hot topics” in 
developmental biology and medicine. In this regard, points of origin were and still 
are the observations and hypotheses of permanently increased disease dispositions in 
underweight newborns (Hales and Barker, 1992). Finally, the ﬁ eld gained a remarkable 
mechanistic and conceptual input by the “match–mismatch” hypothesis introduced by 
Gluckman and Hanson during recent years (XTab. 20.1). These authors postulated a 
Tab. 20.1: Historical conceptual and semantic milestones in developmental biology, medicine, 
and perinatal programming.

Thrifty Phenotype Hypothesis

Match–Mismatch Hypothesis

246    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
general, even phylogenetically and evolutionary-orientated hypothesis regarding the 
observations of increased vulnerability for diseases of civilization after low birth weight 
or detrimental prenatal conditions (Gluckman and Hanson, 2006, 2008; Gluckman 
et al., 2008).
20.2  A main current focus: The “small baby syndrome” 
and the “match–mismatch” hypotheses
The small baby syndrome hypothesis  was formulated by Hales and Barker (1992) against 
a background of studies that showed that individuals with a low birth weight had an 
increased risk of developing symptoms of the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, 
and cardiovascular diseases in later life. The respective thrifty phenotype hypothesis  
contains the following two premises: ﬁ rst, low birth weight is an indicator for maternal 
and subsequent fetal undernutrition, and second, phenotypical characteristics that lead 
to energy saving should be beneﬁ cial for the individual. Barker and Hales proposed that 
prenatal undernutrition induces decreased insulin secretion along with insulin resis-
tance, which then stays for a lifetime and ﬁ rst goes along with decreased fetal growth. 
Also in later life, this in utero acquired phenotype should be “thrifty”, thereby leading to 
a survival advantage under restrictive nutritional conditions. However, this advantage, 
as they state, turns into its opposite under conditions of abundance, as is the case in 
modern Western industrial societies, thus leading to the metabolic syndrome, type 2 
diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (Hales and Barker, 1992).
Later on, Gluckman and Hanson widened mainly the evolutionary aspect of the 
hypothesis, proclaiming a mechanistic impact of “predictive-adaptive responses”  
(Gluckman and Hanson, 2006, 2008; Gluckman et al., 2008), a semantic that for-
merly has been suggested in developmental psychology (Burchﬁ eld, 1979). Following 
Hanson and Gluckman, the fetus performs reactive adaptations to the intrauterine 
environment, for example, to prenatal undernutrition, the adaptive value of which 
is primarily not an immediate one, but would especially be realized in later life. 
Signals that trigger such fetal responses are claimed to be anticipatory predictors of 
the postnatal environment, in other words, of those conditions that will surround the 
individual after birth and confront him or her for a lifetime. If the prediction of the 
later environment is correct, then, according to Hanson and Gluckman, the respec-
tive adaptations lead to an advantage in survival and reproductive ﬁ tness. If incor-
rect, the adaptations would rather be disadvantageous, ultimately leading to disease 
dispositions. In this sense, Gluckman and Hanson generalized their hypothesis by 
proposing the match–mismatch theory . This theory, or the match–mismatch paradigm, 
says that a mismatch between prenatal developmental conditions and the environ-
ment in later life increases disease risks, while a match would be preventive because 
of beneﬁ cial adaptations to later life conditions (Gluckman and Hanson, 2004, 2006, 
2008; Gluckman et al., 2008).
Already during the 1990s, we and others (Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; Lucas, 
Fewtrell, and Cole, 1999) raised objections against the original version of this theoreti-
cal framework, the thrifty phenotype hypothesis. In particular, we asked whether the 
empirical background of the hypotheses, that is, the underlying data, were analyzed 
and interpreted correctly.

20.2 A main current focus    247
Firstly, most of the studies that investigated the small baby syndrome hypothesis 
did not or not adequately consider the potential role of confounders and/or media-
tors in the association between low birth weight and later diseases (Plagemann and 
Harder, 2005a). In most of the studies, nearly without exception, no adjustments for 
confounders were made, such as, for example, gestational age, parental body weights, 
and maternal diseases during pregnancy. By using absolute cut-offs for low birth weight 
(e. g., < 2,500g), differences resulting from ethnic origin were often neglected. The same 
applies to differences resulting from body composition, while it became clear that even 
low birth weight babies’ risk may result from increased fatness (Yajnik et al., 2003). 
Finally, the potential role of neonatal overnutrition  in underweight newborns, which 
appears very probable, was not considered (Plagemann and Harder, 2005a; Plagemann, 
Rodekamp, and Harder, 2004).
One main problem thus results from the fact that obesity  is the decisive risk factor 
for the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular consequences, that 
is, those outcomes, which are linked to low birth weight. Consequently, and accord-
ing to the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, one would expect that low birth weight is an 
independent risk factor  for obesity in later life. Although consequently proclaimed, this, 
however, is not the case: a systematic review of the literature has shown that up to now 
a linear inverse relation between birth weight and later overweight risk has never been 
found. Instead, 89% of all studies show a linear positive association, which means that 
the higher the birth weight, the higher the overweight risk in later life (Harder et al., 
2007b). A linear inverse relation between birth weight and later type 2 diabetes, which 
is one of the most important predictions of the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, does not 
exist either. By meta-analysis, it could be shown that this relation is U-shaped instead, 
which means that both low as well as high birth weight are associated with increased 
type 2 diabetes risk (Harder et al., 2007a; Plagemann and Harder, 2005a, 2009a).
Concerning the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, a further problem is that up to now no 
experimental model exists that convincingly shows that neonatal underweight after ma-
ternal/prenatal undernutrition is an independent risk factor  for the whole spectrum of dis-
turbances of the metabolic syndrome in later life, as described in epidemiological studies . 
The opposite is the case; our research group and Hales’s group from Cambridge could 
not observe adipogenic or diabetogenic alterations in terms of the metabolic syndrome 
in rats exposed to maternal mal-/undernutrition perinatally (Petry et al., 1997; Plage-
mann, 2001). Even after dietetic provocation with high caloric cafeteria-diet  in adult life, 
simulating modern Western lifestyle, adipogenic or diabetogenic risks were not increased 
(Petry et al., 1997). In this context, a general important problem in the interpretation of 
experimental data, which widely contributed to the establishment and acceptance of 
the hypothesis, is the fact that most of the experimental paradigms did not account or 
adjust for neonatal food supply following maternal/fetal undernutrition. In most cases, 
cross-fostering paradigms were not used, leading to a bias simply produced by reactive 
hyperphagia in dams underfed during pregnancy, which may lead via hypercaloric milk 
composition to overfeeding  of suckling pups. Considering the immaturity of newborn 
rodents, especially concerning the central nervous system, this may lead to a completely 
opposite outcome and outcome interpretation, in which not prenatal undernourishment 
but neonatal overnourishment  is the causal factor for long-term disturbances. Accordingly 
and worthy to note, perinatally undernourished rats have an increased life span, while 
excessive neonatal weight gain decreases life expectancy  (Ozanne and Hales, 2004).

248    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
Similarly, the match–mismatch hypothesis seems to lead to discrepancies, consid-
ering epidemiological, clinical, and experimental data. For example, the exposure to 
maternal diabetes mellitus in utero, which is characterized by prenatal (glucose-) over-
nutrition and pathognomic increase in fetal body weight and body fat, is followed by 
an increased obesity and diabetes risk in later life, not a decreased risk (Dabelea et al., 
2000; Pettitt et al., 1983; Plagemann et al., 1997a, 1997b; Silverman et al., 1991, 1995; 
Weiss et al., 2000). If the match–mismatch paradigm were correct, however, one would 
expect that children of diabetic and/or overweight mothers would be a good example 
for a nearly perfect match between prenatal exposure and later environmental condi-
tions because these children have been exposed to excessive nutrition in utero, which 
is continued later in life. Similar results would be expected in children of overweight 
moms and after increased prenatal stress  exposure, which often leads to preterm birth 
together with a low birth weight. Furthermore, these children are often exposed to 
additional stress in neonatal intensive care units. According to the match–mismatch 
paradigm, they should be adapted nearly perfectly to our modern stressful life. Unfor-
tunately, the opposite is the case. For example, overweight newborns are far from being 
well-adapted to nutritional abundance. Instead, they show increased prevalences of 
overweight, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in later life, even independent 
of their genetic background.
With all due respect but provocatively spoken: according to the aforementioned 
hypotheses, the epidemically increasing overweight prevalence as well as the preva-
lent overnutrition in women of reproductive age should be an effective prophylaxis for 
coming generations. Similarly, the exposure to stress in utero and in neonatal intensive 
care units would be beneﬁ cial conditioning for the modern stressful life, resulting in 
increased tolerance and decreased stress sensitivity. Especially against the background 
of contrary empirical data, serious doubts have to be raised here, which bring into 
question the general principles of the discussed concepts.
Summarizing, there is clear evidence of a phenomenological relation between a low 
birth weight and increased risk for chronic diseases, such as, for example, the metabolic 
syndrome. On the other hand, neither the thrifty phenotype hypothesis nor the match–
mismatch paradigm appear to be appropriate hypotheses to explain these phenomena 
with respect to biomedical mechanisms because they lead to obvious paradoxical, 
 illogical conclusions. While an explanatory rationale in terms of evolutionary pro-
cesses cannot be excluded, these concepts can hardly explain developmental origins 
of health and disease nowadays. Therefore, generalizing these concepts could lead to 
fatal  consequences in developing preventive strategies against diseases of civilization.
20.3  An alternative, integrative, and mechanistic hypothesis 
on perinatal programming
Life is a process of permanent environment-dependent development . Health and dis-
ease risks are determined lifelong in an environment-dependent manner. However, dur-
ing critical developmental periods this may result in lasting effects. This basic principle 
of developmental biology has a long history, as is reﬂ ected, for example, in the pioneer 
work of St. Hilaire (teratogenesis), Stockard (critical period ), Spemann (organizer effect), 
Lorenz (behavioral imprinting), and Ashby (biological self-organization ; XTab. 20.1).

20.3 An alternative, integrative, and mechanistic hypothesis    249
Unfortunately, although the ﬁ eld of developmental origins of health and disease 
(DOHaD) is prospering internationally, these fundamental concepts are often neglected. 
A spanning, universal theory  and conception considering these theories and observa-
tions integratively is still missing. Such a concept should cover the whole spectrum of 
early, environment-dependently acquired characteristics  and disease dispositions both 
in a mechanistic and semantic manner.
Attempting a general, integrative concept, considering available observations and 
hypotheses, it is proposed here that environment-dependent adaptive, predictive re-
sponses (APRs) during critical developmental period s lead to long-lasting epigenomic 
and microstructural programming of fundamental life functions, that is, to perinatal 
programming (Plagemann, 2004, 2005, 2008, 2010; XFig. 20.1).
Note, however, in this concept the proposed APRs are not reactions in terms of an 
early coping strategy aiming to actively cover developmental conditions, as postulated 
by other authors (Gluckman and Hanson, 2006, 2008; Gluckman et al., 2008). Rather, 
they are passive adaptations in terms of vegetative learning processes,  by which the 
developing organism is conditioned, adjusted, and trained qualitatively and quantita-
tively according to the actually given environmental conditions during critical periods 
of development. Thus, also in this concept, there is an adaptive as well as a predictive 
characteristic; however, not in terms of an active coping strategy and anticipation of 
later environmental conditions, but in terms of a passive conditioning by the given 
environment. A long-term disadvantage can, therefore, result both in the case of a mis-
match but also a match between developmental and later life conditions, depending on 
their respective quality and quantity according to an optimal homeostasis. Underlying 
processes of vegetative adaptation and imprinting, respectively, during critical periods 
of self-organization lead to a predictive programming, or malprogramming, of affected 
life functions (programming/malprogramming by APRs).

250    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
In other words, the developing organism experiences and learns the environmental 
conditions during its self-organization process through the perinatal milieu. The organ-
ism learns to handle them regulatively, takes over the regulatory experience from the 
mother, and becomes programmed accordingly. Therefore, one may also speak of a 
vegetative imprinting , thus widening Lorenz’s behavioral imprinting, whereby the 
functional principles of fundamental life functions are learned and determined. The 
perinatal environmental conditions and stimuli are distinguished as standard and more 
or less ﬁ xed, accordingly. Thus, they become a measure, the set point or set range, 
of vegetative functions, regulations, and interactions between the individual and the 
environment. So, the process is more a matter of a passive programming than an active 
reaction of the developing individual. To a greater degree it is a kind of trustful take-
over of vegetative regulatory standards and experiences from the maternal organism, a 
vegetative learning in the womb, which (seemingly) enables an optimal survival in the 
environment into which the organism is born.
In this concept, the causative APRs are generally realized in an epigenomic and/or 
microstructural manner (XFig. 20.1). Epigenomic and microstructural plasticity seem 
to be the decisive features of the self-organizational process of a developing organism. 
They cause a homeostatic calibration  of functional and tolerance ranges at the subcel-
lular level, the cellular level, the organ level, and up to the level of the whole organism. 
All this seems to take place as a physiological, normative process in ontogenesis. How-
ever, as a consequence of unphysiological, adverse, disadvantageous environmental 
conditions during critical developmental periods, this plasticity can also lead to a mal-
programming. Permanent functional disturbances and disease dispositions will result in 
such cases, or when the developmental process results even per se and immediately in 
pathophysiologically relevant disturbances of regulatory processes.
Programming or malprogramming as result of functional modes perinatally acquired 
in that way  can even be carried on intergeneratively via the maternal descendence (see 
Section 20.7). This can simply be realized by the fact that acquired functional character-
istics decisively contribute to the intrauterine environment provided to the developing 
next generation during pregnancy of affected females, thus leading to an inheritance of 
these characteristics in an indirect, not classical genetic way. All this can consequently 
also inﬂ uence phylogenesis  and, over generations, even evolution (Plagemann, 2004, 
2010; see Section 20.7).
20.4  A mechanistic clue: Developmental programming of 
neuro-endocrine and vegetative regulatory systems
The most important and sustainable effects of perinatal programming are likely to occur 
if the decisive regulatory instances of the organism are affected, namely the genome  
and/or the brain . Meanwhile, this has been shown for all basic life functions (me-
tabolism, growth, and body weight regulation; stress response and immune reac-
tions; information processing/exchange and neurobehavior; reproduction). First of all,  
hormone- dependent programming  seems to be of essential importance here (gluco-
corticoids, sexual steroids, insulin, leptin, etc.), potentially causing a malprogramming 
both in case of deﬁ ciency or excess of these internal effectors and intercellular media-
tors during critical developmental periods (Plagemann and Harder, 2009b). Deleterious 

20.4 A mechanistic clue    251
consequences of both increased as well as reduced levels of hormones, resulting from 
altered conditions of the external and internal environment during critical develop-
mental periods, might also explain the common phenomenon of a U-shaped curve in 
the relationship between perinatal and later outcome (see Section 20.7; XFig. 20.7). In 
general, this indicates that hormones, acting as endogenous effectors and mediators of 
environmental signals, may function as “ontogenes”  during development.
A respective pioneering conception of mechanisms of perinatal programming and 
malprogramming has been introduced in the context of Dörner’s functional teratology 
(Dörner, 1975). According to this concept, the regulation of all fundamental life pro-
cesses , for example, reproduction, information processing, immunity, and metabolism, 
is realized by the neuro-endocrine-immune system (NEIS) in its entirety, with differ-
ent subsystems controlling elementary life functions. The central regulator is the brain, 
while hormones, neurotransmitters, and cytokines (as immune cell hormones) act as 
intercellular mediators within this complex system, as well as between the organism 
and the environment (Dörner, 1974a, 1974b, 1975).
According to this concept, the functional and tolerance ranges of neuro-endocrine 
regulatory systems (set point/set range) are determined primarily through the genetic 
material in the neurons of the respective central nervous regulator. This phylogeneti-
cally preset determination, however, can decisively be inﬂ uenced and modiﬁ ed by 
the environmentally induced quantity of the relevant, later on regulated, hormones in 
critical developmental periods . In other words, according to this concept, during early 
ontogenesis a self-organization  of neuro-endocrine regulatory systems of the organism, 
or, respectively, of central nervous regulatory centers – namely in the hypothalamus – 
takes place in dependence of the quantity of hormones, neurotransmitters, and cyto-
kines present during the critical window of development. These effects of hormones as 
functional organizers in the processes of differentiation and maturation are considered 
to be more or less irreversible, leading to a programming of the gene expressibility  of 
the developing neurons. The capacity of transcription and/or the ability of subsequent 
translation were proposed to be preprogrammed during critical periods of neuronal 
development through hormones and neurotransmitters for the lifetime functional period 
in an epigenetic sense (Dörner, 1974a, 1974b, 1975). Accordingly, the classical science 
of teratology , as the discipline of exogeneously induced macroscopic malformations 
(St. Hilaire, 1837), should be supplemented by the science of functional teratology, as 
the discipline of prenatally acquired malfunctions (Dörner, 1975).
Extending and integrating this, former, and current concepts, it should be considered 
that similar mechanisms seem to apply to substrates, metabolites, vitamins, and even 
trace elements, as well as intracellular transcription factors. All their environment-
dependent quantities may also contribute to the epigenomic, microstructural, and lastly 
cybernetic adjustment of functional and tolerance ranges of an organism and its regula-
tory subsystems (XFig. 20.2). Moreover, although the sustainability and importance for 
lasting dysfunctions may particularly result from malprogramming of central nervous 
regulators, similar mechanisms may also occur in peripheral cells, thereby also inﬂ u-
encing the functional and tolerance ranges of affected life processes. The more so, as 
even maintenance of acquired epigenomic alterations during later cell division cycles 
becomes more and more probable (Law and Jacobson, 2010). Finally and accordingly, 
not only do neuro-endocrine and brain-periphery interaction and regulation seem to be 
the subjects of these developmental principles  but so, too, are the regulatory processes

extended according to Dörner, 1975).
During critical phases of perinatal development of the brain and neuro-endocrine-immune network, primary linear, open-loop regulatory 
systems develop to secondarily closed, cybernetic feedback control systems (transformation rule). During this process the functional 
and tolerance ranges of central regulators are preprogrammed especially by the primary quantity of respective hormones, which are 
the secondarily regulated variables. Thereby, hormones act as ontogens, adjusting their own regulatory systems for lifetime functions 
(determination rule). Similar may be realized by the quantity of relevant metabolites, vitamins, trace elements, and so forth, and/or by 
interacting environmental substances and noxes.

of single cells, both in the brain and periphery, leading to an adjustment of cellular 
and subcellular functions in terms of cell integrity and/or vulnerability. In other words, 
environment-depending self-organization may determine the functionality from the 
subcellular up to the level of the whole organism during critical developmental periods. 
All this is likely to form the basis of the complex self-organization of an organism, in 
which the genome functions as hardware , while the complex functional program, the 
software , is ﬁ nally determined by the environmental conditions during critical periods 
of development.
Proposing an alternative semantic, one might therefore also speak of the whole pro-
cess as biocybernetogenesis , considering and contributing to the science of biological 
cybernetics, which currently mainly focuses on higher neuronal and cognitive func-
tions. However, very similar to the proposed supplementation of behavioral imprinting 
(Lorenz, 1935) by vegetative imprinting, biological cybernetics  should in the future 
include more fundamental vegetative life functions and, most of all, should be extended 
to and focused on the development and establishment of cybernetic regulatory systems. 
This process of biocybernetogenesis can be proposed to take place from the cellular up 
to the organismic level in order to ensure an optimal integrative functionality. Hereby, 
the scientiﬁ c approach of biological cybernetics (Ashby, 1947; Wiener, 1948) would be 
and should be extended in terms of the environment-dependent developmental process 
that leads to the functionality, for example, of elementary homeostatic, vegetative regu-
lations. Disturbances of this self-organizing process might be called dysbiocyberneto-
genesis. By altered or disadvantageous environmental conditions during critical periods 
of biological self-organization, dysbiocybernetogenesis  of fundamental regulatory func-
tions seems to be possible from the cellular up to the organismic level, ﬁ nally leading 
to a malprogramming of respective life functions.
20.5  Epigenomic plasticity  as a key mechanism 
in perinatal programming
The speciﬁ c molecular mechanisms of perinatal programming processes are largely 
unknown and a matter of intensive research. In a general manner, potential mechanisms 
have meanwhile been postulated. Among them is the environment-dependent determi-
nation of clonal selection processes in early ontogenesis, as well as of cell numbers, cell 
sizes, and of the organ structures (especially innervation, vascularization, and growth). 
Overall, this contains microstructural adaptations, as well as acquired modes of gene 
expression and gene expressibility (epigenomics). In terms of a lasting inﬂ uence on the 
functioning of homeostatic systems, ﬁ rst of all, the latter seems to be a mechanism that 
has to be regarded as very probable; however, its details are still not clariﬁ ed.
But how could a lasting environmentally induced epigenomic programming  or mal-
programming of gene expressibility during critical developmental periods be realized 
and ﬁ xed for the long term? Against the background of current data on mechanisms of 
lasting DNA modiﬁ cation, one potential and particularly probable and speciﬁ c mecha-
nism of epigenomic perinatal programming shall be outlined brieﬂ y in the following 
(Plagemann, 2004, 2005; Plagemann et al., 2009, 2010).
The bases of the DNA helix can be modiﬁ ed covalently. Mammalian DNA contains 5’ 
methyl cytosine, which has a methyl group at its 5th carbon atom. Methylated cytosines 

254    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
are primarily found within dinucleotide sequences together with guanine, bound to 
it via phosphate groups (CpG; Jaenisch, 1997). These CpGs are not randomly distrib-
uted in the genome, but they are, considering the frequency of occurrence of guanine 
and cytosine, about ﬁ vefold underrepresented and reach their statistically expected 
frequency only in so-called CpG islands (Larsen et al., 1992). In the form of so-called 
non-CpG-methylation, also cytosines outside of CpGs can occur in a methylated form, 
for example, in cytosine/adenine-dinucleotides (Clark, Harrison, and Frommer, 1995). 
From an evolutionary point of view, DNA methylation is a relatively old process in the 
mammalian line (Cooper and Krawczak, 1989). DNA methylation is performed by DNA 
methyltransferases. In turn, methyl groups can also be removed by demethylases from 
the DNA sequence (Bhattacharya et al., 1999), especially during early embryogenesis. 
Here, general demethylation of the genomic DNA takes place, followed by a differenti-
ated de-novo methylation (Razin and Shemer, 1995). The resulting DNA methylation 
patterns are considered to be tissue-speciﬁ c and persisting (Newell-Price, King, and 
Clark, 2001).
At least three arguments legitimate the hypothesis that DNA methylation , as an on-
togenetically acquired permanent modiﬁ cation of the DNA structure and function, is a 
molecular mechanism of perinatal programming processes.
First, methylation of the DNA can lead to permanent, thus lasting changes of gene 
expression. CpG-rich areas of the genome, prone to methylation, are found primarily 
at the 5’-terminal of coding sequences, thus in the promoter region of genes (Bird and 
Wolffe, 1999). It is well-known that the extent of DNA methylation in promoter regions 
is strictly inversely correlated to the expression of the upstream gene (Andria and Simon, 
1999). In this context, it can be expected and postulated that during critical periods of 
early programming processes the actual binding of transcription factors, which depends 
on the given environmental conditions, can affect methylation pattern at the respec-
tive transcription factor binding sites simply by inﬂ uencing their accessibility. In turn, 
this may contribute to complex epigenomic organization and, thus, programming or 
malprogramming of the respective promoter. This may establish the promoter activity  
for the long term.
Second, and in accordance with the ﬁ rst point, the methylation of DNA sequences 
is known to be environment-dependently inducible. Patterns of DNA methylation 
can be inﬂ uenced by exogenous factors or, respectively, changes of the internal/
intrauterine milieu. Especially, it is known that nutritive changes can lead to changes/
alterations of the DNA methylation state. One possible mechanism may be that due 
to nutritional conditions, methyl groups are simply available in different amounts. 
These methyl groups, however, can induce DNA methyltransferases  or increase 
their enzyme activity (Rees et al., 2000), thereby increasing methylation in DNA 
sequences.
Third, a possible role of DNA methylation in programming processes is supported 
by the fact that it is considered to be more or less irreversible after cell differentiation  
is completed (Razin and Shemer, 1995). A characteristic and decisive feature of pro-
gramming processes is, however, that their consequences persist for the long term. This 
should naturally be of special importance for tissues and cells that are no longer (or not 
to a considerable amount) divisible in later life (terminal cells), such as, for example, 
neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), which functions as the decisive regulatory 
center of all fundamental life functions after perinatal development.

20.6 For example: Fetal and neonatal overnutrition    255
Indeed, during recent years ﬁ rst observations addressing and conﬁ rming the proposi-
tion of epigenomic changes resulting from environmental inﬂ uences in fetal and neo-
natal life were reported from experimental investigations, including their functional 
relevance for later life. Pioneer work came from the group of Meaney, showing altered 
methylation pattern in the promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor  and estrogen receptor  
in the rat hypothalamus and hippocampus due to altered rearing conditions, obviously 
predisposing to altered stress response and behavioral changes later on (Champagne 
et al., 2006; Weaver et al., 2004). Moreover, blood pressure regulation could be linked 
to acquired promoter methylation in genes of the adrenal gland, liver, and heart of 
prenatally malnourished rats (Bogdarina et al., 2007, Burdge et al., 2007; Ding et al., 
2010). Recently, we could demonstrate acquired modiﬁ cations of hypothalamic gene 
promoters  involved in metabolism and body weight regulation in neonatally overfed 
rats (Plagemann et al., 2009, 2010, see section 20.6).
Summarizing, it can be postulated that epigenomic plasticity  and respective adjust-
ment of gene structure and function is a fundamental mechanism of environment-
dependent genomic self-organization  during critical developmental periods. Note, 
acquired microstructural alterations may also occur through epigenetic changes, and 
both mechanisms should be considered to be dynamically linked during the complex 
process of self-organization (XFig. 20.1). Furthermore, also microstructural adaptations 
to early environmental conditions may be of enduring functional relevance. Lasting 
consequences of microstructural dysorganization may especially apply to cases in 
which several organs or organ systems within a fundamental regulatory system are af-
fected as, for example, in metabolic regulations, and/or if tissues of limited postnatal 
cell divisibility are affected (terminal cells), such as central neurons or adipocytes. Thus, 
perinatally acquired hypoplasia  or hyperplasia , for example, in regulatory centers of the 
brain or in adipose tissue, can permanently inﬂ uence the cybernetic balance and the 
functional and tolerance ranges in respective regulatory systems, thereby precondition-
ing the ability to compensate exposures in later life, with the consequence of increased 
or decreased disease dispositions.
20.6  For example: Fetal and neonatal overnutrition – a paradigm 
with practical relevance
Mechanistic evidence for the existence of the biomedical phenomenon of perinatal pro-
gramming originated mainly from the ﬁ elds of reproductive behavior and stress (Dörner 
1975, 1976, 1980; Meaney et al., 1996; Francis and Meaney, 1999), with research 
addressing the signiﬁ cance of altered concentrations of the respective steroid hormones 
(sex steroids, gluco- and mineralocorticoids) during critical periods of perinatal de-
velopment for a permanent malprogramming of the affected subsystems of the NEIS. 
However, the results of clinical investigations and animal experiments on the long-term 
effects of maternal diabetes, neonatal overnourishment, and thereby, perinatal over-
feeding  and hyperinsulinism for the development of the offspring have for a long time 
provided key support for the general concept. Therefore, the previously postulated hy-
potheses and mechanisms on perinatal programming shall shortly be illustrated in this 
almost historical paradigm, namely concerning the consequences of pre- and neonatal 
overnutrition for the long-term regulation of body weight and metabolism.

256    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
20.6.1 Epidemiological and clinical observations
Pregnancy is a diabetogenic situation per se. Women with gestational diabetes  (GD), 
just as pregravid diabetic women, are classiﬁ ed as risk pregnancies, and their offspring 
show increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. The disturbances manifested during 
the neonatal period, apart from a tendency to develop hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubine-
mia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, and so forth, are characterized above all 
by an increased prevalence of macrosomia . This is caused by the virtually pathognomic 
fetal and perinatal hyperinsulinism , which arises from materno-fetal hyperglycemia and 
consequent overstimulation of the fetal pancreatic B cells when maternal diabetes is 
either not diagnosed or treated inadequately (Freinkel, 1980; Pedersen, Bojsen-Moller, 
and Poulsen, 1954).
Similar fetal overfeeding and consequences occur in the case of maternal overweight  
and maternal overnutrition in graviditate (Catalano 2003; Catalano et al., 2009). In all 
these cases, the nutritive and hormonal milieu of the developing fetus during critical 
developmental periods is disturbed in an adipogenic and diabetogenic manner. With the 
concept of malprogramming in mind, it should therefore be a source of serious concern 
that meanwhile about one-third of the women at reproductive age are overweight, and 
more than 10% of all pregnant women develop gestational diabetes, which in most cases 
is not diagnosed and thus not treated. Respectively, it can hardly be a simple coincidence 
that the common diabetes and obesity epidemic meanwhile affects not only adults, but 
also children and even newborns. Mean birth weight and the prevalence of macroso-
mia have increased alarmingly during recent decades (Plagemann and Dudenhausen, 
2010; Plagemann et al., 2008; Rooth, 2003). For many years, however, epidemiological, 
clinical, and experimental studies have shown that affected offspring develop a perma-
nently increased risk to develop overweight, diabetes, and components of the metabolic 
syndrome, even independent of or in addition to genetic dispositions (Claussen et al., 
2008, 2009; Dabelea et al., 2000; Dörner et al., 1984, 1985; Dörner, Plagemann, and 
Reinagel, 1987; Pettitt et al., 1983; Plagemann et al., 1997a, 1997b; Silverman et al., 
1991; Weiss et al., 2000). Similar results seem to apply to increased neonatal weight gain 
accompanied by excessive fat deposition (Dörner, Grychtolyk, and Julitz, 1977; Stettler 
et al., 2002), which regularly should be the consequence of neonatal overnutrition.
But how does all this ﬁ t with the small baby syndrome hypothesis on increased meta-
bolic syndrome risk due to prenatal underfeeding and low birth weight?
Noteworthy, even in the Pima Indian study , a long-term investigation of a North 
American population with a particularly high disposition to diabetes and obesity, it was 
shown very early after introduction of the Barker hypothesis that type 2 diabetes associ-
ated with overweight in adulthood was more prevalent in patients who had been over-
weight at birth, but also in those who were neonatally underweight (McCance et al., 
1994). By means of meta-analysis  of all respective studies beyond that in Pima Indians 
we could conﬁ rm these observations (Harder et al., 2007a), leading to the postulation 
that, in fact, not a linear-inverse but a U-shaped relationship  exists between birth weight 
and later diabetes and obesity risk.
Whereas the pathogenetic context seems more or less obvious for fetal overfeeding 
and neonatal overweight, no clear etiopathogenetic link appears to be established be-
tween reduced perinatal weight and later metabolic syndrome  (Dörner and Plagemann, 
1994; Lucas et al., 1999; Plagemann, 2006). In particular, it should be emphasized that 

20.6 For example: Fetal and neonatal overnutrition    257
no independent causal link has been shown between low birth weight and subsequent 
obesity, that is, the pathophysiological key for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD) in terms of the metabolic syndrome. It therefore remains to be clariﬁ ed whether 
fetal growth restriction and underweight at birth, per se, or rather the quality and quan-
tity of early postnatal nutrition and resulting weight gain in early infancy are of patho-
physiological signiﬁ cance for the prospective risk. The central pathogenetic importance 
of later overweight is clear, especially within the context of the metabolic syndrome, but 
though a positive correlation has frequently been demonstrated between weight at birth 
and weight or overweight in later life, an independent inverse relationship has never 
been shown (Harder et al., 2007b). Increased weight gain in neonatal life, on the other 
hand, leads to increased disposition for obesity in later life (Dörner et al., 1977; Stettler 
et al., 2002). It also seems remarkable that increased weight gain in early childhood, in 
particular in underweight newborns , leads to early manifestation of insulin resistance 
(Crowther et al., 2000; Fewtrell et al., 2000). Finally, it has been variously shown that 
increased weight gain in early childhood is a predictive factor for a disposition to the 
metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk in adulthood, in particular in the case of 
low birth weight (Eriksson et al., 1999; Forsén et al., 1999; Vanhala et al., 1999).
However, do all these phenomena and associations express an acquired obesity and 
diabetes disposition due to perinatal overfeeding  and consequent malprogramming?
Already in the 1970s it was shown in a cohort of 4,000 diabetic patients that type 2 
diabetes was inherited more frequently through the mother than the father (Dörner and 
Mohnike, 1976). The offspring of a mother with diabetes during pregnancy shows an 
increased tendency to become overweight or obese already in childhood (Plagemann 
et al., 1997a), accompanied by disturbances of glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and 
insulin sensitivity (Silverman et al., 1995; Plagemann et al., 1997b). It is particularly 
noticeable that these alterations may occur even independently from genetic inﬂ uences 
and the type of maternal gestational hyperglycemia (Dabelea et al., 2000; Pettitt et al., 
1983; Plagemann et al., 1997a, 1997b). However, they do show marked correlations 
with fetal metabolic alterations, especially the degree of fetal and perinatal hyperin-
sulinism  (Harder et al., 2001b; Kohlhoff and Dörner, 1990; Plagemann et al., 1997b; 
Silverman et al., 1995). In particular, a positive correlation was found between the 
level of amniotic ﬂ uid insulin or perinatal hyperinsulinemia and an increase in relative 
body weight and the risk of impaired glucose tolerance  (IGT) in later life for children of 
diabetic mothers (Plagemann et al., 1997b; Silverman et al., 1995). Moreover, normal-
ization of fetal insulin led to normalization of later diabetic risk (Silverman et al., 1995). 
This strongly indicates a persisting inﬂ uence of fetal hyperinsulinism  on the long-term 
outcome, in the sense of a hormonally initiated malprogramming.
20.6.2 Experimental observations
Food intake, body weight, and metabolism are decisively regulated by hypothalamic 
nuclei (XFig. 20.3A) and neuropeptides, which are expressed there under control of the 
circulating satiety signals  insulin and leptin (XFig. 20.4A). Studies in experimental models 
of maternal gestational diabetes and neonatal overnutrition have shown that this regula-
tory system realizes complex microstructural and epigenomic adaptations to perinatal 
overnutrition, with the consequence of permanently increased obesity and diabetes dis-
position (diabesity), even independent of genetic risk. Thus, in the sense of microstructural 

258    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
plasticity and malprogramming, for example, a persisting neuronal hypoplasia  of the 
ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) occurs, which functions as a satiety center, 
and simultaneously pancreatic B-cell hyperplasia and adipocyte hyperplasia  are induced 
(XFig. 20.4C; Aerts and Van Assche, 1979; Aerts, Vercruysse, and Van Assche, 1997; Dörner 
and Plagemann, 1994; Harder et al., 2001a, 2003; Knittle and Hirsch, 1968). Moreover, this 
is accompanied by relevant epigenomic alterations, induced through perinatal overnutrition 
(XFig. 20.4B; Plagemann et al., 2009, 2010). Exemplarily, these consequences of peri-
natal overnutrition for the acquired phenotype and function of the hypothalamo-adipo- 
pancreatic system shall be brieﬂ y outlined and discussed in the following.
Animal experiments have conﬁ rmed early that maternal gestational hyperglycemia 
and subsequent fetal hyperinsulinism may lead to overweight, impaired glucose toler-
ance, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance  in the juvenile and adult offspring, even 
irrespective of any genetic disposition (Aerts and Van Assche, 1979; Aerts, Holemans, 
Fig. 20.3: Long-term consequences of temporary intrahypothalamic insulin excess in newborn 
rats. (A) In the hypothalamus of newborn rats, insulin was applicated by implants immediately 
neighboring nuclei, which regulate body weight throughout later life (3V, 3rd ventricle; IMP, 
implant; LHA, lateral hypothalamic area; VMN, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus), while in 
controls the insulin-free vehicle was applicated only. (B) Intrahypothalamic insulin treatment led 
to overweight, hyperinsulinemia, and impaired glucose tolerance in adulthood (*p < 0.01;

20.6 For example: Fetal and neonatal overnutrition    259
and Van Assche, 1990; Dörner et al., 1988; Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; Oh et al., 
1991). Experiments using maternal and/or neonatal glucose and/or insulin infusion to 
rodents and primates (Bihoreau et al., 1986; Cha, Gelardi, and Oh, 1987; Susa et al., 
1992), and even embryo transfer experiments (Gill-Randall et al., 2004), have clearly 
corroborated these observations.
A permanent inﬂ uence on the differentiation and function of pancreatic B cells  through 
perinatal overstimulation has been proposed, on the one hand, as an etiopathogenetic 
mechanism of this prenatally acquired malprogramming. In particular, hyperplasia and 
hyperactivity could be demonstrated in the offspring, leading in the long term to impair-
ment of insulin secretion (Aerts et al., 1990). On the other hand, studies have shown 
that permanent alterations of neuroendocrine and vegetative functional systems play 
a key etiopathogenetic role here (Dörner et al., 1988; Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; 
Plagemann, 2004, 2005, 2008; Plagemann et al., 1998, 1999b). Thus, the experimental 
induction of gestational hyperglycemia leads not only to perinatal hyperinsulinemia but 
also to increased insulin concentrations within the immature brain , especially the hypo-
thalamus, that is, the key regulator of body weight, food intake, and metabolism (Plage-
mann et al., 1998). Intrahypothalamic elevation of insulin also occurs in neonatally 
overfed rats (Plagemann et al., 1999c). In both models, this is followed by morphologi-
cal characteristics of permanent, that is, lifelong dysplasia of neuropeptidergic hypotha-
lamic controllers of metabolism and body weight (Plagemann et al., 1998, 1999c). In 
particular, this affects the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus  (VMN), which develops a 
permanent dysplasia, neuronal hypotrophy, and disturbed function as a result of the ex-
posure to increased insulin concentrations during critical periods of early development 
(Davidowa and Plagemann, 2001; Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; Dörner et al., 1988; 
Heidel, Plagemann, and Davidowa, 1999; Plagemann et al., 1999a). Furthermore, as 
an expression of perinatally acquired hypothalamic resistance to the peripheral satiety 
signals insulin and leptin, there is a permanent dysorganization and malfunction of 
speciﬁ c neuropeptidergic neurons in the arcuate hypothalamic nucleus  (ARC). Particu-
larly important seems to be an increased activity and number of neurons that express 
the orexigenic peptides galanin and neuropeptide Y  (Plagemann et al., 1998, 1999d), 
while the number and function of anorexigenic neuropeptidergic neurons becomes 
permanently decreased (Davidowa, Li, Plagemann, 2003; Franke et al., 2005). All this 
is accompanied by and correlated to a permanently increased disposition to diabetes 
and obesity, hyperphagia, overweight, basal hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and 
IGT. Noteworthy, similar alterations have been observed in offspring of rat dams with 
diet-induced obesity during pregnancy (Kirk et al., 2009). It should be emphasized that 
both clinically and experimentally these disturbances occur even independently of the 
birth weight and can also be observed in animals experimentally treated with insulin 
in neonatal life, applicated either peripherally or only intrahypothalamically (Dörner 
and Plagemann, 1994; Dörner et al., 1988; Harder et al., 1998; Plagemann, 2008; 
Plagemann et al., 1992a, 1992b; XFig. 20.3).
Even type 1 diabetes susceptibility is increased after exogenous insulin treatment of 
newborn rats (Plagemann et al., 1992a, 1992b), as well as in the offspring of diabetic 
mothers. Multiple low dose streptozotocin  (STZ) treatment is a well-known model for 
type 1–like diabetes in rats, accompanied by cell-mediated immune responses that 
closely resemble the autoimmune processes associated with infantile type 1 diabetes 
in the human. In offspring of gestational diabetic mother rats, basal hyperinsulinemia 

260    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
from birth into adulthood, indicating persisting basal overstimulation of the pancreatic 
B cells and, most important, a severe insulin-deﬁ cient type 1–like diabetes after a single 
low dose STZ treatment were observed (Dörner et al., 1988). Conﬁ rmingly, the offspring 
of mother rats with gestational diabetes responded to multiple low dose STZ treatment 
with increased spleen cell cytotoxicity  to syngeneic B cells (Dörner et al., 1990).

fetal/neonatal overnutrition (*p0.05; means / SEM)
Fig. 20.4: For example – The hypothalamo-adipo-pancreatic system (A). Due to overnutrition 
during critical periods of early neonatal development, permanent epigenomic (B) and 
microstructural (C) alterations are induced: acquired hypermethylation of catabolic/anorexigenic 
gene promoters in central regulatory centres (B); acquired neuronal hypoplasia in central satiety 
centers (hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus, VMN), and, simultaneously, pancreatic B-cell 
hyperplasia and adipocyte hyperplasia (C; references and explanations: see text).

20.6 For example: Fetal and neonatal overnutrition    261
All this points toward a hormonally and nutritionally induced complex malpro-
gramming, induced due to pre- and neonatal overfeeding, hyperglycemia, and hyper-
insulinemia, of the neuro-vegetative control system of body weight and metabolism, 
occurring independent of the genetic background, irrespective of birth weight, and 
leading to an overall increased metabolic risk in terms of diabesity.
Again, however, the question arises: how does all of this ﬁ t with the Barker hypothesis 
and the match–mismatch paradigm?
With respect to the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, investigations on the small baby 
syndrome frequently use animal models of maternal underfeeding during gestation and 
lactation, which experimentally leads to intrauterine and neonatal growth restriction  in 
the offspring (Petry et al., 1997). However, it should be noted that even under extreme 
famine  conditions in humans birth weight is hardly affected (Stanner et al., 1997; Stein 
et al., 2004). Moreover, detailed examination of the results on long-term effects obtained 
with animal models indicates that no consistent congruence with the observations after 
low birth weight in humans exists (Neitzke, Harder, and Plagemann, 2011). Thus, for 
example, animal experiments have shown that offspring born to rat dams that were 
malnourished during gestation and lactation do not become overweight later on but 
rather show a lifelong persistence of low weight. This is associated with a permanently 
reduced food intake (Petry et al., 1997). The animals predominantly show increased in-
stead of decreased glucose tolerance. In contrast to the metabolic syndrome in humans, 
hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance do not occur, but rather lower insulin secretion. 
All these ﬁ ndings persist even after dietary provocation  in later life (Moura et al., 1997; 
Petry et al., 1997). Moreover, in this animal model an increased life span was observed 
(Ozanne and Hales, 2004), which hardly ﬁ ts with the proposed increase in metabolic 
and cardiovascular risk (Plagemann, 2006). However, if rapid neonatal weight gain was 
induced, a reduced life expectancy  could be observed (Ozanne and Hales, 2004).
Accordingly, we have postulated that transition from fetal undernutrition  to early 
postnatal overfeeding could play a key role in the etiopathogenesis of the small baby 
syndrome (Dörner and Plagemann, 1994), especially because it seems quite possible 
that low weight neonates, also in the crucial epidemiological studies, had been overfed 
and possibly even fattened in neonatal life. Similar hypotheses on the possible signiﬁ -
cance of the early postnatal nutrition and rapid neonatal weight gain for the long-term 
outcome of underweight neonates have since been formulated by many other authors, 
including Hales and Barker (1992; Eriksson et al., 1999; Fewtrell et al., 2000). Mean-
while, rapid neonatal weight gain , which mainly seems to be attributable to absolute 
or relative overnourishment, is an established risk factor to explain the small baby syn-
drome (Monteiro and Victora, 2005; Stettler et al., 2002), thereby conﬁ rming our earlier 
data and concepts (Dörner and Plagemann, 1994).
The inﬂ uence of early postnatal overnutriton on later metabolism and body weight 
has often been investigated using the small litter model . Rats that are overfed in the early 
postnatal period by reduction of the primary litter size show phenotypic alterations 
through juvenile age into adulthood, such as overweight, hyperphagia, glucose intoler-
ance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, and increased blood pressure, which correspond 
in critical aspects to those of the metabolic syndrome in humans (Boullu-Ciocca et al., 
2005; Plagemann et al., 1992b, 1999c). This is all the more remarkable because clini-
cal ﬁ ndings suggest that early postnatal overfeeding in humans also predisposes for an 
increased risk of diabesity and the metabolic syndrome in later life (Dewey et al., 1993; 

262    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
Dörner et al., 1977; Harder et al., 2005; Plagemann and Harder, 2005b, 2011). But here 
too the pathophysiological causes and mechanisms are not clear.
As mentioned, neuropeptidergic hypothalamic centers play a key role in the regula-
tion of food intake, body weight, and metabolism (Bouret, 2010). Note, very similar to 
offspring of diabetic dams, neonatally overfed rats show persisting dysorganization and 
malprogramming of these regulatory systems, including malfunction of the VMN 
and resistance of the ARC to the circulating satiety signals insulin and leptin (Davidowa 
and Plagemann, 2000, 2001, 2007), possibly explaining their neonatally acquired long-
term risk in terms of a neuro-vegetative malprogramming (Plagemann, 2004, 2005, 
2008; Plagemann et al., 1999c, 1999d).
Moreover, neonatally acquired hypothalamic leptin and insulin resistance seems to 
be, at least in part, due to nutritionally induced alterations of DNA methylation patterns 
of the promoter regions of genes encoding critical players in the respective hypotha-
lamic circuits  (XFig. 20.4B). Especially, we could show increased methylation of the 
insulin receptor promoter in the hypothalamus of neonatally overfed rats (Plagemann 
et al., 2010). In parallel, a speciﬁ cally changed methylation pattern was found in the 
promoter of the most important anorexigenic neuropeptide , proopiomelanocortin  
(POMC). Here, activating transcription factor binding sites became hypermethylated 
(upstream Sp1, NF-kappaB), while inactivating transcription factor binding sites were 
found to be hypomethylated (nGRE), leading to a lack of upregulation of POMC expres-
sion despite marked hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinemia. The extent of hypermethyl-
ation was shown to depend upon neonatal glucose levels (Plagemann et al., 2009). This 
speciﬁ c constellation indicates a methylation pattern acquired through overnutrition 
and elevated glucose during the critical neonatal developmental period. Similar was 
observed for the insulin receptor promoter  (Plagemann et al., 2010). For the ﬁ rst time, 
by these observations epigenomically induced alterations due to nutritional changes 
and overfeeding in perinatal life could be demonstrated. Especially important seems 
to be the observed correlation with the degree of glycemia for acquired methylation 
patterns. Note, in vitro studies have demonstrated induction of DNA-methyltransferases 
by high glucose concentrations (Chiang et al., 2009). Therefore, early hyperglycemia 
might initiate an intraindividual vicious circle by causing increased promoter meth-
ylation , especially of insulinergic genes, ﬁ nally leading to further increase of glucose 
levels, and so on (XFig. 20.6A). Hypothetically, this could be an important mechanism 
in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance over the life span. Accordingly, these data are 
of paradigmatic pilot character regarding epigenetic mechanisms , which may initiate 
and mediate long-term consequences of an altered perinatal milieu and, moreover, an 
altered environmental milieu throughout life leading to epigenomic causes of diabesity 
pathogenesis. This might have wide-ranging paradigmatic implications not only for 
perinatal programming but also etiopathogenesis and the aging processes, in general 
(Plagemann et al., 2009, 2010).
Thus, complex epigenomic and microstructural malprogramming acquired due to 
perinatal overfeeding may predispose an individual to permanent hyperphagia, obesity, 
hyperleptinemia, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance, 
that is, all decisive components of the metabolic syndrome. These observations could 
provide mechanistic explanation for epidemiological–clinical phenomena, both regard-
ing consequences of maternal diabetes/obesity as well as neonatal overfeeding in terms 
of excessive fat deposition  (XFig. 20.5).

20.6 For example: Fetal and neonatal overnutrition    263
20.6.3 Conclusions
Altogether, these observations, interpreted critically and integratively, show that over-
nutrition during pre- and neonatal development can lead to a complex microstructural 
and epigenomic malprogramming in terms of the triggering noxa (overnutrition), and to 
a respective conditioning according to this exposure. Overnutrition and the accompa-
nying metabolic and hormonal alterations seem to be recognized as a standard by the 
developing organism. A respective programming, in this case malprogramming, occurs. 
This observation seems to be of paradigmatic relevance for an overall understanding 
of perinatal programming phenomena and mechanisms, which may lead to a passive 
conditioning, ﬁ xing the early experiences in terms of respective homeostatic regulations 
for the long term (see Section 20.2).
Note, even increased disposition to insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes  may be prepro-
grammed in this way (Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; Dörner et al., 1984, 1985, 1987, 
2000). Here, once again the complex malprogramming of the NEIS is probably of causal 
signiﬁ cance. Acquired malfunction of the VMN and neuro-vegetative hypothalamo-
pancreatic axis, along with basal hyperglycemia, may lead to permanent basal over-
stimulation of the pancreatic B cells. Permanent basal B-cell overstimulation, however, 
not only contributes to hyperinsulinemia but also to increased autoimmune reactivity  to 
the constantly hyperactive B cells, as typical for endocrine cells (Bottazzo et al., 1988;

264    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
Nerup et al., 1988). Especially in otherwise predisposed individuals and/or together with 
exposure to additional noxae (e.g., viruses), this may result in an increased susceptibility 
even to type 1 diabetes (Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; XFig. 20.5). Remarkably, this 
early proposal has been supported in recent years, especially by acknowledging acceler-
ated growth and overweight in infancy and early childhood as pathogenic factors for the 
manifestation of type 1 diabetes (Wilkin, 2001).
Given that gestational diabetes has meanwhile reached a prevalence surely in excess 
of 10% in the developed industrialized countries, while maternal overweight affects 
more than one-third of pregnancies, it therefore seems urgently necessary that all preg-
nant women are screened for glucose intolerance and adequately treated, as a measure 
of genuine primary prevention .
Furthermore, there is clear phenomenological evidence for a link between reduced 
birth weight and subsequently increased risk in terms of the metabolic syndrome. A 
critical integration of epidemiological, clinical, and experimental observations, how-
ever, may cast doubts on a causal relationship. Anyway, neonatal overfeeding and rapid 
early weight gain together with increased fat deposition and its hormonal consequences 
(hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, etc.) seem to be of long-term pathophysiological 
importance and appear particularly probable in underweight newborns. Therefore, pro-
phylactic recommendations should focus on the recognition, avoidance, and optimal 
treatment of the causes of intrauterine growth restriction (nicotine , alcohol , stress , infec-
tions, gestosis, etc.), and also on the avoidance of neonatal overfeeding, rapid neonatal 
weight gain, and accompanying metabolic and hormonal alterations.
20.7  Intergenerative transmission and prevention 
of perinatally acquired characteristics
From the above discussed phenomena, observations, and mechanisms it seems obvious 
that the perinatal (periconceptional, embryonic, fetal, and neonatal) environment code-
termines the self-organization, functional phenotype, and long-term fate of an organism 
(perinatal programming). Therefore, the important question arises on potential conse-
quences for subsequent generations and how a malprogramming can be prevented, 
occasionally.
First, it should be considered and critically addressed here that there are obvious 
discrepancies between the various observations and explanations currently provided, 
with generally both decreased as well as increased birth weight, under- as well as over-
feeding, and so forth, and generally both decreased as well as increased materno-fetal 
environmental stimuli and developmental challenges, that were linked with a deleteri-
ous long-term outcome (see Section 20.2).
For instance, pre- and neonatal under- as well as overfeeding, going along with peri-
natal hypo- or hyperglycemia, have both been found to predispose for later diabetes 
risk (see previous discussion). Both low as well as high protein supply , pre- as well as 
neonatally, have also been linked with a diabetogenic long-term outcome (Daenzer 
et al., 2002; Petry et al., 1997). Accordingly, both perinatal hypo- as well as hyperinsu-
linemia and hypo- as well as hyperleptinemia have been demonstrated to malorganize 
and malprogram hypothalamic circuits regulating metabolism, food intake, and body 
weight, thereby predisposing for diabesity later on (Bouret, 2010; Bouret, Draper, and 

20.7 Intergenerative transmission and prevention    265
Simerly, 2004; Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; Plagemann, 2008; Plagemann et al., 
1992a, 1999c). Furthermore, both increased as well as decreased exposure to stress-like 
experiences during neonatal life of rats, accompanied by respective activation of the 
hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, lead to altered stress response later in life. 
Similar applies to and goes along with increased or decreased neurobehavioral stimuli, 
realized by neonatal rearing conditions  and maternal care  (Boullu-Ciocca et al., 2005; 
Champagne and Meaney, 2007; Francis and Meaney, 1999; Liu et al., 1997; Spencer 
and Tilbrook, 2009; Van den Bergh et al., 2008). Accordingly, with regard to immuno-
logical stimuli, human studies suggest that both increased as well as decreased perinatal 
exposure to antigens/allergens may permanently alter allergy risk  (Douwes et al., 2008). 
For instance, delayed exposure to allergens, as in the case of late introduction of solid 
food, was shown to increase allergy risk later in childhood (Nwaru et al., 2010). On 
the other hand, increased allergen exposure, as in the case of early cow milk protein  
consumption, may also predispose to allergy and atopic disease later in life (Gdalevich 
et al., 2001).
All these observations speak in favor of a U-shaped relationship between the quantity 
of perinatal developmental stimuli and later functionality, in general. Both decreased as 
well as increased exposure to homeostatic stimuli and variables may lead to a malpro-
gramming. However, there is no contradiction between these seemingly opposite ob-
servations. To the contrary, a common developmental principle seems to underly these 
phenomena, explainable by the necessity of an adequate stimulation by environmental 
conditions and homeostatic variables during self-organization, to ensure adequate 
adjustment of functionality and regulatory integrity later on.
Mechanistic explanations for similar outcomes following opposite perinatal expo-
sures may include the time point, the critical window, during which a deﬁ ciency or 
excess of the respective stimulus occurs (Tzschentke and Plagemann, 2006). Accom-
panying, sequence and combination of developmental exposures are of critical impor-
tance, that is, whether or not a prenatal deﬁ cit is followed by a neonatal overﬂ ow, for 
example, according to nutrition. Moreover, a general explanation might be that in terms 
of a conditioning , a training, both insufﬁ cient as well as overstimulation may lead to a 
disturbed function, with ﬁ nally similar deleterious outcomes. A decreased stimulation, 
conditioning, and training, may result in an insufﬁ cient functional capacity, whereas 
overstimulation may result in a functional injury, that is, a disruption of functionality, 
also leading to an insufﬁ cient function. For instance, both decreased insulin secretion, 
acquired by understimulation of developing B cells (undernutrition, low glucose, low 
amino acids), as well as increased insulin secretion, acquired by early overstimulation 
(overfeeding, glucose mast) and, consequently, insulin resistance at target cells, may 
both result in a diabetogenic disposition. Similarly, both increased as well as decreased 
early stimulation and activity of the HPA axis may lead to an inadequate stress response, 
with very similar vegetative and accompanying disturbances. Both increased as well as 
insufﬁ cient exposure to antigens/allergens  during critical periods of tolerance induction 
may result in a disturbed immune function and auto-immunity , and so on.
It appears plausible that acquired alterations of the regulatory activity of homeostatic 
effectors may result from decreased stimulation and conditioning in early life, on the 
one hand, or acquired resistance to an overﬂ ow of regulatory effectors in consequence 
of overstimulation during critical developmental periods. Both circumstances may lead 
to respective dysfunctions. Exemplarily, hormonal malprogramming  seems to play a 

266    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
critical role if a respective hormone excess or deﬁ ciency occurs, for example, of glu-
cocorticoids, sex steroids, insulin, leptin, and so forth, during critical developmental 
periods. Note, as a classical and fundamental paradigm, both decreased secretion of 
as well as decreased sensitivity (resistance) to hormones lead to similarly disturbed 
functions in terms of hypoactivity and ineffectiveness of the affected system. The same, 
however, may apply to any kind of endogenous effectors involved in the regulation 
of fundamental life functions (hormones, neurotransmitters, metabolites, transcription 
factors, etc.), from the subcellular up to the organismic level. Hereby, a fundamental 
principle of perinatally acquired malfunctions can be proposed, and a fundamental 
explanation is provided for the common phenomenon of a U-shaped distribution  in the 
relationship between perinatal exposures, respective concentrations of developmental 
signals, organizers, and ontogens, and the later outcome.
Also, multidirectional programming and malprogramming and, respectively, multiple 
disorders and multimorbidity have to be considered here. It must be noted that, for 
example, perinatal overfeeding may affect not only later diabesity risk  but directly and 
indirectly also reproductive and mental health, behavior, cardiovascular health, aging, 
and even cancer risk (Boullu-Ciocca et al., 2005; Harder, Plagemann, and Harder, 2008, 
2010; Ozanne and Hales, 2004; Plagemann, Tönjes, and Dörner, 1988; Plagemann et al., 
1992b, 1999c; Van Assche et al., 2010). Similar seems to apply to perinatal undernourish-
ment, stress exposure, infections, exposure to environmental toxins, and so forth, all of 
which have been linked to a number of long-term outcomes and disease dispositions. 
Altogether, this implicates the complexity of early environment-dependent self-organi-
zation,  biocybernetogenesis, and long-term programming of fundamental life functions. 
The process is obviously realized in a complex way, by setting an individual proﬁ le of 
interacting homeostatic functional and tolerance ranges, in terms of a microstructural and 
epigenomic ﬁ ngerprint and functional individuality, aiming to integrate environmental 
challenges according to the experiences during critical periods of early self-organization.
Special importance and current attention applies to the question whether program-
ming or malprogramming, especially epigenomically, through environmental inﬂ uences 
is restricted to early developmental periods, or may occur throughout life. This question 
seems to be of critical importance for the whole approach of perinatal programming. 
While there is overwhelming evidence of lasting consequences resulting from exposures 
during critical periods of early development (Stockard, 1921; Tzschentke and Plage-
mann, 2006), epigenomic alterations resulting from later, lifelong gene–environment 
interaction cannot be excluded and seem very plausible, especially as a mechanism 
of aging processes (McGowan and Szyf, 2010; Szyf, this volume). This, however, does 
not affect the long-term impact of early epigenomic and microstructural conditioning, 
leading anyway to long-term predispositions that may initiate and/or increase later vul-
nerability but, most of all, allow a primary, genuine prevention of respective alterations 
acquired during circumscribed time windows of early development.
Again, a fundamental paradigm results here from insights into metabolic development 
and regulation. While hyperglycemia during critical periods of early life has been shown 
epidemiologically, clinically, and experimentally to predispose for later diabesity (see 
previous discussion), increased glucose levels have been linked to hypermethylation  
(Chiang et al., 2009). Acquired alterations of insulinergic promoter sequences have 
been observed after perinatal hyperglycemia (Plagemann et al., 2009, 2010). The result-
ing diabetogenic predisposition may subsequently lead to an intraindividual vicious 

20.7 Intergenerative transmission and prevention    267
circle, with hyperglycemia causing increased methylation of insulinergic promoters, 
ﬁ nally further increasing glucose levels, and in turn, again increasing promoter methyla-
tion, and so on (XFig. 20.6A). Hypothetically, this could be an important mechanism 
underlying not only perinatal programming but progredient pathogenesis of insulin re-
sistance  over the life time, thereby potentially providing a new explanation for diabetes 
pathogenesis, in general (Plagemann et al., 2010).
Moreover, beyond such an intraindividual vicious circle, even an epigenetic intergen-
erative vicious circle can be suggested (XFig. 20.6B). For instance, overfeeding during 
Fig. 20.6: Proposal and general concept of nutrition-dependent epigenomic malprogramming 
leading (A) by hyperglycemia to an intraindividual vicious circle, and (B) an interindividual 
vicious circle of epigenetic diabesity programming and intergenerative transmission through the 
maternal line. Prevention appears to be possible by normalization of food supply in early life.

268    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
critical periods of development leads to an altered accessibility and, thereby, vulner-
ability of CpG dinucleotides within promoters of genes critically involved in the regula-
tion of food intake, body weight, and metabolism. Initially, the resulting alterations in 
promoter methylation  must not necessarily lead to altered transcription but might be-
come pathogenic over time due to additional, synergistically acting adverse exposures, 
such as, for example, hypercaloric nutrition, and so forth. The resulting alterations of 
methylation pattern of respective promoters will ultimately alter their activity and gene 
transcription. Consequently, the affected regulatory systems become functionally inef-
fective, leading to an increased disposition toward obesity, diabetes, and associated dis-
orders. If females affected in that way enter reproductive age and become pregnant, by 
being or becoming in graviditate obese and/or diabetic they will expose their offspring 
again in a similar way to a hypercaloric/hyperglycemic environment during pre- and 
perinatal life that they were exposed to themselves, thereby closing a vicious intergen-
erative circle, leading to an acquired epigenetic disposition to obesity and diabetes in 
the next generation again, and so on (XFig. 20.6B). Such epigenetic mechanisms might, 
therefore, substantially contribute to the global epidemics of diabesity.
Moreover, from these experimentally and empirically founded proposals, a number 
of respective observations, and considering biological plausibility, it can be proposed 
that perinatally acquired conditions and disease dispositions may not only affect the 
F1 generation, but can even be transmitted over several generations of the maternal 
line . Because functional characteristics acquired perinatally may consequently also af-
fect hormonal, metabolic, immunological, cardiovascular, neurobehavioral, and so forth, 
function and vulnerability during a pregnancy, it appears rather self-evidently that these 
acquired conditions may also affect subsequent generations of the maternal line simply 
by affecting in a respective way their developmental conditions in utero, again. Therefore, 
it is no surprise that a number of observations in humans and experimental animals have 
shown an intergenerative transmission of acquired conditions  through the maternal line.
For instance, for many years materno-fetal transmission of acquired diabesity pre-
disposition has been documented, accordingly. Female F1 offspring of gestationally 
diabetic F0 dams spontaneously develop gestational hyperglycemia. In the F2 offspring , 
thereby exposed in utero, this in turn leads to diabetogenic disturbances in later life 
again; therefore, an epigenetic materno-fetal transmission of increased diabetes disposi-
tion is possible through a number of generations in sequence, without any “classical” 
genetic predisposition (Aerts and Van Assche, 1979; Aerts et al., 1990; Dörner and 
Plagemann, 1994; Dörner et al., 1988; Plagemann, 2004, 2005, 2008; Plagemann, 
Harder, and Dudenhausen, 2008).
Even type 1 diabetes susceptibility  can be acquired and intergenerativelly transmitted 
in that way in the offspring of diabetic mothers. In maternal-side F1 and F2 offspring of 
gestational diabetic mother rats (F0) spontaneous gestational diabetes, basal hyperin-
sulinemia from birth into adulthood, indicating persisting basal overstimulation of the 
pancreatic B cells that predisposes for auto-immunity, and, most importantly, a severe 
insulin-deﬁ cient type 1–like diabetes after low dose STZ treatment were observed, in 
contrast to the F2 offspring of control mothers and grandmothers, respectively (Dörner 
and Plagemann, 1994; Dörner et al., 1988, 1990). These experimental data were 
conﬁ rmed by clinical and epidemiological observations, indicating transmission of 
increased diabetes risk, even of type 1 diabetes susceptibility, over several generations 
of the maternal line (Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; Dörner et al., 1987).

20.7 Intergenerative transmission and prevention    269
Remarkably, it has also been demonstrated that perinatally acquired neurobehav-
ioral and accompanying stress–response phenotypes can be transmitted through the 
maternal line in a “nongenetic” way to the F2 generation (Francis and Meaney, 1999). 
Perinatally acquired predisposition to reproductive malfunction has also been proposed 
to pass through the maternal descendence (Plagemann et al., 1988). Similarly, it has 
been suggested that a perinatally acquired increased risk of atopy can be transmitted via 
altered breast milk composition to the maternal-line offspring of the next (F2) generation 
(Huurre et al., 2008).
Taken together, animal experiments as well as human studies speak in favor of the 
possibility and probability that perinatally acquired characteristics  and disease dis-
positions, resulting from the environmental conditions during critical periods of early 
life, can be transmitted through the maternal line in a nonclassical, nongenetic way 
of epigenetic inheritance, simply by decisively determining the in utero and perinatal 
conditions of subsequent generations (XFig. 20.7). Obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular 
disorders, atopy, behavioral alterations, stress vulnerability, and so forth, have been 
shown to follow and are attributable to these mechanisms. An intergenerative transmis-
sion  via several generations of the maternal line of perinatally acquired characteristics 
is thereby possible, without involvement of classical genetic inheritance (XFig. 20.7).
Most recently, however, epigenetic transmission  has been proposed to occur even 
trough the paternal line. While materno-fetal transmission by repeated in utero expo-
sures over generations to in utero acquired conditions seems biologically plausible, and 
mechanistically veriﬁ ed, intergenerative transmission of acquired conditions through 
the paternal line remains questionable, and rather unexplainable today. At least re-
garding the transmission of acquired diabetes risk, experimental data are controversial 
here (Dörner et al., 1988; Dörner and Plagemann, 1994), as well as epidemiological 
observations (Dörner et al., 1987). On the other hand, recent experimental and epi-
demiological data seem to support an epigenetic transmission of acquired metabolic 
risks even through the paternal line  (Ng et al., 2010; Kaati, Bygren, and Edvinsson, 
2002; Pentinat et al., 2010). Responsible mechanisms have not been suggested but 
would necessarily imply and require epigenomic modiﬁ cation of the germ cell line and 
subsequent transmission and expression of respective alterations in the offspring, phe-
notypically. Whether and how this may be realized remains to be veriﬁ ed. Interestingly 
enough, however, paternal body weight and diet, for example, have been suggested to 
affect the offspring risk over generations of developing obesity and associated metabolic 
disturbances in rodents (Ferguson-Smith and Patti, 2011). Obesity in humans has been 
shown to affect sperm quality and the likelihood of DNA damage (Kasturi, Tannir, and 
Brannigan, 2008), while a paternal high fat diet in rodents has been observed to affect 
B-cell function in the offspring, accompanied by some epigenomic alterations (Ng et al., 
2010). Whether and by which epigenomic mechanisms an intergenerative transmission 
of acquired characteristics may pass through the paternal line remains to be established.
Howsoever, here, at the latest, considering the variety of observations on inter- and 
multigenerative transmission of acquired conditions , the question arises on whether 
these processes may inﬂ uence beyond ontogenesis  even phylogenesis , and evolution. 
And the answer appears to be yes. Because perinatal programming may affect the 
phenotype and health risks for generations, at least of the maternal line, an inﬂ uence 
over generations for phylogenesis appears rather self-evidently. Moreover, all critical 
and basic principles of the synthetic evolutionary theory seem to be covered by the

processes, mechanisms, and outcomes realized through perinatal programming, that 
is, environment-dependent determination and selection of phenotype and genotype, 
affecting, realized by, and transmitted trough reproduction and, thereby, contributing to 
an intergenerative transmission of characteristics (Mayr, 1942).
Interpreting and considering these aspects integratively, it seems mandatory to propose 
that the processes of perinatal environment-dependent development and programming, 
representing gene – environmental interaction in a fundamental and sustainable way for 
generations, may contribute even to the process of natural selection and, thereby, evolu-
tion (Darwin, 1859). Consequently, however, the proposal of inheritance of acquired 
conditions (Lamarck, 1809) should be re-estimated in the light of these recent obser-
vations and mechanistic insights in perinatal programming and epigenetics. If these 
phenomena and mechanisms are veriﬁ ed, this will lead to a fundamental extension of 
not only developmental medicine and perinatology but also developmental biology , 
in general. Occasionally, implications go back to Lamarck (1809), whose concepts did 
originally not only decisively inﬂ uence the work and theories of Darwin (1859) but also 
seem to gain now a mechanistic dimension, possibly leading to a renaissance of these 
so far unexplainable ideas and concepts.
Finally, from the previously illustrated and discussed aspects, the important question 
arises on practical consequences for human health, especially in terms of prevention. 
Worthy to note, already in 1974/1975, repeated and redeﬁ ned since then continuously, 
general thesis and recommendations on pre- and neonatal prevention  of perinatally 
acquired health risks have been suggested by Dörner in a pioneer manner (Dörner, 
1974a, 1975, 1976, 1980, 2000). In essence and summarized (Plagemann, 2004, 
2005; Plagemann and Dudenhausen, 2008), these include the following major points, 
recommending the avoidance and/or adequate correction/treatment during critical 
 developmental periods of
x quantitative and/or qualitative malnutrition,
x infection and/or inadequate immune challenges,
x cardiovascular challenges and/or disorders,
x distress and/or maternal deprivation,
x exposure to drugs and disrupting medication, and
x  exposure to environmental toxins, xenobiotica, radiation, and environmental 
chemicals.
Although appearing rather general, these seemingly very common recommendations 
imply a number of concrete approaches for basic research and, already today, very 
concrete and substantial recommendations of improvement and implementation of 
respective public health  measures and policies in perinatal medicine (XFig. 20.7).
Exemplarily, once again, exposure to hyperglycemia and overfeeding, pre- as well 
as neonatally, have been convincingly shown to increase diabesity risk for generations. 
Even genetically determined risks have been shown to be decisively modiﬁ ed by early 
nutritional conditions. While beneﬁ cial rearing conditions are capable of reducing 
genetic burden, genetically inconspicuous traits may become pathogenic through 
perinatal overfeeding (Gorski et al., 2006; Levin, 2000, 2010; Reifsnyder, Churchill, 
and Leiter, 2000; Schmidt et al., 2000, 2001). Thus, perinatally acquired dispositions 
probably decisively contribute to the global increase in overweight, diabetes, metabolic 
syndrome, and subsequent cardiovascular diseases, which are hardly explainable by 

272    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
classical genetic dispositions. However, in contrast to classical genetic dispositions, ac-
cessibility to a genuine, primary prevention becomes possible here. Avoiding overweight 
already before conception, avoiding overweight and overfeeding during pregnancy, en-
suring adequate physical activity  during pregnancy, diagnosing and adequately treating 
glucose intolerance in pregnant women on the basis of a universal diabetes screen-
ing in graviditate , as well as avoiding neonatal overnutrition, especially by providing 
exclusive breast-feeding  during the ﬁ rst 4 to 6 months of life, are simple as well as 
appropriate measures of perinatal primary prevention and, therefore, should strongly 
be recommended, promoted, enabled, and practiced (Dörner and Plagemann, 1994; 
Plagemann, 2004, 2008; Plagemann and Dudenhausen, 2010; Plagemann, Harder, and 
Dudenhausen, 2008; Plagemann et al., 2008).
Accordingly, a number of respective epidemiological, clinical, and experimental data 
have been accumulated, clearly demonstrating the possibility, effectiveness, and mech-
anistic explanations of preventive measures to avoid long-term malprogramming and 
resulting health risks. By elegant epidemiological studies it could be convincingly dem-
onstrated that avoiding and/or adequately correcting maternal overweight  (Kral et al., 
2006; Smith et al., 2009) and maternal diabetes  during pregnancy effectively prevents 
increased diabesity risk in the offspring, even of several generations, including type 1 
diabetes susceptibility (Dörner et al., 1984, 1985, 1987, 2000; Dörner, Rodekamp, 
and Plagemann, 2008). Prevention of fetal hyperinsulinism was demonstrated to be 
of critical importance (Silverman et al., 1995). All of this could be conﬁ rmed in ex-
perimental models, and prevention of hormonal malorganization of hypothalamic 
regulatory systems has been shown in a variety of approaches to be crucial for pre-
ventive effects (Bouret et al., 2004; Davidowa, Ziska, and Plagemann, 2006; Franke 
et al., 2005; Harder et al., 2001a, 2003; Vickers et al., 2005). Accordingly, prevention 
of neonatal overfeeding has been demonstrated to be of long-term beneﬁ t for metabolic 
health, both by clinical–epidemiological studies (Dörner et al., 1977, 2008; Harder 
et al., 2005; Plagemann and Harder, 2005b, 2011) as well as mechanistically by re-
spective experimental models (Fahrenkrog et al., 2004; Gorski et al., 2006; Patterson 
et al., 2010). Similar preventive effects and mechanisms should be regarded concerning 
cardiovascular, immune, neurobehavioral, and so forth, challenges and dysfunctions, 
including reproduction, cognition, behavior, and even malignant growth (XFig. 20.7).
Beyond famine  in the third world and developing countries, absurdly, obesity is prob-
ably the most challenging health problem in the developed world at the beginning of 
the 21st century. Overweight is the most important cause of the metabolic syndrome, 
including a number of accompanying and subsequent health problems. Approximately 
one-third of adult humans in the highly developed Western countries are suffering from 
the metabolic syndrome and its components. Accordingly, about one-third of women 
at reproductive age are overweight, while surely more than 10% are suffering from ges-
tational diabetes. However, most gestational diabetics are not adequately treated, with 
deleterious consequences for the health of mother and child, simply for the fact that 
no universal screening to diagnose glucose intolerance is considered and performed 
according to respective public health policies . Considering, on the other hand, that the 
overall costs of obesity have been estimated to exceed US$ 140 billion per year in the 
United States in 2008 (Finkelstein et al., 2009), while the sex- and age-adjusted risk of 
developing diabetes and obesity was found to be increased up to 7-fold in offspring of 
mothers with diabetes during pregnancy (Claussen et al., 2008; Dabelea et al., 2000; 

20.8 Synopsis    273
Pettitt et al., 1983; Plagemann et al., 1997a, 1997b; Silverman et al., 1995; Weiss et al., 
2000), the potential dimensions resulting from disadvantageous developmental con-
ditions during critical periods of early life become impressively obvious, considering 
only this very prominent and challenging entity and example. Chances and challenges 
of perinatal medicine by implementing and providing primary preventive measures 
become exemplarily clear here.
Summarizing, perinatal programming is a critical and essential part of ontogenesis, 
affecting health and disease risks for the whole life span. Perinatally acquired char-
acteristics can even be transmitted to subsequent generations. In biomedicine , this 
opens enormous chances and challenges of a genuine perinatal prophylaxis to the 
beneﬁ t of individuals and societies. In a politically sensible, responsible, and even 
pragmatic way this should start to be realized now, on the basis of an integrative 
interdisciplinary evaluation and estimation of relevant perinatal risk factors acting 
globally during perinatal life, for example, famine, overfeeding, infection, exposure 
to xenobiotica  and environmental toxins , materno-fetal distress, and so forth. This 
could and should immediately be practically reﬂ ected, concerning the fate of future 
generations.
Already in the 1980s, it was paradigmatically shown that the long-term deleterious 
consequences of exposure to a diabetic intrauterine environment may run over several 
generations of the maternal line - and can be prevented. From these data, accompanied 
by respective experimental observations, in 1987 we proposed that “an epigenetic 
transmission  of acquired conditions appears to be possible over several generations 
(epigenetic transmission rule)” (Dörner et al., 1987) and, most of all, appears to be 
accessible to primary prevention  by providing an improved perinatal environment 
and/or adequate correction and normalization of perinatal developmental conditions. 
Meanwhile, these early proposals seem to have been veriﬁ ed, conﬁ rmed, extended in a 
variety of important aspects, and even generalized.
20.8 Synopsis
Today, the ﬁ eld of perinatal programming prospers enormously, and international 
research activities are increasing rapidly. Epidemiological, clinical, and experimental 
studies from a number of well- and newly established working groups, departments, 
and institutions nearly worldwide are aiming to identify long-term health  risks resulting 
from the prenatal and neonatal environmental conditions. Many disadvantageous or 
even harmful conditions have been identiﬁ ed, spanning, for example, from pre- and 
periconceptional maternal nutritional and body weight dysbalance through materno-
fetal exposure to stress, infection, xenobiotica, and cardiovascular dysregulation up 
to inﬂ uences of peripartal and neonatal medication, rearing conditions, and mal- or 
overnutrition. Increased offspring risk may result, to develop metabolic, cardiovascular, 
allergic, mental, reproductive, and even malignant diseases, especially those that are 
related to the modern Western life style. All this appears to be a fundamental mecha-
nism and reﬂ ection of gene–environment-dependent phenotype establishment during 
critical periods of early biocybernetogenesis and, respectively, development-dependent 
determination of disease risks, which may occur in addition to, interacting with, or even 
independent of classical genetic dispositions (XFig. 20.8).

274    20 Toward a unifying concept on perinatal programming
Accordingly, it appears legitimate and necessary to propose a supplementation of 
the general etiopathology , which should include environment-dependent determina-
tion of the functional phenotype during critical periods of life as a third, distinct aspect 
and burden in the determination of diseases and disease dispositions , beyond and in 
addition to environmental and genetic factors acting per se throughout life (Plagemann, 
2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010) (XFig. 20.8). Most importantly, in contrast to classical 
genetic diseases  and dispositions, resulting from mutations  and so forth, here we may 
ﬁ nd chances of implementing a primary, genuine prevention for the long term through 
detecting, avoiding, and/or adequately treating relevant exposures and disturbances 
during critical developmental periods. This unravels important new challenges for peri-
natal medicine and health policies, which should be seized to the beneﬁ t of future 
generations. Finally, already today it can be predicted that these and further ﬁ ndings in 
developmental biomedicine, epigenetics, and environment-dependent programming of 
genotype and phenotype will probably revolutionize our classical view on ontogenesis, 
phylogenesis, and even evolution .
