Panprotopsychism Instantiated
ABSTRACT: The problem of many-over-one asks how it can be that many properties
are ever instantiated by one object. A putative solution might, for example, claim
that the properties are appropriately bundled, or somehow tied to a bare
particular. In this essay, the author argues that, surprisingly, an extant candidate
solution to this problem is at the same time an independently developed
candidate solution to the mind-body problem. Speciﬁcally, what is argued here
to be the best version of the relata-speciﬁc bundle theory—the thesis that each
instance of compresence has a special intrinsic nature in virtue of which it
necessarily bundles its speciﬁc bundle-ees—is also a species of Russellian
monism,

Introduction
There is a potentially powerful connection between the mind-body problem and the
problem of many-over-one that, to my knowledge, until now has gone unnoticed.
The mind-body problem concerns how the mind, in particular phenomenal
consciousness (which I call here consciousness), relates to the physical body. For
example, it is notoriously puzzling how the property of feeling pain could be
instantiated by an entirely physical object, such as the nervous system. The
problem of many-over-one concerns how properties (the many) relate to a given
object (the one) that instantiates them (Fuhrmann : ; Rodriguez-Pereyra
; Ehring : n). Sure, one electron has charge, mass, and spin—three
distinct properties. But how? Is the electron just some amalgam of its properties?
Is it some construction of its properties plus some non-property entity, such as a
bare particular? Or are there not really any properties, but just predicates,
concepts, classes, resemblances, or fusions instrumental for classifying the electron?
The unnoticed connection between the problems concerns a pair of candidate
solutions. The ﬁrst, Russellian monism, addresses the mind-body problem.
According to Bertrand Russell ([] ), fundamental physical entities are
intrinsically qualitatively special such that, when appropriately conﬁgured, they

necessitate the obtaining of phenomenally conscious states in macro structures like
humans, where the relevant specialness outstrips standard physical theory. Rather
than try to deﬁne ‘fundamental’ or ‘intrinsic’, I offer the following rough glosses:
Let
‘F’
name
your
favorite
structuring
relation
relevant
to
metaphysical
explanation, perhaps grounding, dependence, essence, or the like. Now—helping
myself to plural quantiﬁcation—let the fundamentalia be the entities xx such that,
for all entities yy that are not one of xx, it is not the case that the nature or
existence of xx is explained by any of yy bearing F to xx. As for ‘intrinsic’, the
standard ﬁrst approximation sufﬁces: an object’s intrinsic properties are those that
it has independently of disjoint objects.
Russellian monism comes in two varieties: panpsychist and panprotopsychist.
The former holds that the special intrinsic properties are themselves consciousness
properties; the latter denies this. Although I brieﬂy touch on panpsychism, my
primary focus is on panprotopsychist Russellian monism.
The second candidate solution, ‘relata-speciﬁc’ bundle theory, addresses the
many-over-one (Maurin ; Wieland and Betti ). On this approach,
objects are bundles of properties or property instances, the latter of which may be
tropes (that is, qualitatively ﬁne-grained property instances, where properties are
not universals); for an object to possess a property F is for F (or an F trope) to be
in the relevant bundle; and a given bundle exists, qua bundle, as a necessary result
of the existence and intrinsic nature of a primitive bundling relation instance. I
characterize relata-speciﬁc bundle theory disjunctively as between properties
(which may be universals) and tropes in the interest of ontological neutrality.
The advertised connection is intimate: the best available version of relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory is a species of panprotopsychist Russellian monism. For the
qualitatively special instances of the primitive bundling relation that the best
version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory deploys to explain metaphysically the
instantiation of fundamental physical properties by fundamental physical entities
also

the

of
phenomenal
consciousness properties by macro physical structures.
Notice that the payoff is principally metaphysical: a credible theory of general
property instantiation turns out to contain a built-in explanation of how physical
systems (broadly construed) ground consciousness properties. Whether the
resulting picture also helps close the epistemic gap between the mind and the body
is less clear, although certain ways of answering afﬁrmatively are defensible.
One motivation for Russellian monism concerns conceivability and causal
closure (Chalmers ). Unlike orthodox physicalism, Russellian monism is
untouched by the zombie argument (Chalmers ) and the knowledge
argument (Jackson ), since, on an appropriately liberal conception of
physical properties, it entails that zombies and Jackson’s Mary are inconceivable:
your physical duplicates are thereby your phenomenal duplicates, on this
conception, and Mary’s knowing all physical facts would entail, by universal
elimination, her knowing each phenomenal fact. Moreover, unlike dualism,
Russellian monism straightforwardly accommodates the intuition that the physical
realm is causally closed and yet mentality is causally efﬁcacious. For according to
Russellian monism, macro mental properties are determined by the fundamentally
PA N P ROTO P S Y C H I S M

physical (still broadly construed) just as much as any macro physical properties are so
determined, yet the latter are causally efﬁcacious.
One motivation for relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is that it yields an elegant
solution to Bradley’s regress, according to which contingent relations obtain only
in virtue of further contingent relations obtaining, and so on ad inﬁnitum (Bradley
; Maurin ; Wieland and Betti ). For if the unique qualitative nature
of each particular bundling relation instance primitively necessitates the bundling
of its relata (some of which are contingent relations/properties) then no other
relation is needed to explain contingent relation or property instantiation. (For
expository purposes, I apply ‘Bradley’s regress’ loosely throughout to several
similar problems about how relations relate. I do not claim precise representation
of the historical F. H. Bradley.)
If the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is a species of Russellian
monism, then these motivating features aggregate. Namely, a candidate solution
to the many-over-one and Bradley’s regress is, when appropriately constrained,
also a candidate solution to the mind-body problem that avoids zombies, Mary,
and causal exclusion. Thus friends of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory and Russellian
monism alike have reason to welcome the proposed connection as dialectically
promising.
With that said, it is not my goal to argue for Russellian monism or relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory. Any worthwhile defense of either theory would require more space
than I have here. Nor do I claim that the motivations for the relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory version of Russellian monism are all and only the motivations for more
traditional Russellian monism. The thesis is that the best version of relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory does everything required of a theory in order to be a species of
Russellian monism; sound arguments for this thesis need not look like familiar
arguments for Russellian monism. Moreover, while I argue that the best version of
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is a version of Russellian monism, I do not argue that
the best version of Russellian monism is a version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory.
I believe antecedent proponents of Russellian monism should consider endorsing
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory Russellian monism, but I do not argue that they are
forced to do so under power of theoretical advantage. My goals are only to show
that Russellian monism and relata-speciﬁc bundle theory connect in the way
described and to explore some consequences of the connection. (It bears
mentioning, however, that it is an open question whether the dialectical
advantages that David Chalmers attributes to Russellian monism are independent of
the many-over-one. I suspect both that they are not and that their preservation
motivates relata-speciﬁc bundle theory Russellian monism, precisely because of
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory’s modal force. Bradley’s challenge prompts inquiry into
whether the special intrinsic properties posited by Russellian monism, the relevant
physical dispositional structures, and the (non-relata-speciﬁc bundle theoretic)
instantiation or compresence instances assumed to tie the properties with the
structures, all could have existed without interrelating as per Russellian monism,
thereby calling into question whether those properties ground those structures. Since
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory’s modal force preempts this question, relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory may well be of dialectical service to Russellian monism.)

For readers unsure about the importance of Russellian monism and relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory, I point to their respective literatures. Chalmers (, ), Philip
Goff (), and numerous others motivate Russellian monism along the lines
described above. Motivation for relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is less well known,
but still robust. For example, relata-speciﬁc bundle theory qua solution to
Bradley’s regress is motivated by default once one rejects () property nominalism
and () David Armstrong’s states of affairs ontology, the latter of which attempts
to preempt Bradley’s challenge by making particulars-instantiating-universals
fundamental. After all, the remaining competitive ontologies of properties—
bundle
theories
and
substance-attribute
theories—must
address
Bradley’s
challenge. To see that the default case is there to be made, notice that many, including
Armstrong (, ), have argued forcefully against property nominalism, and
that others, including one of the original developers of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory,
Anna-Soﬁa Maurin (, ), have argued forcefully against Armstrong’s states of
affairs ontology. Granted, resemblance nominalism and mereological nominalism have
proven more resilient than Armstrong’s early arguments against them indicate (see
Rodriguez-Pereyra ; Efﬁngham ). But those two interesting positions remain
objectionable. Resemblance nominalism requires commitment to Lewisian modal
realism, and makes a tomato’s possession of redness turn on what Santa hats are like.
Mereological nominalism entails that (part of) redness tastes like wine and (or) sounds
like a cardinal and is incompatible with mereological junk, a structure every element of
which is a proper part of some others (Bohn ).
. Russellian Monism and Panprotopsychism
Recent interest in Russellian monism is due largely to Daniel Stoljar and Chalmers,
who have inﬂuentially clariﬁed the relationship between physicalism and Russellian
monism (Stoljar ; Chalmers ). Below I follow the framing and updated
terminology of (Chalmers ), which builds up to panprotopsychist Russellian
monism by ﬁrst discussing panpsychist Russellian monism.
Let ‘microphenomenal’ properties be those that panpsychists attribute to
fundamental physical particles as the realizers/role players of fundamental physical
dispositional structure. Let ‘constitutive Russellian panpsychism’ name the view
that microphenomenal properties metaphysically explain consciousness in macro
entities like humans. In Chalmers’s terminology, the ‘microphenomenal constitutes
the macrophenomenal’, where ‘constitutes’ is cashed out in terms of grounding.
Without getting into the contemporary grounding debates, I take the key features
of ‘constituting’ properties to be that their instances are () qualitative, in a sense
relevant to explanation, () spatiotemporally conﬁgurable, and () metaphysically
responsible—in part because of their qualitative nature—for the exempliﬁcation of
certain other properties. So F properties are constitutive of G properties just in
case the intrinsic qualitative nature of appropriately spatiotemporally conﬁgured F
instances is responsible for the exempliﬁcation of G with respect to the relevant
conﬁguration. I will not try to deﬁne ‘qualitative’, but the basic idea is that
qualitative properties are not essentially concerned with speciﬁc individuals;
rather, they confer resemblance, causal, or other individual-independent statuses
PA N P ROTO P S Y C H I S M
I N S TA N T I AT E D


onto their bearers. Thus being the best supporting actor is qualitative, but being
Morgan Freeman is not. The focus on intrinsic qualitative nature reﬂects the
explanatory element of grounding, as opposed to less clearly explanatory relations
like supervenience. As Jaegwon Kim () and Stephen Schiffer ()
independently noted decades ago, supervenience need not be tied in any
explanatory way to the qualitative natures of the subvening or supervening
properties. In the case of grounding, by contrast, the qualitative nature of the
ground and grounded are typically assumed to be explanatorily important. I
take it that one reason Chalmers appeals to ground in characterizing ‘constitutes’
is that Russellian monism is supposed to be explanatory, not merely modally
adequate.
Still following Chalmers, let ‘panprotopsychism’ name the view that fundamental
physical
entities
exemplify
‘protophenomenal’
properties,
which
are
()
non-phenomenal; () nonstructural (which involves being both intrinsic [as opposed
to extrinsic] and categorical [as opposed to dispositional]); () capable of
constituting macrophenomenal properties; and () such that truths about them a
priori entail truths about the phenomenal properties that they constitute. Let
‘constitutive Russellian panprotopsychism’ name the view that the protophenomenal
properties
of
fundamental
physical
entities
constitute
all
macrophenomenal
properties and are the realizers/role players of fundamental physical dispositional
structures. Although I continue to use Russellian monism for convenience, it is
constitutive Russellian panprotopsychism that interests me below, and of which I
argue that the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is a species.
Notice that if physics concerns only dispositional structures—what Chalmers
calls ‘narrow’ physical properties (and much like what Stoljar [] calls
‘t-physical’ properties)—then Russellian monism is not a form of physicalism, for
it invokes categorical properties—what Chalmers calls ‘quiddities’—to ground
physics. However, if physics concerns both dispositional structure and the
realizers/role players relevant to the structure—what Chalmers calls ‘broadly’
physical properties—then Russellian monism is a form of physicalism. As
Chalmers emphasizes, this issue is largely verbal. The dialectical features I note in
the introduction, by contrast, are substantive: on the broad conception of
physicality, Russellian monism rules out zombies and Mary as inconceivable and
yet leaves room for phenomenal properties to be causally efﬁcacious without
violating the causal closure of the physical. Since Russellian monism requires the
broad conception, it enjoys these beneﬁts.
. The Relata-Speciﬁc Theory of Instantiation
The relata-speciﬁc theory of instantiation (relata-speciﬁc bundle theory) is a version of
bundle theory developed as a solution to Bradley’s relation regress (Bradley ;
Maurin ; Wieland and Betti ; see also MacBride ). The basic idea
underlying Bradley’s regress is that relata x and y are related by contingent relation
Ronly if some further contingent relation R—for example, instantiation—relates
x and y to R. Otherwise, qua contingent, Rcould exist alongside both x and y
without relating them. Given this basic idea, however, some yet further contingent

D A N I E L
G I B E R M A N
https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

relation Ris needed to relate Rto Rand x and y, prompting an explanation for how
Rrelates its relata, and so on.
Bundle theorists treat property instantiation in terms of a bundling relation
among universals or tropes. Let ‘C’ (for ‘compresence’) name this relation. It is
convenient to treat property and relation instances here as tropes, although they
could also be instances of universals. (I remain ontologically neutral, but often
speak of tropes.) Either way, it is crucial to recognize that these property and
relation instances are spatiotemporally located particulars. This is standard for
trope theory (see Williams ; Campbell ; Ehring ), but also is
commonplace for universal bundle theories (see, for example, O’Leary-Hawthorne
and Cover ). After all, if the compresence relation instances were not
spatiotemporally located, then it would be unclear why any universal properties
or relations should be spatiotemporally located, or immanent. For once we are
willing to accept non-spatiotemporally-located entities in our metaphysics of
properties of material objects, we may as well be Platonists about universals, given
Platonism’s apparent advantages with respect to semantics, mathematics, and
modality (see Bealer ; Carmichael ). Yet Platonic or transcendent
universal ontologies are discordant with bundle theory, since material objects are
not bundles of non-spatiotemporal entities. Let there be no confusion, then, about
talk of intrinsic, qualitative natures of compresence relation instances: such
instances are just as spatiotemporally located and particular as Mont Blanc, and
just as ﬁt to bear intrinsic, qualitative natures.
Thus the bundle theorist’s solution to the many-over-one is that many properties
are instantiated by one object just in case they or their tropes are bundled by an
instance of C. For example, the bundle theorist’s (noncausal) explanation for my
car’s being green, rather than red, is that the car is a property bundle that contains
a greenness trope rather than a redness trope; and it contains the greenness trope
because the latter is bundled with the car’s other tropes by a C instance. The
problem from Bradley’s regress, then, is to explain why some C instance alone is
sufﬁcient to bundle the greenness trope in the car bundle. After all, it would seem
that the greenness trope, the C instance, and the car’s other greenness-independent
tropes could all have existed without the C instance bundling them, unless
perhaps some further C instance were around, in which case the problem simply
regenerates.
Relata-speciﬁc bundle theory’s key explanatory claim is that C instances are
primitively natured to be fundamentally relata-speciﬁc, in that each necessitates
the bundling of its bundle-ees. Given this necessity, no further C instance is
needed to account for the ﬁrst’s bundling success. Thus there is no regress
involving C and any of its relata. For example, the C instance Ccar that bundles
my car’s properties could not have failed to bundle the greenness trope, given ()
Ccar’s speciﬁc nature and () that Ccar exists. Notice, however, that relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory does not entail that if some C instance Cx bundles property
instances Fx and Gx then Cx is necessary for the existence of Fx or Gx. Whether it
is necessary for their exact co-bundling (as opposed to their existence) is an
interesting issue, but not one that I explore here. What matters here is its
sufﬁciency for their exact co-bundling.

In describing relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, Maurin writes, ‘there is something
about a particular compresence-trope that justiﬁes the positing of necessary
connections that, according to the present proposal, hold between it and the
entities that it relates’ (: , Maurin’s emphasis; Maurin’s ‘compresence-
trope’ is roughly synonymous with my ‘C instance’). And Wieland and Betti
explain, ‘if a relation [instance] is relata-speciﬁc, it is in its own nature to relate
speciﬁc relata. Suppose . . . that the relation of standing two feet away R holds
between a and b. Then, if R is relata-speciﬁc, [the instance of] it [that] relates a
and b [does so] as soon as it exists’ (: ). I added the interpolation because
I assume that Wieland and Betti—like Maurin—are principally concerned not
with a relation per se, but with instances of a given relation. For their view surely
is not that a and b are related as soon as R exists. That is clearly false: c and d
(each distinct from each of a and b) might be related by R at some world that does
not contain a and b whatsoever. What matters for relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is
the instance of R that in fact relates a and b.
Thus whatever the ‘something about’ a C instance is, it is unique to that C instance
—whether qualitatively unique or merely numerically unique. Simply being some
compresence trope or other is insufﬁcient. Neither Maurin nor Wieland and Betti
explicitly say that the unique ‘something about’ or ‘nature’ of a given C instance is
an intrinsic, categorical, qualitative feature of the C instance, as opposed to being
extrinsic
or
relational,
dispositional
or
structural,
or
non-qualitative
or
haecceitistic.
However,
I
argue
below
that
charity
motivates
the
former
interpretation. More importantly—since exegesis of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory’s
early developers is not my interest—the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory requires that the crucial bundle-explaining feature of a given C instance is
intrinsic, categorical, and qualitative.
The case for intrinsicality is straightforward. If the ‘something about’ the C
instance were extrinsic to it then the C instance alone would be insufﬁcient for
bundling. But the guiding claim of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is precisely that a
given C instance alone is thusly sufﬁcient. Intrinsicality is further supported by
Wieland and Betti’s talk of the relevant nature being the C instance’s ‘own’, and of
the C instance necessitating the bundling ‘as soon as it exists’.
One might object that a C instance’s dependence on its relata indicates a lack of
intrinsic nature. But this is a confusion. A relation instance’s dependence on its relata
need not preclude intrinsic nature. Suppose a fundamental force bonds two particles;
that bonding instance has an intrinsic nature informed by the relevant force, its
dependence on its relata notwithstanding.
The case for categoricity proceeds by dilemma. To begin, note that if a given C
instance’s bundle-explaining nature is dispositional, the relevant disposition must
be a bare disposition (one not based in categorical properties of the C instance),
lest intrinsic categoricity be crucial to the bundling status of C instances. Now, if
the relevant ‘nature’ of a given C instance is dispositional, then either it manifests
essentially (ﬁrst horn) or not (second horn). If it does (perhaps with the bundling
itself being the lone manifestation condition), then the resulting bundle theory says
that a categorically bare particular (a C instance) explains bundling, that this bare
C instance is essentially ﬁt to unify a certain group of properties into an object,

D A N I E L
G I B E R M A N
https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

and that it is primitively numerically distinct from other such bare uniﬁers of
properties. While this is not mainstream bare particular theory (since it ties each
bare uniﬁer to a speciﬁc group of properties essentially), it does violate bundle
theory’s prohibition on particulars whose categorically bare particularity is
essentially disposed to unify properties into objects. Suppose, then, that the
putatively dispositional C instance does not manifest essentially (second horn). It
follows that something outside the C instance is required in order for the C
instance
to
explain/necessitate
bundling,
namely,
the
satisfaction
of
the
manifestation conditions. This is inconsistent with the claim that the C instance
bundles its relata as soon as it exists, since it could then be exempliﬁed without its
manifestation conditions being met, thereby prohibiting bundling.
To make the key feature structural in some more general way prompts the
question of why the particular categorical instantiator(s) of the structure in
question enables the bundling, as opposed to some other categorical instantiator(s).
The question then arises of whether some further relation is needed to explain that
this instantiator is at work. Yet this is just the kind of question that relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory is supposed to answer, not to generate.
The case for qualitativeness is more complicated. Consider material objects a and
b. Let a be a bundle of three tropes F, G, and H, bundled by C instance C; and let
a, F, G, H, and Call be exactly located at location l. Let b be a bundle of the
tropes F, G, H, and K(each distinct from each of F, G, and H), bundled by
C instance C; and let b, F, G, H, K, and Call be exactly located at location
l(distinct from l). The following question is the sort that relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory is supposed to answer: what ultimately explains why no K trope is bundled
with F, G, and H? Following Maurin and Wieland and Betti, the relata-speciﬁc
bundle theorist’s answer is that there is ‘something about’ C—its ‘own nature’—
that necessitates its bundling exactly F, G, and H, and thus not Kor any other
K trope. We have already seen that this ‘something about’ Ccannot be the
general qualitative nature of compresence, since both Cand Chave that general
nature, and yet Cdoes nothing to explain why there is no bundle consisting
exactly of F, G, H, and some K trope. Rather, the relevant ‘nature’ of Cis its
‘own’—it is unique to C.
The argument that C’s unique nature must be qualitative proceeds by elimination
of alternatives. I see three competitors worth considering. According to the ﬁrst, the
relevant ‘something about’ Cis () its being exactly located at l; according to the
second it is () some unique non-qualitative but constituent ‘nature’ that
primitively individuates Cfrom Cand all other tropes; and according to the
third it is () a brute fact—one not dependent on anything intrinsic to C—
securing that Cis distinct from C. (A referee suggests as a fourth option a brute
fact that does depend on some non-qualitative nature of C. Below I argue that
option () fails because bundle theory prohibits such natures. This fourth option
faces the same problem.)
Each of these competitors fails. lcannot do the job unless it is the only possible
location for C. Otherwise, there are worlds at which Cis located at another
location and yet still bundles F, G, and H(since it bundles exactly those tropes
whenever it exists), which would undermine the claim that C’s location at l
PA N P ROTO P S Y C H I S M
I N S TA N T I AT E D

https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

determines its bundling power. But there is little reason to think that the best version
of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory requires each C instance to have its location
essentially. This would be unmotivated and ad hoc unless one required all tropes
to have their locations essentially, which is prohibitively controversial. Moreover,
even if F, G, and Hwere assumed to be essentially located at l, it is possible
for them to be bundled with more tropes at lthan there actually are. Consider a
world that consists only of land its contents at that world, and at which F, G,
H, and a fourth trope Kare co-bundled at l. This is a plausible possible world,
since
its
description is
schematic
and
contains no logical
or conceptual
incoherence. Now, according to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, the world in
question must contain a C instance to account for the fact that F, G, H, and K
are bundled. But the only available exact location for this C instance, by
stipulation, is l. Yet the C instance in question cannot be numerically identical
with Csince the latter necessarily bundles exactly F, G, and H(to the
exclusion of K) ‘as soon as it exists’. Thus the C instance doing the bundling at
the relevant world cannot be C, and yet is located at l. Consequently, being
located at lcannot be that in virtue of which Cis the bundler of exactly F, G,
and Hat the original world described.
Nor can the relevant ‘something about’ Cbe alternative (): a non-qualitative
constituent ‘nature’ that is primitively responsible for C’s individuation. For
bundle theory denies that tropes or universals possess haecceities, bare particulars,
or any other such primitive individuators as constituents. Moreover, alternative
() prompts the question of why that haecceity or bare particular is the one that
necessitates the bundling of exactly F, G, and H, rather than some other. The
answer must be that there is ‘something about’ that haecceity or bare particular,
which could not then be some non-qualitative constituent, since haecceities and
bare particulars lack further haecceities and bare particulars.
Nor can the ‘something about’ Cbe alternative (): a brute fact involving C,
which obtains independently of the intrinsic status of C. Relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory would then have no way to distinguish worlds where C instances bundle
certain tropes from worlds that do not. Indeed, alternative () allows that there is
some possible world w qualitatively exactly like the actual world, yet entirely
devoid of electrons. To see this, suppose that for every C instance at the actual
world that bundles the tropes of an electron, w contains a qualitatively identical
but brute-ly numerically distinct C instance, which bundles exactly two tropes: ()
the unit negative charge trope that at the actual world belongs to the electron in
the relevant location, and () the Eiffel Tower’s wrought iron trope. Call a
material object whose only two tropes are (a) the wrought iron trope of the Eiffel
Tower and (b) a unit negative charge trope at some non-zero distance from the
Eiffel Tower, an iron-tron. The actual world contains many electrons but no
iron-trons, while w contains many iron-trons but no electrons. Yet the two worlds
are, ex hypothesi, exactly the same in their spatiotemporal distributions of
qualitative properties (setting the sortal concepts electron and iron-tron aside),
including in their (qualitative) distribution of C instances. But this is unacceptable.
If one’s answer to the many-over-one requires worlds qualitatively exactly like
ours to lack electrons, it is mistaken.

To be sure, even if the ‘something about’ each C instance is a unique qualitative
feature, there is much in common between the actual world and some nearby
iron-tron world. However, in the qualitative case there are qualitative differences
that offer the proponent of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory an explanation of why the
two worlds have different objects. Relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is hardly alone in
invoking some sui generis qualitative features precisely for explanatory purposes.
Perhaps it is surprising that the reason electrons do not exist in some world w*,
even though it contains exactly the actual world’s spatiotemporal distribution of
unit negative charge and other familiar properties, is that w* is missing some of
the actual world’s distinctively metaphysical and sui generis qualitative C
instances. But I submit that it is far more surprising to be told that w from the
preceding paragraph lacks electrons as a matter of brute fact.
So concludes the argument that the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory
requires the
unique
features of
C instances
invoked
as the
fundamental
explanantia of bundling to be intrinsic, categorical, and qualitative. In short, these
features cannot do the explanatory work assigned to them unless they are intrinsic
and categorical, and they cannot do it well unless they are qualitative. Ultimately,
then, a C instance’s qualitative nature cannot just be the determinable nature of
being a compresence instance. It must be a qualitatively unique determinate of
that determinable. Thus the relata-speciﬁc bundle theory ontology is in a certain
way highly liberal, since for each case of bundling (at least at the fundamental
level), it requires a qualitatively unique C instance. Consequently, it requires a
great
multitude
of
qualitatively
unique,
fundamental
bundling
instances:
compresence instances in spacetime that are each intrinsically qualitatively distinct
from every other. As an anonymous referee notes, this multitude marks a
departure from traditional Russellian monism, according to which fundamental
property instances fall under a relatively small number of types that function as
the building blocks of consciousness and physics. The departure is anodyne,
however, since it is not crucial to panprotopsychist Russellian monism to hold
that fundamental property instances align into repeatable types. Moreover, the
departure is modest, since the universal uniqueness claim is compatible with
groupings into types whose members co-resemble well enough to ﬁt the building
block story, even though they do not co-resemble exactly. After all, qualitative
distinctness across determinates within a determinable may be quite subtle, as
with distinct mass quantities that vary only inﬁnitesimally. Relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory requires no more qualitative variety across C instances than that.
Although neither Maurin nor Wieland and Betti focus on the issue, the
relationship between a C instance and its bundle-ees on the version of
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory that I have articulated matches the currently working
notion
of
ground,
whereby
something’s
spatiotemporal
conﬁguration
and
qualitative nature necessitates—in virtue of that nature—something else’s existence
or nature. For a given C instance’s unique intrinsic, categorical, qualitative nature is
precisely what necessitates the bundling, and thus the instantiation, of its bundle-ees.
And, while those bundle-ees might be capable of independent existence (more on this
shortly), the best metaphysical explanation for their being as they are right now—
namely, co-bundled where they are co-bundled—is that the C instance exists as it
PA N P ROTO P S Y C H I S M
I N S TA N T I AT E D

https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

does right now. Why is my particular car green? That is, why does that trope/
universal bundle contain that greenness constituent, in the sense of ‘why’ relevant
to fundamental metaphysics? Relata-speciﬁc bundle theory answers: Because a
certain C instance exists with the unique qualitative nature that it has. Since there
is nothing special here about my car or greenness, the case generalizes: all
property instantiations obtain because of some or other C instances having the
unique qualitative natures that they primitively and respectively have. Thus the
best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory entails that the world’s collection of C
instances makes up the fundamental explanatory metaphysical level, insofar as it
explains why everything is qualitatively distributed as it is.
One might object that since a given C instance cannot exist without its bundle-ees
existing, and yet they can exist without it, the bundle-ees are no less fundamental
than the C instance, which dampens the claim that C instances ground their
bundle-ees. But this is a confusion: x can ground y even if y could exist in the
absence of x, so long as in the latter case some z of the same relevant kind as x is
around to ground y. Compare the perdurantist claim that a certain temporal part
x of persisting object y grounds the fact that y once had property F. The truth of
that claim does not rule out the possibility that y be F at some past time even in
worlds where x never exists. Such worlds simply require some other past temporal
part of y to be F. Still, according to perdurantism, x grounds and explains y’s past
F status.
Perhaps the real worry behind this objection is that some actual bundle-ees might
have existed without being bundled at all, and thus might have existed in the absence
of any C instance. For example, many trope theorists accept so-called ‘free ﬂoating’
tropes, which exist unbundled with other tropes (Campbell : ; Ehring :
; see also Giberman on individual tropes as trivial bundles). This would
undercut the above analogy with perdurantism, which rejects the possibility of
persisting objects sans proper temporal parts. Fortunately, however, there is good
reason to expect the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory to require that
even free-ﬂoating property instances obtain only because of some C instances. I
mentioned the key reason why in another context above: bundle theorists do
well to avoid commitment to pairs of worlds with exactly alike distributions
of qualitative property instances but different inventories of electrons. Yet if
the proponent of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory accepts property instances that
ﬂoat free not just of other typical property instances, but also of all C instances,
then she is left with no way to avoid commitment to such problematic pairs of
worlds. By contrast, if she holds that even free-ﬂoating property instances ever
obtain only because of the existence of some speciﬁcally natured C instances, then
she has a direct explanation of why otherwise qualitatively indiscernible pairs of
worlds may differ as to the presence of electrons, namely, that they differ in C
distribution.
One might worry next that relata-speciﬁc bundle theory’s modal claims are
insufﬁciently explanatory, since necessitation is insufﬁcient for explanation. In
response, I reemphasize that according to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, C
instances ground instantiation. They do not merely necessitate it as, say, my
summering in Maine necessitates the number ’s being odd, or Socrates’s

D A N I E L
G I B E R M A N
https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

singleton necessitates his being a member of it if he exists (Fine ). To see this,
consider the following six features of C instances:
. Soundness: all C instances necessitate some property instantiations.
. Completeness: all property instantiations are necessitated by some C
instance or other.
. Sensitivity: altering a C instance would correspondingly alter which
properties are instantiated (at least usually and perhaps always—
recall that extant relata-speciﬁc bundle theorists are not clear about
this).
. Locality: speciﬁc, particular C instances are alone sufﬁcient, at every
world
at
which
they exist,
for
speciﬁc,
particular
property
instantiations.
. Character: each C instance necessitates the property instantiations it
does because of its intrinsic qualitative character.
. Uniqueness: no property other than C is sufﬁcient for all property
instantiations.
By contrast, my summering in Maine’s necessitating ’s oddness is not complete,
sensitive, local, character-based, or unique. Socrates’s singleton’s necessitating his
membership enjoys more of these features, but still not all of them. For example, it
is not plausibly character-based, since it is unclear whether sets even have intrinsic
qualitative character. I conclude that C is no mere necessitator of instantiation. It
explains it.
Before proceeding to the main argument in the next section, it bears noting that
although relata-speciﬁc bundle theory has been developed within the framework
of bundle theory, its main idea is exportable. For example, a substance–attribute
ontology may be ﬁtted with a conception of instantiation qualitatively rich enough
to explain why substances instantiate exactly the attributes that they do. On this
suggestion, instantiation itself is so qualitatively complicated and powerful that it
intrinsically has something to say about all property exempliﬁcations, much like a
noncausal ‘God property’. Granted, the foregoing is a deviant and theoretically
expensive version of substance–attribute theory, but its price is worth considering
if no satisfactory alternative treatment of Bradley’s regress or the many-over-one is
forthcoming. Having acknowledged this option, I continue to focus on bundle
theoretic relata-speciﬁc bundle theory. The present point is that philosophers
interested in the metaphysics of consciousness need not be antecedently committed
bundle theorists in order to take relata-speciﬁc bundle theory seriously.
Indeed, since a given philosopher of mind can dismiss the potential independent
philosophical value of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory only if she is happy to commit to
a metaphysics of properties that independently addresses or sidesteps the
many-over-one and Bradleyan concerns—such as various forms of property
nominalism or (perhaps) states of affairs ontologies—and since these views are all
independently highly controversial (even if defensible), many philosophers of mind
are such that their prudent caution toward the metaphysics of properties leaves no
reason to dismiss the philosophical promise of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory.

. Relata-Speciﬁc Panprotopsychism
The argument that the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is a species of
constitutive Russellian panprotopsychism is an instance of modus ponens with the
following premises:
Premise :
According to the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, some C
instances are at once (a) constitutive of fundamental physical
dispositional structure, (b) constitutive of macroconsciousness, and
(c) protophenomenal.
Premise :
If some of a theory’s proposed property instances satisfy (a)-(c) then
the theory is a species of constitutive Russellian panprotopsychism.
Premise follows from Chalmers’s characterization of constitutive Russellian
panprotopsychism. Below I defend premise by arguing for its conjuncts.
Argument for (a)
According
to
the
best
version
of
relata-speciﬁc
bundle
theory,
every
fundamental-physical-disposition-realizing quiddity F is such that some or other C
instances are required, and certain C instances are individually sufﬁcient, for the
instantiation of F. To see this, notice that C instances are required for bundling and
that fundamental physical dispositions are realized only if some tropes (or
universals) are bundled. Just as importantly, C instances are generally required and
respectively individually sufﬁcient for the dispositions themselves, independently of
any (other) quiddities. For, again, the dispositions are ever present only in bundles
(since bundles are required for any case of instantiation), and C instances are
required for bundling. Thus, according to the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory, C instances have what is important about constituting fundamental physical
structure, namely, their special qualitative nature and spatiotemporal conﬁguration
jointly ground it. (Recall from section that C instances have spatiotemporal
locations, as required by bundle theory’s need to keep its posits in spacetime.)
To sum up: C instances ground fundamental physical structure because ()
fundamental physical structure is grounded by the instantiation of the relevant
physical properties, () the instantiation of those properties is in turn grounded by
the presence and intrinsic nature of the relevant C instances, and () grounding is
transitive. (For a reminder of why () is true, see above in section the discussion
of how C instances’ necessitation of property exempliﬁcation is sound, complete,
sensitive, local, character-based, and unique.)
To reiterate: C instances genuinely ground fundamental physical structure; it is
not the case that the C instances account for bundling the relevant properties only
in the superﬁcial sense that a rope bundles some sticks.Rather, the fundamental
physical properties in question are ever jointly instantiated only because of the
I thank an anonymous referee for this example.


G I B E R M A N

relevant C instances’ existing and having the natures that they do, and the
instantiations obtain exactly as they do as soon as the relevant C instances exist.
No such relationships hold between any sticks and ropes.
The foregoing considerations yield the ﬁrst premise of the argument for (a):
.
According to the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, C instances, due
to their qualitative nature and spatiotemporal conﬁguration, ground the
instantiation of fundamental physical dispositional structure by grounding
the bundling of (and corresponding instantiations of) the properties
relevant to that structure.
The second premise follows from the working notion of ‘constitutive’:
.
If some qualitative property instances, Φx, Ψy, . . ., due to their qualitative
nature and spatiotemporal conﬁguration, ground the instantiation of
another property (or ground the instantiation of a structure by grounding
the instantiation of the properties relevant to it), then Φx, Ψy, . . . are
constitutive of that property (or structure).
It follows by modus ponens that:
a:
According to the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, some C
instances are constitutive of fundamental physical dispositional structure.
There is an important consequence of (a) that bears emphasis at this point: if the best
versionofrelata-speciﬁcbundletheoryistrue,thenphysicscannotbenarrow.Foronthe
narrow conception, dispositional structure does not require any categorical qualitative
ground. However, if the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is true, then there
must be ‘quiddities’ of acertain kind in order for there to be any dispositional structure,
since C instances’ primitive categorical qualitative natures are precisely what the best
version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory deploys to explain how the dispositional
features of the dispositional structure become co-instantiated.
Argument for (b)
Following orthodoxy, let us assume that macrophysical properties like an elephant’s
color and texture are grounded by microphysical properties. According to
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, the microphysical properties are grounded by C
instances. Given the going connection between grounding and constituting, and
given the transitivity of grounding, it follows that, according to relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory, C instances that ground microphysical structure also ground and
constitute macrophysical properties like color and texture. This leads to the ﬁrst
premise of the argument for (b):
Premise .
According to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, the C instancesthat bundle
the properties of microphysical entities are (when appropriately
PA N P ROTO P S Y C H I S M
I N S TA N T I AT E D

https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

grouped and conﬁgured) constitutive of macrophysical properties like
color and texture.
Of course, to say that some properties are constitutive of others does not entail that
the ﬁrst are responsible for the bundling of the second. But in the case of C instances,
this is a natural connection to draw. Suppose some micro entities x, x,. . .xn
compose a macro entity y. Suppose further that the properties of x, x,. . .xn
collectively are constitutive of the macro properties of y, and that, for each xi,
there is a C instance that bundles its properties. Question: What bundles the
macro properties of y? Is the relata-speciﬁc bundle theorist to posit an additional
‘macro’ C instance, entirely disjoint from all C instances that bundle any of x,
x,. . .xn, which is alone responsible for the bundling of y’s macro properties?
Although the issue has not—to my knowledge—been discussed in the young
literature on relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, I submit that the best version of
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory answers this question negatively. That is, the best
version will hold that the C instances that bundle the properties of x, x,. . .xn are
collectively responsible for the bundling of y’s macro properties. Thus there will
be some macro properties such that they are not bundled by a single C instance,
but rather by a plurality of C instances.
The second premise in the argument for (b) utilizes this observation about
collective C instance bundling. The premise follows from the conjunction of two
claims. The ﬁrst is that both macrophysical and macrophenomenal properties are
instantiated by macro entities like humans and elephants. The second is
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory’s central claim (outﬁtted with the allowance of
collective bundling), namely, that relata-speciﬁc C instances are required to solve
the many-over-one:
Premise .
According to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, some conﬁguration of C
instances is required to explain the co-instantiation of macrophysical
properties and macrophenomenal properties in conscious macro
entities.
The third premise builds upon the case for collective bundling made above, offering a
more speciﬁc diagnosis of why relata-speciﬁc bundle theory should not allow
separate macro-bundling C instances:
Premise .
According to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, if the C instances
described in premise () were not numerically identical with the C
instances responsible for fundamental microphysical property
instantiation then relata-speciﬁc bundle theory would lead to
overdetermination,
interactionism,
or
epiphenomenalism
in
accounting for facts about macro properties.
If the identiﬁcation does not hold, then the C instances grounding the microphysical
properties relevant to a given elephant’s physical status would—by premise ()—
determine
the
macrophysical
properties
of
the
elephant,
and
yet
those

D A N I E L
G I B E R M A N
https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

macrophysical
properties
would
also
(separately)
be
determined
by some
numerically
distinct
C
instance
that
determines
the
co-exempliﬁcation
of
macroconsciousness and macrophysical properties in the elephant. Thus the
elephant’s color, for example, would be explained by two different sets of broadly
physical property instances, namely, the C instances of the micro and the
proposed C instance of the macro. It follows that the relata-speciﬁc bundle
theorist would either have to accept causal or explanatory overdetermination of
the macrophysical properties of the elephant, or else treat the C instance
grounding the elephant’s color as not even broadly physical. But this last move
leads either to a sort of interactionism, according to which the macro-grounding C
instance is not physical but grounds physically causally efﬁcacious entities, or else
to a radical macro epiphenomenalism, according to which the macro properties of
macro entities, whether physical or phenomenal, are causally inert.
To accept any of the consequences listed in premise () would be costly for
relata-speciﬁc bundle theorists. Fortunately, doing so is unnecessary since the option
to identify the C instances that ground microphysics with the C instance(s) that
ground macroconsciousness is open to the relata-speciﬁc bundle theorist, in the form
of collective bundling. After all, as premise (ii) states, the relata-speciﬁc bundle
theorist must invoke some C instance(s) to ground the co-instantiation of the physical
and phenomenal anyway. She might as well do so in a way that is both ontologically
economical
and
devoid
of
serious theoretical
costs
like
overdetermination,
interactionism, and epiphenomenalism. I thus arrive at the fourth premise:
Premise :
The best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory does not require
overdetermination, interactionism, or epiphenomenalism in order
to account for the C instances described in premise (), and thus to
account for facts about macro property instantiation.
By modus tollens on premises () and (), I arrive at (b):
(b):
According to the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, the C instances
constitutive of microphysics are also constitutive of macroconsciousness.
Argument for (c)
I assume that the relata-speciﬁc bundle theorist takes C instances to be nonconscious.
This is not required by relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, however, and some relata-
speciﬁc bundle theorists might prefer panpsychism to panprotopsychism (more on
this below). Nonetheless, the assumption seems advisable. Thus, by assumption:
.
According to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, C instances are not conscious.
I showed above in section that the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory
treats C instances as nonstructural. Thus,
.
According to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, C instances are nonstructural.

On the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, C instances are schematically
described to embody exactly the qualitative natures that a priori entail property
bundling and the associated property distributions. Thus,
.
According to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, truths about C instances a priori
entail
truths
about
the
properties
that
they
constitute,
including
macrophenomenal properties, for the relevant C instances are stipulated to
be of just the qualitative sort that necessitate the relevant property
instantiations.
Given the deﬁnition of ‘protophenomenal’, it follows from ()–() and (b) that
c:
According to the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, the C instances
that constitute microphysics and macroconsciousness are protophenomenal.
This concludes the argument for premise of the original modus ponens.
Objections and Replies
I anticipate four objections. First, relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is unremarkable since
any attempted solution to the many-over-one is explanatorily pertinent to the
distribution
of
both
physical
and
phenomenal
properties,
including
their
co-instantiation. Yet surely orthodox instantiation theories are not versions of
Russellian monism, so relata-speciﬁc bundle theory must not be either.
This objection jumps erroneously from the observation that orthodox approaches
to the many-over-one serve as ‘explanatorily pertinent’ to the conclusion that
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is unremarkable. What is special about relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory is that it bases its explanatory power explicitly on the primitive,
unique, categorical qualitative natures of all the particular and varied C instances,
and their modal connection to property instantiation. Orthodox instantiation or
compresence theories do nothing of the sort. Yet this difference is precisely what
makes relata-speciﬁc bundle theory a version of Russellian monism. If C instances
were not categorically qualitatively special and correspondingly responsible for
securing property instantiations ‘as soon as’ they exist, then they would not count
as (fully) grounding physics or consciousness, nor would they solve Bradley’s regress.
According to the second objection, relata-speciﬁc bundle theory fails to meet a
necessary condition for being a version of Russellian monism, namely, it fails to
distance itself from narrow physicalism/functionalism. Sure, relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory, like Russellian monism, provides a certain kind of sufﬁciency base for
everything, including consciousness. But it does so only by relying on the relationship
between narrow physical structure and macro consciousness. Thus any narrow
physicalist or functionalist could accept relata-speciﬁc bundle theory Russellian
monism, which shows that it is not a legitimate version of Russellian monism.
I thank an anonymous referee for this objection.

D A N I E L
G I B E R M A N
https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

This objector is confused about relata-speciﬁc bundle theory. Relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory explicitly posits sui generis spatiotemporally located property
instances that are intrinsic, qualitative, and categorical. It thus is straightforwardly
incompatible with narrow physicalism and any associated functionalisms, as
explained in the remarks following the argument for (a) above. Moreover,
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is predicated on the claim that these sui generis
property instances (the C instances) are metaphysically explanatory of all other
property instances. Consequently, relata-speciﬁc bundle theory does not lean on
the relationship between microphysics and the macro world in order to explain
consciousness
fundamentally.
What
fundamentally
explains
all
property
instantiations, on relata-speciﬁc bundle theory, are C instances. This is a far cry
from narrow physicalism.
The third objection maintains that since Chalmers states that we know nothing
about protophenomenal properties, and yet we know that C instances are
bundling instances, C is unduly different from the sort of ‘quiddities’ envisioned
by Russell or Chalmers.
This objection is mistaken. Chalmers () allows that we can describe
protophenomenal properties schematically, and that is all the relata-speciﬁc
bundle theorist does with respect to C instances. It is not as though relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory tells us anything speciﬁc about the C instances’ intrinsic natures or
how precisely they work to explain instantiation—they are not red or velvety or
bitter. We just know them schematically as special categorical properties capable
of grounding both microphysics and macroconsciousness precisely because of
their qualitative natures.
The fourth objection, like the second, says that there is an important feature of
Russellian monism that relata-speciﬁc bundle theory Russellian monism lacks,
namely, a connection to phenomenal consciousness sufﬁcient to close, or at least
lessen, the epistemic/explanatory gap between the physical and the phenomenal. It
is clear that panpsychist Russellian monism has this sort of connection, since it
attributes phenomenal consciousness to the fundamental physical entities. But the
panprotopsychist version of Russellian monism, the objection goes, is supposed to
have this sort of connection as well. For example, so-called panqualityism (Feigl
;
Coleman
),
according
to
which
fundamental
physical
entities
instantiate special experience-able properties (‘qualities’) that jointly conﬁgure to
yield macro-phenomenal experiences, is thought to help bridge the gap. The
bridge forms because, while qualities of fundamental particles are not themselves
experienced, they are of the same basic type as the experienced macro-qualities
that they ground. By contrast, the objection continues, C instances are completely
different
from
phenomenal
experiences,
leaving
the
epistemic/explanatory
gap open.
I have one direct response and two indirect responses to this fourth objection,
which jointly shed light on the dialectical importance of relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory Russellian monism.
I thank David Chalmers for this objection.
PA N P ROTO P S Y C H I S M
I N S TA N T I AT E D

https://doi.org/10.1017/apa.2021.4 Published online by Cambridge University Press

The direct response is that the objection sells relata-speciﬁc bundle theory
Russellian monism short. While it is true that C instances are not the panqualityist’s
qualities, they are objectively qualitative. Thus they (theoretically) are capable of
being perceptually experienced. It conceptually accords with relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory that we could see, hear, and touch C instances. Yet the C instances also are
highly specialized, highly varied, and presumably unlike anything we have
experienced. If we did perceptually experience the whole array of them needed to
ground, say, a particular brain state, there is no saying what that complex
experience would be like. Unlike a mere conﬁguration of standard physical
properties, it might well inform us about the associated phenomenal state in a way
that lessened the epistemic/explanatory gap. Obviously, this direct response to the
fourth objection is highly speculative—but not inappropriately so. For example, it is
no more speculative than parallel defenses of panpsychism or panqualityism. There
is at present little more than speculation supporting the suggestion that fundamental
physical entities have consciousness or panqualityist qualities, or that such qualities
would close the epistemic/explanatory gap.
The ﬁrst indirect response to the fourth objection is that there is room in tenable
conceptual space for panpsychist or panqualityist versions of relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory Russellian monism (recall that treating C instances as nonconscious was an
assumption). Granted, this would saddle relata-speciﬁc bundle theory with
commitments that its actual proponents do not endorse. But that is beside the
point. These species of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory Russellian monism have all
the relevant features of the species discussed up to this point. The difference is
simply that either phenomenality is added to instances of C (panpsychist version)
or status as ‘qualities’ of the relevant kind is added to instances of C
(panqualityist version). This response is indirect because it leaves unaddressed the
objector’s claim that C instances as they have been discussed prior to the objection
do not lessen the epistemic or explanatory gap. Still, it yields a species of
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory Russellian monism that lessens those gaps exactly as
much as do other panpsychist or panqualityist versions of Russellian monism.
Like the ﬁrst indirect response, the second makes no attempt to show that C as
previously discussed lessens the epistemic/explanatory gap. However, it does not
invoke panpsychism or panqualityism, either. It simply emphasizes that relata-
speciﬁc bundle theory Russellian monism has many important features from the
perspective of the philosophy of mind. It rules out zombies, Mary, and orthodox
physicalism without violating causal closure or denying causal efﬁcacy to the mental.
Moreover, it does all this without facing the sort of conceivability argument that
Chalmers () poses to panqualityism—the chief example of a panprotopsychist
Russellian monism that putatively lessens the epistemic/explanatory gap. For, while
Chalmers may be correct that it is conceivable to have the conﬁgured qualities
described by panqualityism and yet no phenomenality, it is inconceivable to have the
conﬁgured C instances described by relata-speciﬁc bundle theory without the
associated phenomenality. To hold otherwise is a conceptual confusion, analogous
to holding that it is conceivable to travel through spacetime from one Lewisian
world to another, or to separate an extended simple object into proper parts. If the
putative inability to lessen the epistemic/explanatory gap keeps relata-speciﬁc bundle

theory from having the status of ‘panprotopsychism’, this second indirect response
goes, then so be it. Simply drop the claim that the best version of relata-speciﬁc
bundle theory is panprotopsychist and use the neologism paninstantiationism
instead. What is important is that paninstantiationism has the above-mentioned
dialectical features of Russellian monism plus immunity to conceivability arguments.
Whatever the value of lessening the explanatory or epistemic gap may be, it is not
obviously greater than the value of immunity to conceivability arguments.
. Conclusion
One interesting upshot of the present discussion is that even those who deny that
physics involves the quiddities envisioned by Russell must face a version of
Russellian monism with the dialectical features that Chalmers highlights. For, as
emphasized in the argument for (a) above, relata-speciﬁc bundle theory entails
that quiddity distribution is required for property instantiation in general, even if
none of Russell’s suggested quiddities are needed to realize physical structure. To
see this, notice that even on the narrow conception of the physical, the
dispositional roles distinctive of mass, charge and the like are bundled in the sense
that they are instantiated together in a certain spatiotemporal conﬁguration. Yet
mass values, charge values, and spatiotemporal relational structure all could have
existed without being co-conﬁgured as they are. Thus relata-speciﬁc bundle theory
requires categorical C instances to explain narrowly construed physics itself, even
on the assumption that none of Russell’s quiddities are needed.
To see better that C instances are not just versions of Russell’s quiddities (despite
being quiddities enough for Russellian monism), notice that relata-speciﬁc bundle
theory Russellian monism, while ruling out narrow physics, allows for the
conceivability and possibility of what we might call ‘narrow-ish’ physics. That is,
relata-speciﬁc bundle theory allows for physics to be devoid of quiddities instantiated
by any material objects, spacetime points, ﬁelds, or other plausible substantial
particulars relevant to the role-playing of physical dispositional roles. Such physics is
to that extent in line with the narrow conception. However, what physics cannot
lack, according to relata-speciﬁc bundle theory (and in violation of the narrow
conception), are C instances, which primitively instantiate their own quiddities at
locations—quiddities not instantiated by material objects, points, or ﬁelds.
Attheriskofsomehyperbole,onemightsaythatacorrespondinglessonofthepresent
discussion is that the metaphysics of properties is, in a certain sense, deeper than the
mind-body problem. For the former contains a well-motivated theory that closes an
otherwise open and extensive dialectical space into which the latter regularly travels. If
the best version of relata-speciﬁc bundle theory is true, then zombies and Jackson’s
Mary are inconceivable and orthodox physicalism is false, quite independently of
whether physics includes the putative role-players of dispositional structure that
Russell, Chalmers, and other theorists have considered antecedently.
