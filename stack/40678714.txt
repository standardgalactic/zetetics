 ABSTRACT
 Recent observations of the central 10 pc of the Galaxy are reviewed. The compact nonthermal
 radio source has a diameter < 20 AU and an elongated source structure, which has been observed
 for the first time at X = 3.6 cm. It is a unique radio source in the Galaxy, but it is similar to the nuclear
 radio sources in external galaxies. Observations of the ionized gas in Sgr A West at 0'.'3 resolution
 support an infall hypothesis for its origin in the central 3 pc. Similarities of the galactic center to
 Seyfert nuclei are pointed out.
 I. Introduction
 The galactic center is heavily obscured (Av ^ 30m), so
 that it is largely inaccessible to optical observations. Con-
 sequently it has enjoyed relative anonymity among many
 astronomers as the nearest active galactic nucleus. Over
 the past few years, there has been a burst of observational
 activities across a wide spectral range directed toward the
 center of our Galaxy (cf. Brown and Liszt 1984), further
 revealing a host of interesting phenomena at various size
 scales.
 Here, I shall review the more recent observations of
 the central 10 pc of the galactic center, and point out, in
 particular, the striking similarities to a Seyfert nucleus. At
 a distance of 10 kpc, the center of our Galaxy can be
 studied at unsurpassed linear resolution (1" = 0.05 pc)
 and is an invaluable scaled-down model for understand-
 ing other active galactic nuclei.
 II. Unusual Phenomena in the Galactic Center
 Besides its proximity, the Galactic center is interesting
 because of a variety of phenomena which suggest past and
 present activities:
 (a) On the kpc scale, expanding motions in the H I and
 molecular gas may suggest past explosions of extraordi-
 nary energy (Oort 1977). More recent observations have
 identified tilts in the gas distribution relative to the galac-
 tic plane, leading to suggestions of noncircular gas mo-
 tions in dynamical response to a bar or triaxial potential in
 the nuclear bulge (e.g., Liszt and Burton 1978).
 (b) On the ~ 100-pc scale, the most striking phenom-
 ena are the radio continuum emission features. An Í1-
 shaped radio lobe extending ~ 200 pc above the galactic
 plane at the center was recently highlighted in observa-
 tions by Sofue and Handa (1984). At the positive longi-
 tude base ofthe radio loop, the radio emission in the plane

 has been resolved into ~ 35-pc long linear emission fea-
 tures (Yusef-Zadeh, Morris, and Chance 1984). The radio
 emission in these extended features has a flat spectrum,
 but is highly polarized in some places (Tsuboi et al. 1985).
 These features are undoubtedly associated with the struc-
 ture of magnetic fields, but their formation mechanisms
 are not completely understood (Sofue 1985).
 (c) On the ~ 10-pc scale, Sagittarii A, the radio source
 at the galactic center, can be divided into Sgr A East, a
 10-pc oval-shaped nonthermal radio source - presumably
 a supernova remnant, and Sgr A West, a 3-pc size "spiral-
 like" thermal radio source, due to ionized gas (Ekers et al.
 1983). The ionized gas has large radial velocities (|V| ^
 300 km s"1) within the central 10" (e.g., Lacy et al. 1980).
 Orbiting about Sgr A West is a distribution of warm,
 high-density neutral gas and dust (Becklin et al. 1982;
 Genzel et al. 1984).
 (d) In the midst of Sgr A West lies the compact nonther-
 mal radio source, Sgr A* (Lo et al. 1985), which is nearly
 coincident with a 2 |xm source, "1RS 16 Center," that may
 be responsible for the ~ 107 Lo of bolometric luminosity
 from the central 10 pc and the ionization of Sgr A West
 (Henry et al. 1984). A source of H and He line emission
 with very large velocity width (AV ~ 1500 km s"1) has
 been located within the central ~ 5" including 1RS 16
 (Hall et al 1982; Geballe et al. 1984). By rather indirect
 inference, a compact source of positrons is also associated
 with the central 0.2 pc (e.g., Ramaty and Lingenfelter
 1983).
 III. The Compact Nonthermal Radio Source
 The existence of a compact nonthermal radio source at
 the galactic center was first suggested by Lynden-Bell
 and Rees (1971) as the possible signature of a black hole.
 Such a source was detected unambiguously first by Balick
 and Brown (1974). Radio continuum observations of Sgr
 A* have been previously reviewed by Lo (1982, 1984).
 The latest VLBI observations set an upper limit of < 20

 AU to the source size and for the first time revealed an
 elongated structure at 3.6 cm, with the position angle of
 the major axis nearly parallel to the rotation axis of the
 galaxy (Lo et al. 1985a). The observed parameters of Sgr
 A* are summarized in Table I.
 The properties of Sgr A* are similar to those of compact
 radio sources in galactic nuclei and quasars, but the lumi-
 nosity is much lower. The extremely small size indicates
 that the scale of the underlying energy source must ap-
 proach stellar dimensions. Models invoking stellar ob-
 jects are inconsistent with the observations (cf. Lo et al.
 1981). Sgr A* is a unique radio source in the Galaxy.
 However, it resembles closely a weaker version of the
 nuclear radio source in external galaxies, such as M 81
 and M 104. Such extragalactic nuclear sources have too
 large a radio luminosity to be easily explained by a stellar
 source.
 Rees (1982) suggested that Sgr A* could be due to
 low-level accretion onto an ~ 106 93ÎO black hole. While
 Sgr A* has a dimension consistent with such a black hole
 (~ 103 times the Schwarzschild radius), it has a radio
 luminosity of only ~ 10 Lo. Such a modest amount of
 power can in principle be available from a stellar source.
 Thus, even though no known stellar radio source has been
 observed with the properties of Sgr A*, a stellar energy
 source cannot yet be ruled out. To constrain further the
 nature of the energy source of Sgr A*, it is important to
 measure its mass, in addition to obtaining a proper bright-
 ness distribution map.
 The ideal method of mass determination is to observe
 the distribution of the stellar velocity dispersion around
 the radio source. This has to be done at near-infrared
 wavelength because of the large obscuration toward the
 center. For the same reason, identification of the central
 star cluster is not straightforward. 1RS 16 Center, a 2 jxm

 source with 0'.'5 of Sgr A* and at the peak of the 2 |xm
 distribution (Becklin et al. 1978), may be the central
 luminous source (Henry et al. 1984), but its nature is
 unknown and signature of the stellar component has not
 been detected.
 An indirect probe of the mass of Sgr A* is via its proper
 motion. If the radio source is massive, no motion is ex-
 pected, whereas a stellar-mass object would have high
 space motion and measurable proper motion (100 km s"1
 = 2 milli-arc sec yr"1). Thus, any measurable proper
 motion would rule out a massive black-hole model of Sgr
 A*. First results of this difficult but feasible measurement
 are consistent with the secular parallax expected for an
 object at rest at the Galactic center (Backer and Sramek
 1982).
 Ionized and neutral gas has strong emission lines in the
 millimeter through infrared wavelength range, observa-
 tions of which have revealed large radial motions of the
 ionized gas within the central 10" as well as the motion of
 the neutral gas within the central 2' (e.g. , Crawford et al.
 1985, and references therein). Interpreting the gas mo-
 tions only in terms of circular motion under gravity and
 citing evidence for Keplerian dependence of rotational
 velocities of the neutral gas, Crawford et al. (1985) in-
 ferred the presence of a large point mass at the center.
 The principal disadvantage of this approach, however, is
 that nongravitational effects on gas motion can be signifi-
 cant. In fact, noncircular motion is clearly present on
 various size scales.
 IV. Sgr A West-Ionized Gas in the Central 3 PC
 The "spiral-like" distribution of the ionized gas in the
 central 3 pc is hinted at in the observations of Brown,
 Johnston, and Lo (1981), but first identified clearly by
 Ekers et al. (1983), who listed four possible explana-
 tions - rotation, ejection (see also Brown 1982), infall, and
 spiral density wave.
 Lo and Claussen (1983) obtained 1" X = 6 cm VLA map
 of Sgr A West (Fig. 1), that provides a clearer picture of
 the spatial distribution and kinematics of the ionized gas.
 Instead of the S -shaped structure apparent in the lower
 resolution maps of Sgr A West, the Irresolution map
 indicates that the south arm continues northward, past
 the west arm, and joins physically the tip of the north arm
 (Fig. 2(a); Lo and Claussen 1983). For the three arms
 converging near Sgr A*, a reinterpretation of the velocity
 field provided by the 12.8 (xm [Ne II] observations of Lacy
 et al. (1980) permits an identification of at least three
 streams of ionized gas passing by the compact radio
 source.
 To explain the morphology, the velocity
 origin of the ionized gas, Lo and Claussen (1

 stretched, molecular gas which is ionized

 tatively by Quinn and Sussman (1985) who numerically
 simulated the motion of an ensemble of test particles in a
 central force field. By invoking ram pressure from a hot
 medium as drag on the test particles, they could repro-
 duce the morphology and velocities of the south and north
 arms as a single tidally distorted entity (Fig. 2(b)). How-
 ever, within the same framework, the large negative and
 positive velocities near the center cannot be explained.
 A new 073 X 076 X = 6 cm radio picture (Lo, Claussen,
 and Herant 1985) of the central 40" of Sgr A West is shown
 in Figure 3. It reveals filamentary structures of very high
 density (~ 105 cm"3) ionized gas within the "arms." The
 filamentary structures and the absence of many unre-
 solved discrete sources in the ionized gas tend to rule out
 embedded young stars as the primary ionizing sources. A
 central ionization source, which could be a single object
 or a very compact cluster of OB stars, is indicated.
 The separation of Sgr A* from the ionized gas is very
 clear and there is no obvious point of divergence near the
 center, making it difficult to invoke ejection from a com-
 mon point. Furthermore, there is ~ 104 WQ of neutral gas
 (see below) physically associated with the ionized gas. It is
 difficult to think of an ejection mechanism that would
 account for the origin of both the ionized and neutral gas.
 V. Neutral Gas Within the Central 10 PC
 From the color temperature and dust opacity derived
 from multi-wavelength far-infrared observations, Becklin
 et al (1982) inferred that although Sgr A West is sur-
 rounded by a "ring" of material, there is a deficiency of
 dust, and presumably neutral gas, within it. Liszt et al.
 (1983) first demonstrated that neutral atomic and molecu-
 lar gas exists just to the north and south of Sgr A West and
 has the same velocity as the adjacent ionized gas.
 The neutral gas surrounding Sgr A West is further
 studied by far-IR spectroscopic observations (Genzel et
 al. 1984) and millimeter-wave observations (Liszt et al.
 1983; Lo et al. 1985&). Figure 4(a) shows a 30"-resolution
 integrated intensity map of the CO(2-1) emission from
 the central ~4' (Lo et al. 1985&) and Figure 4(b) shows
 the outline of the 63 |xm continuum dust emission (from
 Crawford et al. 1985), with Sgr A West superposed on
 both figures.
 The CO intensity map includes only velocities at which
 the emission is localized to the central 4' (i.e. , |V| ^ 75 km
 s"1). It shows that the molecular gas is distributed in
 concentrations extended over ~ 12 pc parallel to the
 plane. There is more gas to the southwest of Sgr A West
 than the northeast. The far-infrared continuum and the

 far-infrared fine structure lines of [O i] and [C n], extend-
 ing only ~ 6 pc symmetrically about Sgr A West, appear
 to delineate the "photodissociation" region interfacing the
 ionized gas in Sgr A West and the cooler molecular gas.
 The relatively extensive CO(2-1) observations also
 show that while the bulk of the molecular gas moves in the
 same sense of galactic rotation, a substantial portion of the
 CO gas has noncircular motion. In particular, the Kep-
 lerian motion observed in the CO(7-6) emission (Harris et
 al. 1985) is not confirmed in the more extensive CO(2-1)
 emission which remains at high velocity (VLSR ^ - 100 km
 s"1) out to 6 pc from the center (A 1 = 2'). Higher spatial
 resolution (< 10") is needed to clarify the kinematics of
 the neutral gas, as well as its relationship to the ionized
 gas.
 VI. Summary and Discussion
 At the center of the Galaxy is a compact ~ 107 Lo source
 of luminosity and ionization that is nearly coincident with
 a compact nonthermal radio source. Surrounding it is a
 largely evacuated cavity containing a distribution of high
 density (~ 103 to 105 cm"3) filaments of ionized gas moving
 at radial velocities up to ± 300 km s"1. The volume filling
 factor of the ionized gas is only a few percent. The ionized
 gas region is bordered by ~ 104 SJÎO of neutral matter.
 Because of the large extinction to the galactic center,
 one cannot compare its optical emission-line spectra to
 those of active galactic nuclei. However, the central few
 pc of the galactic center has a structure very similar to that
 of a Seyfert nucleus. 1RS 16 Center and Sgr A* may be
 identified as the central continuum source (Weedman
 1977) with a weak radio continuum. The properties of the
 ionized gas in Sgr A West are similar to those derived for
 the narrow-line emission regions (e.g. , Osterbrock 1977).
 The central ~ 4" region of H and He line emission with
 velocity width ~ 1500 km s1 may be identified as a
 broad-line region (BLR). If observed from M 31, the
 galactic center would probably be identified as a type 2
 Seyfert nucleus (the BLR will be too weak to detect).
 Is the central continuum source a black hole? Sgr A*
 has an extremely small size and is unique in the Galaxy. It
 may be the best signature of a black hole, but the luminos-
 ity is small and the mass is unknown. Dynamical probing
 of a point mass via measurements of ionized and neutral
 gas is compelling but inconclusive. In particular, it is
 important to distinguish between outflow or gravitation-
 ally bound motions as the origin of the large linewidths of
 the H and He emission lines within the central ~ 4".
 Other measurements crucial to verifying the presence of a
 massive black hole include the central stellar velocity

 The proximity of the galactic center has allowed us to
 resolve spatially the structure of the photoionized gas in
 the central 3 pc which traces perhaps the path of accretion
 from surrounding neutral gas into the central source. The
 morphology of Sgr A West illustrates a very complicated
 structure that ionized gas could have in the narrow-line
 regions in galactic nuclei. Such a morphology would be
 difficult to deduce given only the emission-line profiles.
 With the rapid development of new astronomical tech-
 niques and facilities, the next few years will be exciting
 times for deciphering the intriguing center of our Galaxy.
