 Acknowledgments  
 Each time I get a book published, I re - learn a lesson that transforming an idea 
into a ﬁ nished book is a project and it takes a project team. As they say — well, 
if they don ’ t say it anymore, they should — ﬁ rst things ﬁ rst . Let me begin by 
thanking Paul Petralia, Senior Editor at Wiley, for initiating this project, and 
Simone Taylor to see it through to completion. With two thumbs up, I thank 
Michael Christian and Ms. Anastasia Wasko for their excellent coordination 
of the pre - production stage of this project. 
 Before a book can be put into your hands, the production team plays the 
crucial role of converting the text manuscript and illustrations into printer -
 ready pages. It is my pleasure to thank Kristen Parrish, Senior Production 
Editor at Wiley, for an excellent job in leading the production team, and 
Jeannette Stiefel for a diligent job in copy editing. Thanks are also due to other 
members of the production team, including Stephanie Sakson, of Best - set 
Premedia, and Dean Gonzalez, the illustrations manager at Wiley. 
 My special thanks go to Dr. John Serri, the technical editor of this book, 
for carefully reviewing all the chapters and taking the book to the next level 
through his valuable feedback. This acknowledgment would be incomplete 
without extending my gratitude to some great minds in science, including Niels 
Bohr, Erwin Schr ö dinger, Richard Feynman, Max Delbr ü ck, Francis Crick, 
James Watson, Richard Smalley, and Johnjoe McFadden, without whose off -
 the - track contributions to science, I and many others would not be able to 
clearly see the quantum thread running through all sciences. I also thank in 
advance all the readers who will be able to recognize or appreciate this thread 
a little better after reading this book. 
 Last but not least, my appreciation (along with my heart) goes to my wife, 
Renee, and my son, Adam, for their continual support through this and other 
projects.

 About the Tech Editor 
 Dr. John Serri has held a variety of positions from basic physics research to 
application software development. His broad industrial and academic experi-
ence enabled him to develop a rigorous yet practical perspective to physics. 
Serri received his BS degree in Math and Physics from the State University 
of New York (SUNY) at Albany and earned a Ph.D. in Physics from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he developed novel techniques 
for using lasers to probe the dynamics of intermolecular collisions. The tech-
niques he developed have led to numerous applications in basic physics includ-
ing laser cooling, which led one of his mentors, Dr. William Phillips, to the 
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997. After leaving MIT, Dr. Serri joined the staff at 
Bell Laboratories, where he conducted basic research in surface physics and 
applied research related to the effects of nuclear weapons on telecommunica-
tion systems. Later he joined the staff of Loral Aerospace and was one of the 
designers of the Globalstar System. At Globalstar, he led the development of 
the systems to control and manage the Globalstar network. Serri currently 
serves on the adjunct faculty of the Mathematics and Computer Science 
Department at California State University East Bay and is Vice President of 
Strategic Inititives at Manhattan Software Inc., a major provider of Advanced 
Integrated enterprise software.

PREFACE
 To an artist, in Shakespeare ’ s words, All the world ’ s a stage. Taking this meta-
phor to another level, to a scientist, the whole universe is a colossal party with 
a cosmic dance on dance ﬂ oors at all levels, ranging from an expanding uni-
verse with swirling galaxies, to planets revolving around their suns, to organ-
isms of all shapes and sizes dancing through their life cycles, to molecules in 
action inside living and nonliving systems, to atoms making and breaking 
bonds to make molecules and crystals, to electrons dancing around the nucleus 
of atoms, and so on. The universe and everything in it, living and nonliving, 
originally started (and still starts) at the microscopic level, a level too small 
for human senses to resolve. In this book, we focus on the concept of micro 
in contrast to that of macro; micro means anything small enough not to be 
seen by the naked eye, including the size scales of micrometers, nanometers, 
and smaller items. Because the universe and everything in it is comprised of 
microentities, to fully understand the macro we need to understand the micro. 
 Humans, the macrobeings, have evolved to a relatively advanced level. For 
better or for worse we are late comers to this party of life on Earth. On the 
scale of a 12 - h clock, if the party started at the hour zero (i.e., midnight) with 
the solidiﬁ cation of the earth ’ s crust, and if it is noon now, we have just arrived 
at 11:59:59. However, now that we have arrived, we are the most curious and 
ambitious creatures at the party. We want to know everything about everyone 
and everything in the party: Who (or what) are you? What are you made of? 
How did you get here? Where are you from, no I mean where are you origi-
nally from? Where are you headed, that is, what is your future? 
 All the answers accumulated from our age old queries have uncovered the 
three most important higher - level secrets of nature, important and general 
enough that they should become part of the thinking of scientists and students 
of all sciences. 
 P.1  THREE SECRETS OF NATURE 
 At ﬁ rst glance, the diversity around us is obvious and ubiquitous. However, 
during the entire history of the development of science, the history of discover-
ies and inventions, nature has taught us a very powerful lesson over and over 
again: Look for the underlying unity behind apparent diversity of things and 
phenomena, and therefore behind the laws governing those things and phe-
nomena. In my opinion, the three most salient of all the secrets of nature that 
science has discovered so far are the following: 
 There Is an Underlying Unity Behind Apparent Diversity .  This concept is a 
key point to understanding not only the things and phenomena around 
us, but also their diversity. For example, all life is made up of the same 
basic building block of life: the cell. Most great discoveries and break-
throughs in the history of science have revealed this secret over and over 
again: unity behind diversity. 

PREFACE  xxix
 All Macroscopic Things Are Composed of Smaller Building Blocks .  This 
truth exists at various levels. For example, all materials around us are 
made up of molecules or crystals, all molecules and crystals are made of 
atoms, which in turn are made of subatomic particles (proton, neutron, 
and electron), protons and neutrons are made of quarks, and so on. This 
is also true about living organisms. For example, we are made of organs, 
organs are made of tissues, tissues are made of cells, cells are made of 
and run by the molecules of life and atoms or ions, and the molecules of 
life are made of atoms, and so on. This structural hierarchy is also appar-
ent in our own inventions, for example, there are rooms contained in 
buildings, the buildings are contained in neighborhoods, and the neigh-
borhoods make up a City, and so on. 
 Nature Does Its Most Important and Fundamental Work on a Smaller 
Scale .   This statement means that if you really want to understand a 
macroscopic structure, you will need to understand its smaller building 
blocks. The bottom line is we cannot have the macroworld without the 
existence of a microworld 
 The underlying unity behind diversity has been the key to major break-
throughs in the sciences. The history of physics can be told in terms of discov-
ering the uniﬁ cation of multiple forces. For example, the terrestrial force that 
keeps us bound to the Earth and the celestial force that keeps the planets 
bound to the Sun are the same force: gravity. This realization helped Newton 
formulate the law of universal gravitation that applies to earth - bound prob-
lems, as well as explains the empirical laws of planetary motion discovered by 
Kepler. Unifying theories of electric and magnetic forces into a single theory 
of a force, called the electromagnetic (EM) force, was another great feat in 
physics, and the classical theory of EM is based on this uniﬁ cation. We now 
know from physics that our universe is shaped and governed by four funda-
mental forces: gravitational, EM, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear forces. 
For many, this may be unity enough, but the attempts to discover further 
uniﬁ cation continued, and there is great scientiﬁ c evidence that even these 
four forces are different low - energy manifestations of a single force that was 
in action at the very beginning of the creation of the universe. 
 This history of uniﬁ cation of forces is intertwined with the history of dis-
covering and understanding the smaller and smaller building blocks of matter. 
For example, physicists (and chemists) discovered that all materials around us 
are made of smaller components called molecules; the molecules are made of 
even smaller components called atoms; and atoms in turn are made of yet 
smaller constituents called neutrons, protons, and electrons. Physicists have 
probed neutrons and protons, and have discovered that they are made of even 
smaller and more fundamental particles called quarks. Therefore, the path of 
development that physics, and as a result other disciplines of science, have 
taken is the path from the macro (large) to the micro (small). As mentioned 
earlier, the reason for this is that we, the humans, are macrobeings and we 

xxx  
PREFACE
started observing things with the most primitive tools, our ﬁ ve senses (e.g., our 
eyes), which were the only tools easily available to us. These tools are limited 
to the macroworld. However, to our advantage, we humans had a capability 
that other organisms did not have, and that is, to develop tools and techniques: 
say technology. The gradual development of technology, and hence better tools 
(e.g., microscopes), enabled us to continue our journey of understanding and 
exploration from the macroworld of planets and visible objects around us to 
the microworld of molecules, atoms, and subatomic particles. In fact, by extend-
ing this idea we ﬁ nd there is a feedback loop between technology and basic 
fundamental science. As science evolves, new technologies emerge and in turn 
these new technologies allow for the creation of better and more powerful 
scientiﬁ c tools. These tools in turn allow for new observations that lead to an 
even better understanding of the microscopic world, and so the cycle goes. For 
example, the colossal colliders at the particle physics lab at CERN (near 
Geneva, Switzerland) would not be possible without the capability of tracking 
particles to the precision of micrometers and microseconds provided by this 
technology, which itself is based on physics. 
 Combining the three secrets of nature, the truths of uniﬁ cation and the unity 
behind diversity are essential to our journey from the macro to the micro. This 
relationship among these three secrets of nature is the reason it has taken us 
this long to ﬁ nd them: the whole history of the development of science on this 
planet. 
 Rather ironically, when we had less information and knowledge than we 
have today, it appeared as if one person could know everything, and there was 
only one discipline called  natural philosophy , the study of nature and the 
physical universe. Today ’ s physics is actually the modern version of  natural 
philosophy . 
 P.2  FROM NATURAL PHILOSOPHY TO PHYSICS 
 In olden times, natural philosophy referred to the study of nature and the 
physical universe. It served as a precursor to developing ﬁ elds of natural sci-
ences led by physics. Rest aside physics, modern notions of  science and  scien-
tists date only to the nineteenth century. Before then, the word  “ science ” 
simply meant knowledge and the title  scientist did not exist. For centuries, 
scientists were called natural philosophers, and these practitioners often 
pursued a wide variety of interests. A remnant of that heritage is a doctorate 
in physics, or other sciences, which is still called a Ph.D., and is an abbreviation 
for doctor of philosophy. The title of Isaac Newton ’ s scientiﬁ c treatise pub-
lished in 1687, commonly known as the Principia, is called  The Mathematical 
Principles of Natural Philosophy . So, it is not a coincidence that long - established 
Chairs of Natural Philosophy at older universities are currently occupied 
largely by physics professors. The connection between physics and other dis-
ciplines of science can also be understood from the fact that all other ﬁ elds of 

PREFACE  xxxi
science are historically developed from natural philosophy or its descendants. 
During the fourteenth and ﬁ fteenth centuries, the term  natural philosophy was 
referred to what is now called physical science. By the mid - nineteenth century, 
with the increase of information and knowledge, it became increasingly clear 
that it was not generally practical for scientists to contribute to numerous 
areas. Thus specialization occurred and now there were physicists, chemists, 
biologists, geologists, and so on. 
 P.3  PHYSICS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE 
 Being the most fundamental of all the sciences, physics has profoundly affected 
all science ﬁ elds. Given its fundamental nature, students in many ﬁ elds are 
required to take some physics courses in order to understand the fundamental 
principles underlying many phenomena across many science disciplines. In this 
sense, physics is intimately related to other sciences, and also to applied ﬁ elds, 
such as engineering, medicine, and now nanotechnology. This is because prin-
ciples discovered in physics apply to all natural sciences. For example, the 
principle of conservation of energy is common to all physical and chemical 
systems. 
 Chemistry is the scientiﬁ c study of matter and materials and the changes 
that they undergo; matter is anything that exists, has mass, and occupies space; 
whereas a material is any kind of matter that can be used for something, such 
as glass. Starting with the macroworld as physics did, early chemistry largely 
dealt with substances, such as extracting metals from their ores, making pig-
ments for cosmetics and painting, and fermenting beer and wine. Chemistry is 
the science that not only is most affected by physics, but also overlaps or col-
laborates with physics in many areas of study, such as atoms, molecules, and 
collections of atoms and molecules. A great example of the interaction between 
physics and chemistry is the quantum mechanical explanation of the relation-
ships among chemical elements and the rules of their interaction (reactions) 
with one another captured in the periodic table. 
 Biology is the scientiﬁ c study of life; that is, the study of living things and 
the phenomena related to them. Like physics and chemistry, biology also 
began its journey in the macroworld: ﬁ nding and studying things that you can 
see with your naked eye, doing the counting, classifying them, and so on. By 
now, however, biology has progressed into the microworld in different disci-
plines, such as microbiology, biochemistry, and molecular biology. There are 
an enormous number of physical phenomena involved in developing a single 
cell into an organism and then maintaining the organism. In order to fully 
understand life, all these phenomena will be understood in terms of the prin-
ciples of physics. Many key advances in the biological sciences already have 
been made possible by physics - based techniques. Some examples being used 
to study the molecules of life are the optical microscope to study cells, X - ray 
diffraction used to discover the structure of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)

PREFACE
molecule, and the electron microscope. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 
a quantum mechanical phenomenon, is revolutionizing the ﬁ eld of medicine 
in the form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With developments in 
genetics and molecular biology, an overwhelming amount of data is being 
generated in biology. The only way biologists will be able to fully make sense 
of these data is by developing a theoretical framework based on physics prin-
ciples. Quite possibly in this process, we will discover new physics laws, partly 
because biological systems are generally different in some important ways 
from the physical systems that led to the current physics laws. After all, during 
its early days, biology helped physics in the discovery of the principle of con-
servation of energy. This principle was ﬁ rst realized and proposed by Dr. Julius 
Robert Mayer, a practicing physician, in terms of the amount of heat taken in 
and given out by a living body. 
 Needless to say, physics is also at the foundation of engineering and technol-
ogy. Understanding the application of physics laws is necessary from designing 
a bike to an interplanetary spacecraft, from typewriters to computers, from a 
horse and wagon to a sports car, and from a radio to a ﬂ at screen TV. It is the 
understanding of matter at the atomic level, developed by discovering physics 
laws, that led to the semiconductor and microchip industry, and subsequently 
to computing, which led to the Internet revolution and the information age. 
Information technology has already become the ﬁ ber of all aspects of life in 
the modern world. 
 Although understanding the microworld at the atomic level, which was 
developed by physics, has been used in many ﬁ elds, such as engineering and 
technology, we could not directly control microobjects, such as molecules and 
atoms. A big part of the reason is although physics studies in the twentieth 
century reached the levels of subatomic particles, such as quarks, other ﬁ elds 
have been taking their time to catch up with molecules and atoms. Toward the 
end of the twentieth century, however, studies in most science ﬁ elds had 
reached the level of molecules and gave rise to nanoscience and nanotechnol-
ogy. This was ﬁ rst envisioned by a great physicist Richard Feynman, and 
expressed on December 29, 1959 during his talk at the meeting of the American 
Physical Society at California Institute of Technology titled:  There Is Plenty of 
Room at the Bottom. This event is now considered to be the beginning of 
nanotechnology. Using nanotechnology, which is the application of nanosci-
ence, enables us to control matter at the level of molecules and atoms: Mind 
the difference between understanding and controlling. 
 So, welcome to the twenty - ﬁ rst century, the age of molecules. 
 P.4  QUANTUM PHYSICS: THE SCIENCE OF THE 
MOLECULAR AGE 
 As mentioned earlier, all things macro are composed of things micro. It is the 
same truth that is being told through different stories in different disciplines. 

PREFACE  xxxiii
A chemist will tell us that everything is made of atoms. A physicist will even 
go farther and tell us that the universe started off from a few fundamental 
particles, such as quarks and electrons: Quarks combined to make neutrons 
and protons, which combine to make nuclei. A nucleus combined with elec-
trons to make atoms, which in turn bonded together to make molecules, and 
so on. A biologist will tell us that life evolved from certain molecules, which 
combined into the basic unit of life called a cell. Cells evolved into a whole 
variety of unicellular and multicellular organisms due to mutations in the 
genes, the source of evolution. These stories are telling us that nature has 
designed everything in the universe, living and nonliving, at a microscopic level 
from the bottom up. 
 Being human, our greatest blessing and our greatest curse has been that we 
are macrobeings, whereas the universe was built from the bottom up, we 
started investigating it from the top down. Obviously, the ﬁ rst things we saw 
and tried to understand around us were the macro items: our eyes laid upon 
stars, not atoms. This is why the history of physics started from planets, or other 
celestial and terrestrial bodies, and eventually made its way to atoms and 
subatomic particles. Similarly, the discipline of biology started from the study 
of living organisms, such as plants and animals, and made its way up to cells 
and the molecules in the cell. So, we had it backwards, and in this sense we 
have been very good reverse engineers. 
 We can boast as much as we like about our superiority to other organisms, 
but the fact remains that we as humans have our own limitations in under-
standing this universe. First, we can only investigate and understand so many 
things in our life time. Second, we can only investigate, gather information, 
obtain knowledge, and develop our understanding piecemeal. Some pieces 
may look different from each other at the surface. However, they may just be 
different facets of the same thing at some other level. Having only a partial 
knowledge, which are in different pieces, helps to obscure the big picture. 
Nature works the way it does without caring about our limitations. For example, 
nature did not create and does not need the borders and interfaces between 
different disciplines of science such as physics, chemistry, biology, and so on. 
These borders are the creations of our own limitations. 
 Here is another problem. Our common sense is built upon our experience 
with the macroscopic world. Therefore, the physics built from interacting with 
the macroscopic world, called Newtonian or classical physics (also called 
Newtonian and classical mechanics) makes sense to us. However, when our 
scientiﬁ c studies entered the microscopic world, the laws of classical physics 
collapsed right before our eyes. Quantum physics came to our rescue and to 
this date has successfully explained microscopic structures and phenomena. 
Due to our macroscopic common sense and intuition, even the pioneers of 
quantum physics had, and we continue to have, trouble with digesting quantum 
physics. Common sense tells us, it only makes sense that it does not make sense 
to our common sense, because common sense is built from our experience 
with the macroscopic world. As you will see in this book, quantum phenomena 

xxxiv  
PREFACE
brutally violate our common sense. You will also see that classical physics 
actually is a special case, an approximation, of quantum physics. This means 
quantum physics is more fundamental, which is consistent with the fact that 
the universe is designed at the microscopic level, and is built from the bottom 
up. Therefore the reality of the macroworld that we experience on a daily basis 
has its roots in the microworld of atoms and molecules. This is also reﬂ ected 
by how a human is developed even today: Two half - cells (sperm and egg) join 
to make a zygote, which divides and develops into an embryo. Embryonic cells 
differentiate to make different parts of the body, and subsequently we have a 
full human being within months. 
 Even though quantum physics is more fundamental and general and 
classical physics is only an approximation of quantum physics, classical 
physics, which is an approximate science, works well in the macroworld. 
The reason is because those approximations are at the microscale; that is, they 
are so small they easily go unnoticed. So, while dealing with the macroworld, 
we can study and use classical physics and leave quantum physics for the 
microworld. 
 However, there is a problem with this approach, and hence an opportunity 
to be captured. As already mentioned, physics and its direct applications, as 
well as biology, chemistry, materials science, and other ﬁ elds, have already 
entered the microworld. This situation has two aspects: individual and collec-
tive. Individual ﬁ elds are developing their own subﬁ elds corresponding to the 
microscale, such as microbiology and molecular biology. All these ﬁ elds are 
collectively organizing their efforts into what is termed as nanoscience and 
nanotechnology. For example, the entire ﬁ eld of molecular biology is biology 
at the microscale, or nanoscale level to be precise: The diameter of a DNA 
molecule is  ∼ 2  nm, for example. 
 As nanoscience and, consequently, nanotechnology are progressing, we are 
learning how to handle and control molecules and atoms at individual levels. 
This opens the door to an endless array of opportunities, so much so that many 
of us are already calling the twenty - ﬁ rst century the nanoage or the molecular 
age. Quantum physics is the law of the land in the molecular age of the twenty -
 ﬁ rst century. 
 P.5  WHY THIS BOOK 
 Because everything is made of atoms, the macroscopic reality of our everyday 
experience in the macroworld has its roots in the microscopic world. So, here 
is the key to generating new ideas in making progress in all sciences in modern 
times: There are many things that atoms and molecules do, which cannot be 
understood in terms of what objects in the macroworld can do; whereas there 
is nothing that macroobjects do that cannot be understood in terms of what 
atoms and molecules can do. Quantum physics is the science that helps us to 
understand what atoms and molecules can do. 

PREFACE  xxxv
 With this realization and with the fact that much of modern science, engi-
neering, and technology are already dealing with molecules and atoms, comes 
the increased need to learn quantum mechanics even for nonphysics majors, 
such as chemistry, biology, engineering, materials science, computer science, 
nanotechnology, and related ﬁ elds. This book, designed as a complete course 
in quantum mechanics for these nonphysics majors, can be used as a textbook 
for a stand - alone course in quantum mechanics. It can be part of another 
course or a series of courses, such as modern physics and physical chemistry, 
or as a part of a short program, such as nanotechnology. This book presents a 
rich, self - contained, cohesive, concise, yet comprehensive picture of quantum 
mechanics for senior undergraduate and ﬁ rst - year graduate student, nonphys-
ics majors, and for those professionals at the forefront of biology, chemistry, 
engineering, computer science, materials science, nanotechnology, and related 
ﬁ elds. 
 Most, if not all, books on quantum physics written for science students 
use abstract mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and leave its 
implications and connections to the real world often nonintuitive. This kind of 
framework may be necessary for physics students, but often is a learning 
hurdle for nonphysics majors. However, the centerpiece of this mathematical 
system and of quantum mechanics is the wave function. This book begins with 
the wave function, which the students have already learned about during their 
introductory course in classical (Newtonian) physics while learning about 
waves, and uses simple calculus, which most science major students learn in 
their junior undergraduate years, to develop and explain the concepts and 
principles of quantum mechanics. Comprehensive coverage of quantum theory, 
supported by experimental results and explained through applications and 
examples, is presented without the use of abstract and complex mathematical 
tools and formalisms, such as bra – ket vectors, Hilbert space, matrix algebra, 
or group theory. Other features of this book that help take the mystery out 
and bring quantum mechanics home for nonphysics students, researchers, 
scientists, and technologists include the following: 
 1.  It is shown throughout the book how quantum principles generate the 
same results as classical physics when we move from the micro -  to the 
macroworld. Due to its universal importance across different ﬁ elds, 
another principle emphasized throughout the book is the natural ten-
dency of systems to be in a state of equilibrium, that is, in a state of 
minimum energy. 
 2.  Throughout the book, concepts and principles of quantum physics are 
explained in the language of nonphysics majors by presenting examples 
and applications from nonphysics ﬁ elds including chemistry, biology, 
nanotechnology, and related ﬁ elds. 
 3.  Living in the Quantum World, a section at the end of each chapter, 
features real - world applications of one or more quantum mechanics 
principles discussed in the chapter.

PREFACE
 4.  Enough study checkpoints and problems with solutions are presented 
throughout the book to make difﬁ cult concepts easy to understand. 
 5.  The interfaces and connections between quantum physics and nonphys-
ics ﬁ elds, such as biology, chemistry, computing, and nanotechnology, are 
identiﬁ ed or introduced in an easy to understand fashion. 
 6.  All concepts and principles of quantum physics are explained from 
scratch the ﬁ rst time they appear and no prior knowledge of quantum 
physics is assumed. 
 7.  The material is presented in a logical learning sequence: a section builds 
upon previous sections and a chapter builds upon previous chapters. 
There is no hopping from topic to topic and no jargon without 
explanation. 
 8.  Pictures, illustrations, tables, notes, and cautions are used to help us to 
understand the difﬁ cult and tricky concepts. 
 9.  To ease the reader smoothly into the chapter, each chapter begins with 
an interesting picture with a light amusing note that is in a direct or 
subtle way related to the main issue in the chapter. 
 10.   To inspire the students, the quantum mechanics related individual 
achievements within the communal environment are emphasized by 
presenting brief biographies throughout the book. It also contributes to 
keeping the presentation interesting. 
 Furthermore, this book takes advantage of the amazing story of how quantum 
mechanics was developed. The concepts and principles that make the founda-
tion of quantum theory are developed in the context of the history of the 
gradual development of quantum mechanics, which some of us ﬁ nd as amazing 
as quantum mechanics itself. This facilitates the introduction of the key con-
cepts and principles of quantum physics as explanations for the results of those 
historic experiments that could not be explained with classical physics. In 
doing so, the book illustrates in an interesting way the process of scientiﬁ c 
discoveries and advances. 
 After introducing the foundational concepts and principles of quantum 
mechanics, such as quantization, the uncertainty principle, quantum mechani-
cal tunneling, and wave – particle duality in the context of explaining the results 
of historical experiments in the ﬁ rst few chapters, they are woven together in 
the formalism of quantum mechanics. Subsequently, quantum theory is pre-
sented in a single wave equation called the Schr ö dinger wave equation. The 
forthcoming chapters demonstrate how the principles of quantum mechanics 
naturally arise when we apply this wave equation to solve physical problems. 
The relevance of these types of problems to nonphysics ﬁ elds is demonstrated 
throughout the book. 
 The application of quantum physics to simple systems, such as the hydrogen 
atom and the periodic table of the elements, is extended in a logical way to 
complex systems, such as molecules and the assemblies of molecules. This 

PREFACE  xxxvii
covers the topics of molecular vibrations, molecular rotations, and quantum 
statistics of assemblies of molecules. Also covered are the quantum mechanical 
foundations of modern techniques used across several ﬁ elds, such as atomic 
and molecular spectroscopy, lasers, NMR imaging, and electron microscopy. 
 P.6  IN THIS BOOK 
 The laws of classical mechanics, or classical physics, were developed over the 
centuries by many scientists. Astronomers made contributions due to their 
interest in the heavenly (extraterrestrial or celestial) bodies. For example, the 
experiments, observations, and their explanation by Galileo Galilei (1564 –
 1642) laid the foundations for the important discoveries that were made in the 
following two centuries. Issac Newton (1642 – 1727), another giant ﬁ gure of 
those times, clearly understood the relationship among different variables 
involved in the motion of objects and put the work of centuries into three 
elegantly simple laws known as Newton ’ s laws of motion. Newton ’ s greatest 
contribution was the uniﬁ cation of terrestrial and extraterrestrial (celestial) 
forces when he pointed out that the motion of planets around the sun can be 
understood by the same laws that govern the motion on Earth. Newton ’ s laws 
make the foundation of classical physics, which includes Maxwell ’ s equation 
of EM forces, unifying the concept of electric and magnetic forces into one 
force: the EM force. All these concepts that make up the core of classical 
physics are reviewed in Chapter  1 in a concise, but cohesive fashion. The core 
assumption of classical physics is that physical entities exist in two different 
types: particles and waves. This assumption is clearly reﬂ ected in the fact that 
classical mechanics (mechanics of particles) and optics (as waves) are two 
independent disciplines in physics with their own set of principles and laws 
and with their own series of experiments and course works. So, Chapter  1 is 
oriented toward making a clear distinction between waves and particles: either 
you are a particle or you are a wave. This treatment by classical physics of 
particles and waves as two different types of entities mirrors the physical 
reality that we experience as macrobeings. It makes sense to us to treat mate-
rial bodies or objects as particles and to treat some other phenomena as waves 
that do not ﬁ t into the particle picture, such as a ripple that spreads out from 
a single point of impact when you throw a little rock into a body of still water. 
 However, as mentioned earlier, because the objects of the macroscopic 
world are constituted of the objects of the microscopic world, the physical 
reality experienced by us in the macroworld has its roots in the microworld. 
Just before (or during the early days of) probing the microworld, the laws of 
classical physics were working so well that some scientists toward the end of 
the nineteenth century were becoming rather smug and making statements 
such as the one by William Thomson Kelvin in 1900:  “ There is nothing new to 
be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise 
measurement. ” 

xxxviii  
PREFACE
 But even Kelvin knew that there were challenges coming from the micro-
world, which he referred to in his speech in 1900 to the Royal Institution as 
 “ two clouds on the horizon ” . The two clouds that Kelvin was referring to were 
the failure to ﬁ nd a medium through which EM waves would travel and the 
explanation of black - body radiation. The ﬁ rst cloud gave rise to Einstein ’ s 
theory of relativity, which is very brieﬂ y mentioned in Chapter  1 . The second 
cloud eventually led to the development of quantum physics. So much for 
Kelvin ’ s prediction of the end of physics. 
 Chapter  2 describes how the experimental results from experiments, such 
as black - body radiation and the photoelectric effect, challenged the notion 
that EM waves (light) were just waves. Black - body radiation was one of the 
ﬁ rst experiments where classical physics broke down in explaining the results 
from the microworld. It is shown how quantum concepts were introduced to 
explain experimental results. 
 Chapter  3 discusses how another set of experiments challenged the classical 
notion that particles, such as electrons, are just particles and not waves. It 
explains how the core assumption of classical physics that particles and waves 
are two separate components of the physical reality, breaks down in front of 
experimental results from the microworld. These results can only be explained 
with the particle – wave duality of nature: A physical entity acts as a particle 
under certain conditions and as waves under a different set of conditions. 
 Wave – particle duality is at the heart of quantum physics. It gives rise to two 
very important concepts in quantum physics: probability (or uncertainty) and 
quantization. An example of probability (or uncertainty) is that you cannot 
predict with certainty the position and momentum of an entity at a given 
instant; you can only assign probabilities to different possible values of posi-
tion and momentum. Quantization means that a conﬁ ned entity, such as an 
electron in an atom, is only allowed to have certain discreet values of energy. 
Both of these concepts go against the grain of classical physics, where you can 
predict the position and momentum of a particle at a given moment and the 
particle can have any energy, not only certain discrete values of energy. 
However, as Chapter  4 explains, this quantum picture explains the experimen-
tal results well from the study of atoms in terms of Bohr ’ s model. His model 
explains in a somewhat ad hoc way how quantization keeps the electron in 
the atom from collapsing into the nucleolus as predicted by classical physics. 
Chapter  4 also describes how Bohr ’ s model explains the spectral lines emitted 
by heated gases, another puzzle that the physicists were facing toward the end 
of the nineteenth century. The Bohr model, although a semiclassical or semi-
quantum mechanical model, demonstrates the power of quantization. 
 So, Chapters  2 – 4 introduce in a logical way some fundamentals of quantum 
mechanics in terms of the hypotheses and laws put forward by different sci-
entists in the beginning of the twentieth century to explain some physical 
phenomena that classical physics failed to explain. Chapter  5 puts these fun-
damentals together into a few postulates and develops a minimal formalism 
of quantum mechanics for the rest of the book. This chapter also shows how 

PREFACE  xxxix
these postulates can be summed together into one equation: The Schr ö dinger 
equation, the fundamental equation of quantum physics. 
 Chapter  6 is devoted to taking the mystery out of the Schr ö dinger equation 
by examining its solutions through its application to simple, but abundantly 
practical problems, such as conﬁ nement and vibration (or oscillation). Most of 
the systems in the universe are conﬁ ned or bonded to their environment, such 
as in electrons in an atom, atoms in a molecule, and so on. It is a natural ten-
dency of a system to be in equilibrium, and when disturbed it will oscillate (or 
vibrate) about its equilibrium position, such as atoms in a molecule or a crystal. 
These countless examples in nature can be modeled in various ways, such as 
a particle in a box (conﬁ nement) and a harmonic oscillator (vibrations about 
an equilibrium position). While applying the Schr ö dinger equation to these 
two situations in Chapter  6 , we demonstrate how solving the Schr ö dinger 
equation naturally gives rise to the principles and laws of quantum mechanics 
discussed in the previous chapters. 
 All matter (living and nonliving) is made up of atoms. Hydrogen, which 
makes up 9.5% of the human body mass, consists of the simplest atom: A 
conﬁ ned system of one electron bound to one proton in the nucleus. Chapter 
 7 demonstrates how applying the Schr ö dinger equation to this simple system 
naturally gives rise to some quantum mechanical concepts and principles, such 
as quantization, principle quantum number, orbital quantum number, mag-
netic quantum number, and the rules associated with these quantum numbers. 
 The structure and properties of atoms show a pattern displayed in the 
periodic table of elements. One of the greatest triumphs of quantum mechan-
ics is to present an explanation for this pattern. This topic is discussed in 
Chapter  8 , which also introduces the quantum mechanical concept of spin and 
spin quantum number along with Pauli ’ s exclusion principle, regarding the 
occupation of quantum states. The exclusion principle also plays an important 
role in determining the electronic conﬁ guration of atoms. 
 Atoms bound together to make molecules including the molecules of life: 
carbohydrates, DNA, lipids, and proteins. The quantum states of molecules in 
terms of rotation and vibration of diatomic molecules are discussed in the 
framework of molecular spectroscopy in Chapter  9 . There are many physical, 
chemical, and biological situations in which a large number of atoms or mol-
ecules are involved. The behavior of such collections or assemblies and the 
relationships of individual constituents to the collection are studied in statisti-
cal mechanics: statistics fused with mechanical laws. Some basic concepts and 
principles of statistical mechanics are developed in Chapter  10 , where we 
clearly explore the interface between classical and quantum statistical mechan-
ics. The vibrations and rotations of molecules are revisited in the collective 
statistical environment. 
 Now that almost all the sciences, including biology, chemistry, materials 
science, and computer science, that began with macroscopic studies are meeting 
physics in the microscopic, including the nano, world of molecules and atoms, 
the twenty - ﬁ rst century is shaping up to be the molecular age. Due to these

PREFACE
common issues and problems that scientists are dealing with on this size scale, 
this area in all sciences is collectively developing as nanoscience. The develop-
ing ﬁ eld of nanotechnology, the application of nanoscience, is increasingly 
allowing us to handle molecules and atoms at individual levels. Chapter  11 
discusses quantum mechanics as a common thread through different ﬁ elds of 
nanoscience and nanotechnology. 
 P.7  BACK TO THE FUTURE 
 History repeats itself in interesting ways at various levels. As already men-
tioned, all science disciplines that directly or indirectly emerged from one 
discipline, which was natural philosophy, are now converging in many ways 
into one ﬁ eld called nanoscience and its application, which is nanotechnology. 
Quantum physics, being the science of the small, is the common thread that 
runs through all these ﬁ elds at the nano and smaller scales. 
 Finally, let us borrow a metaphor and its elaboration from Richard Feynman 
who, once referring to an unknown poet, said  “ The whole universe is in a glass 
of wine ” . We do not know what the poet really meant by this, but a number 
of scientists from different disciplines sitting around a wine glass can together 
actually see the entire universe in it. A biologist, for example, sees the fermen-
tation, the bacteria, and hence life. A chemist sees an interesting array of 
chemicals, ferments, enzymes, product, whereas a physicist sees the reﬂ ections 
and refraction in the glass, and the swirling evaporating liquid. Physicists and 
chemists both see the molecules of alcohol and atoms, such as carbon, hydro-
gen, and oxygen; the physicist sees protons and neutrons in the nucleus of the 
atoms and the quarks from which the atoms are composed. These are the same 
quarks from which the whole universe is made. Where did the glass come 
from? Rocks  … fossils  … secrets of life and the universe  … evolution of stars 
 … we can go on and on. I do not want to spoil the party, but remember, it is 
our small minds (our limitations), that divide this glass of wine, the universe, 
into physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and so on; nature sees no such 
divisions. 
 So, again about this glass of wine in the words of Feynman: 
 “ Let ’ s put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let 
it give us one more ﬁ nal pleasure: drink it and forget it all! ” The party of life 
and the dance of the universe will continue. Take this book as a micro or 
quantum celebration of this party.

notable thinkers of the past. ” This metaphor, ﬁ rst recorded in the twelfth century and 
attributed to Bernard of Chartres, a twelfth century French Platonist philosopher, was 
famously used by seventeenth - century scientist Isaac Newton. Newton himself was 
rather modest about his own achievements, when in his famous letter to Robert Hooke 
in February 1676, he wrote  “ If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of

 1.1  INTRODUCTION 
 Physics is a discipline in natural science, the branch of science that relies the 
most on mathematics to create an explanation of the universe we live in. The 
word  science has its origin in a Latin word that means  “ to know ” . Science is 
the body of knowledge of the natural world organized in a rational and veriﬁ -
able way. The word  physics has its origin in the Greek word that means nature. 

PHYSICS AND CLASSICAL PHYSICS  3
Physics is that branch, or discipline, of science that deals with understanding 
the universe and the systems in the universe to all levels of depth from planets 
to fundamental constituents of matter, such as atoms, electrons, and quarks. 
The core part of physics is to understand the universe and everything in it in 
terms of the fundamental constituents of matter and the interactions between 
those constituents. The interactions are commonly called forces. 
 As human, we are macroorganisms unable to observe the microobjects and 
phenomenon with our naked eyes. However, what worked for us as a species 
that we are cognizant of phenomena in and around the range we live in. In 
other words, we have the capability of studying and understanding something 
that is beyond our intuition. The distance between two points that we resolve 
with our eyes is on the order of one - tenth of a millimeter (mm), and the small-
est time between two instances that we can measure without the help of 
sophisticated tools is on the order of one - tenth of a second(s). Therefore, the 
journey of physics, and hence science, began by studying the macroobjects and 
systems. The physics of these macrosystems is called classical physics. 
Therefore it is important to understand and appreciate classical physics before 
we can understand quantum physics. This chapter presents a high - level review 
of the important concepts in classical physics in a concise and cohesive fashion. 
If you are not sure of any concept covered in this chapter, consult an introduc-
tory physics book for help from the list presented at the end of this book. 
 Classical physics divides the physical world into two types of physical 
entities: particles and waves. Your main goal in this chapter is to grasp the 
classical approach of physics in terms of particles and waves being different 
kinds of entities. To that end, we will explore three avenues: particles, waves, 
and forces. 
 1.2  PHYSICS AND CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 As mentioned earlier, at its core physics is that branch of science that deals 
with understanding the universe and the systems in the universe in terms of 
fundamental constituents of matter, such as atoms, electrons, and the interac-
tions among those constituents. 
 
 Note :  When physicists use the word micro, they usually mean all sizes nonmacro, 
including micro (10  − 6 ), nano (10  − 9 ), pico (10  − 12 ), and smaller. In this sense, the 
microscale word includes nanoscale. We also use the micro word in this book in 
this sense unless stated otherwise. 
 Physics, the most fundamental science, deals with (discovering and explor-
ing) the fundamental principles that are subsequently applied to many other 
disciplines of science and technology, such as biology, chemistry, material 

4  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
science, electronics, engineering, and nanotechnology. Think of basic physics 
principles being used in building practical devices and systems, such as radio, 
television, cellular phone, or an radio frequency identiﬁ cation (RFID) system, 
and think of the whole ﬁ eld of physical chemistry and biophysics. Physics, 
undoubtedly, has been the foundation of all engineering and technology. 
Understanding and application of physics laws is necessary from designing a 
mousestrap to designing and building a ﬂ at screen TV, a sports car, and a 
spacecraft. Depending on the history of their development, some ﬁ elds, such 
as chemistry and engineering, have been ahead of other ﬁ elds, such as biology, 
in making use of physics. It is expected that in the coming years, physics, 
especially quantum physics, will be used enormously in the process of under-
standing entities and phenomena in various ﬁ elds of biosciences, including 
biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and even evolution. 
 Despite its sophisticated theories, physics, at the end of the day, is an 
experimental science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature, ﬁ nd the 
patterns and relationships among those phenomena, and try to explain this in 
terms of models and theories, which after rigorous experimental tests are 
established as physical laws or principles. 
 
 Caution :   The notion that a theory is just a theory, just a random thought, an 
abstract idea, or an unproven concept, is an incorrect notion. Scientists use this 
word as follows: A theory is an explanation of a natural phenomenon or a set of 
phenomena based on observation. By deﬁ nition, a theory is falsiﬁ able and faces the 
tests of experiments for its acceptance among the scientiﬁ c community. The theory 
of gravitation, the theory of uniﬁ cation of forces, and the theory of biological evolu-
tion, known as Darwin ’ s theory of evolution, are all examples of such theories, also 
called scientiﬁ c theories. 
 The development of physical theories and principles is an endless process 
of back - and - forth between ideas and experiments. Scientists never regard any 
theory as ﬁ nal or as the ultimate truth. On the contrary, they are always 
looking for new observations that will require us to revise a theory or to 
discard it for a better one. By its very nature, a scientiﬁ c theory can be dis-
proved by ﬁ nding phenomena and behavior that are inconsistent with it, but 
a theory can never be proved to be always correct. As you will see in this book, 
the development of quantum physics is a good example of this process of 
developing scientiﬁ c theories. 
 Before quantum physics, we had classical physics, which is reviewed or 
overviewed in this chapter. In order to get through this chapter smoothly, let 
us review some basic concepts related to physics: 
 Particle.  A particle is a small object that behaves as a whole unit in terms 
of its motion, properties, and behavior. Although one usually thinks of 
a particle as a very small object, there is no size limit on what can be 

PHYSICS AND CLASSICAL PHYSICS  5
treated as a particle. A point particle is an idealized and simpliﬁ ed rep-
resentation of an entity. It can be fully described as having a spatial 
extent of zero (size zero), and therefore its position is completely deﬁ ned 
by one set of coordinates ( x, y, z ), called Cartesian coordinates. Given 
it is a point, it obviously has no internal structure. While its geometry 
is simple, it can, however, have properties associated with it, such as 
mass and electrical charge. In many cases, this approximation works well 
in understanding the overall behavior of a system and getting out rea-
sonable quantitative results. As seen later in this book, this concept can 
also be used to represent the center of mass of a system, a reference 
frame. 
 So, if one point in an object can be located to determine its position 
in space, in order to simplify the discussion of its motion we can treat 
this object as a point particle, also referred to as a particle for brevity. 
Any object can be considered a particle as long as we are not interested 
in its internal structure and rotational motion. In some cases, large 
objects, such as the Sun, can be modeled as point particles for the 
determination of certain characteristics or quantities. For example, to 
determine the orbit of the Earth around the Sun it is reasonable to 
assume that all of the Sun ’ s mass is concentrated at one point, its 
geometric center. It is a good approximation for determining the force 
exerted on the Earth and thus determining the Earth ’ s orbit. As 
another example, the molecules in the kinetic molecular theory of 
gases are considered as particles. Once you start considering the 
rotation of molecules and the fact that that they are made of atoms 
(internal structure), you can no more treat them as particles (i.e., point 
particles). 
 When we want to study the internal structure and dynamics of an 
object, the object is no more a particle, it is a system. 
 
 Note :  Over centuries, physicists have invented several coordinate systems to 
describe the position and motion of a physical entity in space. Depending on the 
nature of the entity and the problem, one coordinate system may be more conve-
nient than others. For example, you know from your introductory physics course 
that translational motion is usually better described in a Cartesian coordinate 
system, and circular or rotational motion is usually better described in polar 
coordinates. 
 System.  A system is a set of distinct entities often interacting with one 
another. A system has a structure deﬁ ned by its constituents, which have 
a structural as well as functional relationship with one another. A system 
as a whole has some characteristics and a certain behavior. For example, 
an atom is a system constituted of electrons, protons, and possible neu-
trons. Similarly, planets revolving around the Sun make up a system 

6  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
called the solar system. An organism, such as a human being, is also a 
system composed of organs; and a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mole-
cule inside an organism is a system composed of smaller components 
called nucleotides. 
 Physical Quantity.    A measurable observable, for example energy of an 
entity, such as a particle or a system, is called a physical quantity. A 
physical quantity describes an aspect of an object or a phenomenon 
quantitatively. In physics, we understand the universe, the systems in the 
universe, and their behavior in terms of physical quantities, as well as the 
relationships among these physical quantities. In other words, laws of 
physics are usually expressed in terms of relationships among the physi-
cal quantities. Mass, electric charge, length, time, speed, force, energy, and 
temperature are some examples of physical quantities. This book will use 
the term observable and physical quantity interchangeably. 
 Unit.   A physical quantity is measured in numbers of a basic amount called 
a unit. The measurement of a quantity contains a number and a unit, for 
example, in 15 miles, the mile is a unit of distance (or length). Similarly, 
a kilogram (kg) is a unit of mass. 
 Force.  The inﬂ uence that an object exerts on another object to cause some 
change is the force. Where there is change, there is some force behind it. 
Motion of an object is an example of change. The change, for example, 
could be in the physical properties, such as the speed or position (loca-
tion) of the object. The exact nature of this change will be determined 
by some physical principles, such as Newton ’ s laws of motion, which is 
described later in this chapter. 
 Interaction.   A mutual force between two objects through which they inﬂ u-
ence each other is an interaction. For example, two particles attract each 
other due to an attractive force or repel each other due to a repulsive 
force between them. Sometimes the words  interaction and  force are used 
synonymously. There are four known fundamental interactions or forces: 
(1) gravitational force; (2) electromagnetic force; (3) strong nuclear 
force; and (4) weak nuclear force. 
 For example, most of the forces that chemistry students learn about, 
such as covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and London 
dispersion force, are different manifestations of the electromagnetic 
(EM) force. 
 Where there is a force there is energy, or the potential for energy, 
called potential energy. Force acting on a particle results in a change in 
the kinetic or potential energy of the particle. 
 Speed.    The speed describes the motion of a particle. To be precise it is the 
change in position with time. For example, your car is moving at a speed 
of 70 miles per hour (mph). When you specify the direction of the speed, 
it becomes velocity. For example, the velocity of your car at a given 
moment could be 70  mph toward the North. 

PHYSICS AND CLASSICAL PHYSICS  7
 Energy.  The measure of the ability of a force to do work is energy. There are 
different kinds of energies corresponding to different forces, such as EM 
energy corresponding to EM force, nuclear energy corresponding to 
nuclear forces, and so on. All of these energies have the same units. Flow 
of energy, that is, energy transfer, is a key to maintaining order in the 
universe and in our bodies. For example, energy ﬂ ows from the Sun to 
the plants, and from the plants to our bodies in the form of food. Energy 
can be converted from one form to another, but it can neither be created 
nor destroyed. This is called the principle of conservation of energy. For 
example, in your microwave oven, the EM energy that you buy from your 
power company is converted into heat energy that warms (or cooks) your 
food; the form is changed, not the total content of the energy. 
 Work.   A measure of the amount of change produced by a force acting on 
an object is work. For example, gravitational force between the Sun and 
the Earth is making the Earth revolve around the Sun. In doing so, Earth 
is doing some work. But how is it possible that two objects separated 
from each other can exert force on each other? This is where the concept 
of ﬁ eld comes into the picture. 
 Power.   The energy transferred per unit time or the amount of work done 
by a force per unit time is power. 
 Field.  The fundamental forces of nature can work between two objects 
without the objects physically touching each other. For example, Sun and 
Earth attract each other through gravitational force without touching 
each other. Two charged particles attract or repel each other through EM 
force without touching each other. This effect is called  action at a distance 
and is explained in physics by the concept of a  ﬁ eld . Each of the two 
objects that, for example, attract or repel each other from a distance, 
create a ﬁ eld in the space. This is the ﬁ eld that exerts the force on the 
other object. For example, there is a gravitational ﬁ eld corresponding to 
the gravitational force and an EM ﬁ eld corresponding to the EM force, 
and so on. 
 For the purpose of visualization, the force applied through a ﬁ eld 
is often represented in terms of ﬁ eld lines. For example, Figure  1.1 
illustrates electric ﬁ eld lines around positively and negatively charged 
particles. As shown in this ﬁ gure, electric ﬁ eld lines always point away 
from a positively charged particle and point toward a negatively charged 
particle. The symbol  

E stands for an electric ﬁ eld, and the arrow on  E 
means the electric ﬁ eld is a vector. 
 A physical quantity can be a scalar or a vector. 
 Scalars and Vectors.   A scalar is a quantity that has a magnitude, but no 
direction. For example, a speed of 70  mph is a scalar. A vector is a quan-
tity that has both magnitude and direction. For example, a speed of 

8  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
70  mph toward the North is a vector. Speed in a speciﬁ ed direction is 
called velocity. 
 Scalar quantities can be multiplied just like numbers, whereas vector 
quantities can undergo any of two kinds of multiplication called scalar 
product and vector product. The scalar product of two vectors

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 Classical physics looks at the universe in terms of material bodies 
and waves. These material bodies, their structures, and their behavior are 
understood in terms of what are called physical quantities, which were 
explained earlier. Many physical quantities of material bodies can be studied 
by treating them as point particles. So, you can say that classical physics 
divides the physical world into particles and waves. 
 1.3  THE CLASSICAL WORLD OF PARTICLES 
 The Greek philosopher Aristotle is considered by many to be the ﬁ rst physi-
cist. What is known as classical physics or Newtonian physics today is a result 
of the scientiﬁ c work of an enormous number of scientists across several 
centuries, starting from Aristotle (384 – 322 BC) to Galileo Galilei (1564 –
 1642), to Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727), to James Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879). 
The goal of this chapter is not to present a full review of the classical physics, 
but rather brieﬂ y explore a few concepts in a cohesive way in order to 
establish the big cohesive picture of classical physics to capture the key 
characteristics of the classical approach. It is important for you to understand 
and appreciate the classical approach to physics in order to fully understand 
how this approach was challenged by experimental results and how this 
challenge was met with the quantum approach, which developed into 
quantum physics, also called quantum mechanics, as opposed to classical 
mechanics. 
 In Section  1.2 , we explored some physical quantities; many more can be 
listed, and it can become very overwhelming. However, here is the good news: 
Recall all introductory physics courses that you might have taken, and it will 
not be hard to realize that most of the physics is based on the following three 
fundamental concepts: 
 Existence of an Entity.   A physical entity, such as a material particle, exists 
with some deﬁ ning physical characteristics, such as mass and charge, 
pertaining to the existence of the entity. Physical entities can also be 
waves, which we will introduce later in this chapter. 
 Position in Space.   At a given moment, the particle exists at some point in 
a three - dimensional (3D) space. This point is represented by using some 
coordinate system, such as a Cartesian coordinate system with rectangu-
lar coordinates  x, y , and  z , as shown in Figure  1.3 . 
 Time.   The particle exists at a speciﬁ c point in space and at some speciﬁ c 
time. 
 Note :  A material body or particle is a physical entity that contains mass and occu-
pies space. 

THE CLASSICAL WORLD OF PARTICLES  11
 It is important to realize that before describing the motion of a par-
ticle in space, we ﬁ rst must be able to determine the particle ’ s position 
at a given time. 
 As mentioned earlier, physics relies mostly on mathematics to develop 
scientiﬁ c explanations for entities and their behavior: the phenomena. It 
is time to demonstrate this phenomena by putting the physical quantities 
described earlier in their mathematical form. In addition, we will also 
derive these quantities from the three fundamental concepts just 
described. 
 One of these concepts, the position, (see Fig.  1.3 ) of a particle at a 
point  P at a certain moment, is described by a vector  r that goes from 
the origin of the coordinate system to point  P . The position vector, as it 
is called, can be resolved into three component vectors along the  x - ,  y - , 
and  z - axis:

where  x ,  y , and  z are the magnitudes of the position vector in the  x ,  y , 
and  z direction; and  ˆι,  ˆj,  ˆk are the unit vectors along the  x ,  y , and  z 
direction. The magnitude of the position vector is given by
 
 r
x
y
z
=
+

 (1.4) 
 If you are considering motion in a straight line or in just one dimen-
sion, you can treat the vector quantities as scalar, because the direction 
is known and ﬁ xed. This is exactly what we are doing for most of the 
quantities in the rest of this section for simplicity.

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 So, the most fundamental issue in physics is the existence of a physical 
entity at a speciﬁ c point in space and time, and the rest of physics can 
be derived by throwing in a time - related concept called change, for 
example, the change of position of the entity in time. This change creates 
motion, which in turn gives rise to quantities like momentum and energy. 
 
 Note :  Change may also apply to other fundamental properties of an entity. For 
example, later in this chapter you will see, that change in electric charge at a point 
with respect to time generates electric current. 
 The classical world of particles is explained in terms of some physical quanti-
ties derived from the three fundamental concepts discussed here. 
 1.4  PHYSICAL QUANTITIES 
 Physical entities (material bodies and waves) exist in space deﬁ ned, for 
example, by the spatial coordinates ( x, y, z ) in the Cartesian coordinate system 
and by temporal coordinate,  t . Figure  1.4 illustrates an example of how other 
physical quantities can be derived from three basic quantities: mass  m of the 
particle, position  x of the particle, and time  t corresponding to three funda-
mental concepts discussed earlier: 
  •   Distance.   The distance (displacement)  d that the particle has traveled 
during a time interval can be measured as the change in position ( x ) in this 
time duration:
 
 d
x
x
=

 (1.5) 
 Meter (m) is a unit of distance; so is a mile. 
  •   Velocity.  Velocity,  v , of a particle at a given moment is simply the rate of 
change of position of the particle with time represented by
 
 v
dx
dt
=
 
 (1.6) 
 Velocity is a vector quantity, that is, it has a magnitude and a direction. 
The magnitude alone is called speed. Meters per second (m/s) is a unit of 
velocity or speed; so is mile/s. 
  •   Momentum.   The momentum  p of a particle is the product of its mass and 
velocity:
 
 p
mv
m dx

 (1.7)

 Energy has the same unit as work. 
 Energy.  As mentioned earlier, the ability of a force to do work on an object 
is called energy. The work done by a force on an object is stored in the 
object in some form of energy. For example, assume you lift a body of 
mass  m from the ground straight up and put it on a platform that is at a 
height  h from the ground. In doing so, you have done work,  W g , against 
the gravitational force,  F g  =  mg , where  g is the acceleration due to gravity. 
The work done by you has been stored into the body as its potential 
energy,  E p :

 (1.12) 
 When an external force works on a body at rest and gives it a speed of 
 v , the work done on the body is equal to the kinetic energy,  E k , achieved 
by the body given by
 
 E
mv
k = 1
2
2  
 (1.13) 
 In general, the work done on a body is equal to the energy gained by the 
body and the work done by the body is equal to the energy lost by the 
body. For example, when you lifted up an object the energy was lost by 
your body and gained by the object that was lifted up. Overall, energy 
stayed conserved.

 Caution :  Many quantities discussed here, such as velocity, acceleration, force, and 
momentum, are vector quantities; that is, they have magnitude as well as direction. 
For simplicity, in our treatment of these quantities, for the purpose at hand, we are 
only considering the magnitude in writing the equations, or alternatively consider-
ing these quantities in only one dimension, along the  x - axis. 
 In a nutshell, motion is caused by the change in position of an entity. But, 
what causes the change and exactly how does it occur? The work of several 
scientists over centuries elegantly put the answers to this question into three 
laws of motion by Issac Newton. 
 1.5  NEWTON ’ S LAWS OF MOTION 
 In an introductory physics course, you learn about these physical quantities 
by using point particles, that is, material entities with their mass concentrated 
at one point. Most of the physical quantities discussed so far describe the 
motion, or mechanics, of particles, and therefore belong to the branch of 
classical physics called classical mechanics. Classical mechanics is based on 
Newton ’ s three laws of motion discussed in the following. 

16  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 First Law.   A physical body, or object, will continue in its state of rest or of 
uniform motion in a straight line until acted upon by an external force . 
 
 Note :  Newton ’ s ﬁ rst law answers this question: If the position and momentum of a 
particle is known at time  t  =  0, what will be the position and momentum of the 
particle at some later time  t in the absence of any external force? 
 In other words, the ﬁ rst law states that in the absence of any external 
force the motion of a body does not change: The body stays in a 
state of equilibrium. However, it does not necessarily mean that no 
force is acting on the body. For the body to be in equilibrium, the net 
result, that is, the vector sum, of all the forces acting on a body should 
be zero:
 
 

F
∑
= 0  
 (1.15) 
 What if there is some nonzero net force acting on the body? This is when 
the second law of motion comes into the picture. 
 Second Law.   If a net external force acts on a body, the body accelerates in 
the same direction as the force. The magnitude of the acceleration a is 
directly proportional to the force F that causes it: 
 a
F
∞
 
 This means
 a
CF
=
 
where  C is the proportionality constant and is equal to the inverse of the 
mass of the object:  C  =  1/ m . 
 Therefore,
 
 F
ma
=

 It can also be written by using Eqs.  1.7 and  1.8 as:

 (1.17) 
 Equation  1.17 is the fundamental equation of Newtonian mechanics, 
where  p , the product of mass and speed of an entity, is called its 
momentum. 
 

NEWTON’S LAWS OF MOTION  17
 Note :  Newton ’ s ﬁ rst and second law answer this question: If the position and 
momentum of a particle is known at time  t  =  0, what will be the position and 
momentum of the particle at some later time  t under the inﬂ uence of a net force 
force  F . If  F  =  0, we are talking about the ﬁ rst law. 
 The second law states how an object ’ s motion changes when an 
external force is applied on it. What else does an object do in response 
to an external force? This question is answered by the third law of 
motion. 
 Third Law.  When a body A exerts a force on a body B, then as a reaction, 
body B exerts back an equal and opposite force on body A. Equal and 
opposite means that the two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite 
in direction. It is also stated as: Action and reaction are equal and 
opposite. Therefore, this law is also known as the law of action and 
reaction, which means forces always occur in pairs. It can mathematically 
be represented as:
 
 


F
F
21
21
= −
 
 (1.18) 
 
 Caution :  Do not think that because these forces are equal and opposite, they will 
cancel out. Remember that these forces are being applied on two different bodies. 
They would have canceled out if they were working on the same body at the same 
point. 
 PROBLEM 1.2 
 Derive the ﬁ rst law of motion from the second law of motion. 
 Solution: 
 From the second law of motion:
 F
ma
m dv
dt
dp
dt
=
=
=
 
 This means that if  F is zero,  a  =  0, which in turn means if no force is applied on the 
object, the object will keep moving with the uniform (constant) velocity  v with 
which it is currently moving, or it will stay at rest if it is currently at rest. 
 It can be proved that the second law is the fundamental law from which 
the ﬁ rst and third laws can be derived.

 Note :   Newton ’ s three laws of motion based on the work of several scientists, includ-
ing Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo Galilei, and Newton himself, represent a great 
intellectual feat of humans on this planet. These three rather simple laws can be 
applied to any system until certain limits are hit with respect to size and speed. For 
very small sizes, Newtonian physics is replaced with quantum physics, and for very 
high speeds (closer to the speed of light), Newtonian physics is replaced with rela-
tivistic physics based on Einstein ’ s theory of relativity. More on this later in this 
chapter. 
 So far, we have deﬁ ned the concepts and some basic physical quantities 
related to motion in a straight line. However, Newton ’ s laws also apply 
to motion that is not in a straight line, rotational motion. 
 1.6  ROTATIONAL MOTION 
 Motion can also occur in a curvy or circular fashion called rotation. As illus-
trated in Figure  1.5 , the position of a particle in circular motion (in two dimen-
sions, 2D) can be determined by the radius,  r , of the circle, and the angle   θ 
that it makes with a ﬁ xed direction by extending an arc of length  s . The rela-
tionship between these three quantities is given by
 
 θ = s
r
 
 (1.19) 
 The units of angle   θ determined this way are in radians (rad) and are related 
to degrees as follows:

 This is an example of a polar coordinate system in 2D. The basic quantities 
related to rotation are derived in the following: 
 Angular Velocity.   Because the angle   θ speciﬁ es the position of a particle in 
polar coordinates at a given moment, the rotational motion (velocity) of 
the particle can be deﬁ ned in terms of the rate of change of   θ . This means 
the angular velocity,   ω , of a particle moving in a circle of radius,  r , is 
deﬁ ned as the rate of change in the angle   θ with time:
 
 ω

 (1.20) 
 Therefore,
 
 v

= ω  
 (1.21) 
 To derive Eq.  1.20 , we have used the deﬁ nition of   θ  =  s / r . Equation  1.21 
gives the relationship between the linear velocity,  v , along the length of 
the curve and the angular velocity   ω along the curve. The direction of 
the linear velocity  v is tangent to the curve. Note that even if the linear 
velocity  v is constant in magnitude, its direction is continuously changing, 
so it is under acceleration in that sense. Hence,  v is changing. The accel-
eration of a particle moving in a circle can be presented in terms of 
centripetal and tangent components. 
 Centripetal Acceleration.   The component of the acceleration along the 
radius of the circle and directed toward the center of the circle, called 
centripetal acceleration, is given by

where  M is the mass of the Earth and the satellite is revolving around

 Isaac Newton (1643 – 1727) 
 Isaac Newton, the great physicist and 
mathematician, was born on 4 January 1643 
in Woolsthorpe - by - Colsterworth, England. 
He studied and did most of his work at 
Cambridge, where he became professor of 
mathematics. His 1687 publication of the 
 Philosophi æ Naturalis Principia 
Mathematica (usually called the  Principia ) 
in 1687 is among the most inﬂ uential books 
in the history of science. It laid the 
groundwork for most of classical mechanics. 
In this work, Newton presented three laws 
of motion that make up the core of classical 
mechanics. In addition, his work includes 
the universal law of gravitation, principles 
of conservation of momentum and angular 
momentum, and theory of colors. He 
developed the ﬁ rst reﬂ ecting telescope. 
 Newton shares the credit with Gottfried 
Leibniz for the development of differential 
and integral calculus. Newton died in his 
sleep in London on 31 March 1727.

we have derived from the three fundamental concepts (mass, position, 
and time), we can describe complex motion of physical objects or 
particles. 
 So far, we have treated particles pretty much separated from each 
other. However, it is an interesting world and interesting things happen 
when particles (like people) interact with each other. The physical inter-
action with direct touch is called collision. 
 1.7  SUPERPOSITION AND COLLISION OF PARTICLES 
 It is convenient to illustrate some physical concepts by using just one particle. 
However, in the real world particles hardly ever exist alone. They tend to exist 
as colonies or communities, and therefore they interact with each other. They 
collide with each other and scatter, their properties superpose. Scattering and 
superposition are important characteristics of particle interactions. 
 1.7.1  Superposition 
 To understand superposition, you ﬁ rst must understand the resolution of a 
physical vector quantity, such as velocity, into its components. As demon-
strated in Figure  1.6 by using velocity as an example, the component of a 
vector in a given direction is the projection of the vector on a line in that 
direction. Figure  1.6 shows the projections of a velocity vector  v on the axes 

SUPERPOSITION AND COLLISION OF PARTICLES  23
of the rectangular (Cartesian) coordinate system:  x, y, z . These projections are 
called rectangular components of velocity and are denoted as  v x , v y , v z :

where  v x , v y , v z are the magnitudes of the vector  v in the  x, y , and  z directions, 
respectively. The magnitude of the vector  v can be written in terms of the 
magnitudes of its components:

 Note that we have combined the magnitudes of the components to obtain 
the magnitude of the original vector. Similarly, you can also combine the com-
ponents of two vectors to get a single vector called the resultant vector. This 
property is called superposition of vectors. 
 As you learned in your introductory physics course, superposition of vector 
physical quantities, such as velocity and force, is of utmost importance. For 
example, any number of forces applied at a particle (or at a point of a body) 
has the same effect as a single force that is equal to the vector sum of all the 
individual forces. In other words, the forces combine or superpose. Figure  1.7 a 
illustrates an example of two forces  F1

  and  F2

 acting at a point on a box in 
an  x – y plane. The effect of these forces is the same as the force  FR
 
, which is 
the vector sum of the two forces. As shown in Figure  1.7 b, the two individual 
forces can be vectorially added by ﬁ rst resolving into their components.

 We have demonstrated superposition in a 2D plane, but the extension 
into 3D space, and thereby using all the three coordinates ( x, y , and  z ) is 
straightforward. Then, we will also have  z components of each force, which we 
add to obtain  FRz, and the magnitude of the resultant force becomes

 Also, there could be more than two forces acting on a particle. You decompose 
each of the forces acting on a particle into three coordinates, and then recom-
bine their components along each coordinate to obtain the resultant force. By 
now, you should be able to realize that a number of forces acting on a particle 
may result in a net force of zero, that is, the components of all the forces along 
each of the three coordinates add up to zero. A particle (or a body) with zero 
resultant force acting on it is a particle in equilibrium. Zero force means zero 
acceleration, not necessarily zero speed; it may have a constant speed or a 
uniform velocity. Equilibrium of a particle with zero velocity is called static 
equilibrium and the equilibrium of a particle with uniform velocity is called 
dynamic equilibrium. 
 Of course, you can apply superposition to other vector physical quantities 
as well, such as velocity. 
 
 Note :  In the context of equilibrium, you can restate Newton ’ s ﬁ rst law of motion 
as: A particle in equilibrium will stay in equilibrium until and unless acted upon by 
an external force. 

SUPERPOSITION AND COLLISION OF PARTICLES  25
 1.7.2  Collision and Scattering 
 A car accident on a freeway and balls colliding on a billiard table are both 
examples of collisions. So are the two beams of protons colliding at a gigantic 
particle collider at CERN (a particle physics lab near Geneva, Switzerland). 
 However, for our purpose, consider a simple system of two particles A and 
B, as shown in Figure  1.8 , moving with momentum  

PA,  and  

PB; kinetic energy 
 T A ,  and T B ; and total energy  E A , and  E B . So the momentum and energy of the 
system before collision are given by

 Now, the two particles collide and in general may have a different velocity and

momentum. Assume that after the collision, the two particles are moving with

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 Assume there is no external force acting on the system. Then, according to 
the principle of momentum conservation, the momentum of the system after 
the collision will be equal to the momentum of the system before the 
collision:
 


′ =
P
P  
 Also, according to the principle of energy conservation, the total energy of 
the system after the collision will be equal to the total energy of the system 
before the collision:
 ′ =
E
E  
 Even though the energy is conserved, its form can change, and it is the toal 
energy that is conserved. Therefore, one speciﬁ c form of energy, such as 
kinetic energy, does not have to be conserved. If the kinetic energy of the 
system after the collision is the same as before the collision, the collision is 
called elastic. If the total kinetic energy of the system changes as a result of 
the collision, the collision is called an inelastic collision. 
 Because the particles as a result of collision deviate from their original path, 
they can be considered as scattered, and the process is called scattering. You 
can imagine that when there are a large number of particles, such as molecules, 
colliding with each other in an elastic fashion, they will be deﬂ ected from their 
path quite frequently. As a result, they will be moving in a zigzag path. 
Such a motion is called Brownian motion. Yes, the billiard ball model of 
collision discussed in this section works well even at the microscopic scale of 
molecules and subatomic particles, such as protons and electrons; well enough 
to predict the behavior of participants to some degree of accuracy. Chapter  2 
discusses an example of collision (and hence scattering) called Compton scat-
tering, one of the few phenomenon that pushed physicists toward quantum 
mechanics. 
 In a nutshell, collision, scattering, and superposition are important charac-
teristics of particles. You will see that the concept of scattering and superposi-
tion also apply to waves, but in a different way. 
 The motion of particles can be considered as transportation of energy and 
momentum from one point to another in space. However, this leaves out a 
class of natural phenomena and physical entities, which can only be explained 
by using a concept called a wave. 
 1.8  CLASSICAL WORLD OF WAVES 
 A wave is a disturbance of some sort that propagates through space and trans-
fers some kind of energy from one point to another without transporting mass, 
which occurs with particles. For example, when you speak to a person face to 

CLASSICAL WORLD OF WAVES  27
face, the sound wave travels from your mouth to the ear of the listener. The 
propagating disturbance here is the change of pressure in the air. As long as 
the wave is traveling through a point, the air pressure at that point does not 
stay constant over time, and your ear and brain perceives the pressure change 
as a sound. You must also be familiar with the water waves (ripples) that you 
can see by throwing a rock in a pond with still water. As another familiar 
example, the light that you need to see anything is a result of an EM wave. 
The disturbance in an EM wave is the change in the electric and magnetic 
ﬁ eld. The wave can be looked upon as propagation of this disturbance. The 
EM wave is a wave that carries EM energy. You will learn more about these 
waves later in this chapter. One of the interesting things about EM waves is 
that they can travel through a vacuum. This means that they do not need a 
material medium to travel through, whereas sound waves and water waves are 
mechanical disturbances that require a physical medium such as air or water, 
to travel through. The EM radiation is an example of periodic waves. 
 1.8.1  Periodic Waves 
 Figure  1.9 illustrates a traveling sinusoidal wave by presenting snapshots of a 
wave at different times  t  =  0.5  T , 1  T , 1.5  T , and 2  T , where  T is the period of 
the wave, which is the time in which the wave travels a distance equal to its 
wavelength. 
 Wavelength is one of the deﬁ ning characteristics of a wave. 
 The wave illustrated in Figure  1.9 is called a periodic wave because the 
shape of the wave is the repetition of a pattern stretched from one crest to 
the next or from one trough to the next. 
 We can use the periodic wave to deﬁ ne some wave characteristics. 
 1.8.2  Deﬁ ning Wave Characteristics 
 As shown in Figure  1.10 , you can describe a wave in terms of some parameters, 
such as amplitude, frequency, and wavelength, as described in the following: 
 Wavelength.  Denoted by the symbol   λ , this is the distance between two 
consecutive crests or two consecutive troughs of a periodic wave. The 
distance equal to the wavelength makes one cycle of change. 
 Amplitude.   Amplitude is the maximum amount of disturbance during one 
wave cycle. 
 Velocity.  The velocity or speed,  v , of a wave is the speed with which the 
disturbance deﬁ ning the wave travels in space. As illustrated in Figure 
 1.11 , the wave pattern with length   λ travels with velocity  v and covers 
the distance  λ in time  T , the period of the wave. Therefore,

 The speed of a mechanical wave depends on the properties of the 
medium in which it propagates. The speed of EM waves in a vacuum is 
constant, which is the speed of light,  c , given by

 Frequency.   The frequency,  f , is the number of cycles per unit time a wave 
repeats at a given point:
 
 f

 (1.38)

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 where  T is the time to complete one cycle and is called a period. This 
translates to
 
 f
v
= λ  
 (1.39) 
 Therefore, the frequency of an EM wave,  f , propagating through free 
space (vacuum) is calculated by using the following equation:
 
 f
c
= λ  
 (1.40) 
 The frequency is measured in units of the hertz (Hz) and 1 cycle per 
second (cps) is 1  Hz. 
 Phase.  A phase is the current position in the cycle of change in a wave. 
 Wavefront.  The concept of wavefront is often used to describe the propaga-
tion of a wave. A wavefront is the locus, such as a line for a light ray in 
one dimension (ID) or a surface for a wave propagating in 3D, of points 
having the same phase. The locus is a mathematical entity (Latin for 
 “ place ” ) that represents a collection of points with a shared property. 
For example, in 2D, a circle is the locus of points that are at an equal 
distance from a single point, the center of the circle. In 3D, the surface 
of a sphere is a locus of points that are at an equal distance from one 
point, the center of the sphere. A sphere makes a spherical wavefront 
for the wave propagation in 3D space. 
 Some concepts, such as velocity and energy, are common to both 
particles and waves. Other concepts, such as frequency and wavelength, 
are speciﬁ c to waves, that is, in the framework of classical physics. 
Reﬂ ection of waves is very similar to the elastic collision of a material 
object in which the object strikes a wall and bounces back. Some other 
properties of waves, such as refraction and diffraction, are speciﬁ c to 
waves. In classical physics, the terms of diffraction and refraction are not 
applied to particles. Although reﬂ ection and scattering actually do apply 
to particle interactions. These and some other wave characteristics are 
discussed next. 
 1.9  REFLECTION, REFRACTION, AND SCATTERING 
 As a wave, such as a light wave, travels through a medium, it can scatter. Also, 
when a wave, such as a light wave, strikes an interface between two transpar-
ent materials, such as air and glass, it can go under reﬂ ection and refraction. 
These phenomena are described in the following. 

REFLECTION, REFRACTION, AND SCATTERING  31
 Reﬂ ection.   Reﬂ ection is deﬁ ned as the abrupt change in direction of a 
wavefront at an interface between two dissimilar media, so that the 
wavefront returns into the medium from which it hits the interface. For 
example, radio frequency (rf) waves, also called radio waves, are reﬂ ected 
when they strike the objects much larger than their wavelength, such as 
the ﬂ oor, ceiling, and support beam. Metals are an obstruction to the 
signal because they are good at reﬂ ecting radio waves. 
 Refraction.   Refraction is deﬁ ned as the change in direction of a wavefront 
at an interface between two dissimilar media, but the wavefront does not 
return back to the medium from which it hit the interface. For example, 
the radio waves bend when they pass from one medium into another. 
Figure  1.12 illustrates reﬂ ection and refraction. 
 Scattering.   Scattering is the phenomenon of absorbing a wave and reradiat-
ing it in various directions. Thereby it changes its direction of propaga-
tion from the original direction. Note that no absorption happens in 
particle scattering. As an example of wave scattering, consider the reﬂ ec-
tion of an EM wave, which is actually a scattering. For example, when a 
rf wave is scattered, it results in the loss of the signal or dispersion of the 
wave, as shown in Figure  1.13 . It happens due to the interaction of the 
wave with the medium at the molecular level. 
 An application of scattering is a radar that uses scattering to detect 
metallic objects, such as airplanes or speeding cars. 
 Two other important characteristics of waves are diffraction and 
interference, discussed next. 
 Figure 1.12.   Reﬂ ection and refraction of waves; only the direction of propagation is 
shown.

 1.10  DIFFRACTION AND INTERFERENCE 
 It will come as no surprise if I tell you that even if the person who is talking 
to you turns his back on you, you can still listen, because sound is a wave, and 
waves exhibit a characteristic (or a phenomenon) called diffraction. If sound 
was carried by a particle, you would never be able to listen to a person whose 
back is turned to you. 
 Diffraction and a related property called interference are described in the 
following sections. 
 1.10.1  Diffraction 
 Diffraction refers to the bending of a wave when it strikes sharp edges or when 
it passes through narrow gaps. This makes propagation of waves quite differ-
ent from the propagation of particles. The barrier will completely stop a 
particle coming at it as illustrated in Figure  1.14 a , whereas waves will bend 
around it to keep going as illustrated in Figure  1.14 b . This shows that in clas-
sical physics, the propagation of waves is very different from the propagation 
of a beam of particles. In the case of waves, the narrow opening in the barrier 
acts as a source. 
 Diffraction is related to a phenomenon called interference. 
 
 Figure 1.13.  An illustration of wave scattering; only the direction of propagation is 
shown.

Scattered Waves

 Note :  One of the main objectives of this chapter is to help you understand how 
waves and particles are treated as different types of physical entities in classical 
physics. If you do not feel comfortable with any of the concepts discussed here, you 
should review them by using a basic physics book before you proceed; a list of books 
is provided in the Bibliography section at the end of this book. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 1.3 
 Diffraction is the process in which a wave bends around an edge or a narrow 
opening. Why does this bending happen in waves and not in particles? 
 Solution: 
 The slit acts as a source of waves, whereas it does not act as a source of a beam of 
particles. This is a unique characteristic of waves that each wavefront act as a 
source; this is how waves propagate.

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 
 Thomas Young (1773 – 1829) 
 Thomas Young was born on June 13, 1773 
in Milverton, Somerset, England into a large 
Quaker family. He began studying medicine 
in 1792, and also became interested in pure 
science. Young was a true polymath for his 
time, with interests ranging from physics to 
physiology and medicine, to music, to 
languages, and egyptology; he studied and 
contributed to all these ﬁ elds. He obtained 
the degree of doctor of physics in 1796 from 
the University of G ö ttingen, Lower Saxony, 
Germany. 
 In 1801, Young was appointed as a 
lecturer at the recently formed Royal 
Institution in London, where he gave a 
series of lectures on a variety of topics. At 
that time, there was evidence for both 
pictures of light: waves and particles, and 
Newton was the proponent of the particle 
theory. In 1801, Thomas Young was 
intellectually bold enough to present a 
serious challenge to Newton ’ s ideas on the 
topic, even though Newton was so greatly 
revered as a scientist that it was nearly 
impossible for anyone to dispute his theory. 
 Thomas Young died on May 10, 1829 at 
the age of 55 in London, England. 
 1.10.2  Interference 
 Interference is deﬁ ned as the interaction between two waves. Thomas Young 
in 1802 formulated the interference of light waves in terms of the principle of 
superposition: If two light waves arrive simultaneously at the same place, their 
effect is identical to that of the third wave, whose amplitude is the algebraic 
sum of the individual amplitudes of the component waves. An example of 
interference as a result of light from a source passing through a double slit is 
illustrated in Figure  1.15 , where light waves passing through two different slits 
interfere with each other. The interference can be constructive, in which case 
the resultant wave has a larger amplitude, that is, the individual amplitudes 
are added to each other; or destructive, in which case the resultant wave has 
a smaller amplitude than the original wave, that is, the individual amplitudes 
are subtracted from each other. This constructive and destructive interference 
creates a pattern on the screen with high - intensity spots corresponding to 
constructive interference and very low intensity (dark) spots corresponding to 
destructive interference.

 In order to avoid confusion, it is important to understand the relationship 
among diffraction, scattering, and interference. Diffraction is bending of a wave 
around small obstacles or the spreading out of waves through small openings. 
Consider an obstacle providing multiple closely spaced openings. A wave 
passing through it will split into components coming from different openings, 
which will interfere with each other through a process called interference or 
superposition. This interference gives rise to a pattern with maxima and minima 
of wave intensity, and is called an interference or diffraction pattern. One may 
also look at the bending of waves as scattering with a particle view in mind. 
 Newton ’ s second law describes the motion of a particle. What describes the 
motion of a wave? 
 1.11  EQUATION OF WAVE MOTION 
 Newton ’ s second law of motion, represented by Eq 1.17, provides the funda-
mental equation of motion for Newtonian mechanics to describe the motion

 In general, this equation describes a wave that has a variable quantity   Ψ , 
called a wave function, which propagates in the  x direction with velocity  v . 
For example, for the wave on a string,   Ψ represents the displacement of 
the string from the  x - axis; for a sound wave,   Ψ represents the pressure 
difference; and for an EM wave,   Ψ is the magnitude of an electric or magnetic 
ﬁ eld. For mechanical waves, Eq.  1.41  can be derived from Newton ’ s second 
law of motion, and for EM waves, it can be derived from Maxwell ’ s 
equations. 
 
 Note :  As demonstrated in  Problem 1.3 , the wave equation  1.41 is obeyed by any 
wave in 1D that is propagated without dispersion or change in shape. It is satisﬁ ed 
by any function of ( x  −  vt ) or of ( x  +  vt ).

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 Just like particle motion, wave motion can be considered as the transportation 
of energy and momentum from one point to another in space, but without the 
transportation of matter. In mechanical waves, such as sound, water, and 
waves on a string, the momentum and energy are transported through a dis-
turbance that is propagated through the medium. Some waves do not need 
any medium to travel through. For example, EM waves transport momentum 
and energy through electric and magnetic ﬁ elds, which propagate through a 
vacuum. 
 In this book, we will be dealing with the EM waves in order to introduce 
quantum physics. So, it is relevant to review some concepts of EM, which is 
also an important part of classical physics. While motion of mass (material 
objects) can be described with Newtonian mechanics, the motion of electric 
charge (also referred to as just charge for brevity) is described by EM. 
 Again, while reviewing the basic concepts of EM, pay attention to how all 
these concepts are based on (or can be derived from) three fundamental con-
cepts: charge instead of mass in Newtonian mechanics, position of charge in 
space, and change of position of charge with time. So the three fundamental 
concepts are again generally the same: entity, space, and time. An example of 
an EM wave visible to us is visible light. 
 1.12  LIGHT: PARTICLE OR WAVE? 
 Light has intrigued human beings for centuries. The struggle to understand the 
nature of light and the centuries - long controversy over it is not only one of 
the most interesting chapters in the history of science, but it also provides 
grounds to develop quantum physics. Early theories considered light as a 
stream of particles that emanated from a source and created a sensation of 
vision by entering the eyes. Newton during his time was the most inﬂ uential 
proponent of the particle (also called corpuscular) theory of light, whereas 
Christian Huygens and Robert Hooks were among the major proponents of 
the wave theory of light. The phenomena of reﬂ ection and refraction of light 
known at the time were easily explained using the particle theory. Although 
Huygens was able to explain reﬂ ection and refraction by using wave theory, 
Newton rejected the wave theory of light based on the lack of evidence for 
diffraction. Even when the evidence for light diffraction became available, 
Newton ’ s followers successfully argued that diffraction was due to the scatter-
ing of light particles from the edges of slits. 
 The wave theory of light made a comeback in 1801 when Thomas Young 
showed that sound waves and light both exhibit interference; showing that it 
is not possible for particles to create interference. Although Young ’ s work 
went largely unnoticed by the scientiﬁ c community for about a decade, 
Augustin Fresnel put wave theory on a ﬁ rm mathematical basis, while per-
forming extensive experiments on diffraction and interference. A big blow to 
Newton ’ s particle theory came in 1850, when Jean Foucault showed by his 

UNDERSTANDING ELECTRICITY  39
measurements that the speed of light in water is less than that in air. In 1860, 
James Clerk Maxwell published his theory of EM, which predicted the speed 
of EM waves to be 3  ×  10 8  m/s. He suggested that this agreement with the 
speed of light was not coincidental, that light was in fact an EM wave. 
 Maxwell ’ s theory was experimentally conﬁ rmed by experiments performed 
by Hertz in 1887, who successfully generated and detected EM waves in the 
laboratory by using electrical means, such as a spark gap in a tuned circuit. 
He used the spark gap to in a tuned circuit to generate the wave and another 
circuit to detect it. The irony of the situation is that in the same year when 
Hertz ’ s experiment conﬁ rmed Maxwell ’ s wave theory, Hertz also discovered 
a phenomenon called the photoelectric effect, which could only be explained 
by Einstein using the particle model of light. However, we are getting ahead 
of ourselves now. These latter two points will be discussed in the forthcoming 
chapters. For now, understand that toward the end of the nineteenth century, 
when some experiments challenged classical physics, light was largely viewed 
as a wave: the EM wave. 
 To understand EM waves, it is important to understand electricity. 
 1.13  UNDERSTANDING ELECTRICITY 
 Electricity is the property of matter related to electric charge. Historically, the 
word electricity has been used by several scientists to mean electric charge. 
This property (electricity) is responsible for several natural phenomena, such 
as lightning, and is used in numerous industrial applications, such as electric 
power and the whole ﬁ eld of electronics. To understand electricity, you must 
understand the related concepts discussed in the following: 
 Electric Charge.   Electric charge, also referred to as just charge, is a basic 
property of some particles of matter. There are two types of charge: posi-
tive and negative. For example, an electron has a negative charge and a 
proton has a positive charge, equal in magnitude to that of the electron. 
The charge of an electron (or proton) is used as a natural unit of charge. 
The standard symbol used to represent charge is  q or  Q . Two particles 
(or objects) with the same type of charge repel each other and two 
objects with the opposite types of charge attract each other. The charge 
is measured in units of the coulomb, denoted by C. 
 Charge is conserved: the algebraic sum of all the electric charges in a 
closed system is a constant. Note, it does not mean that charge cannot 
ﬂ ow. Nor does it mean that charges cannot be created or destroyed. For 
example, consider a system of one particle called a photon, which can 
decay into a pair of electrons with a negative charge and a positron with 
a positive charge. Nevertheless, the algebraic sum of charges is still zero 
as before. Also, the electrically neutral objects are not neutral because 
they have no charge, but because they have an equal number of positive 

40  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
and negative charges. For example, all matter is made up of atoms 
and all atoms in their natural form contain an equal number of 
protons (positively charged particles) and electrons (negatively charged 
particles). 
 Electric Potential – Voltage.   The electric potential difference  V ab between 
two points  a and b is the work required to move one unit,  C , called a 
coulomb, of charge from one point  a to the other point  b in space. This 
is commonly called an electric potential or voltage because it is measured 
in units of the volt, denoted by V. 
 Capacitance.  Capacitance is the amount of charge stored in a system, called 
a capacitor, per unit of electric potential. In other words, the capacitance, 
 C , is deﬁ ned by the following equation:
 
 C
Q
V
=
 
 (1.44) 
 A capacitor is a device that stores charge and the resulting electric 
potential energy. Therefore, capacitance may also be looked upon as a 
measure of the ability of a device to store energy. For example, consider 
a parallel plate conductor shown in Figure  1.16 , which contains two 
parallel plates as conductors. Assume that initially each conductor has a 
zero charge and therefore has a zero net charge. Now assume that elec-
trons are transferred from conductor  a to conductor  b , so that conductor 
 b acquires a  − Q charge and conductor  a acquires a  + Q charge. The total

work performed for this transfer is stored as the potential energy in the 
capacitor. The voltage (potential difference) between the plates can be 
written as:
 
 V
Ed
ab =
 
 (1.45) 
where  E is the electric ﬁ eld between the two plates (conductors), and  d 
is the distance between the plates. Therefore, from Eqs.  1.44 and  1.45 , 
the capacitance of the capacitor can be written as:
 
 C
Q
V
Q
Ed

 (1.46) 
 This example of a capacitor is the so - called parallel plates capacitor: 
Two metallic plates separated from each other and each plate carrying 
equal and opposite charge,  Q , with a potential difference between 
them,  V . Capacitance is measured in units of the farad, denoted by  F . 
For example, if the charge on each plate of a parallel plate capacitor is 
1 C, and the voltage between them is 1 V, the capacitance of the capacitor 
will be 1 F. 
 Electric Current.   Electric current is the rate of ﬂ ow of an electric charge 
per unit time, and can be deﬁ ned by the following equation:
 
 I
Q
t
=
 
 (1.47) 
 In this equation,  I is the current and  Q is the amount of charge that 
ﬂ owed past a point in time  t . More generally, it can be represented in 
terms of the rate of the charge change with time:
 
 I
dQ
dt
=
 
 (1.48) 
 Current is measured in ampere units, (A). For example, one C of charge 
ﬂ owing past a point in 1 s represents 1 A of current. The materials, such 
as metals, that permit relatively free ﬂ ow of charge are called conductors, 
whereas the materials, such as glass, that do not allow free ﬂ ow of charge 
are called insulators. 
 Resistance.   Resistance is a measure of opposition offered by a material to 
the ﬂ ow of charge through it. The resistance can be measured by Eq.  1.49 .
 
 I
V
R
=
 
 (1.49) 

42  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 This means that the larger the resistance, the smaller the current. 
Resistance is measured in units of the ohm ( Ω ). For example, if the 
voltage of 1 V creates 1 A of current in a conductor, the resistance of the 
conductor is 1  Ω . 
 Electric Energy.   The amount of work that can be done by an amount 
of electric charge across a potential difference is the electric energy. 
For example, the energy,  E , of a charge  Q across a voltage  V is given by 
Eq.  1.50 .
 
 E
QV

 (1.50) 
 Electric Power.  The rate of work performed by an electric current is the 
electric power. In other words, it is the electric energy produced or con-
sumed per unit time, and is given by Eq.  1.51 .

 Electric Field.   The electric ﬁ eld is a ﬁ eld used by the charges at a distance 
to exert a force on each other. In other words, the charges at a distance 
interact with each other through their ﬁ elds, called electric ﬁ elds. Here 
is how it works. A particle as a result of its charge modiﬁ es the properties 
of the space around it. Any other charged particle, due to the charge it 
carries, experience that modiﬁ cation in terms of an electric force. As 
explained earlier, the ﬁ elds are usually represented by ﬁ eld lines, as 
illustrated in Figure  1.17 for two charged particles interacting with each 
other through their electric ﬁ elds.

by other charged particles.

where  k is called the Coulomb constant with a value of 8.988  ×  10 9  N.m 2 /
C 2 , and  ˆr is the unit vector along the line from the particle (considered 
to be at the origin) to the point where the electric ﬁ eld is being consid-
ered. The unit vector  ˆr is obviously the direction of the electric ﬁ eld and, 
as shown in Figure  1.17 , it is always tangent to the ﬁ eld lines. The number 
of ﬁ eld lines passing through an area represent the strength (magnitude) 
of the ﬁ eld in that area. A quantity related to the number of electric ﬁ eld 
lines passing through an area is called an electric ﬂ ux, denoted as   Φ E . 
Now, recall that an electric ﬁ eld at a point is a tangent to the ﬁ eld line 
(or curve) at that point. From differential calculus, you immediately 
know that the magnitude of the electric ﬁ eld will be given by the slope 
of the tangent line to the ﬂ ux (as a function of area), that is,  ∂ Φ E / ∂ A :

 Equation  1.55 is the mathematical representation of Gauss ’ s law,

to the total charge inside the surface divided by  ε 0 , a constant called the 
free permittivity of space. 
 Two charges of the same type exert a repulsive force on each other, 
and two charges of opposite types exert an attractive force on each

other. This force is called an electric force. A charge in motion creates 
another kind of force called a magnetic force applied through a magnetic 
ﬁ eld. 
 1.14  UNDERSTANDING MAGNETISM 
 Magnetism is the property of a material that enables two objects to exert a 
speciﬁ c kind of force on each other called a magnetic force, which is created 
by an electric charge in motion. To understand magnetism, you must under-
stand the related concepts discussed in this section. 
 1.14.1  Magnetic Field 
 A magnetic ﬁ eld is a ﬁ eld produced by a moving charge that it used to exert 
a magnetic force on another moving charge. A magnetic ﬁ eld is also produced 
by some magnetic materials, such as permanent magnets. It turns out that a 
magnetic ﬁ eld in such materials is also produced due to moving charges, the 
circulating current on the atomic scale. So, in both cases a magnetic ﬁ eld is 
generated by circulating currents: In conventional electric circuits, the current 
circulates at the macroscale (the scale of the circuit), whereas in magnetic 
materials the current circulates at the atomic scale. 
 
 What is common among a doorbell, an electric motor, an electromagnet, 
and a transformer? All contain coils of wires with a large number of turns 
spaced closely enough so that each turn closely approximates a planar circular 
loop of current. Each loop of current  I generates a magnetic ﬁ eld  B according 
to a rule called the right - hand rule, as illustrated in Figure  1.18 . Imagine the 
ﬁ st made with your right hand with the thumb sticking straight up. If the ﬁ ngers 
curl in the direction of  

I , the thumb points in the direction of  

B. 
 To reverse this situation, now consider a long straight current carrying 
conductor. The magnitude of the magnetic ﬁ eld at a distance  r from this wire 
carrying current  I is deﬁ ned as:

 Note :  A moving charge (i.e., current) creates a magnetic ﬁ eld in the space around 
it. Note that a moving charge is still a charge; so it will generate an electric ﬁ eld as 
well.

 As you can see, the end result is independent of the radius of the circle 
(the closed path); the equation is true for any closed path that encloses a 
steady current  I . This equation is the mathematical form of Ampere ’ s law, 
which states that the line integral of a magnetic ﬁ eld along any closed 
path is equal to   μ 0 times the net current  I that crosses the area bounded by 
the path. 
 Just like an electric ﬁ eld, a magnetic ﬁ eld is also represented by ﬁ eld 
lines, the magnetic ﬁ eld lines, which give rise to the concept of a magnetic 
ﬂ ux. 
 1.14.2  Magnetic Flux 
 Analogous to the electric ﬂ ux described earlier, a magnetic ﬂ ux is a measure 
of the quantity of the magnetic ﬁ eld lines through a certain area. It is propor-
tional to the strength of the magnetic ﬁ eld and the surface area under consid-
eration. For example, the current running through a wire in a circuit will create 
the magnetic ﬁ eld, and hence the magnetic ﬂ ux in the area around it. Flux is 
a general property of any ﬁ eld, and is not limited to only magnetic and electric 
ﬁ elds. 
 In a somewhat analogous way to an electric ﬂ ux, we can explore the 
mathematical representation of a magnetic ﬂ ux. The magnitude of a magnetic 
ﬁ eld at a point is equal to the magnetic ﬂ ux per unit area across the area 
perpendicular to the ﬁ eld. This means that the relationship between the 
magnetic ﬂ ux and the magnetic ﬁ eld

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 Equation  1.60 is the mathematical form of Gauss ’ s law for magnetism. This 
integral is zero because any ﬂ ux (ﬁ eld) line that enters a closed area exits that 
area too. So the net ﬂ ux through the surface is zero, because unlike an electric 
charges, there is no such thing as isolated magnetic charges. Theoretically they 
are called magnetic monopoles. In other words, unlike electric ﬁ eld lines that 
begin and end on electric charges, magnetic ﬁ eld lines never have end points, 
they always form closed loops. 
 Faraday ’ s law for a magnetic ﬂ ux states that the change in magnetic ﬂ ux 
creates an electromotive force (emf), which is practically a voltage. In other 
words, the changing magnetic ﬂ ux through a circuit will induce a current in 
the circuit. Recall that the magnetic ﬂ ux can be created by the current in a 
circuit according to Amperes law. Faraday ’ s law says the reverse: The change 
in magnetic ﬂ ux can create a current.

 As mentioned earlier the change in this ﬂ ux induces an emf  ε : 
 This is Faraday ’ s law of induction, which states that the induced emf in a

through the loop. The induced emf is actually the electric force represented

 To sum up, consider two electric circuits next to each other. There will 
be a magnetic ﬂ ux through the second circuit due to the current in the 
ﬁ rst circuit: Ampere ’ s law. If you change the current in the ﬁ rst circuit, 
it will change the magnetic ﬂ ux through the second circuit, and the change 
in magnetic ﬂ ux will create the current through the second circuit accord-
ing to Faraday ’ s law. So, you see that electricity and magnetism are related 
to each other and can be looked upon as two facets of what is called 
electromagnetism. 

UNDERSTANDING ELECTROMAGNETISM  49
 1.15  UNDERSTANDING ELECTROMAGNETISM 
 Electromagnetism is the uniﬁ ed framework to understand electricity, magne-
tism, and the relationship between them. In other words, to understand the 
electric ﬁ eld, magnetic ﬁ eld, and the relationship between them. To see this 
relationship, ﬁ rst recall that a charge creates an electric ﬁ eld, and the same 
charge, when it starts moving, creates a magnetic ﬁ eld. The electric ﬁ eld exerts 
an electric force, whereas a magnetic ﬁ eld exerts a magnetic force: Both origi-
nate from the electric charge. Therefore, they are intimately related: A chang-
ing electric ﬁ eld produces a magnetic ﬁ eld and a changing magnetic ﬁ eld 
produces an electric ﬁ eld. Due to this intimacy, the electric and magnetic force 
are considered two different manifestations of the same uniﬁ ed force called 
an EM force. The uniﬁ ed form of an electric and magnetic ﬁ eld is called an 
EM ﬁ eld, and an electric and magnetic ﬁ eld are considered its components. In 
other words, an EM force is exerted by an EM ﬁ eld. 
 Where there is a force, there is energy. The energy corresponding to an EM 
force is called EM energy or radiation. This energy is transferred from one 
point in space to another through what are called EM waves. 
 So, what is the frequency of EM waves? Electromagnetic waves cover a 
wide spectrum of frequencies, and the ranges of these frequencies are one way 
to deﬁ ne different types of EM waves. 
 1.15.1  Types of Electromagnetic and Other Waves 
 Waves can be grouped according to the direction of disturbance in them 
and according to the range of their frequency. Recall that a wave transfers 
energy from one point to another in space. That means there are two 
things going on: The disturbance that deﬁ nes a wave, and the propagation 
of a wave. In this context, the waves are grouped into the following two 
categories: 
 Longitudinal Waves.   A wave is called a longitudinal wave when the 
disturbances in the wave are parallel to the direction of propagation of 
the wave. For example, sound waves are longitudinal waves because 
the change of pressure occurs parallel to the direction of wave 
propagation. 
 Transverse Waves.   A wave is called a transverse wave when the distur-
bances in the wave are perpendicular (at right angles) to the direction 
of propagation of the wave. 
 Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves, which means that the 
electric and magnetic ﬁ elds change (oscillate) in a plane that is per-
pendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. Also, note 
that the electric and magnetic ﬁ eld in an EM wave are perpendicular to 
each other. 
 

50  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 1.4 
 Are the waves shown in Figures  1.9 and  1.10 longitudinal or transverse waves? 
 Solution: 
 Transverse waves. 
 Because electric and magnetic ﬁ elds change in a plane that is perpen-
dicular to the direction of wave propagation, the direction of change still 
has some freedom. Different ways of using this freedom provide another 
criterion for classifying EM waves into the following: 
 Linearly Polarized Waves.    If the electric ﬁ eld (and hence the magnetic 
ﬁ eld) changes in such a way that its direction remains parallel to a 
line in space as the wave travels, the wave is said to be linearly 
polarized. 
 Circularly Polarized Waves.   If the change in the electric ﬁ eld occurs in a 
circle or in an ellipse, the wave is said to be circularly or elliptically 
polarized. Therefore the polarization of a transverse wave determines 
the direction of disturbance (oscillation) in a plane perpendicular to the 
direction of wave propagation. 
 
 Caution :   Only transverse waves can be polarized, because in a longitudinal wave 
the disturbance is always parallel to the direction of wave propagation. 
 So, you can classify EM waves based on the direction of disturbance in them 
(polarization). The other criterion to classify EM waves is the frequency. This 
classiﬁ cation gives rise to what is called the EM spectrum. 
 1.15.2  Electromagnetic Spectrum 
 Have you ever seen EM waves with your naked eye? The answer, of course, 
is yes! Visible light is an example of EM waves. In addition to visible light, 
EM waves include radio waves, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and X - rays; which, 
of course, are not visible to the naked eye. These different kinds of EM waves 
 Note :  Electric and magnetic ﬁ elds ( E and  B ) in an EM wave are perpendicular to 
each other and are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave.

 PROBLEM 1.5 
 Consider two EM waves represented by A and B: 
 
 A.  Which wave has the higher wavelength? 
 B.  Which wave has the higher frequency? 
 C.  If one of these waves represents visible light and the other one UV radiation, 
which wave is which?  
 Solution: 
 A.  Wave B has longer or higher wavelength. 
 B.  Wave A has higher frequency because it has smaller wavelength. 
 C.  Wave B represents visible light and wave A represents UV radiation, because 
UV radiation has a higher frequency than that of a wave of visible light. 
only differ in their frequency, and therefore the wavelength. The whole fre-
quency range of EM waves is called the EM spectrum, which is shown in 
Figure  1.20 and Table  1.1 along with the names associated with different fre-
quency ranges or regions within the spectrum. The human eye has evolved to 
detect visible light that happens to be in the range where the Sun puts out 
most of its light energy that hits Earth.

thought to be two different forces, the physical quantity charge was organized 
into two different units in electrostatic phenomena and in magnetic phenom-
ena resulting in two different physical dimensions. To their surprise, physicists 
noticed that the ratio of these two different units had the unit of velocity and 
its value was measured to be precisely equal to the velocity of light. At that 
time, physicists had no idea how to explain this and took it as a remarkable 
coincidence. As often happens in science, the questions put to bed by one

generation of scientists are often confronted sooner or later by a future gen-
eration, if not the same. 
 When the electric and the magnetic ﬁ elds do not vary with time, we can 
analyze them independent of each other. However, when they do vary with 
time, they are interrelated. For example, Faraday ’ s law states that a magnetic 
ﬁ eld varying with time generates an electric ﬁ eld, for example, as demon-
strated by induced emfs in inductors and transformers. In the reverse, 
Ampere ’ s law states that an electric ﬁ eld varying with time generates a mag-
netic ﬁ eld. James Clerk Maxwell (1831 – 1879) realized the disturbance 
element in the fact that the variation in either an electric or magnetic ﬁ eld 
in time induces the other in the adjacent regions of space. So, he considered 
the possibility of an EM disturbance caused by time varying electric and 
magnetic ﬁ elds propagating through space as a wave. The mystery of the 
ratio of electric and magnetic charges being equal to the speed of light was 
solved in 1865, when Maxwell showed that an EM disturbance (wave) would 
propagate in space with the speed of light, and hence light was a wave and 
was electromagnetic in nature. Furthermore, Maxwell realized that the basic 
principles of electromagnetism can be expressed in terms of four equations, 
which display the mutual interaction between electric and magnetic ﬁ elds 
discussed above. 
 Although Maxwell developed the concept of displacement current, he 
did not discover Maxwell ’ s equations single handedly. His genius was to 
put them together and recognize their importance especially in terms of 
EM waves. Maxwell ’ s equations are presented in Table  1.2 in both dif-
ferential and integrals forms, where   ρ is the electric charge density,  J is 
the electric current density,  Q is the charge enclosed within the surface, 
 I c is the conducting current,   Φ E is the electric ﬂ ux, and  Φ B is the magnetic 
ﬂ ux. Furthermore,  

E is the electric ﬁ eld,

B is the magnetic ﬁ eld, and  ε 0 
and   μ 0  are called vacuum electric and vacuum magnetic permeability, 
respectively.

 To start from the top in Table  1.2 , the integral forms of the ﬁ rst two Maxwell 
equations involve the integrals of electric and magnetic ﬁ elds over a closed 
surface. The ﬁ rst equation represents Gauss ’ s law for electric ﬁ elds, which 
states that he surface integral of an electric ﬁ eld  E  ⊥  over any closed surface is 
equal to the charge enclosed by the surface divided by  ε 0 . Analogously, Gauss ’ s 
law for magnetic ﬁ elds expressed in the second equation states that the surface 
integral of the magnetic ﬁ eld  B  ⊥  over a closed surface is always zero. The third 
Maxwell ’ s equation in the table expresses Faraday ’ s law of EM induction, 
which shows how a time varying magnetic ﬁ eld generates circulating electric 
ﬁ eld. Finally, the fourth Maxwell equation expresses Amperes law by showing 
how an electric current can generate a magnetic ﬁ eld. The second term on the 
right - hand side of the equation was added by Maxwell, in analogy with the 
Faraday ’ s law, to account for the fact that a time varying electric ﬁ eld also 
generates a circulating magnetic ﬁ eld. 
 In the absence of charges and currents, Maxwell ’ s equations can be trans-
formed into the following 3D wave equations:

CONFINEMENT, STANDING WAVES, AND WAVEGROUPS  55
 This turns out to be the speed of light. As a matter of fact, solutions to these 
differential equations represent transverse electric and magnetic waves travel-
ing with the speed of light. 
 To ease your way into quantum mechanics, you need to be comfortable with 
a few more concepts related to waves, namely, conﬁ nement, standing waves, 
and wavegroups. 
 1.17  CONFINEMENT, STANDING WAVES, AND WAVEGROUPS 
 This chapter established that most of the physics is based on three fundamen-
tal concepts: physical entity, space, and time. Time represents the interval over 
which there is a change, such as motion of the physical entity. As you know, 
Newton ’ s ﬁ rst law states that an object (or a particle) that is moving with a 
velocity  v , will continue moving with this velocity until an external force is 
applied to it. The world and the universe is full of external forces. Under the 
inﬂ uence of these forces, the motion of objects is restricted or constrained in 
a certain fashion. For example, the motion of earth around the Sun is con-
strained in an orbit. The motion of a pendulum is constrained as well. Such 
constraints are called conﬁ nement. 
 1.17.1  Conﬁ nement 
 Both particles and waves travel, that is, move in time. Conﬁ nement refers to 
the situation in which the motion of a particle or a wave is constrained (con-
ﬁ ned) to a certain region in space. The conﬁ nement on motion of a physical 
entity understandably results in constraints on the values of some observables 
of the entity, such as energy and momentum. For example, imagine a particle 
conﬁ ned to a box: Its position is always contrained to be within the range of 
values that represent the dimension of the box. 
 It is important for you to understand standing waves, an example of conﬁ ne-
ment, because it is a good ice breaker into quantum mechanics. 
 1.17.2  Standing Waves 
 A standing wave is a wave that remains in a constant position. For that reason, 
it is also called a stationary wave. The ﬁ rst time I learned about standing waves 
 Note :  The permittivity of vacuum  ε 0 is also called the electric constant and perme-
ability of vacuum   μ 0 is also called the magnetic constant. The relationship between 
the speed of light, the electric constant, and the magnetic constant are given by

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
was in terms of a string ﬁ rmly attached to rigid walls on two ends, I wondered 
how I was going to use that knowledge. So, I stoked it in the backburner of 
my brain. However, I found its usefulness during my student life some time 
later when I started learning quantum mechanics. Furthermore, standing 
waves have several applications in about all ﬁ elds of science and technology, 
and, of course, in music. 
 So, if you already have some knowledge of standing waves, recall it. 
Nevertheless, I will give you a brief refresher in this section. A standing wave 
will help you a great deal in understanding the Schr ö dinger equation, the 
deﬁ ning heart of quantum mechanics, which you will deal with in this book. 
A standing wave is a wave that results from the interference of several waves 
conﬁ ned in space. Waves on a piano string and in an organ pipe are examples 
of the situations, which corresponding to certain wave frequencies, can give 
rise to a stationary wave pattern called standing waves. 
 We will explore the concept of standing waves by considering a simple 
situation: A string tied to a tuning fork at one end  A , and ﬁ xed at the other 
end  B . Assume that the length of the string, stretched from  A to  B , is  L . 
Further assume that the tuning fork is vibrating with frequency  f , wavelength 
 λ , and a small amplitude. Now, consider a wave traveling from end  A (the 
fork) to end  B . At end  B , the wave is reﬂ ected back in an inverted form. 
After traveling a distance of 2 L , it is reﬂ ected back in an inverted form again 
from end  A at the fork. Because it has been inverted twice, it will only differ 
in phase from the wave that the fork generates at this moment. However, if 
the wavelength is exactly equal to the length of the string, the wave that is 
reﬂ ected twice is now in phase with the wave created by the fork at the 
moment of second reﬂ ection. Therefore, the two waves interfere construc-
tively. The amplitude of the wave resulting from interference is twice that of 
any of the two interfering waves. Following the same argument, you can envi-
sion another event of constructive interference after traveling a distance of 
the next 2 L , and so on. This way, the amplitude of the wave at the string 
continues to grow until it reaches a maximum value at which the energy 
provided by the fork to the string equals the energy lost to damping effects, 
such as imperfect ﬂ exibility of the string and the reﬂ ection phenomenon. At 
this point, the wave on the string has a constant position and energy and is 
called the standing wave. 
 
 Note :  Because the tuning form is vibrating with a small amplitude, the end  A can 
be considered a ﬁ xed point for the purpose of reﬂ ection and interference. 
 When the wavelength  λ of the wave generated by the tuning fork and 
transported to the string is equal to the length of the string  L , the tuning fork 
is called in resonance with the string and the frequency of the fork (and the 
wave) is called the resonance frequency. Note that the constructive interfer-

CONFINEMENT, STANDING WAVES, AND WAVEGROUPS  57
ence will happen if 2 L is any integer times   λ . In other words, the resonance 
frequency may have any of the values that result in the following values for 
the wavelength:
 
 2L
n
n
= λ  
 (1.70) 
 Therefore,
 
 λn

assume the following values:
 
 f
v
n v

n =

 (1.72) 
where  f 1 is called the fundamental frequency. The different frequencies 
corresponding to the different  n values are called harmonics. Therefore, 
a harmonic of a wave is a component frequency of the wave that is an 
integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. 
 The amplitude of a standing wave, like any other wave, is the amplitude 
of the maximum vertical displacement of the wave, and the displacement 
is represented by its wave function   Ψ . Let us derive this wave function 
from the wave functions of the individual waves that the standing wave 
is composed of. The displacement of the wave traveling from  A to  B , is 
given by

where  v is the phase velocity and, also in this case, is the group velocity because 
we are assuming that the string is a perfectly ﬂ exible string. 
 In general, a single wave made of several different waves is called a wave-
packet or a wavegroup. The phase velocity is the velocity of the individual 
component waves and the group velocity is the velocity of the wavepacket. 
Note that the two are not the same. 
 1.17.3  Wavegroups 
 When waves of slightly different frequencies interfere with each other, they 
form a pattern of wavegroups or wavepackets due to the superposition of the 
individual waves. Because the individual waves have different frequencies, 
they will be traveling with different speeds, but the group as a whole will be 
traveling with a speed called a group velocity. Figure  1.22 illustrates a simple 
example of the superposition of two waves  A and  B with frequencies  f 1 and  f 2 
generating a third wave with frequency  f that consists of wavegroups. 
 Assume that the two individual waves  A and  B have the same amplitude 
 Ψ 0 , have wave numbers  k 1 and  k 2 , and angular frequencies   ω 1 and  ω 2 . From 
Eq.  1.73 , we can write the wave functions for these two waves:

 Use Eq.  1.86 to realize the relationship between   Δ k and   Δ x , where   Δ x is the 
width of the packet along the  x - axis, which must be at least one - half of 
the wavelength. This means that the end points of the wavepacket (where 
the amplitude is zero), say  x 1 and  x 2 , must have a phase difference of   π . 
Mathematically, this means that the difference in the terms   Δ k x /2 in Eq.  1.86 
at points  x 1 and  x 2 must be equal to   π . This means

 For simplicity, we have only considered the wavegroup as a superposition of 
two waves. In general, a wavepacket can be thought of as a superposition of 
many waves with angular frequencies and wavenumbers distributed over 
limited ranges. As illustrated in Figure  1.23 , superposition of several waves of 
different frequencies will give rise to a more localized interference pattern, 
the wavegroup.

 As illustrated in Figure  1.23 , a wavegroup is more localized, that is, the spread over 
space is less. How about the wavenumber? 
 Solution: 
 Wave number is given by
 k = 2π
λ  
 Because there are many wavelengths composing the wavegroup, therefore the 
wavenumber is more spread out. 
 So, in classical physics, a physical entity could be either a particle or a wave. 
We have reviewed important characteristics and the behavior of particles and 
waves. Now let us compare particles and waves in the context of these char-
acteristics in order to distinguish particles from waves. 
 1.18  PARTICLES AND WAVES: THE BIG PICTURE 
 As mentioned earlier, classical physics treats particles and waves as two sepa-
rate kinds of entities. We have discussed some of the characteristics that 

THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE  63
particles and waves have and some of the phenomena that they exhibit. Table 
 1.3 compares particles and waves in terms of phenomena they exhibit. 
 Classical physics is based on our perception of physical reality with our ﬁ ve 
senses. Particles are particles because they carry mass and they collide with 
each other as solid objects. Waves are waves because they have frequency, 
wavelength, and they go under phenomena, such as interference and 
diffraction. 
 Recall again the three fundamental concepts on which the physics is based: 
physical entity, space that speciﬁ es the position of the entity, and time that is 
used to specify the change in position of the entity. According to Newton ’ s 
law, the change in the position of rest or in the state of uniform motion occurs 
due to external forces. There are countless forces all around and within us. 
However, all of those forces are different manifestations of the four funda-
mental forces of nature. Both kinds of entities, particles and waves, are subject 
to one or more of these interactions. 
 1.19  THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE 
 Physicists study matter from elementary particles to galaxies and the universe, 
and all the fundamental forces that keep the universe and the systems in the 
universe in order. Although the fundamental forces acting on material systems

are universal, the size of the material systems does matter in many ways in 
determining which force is signiﬁ cant for a given situation. For example, we 
as humans are macrobeings, and therefore we started our studies from the 
macroworld by using macrotools starting with our ﬁ ve senses. However, we 
are incapable of seeing the microworld with our naked eyes. Table  1.4 presents 
some examples of material systems on the size scale of macro to micro includ-
ing nano and beyond nano. 
 Throughout the history of physics, physicists have discovered the 
following: 
  •   All matter is composed of two kinds of a very few elementary particles 
called quarks and leptons: there are six types of quarks and six types of 
leptons. For example, a proton is made up of three quarks, as is a neutron. 
An electron is an example of a lepton. All atoms are made of protons, 
neutrons, and electrons. 

THE FOUR FUNDAMENTAL FORCES OF NATURE  65
  •   Elementary particles are bound together to make atoms, molecules, and 
bulk matter through the presence of four fundamental forces: Strong and 
weak nuclear forces to form the nuclei of atoms, EM force to form atoms 
and molecules, and gravity to hold together large systems like planets, 
stars, and galaxies. These forces are expressed through particles, for 
example, EM force is expressed by an elementary particle called a photon. 
In other words, two charged particles interacting with each other via an 
EM force means they are exchanging photons. Photons are the mediators 
of EM force. 
  •   These fundamental forces also govern the behavior and properties of 
particles and waves and of the bulk material. For example, chemistry 
students know that the stronger the intermolecular forces, which are some 
sort of EM forces, the higher is the melting and the boiling point of a 
substance.

intermolecular forces. 
 B.  Intermolecular forces belong to which fundamental force? 
 Solution: 
 A.  London dispersion forces, dipole – dipole - forces, and hydrogen bonding. 
 B.  Electromagnetic force 
 Note :  When we say EM force is expressed through photons, we mean that the two 
particles, for example, an electron and a proton, experience an EM force between 
them by exchanging photons. In other words, these two particles interact with each 
other and photons are the means of interaction; they intermediate the interaction. 
For this reason, an EM force and any other of the four forces are also called 
interactions. 
 In a nutshell, fundamental forces help form the material systems from basic 
building blocks, keep these systems intact, and hold this planet and the uni-
verse together in some order. There are four fundamental forces (gravita-
tional, electromagnetic, weak and strong forces) that govern our universe. 
These forces are discussed next in Sections 1.19.1 – 1.19.4. 
 1.19.1  Gravitational Force 
 Also called gravity, this is the force of attraction between any two material 
bodies with nonzero mass. According to gravitational law, ﬁ rst formulated by 

66  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
Newton in 1687, every material body attracts every other material body in this 
universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses 
of the two bodies and inversely proportional to the square of the distance 
between them. It is the gravitational force that keeps us on Earth and not 
ﬂ oating randomly in space. Also, it is the gravitational force that keeps Earth 
revolving around the Sun. Gravity is the weakest of the fundamental forces. 
 The gravitational force in classical mechanics is given by Newton ’ s law of 
gravitation, which states that two particles experience an attractive force  F g , 
that is directly proportional to the product of their masses  m 1 and  m 2 , and 
inversely proportional to the square of the distance  r between them:
 
 F
G m m
r
g =
1
2

 (1.89) 
where  G  is the proportionality constant and is known as a gravitational con-
stant. So, the gravitational ﬁ eld exerts a gravitational force on any particle 
with mass. You can see that mass is the origin of a gravitational force. 
 1.19.2  Electromagnetic Force 
 This is the force that an EM ﬁ eld exerts on any particle with an electric charge: 
Charge is the origin of an EM force. Electromagnetic force manifests itself 
through an electric and a magnetic force. The magnitude of an electric force 
between any two charged particles is given by Coulomb ’ s law, which states 
that two charged particles experience a force  F e that is directly proportional 
to the product of their charges  q 1 and  q 2 , and inversely proportional to the 
square of the distance  r between them:
 
 F
k q q
r
e =

 (1.90) 
where  k is the proportionality constant and is known as the Coulomb constant. 
Notice the striking similarity between equations representing an electric and 
a gravitational force. However, note that gravitational force is only an attrac-
tive force because there are no negative mass particles, whereas an electric 
force is attractive between unlike charges and repulsive between like charges, 
because particles can have positive or negative charge. We can present 
Coulomb ’ s law in terms of an electric ﬁ eld. The particles with charges  q 1 and 
 q 2 exert an electric force on each other through their electric ﬁ elds. The electric 
ﬁ eld

 Electromagnetic force is responsible for holding the electrons and protons 
together in an atom and also for binding atoms into molecules. This force plays 
an important role in all forms of chemical phenomenon, such as chemical 
reactions. Most of the forces we experience in our daily lives other than gravi-
tational force during our interaction with ordinary objects, such as pushing, 
pulling, scrubbing, have their origin in an EM force at the molecular level, 
that is, the molecules in our body interact with the molecules of the body we 
interact with by using an EM force. Light is also associated with the EM force. 
Therefore, the macroscopic world is largely run by gravitational and EM 
forces. 
 1.19.3  Weak and Strong Nuclear Forces 
 There are two kinds of nuclear forces: 
 Weak Nuclear Force.   This nuclear force is responsible for radioactive decay. 
It is 10 13 times weaker than the strong nuclear force. 
 Strong Nuclear Force.   This force keeps the subatomic particles intact. For 
example, it is responsible for keeping three quarks bound together to 
form a proton. 

68  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 1.19.4  Four Fundamental Forces: The Big Picture 
 These four fundamental forces are also called interactions because particles 
and other systems of matter use these forces to interact with each other. 
Physicists use the terms force and interaction interchangeably. This universe 
starting from subatomic particles to galaxies is held together by these interac-
tions. In other words, our universe is an expression of the greatest underlying 
orchestra being played by fundamental particles and the interactions among 
them. The basic characteristics of these forces, such as relative strength, and 
the most effective range in the context of the real world are presented in 
Table  1.5 . 
 The strength of the electric force between two particles is inversely propor-
tional to the square of the distance between them, that is, it decreases as the 
particles are separated from each other. Because theoretically the force 
between two charged particles never drops all the way to zero, you can say 
that the range of the EM force is inﬁ nite. However, practically speaking, the 
effective range of an EM force in matter only goes to  ∼ 5  ×  10  − 10  m, that is, 
0.5  nm. This is because of the cancellation effects of positive and negative 
charges in the matter, whereas the range of gravity stays inﬁ nite because it is

only an attractive force. Furthermore, it is the force that keeps protons and 
electrons bound together to form atoms, and atoms bound together to form 
molecules, crystals, and other materials, such as metals. Therefore, it is of 
speciﬁ c interest to different ﬁ elds in nanotechnology. Because quantum 
physics is needed to understand phenomena in the micro (and nano) - scale and 
the most effective force in this scale is the EM, force, we will be dealing with 
this force in this book. 
 
 Note :  Out of the four fundamental interactions in the universe, the interaction that 
is relevant to ﬁ elds discussed in this book (biology, chemistry, nanotechnology, and 
computer science) is the EM interaction, which exhibits itself in our world in many 
forms including electricity and magnetism. In chemistry classes, the EM force 
appears (or expresses itself) under different forms and names, such as electrostatic 
force, van der Wall ’ s force, London dispersion force, hydrogen bonding, atomic 
bonding, and so on. You know from your introductory physics course that the EM 
force is also the force that leads to friction, lets your car move smoothly, and let 
you walk on earth and pick up things and hug your friends. 
 Although physics has made advances in exploring all of these four interac-
tions, other sciences has mostly made use of EM forces. Physicists have learned 
repeatedly that the four fundamental forces appear to be a manifestation of 
a single uniﬁ ed force. As a matter of fact, the whole history of physics can be 
looked upon in terms of exploring uniﬁ cation. 
 1.20  UNIFICATION: A SECRET TO SCIENTIFIC AND 
TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTIONS 
 The whole history of the development of science can be explained in terms of 
one concept called uniﬁ cation. Most of the breakthroughs in science and 
technology have to do something with some kind of uniﬁ cation at some level. 
So, what is uniﬁ cation? Broadly speaking, uniﬁ cation is the process or act of 
uniting two or more apparently different things into one. 
 Nature works the way it does. We, the human, have our limitations in 
understanding it. We develop our understanding, gather information, and 
obtain knowledge in pieces. Some pieces may look different from each other 
at the surface. However, they may be the different facets of the same thing at 
some other level. For example, nature did not create different disciplines of 
science, such as physics, chemistry, biology, and so on. These and the borders 
among them are our own creations representing our limitations. To see the 
underlying unity behind diversity has been the key to major breakthroughs in 
science. The history of Physics, the mother of all sciences, demonstrates this 
very well. According to physics, our universe is shaped and governed by four 
fundamental forces: gravitational, electromagnetic, weak nuclear, and strong 
nuclear forces. 

70  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 Here are some examples of uniﬁ cation in Physics. The realization that it is 
the same force that keeps us on Earth and makes the Earth rotate around the 
Sun enabled the physicist to recognize one of the four fundamental forces of 
nature: the gravitational force. From this realization, Newton was able to write 
the general formula for this force:
 
1
2
2
 m m
F
G
r
=
 
where  F is the force with which two bodies with mass  m 1 and  m 2 separated by 
a distance  r attract each other;  G is the gravitational constant. The two bodies 
may be you and the Earth or the Earth and the Sun. This uniﬁ cation was 
nothing less than a revolution in classical physics. For example, the airplanes 
and the satellites make use of this uniﬁ ed concept. 
 As another example, the electric force is the force that repels two similarly 
charged particles away from each other and attracts two oppositely charged 
particles toward each other. The magnetic force is the force that makes 
magnets repel or attract each other. Electric and magnetic forces were sup-
posed to be two different forces. In the nineteenth century, it was proved that 
electric and magnetic forces are two different manifestations of the same force 
called the EM force. James Clark Maxwell is given credit for this uniﬁ cation 
of electric and magnetic forces, and the equations in physics that illustrate this 
uniﬁ cation are called Maxwell ’ s equations of electromagnetism. So, the ﬁ elds 
of electricity and magnetism were uniﬁ ed into one ﬁ eld called electromagne-
tism. The great product of this uniﬁ cation is the realization (or discovery) that 
light is an EM wave. 
 In the second half of the twentieth century, Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg, 
and Sheldon Glashow demonstrated that the EM force and the weak nuclear 
force are the two different manifestations of the same force called the elec-
troweak force. They were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics (1979) for this 
uniﬁ cation. This uniﬁ cation predicted the existence of some fundamental par-
ticles unknown at the time. The existence of one of these particles was con-
ﬁ rmed at several experiments at CERN, in which the author of this book also 
participated. 
 Physicists believe that the four fundamental forces that govern our universe 
today are the low - energy manifestations of the single uniﬁ ed force, say the 
super force, at high energy that existed at the moment the universe was 
created. The work is still in progress. The uniﬁ cation of forces is illustrated in 
Figure  1.24 . 
 Some uniﬁ cation events are summarized in Table  1.6 . 
 Uniﬁ cation is in the very spirit of scientiﬁ c thinking: looking for a common 
principle to explain a multitude of observations and phenomena. This thinking 
has its root in our being cognizant of the environment around us and around 
our knowledge and theories. If we divide the world into macro and micro, we 
are macrobeings. However, if we consider the universal scale of size, we actu-
ally fall in the mid - range: We cannot see very small, such as atoms, and we

cannot see very large, such as the whole earth, entities at once or the universe 
in its entirety. Therefore our ﬁ rst observations and theories resulting from 
them also work well in the mid - range and breakdown on both ends of the 
spectrum. In this book, you will see how classical physics breaks down in the 

72  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
microworld, the world of the very small. However, keep in mind that classical 
physics also breaks down in some ways in the world of the very large. For 
example, classical physics fails to explain the behavior of objects moving at 
very large speed. Quantum physics is needed to explain phenomena in the 
microworld, whereas the special theory of relativity is needed to explain the 
world of very large speeds. 
 1.21  SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY 
 As we mentioned earlier, from the work of several physicists, including Young, 
Fresnel, and Maxwell, it was realized that light was a wave. As it often happens, 
with this achievement or solution, came another puzzle that eventually led to 
Einstein ’ s special theory of relativity. At that time, all the known waves needed 
a medium to travel: sound waves travel through air, water waves travel through 
water, and so on. So the puzzle was What is the medium that light waves need 
to propagate through? It was known that light reaches us from outer space 
and possibly traveling through a vacuum on the way. This is an ideal example 
of how we (even the scientists) are prisoners of our past experience and 
knowledge. Great scientiﬁ c discoveries are made by those who dare to break 
out of these self - made prisons. Continuing with the story, because all the waves 
discovered by then needed a medium to travel through, scientists assumed 
that light must need a medium too, even though it was known that light was 
apparently traveling through a vacuum to reach us from outer space. 
 So, driven by the need of a medium for light waves, scientists placed a 
hypothetical medium, called ether, in the vacuum, and everywhere else in the 
universe to be consistent. And off came the amazing properties of this mystic 
medium to ﬁ t in to our existing knowledge. It must have very low density so 
that the planets could move through it with no measurable change in their 
orbit positions and yet it must be so elastic that light, which was known to 
have an incredibly high speed, could propagate through it. However, the 
beauty of science is that you can theorize and fantasize as much as you can, 
but at the end of the day, your theory must withstand the test of experiments. 
It was not easy at the time to design an experiment to test the existence of 
ether. However, scientists tried for years by developing ever ﬁ ner instruments 
and analysis methods. Eventually, there followed the experiment by Albert 
Michelson (1887) in collaboration with Edward Morley, which was designed 
to measure the motion of earth through ether. The experimental apparatus 
was sensitive enough to measure the ether drift due to the motion of the Earth, 
but to the surprise of the scientiﬁ c world, no drift was detected. 
 Albert Einstein, a patent clerk at that time, interpreted the negative results 
of the Michelson – Morley experiment to develop what we know today as the 
special theory of relativity that he published in 1905. We are not covering this 
theory in this book, however, we present in this section some important fea-
tures of this theory relevant to this book. 

SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY  73
 Energy Mass Equivalence.   Mass,  m , and energy,  E , are equivalent and inter-
convertible according to the following equation:
 
 E
mc
=
2  
 (1.95) 
where  c  is the speed of light through a vacuum, a constant;  m is the rela-
tivistic mass; and  E is the relativistic energy. For example, the Sun is 
powered by the conversion of mass into energy, which follows this 
formula. Given that  c  =  3  ×  10 8  m  s  − 1 , the factor  c 2 is a very big number. 
This ﬁ nding leads to the potential to release tremendous amounts of 
energy. 
 Relativistic Mass.   The mass,  m , of an object moving at speed  v is related to 
the mass,  m 0 , of the object at rest by the following equation:

 The mass  m is called the relativistic mass and  m 0 is called the rest mass. 
 Note that the concept of relativistic mass does not exist in Newtonian 
physics, in which the mass of a particle is always a constant and is equal 
to the rest mass. As shown in  Study Checkpoint 1.9 and in Figure  1.25 , 
this is a good approximation for an object moving substantially less than 
the speed of light; that is, we are dealing with speed,  v  <<  c .

 Equation  1.100 is the equation we will use in this book when we are 
dealing with relativistic energy or momentum. In most of the book, our 
treatment is nonrelativistic because this book covers nonrelativistic 
quantum mechanics. 
 We have covered a lot of material in this chapter with the intention 
of offering a brief review of classical physics. From this review, you 
should develop an understanding of the classical approach to physics. 
The key points of this classical approach emerging from the material 
covered in this chapter are summarized next in Section  1.22 . 
 1.22  CLASSICAL APPROACH 
 Emerging from the review of classical physics presented here, you should see 
some core elements that deﬁ ne the classical approach of looking at the physi-
cal world. These elements are summarized in this section. 
   1.22.1    Separation of Particles and Waves: Either It Is a Particle or a Wave 
 In classical physics, particles and waves are two different types of entities. 
Particles are localized objects and can often be treated as point particles. Large 
particles and bulk matter are made of some fundamental particles and not 
waves. A moving particle transports energy by virtue of its moving mass. 
Waves, on the other hand, are spread out, a disturbance of some sort that 
transports energy from one point to another without transporting matter, and 
cannot be localized to a point. Particles can transport energy too, but by 
moving their mass. Waves have some unique characteristics, such as interfer-
ence or superposition, in which the two waves can cancel each other out or 
add to each other. In other words, their amplitudes add or subtract depending 
on whether the interference is constructive or destructive. In the framework 
of classical physics, particles do not exhibit this interference phenomenon. 
 Other properties unique to waves include frequency, wavelength, refraction, 
and diffraction. 
 1.22.2  Either It Is Here or There: The Certainty 
 Knowing the current position and momentum of a particle under a given force, 
we can precisely predict its position and momentum at any time in the future. 

76  
FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
Classical physics can make these predictions with full certainty; it is determin-
istic. Physical observables can be predicted and determined with certainty. 
 1.22.3  The World Is Continuous: Any Value Within a Range Is Possible 
 In the framework of classical physics, a particle can have any value within the 
acceptable range of values for its observables, such as position, momentum, 
and energy. In other words, the spectrum of possible values is a continuous 
spectrum. As an example, consider a ball of 1  kg mass. It will not be surprising 
if I say I can give any velocity to the ball between 0 and 25  m  s  − 1 . If the kinetic 
energy  E of the ball is  1
2
2
mv , all values of kinetic energy between 0  J and 312.5  J 
are possible. In other words, as shown in Figure  1.26 , the possible values of  E 
for this ball for velocities in the range of 0 and 25  m/s are represented by a 
continuous curve. 
 1.22.4  Common Grounds Among Particles and Waves: A Red Flag 
 As mentioned earlier, classical physics treats particles and waves as different 
types of entities. However, let us make a preliminary case to challenge that 
notion. While particles and waves have their own unique characteristics, they 
also share some properties or observables. For example, a moving particle 
transports energy from one place to another in the form of kinetic energy. 
Waves transport energy too. By deﬁ nition, waves are traveling disturbances 
that carry energy. This ﬁ nding is true about standing waves, discussed in this 
chapter, as well because standing waves are just superpositions of traveling 
waves. Furthermore, most waves, such as water and sound waves, need a

1  kg mass.

SUMMARY  77
material medium to travel, and particles are material as well. Even the waves 
that do not need a medium to travel through, such as EM wave, need particles 
for their existence: You need charged particles to create EM waves. 
 Now here is a dilemma: Energy is transported in waves, but matter is not. 
However, as mentioned earlier, in the beginning of the twentieth century, 
Albert Einstein proposed in his special theory of relativity that matter (mass) 
and energy are equivalent according to Eq.  1.95 :
 
 E
mc
=
2  
 (1.95) 
where  m is the mass of the particle and  c is the speed of light. 
 If energy and mass are equivalent, then the waves can be considered trans-
porting mass as well because they certainly transport energy. I will leave you 
with this dilemma, as an exercise to solve as you go through the forthcoming 
chapters. You can take it as a starting point in doubting classical physics theo-
retically. In Chapter  2 , we will see how experimental results challenged the 
classical approach in a big way. 
 1.23  SUMMARY 
 Most of the concepts in classical physics can be derived from the three funda-
mental concepts: physical entity, space in which the entity exists, and time 
with which the entity changes its position in space. Classical physics, the 
physics of the macroworld, divides the physical world into two types of 
entities: particles and waves. Both particles and waves transport momentum 
and energy from one point to another in space. Waves do this transportation 
without transporting the matter. In classical physics, the motion of particles is 
governed by the fundamental equation of motion representing Newton ’ s 
second law of motion:

 The world and the universe is held together in an order due to the four fun-
damental forces of nature. These four forces encompass all the forces that 
cause change and motion in physical entities. These four forces are gravita-
tional, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces.

FIRST, THERE WAS CLASSICAL PHYSICS 
 In a nutshell, this chapter has been a very brief review of classical physics 
aimed at making you realize that the classical approach divides the world of 
physical entities into two parts: particles and waves. This division mirrors the 
physical reality that we sense or experience as macrobeings. However, because 
the macroscopic world has been basically built from the objects of the micro-
scopic world, such as molecules and atoms and subatomic particles, therefore 
the physical reality that we experience in the macroworld has its roots in the 
microworld. In the microscopic world, the standalone classical pictures of 
particles and waves collapse. This is where quantum mechanics comes into the 
picture with one promise: uniﬁ cation of two concepts: particles and waves. 
You will learn in Chapters  2 and  3 how this uniﬁ cation was historically 
achieved.

very faint red specks that you would see if the ﬁ gure was in color, are seen as they 
appeared 13 billion years ago, or roughly 650 million years after the Big Bang that, 
started the universe according to the Big Bang theory. This theory predicts that the 
cosmic microwave background ﬁ lls all of observable space. Most radiation energy in 
the universe is in the cosmic microwave background, a faint glow almost exactly the 
same in all directions, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This 
glow should be strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. Hence, the 
name  cosmic microwave background radiation , because according to the Big Bang 
theory, a microsecond after the Big Bang, the universe consisted of a hot plasma (a 
state of matter) of photons, electrons, and baryons, such as protons and neutrons. The 
photons were constantly interacting with the rest of the plasma through scattering. As 
the universe expanded, the plasma cooled enough to create favorable conditions for 
electrons to combine with protons and form hydrogen atoms. This event happened at 
 ∼ 3000  K, when the universe was  ∼ 379,000 - years old. At this point, the photons scattered 
off the now electrically neutral atoms and began to travel freely through space, result-
ing in the decoupling of matter and radiation. The temperature, and hence the fre-
quency (color) of the photons, has continued to diminish ever since; it is now down to 
2.725   K corresponding to the microwave part of the electromagnetic (EM) radiation 
spectrum. The temperature of this radiation will continue to drop as the universe keeps 
expanding. 
 One of the greatest powers of the Big Bang theory is its prediction of almost perfect 
black - body (Section  2.3 ) spectrum in the cosmic microwave background. One of 
the greatest successes of the Big Bang theory is that this prediction is supported by 
experimental results. For example, The cosmic microwave background radiation 
(CMBR) has a thermal black - body spectrum at a temperature of 2.725  K, thus the 
spectrum peaks in the microwave range frequency of 160.2  GHz, corresponding to a 
1.9 - mm wavelength. The glow is almost, but not quite, uniform in all directions. It shows 
a very speciﬁ c pattern equal to that expected if the inherent randomness of a red - hot 
gas is blown up to the size of the universe. These predictions are supported by the data 
collected by  The Far - Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer ( FIRAS ) instrument on the 
NASA Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite, which has carefully measured 
the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. The FIRAS project members 
compared the CMBR with an internal reference black body and the spectra agreed to 
within the experimental error.

PARTICLE BEHAVIOR OF WAVES 
 2.1  INTRODUCTION 
 In Chapter  1 , you learned about particles and waves and that classical physics 
makes a clear distinction between these entities: particles are particles and 
waves are waves. You also learned that light is considered to be a wave in the 
classical world. Particles are explained by Newtonian mechanics and waves 
are explained by the wave equations. To some scientists during the nineteenth 
century, this picture seemed complete. So much so that William Thomson 
Kelvin (also known as Lord Kelvin), a great physicist of the nineteenth century, 
thought that the basic outline of physical theory was more or less complete. 
Kelvin noted, however, that there remained  “ two small clouds ” : The two prob-
lems that would soon be solved and dispersed by classical physicists. Little did 
he (or anyone else at that time) know that these two little clouds carried the 
seeds of two new theories that would deconstruct the entire nineteenth century 
physics and deﬁ ne the physics of the twentieth century. One of these two theo-
ries is the theory of relativity, which came out of one problem (cloud), the 
challenge of explaining the results of the Michelson – Morley experiment. This 
experiment was set up to detect the hypothetical universal medium called 
ether through which light was assumed to travel. At that time, the concept of 
light as an EM wave had not yet been developed. Light, as understood at that 
time, needed a medium to travel through. However, the experimental results 
from the Michelson – Morley experiment showed no evidence of such a medium. 
Einstein ’ s interpretation of these negative results led him to the theory of 
relativity. The other theory is quantum theory, whose development started with 
an effort to resolve the second cloud, the failure of classical theory to explain 
the radiation emitted by a black body. 
 In general, the classical wave picture of light ran into big trouble in the 
second half of the nineteenth century due to the observation of some phenom-
ena that classical physics could not explain. These phenomena included black -
 body radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the Compton effect. The successful 
explanations presented by physicists for the results from the experiments 
exhibiting these phenomena revealed that light consists of particles. In other 
words, light can exhibit particle behavior. Classical physics had no justiﬁ cation 
for such a behavior. Some radical ideas and models were proposed to explain 
this strange behavior, which contributed to the development of a new physics 
that we now know as quantum physics. 
 While you go through this chapter, pay attention to the three underly-
ing streams of thought: failure of classical physics to explain a set of 
phenomena, evolution of the quantum picture to successfully explain these 
phenomena, and the role of quantum physics in understanding and using 
these phenomena in various applications. 
 2.2  THE NATURE OF LIGHT: THE BIG PICTURE 
 Sunlight is directly or indirectly a major source of energy for planet earth. In 
fact, it would be impossible to sustain life on earth without the regular supply 

THE NATURE OF LIGHT: THE BIG PICTURE  83
of sunlight. As you will see in this and forthcoming chapters, light also played 
a signiﬁ cant role in the evolution of quantum physics. In our macroworld, we 
see the physical reality in terms of particles and waves (the classical picture) 
and it makes sense to our senses. All matter is considered to be made of fun-
damental particles, such as protons, neutrons, and electrons. Light (energy) is 
a wave that interacts with matter (particles) to give rise to interesting and 
useful phenomena. For example, it is the interaction of sunlight with molecules, 
called chlorophyll, contained within the cells of plants that make energy in the 
form of carbohydrates, such as starch and cellulose. 
 
 Note :  As you know from Chapter  1 , light, that is, visible light, is one narrow part of 
the EM radiation spectrum. Also, note that light, like any other part of EM radia-
tion, represents pure energy and has no mass. As you will see, this view survives 
even quantum mechanics. 
 As you learned in Chapter  1 , visible light is part of the EM radiation spec-
trum with wavelength in the range of  ∼ 400 – 700  nm. Your eye has receptors 
that can absorb this energy and convert it into images: fascinating! In addition 
to visible light, the EM radiation includes infrared (IR) radiation, ultraviolet 
(UV) radiation, and X - rays. As seen in Chapter  1 , James Clerk Maxwell was 
among those who ﬁ rst postulated EM radiation in the form of waves, called 
EM waves. In other words, EM radiation is a self - propagating wave in space. 
In addition to having fundamental wave characteristics, such as intensity, fre-
quency, and wavelength, EM radiation was found also to exhibit wave behav-
ior, such as reﬂ ection, refraction, and diffraction. Electromagnetic radiation 
can travel as a self - propagating wave in space, and it can travel without the 
presence of matter. This is why we can see stars and galaxies millions of light 
years away from us. A light year is the distance that light travels in one calen-
dar year, and is equal to 9.45  ×  10 12  km, as shown in Problem  2.1 . 
 
 Note :  Usually light means the visible part of the EM spectrum. However, sometimes 
in the literature the whole EM spectrum is also referred to as light. So, gather the 
exact meaning of the word light from the context.

PARTICLE BEHAVIOR OF WAVES 
 From the historical perspective, it is noteworthy to mention Newton ’ s role 
in understanding the behavior of light. Largely responsible for developing 
the particle part of classical physics, Newton saw light as a stream of particles. 
Recall from Chapter  1 that he put forward the Corpuscular theory of 
light in which light consists of corpuscles, that is, particles. The wave and 
particle view of light were the subjects of disagreement that goes back to as 
early as the seventeenth century. Although this issue was too early to be 
resolved during those times, we will see that neither Newton nor the 
proponents of the wave nature of light were wrong. In the beginning of the 
nineteenth century, experiments performed by scientists, such as Thomas 
Young, supported the wave nature of light. However, toward the end of the 
nineteenth century, just when Maxwell thought he had a perfect theory 
to explain electromagnetic radiation, further investigations of EM waves 
contradicted the wave view of light and challenged the classical theory. 
Scientists ran into trouble with the wave nature (the classical picture) of 
light, which could not correctly explain certain phenomena exhibited by light, 
such as black - body radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the Compton 
effect, also called Compton scattering. This chapter discusses how the 
classical picture of light failed to explain these phenomena and how a 
quantum picture of light started emerging from bold attempts to explain 
these phenomena. 
 2.3  BLACK - BODY RADIATION 
 Interaction between matter and light has been signiﬁ cant both as a tool in the 
advancement of science and as the role it plays in the many everyday processes 
needed to sustain life on our planet, as explained earlier. Light interacts with 
matter through various phenomena, such as reﬂ ection, refraction, diffraction, 
and absorbance. 
 In many situations, when studying the interaction of light with matter, it 
is useful to assume that matter is a perfect absorber of light. A black - body 
is deﬁ ned in physics as an object that absorbs all the light that falls on it: 
No incident light is reﬂ ected and none is allowed to pass through it. It may 
sound counterintuitive to some, but a black body is also a good radiator, 
that is, the black body can re - emit radiation, because the abilities of a 
body to absorb and to radiate light are closely related to each other. The 
underlying principle is  It is a natural tendency of any system in the universe 
to be in equilibrium with its surroundings . A body at constant temperature, 
by deﬁ nition, is in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings. This means 
it absorbs light energy (from its surroundings) at the same rate as it emits. 
The radiation emitted by a  black body therefore is called black - body 
radiation. 
 A black body absorbs all EM waves (light) falling on it regardless of their 
frequency. Therefore a black body is also an ideal source of radiation, the 

BLACK-BODY RADIATION  85
black - body radiation, which is a mixture of frequencies that are determined 
by only one thing, the temperature of the black body. In other words, which 
characteristic frequencies are present in black - body radiation, and what the 
predominant frequency is depends on the temperature,  T , of the body. 
For example, a black body emits IR light at room temperature, and visible 
light (red through blue) at a temperature a few hundred degrees above 
room temperature. If the temperature is increased further, a black body 
starts emitting UV light, and so on. For example, a piece of coal is black 
when it is cold. It starts emitting visible light as you raise its temperature 
by starting the ﬁ re. As coals or stones are heated to higher and higher 
temperatures, they emit higher energy lights, and as a result move from being 
red to blue. 
 In the real world, it is hard to ﬁ nd an ideal (perfect) black body. In the labo-
ratory, a black body can be approximated by a cavity, a hollow object that has 
a small hole leading to its interior. Any radiation that enters the hole is trapped 
inside by the back - and - forth reﬂ ection until it is completely absorbed. This 
concept is illustrated in Figure  2.1 . Toward the end of the nineteenth century, 
black - body radiation was being examined with great interest, because it was 
one of those phenomena that were challenging the existing wisdom of physics, 
the classical physics. 
 2.3.1  The Classical Collapse 
 Classical physics was unable to explain the experimentally observed spectrum 
of black - body radiation illustrated in Figure  2.2 , which shows the intensity of 
the emitted radiation as a function of wavelength at different temperatures. 
As illustrated in this ﬁ gure, the experiments revealed that the peak of the 
radiation curve (the highest intensity) moves to higher intensities and shorter 
 Figure 2.1.  Two - dimensional illustration of light captured in a spherical cavity. 

86

wavelengths as the temperature of the black body (cavity walls) is increased. 
Deriving these curves supported by experimental results from classical physics 
was a major challenge in the late nineteenth century. Lord Rayleigh and James 
Jeans were among those who were working on this problem. In an attempt to 
explain the experimental observations, they used everything classical physics 
could offer on this issue to derive the following formula, the Rayleigh – Jeans 
formula:

(2.3)
 
 The integration comes from the underlying assumption of classical physics 
that the black body emits energy in a continuous fashion. You can also realize 
Eq.  2.3 from an important theorem of classical physics called equipartition of 
energy, which states that the average energy per degree of freedom of an entity 
that is a member of a system of such entities (think of a molecule of an ideal 
gas) in thermal equilibrium at temperature  T is  1
2 kT. A standing wave in a 
black body has two degrees of freedom, and hence its energy is  kT . We will 
discuss the equipartition theorem in Chapter  10 (e.g., Section  10.3 ), where we 
explore statistical quantum mechanics. 
 By looking carefully at Eqs.  2.1 and  2.2 , you can predict a problem, that is, 
the energy density keeps increasing without limit with the increase in fre-
quency or decrease in wavelength. This means for inﬁ nitely high frequency 
(UV frequencies), which is at a very low wavelength, the energy density 
will be inﬁ nity. As illustrated in Figure  2.3 for  T  =  5800  K, the experimental 
results do not support the absurd predictions of these calculations. This 
huge deviation of experimental results from theoretical predictions at low 
wavelengths (high frequencies) is known as the UV catastrophe of classical 
theory.

 This disagreement encouraged critical thinking about the existing EM theory. 
 2.3.2  The Quantum Rescue 
 As pointed out in Section  2.3.1 , the root of the problem in the classical for-
mulae 2.1 and 2.2 lies in the underlying assumption that the energy emission 
is continuous, which gives rise to integration in Eq.  2.1 shown in Eq.  2.3 . 
Obviously, this classical assumption is challenged by the experimental results, 
as illustrated in Figure  2.3 . So, what would the alternative be? If energy is not 
emitted continuously, a reasonable alternative to explore is that it is emitted 
in discrete amounts. It was unconventional to think like that during those 
times, that is exactly what Max Planck, a physicist working on this problem at 
the time, proposed: The radiation,  E , is emitted in energy steps of  hf . This has 
two implications to modify Eq.  2.1 : 
 1.  In Eq.  2.1 ,  E is given by
 
 E
nhf
n =
 
 (2.4) 
where  n  =  0, 1, 2,  … 
 and  h is a constant with the value given by

 As you see,  h is a proportionality constant between energy and fre-
quency, called Planck ’ s constant. Robert Millikan made the ﬁ rst mea-
surement of Planck ’ s constant in 1916. 
 2.  The integrals representing continuous emission in Eq.  2.3 should be 
replaced with sums representing discrete emission of energy:
 →∑
∫
 
 By doing this and substituting the value of  E a from Eq.  2.4 into Eq.  2.3 , we 
obtain

the region of long wavelengths than in the region of very small wave lengths.

 Equations  2.6 and  2.7 are different forms of what is called Planck ’ s formula 
for black - body radiation that Planck came up with in 1900, and turned out to 
be in complete agreement with experimental observations at that time. This 
continues to be the case to date. As an example, Figure  2.4 shows the compari-
son of data with Planck ’ s theory for the cosmic background described in Figure 
 2.0 . The ﬁ gure presents the cosmic microwave background spectrum measured 
by the  Far - Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer (FIRAS) instrument on the 
Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite operated by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). This is the most - precisely 
measured black - body spectrum in nature. The solid curve shows the expected 
intensity from a single temperature black - body spectrum, as predicted by the 

BLACK-BODY RADIATION  91
Big Bang theory. The FIRAS data, taken at 34 points equally spaced along the 
curve, match the curve so exactly with error uncertainties less than the width 
of the black - body curve, that it is impossible to distinguish the data from the 
theoretical curve generated by Planck ’ s law after taking into account the pre-
dictions of the Big Bang theory as described in the Figure  2.0 . 
 The agreement is so good that the datapoints and error bars on this graph 
are obscured by the theoretical curve representing the prediction of Planck ’ s 
theory.

 Max Planck was born on April 23, 1858 in 
Kiel, Germany, and received his education at 
Munich and Berlin. While considering a 
career in science at Munich University in 
1874, Planck discussed the prospects of 
physics research with Philipp von Jolly, a 
physics professor at the time in Munich at 
Munich University. Von Jolly candidly 
advised Planck to consider a career in some 
other discipline because physics was 
essentially complete with little prospects for 
further development. Planck was not 
persuaded. 
 Planck worked on black - body radiation 
because he thought it could be understood 
independent of atomic structure, which was 
still a mystery during those times. He ﬁ rst 
discovered (guessed) the correct formula for 
black - body radiation and then strived for its 
physical interpretation: radiation is emitted 
in energy steps of  hf . Planck received the 
Nobel Prize in 1918 for this discovery that is 
now considered as the start of the quantum 
or modern physics. Although he is 
considered the founder of quantum physics, 
Planck remained skeptical of the quantum 
reality for a long time. 
 Max Planck spent most of his life in 
Germany, where he died on October 4, 1947 
at the age of 89.

THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT  93
 During the same time, while physicists were struggling to explain the 
experimental observation of black - body radiation, there was another unex-
plained phenomenon related to light (EM waves) called the photoelectric 
effect. 
 2.4  THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT 
 The photoelectric effect, illustrated in Figure  2.5 , refers to the phenomenon 
in which electrons are emitted from a metal surface as a result of EM 
radiation incident on the surface. The ejected electrons are called photoelec-
trons. This effect is sometimes also called the Hertz effect, after the name of 
the physicist who brought it into the limelight. Further studies of this effect 
by other scientists contributed signiﬁ cantly to the understanding of the 
quantum nature of light, and therefore of wave – particle duality, discussed in 
Chapter  3 . 
 2.4.1  The Photoelectric Effect: The Experiment 
 The photoelectric effect is one of the experiments that shattered classical 
physics at the atomic scale and gave birth to quantum physics. In Chapter  1 , 
we learned the classical picture of light in the form of EM waves. In the 
late nineteenth century, researchers were performing experiments on EM 
waves. 
 Figure 2.5.   Illustration of the photoelectric effect.

PARTICLE BEHAVIOR OF WAVES 
 
 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz 
(1857 – 1894) 
 Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, a physicist and 
electronic engineer, was born on February 
22, 1857 in Hamburg, Germany. The 
frequency unit hertz (Hz) is named after 
him. Hertz obtained his Ph.D. from the 
University of Berlin in 1880, where he 
continued as a postdoctoral researcher. 
 In 1883, Hertz accepted a post as a 
lecturer in theoretical physics at the 
University of Kiel. In 1885, Hertz became a 
full professor at the University of Karlsruhe, 
where he performed experiments on EM 
waves. He was the ﬁ rst to demonstrate the 
existence of EM waves in 1888 by building 
and using the apparatus to produce and 
detect very high frequency (VHF) and 
ultrahigh frequency (UHF) radio waves. 
 Hertz died of Wegener ’ s granulomatosis 
at a young age of 36. 
 While performing experiments on producing and detecting EM waves in 
1887, Heinrich Hertz observed the photoelectric effect. His experimental 
apparatus consisted of a spark gap in which a spark would be observed upon 
the detection of EM waves. He observed that sparks occurred more readily 
when UV light was directed at one of the metal balls in the apparatus. He 
reported this observation, but never followed up on it. However, other 
researchers, such as J.J. Thomson and Von Lenard, did follow up on this 
observation by studying different aspects of this phenomenon using suitable 
experimental setups. 
 
 Note :  A spark gap refers to the gap between two conducting electrodes and is 
usually ﬁ lled with a suitable gas, such as air. Upon applying a suitable voltage 
between the electrodes, a spark forms that ionizes the gas and drastically reduces 
its electrical resistance. As a result, an electric current ﬂ ows until the path of ionized 
gas is broken or the current reduces below a minimum value. 
 Figure  2.6 presents a schematic diagram of a typical experimental setup to 
study the photoelectric effect. As shown in the ﬁ gure, the apparatus includes 
an evacuated tube that contains two electrodes connected to a source of vari-
able voltage. The light falls on the surface of a metal plate knocking some 
electrons, called photoelectrons, off the surface. Depending on their kinetic 
energy (KE), some of these photoelectrons reached the other end, the cathode, 
in spite of the negative polarity of the cathode. The vacuum helps the photo-
electrons move at a constant speed to produce a measurable current, called

the photocurrent. Establishing the voltage difference, called the barrier voltage, 
between the two electrodes facilitates the determination of the KE of the 
photoelectrons. The slower moving electrons, the electrons with a low value 
of KE, are repelled back before they could reach the cathode. When the 
voltage opposing the movement of electrons toward the cathode reaches (or 
exceeds) the threshold value  V 0 , no photoelectrons arrived at the cathode. This 
threshold voltage, also called the  barrier or  stopping voltage , represents the 
maximum KE of any emitted electron, that is, the photoelectron. 
 On the surface, the photoelectric effect was not a surprise, factoring in 
the principle of conservation of energy. One could argue that the incident 
EM waves had some energy, which converted into the kinetic energy of 
the emitted electrons. However, the devil was in the detail discussed next in 
Section  2.4.2 . 
 2.4.2  The Classical Collapse 
 In Chapter  1 , you learned that energy is the common property of waves and 
particles. Furthermore, matter (mass) is a property of particles and waves are 
pure energy, but can manifest themselves in moving matter. So, considering 
the principle of conservation of energy, the photoelectric effect should not be 
a surprise. One can argue that the EM waves incident on the metal surface 
transferred their energy to electrons in the atoms, which came out as photo-
electrons. However, the classical picture was challenged by the details of 
experimental observations collected from different experiments, for example, 
from an experiment by Millikan displayed in Figure  2.7 , as described in the 
following: 
 1.  When light strikes the metal surface, photoelectrons are emitted instantly 
as demonstrated by the current measured. This is true regardless of the 

96  
PARTICLE BEHAVIOR OF WAVES 
intensity of light once it is above a certain threshold. This instant emis-
sion of photoelectrons cannot be explained by classical physics according 
to which the energy of the EM wave incident on the surface is spread 
across the wavefronts, and therefore it will take some time for the elec-
trons in the atom to absorb that energy before they could leave the atom 
in the form of photoelectrons. As shown by a simple calculation in 
Problem  2.4 , it may take days and months. 
 2.  At a given frequency of the incident EM waves, the strength of the 
current (i.e., the number of photoelectrons) is found to be directly pro-
portional to the intensity of light. In other words, at a given frequency, 
the brighter light yields more photoelectrons than the dimmer light, but 
the average energy of a photoelectron remains the same. In contrast to 
this experimental observation, the classical picture of EM waves predicts 
the increase in the photoelectron energy with the increase in the inten-
sity of light. This is because the light with greater intensity should have 
greater energy, and therefore will give a stronger push (energy) to the 
photoelectrons. 
 3.  The energy of emitted photoelectrons is found directly proportional to 
the frequency of the incident light. As mentioned earlier, classical physics 
expects the photoelectron energy to be proportional to the intensity of 
light, and not frequency. 
 4.  At a frequency below a certain critical (or threshold) frequency,  f 0 , no 
photoelectrons are emitted. The value of  f 0 is found to be a characteristic 
of the speciﬁ c metal used. Again, this observation cannot be explained 
by the EM wave theory of classical physics.

 PROBLEM 2.4 
 Consider a one - atom thick layer of Na that is square in shape with one side of the 
square equal to 50  cm. Light falls uniformly on this surface and produces photoelec-
trons. Assume that each atom has a diameter of 0.1  nm. Further assume that each 
atom absorbs enough light to produce a photoelectron with a kinetic energy of 
10  eV. How much time will it take for the atom to absorb this energy from the light 
falling on the surface with an intensity of 10  − 6  W/m 2 ?

 So, you can see how classical physics falls on its face in front of the experi-
mental observations of the photoelectric effect. 
 2.4.3  The Quantum Rescue 
 As mentioned in Section  2.4.2 , the energy of photoelectrons was observed to 
be directly proportional to the frequency of the incident light,  f , and there was 
no photoelectron emitted below a threshold frequency  f 0 . Thus, we can say that 
the experiments showed that the photoelectron energy,  E , was directly pro-
portional to  f  −  f 0 , which can mathematically be written as:
 
 E
h f
f
=
−
(
)
0  
 (2.8) 
where  h is the proportionality constant. If you measure and plot  E against 
( f  −  f 0 ), Eq.  2.8 tells you that you can read the value of  h as a slope of this 
linear plot. 
 All matter is composed of atoms, which in turn are composed of electrons, 
protons, and neutrons. In metals, some electrons are free to move from atom 
to atom: This is why they have high electrical and heat conductivity. These 
electrons at the metal surface can be easily removed. The minimum energy 
required to free an electron from a metal is called the  work function of the 
metal. 
 It turned out that the measured value of  h was the same as that of Planck ’ s 
constant in the black - body radiation experiments discussed earlier. As dis-
cussed earlier, to explain black - body radiation, Planck proposed that the 
energy of light comes in discrete amounts. In order to explain the experimental

 D.  Number of photoelectrons and their kinetic energy. 
 Answer:

 Note :  Robert Milikan received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1923 for his work on 
the elementary charge of electricity and on the photoelectric effect, whereas 
Einstein received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921 for his services to theoretical 
physics, especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect.

observations of the photoelectric effect, one needs to go a step further to 
propose that light is made up of particles that contain these discrete amounts 
of energy. That is exactly what Albert Einstein proposed in essence in 1905 in 
his research paper that partly won him the Nobel Prize. 
 According to Einstein ’ s proposal, the energy of light is not spread out across 
wavefronts as proposed by the classical picture, but is split in small packets 
called quanta of light, now known as photons. Planck had already proposed 

100  
PARTICLE BEHAVIOR OF WAVES 
in his attempt to explain black - body radiations that the energy was given to 
the EM waves in the form of discrete amounts. Einstein further proposed that 
energy is carried by EM waves in discrete amounts (light quanta), and energy 
is transferred from light to electrons in the form of discrete amounts in terms 
of light quanta. So, when it comes to transferring energy, it is not between the 
energy spread across the wavefront and the electron, it is between the light 
quanta and the electron. This is what explains the instantaneous transfer of 
energy from light to electrons. Each light quanta that is a photon at frequency 
 f , has the same energy,  hf . So, the key point is that changing the intensity of 
light will change the number of light quanta, but not the energy of the quanta. 
This proposition that an electron acquires energy by absorbing a single photon 
(light quanta), explains why change in light intensity changed the number of 
emitted electrons, but not their energy. Furthermore, the higher the frequency, 
 f , of light, the higher the energy,  hf , of photons, and therefore the higher the 
energy of the emitted electrons. Below a certain frequency, the threshold fre-
quency, no electrons will be emitted, no matter what the intensity of light. 
 
 Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955) 
 Albert Einstein, a physicist, was born on 
March 14, 1879 in Ulm, Wurttemberg, 
Germany. He is well known for discovering 
the theory of relativity, and especially for his 
mass – energy equivalence equation:  E  =  mc 2 . 
He was awarded Nobel Prize in physics in 
1921  “ for his services to Theoretical Physics, 
and especially for his discovery of the law of 
the photoelectric effect ” . Although Einstein 
was one of a very few who got the genie of 
quantum mechanics out of the bottle, he 
never liked the underlying idea of quantum 
mechanics: the probability or uncertainty. He 
expressed his disbelief in this concept in his 
famous quote: God does not play dice. 
Einstein died on April 18, 1955 at the age of 
76, in Princeton, New Jersey, USA. 
 Einstein, named the person of the century 
by Time magazine in 1999, is the most 
recognized scientist in history. Across the 
countries and cultures, his name has become 
synonymous to genius. 
 So, all the pieces fell in place to explain all the experimental observations by 
the following propositions by Einstein: 
 1.  Energy in light exists in the form of light quanta: the photons. 
 2.  When light with frequency  f falls on a metal surface, an electron in an 
atom absorbs one photon with energy  hf . 

THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT  101
 3.  Part of the absorbed energy,  hf 0, is spent to remove the electron from the 
surface of the metal, where  f 0 is the threshold frequency, and the rest of 
the energy turns into the kinetic energy of the photoelectron. This can 
be expressed in the following equation:
 E
hf
hf
E
EM
ke
=
=

0
 
where, 
  •   h is Planck ’ s constant. 
  •   f is the frequency of the incident light, and therefore of the photons. 
  •   f 0 is the threshold frequency of light for the photoelectric effect to 
happen. 
  •   hf is the energy of the incident light, and therefore of incident photons. 
  •   E ke is the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. 
 The energy  hf 0 is called the work function of the metal and is needed for 
an electron to leave the metal surface. The work function of some ele-
ments is presented in Table  2.1 . Einstein ’ s explanation of the photoelec-
tric effect partly won him the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921.

 In a nutshell, experimental observations of black - body radiation revealed 
that light energy is radiated in discrete amounts. The photoelectric effect

 Toward the end of the nineteenth century, physicists were also making intense 
efforts to understand the origin and nature of a penetrating radiation called 
X - rays, discovered in 1895 by Wilhelm R ö ntgen (1845 – 1923), a professor at 
the University of Wurzburg, Germany. 
 2.5  X - RAY DIFFRACTION 
 X - rays are another player in the development of quantum physics. After 
intense studies of X - rays, it became clear by 1912 that X - rays were a form of 
EM waves. As explained in Chapter  1 , when EM (light) waves pass through a 
narrow slit, they are scattered in such a way that they seem to spread out, or 
bend around the edges of the slit, a phenomenon called diffraction. When EM 
waves, such as X - rays, pass through a set of evenly spaced narrow slits, called 
diffraction grating, the scattered waves interact to form a series of bright bands 
corresponding to constructive interference and dark bands corresponding to 
destructive interference, a pattern called a diffraction pattern. The most effec-
tive diffraction of waves occurs when the wavelength of the waves and the 
width of the slits are comparable in magnitudes. Scientists including Arnold 
Sommerfeld (1868 – 1951) and Wilhelm Wien (1864 – 1928) estimated the wave-
length of X - rays to be in the range of 10 – 0.01  nm. Given that the distance 
between atoms in a crystal was typically on the order of 0.1  nm, Max von Lau 
(1879 – 1960) suggested that the X - rays should scatter from the atoms of a 
crystal. If X - rays were a form of EM waves, it should exhibit interference 
effects once scattered from the crystal atoms. 
 Lau was right, and making a long story short, much of our current knowl-
edge about the internal structure of the crystals has come from the study of 
X - rays scattered or diffracted by the crystals, a technique called X - ray diffrac-
tion crystallography, a form of X - ray spectroscopy. The spacing of the layers 
of atoms in a solid crystal, which work as the width of slits, is usually in the 
range of  ∼ 2 – 20  Å , which is within the range of the wavelength of X - rays:

separation  d . 
0.1 – 100  Å . X - ray crystallography uses the diffraction of X - rays through the 
target crystal material to determine the internal structure of the crystal. 
 
 Note :  A lattice is an arrangement of isolated points in space, called  lattice points , 
in a regular pattern, which shows the positions of atoms, molecules, or ions in the 
structure of a crystal. Recall that the atoms in a crystal are arranged in a periodic 
array. 
 A crystal consists of a regular array of atoms, and each of these atoms is 
capable of scattering any EM wave that is incident on it. In other words, atoms 
in a crystal are arranged in planes that are parallel to each other. X - ray dif-
fraction allows us to determine the structure of a crystal by determining the 
position of atoms in the lattice. A useful parameter in this determination is 
the spacing,  d , between the parallel planes. This is how this technique works: 
 1.  A collimated beam of X - rays is directed at the crystal. 
 2.  The X - ray photons in the incident beam are scattered in all directions 
from different layers of atoms in the crystals. 
 3.  Due to the regular arrangement of atoms in the crystal, in certain direc-
tions, the scattered waves interfere with one another constructively. 
These waves can be measured. 
 4.  The scattered waves with constructive interference (that are measured) 
are those waves that are parallel to each other, as shown in Figure  2.8 . 
 
 Note :  A collimated beam of light is a light beam in which the light rays are parallel 
to each other, and therefore have a plane wavefront. 

X-RAY DIFFRACTION  105
 The spacing in two layers of the crystal results in the difference in the path 
that the two interfering X - rays scattered from the two layers travel, called the 
path difference. 
 For the constructive interference to happen, the following conditions must 
be true: 
 1.  The EM rays are parallel to each other. This, as shown in Figure  2.8 , gives 
rise to the path difference of 2 d sin   θ , where  d is the spacing between the 
layers and  θ is the incident angle. 
 2.  The path difference between the arrays is an integral multiple of the 
wavelength of X - rays,   λ . This gives rise to the path difference of  n λ , 
where  n is an integer. 
 From these two conditions, it implies

 (2.9) 
 Equation  2.9 , ﬁ rst suggested by W.L. Bragg in 1912, is called Bragg ’ s law. It 
can be used to determine either the spacing  d if the wavelength  λ is known or 
vice versa. Typically, the incident X - ray beam is ﬁ xed in a direction and the 
crystal is rotated through a wide range of angles, and the spectrum of the scat-
tered X - rays is recorded. This is called an X - ray diffraction scan. To obtain a 
complete crystal structure, three sets of X - ray spectra are obtained, each cor-
responding to crystal rotations around one of the three mutually perpendicu-
lar planes of the crystal. The data from these spectra is analyzed to determine 
the positions of the atoms in the unit cell of the crystal. Recall that a crystal 
is a repetition of its unit cell in three dimensions (3D). 
 Readers with a biology background will be familiar with the famous X - ray 
diffraction photograph presented in Figure  2.9 a originally obtained in the 
early 1950s from the experiment conducted by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice 
Wilkins. From this diffraction image and data, James Watson and Francis Crick 
proposed the double helix structure of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mol-
ecule, something like that shown in Figure  2.9 b , for which they were awarded 
the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine in 1962. This has been one of the 
most important discoveries in molecular biology. 
 Arthur Holly Compton (1892 – 1962) discovered that the wavelength of 
X - rays increases after scattering. He explained this phenomenon in 1923 using 
the quantum approach. His work helped convince the remaining doubters of 
the reality of photons: the quanta of EM radiation. 
 Speaking about doubters, although Planck won the Nobel Prize for offering 
the explanation for black - body radiation based on the concept that light 
energy is emitted in discrete amounts or quanta, he did not believe in the 
physical reality of light quanta for a long time. He was not the only skeptic. 
He was only one of many scientists who were skeptics of this emerging picture. 
It was the discovery and explanation of the Compton effect that convinced 
many of these skeptics that light quanta was a physical reality. 

106  
PARTICLE BEHAVIOR OF WAVES 
 2.6  THE COMPTON EFFECT 
 Black - body radiation, as explained by Planck ’ s formula, demonstrated that 
light is emitted by a black body in discrete amounts called light (or energy) 
quanta. The photoelectric effect, explained by Einstein, demonstrated that 
light is not only emitted in quanta, but is also absorbed in quanta, and perhaps 
carried in quanta as well. These conclusions point to the ultimate conclusion: 
Light consists of quanta, individual independent particles. But there are impli-
cations. If light consists of particle - like quanta, then these quanta should 
behave like particles when they hit other particles, such as electrons. Think of 
two billiard balls: ball A hitting the ball B at rest. As a result of this collision, 
ball B will start moving in a certain direction determined by the momentum 
of ball A, and the energy and momentum of ball A will change after the col-
lision due to the conservation of energy and momentum, as explained in 
Chapter  1 . Because in the quantum picture, the energy is directly proportional 
to frequency (i.e., inversely proportional to wavelength), change in energy 
means change in frequency (and therefore change in wavelength). In other 
words, it should be possible that light hits an electron at rest, puts it into 
motion, and as a result changes its own frequency to a lower value. This behav-
ior of light cannot be explained in the classical picture. But if light is composed 
of particle - like light quanta, then this behavior is expected. This is an example 
of the kinds of questions and issues with which physicists were struggling when 
Arthur Compton in 1918 started studying X - rays, a form of EM waves with 
wavelength in the range of 10 – 0.01  nm, scattered by free electrons. This pre-
sented the situation of particle – particle scattering (or collision) discussed in 
Chapter  1 if light quanta were actually particles. It was Compton who coined 
the term photon for the light quanta.

THE COMPTON EFFECT  107
 
 Arthur Holly Compton 
(1892 – 1962) 
 Arthur Holly Compton was born on 
September 10, 1892 in Wooster, Ohio. He 
attended the College of Wooster and 
Princeton University, and started studying 
X - ray scattering in 1918. While at 
Washington University in St. Louis, he 
observed the shift in the wavelength of 
scattered X - rays, now known as the 
Compton effect. He explained this 
phenomenon in 1923 in terms of the 
quantum picture of light, and coined the 
term photon for the light quanta. 
 The discovery of the Compton effect and 
its explanation, which won Compton the 
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927, convinced 
many skeptics of the physical reality of light 
quanta, the photon. 
 Compton died on March 15, 1962 at the 
age of 69 in Berkeley, California, USA. 
 The X - ray scattering experiment is illustrated in Figure  2.10 . As shown in 
this ﬁ gure, a photon with momentum  P 1 , energy  E 1 , frequency  f 1 , and wave-
length   λ 1 collides with a free (unbound) electron at rest. The electron recoils 
at an angle   ϕ with the X - axis with momentum  P e , energy  E e , and the photon 
scatters away making angle   θ with its original direction and with momentum 
 P 2 , energy  E 2 , frequency  f 2 , and wavelength   λ 2 . 
 From Chapter  1 , we know that the total energy  E of a particle with momen-
tum  p and rest mass  m 0 can be written as:

no scattering, the change in wavelength is 0. On the other hand, when   θ  =  180 ° , 
in the case of backscattering, the change in wavelength is  2h / m 0 c . 
 Equation  2.13 , ﬁ rst derived by Compton during the early 1920s, accurately 
described the Compton effect, ﬁ rst observed by Compton. This effect and its 
explanation constituted a very strong case in favor of the quantum theory of 
light or radiation.

 As shown in Problem  2.6 , the maximum wave shift of a photon scattered 
by an electron is  ∼ 4.85  pm. This is a very small number and is difﬁ cult to 
observe experimentally unless the wavelength of the incident photon,   λ 1 , is 
small enough to make the fractional change appreciable. As illustrated in 
Problem 2.16, you can achieve a much greater fractional (or percentage) wave 
shift by using X - rays as opposed to visible light. 
 
 Alert :  Note the crucial difference between the end results of the photoelectric effect 
and the Compton effect: A photon is completely consumed in photoelectric effect, 
whereas only part of the energy of a photon is consumed by the electron in the 
Compton effect.

 So, now you know how the quantum picture of light is needed to explain 
phenomenon, such as black - body radiation, the photoelectric effect, and the 
Compton effect. You may ask What do these phenomena have to do with the 
real world? If with the help of quantum mechanics we can understand these 
phenomena and manipulate them, we may have an application of quantum 
mechanics in the real world. 
 2.7  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 Because we live in the macroworld and quantum physics is the physics of the 
microworld, it does not ﬁ t well with our common sense. Yet there are clearly 
many things in the macroworld like the spectrum of the Sun, a macroobject, 
that ﬁ t nicely to the quantum mechanics prediction of black - body radiation. 
Nevertheless, quantum physics is still obscure to most of the world, absurd to 
many, and is generally considered an intellectual exercise for physicists. Recent 
developments in science and technology, such as the emergence of nanotech-
nology, are bound to change that picture of quantum physics, because to carry 
on those developments, scientists will need to understand and use quantum 
physics. This is not to say that quantum physics did not have any applications 
so far. 
 This section discusses some of the applications of quantum physics related 
to the topics covered in this chapter. 
 2.7.1  Using Black - Body Radiation 
 Thermal transformations among materials occur at atomic and molecular 
levels and therefore depend on the atomic and molecular structure of the 

LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD  111
material. The wavelengths of photons involved in such transformations fall 
in the nanoscale region (1 – 300  nm), the scale of nanotechnology. Therefore, 
by understanding and using quantum mechanics behind black - body radiation, 
a nanotechnologist can control black - body radiation. In other words, 
nanotechnology offers the promise of producing black - body radiations 
of speciﬁ c wavelength (and hence frequency) rather than a spectrum. In 
the visible light spectrum, this means you can produce just a green or a 
blue black - body radiation. Here are some examples of the perceived 
applications of controlling and manipulating black - body radiation at the 
nanoscale level: 
 1.  Fiber optical communication systems with better efﬁ ciency and 
effectiveness. 
 2.  Better optical signs and displays. 
 3.  Improved lighting techniques. 
 4.  Windows with better radiation control in the visible and invisible (e.g., 
ultra) spectra. 
 So far, scientists have used an approximate black body in the lab because they 
did not have much control on the scale at which black - body radiation occurs. 
The understanding of black - body radiation in terms of quantum mechanics 
has helped nanotechnologists to control radiation and particles on the nano 
scale level. They are working on creating perfect black bodies that reﬂ ect no 
light at all. Such a material is expected to have a wide spectrum of applications 
including more efﬁ cient solar cells, brighter light emitting diodes (LEDs), and 
optical interconnects in computer applications. Such materials will also facili-
tate studying black - body radiations to ﬁ ner details, and therefore testing and 
advancing quantum mechanics. 
 As already mentioned, a perfect black - body material (that reﬂ ects no light 
at all) is considered to be used to increase the efﬁ ciency of solar cells. Solar 
cells themselves are an application of the photoelectric effect explained by 
quantum mechanics. 
 2.7.2  Using the Photoelectric Effect 
 These days, there are lots of activities in the ﬁ eld of alternative energy, that is, 
alternative to using fossil fuels, such as oil. Solar power is a major sector in 
alternative energy and refers to conversion of sunlight into electricity by using 
devices, such as the photovoltaic cell. 
 
 Note :  The ﬁ eld of alternative energy is also known by other names, such as renew-
able energy, and clean technology, and includes solar power, wind power, and 
biofuels. 

112  
PARTICLE BEHAVIOR OF WAVES 
 Before we dive any further into this topic, you need to understand the follow-
ing three terms: 
  •   Photovoltaic Cell.   It is a device that is used to convert light (any light) 
energy into electrical energy by using the photoelectric effect. The term 
photovoltaic has a Greek origin:  phos means light, and  voltaic means 
electrical. 
  •   Solar Cell.   It is any cell, such as a photovoltaic cell, that converts energy 
from sunlight into electrical energy. Note the difference: photovoltaic is 
a more general term; photons can come from anywhere, not just from 
the sun. 
  •   Photovoltaic Panel.   It is a panel that consists of photovoltaic cells con-
nected in series to increase the overall voltage, and hence power output. 
 The following is the physics behind the photovoltaic (photoelectric) process: 
 1.  A photon hits the solar panel. 
 2.  The photon is absorbed by the material, (a semiconductor material, e.g., 
Si) in the panel. 
 3.  The energy of the photon knocks an electron off an atom to make it free 
to ﬂ ow through the material; the atom is ionized. 
 4.  The free electrons ﬂ ow to produce electricity: direct current (dc). 
 5.  The dc, if desired, can be converted into alternating current (ac) by using 
appropriate devices, such as inverters. 
 6.  The ac power enters the utility panel from where it is distributed. 
 An illustration of the photovoltaic effect in a solar cell is presented in 
Figure  2.11 . In this example, the solar cell consists of two types of material: 
p - and  n - type Si. Light of suitable wavelengths ionizes the atom in the material 
(say Si), and as a result positive and negative charges are separated. The posi-
tive charges (called holes) are swept into the positive layer, the P - layer, and 
the negative charges are swept into the negative layer, the N - layer. Due to the 
potential barrier inside the material, these opposite charges, attracted to each 
other, can mostly only combine through an external circuit. In this circuit, the 
free electrons produce power as they pass through a load. 
 A quantity of interest related to the performance of the photovoltaic cell 
is quantum efﬁ ciency,  ε q deﬁ ned as follows:
 εq
e
p
n
n
=
 
where  n p is the number of photons used to produce  n e photoelectrons collected 
to produce the current.

 As you already know from this chapter, the photoelectric effect is a quantum 
phenomenon and the photon itself is a quantum mechanical concept. So, the 
knowledge obtained by quantum physics about the photoelectric effect is at 
the heart of designing photovoltaic cells and improving their performance. 
 2.7.3  Using Compton Scattering 
 After Compton scattering (or Compton effect) was understood in terms of 
quantum mechanics, it became possible to make an effective use of it in several 
applications including the following: 
  •   Radiation Therapy.   Compton scattering is used as an interaction between 
high energy X - rays and atomic nuclei in living organisms. So it has enor-
mous applications in radiobiology, for example, radiation therapy, com-
monly applied to cancerous tumors. In general, radiation therapy works 

114  
PARTICLE BEHAVIOR OF WAVES 
by damaging the DNA of cancer cells by high - energy photons (X - ray); 
however, beams of electrons, protons, neutrons, or ions can also be used. 
The beam of these high - energy particles directly or indirectly ionizes the 
atoms that make up the DNA chain. 
  •   Gamma - Ray Spectroscopy.    Compton scattering, along with the photo-
electric effect, are also applied in gamma - ray spectroscopy, used to 
measure the radiations emitted by radioactive substances. 
  •   Material Physics.   In material physics or chemistry, Compton scattering 
can be used to probe the wave function of the electrons in matter. You 
will learn about wave funtions further on in this book. 
 2.8  SUMMARY 
 Classical physics treats light (or EM radiation) as a wave whose energy is 
distributed over wavefronts and depends on the intensity of light. This classical 
picture was challenged by a number of experimental observations toward the 
end of the twentieth century. The theoretical predictions by classical physics 
could not reproduce the spectral density curves of radiation emitted by a black 
body. These curves were explained by Max Planck by assuming that the radia-
tion is emitted in discrete amounts called light quanta and not in a continuous 
fashion, as predicted by classical physics. Another phenonmenon that was 
challenging classical physics during those days was called the photelectric 
effect, in which electrons are instantly emitted as a result of light incident on 
a metallic surface. The energy of the emitted electrons, called photoelectrons, 
was found to depend only on the frequency (or wavelength) of the incident 
light, and the number of the emitted photoelectrons depended on the intensity 
of the incident light. There was no explanation in the classical picture of light 
for these experimental observations. The explanation came from Albert 
Einstein, which further advanced the quantum picture of light introduced by 
Planck in explaining black - body radiation. According to Einstein ’ s explana-
tion, light consists of quanta, which carry discrete amounts of energy. In the 
photoelectric effect, a photon is completely absorbed by an electron bound to 
an atom, and as a result the electron has enough energy transferred by the 
photon to free itself from the surface on which the light is incident. This 
explains the instant emission of photoelectrons and the fact that the number 
of photoelectrons depended on the intensity of light and also that the energy 
of the photoelectrons depended on the frequency of the light. This is because 
increasing the intensity of light increases the number of photons, the energy 
of the photon depends on the frequency of light, and the interaction is between 
one photon and one electron. 
 Whereas a light quanta is completely absorbed by a bound electron, a free 
electron only absorbs part of the energy of the photon that hits it. As a result, 
the photon scatters with a different energy, and hence different frequency or 
wavelength. This phenomenon is called Compton scattering and was observed 

ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS  115
and explained by Arthur Compton in the early 1920s. This conﬁ rmed the physi-
cal reality of the light quanta introduced by Planck and Einstein, in terms of 
photons, that is, light consists of particles called photons. The existence of 
photons demonstrates the particle behavior of light that is considered a wave 
in classical physics. 
 In a nutshell, classical physics treats waves and particles as two separate 
types of entities reﬂ ecting the physical reality that we experience as macrobe-
ings. However, the physical reality of the macroworld has its roots in the 
microworld of molecules and atoms and subatomic particles. We have seen in 
this chapter that the classical picture of the physical reality collapses in the 
microscopic world where waves can act as particles under certain conditions. 
A natural question to ask here would be Is the reverse true? That is, can par-
ticles exhibit wave behavior? This is the subject of Chapter  3 . 
 2.9  ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS 
 Problem 2.7  Compare and contrast the contributions of black - body radia-
tion and the photoelectric effect to the development of the quantum picture 
of light. 
 Problem 2.8  Argue the accuracy of the following statement: 
 The maximum KE of a photoelectron is proportional to the frequency of the 
absorbed photon. 
 Problem 2.9  Recall that the photoelectric effect is deﬁ ned as the emission 
of an electron after a photon is completely absorbed as a result of one - on - one 
electron – photon interaction. Use this picture and the principles of momentum 
and energy conservation to prove that the photoelectric effect can only happen 
when a photon strikes a bound electron as opposed to a free electron.

in blue light with a wavelength of 470  nm.

tion of 2.75  eV. What is the stopping potential when an incident light of 400  nm 
is used.

voltaic cell. Calculate the number of photons incident on the cell per second.

voltaic cell. Calculate the number of photons incident on the cell per second.

duced by the cell. 
 Problem 2.14  Run an experiment to determine the value of Planck ’ s 
constant and also to determine the work function of a metal surface. First,

illuminate the surface with the light of frequency 1.40  ×  10 15  Hz, which pro-
duces photoelectrons with a maximum kinetic energy of 0.690  eV. Then, illu-
minate the surface with the light of 1.80  ×  10 15  Hz, and observe that the 
maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is 2.34  eV. Using the 
quantum picture of the photoelectric effect, calculate Planck ’ s constant and 
the work function of the metal being used in this experiment.

 Wave – particle duality means that all energy and matter exhibit both wave - and particle -
 like behavior under different circumstances. The same entities exhibit particle - like 
behavior under one set of conditions and a wave - like behavior under another set of 
conditions. This concept, which is central to quantum physics, is a big deviation from 
classical physics, where a given entity is either a particle or a wave. Another way of 
looking at it is that the concepts of particles and waves as deﬁ ned by classical physicists 
to describe the macroworld are inadequate. You can make a case for a missing concept

 3.1  INTRODUCTION 
 The explanation of experimental results from black - body radiation and the 
photoelectric effect, discussed in Chapter  2 , pointed to the particle - like behav-
ior of electromagnetic (EM) waves and perhaps to the fact that EM waves are 
composed of particles. Most scientists at the time of these discoveries took 
these explanations as mathematical tricks more than a physical reality. As you 
saw in Chapter  2 , it took a couple of decades for the reality to set in, with the 
proposal from Compton that EM waves (light) actually consist of particles 
that he called photons. Around that time, believing in the generality, symmetry, 
and universality of the physical law, a graduate student named Louis de Broglie 
took a leap in the reverse direction by presenting the hypothesis that there is 
a wave (or a wave group) associated with each particle. This hypothesis, which 
withstood the experimental scrutiny, led to the particle – wave duality of matter, 
which in turn gave rise to the famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle; a 
cornerstone of modern science. 
 So, the three underlying streams of thought in this chapter are wave pro-
perties of particles, wave – particle duality of matter, and the uncertainty 
principle.  
 3.2  PARTICLES AND WAVES: THE BIG PICTURE 
 All matter is composed of atoms, which in turn are made up of protons, 
neutrons, and electrons: the subatomic particles. Protons and neutrons exist in 
that is neither a particle nor a wave, or a uniﬁ cation of a particle and a wave. Otherwise, 
learn to live with the concept of wave - particle duality. For some of us, this is a good 
enough uniﬁ cation. 
 Physicists and chemists are already comfortable with this concept. For others, espe-
cially a major section of biologist, it may come as news: The wave – particle duality is 
making its way to your research ﬁ eld, get ready. 

PARTICLES AND WAVES: THE BIG PICTURE  119
the nucleus of the atoms, and electrons are conﬁ gured around the nucleus. This 
conﬁ guration along with the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus 
determine the atomic structure and the properties of the atoms and the 
corresponding elements, such as metals and nonmetals. In the classical picture, 
electrons, like protons and neutrons, are considered particles just like light is 
considered a wave. 
 In Chapter  2 , you learned that light, which is classically a wave, could behave 
as particles. A natural question to ask is Could it be that electrons (and other 
particles for that matter) could behave as waves? If yes, what would it mean 
and what are the implications? This chapter is an answer to this question. 
 Table  3.1 is our calendar of some quantum events in chronological order. 
 In this chapter, you will see how the wave nature of particles leads to the 
so - called wave – particle duality, which in turn gives rise to equally surprising

effects, such as quantum conﬁ nement, and uncertainty in measuring certain 
pairs of physical variables simultaneously. 
 3.3  THE DE BROGLIE HYPOTHESIS 
 You learned in Chapter  2 that from 1900 to 1905, Planck and Einstein devel-
oped the quantum picture of light in order to explain black - body radiation 
and the photoelectric effect. The explanations for these experimental observa-
tions suggested that light, which was known to behave like a wave under 
certain circumstances, in these phenomena emitted, carried, and transferred 
energy in discrete amounts called light quanta. One obvious question one 
could have asked is If light carries energy in quanta, could it be that light is 
actually made of quanta: the particles? However, this emerging quantum 
picture was so new and strange at the time that nobody really believed in the 
physical reality of light quanta. In other words, nobody picked up the ball and 
ran with it. It took about two decades to realize that light quanta was real, 
when Arthur Compton observed Compton scattering and explained it in terms 
of photons in 1923. Slowly, the skeptics started to take it seriously that light 
may consist of particles that Compton called photons. 
 At about that time, a physics graduate student at the University of Paris, 
France, named Louis de Broglie, did pick up the ball and run with it. He 
asked a rather bold question: If light, which is considered to be a wave, 
can behave like particles, can particles under certain conditions behave 
like waves? 
 If a particle does behave like a wave, what would its wavelength be? You 
know from Section  1.21 that the energy  E of a particle with rest mass  m 0 and 
momentum  p can be written as:
 
 E
m c
p c
=
+
0

 (3.1) 
 First, let us apply the particle as a wave idea on the photon. For a photon, 
which is massless,  m 0  =  0, this equation becomes:
 
 E

 These equations were known from Plank ’ s and Einstein ’ s work before de 
Broglie came into the picture. In 1924, Louis de Broglie, in his Ph.D. thesis, 
made a bold proposal that Eqs.  3.4 and  3.5 were valid not only for photons, 
which are massless, but also for any material particles, such as electrons. This 
statement has a very serious implication: Equations  3.4 and  3.5 (frequency and 
wavelength), associated with particles suggest that any object or particle 
moving with momentum  p has a wave of wavelength  h / p associated with it. 
The wavelength of such a particle given by Eq.  3.5 is called the de Broglie 
wavelength and Eqs.  3.4 and  3.5 are called the de Broglie relations. 
 
 Alert :  The relationship between the wavelength and momentum of all particles 
massless or massive, such as photons and electrons, is given by the same formula:
 λ = h p
/
 
 Because momentum of a massive particle is given by its mass  m multiplied 
by the velocity  v , Eq.  3.5 for the de Broglie wavelength can also be written for 
a massive particle as:
 
 λ = h
mv  
 (3.6) 
 Generally speaking,  m in Eq.  3.6 is the relativistic mass related to the rest 
mass by

 (3.7) 
 As argued in Chapter  1 , we will assume in this book that  m  =  m 0 ; that is, we 
are working with nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. 
 
 Note :  A careful reader will note from Eq.  3.7 that when the velocity of a particle is 
small compared to the velocity of light, the relativistic mass of the particles is simply 
the rest mass. In many biotechnology and atomic physics applications, that is the 
case, which is the reason you get away with not grappling with relativity in those 
labs. In nuclear physics applications and in particle physics studies, one usually 
needs to include the relativistic correction. 

122  
WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
 Given the extremely small value of  h compared to the mass and velocity of 
the macroobjects in Eq.  3.6 , it is easy to imagine that the de Broglie wavelength 
for macroobjects is too small to be observed in the macroscopic experiments. 
However, given the small value of mass for a microobject, such as an electron, 
the value of the de Broglie wavelength may be signiﬁ cant and detectable in 
the microworld. The rule of thumb is that the wave properties of a particle are 
signiﬁ cant and detectable when the de Broglie wavelength is comparable with 
the dimensions of the particle itself or of the things it interacts with. Problem 
 3.1 illustrates this point. The wavelength associated with the soccerball in this 
problem, for example, is much smaller than any aperture or obstacle in the 
macroworld that wave effects, such as diffraction and interference, cannot be 
detected or observed. 
 PROBLEM 3.1 
 A.  Find the de Broglie wavelength of a soccerball of mass 430  g that is moving with 
a speed of 25  m/s. 
 B.  Find the de Broglie wavelength of an electron that is moving in a particle accel-
erator with a speed of 3.00  ×  10 7  m/s. 
 Solution: 
 Because the speed in both cases is much smaller than the speed of light, we are 
going to treat these situations as nonrelativistic.

 This wavelength is not comparable to the dimensions of macroobjects, but is com-
parable to atoms of which electrons are the part. For example, the radius of the 
hydrogen atom is  ∼ 0.53  Å . 

THE DE BROGLIE HYPOTHESIS  123
 As an example in the microscopic world, consider an electron moving in a 
potential difference  V with a momentum  p and with mass  m . Its kinetic energy 
and wavelength is given by the following equations:

where  e is the electron charge. 
 By comparing Eqs.  3.8 and  3.9 , we obtain

 Louis de Broglie (1892 – 1987) 
 Louis de Broglie was born in Dieppe, France 
on August 16, 1892. After studying history, he 
pursued his interest in mathematics and 
physics. In 1924, while studying at the 
University of Paris, de Broglie, in his Ph.D. 
thesis, proposed that each material object has 
a wave associated with it. In other words, 
each material object has a wave behavior 
that complements its particle behavior. His 
hypothesis was positively tested in 1927, and 
he received the Nobel Prize for this in 1929. 
 De Broglie spent most of his life in 
France, teaching and performing research in 
physics. He passed away on March 19, 1987 
at the age of 94. 
 

MEASURING THE WAVELENGTH OF ELECTRONS  125
 Whereas, Planck, Einstein, and Compton proposed their quantum hypoth-
eses in order to explain experimental observations, de Broglie ’ s hypothesis 
was speculative and no direct experimental evidence was present for its valid-
ity at the time. But to be accepted in science, a theoretical idea or hypothesis 
must face the test of experiments; that is where rubber meets the road. The 
ﬁ rst experiment conﬁ rming de Broglie ’ s hypothesis by detecting and measur-
ing the wavelength of an electron was conducted in 1927 by Davisson and 
Germer.  
 3.4  MEASURING THE WAVELENGTH OF ELECTRONS 
 You know from Chapter  1 that waves exhibit a phenomenon called diffraction, 
which has no analogue in the behavior of classical (or Newtonian) particles. 
One way of proving that a particle like an electron has a wave associated with 
it will be to demonstrate that electrons exhibit diffraction. That is exactly what 
Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer demonstrated in 1927 at Bell Labs in 
the United States. The original goal of their experiment, however, was not to 
test the electron waves of the de Broglie hypothesis. They were just studying 
the scattering of electrons from a metal surface, for example, measuring the 
energies of the scattered electrons, by using the experimental setup illustrated 
in Figure  3.1 . In this setup, electrons from a heated ﬁ lament are accelerated 
under an applied voltage before hitting a Ni block, the target specimen. The 
electron detector was mounted on an arc so that it could be rotated to detect 
the scattered electrons at different angles. 
 Davisson and Germer collected the data by varying the following 
parameters: 
  •   The energy of the electron beam incident on the nickel (Ni) metal surface, 
called the primary beam. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 3.1 
 According to the de Broglie hypothesis, which of the following exhibits wave 
characteristics? 
 A.  Electrons only. 
 B.  Photons only. 
 C.  Tiny particles only. 
 D.  Any matter. 
 Solution: 
 D 

126  
WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
  •   The angle of the incident electrons with the target metal surface. 
  •   The position of the electron detector. 
 The data was found to be in agreement with what was expected from clas-
sical physics. For example, they observed that the electrons were scattering in 
all directions and that the intensity of the scattered electrons only had a mod-
erate dependence on the scattering angle; the intensity variation with angle 
was continuous, as predicted by classical mechanics. Furthermore, the energy 
of the primary electrons did not have much inﬂ uence on the intensity spectrum 
of the scattered electrons. Everything was going as predicted by classical 
physics until an accident happened. 
 The experimenters noticed that the target Ni surface was oxidized by the 
air that accidentally entered into the apparatus. To reduce the target back to 
a pure metal, they simply baked it in an oven. After this operation, the target 
was moved back into the experimental setup and the experiment resumed to 
collect more data. 
 To their surprise, the results were dramatically different in this experi-
mental run. Instead of continuous variation of electron intensity, they 
observed an intensity peak at certain scattering angles and intensity minima 
at others. There were clear distinct intensity maxima and minima whose 
positions were dependent on the energy of the incident electron beam. 
In order to explain these results, there were three dots that they needed 
to connect:

  •   These results only appeared after the target was heated. They thought it 
through and realized that upon heating the Ni target could behave like a 
large crystal whose atoms are arranged in a regular lattice. 
  •   The diffraction of X - ray waves from crystals, discussed in Chapter  2 , was 
known at that time and the diffraction pattern obtained from this experi-
ment looked very similar to that obtained from Bragg ’ s X - ray diffraction 
experiment. 
  •   In light of the de Broglie hypothesis, particles, such as electrons, 
could exhibit wave behavior (e.g., diffraction), as the de Broglie wave-
length had the same size scale as the separation of Ni atoms on the 
crystal lattice. 
 Davisson and Germer were able to connect these dots and conclude that 
what they were looking at was nothing less than the ﬁ rst evidence of electron 
waves, the conﬁ rmation of the de Broglie hypothesis. Let us work out a simple 
example to verify how the data collected by Davisson and Germer was in 
agreement with the prediction of the de Broglie hypothesis and Bragg ’ s dif-
fraction law. According to one data record, an intensity peak was obtained for 
an electron beam with energy  E  =  54.0  eV at an angle of 50 ° with the incident 
electron beam, which was equivalent to an angle of 65 ° made by the incident 
beam with the Bragg ’ s plane of the Ni crystal. The spacing between two adja-
cent planes of the Ni crystal was measured by X - ray diffraction and was found 
to be 0.091  nm. If we assume that the incident electron was a wave, we can 
calculate the corresponding wavelength by using Bragg ’ s law:
 n
d

 This value is in agreement with that calculated from Bragg ’ s law, that is, the 
experimental data is consistent with predictions from Bragg ’ s law of diffrac-
tion and the de Broglie hypothesis of the electron wave demonstrating that 
electrons are exhibiting wave behavior in this experiment in accordance with 
the de Broglie hypothesis. 
 

128  
WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
 Following the Davisson – Germer experiment, particle waves, also called 
material waves, have been observed for other material entities, such as 
neutrons, protons, and atoms, as well. Particle diffraction is now a very useful 
technique to study different structures. For example, Figure  3.2 presents 
the electron diffraction pattern obtained by striking gold (Au) atoms 
with the electron beam. Diffraction rings represent the constructive and 
destructive interference of electron waves from different planes of atoms. 
Such a pattern can be analyzed to study the structure of the specimen 
material. 
 PROBLEM 3.3 
 In the Davisson – Germer experiment, an intensity peak of scattered electrons was 
observed for an electron beam of energy 54.0  eV that was incident at an angle of

QUANTUM CONFINEMENT  129

 To summarize, the detection or the size of the effect of a particle wave 
depends on several factors, such as mass and speed of the particle. Nevertheless, 
each particle (or object) in the universe, large or small, has a wave associated 
with it. The wave nature of a moving particle gives rise to some very interesting 
characteristics when the particle is restricted to a certain region in space, a 
phenomenon called quantum conﬁ nement. 
 3.5  QUANTUM CONFINEMENT 
 Quantum conﬁ nement is the restriction on the motion of a particle in one or 
more dimensions within the scale in which quantum characteristics become 
important. It is an interesting effect that has signiﬁ cant, useful, and practical 
implications. Here, as an application of de Broglie hypothesis, we explore a 
simple situation of a conﬁ ned particle by applying a rudimentary mathematical 
treatment. Although the spatial conﬁ nement can happen in all three dimen-
sions, the simplest case is the conﬁ nement in one dimension (1D) that we 
explore here as an illustration. This effect will be treated in more detail in the 
forthcoming chapters. 
 As demonstrated in Figure  3.3 , consider a point particle enclosed in a 1D 
box in which it experiences no force. One dimensional means that the particle 
exists on a line segment with the walls of the box as the two endpoints of the

line. Each time it hits the wall, it reﬂ ects back without losing any energy. 
Assume the length of the line segment to be  L .

particle within a space beyond which the potential is inﬁ nite. As a result of the 
inﬁ nite outside potential, the particle will stay conﬁ ned to the space in which it is 
at the present time. Think of atoms in a crystal lattice, electrons in an atom, and 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules in a cell. Conﬁ nement is everywhere in 
chemical and biological objects and phenomena. 
 In classical mechanics, this situation has a trivial explanation or solution: 
The conﬁ ned particle behaves like a classical particle, and therefore moves 
according to Newton ’ s laws of motion. For example, it moves in a straight line 
with a constant speed, until it scatters back from the wall that it hits, assuming 
elastic collisions. Also, it can assume any value of kinetic energy within the 
acceptable range. This may make sence for big balls in big boxes. Now, given 
the size of the particle, imagine shrinking the box so that the wavelength 
associated with the particle in the box is on the order of the same size as the 
length of the box. Now, we are talking about a quantum mechanical 
situation. 
 The particle wave must have a node at the boundary (wall) of the box 
because the probability of ﬁ nding the particle there is approaching zero. A 

QUANTUM CONFINEMENT  131
node is a point along the wave where it has minimal amplitude, and the ampli-
tude represents the probability of ﬁ nding the particle. Figure  3.3  illustrates the 
particle in a box and the wave associated with the particle for a different 
number of nodes. As mentioned earlier, the particle wave must have a node 
at the boundary (wall) of the box because the probability of ﬁ nding the par-
ticle there is approaching zero. The implication of this statement is that at a 
minimum, the half - integer wavelengths must ﬁ t into the box. Mathematically, 
it can be expressed as:
 
 L
n
=
λ

 (3.12) 
 The same equation can be derived from Bragg ’ s law:
 n

= 2 sin
 
 You can consider the two walls of the box as two Bragg ’ s planes from which 
two waves are being reﬂ ected. Given that the particles are in the box, we can 
assume constructive interference between these waves. Furthermore, given 
 θ  =  90 ° and  d  =  L , Bragg ’ s law becomes:
 n

λ = 2
 
which implies

 The momentum and energy of the conﬁ ned particle can be derived by 
applying the de Broglie hypothesis to Eq.  3.12 . By using the de Broglie rela-
tion,  p  =  h /  λ , you can derive from Eq.  3.12 :

where  E n is the energy of the conﬁ ned particle. Each energy value corre-
sponding to an integer  n permitted by Eq.  3.13 is called an energy level, 
and the integer  n is called the quantum number corresponding to the energy 
level.

WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
 As shown in Study Checkpoint  3.2 ,  n  =  0 is not an acceptable situation. For 
a very large value of  n , you can realize from Figure  3.3 that the probability 
maxima of ﬁ nding the particle will be so closely packed that the particle could 
be found anywhere in the box. Therefore, we are back to the classical world. 
 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 3.3 
 Why can the value of  n in Eq.  3.13 not be zero? 
 Solution: 
 To have  n  =  0 is not acceptable because it means from Eq.  3.12 that the length of 
the box is zero, that is, the box does not exist. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 3.2 
 In Figure  3.3 , what represents the probability of ﬁ nding a particle at a speciﬁ c point 
in the box? 
 Solution: 
 The amplitude of the particle wave at that point. 
 Alert :  From our argument that the particle waves must have nodes at the walls of 
the box, you should realize that  n is a positive integer. 
 Equation  3.13 has the following three implications: 
 1.  A conﬁ ned particle can only have certain speciﬁ c energies and no others, 
that can be calculated from Eq.  3.13 corresponding to  n  =  1, 2, 3,  … . This 
is called energy quantization. 
 2.  Since  n is a positive integer to keep the situation real, the conﬁ ned par-
ticle cannot have a zero energy. 
 3.  Given the extremely small value of Planck ’ s constant,  h , the energy 
quantization becomes conspicuous only when the mass of the particle, 
 m , and the size of the conﬁ nement,  L , is small enough, that is, in the same 
ballpark as  h . 
 
 Note :   Energy quantization and exclusion of zero energy for a conﬁ ned particle have 
no counterparts or analogues in classical physics. This is an example of how new 
characteristics and properties of materials and systems are invoked at the nanoscale 
level, which is the scale of nanotechnology. 

THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE  133
 To summarize, a conﬁ ned particle can only have discrete values of energy. 
In other words, the quantum conﬁ nement hypothesis forces the conﬁ ned par-
ticles to exist in a certain set of discrete states. There is no such concept in 
classical physics, where a particle can have any energy or any state; that is, the 
behavior of the particle is continuous. As mentioned earlier, since  n cannot be 
zero for a realistic situation, the zero energy for a trapped particle is not 
allowed. This zero - point energy issue can also be explained in terms of the 
uncertainty principle, the most famous and often misinterpreted aspect of 
quantum mechanics. 
 3.6  THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE 
 The physical observables used to study a particle or deﬁ ne its state, such as 
position, momentum, and energy, used in classical physics are also relevant in 
quantum physics. The principle of uncertainty states that there are a number 
of pairs of observables such that both observables in a pair cannot be simul-
taneously determined accurately. One such pair is the position  x and momen-
tum  p of the particle. 
 The uncertainty principle, postulated by Heisenberg in 1927, can be under-
stood as a natural consequence of the de Broglie hypothesis that each particle 
has a wave associated with it. First, let us ask a question As compared to waves 
known in classical physics, such as sound and EM waves, what really is this 
particle wave? 
 3.6.1  Understanding Particle Waves 
 You know from Chapter  1 that a wave is a disturbance that carries some 
kind of energy with it and travels through space and time. The disturbance 
is deﬁ ned by something that changes as the wave travels. For example, 
the changing (or varying) parameters are the height of the water surface in 
a water wave, the air pressure in a sound wave, and EM ﬁ eld (electric and 
magnetic ﬁ elds) in an EM wave. So, an obvious question that you can ask 
is What is the varying parameter in a matter (particle) wave, such as an 
electron wave? 
 As we know from the de Broglie hypothesis, a matter wave or the waveg-
roup represents a particle, and the particle exists somewhere within the waveg-
roup. That means each point in the wavegroup has a probability assigned to it 
for the existence of the particle. So, obviously the matter waves are the prob-
ability waves: The varying parameter is the probability of ﬁ nding the particle 
represented by the wave function, the varying amplitude of the wave. To be 
precise, the square of the absolute value of the wave function, |  ψ | 2 , is called 
the probability density. The large value of probability density at a given point 
means the odds of ﬁ nding the particle at the point are great, and a small value 
means the odds of ﬁ nding the particle there are low. 
 

134  
WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
 So, a de Broglie wave associated with a particle is a wavegroup or wave-
packet. The basic concept of a wavegroup is discussed in Chapter  1 . Because 
the wavegroup represents the particle, it is trivial to realize that the group 
velocity,  v g , with which the wavegroup travels, is also the velocity of the particle 
that the wavegroup represents. Two other important parameters of a waveg-
roup are the length of the wavegroup,   Δ x , and its wavenumber,  κ  ≈  2 π / λ . 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 3.4 
 A.  True or False : According to the uncertainty principle, you cannot make a precise 
measurement at the microscale level.  
 B.  True or False : According to the uncertainty principle, it is not possible to 
measure the position or momentum of a particle precisely. 
 Solution: 
 A.  False 
 B.  False 
 Alert :  The probability of ﬁ nding an object at a point in space and time is pro-
portional to |  ψ | 2 , where   ψ is the wave function at that point of the wave associated 
with the object. Although you can look at   ψ as the spectrum or spread of the prob-
abilities of ﬁ nding the particle at different places and times, it does not mean that 
the particle itself is spread out. Once an experiment is performed to detect the 
particle at a given point in space and time, either the whole particle is found or 
it is not. 
 As explained in Chapter  1 ,  Δ x and  Δ κ are related to each other by the 
minimum value of their product:
 Δ Δ
x k = 2π  
 It turns out that the minimum value of their product goes even smaller, that 
is,  ½ when the wavegroup has a Gaussian shape. Therefore, in general:
 
 Δ Δ
x κ ≥1
2  
 (3.14) 
 Gaussian wavepackets are often used to represent the position of particles 
as the integrals associated to them are rather easier to solve.

 3.6.2  Understanding the Uncertainty Principle 
 It is important to realize that uncertainty is the price you pay for assigning a 
wave to a particle. In other words, the uncertainty is built - in as we assign a 
wave to a moving particle because the wave (or wavegroup) represents the 
probability distribution of ﬁ nding the particle anywhere within the wave: No 
more certainty of the classical approach. A wide wavegroup will have a less 
precisely speciﬁ ed particle position, but a more precisely deﬁ ned wavelength, 
and therefore momentum. On an extreme, as illustrated in Figure  3.4 a , a sine

THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE  137
wave of a well - deﬁ ned wavelength  λ has a precisely known momentum, 
 p  =  h / λ . But where is the particle? The particle is somewhere in the wave, but 
we cannot say at a given time exactly where within the wave the particle can 
be found. 
 The reverse is also true. As illustrated in Figure  3.4 b , interference of several 
waves of different wavelengths gives rise to a localized wave pattern, a waveg-
roup. The narrower the wavegroup, the more precisely the particle ’ s position 
within the wavegroup can be speciﬁ ed. However, because now the wavegroup 
is composed of many different wavelengths and because it is only a few wave-
lengths long, it ’ s wavelength cannot be known precisely. As a result, the prob-
able momentum values  p  =  h /  λ , are spread out all over; that is, momentum is 
more uncertain. 
 So, you see, it is impossible to simultaneously know the exact position 
and exact momentum of a particle or object. Welcome to the uncertainty 
principle. 
 We can derive a more quantitative deﬁ nition of the uncertainty principle. 
Recall that the de Broglie wavelength,   λ , and the corresponding wavenumber, 
 κ , can be written as:

 Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976) 
 Werner Heisenberg was born on December 
5, 1901 in Wurzburg, Germany. He studied 
physics at the University of Munich, 
Germany. Along with others, he developed 
the theory of quantum mechanics based on 
the Matrix formulation. Heisenberg is best 
known for his uncertainty principle, 
popularly known as the Heisenberg ’ s 
uncertainty principle, which he developed in 
1927 while working at Bohr ’ s Institute in 
Copenhagen. 
 Heisenberg received the Nobel Prize in 
physics in 1932 for his contributions to 
developing quantum mechanics. He spent his 
entire career in physics in Germany. 
Heisenberg died of cancer of the kidneys and 
gall bladder on February 1, 1976. 
 So, we have arrived at the principle of uncertainty from the wave picture 
of a particle. You can ask a question Can we realize the uncertainty principle 
from the particle behavior of a wave? The answer is yes. Here we go. Assume 
we want to measure the position and momentum of a particle. In order to 
measure any property of any object we interact with it. In this case, for 
example, we can shine light on the particle to  “ see ” where it is and by knowing 
the incident and the scattered photons (of light), we can determine its momen-
tum. However, you know from Compton scattering, the moment when the 
ﬁ rst photon hits the particle, the particle ’ s momentum is going to change. 
This change in the particle momentum,   Δ p , cannot be precisely predicted, but 
it will be on the order of the momentum of the photon that hits the particle, 

THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE  139
which is given by the de Broglie relation,  p  =  h / λ , where  λ is the wavelength 
of the photon:
 Δp
h
≈λ  
 This equation implies that the longer the wavelength of the probing photon, 
the smaller the uncertainty in the particle ’ s momentum. However, the increase 
in wavelength also increases the uncertainty in the particle ’ s position,   Δ x , 
which can be reasonably estimated to
 Δx ≥λ / 2  
which implies
 
Δ Δ

which is the uncertainty principle. However, this line of argument is sometimes 
stretched to jump to a misleading and wrong conclusion: It is possible for a 
particle to have precise position and momentum simultaneously; it is just the 
measurement process that introduces uncertainty. In other words, the wrong 
conclusion or claim is At any given instant, the precise position and momen-
tum of a particle exists simultaneously; it is just that we cannot measure it. Yes, 
the measurement process does change the observables, however, the uncer-
tainty in simultaneously measuring a pair of observables, such as position and 
momentum, is inherent in the nature of the particle; the wave – particle duality, 
an entity can act as both a wave and as a particle. 
 PROBLEM 3.5

 Position and momentum is one pair of observables whose members cannot 
be accurately measured simultaneously. There are other pairs of observable 
whose measurement is subject to the uncertainty principle. 
 3.6.3  Another Form of the Uncertainty Principle 
 Energy and time have the same relationship as momentum and space. Under 
this assumption, the uncertainty principle can be rewritten in terms of the 
uncertainty of the emitted energy,   Δ E , during the time interval   Δ t :
 Δ
Δ
E

2  
 The time interval   Δ t represents the uncertainty in time at which the energy 
measurement is made. Presented here is a crude derivation of this principle. 
Assume that the energy,  E , that we are trying to measure in an interval   Δ t is 
in the form of waves of frequency  f . It takes time to measure the frequency, 
which is the number of wave cycles divided by time. Assuming that the 
minimum uncertainty in counting the wave cycles is one wave cycle, we can 
write the corresponding frequency uncertainty as:
 
 Δ

which implies

 (3.16) 
where   Δ E is the uncertainty in measuring energy and   Δ t is the uncertainty in 
the time at which the measurement is made. It means it takes longer to accu-
rately measure the frequency, and hence the energy. 
 There are two important things to note about these uncertainties. First, the 
uncertainties lie in the simultaneous measurements; that is, we can measure 
one quantity, say momentum, very precisely if we do not care about the posi-
tion. Second, these uncertainties are not due to inadequate experimental appa-
ratus, but are inherent due to the imprecise character of the physical quantities. 
Of course, the experimental errors will add to the overall uncertainties in the 
measurements. In a nutshell, the uncertainty principle has its roots in the 
wave – particle duality, discussed next. 
 3.7  WAVE - PARTICLE DUALITY OF NATURE 
 In Chapter  2 , you learned how the quantum picture attributes particle proper-
ties to light, which is considered a wave in classical physics. In this chapter, you 
saw how the quantum picture attributes wave properties to material objects, 
such as electrons, which are considered particles in classical physics. So, what 
is going on here? 
 In other words, by now you might have begun struggling with two 
questions: 

142  
WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
 1.  Is EM radiation really a wave or a particle? If it is made of photons, does 
it mean it is not a wave any longer? 
 2.  Is an electron really a particle or a wave? 
 Here is the answer: EM radiations and electrons are both waves and particles 
or they are neither just waves nor just particles. In other words, the particle 
and wave pictures are complements of each other. Whether an entity, such as 
a radiation (light) or electron, will behave as a wave or a particle depends on 
what it is put through. For example, the particle picture explains Compton 
effect and the wave picture explains electron diffraction. In general, all matter 
and radiation, that is all entities, exhibits both particle - and wave - like behavior. 
This is called the wave – particle duality of nature. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 3.5 
 The waves of matter are 
 A.  Pressure waves. 
 B.  Electromagnetic waves. 
 C.  Probability waves. 
 D.  Mass waves. 
 Solution: 
 C Probability waves. 
 Scientists originally developed the concepts of particles and waves sepa-
rately within the classical framework: Some things are particles and some 
other things are waves, and they stay that way under all methods of observing 
them. As a matter of fact, the classical framework does not recognize that the 
observation (measurement) can change the behavior of the observed and what 
you will measure is the changed behavior. Quantum mechanics exposes the 
inadequacy of each of these classical concepts in fully describing the behavior 
of physical entities or objects. Each particle and wave picture is therefore only 
part of the whole picture and can only explain certain effects. For example, in 
the classical picture, energy and momentum are the parameters that describe 
the dynamics of a particle, and frequency and wavelength are the deﬁ ning 
parameters of a wave. Demonstrating the duality, quantum picture, as you have 
already seen, binds these particle parameters with the wave parameter through 
the following relationships:
 E
hf
=
 
 p
h
= λ
 

LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD  143
 So, physical entities are simultaneously waves and particles and they exhibit 
one or both of these behaviors depending on what we do to them. As you 
learned in Chapter  1 , even in the classical picture, one thing common to both 
particles and waves is energy. Both matter and radiation carry energy. Wave –
 particle duality is an integral part of the quantum theory for all forms of 
energy. 
 The wave – particle duality is used in electron microscopy, where the small 
wavelengths associated with the electron are used to view objects of size much 
smaller than what is visible by using microscopes based on visible light. 
 3.8  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 Quantum mechanical effects are prominent at the nanoscale level and are 
essentially used in studying and building nanostructures. For example, wave –
 particle duality is used in microscopy and diffraction in order to study the 
nanostructures. 
 
 Note :  Nanostructure is the structure that reveals details at the nanoscale, which is 
the scale of size typically in the range of 0.1 – 100  nm. 
 3.8.1  Seeing the Nanoworld with Electron Waves 
 We, human, are macrobeings and can only see the macroworld with our naked 
eyes. To see the micro (nano included) - world, we need the help of the science 
of the microworld: quantum physics. This is how we see things: Light waves 
(rays) reﬂ ected from an object brings the information about the object to our 
eyes. To see the object clearly, your eye must be able to distinguish the object 
from its surroundings, a characteristic called resolution. The approximate reso-
lution of the human eye is  ∼ 0.05  mm; that is, an object of 0.1  mm size is the 
smallest object the naked eye can see from a distance of  ∼ 25  cm. This also 
means that the naked eye can see two objects separately (distinguish them 
from each other) if they are at a minimum of 0.1 - mm apart, which is 100  μ m), 
and 100,000  nm, far from the nanoscale. This minimum size that we can see 
can carry about 1 million atoms in it that we cannot see apart from each other. 
 We can see things the size of a few microns with the help of a light micro-
scope, which uses light just like our eyes do, but magniﬁ es the image of the 
object for us to see. That is how biologists see bacteria and cells in the lab. For 
example, you can see some details of the cells of an organism by using a light 
microscope, which are a few microns in size. The resolving power,  P R , of an 
optical (light) microscope is given by

144  
WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
where   λ is the wavelength of light used in the microscope, and  N A is the 
numerical aperture of the microscope ’ s objective lens. The numerical aperture 
depends on the refractive index  n of the medium in which the lens is working 
and the angle   θ of the maximum cone of light that can enter or exit the lens:
 N
n
A =
sinθ  
 As a typical example, suppose the numerical aperture of the objective lens of 
your light microscope is 1.25. The average wavelength of white light is  ∼ 500  nm. 
What is the minimum size of a particle that you can see with this microscope 
as a clear and distinct particle?

 So, the average resolving power of this light microscope is  ∼ 0.200  μ m, which is 
200  nm. Therefore, on average, the smallest size of a particle that can be clearly 
and distinctively seen with this microscope is  ∼ 0.200  μ m. 
 
 Alert :  Distinguish between two related but different concepts: magniﬁ cation and 
resolution. Magniﬁ cation is the factor by which the image of an object is enlarged 
as compared to the object size, whereas resolution is the smallest size of the object 
that can be distinguished from its surrounding material. Resolution is related to 
how much detail of the structure can be seen. 
 This means that the optical microscopes using visible light are not powerful 
enough to help you see the molecules, which are of nanosize. Therefore, to 
observe nanostructures, you need to use electron microscopes, which use a 
beam of electrons instead of a beam of photons (light), to generate an image 
of the target specimen. Because electrons typically have more momentum than 
photons of visible light, their de Broglie wavelength (  λ  =  E / p ) will be smaller, 
resulting in a greater spatial resolution. 
 In this chapter, you learned that an electron can behave like a wave with a 
wavelength given by the following formula:

 Compare this wavelength of 0.005  nm to 200  nm, the maximum theoretical 
resolution of an optical microscope, and you will realize that electrons can 
probe way deeper into the structure of matter to probe ﬁ ner details. Figure

electron microscope (SEM). It shows the details, such as red blood cells, white 
blood cells, and small disc - shaped platelets. Platelets are tiny cells formed in 
bone marrow and are necessary for blood clotting. 
 The invention of SEM in 1981, based on the wave – particle duality, was a 
milestone in the development of the ﬁ eld called nanotechnology. In this 
chapter, you also explored how particles can exhibit diffraction, a wave prop-
erty. The diffraction of particle waves is also used in studying nanostructures.

WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
diffraction has been frequently used to study ordered structures, such as 
crystals, where you can get constructive and destructive interference. Electron 
diffraction is a technique used to study the structure of matter by hitting a 
sample with electrons and observing the resulting interference pattern. From 
this chapter, you already know that it was an electron diffraction experiment 
that conﬁ rmed the validity of the de Broglie hypothesis. 
 Currently, more precise instruments, such as transmission electron micro-
scope (TEM) are used to exploit electron diffraction for studying structures 
at the nanoscale level. The basic idea is that the electrons transmitting through 
the specimen will be scattered by the constituent particles of the specimen, 
and the scattering will expose the internal pattern (or nanostructure) of the 
specimen, which will be captured in an image. The imaging process used in a 
TEM is described in the following: 
 1.  A source, such as an electron gun, generates a beam of electrons. 
 2.  By using EM ﬁ eld, the electron beam is accelerated and focused to the 
target specimen. 
 3.  The incident electrons are scattered by the internal structure of the speci-
men as they transmit through the specimen. 
 4.  The scattered electrons, after they transmit through the specimen, are 
focused by objective lens and ampliﬁ ed by a magnifying lens to generate 
an enlarged image of the specimen ’ s structure. 
 5.  The image strikes a phosphor screen, which generates light, which in turn 
enables a user to see the image.

SUMMARY  147
 3.8.3  Using Atomic Waves to Navigate Your Way 
 In Chapter  1 , you learned about the interference of light waves that produce 
a pattern of black and white strips: White strips correspond to the areas where 
the interfering waves line up and add to each other, whereas black strips cor-
respond to the areas where the interfering waves cancel out. Interference 
pattern can be used to calculate the difference in the distance traveled by each 
of the interference waves. This difference of distance can be measured more 
precisely by using the waves of an atom because their wavelength is much 
smaller than the typical wavelength of light. The navigation systems based on 
atomic interferometry are being designed, built, and tested. Such systems 
facilitate navigation by measuring the rotation of the Earth and are intended 
to be used both for land navigation and in airplanes, and may improve or 
replace global positioning systems (GPS). 
 Atomic interferometry is also intended to be used for making accurate 
measurements of some physical constants, for example, those constants that 
represent the strength of natural forces, such as gravity and EM forces. 
 3.9  SUMMARY 
 The three big takeaway lessons from this chapter are the following: 
 1.  All material objects have a wave associated with them, that is, they can 
exhibit wave - like properties, such as diffraction. This leads to the wave –
 particle duality of matter. 
 2.  One implication of the wave particle duality is quantum conﬁ nement: A 
particle whose motion has been restricted in one or more spatial dimen-
sions only has discrete values of energy. 
 3.  According to Heisenberg ’ s uncertainty principle, there is an unavoidable 
uncertainty in simultaneously measuring both variables of certain pairs 
of variables, such as position and momentum of a moving particle. 
 Classical physics treats waves and particles separate from each other; two 
different kinds of entities. A given entity is either a particle or a wave. For 
example, light and sound are waves, and a marble and a ball are particles 
(objects). This classical picture of physical reality perceived in the macroworld 
breaks down in the microscopic world in which the physical reality of the 
macroworld has its roots. Black - body radiation and the photoelectric effect 
helped to realize the particle nature of light that was considered a wave in 
classical physics. Arthur de Broglie realized that the reverse could be true as 
well: Particles, such as electrons, could behave as waves just like waves, such 
as light, could behave like particles. The de Broglie hypothesis led to the wave –
 particle duality of nature. 
 Light or EM radiation are waves because under certain circumstances it 
exhibits phenomena, such as diffraction and interference. Electromagnetic 

148  
WAVE BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES
radiations are also particles because under other circumstances it exhibits the 
characteristics that we associate with particles. In the same fashion, particles, 
such as electrons, also behave as both particles and waves under suitable cir-
cumstances. This wave – particle duality erases the line between particles and 
waves drawn by classical physics. 
 Quantum conﬁ nement and the uncertainty principle, two salient features 
of quantum mechanics, have their roots in wave – particle duality. Quantum 
conﬁ nement means that a particle whose motion has been restricted in one or 
more spatial dimensions only has discrete values of energy. The uncertainty 
principle states that there is an unavoidable uncertainty in simultaneously 
measuring both variables of certain pairs of variables, such as position and 
momentum of a moving particle. 
 Electrons in an atom are an example of a conﬁ ned particles. This conﬁ ne-
ment deﬁ nes the structure of atoms explored next in Chapter  4 .

 4.1  INTRODUCTION 
 Ancient Greek philosophers, as early as 400 BC, proposed that all matter was 
composed of some fundamental constituents, which they called atoms. Based 
on these ideas, an English chemist John Dalton presented his atomic theory 
of the chemical elements in 1808. The suggestions that atoms themselves were 
not fundamental (indivisible) came as early as 1820 from experiments reveal-
ing that atoms consist of smaller particles: the subatomic particles. By the late 
nineteenth century, scientists had discovered that all matter was made of 
(chemical) elements, which in turn were composed of atoms, and atoms might 
have structure too. But at that time they did not know much about the atom 
itself, such as its internal structure and dynamics. The study of the structure of 
an atom has been crucial for the development of chemistry because atomic 
structure plays a signiﬁ cant role in determining the properties of the chemical 
elements. Later, the subatomic particles that compose atoms were discovered 
to be electrons, protons, and neutrons. Various experiments also revealed the 
structure of the atom: An atom is a stable self - contained entity comprised of 
protons and neutrons in its nucleus, which is surrounded by a cloud of elec-
trons that exactly match the number of protons in the nucleus. 
 Whereas classical physics failed to explain experimental observations, 
quantum theory, which was in its infancy at the time, thrived on these experi-
ments by successfully explaining their ﬁ ndings. 
 So, the three underlying streams of thought in this chapter are the atomic 
theory of elements, the classical theory of atomic structure, and the quantum 
theory of atomic structure. 
 
 Note :  By now, the scientists know that protons and neutrons that make up the 
nucleus of an atom also have structures, and they are made up of even smaller 
particles called quarks. This level of the study of matter is important for the advance-
ment of physics.

ANATOMY OF AN ATOM
 4.2  QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOM: THE BIG PICTURE 
 A physicist ’ s probe of matter goes as deep as possible in the search for the 
fundamental constituents of matter: from the universe to an atom, to protons 
and neutrons, to quarks, and beyond. A biologist is interested in studing living 
matter to the details of a molecular level because that is where life begins its 
activities in terms of molecules of life, such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), 
proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. A chemist is interested in studying matter 
at the molecular and atomic levels. 
 All matter is made up of a ﬁ nite number of elements. Each element consists 
of unique atoms that are different from any other element. These unique 
atoms exhibit (or reveal) their structure in the spectrum of light (electromag-
netic, EM, radiation) that they emit and absorb. You learned about black - body 
radiation in Chapter  2 . In addition to measuring the spectra of black - body 
radiation, experimental physicists at that time were also familiar with the 
spectra emitted by gases. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, it was 
discovered that when an atomic gas was heated by passing an electric current 
through it, it emited a spectrum of radiation corresponding to only certain 
speciﬁ c wavelengths. Such a spectrum is called a line spectrum. Figure  4.1 
presents such spectra for a few elements: hydrogen (H 2 ), helium (H e ), mercury 
(H g ), and neon (N e ). 
 It was also discovered that each element produced its own unique line 
spectrum. Classical physics had no explanation for this behavior. These line 
spectra were trying to tell us something about the structure of atoms, which 
was eventually understood through the quantum mechanical model of atomic 
structure. The journey to get there begins from Dalton ’ s atomic theory and 
goes through the Thomson, the Rutherford, and the Bohr models.

DALTON’S ATOMIC THEORY  153
 4.3  DALTON ’ S ATOMIC THEORY 
 In a chemical reaction, one set of chemical substances is converted into 
another set of chemical substances. It turns out that these reactions occur 
at the atomic level, and Dalton ’ s atomic theory accounts well for chemical 
reactions. Before Dalton proposed his atomic theory, chemists knew the 
following two principles: 
 1.  Law of Conservation of Mass.    Total mass involved in a chemical reaction 
is conserved; it is neither created nor destroyed. This means
 Total mass of products
Total mass of reactants
=
 
 In other words, it means that each atom and its type, which element it 
belongs to, remain intact. The atoms only change their bonds with other 
atoms: Old bonds are broken and new bonds are made. 
 2.  Law of Deﬁ nite Proportion.   The percentage by mass of each element in 
a compound is always the same regardless of its source: It is part of the 
identity of the compound. For example, pure water always contains 11.1  g 
of H 2 and 88.9  g of O 2 . It makes no difference if water comes from 
Furwala, a remote village in the Punjab state of India, or from Lake 
Tahoe located along the border between California and Nevada in the 
United States, as long as the water is pure. If the water is not pure, then 
chemically it is not water, in the strict sense of chemistry. 
 In 1808, John Dalton fused these two principles with the concept of atoms 
to propose the atomic theory of matter with the following main features: 
 1.  Each element is made up of tiny particles called atoms. 
 2.  All atoms that compose a given element are identical. For example, each 
atom in an element has the same mass as every other atom of the same 
element. 
 3.  Atoms of a given element are different from atoms of all other elements. 
For example, atoms of two different elements have different masses. 
 4.  To form chemical compounds, atoms of one element can combine with 
atoms of other elements in a deﬁ nite ratio of whole numbers, so that the 
proportion of atoms from different elements in a compound is always 
the same. 
 5.  Atoms are fundamental particles, that is, they are indivisible: They cannot 
be created or destroyed. For example, atoms of one element cannot be 
changed into atoms of a different element in a chemical reaction. 
 Dalton formulated his theory based on chemical reactions performed in 
the macroworld of the laboratory. Neither Dalton nor those scientists who 

154  
ANATOMY OF AN ATOM
followed him for a century after his work was published had direct experimen-
tal evidence for the existence of atoms. In light of Dalton ’ s theory, atoms are 
neither created not destroyed in a chemical reaction; they are simply rear-
ranged to break the existing bonds and build new bonds to create products. 
In order to understand the creation or destruction of arrangements or bonds, 
you need to know more about atoms. In the pursuit of knowing more, scientists 
discovered that atoms are not fundamental after all. That means they are 
composed of smaller particles, which is equivalent to saying that atoms have 
a structure. 
 4.4  THE STRUCTURE OF AN ATOM 
 During the 1820s, one feature of Dalton ’ s atomic theory that atoms are fun-
damental particles was challenged by experiments suggesting that the atom 
consists of even smaller particles, today collectively referred to as the sub-
atomic, elementary, or fundamental particles. The work of several scientists, 
such as Michael Faraday and William Crookes, led to the discovery of a nega-
tively charged subatomic particle called an electron. The ﬁ rst step toward 
speculating on the structure of an atom came from the experimental discovery 
that atoms contain electrons. Furthermore, because atoms overall were neutral, 
it was obvious to speculate that if there were electrons (negatively charged 
particles) in the atom, there must be some positively charged matter in it as 
well to balance the negative charge and make the atom neutral. 
 
 Note :  According to Dalton ’ s atomic theory, all atoms of an element are identical. 
This was challenged more than 100 years after the theory was ﬁ rst suggested. It was 
realized that some atoms of an element have more mass than other atoms of the 
same element. Now, we know that all atoms of a particular element have the same 
number of protons, called the atomic number of the element. The mass difference 
between different atoms of a speciﬁ c element is caused by a different number of 
neutrons. The total number of protons plus neutrons in an atom is called the mass 
number. Atoms with identical atomic numbers, but different mass numbers, are 
called isotopes of the same element. To complete the story, the number of electrons 
in an atom is equal to the number of protons. 
 In 1897, a British physicist J. J. Thomson, who had played a great role in the 
discovery of the electron, put together the properties of electrons, and by 
combining these properties with the known properties of atoms proposed the 
ﬁ rst model of atomic structure. This structure is illustrated in Figure  4.2 . 
According to the Thomson model, an atom is a lump of positively charged 
matter with electrons embedded in it. 
 Thomson ’ s model was challenged by the results of a series of experiments 
conducted under the supervision of Ernest Rutherford, a former student of 

THE STRUCTURE OF AN ATOM  155
none other than Thomson himself. The schematic diagram presented in Figure 
 4.3 illustrates the experimental setup for those experiments, which were con-
ducted in 1911. A narrow beam of alpha particles is produced by using a source 
of alpha particles, such as a radioactive substance, and letting these particles 
pass through a hole, such as a slit in a lead collimator. This narrow beam of 
alpha particles is then directed at a thin metallic foil, such as a gold (Au) foil. 
The alpha particles are expected to be scattered by the foil, and a screen made 
of ﬂ uorescent material, such as zinc sulﬁ de (ZnS) is set to receive the scattered 
particles. The screen would give off a visible ﬂ ash of light when an alpha 
particle hits it.

 Note :  An alpha particle is the nucleus of the He atom, that is, it is essentially the 
He atom that has lost both of its electrons. So, it carries a positive charge of  + 2 e , 
that is, the positive charge that will balance the negative charge carried by two 
electrons. 

156  
ANATOMY OF AN ATOM
 Alpha particles are positively charged. Therefore, according to the Thomson 
model, most of the alpha particles passing through the metallic foil will be 
moderately deﬂ ected from their original path because they will experience a 
repulsive force from the positively charged matter everywhere in the atoms. 
However, the experimental results were entirely in disagreement with this 
expectation. There were two important observations: 
 1.  Most of the alpha particles passed right through the foil with no change 
in their direction. 
 2.  A few alpha particles were actually deﬂ ected, but with large angles; some 
of them even bounced straight back: a deﬂ ection of 180 ° . 
 These results challenged the Thomson model and led to the nuclear model 
of atomic structure with the following main features: 
 1.  An atom contains an extremely small and dense portion called the 
nucleus. 
 2.  All of the positive charge of the atom (and almost all of the mass) is 
concentrated in the nucleus. 
 3.  The nucleus is surrounded by a much larger volume of empty space. 
 4.  The empty space around the nucleus is thinly populated by a number of 
negatively charged electrons to balance out the positive charge of the 
nucleus. 
 
 Ernest Rutherford (1871 – 1937) 
 Ernest Rutherford, a student of J. J. 
Thomson, was born in Brightwater, New 
Zealand on August 30, 1871. In 1898, he was 
appointed the Chair of department of 
Physics at McGill University in Canada. 
Niels Bohr was one of his students. In 
physics, he is known for the Rutherford 
model of the atom, Rutherford scattering, 
and discovery of the proton. He won the 
1908 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his 
investigations into the disintegration of the 
elements, and the chemistry of radioactive 
substances. 
 Rutherford died on October 19, 1937 at 
the age of 66 in Cambridge, England 
following an operation for an umbilical 
hernia. 
 

THE CLASSICAL COLLAPSE OF AN ATOM  157
 The calculations based on the results of these experiments estimated that 
the diameter of empty space around the nucleus was 10,000 – 100,000 times 
greater than the diameter of the nucleus. When relatively massive particles, 
protons and neutrons, were discovered, scientists realized that these particles 
make up the nucleus of the atom. It was natural to wonder how the electrons 
might be behaving in the vast empty space around the nucleus. The most 
popularly held speculation was that they traveled in circular orbits around the 
nucleus, much like planets move in orbits around the sun. 
 
 Caution :  The results from the Rutherford experiment demonstrated that an atom 
has a structure and thereby is not a fundamental particle. This means that atoms 
can be created and destroyed as opposed to Dalton ’ s atomic theory. However, note 
that the processes that create or destroy atoms occur during nuclear reactions, which 
are a much higher energy processes than the atomic processes or chemical reactions. 
In chemical reactions, Dalton ’ s theory still works pretty well. 
 Note :  The proton was discovered by Rutherford in 1919 and the neutron by 
Chadwick in 1932. 
 Obviously, the roots for this kind of speculation were in classical physics. 
 4.5  THE CLASSICAL COLLAPSE OF AN ATOM 
 The Rutherford atomic model emerged from the Rutherford experiment, 
which revealed that a tiny but massive and positively charged nucleus is sur-
rounded by electrons at relatively great distances. How would you explain this 
in classical physics? One thing was sure: Electrons had to move to escape 
protons, otherwise according to Coulomb ’ s law of electrostatic force of attrac-
tion between opposite charges, they will crash into the nucleus. Scientists knew 
how planets revolving around the sun escape crashing into the sun due to 
gravitational force. So it was natural to think electrons revolved around the 
nucleus in circular or elliptical orbits. 
 In the spirit of classical physics, let us assume that an electron (negatively 
charged) in an atom under the inﬂ uence of Coulomb (electrostatic) attraction 
toward the positively charged nucleus revolves in a circular orbit around the 
nucleus. Let us calculate some predictions of classical mechanics for this plan-
etary model of the hydrogen atom, the simplest atom. 
 
 Note :  It may be more reasonable to assume that the electron would revolve in an 
elliptical orbit, but it is simpler to work with the circular orbit. The basic conclusions 
from this classical approach will stay the same regardless of whether the orbits are 
assumed to be circular or elliptical.

 What would happen to the electron if the total energy of the electron turned out 
to be positive? 
 Answer: 
 In this case, the electron would not follow a closed orbit around the nucleus. In 
other words, it would not be bound to the nucleus. 

160  
ANATOMY OF AN ATOM
 In these calculations, we have applied two major laws of classical physics, 
Newton ’ s laws of motion and Coulomb ’ s law of electrostatic attraction, 
we have come to the conclusion that atoms are stable, which of course is in 
agreement with experimental observations. However, the problem starts when 
we realize that there is yet another major law of classical physics that applies 
to this situation. The electron revolving in an orbit is in constant acceleration 
to stay in the orbit, and according to classical EM theory (by Maxwell), 
any charged particle in acceleration radiates EM energy, called  synchrotron 
radiation . Therefore, the electron revolving around the nucleus must lose its 
energy to radiation and ultimately collapse into the nucleus. If and when it 
happens, it will eventually combine with the proton and all sorts of atomic and 
nuclear hell would break loose resulting in the collapse of the universe as we 
know it. 
 PROBLEM 4.2 
 It is experimentally known that an energy of 13.6  eV is required to knock out the 
electron of the hydrogen atom. Using the classical calculations performed in this 
section, answer the following questions: 
 A.  What is the radius of the orbit in which the electron moves around the nucleus 
of the hydrogen atom in angstrons?

 The speed of the electron is only 0.73% of the speed of light. Therefore the non-
relativistic treatment is justiﬁ ed. 
 An obvious theoretical way out of this classical disaster is to assume that 
the electron revolving around the nucleus in a ﬁ xed orbit somehow cannot 
lose any energy. This is exactly where the quantum atomic model starts. 
 4.6  THE QUANTUM RESCUE 
 In 1913, a Danish physicist Niels Bohr, fused the work of Planck and Einstein, 
discussed in Chapters  2 and  3 , with the results from the Rutherford experiment 
to propose the model of the hydrogen atom (see Fig.  4.4 ), which is considered 
the ﬁ rst quantum model of atomic structure. 
 4.6.1  Bohr ’ s Model 
 Rutherford ’ s experiment suggested that an atom can be thought of as a micro-
scopic solar system in which electrons orbit the nucleus. With this in the back-
ground, Bohr suggested the model with the following main features: 
 1.  An atom consists of an extremely dense nucleus that contains all the 
positive charge of the atom and nearly all the mass. 
 2.  Negatively charged electrons travel in circular orbits around the nucleus. 
 3.  There are certain orbits around the nucleus, called stationary orbits, in 
which the revolving electrons do not radiate energy. Electrons moving 
in these orbits are in stationary states; they possess a constant amount 
of energy as long as they stay in their orbit, which means they will stay

in that state unless they are disturbed by an outside source, such as a 
photon. 
 4.  An electron radiates energy when it jumps from one stationary state 
(orbit) at higher energy to another stationary state (orbit) at lower 
energy. They absorb energy in order to rise from a lower to a higher 
energy state. 
 You can see that features 1 and 2 are directly from the results of the 
Rutherford experiment, and features 3 and 4 are there as a defense against 
classical EM theory wrongfully predicting the collapse of the atom as discussed 
in Section  4.6 . An electron in a stationary orbit does not radiate, that means, 
it has a constant energy. But what is that energy? To answer this question, Bohr 
leaned on the following two giant physicists of his time: 
 1.  Planck, who had successfully explained black - body radiation, discussed 
in Chapter  2 , by proposing that energy is proportional to frequency and 
is emitted in discrete amounts. 
 2.  Einstein, who advanced Planck ’ s idea to successfully explain the photo-
electric effect, also discussed in Chapter  2 . 
 You can see from Chapter  2 that the work of Einstein and Planck can be 
summarized in one mathematical formula:

 Although Bohr did not believe at the time in the existence of a photon, he 
did use quantization in order to explain the spectrum of light emitted by 
hydrogen atoms. He proposed that the angular momentum of the electron in 
a stationary orbit around the nucleus is given by
 mvr
n
=
ℏ 
where  h  is Planck ’ s constant, used in previous chapters, and  n is an integer. 
 This formula ﬁ xes radii of stationary orbits as:

 Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962) 
 Niels Bohr, a student of Ernest Rutherford, 
was born in Copenhagen, Denmark on 
October 7, 1885. In 1916, Niels Bohr became 
a professor at the University of Copenhagen. 
Werner Heisenberg, the inventor of 
uncertainty principle was one of his students. 
Bohr also worked at the top - secret Los 
Alamos laboratory in New Mexico, United 
States, on the Manhattan Project. 
 In 1922, Bohr received the Nobel Prize in 
physics for his investigation of the structure 
of atom. During the last ﬁ ve years of 
his life, Bohr took a keen interest in the 
developments in molecular biology. His latest 
thoughts on the problem of life appeared in 
his ﬁ nal (unﬁ nished) article published after 
his death, titled  “ Light and life revisited. ” 
Bohr died on November 18, 1962 in 
Copenhagen of heart failure. 

THE QUANTUM RESCUE  165
 So, the Bohr model explains the results of the Rutherford experiment by 
proposing that electrons move around the nucleus of an atom in  stationary 
orbits and they do not radiate or absorb any energy until they jump from one 
orbit to another. The Bohr model was also successful in explaining another 
problem that existed toward the end of nineteenth century, the line spectra of 
light emitted by different elements. 
 4.6.2  The Bohr Model Meets the Spectral Series 
 These days we know that light absorbed or transmitted by an element reveals 
signiﬁ cant information about the atomic structure of the element. When a gas 
of atoms is heated up, for example, by passing an electric current through it, 
it emits light. It was discovered that if you view this light through a narrow - slit 
aperture, for example, by using a spectrometer, the light would appear as a 
discrete set of lines of different color; that is, of different wavelengths or fre-
quencies. As described earlier in this chapter, every element, when a sample 
of it in vapor phase is excited, displays a unique discrete set of lines, called the 
line spectrum. 
 It was discovered that the lines in the emission spectrum of an element falls 
into sets called the spectral series. The ﬁ rst of such a series was discovered by 
a Swiss school teacher J. J. Balmer in 1885, when he was studying the light 
spectrum emitted by hydrogen atoms. This spectrum is now known as the 
Balmer series. As shown in Figure  4.5 , the Balmer series represent wavelengths 
of visible light emitted by hydrogen. Subsequently, other series were discov-
ered that represent emission of light of speciﬁ c wavelengths by hydrogen in 
infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) regions. The electron transitions giving rise 
to these spectral lines according to the Bohr model are illustrated in Figure 
 4.6 , which also presents a series that fall outside the visible light spectrum.

University of Pennsylvania. 
 Note :  The spectral series discovered in the UV region is called the Lyman series 
and those discovered in the IR regions are called the Paschen, Brackett, and Pfund 
series. 
 By analyzing the data from experiments on different elements, J.R. Rydberg 
and Walter Ritz wrote down the following empirical formula to explain the 
data:

where  l and  n are integers and  ℜ is a constant called the Rydberg constant 
whose value stays the same for all series of an element, and varies slightly from 
element to element.

approaches 10.97373  μ m  − 1 for massive elements. 
 In formula 4.5, values of  l represent different series, and values of  n for the 
same value of  l represent different lines in the same series. This general 
formula represented a different series, as shown in Table  4.1 .

with  l  =  7. What will be the possible value of  n to represent the lines in the series

 The greatest success of the Bohr model has been to explain these spectral 
series. In other words, we can derive the Rydberg formula from the Bohr 
model, as we will demonstrate here.

 Hence, the Rydberg formula is predicted by Bohr ’ s model and it explains 
the spectral lines well. It turns out that this equation holds well within experi-
mental uncertainty of measurements, and therefore the Bohr model explains 
the spectral lines successfully. So, according to the Bohr model, a spectral series 
results from the energies emitted by the electrons at higher energy levels 
(stationary orbits) jumping to a speciﬁ c lower energy level. As illustrated in 
Figure  4.7 , the Lyman series corresponds to the electrons jumping from higher 
orbits to the  n  =  1 orbit. The Balmer series results from electrons jumping from 
higher energy orbits to the  n  =  2 orbit, and so on.

which agrees with the given measured value. 
 As demonstrated by Eq.  4.3 and  4.6 , both the radius of the electron in an 
orbit in the atom and its energy are quantized in the Bohr model due to the 
presence of the integer  n . It means an electron in an atom can orbit around 
the nucleus only in certain speciﬁ ed distances from it, and therefore can have 
only certain speciﬁ ed energies called energy levels or states. Yes, the electron 
can never be found between these speciﬁ ed orbits, called stationary orbits or 
stationary states, but it can jump from one stationary state to another. This 
means an electron can absorb or emit a photon only if the value of the photon 
energy corresponds to the energy difference between these states. 
 Here is an example. Consider an electron that is in energy level  n i and drops 
to energy level  n f . You can calculate the frequency of the energy emitted by 
this electron during this jump by using Eq.  4.6b :

 In a nutshell, the Bohr model had two great contributions to the develop-
ment of the understanding of atomic structure: 
 1.  It successfully explained the spectral series of the hydrogen atom. 
 2.  It introduced the idea of quantized energy levels of an electron in an 
atom; that is, electrons in an atom exist only in certain discrete energy 
levels. Obviously, energy is involved in moving an electron from one orbit 
to another. 

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOMIC STRUCTURE  171
 These quantized energy levels are represented by the principal quantum 
number  n in the modern quantum mechanics of atomic structure. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 4.5 
 Discuss qualitatively how the Bohr atomic model is consistent with the principle of 
quantum conﬁ nement introduced in Chapter  3 . 
 Solution: 
 According to the principle of quantum conﬁ nement, a conﬁ ned particle can only 
have certain speciﬁ c energies, that is, its energy is quantized. In the Bohr model, the 
energy of the electron in an atom is quantized. This is consistent with quantum 
conﬁ nement because the electron is conﬁ ned within an atom, that is, it is bound to 
the nucleus of the atom. 
 However, there were problems with the Bohr model. 
 4.6.3  Limitations of the Bohr Model 
 Even though the Bohr model was an important ﬁ rst step in the way toward 
developing quantum theory, it had limitations, such as the following: 
  •   Although it explained the spectra of the hydrogen atom well, it failed to 
explain much of the spectra of larger atoms. 
  •   Even in the hydrogen atom, it wrongfully predicts the angular momentum 
of the electron in the ground state to be   ħ , whereas it should truly be zero. 
  •    It also avoids addressing the problem of why the negatively charged 
electron will not collapse into the positively charged nucleus. It simply 
assumes it will not happen by postulating the stationary states, but does 
not explain why. 
 Nevertheless, by introducing the concept of discrete stationary states, the Bohr 
model played an important role in developing the more comprehensive models 
and quantum theory of atomic structure and behavior. 
 4.7  QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOMIC STRUCTURE 
 You learned in Chapter  3 how Louis de Broglie introduced the wave nature 
of matter, such as the wave nature of electrons. Between 1925 and 1928, Erwin 
Schr ö dinger developed wave mechanics for subatomic particles based on this 
idea. Out of these efforts emerged the quantum mechanical model of the atom 
that has been withstanding the test of the experiments to date. In this section, 

172  
ANATOMY OF AN ATOM
we brieﬂ y explore important elements of this model: principle energy levels, 
sublevels, and orbitals of electrons in an atom. 
 4.7.1  Principle Energy Levels 
 The Bohr model has made its way into the quantum mechanical model in the 
following two ways: 
 1.  The stationary orbits in the Bohr model are identiﬁ ed as principal energy 
levels deﬁ ned by the principal quantum number  n with the same values 
as in Bohr model: 1, 2, 3.  … 
 2.   Just like the Bohr model, the energy of an electron in the atom depends 
on the principal energy level, that is, the principal quantum number  n . 
 There is no theoretical (or mathematical) limit on the maximum number 
of principal levels, but  n  =  7 is the highest that can be occupied by the ground -
 state electrons in an atom of any known element. The maximum number of 
electrons allowed in a principal energy level with a principal quantum number 
 n is given by 2 n 2 . For example, the lowest energy level ( n  =  1), can hold up 
to two electrons, the next higher energy level ( n  =  2), can hold up to eight 
electrons, and so on. 
 PROBLEM 4.6  
 What is the maximum number of electrons that can be held in ﬁ rst seven energy 
levels?

 You can ask two questions here 
 1.  Where are the electrons in the principal energy level (orbit)? 
 2.  What determines the maximum number of electrons in a given principal 
energy level? 
 The answer to the ﬁ rst question is in a given principal level, the electrons 
live at sublevels whose names proceed as follows: s, p, d, f, g, h.  … A sublevel 
can only have so many electrons, and a principal energy level can have 
only so many sublevels, therefore there is a limit on the maximum number of 
electrons in a principal energy level. 

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOMIC STRUCTURE  173
 4.7.2  Sublevels 
 As mentioned earlier, corresponding to each principal energy level, there are 
one or more sublevels with types: s, p, d, f, g, h … .

 Note :  The names of the sublevels s, p, d, and f come from the formal terms used in 
spectroscopy, the study of an interaction between matter and EM radiation. 
Theoretically, there are sublevels beyond f, but the ﬁ rst - four sublevels (s, p, d, and 
f) are enough to describe the conﬁ guration of an electron in atoms of the known 
elements. 
 A sublevel is identiﬁ ed by its name preﬁ xed with the value of the principal 
quantum number  n . For example, sublevel s in the  n  =  1 energy level is called 
1s, and sublevel s in the  n  =  2 level is called 2s. The maximum numbers of 
sublevels that can exist in a principal energy level  n  are equal to  n . For 
example, for principal energy level  n  =  1, there is only one sublevel s called 1s, 
and for energy level n  =  2, there are two sublevels s and p called 2s and 2p. 
For energy level  n  =  3, there are three sublevels s, p, and d called 3s, 3p, and 
3d, whereas the  n  =  4 energy level contains four energy sublevels s, p, d, and f 
called 4s, 4p, 4d, and 4f. Table  4.2 presents more examples. 
 What do the sublevels look like and how many electrons can a sublevel 
hold? This is where orbitals come into the picture. 
 4.7.3  Electron Orbitals 
 As you learned in Chapter  3 , it is not possible to precisely determine the 
velocity and position of an electron simultaneously. Because we cannot simul-
taneously determine the position and velocity of an electron in an atom, unlike 
the Bohr model, there are no clearly deﬁ ned orbits. However, we can math-
ematically describe regions in an orbit where electrons can be found with high 
probability. These regions are called orbitals. There are two important things 
you need to remember about orbitals:

 Answer 1: 
 Number of orbitals in g  =  9 
 Number of orbitals in h  =  11

 1.  Each kind of sublevel contains a certain number of orbitals: sublevel s 
has 1 orbital, p has three, d has ﬁ ve, and f has seven. This sequence of 
odd numbers continues through higher sublevels. 
 2.  The maximum number of electron that can occupy an orbital is two. 
 Table  4.3 . presents the number of orbitals and maximum number of elec-
trons at different sublevels. 
 Why are there different numbers of orbitals in different sublevels? For 
example, why is there only one s and 3 p orbitals? The reason is because dif-
ferent kinds of orbitals have different shapes, as shown in Figure  4.8 . An s 
orbital is spherical with nucleus at the center. This shape can only have one 

CLASSICAL PHYSICS OR QUANTUM PHYSICS  175
orientation. A p orbital has two lobes meeting at the nucleus. This shape can 
have three independent orientations: along the  x ,  y , and  z dimensions. 
Therefore, there are three p orbitals. The d, f, and higher orbitals have a more 
complex geometry resulting in more degrees of freedom, and hence a higher 
number of orbitals. 
 Why does each orbital hold only two electrons at maximum? This can be 
understood in terms of the Pauli exclusion principle according to which no 
two electrons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. An orbital 
has only two quantum states, and therefore it can have only two electrons at 
maximum. We will revisit orbitals further on in this book, for example, in 
Chapter  7 . 
 Although the quantization idea of the Bohr model made it to the quantum 
mechanical model of the atomic structure, the Bohr model as a whole is at the 
interface of the classical and quantum approach. 
 4.8  CLASSICAL PHYSICS OR QUANTUM PHYSICS: WHICH ONE 
IS THE TRUE PHYSICS? 
 As you have seen so far, classical physics breaks down at the atomic scale, and 
quantum physics explains well the phenomenon at this scale. You may be 
asking the following kinds of questions:

 1.  So, which physics is the true physics that explains physical phenomenon 
at all scales?  
 2.  Is it true that classical physics is the physics of the macroscopic world 
and quantum physics is the physics of the microscopic world? If so, 
does it not mean that the correctness of physics is scale dependent, 
or that nature follows different laws at macroscopic and microscopic 
levels? 
 Starting with the second question, here is the short answer: A true theory of 
science should not be scale dependent, its approximations may. We already 
know that classical physics breaks down at the atomic scale, so it cannot be an 
accurate theory. If quantum physics has to be an accurate theory, it must work 
at the macroscopic level as well. We already know that classical physics works 
well at the macroscopic level, so if quantum physics is an accurate theory, it 
must yield the results of classical physics when applied to the macroscopic 
level. This requirement is called the correspondence principle. 
 Let us work out an example of an electron in a hydrogen atom, with both 
classical and quantum physics. According to classical physics, an electron 
revolving around the nucleus of this atom in an orbit of radius  r and velocity 
 v , emits radiation of frequency equal to its rotational frequency,  f rot :

 We have used Eq.  4.6 to introduce  E 0 into this equation.

ously inconsistent with each other. But consider the limit when  n f and  n i are 
very large numbers; this is true in the macroscopic world. In this limit, consider,

 This equation is consistent with Eq.  4.10 , which means in the classical limit 
of  n  →  ∞ , the classical and quantum laws agree. This example explains that 
when the electron emits radiation, it is actually making a transition between 
adjacent energy levels of very large quantum numbers. Due to the large 
quantum number, the energy differences between the consecutive energy 
levels are inﬁ nitesimally small and go unmeasured. Therefore, the energy 
quantization is not visible. 
 
 Note :  The requirement that quantum physics yields the same results as classical 
physics in the limit of the quantum number approaching inﬁ nity is called the cor-
respondence principle.

ANATOMY OF AN ATOM
 In a nutshell, as this example demonstrates, quantum mechanics is an accu-
rate theory and classical mechanics is an approximation of quantum mechan-
ics. This approximation works well at the macroscopic level because the 
quantum effects are negligible at this scale. This bending makes sense because 
as we mentioned earlier in this book, the roots of physical reality perceived in 
the macroworld are in the microworld. This occurs because the macroworld is 
composed of the objects of the microworld. 
 Applications of a scientiﬁ c theory in the real world are always the ultimate 
evidence of the correctness of the theory. Classical physics allows for easier 
computation and is an excellent approximation for the macroworld. For 
example, today when trajectories are computed for spacecrafts, the equations 
used are from Newtonian mechanics, and they work quite well. 
 4.9  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 Butadiene (C 4 H 6 ) is an important industrial chemical, which is used as a 
monomer in the production of useful polymer materials, such as synthetic 
rubber. It is used in the mixture with other materials, such as styrene or acry-
lonitrile, to produce polymers that are both strong and elastic. Styrene –
 butadiene rubber is the material most commonly used for the production of 
automobile tires. 
 We can put such chemicals to more and efﬁ cient use if we understand them 
at the molecular level. Here is an example of how the butadiene molecule can 
be understood in terms of quantum mechanics. 
 4.9.1  Free Electron Model for Pi Bonding 
 A pi (  π ) bond is a covalent bond in which two lobes of one electron orbital 
involved in the bond overlap with two lobes of the other electron orbital. 
However, only one of the orbital ’ s nodal planes pass through both the nuclei 
of the involved electrons. Electrons in p orbitals usually participate in this kind 
of bonding. These bonds are usually very weak. As an example, consider a 
molecule of C 4 H 6 with an alternate single and double bonds, as illustrated in 
Figure  4.9 . In this molecule, there are a total of 22 valence electrons: 16 from 
four C atoms and 6 from 6 H atoms. 
 Recall that the electron conﬁ guration in a C atom is 1s 2 , 2s 2 , 2p 2 . The 18 
electrons in the butadiene molecule occupy the lower nine orbitals involved

in bonds called  σ - bonds: six C – H bonds and three C – C bonds. The four 
remaining valence electrons participate in   π – bonds and can be considered 
essentially free due the weakness of   π – bonds. We can model this situation as 
free electrons in a one - dimensional (1 D) box with an inﬁ nite potential outside 
the box. In other words, these electrons move freely over the length of the C 
bonds, as illustrated in Figure  4.10 . Because the electron in the terminal C 
atoms will go beyond location of the terminal C, we add one - half of the bond 
length at each terminal C. So the box length will be equal to four times the 
average bond length: 4  ×  0.140  nm  =  5.60  nm. 
 The valence electrons in the C atom are in  n  =  2. Therefore, the lowest 
unoccupied energy state corresponds to  n  =  3. This means the lowest energy 
absorption band corresponds to the transition from  n  =  2 to  n  =  3. Under the 
particle in a box model, the energy of a   π – electron is given by

where  m  is the mass of the electron and  a  =  5.60  nm, as estimated above. 
Substituting   Δ E  =  hc / λ in Eq.  4.14 , we obtain   λ  =  207  nm, which compares well 
with the experimental value of   λ  =  210   nm for the ﬁ rst absorption band of the 
butadiene molecule. 
 4.10  SUMMARY 
 Elements absorb and emit light (EM radiation) in characteristic patterns 
called spectra, which reﬂ ects their atomic structure. Toward the end of the 
nineteenth century, emission of line spectra by atoms, such as hydrogen, was 
one of several problems scientists were struggling to explain. It was success-
fully explained by the Bohr model by proposing that negatively charged elec-
trons in an atom revolve around the positively charged nucleus only in certain 
speciﬁ c orbits called stationary orbits. The reason is because as long as the 
electron is in its stationary orbit it does not radiate any energy. An electron in 
an atom radiates energy only when it jumps from a higher stationary orbit to 
a lower stationary orbit, and absorbs energy only to jump from a lower station-
ary orbit to a higher stationary orbit. The stationary orbits of the Bohr model 
made their way into the modern quantum mechanical model of atomic struc-
ture, where they are called principal energy levels. These principal energy 
levels contain sublevels, such as s, p, d, and f, which contain orbitals. Orbitals 
are the regions in an atom where there is a high probability of ﬁ nding elec-
trons. An orbital can contain at most two electrons. 
 Quantum physics is the true physics, whereas classical physics is its approxi-
mation at the macroscopic level. It works because the quantum effects are 
relatively too small at the macroscopic level to be observed or to make a noti-
cable difference to the measurements. 
 So far in this book, you have developed a good sense of how the quantum 
approach differs from the classical approach and how historically it was intro-
duced by the need of explaining phenomena at the atomic scale that could not 
be explained with the classical approach. It is about time that we put all the 
cards of quantum physics on the table; that is, put together the main principles 
and formalism of quantum mechanics in one place to get an integrated picture. 
That is exactly what we do in Chapter  5 .

 5.1  INTRODUCTION 
 In the previous chapters, you have learned how experimental observations 
toward the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth 
century suggested that some physical observables, such as energy and momen-
tum, can only have certain permissible values. Those variables, also called 
canonical variables, are said to be quantized. To postulate this quantization 
was necessary to explain the fundamental behavior of matter and radiation 
exposed by these experiments. Obviously, postulates and models based on 
empirical studies, such as these, provide useful insight into the problem under 
study. However, a fundamental theory will go farther to explain the origin of 
 Formalism is a process to capture the truth in a given ﬁ eld in terms of a set of rules 
without dealing with any truth that may exist outside the framework of these rules. 
Therefore, formalism lends itself well to disciplines that are based upon axiomatic 
systems, where an axiom, also called a postulate, is a proposition that is not proved or 
demonstrated, but is generally considered to be either self - evident or true. The word 
 “ axiom ” comes from the Greek word, which means  “ to deem worthy ” . For example, 
from the viewpoint of a formalist, mathematics is no more than symbols with certain 
meanings, connected according to some logic and a few elementary rules. The truth of 
the postulate is taken for granted, and serves as a starting point for deducing and infer-
ring other truths, which in science we call theoretical predictions. This is where the 
postulates are put to the test by testing the predictions with experiments. However, be 
warned that outside the ﬁ elds of logic and mathematics, the term  “ axiom ” is sometimes 
used loosely for any established principle of a ﬁ eld. 
 In this chapter, you will venture through the formalism of quantum mechanics. 

184  
PRINCIPLES AND FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
these postulates and will have a greater predictive power. The origin of quan-
tization was not really understood until the formal theory of quantum mechan-
ics was developed during the 1920s. This theory would predict more than just 
the quantized values of certain observables. For example, you will see in the 
forthcoming chapters that other postulates and principles in addition to quan-
tization, which was proposed in the previous chapters to explain experimental 
results, will also naturally arise from this theory. 
 To some, this chapter may come across as somewhat abstract. However, in 
the forthcoming chapters, we will be applying these principles to real - world 
physical examples and show how useful tools emerge from these principles 
that are applied to explain a wide spectrum of physical phenomena. 
 5.2  HERE COMES QUANTUM MECHANICS 
 The history of the development of quantum mechanics to explain the behavior 
of the microscopic world is a very good example of how we typically make 
progress in science. When we see some experimental observations that cannot 
be explained by existing scientiﬁ c knowledge, we hypothesize. A sound hypoth-
esis usually makes predictions. We test the predictions of the hypothesis and 
modify it to accommodate any new information learned from our experiment. 
If we gather more (and enough) related experimental information outside the 
realm of the existing hypothesis, we make another hypothesis. Eventually, over 
time and with enough experimental information, the big picture starts emerg-
ing. Subsequently, we try to ﬁ t all this information and interrelated hypotheses 
into what is called a theory and base it on a small number of assumptions. The 
beauty of such a theory lies in the fact that all the previously scattered hypoth-
eses and principles can now be derived from the theory based on a very few 
assumptions. No, we do not stop even at this point. We keep on challenging 
the theory with new facts to see if they ﬁ t into the theory in order to keep 
building our conﬁ dence in it. One of the strengths of science is that theories 
are always under scrutiny and are up for revision or even a one - way trip to 
the junkyard. This underlines the difference between science and a belief 
system, such as a religion or astrology. Scientists thrive on discovering contra-
dictions and do not shy away from saying goodbye to a theory if the facts can 
be better explained by a new theory. As a matter of fact, scientists on one hand 
develop theories and on the other hand spend their lives proving them wrong. 
This is the story of the theory of evolution in biology, of earth - centric versus 
heliocentric theories in cosmology, and of classical and quantum mechanics. 
The history of the development of quantum mechanics is a very good case 
study to explain how theories are developed. As you have seen in the previous 
chapters, many elements of quantum mechanics, such as Planck ’ s quantization 
and the de Broglie particle wave, were ﬁ rst presented as hypotheses. After 
thorough testing and experimental veriﬁ cations, these hypotheses became an 
integral part of quantum theory. 

THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF QUANTUM MECHANICS  185
 The theory of quantum mechanics, once put together, should not only 
explain the experimental results discussed earlier, it should also have a more 
predictive power. In fact, it should be able to derive all the possible informa-
tion from a mechanical (or physical) system just like classical, Newtonian 
physics. This is because classical physics works well for macroscopic objects 
with speed substantially less than the speed of light. Under those conditions, 
predictions of quantum mechanics must be consistent with those of classical 
physics. 
 
 Note :  In this book, as physicists often do, we divide the world into two parts: mac-
roscopic, which generally means the world of objects that are large enough that we 
can see with our naked eyes; and microscopic, which means the world of objects 
that are so small we cannot see them with our naked eyes. For example, we need a 
microscope to see a cell of an organism; so the cells belong to the microworld. The 
scale of the microworld, starting from a few hundred micrometers, goes all the way 
down to nanometers and even smaller; as small as we can theoretically or experi-
mentally go to examine matter. 
 The original formulation of such a quantum theory is generally credited to 
Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr ö dinger, who presented essentially the 
same theory in two different mathematical formulations. Heisenberg ’ s formu-
lation, developed in 1925 and 1926 by Heisenberg along with Max Born and 
Pascual Jordan, is in terms of matrices, whereas Schr ö dinger ’ s formulation 
developed in 1926 by Erwin Schr ö dinger is in the form of wave mechanics. 
Paul Dirac, Schr ö dinger, and others later demonstrated that both formulations 
yield identical results even though they use a different mathematical structure. 
Since its mathematical framework is similar to the classical wave description 
in introductory physics that the students might already be familiar with, we 
use Schr ö dinger ’ s approach to present quantum mechanics in this book. Also, 
this approach allows us to explain quantum mechanics by using simple calculus 
that most of the physical science students study as part of their lower division 
science courses. 
 So, in this book we consistently use the wave mechanics approach to 
quantum mechanics. The heart of wave mechanics is the wave function. 
 5.3  WAVE FUNCTION: THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF 
QUANTUM MECHANICS 
 As you saw in Chapter  1 , the wave function in an introductory physics course 
is introduced as a solution to a wave equation. In quantum mechanics, that is 
a good starting point. Also, you learned in the previous chapters about the de 
Broglie hypothesis, which states that particles can behave as waves. If there is 

186  
PRINCIPLES AND FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
a wave, there has to be a wave function to represent that wave. To accommo-
date the de Broglie hypothesis, the theory of quantum mechanics starts with 
the wave function. 
 5.3.1  It Is All about Information 
 The importance of information is not limited to information technology or 
computer science. Science, in general, is largely deﬁ ned by the three - prong 
information activity: collect factual information, such as experimental observa-
tions and results on a topic, let an existing theory or a new hypothesis predict 
the information about the same topic, and compare the information from these 
two sources: (theory and experiment). 
 I just happened to learn quantum mechanics before I got into biology. 
Very early on, I heard in a biology class that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
is an information molecule: It contains coded within it the information on 
what proteins are to be made and how to make them. When I heard it, 
I immediately thought of the wave function in quantum mechanics as an 
analogy. In much the same way that DNA is an information molecule in a cell, 
a wave function is an information entity in quantum mechanics that contains 
all the information about the physical system it represents. In a nutshell, the 
wave function is the know - it - all information entity. However, it comes with a 
price tag: probability or uncertainty, as opposed to the certainty of classical 
mechanics. 
 5.3.2  Introducing Probability in Science 
 In the previous chapters, we introduced the wave – particle duality of nature. If 
a particle (or a physical system) can be represented by a wave, it must have a 
wave function associated with it. In quantum mechanics, such a wave function, 
 Ψ , represents the probability of ﬁ nding the particle, such as an electron, at a 
given point in space and time. To be precise, you will learn later that because 
the value of   Ψ in general turns out to be a complex number (the number that 
includes the square root of  − 1),   Ψ itself does not have any direct physical 
interpretation. However, the square of its absolute magnitude |  Ψ | 2 evaluated 
at a speciﬁ c point in space and time represents the probability density of 
experimentally ﬁ nding the particle at that point in space and time. Of course, 
because the state of the particle can evolve over time due to changing condi-
tions that the particle is subject to, the wave function will accordingly change 
over time as well. 
 
 Note :  Do not be confused between the terms particle and system. A system refers 
to one or many particles plus the conditions they are in, such as potential energy 
or conﬁ nement. Even a single free particle with zero potential energy can be 
referred to as a system. So, the speciﬁ c meaning of system depends on the context. 

THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF QUANTUM MECHANICS  187
 Because the particle must be somewhere, the integration of | Ψ | 2 over total 
space and time must be equal to 1. This can be represented mathematically as
 
 
Ψ
2
1
dV
−∝
∝∫
=
 
 (5.1) 
where  dV represents inﬁ nitesimal volume at time  t in which the particle can 
be found with the probability of |  Ψ | 2 . This is also called the  normalization 
condition for the wave function. The wave function that meets this condition 
is called a normalized wave function. 
 
 QUANTUM MECHANICS POSTULATE 1 
 The state of a physical system (or particle) is completely speciﬁ ed by an entity 
associated with it called a wave function,   Ψ , that in general depends on the spatial 
coordinates of the system and time. The square modulus of this wave function is 
the probability density for ﬁ nding the system with a speciﬁ ed set of values for the 
spatial and temporal coordinates. 
 Note :  It is not hard to imagine that the people who believe in the deterministic 
nature of scientiﬁ c measurements should freak out at the probabilistic nature pos-
tulated by quantum mechanics. And they, including the scientists who developed 
quantum mechanics, did freak out. People still do. This is the aspect of quantum 
mechanics that disturbed Albert Einstein, a pioneer of quantum mechanics. 
Throughout his life he expressed his disbelief in the probabilistic nature of quantum 
mechanics, which lives on in his famous statement: God does not play dice with the 
universe. That said, there are all kinds of misinterpretations of the probabilistic 
nature of quantum mechanics out there against which you need to guard your 
understanding. 
 The fact that the wave function contains all the information about the par-
ticle it represents should not sound like magic. Recall from classical mechanics 
reviewed in Chapter  1 that all the mechanical (or physical) properties of an 
object, such as velocity, momentum, and energy, are either a function of its 
location (position) in space and time or derivatives of it. Because the wave 
function is a function of space and time, all the dynamical information about 
the particle can be derived from it. Some properties only depend on spatial 
coordinates, others also depend on time. Accordingly, we have time - independent 
wave functions and time - dependent wave functions. 
 Equation  5.2 below is an example of a very simple time - independent wave 
function:

PREDICTING THE MEASUREMENTS  189
 QUANTUM MECHANICS POSTULATE 2 
 A measurable physical observable is represented by a quantum mechanical opera-
tor that operates on a wave function to predict the value of the measurements of 
the observable. 
 In a nutshell, a wave function has all the information about the system that 
it represents. How do we extract information from it? That is where operators 
come into the picture. 
 5.4  OPERATORS: THE INFORMATION EXTRACTORS 
 Continuing with the DNA analogy, enzymes operate on the DNA molecule 
to extract information from it and express the information in terms of 
messenger RNA (mRNA). Analogously, in quantum mechanics there are 
quantum mechanical operators that operate on the wave function to extract 
information from it and express it in terms of values sometimes called 
eigenvalues. There is nothing mystic about operators. You have all taken the 
derivative of a function, say  df / dx . Think of  d / dx as an operator operating on 
the function  f . 
 As an example, in quantum mechanics consider an operator:
 ˆA
i
x
=
∂
∂
ℏ
 
 This operator operating on a function   Ψ means:
 ˆA
i
x
Ψ
Ψ
=

where  ˆA is just a shortcut notation for this operator and  i =
−1. It is 
important to know that the operators mathematically extract information 
from the wave functions. But what does quantum mechanics says about 
how to relate this information with experimental information, that is, 
measurement?  
 5.5  PREDICTING THE MEASUREMENTS 
 A theory must predict what will be the possible results of a measurement. 
In the framework of quantum mechanics, the only possible results from the 

190  
PRINCIPLES AND FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
measurements of an observable  A are the eigenvalues of the corresponding 
operator  ˆA according to the following equation:
 ˆA
a
n
n
n
Ψ
Ψ
=
 
 Any measurement of  A can yield only one of the eigenvalues  a n . A system 
may have more than one possible eigenvalue with some probability attached 
to each of them. The wave function   Ψ n  is called an eigenfunction. These  eigen 
terms come from the German word  eigenwert, which means proper or char-
acteristic value. If there are a number of identical systems represented by a 
particular eigenfunction   Ψ a , the measurement of  A made on all of these 
systems will yield the same values:  a k . 
 QUANTUM MECHANICS POSTULATE 3 
 The only possible results in the measurement of a physical observable  A are the 
eigenvalues  a n of the corresponding operator  ˆA operating on the wave function   Ψ n 
in accordance with the following eignevalue equation:
 A
a
n
n
n
Ψ
Ψ
=
 
where  a n is a real number; that is, it does not include  i ≡
−1, and  n is an integer. 
 Postulate 3 captures one of the most salient features of quantum mechanics, 
quantization, discussed in previous chapters. 
 
 Caution :   Quantum mechanics predicts quantization unlike classical mechanics, 
but it does not exclude a continuum of eigenvalues. You will see an example of 
continuum values in the case of a free particle, that is unbounded. 
 We will get back to eigenvalues in Section  5.7 . For now, consider the 
following issue. When we perform an experiment, we get a deﬁ nite value and 
not a probability. For example, the particle will either be found here or there, 
but not a little bit here and a little bit there. But the predictions of quantum 
mechanics are in terms of probabilities. So, then, how do we associate these 
predictions with experimental measurements? In other words, we need the 
formalism to express the quantum mechanical predictions so that they can 
be tested. 
 This is where the concept of expectation values comes into the picture. We 
will derive the expectation value from the wave function and compare it to 
experimental results. First, what is the expectation value? 

PREDICTING THE MEASUREMENTS  191
 5.5.1  Expectation Values 
 Expectation value of an observable is the expected value of an observable 
derived from the wave function and compared with the average of several 
experimental measurements of that observable. To explain the concept, let us 
consider a particle that is constrained to move along the x - axis. Assume that 
we are trying to determine the position of a particle along the x - axis. Let us 
say we made several experimental measurements, which found the particle  N 1 
times at  x 1 ,  N 2 times at  x 2 ,  N 3 times at  x 3 , and in general  N i times at  x i . The 
average of these measurements is given by

 Now, assume that the results used in Eq.  5.4 were not measurements, but 
given probabilities predicted by a theory. For example, it is predicted that if 
an experiment is performed,  x 1 will appear  N 1 times,  x 2 will appear  N 2 times, 
and so on. Theoretically, you can predict inﬁ nite values; that is, a whole con-
tinuous curve of values. In other words, we can move from this discrete 
approach to a continuous approach represented by the probability  P ( x ) that 
the particle will be found at a speciﬁ c point  x . Replace  N i in Eq.  5.4 with  P , 
and the average value denoted by  x with the expected value of  x denoted by

 In a nutshell, the average value of an observable is the weighted average 
of several measurements, whereas the expectation value is the predicted 
value of this average by quantum theory. When we say that the wave function 
 Ψ ( x ) contains all the information about the system it represents, we mean 
that we can calculate the expectation values of various observables from 
the wave function. In addition to the location of the particle, there are 
two more important observables: momentum and energy. How exactly 
do we calculate expectation values for these variables? To answer this 
question, we need to use the concept of operators introduced earlier in 
this chapter. 
 5.5.2  Operators 
 We know from Sections  5.4 and  5.5 that operators act on a wave function 
to extract information for the system they represent. We also know that the 
predicted value of an observable is represented in terms of the expectation 
value. Combine these two pieces to realize that the expectation value can be 
calculated by using operators. 
 To be more speciﬁ c, let us ask the question How do we determine the 
expectation values of momentum  p ( x ,  t ), and energy  E ( x ,  t )? The answer is 
simple: Rewrite Eq.  5.10 by replacing  f ( x ) with  p and  E to obtain

 But, what really are the expressions for  p and  E that we can use in these 
equations? Let us try to derive them from the wave function itself. You know 
from wave mechanics that a wave moving in the  + x direction can be described 
by a wave function  Ψ as follows:

 Consider the rhs of Eq.  5.14 . In this expression, the quantity  − i ħ ( ∂ / ∂ x ) is 
operating on the wave function in the sense that it is telling us to take the 
partial derivative of the function that follows it and multiply the result by  − i ħ . 
Such a quantity is called an operator. So, an operator is a theoretical entity 
that makes a mathematical operation upon a function and transforms it into 
another function. So, Eq.  5.14 deﬁ nes the momentum operator, which can be 
written as:

 An operator is a very general concept and is not limited to momentum and 
energy. Each physical observable  f has an operator  ˆf  associated with it. The 
expected value of this observable can be found very much like Eq.  5.10 , but 
by replacing the observable ’ s function with its operator:

PRINCIPLES AND FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
 The generality of an operator allows quantum mechanics to handle any 
observable. This fact is helpful because there may be some observables at the 
microscopic scale that did not exist in classical mechanics. 
 QUANTUM MECHANICS POSTULATE 4 
 If the state of a system is described by the wave function   Ψ , the expectation value 
of an observable  f for this system can be computed by using the following 
equation:
 f
f

=

where  ˆf  is the operator corresponding to the observable  f , and   Ψ is normalized. 
 Now, you understand why an operator should be in the middle of the 
expression (Eq.  5.17 ). The reason is it needs to operate on   Ψ . Now that we 
have derived the deﬁ nitions of momentum and energy operators, we can 
replace Eqs.  5.11 and  5.12 for the momentum and energy expectation values 
with the following equations:

 To summarize, a general formalism here is that an observable in quantum 
mechanics is represented by an operator that operates on the wave function 
to predict values of the observable in terms of expectation value. This gener-
alization is needed to deal with the microscopic world because it may have 
observables (in addition to the observables realized in the macroworld, such 
as position, momentum, and energy) that do not have an analogue in the 
macroscopic world. Electron spin is an example of such an observable that we 
will discuss later. 
 So, in developing quantum mechanics, we have so far introduced two tools: 
the wave function and the operator. These tools can be used to build an equa-
tion; the equation that deﬁ nes quantum mechanics. 
 5.6  PUT IT ALL INTO AN EQUATION 
 In this section, we will use the deﬁ nitions of momentum and energy operators 
deﬁ ned in this chapter, to reach an equation that deﬁ nes quantum mechanics.

We begin with a fundamentally true physical equation about the total energy 
 E of a particle both in classical and quantum mechanics:
 E

where  V  is the potential energy of the particle and  T is the kinetic energy that 
can be written in terms of momentum:

where  p  is the momentum and  m is the mass of the particle.

 Voila, you have obtained the famous Schr ö dinger equation in its most 
general form: the time - dependent Schr ö dinger equation. This is the funda-
mental equation of quantum mechanics the same way as the equation of 
motion representing Newton ’ s second law of motion is the fundamental 
equation of Newtonian mechanics, which you met in Chapter  1 . However, 
do not consider our effort here as a derivation of the Schr ö dinger 
equation. We have simply shown that postulating momentum and energy 
operators in Eqs.  5.15 and  5.16 is equivalent to postulating the Schr ö dinger 
equation. 

198  
PRINCIPLES AND FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
 The Schr ö dinger equation cannot be derived from fundamental principles 
because the equation itself is a fundamental principle. We hold this principle 
to be fundamentally true. Although like any other scientiﬁ c theory or prin-
ciple, it needs to be continuously tested against experimental results and 
observations. Since its invention, the Schr ö dinger equation has withstood 
experimental tests; more on this in the forthcoming chapters. 
 As mentioned earlier in this chapter, the power of a scientiﬁ c theory is 
twofold: It explains the existing experimental observations and it makes falsiﬁ -
able predictions. In this context, the Schr ö dinger equation will only be useful 
if it provides a mechanism to determine the values of physical observables, 
that is, measurable quantities, of a physical system, such as position, momen-
tum, and energy. For that to happen, ﬁ rst you set up the Schr ö dinger equation 
for a given problem, and then you solve that equation to obtain the wave 
function. The wave function, the solution to the Schr ö dinger equation, contains 
all the information about the system that the equation represents. 
 As mentioned earlier, once we found an operator corresponding to an 
observable, we operate it on the wave function that contains the information 
about the system. This operation yields the predicted possible values of the 
measurements of that observable. 
 You may notice that Eq.  5.20 , the Schr ö dinger equation, resembles many 
other differential equations in physics. The trick is to use this equation to 
formulate a physical problem in such a way that yields a physically acceptable 
solution, that is, the wave function. This is where eigenfunctions and eigenval-
ues come into the picture. 
 5.7  EIGENFUNCTIONS AND EIGENVALUES 
 Have you noticed that we are dealing with complex wave functions (involving 
 i ) and complex operators corresponding to physical observables. However,

the measurements of physical observables are always real. For example, 
the measured energy value could be 2  MeV and never (2  +  i3) MeV. Therefore 
we are interested in those wave functions that when operated upon by 
the operators yield real values. These wave functions and values are called 
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. Generally speaking, for an eigenfunction   Ψ 
and operator  ˆA:
 ˆA

where  a is an eigenvalue if it is real. 
 Now, we establish a practical example of eigenvalues. By substituting

 This is called the time - independent (or steady - state) Schr ö dinger equation. 
Equation  5.21 can be interpreted this way: An operator on the lhs of the equa-
tion operates on the wave function   Ψ ( x ) and yields the real value  E (rhs). It 
turns out that the steady - state Schr ö dinger equation  5.21 can only be solved 
for certain values of  E for real physical problems, as you will see in the upcom-
ing chapters. These discrete values of  E are called eigenvalues and the corre-
sponding wave functions are called eigenfunctions. 
 Recognize that the operator in Eq.  5.21 represents the total energy 
( E  =  T  +  V ) of the system. Therefore, Eq.  5.21 can be rewritten as:
 
 ˆH
x
E
x
n

( ) =
( )  
 (5.22) 
 We say that  E n  are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator, when 
the operator operates on the eigenfunctions   Ψ n of a system. We will not 
be making use of the Hamiltonian in this book; just use it to impress your 
friends.

PRINCIPLES AND FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
 If you are getting overwhelmed with the new terminology, here is some 
good news. The terminology of operators, eigenfunctions, and eigenvalues is 
part of the framework and formalism that physicists use to study more complex 
systems. Because this book is more aimed on understanding the fundamentals 
of quantum mechanics with the aim of applying them to real - world applica-
tions with minimal jargon and complexity of formalisms, we will not be using 
this terminology much in this book. It is presented here mostly for the sake 
of completeness, and also to help the advanced reader to reach a more theo-
retical depth of quantum mechanics. 
 5.8  DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT REVISITED 
 Look at the Schr ö dinger equation and convince yourself that it is linear in the 
wave function   Ψ , which means that it has terms that contain the ﬁ rst power of 
 Ψ and its derivative, and does not contain the higher powers of   Ψ or its deriva-
tive. For this reason, a linear combination of solutions of this equation is also 
a solution. For example, if   Ψ 1 and   Ψ 2  are two solutions of the Schr ö dinger 
equation, so is   Ψ , given by the following equation:
 Ψ
Ψ
Ψ
=
+

2  
 This means that the wave represented by the Schr ö dinger equation obeys 
the principle of superposition just like any other waves, such as light and 
sound waves; and that the solutions to the Schr ö dinger equation are subject 
to interference effects. In other words, de Broglie waves associated with 
particles are subject to superposition and interference effects discussed in 
Sections  1.7 and  1.10 . 
 With this in mind, let us revisit the double slit experiment covered in Section 
 1.10 for particles.

DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT REVISITED  201
 5.8.1  Double Slit Experiment for Particles 
 Recall from Section  1.10 that the double slit experiment performed by Thomas 
Young for light waves contributed to establishing that light is a wave. If par-
ticles behave as waves as well, then the double slit experiment performed on 
particles, such as electrons, should also produce the interference pattern, and 
the experiments show that it does. 
 A simple illustration of such an experiment is presented in Figure  5.2 , which 
shows a pair of slits (also sometimes referred to as holes) through which beams 
of electrons of the same energy pass. The electrons are to be detected on the 
screen  S . Consider the following three cases: 
 1.  If slit 1 is open and slit 2 is closed, the intensity distribution of the elec-
trons measured by the electron detector screen is shown in graph ( a ) and 
can be understood in terms of the probability density  P 1 :
 P1
1
2
= Ψ
 
where  P 1 is the probability that an electron will be detected at the screen 
and  Ψ 1 is the wave function of the electron to pass through slit 1. 
 2.  If slit 2 is open and slit 1 is closed, the intensity distribution of the 
electrons measured by the electron detector screen is shown in graph ( b ) 
and can be understood in terms of the probability density  P 2 :
 P2
2
2
= Ψ
 
where  P 2 is the probability that an electron will be detected at the screen 
and  Ψ 2 is the wave function of the electron to pass through slit 2.

 The cross - term 2 Ψ 1 Ψ 2 is responsible for constructive and destructive 
interference. 
   
 Caution :   In quantum mechanics, it is the wave function and not the probability that 
adds for superposition.
 Some of us with mathematical minds will focus on the wave equation that 
governs the motion of the electron and will readily accept Eq.  5.24 . After all, 
in waves it is the wave functions (amplitudes) that add, not the probabilities; 
this is true even in classical physics. Others with more physical minds will argue 
for Eq.  5.23 . There argument will sound like this: There are only two slits. A 
given electron can either pass through slit 1 or 2 (there is no third option) to 
reach the screen. We already have the information about the probability of an 
electron arriving at the screen, and therefore on how many electrons will 
arrive at the screen, when only slit 1 is open. We also have this information 
when only slit 2 is open. It just makes sense to add up the numbers when both 
slits are open. 
 So, we have a conﬂ ict here. It turns out that both sides are correct in their 
argument in one or another sense; all we need here is a conﬂ ict resolution 
presented by particle – wave duality. 
 5.8.2  Chasing the Electron 
 The argument in support of Eq.  5.23 is based on focusing on electrons passing 
through the slits. So, let us go to the bottom of this approach and ask a ques-
tion Which slit does a given electron passes through? The supporters of Eq. 
 5.23 will say either slit 1 or 2. However, that is the classical way of looking at 
the situation. The answer from quantum mechanics is The electron has a |  Ψ 1 | 2 
probability of passing through slit 1 and |  Ψ 2 | 2 probability of passing through 
slit 2. There is a third probability that does not exist in classical physics; the 

DOUBLE SLIT EXPERIMENT REVISITED  203
probability represented by the cross term in Eq.  5.24 . The interpretation of 
this third probability may vary; one being that an electron passes through both 
slits. This interpretation will drive those people nuts who still have a classical 
picture of an electron in mind. Another response to this situation will be The 
very question of which hole the electron will pass through is a classical ques-
tion, you cannot ask it in quantum mechanics. 
 To further appease the supporters of Eq.  5.23 , let us get back to an experi-
ment. Put a light source behind both slits to detect which slit the electrons 
come from. Also keep track at what positions the electrons arrive at on the 
screen. In such an experiment, we ﬁ nd that graph ( c ) is observed. The interfer-
ence is lost. Now we have a real conﬂ ict here, an experimental conﬂ ict. 
Electrons follow Eq.  5.23 when we are watching them and they follow Eq.  5.24 
when we leave them alone. 
 The resolution of this apparently conﬂ icting situation lies in the wave par-
ticle duality. Electrons here travel as waves, but behave as particles when we 
try to observe them. We are in the midst of the situation that is much misun-
derstood, misinterpreted, and highly misused in the non - physics world. This is 
the situation from which people draw incorrect and silly conclusions, such as 
the following: 
  •   An object can exist at two places simultaneously (an electron passing 
through two holes simultaneously as particles). 
  •   An object only exists when you watch it (an electron behaves as a particle 
only when you try to observe it). This is stretched as far as to claim that 
for the universe to exist, we need a conscious observer, the so - called 
theory of a biocentric universe. 
 To dispel these myths right here where they are born, you need to under-
stand this situation with due diligence. First, an electron still existed when we 
were not observing it; it just existed as a wave. But then why did it turn into 
a particle when we tried to observe it? To appreciate the answer to this ques-
tion, ﬁ rst recall from previous chapters that an electron just like any other 
entity can exist both as a particle or as a wave. It was traveling as a wave, we 
disturbed it with our photons from the detecting light source to force it into 
the particle behavior. That changed behavior of electrons gave rise to the 
intensity pattern on the screen represented by graph ( c ). In other words, we 
changed the paths of electrons in the process of observing (measuring) them. 
We just happened to be conscious being; if the photons were there to hit the 
electron by some other means even in our absence, the result will be the same. 
So in such a situation, when you think of an observer, think of the entity, such 
as a photon, that disturbs the entity being observed, think of the environment 
that disturbs the entity. There are particles in our body, such as protons, 
electrons, and ions, which are constantly being observed and measured by their 
environment and they deal with their environment through wave – particle 
duality to keep us alive. This is the quantum reality of our lives. 

204  
PRINCIPLES AND FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
 To take advantage of the situation we are exploring, let me introduce two 
more concepts that you may run into out there: collapse of the wave function 
and quantum decoherence. When both slits are open, our electron is traveling 
as a wave and can be represented by the superposition of two wave 
functions:
 
 Ψ
Ψ
Ψ
=
+
a
b
1
2  
 (5.25) 
 When we tried to observe the electron to ﬁ nd out which hole it came from, 
we reduced the superposition of states to a single state. This is called collapse 
of the wave function from a superposition of several states (eigenstates) to a 
single one of these states. This happened due to the interaction of the electron 
with the observer, the photon in this case. Quantum decoherence is any process 
in which systems interact with their environment to give the appearance of 
the wave function collapse and thereby justify the classical intuition. 
 5.9  THE QUANTUM REALITY 
 At the heart of quantum mechanics are three concepts: superposition of mul-
tiple states, wave particle duality, and the uncertainty principle. Sometimes 
these three concepts together are referred to as quantum reality. 
 Superposition of states arises from the fact that we cannot precisely predict 
the state of a particle, for example, the particle will be found at location  x with 
momentum  p at time  t . As discussed earlier, we can only make statements like 
this one: There is a probability  a 1 that the particle will be found in state   Ψ 1 , a 
probability  a 2 that it will be found in state   Ψ 2 , and so on. This can be expressed 
in terms of the following equation:

 (5.26) 
where

 represents the probability that the system will be found in state   Ψ n . The coef-
ﬁ cient  c n , in general, is a complex number and the probability  a n , of course, is 
a real number. Here is what Eq.  5.26 means: At any given instant in time, the 
wave function   Ψ of a particle (or an isolated system) can be expressed as a 
linear superposition of a complete orthonormal set of wave functions   Ψ n . 
Orthonormal means that the total probability of ﬁ nding the particles in various 
states is one, which makes sense. Quantum superposition is a very fundamental 
concept of quantum mechanics, which may refer to the superposition of 
position (location) states, momentum states, energy states, or basically any 
property of a quantum system. 

THE QUANTUM REALITY  205
 The linear superposition of states is the prediction of quantum mechanics. 
However, when a speciﬁ c measurement is made on a property of the system, 
it will have a deﬁ nite value, that is, it will be found in one state and not in 
many states. This is called the collapse of the wave function. For example, 
quantum mechanics predicts that at any given instant of time the momentum 
of a system is the superposition of various momentum states. However, if you 
make a momentum measurement, the result will be a speciﬁ c value for the 
momentum. Because you have precisely measured the momentum of the 
system, the uncertainty principle kicks in to spread its position in space like a 
wave, and hence wave – particle duality. Similarly, if we measure the position 
of a system, the uncertainty principle forces the momentum to spread out like 
a wave in terms of the superposition of alternative momentum states. 
 In a nutshell, all matter and radiation exhibit a mixture of two characters: 
wave and particle; and these two complementary characters are linked by the 
uncertainty principle.

 Chemistry and some biology students should be familiar with the two possible 
(equivalent) Lewis structures, called resonance structures, shown in Figure  5.3 1 a 
and 2 a . Each structure shows three C – C single bonds and three C = C double bonds 
at different alternate places. Classical wisdom will predict that both structures 1 a 
and 2 a will exist, and that the three single bonds in the molecule will be longer than 
the three double bonds. However, experiments show that all six C – C bonds in a 
benzene (C 6 H 6 ) molecule are of equal length, 1.40  Å , which is inbetween the typical 
length of a C – C single bond (1.54  Å ) and the C = C double bond (1.34  Å ). In other 
words, structures 1 a and 2 a (or 1 b and 2 b ) in Figure  5.3 do not exist. What exists is 
structure 3 b . Can you explain it, qualitatively, by using quantum mechanics?

 5.10  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 In this chapter, you studied the basic postulates of the theory of quantum 
mechanics. So what?, you say, What has it to do with the real world, for 
example, with biology, the science of life? The answer is In principle, 
everything. 
 Living organisms are made up of exactly the same fundamental material as 
inanimate objects. The basic unit of life is a cell, which is made of four types 
of molecules [carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acid (DNA and ribonu-
cleic acid RNA)] which in turn are made from the same set of elements and 
fundamental particles as any nonliving material. In addition to this, there are 
fundamental particles directly involved in helping these macromolecules to 
perform their job. We will elaborate on this point by exploring the actions of 
a special type of proteins called enzymes. 
 Enzymes, which catalyze biological reactions inside cells, are present in 
every living organism, and may continue to function long after the organism 
is medically (technically) dead. The reactions that enzymes catalyze and will 
not occur properly without their help are essential to the life process. As you 
are enjoying reading this book, right at this moment, hundreds of thousands 
of reactions are taking place in the cells of your body to keep you alive and 
well. While your central nervous system is busy processing the information 

LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD  207
gathered from this page, your digestive system is processing your last meal. 
Your immune system is busy dealing with many particles, such as germs, which 
have made their way into your body; your heart is of course pumping; and 
many new cells are being made, and many old cells are being replaced as other 
internal systems carry out a multitude of intricate processes. All of these func-
tions are made possible and performed effectively with help from a large 
number of enzymes. 
 As illustrated in Figure  5.4 , enzymes perform their job by binding their spot 
called an active site to the reactant molecule called a substrate. Internally, all 
enzymes perform their actions by directing the movement of protons and 
electrons (fundamental particles) along the paths that lead to the product of 
the reaction. 
 One can argue about the following: At what level below the cell is the 
border where classical physics fails and quantum mechanics must be applied 
to understand life? However, there should be no doubt that to understand the 
role of fundamental particles, such as protons and electrons, directly working 
right inside the living cell, we need quantum mechanics. You can imagine that 
the cell (or the cell environment) on one hand provides choices (multiple 
states) to these particles, which exist in general as a superposition of multiple 
states. On the other hand, cells also acts as an observer to force these particles 
at a certain moment to collapse their wave function into one of the possible 
states. Here is an example to illustrate this point in the context of enzymes. As 
mentioned earlier, all enzymatic reactions involve the motion of single elec-
trons and protons; the enzymes perform their function by directing these 
particles along speciﬁ c paths in the cell. For instance, the enzyme lactate dehy-
drogenase (LDH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of a molecule 
called lactate to another molecule called pyruvate; which is an important step 
in energy production in cells. Many different types of cells in the body contain 
this enzyme; some of the organs relatively rich in LDH are the heart, kidney, 
liver, and muscle. The LDH catalyzes a reaction by directing a proton along a 
path between a histidine amino acid on the protein (enzyme) and the lactate

PRINCIPLES AND FORMALISM OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
substrate molecule. Classical thinking would go like this: At a given moment, 
the proton is either attached to the histidine, made its way to the lactate, or 
on its way to the lactate. 
 From a quantum mechanics viewpoint, the proton is capable of existing as 
a superposition of both states: attached to histidine and attached to lactate; 
being at both places at the same time. As we learned in this chapter, the wave 
character of protons allows the proton to be able to exist at both places at the 
same time. As illustrated in Figure  5.5 , roughly speaking, you can visualize it 
by considering a proton (or the wave function of the proton) as a two - hump 
wave, with one hump on histidine and the other hump on lactate. Initially, the 
hump on the histidine is much larger than the hump on the lactate. As the 
reaction starts, the hump on the histidine starts getting smaller and the hump 
on the lactate gets progressively larger. This is the quantum travel of a proton 
in this case. Of course, during this process, if a measurement is made by the 
cell through some event, the proton function will collapse to a single state: 
either attached to the histidine or to the lactate. Now this approach is quite 
different than the classical approach and will undoubtedly yield different 
results. Thereby we will be able to understand the process at a much better 
and realistic level. 
 In a nutshell, all actions performed by living cells are based on the motion 
of fundamental particles, which can only be understood by using quantum 
mechanics. In other words, quantum mechanics is at work at the very origin 
of every living organism. 
 5.11  SUMMARY 
 The theory of quantum mechanics presented in this chapter answers the basic 
question What framework and formalism does quantum mechanics offer to 
predict the possible values of observables of a physical system? First, the 
theory does it by proposing that the wave function associated with a physical

system, such as a particle, contains all the information about the system. It also 
introduces the mathematical machinery of quantum mechanics that will be 
used in the forthcoming chapters to solve real - world problems. An observable 
of the system is represented by an operator and the operator acts on the wave 
function to extract the information about the observable. Because the wave 
function represents the probability, the theory must answer the question of 
how to present the predictions in a form so that they can be directly compared 
with experimental results. Theory does it in the form of expectation value. 
 Information from the wave function is extracted in terms of an expectation 
value that corresponds to the average value of several experimental 
measurements. 
 This formulation of quantum mechanics can be put into an equation called 
the Schr ö dinger wave equation or simply the Schr ö dinger equation. Solving a 
physical problem in quantum mechanics then reduces to setting up the 
Schr ö dinger equation for the problem and ﬁ nding its physical solutions. These 
physical solutions are called eigenfunctions and an operator corresponding to 
a physical observable operates on the eigenfunction to predict the value of the 
observable called an eigenvalue. There will be a set of eigenvalues correspond-
ing to a set of possible eigenfunctions. 
 You might wonder by now: How can a whole theory be put into just one 
simple looking equation? In response to this question, you will be given a 
guided tour of the Schr ö dinger equation in Chapter  6 .

 6.1  INTRODUCTION 
 As described in Chapter  5 , a theory bases itself on a minimum number of 
assumptions from which other empirical principles and laws can be derived 
that may have previously been proposed to explain the experimental results 
and observations. Equations, the means for efﬁ ciently encapsulating and 
describing the relationships among physical quantities and variables, are very 
powerful tools in many ﬁ elds, especially in scientiﬁ c disciplines, such as math-
ematics, physics, and chemistry. A good scientiﬁ c theory is often expressed in 
terms of a few equations. For example, as you saw in Sections  1.15 and  1.16 , 
the whole classical electromagnetic (EM) theory can be put into four equa-
tions, called Maxwell ’ s equations, and the whole of classical mechanics can be 
expressed in one equation, Newton ’ s second law of motion. Such is the case 
with quantum mechanics, which is often expressed through the Schr ö dinger 
equation introduced in Chapter  5 . 
 Just as seen in classical mechanics, Newton ’ s laws, especially the second law, 
governs the motion of objects in the macroscopic world; the Schr ö dinger equa-
tion governs the dynamics of particles and is used to derive the particle ’ s 
physical properties, such as location (position), momentum, and energy. This 
chapter will demonstrate the power of this equation by applying it to two 
general situations: a particle in a box and harmonic oscillators, which represent 
countless real - world applications. We will show how solving the Schr ö dinger 
equation for these situations naturally yields some of the principles that were 
previously postulated to explain experimental results, as discussed in Chapters 
 2 – 4 . So, the main goal of this chapter is to understand and appreciate how the 
Schr ö dinger equation represents quantum mechanics. To that end, we will 
explore three avenues: introduction to the Schr ö dinger equation, solving this 
equation, and applying it to some simple systems, such as a particle in a box 
and a harmonic oscillator. 
 6.2  THE SCHR Ö DINGER WAVE EQUATION 
 The Schr ö dinger wave equation holds the quantum mechanical description of 
the dynamics of a physical system. The story of the invention of this equation 
goes back to that graduate student Louis de Broglie, who proposed that there 
is a wave characteristic associated with each particle; just as there is a particle 
nature to light, which is discussed in Chapter  3 . In November 1925, an Austrian 
physicist Erwin Schr ö dinger was presenting a seminar at the University of 

212  
THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
Zurich on the de Broglie ’ s model of particles behaving as waves. From among 
the audience, Peter Debye suggested that if there were a wave there ought to 
be a wave equation describing that wave ’ s behavior. Within a few weeks after 
the seminar, Schr ö dinger fused his knowledge of the quantum mechanical 
ideas and models existing at that time with what he knew about wave optics, 
resulting in his wave equation. Without going into the history of its evolution, 
here is the most general form of the Schr ö dinger wave equation expressed in

Note that this equation, also known as the time - dependent Schr ö dinger wave 
equation, describes the behavior of a physical system, such as a particle of mass 
 m as it moves in a potential  V over time represented by  t in three spatial 
dimensions:  x ,  y , and  z . The potential  V is also a function of space and time. 
 
 Erwin Schr ö dinger (1887 – 1961) 
 Erwin Schr ö dinger was born in Vienna, 
Austria on August 12, 1887. He received his 
doctorate in physics in 1910 at the University 
of Vienna. He developed the wave 
formulation of quantum mechanics including 
his famous equation during his stay at the 
University of Zurich from 1920 to 1926. In 
1933, he shared the Nobel Prize with Paul 
Dirac  “ for the discovery of new productive 
forms of the atomic theory ” . 
 Schr ö dinger worked in several ﬁ elds 
including physics, mathematics, biology, 
history, philosophy, language, and literature. 
He was at Dublin ’ s Institute in Advanced 
Study from 1939 until 1956, when he 
returned to Vienna. It was at Dublin that he 
became interested in Biology. His book  What 
Is Life , published in 1944, introduced 
biologists to the way of looking at life from 
the perspective of physics. It was this book 
that started James Watson and Francis Crick 
(a physicist himself) on their journey to 
search for the secrets of genes. This led to the 
discovery of the deoxyribonucleic acids 
(DNAs) double helix structure in 1953, for 
which Francis and Crick were awarded 1962 
Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. 
 Schr ö dinger died on January 4, 1961 in 
Vienna at the age of 73 of tuberculosis. 

THE SCHRÖDINGER WAVE EQUATION  213
 Equation  6.1 is a very general equation. All the problems do not need this 
form of the equation. The problems are usually modeled, for example, to one 
spatial dimension, in which case the time - dependent Schr ö dinger equation 
would take the form shown in Study Checkpoint  6.1 . So, various special cases 
from this general form of Eq.  6.1 , such as the time - independent Schr ö dinger 
equation, can be derived in a straightforward way to represent the problem 
at hand. 
 
The wave function   Ψ is the solution of the equation, which represents the 
states of the system for which the equation is written. We will be using the 
terms of the Schr ö dinger wave equation and the Schr ö dinger equation inter-
changeably; but they refer to the same equation.

  Note :  In addition to the physical argument made for separation of variables in the 
body of the chapter, mathematically speaking, separation of variables is a technique 
used to solve some differential equations. If a proposed solution satisﬁ es the dif-
ferential equation (Schr ö dinger equation in our case), it is a solution then, regard-
less of how we came up with this; separation of variable or any other technique. 
 This represents the motion of a particle in one - dimension (1D) when the 
motion varies with time. However, in a great many situations, the forces that act 
upon a particle vary only with the position (spatial variables) of the particle and 
not with time. Electrons in an atom bound to the protons in the nucleus and 
atoms in a crystal lattice are some examples. Under these forces, called station-
ary forces, the potential energy of the particle,  V , does not vary explicitly with 
time. In such cases, the space and time dependence of the wave function can be 
separated into two factors, space dependent and time dependent, as shown here:

 Why have we used total instead of partial derivatives in Eq.  6.4 ? 
 Solution: 
 Because  f and   Ψ in this equation are functions of only one variable:  f is a function 
of  t and  Ψ is a function of  x . 
 As shown in Problem  6.2 , the ﬁ rst term (from the left) in Eq.  6.4 is equiva-

 Equations  6.5 and  6.6 are known as the time - independent Schr ö dinger equa-
tions in one and three spatial dimensions respectively. It is also called the 
steady - state Schr ö dinger equation because it represents a particle whose 
potential energy,  V , does not depend on time. Therefore, the time variations 
of all functions of the particle have effectively the same forms as that of an 
unrestricted particle. 
 As mentioned in Chapter  5 , the Schr ö dinger equation cannot be derived 
from fundamental principles because the equation itself is considered to be a 
fundamental principle. We hold this principle to be fundamentally true. 
Although, like any other scientiﬁ c theory or principle, it needs to be continu-
ously tested against the experimental results and observations. Since its inven-
tion, the Schr ö dinger equation has withstood experimental tests. To start with, 
it explains all the experimental results discussed in the previous chapters that 
classical physics failed to explain. All the quantum laws and hypothesis dis-
cussed in these chapters proposed to explain those results are embedded in 
the Schr ö dinger equation with the right interpretation of the wave function. 
For example, Problem 6.9 demonstrates how you can derive the de Broglie 
hypothesis from the Schr ö dinger equation. In this and forthcoming chapters, 
we will continue not only to explore how this equation can be applied to the 
situations described in the previous chapters, but also to further explore the 
anatomy and physiology of atoms and molecules.

 The simplest physical system to be explained with quantum mechanics is the 
system that has zero potential energy  V everywhere; that is, a particle not 
subjected to any external forces. Because no forces are acting on this system,

it is called a free particle. For simplicity, let us consider a free particle only in 
1D, say  x . Such a particle can be represented by Eq.  6.7 below, which is

where  A is a constant. Note that according to this solution, the particle

for a free particle is not quantized even in quantum mechanics. However, 
the particle due to its wave nature will act like a wave under the right 
conditions. For example, if an electron is to pass through a partition with two 
slits on it, the result would be a wavelike diffraction pattern, as you saw 
in Chapter  5 .

 In this section, we have discussed the simplest possible case: a free particle. 
Note that the wave function of a free particle and the energy are not quantized. 
In the real world, however, most of the systems are bounded. Think of an 
electron bounded inside an atom, two atoms bounded together to make a 
molecule, molecules of life in living cells in your body, the blood cells ﬂ owing 
in your veins, you bound to the Earth by gravitational force, and the Earth 
bound to the Sun by the same force, and so on. So, next we discuss the case 
of a bounded system. 
 6.4  SCHR Ö DINGER EQUATION FOR A PARTICLE IN A BOX 
 A simple yet nontrivial situation is presented by a particle bounded (restricted) 
inside a box. Again, for the sake of simplicity, we will discuss the problem only 
in 1D,  x . We are discussing this system with three goals in mind: 
 1.  Get a feel of how the Schr ö dinger equation is applied to a bounded 
system; that is, a system that has some restriction on its motion. 

220  
THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 2.  Learn some characteristics of the solutions of the Schr ö dinger 
equation. 
 3.  Learn how the quantum approach makes different predictions than the 
classical approach. 
 So, let us see how we can set up and solve the Schr ö dinger equation for this 
system. 
 6.4.1  Setting Up and Solving the Schr ö dinger Equation 
 The system of a particle bounded in a 1D box is illustrated in Figure  6.1 . 
 Here is how we model this situation: 
 1.  The particle is restricted to traveling along the  x - axis from  x  =  0 to  x  =  a . 
 2.  The potential energy of the particle  V is a constant inside, that is, between 
 x  =  0 and  x  =  a . Let us assume for convenience that this constant is zero, 
that is,  V  =  0. 
 3.  The potential  V outside of the region from 0 to  a is inﬁ nite. 
 This ﬁ nding is the equivalent of having a potential well with walls at  x  =  0 
and  x  =  a . Inside the well, the particle can move freely and bounce back and 
forth from the walls without losing any energy, that is,  E is constant. Because 
it cannot have inﬁ nite energy, it cannot exist outside the well. As you will see

later in this section, it also means that the wave solution has nodes at the 
boundaries of the box. Any solution needs to satisfy that condition. 
 Within the well, the particle is free and therefore can be represented by 
the time - independent Schr ö dinger equation with  V  =  0. In other words, the 
particle inside the well can be represented by

where  A  and  B are constants. As shown in Problem 6.11, a more general solu-

solutions  A  sin  kx and  B  cos  kx :
 
 Ψ x
A

 (6.12) 
 So far, we have seen no difference in this situation and the previous situa-
tion of a free particle because inside the box, the particle behaves as a free 
particle. However, the results will become more interesting when we consider 
the fact that the potential at the walls is inﬁ nite. 
 6.4.2  Here Comes the Energy Quantization 
 Here is the exciting part: the appearance of quantization. Because the poten-
tial at the walls of the box is inﬁ nite, the particle cannot exist outside the box; 
that is, the wave function outside the box should be zero. In other words, we 
have two boundary conditions: 
 1.  The wave function should be zero at  x  =  0:

where  n must be a nonzero integer because if it is 0, then  k  =  0, and 
therefore   Ψ becomes zero everywhere; that is, a particle does not exist 
anywhere, which is absurd. Substituting the value of  k from Eq.  6.9 into 
Eq.  6.13 , we obtain

SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION FOR A PARTICLE IN A BOX  223
 Two important characteristics of the solution here are to be noted: Energy 
of the particle is quantized due to the integer values of  n , and the particle 
always has a nonzero positive energy because  n  =  0 is not allowed, as discussed 
before. These two characteristics are the quantum mechanical results that have 
no counterpart in classical mechanics, where all values of energies including 
zero are permissible. 
 This is an amazing thing: Even through the particle is free in the box, it can 
only assume a discrete set of energy states. The particle is constrained to have 
only certain discreet values of energy, that is, the energy is quantized. Also 
interesting is that the energy of the particle cannot be zero: It can never rest. 
Now, if you go to the classical limit, that is, the box gets big and therefore the 
available quantum numbers  n become very large, Eq.  6.14 shows that the solu-
tion becomes continuous within the accuracy of classical measurements. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 6.5 
 Will the energy states corresponding to  n  =  3 and  − 3 have different energies? 
 Solution: 
 No. 
 Because energy depends on the square of  n . 
 Note that in Eq.  6.14 ,  n is the same quantum number we talked about in 
the previous chapters, but now we obtained it from the Schr ö dinger equation. 
Also note that we obtained the quantized energy states as a characteristic of 
a bound system; that is, a particle conﬁ ned in a ﬁ nite region in space. The state 
of the particle with lowest energy is called the ground state and all other 
energy states are called excited states. Remember, the ground state is not the 
zero - energy state. 
 There is a straightforward, but very important implication of energy quan-
tization: The particle whose energy is quantized (i.e., the particle is bound) can 
absorb or emit only certain allowed discrete amounts of energies correspond-
ing to certain discrete frequencies. If the energy is the EM energy, we are 
talking about absorption and emission spectra. See how the spectra discussed 
in the previous chapters are naturally predicted by this simple example: the 
power of the Schr ö dinger equation. 
 
 Note :  The results and conclusions, such as nonzero and quantized energy drawn 
from the scenario of a particle in a box, are very general and do not depend on the 
fact that we only considered one spatial dimension and not three. 

224  
THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 Now that you have broken the ice with the Schr ö dinger equation, and you 
are excited with its predictive power displayed by the solution of a very simple 
situation, let us further explore the solutions of this equation, and see what we 
can discover. 
 6.4.3  Exploring the Solutions of the Schr ö dinger Equation 
 Equation  6.12 presented a solution of the Schr ö dinger equation that involved 
two constants  A and  B . We have already shown how the boundary conditions 
lead to  B  =  0; now we will determine the constant  A , because to write the 
general solution we need the values for both  A and  B . By substituting  B  =  0 
into Eq.  6.12 , we obtain the solution for the problem at hand:
 
 Ψ x

 By using Eq.  6.13 for  k :

 (6.16) 
 In general, the probability that the particle will be found somewhere is 1. In 
our case, because the particle cannot exist outside the well, the probability of 
ﬁ nding the particle somewhere in the well is 1. Therefore, the normalization

 What is the energy of a particle in a 1D box of width  a in its ground state? 
 Solution: 
 As we argued before from Eq.  6.13 ,  n must be a nonzero integer because if it is 0, 
then  k  =   0, and therefore   Ψ , becomes zero everywhere; that is, a particle does not 
exist anywhere, which is absurd. 
 The ground state corresponds to minimum energy and that is not zero. Remember 
 n  =  0 is not allowed. So the minimum energy the particle can have corresponds to 
 n  =  1. 
 Therefore the ground - state energy  =  E 1  =  h 2 /8 ma 2 .

 (6.17) 
 The case of  n  =  0 has already been ruled out as unphysical because it leads to 
an absurd result: the particle does not exist. As shown in Problem 6.12, both 
positive and negative values of  n represent the same physical quantitative 
meaning of the solution. The probability of ﬁ nding the particle somewhere in 
the box is represented by |  Ψ n ( x )| 2 . The solutions presented in Eq.  6.17 are 
illustrated for a few values of  n in Figure  6.3 , which demonstrates that while 
 Ψ n ( x ) could be positive or negative, |  Ψ n ( x )| 2 is always positive. Also, the prob-
ability density |  Ψ n ( x )| 2 of ﬁ nding the particle inside the box is not the same 
everywhere. In every case, it is 0 at  x  =  0 and at  x  =  a , and varies inside the 
box. For a given point in the box, the probability density depends on the 
quantum number  n . For example, for  n  =  1, the particle is most likely to be

THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 PROBLEM 6.3 
 According to classical physics, calculate the probability of ﬁ nding the particle any-
where inside the box when there is an inﬁ nite potential outside the box. 
 Solution: 
 Inﬁ nite potential outside the box means the total probability of ﬁ nding the particle 
inside the box is 1. According to classical physics the probability is continuously 
distributed; that is, the particle can be found anywhere inside the box with equal 
probability, say  P .

 The variation of probability for existence within the box is another result 
that is in contrast with classical physics, which predicts the probability will be 
1/ a everywhere in the box, as shown in Problem  6.3 . Talking about classical 
physics, let us review the correspondence principle, ﬁ rst discussed in Section 
 4.8 , now in the context of this problem. 
 6.4.4  The Uncertainty and Correspondence Principles: Revisited 
 The uncertainty and correspondence principles were discussed in Chapters  3 
and  4 , respectively. Let us see how we can realize these principles in the 
context of a simple problem of a particle in a box, which we are currently 
exploring. 
 As mentioned earlier, the variation of the probability of ﬁ nding the particle 
with the width of the box,  a , and the quantum number,  n , is a salient feature 
of quantum mechanics, whereas in classical mechanics there is no concept of 
quantum number. In classical mechanics, the probability of ﬁ nding the particle 
anywhere in the box will be the same, that is, equal to 1/ a . This classical result 
can be obtained from the quantum solution with a limit of  n  →  ∝ , that is, for 
found in the middle of the box (maximum probability density), whereas for 
 n  =  2, the particle will least likely be found there because the probability 
density there is minimum. The variations of the probability over  n can be 
understood in terms of energy. For higher values of  E , the particle is more 
excited, and therefore bounces back and forth from the walls, consequently 
creating more ﬂ uctuations in the probability of its location in the box. 

SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION FOR A PARTICLE IN A BOX  227
large values of  n . As you can see from Figure  6.3 , for large values of  n there 
will be a large number of oscillations or ﬂ uctuations in the probability density 
within the box. Under this situation, every point in the box will have an 
average probability density, which is 1/ a , the same as predicted by classical 
physics. Therefore  classical physics meets with quantum physics at large values 
of n ; the correspondence principle. 
 As shown in Study Checkpoint  6.6 , the minimum energy for this trapped 
particle (in a box) is nonzero, and is given by 
 
 E
h
ma

=
 
 (6.18) 
 The corresponding system in classical physics will have a minimum energy 
equal to zero. Therefore, this minimum nonzero energy and the corresponding 
momentum can be considered to be a result of a quantum mechanical as 
uncertainty, or expressed as an uncertainty. Because the potential energy 
inside the box is zero, the corresponding uncertainty in momentum can be 
calculated as:
 Δp
mE
h

 Here we have used the relation  E 1  =  p 2 /2 m and Eq.  6.18 . 
 The uncertainty in location of the particle is the size of the box:

which implies
 Δ Δ

which is in accordance with Heisenberg ’ s uncertainty principle introduced in 
Chapter  3 :

 So far, we have been assuming that the potential outside the box is inﬁ nite 
and therefore the value of the wave function outside the box is zero; that is, 
the particle cannot exist outside the box. However, the more realistic situation 
would be when the potential outside the box is not inﬁ nite, it is ﬁ nite but way 
 > E  of the particle. In classical physics, this does not change the situation 
because the particle will still not exist outside the box. But, what does quantum 

228  
THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
mechanics says about this situation? Assume we deposit a particle into the 
box with ﬁ nite walls, that is, a ﬁ nite potential outside the box. In quantum 
mechanics, we can ask the question What is the probability that the particle is 
still in the box after a certain time? This very question implies that after a 
certain time the particle will leave the box. It is called quantum tunneling, 
which we explore next in Section  6.4.5 . 
 6.4.5  Quantum Mechanical Tunneling 
 Assuming there is an inﬁ nite potential outside the box starting from  x  =  0 on 
one end and from  x  =  a on the other, it should mean there are rigid walls that 
the particle can never jump over. The reason is because its energy inside the 
box with  V  =  0 is always ﬁ nite, and hence always  < V at the walls. However, the 
assumption of an inﬁ nite potential is not very practical, and the world is ﬁ lled 
with practical examples of ﬁ nite potentials. Electrons in an atom are a practical 
example. So, let us say the potential  V is very large, but not inﬁ nite at the walls 
and outside the box. Under this condition, the wave function   Ψ ( x ) will not 
vanish at the boundaries ( x  =  0 and  x  =  a ). In other words, walls of the box 
will not be rigid. As illustrated in Figure  6.4 , the wave function will vanish 
around the walls, but it does not vanish exactly at the wall. This can also be 
understood in terms of the uncertainty principle:

p x ≥ℏ

 It means that the particle has to have inﬁ nite uncertainty in momentum in 
order to have zero uncertainty in its location. In other words, the particle has 
to have inﬁ nite momentum, and hence inﬁ nite energy in order for you to say 
for sure that it cannot be found at or around  x  =  0 or  x  =  a . This means at ﬁ nite 
energy  E , even when it is  < V , a particle can exist outside the walls, as shown 
in Figure  6.4 . 
 Congratulations, you have just realized another salient feature of quantum 
mechanics called the tunneling effect: The particle has tunneled through the 
walls even if it did not have enough energy to jump over the potential walls. 
This obviously has no analogue in classical physics. Note from Figure  6.4 that 
as the value of a quantum number  n increases, more of   Ψ can be found outside 
the box. Increasing  n means increasing the wavenumber according to  ka  =  n π , 
and hence increasing momentum. 
 After these qualitative arguments for tunneling, let us see how the tunneling 
effect arises naturally from the analytic treatment of the Schr ö dinger equation 
for a particle in a box. We rewrite the time - independent Schr ö dinger equation 
in 1D, Eq.  6.5 , in the following form:

 Now, consider the case in which  V  is  > E outside of the box starting from 
the walls:
 V

where  V 0  >  E 
 Under this scenario, Eq.  6.5 can be rewritten as:

 (6.19) 
 Now, outside the box starting from  x  =  0 and  x  =  a ,  V 0  −  E is positive because the 
potential outside the box is greater than the energy of the particle inside the 
box. Classically, this means that the particle stays trapped inside the box. But 
pay close attention to Eq.  6.19 . It tells us that the second derivative of the wave 
function   Ψ ( x ) has the same sign as   Ψ ( x ) itself. This means that the wave func-
tion, that is, the solution of Eq.  6.19 , is not a periodic function; it is exponential. 
You can verify that the following is one possible solution to this equation:

THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 According to the solution in Eq.  6.20 , the wave function decays exponen-
tially in the region with  V  =  V 0 and not periodically. That means there is a 
nonzero probability that the particle can exist outside of the box even when 
the potential there is greater than the energy of the particle. Now that we have 
the wave function, let us calculate this probability. The probability density

 This probability may be small, but not zero. These small energies and prob-
abilities are only small in the macroscopic world; in the microworld of atoms 
and molecules, these values are typical: They run the world. Figure  6.5 plots 
the tunneling probability given in Eq.  6.22 . 
 So, you can see how a particle trapped inside a box can tunnel through it. 
As an example, Problem 6.13 shows that  P out is equal to 5.00  ×  10  − 7 for   Δ x  =  2  nm 
when the potential is 2  eV higher than the energy of the particle trapped in 
the box. These numbers are signiﬁ cant in the microworld. For example, 
 Δ x  =  2  nm can hold several atoms and is about the diameter of a deoxyribo-
nucleic acid (DNA) molecule. It only takes  ∼ 13.6  eV to rip an electron off the 
hydrogen atom. 
 To summarize, we have discussed the Schr ö dinger equation for simple 
cases, such as a free particle and a particle in a box. In exploring the solutions 
of this equation for a particle conﬁ ned to a box, we have seen how some 
salient features of quantum mechanics, such as energy quantization, ground 
state with nonzero energy, and quantum tunneling, arise naturally. Yet to some 
of us all this may seem like a nice intellectual exercise. What does it have to 
do with the real world?, you ask. Well, here are some relevant scenarios from 
the real world. You can ﬁ nd conﬁ nement everywhere: in the macroscopic 
world and in the microscopic world. Earth revolving around the Sun; that is, 
conﬁ ned to it by the gravitational force; you conﬁ ned to the Earth by the 
same force; Moon and satellites revolving around the Earth are some exam-
ples of conﬁ nement at the macroscale. At the microscale, some examples of

conﬁ nement are DNA molecules conﬁ ned to a nucleus in a cell, protons and 
neutrons conﬁ ned in the nucleus of an atom due to the nuclear force, electrons 
in an atom conﬁ ned to a region around the nucleus by the EM force, 
and electrons in a molecule conﬁ ned in a region around multiple nuclei by an 
EM force. 
 Some of these electrons in molecules conﬁ ned to a region around the nuclei 
may move freely along the bonds if the bonds are weak enough. But they are 
still conﬁ ned to the molecule. Such a situation may be described by a particle 
in a box. We explore one such example in the context of what is called a free 
electron model (see Section  4.9.1 ). 
 The results obtained from a particle in a 1D box are very general and easily 
extendable to a particle in a 3D box, which we discuss next. 
 6.5  A PARTICLE IN A THREE - DIMENSIONAL BOX 
 In Section  6.4 , we explored a particle in a 1D box. Even this simple case can 
be used to model some simple bound (or constrained) atomic and molecular 
systems in biology, chemistry, and nanotechnology to understand some struc-
tures and phenomena and to solve some problems. However, in a great many 
situations, it will be more practical to treat these atomic and molecular systems 
as 3D systems. The good news is that the results derived from the study of a 
particle in a 1D box are quite general and can easily be extended to 3Ds, as 
we show in this section. 
 Recall that the time - independent (steady - state) Schr ö dinger equation in 
3D is given by

where   Ψ is a function of  x ,  y , and  z . Just like a particle in a 1D box, we assume 
that the potential  V is a constant, say zero, inside the box and inﬁ nite outside 
the box. Let us further assume that the size dimensions of the box are  a 1 ,  a 2 , 
and  a 3 in the  x ,  y , and  z directions. 
 Recall that in the case of a 1D box, we started with the following solution:
 
 Ψ x

 (6.12) 
and concluded that due to the boundary condition,  B  =  0, and therefore the

will be:

 Therefore, the ground - state energy in 3Ds is three times larger than that in 1D. 
 So far, we have been assuming that the potential does not vary over space: 
It is constant and ﬁ nite (we assumed zero) inside the box and inﬁ nite outside. 
For some physical problems, these assumptions will be valid. However, there 

234  
THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
are some situations in nature where the potential is not zero and is not con-
stant: It varies over spatial dimensions. A great many of these situations can 
be represented by a harmonic oscillator that we discuss next in Section  6.6 . 
 6.6  HARMONIC OSCILLATOR 
 A harmonic oscillator is a system that vibrates about a position of equilibrium. 
Note the relationship between harmonic motion and equilibrium. Such a 
motion is called a harmonic motion, and such a system has a universal signiﬁ -
cance for two reasons. First, the situation of equilibrium is of great interest 
because there is an underlying physical law that systems tend to be in equilib-
rium and if disturbed they tend to restore their equilibrium. This physical law 
transcends itself in many laws and principles in physics and chemistry; and 
molecular biology cannot escape this principle either. Second, there are count-
less real - world situations in the microscopic world (just as in the macroscopic 
world) that can be represented by a harmonic oscillator. An atom in a crystal 
lattice and a diatomic molecule are two of the many categories of examples. 
 First, let us ask the question What is harmonic motion? 
 6.6.1  Understanding Harmonic Motion 
 Harmonic motion occurs due to the presence of some kind of restoring force 
 F that continually works to bring the system back to its equilibrium conﬁ gura-
tion or state when it is disturbed. Due to some kind of inertia, such as mass, 
the system always overshoots the equilibrium point, and therefore oscillates 
around the equilibrium point indeﬁ nitely if there is no dissipative process. 
 If you took an introductory physics course, you may remember an illustra-
tion of harmonic motion in terms of a mass  m oscillating in 1D,  x , on the end 
of a spring, as shown in Figure  6.6 . The farther away the spring is pulled from 
its equilibrium position at  x  =  0, the greater will be the restoring force. This 
relationship can be expressed in Hook ’ s law:
 
 F
x
= −κ
 
 (6.26) 
where  κ  is the proportionality constant called a spring constant.

 2.  Kinetic energy is zero when  x  =  A , that is, when the oscillator is at its

 The potential and total energy of a harmonic oscillator is illustrated in 
Figure  6.7 . But the energy is not quantized. Of course not, because our treat-
ment of harmonic motion so far has been within the framework of classical 
mechanics. 
 Now, let us ask a question and see how classical mechanics answers it before 
we ask the same question in quantum mechanics. The question is When the 
particle is oscillating about its equilibrium positions, what is the probability 
density of ﬁ nding the particle in a speciﬁ c region along the oscillation path? 
First, convince yourself that the slower the particle is passing through a given 
region, the higher is the probability of ﬁ nding it there, because the more time 
the particle spends in a region the higher is the probability of ﬁ nding it in that 
region. Hence, we can say that the probability  dP  of ﬁ nding the particle some-
where between  x and  x  +  dx is inversely proportional to its speed,  v :
 dP
dx
C
v
=
 
where  C  is the proportionality constant whose value we can determine from 
the normalization condition; that is, the total probability of ﬁ nding the particle 
somewhere along the oscillating path is 1. But ﬁ rst, let us see how the speed 
varies along the oscillation path by writing it in terms of displacement  x .

 The probability density is plotted in Figure  6.8 as a function of  x in units of 
 A from  − A to  + A . As you can see from the plot, the probability of ﬁ nding the 
particle at the end points is maximum because the velocity there is around zero. 
 Let us see how the things change when we switch to quantum mechanics. 
 6.6.2  Harmonic Motion in Quantum Mechanics 
 Question : How do we solve the harmonic motion problem in quantum mechan-
ics? The obvious answer is by solving the Schr ö dinger equation for the system,

 Let us take the mystery out of the solutions, shown in Eq.  6.34 . The ﬁ rst term 
depends on the quantum number  n and also involves the constant   α . The last 
term in Eq.  6.34 is an exponential function of displacement  x and constant   α . 
The term  H n represents a polynomial of degree  n called a Hermite polynomial, 
named after a nineteenth century French mathematician Charles Hermite. 
Note from Eq.  6.34 that the Hermite polynomial is a function of the displace-
ment  x of the oscillating particle from its equilibrium position and the constant 
 α , which depends on the mass of the particle and the spring constant. The 
Hermite polynomial is given by

THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 The quantum number  n in the Hermite polynomial and in Eq.  6.34 represents 
the fact that there are many solutions: One corresponding to each value (0 or 
any positive integer) of  n . As an example, Problem  6.6 determines  H

 Note from Eq.  6.36 that although  n  =  0 is allowed, the ground - state energy 
or minimum energy of a harmonic oscillator is not zero; it is  1
2 ℏω, a guest 
appearance of the uncertainty principle, as shown in Problem  6.7 . Ground -
 state energy in this case is the energy at the equilibrium position around which 
the system oscillates or vibrates. 
 PROBLEM 6.7 
 Prove that the minimum energy allowed by the uncertainty principle for a harmonic 
oscillator is  1
2 ℏω . 
 Solution: 
 According to the uncertainty principle there is always (even in the ground state) 
an uncertainty of   Δ x and an uncertainty of   Δ p in the simultaneous measurement of 
position and momentum, respectively. 

242  
THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 Therefore minimum kinetic energy  =  Δ p 2 /2 m 
 Minimum potential energy  =  κ Δ x 2 /2 
 You also know from your introductory physics course that average kinetic 
energy of a harmonic oscillator over the range of motion is equal to the average 
potential energy.

 Hence, the proof. 
 In the atomic and molecular world, this solution is a reality and not just a 
theoretical play of quantum mechanics. For example, atoms in a molecule 
vibrate and as a result the bond length between them periodically increases 
and decreases around an equilibrium value. As we will explore in Chapters  9 
and  10 , molecules also have a vibrational energy corresponding to these vibra-
tions in addition to the translational and rotational energies corresponding 
to translational and rotational motion. As another example, the nonzero 
ground - state energy for  2
4He is large enough so that liquid  2
4He does not freeze 
at atmospheric pressure regardless of how cold the system gets. This is because 
of the harmonic oscillation nature of these molecules. Only quantum mechan-
ics can explain the nonzero ground state, and hence why helium does not 
freeze. 
 

UNDERSTANDING THE WAVE FUNCTIONS OF A HARMONIC OSCILLATOR  243
 Caution :  Note a difference in the quantum numbers of harmonic oscillators from 
those of a particle in a box:  n  =  0 is allowed for a harmonic oscillator and not 
allowed for a particle in a box. However, in either case the ground energy is a 
nonzero energy. 
 As shown in Study Checkpoint  6.9 , Eq.  6.36 has Planck ’ s law of radiation 
embedded in it. Although this exhibits the power of the Schr ö dinger equation, 
it should not come as a surprise because emission of radiation at both the 
atomic and at the molecular level can be considered as an act of oscillation: 
each oscillator representing a mode of EM wave of speciﬁ c frequency.

 As you learned in Chapter  5 , the wave function of a system contains all the 
information about the system. So, let us take a closer look at the wave func-
tions of a harmonic oscillator that we have obtained from the wave equation 
of the oscillator.

THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 In Section  6.6 , we explained the different terms involved in the solutions. 
Now, let us take a closer look at the wave functions represented by these 
solutions. 
 First, these wave functions and the associated energy (presented in Section 
 6.6 ) qualify to be called eigenfunctions and energy eigenvalues, discussed in 
Chapter  5 (e.g., Section  5.7 ). The energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for 
the ﬁ rst few quantum numbers ( n ) are shown in Table  6.1 . As demonstrated 
in Problem  6.8 for  n  =  0, these functions are normalized to unity, that is, the 
probability of ﬁ nding the oscillator somewhere along the oscillating path is 1. 
 Note from Table  6.1 that the wave function for  n  =  0 is a simple exponential 
function of the square of the displacement of the particle from its equilibrium 
positions. However, for higher quantum states, that is, higher values of  n , the 
wave functions get more and more sophisticated, and hence more interesting. 
To help you visualize these wave functions, Figures  6.9 – 6.11 present the plots 
of these for  n  =  0 – 5. Note from these ﬁ gures that as the value of  n increases, 
the wave function gets more spread out. You can imagine that as  n approaches 
inﬁ nity (the classical limit), the ﬂ uctuations in the wave function will vanish 
and the quantum mechanical oscillator will behave like a classical oscillator; 
the correspondence principle.

 In Figures  6.9 – 6.11 , corresponding to each wave function   Ψ n , |  Ψ n | 2 is also 
plotted, which represents the probability of ﬁ nding the particle at a given 
displacement  x . All these functions are plotted against the displacement  x of 
the oscillator from its equilibrium position shown along the  x - axis in units of 
 1/ α . This is just another way of saying that the wave function (and probabil-
ity densities) are plotted as a function of  αx. 
 Note from these plots that when the oscillator is in its ground state, that is, 
the lowest energy state ( n  =  0), the probability of ﬁ nding it at its equilibrium 
position ( x  =  0) is maximum. This is contradictory to classical physics, which 
predicts, as shown in Figure  6.8 , that the probability of ﬁ nding the oscillator is 
maximum at the end points of oscillation where the particle moves slowly, and

is least likely around the equilibrium position ( x  =  0) through which it passes 
quickly. However, as the plots demonstrate, this disagreement with classical 
physics becomes less and less marked as the value of quantum number  n 
increases, again in accordance with the correspondence principle. 
 Next, in Section  6.8 , we make a more detailed comparison of the quantum 
mechanical oscillator with the classical oscillator in order to realize the cor-
respondence principle. 
 6.8  COMPARING QUANTUM MECHANICAL OSCILLATOR WITH 
CLASSICAL OSCILLATOR 
 Let us clarify the terminology. First, let us make it clear that the classical oscil-
lator refers to the description and prediction of an oscillator by classical 
mechanics, whereas quantum mechanical oscillator refers to the description 
and predictions of the same oscillator by quantum mechanics. In this section, 
we compare the probability densities of both classical and quantum oscillators 
with each other. 
 From Eq.  6.38 , you see that the scaling constant involved in the quantum 
mechanical probability density is   α , whereas in the constant involved in the

 As Figure  6.12 demonstrates, the classical and quantum approach are pretty 
much in opposition to eachother. When the quantum mechanical oscillator is 
in its ground state, that is, the lowest energy state ( n  =  0), the probability of 
ﬁ nding it at its equilibrium position ( x  =  0) is maximum. This is contradictory 
to the classical approach that predicts the probability of ﬁ nding the oscillator 
is maximum at the end points of oscillation, where the particle moves slowly, 
and it is least around the equilibrium position ( x  =    0) through which it passes 
quickly. However, as the plots in Section  6.7 demonstrate, this disagreement 
with classical physics becomes less and less marked as the value of the quantum 
number  n increases, again in accordance with the correspondence principle. 
 Figure  6.13 for  n  =  10 compared to Figure  6.12 for  n  =  0 clearly shows how 
the disagreement between the classical and quantum approaches is getting less 
and less marked. The probability density |  Ψ 10 | 2 when smoothed is indeed 
approaching  dP / dx . As  n increases the ﬂ uctuations in the quantum probability 
density getting more closely spaced, and hence their effect is getting weaker 
and their experimental observation is getting more difﬁ cult. From this, you can 
realize that for a large value of quantum number  n , quantum physics yields 
the same result as classical physics; the correspondence principle. 
 Also, note in Figures  6.12 and  6.13 that the classical probabilities just drop 
off to zero at the end points, whereas the quantum probabilities have expo-
nential tails there: a demonstration of tunneling. Also note that the exponen-
tial tails are getting smaller as  n increases and the classical and quantum 
approaches proceed toward agreement in the macroscopic world.

THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 Diatomic molecules, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) and carbon monoxide 
(CO), are good examples of systems that can be modeled to a harmonic oscil-
lator. The molecule is in equilibrium when the two atoms bonding together in 
the molecule are at a certain distance from each other where they have a 
minimum energy. A small displacement from their equilibrium positions 
increases the molecules energy and the atoms experience a restoring force that 
tries to push them back to the equilibrium position and harmonic oscillation 
begins. We will come back to this topic for molecules in Chapter  9 . 
 6.9  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 The most rigorous test of a model or a theory is to test its predictions. One of 
the most daring results of the predictions of the quantum theory of atomic 
structure was the transistor, which was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1947. 
Due to its low power consumption and small size, the transistor replaced the 
vacuum tube and made possible the sophisticated electrical circuits in micro-
processors, which started the electronics age, including the computer 
revolution. 
 To manipulate material and create devices at the microscale or macroscale 
level, by using the knowledge of what is happening at the nanoscale level, has 
been the basis of electronic revolution. By applying the laws of quantum 
physics, which is the physics of the microscale and nanoscale, we can even 
manipulate entities at the nanoscale level, such as molecules and atoms. This 
is also proof of the validity of quantum physics. If you can manipulate atoms 
a few at a time, it opens the door to a whole new era of electronics and other 
applications. Some examples are making circuits with atoms and creating 
special materials with special properties, such as extreme strength or 
conductivity.

LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD  251
 A specialized microscope called a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) 
uses the quantum mechanical effect called quantum tunneling, discussed in 
Section  6.4.5 , to observe and manipulate atoms. It means you can view a 
surface with atomic details to an unprecedented resolution of 0.1  nm, about 
the size of an atom, and move around the atoms at the surface. As an example, 
Figure  6.14 presents the electron corrals, a circle of ripples created by the 
electrons on the copper (Cu) surface. The IBM researchers built this corral by 
manipulating and positioning individual iron (Fe) atoms on a Cu surface by 
using STM. The atoms are arranged into a ring and the ripples in the ring are 
the wave patterns of the electrons that were trapped in the corral. 
 The point is that by understanding and using the laws of quantum physics, 
researchers and technologists are now able to manipulate matter atom by 
atom and molecule by molecule. This is what has given birth to the brave new 
world of nanotechnology.

THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF AN EQUATION 
 6.10  SUMMARY 
 The basic principles of quantum mechanics are built into the Schr ö dinger 
equation, which governs the dynamics of systems, such as electrons, atoms, and 
molecules. Almost all the salient features of quantum mechanics can be logi-
cally understood from the probabilistic nature of the solution of the Schr ö dinger 
equation. A particle in a box and a harmonic oscillator are two general situa-
tions to which an enormous number of structures and systems correspond in 
the real physical microscopic world. In this chapter, by applying the Schr ö dinger 
equation to these two situations, we witnessed some of the features of quantum 
mechanics naturally arising from solving the equation, such as uncertainty, and 
quantized states when the particle is conﬁ ned. 
 To some students, a harmonic oscillator and a particle in a box may still 
come across as rather abstract situations. But you will see in the forthcoming 
chapters how real physical systems can be modeled to correspond to these 
situations in order to solve problems. You have gained some experience in this 
chapter with the Schr ö dinger equation. 
 In Chapter  7 , we will demonstrate the power of the Schr ö dinger equation 
by applying it to a very simple, but real, physics system: The hydrogen atom 
that requires the full complexity of the 3D Schr ö dinger equation.

INTRODUCTION  255
 Atoms and molecules with unpaired electrons, called free radicals, are responsible for 
many diseases including old age. Their motion is governed by quantum mechanics. 
 Although a cell (the smallest unit of life) largely consists of four types of molecules 
(nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates), atoms and ions (atoms that have 
gained or lost one or more electrons) play a crucial role inside an organism. For 
example, many chemical reactions in biological systems involve a proton (H  +  ) transfer, 
and therefore their rates depend on the concentrations of H  +  . Because the correct rate 
of these reactions is crucial to maintain life, the wrong H  +  concentration can result in 
illness and even death. 
 A free radical is another example. It is any atom or molecule that has a single 
unpaired electron in an orbital of its outer shell. An orbital needs two electrons to 
be complete, and the atom experiences instability due to the lack of a missing elec-
tron. In order to gain stability, the atom (free radical) has a very strong tendency to 
rip an electron from neighboring atoms and molecules. So, most biologically relevant 
free radicals are highly reactive, and therefore they can participate in unwanted side 
reactions resulting in cell damage and even deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. 
The free radical theory of aging states that organisms age because cells accumulate 
damage caused by free radical over time. Furthermore, damage caused by free radicals 
has also been linked to a large number of diseases, including Alzheimer ’ s disease, 
arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, heart attack, and Parkinson ’ s disease. 
 In order to understand and control free radicals, you need to understand that their 
motion is governed by quantum mechanics.

 7.1  INTRODUCTION 
 The origin of the name atom comes from the Greek word atoms, which means 
uncuttable or indivisible: something that cannot be divided further. Ancient 
Greek philosophers, such as Democritus (460 – 370 BC), believed that matter 
must be made up of some fundamental stuff they called atoms. It took centu-
ries after that to scientiﬁ cally prove what we know today, that all known mater 

256  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOM 
in the universe (living or dead) is made up of atoms, and the atom is made 
up of a dense central nucleus that contains positively charged protons and 
possibly electrically neutral neutrons, surrounded by a cloud of negatively 
charged electrons. Because an atom itself is made up of these subatomic par-
ticles, it is not indivisible. However, it remains true that an atom is the smallest 
building block of a chemical substance. 
 This explanation shows how important it is to understand an atom in 
order to understand the universe and its physical systems including living 
organisms. Quantum mechanics has played an epochal role in the under-
standing of the universe by providing us insight into the atom. Starting with 
replacing our classical approach, which did not work, with a quantum 
approach to atomic phenomena, led us to understand other related phenom-
ena as well, such as the explanation of the periodic table of elements, how 
the atoms combine to make molecules and crystals, and how the substances 
made of molecules develop certain electric, magnetic, and mechanical 
characteristics. 
 In Chapter  4 , you learned how Bohr ’ s model explained the line spectra 
emitted by atoms. Even though it was the ﬁ rst quantum mechanical (or pseu-
doquantum mechanical) model, it did not explain the existence of stationary 
states and hence the quantum number; it just assumed them. Now that we have 
the Schr ö dinger equation, we will see how stationary states naturally arise 
from it. 
 The hydrogen atom, being the smallest atom, and hence the simplest to 
study, has been used for experimental studies more than any other atom. So, 
it should not come as a surprise that we begin this chapter with the hydrogen 
atom. Yes, this means applying the Schr ö dinger equation to the hydrogen 
atom. In doing so, we will demonstrate how most of the postulates put 
forward by Bohr and others to explain the experimental results can be natu-
rally derived from quantum theory, that is, the Schr ö dinger equation. For 
example, you will see how the spectral lines discussed in Chapter  4 are natu-
rally predicted by quantization that results from solving the Schr ö dinger 
equation. In fact, it took quantum mechanics to explain why there could be 
atoms at all. Recall from Chapter  4 that in the classical model of the atom 
with electrons revolving around a positive nuclei, there is nothing to stop 
them from collapsing, since positive and negative charges attract. 
 You will see that three quantum numbers, which emerge naturally when we 
try to solve the Schr ö dinger equation for the hydrogen atom, deﬁ ne the state 
of the hydrogen atom. We will explore the physical meaning of those quantum 
numbers. We will also explore what quantum theory predicts about the loca-
tion of an electron in the atom. So, the major question in this chapter is How 
can the quantum theory in the form of the Schr ö dinger equation be used to 
explore a simple atom? To answer that question, we will explore three avenues: 
applying the Schr ö dinger equation to the hydrogen atom, quantum numbers 
of an atom and their physical meanings, and locating an electron inside an 
atom. 

APPLYING THE SCHRÖDINGER EQUATION TO THE HYDROGEN ATOM  257
 7.2  APPLYING THE SCHR Ö DINGER EQUATION TO THE 
HYDROGEN ATOM 
 In this section, we will set up the Schr ö dinger equation for the hydrogen atom. 
First realize that an atom of any element overall has a zero net charge because 
it has an equal number of protons in the nucleus and the electrons around the 
nucleus. When an atom acquires a positive or a negative charge by losing an 
electron or by gaining an electron, respectively, it is called an ion; a cation if 
it has acquired a positive charge, or an anion if it has acquired a negative 
charge. 
 To set up the Schr ö dinger equation for the hydrogen atom, we need to 
determine the form of the potential energy (or potential) term,  V , in the 
equation. A hydrogen atom consists of a proton with electric charge  + e and 
an electron with electric charge  − e . Therefore, the potential energy of this 
system is provided by the electrostatic force between the proton and the 
electron and is called the electrostatic potential. Because a proton is much 
heavier than an electron (the mass ratio of a proton to an electron is 2000) it 
can be considered stationary as compared to the electron, which is moving 
around in the vicinity of the proton. As shown in Problem  7.1 , the potential 
of the hydrogen atom is given by

where  ε 0 , the permittivity of vacuum, is a constant with the value of 
8.854  ×  10  − 12  C 2 /N m 2 ; you have already met this constant in Section  1.13 . 
 PROBLEM 7.1 
 Derive the equation for the potential shown in Eq.  7.1 . 
 Solution: 
 Consider an electron with charge  − e at a distance  r from a proton (nucleus of the

 This equation can be considered to represent the hydrogen atom with a poten-
tial  V given by Eq.  7.1 . However, this potential is a function of  r that is part 
of the spherical polar coordinates, whereas the rest of the equation is in terms 
of Cartesian coordinates:  x, y, z . To make the whole equation consistent, we 
can either express  V in terms of Cartesian coordinates or transform the rest 
of the equation into polar coordinates. To take advantage of the radial sym-
metry of the hydrogen atom, and end up with simpler and more intuitive 
equations, we decide to transform Eq.  7.2 into spherical polar coordinates: 
 r ,   θ ,  φ . To make this transformation, we need to know the relationship between 
the spherical polar coordinates and the Cartesian coordinates, which is illus-
trated in Figure  7.1 , from which we write the following equations:

 Equation  7.5 represents the hydrogen atom. In other words, it represents the 
dynamics of the electron in the hydrogen atom. In this equation,   Ψ is a func-
tion of  r ,  θ ,  φ as in  Ψ ( r ,   θ ,  φ ), but we will denote it as   Ψ for brevity. 
 So, we have set up the Schr ö dinger equation for the hydrogen atom. 
The predictions of the quantum theory (i.e., quantum mechanics) about 
the hydrogen atom will appear when you try to solve this Schr ö dinger 
equation.  
 7.3  SOLVING THE SCHR Ö DINGER EQUATION FOR 
THE HYDROGEN ATOM 
 The solution to the Schr ö dinger equation written in polar coordinates will in 
general depend on the polar coordinates:  r ,  θ , and   φ . To solve this equation 
and to understand the solutions, it is convenient to use the method of separa-
tion of variables. 
 7.3.1  Separating the Variables in the Schr ö dinger Equation 
 In an attempt to solve the equation, we would like to separate the variables  r , 
 θ ,   φ . In other words, we want to look for the solution of this equation that can 
be written as a product of three functions, each of which depends on only one 
of the coordinates  r ,  θ ,  φ , as shown in the following:

 (7.8) 
 If you look closely at Eq.  7.8 , you will notice that the right - hand side (rhs) 
of the equation only depends on the variable   φ , and the left - hand side (lhs) 
depends only on  r and   θ . This means that the lhs will not change with the 
change in  φ , and the rhs will not change with the change in  r or   θ ; yet both 
sides are equal to each other. That means both sides are equal to a constant, 
that is, something independent of  r ,   θ ,   φ . Let us call this constant  ml
2 for reasons 
that will become apparent later on in this chapter. Equating the rhs of Eq.  7.8

will become apparent further on in this chapter. This yields the following 
two equations: 
 Note :  The reason for choosing these two constants in the form of  ml

 Equation  7.10 is called the angular equation, and Eq.  7.11 is called the radial 
equation. We changed the partial derivatives to ordinary derivatives because 
 R depends only on  r and   Θ depends only on   θ . So, we have separated the 
Schr ö dinger equation into three separate differential equations, each depend-
ing only on one  r ,  θ ,   φ . Note that only the equation for  R (Eq.  7.11 ), called the 
radial equation, depends on the potential energy. 
 Now, let us examine the azimuthal, angular, and radial equations for their 
solutions. 
 7.3.2  Solution of the Azimuthal Equation 
 The azimuthal equation (Eq.  7.9 ), the simplest of the three equations (Eqs. 
 7.9 – 7.11), is rewritten here:

 Recognize from Section  6.6 that this is an equation of a harmonic oscillator, 
and therefore its solution can be written in sines and cosines or equivalently 
as an exponential function. We conveniently choose the following solution:
 
 Φ = Aeimlφ  
 (7.12) 
 This solution involves two constants  A and  m l that need to be determined. 
As Problem 7.4 demonstrates, the normalization condition requires that 
 A =

solution:
 
 Φ =

 You can verify it by directly substituting this solution into Eq.  7.9 . Let us 
look at the solution closely in order to determine the value of the constant  m l .

 So, we have determined the possible values of the constant  m l . The constant

part of the Schr ö dinger equation for a meaningful physical solution has given 
rise to certain permissible values of  m l , which are discrete values. In other 
words  m l , is a quantum number. 
 
 Note :  The magnetic quantum number,  m l , determines the energy shift of an atomic 
orbital due to an external magnetic ﬁ eld, hence the term  magnetic  in the name. You 
will learn more about it later in this book. 
 Now, let us turn our attention to the angular wave equation (Eq.  7.10 ).

 Note that this equation contains both  l and  m l . We showed how the require-
ment for a physical solution for the azimuthal equation gave rise to the quan-
tization of  m l . It turns out that the angular equation (Eq.  7.10 ) will have a 
physical solution if  l is an integer equal to or greater than the absolute value 
of  m l , | m l |. This requirement puts a further constraint on the values of  m l , as 
shown in the following:

example, 1 for  l and 1 or  − 1 for  m l . Similarly, you can verify that  (

is a solution for  l  =  1,  m l  =  0. 
 Now, let us consider Eq.  7.11 for the radial part,  R ( r ), of the wave function 
 Ψ .

 Note that this is the equation that contains the total energy  E and the

orbital quantum number  l . If you have some experience in solving differential

 Again, recall from Chapter  4 (Eq.  4.6 a) that is equivalent to Bohr ’ s result 
for the ground - state energy for the hydrogen atom. Notice, as we will discuss 
later, the results of Bohr ’ s theory naturally arise from these simple solutions 
of the Schr ö dinger equation. 
 We have just shown how a simple solution to Eq.  7.11 gives rise to Bohr ’ s 
radius. In general, it turns out that this equation will have a solution if the 
following two requirements are met.

where  n is a positive integer, that is,  n  =  1, 2, 3,  · · · 
 2.  The value of  n must be  ≥ ( l  +  1), where  l is the orbital quantum number. 
In other words,  l must be  < n . This means the following:

 So, for a given value of  n , you can determine the possible values of  l and  m l . 
 A negative value of  E n means the electron is bound to the nucleus in the atom. 
Note that Eq.  7.16 for energy  E is identical with that obtained from Bohr ’ s 
atomic model, covered in Chapter  4 . Also note that the Schr ö dinger equation 
has yielded three quantum numbers from 3Ds of motion. As mentioned above, 
the values of these quantum numbers are constrained by the following: 
 Principal quantum number:  n  =  1, 2, 3,  · · · 
 Orbital quantum number:  l  =  0, 1, 2, 3,  · · · , ( n  −  1) 
 Magnetic quantum number:  m l  =  0,  ± 1,  ± 2,  ± 3,  · · · ,  ± l 
 
 Note :  Note that quantum numbers  n ,  l , and  m l appeared naturally from the condi-
tion that the electron is bound to the atom. Again, a reminder that quantum 
numbers appear for particles conﬁ ned to speciﬁ c regions in space. 
 Although for sake of simplicity we have not shown the details for solving 
the Schr ö dinger equation, we have shown what the simple solutions for the

azimuthal, angular, and radial parts look like and how they lead to important 
results. Let us take a look at what the general solutions look like.

 R nl ,  Θlml,  Φml are presented in Table  7.1 for ﬁ rst few values of  n ,  l ,  m l . 
Corresponding to each row in this table, you can write a function   Ψ ( r ,   θ ,   φ )

 In Table  7.1 , why are the expressions for  R ( r ) identical for ( n ,  l ,  m )  =  (3, 1, 0) and 
(3, 1, 1)? 
 Solution: 
 Because  R varies with only  n and  l ; and ( n ,  l ) values for both of the given cases are 
identical. 
 Instead of getting overwhelmed with the functions presented in Table  7.1 , 
let us have fun by making sense of them. First, note that the azimuthal and 
angular solutions are rather simple, whereas the radial solutions start of being 
simple for ( n ,  l )  =  (1, 0), and quickly become more sophisticated for higher

represent various quantum states of the electron in a hydrogen atom. Being 
more interesting, the radial wave functions (solutions) are plotted in Figure 
 7.2 . Figure  7.2 a presents the wave function corresponding to the 1s state of 
the electron, that is,  n  =  1 and  l  =  0, whereas Figure  7.2 b presents the wave 
functions for the 2s ( n  =  2,  l  =  0), and 2p ( n  =  2,  l  =  1) states. The wave func-
tions for the 3s ( n  =  3,  l  =  0), 3p ( n  =  3,  l  =  1), and 3d ( n  =  3,  l  =  2) states are 
presented in Figure  7.2 c . All wave functions are plotted against the atomic 
radius  r in units of the Bohr radius  a 0 . 
 Note from Figure  7.2 that the wave function  R is maximum at  r  =  0, that is 
at the nucleus, for all s ( l  =  0) states, whereas its value is zero at  r  =  0 for p, d, 
and f states, which have a nonzero value for  l , and hence for angular 
momentum.

 STUDY CHECKPOINT 7.4 
 The radial wave function  R is maximum at  r  =  0 for the s state. Because the wave 
function represents the probability of ﬁ nding the particle, does it mean that the 
electron in the hydrogen atom can be found in the nucleus? 
 Solution: 
 The answer is no. 
 Yes, we usually say that the wave function of a particle represents the probability 
of ﬁ nding the particle. However, strictly speaking, the probability density for ﬁ nding 
the particle is proportional to the square of the mod of the function, that is, | R | 2 in 
this case. 
 You will see in Section  7.4 that the probability density for ﬁ nding the electron 
along the atomic radius is actually  r 2 | R | 2 . 

270  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOM 
 Now that these functions make sense, let us get a bit more ambitious in 
understanding them. You know that the wave function of a particle represents 
the probability of ﬁ nding the particle. So, let us ask a question What do these 
functions tell us about where the electron is in the hydrogen atom?  
 7.4  FINDING THE ELECTRON 
 As you learned in Chapter  4 , according to the Bohr ’ s model, electrons in 
an atom orbit around the nucleus with a well - deﬁ ned radius  r . For example, 
the radius of the innermost orbit is  a 0 , where the electron in a ground - state 
hydrogen atom will be found. However, in quantum theory, you can 
only talk about the probability of ﬁ nding the electron and no deﬁ nite 
values of  r ,  θ , and   φ about the location of the electron can be predicted: 
an expression of the wave nature of the electron and the uncertainty principle. 
The probability density of ﬁ nding the electron with wave function   Ψ is given 
by | Ψ | 2 . 
 Furthermore, contrary to Bohr ’ s model, we cannot think of an electron as 
revolving around the nucleus in an atom in any conventional sense because 
| Ψ | 2 is independent of time and varies over space. 
 We already have a wealth of wave functions for the electron in the hydrogen 
atom that we examined in Table  7.1 . Let us see how we can use these wave 
functions to examine the probabilities of ﬁ nding the electron at various places 
inside the atom. 
 Let us start with looking for the electron around the  z - axis, that is, along 
the azimuthal direction by varying the azimuthal angle   φ . Using the azimuthal 
wave function from Section  7.3.5 , the azimuthal probability density can be 
written as:
 Φ

=
=
−
Ae

where  A is a constant. 
 Therefore, the probability of ﬁ nding the electron at any azimuthal angle   φ 
is a constant. In other words, the electron ’ s probability density is symmetric 
around the  z - axis regardless of the quantum state of the electron. The electron 
is equally likely to be found at any azimuthal angle. This result is interesting, 
indeed. 
 Now let us try to ﬁ nd the electron along the radius of the atom. In other 
words, how does the probability of ﬁ nding the electron change as we move 
away from the nucleus of the atom. In general, the probability  dP of ﬁ nding 
the electron in a differential volume element  dV is given by

 r  +  dr as:

 (7.21) 
 In during Eq.  7.21 we have used the fact that   Θ (  θ ) and   Φ ( φ ) are normalized 
functions, that is, there integrals are equal to 1. Note from Eq.  7.21 , that 
although the electron wave function for s states, as we noted in Section  7.3.5 , 
is maximum at the nucleus ( r  =  0), the probability density is still zero here due 
to the term  r 2 . Hence, the Schr ö dinger equation saves the electron from col-
lapsing into the nucleus. To help you visualize where this electron spends most 
of its time in the atom around the nucleus, we have plotted the probability 
density presented in Eq.  7.21 in Figure  7.3 for all the quantum states for which 
we plotted the wave functions in Section  7.3.5 . Note from Figure  7.3 that the 
probability density,  P , for the s states is zero at the nucleus and is maximum 
when it is closer to the nucleus, but at a certain distance from it. Precisely 
speaking, the maximum  P for the 1s state is exactly at  r  =  a 0 , the Bohr radius. 
Note that the probability distributions are different for different quantum 
states, as they are epected to be. 
 As an example, consider the hydrogen atom in its ground state. From Table 
 7.1 , the wave function of the electron in this atom is given by

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOM 
 Recall that  a 0 is the Bohr radius with the value of 0.529  Å . 
 As Problem 7.9 shows the total energy of the electron will be equal to its 
potential energy at  r  =  2 a 0 . Therefore, thinking in terms of classical mechanics, 
this is the maximum radius an electron in the hydrogen atom can have. In 
other words, the electron cannot exist outside the sphere of radius 2 a 0 with a 
proton at the center. However, as Problem 7.9 demonstrates, according to 
quantum mechanics there is a signiﬁ cant probability that an electron can be 
found outside this sphere. Although we are using the hydrogen atom as an 
example here, this result is very general. This is one of the very important 
points that distinguishes quantum mechanics from classical mechanics: You 
can ﬁ nd particles where Newtonian physics says they cannot go. Think of the 
implications of this while trying to understand the various phenomena in 
chemistry and biology at the molecular and particle level. For example, think 
of ions passing through membranes to carry information through the nervous 
system of our bodies, electrons and protons in motion in the body cells facili-
tating necessary processes, such as formation of energy to keep us alive and 
moving. And the motion of these particles is governed by quantum mechanics. 
So you can see that, if Newtonian physics were governing in the microworld 
instead of quantum mechanics, we would be living in a very different 
macroworld. 
 The beauty of the Schr ö dinger equation is that it generates quantum 
numbers naturally. As you have seen when we solve the Schr ö dinger equation 
for the hydrogen atom, we obtain three quantum numbers that are integers

and have a relationship with each other. But, what do these quantum numbers 
really represent? In other words, what is their physical signiﬁ cance? 
 7.5  UNDERSTANDING THE QUANTUM NUMBERS 
 As you saw in Section  7.3 , three quantum numbers  n ,  l , and  m l arise naturally 
while attempting to solve the 3D Schr ö dinger equation for the hydrogen atom. 
What these numbers mean is that the atom can only be in a state that is deﬁ ned 
by this triplet. In other words, the set of states for the hydrogen atom is 
determined by the set of triplet quantum numbers ( n ,  l ,  m l ). Furthermore, the 
solutions to the Schr ö dinger equation require that the three quantum numbers 
are integers and their values are constrained by the following conditions:

 (7.23) 
 Put in this form, note that the principal quantum number  n is the only 
quantum number that does not depend on any other quantum number. So we 
begin our discussion with this quantum number. 
 7.5.1  The Principal Quantum Number and Energy Radiations 
 As mentioned earlier, the principal quantum number  n arises when we try to 
solve the radial wave equation for the hydrogen atom, Eq.  7.11 . As in the case 
of a particle in a box and a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy that rep-
resents the conﬁ nement of the particle also quantizes its energy. One of the 
conditions for the radial equation to have a solution is

 (7.24) 
 Presenting a detailed method to solve the radial wave equation is beyond 
the scope of this book. However, we can verify that Eq.  7.17 is true for the 
ground state that is  n  =  1 and  l  =  0. As shown in Table  7.1 , the solution for the 
radial wave equation for the ground state ( n  =  1,  l  =  0) is

 This is exactly Eq.  7.24 for  n  =  1. 
 So, this formula for quantized energy that Bohr obtained from the classical 
approach by postulating the principal quantum number  n , arises naturally 
from the Schr ö dinger equation. The Bohr model also postulates that as long 
as an electron is in this state (value of  n ), it does not radiate any energy, and 
it radiates or absorbs energy when it jumps from one state to another. Can we 
derive this postulate from the Schr ö dinger equation as well? The answer is 
yes, and we demonstrate it next. 
 In Section  6.2 , we showed that the following will be a valid solution for the 
time - dependent Schr ö dinger equation:

 Equation  7.28 shows that the expectation value of  x is independent of time. 
This means that the electron in a speciﬁ c state does not oscillate, and therefore 
does not radiate. This is a postulate of Bohr ’ s model that comes here naturally 
from quantum theory. Now consider the case that the electron transitions from 
state  n to the excited state  m and then jumps back to state  n . During the time 
the electron is transitioning from state  m to the state  n , it can be found in 
either of these two states with some probability. Therefore, the wave function 
 ψ of the electron can be written as follows:

where  a *  a  (modules of  a 2 ) is the probability that the electron is in state  m and 
 b * b (modules of  b 2 ) is the probability that it is in state  n . 
 The expectation value of  x during this transition can be written as 
follows:

 This means that when the electron is in the process of transitioning from

lating electron acts like an electric dipole and therefore emits EM radiation 
of frequency  f . So quantum theory naturally predicts the following: 
 1.   An electron in the hydrogen atom in a speciﬁ c state does not radiate any 
energy. 
 2.  An electron transitioning from an excited state  m to lower state  n radi-
ates energy given by the following:

 You saw in Section  4.6.1 that these were the postulates of the Bohr model to

theory predicts these results in a natural fashion. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 7.5 
 What will be the energy difference between the following ( n ,  l ,  m l ) states of the 
hydrogen atom? 
 (2, 0, 0), (2, 1, 0), (2, 1,  − 1), (2, 1, 1) 
 Solution: 
 The energy for all these states will be the same because the energy only depends 
on the principal quantum number  n , which is the same for all of these states. 
 So, the principal quantum number deﬁ nes the stationary states of the elec-
tron in the atom by determining and quantizing its energy. What is the orbital 
quantum number good for? 
 7.5.2  The Orbital Quantum Number 
 As you witnessed earlier in this chapter, the orbital quantum number  l arises 
from the radial and angular part of the Schr ö dinger equation and its wave 
function:  R ( r ) and  Θ ( θ ). We will show that this quantum number is related to 
the angular momentum. This angular momentum of the atom exists as the 
oppositely charged electron and proton in the hydrogen atom move around 
each other. 
  7.5.2.1   Physical Meaning of the Orbital Quantum Number.    Let us draw 
the physical meaning of the orbital quantum number from the radial 
Schr ö dinger equation of the hydrogen atom:

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOM 
 Because  l is an integer, the angular momentum of the electron is quantized 
just like the energy. Again we have obtained a principle from quantum mechan-
ics that Bohr ’ s model postulated to explain experimental results: orbital 
momentum is quantized. However, in this case, quantum mechanics disagrees 
with Bohr ’ s model on the detail. In Bohr ’ s model, the quantization is given by 
 L  =  n ħ , whereas quantum theory predicts  L  =  l ( l  +  1) ħ . This is a demonstration 
of how quantum theory goes beyond Bohr ’ s semiclassical planet - like model 
of electrons orbiting the nucleus. As shown in Problem  7.2 , for an electron 
with  l  =  3,  L  =  3.67  ×  10  − 34  J s. Compare it with 2.66  ×  10 40  J s as the angular 
momentum of Earth around the Sun, as calculated in Problem 7.6.

 You must have already seen these quantum numbers in chemistry. 
  7.5.2.2   Making the Connection with Chemistry.    It is common, especially in 
chemistry, to denote angular quantum number values in letters: s for  l  =  0, p 
for  l  =  1, d for  l  =  2, and so on. Table  7.2 presents the atomic electron states 
for the ﬁ rst few ( n ,  l ) values in the terminology used in chemistry. Because the 
energy of an electron in the atom only depends on  n , it is also called the prin-
cipal energy level, and accordingly  l states are called sublevels. Note that the 
number of sublevels is equal to the principal quantum number. The sublevels 
that appear in bold in Table  7.2 are not needed by the elements that are pres-
ently known. We will continue this exploration in Chapter  8 when we discuss 
the periodic table of elements in the context of quantum mechanics. 
 
 Note :  Our discussion of quantum numbers here is not limited to the hydrogen atom. 
This applies to electrons in any atom, and also to any particle or body that is con-
ﬁ ned in a certain region by a potential and has a radial and orbital motion. 

UNDERSTANDING THE QUANTUM NUMBERS  279
 For now, however, realize that these quantum numbers  n , and  s ,  p ,  d ,  f for a 
given  n represent the quantum states (wave functions) of the electrons in the 
atom. As you already know that the square of the magnitude of the wave 
function represents the probability of ﬁ nding the particle in the state repre-
sented by the wave function. Figure  7.4 illustrates the probability densities of 
an electron in a hydrogen atom. Brighter areas correspond to higher probabil-
ity density. Also, the electron in the atom possesses discrete energy levels with 
energy increasing from the top of the ﬁ gure to the bottom with increasing 
 n  =  1, 2, 3  · · · . Angular momentum increases from left to right in the ﬁ gure. 
 So, the orbital quantum number determines the magnitude of the angular 
momentum of the electron and quantizes it. However, because angular

quantum number. 
 7.5.3  Magnetic Quantum Number 
 The magnetic quantum number  m l arises from solving the azimuthal part of 
the Schr ö dinger equation of the hydrogen atom to determine the wave func-
tion  Φml ( )
φ . The angle   φ is a measure of rotation of the electron along the  z -
 axis. It turns out that the solution  Φml ( )
φ  of the Schr ö dinger equation requires 
that  m l is an integer and satisﬁ es the following conditions:

 Condition 7.34 is called space quantization. This means the possible values of 
 L z corresponding to a value of  l range from  – l to  + l in steps of 1, for a total 
of 2 l  +  1 allowed values. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 7.6 
 What are the possible values of the magnetic quantum number  m l for an electron 
in an atom whose orbital quantum number  l is 3? 
 Solution: 
 m l  =  − 3,  − 2,  − 1, 0, 1, 2, 3

and   Φ is an eigenfunction of the angular momentum operator  ˆLz. It means 
that the angular momentum is quantized along one direction in space. The 
choice of  z to be in that direction is a matter of convenience. Regardless of 
which direction we choose for quantization, the result will be  m l ħ . If the atom 
is inside a magnetic ﬁ eld, the  z - axis is chosen to be along the direction of that 
ﬁ eld. That is why  m l is called the magnetic quantum number.

 In a nutshell, we have obtained three quantum numbers of the electron in 
a hydrogen atom in an attempt to solve the Schr ö dinger equation for it. 
 In this chapter, we have used the hydrogen atom to demonstrate the power 
of the Schr ö dinger equation. Just because the hydrogen atom is the simplest 
atom does not diminish its importance. Although we used the hydrogen atom 

282  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF AN ATOM 
in this chapter to demonstrate some general features of quantum mechanics, 
understanding the quantum mechanics of hydrogen by virtue of the hydrogen 
atom itself can be very useful as well, the reason is because hydrogen and its 
ions and bonds have enormous use in biology and chemistry. 
 7.6  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HYDROGEN 
 An incredibly large amount of chemistry can be understood in terms of acid –
 base reactions, the reactions that involve the transfer of H  +  ions from one 
substance to another. An acid is a substance, a molecule or an ion, that donates 
an H  +  ion and a base is a substance that accepts an H  +  ion. The beauty of the 
hydrogen atom is that its ion, H  +  , is simply a proton. 
 Acids and bases play an important role in numerous chemical reactions or 
processes occurring almost everywhere: from industry to environment, to 
inside our body. For example, the ability of aquatic environment to support 
ﬁ sh or plant life depends on the right degree of acidity in the environment. If 
the acidity in our body is not maintained within a certain narrow range, we 
cannot stay alive. Inside living organisms, many biological reactions involve 
proton transfer, and therefore the reaction rate depends on the concentration 
of H  +  . To keep the organisms healthy and alive, these reactions must occur at 
certain rates. In other words, the wrong concentration of H  +  will cause illness 
or even death. 
 7.7  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 So far in this book, you have studied the basic postulates of the theory of 
quantum mechanics. You also learned about the Schr ö dinger equation that 
describes the dynamics of a physical system at the microscopic level. In the 
microscopic world, quantum mechanics replaces the classical (Newtonian) 
mechanics. That underlies the importance of these postulates largely built into 
the Schr ö dinger equation. When you think of these quantum mechanic postu-
lates or the Schr ö dinger equation, think of the DNA molecule, and think of 
the whole machinery at work in each cell of your body turning carbohydrate 
molecules into energy and amino acid molecules into protein molecules fol-
lowing the instructions coded in the DNA molecule (illustrated in Fig.  7.5 ): 
The two strands of the DNA molecule are held together by hydrogen bonds. 
Think of the neurons carrying the message from your eyes to your brain while 
you are reading this book. One may argue that these molecules are big enough 
to be treated as classical objects. Then, how about the anatomy and inner 
dynamics of these molecules? How about the fundamental particles directly 
involved in helping these molecules perform their jobs. The point is that 
quantum mechanics is at work around this area. 

LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD  283
 The DNA molecule, discussed in more detail in Chapter  11 , contains the 
code according to which proteins in the cell are made. Let us explore an 
example related to the topic at hand. The DNA mutations, the errors in the 
sequence of DNA, are mostly generated during DNA replication, as illustrated 
in Figure  7.6 . These mutations are sources of many diseases and provide the 
raw material for evolution. An enzyme called DNA polymerase, makes a copy 
of the already existing DNA. Occasionally, during the process of making the 
new DNA strand, DNA polymerase makes a mistake, such as insert the wrong 
base, miss to insert a base, or insert an additional base. There can be several 
reasons for these errors including exposure to radiation and hazardous chemi-
cals. We can do something about sources of errors, such as radiation and 
chemicals, but there is nothing we can do about errors or mutations arising 
from the quantum nature of the DNA code, at least not until we understand 
them in their terms: the quantum terms. These errors arise from the uncer-
tainty principle at action during replication. It is believed that these mutations 
may be initiated by motion of a proton from one site in the DNA molecule 
to another, a process called tautomerism. The proton will exist as a superposi-
tion of both (initial and ﬁ nal) position states, and this uncertainty will result 
in mutation. 
 Just as in the macroscopic world, the beneﬁ ts of understanding the laws at 
work in the microscopic world of life are enormous. By using quantum mechan-
ics, we can understand the functioning of life at a molecular level by probing 
the structure and dynamics of the molecules of life, such as nucleic acids (DNA 
and RNA), proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. The knowledge obtained from 
this understanding can have an endless array of applications in the ﬁ elds of 
medicine, biotechnology, bioengineering, and can even give rise to new ﬁ elds.

SUMMARY  285
using the case of the hydrogen atom, we have shown how quantum mechanics 
naturally predicts some principles that were empirically postulated by Bohr 
and others to explain the experimental data in the absence of the theory. 
The requirement of having meaningful solutions for the equation gives rise 
to three quantum numbers: the principal quantum number  n , the orbital 
quantum number  l , and the magnetic quantum number  m l . This theory 
predicts that these quantum numbers are integers and meet the following 
conditions:

 The principal quantum number  n appears from the radial part of the 
Schr ö dinger equation, which must satisfy the following conditions to have a

where  E n is the energy of the electron in the atom with quantum number  n . 
The electron with a speciﬁ c quantum number  n is said to be in a stationary 
energy level  E n . It is called the stationary energy state because quantum theory 
predicts that the electron will not emit any radiation while it is in this energy 
state. Furthermore, quantum theory predicts that when the electron jumps 
from a higher state  m to a lower state  n , it emits radiation that is equal to 
 E m  −  E n . 
 The orbital quantum number  l arises from the radial and angular part of 
the Schr ö dinger equation and it determines and quantizes the angular momen-
tum of the atom (electron proton system), as shown in the equation:
 L

 The magnetic quantum number that arises from solving the azimuthal 
part of the Schr ö dinger equation determines and quantizes the angular 
momentum in one dimension, conveniently chosen to be the  z dimension as

 Finally, the location of the electron inside the atom cannot be exactly deter-
mined. You can only calculate the probability that the electron will be found 
at a certain point in the atom by using the wave function of the electron.

 8.1  INTRODUCTION 
 In chapter 7, we explored the quantum mechanics of the atom by applying the 
Schr ö dinger equation to the hydrogen atom. We demonstrated how quantum 
mechanics explains the anatomy and physiology of the hydrogen atom in such 
an elegant way and we were also able to derive some salient features of 
quantum mechanics in the process. An obvious question to ask is Can we apply 
the Schr ö dinger equation to other atoms, which have multiple electrons? In 
theory, we should be able to do that by adding more electrons, that is, poten-
tials, and solving the equation for the wave function. In practice, however, we 
run into formidable mathematical problems in formulating and solving the 
equation. In many - electron atoms, not only do we have many electrons around 
the nucleus, we also have many protons in the nucleus. Furthermore, we also 
have a repulsive force among similarly charged electrons making the potential 
even more complex. 
research and the true scientiﬁ c explanation comes later by a fundamental physical law 
or theory, a topic that we discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. 
 The periodic table of elements is a tabular display of chemical elements organized 
in such a way as to illustrate trends in the observed properties of the elements. Although 
precursors to this table in one or another form exist, its invention is widely credited to 
Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Since then, the layout of the table has been 
reﬁ ned and extended over time to accommodate newly discovered elements and 
improved scientiﬁ c understanding of it. The fundamental explanation and understand-
ing of the periodic table came from quantum mechanics, the theory that did not even 
exist when the periodic table was invented. 

TWO CHALLENGES TO QUANTUM MECHANICS  289
 This problem is solved by taking a different approach. It turns out that the 
anatomy and physiology of many - electron atoms can be better understood if 
quantum mechanics includes another principle, called the Pauli ’ s exclusion 
principle, also referred to as the exclusion principle. This principle uses an 
additional quantum number called the spin quantum number that you will 
learn about in this chapter. 
 This approach was able to explain the periodic table of elements toward 
the end of the 1920s, which was considered to be a signiﬁ cant achievement of 
quantum mechanics. We will see how the qualitative understanding of atomic 
structure with the help of quantum mechanics allows us to understand some 
of the physical and chemical properties of the elements. These properties 
include atomic sizes, ionization energies, magnetic moments, spectroscopic 
behavior, and chemical behavior. In the context of spectroscopic behavior, the 
electron spin helps explain the split of spectral lines exhibited by atoms in an 
external magnetic ﬁ eld, an effect called the Zeeman effect. So, the central 
theme of this chapter is to explain the behavior of many - electron atoms using 
quantum mechanics. To this end, we will explore three avenues: introducing 
the concept of the spin quantum number, explaining the periodic table of the 
elements with quantum mechanics, and explaining the Zeeman effect with 
quantum mechanics. 
 8.2  TWO CHALLENGES TO QUANTUM MECHANICS: 
THE PERIODIC TABLE AND THE ZEEMAN EFFECT 
 In Chapter 7, we applied quantum mechanics to the simplest atom, the hydro-
gen atom, which has one proton in its nucleus and one electron around it. More 
complex atoms contain multiple protons and possibly one or more neutron in 
their nuclei with multiple electrons around it. Now that we are talking about 
multiple - electron atoms, it is time to deﬁ ne some related terms. The number 
of protons in the nucleus of atoms of a given element is called its atomic 
number. The number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of 
protons in its nucleus. An atom that has lost or gained one or more electrons, 
and thus has acquired an electric charge, is called an ion. An ion with a positive 
charge is called a cation. An ion with a negative charge is called an anion. 
Isotopes are the different forms of the same element that differ in the number 
of neutrons in their nuclei. 
 Quantum mechanics described so far could not explain the behavior of 
many - electron atoms well. The general behavior and trends of many - electron 
atoms, however, is well expressed in a periodic table. Therefore, explaining the 
general behavior of many - electron atoms is equivalent to discovering the 
physical basis of the periodic table. On the spectroscopic side, the so - called 
Zeeman effect, the splitting of spectral lines when an atom is subjected to a 
magnetic ﬁ eld, was a challenge for the growing ﬁ eld of quantum mechanics. 
In this section, we will introduce the periodic table and the Zeeman effect. 

290  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
 8.2.1  The Periodic Table of Elements 
 As part of the quest to understand matter, the universe, and its origin, physi-
cists and chemists have been studying the properties of elements and atoms 
for centuries, long before the development of quantum mechanics. In 1869, a 
chemist named Dmitry Mendeleev arranged the just over 60 elements known 
at the time into a table based on their known chemical properties. The ele-
ments in this table, known as a periodic table of elements, were primarily 
arranged in order of their atomic masses. Mendeleev noticed that a certain 
arrangement of rows in the table gave rise to a pattern that made sense. For 
example, elements of the same column had similar properties, for example, all 
the elements had metal - like properties, but were different from the elements 
of another column that had gas - like nonreactive properties. However, there 
were some vacancies in Mendeleev ’ s table. While skeptics used these vacancies 
to doubt the validity of the table, Mendeleev used these vacancies to predict 
some unknown elements. The periodic table was widely accepted after the 
discovery of three of these unknown elements: gallium in 1875, scandium in 
1879, and germanium in 1886. Recall from Chapters 2 and 3 that classical 
physics was running into great trouble during these times. Mendeleev ’ s peri-
odic table added another challenge for physicists: Explain the physical basis 
of the periodic table. 
 
 Dmitri 
Ivanovich 
Menedeleev 
(1834 – 1907). 
 Dmitri Menedeleev was born in a village 
called Verhnie Aremzyani in Siberia on 
February 8, 1834. He joined the University of 
Saint Petersburg, Russia and completed his 
doctorate in science. He stayed in and 
around Saint Petersburg, Russia for most of 
his life. In 1866, Mendeleev was appointed as 
professor of Chemistry at Saint Petersburg 
University. Three years later he published the 
ﬁ rst version of the periodic table of elements. 
Mendeleev died on February 2, 1907. The 
element of atomic number 101 is called 
mendelevium in his honor. 
 
 Note :  The elements in the modern periodic table are arranged according to atomic 
numbers, whereas the elements in the ﬁ rst periodic table published by Mendeleev 
were arranged according to atomic masses, as the concept of atomic number was 
unknown at the time. Recall that atomic mass directly depends on atomic number. 

TWO CHALLENGES TO QUANTUM MECHANICS  291
 Also, simple quantum theory fails to explain a spectroscopic result called 
the Zeeman effect. 
 8.2.2  The Split Spectral Lines and the Zeeman Effect 
 Chapter 4 explained how the spectral series observed during the spectroscopic 
experiments posed a challenge to classical physics. The chapter also explained 
how these series were eventually explained by some ad hoc quantum princi-
ples or postulates, such as the Bohr atomic model. These principles were 
gradually integrated into quantum theory, as explained in the previous 
chapters. 
 The quantum theory developed so far cannot explain some experimental 
results from spectroscopic experiments. Many spectral lines discussed in 
Chapter 4 (e.g., Sections 4.6.2 and 4.7) actually consist of two separate lines 
close to each other. For example, the ﬁ rst line in the Balmer series of the 
hydrogen atom appears due to the transition of an electron between the  n  =  3 
and 2 levels. As shown in Problem  8.1 , quantum mechanics discussed so far 
predicts for one line of wavelength 656.3  nm. Watched closely in an experi-
ment, there are actually two lines 0.14 - nm apart. From a macroscopic view-
point, this is indeed a small effect. However, in the microscopic world, this is

a sizable effect, and therefore a blow to quantum mechanics, the theory of the 
microscopic world. The other related blow to quantum mechanics discussed 
so far comes from the Zeeman effect, which refers to the experimental obser-
vation that a spectral line of an atom split into multiple lines when the atom 
is in a magnetic ﬁ eld. 
 In order to explain both the periodic table and the split in the spectral lines, 
physicists had to wait for the concept of electron spin to be discovered. 
 8.3  INTRODUCING THE ELECTRON SPIN 
 The split in spectral lines, called the ﬁ ne structure in spectral lines, was ﬁ nally 
explained by this quantum mechanical principle put forward by two Dutch 
graduate students, Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck in 1925: Every 
electron has an intrinsic angular momentum  S due to a property called the 
electron spin,  s . The angular momentum would have a magnetic moment   μ s 
associated with it. In quantum mechanics, the electron ’ s intrinsic angular 
momentum and corresponding magnetic moment are quantized; therefore its 
spin  s  is considered as the spin quantum number just like the orbital quantum 
number  l  corresponding to the orbital angular momentum  L . 
 Because both  S and  L represent some type of angular momentum, the 
relationship between  S and  s is identical to the relationship between  L and  l , 
that is,
 
 S
s s
=
+
(
)
1 ℏ 
 (8.1) 
 The major difference between  s and  l is that  s can have only one value: 
 s = 1
2 . 
 
 Recall from Section 7.5.3 that the space quantization of angular momentum 
is represented by
 L
m
z
l
=
ℏ 
where  m l is called the magnetic quantum number. The orbital angular momen-
tum can have 2 l  +  1 orientations corresponding to 2 l  +  1 values of  m l given by

   Note :   Each electron has a spin whose magnitude is always the same for all the 
electrons and is  ½ , which follows from spectral data and also from the relativistic 
quantum mechanics that we are not discussing in this book. Some particles have 
integral spin. For example, photons have a spin of 1.

 Similarly, space quantization of spin angular momentum is represented by
 
 S
m
z
s
=
ℏ 
 (8.2) 
where  m s is called the spin magnetic quantum number. The spin angular 
momentum can have 2 s  +  1 orientations corresponding to 2 s  +  1 values of  m s 
given by
 
 ms = +

 (8.3) 
 As shown by Eq.  8.2 , the spin magnetic quantum number  m s determines 
the component of the spin angular momentum along a magnetic ﬁ eld in the  z 
direction. The magnetic moment due to spin is called the spin magnetic 
moment  μ s given by the following equation:
 
 μs
e
m S
= −
 
 (8.4) 
where  m is the mass of the electron. Due to the space quantization of spin 
angular momentum  S , spin magnetic moment can only have limited values 
along an axis. As shown in Problem 8.8, the possible values of   μ s along the 
 z - axis are given by

 When Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck proposed the concept of electron spin, what 
they had in mind was a charged sphere spinning on its axis: a classical picture. 
Scattering experiments show that an electron must be  < 10  − 16  m across in size. 
All the experiments by particle physicists at the high energy labs, such as those 
at CERN, have not provided any evidence against the possibility that an elec-
tron is a point particle, that is, it has no structure. Even assuming that the 
electron is not a point particle and is a sphere with a diameter 10  − 16  m, 
it has to have an equatorial velocity greater than the speed of light to 
generate the spin angular momentum of  S = (
/ )
3 2 ℏ, as shown in Problem 
 8.2 . However, Einstein ’ s theory of relativity does not allow the speed of any 
particle to be greater than the speed of light. 
 PROBLEM 8.2 
 Consider an electron as a charged sphere of diameter 10  − 16  m spinning around its 
axis. Determine the equatorial velocity that it will need to generate an angular 
momentum of  3

 Solution: 
 The angular velocity of the spinning sphere is given by

where  v is the equatorial velocity

EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE  295
 So, you should know that this classical picture of electron spin lends itself 
to serious objections. However, objections themselves may be coming from 
our classical way of looking at the spin. One problem is that this argument 
treats an electron as a nonrelativistic particle. When an electron is treated as 
a relativistic particle by using Dirac ’ s equation, the relativistic form of the 
Schr ö dinger equation, the spin quantum number is predicted in a natural way 
like the other three quantum numbers:  l ,  m , and  n . Regardless of how you look 
at it, the fact remains that the spin quantum number is endorsed by experi-
mental observations and by its ability to help explain the periodic table and 
Zeeman effect, as you will see in this chapter. 
 How does the spin quantum number help explain the periodic table? For 
this answer, you need to understand Pauli ’ s exclusion principle, a principle that 
takes spin into account. 
 8.4  EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE 
 As pointed out several times in this book, a system has a natural tendency to 
be in an equilibrium or stable state, which usually means in a state of minimum 
energy. For a hydrogen atom, the state of minimum energy is its ground state 
with  n  =   1. Now, extend your thinking to many - electron atoms. An obvious 
expectation will be that all the electrons in an atom will fall into the same 
ground state under normal conditions so that the atom goes into its stable 
state. However, by just looking at the known chemical properties of elements, 
we can tell that this is not the case.

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
 
 Wolfgang Ernst Pauli (1900 –
 1958).  Courtesy of S. A. Goudsmit, 
AIP Niels Bohr Library. 
 Wolfgang Pauli was born on April 25, 1900 in 
Vienna, Austria. In 1922, he received his 
doctorate from the University of Munich. 
After performing some assignments at 
G ö ttingen, Copenhagen, and Hamburg, he 
became professor of physics at the Institute of 
Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, in 1928. 
Pauli spent most of his life at Zurich, except 
during the years of the World War II. He spent 
those years at U.S. universities including 
Princeton University. He discovered the 
Exclusion Principle in 1925, for which he was 
awarded the Nobel Prize in 1945. He is also 
known for postulating the existence of the 
particle neutrino to explain nuclear beta decay. 
 Throughout his life, Pauli had been 
struggling with the question of why the ﬁ ne 
structure constant, a dimensionless 
fundamental constant, has a value nearly equal 
to 1/137. Pauli died on December 15, 1958, at 
the rather young age of 58, in a hospital room 
number 137 due to pancreatic cancer. 
 The electronic conﬁ guration of an atom largely determines its chemical prop-
erties. Therefore, if all the electrons in an atom jam into the ground state, the 
elements whose atoms differ only by a few electrons should have very similar 
chemical properties, and those whose atoms differ by a large number of elec-
trons should have dissimilar chemical properties. However, reality is contrary 
to this expectation. For example, consider elements with atomic numbers 9 – 11 
that differ only by one electron in their atoms, but their chemical properties 
differ drastically: Fluorine (9 electrons) is a chemically active halogen gas, neon 
(10 electrons) is an inert gas, and sodium (11 electrons) is a metal. On the 
other hand, helium (2 electrons) and argon (18 electrons) are both inert gases. 
 So, it was obvious that all the electrons in many - electron atoms are not in 
the same ground state, and perhaps cannot be in the same quantum state. With 
this in mind, physicist Wolfgang Pauli was looking at the atomic spectra. He 
knew that the various quantum states of an atom can be determined from the 
spectral lines it generates. Pauli noticed that in the spectra of many - electron 
atoms, certain spectral lines were missing that corresponded to transitions of 
electrons among states with certain combination of quantum numbers. 
 
 Note :  Classically thinking, the ultimate stable state for the atom will be for the 
electron to fall into the nucleus. The introduction of simple quantum mechanics 
postulates and the principal quantum number helped explain why this does not 
happen. We needed another quantum number and the exclusion principle to explain 
why all the electrons do not fall into the ground state of  n  =  1. 

EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE  297
 It dawned on Pauli that he could use the spin quantum number to explain 
the missing spectral lines. He proposed what is known as Pauli ’ s exclusion 
principle: 
 
 PAULI ’ S EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE 
 No two electrons in an atom can exist in the same quantum state uniquely deﬁ ned 
by the combination of quantum numbers  n ,  l ,  m l , and  m s . In other words, each elec-
tron in an atom must have a unique set of quantum numbers  n ,  l ,  m l , and  m s different 
from all other electrons in the same atom. Note that the Pauli exclusion principle 
can be extended to other particles, such as neutrons. For example, Pauli ’ s exclusion 
principle is used to explain the formation of neutron stars, and above a certain 
critical mass, the transition to a black hole, as the degeneracy pressure cannot ﬁ ght 
off the force of gravity. A star collapsed under a gravitational ﬁ eld is called a black 
hole because its gravitational force is so strong nothing can leave the star, not even 
light. 
 Pauli was able to show that all the missing atomic spectral lines involved 
two or more electrons with an identical set of quantum numbers. The exclusion 
principle is just a declaration of this observation. 
 
 Note :  There are two components to Pauli ’ s exclusion principle: 
 1.  A quantum state is deﬁ ned by a set of quantum numbers { n ,  l ,  m l ,  m s }. 
 2.  Each electron in an atom must have a unique quantum state different from 
those of all other electrons in the same atom.

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
 So, Pauli ’ s exclusion principle explains why all the electrons in many - electron 
atoms do not jam up into the ground state. But how exactly does it help us to 
understand the actual detailed electronic conﬁ guration of atoms, in other 
words, the periodic table? Let us explore it. 
 8.5  UNDERSTANDING THE ATOMIC STRUCTURE 
 Although we cannot exactly solve the Schr ö dinger equation for many - electron 
atoms, no radical changes in quantum mechanics theory are expected as we 
move from the hydrogen atom to more complex atoms. With the addition of 
a spin quantum number, the fundamentals of quantum mechanics still remain 
valid with the increase in atomic number of atoms: the same set of four 
quantum numbers { n ,  l ,  m l ,  m s }, the same quantum states deﬁ ned by this set of 
quantum numbers, the same wave functions representing the probability of 
locating an electron in the atom, and the same general formula for energy 
absorption and radiation during the transition between two states, and so on. 
 A key to understanding the periodic table is to understand an underlying 
unity behind the diversity of all atoms: The electrons in all atoms live in orbit-
als (essentially the states) deﬁ ned by a set of four quantum numbers: { n ,  l ,  m l , 
 m s }. The orbitals exist in subshells deﬁ ned by  l , which in turn exist in shells 
deﬁ ned by  n . In order to understand the physical basis of the periodic table, 
it is important to understand the concepts of shells, subshells, and orbitals, and 
their relationship with one another. 
 8.5.1  Understanding Shells, Subshells, and Orbitals 
 A shell is deﬁ ned by the principal quantum number  n , the quantum number 
that quantizes the energy. Electrons with the same quantum number  n (i.e., 
the same value of  n ) are roughly at the same average distance from the nucleus 
of the atom they are in. Therefore, they are essentially considered to be in the 
same shell. In this context,  n is also referred to as a shell or shell number. 
Because the electron energy largely depends on  n , the electrons in the same 
shell have roughly the same energy. Atomic shells, that is, the values of  n , are 
also denoted by letters (e.g., K, L, M, N, and O) corresponding to the values 
of  n  =  1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively, as summarized below:

 Letter Used

 As mentioned earlier, the energy of electrons in a speciﬁ c shell also depends 
to some extent on the quantum number  l . The intervening shells of other 
electrons shield the nuclear charge from an electron and the degree to which 
the nuclear charge is shielded from the electron depends on its probability –

UNDERSTANDING THE ATOMIC STRUCTURE  299
 density distribution. An electron with a small  l value is more likely to be found 
near the nucleus where it is poorly shielded by other electrons than an electron 
with a larger value of  l is within the same shell. Nearer to the nucleus means 
higher binding energy and therefore lower total energy. In other words, the 
energy of electrons within the same shell increases with an increase in  l . 
Electrons with the same value of  l  are said to belong to the same subshell. 
Because there are different values of  l for the same value of  n , there are mul-
tiple subshells in a shell. You know from Chapter 7 that  l has  n integral values 
corresponding to each  n ranging from 0 to  n  −  1. Subshells, that is, the values 
of  l , are also denoted by letters, for example, s, p, d, f, and g corresponding to 
the values of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, as summarized below:

 Each subshell is identiﬁ ed by its principal quantum number  n followed by 
the letter corresponding to the value of  l . For example, a subshell with  n  =  2 
and  l  =  0 is denoted by 2s. 
 Note :  Because the energy,  E , of electrons within the same shell increases with an 
increase in  l , the stability of an atom also decreases with the increase in  l .

 Recall from Chapter 7 that corresponding to a speciﬁ c value of  l , there are 
2 l  +  1 values of  m l because  m l can have integral values ranging from  − l to  + l 
including zero. In other words, the total number of orbitals in a subshell  l are 

300  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
2 l  +  1: one corresponding to each value of  m l . The quantum number  m l 
describes the space orientation of the orbital in which the electron exists. 
Recall that an orbital is the region around the nucleus in which the electron 
can be found with a probability distribution. It is important to realize the dif-
ference between an orbital and an orbit in the Bohr ’ s model discussed in 
Chapter 4. Bohr ’ s orbit is a well - deﬁ ned circular orbit around the nucleus with 
a certain radius in which the electron moves. This concept violates the uncer-
tainty principle. An orbital, in accordance with the uncertainty principle, is a 
region about the nucleus in which an electron can be found by using the prob-
ability wave function. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 8.4 
 Explain exactly how Bohr ’ s orbit violates the uncertainty principle. 
 Solution: 
 The orbit in Bohr ’ s model is a well - deﬁ ned circular orbit around the nucleus. In 
order to draw such an orbit in which the electron moves, you must know the loca-
tion of the electron and its velocity, and hence the momentum at a given time 
simultaneously. This is not possible according to the uncertainty principle, which 
states:
 Δ Δ
x p ≥ℏ
2  
 Corresponding to each value of  m l , there are only two values of the mag-
netic spin quantum number  m s : 1/2 and  − 1/2. Therefore, according to Pauli ’ s 
exclusion principle, an orbital can only have two electrons at maximum. As 
demonstrated in Problem  8.3 , the maximum number of electrons that can 
reside in a shell  n are 2 n 2 , a fact that chemist take for granted. 
 As examples, Table  8.1 summarizes the possible values of all the quantum 
numbers  n ,  l ,  m l , and the maximum number of electrons in a shell correspond-
ing to  n  =  1 through  n  =  7. The last column of the table lists the maximum 
number of electrons that can occupy a shell. Not all the elements have all the 
shells completed, that is, having maximum electrons; a factor that contributes 
to the diversity of elements. For example, hydrogen (H) has only one shell 
( n  =  1), and even that is incomplete; it only has one electron; whereas a helium 
(He) atom has one shell ( n  =  1) and it is complete; that is, it contains the 
maximum number of electrons. The carbon (C) atom has its ﬁ rst shell com-
plete, but has only four electrons in the second shell, while it can contain a 
maximum of eight electrons; whereas Neon (Ne) has two shells ( n  +  1 and  + 2) 
and both are complete. 

UNDERSTANDING THE ATOMIC STRUCTURE  301
 Now that you understand how different quantum numbers deﬁ ne the concepts 
of shells, subshells, and orbitals, it is time to explore how these concepts help 
explain the distribution of electrons in the atom; the electron conﬁ guration of 
atoms. 
 8.5.2  Understanding the Electron Conﬁ guration of Atoms 
 The anatomy of atoms is determined by the way electrons are distributed 
among the various orbitals of an atom. This distribution is called electron 
conﬁ guration, which in turn is determined by the following three principles: 
 1.  Principle of Stability or Equilibrium.   Here comes the stability principle 
again: A system of particles tends to be in a stable state, which is the state 
of minimum energy. This statement implies that orbitals in an atom are 
ﬁ lled with available electrons in order of increasing energy. Electron 
energy varies with quantum states; largely with  n , but also somewhat with 
 l . To be speciﬁ c, energy increases with the increase in the value of  n , and 
it also increases with the increase in the value of  l . This idea is illustrated 
in Figure  8.1 . 
 2.  Exclusion Principle.    A unique state deﬁ ned by the set of quantum 
numbers { n ,  l ,  m l ,  m s } can be occupied only by one electron in an atom. 
This means no two electrons in the same atom can have the same values 
of  n ,  l ,  m l , and  m s . 
 PROBLEM 8.3 
 Calculate the maximum number of electrons a shell with principal quantum number 
 n can have. Express your answer in terms of  n only. 
 Maximum number of electrons in an orbital  =  2 
 Maximum number of orbitals in a subshell  =  2 l  +  1 
 which implies 
 Maximum number of electrons in a subshell  =  2(2 l  +  1) 
 Maximum number of subshells in a shell  =  n ; ranging from  l  =  0 to  n  −  1 
 Maximum number of electrons,  N , in a subshell:

 3.  Hund ’ s Rule.   Hund ’ s rule states that when electrons are added to 
orbitals at the same energy level, that is, the same principal quantum 
number, they will ﬁ ll each of the available orbitals with only one 
electron before doubling up in any orbital. This rule is in accordance 
with the principle of stability because two electrons in the same orbital 
make the system less stable due to the increased repulsion between 
the two electrons. 
 Figure 8.1.   An example of orbital energy levels for  n  =  1 – 4 in many - electron atoms. 
The energies of the subshells in each shell increase in the order  n s  <  n p  <  n d  <  n f.

 Give the increasing order of energy along the values of  l for each of  n  =  2, 3, 4. 
 Solution: 
 For  n  =   2, the increasing order of energy is 2s  <  2p 
 For  n  =   3, the increasing order of energy is 3s  <  3p  <  3d 
 For  n  =   4, the increasing order of energy is 4s  <  4p  <  4d  <  4f

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
 To reach stability, a lower subshell of a higher shell can be ﬁ lled before ﬁ ling 
the higher subshell of a lower shell. For example, consider the noble gas 
element argon (Ar), which marks the end of the row started by sodium (Na). 
The electron conﬁ guration of Ar, with atomic number 18 is, 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 6 
 You may think that the next element in the periodic table, that is the lement 
with atomic number 19, which is potassium (K), will have its outermost elec-
tron in the 3d shell. However, experimental results about the properties of K 
demonstrate that it is a member of the alkali metal group. This means that it 
puts its outermost electron, that is, the electron with highest energy, in the 4s 
subshell instead of putting it in the 3d subshell. As Figure  8.1 shows, 3d orbitals 
have higher energy than the 4s orbital, which implies that 4s will be ﬁ lled 
before the 3d is ﬁ lled. Why is this? Due to its greater penetration near the 
nucleus, the 4s orbital has a slightly larger binding energy, and hence a slightly 
less total energy than the 3d, and therefore makes the atom slightly more 
stable. 
 You can ask a question Is there any general visual order (or sequence) in 
which electrons ﬁ ll the orbitals? The answer is yes: The general order is shown 
in Figure  8.2 , which is true in general with only few exceptions. The ﬁ gure is 
read as shown in the following: 
 1.  Write the subshells corresponding to each shell (principal quantum 
number) in horizontal lines starting with s at the bottom. 
 2.  Draw diagonal arrows over the sublevels, as shown in Figure  8.2 a . 
 3.  Start reading the sublevels along the arrows from the bottom up and left 
to right. 
 4.  When you reach the last subshell, along an arrow, start from the begin-
ning (bottom) of the next arrow. 
 Following this procedure, you can read the order in which the subshells in 
various shells will be ﬁ lled. The results are shown in Figure  8.2  b . 
 From what we have learned so far about how the shells and orbitals are 
ﬁ lled, let us tackle a few examples of the electronic conﬁ guration of real ele-
ments with their atoms in the ground state. 
 A hydrogen atom contains only one electron, which obviously goes to the 
1s subshell. In He, the second electron pairs with the ﬁ rst electron in the same 
1s orbital. In spite of the repulsion between the two electrons in the same 
orbital, an atom has less energy (more stability) in this case than it would if 
the second electron in He went to the 2s orbital. According to Pauli ’ s exclusion 
principle, the 1s orbital is full with two electrons, and therefore the third elec-
tron in the Li atom must go to the 2s orbital. The fourth electron in Be ﬁ lls 
the 2s orbital, and the ﬁ fth electron in B goes to the ﬁ rst orbital (there are 
three orbitals in a p subshell as compared to one orbital in an s subshell) in 
the 2p orbital. Following Hund ’ s rule, the sixth electron in C goes to the second 
2p orbital and the seventh electron in N goes to the third 2p orbital. The next

three elements O, F, and Ne ﬁ ll the ﬁ rst, second, and third orbital of the 2p 
subshell, respectively. This ﬁ lling of atomic orbitals with electrons, illustrated 
in Figure  8.3 , covers atoms of the elements in the ﬁ rst two periods (rows) of 
the periodic table. 
 The ﬁ lling of the 1s subshell, and hence the primary shell  n  =  1, is 
complete with the noble gas (or rare earth) element He, and the electron 
conﬁ guration of the next element, Li, can be presented in terms of helium, 
Li: [He]2s 1 . 
 Similarly, the 2p subshell, and hence the primary shell  n  =  2, is complete 
with the noble gas element Ne, and the electron conﬁ guration of the next 
element sodium (Na), can be written in terms of sodium, Na: [Ne]3s 1 . 
 This method of writing the electron conﬁ guration is called the condensed 
electron conﬁ guration. The inner - shell electrons represented by the symbol of 
a noble gas element are called core electrons and the electrons that follow are 
called the outer - shell electrons, which include the electrons that take part in 
atomic bonding and are called  valence electrons .

 Note :  Valence electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom, which play a 
signiﬁ cant role in determining how the atom chemically reacts with other atoms. 
For example, atoms with a complete shell of valence electrons (corresponding to 
an electron conﬁ guration s 2 p 6 ) tend to be chemically inert, whereas atoms with one 
or two valence electrons more than a closed shell are highly reactive. The reason is 
because the extra electrons are easily removed, leaving behind positive ions. 
Furthermore, atoms with one or two valence electrons less than a closed shell are 
also highly reactive because they have a strong tendency either to gain the missing 
electrons and form negative ions, or to share electrons with other atoms, and thereby 
form bonds called covalent bonds. 

UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF THE PERIODIC TABLE  307
 The general trend across the second period is the increase in ionization 
energy with an increase in atomic number, as each new electron is more tightly 
held to the nucleus because of the increased charge in the nucleus. This general 
tendency is true for other periods for the same reason with few exceptions due 
to other factors. Now, we are already talking about explaining the physical 
basis of the periodic table. 
 
 Note :  Because the outermost electron in B is in the 2p orbital and unpaired as 
compared to the two outermost electrons in Be, which are paired in a 2s orbital, the 
outermost electron in B has more total energy and less potential (binding) energy. 
Therefore, the ﬁ rst ionization energy, that is, the energy it will take to knock out the 
outermost electron from the atom, is less than that of Be. This is an example of how 
the electron conﬁ guration of atoms inﬂ uences the properties of the elements.

 8.6  UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF 
THE PERIODIC TABLE 
 From the three physical principles (stability principle, exclusion principle, and 
Hund ’ s rule) discussed in Section 8.5.2, the electron conﬁ guration of atoms of 
the elements can be determined within the framework of quantum mechanics. 
This conﬁ guration is presented in Figure  8.4 . In this section, we explore how 
this conﬁ guration (atomic structure) predicts the properties of the elements. 
Let us start with observing some general trends and understanding what those 
trends predict.

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
 8.6.1  General Trends Across Groups and Periods 
 Note in Figure  8.4 that reading from the top to the bottom, each new period 
has a new shell or principal level. In other words, the periods in the periodic 
table are distinguished by a different set of shells. For example, the ﬁ rst period 
contains only the K shell, the second period contains the K and L shells, the 
third period contains K, L, and M shells, and so on. The number of shells does 
not change within a given period, which corresponds to ﬁ lling of subshells. 
Therefore the properties of different elements within a period are largely due 
to the different ﬁ lling of the subshells. Because the number of principal levels 
stay the same across the period and adding each new electron (plus a proton 
in the nucleus) increases the attractive force between the nucleus and the 
electrons, the atomic radius decreases going from left to right across a period. 
This means the outer electrons are more tightly bound to the nucleus, which 
results in an increase in ionization energy going from left to right across a 
given period. Recall that the ionization energy is the energy required to 
remove the outermost electron, or even more precisely the weakest bound 
electron. The ionization trend also inﬂ uences the conductivity of the elements 
to the extent that for an element to be a good electrical conductor, it needs 
electrons that are only weakly bound to the nuclei of their atoms. This shows 
how different ﬁ lings of subshells inﬂ uence or determine the properties of the 
elements. 
 
 Note :  The atomic radius of a chemical element is usually deﬁ ned as the mean or 
typical distance from the nucleus of its atoms to the boundary of the surrounding 
cloud of electrons. Strictly speaking, the radius is originally a classical concept 
because neither atom is entirely spherical nor does it have a ﬁ xed radius. Practically, 
the radius of an atom is usually found by measuring the distance between the nuclei 
of two touching atoms in a bond, and then halving that distance. 
 Figure  8.5 demonstrates the separate grouping of elements with different 
groups corresponding to different properties due to different subshells. On the 
extreme left, are two groups of elements (1A and 2A) called alkali metals and 
alkaline earth metals, respectively, in which the valence s orbitals are being 
ﬁ lled. On the extreme right, is a block of six groups (columns), in which the 
valence p orbitals are being ﬁ lled. This p block on the right and the s block 
(with two columns) on the left are called representative or main - group 
elements. 
 In the middle of Figure  8.5 is a block of 10 groups (columns), in which the 
valence d orbitals are being ﬁ lled. This d block consists of transition metals. 
Below the main part of the table, there is a block of two rows and 14 columns 
at the bottom, in which the valence f orbitals are being ﬁ lled. These two rows 
are also called the Lanthanide and Actanide series, respectively, and the

columns in the p block, 10 columns in the d block, and 14 columns in the f 
block correspond to precisely the number of electrons that can ﬁ ll the s, p, d, 
and f subshells, respectively. 
 
 Caution :  The general trends discussed here are true for a good number of repre-
sentative elements. Exceptions happen due to complex interactions among elec-
trons in many - electron atoms. 
 Going down a group, the number of principal levels increases; that is, the 
outermost electrons occupy higher energy levels farther from the nucleus. 
Therefore the atomic radius (and hence atomic size) increases from the top 
to the bottom of a given group. Accordingly, the ionization energy decreases 
going down a group. Nevertheless, the elements in the same group tend to 
have similar physical and chemical properties. This is because there is another 
very important factor involved: The elements in the same group have the same 
valence electron structure. This means they have the same number of electrons 
in an  l orbital, and therefore are able to make similar chemical bonds. For 
example, Li, Na, and K all have one electron in the  l  =  0 (s) orbital of the 
outermost shell. 
 

312  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
 Note :  The vertical columns in the periodic table are called groups and the horizon-
tal rows are called periods. Elements in a group have similar properties, whereas 
elements in a period have different properties. This is largely due to the similarity 
and differences in the valence electron structure of the atoms. Valence electrons are 
the electrons in the outermost energy level (principal level) of an atom. 
 Now that you understand the physical reasoning behind some general ten-
dencies in the periodic table, let us explore the physical basis of some speciﬁ c 
groups of elements in the periodic table with similar properties. 
 8.6.2  Alkalis and Alkaline Earths 
 For each period n, the ns orbital in the outermost shell n is ﬁ lled ﬁ rst with two 
electrons. Each element in the 1A group have only one electron in its ns 
orbital, and are called alkalis. They, except hydrogen, share the common prop-
erties of a class of metals called alkali metals: Li, Na, K, and so on. As expected 
from the reasoning in Section 8.6.1, they have the lowest ionization energies 
and are relatively good electrical conductors. This is because the lone valence 
electron is available to move around easily from one atom to another. All 
alkali metals are soft, have low melting points, and are chemically very active. 
 
 Note :  Hydrogen, in spite of its top position in the alkali metal column in the peri-
odic table, does not behave as an alkali metal under standard conditions. However, 
it does behave like a metal after it undergoes a phase change to the solid phase 
under extremely high pressure. The solid phase of hydrogen consists of a crystal 
lattice of atomic nuclei (basically, protons), with a spacing comparable with a typical 
electron wavelength, the de Broglie wavelength. The electrons under these condi-
tions are pretty much unbound and behave like the conduction electrons in a metal. 
 Alkaline earth metals (Be, Mg, Ca, etc.) have two electrons in the ns orbital 
of their outermost shell n, and therefore fall into Group 2 of the periodic table. 
Although the ns subshell is ﬁ lled, the properties of alkaline earths, also called 
alkaline earth metals, are understandably more similar to alkalis than to ele-
ments with higher groups: the ionization energies are low and electrical con-
ductivity is high. Due to the two valence electrons, alkaline earth metals are 
chemically active. 
 Following the completion of the 4s orbital (in Ca), the next set of orbitals 
ready to be ﬁ lled is 3d. Electrons are added to the ﬁ ve 3d orbitals beginning 
with scandium (Sc) and ending with zinc (Zn). These elements are called 
transition metals. 
 8.6.3  Transition Metals 
 The elements in the periodic table from Groups 3 to 12 in periods 4 – 7 are 
called transition metals. Their similar properties are primarily determined by 

UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICAL BASIS OF THE PERIODIC TABLE  313
the electrons in the outermost s subshell while the inner d subshell is being 
ﬁ lled. However, for elements in the middle of the period, the ﬁ ling of the 3d 
subshell leads to some signiﬁ cant characteristics. For example, electrons in the 
d subshell orbitals of Fe, Co, and Ni are unpaired, that is, they have unpaired 
spins because they are distributed according to Hund ’ s rule. As a result, the 
unpaired spins of neighboring atoms in a crystal lattice align themselves to 
produce large magnetic moments, which give rise to certain properties called 
ferromagnetic properties. Again, alignment of unpaired spins is yet another 
attempt to gain stability. As the d subshell is ﬁ lled, the electron spins in the 
orbitals are paired off, the magnetic moment and the tendency to align with 
the neighboring atoms diminishes. 
 Molecules with one or more unpaired electrons are drawn into a magnetic 
ﬁ eld. The greater the number of unpaired electrons, the stronger is this force 
of attraction. This property of a substance is called paramagnetism. Substances 
made of molecules with no unpaired electrons are slightly repelled from a 
magnetic ﬁ eld and are called diamagnetic. 
 
 Note :  Strictly speaking, and also according to the deﬁ nition of IUPAC (International 
Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), a transition metal is an element whose atom 
has an incomplete d subshell, or that can give rise to cations with an incomplete d 
subshell. zinc, cadmium, and mercury do not meet this requirement because they 
have  their d  subshell ﬁ lled: d 10  conﬁ guration . They do, however, form ions with a  + 2 
oxidation state, but retain the d 10 conﬁ guration. 
 Due to the two valence electrons, alkaline earth metals are chemically active. 
 On the contrary, inert gases are chemically inactive. 
 8.6.4  Inert Gases 
 A group of elements called inert gases are in Group 8A (also called Group 
18), farthest away from alkalis in Group 1. These two groups are equally dif-
ferent in their properties as well due to their different valence electron struc-
ture. All the inert elements have the outermost subshell (s subshell in He and 
p subshell in all others) completely ﬁ lled. Because they have no valence elec-
tron available, they are chemically very inactive and are therefore called inert 
gases. They do not easily form bonds, have high ionization energy, or poor 
electrical conductivity. Due to their nonbonding tendency and as a result their 
weak interactions among atoms, their boiling points are quite low; they are 
monatomic gases at room temperature. 
 8.6.5  Halogens 
 Elements in Group 7A (F, Cl, Br, etc., also called Group 17), immediately to 
the left of Group 8A inert gases, are one electron short of having the outer-
most subshell ﬁ lled and therefore become stable like the inert gases (recall 

314  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
the stability principle). As a result, halogens are chemically very active in a 
quest to gain stability. Recall that alkalis also are chemically very active due 
to a similar, but complimentary reason: They have one valence electron, and 
therefore to remain stable, they will be happy to lose it. As a result, alkalis and 
halogens form bonds with each other. They are strong bonds called ionic 
bonds. For example, the alkali atom Na loses an electron to become the sodium 
ion, Na  +  , and the chlorine atom, Cl, gains the electron to become the chlorine 
ion, Cl  −  . These two ions are attracted by the electrostatic force and make a 
strong bond that becomes the compound sodium chloride, NaCl. 
 8.6.6  Lanthanides and Actinides 
 The elements with atomic numbers from 58 to 71 are called lanthanides, or 
rare earths, have similar properties because they all have the outer 6s subshell 
ﬁ lled and the inner 4f subshell ﬁ lled. Just like the 3d orbitals of the transition 
metals, the 4f orbitals of lanthanides often have unpaired electrons. 
Consequently, the unpaired spins of neighboring atoms align and give rise to 
high magnetic moments and properties, such as ferromagnetism. Due to a 
larger number of orbitals than the d subshells, the f subshells may have more 
unpaired electrons and a larger angular momentum giving rise to an even 
greater magnetic moment and ferromagnetic effect. For example, the element 
holmium (Ho) can have an extremely large internal magnetic ﬁ eld at low 
temperatures, even muh larger than in iron (Fe). 
 Elements with atomic numbers from 90 to 103, called actinides, are very 
similar to lanthanides because they have their 7s subshell ﬁ lled (instead of the 
6s), and the inner subshells are in the process of being ﬁ lled. A commonality 
among all of the actinides is that all of them are radioactive. 
 In the beginning of this chapter, we explained that the quantum mechanics 
developed so far could not explain the periodic table and Zeeman effect. We 
have already seen how by introducing the spin angular momentum quantized 
by the spin quantum number lays the foundations for the physical basis of the 
periodic table. The concept of spin can also be used to explain the Zeeman 
effect. First, however, we need to understand how the spin angular momentum 
contributes to the total angular momentum. 
 8.7  COMPLETING THE STORY OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM 
 By now, we have introduced two kinds of angular momentum: orbital angular 
momentum L quantized by orbital quantum number  l , and spin angular 
momentum S quantized by spin quantum number s. Each electron in an atom 
has a certain amount of L and a certain amount of S. Both combine to give 
the total angular momentum J of the electron. 
 For example, consider alkalis with one valence electron in their outermost 
shell outside the closed inner shells. For such atoms, the magnetic moment and 

COMPLETING THE STORY OF ANGULAR MOMENTUM  315
the total angular momentum is given by this single valence electron. The total 
angular momentum J is the vector sum of L and S:

 STUDY CHECKPOINT 8.6 
 Will the total angular momentum of the ions He  +  , Ba  +  , and Mg  +  be determined by 
a single electron just like the alkali metals? 
 Solution: 
 The answer is yes, because these ions have only one valence electron because they 
have lost the second electron.

 Note :  According to the exclusion principle, the total angular momentum and mag-

 (8.9) 
 To rule out the third possibility,  j  =  s  −  l is left as an exercise for you: 
Problem 8.9. The concept behind Eq.  8.9 is illustrated in Figure  8.6 . This means 
that when only one electron is involved, there are only two relative orienta-
tions of L and S: alignment corresponding to  l  +  s in which case J  >  L, and 
antialignment corresponding to  l  −  s in which case J  <  L. For example, for the 
 l  =  1 state the alignment will result in the quantum number  j  =  3/2, and anti-
alignment will result in the quantum number  j  =  1/2. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 8.7 
 Calculate the values of the quantum number  j for an electron in the s subshell. 
 Solution: 
 The s subshell corresponds to  l  =  0. 
 Therefore, from Eq.  8.9 :
 j =

,
 
 But  − 1/2 is not a physical solution. 
 Therefore  j  =  1/2 is the only possibility. 
 Equation  8.8 represents the quantization of total angular momentum, J. 
Furthermore, just like L, J is also quantized in direction, which may be 
expressed in the  z direction by the following equation:

UNDERSTANDING THE ZEEMAN EFFECT  317
 Next, we will see how coupling between L and S helps explain the Zeeman 
effect. 
 8.8  UNDERSTANDING THE ZEEMAN EFFECT 
 The Zeeman effect refers to the splitting of an expected spectral line into 
multiple lines, such as three lines in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁ eld. 
As illustrated in Figure  8.7 , there exist several possible electron conﬁ gurations

in an atom with the same energy, called degenerate states. Therefore, the tran-
sitions between this set of conﬁ gurations and another correspond to a single 
spectral line. The presence of a magnetic ﬁ eld breaks this degeneracy, because 
the magnetic ﬁ eld interacts differently with electrons with different quantum 
numbers, and thereby slightly modiﬁ es their energies. The result of this interac-
tion follows: Where there were several conﬁ gurations that previously had the 
same energy, they now have different energies; one spectral line in the absence 
of a magnetic ﬁ eld has been split into many close spectral lines in the presence 
of a magnetic ﬁ eld. 
 Now, let us see how the electron spin causes the Zeeman effect. You know 
from Chapter 1 that any motion of charge generates the magnetic ﬁ eld, and 
hence the magnetic moment. An electron in an atom has an angular momen-
tum due to its circular - like motion according to the right - hand rule (rhr) 
explained in Section 1.14. 
 As shown in Problem 8.8 and demonstrated in Figure  8.8 , the magnetic 
moment of electron   μ in an atom is given by

where the expression   
μ.B  represents the dot product between the two vector 
quantities   μ  and  B , and is equal to the product of their magnitudes times the 
cosine of the angle their directions make with each other. Now, the key point 
is that the magnetic moment   μ  due to the total angular momentum is the 
vector sum of two magnetic moments from L and S. Therfore, Eq.  8.11 is 
replaced with:

 (8.13) 
 From Eqs.  8.12 and  8.13 you can see that the potential energy  V B will have 
multiple values possible, and hence multiple spectral lines. In the absence of 
spin, Eq.  8.13 will reduce to Eq.  8.11 , and the potential energy will have a single 
value. Therefore, the Zeeman effect is the direct result of the intrinsic spin of 
the electron. 
 8.9  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 We discussed in this chapter how quantum mechanics successfully explains 
the Zeeman effect; that is, splitting a spectral line into several components in 
the presence of a magnetic ﬁ eld. The Zeeman effect exists due to the quantum 
number s based on the electron spin that can have one of two possible values: 
 + 1/2,  − 1/2. Owing to its understanding by quantum mechanics, the Zeeman 
effect is successfully used in applications, such as nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI). Magnetic resonance imaging is used to get 
images of internal parts, such as bones, muscles, and organs, of an organism, 
such as a human, for the purpose of medical diagnosis. Until recently X - rays 
were used for this purpose. However, using X - rays for imaging has some 
drawbacks. First, due to limited resolution, X - rays do not yield sufﬁ ciently 
resolved images of overlapping structures, and the images of diseased tissues 
and healthy tissues look alike. As a result, X - ray images often fail to detect 
injury or disease. Furthermore, X - rays are high - energy radiation, and there-
fore can cause physiological damage. The MRI is free of these drawbacks 
because it works in the environment of low - energy radiation and high 
resolution. 
 As we explained in this chapter, protons and neutrons have a spin of  ½  just 
like electron, and therefore can cause the Zeeman effect as well. Magnetic 
resonance imaging is based on the spin quantum number of the spin of the 
atomic nuclei, which are made up of protons and neutrons. The hydrogen 
nucleus (containing one proton) is the most common nucleus studied using 
MRI because hydrogen is a major constituent of an aqueous body ﬂ uid and 
fatty tissues: Think of molecules of water and fatty acids that contain hydrogen. 

320  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
According to quantum mechanics the nucleus of hydrogen, a proton, can have 
only two spin states (orientations):  ½  and  − ½ . Due to their intrinsic spin, these 
protons contain a magnetic moment and the two states corresponding to each 
spin value have the same energy. However, when an external magnetic ﬁ eld is 
applied, some of these protons align parallel to the magnetic ﬁ eld, and others 
antiparallel to the ﬁ eld depending on their spin state, as shown in Figure  8.9 . 
These two orientations correspond to slightly different energies. 
 If we shine radio waves on these protons, and the radio waves have just the 
right frequency, the lower energy protons can absorb photons of radiation and 
ﬂ ip over, for example, ﬂ ipping from parallel to antiparallel alignment. Recall 
from Chapter 2 that according to quantum mechanics the photon ’ s energy is 
proportional to its frequency. The detection of this ﬂ ipping between two spin 
states gives rise to the NMR spectrum. In other words, the details of energy 
absorption required for ﬂ ipping gives information about the environment of 
the protons (if the protons are in water or in a fat, etc). Putting this informa-
tion together, we get a structural image of a slice of the body, such as an organ. 
Because the difference between the energies of the two spin states is very 
small, it takes little energy for the ﬂ ip over, and hence the radiation used in 
the MRI technique is in the radio frequency range, which is far less energetic 
than X - rays, and therefore harmless. 
 The key here is the interaction of the nuclei (a proton in the case of hydro-
gen) with the magnetic ﬁ eld. By varying the magnetic ﬁ eld strength with loca-
tion enables us to code different parts of the body with different frequencies. 
Through measurement of frequencies with enough precision, an MRI expert 
can reconstruct a two - (2D) or three - dimensional (3D) image that accurately 
depicts the interior part of a body. In a nutshell, by varying the magnetic ﬁ eld 
and using these sophisticated techniques, body parts can be imaged to different 
depths at great resolution, and the diseased tissues can be differentiated from 
the healthy tissues. As an example, Figure  8.10 presents the MRI images of a 
human head ( a ) and nerve ﬁ bers ( b ).

 8.10  SUMMARY 
 When you consider the atomic number of elements, you ﬁ nd that similar physi-
cal and chemical properties appear in the elements at regular intervals. This 
is the basis of the periodic table. In other words, a periodic table is an arrange-
ment of the elements in increasing atomic number in a series of rows so that 
the elements in the vertical columns have similar properties. Several properties 
of atoms are periodic in the sense that the trends regarding those properties 
repeat themselves from row to row. This periodicity and trends provide the 
periodic table with its predictive value. As a result, to ﬁ ll the gaps between the 
known elements, several elements were predicted to exist before they were 
actually discovered. Elements in the same row (period) have different proper-
ties. Atomic radius and ionization energy are examples of the periodic proper-
ties of elements. Atomic radius tends to decrease, and hence the ionization 
energy tends to increase from the left to right inside a row (period). Going 
from top to bottom in a group, the radius increases and therefore the ioniza-
tion energy tends to decrease. 
 These similarities and differences can be explained with the help of quantum 
number  n corresponding to the principal energy level,  l and  m l corresponding 
to orbital angular momentum, and  m s corresponding to spin angular 
momentum.

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MANY-ELECTRON ATOMS
 A set of values for  n ,  l ,  m l ,  m s uniquely identiﬁ es a quantum state. According 
to the exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum 
state. This is the physical basis for the distribution of electrons in an atom 
among different orbitals (corresponding to different spin) in different sub-
shells (corresponding to different  l values) at each principal energy level or 
shell (corresponding to different values of  n ). The distribution is made in 
accordance with the stability principle, which dictates that the shells and sub-
shells in a given shell be ﬁ lled in increasing order of energy. This gives rise to 
a different valence electron structure along a period and similar valence elec-
tron structure along a group. 
 This provides the physical basis for the similarity in properties of elements 
in the same column group and different properties of elements in the same 
period. The coupling of orbital angular momentum and spin angular momen-
tum to give rise to the total angular momentum explains the split of spectral 
lines into multiple spectral lines in an atom in an external magnetic ﬁ eld. 
 As mentioned several times earlier in this book, classical physics is an 
approximation of quantum physics, which is more general theory that can be 
applied to any structural levels. In this and previous chapters, we have applied 
quantum physics to atomic structure. In Chapter 9, we will explore how 
quantum physics can be applied to molecules or molecular structures.

 9.1  INTRODUCTION 
 In Chapter  8 we explored how quantum mechanics explains the behavior of 
atoms and elements. Atoms bond together to make crystalline and amorphous 
(noncrystalline) matter. We see different kinds of material (or matter as a 
physicist would say) around us. A particular kind of matter that has the same 
composition and properties is called a pure substance, or a substance for short. 
A substance is one kind of matter that has its own unique set of physical and 
chemical properties, not exactly the same as any other substance. Substances 
are broadly categorized into two groups: elements and compounds. Elements 
of the periodic table, discussed in Chapter  8 , are examples of simple pure 
substances. The smallest unit of an element that retains the characteristics of 
that element is called an atom. A compound is a substance that consists of two 
or more elements always in the same proportion. The atoms of these sub-
stances are held together by bonds, such as ionic or covalent bonds, to make 
recipient must be alive to receive the prize. Physics made a grand entrance into biology 
when according to legend, Francis Crick, originally a physicist and then a biologist, as 
well, and James Watson, a biologist, walked into the Eagle pub in Cambridge, England, 
on February 28, 1953, and Crick announced,  “ We have found the secret of Life ” . What 
they had really ﬁ gured out was the now famous double helix structure of the DNA 
molecule. This discovery of the DNA structure catalyzed a revolution in biology by 
activating the already existing ﬁ elds of molecular biology and biotechnology. 
Nevertheless, there was still a gigantic gap between determining the structure of DNA 
and understanding the exact role of DNA. It took the next quarter century of Crick ’ s 
life along with other scientists to develop the ideas that now constitute the basics of 
molecular biology: the genetic code, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), and the 
translation of mRNA into proteins. After more than one - half of a century since that 
event in the Eagle pub, the DNA molecule is still the biggest celebrity in biology. 

326  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
the building blocks for the compound. The building block, that is, the smallest 
unit that retains the properties of the compound, of a compound made of 
covalent bonds, is called a molecule. For example, water (H 2 O), is a compound 
that in its pure form always contains hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a 2:1 ratio. 
The smallest unit of water is a molecule of water, H 2 O, held together through 
covalent bonds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Similarly, table salt, 
NaCl, is a compound that contains sodium and chlorine atoms in a 1:1 ratio. 
In table salt, sodium and chlorine atoms are held together through ionic bonds. 
Although atoms and ions play a great role in maintaining life in an organism, 
the true story of life begins at the molecular level. 
 The smallest functioning unit of life is a cell, which is largely composed of 
four types of molecules, commonly known as molecules of life: carbohydrates, 
proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. At the current stage of developments in 
biology, it is very important for biologists to realize a universal physical prin-
ciple: Each physical system left alone tends to acquire the most stable state, 
which is usually the state of minimum energy. Here are some examples of this 
principle expressing itself: water ﬂ owing from higher places to lower places, a 
pendulum when disturbed from its most stable state vibrating around it, chem-
ical reactions happening spontaneously by losing energy called Gibbs free 
energy, and chemical reactions reaching a state of equilibrium. This principle 
certainly has its hand in the evolution of life at the molecular level: A quest 
for stability brings the atoms together to make molecules and crystals, and 
unquestionably this stability principle must have played an important role in 
bringing the molecules together to make the ﬁ rst cell and the ﬁ rst unicellular 
organism. It also contributed to how those organisms evolved into multicel-
lular and more complex organisms. The stability principle may have made its 
mark on the existence (or lack) of symmetry in the shape of organisms: Why 
they are developed into one shape and not into another. 
 How do we study matter at the atomic and molecular levels? One of several 
methods is spectroscopy, the study of electromagnetic (EM) radiation (energy) 
emitted or absorbed by substances. It has been a great tool to probe the struc-
ture of matter to the molecular and atomic levels including cells, tissues, and 
body ﬂ uid. As a matter of fact, a substantial body of knowledge about atomic 
and molecular structure comes from spectroscopy. 
 As mentioned earlier, spectroscopy is based on studying the energy emitted 
or absorbed by the system. We can learn a great deal about the physical behav-
ior of a system (a molecule is also a system) by examining its motion. That 
makes energy an important physical variable to study systems of all size scales 
ranging from planets to molecules, to atoms, and to subatomic particles. The 
internal energy of a system is the sum of all kinetic and potential energies of 
all of its components. For example, the energy of a diatomic molecule, such as 
H 2 , includes the translational motion of the molecule through space, rotation 
of the molecule, vibration of atoms in the molecule, and energies of the elec-
trons in the atoms of the molecule. Also, keep in mind that molecules, like 
atoms, are bound systems and as we learned in the previous chapters, the 

A SYSTEM OF MOLECULES IN MOTION  327
energy of bound systems turns out to be quantized, that is, it only has certain 
discrete values. 
 So, the central theme of this chapter is to explain the behavior of molecules 
using quantum mechanics and spectroscopy. To this end, we will explore 
three features of molecular behavior: rotational, vibrational, and electronic 
states. 
 9.2  A SYSTEM OF MOLECULES IN MOTION 
 In our everyday life, we deal with a collection (or a system) of molecules 
rather than individual molecules. In solids and liquids the molecules have 
very little or no freedom to move around unlike what is found in a gas. A 
gas in a container is composed of atoms or molecules, which are in rapid 
motion, bouncing off each other and off the walls of the container. Their 
motion is called translational motion, that is, the motion of an object as a 
whole. As a result of work by many scientists including Robert Boyle, Jacques 
Charles, and Joseph Louis Gay - Lussac over a long time spanning from the 
seventeenth to the nineteenth century, it was realized that at low pressure, the 
product of pressure and volume is directly proportional to the absolute 
temperature:
 PV
CT
=
 
where  C  is the proportionality constant for a given gaseous system, that is, it 
is proportional to the number of molecules  N in the system. Therefore,  C can 
be written as:
 C
N
=κ
 
where   κ is the proportionality constant called the Boltzmann constant. It has 
been conﬁ rmed experimentally that the Boltzmann constant has the same 
value for any kind or amount of gas:
 κ =
×

1 381

.
J/K  
 Therefore, equation  PV  =  CT can be rewritten as:
 
 PV
NT

 (9.1) 
 It is convenient to refer to the amount of gas in terms of the number of 
moles; a mole of molecules contains a constant number of molecules called 
Avogadro ’ s number  N A :

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
 Chemistry students know that 1  mol of gas molecules will ﬁ ll a volume of 
22.4  L at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure), which is 1 - atm pressure 
and 0 ° C. Assuming the molecular system has  n mol, which amount to  N 
molecules. 
 This means,

 Therefore, Eq.  9.1 can be rewritten as:

where  R is given by

 Equation  9.2 is a famous equation in chemistry known as the ideal gas 
equation.  
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 9.1 
 How many molecules does a 22.4 - L container ﬁ lled with a mixture of nitrogen and 
oxygen gases contain at STP? 
 Hint : No calculations needed. 
 Solution: 
 A 22.4  L sample of any gas is equivalent to 1  mol of gas, which contains the number 
of molecules equal to Avogadro ’ s number, that is, 6.022  ×  10 23 . 
 An ideal gas is deﬁ ned as the gaseous system that obeys Eq.  9.2 for all 
pressures and the temperature  T is known as the absolute temperature, 
given in units of kelvin (K). The standard practice for the kelvin scale is to 
refer to the temperature as kelvin and not degree kelvin, and to use the symbol 
K not k. The kelvin is related to units of Celsius  ° C, by the following 
equation:
 K
C
= °
+ 273 15
.
 
 Therefore the absolute zero temperature is equal to  − 273.15 ° C. Note from 
the ideal gas equation that the volume of gas will be zero at absolute zero 
temperature; however, most of the gases turn into a liquid or a solid before 
that temperature is reached. 

BOND: THE ATOMIC BOND  329
 The ideal gas equation speciﬁ es how gases behave, but is not based on the 
reason they behave as they do. In 1857, Rudolf Clausius put the scattered work 
performed over a century into a theory called the kinetic molecular theory. 
The core points of this theory are summarized below: 
 1.  Gases consist of a large number of molecules, which are continuously in 
random motion. The word molecule refers to the smallest unit of a given 
gas: an atom or a molecule. The random motion provides the kinetic 
energy. 
 2.  The attractive and repulsive forces between gas molecules are 
negligible. 
 3.   The volume of the gas molecules is negligible compared to the volume 
of the gas container. 
 4.  The molecular collisions do not change the average kinetic energy of the 
molecules; the molecular collisions are elastic. 
 5.  The kinetic energy of the molecules is due to and directly proportional 
to the temperature of the gas. Therefore the average kinetic energy of 
molecules of different gases at the same temperature is the same. 
 So, in an ideal gas, molecules have energy due to the random motion in 
three - dimensional (3D) space, that is, the translational motion. Considering 
that molecules also exist in liquid and solid states, this is only part of the story 
because each molecule in the system in general will also have other motions, 
such as rotation and vibration, which will add to the total energy of the mol-
ecule, and hence the system. To understand those motions, we need to under-
stand the bonds between atoms in the molecules. 
 9.3  BOND: THE ATOMIC BOND 
 The EM force, also called the electrostatic or Coulomb force, which is dis-
cussed in Chapter  1 , is the dominant force that governs the dynamics and 
behavior of matter at the atomic and molecular levels. Recall from Chapter  1 
that due to the EM force, particles of opposite charge are attracted to each 
other and particles of like charges repel each other. This behavior governs the 
structure of atoms and molecules that tend to have a net zero charge, that is, 
an equal number of electrons and protons. As discussed in Chapter  1 , the EM 
force between entities of atomic and molecular sizes is much greater than the 
gravitational force between these entities; thus gravity does not play a role. 
Because life starts from a cell, which is largely composed of four types of 
molecules, EM force is also the dominant force that keeps organisms, including 
humans, together and functioning. 
 Through the EM force of attraction, atoms bond with each other to make 
molecules. These bonds are called atomic or molecular bonds. Although an 

330  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
atom overall is neutral, its neutrality does not come from having a zero - point 
charge; it comes from the balance of opposite charges, as it has both negative 
charge on its electrons and positive charge on protons in the nucleus. Therefore, 
when two atoms get close enough, they can experience each other ’ s charge 
and get affected by it. One of these affects is the bond, the atomic bond. These 
EM affects determined by the electron conﬁ guration of the involved atoms, 
discussed in Chapter  8 , give rise to two types of bonds: ionic and covalent 
bonds. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 9.2 
 Why it is the EM and not the nuclear or gravitational force that is responsible for 
binding atoms into molecules?  
 Solution: 
 As shown in Section  1.19.4 , the EM force is the only force that has enough strength 
and the range to be effective at the distance involved in binding atoms, that is, of 
the order of 10  − 10  m. 
 Gravitational force is too weak because atoms and electrons have such a small 
mass. 
 The range of the nuclear force is at a scale  ≤ 10  − 15  m, which is much smaller than 
the scale of atoms and molecules. 
 An ionic bond is formed when the two atoms involved in the bond are easily 
ionized. Sodium chloride, NaCl, is an example, where Na  +  and Cl  −  ions (and 
not Na and Cl atoms) bond with each other. This happens because Na, with 
an electronic conﬁ guration 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 1 , readily loses its outermost electron 
3s 1 to gain more stability and becomes Na  +  , whereas the Cl atom with an 
electronic conﬁ guration 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 5 readily accepts this electron to attain 
a more stable structure and becomes Cl  −  . Note that both Na  +  and Cl  −  have 
completely ﬁ lled shells. However, now they have opposite electric charges, and 
therefore get attracted to each other to form a bond called an ionic bond. 
 
 Note :  An ionic substance, such as NaCl, exists as 3D crystal arrays. Such a substance 
in its aqueous form breaks down into its ions. For example, NaCl exists in a 
3D structure, which breaks down into Na  +  and Cl  −  ions when dissolved in water. 
A molecular substance, such as water and methane (CH 4 ), exists in units of 
molecules. 
 When the two bonding atoms share one or more pairs of electrons rather 
than losing or gaining electrons, the bond between the two is called a covalent, 
rather than an ionic bond. The hydrogen molecule (H 2 ), and water (H 2 O) 

BOND: THE ATOMIC BOND  331
molecule, illustrated in Figure  9.1 , are examples of covalent bonds. The shared 
electrons spend more time in between the two atoms. Although there will be 
a repulsive force between the two electrons in the pair, each of these electrons 
will be attracted to the protons in the nuclei. The natural tendency will be to 
acquire a balance between the attractive and repulsive forces in order to 
obtain stability. For example, the balance between these repulsive and attrac-
tive forces in a hydrogen molecule occurs when the two atoms are at a separa-
tion of  ∼ 7.42  ×  10  − 11  m, where the molecule has a total negative energy of 
4.5  eV. You can consider this negative energy as a potential well in which the 
molecule is constrained. This provides a stable equilibrium for the molecule. 
 If you want to break up the molecule, you need to raise the energy from a 
negative value to zero. The amount of energy required to separate a compo-
nent from a system, such as a molecule from another molecule in a liquid, an 
atom from the molecule, an electron from an atom, and a proton from a 
nucleus, is called the binding energy. As Table  9.1 shows and Problem 9.8 
demonstrates, it only takes 0.16  eV /molecule of energy to overcome the inter-
molecular forces of attraction among the HCl molecules in order to vaporize 
liquid HCl. This energy is a lot less than the energy required to break up the 
H 2 molecule. Also, it takes more energy to separate an electron from the 
hydrogen atom (break up the atom) than to break up the H 2 molecule; that 
is, separate one H atom bonded to another H atom. It takes even greater 
energy to break up the nucleus of deuterium (D 2 , a heavy isotope of hydrogen 
with a proton and a neutron in its nucleus). From this, you can realize that it 
needs more and more energy to probe matter to smaller scales. For example, 
 Figure 9.1.  A water molecule formed from covalent bonds between one oxygen atom 
and two hydrogen atoms.

 STUDY CHECKPOINT 9.3 
 What is the energy of the H 2 molecule in its most stable state? 
 How much energy is needed to break up the H 2 molecule? 
 Solution: 
 Because the attractive and repulsive forces balance out at an energy of  − 4.5  eV, this 
is the energy at which the H 2 molecule is most stable. 
 Also, this determines the amount of enegy (4.5  eV) needed to break up the H 2 
molecule. 
you can break up the nucleus inside a lab the size of a room. However, to 
break up a proton, a constituent of the nuclei, you need a lab, such as hadron 
collider at CERN (Fig.  9.2 ). The lab includes a circular tunnel of 17 miles in 
circumference beneath the Franco – Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland, 
used to provide protons an energy of 7  TeV before they are smashed together 
head - on. 

BOND: THE ATOMIC BOND  333
 As mentioned earlier, atoms share valence electrons with one another to 
gain stability and in the process they make bonds. As a result of these bonds, 
molecules emerge. There are two electrons involved in a bond. As shown in 
Figure  9.1 for the water molecule, there could be nonbonding electron pairs, 
called lone pairs, as well. These nonbonding pairs and bonds around the 
central atom in a molecule are called electron domains. Electron domains 
are negatively charged, and therefore repel each other. The molecule takes 
the shape to minimize this repulsion energy, and therefore gain stability. The 
resulted molecular shape is deﬁ ned by the bond lengths and angles made 
by the bonds with one another, called bond angles. In other words, the 
quest for stability gives rise to beautiful natural molecular shapes based on 
electron domains. Some examples of electron domain geometry are presented 
in Table  9.2 . 
 As stated earlier, all substances are either elements or compounds. It is 
useful to categorize compounds into two categories: inorganic and organic. 
Organic compounds are the compounds that contain carbon and hydrogen, 
often in combination with other elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen.

TABLE 9.2. Continued 
Compounds that are not organic are called inorganic compounds. Inorganic 
compounds are mostly ionic, whereas organic compounds are mostly covalent. 
The smallest unit of a covalent compound that retains the properties of the 
compound is a molecule. In a nutshell, a molecule is an electrically neutral 
system of two or more atoms that are held together strong enough so they 
behave as a single particle. The simplest molecules are made of two atoms, 
called diatomic molecules. 
 9.4  DIATOMIC MOLECULES 
 As mentioned earlier, quantum mechanics can be applied at various levels of 
the material structure, such as electrons, atoms, and molecules. However, to 
truly study a molecule, we cannot ignore the fact that it is made of multiple 
atoms. It is often seen in physics, that we can simplify a problem by using the 
appropriate frame of reference. In this case, we treat a molecule in a reference 
frame called a center - of - mass (C.M.) system. You may be familiar with the 
C.M. reference frame from a course in introductory physics. For example, 
consider the C.M. of a system of two atoms. With respect to this C.M., the 

DIATOMIC MOLECULES  335
momenta  p of the two nuclei will always be equal and opposite to each other. 
Therefore, the energy equation can be written as:

where  p is the magnitude of the momentum of each of the two nuclei, and  m 1

We have substituted

 In other words, a system of two particles with masses  m 1 and  m 2 is equivalent 
to a single particle with mass   μ .

 Question:  
 Why will the momenta of the two nuclei in a molecule be equal and opposite in the 
C.M. frame? 
 Answer:  
 Because by deﬁ nition in a C.M. reference frame, the total momentum of the system 
is zero. 
 A great deal can be learned about the molecules by studying how they 
absorb, emit, and scatter EM radiation (energy); a study called molecular 
spectroscopy. Energy comes in two forms: potential and kinetic. The kinetic 
energy comes from the motion of the molecules. In that context, if you 
look down on matter from the molecular level, you see the following three 
activities giving rise to three kinds of molecular motion and the resulting 
energy states: 

336  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
 1.  Rotation.   Rotation of a molecule as a whole gives rise to rotational 
states separated by relatively small energy intervals typically on the 
order of 10  − 3  eV. The spectra arising from the transitions among these 
states fall in the microwave region with wavelengths ranging from 1  cm 
to 0.1  mm. 
 2.  Vibration.   Vibrations of atoms in the molecule relative to one another 
give rise to vibrational states separated by energy intervals typically on 
the order of 0.1  eV, larger than that of rotational states. The spectra 
arising from the transitions among these states fall in the infrared (IR) 
region with wavelengths ranging from 0.1  mm to 1  μ m. 
 3.  Electronic Conﬁ guration.   Changes of electron conﬁ guration inside 
atoms of the molecule, such as an electron, jumping from one principal 
level to another principal level, give rise to molecular electronic states. 
The typical separation between adjacent energy levels for these states is 
several electronvolts. The corresponding spectra fall in the visible and 
ultraviolet (UV) regions of EM spectrum. We have explored the absorp-
tion and emission spectra resulting from transition between electronic 
states. 
 All three kinds of activities mentioned above contribute to the energy 
of the molecule. Also, recall that emission and absorption spectra represent 
the release and absorption of energy, respectively. Therefore all three kinds 
of states will in general be represented by the absorption and emission 
spectra. We explored the electronic conﬁ guration in Chapter  8 . Next, 
we discuss rotation of the molecule and the vibration of atoms that make 
the molecule. 
 9.5  ROTATIONAL STATES OF MOLECULES 
 Here is a question that you can ask at this point: Why are we interested in the 
rotation of a molecule? The rotation of a molecule produces absorption 
and emission spectra due to transitions among different rotational states. By 
studying these spectra, we can learn much about the properties of the mole-
cules. This kind of study is generally referred to as molecular spectroscopy, 
very much like atomic spectroscopy based on emission and absorption by 
atoms. 
 Although in general the main principles discussed and conclusions drawn 
here apply to all molecules, we discuss diatomic molecules for the sake of 
simplicity. Consider a diatomic molecule, such as N 2 or CO, with two atoms of 
masses  m 1 and  m 2 , as illustrated in Figure  9.3 . You can model the bond between 
the two atoms as a massless rigid rod with length  R from the center of one 
atom to the center of the other atom when the molecule is in an equilibrium 
(stable) state.

 The transitions between various rotational states are constrained by the 
quantum mechanical selection rule:
 
 Δl = ±1  
 (9.11) 
 This means that upon emission, the photon carries away its intrinsic angular 
momentum of one quantum unit,   ħ . Equations  9.8 and  9.11 mean that a line 
in the absorption spectrum corresponds to the event when a molecule in rota-

ROTATIONAL STATES OF MOLECULES  339
tion state  l absorbs a photon to move to the excited state  l  +  1. Then the excited 
molecule will return from the  l  +  1 state to the  l state by emitting a photon. 
This will give rise to a line in the emission spectrum. The energy emitted by 
the molecule jumping from the  l  +  1 state to the  l state is equal to the energy 
gap between these two states calculated from Eq.  9.8 as follows:

 Equation  9.12 combined with Eq.  9.11 predicts that   Δ E for two consecutive 
rotational states of a diatomic molecule increase linearly with  l producing a 
regularly spaced rotational spectrum. Experimental observations support this 
prediction. For example, Figure  9.4 illustrates, according to the quantum theory 
discussed here, the typical absorption IR spectrum (rotational  +  vibrational) 
of a diatomic molecule, such as  12 C 16 O, where you can see the regularly spaced 
spectral lines (peaks). The missing peak at the center corresponds to the for-
bidden   Δ l  =  0 transition and is the prediction of the selection rule   Δ l  =  ± 1. In 
Section  9.7 , we will take a look at the spectral lines of a diatomic molecule 
(HCl) based on experimental data and see how they compare with quantum 
mechanical predictions just discussed. 
 Here is how you gain insight into the molecule from the spectral lines. The 
frequency (and hence energy) of the spectral lines can be measured and the 

340  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
transition that it corresponds to (i.e., the value of  l ) can be determined from 
the sequence of the spectral lines. From these data, the moment of inertia can 
be calculated by using Eq.  9.12 . From the moment of inertia, bond length  R 
can be calculated by using Eq.  9.10 . Problem 9.4 demonstrates this. 
 Freely moving molecules in a gas are always rotating regardless of whether 
they are vibrating or not because the rotational excitation energies are much 
smaller than the vibrational excitation energies. However, in liquids, the mol-
ecules are closer to each other and the interactions among them inhibit rota-
tion. Therefore, molecules in liquids can exhibit pure vibrational spectra, 
discussed next, in Section  9.6 . 
 9.6  VIBRATIONAL STATES OF MOLECULES 
 You learned about the harmonic oscillator in Section  6.6 . Diatomic molecules 
are the simplest molecular systems with harmonic vibrations. They present a 
simple but effective test bed for the quantum theory of harmonic vibrations. 
So, it is time to apply what we learned about harmonic vibrations in Section 
 6.6 . 
 As illustrated in Figure  9.5 , the two constituent atoms in a diatomic mole-
cule vibrate around the equilibrium point, which is reached when the nuclei 
of the two atoms are  ∼ 2 - Å (0.2  nm) apart. Therefore, the restoring force for 
small displacements from equilibrium is modeled by a harmonic motion 
potential. Although a diatomic molecule may also have a rotational motion, 
which was treated in Section  9.5 , here we only treat the vibrational motion. 
 There are two atoms involved here, but the Schr ö dinger equation is written 
for a single particle. So, this case is also another good example of how we 
model real - world problems to ﬁ t into the existing theoretical framework in 
 Figure 9.4.   Illustration of an IR spectrum of CO molecules in the gas phase.  Based on 
data from Dr. Tandy Grubbs, Professor, Department of Chemistry, Stetson University, 
DeLand, FL. 

VIBRATIONAL STATES OF MOLECULES  341
order to solve them. So, we will convert this two - atom problem into a one 
system problem in order to write the Schr ö dinger equation for it. Let us start 
by writing the total energy of the diatomic system:

where  m 1 and  m 2 are the masses of the nuclei for the two atoms,  v 1 and  v 2 are 
their speeds, and  V ( x ) is the potential energy due to the restoring force 
acting at a point  x distance away from the equilibrium point  x  =  0, that is, 
 V x

( ) = 1

 The quantum mechanical selection rule for transitions between two consecu-
tive vibrational states is
 
 Δn = ±1  
 (9.18) 
 This means that an oscillating dipole whose frequency is  f can only emit or 
absorb a photon of energy  hf , which makes sense. Note that from Eq.  9.17 the 
vibrational energy states are spaced at equal intervals:  ½  hf , 3/2  hf , 5/2  hf . This 
combined with Eq.  9.18 will give rise to equally spaced spectral lines with   Δ E 
between any two consecutive states (neighbor lines) equal to  hf . 
 You can ask How do you verify or compare these results with the experi-
mental observations? There are various ways of doing it. Here is one of many 
possible methods for this comparison: 
 1.  Experimentally observe the spectrum of radiation for a molecule. See if 
the spectral lines are equally spaced as predicted by the quantum number 
 n in the equation for  E n . 
 2.  Determine the frequency from the observed transition energy between 
two vibrational levels (energy states or spectral lines). 
 3.  From this frequency, calculate the force constant   κ for the molecule. 
 4.  These results can be used to check the consistency of the theory among 
different experiments. 

VIBRATIONAL STATES OF MOLECULES  343
 The experimentally observed frequencies and the calculated force constant 
for this frequency for multiple molecules are presented in Table  9.3 . 
 Equation  9.17  predicts that the ground - state energy (minimum radiation 
energy) of diatomic molecules is nonzero. This prediction was experimentally 
tested to be true by R.S. Mullikan in 1924; about the time when quantum 
theory was being developed.

 A careful reader may be a little confused here: While discussing rotation, 
we assumed that the bonds were rigid, and now while discussing vibrations, 
we are saying they vibrate. However, notice that by deﬁ nition vibration is 
around an equilibrium point. Therefore, assuming the bonds are rigid for treat-
ing rotation works well. 
 As mentioned earlier, although for simplicity we have only considered 
diatomic molecules, the main ideas can also be applied to more complex 
molecules. For example, a more complex molecule may have more modes 
of vibration (and rotation). Furthermore, some of these modes may apply 
to the whole molecule, and others only to speciﬁ c parts of the molecule, 
such as the  – OH group or  – NH 2 group. As shown in Table  9.4 , these groups 
may have their own characteristics frequencies of vibrations. As listed in 
Table  9.4 , the higher the number of bonds between the two carbon atoms, the 
greater is the frequency of vibrations. This is because the force constant 
increases, as expected, with an increase in the number of bonds between the 
two atoms. 
 As shown in Problem 9.7, it will take a temperature of  ∼ 4200  K to excite a 
molecule of HCl from the ground to the ﬁ rst excited vibrational state. This 
ﬁ nding should give you a realization that the vibrational levels are not ther-
mally excited at normal temperatures, such as room temperature. However, at 
an appropriate temperature, it is possible that a molecular system will have 
both the rotational and vibrational modes simultaneously. 
 9.7  COMBINATION OF ROTATIONS AND VIBRATIONS 
 In general, a molecule can absorb enough energy to get into excited rotational 
and excited vibrational states simultaneously. This general situation can be 
represented by the energy equation obtained by adding Eq.  9.8 and 9.17:

 Once a molecule is stimulated to an excited state with the absorption of a 
suitable energy, it emits a photon to come back to a more stable state with less 
energy. As illustrated in Figure  9.6 , in general, a wide spectrum of emitted 
photons corresponding to various rotational and vibrational transitions can be 
observed.

 STUDY CHECKPOINT 9.6 
 If EM radiation of energy greater than the energy difference between the two 
consecutive levels (  Δ E ), falls on a molecule, will the molecule absorb the energy? 
If yes, how will the excessive energy be used by the molecule? 
 Solution: 
 The molecule will absorb the photon and move to an appropriate excited state. The 
left out energy will be emitted in terms of a scattered photon. This process is called 
Raman scattering. 
 As we saw in the previous sections, quantum mechanics predicts equally 
spaced spectral lines corresponding to both rotational and vibrational transi-
tions. Following the same arguments, you can realize that Eq.  9.19 also predicts 
equally spaced spectral lines, as illustrated in Figure  9.7 , which shows a more 

346  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
closely spaced rotational spectrum superimposed on each vibration spectral 
line. Different intensities of the spectral lines illustrated in Figure  9.7 are due 
to different transition probabilities. The greater the transition probability the 
greater is the intensity of the corresponding line. Spectral lines corresponding 
to some transitions will be missing according to the selection rules discussed 
in Section  9.6 . These predictions are supported by the experimental observa-
tions, as demonstrated in Figure  9.8 , which presents the classic rotation –
 vibration absorption spectrum of HCl. 
 The absorption lines shown in Figure  9.8 represent transitions from the 
ground to excited vibrational state of HCl, and also represent changes in the 
rotational state. To be speciﬁ c, the rotational angular momentum changes by 
one during these transitions following the   Δ l  =  ± 1 selection rule. Note that in 
Figure  9.8 , the spectral lines are equally spaced as predicted by Eq.  9.19 .

COMBINATION OF ROTATIONS AND VIBRATIONS  347
 Let us take a closer look to see how Figure  9.8 , which is based on experi-
mental data, veriﬁ es the vibrational selection rule  Δ n  =  ± 1 and the rotational 
selection rule  Δ l  =  ± 1. The middle of the graph corresponding to frequency  f 0 
represents the ground vibrational state with vibrational energy  hf 0 /2. As dis-
cussed in the previous sections, each vibrational excitation from  n to  n  +  1 
from here to either side involves an absorption of an energy  hf 0 . Also, from 
Study Checkpoint  9.5 , each rotational excitation from  l to  l  +  1 absorbs an 
energy of 2 R c ( l  +  1). This means that when starting with the ground vibrational 
state the transitions corresponding to   Δ n  =  1 and   Δ l  =  1 give the transition 
energies:

and so on. 
 Also, note in Figure  9.8 that each spectral line is split due to the mass dif-
ference between  35 Cl and  37 Cl, which gives rise to different rotational inertia 
for these two isotopes. The higher line belongs to  35 Cl and the lower line rep-
resents  37 Cl. The absence of a spectral line  ∼ 8.65  ×  10 13  Hz (in the middle of 
the graph) corresponds to the forbidden   Δ l  =  0 transition, in accordance with 
the selection rule   Δ l  =  ± 1 for HCl. 
 
  Caution :   For diatomic molecules, such as NO, which have a nonzero elec-
tronic orbital angular momentum, you will see a spectral line in the middle 
of the graph, that is, corresponding to   Δ n  =  1,  Δ l  =  0.  
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 9.7 
 According to the selection rules, is it possible to a observe a spectral line corre-
sponding to a pure vibrational transition in diatomic molecules that have zero 
electronic orbital angular momentum?

QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
 Solution: 
 The answer is no according to the selection rule:
 Δl = ±1 
because the pure vibrational transition will correspond to
 Δl = 0  
 In other words, because the absorbed photon carries one unit of angular momen-
tum, the pure vibrational transition is not possible. 
 However, note that although selection rules are helpful in understanding the 
spectra, they may be violated when the conditions are not ideal. 
 PROBLEM 9.3 
 An HCl molecule is excited to its ﬁ rst excited state. It emits a photon of frequency 
1.2  ×  10 12  Hz to come back to the ground state. By using the rigid rotator model, 
calculate the bond length of the HCl molecule. Assume that the emitted energy is 
twice the rotational energy in the ﬁ rst excited state.

 Therefore the bond length of the HCl molecule is  ∼ 1.3  Å (0.13  nm). 
 To understand the uses of IR spectroscopy, realize how it works: When 
radiation in the IR region strikes a molecule, it causes the molecule to stretch, 
bend, or vibrate, and thereby changes the polarity of the molecule. The energy 
needed to stretch, bend, or vibrate is quantized, and a given molecule can 
vibrate only at speciﬁ c frequencies corresponding to speciﬁ c energy levels. 
Infrared spectroscopy is widely used in both research and industry as a reliable 
technique for making measurements and controlling quality. For example, it 
is used in both criminal and civil forensic analysis to identify polymer degrada-
tion. It is important to understand that IR techniques exploit the fact that 
molecules vibrate (and rotate) at speciﬁ c frequencies corresponding to dis-
crete energy levels. This fact is used to identify organic compounds because 
each compound produces a characteristic pattern that can be used to identify 
the molecule. The region from 200 to 1400  cm  − 1 is especially useful for this 
purpose and is therefore called the  ﬁ ngerprint region . Furthermore, IR helps 
to conﬁ rm or rule out the existence of functional groups in a molecule under 
study. This is how it works. When an organic molcule is exposed to EM radia-
tion, it absorbs the energy of a certain frequency (or wavelength) and transmits 
energy of some other frequency. When information is collected about energy 
released or absorbed in an experiment, information about functional groups 
can be deduced. This occurs because functional groups have characteristic IR 
absorptions that do not change from one compound to another. 

350  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
 Because most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in the nucleus, the 
rotational and vibrational energies of a molecule are mostly provided by the 
motion of the nuclei of the atoms in the molecule. The electrons in a molecule 
can also be excited to higher states, called higher energy levels, to give rise to 
electronic spectra. 
 9.8  ELECTRONIC STATES OF MOLECULES 
 In electronic transition spectra, each transition appears as a series of closely 
spaced spectral lines called a band, which demonstrates the fact that different 
rotational and vibrational states exist in each electronic state. All this means 
that in general, a molecule with a given electronic conﬁ guration can rotate and 
vibrate. 
 However, note that all molecules exhibit electronic spectra, but not all the 
molecules exhibit rotational and vibrational spectra. For example, H 2 and N 2 
do not exhibit rotational and vibrational spectra because they do not have a 
permanent dipole moment; but they do exhibit electronic spectra. 
 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 9.8 
 As you know by now, electrons in atoms bind atoms into crystals and molecules. 
Electrons in molecules (or atoms of molecules) also play an important role in 
the anatomy and physiology of biomolecules called molecules of life, such as DNA 
and proteins. Now, consider two biomolecules and assume that electrons in each of 
 Note :  Even though molecules with no electric dipole moment do not normally 
exhibit rotational spectra, the rotational states may be excited due to the collision 
of the molecules with each other or with the walls of the container. 
 Once a molecule in a ground state gets into an excited electronic state by 
absorbing some energy, it can lose that energy to come back to the original 
state by two possible ways: 
 1.  The molecule emits a photon of the same frequency (energy) as that of 
the photon that was absorbed. 
 2.  The molecule loses some of its energy in a collision with another 
molecule, and then loses the rest of the energy by transitioning from 
a lower to the original (ground) energy state. This process is called 
 ﬂ uorescence . 
 Obviously, the ﬂ uorescent radiation has a lower frequency than that of the 
absorbed radiation. This is the key to ﬂ uorescence. 

LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD  351
these molecules are too tightly bound to leave the molecule, according to the laws 
of classical physics. 
 According to quantum mechanics, however, the electrons from one biomolecule 
can jump into the other molecule, even if they are forbidden by classical physics to 
do so. Which quantum mechanics principle allows this phenomenon? 
 Solution: 
 Quantum tunneling. 
 To summarize, changes of electron conﬁ guration inside atoms of the mol-
ecule, such as an electron jumping from one principal level to another principal 
level, give rise to molecular electronic states. These transitions are discussed 
in several chapters in different contexts, including Chapters  4 and  8 . So, we 
will not give more coverage to this topic here. However, recall that we dis-
cussed earlier how the emission spectra of molecules can be used in the chemi-
cal analysis of substances. Similarly, looking from substance level, the emission 
spectrum of a chemical element (or chemical compound) represents the rela-
tive intensity of each frequency of EM radiation emitted by the atoms and 
molecules of the substance when they return to a ground state. Because the 
emission spectrum of each element is unique, spectroscopy can be used to 
identify the elements in matter of unknown composition. 
 9.9  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 Based on its understanding through quantum mechanics, molecular spectros-
copy has numerous applications in various ﬁ elds, including health sciences. For 
example, ﬂ uorescence in molecules excited by UV light has several applica-
tions, including identifying minerals and biochemical compounds. Another 
example is a ﬂ uorescent lamp (see Fig.  9.9 for an example) that contains a 
mixture of mercury vapors and an inert gas, such as argon, inside a glass tube, 
which has obvious practical applications. When a current is passed through the 
tube, the mixture inside it gives off UV radiation. The inside of the tube is 
coated with a ﬂ uorescent material called a phosphor, which absorbs UV radia-
tion and emits visible light. The ﬂ uorescent process is much more efﬁ cient than 
the process of heating a ﬁ lament in an ordinary light bulb called an incandes-
cence bulb. 
 Molecular Raman spectroscopy is an optical technique that provides a 
measure of the molecular composition of tissue by analyzing the way that 
tissue scatters laser light. It has long been considered a valuable tool for early 
detection and diagnosis of diseases. For example, it offers us the ability to 
provide speciﬁ c biochemical information that may foreshadow the onset of 
cancer and other life - threatening illnesses. Here is how it works. Disease 

352  
QUANTUM MECHANICS OF MOLECULES 
symptoms are almost always preceded by changes in the molecular composi-
tion of tissue or body ﬂ uids. Raman spectrum provides structured and detailed 
information about cell and tissue composition without the need for using dyes, 
labels, or other contrast - enhancing agents. Peaks in the Raman spectrum cor-
respond to known molecular signatures in tissues. The disease symptoms can 
be detected by comparing the Raman spectrum of the suspect tissue with that 
of healthy tissue. This way Raman spectroscopy offers us the ability to pre-
cisely diagnose a wide range of disease states. In short, the chemical structural 
change of cells and tissues detected by Raman spectroscopy is a good indicator 
of disease. 
 Devices have been developed that demonstrated the ability of Raman 
spectroscopy to successfully distinguish between normal and diseased tissues 
of, for example, the arteries, brain, breast, colon, cervix, and skin. Furthermore, 
these devices can be used to monitor and analyze various body ﬂ uids, and to 
detect abnormalities in the eyes. 
 Raman spectroscopy has also found its way into the dental ﬁ eld. Researchers 
have found that areas of decay with signiﬁ cant bacterial activity are highly 
ﬂ uorescent. This could facilitate locating hard - to - detect infections beneath the 
surface of a tooth. The ability of Raman spectroscopy to locate these underly-
ing infections by distinguishing them from healthy tissue could provide power-
ful diagnostic tool for dentists. 
 Understanding molecular vibrations in terms of IR radiation also helps us 
to understand issues, such as global warming. Earth absorbs radiation from 
the sun. Some of this radiation absorbed by the Earth is re - emitted into the 
atmosphere as IR radiation. Some gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon

SUMMARY  353
dioxide, water vapors, nitrous oxide, and methane, have the property of absorb-
ing IR radiation; and some other gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen (the major 
gases in the atmosphere) do not have this property. The gases that absorb IR 
radiations are called greenhouse gases because they behave much like the 
glass panes in a greenhouse, which absorb the heat of the sun, but keep it from 
escaping. When a greenhouse gas molecule absorbs IR radiation, it bends and 
vibrates, and therefore gains kinetic energy by this absorption of IR radiation. 
Some of this kinetic energy ﬂ ows to other molecules, such as oxygen and 
nitrogen. The result is general heating of the atmosphere called global warming. 
While the greenhouse gases on Earth help maintaining life, problems arise 
when the atmospheric concentrations of these gases increase above certain 
levels. 
 For example, Figure  9.10 presents global annual surface temperatures rela-
tive to 1951 – 1980 mean temperatures from the data collected by the Goddard 
Institute for Space Studies, NASA. This analysis summarizes satellite measure-
ments from 1982 onward, and ship - based analysis from years earlier. The 
estimated error reﬂ ected from the 95% conﬁ dence level accounts for the 
incomplete spatial coverage.

atoms, have molecular, rotational, and vibrational states because they can

 Transitions between rotational states and between vibrational states give rise 
to absorption and emission spectra. Useful information about a molecule can 
be obtained from these spectra including bond angles, bond length, and force 
constants. 
 Because excitation energies for molecular rotation is much smaller, the 
molecules in a gas are almost always rotating. However, in the liquid phase, 
interactions between adjacent molecules inhibit rotation. Therefore, a pure 
vibrational spectrum can only be observed in the liquid phase. Molecules 
usually do not vibrate at normal temperatures, such as room temperature, 
because the size of excitation energies for vibration requires very high 
temperatures. 
 In our physical world, so many phenomena, even at the microscale level, 
involve systems composed of a great number of fundamental entities, such as 
atoms and molecules. Therefore, to understand matter at the molecular and 
atomic level, not only do we need to understand the behavior of individual 
atoms and molecules, but we also need to understand the collective behavior 
for a set of atoms and molecules. This is where statistical quantum mechanics 
enters into the picture, which we discuss in Chapter  10 .

 10.1  INTRODUCTION 
 Matter is composed of fundamental entities, such as atoms and molecules, 
which we loosely refer to in this book as particles. Even at the microscale level, 
many phenomena in our physical world involve systems of a large number of 
particles. For example, the cell, the basic unit of life, is composed of largely 
four kinds of molecules (carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids such as deoxy-
ribonucleic acid [DNA], and lipids) with a great number of them in each cell. 
For example, based on the chemical instructions written on the DNA mole-
cules, a cell makes thousands of types of protein molecules to support our 
human body. Each cell of our body has 46 DNA molecules, and each molecule 
is packed in a structure called a chromosome; we inherit these molecules from 
our parents. Keep in mind that there are a multi - trillion cells in an average 
human body. We will discuss all four of these types of molecules further in 
Chapter  11 . 
 To understand the behavior of a collection of molecules, it is apparent 
that we need to understand the overall behavior of a system of a great many 
 Mathematics is the language of science. Statistics, which is the science of collecting and 
making effective use of numerical data relating to groups of individual entities includ-
ing people, atoms, and molecules, is an important part of mathematics. The data may 
come from surveys or from experiments. Statistics deals with different aspects of data 
including planning for data collection, data collection, analysis, and interpretation. 
Planning for data collection includes designing surveys or experiments. The beauty of 
statistics for a physicist lays in the fact that its basic principles apply equally to both 
classical and quantum physics. 

358  
STATISTICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS
particles and how it is related to the properties of individual constituent par-
ticles. This is exactly the issue that statistical mechanics addresses. However, 
recall that quantum mechanics brought statistics into the picture at the indi-
vidual particle level. You learned very early on in this book that the quantum 
mechanical wave function,   Ψ , which contains all the information about a par-
ticle it represents, is based on probability: a fundamental concept in statistics. 
For example, the position of an electron in an atom is described in terms of 
probability distribution represented by |  Ψ | 2 . 
 The three most important things to realize about statistical mechanics 
follow: 
 1.  Statistical mechanics does not directly deal with the motion and interac-
tions of individual particles. It deals instead with the whole system, and 
with the question of what is most likely to happen. 
 2.  Statistical mechanics cannot be used to track an individual particle in the 
system over time, it does help us to determine the probability that the 
particle has a certain amount of energy or is at a certain position at a 
given moment. 
 3.  The basic general concepts of statistics apply equally to classical and 
quantum mechanics. 
 To keep things simple, we are considering systems of identical particles that 
may or may not be distinguishable (physically) from one another. Therefore, 
the central theme of this chapter is to explain how statistical quantum mechan-
ics can be used to study systems of particles, such as electrons, photons, atoms, 
and molecules. To this end, the three underlying streams of thought in this 
chapter are the framework for statistical distributions, statistical distributions 
for distinguishable identical particles, and statistical distributions for identical 
indistinguishable particles. 
 10.2  STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS 
 You already know that the motion or dynamics of a particle is described by 
using some variables, such as speed and energy. However, in a system of par-
ticles, in general, all the particles will not have the same value for a physical 
quantity, such as speed and energy, at a given time. In statistics, you will also 
be dealing with the same basic variables, such as speed and energy, but with 
two changes: We will be concerned with the system of particles, not just indi-
vidual particles, and with the probability of these variables, for example, how 
many particles have this much speed, and so on. Variables with probabilities 
attached to them are called probability or statistical distributions. In this book, 
you should have realized by now that the concept of energy and the corre-
sponding energy variable is common to an individual particle, and a system of 
particles, in classical and quantum mechanics. 

STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS  359
 Thermodynamics, a ﬁ eld that originally belonged to physics, but is very 
relevant to many other disciplines (e.g., chemistry, mechanical engineering, 
and health sciences) is based on the concept of energy. A system of  N particles, 
such as a collection of molecules or atoms, has an overall energy  E as a result 
of the energy of the individual particles. Furthermore, there will be a distur-
bance as a result of the energy, but the natural tendency of the system will be 
to settle into a state of stability, that is, a state of thermal equilibrium. A rel-
evant question to ask is How can we determine the most probable way in 
which the total amount of energy  E is distributed among the  N particles in the 
system that is in thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature  T ? We can use 
statistical mechanics to determine that way. In other words, by using statistical 
mechanics we can determine how many particles have energy  E 1 , how many 
particles have energy  E 2 , and so on. 
 A system is after all made up of particles. So, to start with, note the follow-
ing three features of particles in the system: 
 1.  At a given moment, each particle is in a certain state called the particle 
state, and in general more than one particle state may correspond to the 
same speciﬁ c energy. 
 2.  Particles in the system are not strongly correlated. Within this limit, 
however, they can interact with each other and with the walls of the 
container to establish equilibrium. 
 3.  If the particles in the system are not subject to the exclusion principle, 
discussed earlier in this book, more than one particle can exist in the 
same state. 
 Given this, realize that there is more than one possible way in which the total 
energy of the system can be distributed among the  N particles of the system, 
each way corresponding to one energy distribution. Furthermore, realize that 
there are in general multiple ways in which the particles can be arranged among 
the available states to yield a speciﬁ c energy distribution. Assume that each 
state of a particular energy has an equal chance of being occupied by a particle. 
This scenario leads to a basic principle of statistical mechanics: 
 The greater the number of different ways ( N W ) in which particles can be 
arranged among different available states to achieve a speciﬁ c energy distribu-
tion, the more probable is that energy distribution. 
 
 Note :  To some of us, the assumption that  each state of a certain energy has an equal 
chance of being occupied is statistical common sense. However, this assumption is 
also supported by experiments. 
 The core underlying issue throughout this chapter is to determine the dif-
ferent fractions of molecules in different states, or the population probability 
distribution. In general, you can ﬁ nd several ways in which the particles can 

360  
STATISTICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS
be arranged among available states, and the most probable way will be for 
which  N W is maximum. Each way will involve determining the number of 
particles with energy  E i by using the following formula:
 
 n E
g E
f E
i
i
i
(
) =
(
) (
)  
 (10.1) 
where,
  •   The term  n ( E i ) is the number of particles with energy  E i in a discreet 
distribution, and  n ( E i ) dE i is the number of particles that contain energy 
between  E i and  E i  +  dE i in a continuous distribution. 
  •   The term  g ( E i ) is the number of available states of energy  E i in a discreet 
distribution, and  g ( E i ) dE i is the number of available states with energy in 
the range of  E i and  E i  +  dE i in a continuous distribution. This can also be 
interpreted as the statistical weight or the density of states, for example, 
states per unit energy. 
  •   The term  f ( E i ) is the probability that each state of energy  E i will be occu-
pied, which is equal to the average number of particles in each state of 
energy  E i . It is also called the distribution function. 
 Make sure that you feel comfortable with Eq.  10.1 , as it simply states the 
fact that the number of particles in a given energy state is equal to the number 
of available states with that speciﬁ c energy multiplied by the probability that 
each of these states will be occupied by a particle. Therefore, Eq.  10.1 is a very 
general equation that applies to classical as well as quantum situations. Most 
of the statistical efforts go into ﬁ guring out the distribution function  f ( E i ), 
which depends on the nature of the particles in the system. 
 Similarly, we can write distributions for other variables. For example, we 
can rewrite Eq.  10.1 for velocity as:
 
 n v
g v
f v
i
i
i
( ) =
( ) ( )  
 (10.2) 
 In our treatment here, the particles in the system under study are assumed 
to be identical. However, the question is Can those particles be physically 
distinguished from each other? Identical particles with an effective quantum 
spin cannot be distinguished from each other because their wave functions 
will overlap. However, the identical particles with no spin can be distinguished 
from each other assuming they are sufﬁ ciently apart from each other. This is 
the case we consider next, in Section  10.3 . 
 10.3  MAXWELL – BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTION 
 James Clerk Maxwell, the same scientist who put together Maxwell ’ s 
equations discussed in Section  1.16 , was among the ﬁ rst scientists to apply 
mathematical theories of probability and statistics to physical problems in the 
ﬁ eld of thermodynamics. He derived equations for the distribution of speeds 

MAXWELL–BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTION  361
and velocities of molecules in an ideal gas and demonstrated that these distri-
butions can be used to explain the phenomena observed at the macroscopic 
level. According to the distribution originally derived by Maxwell in 1859, the 
number of molecules with a speed between  v and  v  +  dv is given by

of the system of  N molecules in kelvins.

 Figure  10.1 illustrates this distribution for oxygen at three different tem-

873.2  K the temperature between the melting point of zinc (Zn) and plutonium 
(Pt). Note that the distribution spreads out and the peak shifts to the right 
with an increase in temperature. 
 Let us try to understand Eq.  10.3 in terms of Eq.  10.2 . By comparing these 
two equations, the speed (or velocity) distribution function can be written as:

Maxwell – Boltzmann energy distribution function, which represents the prob-
ability that the state (or states) corresponding to energy  E i will be occupied. 
The constant  A in Eq.  10.5 called the normalization constant, depends on the 
number of particles in the system.

 James Clerk Maxwell 
(1831 – 1879) 
 James Clerk Maxwell, one of the greatest 
physicists of the nineteenth century, was born 
on June 13, 1831 in Edinburgh, Scotland. 
Maxwell studied physics at the University of 
Cambridge, UK, taught at a college in 
Scotland, and later at King ’ s college, London. 
Maxwell ’ s greatest contribution to physics is 
the uniﬁ cation of apparently three different 
phenomena called electricity, magnetism, and 
light into one phenomenon called 
electromagnetism (EM) in terms of four 
equations, famously known as Maxwell ’ s 
equations. 
 Maxwell also developed a successful 
theory of kinetic gases. His work  Theory of 
Heat , in 1871, laid the foundations for what is 
now called statistical mechanics. Maxwell, the 
greatest theoretical physicist of the 
nineteenth century, lost his life to cancer at 
the young age of 48 in 1879, the same year in 
which Albert Einstein was born. Einstein 
became the greatest theoretical physicist of 
the twentieth century.  
 
 Ludwig Boltzmann (1844 – 1906) 
 Ludwig Boltzmann was born on February 20, 
1844 in Vienna, Austria. He studied physics at 
the University of Vienna. He taught physics 
and mathematics at the University of Graz 
and later at the University of Vienna. 
Boltzmann is mostly remembered for his 
famous work on the statistical nature of 
entropy. Both Maxwell and Boltzmann 
worked independently to develop laws that 
govern the statistical behavior of a system of 
classical particles. Boltzmann was a champion 
of the atomic theory of matter that was still 
controversial during the late nineteenth 
century, and he had a tremendous admiration 
for Darwin ’ s theory of evolution. 
 Boltzmann spent the last years of his life 
mostly defending his theories and battling 
with nonbelieving scientists. In the process, 
he became victim to health problems, such as 
asthma, headaches, and increasingly poor 
eyesight, which threw him into depression. 
He committed suicide on September 5, 1906 
at the age of 62.

 Let us use this probability distribution to ﬁ nd the distribution of energies 
among the  N molecules in the system. Assume that  N is large enough so that 
we could consider the distributions as continuous. Therefore, by using Eqs.  10.1 
and  10.5 , the number of molecules  n ( E i ) dE i that contain energies in the range 
of  E i and  E i  +  dE i can be represented by the equation:

MAXWELL–BOLTZMANN DISTRIBUTION  365
 Our next task is to determine the expression for  g ( E i ) dE i , the number of 
available states in the energy range of  E i and  E i  +  dE i . For each energy  E i , 
there is a magnitude of momentum  P i , which has three degrees of freedom 
represented by its three components:  P ix ,  P iy , and  P iz . Each set of values for 
 P ix ,  P iy , and  P iz represent a different momentum state. Because there are three 
degrees of freedom, you can think of the momentum space as a sphere with 
radius  P i . The number of states in momentum space therefore is proportional 
to the volume of this sphere: The underlying assumption here is that you are 
dealing with point particles, that is, structureless particles: no rotational or 
vibrational evnrgy. 
 The number of momentum states in the spherical shell of thickness  dP i is 
proportional to the volume of this spherical shell, which is equal to  4

In other words, the number of momentum states,  g ( P i ) dP i in the momentum

 Each value for the magnitude of momentum gives rise to a unique value of 
energy. Therefore the number of energy states  g ( E i ) dE i are equal to the 
number of momentum states  g ( P i ) dP i . This means, by using Eq.  10.8 , we obtain

 There are 2 l  +  1 states corresponding to a speciﬁ c  l .

 E i shown along the x - axis in units of  κ T . Note that the distribution curve

there is a lower limit on energy to be 0, whereas there is no upper limit

 Note :   As Eqs.  10.17 and  10.18 demonstrate, the energy of the system of molecules 
and the average energy of a molecule in the system are independent of the molecu-
lar mass. 
 As mentioned earlier, a molecule in an ideal gas system has three degrees 
of freedom corresponding to motion in three independent directions:  x ,  y , and 
 z . Because the average energy of a molecule is  3
2κT , we can assign an energy 
of  1
2κT to each degree of freedom. This is called equipartition of energy. 
 
 Equipartition Theorem :  For a system of particles in thermal equilibrium at 
absolute temperature  T , the average energy per degree of freedom of a particle 
is  1

MOLECULAR SYSTEMS WITH QUANTUM STATES  369
 The Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function is generally used to handle 
classical systems and works remarkably well in explaining the behavior 
of gases. However, as Problem  10.1 demonstrates, it can also be used in semi-
classical (or semiquantum) treatment in which the number and energy of 
states are determined from quantum mechanics, a situation discussed next in 
Section  10.4 .

 E i will be occupied is directly proportional to  e

the energy  E i of a state corresponds to one of a set of discrete energy states 
as opposed to a continuum of states or energies in classical mechanics. This 
means, the probability that the molecular system occupies the energy state  E i 
is proportional to  e

 PROBLEM 10.2 
 Consider a rigid diatomic molecule in a system of molecules that acts as an ideal 
gas system in thermal equilibrium at temperature  T . The molecule rotates around 
an axis perpendicular to the bond axis between the two atoms. The molecule also 
has translational motion. 
 A.  How many degrees of freedom does the molecule have? 
 B.  What is the average energy of the molecule as a function of  T ? 
 Solution: 
 A.  A rigid diatomic molecule will have three degrees of freedom corresponding to 
translational motion, and two degrees of freedom corresponding to rotation. 
This is because translational motion can happen in 3D space, that is, a particle 
can move in the  x ,  y , or  z dimension, and rotational motion only needs two 
dimensions. Therefore the molecule has ﬁ ve degrees of freedom. 
 B.  The average energy per degree of freedom is  1
2κT. Therefore energy for ﬁ ve 
degrees of freedom  =  5
2κT.

 Use Eq.  10.16 to realize this answer. 
 In quantum mechanics, there is a discrete set of energy states with each 
state occupied by a certain number of molecules at a given temperature. A 
valid question to ask is What is the probability of ﬁ nding a given molecule in 
the quantum state  i with energy  E i ? This is the same question as How many 
molecules, or what fraction of the molecules, are occupying energy state  E i ? 
To ﬁ nd the fraction, we need to bring the total number of molecules in the 
system into the picture. Because we have a set of discrete energy states with 
 N 1 molecules in energy state  E 1 ,  N 2 molecules in energy state  E 2 , and so on; 
we can sum over all population numbers corresponding to different states to 
obtain the total number of molecules  N in the system:

 The letter  Z for the partition function stands for the German word

tion because it encodes how the probabilities are split (or partitioned) among 
the different quantum states, based on their individual energies. As demon-
strated in Problem  10.3 , the partition function also plays the role of a normal-
ization constant.

 To sum up, the equations in this section allow us to determine the distribu-
tion of  N  molecules of a system, which is in thermal equilibrium at temperature 
 T , over all given quantum states corresponding to discrete energies  E i . This 
treatment may sound very theoretical. To make the situation more practical, 
we apply these equations to vibrating and rotating molecules in the forthcom-
ing sections. Recall from Chapter  9  that molecules may have vibrational, 
rotational, and translational energies corresponding to vibrational, rotational, 
and translational motion. 
 10.5  DISTRIBUTION OF VIBRATIONAL ENERGIES 
 In Section  9.6 , we explored vibrations of a molecule by using quantum 
mechanics. Now, we are dealing with a system of molecules. Here, we are 

372  
STATISTICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS
interested in ﬁ nding out the following two distributions for the vibrating 
molecules: 
 1.  The total vibrational energy of a system of  N molecules as a function of 
temperature  T . 
 2.  The number of molecules  N n , and hence the fraction of molecules in a 
vibrational state  n , where  n is the vibrational quantum number. 
 10.5.1  Vibrational Energy 
 The vibrational mode of a molecule can be modeled to a harmonic oscillator. 
To arrive at the distributions for the vibrating molecules, we begin with one

DISTRIBUTION OF VIBRATIONAL ENERGIES  373
 Now the question is What is the probability that a given molecule will occupy 
the energy state  E n corresponding to a quantum number  n . The same question 
can be phrased as What is the population probability density; that is, the fraction 
of molecules occupying the energy state  E n . Let us enquire in the next section.

 Population probability  P n is given by

 This is the probability that a molecule will be in energy state  E n . Figure  10.4 
illustrates this probability by plotting it at  T  =  300  K for two types of mole-
cules:  19 F 35 Cl and  127 I 35 Cl. Note that the term  hf in Eq.  10.30 a for  P n represents 
the energy gap   Δ E between different vibrational states. This gap is known to 
be 15.6  ×  10  − 21  J for  19 F 35 Cl and 7.63  ×  10  − 21  J for  127 I 35 Cl at 300  K, which is the 
approximate room temperature. 
 As is clear from Figure  10.4 , at room temperature most of the molecules 
for FCl and ICl are in the ground ( n  =   0) state. A small proportion is distrib-
uted over higher states. As the temperature increases, more and more mole-
cules transistion into higher vibrational states. 
 10.5.3  Correspondence with Classical Mechanics 
 We can prove that at very high temperature the total vibrational energy of 
the molecular system is approximately equal to that predicted by classical 
statistics.

 This is in accordance with the equipartition theorem derived from the clas-

two degrees of freedom, its energy will be   κ T ,  ½  κ T for each degree of freedom 
according to the equipartition theorem, and the energy of  N molecules will be 
 N κ T .

STATISTICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS
 In a nutshell, for high enough temperature, the system behaves as a classical 
system if we use the Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function, even if we use 
quantum mechanics to determine the number of states. Molecules in the 
system can also have rotational energies. 
 10.6  DISTRIBUTION OF ROTATIONAL ENERGIES 
 In Section  9.5 , we explored rotations of a molecule by using quantum mechan-
ics. Now, we are dealing with a system of molecules. We are interested in 
ﬁ nding out the following two distributions for the rotating molecules: 
 1.  The total rotational energy of the system of  N molecules as a function 
of temperature  T . 
 2.  The number of molecules  N l , and hence the fraction of molecules in a 
vibrational state  l , where  l is the rotational (or angular momentum) 
quantum number. 
 10.6.1  Rotational Energy 
 To arrive at the energy distribution for the rotating molecules, we begin with 
one rotating diatomic molecule. As we know from Section  9.5 , the rotational 
energy  E l of a diatomic molecule with reduced mass   μ in terms of atomic 
masses  m 1 and  m 2 is

the constant  R c as:

 Note that there is only one vibrational energy state corresponding to 
the vibrational quantum number  n of a molecule, whereas there are 2 l  +  1 
rotational energy states corresponding to the rotational quantum number  l of 
the molecule. 
 10.6.2  Population Probability of Rotational States

where  N l is the number of molecules in the energy state  E l and  N is the total

ing to each  l , the number  N l of molecules in energy state  l , according to Eqs.

 (10.35) 
 In Eq.  10.35 ,  P l is the probability that a molecule will be in energy state  E l . 
It is also the fraction of molecules in energy state  E l . 
 Figure  10.5 illustrates this probability by plotting it at  T  =  300  K, which is 
approximately the room temperature, for two types of molecules:  19 F 35 Cl 
and  127 I 79 Br. The rotational constant  R c for FCl is taken to be 1.02  ×  10  − 23  J 
corresponding to a bond length  a  =  163  pm, and the rotational constant  R c for 
IBr is taken to be 0.110  ×  10  − 23  J corresponding to a bond length  a  =  247  pm. 
 As Figure  10.5 demonstrates, in contrast to vibrational states (Fig.  10.4 ), the 
most probable state of a molecule at room temperature is not the ground state, 
but rather an excited state. Furthermore, given that IBr has a smaller energy 
level spacing than FCl, Figure  10.5 demonstrates that as the energy level 

380  
STATISTICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS
spacing decreases, the rotational population probability distribution gets 
broader and its peak shifts toward the higher excited states. 
 Let us turn our discussion back to the rotational energy of the molecular 
system, to see if we could see the correspondence principle in action in the 
rotational energy as well. 
 10.6.3  Correspondence with Classical Mechanics

mass  μ is

 Note that at a temperature  T  =  0,  E r  =  0, almost all the molecules will be in 
their ground state (the lowest energy state). However, as the temperature 
increases, more and more molecules occupy the higher energy states. At high 
enough temperature, it can be shown that Eq.  10.36 will result in
 
 E
N T
r =
κ
 
 (10.37) 
 This is the same result as predicted by the equipartition theorem. Hence, in 
the high - temperature limit, the limit where a large number of quantum states 
are activated, quantum mechanics predicts the same total rotational energy of 
the system as classical physics; reappearance of the correspondence principle.

 At very low temperature, that is,  T  =  0: 
 A.  What will be the value of total energy  E r ? 
 B.  What will be the value of the quantum number  l ? 
 Do not use Eq.  10.37 . 
 Solution: 
 A. 
 For  T  =   0, the term  e
E

l
−(

/κ  reaches 0. Therefore, from Eq.  10.36 :
 Er = 0  
 B. 
 When
 Er = 0  
 each  E l will be zero as well. Therefore, from Eq.  10.32 
 l  =  0; the ground state. 
 In addition to rotating and vibrating, a molecule also moves as a whole 
giving rise to translational energy.

DISTRIBUTION OF TRANSLATIONAL ENERGIES  383
 The graphs are shown at temperatures 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, and 1000  K. 
The ﬁ gure demonstrates that the maximum probability at low temperatures is 
at  n  =  0. This means that a given molecule at low temperature is most likely 
to be found in its ground translational state ( n  =  0), or the large number of 
molecules at low temperature are in their ground states ( n  =  0). As the tem-
perature increases, more and more molecules transition to excited states. Also, 
as the temperature increases, the graph is getting ﬂ at; that is, the population 
probability is becoming independent of the quantum numbers, and hence the 
predictions of quantum mechanics are getting closer to those of classical 
mechanics. 
 From Eq.  10.39 , the total translational energy of the system can be written as:

 To approximate the quantum consideration into the classical one, we assume 
that there are many quantum states in the system and their corresponding 
energies are very closely spaced. In other words, the discrete distribution in 
Eq.  10.42 can be replaced with continuous distribution represented by inte-
grals. In this case, as Problem 10.10 demonstrates:

 which is in accordance with the partition theorem given that the translational

Note that  E t in Eq.  10.43 is independent of the mass of the molecule.

STATISTICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS
 In the last few sections, we covered a substantial amount of material to 
describe the vibrational, rotational, and translational states of molecular 
systems or assemblies of identical, but distinguishable, molecules (or particles). 
For some of you, the mathematics we have gone through may be rather 
overwhelming. So, it is worth the effort to summarize the core points to build 
a big picture of the quantum statistics of distinguishable particles. 
 10.8  QUANTUM STATISTICS OF DISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES: 
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER 
 For vibrational, rotational, and translational motion of  N molecules in a system 
of molecules, we explored the answers to three fundamental questions: 
 1.  What is the quantum mechanical expression for the energy  E n of a mol-
ecule due to each of these three kinds of motion: vibrational, rotational, 
and translational?  
 2.  What is the total energy of the molecular system for each of these three 
kinds of motion?  
 3.  What fraction of molecules  N n / N are in a given quantum mechanical 
state corresponding to a speciﬁ c energy state  E n , that is, a speciﬁ c quantum 
number  n ? This fraction deﬁ nes the population probability  P  =  N n / N 
distribution for the quantum states of the system of particles, that is, how 
different available quantum states are occupied by the particles in the 
system. 
 The quantum mechanical expressions for the energy of individual molecules 
for these three kinds of motion were derived in Chapter  9 . The basic expres-
sion for the fraction of molecules occupying a speciﬁ c state (the population 
probability) is

 Because the expressions for  E i is different for each of three kinds of motion 
(vibrational, rotational, and translational) the speciﬁ c expressions for  Z and 
 P i are also different. 
 The speciﬁ c expressions for these three quantities are presented in Table 
 10.1 , where the rotational constant  R c in this table is given by

 (10.46) 
 For each of these three kinds of motion, you learned the following three 
important lessons: 
 1.  At low temperature, most of the molecules are in their ground states, 
that is, minimum energy states. 
 2.  As the temperature increases, more and more molecules transition to the 
excited states, that is, states with higher energies. 
 3.  At high enough temperature, a large number of quantum states are 
occupied by the molecules and the quantum mechanical results begin to 
agree with the classical mechanics results. This is an expression of the 
correspondence principle. 
 So far, we have been treating the particles in the system under the assump-
tion that although they are identical, they are distinguishable from one another. 
This means that the particles are physically separated from each other, which 
in quantum mechanics means that their wave functions either do not overlap 
or the overlap is negligibly small. This also means that particles in the system 
are not strongly correlated. Particles of an ideal gas obeying the kinetic molec-
ular theory discussed in Section  9.2 are an example. Although within this limit, 
they can interact with each other and with the walls of the container to estab-
lish equilibrium, as mentioned in Section  9.2 . Because their wave functions 
cannot overlap signiﬁ cantly, you can argue that we are in a classical regime or 
pseudo - quantum regime; after all we did quantize the energy. 
 What if the particles cannot be distinguished from each other? We deal with 
this situation next, in Section  10.9 . 
 10.9  QUANTUM STATISTICS OF 
INDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES 
 The Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function works well for a system of 
identical particles that can be distinguished from one another, that is, their 
wave functions do not overlap signiﬁ cantly. Molecules in the gas phase can be 
modeled to meet this requirement and therefore the system they form can be 
described by the Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function. So far, this is how 
we have treated the molecules in this chapter. Now, let us consider the situa-
tion when the wave functions of the particles in the system overlap signiﬁ -
cantly so that they cannot be distinguished from each other. 
 
 Note :  The assumption here is that although the particles in the system cannot be 
distinguished from each other, they can still be counted. 

QUANTUM STATISTICS OF INDISTINGUISHABLE PARTICLES  387
 From the standpoint of quantum mechanics, the particles whose wave func-
tions overlap so much that they cannot be distinguished from one another, fall 
into two categories: 
 1.  Fermions.  These are the particles that have odd half - integer spins and 
obey Pauli ’ s exclusion principle. This means that no two fermions can 
occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Electrons with spin  ½ 
are examples of fermions. 
 2.  Bosons.  These are the particles that have zero or integral spins and do 
not obey Pauli ’ s exclusion principle. This means that more than one 
boson can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously. Photons, the 
quanta of light, are an example of bosons.

where  g ( E i ) is the number of available states with energy  E i , and  f ( E i ) is the 
probability that each state of energy  E i will be occupied. The function  f ( E i ) is 
also called the distribution function. The distribution function that we have

function and is given by

where  F  and  B are normalization constants that depend on the physical

that for a given energy, the value for  f BE ( E i ) will be higher than the value for 
 f FD ( E i ). This accounts for the fact that multiple bosons can occupy the same 
energy state. Figure  10.7 presents the comparison of these three distributions 
as functions of energy over the same range shown along the x - axis in terms of 
 κ T . The normalization constants  A ,  B , and  F are set to 1. As the ﬁ gure dem-
onstrates, the three distributions behave the same way at higher energy and a 
higher number of degrees of freedom (represented by   κ T ).

 Table  10.2 compares the three distribution functions with one another. 
From these three distribution functions, note the following three points: 
 1.  Both Fermi – Dirac and Bose – Einstein distributions are signiﬁ cantly dif-
ferent from the Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function. 
 2.  The Fermi – Dirac and Bose – Einstein distributions are very similar; they 
only differ by their normalization constants and by the sign of the number 
1 in the denominator. However, this sign difference gives rise to signiﬁ -
cant differences at certain limits.  
 3.  At very high energies, all three distributions give the same results, that 
is, Fermi – Dirac and Bose – Einstein distributions look like the Maxwell –
 Boltzmann distribution.

 Enrico Fermi (1901 – 1954) 
 Courtesy of the U.S. Department 
of Energy. 
 Enrico Fermi, one of the great physicists of 
the twentieth century, was born on 
September 29, 1901 in Rome, Italy. He 
studied at Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa 
and worked and taught at various institutes 
including the University of Rome, Columbia 
University, and the University of Chicago. 
He did his work on quantum statistics in 
1926 while he was in Rome. He was exiled 
from Italy in 1938. He then went to the 
United States where he led a team in 
Chicago that built the ﬁ rst self - sustaining 
nuclear reactor in 1942. Fermi also worked 
on the atomic bomb project (The Manhattan 
Project) during the Second World War. After 
the war, he became a faculty member at 
University of Chicago, where he worked for 
the rest of his life. 
 Fermi received the Nobel Prize in physics 
in 1938 for his  “ demonstrations of the 
existence of new radioactive elements 
produced by neutron irradiation, and for his 
related discovery of nuclear reactions brought 
about by slow neutrons”. He died on 
November 28, 1954 at the age of 53 in 
Chicago. Fermium, a synthetic element 
created in 1952 at the Fermi National 
Accelerator Lab near Chicago, and a type of 
particles called fermions are named after him.

 Hence, both the Fermi – Dirac and Bose – Einstein distribution functions behave 
like the Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution functions in the limit of high energies. So, 
in this limit, Maxwell – Boltzmann statistics can be used for both fermions and 
bosons. 

PLANCK’S RADIATION FORMULA  391
 
 Satyendra Nath Bose 
(1894 – 1974) 
 Satyendra Nath Bose was born on January 1, 
1894 in Kolkata (Calcutta), India. He studied 
at the Hindu College and Presidency College 
in Kolkata, and taught and worked at the 
University of Calcutta and the University of 
Dhaka (now in Bangladesh). 
 In 1924, Bose derived the quantum 
radiation law, but his paper was rejected by a 
leading British research journal. After failing 
to get it published, he sent the paper to 
Einstein in Germany. Einstein, understanding 
the importance of Bose ’ s work, translated the 
paper into German and sent it for Bose to 
the prestigious German research journal 
 Zeitschrift f ü r Physik, where it was published. 
Because Einstein extended Bose ’ s work to 
apply it to material particles, both names are 
attached to the equation called the Bose –
 Einstein distribution. 
 The recognition that followed this 
publication, allowed Bose to leave India for 
the ﬁ rst time and he spent 2 years in Europe 
working with noted scientists of his time 
including Louis de Broglie, Marie Curie, and 
Albert Einstein. 
 Although he never worked to earn a 
Ph.D., Bose had diverse interests in science 
and studied biology, chemistry, geology, 
zoology, anthropology, and engineering. He 
died on February 4, 1974 in Kolkata, India at 
the age of 80. 
 So, atoms and molecules in the excited state transition to the lower state 
by emitting energy in the form of radiation. We realized in Chapter  2 that 
radiation is a collection of photons. Also, in Section  2.3 we presented Planck ’ s 
radiation formula. Now that we know how to handle a collection of particles, 
let us see if we can derive Planck ’ s radiation formula in the context of what 
we have discussed in this chapter. 
 10.10  PLANCK ’ S RADIATION FORMULA 
 We revisit the problem of black - body radiation discussed in Section  2.3 because 
radiation is just a collection of photons, that is, bosons. If we model the cavity 
as a cube with each edge equal to  a , we can model the photon in the cavity as

 We are doing all this manipulation for one purpose: to calculate the density 
of quantum states. Recall that  n 1 ,  n 2 ,  n 3 are the quantum numbers that quantize 
energy in 3Ds and therefore represent the quantum states. As illustrated in 
Figure  10.8 , The number of states can be represented by the volume of the 
sphere in the number space with radius  r , which is given by

where the factor 2 accounts for the fact that there are two possibilities for the 
photon polarization, and the factor 8 appears in the denominator because we 
are only interested in that part of the sphere that corresponds to the positive 
values of  n 1 ,  n 2 ,  n 3 .

where the normalization constant  B  has been set to 1. This is because the total 
radiant energy in the cavity remains constant even though the number of 
photons that compose that energy may change, as photons are absorbed and 
emitted by the walls of the cavity. From Eqs.  10.59 and  10.60 , we are now able 
to write the distribution for the number of photons carrying energy  E p :

 Note that Eqs.  10.65  and  10.66  are the same as those introduced in Section  2.3 
for Planck ’ s radiation formulas. As shown in Problem 10.16, if we used the 
Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution instead of the Bose – Einstein distribution 
and followed the same procedure, we would have arrived at an energy density 
expression indicating that the energy density keeps increasing and approach-
ing inﬁ nity as the wavelength keeps decreasing. Hence the frequency keeps 
increasing, which is consistent with the classical result from Section  2.3.1 called 
the classical catastrophe. 
 The quantum mechanical understanding of radiation emission by atoms and 
molecules led to the invention of lasers. 
 10.11  ABSORPTION, EMISSION, AND LASERS 
 The term laser is an acronym for  light ampliﬁ cation by stimulated emission of 
radiation. A laser is a device that produces a nearly monochromatic and coher-
ent beam of light (radiation). Monochromatic means that the light beam has 
a single frequency or a very narrow range of frequencies or wavelengths. A 

ABSORPTION, EMISSION, AND LASERS  395
coherent beam means that the waves in the beam are in phase with each other 
or have a constant phase difference over time. The laser phenomenon was 
discovered with the help of quantum physics and obviously can be explained 
with quantum mechanics. 
 In Chapters  2 and  9 , we explored how atoms and molecules in excited states 
can transition into a lower energy state by emitting radiation, that is, photons. 
How do these atoms and molecules transition into excited states? The answer 
is, of course: By absorbing photons. As shown in Figure  10.9 , there are three 
ways in which these transitions between a lower energy level  E 0 and higher 
energy level  E 1 can occur: 
 1.  A molecule (or atom) in the energy state  E 0 transitions to the state  E 1 
by absorbing a photon of energy  hf  =  E 1  −  E 0 . This process is called 
stimulated absorption. 
 2.  If the molecule (or atom) is initially in the energy state  E 1 , it can transi-
tion to  E 0 by emitting a photon of energy  hf  =  E 1  −  E 0 . This process is 
called spontaneous emission. 
 3.  A photon of energy  hf incident on the molecule (or atom) in state  E 1 
stimulates the transition of the molecule (or atom) to the state  E 0 . This 
process is called stimulated emission, as opposed to spontaneous emis-
sion, which does not involve any external help. 
 The process of stimulated emission was ﬁ rst suggested by Einstein in 1917. 
Einstein argued that the probability for the stimulated emission is the same 
as that of the stimulated absorption. In other words, the likelihood that a 
photon of energy  hf incident on a molecule in state  E 0 will be absorbed is the 
same as the likelihood that this photon will cause the emission of another 
photon if it was incident on the molecule in state  E 1 . 
 In the case of stimulated emission, the emitted photon is in phase with the 
incident photon. The key idea behind the laser is to stimulate emission before 
spontaneous emission occurs. This is facilitated by the fact that many mole-
cules (or atoms) consist of excited states whose lifetime is larger than usual. 
Such states are called  metastable (almost stable) states. As an example of a 
 Figure 10.9.   Three ways of transitioning between two energy levels in an atom or a 
molecule. 

396  
STATISTICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS
simple laser, consider a system of molecules (or atoms) with the following 
three characteristics: 
 1.  The molecules have a metastable state at energy  hf greater than the 
energy of the ground state. 
 2.  The molecules also have a higher excited state from which they can 
transition into the metastable state. 
 3.   There are more molecules in the metastable state than in the ground 
state. 
 If light with frequency  f is incident on this system, there will obviously be 
more stimulated photon emission from molecules in the metastable state than 
the stimulated absorption of photons by molecules in the ground state because 
there are more molecules in the metastable state than in the ground state. All 
the photons emitted through stimulated emission are in phase with the inci-
dent photons and have the same frequency as that of the incident photons. 
Therefore this results in the ampliﬁ cation of the original light in the form of 
a coherent and monochromatic light beam. This is the basic concept behind 
the operation of a laser. 
 A laser is one of those inventions that are used in the ﬁ eld of applications, 
as well as in the ﬁ eld of research as tools. It is not rare that sometimes the 
theoretical predictions, the necessary characteristic of a scientiﬁ c theory, are 
so ahead of their times that they have to wait for the development of the right 
technology before they can be tested. Such was the case with one prediction 
of quantum theory called the Bose – Einstein condensation. 
 10.12  BOSE – EINSTEIN CONDENSATION 
 You already know three states (or phases) of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. 
Bose – Einstein condensation refers to the process that gives rise to a new 
state of matter called the Bose – Einstein condensate. This state was predicted 
by Bose and Einstein based on their quantum mechanical description of 
particles with integral spins, the Bose – Einstein statistics described earlier in 
this chapter. 
 Here is the account of the prediction. Consider a gaseous system of particles 
with each particle having an integer spin. Due to the integer spin of the par-
ticles, this system will obey Bose – Einstein statistics discussed earlier in this 
chapter. Because the system is in the gaseous sate, the volume of the container 
is large compared to the size of each particle. The quantum mechanics wave 
packet (or de Broglie wave) associated with each particle is so small in size 
compared to the spacing among the particles that the particles can move 
around fairly independently and be physically distinguished from each other. 
This is one extreme where wave packets are not so important, so let us move 

BOSE–EINSTEIN CONDENSATION  397
to the other extreme by cooling the gas. As shown in Study Checkpoint 10.7, 
as a particle is cooled, the size of its wave packet increases. You can arrive at 
the same result by using this form of the uncertainty principle:
 Δ
Δ
x
p
.
≥ℏ
2  
 As the particles are cooling and their wave packets are growing, throw in 
the fact that the Bose – Einstein particles do not obey Pauli ’ s exclusion prin-
ciple, that is, multiple particles can occupy the same quantum state. This has a 
very profound implication for our cooling of the Bose – Einstein system of 
particles. As the particles get cold enough, their individual wave packets get 
larger than the spacing among the particles and therefore overlap. Eventually, 
at minimum temperature ( T  =  0  K), all the overlapping wave packets will 
merge into one wave packet because all the atoms will occupy the same 
quantum mechanical state (the lowest possible energy or ground state) and 
therefore all the atoms will come to a halt and act as one particle, called a 
superparticle or superatom if the gas is made of atoms. This state (or phase) 
of matter is called the Bose – Einstein condensate. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 10.7 
 Prove that according to quantum mechanics the wave packet size increases with the 
cooling of a particle. 
 Solution: 
 The wavelength of a particle is given by
 λ = h
p  
 When the particle is cooled, the momentum  p decreases, and therefore the wave-
length increases. This is equivalent to saying that the wave packet size increases. 
 These Bose – Einstein condensates predicted in 1924 – 1925 by Bose and 
Einstein were experimentally observed 70 years later in 1995 and were reported 
on July 14, 1995, in an issue of Science magazine by a group led by Eric Cornell 
and Carl Wieman. These researchers were working at the University of 
Colorado at Boulder NIST - JILA lab. They used the rubidium ( 87 Rb) gas atoms, 
which they cooled by using lasers and a magnetic ﬁ eld. Lasers were used to 
hit the atoms precisely from the opposite direction with photons to slow them 
down. In this ﬁ rst phase, the atoms were cooled down to  ∼ 1  mK. In the second 

398  
STATISTICAL QUANTUM MECHANICS
cooling phase, the already slowed atoms were trapped in a magnetic ﬁ eld and 
were cooled to  ∼ 20  nK: extremely close to 0  K. At  ∼ 170  nK, the researchers 
observed the transition of the atoms from a gas with a normal broad velocity 
distribution to a very narrow velocity distribution, indicating that all atoms 
had about the same velocity. As shown in Figure  10.10 , the fraction of 
atoms in the Bose – Einstein condensate state increased as the temperature 
decreased. 
 Figure  10.10 is a 3D illustration of the gradual formation of the Bose –
 Einstein condensate as the temperature decreases. The two horizontal axes 
represent the velocity components and the vertical axis represents the number 
of atoms corresponding to those velocities. Three frames in this picture cor-
respond to temperatures of  ∼ 200, 100, and 20  nK (from the bottom left to the 
top right). The higher and narrower peak growing at the center of these graphs 
represent the growing number of atoms getting into the singular quantum 
mechanical state with zero velocity. 
 These observations of the Bose – Einstein condensates were conﬁ rmed by 
other researchers including Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT, who shared the 2001 
Nobel Prize in physics with Cornell and Wieman for their achievements on 
Bose – Einstein condensation. Since then, researchers have been exploring the 
applications of the Bose – Einstein condensates, one of which is creating a

 Einstein condensate as the temperature decreases. The two horizontal axes represent

 10.13  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 As mentioned earlier, the laser phenomenon was discovered with the help of 
quantum physics and obviously can be explained with quantum mechanics. In 
addition to their wide range of applications in science, lasers have a wide 
spectrum of uses in several other areas including surgery, welding and metal 
cutting, sound and video recording, and reproduction. One obvious scientiﬁ c 
application of lasers is the precise determination of locations and precise 
measurements of distances by making use of the coherent and nondivergent 
nature of the laser beam. 
 Over the years, lasers have been used increasingly in medicine. Due to their 
better precision and ability to focus energy into a small spot than by conven-
tional means, they are used in surgery to make precise incisions in different 
types of tissues. The use of a laser in surgery also reduces bleeding because 
the laser helps the blood coagulate during cutting. These days, lasers are fre-
quently used in a number of eye operations, and are helping many preventing 
blindness. For example, Figure  10.11  presents the Fundus photo showing a 
scatter laser surgery for diabetic retinopathy. The fundus of the eye is the 
interior surface of the eye, opposite the lens, and includes the retina and optic 
disc. 
 The CD and DVD recording and reproduction are another common appli-
cation of lasers. For example, laser light is directed toward the tracks (on CD 
or DVD) that contain the recorded (encoded) information. The light reﬂ ected 
from the tracks contains this information, which is then turned into electrical 
signals, which subsequently produce the output.

 The huge scope of laser applications can be realized from the long list of 
laser types, which includes chemical, dye, free - electron, gas, metal – vapor, pho-
tonic crystal, and semiconductor lasers. In a nutshell, lasers, a gift from quantum 
mechanics, have enormous uses in our daily lives that range from a laser 
pointer to preventing blindness. 
 10.14  SUMMARY 
 A molecule has a deﬁ nite energy at a given time, which includes electronic, 
rotational, vibrational, and translational energy. However, all the molecules in 
an assembly or collection of molecules do not have the same value of energy (or 
of other physical quantity, e.g., velocity) at a given time. Instead, the different 
values of energy of a collection of molecules are statistically distributed over 
molecules. The core issue is how to determine this distribution, in general, the 
fraction of molecules in each state, or the population probability distribution. 
 To describe a system of identical particles, the general formula to determine 
the number of particles with energy  E i is
 n E
g E
f E
i
i
i
(
) =
(

where  n ( E i ) is the number of particles with energy  E i ,  g ( E i ) is the number of 
available states of energy  E i , and  f ( E i ) is the probability that each state of 
energy  E i will be occupied. The function  f ( E i ) is also called the distribution 
function. The Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function used for describing a 
system of identical, but distinguishable, particles is given by
 f

where  A is the proportionality constant. We can use this function with  g ( E i ) 
determined by the availability of quantum mechanical states to describe the 
system of identical particles that can be distinguished from one another. 
 We can use the Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function to treat the 
system of particles in quantum mechanics as well. For a system with many 
quantum states, the fraction of molecules occupying a speciﬁ c state (the popu-
lation probability) is

SUMMARY  401
 Because the expressions for  E i is different for each of three kinds of motion 
(vibrational, rotational, and translational), the speciﬁ c expressions for  Z and 
 P i are also different. For each of these three kinds of motion, you learned the 
following three important lessons: 
 1.  At low temperature, most of the molecules are in their ground states, 
that is, minimum energy states. 
 2.  As the temperature increases, more and more molecules transition to the 
excited states, that is, states with higher energies. 
 3.  At high enough temperature, a large number of quantum states are 
occupied by the molecules and the quantum mechanical results begin to 
agree with the classical mechanics results. This is an expression for the 
correspondence principle. 
 The Maxwell – Boltzmann distribution function does not distinguish between 
odd half - integer spin and integer spin. A system of particles with odd half -
 integer spins, called fermions, is described by the Fermi – Dirac distribution 
function:
 f

 A system of particles with zero or integer spins called bosons is described 
by the Bose – Einstein distribution function:
 f

 The difference between the distribution functions for fermions and bosons 
stem from the fact that fermions obey the exclusion principle and bosons do 
not. Because a photon is a boson, the Bose – Einstein statistics can be used to 
derive Planck ’ s radiation formula for black - body radiation:

 The quantum mechanical understanding of radiation emission by atoms and 
molecules led to the invention of lasers, which already have enormous applica-
tions in a multitude of areas including health, welding and metal cutting, sound 
and video, and recording and reproduction.

 Problem 10.7  Cells are the fundamental building blocks of all forms of life. 
Biologists believe that the ﬁ rst cells on planet Earth evolved during the time

QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 Quantum mechanics is the common thread linking many ﬁ elds of science in the 
microworld into one ﬁ eld called nanoscience on which nanotechnology is based. 
This thread runs not only through different scientiﬁ c disciplines in the microscale, but 
also runs through the whole scale from microscale (including nano) through mac-
roscale. As we emphasized through the correspondence principle throughout this book, 
classical mechanics is just an approximation of quantum mechanics in the limit of large 
quantum numbers. In other words, classical mechanics is the quantum mechanics of 
macrosystems. In this chapter, we will explore this thread along different disciplines 
of science.

 11.1  INTRODUCTION 
 Because the macroworld we live in is made of building blocks from the micro-
world, nature does its most fundamental design work at the microlevel. 
Therefore, the everyday reality that we experience in the macroworld has its 
roots in the microworld. Quantum mechanics, being the underlying science of 
the microworld, is the common thread running through all scientiﬁ c disciplines 
dealing with matter including biology, chemistry, computing, material science, 
and through the junction of it all nanoscience and nanotechnology. As is 
evident from the material covered in this book, outside of physics, chemists 
were the ﬁ rst to realize the importance of quantum mechanics. In fact, the 
areas of physical chemistry and atomic physics are often intertwined with each 
other. This is because chemistry for more than a century has been based on 
atoms and molecules, as opposed to biology, where molecular biology is still 
a relatively new ﬁ eld. Following chemists, the electrical engineers soon realized 
the power of quantum mechanics and solid - state electronic technology rapidly 
developed. The term electronic itself should give you a clue that electrical 
engineers were playing around with ways of managing electrons to produce 

NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY  407
useful technology. However, the time has come when all scientiﬁ c disciplines 
involving matter, living or nonliving, cannot escape the uses of quantum 
mechanics. This is today ’ s message and the messenger is nanotechnology, the 
application of science at the nanoscale. After their independent development, 
all the major scientiﬁ c disciplines are meeting at the nanoscale juncture where 
the behavior of matter is governed by quantum mechanics. Therefore, quantum 
mechanics is gaining traction in all different ﬁ elds ranging from computer 
science to biology. 
 In this chapter, we brieﬂ y explore the relevance, need, and importance of 
quantum mechanics in nanotechnology, computer science, and biology. 
 11.2  NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY 
 The history of science is a journey of the development of our understanding, 
starting from the macroworld and making our way to the micro -  and nano-
world. Science at the scale of nanometers is called nanoscience, and its applica-
tion is called nanotechnology. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the natural 
progression (or evolution) of science and technology. It is the junction where 
several different disciplines of science intersect one another as they were 
destined to. The unifying theme of nanotechnology is the control of matter at 
the level of building blocks, such as molecules and atoms, normally on the scale 
of 1 – 100  nm, and the fabrication of devices with critical dimensions that lie 
within this size range. Of course, the control on the nanoscale level can also 
be used to build large structures and systems more effectively and with better 
features from bottom up. This implies nanoscience and nanotechnology will 
have a global impact of unparallel proportions on our world by inﬂ uencing 
almost all existing ﬁ elds in science and technology and by opening new doors 
to knowledge and opportunities. So, if nanotechnology comes from nanosci-
ence, where does nanoscience come from? 
 11.2.1  Sciences behind Nanoscience 
 Nanoscience is the study of matter and material systems at the nanoscale level, 
that is, at least one dimension of the system under study is in the range of 
 ∼ 1 – 100  nm. All branches of science have developed at a different pace. Some 
of them, such as physics, ran into the nanoscale level much earlier than others. 
Nevertheless, nanoscience is emerging from the studies of different sciences 
on the nanoscale level. Let us not lose sight of the fact that the discipline of 
science that studies the fundamental building blocks of matter and the interac-
tions between them is called physics. Because all things, living and nonliving, 
are formed of matter, basic physical laws should be at the bottom of any 
natural phenomenon in any discipline of science. So, undoubtedly, physics is 
the basis of all sciences and engineering. It should not come as a surprise that 
the idea of nanotechnology ﬁ rst came from a physicist, Richard Feynman, 

408  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
when on December 29, 1959, he gave a talk at the meeting of American 
Physical Society at California Institute of Technology titled:  There Is Plenty of 
Room at the Bottom. This event is now considered as the beginning of 
nanotechnology. 
 The relationships between physics, some other sciences behind nanoscience, 
and nanoscience itself are illustrated in Figure  11.1 . 
 The three common underlying characteristics that unify some aspects of the 
different sciences into nanoscience are the following: 
 1.  They all follow the scientiﬁ c method. 
 2.  Studies in the different sciences that are encompassed by nanoscience 
are all on the nanoscale level. 
  3.     Here is how quantum mechanics comes into the picture: Generally 
speaking, the laws of quantum physics apply to all these studies in dif-
ferent sciences.

 Richard Feynman (1918 – 1988) 
Courtesy of AIP 
 Richard Phillips Feynman, one of the 
outstanding theoretical physicists and great 
minds of twentieth century, was born on May 
11, 1918 in Far Rockaway, a suburb of New 
York City. He studied at Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and Princeton 
University, and worked at Cornell University 
and California Institute of Technology. After 
receiving his Ph.D. in physics, Feynman 
worked at the Manhattan Project to develop 
atomic bomb during the Second World War. 
 Feynman made signiﬁ cant contributions to 
theoretical particle physics, especially to 
quantum electrodynamics (QED), the 
quantum version of the electromagnetic 
(EM) theory, that describes the interaction 
between two charged particles, such as 
electrons and protons. He shared the 1965 
Nobel Prize in physics with Julian Schwinger 
and Sin - ItiroTomonaga for his work in QED. 
This work had profound consequences for 
particle physics. 
 His lectures and books, such as  The 
Character of Physical Law , has helped 
greatly to popularize physics and has also 
worked as a great source to learn about how 
physics thinking is done. His  Lectures on 
Physics , in three volumes, has contributed 
greatly to physics teaching since their 
publication in 1963. Feynman was noted not 
only for his grasp of multiple subﬁ elds of 
physics, but also for his vision of the 
application of physics outside the discipline 
of physics. He is known to introduce the 
concept of nanotechnology. 
 Feynman developed two rare forms of 
cancer, Liposarcoma and Waldenstr ö m 
macroglobulinemia. He died in 1988 shortly 
after a ﬁ nal attempt at surgery for 
Liposarcoma. Feynman ’ s last recorded words 
are noted as: 
 “ I ’ d hate to die twice. It ’ s so boring. ” 
 Already popular in research labs, electron microscopes and atomic force 
microscopes, already discussed in this book, themselves are an example of the 
use of quantum mechanics in nanotechnology. These microscopes are helping 
us to see nanostructures.

 11.2.2  You Need to See Them before You Could Control Them 
 In order to control anything on the nanoscale level, you must ﬁ rst be able to 
 “ see ” them. However, as shown in Problem  11.1 , the smallest objects you can 
see with even the most powerful light microscope are  ∼ 200  nm in size. In other 
words, optical microscopes using the visible light are not powerful enough to 
help you see the nanostructures, such as molecules. The reason is simple: 
wavelengths at the frequency of visible light are too large to resolve nanoscale 
structures. 
 PROBLEM 11.1 
 Estimate the smallest size of an object that you can see separately from its sur-
rounding by using the most powerful optical microscope?  
 Solution: 
 The wavelength of visible (white) light puts the lowest limit on the size of the object 
you can see even with the use of an optical microscope. Visible light that we use to 
see things with naked eyes has a wavelength in the range of 380 – 750  nm, that is, the 
smallest wavelength of visible light is 380  nm. Therefore, the minimum size of two 
small objects that you can distinguish from each other is equal to 380/2  =  190  nm, 
that is,  ∼ 200  nm. 
 STUDY CHECKPOINTS 11.1 
 Explain how electron microscopes and atomic force microscopes, introduced in 
Section  3.8 , themselves are an example of the use of quantum mechanics in 
nanotechnology. 
 Solution: 
 These microscopes generally use the quantum mechanical principles, such as wave 
particle duality and quantum tunneling, for their functioning. 
 Therefore, to observe nanostructures, you need to use electron micro-
scopes, which use a beam of higher energy particles, such as electrons, instead 
of a beam of visible light photons, to generate an image of the target speci-
men. Electron microscopes are based on the wave – particle duality of elec-
trons. From the quantum physics discussed so far, you have learned that an 
electron can behave like a wave with wavelength given by the following 
formula:

 As demonstrated in Problem 11.5, the wavelength of an electron going through 
the electric potential  V is given by

 Compare this wavelength of 0.005 – 200  nm to that of photons, the maximum 
theoretical resolution of an optical microscope, and you will realize that elec-
trons can probe much deeper and with greater resolution into the structure of 
matter. However, as Problem 11.6 suggests, the electrons speed is getting closer 
to the speed of light, so the relativistic quantum mechanical effects will begin 
to become signiﬁ cant. There are various types of electron microscopes: Those 
in which electrons pass through a material, and those in which electrons do 
not penetrate the material, but rather scatter off the surface. For example, a 
transmission electron microscope (TEM) is an electron microscope that uses 
the transmission of electrons through the target material to take the image of 
the target specimen. There are several ways an electron beam can be used to 
generate these images, which give rise to different kinds of electron micro-
scopes. The basic idea is that the electrons transmitting through the specimen 
will be scattered by the constituent particles of the specimen, and the scatter-
ing will expose the internal pattern (or nanostructure) of the specimen, which 
will be captured in an image. The imaging process used in a TEM is described 
in the following: 
 1.  A source, such as an electron gun, generates a beam of electrons. 
 2.  By using an EM ﬁ eld, the electron beam is accelerated and focused to 
the target specimen. 
 3.  The incident electrons are scattered by the internal structure of the speci-
men as they transmit through the specimen. 
 4.  The scattered electrons, after they transmit through the specimen, are 
focused by objective lens and ampliﬁ ed by magnifying lens to generate 
an enlarged image of the specimen ’ s structure. 
 5.   The electrons strike a phosphor screen, which generates light. This light 
in turn enables a user to see the image. 

412  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 As an example, Figure  11.2 presents an image of bacterial cells of 
 S. aureus , a spherical bacterium, which is one of the causal agents of mastitis, 
inﬂ ammation of breast tissue in dairy cows, captured by a TEM. Its 
large capsule protects the organism from attack by the cow ’ s immunological 
defenses.  
 The images generated by the microscope can be used to study the 
structure of the specimen. For example, the darker area of the image 
represents a thicker (denser) part of the specimen that did not allow many 
electrons to pass through it. In contrast, a lighter area represents a thinner 
(or less dense) part of the specimen that allowed many electrons to pass 
through it.

NANOSCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY  413
 As mentioned earlier, to understand the resolving power of an electron 
microscope, you need to recall that electrons can behave like both particles 
and waves, due to the wave – particle duality discussed in Chapter  3 . Also from 
Chapter  3 , you know that the wavelength,   λ , of an electron moving with energy 
 E is given by the following equation:
 
 λ =
=
h
p
h
mE

 (11.3) 
 Note that the wavelength of an electron in the electron beam is inversely 
proportional to its energy, which means the higher the energy, the lower is the 
wavelength, and hence the higher is the resolving power of the microscope. To 
obtain the desired energy,  E , of the incident electron beam in the TEM, the 
accelerating voltage can be adjusted in the range of 100  kV – 1  MV, where  V is 
voltage in units of volts (V). The relationship between  V  and  E is given by the 
following equation:
 
 E = eV  
 (11.4) 
where  e is the electron charge. 
 It turns out that the resolution of the TEM is given by
 
 R

 (11.5) 
where  A is a constant that depends on the operating conditions and  C s is the 
spherical aberration coefﬁ cient of the microscope objective lens. The constant 
 A generally varies between 0.43 and 0.70 and  C s can be in the millions. For an 
example, see Problem  11.2 . 
 STUDY CHECKPOINT 11.2 
 By using an electron microscope called a scanning electron microscope (SEM), 
you have scanned the outer layer of the surface of a molecule. Can you recon-
struct the three - dimensional (3D) image of the molecule by analyzing the scan-
ning data? 
 Solution: 
 The answer is no, because scanning just one layer on the surface gives only 
two - dimensional (2D) information. However, inner layers can be scanned with 
SEM by using a technique called etching. This way, SEM is able to generate a 3D 
image. 

414  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 Because the electrons in the TEM penetrate the specimen, there is enough 
information to generate 3D images. A practical limit on the resolution of a 
TEM is imposed by the maximum energy of the electron beam that can be 
transmitted through a material without damaging the material. Taking this 
limit into account, the typical resolution of a TEM turns out to be 0.1 – 0.2  nm, 
a typical separation between two atoms in a solid material. This means a typical 
TEM can see an object that is 1000 times smaller than the smallest object an 
optical microscope can see and 500,000 smaller than the smallest object a 
naked human eye can see: a wonder of understanding and using quantum 
mechanics. 
 Electron microscopes can be used to determine the following properties of 
the target material: 
  •   Properties, such as conductivity, strength, and melting point. 
  •   Size and shape. 
  •   Structure: arrangement of atoms and molecules. 
  •   Texture and pattern.

 The incident electron beam in a TEM has been accelerated by applying a voltage 
of 200  kV. What is the resolution of the TEM? Assume that  A  =  0.50 and

NANOSCALE QUANTUM CONFINEMENT OF MATTER  415
 Electron transmission spectroscopy uses the transmission of electrons through 
the material. There are techniques that use electrons to scan the surface of 
the material rather than transmitting the electrons through it. These tech-
niques are called scanning microscopy. Electron microscopes use quantum 
mechanical effects, such as wave – particle duality and quantum tunneling. 
Another aspect of quantum mechanics at work in nanotechnology is quantum 
conﬁ nement. 
 11.3  NANOSCALE QUANTUM CONFINEMENT OF MATTER 
 You have learned about quantum conﬁ nement in this book. An electron in an 
atom is an example of a conﬁ ned particle. The discrete piece of matter con-
ﬁ ned to the nanoscale level is called a nanoparticle or a nanostructure. 
Furthermore, these structures can also be used to conﬁ ne other particles. A 
nanostructure is a structure that has at least one of the three spatial dimen-
sions on the nanoscale (1 – 100  nm). There are already a wide spectrum of 
nanostructures under study and used in the ﬁ eld of nanotechnology. Obviously, 
the behavior of these structures is governed by quantum mechanics under 
most conditions. In this section, we give bird ’ s eye view of a small subset of 
these structures, such as buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, nanocrystals, and 
quantum dots. 
 11.3.1  Buckyballs 
 A buckyball is a molecule composed of 60 carbon atoms (C 60 ) in the form of 
a hollow sphere  ∼ 1  nm in diameter. Buckyballs are an example of fullerenes, 
which are a type of carbon that consists of C 60 and related molecules, a third 
form of solid carbon in addition to diamond and graphite. As illustrated in 
Figure  11.3 , each carbon atom in a buckyball is bonded to three neighboring 
carbon atoms. The soccerball shaped buckyball molecule consists of 20 six -
 membered (hexagonal) rings and 12 ﬁ ve - membered carbon atom rings. These 
ball - like molecules bind with each other in the material (solid state) to form 
a crystal lattice with the centers of two adjacent molecules  ∼ 1  nm apart. These 
molecules are held together by a weak intermolecular force called the van der 
Walls force, a type of EM force. 
 The following characteristics of a buckyball make it attractive for nanotech-
nology applications: 
 1.  Each carbon atom in a buckyball has an unused valence electron because 
it uses only three out of four available valence electrons to bond to the 
three neighboring carbon atoms.  
 2.  Buckyballs are very strong and hard. 
 3.  Their structure is large, they yet are small in size:  ∼ 1  nm in diameter. 

416  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 4.  Each buckyball has lots of empty space inside it that leaves room to trap 
other atoms to make useful molecules or simply to transport other 
molecules. 
 Because of these characteristics, several uses of buckyballs in nanotechnology 
are being explored including the following: 
  •   A possible use in making armor due to their strength and hardness. 
  •   Potential medical uses due to their small size and ability to trap other 
atoms include the following: 
  •   Use buckyballs as antioxidants to neutralize a free radical in the 
human body. A free electron from the buckyball makes a bond with the 
unpaired electron from the free radical, which can prevent certain 
diseases. 
  •   Bind certain antibiotics to buckyballs (making use of the space 
inside the ball), and target undesired cells in the body, such as cancer 
cells. 
  •   Use buckyballs to deliver drugs directly to the infected part of the 
body. 
  •   If you dope metal atoms inside a buckyball, the buckyball can be used for 
medical imaging. 
  •   Buckyballs can also be used to facilitate superconductivity, which is a state 
of matter in which the resistance to the electric current becomes zero. 
Due to the unused valence electrons inside the atoms of the molecule,

Str ö ck. 

NANOSCALE QUANTUM CONFINEMENT OF MATTER  417
 A buckyball is certainly a quantum mechanical object and to take full advan-
tage of it we should learn to handle it at the quantum level. For example, a 
group of experimental physicists, Arndt et al. at the University of Vienna has 
already conﬁ rmed the wave – particle duality of buckyballs,  C 60 . The wave 
nature of buckyball molecules was conﬁ rmed by observing the de Broglie 
wave interference of these molecules by diffraction at a material absorption 
grating. A material absorption grating is a platform that facilitates absorption 
and diffraction of material entitles, such as molecules and atoms. The observa-
tion of wave behavior in this relatively massive and complex object, with an 
atomic mass of 720  amu and a diameter of  ∼ 1  nm, is very signiﬁ cant. The de 
Broglie wavelength was found to be 2.5  pm. As Problem 11.10 shows, this cor-
responds to the buckyball speed of  ∼ 200  m/s, which is much less than the speed 
of light and hence nonrelativistic quantum mechanics considered in this book 
is justiﬁ able for such structures. 
 Due to its many excited internal degrees of freedom and their possible 
couplings to their surrounding environment that would result in decoherence, 
a buckyball was considered by many to be an almost a classical object. This 
should ring the warning bell for molecular biologists, because it indicates that 
many biological molecules and their reactions, most likely also have quantum 
mechanical effects. 
 Buckyballs (C 60 ) are only one of several fullerenes that have been discov-
ered, such as C 70 , C 80 , and C 84 . These structures were named after Richard 
Buckminster Fuller, an American architect, author, designer, inventor, poet, 
and visionary, who designed the geodesic dome that resembles the structure 
of C 60 , also called buckminsterfullerene, the ﬁ rst fullerene discovered by 
Robert Curl, Harold Kroto, and Richard Smalley. Generally speaking, a fuller-
ene is any molecule composed entirely of carbon, in the form of a hollow 
sphere, ellipsoid, or tube. Also note that in both buckyballs and graphite, 
a carbon atom bonds with three neighboring carbon atoms. The same is true 
for what is called a carbon nanotube, or simply a nanotube. So, conceptually 
you wrap a graphite sheet into different shapes to make buckyballs and 
nanotubes. 
 Note :  A free radical, discussed in the Chapter  7 opening section, is a molecule that 
has an unpaired electron, which makes this molecule very reactive. An antioxidant 
molecule can supply an electron to neutralize a free radical molecule. A certain 
level of free radicals are necessary for life because they play an important role in 
some necessary biological processes. However, a balance of antioxidants and free 
radicals is also necessary. This balance is disturbed by age, which results in a high 
level of free radicals in your body that may cause certain diseases. 
buckyballs offer some conductivity, which can be increased by adding 
metallic atoms to the buckyball.

 Richard Smalley, a physicist, chemist, and a 
nanotechnologist, was born on June 6, 1943 
in Akron, Ohio. He attended Hope College 
in Holland Michigan before transferring to 
the University of Michigan, where he 
received his B.S. in chemistry in 1965. 
Between his studies, Smalley worked in 
industry as a research chemist with Shell, 
which helped develop his unique 
professionalism, managerial style, and 
practical intellectualism. He received his 
Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1973 from Princeton 
University. After postdoctoral work at the 
University of Chicago, Smalley began his 
teaching career at Rice University, Houston, 
Texas, in 1976. Here he became a professor 
of chemistry in 1982 and also a professor of 
physics in 1990. He was one of the founders 
of the Rice Quantum Institute in 1979, 
and served as the Chairman of this 
interdisciplinary Institute from 1986 to 1996. 
 In 1985, while investigating the 
constituents of astronomic dark matter 
(undetected matter that is believed to exist), 
Smalley, Curl, Kroto, and their students 
discovered the buckyball molecule (C 60 ), for 
which they were awarded the 1996 Nobel 
Prize in chemistry. After the discovery of the 
buckyball, Smalley ’ s research focus turned to 
carbon nanotubes. 
 In the later years of his career, Smalley 
became very passionate about the 
importance of clean energy and education, 
believing that many of humanity ’ s other 
pressing problems, such as poverty and 
shortage of food supply, would be much 
easier to solve by making affordable, clean 
energy available to all. In addition to 
researching paths to abundant, clean energy, 
Smalley also devoted time to educating 
politicians and other world leaders on the 
need for and a solution to the energy 
problem. 
 On October 28, 2005, Smalley lost a 
6 - year battle with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia, and died at a rather young age 
of 62.

 11.3.2  Carbon Nanotubes 
 A carbon nanotube is a one - atom thick sheet of graphite with a seamless 
cylindrical shape having a diameter on the order of 1  nm. Imagine you are a 
nanobeing living in the nanoworld. You pick up a graphite sheet in your hands 
and roll it up into a cylindrical shape. Congratulations! You have a nanotube. 
However, making nanotubes in the macroworld that we live in is not that 
trivial, as you will see later on in this section. To appreciate the uses of nano-
tubes, you need to understand their structure and strength. 
 Nanotubes are essentially one - dimensional (ID) structures with a length/
diameter ratio exceeding 10,000. A nanotube that can be conceptually viewed 
as one graphite layer rolled into a cylindrical shape is called a single - walled 
carbon nanotube (SWCNT). A multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) can 
conceptually be viewed as a coaxial assembly of cylinders of SWCNTs, 
one within the other. The separation between two neighboring tubes in a 
MWCNT is about the same as that between two neighboring layers in 
a natural graphite, that is,  ∼ 0.34  nm. As shown in Figure  11.4 , the interior of 
a carbon nanotube is hollow, but can be loaded with a wide variety of 
molecules. 
 The strength of a material is its ability to withstand pressure or stress. 
Carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest material known. They 
are about 20 times stronger than steel. Due to their amazing properties, 
such as their extraordinarily large strength and unique dimensionality and

conductivity, carbon nanotubes have enormous uses such as building bigger 
structures by using carbon nanotubes as building blocks. Some examples of 
these structures that can be built from nanotubes are computer chips, ﬁ bers, 
and machines, such as nanoelectromechanical systems and control tools. 
 The strength and ﬂ exibility offered by carbon nanotubes makes them 
potential tools for controlling other nanoscale structures. This means they will 
have a signiﬁ cant role to play in nanotechnology engineering. 
 So, nanotubes are, like buckyballs, carbon - based nanostructures. Another 
class of nanostructures that is of much interest is based on crystals, which are 
called nanocrystals. 
 11.3.3  Nanocrystals 
 A nanocrystal is a crystalline material with dimensions on the order of 10  nm. 
In other words, it is a nanoparticle with a crystalline structure. Nanocrystals 
are typically larger than molecules and smaller than bulk matter. Nanotechnology 
allows scientists to control the size and structure of nanocrystals, and therefore 
manipulate them in the following ways: 
  •   Tune how a nanocrystal conducts charge. 
  •   Change properties, such as their melting point. 
  •   Tune how a nanocrystal displays (decipher) its crystalline structure. 
 
 Note :  A crystal is a solid in which the constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are 
packed in a regularly ordered and repeating pattern that extends in all three spatial 
dimensions. A crystal typically is a large structure on a macroscale level; An example 
of a crystal is a diamond. A not so romantic example is sodium chloride, NaCl (table 
salt), shown in Figure  11.5 . 
 The uses of nanocrystals include the following: 
  •   A nanocrystal can be studied to get information about the corresponding 
bulk (macro) material without having to deal with the grain boundaries 
and defects in the bulk material. A grain boundary is an interface between 
two grains in a crystalline material 
  •   Nanocrystals made with minerals, such as zeolite, have many industrial 
application, for example, they can be used at oil reﬁ neries as ﬁ lters to turn 
crude oil into diesel fuel. 
  •   A layer of nanocrystals can be used to compose solar panels. Such solar 
panels have been found to be cheaper, more ﬂ exible, and more efﬁ cient 
than a large crystalline structure or a pure amorphous (noncrystalline) 
structure. 
 

NANOSCALE QUANTUM CONFINEMENT OF MATTER  421
 Nanocrystals with sizes  ≤ 10  nm are also called quantum dots. The term quantum 
is there to remind us that we are in the realm of quantum physics. 
 11.3.4  Quantum Dots 
 A quantum dot, also called a qdot or a nanodot, is a semiconductor nanocrys-
tal that is  ≤ 10  nm in size, and conﬁ nes the motion of conduction band elec-
trons in the three spatial directions. So, by deﬁ nition, quantum dots are 
able to trap electrons. A given quantum dot contains a ﬁ nite number of 
conduction band electrons typically in the range of 1 – 100. The energy levels 
of these electrons can be explained by using quantum physics, hence the 
name quantum dots.

bors, with an octahedral geometry. Courtesy of Bergamini Mills. 
 Note :  A grain, also called a crystallite, is a domain of the bulk material that has the 
same structure as a single crystal composing the material. A grain boundary is an 
interface where two grains of possibly different orientations meet. 
 Note :  A conduction band in a material is the range of energy in which an electron 
is free to conduct electricity through the material under the inﬂ uence of an applied 
electric potential. 

422  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 Just like an atom, a quantum dot binds some electrons in discrete energy levels, 
that is, it has a discrete energy spectrum. However, unlike an atom, the energy 
spectrum of a quantum dot can be engineered by controlling the geometrical 
size and shape of the nanodot, and therefore the strength of the electron con-
ﬁ nement potential. This enables us to tune the properties of the quantum dot 
material. For example, the color of the material is directly related to the energy 
levels of the quantum dots. The rule of thumb is that the larger quantum dots 
have more energy levels that are more closely spaced. This allows a quantum 
dot to absorb photons containing less energy, that is photons closer to the red 
end of the EM spectrum. Conversely, the smaller a dot, the closer it will be to 
looking bluish. 
 The smaller dimensional size of quantum dots gives rise to a higher density 
of the states (how closely the electron energy levels are packed) than the 
structures with larger dimensions. This results in superior transport and optical 
properties. Owing to these properties, the quantum dots are being explored 
for uses in ampliﬁ ers, biological sensors, diode lasers, and quantum computa-
tion. Figure  11.6 presents a section of the mouse kidney visualized with the 
ﬂ uorescents quantum dot nanocrystals called quantum dot nanocrystal 
conjugates. 
 There are two other semiconductor nanostructures in the neighborhood of 
quantum dots, as described in Problem  11.3 .

 Quantum Wire.   This results from conﬁ nement in 2Ds. It is a 2D conﬁ ne-
ment, therefore the electrons in a quantum wire are only free to move 
in 1D, that is, along the length of the wire. 
 Quantum Dot.   This results from conﬁ nement in 3Ds. Therefore an electron 
in a quantum dot is conﬁ ned in a 3D box with the dimensions ranging 
from one to tens of nanometers. Recombination of carriers facilitates the 
emission of light with precisely deﬁ ned wavelengths depending on the 
size of the dot. In this way, quantum dots can function as lasers in the 
junction layer of a diode. 
 The quantum mechanical conﬁ nement in spatial dimensions, called  dimen-
sional conﬁ nement , has a profound effect on the optical (and electrical) prop-
erties of materials. The optical properties of quantum conﬁ ned nanostructures 
depend on the size (length) of conﬁ nement: The bandgap decreases with an 
increase in the dimensions of conﬁ nement. The quantum conﬁ ned structures 
are remarkably efﬁ cient lasing media. For example, lasers supported by 
quantum wells hold a lion ’ s share of the solid - state laser market. Furthermore, 
the optical (and electronic) properties of quantum conﬁ ned structure exhibit 
strong dependence on the dielectric constant of the surrounding media. This 
offers us the opportunity to manipulate those properties for different purposes 
by tuning the dielectric constant. 
 Table  11.1 presents some examples of nanomaterials or nanostructures at 
the nanosize in 1D, 2D, and 3D. 
 Quantum mechanics governs the behavior of these nanostructures.

effectively fabricate, and use these structures. For example, electrons in nano-
tubes and buckyballs are under the inﬂ uence of quantum conﬁ nement, as 
mentioned earlier. Such a quantum wire can conduct electricity in a truly 
metallic way, but due to its small diameter and sufﬁ cient crystalline nature, the 
electron in it moves as a coherent quantum wave down the wire. Due to 
quantum conﬁ nement, this is the only way it can move: Down the wire, no side 
motions are possible. In aluminum electric wires, there are so many electrons 
together, the quantum effects average out and the ﬂ ow of electricity is pretty 
much a classical phenomena. However, in a quantum wire, the little quantum 
electron can only be there in its coherent wave packet. Now, here it gets even 
more interesting. Consider two nanotubes (or nanowires) next to each other. 
The electron in one wire can suddenly disappear and reappear in the other 
wire, and just keep on going, which is a type of quantum tunneling called reso-
nate tunneling. We discussed quantum tunneling in several chapters in this 
book, including Section  6.4.5 . To understand resonate quantum tunneling cited 
in this example, consider a classical analogy cited by Smalley by imagining that 
you are riding in one train and right next to you is an adjacent train running 
parallel to your train at the same speed. You blink and ﬁ nd yourself in the 
adjacent train, and you are still going in the same direction. So, electrons move 
along the quantum wire, extremely efﬁ ciently, and it is very hard to slow them 
down or stop, because the mechanisms to do that just do not exist. As men-
tioned earlier, they cannot be kicked to the side because there are no sides. 
Now, imagine a lot of wires in parallel and that the electrons in them can tunnel 
to the adjacent wire and keep on going without any loss. In the words of 
Smalley, quantum mechanics is going to save the world and rewire the grid. 
This quantum cable is just one of many possible applications of quantum 
mechanics understood and applied to nanostructures. Realize that the strength 
or stiffness of quantum wires enables this coherent transport of electrons at 
room temperature in the real world, because there are no bends in the quantum 
wires for an electron to localize. 
 You may have noticed that the quantum structures discussed so far are of 
some speciﬁ c shapes; usually part of its name refers to the shape. An interest-
ing science question to ask is Why are they balls, wires, and tubes as in bucky-
balls, quantum wires, and nanotubes, as opposed for example, to triangles and 
pyramids?

 11.3.6  Favoring Balls and Tubes 
 In its spontaneous design and development, nature favors balls and tubes 
(shapes without edges) compared to shapes with edges. This is due to the 
two underlying physical principles that we have emphasized throughout 
this book: 
 1.   A physical system tends to be in its equilibrium state, that is, the most 
stable state. 
 2.  The most stable state is the state with minimum potential energy. 
 At the nanoscale level, energy at the edges matters. For example, even a tiny 
piece of graphite would have many atoms at its edge, which would lead to 
instability. Given the choice, a nanomaterial would naturally roll itself up into 
a ball or tube to get into a stable state by minimizing its potential energy, and 
hence its total energy. When you build nanostructures in the form of balls and 
tubes, you are taking advantage of the natural principles of stability and equi-
librium. These principles are obvious to a physicist, and researchers in other 
ﬁ elds can beneﬁ t by making them a natural component of their scientiﬁ c 
thinking. 
 11.3.7  Fruits of Quantum Conﬁ nement 
 You know from previous chapters that conﬁ nement gives rise to discrete 
energy levels, that is, conﬁ ned particles can only have certain discrete values 
of energies and the energy gaps in between these energies are not allowed. 
This quantum mechanical behavior has already been manipulated in many 
ﬁ elds. For example, the ﬁ elds of semiconductors, electronics, and computer 
industries are based on this. Before we can proceed along this line of thought, 
it is not out of place to review the following concepts: 
  •   Band.  The range of energy that an electron in a solid - state material is 
allowed to have or not have is a band. If this is the energy range in which 
an electron cannot exist, it is called a forbidden band. 
  •   Valence Band.  This is The highest energy band that the electrons bound 
to individual atoms in a solid can have is the valance band. 
  •   Conduction Band.    This band is a range of energy higher than the valence 
band. When an electron is in this range, it is free to move in the solid 
material under the inﬂ uence of an external electric ﬁ eld, that is, the mate-
rial can conduct electricity. 
  •   Band Gap.  The energy gap between the valence band and the conduc-
tion band of a solid - state material is the band gap. This is the gap in 
which an electron cannot exist. In other words, the electrons in the 
valence band must cross the bandgap to make the material electrically 
conductive. 

426  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
  •   Semiconductor.   A material that has electrical conductivity between that 
of a conductor and an insulator. Insulators have a larger bandgap than 
that of a semiconductor. 
 Electronics based on semiconductors are called microelectronics. 
 11.4  QUICK OVERVIEW OF MICROELECTRONICS 
 Most modern electronic devices are based on microelectronics, which is a 
branch of electronics that deals with very small electronic components. A 
multitude of components that used to be part of normal electronic design are 
now available in microelectronic form. Some examples are capacitors, conduc-
tors, diodes, inductors, resistors, and transistors. Microelectronic devices are 
generally made from semiconductors by using techniques such as lithography. 
With the improvement of techniques the size of these devices continues to 
decrease: a journey toward nanoelectronics. 
 11.4.1  Microelectronics: A Hindsight 
 Electronics, in general, is the branch of physics that deals with the ﬂ ow of 
charge through various materials and devices, such as semiconductors and 
vacuum tubes. From the technical perspective, electronics is the workhorse in 
many ﬁ elds including computing, communication, and consumer goods. The 
microchip, also called a chip, is the heart of the electronics age that we cur-
rently live in. It consists of an integrated circuit made of millions of tiny elec-
tronic components called transistors. There are many kinds of chips made for 
different purposes, such as central processing unit (CPU) chip, to execute the 
instructions given to the electronic machine, such as a computer and memory 
chip, to hold data. Modern chips and processors based on them are also called 
microchips and microprocessors, respectively. The advent of microprocessors 
opened the door to the world of small computers, such as desktop PCs and 
laptops. There are computers (or simply called chips) in almost any electronic 
device these days including handheld devices. From supporting the largest 
mainframe computers to hand - held computers, the microprocessor has gone 
through an evolution by following what is called Moore ’ s law, which was origi-
nally based on an empirical observation made by Gordon Moore in 1965. 
Moore ’ s law states that the number of transistors on a chip double about every 
2 years, as depicted in Figure  11.7 . 
 
 Note :  A semiconductor, as the name suggests, is a material that has the electrical 
conductivity halfway between that of a conductor, such as a metal, and an insulator, 
such as rubber. It can work as a conductor at high temperatures and as an insulator 
at low temperatures. 

QUICK OVERVIEW OF MICROELECTRONICS  427
 There are a number of implications to this law including the following: 
  •   Power.  As the number of transistors on a chip is increased, the power or 
performance of the chip (or the microprocessor) will also increase. 
  •   Size.  In order for the increased number of transistors to ﬁ t on the same 
chip, their size has to be decreased. In general, the sizes of individual 
electronic components offering different feature decrease as a result of 
an increase in the number of transistors. 
  •   Cost.  As the number of transistors on a chip increases, the cost per tran-
sistor reduces. That means more power (performance) with less money. 
 A chip consists of an integrated circuit that contains millions of transistors. 
What is a transistor, anyway? A transistor is a device that acts as a current 
ampliﬁ er or an electrically controlled switch. On a chip, a transistor acts like 
a switch that can store one bit of information. For example, the switch state 
 “ on ” corresponds to binary bit 1, and the switch state  “ off ” corresponds to 
binary bit 0. As the size of a transistor decreases the number of electrons 
available in the transistor also decreases. As you keep decreasing the size, you 
run into the hard limit of one electron needed to store one bit. The other 
problem where Moore ’ s law runs into trouble is as follows: as the size passes 
the limit of 0.1  μ m (i.e., 100  nm), you enter the quantum regime where different 
laws of physics are at work. This is where nanotechnology comes to the rescue 
in the form of nanoelectronics.

QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 As already mentioned, there are different kinds of chips, such as processor 
and memory chips. Let us understand a very basic point of how the informa-
tion is stored on a chip. The information on computers is stored in binary 
language, which has only two alphabets called binary bits: 1 and 0. Think of a 
transistor on a chip as a switch, which at a given time can be in one of the two 
possible states: on or off. The switch - on state can represent 1 and the switch - off 
state can represent 0. In the American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII) standard, a character on your computer keyboard, such 
as A or 3 takes 8 bits, called a byte, to store. Each of the eight transistors will 
represent a bit by being in an on or off state. For example, the character K is 
represented by the following binary number: 01001011. It takes eight transis-
tors to store this number. The ﬁ rst transistor is off and represents 0, the second 
transistor is on and represents 1, and so on. In ASCII, this number is a byte. 
So, when somebody says that a computer has 1  GB (gigabyte) of memory, it 
means it can store 1 billion bytes, that is, equivalent to 1 billion characters of 
information. 
 
 Note :  A transistor can be put into on and off states by changing the applied voltage 
across it. For example, the current ﬂ owing through the transistor may represent the 
on state, and no current may represent an off state. 
 The transistors form the integrated circuit on which a microchip is based. 
 11.4.2  Basics of Microchips 
 To understand how a microchip works, you need to understand some related 
concepts discussed in this section. 
 Insulator.   An insulator is a material that does not allow the ﬂ ow of charge 
(electric current) because it has no free electric charge, such as free elec-
trons. In a good insulator, such as glass or quartz, almost all electrons are 
bound to the nuclei. When a voltage is applied across an insulator, no 
electric current ﬂ ows through it. So, insulators are very poor conductors. 
 Conductor.   A conductor is a material that allows the ﬂ ow of charge (elec-
tric current) through it because it has free charge, such as free electrons. 
For example, each atom of iron (Fe) has 26 electrons and each nucleus 
of an Fe atom has 26 protons. This makes Fe electrically neutral as a 
whole. However, 1 – 3 electrons in an iron atom are free to move. That 
means when a voltage is applied across an Fe material, such as a wire, 
the electric current will ﬂ ow through it. All metals are good conductors, 
but copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) are the best. 
 Semiconductor.   A semiconductor is a material with conductivity in between 
that of an insulator and a conductor; that is, the conductivity of a semi-
conductor is better than that of an insulator and worse than that of a 

QUICK OVERVIEW OF MICROELECTRONICS  429
conductor. Silicon (Si) is commonly used to commercially create semi-
conductors. Modern electronic components are made of semiconductor 
materials. The conductivity can be switched on and off. 
 Integrated Circuit.    An integrated circuit is an electronic circuit made of tiny 
components called transistors. A chip is based on an integrated circuit. 
 Transistor.   A transistor is a semiconductor device that can act as an ampli-
ﬁ er or a switch in an electric circuit. It is a basic building block of the 
circuitry used in modern electronic machines, such as computers and cel-
lular phones. Transistors can be used (packaged) individually or as parts 
of an integrated circuit, which can consist of more than a billion of them. 
 Binary Algebra.   Digital electronics and computer chips use the logic of 
binary (also called boolean) algebra, which is based on two digits: 1 and 
0. Here are some basic terms used in binary algebra that you need to 
know: 
  •   Bit.  A bit is a binary digit that can take one of two possible values 1 
or 0. 
  •   Binary Number.  A binary number is a number written in the binary 
numeral system. 
  •   Binary Numeral System.   A binary numeral system is a base - 2 number 
system in which numbers are written in terms of bits, that is, 1 and 0. 
 We are used to the decimal numeral system, which is a base - 10 number 
system. For example, two hundred and ﬁ fty six will be written as: 256, which 
is equivalent to:
 2
10

 The general process to obtain the value from a number written in a com-
bination of digits is 
 1.  Find the value of each digit in the number, which is given by  C i  ×  10 i 
where  i is the position of the digit in the number counted from the right 
with the position of the ﬁ rst digit being 0. For example, the value if  i is 
0 for 6, 1 for 5, and 2 for 2 in the number 256.  C i is the digit itself. 
 2.  Add the values of all the digits in the number. 
 For example the number 1026 can be written as:
 1
10
0
10
2
10
6
10
1026

2

 Because we know that 10 0  is equal to 1 and anything multiplied by 0 is 0, 
we could have simply written it as:

 because multiplying by 1 does not change anything. 
 Now, consider an example of a number written in binary numeral system: 
 1111111 
 Because it has base 2 instead of base 10, the value of each digit (bit in this 
case) will be determined by the following formula:
 Ci
i
× 2  
 The value of  C i is either 1 or 0. If it is 0, we can simply ignore that digit in 
the sum because its contribution to the sum will be zero. 
 Following this the value of 1111111 is

 How many numbers can we represent with a given number of bits. The answer 
is as many unique combinations as you can make from the given number of 
bits. Each unique combination will represent a unique number. If you have 
only one bit, you can only represent two numbers because a bit can be 1 or 0. 
So, two unique combinations, that is, 2 1 . If you have two bits you can have four 
unique combinations: 
 11 
 00 
 10 
 01 
 Therefore, you can represent four, that is 2 2 , numbers. Similarly, if you have 
three bits, you can make eight unique combinations out of them:

 010

QUICK OVERVIEW OF MICROELECTRONICS  431
 To summarize, a microchip is based on an integrated circuit (IC) that 
consists of millions of semiconductor components, such as transistors. 
Instead of making one semiconductor component at a time, the fabrication 
techniques are used to manufacture these millions of components and inter-
connect them on a semiconductor substrate. One such technique is called 
lithography. 
 The electrical properties of semiconductors can be controlled by controlling 
the bandgaps. Various quantum conﬁ ned structures developed from semicon-
ductors by manipulating the bandgaps are already in the market place. 
Different types of conﬁ nement used give rise to different structures, such as 
quantum wires, quantum dots, and quantum wells, already discussed in this 
chapter. How about putting the quantum properties of these particles to work 
in nanoelctronic machines? Now, we are talking about quantum computing. 
 PROBLEM 11.4 
 A classical chip has four bits to represent numbers. 
 (a)  How many numbers can be represented by this chip? 
 (b)  What is the greatest number it can represent? 
 (c)  What is the number represented by 1011? 
 Solution 
 (a)  Each of the four bits can acquire two possible values: 1 or 0. 
 Therefore the total number of arrangement of four bits: 2 4  =  16 
 Therefore, four bits can represent 16 numbers. 
 (b)  The largest number represented by four bits is

 Therefore, the total number of unique combinations that can be made with 
3 bits  =  2 3 . You can generalize this approach to make the statement that  n bits 
can represent 2 n unique numbers. 
 
 Note :  Just like a micro/macrocircuit, a nanocircuit also has three elements: transis-
tors, interconnections, and architecture. All of these elements are dealt within the 
nanoscale.

QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 11.5  QUANTUM COMPUTING 
 A quantum computer is a computer that uses quantum properties of particles 
to represent, store, and process data. In quantum computing, data is repre-
sented by quantum bits, called qubits, as opposed to bits in conventional 
computing. The famous physicist and a noble laureate Richard Feynman pro-
posed the idea of quantum computing in 1982. Quantum computing involves 
controlling and manipulating atoms at individual levels. The researchers 
believe that a quantum computer, once built, will be exponentially faster than 
a classical (that is conventional) computer. This is made possible by a quantum 
process called quantum parallelism, which is a quantum mechanical process 
based on the superposition of base states of a particle that can be exploited 
to perform calculations in parallel. 
 Recall the double slit experiment discussed earlier with two slits  A and  B . 
Consider a particle (e.g., an electron or a photon) emitted by a source that 
arrives at a pair of slits  A and  B . There is a probability that the particle will 
pass through slit  A and some probability that it will pass through slit  B . The 
two behaviors of the moving particle reﬂ ecting these two probabilities exist in 
parallel. In one interpretation, it translates into saying that the particle will 
pass through both slits, which makes no sense in the classical world (that is 
why classical physics fails in the micro - or nanoworld). In other words, the 
particle exists in a state that is a superposition of two  “ classical ” states. Such 
a state can exhibit the effects of interference between the two component 
states or classical realities. We already discussed an example of this in Section 
 5.9 : How chemists have found that a benzene molecule can be represented as 
a resonance hybrid of two structures. Along the same lines, a hydrogen bond 
can be considered as a superposition of two covalent bonds. The key point 
here is that two or more states are active simultaneously and are in parallel 
to one another. This parallelism is believed to be exploited in quantum com-
puting to perform calculations in parallel, and therefore improve performance. 
The key point in superposition is that if a quantum system is capable of exist-
ing in any of a number of individual states, it can also exist in any linear com-
bination of those individual states. 
 As you learned earlier in this chapter, data (or memory) in classical (con-
ventional) computers is made of bits, and each bit can hold one of two values: 
1 or 0. The data in a quantum computer is made up of qubits, where a qubit 
can hold one of many (possibly inﬁ nite) values at the same time. The qubit 
may represent any observable quantity that may have at least two ﬁ nal discrete 
values and is conserved over time. For example, an electron may have a 
spin of  + 1/2 or  − 1/2, called up or down, respectively. The state of an electron 
at a given time is a combination (superposition) of up or down with some 
probabilities attached to each of these two discrete values, and can be 
represented by
 
 Ψ
Ψ
Ψ
=
+
a
b
up
down  
 (11.6) 

QUANTUM COMPUTING  433
where the square of  a  is the probability that the electron has spin  + 1/2 and the 
square of  b is the probability that it has spin  − 1/2. The values of  a and  b in Eq. 
 11.6 can be varied in an inﬁ nite number of ways and yet satisfy the equation. 
Therefore, there are an inﬁ nite number of possible states (superposition states) 
for the electron, and therefore an inﬁ nite number of possible values for the 
qubit that represents the spin of the electron in terms of the superposition of 
two spin states. Recall that there are only two  “ classical ” spin states. However 
the quantum mechanical superposition of these two  “ classical ” states gives rise 
to inﬁ nite quantum mechanical states. 
 There is another way of looking at the qubit in terms of bit in classical 
computing, where a bit represents 1 or 0. Instead, a qubit can represent 1, 0, 
or both simultaneously. What do we mean by  “ both simultaneously ” ? It means 
a qubit can represent 1 and 0 with some probabilities attached to each repre-
sentation. In other words, it is a superposition of two representations (or 
states). Assigning different values to these probabilities gives rise to different 
states and representations. As you can realize, multiple qubits in this process 
work simultaneously on the same computation (or problem), and this paral-
lelism improves the performance. Remember, however, that the ﬁ nal result (or 
solution) of a computation (or measurement) will be a deﬁ nite result and not 
a combination of probabilities. This is consistent with what you learned about 
quantum mechanics in Chapter  5 (e.g., Sections  5.3 and 5.8). 
 Tables  11.2 and  11.3 should give you a feel for the difference between a 
classical and a quantum computer. Table  11.2 presents examples of how three 
bits can be put together to represent numbers, and Table  11.3 shows how three 
qubits can be put together to represent numbers. 
 Some of the challenges facing the advancement in quantum computing 
include the following: 
 •  New Techniques.  If quantum computers were to be used to facilitate 
measurements, the measurement techniques must lend themselves to 
quantum computing. So, we will need to discover new techniques compat-
ible with quantum computing.

 •  New Algorithms.   We will need new algorithms for solving problems that 
will take advantage of quantum computing. 
 •  Decoherence.   Because qubits are superpositions of all the possible states 
of a system, they are correlated with each other. So, if one qubit is cor-
rupted by some external phenomenon, such as passing cosmic rays, the 
whole computation will become useless. This situation is called decoher-
ence because all the qubits are not coherent with each other after some-
thing speciﬁ c happens to one qubit. 
 
 Note :  In general, quantum decoherence is deﬁ ned as the mechanism is which dif-
ferent states of a system seem to collapse as a result of their interaction with the 
external environment. 
 Not only nonliving material, but also living things, the organisms, are at the 
fundamental level composed of atoms and molecules, which also play an 
important role in maintaining life. Therefore quantum mechanics governs the 
living world as much as the nonliving world. Recognition of the importance 
of quantum mechanics in understanding biological systems has given rise to a 
new ﬁ eld called quantum biology. 
 11.6  QUANTUM BIOLOGY 
 Although biologists have in some way dealt with biological molecules since 
the time of Gregor Mendel (1822 – 1884), molecular biology as a ﬁ eld was really 

QUANTUM BIOLOGY  435
launched with the discovery of the DNA structure in the 1950s. Beginning in 
the late 1950s and early 1960s, molecular biologists learned and devised tech-
niques to characterize, isolate, and manipulate to some extent the biological 
molecules including DNA and proteins. Nevertheless, molecular biology is a 
relatively new ﬁ eld and like most of biology is still largely untouched by 
physics, that is, until now. Obviously, the physics useful for molecular biology 
will be quantum physics. Not only molecular biology, but most of biology so 
far has managed successfully to make progress solely on the basis of empirical 
studies and research. In other words, biology (biotechnology included) has a 
large cookbook component: mix up different things and see what happens. 
Process certain foods or drugs through a set of bodies and not through another 
set of bodies, and compare the results. This kind of research is of course impor-
tant, but can only go so far. Here is the good news: Recently, a wealth of 
evidence has emerged to underline the importance of quantum mechanics in 
understanding biological systems. Consequently, a new ﬁ eld called quantum 
biology is emerging. 
 To start with, making and breaking of chemical bonds is constantly happen-
ing inside living organisms, which are undoubtedly quantum phenomena. 
Here, for example, are a few other quantum mechanical phenomena occuring 
in living organisms: absorbance of frequency - speciﬁ c radiation during photo-
synthesis and vision, conversion of chemical energy into mechanical motion 
(e.g., during adenosine triphasphate, ATP cleavage),  magnetoreception in 
animals, and single electron transfers through biological polymers (e.g., DNA 
or proteins). Capabilities provided by nanotechnology will certainly help 
remove the barrier between quantum physics and biology. 
 
 Note :  Magnetoception refers to the ability to detect a magnetic ﬁ eld in order to 
perceive direction, altitude, or location. This ability (or sense) plays a role in the 
navigational abilities of several animal species and has been postulated as a method 
for animals to develop regional maps. For example, sensing of the Earth ’ s magnetic 
ﬁ eld is important to the navigational abilities of birds during migration. 
Megnetoreception ability has also been observed in many other animals including 
bacteria, fruit ﬂ ies, fungi, honeybees, lobsters, sharks, and turtles. 
 There are trillions of quantum machines in your body called cells dealing with 
four fundamental nanostructures of life. 
 11.6.1  Four Fundamental Nanostructures of Life 
 One of the fundamental secrets of nature is the unity behind diversity. What 
we see at ﬁ rst sight is the diversity of nonliving and living things from a unicell 
bacterium to humans. For example, there are at least 10 31 microorganisms,  ∼ 3 
billion species of microorganisms, and  ∼ 6 billion humans on our planet. Behind 
this diversity, there is an underlying unity: All living organisms, animals and 

436  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
plants, are made of cells. Here is another case of diversity: A bacterium is made 
of one cell, whereas an average human being is made of  ∼ 10 trillion cells. Now, 
what is the unity behind this diversity? Well, all cells are largely made up of 
and run by four fundamental nanostructures of life, the four types of molecules 
as listed in Table  11.4 and described below:

 Carbohydrates.   Carbohydrates are largely the energy molecules. Car-
bohydrates serve mostly as a fuel, but some of them are also a building 
material, as they include sugars and polymers of sugar. These are the 
organic molecules that contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a 1:2:1 
ratio. In cells, different kinds of carbohydrates are used as sources of 
internal energy. Table sugar and glucose are some examples. 
 Proteins.   Proteins are the workhorses of life. Proteins support and facilitate 
almost all the dynamic functions of a living organism. These are large, 
complex molecules made up of smaller subunits called amino acids, but 
are not large enough to escape quantum mechanics. Chemical properties 
that distinguish the 20 different amino acids cause the protein chains to 
fold up into speciﬁ c 3D structures that deﬁ ne their particular functions 
in the cell. Proteins play a variety of roles in the cell, including biochemi-
cal (enzymes), cell signaling (hormones), mechanical (muscle), structural 
(cytoskeleton), and transport. Enzymes, the production machines, are a 
special kind of proteins that catalyze biological reactions. 
 Protein molecules are highly structured molecules and their structure 
deﬁ nes their functionality. For example, Figure  11.8 a represents a 3D structure 
of a protein molecule called a myoglobin showing helices called alpha 
helices. This was the ﬁ rst type of protein molecule to have its structure 
revealed by using X - ray crystallography. Hemoglobin, a transport protein 
shown in Figure  11.8 b, transports oxygen from the lungs to other parts of 
the body.

 DNA/RNA.  These information molecules carry the blueprint (genetic 
code) to develop the workforce: the proteins. All the instructions needed 
to direct the activities of a cell are contained within the molecule called 
DNA. The structure of the DNA molecule is called a double helix struc-
ture because it consists of two strands that wind around one another to 
form a shape known as a double helix. As illustrated in Figure  11.9 , each 
of the two strands has a backbone made of alternating sugar (deoxyri-
bose) and phosphate groups. Attached to each sugar is one of four bases: 
adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The two strands 
are held together by bonds between the bases called hydrogen bonds; 
adenine only bonds with thymine and vice versa, and cytosine only 
bonds with guanine and vice versa. The sequence of the bases along 
the backbones serves as instructions for assembling protein and RNA

(ribonucleic acid) molecules. The DNA sequence is the particular side -
 by - side arrangement of bases along the DNA strand (e.g., ATTCCGGA) 
built from a total of four bases: A, T, C, and G, already mentioned. This 
order spells out the exact instructions required to create a particular 
organism with its own unique traits. 
 Lipids.   Lipids are the infrastructure molecules. Lipids form a diverse group 
of hydrophobic molecules, that is, not soluble in water. These molecules 
make fatty, oily, or waxy organic compounds. Fats and cholesterol are 
examples. Phospholipids, an important components of the cell mem-
brane, is another example. These are used as basic building blocks to 
develop sex hormones, gender traits, cell membranes, and also to store 
energy. 
 
 Note :  In nature, only living cells make complex carbohydrates, complex lipids, pro-
teins, and nucleic acids. Through eating, we send in the raw material to make these 
molecules. 
 These molecules make and run the cell. But, how are these molecules them-
selves built? Generally speaking, these molecules are polymers made of 
smaller building blocks called monomers through chemical reactions that link 
two monomers together:

longer polymer

 Figure  11.10 presents the uniﬁ ed picture of life according to molecular biology 
developed so far. Cells, the smallest living systems with the size on the 
microscale level, are the fundamental working units of every living system. 
What directs the cell to function the way it does? All the instructions needed 
to direct the activities of a cell are contained within the DNA molecule called: 
deoxyribonucleic acid, the building block of all life. The DNA from all organ-
isms is made up of the same chemical and physical components. The genome 
is an organism ’ s complete set of DNA. Genomes vary widely in size: The small-
est known genome for a free - living organism (a bacterium) contains  ∼ 600,000 
DNA base pairs (bp), while human and mouse genomes have some 3 billion. 
Except for mature red blood cells, all human cells contain a complete genome: 
A complete set of genes for the individual, that is, the entirety of the hereditary 
information for the individual. The DNA (that contain genes) in the human 
genome is arranged into 23 distinct chromosomes: physically separate mole-
cules that range in length from  ∼ 50 – 250 million bp. Each chromosome contains 
many genes, the basic physical and functional units of heredity. Genes are 
speciﬁ c sequences of bases that encode instructions on how to make proteins. 
Genes comprise only  ∼ 2% of the human genome; the remainder consists of 
noncoding regions, whose functions may include providing chromosomal 
structural integrity and regulating where, when, and in what quantity proteins

are made. The function of a large part of the human genome is not yet well 
understood. 
 
 Note :  A chromosome is a packaging structure that carries DNA in the nucleus of 
a cell. Each chromosome consists of a large molecule of DNA and the proteins 
associated to this molecule that help in the functioning of the DNA. 
 The human genome is estimated to contain 25,000 genes. Although genes 
receive a lot of attention, it is the proteins that perform most life functions 
and even make up the majority of cellular structures. 
 
 Note :  A few types of major chromosomal abnormalities, including missing or extra 
copies or gross breaks and rejoinings (translocations), can be detected by micro-
scopic examination. Most changes in DNA, however, are more subtle and require 
a closer analysis of the DNA molecule to ﬁ nd perhaps single - base differences. 
 The basic biology courses these days are full of stories based on empirical 
study and research. One of the most popular stories is called the central dogma 
of molecular biology. 

QUANTUM BIOLOGY  441
 11.6.2  Central Dogma of Molecular Biology 
 The central dogma of molecular biology explains how protein is made in a cell 
and is illustrated in Figure  11.11 . 
 In the cell nucleus, RNA is produced by a process called transcription, in 
much the same way that DNA replicates itself. The RNA, however, substitutes 
the sugar ribose for deoxyribose (in DNA) and the base uracil for thymine (in 
DNA), and is usually single - stranded, as opposed to double - stranded DNA. 
One form of RNA, the messenger RNA (mRNA), takes the DNA recipe for 
protein synthesis to the cell cytoplasm. There it binds temporarily to a cyto-
plasmic particle known as a ribosome. Each of the three - base sequence units, 
called codons, of the mRNA link to a speciﬁ c form of transfer RNA (tRNA)

containing the complementary three - base sequence. This tRNA, in turn, trans-
fers a single amino acid to a growing protein chain. This way each codon 
unambiguously directs the addition of one amino acid to the growing protein 
chain. However, the same amino acid can be added by different codons because 
multiple codons code for a given amino acid. For example, the mRNA 
sequences GCA and GCC are both specifying the addition of the amino acid 
alanine, (Ala). 
 Currently, molecular biology is based on this central dogma, which itself is 
based on empirical studies and research. Understanding molecular biology in 
terms of the central dogma itself has already helped biotechnology. The next 
big step in molecular biology will be to uncover the hand of quantum mechan-
ics behind the central dogma. This step will enable us to manipulate and 
control the basic processes of life in a more useful and powerful way. 
 As mentioned earlier, classical mechanics is a good approximation of 
quantum mechanics in the macroworld, that is, for objects of large size. On a 
smaller scale, the classical approximation breaks down and we must use 
quantum mechanics to understand and control objects at this scale. Therefore, 
to appreciate the need for quantum mechanics to study the basic building 
blocks of life, it is important to realize their sizes. 
 11.6.3  Sizes of Biological Particles 
 In Section  11.6.1 , we reviewed the role of the basic building blocks of life, such 
as amino acids, proteins made of amino acids, nucleotides, DNA made of 
nucleotides, and cells, largely made of proteins and DNA. Most of these, such 
as proteins and nucleotides, are the nanoparticles and their sizes along with 
their molecular masses are listed in Table  11.5 . 
 Amino acids, which are nanoparticles, compose proteins, which will obvi-
ously be larger in size than amino acids. Similarly, DNA that is composed of 
nucleotides, the nanoparticles, is also expected to be larger in size than the 
nucleotides. Both cells and some structures in the cells fall into the microscale 
size. The sizes of these biological microparticles are listed in Table  11.6 .

    Can you see human cells, such as blood cells, through an optical microscope? How 
about a DNA molecule? 
 Solution: 
 Yes, you can see cells through a light microscope because their size is a few microm-
eters. Actually, biologist have been studying cells and bacteria, which are unicellular 
organisms, by using optical microscopes. 
 The DNA molecule has a diameter of  ∼ 2  nm. So, to inspect a DNA molecule, 
you will need an electron microscope.

 A cell is the basic unit of life in which most biochemical reactions happen, 
for example, those that produce nanostructures like DNA (replication) and 
proteins, in order to develop and maintain a living organism. So, it will not be 
a surprise, if scientists ultimately ﬁ nd that at its very core or bottom, cell is a 
quantum machine. 
 11.6.4  Diving Deeper into the Cell with Quantum Mechanics 
 By using quantum mechanics, we can probe deeper into the cell, in addition 
to studying the cell phenomenon involving the basic molecules of life. As 
Aristotle said: All life involves movement. This is true even when the living 
organism is at total rest. In that case, there is movement at the microscopic 
level, the movement in the cells. Where there is a movement, there is physics 
to explain this movement; and the physics of movement on the microscal (or 
nanoscale) level is quantum physics. You have already heard a micromove-
ment story from your biology class: the central dogma of life. Here is another 
story of micromovement in plant cells, which you might have heard of in a 
biology class as well. 
 This is the story of photosynthesis, the mother of all processes of life to the 
extent that animals feed on plants to get their energy in the form of carbohy-
drates, and plants make carbohydrates by using photosynthesis. Photosynthesis 
takes place in the chloroplast in a plant cell, which is much like the mitochon-
dria in an animal cell. The story begins with photons, particles of light dis-
cussed in this book. Photons are captured in this process to make ATP. 
Chloroplasts use a proton pump (a protein in a cell membrane that transports 
protons out of the cell), which is driven by electrons to generate a proton 
gradient that drives an ATPase turbine engine. These electrons, originally 
captured from water by the magnesium ion, need more energy to come into 
action. This is where photons come into the picture to help the electrons. The 
plant - pigment molecules capture the photons and funnel them toward a mag-
nesium atom in the center of a chlorophyll molecule. The outermost electron 
in the magnesium atom absorbs a photon of sufﬁ cient energy to knock it out 
of the atom. The ionized magnesium atom plucks an electron from a water 
molecule to generate a proton ( H  +  ) and oxygen. The electrons, that gobbled 
up photons, are now energized enough to drive the proton pump. Plant ’ s 
enzymes direct this motion to harness this energy into an ATP molecule. 
Because we are talking here about the motion of quantum mechanical enti-
ties, such as protons, electrons, and pigment molecules; it is a safe bet to claim 
that quantum mechanics is at work in turning sunlight into food through pho-
tosynthesis. As a matter of fact, scientists have already gathered a good evi-
dence that natural photosynthesis (in plants and also in some bacteria) gets 
its remarkable efﬁ ciency, unexpected from classical physics predictions, from 
quantum mechanical phenomena. An example is discussed in Living in the 
Quantum World, Section  11.7 . 
 

QUANTUM BIOLOGY  445
 In animal cells, the energy is harnessed from the chemical energy of food 
molecules, such as glucose (a carbohydrate), but photons are not needed to 
make ATP. The part of the cell where ATP formation occurs in animal cells is 
called the mitochondria, which takes the electrons required to drive the proton 
pump from a molecule called reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
(NADH). 
 As we mentioned in Chapters  2 and  3 , photons and electrons are the par-
ticles whose behavior was responsible for the discovery of quantum mechanics. 
If there is a physicist in the class and you tell a story, such as photosynthesis, 
without mentioning quantum mechanics, you will have a lot of explaining to 
do. If you are a biology student, you know that biology is full of stories casting 
(if not starring) protons, electrons, and ions, such as Na  +  and Mg 2 +  . In fact, the 
directed movement of fundamental particles is involved in all biological activ-
ity at the level of the living cell including digestion, metabolism, growth, pho-
tosynthesis, replication of DNA, and division, which is actually multiplication, 
of cells. 
 Therefore, the movements of these quantum mechanical (fundamental) 
particles in the cell, are essential for all living cells, and therefore for life. This 
underlines the importance of quantum mechanics in understanding the cell at 
its very fundamental level. Here are some more examples of how scientists 
are working at ﬁ nding the hand quantum mechanics plays in biological systems 
and processes: 
  11.6.4.1   It Smells Quanta.    Why do the things smell the way they do? The 
prevailing notion to explain smell has been based on classical thinking: The 
odorant molecules ﬁ t into speciﬁ c receptors in our nostrils compatible with 
their size and shape; which triggers the sensation of different smell, called 
olfaction. This sense of smell stimulates the action potential that olfactory 
nerves transmit to the brain. In this approach, different smells are attributed 
to different structures and shapes of the odorant molecules. Of course, the 
structure and shape of a molecule may play an important role, but there is 
evidence against this being the only factor or even the decisive factor in deter-
mining smell. For example, odorant molecules with a similar structure have 
been found to create different smells. This suggests that it is the interaction 
between the odorant molecules and the receptor neurons, rather than the 
structure of the molecules, that is responsible for creating the sensation of a 
speciﬁ c smell. 
 
 Note :  ATP is an acronym for adenosine triphosphate, a nucleotide molecule com-
posed of an adenine base, the ﬁ ve carbon sugar ribose, and three phosphate groups. 
This is the main energy carrier between reaction sites in cells. The ATPases are a 
class of enzymes that catalyze the decomposition of ATP in order to release the 
energy needed to drive other necessary chemical reactions in the cell and to create 
motion, such as driving our muscles. 

446  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 For example, in 1996, a biophysicist Luca Turin, then teaching at University 
College London, presented a hypothesis based on quantum mechanics to 
explain the creation of smell. Turin ’ s hypothesis proposes that binding of an 
odorant to receptors mediates electron transfer through the odorant by using 
quantum tunneling, which in turn causes the odorant to vibrate. This vibra-
tion pattern will be speciﬁ c to a given odorant molecule and even a small 
change in shape or structure of the molecule will cause a signiﬁ cant change 
in the vibrational spectrum. These different patterns of vibrations cause dif-
ferent smell from different types of odorant molecules. Turin ’ s hypothesis 
has correctly predicted the smell of some chemicals before they were 
synthesized. 
  11.6.4.2   Quantum Elimination of Radicals with Catechin.    This classical 
example illustrates how the empirical research on which most of the today ’ s 
biology is based is only a starting point in understanding processes. It has been 
 Figure 11.12.  The olfactory nerve. 
 Note :  The olfactory nerve, also called cranial nerve I, illustrated in Figure  11.12 , is 
the ﬁ rst of 12 cranial nerves. It is instrumental in the sense of smell. The specialized 
cells of the olfactory nerve called olfactory receptor neurons are located in the 
olfactory mucosa of the upper parts of the nasal cavity. Sense of smell is created by 
the interaction of odorant molecules with the receptor neurons. 

QUANTUM BIOLOGY  447
proven, through empirical research based on injecting mice and population -
 based clinical studies, that green tea is effective in preventing many diseases 
related to free radicals. It is believed that green tea accomplishes this by 
playing the role of an antioxidant. A fundamental research question will be 
Exactly what is the mechanism through which green tea accomplishes this 
task? We have already discussed in this chapter that free radicals are molecules 
in our body, for example, byproducts of the breakdown of food by metabolism, 
that have an unpaired electron that makes the molecule very reactive. These 
molecules travel through the blood stream and cause damage due to their 
reactive nature. It has been proposed by biochemists that an electron from the 
catechin molecule can quantum mechanically tunnel through the gap to get to 
the free radical and unarm it by pairing with the unpaired electron. Green tea 
along with some other products, such as red wine and some fruits and vegeta-
bles, contain the catechin molecules or compounds. 
  11.6.4.3   Quantum Hope for the Hopeless Enzymes.    Enzymes are the types 
of proteins that catalyze the biochemical reactions in the cells of our body. 
Enzymes need to have certain energy in order to support a given reaction. It 
has been found that some enzymes that have less energy than expected from 
classical physics to complete the reactions, were able to do their job anyway. 
This can only be explained through quantum phenomena, such as wave –
 particle duality and quantum tunneling. 
  11.6.4.4   Brain, a Quantum Machine?   It is often said that there are as many 
neurons (specialized cells) in our brain as there are stars in our galaxy, called 
the Milky Way. We are still at the very beginning of understanding how this 
3  lb of matter that deﬁ nes who we are actually works. For example, how does 
consciousness work? Classical mechanics has been unable to explain con-
sciousness. Various hypotheses based on quantum mechanics have been pro-
posed to explain consciousness. For instance, a convincing hypothesis was 
proposed by Stuart Hameroff, an anesthesiologist at the University of Arizona 
at Tucson based on the dynamics of microtubules. Microtubules, illustrated in 
Figure  11.13 , are long hollow cylinders with a diameter of  ∼ 25  nm and a length 
varying from 200  nm to 25  μ m. Microtubules, components of the cytoskeletons 
of eukaryotic cells, form a dynamic framework for many cell activities by 
rapidly assembling when required and disassembling when not. Microtubules 
are involved in many cellular processes including cytokinesis, mitosis, and 
vesicular transport. 
 Each neuron contains hundreds of microtubules. Free electrons in a micro-
tubule play an important role in the dynamics of the microtubule. According 
to classical mechanics when the electrons go to one side of the microtubule, 
they squash that side to cause the other side to elongate, and when they get 
to the other side, the process is reversed. However, according to quantum 
mechanics, as Hamroff proposed, electrons can be on both sides of the tube 
simultaneously causing it squashed and elongated at the same time giving rise 

448  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
to sophisticated quantum mechanical dance out of which consciousness is 
born. Anesthetics, a drug that turns consciousness off, interacts with the 
quantum dance of the electrons as an environment (observer) and causes 
decoherence or the collapse of the wave function, as discussed in Chapter  5 ; 
it is also called quantum entanglement. Hence, the quantum process is stopped 
and as a result consciousness is turned off while the brain still remains active. 
Such hypotheses, although making sense, still need to be tested; although it is 
a good beginning. 
 I can give more examples, but you get the point: A new ﬁ eld, call it quantum 
biology, is in the making. 
 In a nutshell, from the tunneling effect to entanglement, the unique fea-
tures of quantum mechanics allow events to unfold at speeds and efﬁ ciencies 
that would be unachievable by applying laws of classical physics alone. 
For years, experts in biology have doubted that quantum mechanics could 
be driving some of the most elegant and inexplicable processes of life. Yet 
experiments keep ﬁ nding quantum effects at play in biological systems and 
processes. Here is the key to generating new ideas in biology: There are 
many things that atoms and molecules can do, which cannot be understood 
in terms of what living organisms do; whereas there is nothing that living 
organisms do that cannot be understood in terms of what atoms and mol-
ecules can do. Quantum physics is the science to understand what atoms and 
molecules do.

LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD  449
 11.7  EXPLORING THE INTERFACE OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS 
AND QUANTUM MECHANICS 
 There is a widespread belief in the biological community that the quantum 
mechanical effects in biological particles and reactions are negligible. One of 
the arguments given in support of this belief is that the biological molecules 
are macromolecules, that is, molecules with high molar mass. It is true that 
when the de Broglie wavelength of a particle becomes too small, the quantum 
mechanical effects of the particle becomes negligible and the particle can be 
treated as a classical particle: classical approximations are valid. 
 As mentioned earlier, buckyballs (Section  11.3.1 ) with molar mass of 720  Da 
have demonstrated an observable wavelength. As Table  11.5 shows, biology 
offers a wealth of particles with masses over a very wide range with molar 
mass ranging from a few to millions of daltons. These two facts point to the 
following: 
 1.  Some biological particles do function under the inﬂ uence of quantum 
mechanics. 
 2.  The wealth of biological particles can be used to discover and explore 
the interface between quantum and classical mechanics. 
 11.8  LIVING IN THE QUANTUM WORLD 
 Biology, like physics, demonstrates that only a few basic building blocks can 
assemble themselves into complex structures. With the help of quantum 
physics, it is important to understand these basic building blocks and how they 
self - assemble to compose more complex structures. This understanding helps 
the scientists and technologists to use these building blocks and structures to 
build new structures and applications. 
 One of the applications of nanotechnology is clean technology, which has 
turned into a revolution by its own virtue. Clean technology refers to the 
products, services, or processes and tools that deliver value, such as energy, by 
using mostly renewable resources and creates less waste than conventional 
means. Cleantech usually refers to the energy derived from renewable 
resources. The energy derived this way is called renewable or alternative 
energy. Renewable resources are the resources that are naturally replenished 
and you do not run out of them even after you use them to create energy. 
Examples of renewable energy resources are sunlight, wind, tides, and geo-
thermal heat. Examples of nanotechnologies are solar power, wind power, 
hydroelectricity, biomass, and biofuels. Currently, a considerable attention is 
being paid to nanotech ’ s growing impact on clean technology in terms of 
energy and environmental innovation both in the product and the process 
area. 

450  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL  
 One of the examples of a clean energy device is the photovoltaic cell, which 
converts light energy into electrical energy by using the process called the 
photoelectric effect. An example of photovoltaic solar power is presented in 
Figure  11.14 . 
 In the process of the photoelectric effect, photons of light knock electrons 
out of the atoms of a semiconductor material, such as Si. These free electrons 
are collected as electric current, that is, electricity. Poor efﬁ ciency of a solar 
cell based on this process is a major concern. However, to understand and 
manipulate processes like these at the quantum level can help us improve our 
devices and applications. As an example, photosynthesis, the process by which 
plants and some microbes convert water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight into 
oxygen and energy in the form of carbohydrates, was studied at the quantum 
level by a team of scientists led by Graham Fleming at the University of 
California Berkeley in 2007. To study the photosynthesis in green sulfur bac-
teria, the team examined the protein scaffold connecting the bacteria ’ s exter-
nal solar collectors, called the chlorosome, to the reaction centers deep inside 
the cells. Unlike electric power lines, which lose as much as 20% of their energy 
in transmission, these bacteria transmit energy at a staggering efﬁ ciency rate 
of 95% or better. The team concluded that the reason for this excellent efﬁ -
ciency is quantum reality, which is based on wave – particle duality, superposi-
tion of quantum states, uncertainty principle, and collapse of the wave function. 
Inspired by these ﬁ ndings, researchers are looking to mimic nature ’ s quantum 
ability to build solar energy collectors that work with much better efﬁ ciency 
than achieved by traditional photovoltaic cells. For example, Al á n Aspuru -
 Figure 11.14.   The largest photovoltaic solar power plant in the United States is at 
Nellis Air Force Base with the size of 70,000 solar panels worth 15 mega watt of power.

ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS  451
 Guzik ’ s team at Harvard University is performing research to ﬁ nd ways to 
apply the results of the quantum study of photosynthesis into organic photo-
voltaic solar cells. 
 11.9  SUMMARY 
 Quantum mechanics is entering its golden age. Multiple disciplines in science 
have arrived at the stage of their development where they are studying materi-
als and processes at the nanoscale level. This has given rise to a broadly uniﬁ ed 
ﬁ eld called nanoscience and nanotechnology: a juncture for all these ﬁ elds. 
Without a doubt, quantum mechanics governs the structure and behavior of 
matter at the nanoscale level. Empirical studies and research on which some 
disciplines, such as biology, have been based can only go so far. The time has 
come that these ﬁ elds need to use quantum mechanics to make further prog-
ress in areas, such as molecular biology. 
 Electrons, photons, atoms, and molecules are not some exotic state of matter 
conjectured to offer theoretical explanations for complex phenomena or 
explain results from colossal high - energy physics experiments, such as those 
at Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. These particles are in action in 
nanostructures, and these particles are in action right in our bodies: in our eyes 
through which we see, in our brains through which we are conscious of what 
we see, and so on. 
 In a nutshell, quantum mechanics is the science that governs the fundamen-
tal reality of matter including the matter of life. Nanoscience and nanotechnol-
ogy marks the beginning of the molecular age that will be governed by the 
laws of quantum physics. 
 11.10  ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS 
 Problem 11.5  Show that the wavelength of an electron moving through the 
electric potential  V is given by
 λ = 1.23
V
 
 Problem 11.6  Calculate the speed of the electron moving in 60  kV voltage 
difference. 
 Problem 11.7  The incident electron beam in a TEM has been accelerated by 
applying a voltage of 200  kV. What is the electron wavelength of this beam? 
 Problem 11.8  Compare the diameter of a buckyball to the thickness of a 
human hair. 

452  
QUANTUM MECHANICS: A THREAD RUNS THROUGH IT ALL

numbers are represented by the following arrangement of qubits? 
 First bit:   Ψ 1 
 Second bit:  a Ψ 0  +  b Ψ 1 
 Third bit:   Ψ 0 
 Fourth bit:  a Ψ 0  +  b Ψ 1
