where cij = cji. Since for fermions the RHS of (6) is the most general state pos-
sible, fermions, at least in ﬁnite dimensions, are always discernible. Evidently the
same cannot be said of bosons; symmetric product states, such as φjφj, can be
discerned by these methods only if subject to an evolution which leaves them entan-
gled [16].
The upshot is that violation of the PII is neither sufﬁcient nor necessary for the SP.
But it would be wrong to conclude that the two principles are completely unrelated.
There is, indeed, a very simple sense in which the PII together with exact similarity
implies the SP, for they imply that states of affairs that differ only by permutations
of particles should be identiﬁed – in Dirac’s notation, that (a, b) and (b, a) be iden-
tiﬁed. But then the same principles should apply to classical statistical mechanics
as well (for classical particles may surely be exactly similar); the explanation of
quantum statistics cannot be traced to these – or not in isolation from other features
of quantum mechanics, whether to do with identity over time, or the discrete nature
of probability measures on Hilbert space [5], in line with early suggestions by Max
Planck (1858–1947) and Hendrik A. Lorentz (1853–1928) [17].

Ignorance Interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics
Peter Mittelstaedt
Let S be a proper quantum system with  Hilbert space HS that is prepared in a
 mixed state given by the self-adjoint operator WS = WS+ with tr{WS} = 1.
Here, we assume that WS is not a pure state, i.e. WS ̸= WS2.
Two kinds of mixed states can be distinguished by their preparation.
(a) A “mixture of states” [1], a “real mixture” [2], or a “Gemenge” [3] is an ensem-
ble S(pk, ϕk) of pure states ϕk with probabilities pk.
(b) System S is a subsystem of a compound system S∗= S + S′ with Hilbert space
H∗= HS ⊗HS′ that is prepared in a pure state ∗(S + S′).
In case (a) the mixed state WS = 
i pi P[ϕI] may be considered as a for-
mal description of the “Gemenge” S(pk, ϕk) in terms of Hilbert space quantum
mechanics. Hence, there are obviously no difﬁculties for interpreting the state
WS = 
i pi P[ϕi] as a description of a system S that is objectively in one of
the states ϕi, which is, however subjectively unknown to the observer who knows
only the probability pi. In this situation, we say that the state WS admits “ignorance
interpretation”.
In case (b) the mixed state of the subsystem S of S∗is given by the partial trace
WS = tr′ P[∗] where tr′ denotes the summation over the degrees of freedom of
S′. It is easy to demonstrate that WS = WS+ with tr {WS} = 1. However, nothing
is known about the decomposition of WS into weighted components correspond-
ing to pure states. If the spectrum of WS is not degenerate, then there is a uniquely
deﬁned spectral decomposition WS =  pi P [ψi] of WS into orthogonal, i.e. mu-
tually exclusive states ψi. The states ψi are eigenstates of the operator WS and the
coefﬁcients pi are the eigenvalues. Hence, for any i ∈N the eigenvalue equation
WS ψi = pi ψi holds. However, the decomposition of the state WS is by no means
