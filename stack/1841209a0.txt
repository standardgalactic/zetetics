trace is possible before the system is reset by opening 
the gate manually. 
A typical record is shown in Fig. 2. 
Starting at 
A, which is arranged to be on a resonant point for 
reference, the distance between pips becomes less, 
indicating acceleration of the piston, until the third 
line down where after a rapid deceleration the wave-
shape is" seen to reverse, at B, indicating that the piston 
has reversed and is now going the other way down the 
tube. 
On the fourth line at O another reversal is 
evident. The resonant points are indicated by positive 
pips because the amplifier reverses the sign of the 
signal. 
These film records were analysed to give a plot of 
piston position (x) against time (t). From such plots 
the maximum piston velocity is taken. Figs. 3 and 4 
summarize these results. Initial acceleration was also 
measured from the x-t plots assuming the accelera-
tion to be constant over the first few stations, the 
results being :

A STRUCTURAL MODEL FOR MONATOMIC LIQUIDS 
INCLUDING METALLIC LIQUIDS 
By DR. KAZUO FU RU KA WA

A
LTHOUGH the melting point (Tm) is generally 
determined thermodynamically, it is interesting 
that Lindemann's 
geometrical law1 
is effective 
in determining the melting condition of solids. 
So 
we have studied the structure of liquids at their 
melting points in the hope of finding some similar 
law. 
So far, radial distribution curves for 18 monatomic 
liquids near their melting points have been obtained 
by X -ray or neutron diffraction measurements, and 
they give co-ordination numbers (Z) and the distance 
(r 1 ) of the nearest neighbour. However, the values 
of Z so far obtained are less reliable than those of r 1 ; 
it is probable that in some cases we obtained low 
values. Therefore, we calculated Z from r 1 and the 
bulk density (measured) assuming a quasi face-
centred cubic lattice. The calculated values Zeal. were 
between 10 and 11 ·5 (mean value 10·85, about 
90 per cent of 12. Table I).

•Acal.= r 1/(l ·5)1I•. 
The shape of the curves was analysed by Wall's 
theory• using the spherical free volume of radius cr. 
According to this theory, (r 1 -
cr) = A corresponds 
to the position on the shorter side-branch at a 
height of 34 ·4 per cent of the maximum value in 
the first peak of the curve 41trp(r), where p(r) is the 
atomic number density at a distance r from any 
atom. Hence we measured Aob. from radial distribu-
tion curves, and obtained the empirical formula : 
r,/Aob. = {l ·5) 1 / 3 (Table 1). 
Assuming a molecule to be a sphere (nearly rigid)• 
of diameter A at Tm, the following model can be 
postulated : Let V O be the volume at closest packing 
of spherical molecules of diameter A, then the volume 
of liquid at Tm is I ·5 V O for quasi face-centred cubic 
lattice. But about 10 per cent of the sites in this 
quasi-lattice are empty, and these spaces are dis-
tributed through all interstices, explaining the second 
peak at l ·9r 1 of the distribution curves. 
Thus the 
total volume is about l ·65 V 0• 
Using this model of a reduced form independent 
of materials, several properties of liquids can be 
explained as follows. 
Self-diffusion and viscous 
flow in liquids are easily explained. The self-diffusion 
coefficient of a liquid at its melting point may 
be expressed3·4 
as: 
Dm = y r 1
2 'Im exp(t:..Sv/R) 
exp( -HD/RTm), where yr 12 is the mean square of 
jump distances, vm the frequency of the liquid at 
Tm and t:..SD and HD the activation entropy and 
energy of diffusion respectively. 
Now y, 
t:..Sn, 
HvJRTm and Dmf(r 1• vm) must all be constants inde-
pendent of the material. 
If 'Im is calculable from 
Lindemann's formula, 
vm = 2·8 x 1012 Tml 1SJJ,.[-112 
Vm- 11•, where Mis the molecular weight and Vm the 
molar 
volume, 
Dm/(r 2
1 vm) 
is 
obtainable from 
experimental values of Dm, and is nearly constant 
(Table 2). 
The experimental values of Hn/Tm and H71/Tm 
are also nearly independent of the material, where 
Hr, is an activation energy of viscosity (Table 2). 
Differences between the liquid metals and other 
material may be explained by the expansion co-

efficients the ratio of which is of the order of IO-•. 
In fact, under the condition of constant volume 
Hn/RTm becomes 2 · 14 for CCI, 5 , and l ·26 for 
C 6H 6 •, from isobaric experiments, and becomes 2 ·07 
for Hg•, l ·63 for Ga•, l ·65 for CC1 4 5 and l ·40 for 
C 6H 6 • 
by computation from isothermal experi-
ments using• their expansion coefficients and com-
pressibilities. 
So putting Hn/RTm = l ·6 at constant volume, we 
obtain 6Sn/R = -
3·1 ± 0·3 independent of the 
materials from their values Dmf(r 1
2 vm) of Table 2. 
6S n < 0 can easily be explained by a 
more 
regulated activated-complex configuration composed 
of planar 4 or 5 atoms in the closest contact than the 
ordinary irregular configurations. 
Considering the 
above, it is of interest that A nearly coincides with 
the metallic bond-lengths of co-ordination number 3 
calculated by Pauling's theory7 (r (3) in Table 1). 
Combining these facts with the Sutherland-
Einstein formula 8, DY/ = kT/(211:A), we can easily 
deduce Andrade's formula•

putting 
Dm/(r21 Vm) = 0·0067. 
The 
calculated viscosity coefficients at Tm, 'llm,cal., are in 
good agreement with the experimental values Y/m,ob.

Moreover, using Wall-Harasima's free volume 
theory2,10, and adding the entropy of random arrange-
ment of vacancies as a cruder treatment of this 
model, the entropies of the liquids at their melting 
points were calculated; the values agreed with the 
observed ones (Table 3). 
The above discussion shows that tho metallic 
liquid is not a 
special liquid. 
Thus we need 
not consider the ionic unit4, 11,12 in the transport 
phenomena. 
The model will become more complete when com-
bined with the recent work of Bernal'•, who explained 
the essential difference between regular and irregular 
close-packing arrangements having a volume differ-
ence of about 10 per cent, which agrees with our 
model.

tions will be published elsewhere.

POL YNUCLEAR COMPLEXES OF MOL YBDENUM(II) 
By DR. J. C. SHELDON 
William Ramsay and Ralph Forster Laboratories, University College, London, W.C.I 
A
LTHOUGH molybdenum(II) chloride and its 
co-ordination complexes have been known for 
a century, they have received but little attention. 
As a result of the virtual absence of physical studies 
on these compounds, not only was nothing known of 
their constitution until a few years ago, but incorrect 
molecular formulro were even adopted. The relatively 
recent X-ray diffraction studies by Brosset1- 3 have 
done much to improve the position, though the 
bonding present in molybdenum(II) chloride deriva-
tives has never been seriously discussed and many 
simple physical measurements remain to be done 
and correlated with the proposed structures. 
A 
re-investigation of these compounds is now par-
ticularly important as they appear to possess a 
stereochemistry quite different from that indicated 
for d• metal complexes by ligand field theory. There-
fore molybdenum(II) chloride and its derivatives 
are being re-examined and it is now possible to 
summarize some new experimental results and pro-
pose a bonding scheme for these compounds. 
This 
bonding scheme is able to explain why only certain 
types of ligands form molybdenum(II) chloride 
complexes. 
The crystalline compounds studied by Brosset 
were formulated on the basis of his structure determ-
inations as 
[(Mo.Cl8){(OH) 4(H 2O) 2}J.12H 2O 1 
and 
[(Mo6Cl8){Cl,(H 2O) 2}].6H2O •. 
The structure of the 
(Mo6Cl8 ) 4+ group, fully named octa-µ 3-chlorohexa-
molybdenum(II) and henceforth referred to as the 
chloromolybdenum(II) group, is given in Fig. I. It 
is convenient for most purposes to regard the group
