eading is foundational to modern civilization, yet the mech-
anisms by which the human brain converts orthographic 
inputs to lexical and semantic concepts are poorly understood. 
Orthographic representations are thought to be organized hierarchi-
cally in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (vOTC) with bottom-up 
reading-specific processes that culminate in the visual word form 
area (VWFA)1–3, a region that selectively responds to written stimuli 
in known scripts and is involved in sub-lexical processing. At the 
front end of this process is the conversion of the retinal image of a 
written word to an invariant representation of its component letters 
via a bank of letter detectors3–5. Beyond this there are two possible 
processes that occur. The first posits ‘local combination detectors’3,4, 
that encode combinations of frequent, highly diagnostic groups 
of letters, bigrams (for example, ‘E left of N’) or morphemes (for 
example, ‘TION’), to interpret words. The second mechanism posits 
‘spatial coding’6,7, wherein each letter is bound to its ordinal position, 
and the combination of letters by positions creates a unique lexical 
code for each word that is independent of intermediate sub-lexical 
units. Recently, it has been argued that these two codes coexist in 
fluent readers: the bigram code for fast lexical access and the posi-
tional letter code for accurate reading of novel words and pseudo-
words via the phonological route8. The notion of local combination 
detectors has received support from functional MRI experiments 
which reveal a bigram frequency effect in classical VWFA1–3 and 
a posterior-to-anterior gradient of responsivity to letters, frequent 
bigrams, quadrigrams and whole words within the left vOTC3,9,10. 
Additionally it appears that both automatic11,12 and attentionally 
driven2,13 top-down influences play a crucial role in modulating 
activity within vOTC during reading. However, the roles that spe-
cific components of vOTC play in the integration of bottom-up pro-
cesses1–3 with top-down influences11,14–21, and how this enables rapid 
orthographic–lexical–semantic transformations, are unknown.
More broadly, the majority of our knowledge of the cortical 
architecture of reading arises from functional MRI. However, the 
rapid speed of reading demands that we use methods with very high 
spatiotemporal resolution to study these processes. For instance, 
the posterior-to-anterior gradient in vOTC described above, and 
its sensitivity to lexicality13 and word frequency13,19,22,23, could arise 
from late top-down feedback from lexical areas2,15. These tempo-
ral limitations of fMRI preclude a true understanding of interac-
tive information flow between substrates in the ventral stream. To 
comprehensively chart the spatial organization and functional roles 
of orthographic and lexical regions across the ventral visual path-
way during sub-lexical and lexical tasks, we performed intra-cranial 
recordings in 35 individuals using 784 electrodes, using paradigms 
with systematically varied levels of attentional modulation of ortho-
graphic processing. Specifically, we isolated separable, functionally 
distinct vOTC regions highly sensitive to the structure and statistics 
of natural language at multiple stages of orthographic processing 
and then showed, through direct cortical stimulation, a causal link 
to the ability to read.
Results
Participants participated in passive viewing and sentence read-
ing tasks designed to disambiguate the roles of sub-regions and 
top-down attentional modulation within the vOTC. In the pas-
sive viewing task, participants viewed strings of false font char-
acters (FF), infrequent letters (IL), frequent letters (FL), frequent 
bigrams (BG), frequent quadrigrams (QG) or words (W) while 
detecting a non-letter target (Fig. 1a,b). In the sentence reading 
task, participants attended to regular sentences, word lists or jab-
berwocky sentences, all presented in rapid serial visual presentation 
format, followed by a forced choice decision of presented versus 
non-presented stimuli (Fig. 1c,d).

Reading is a rapid, distributed process that engages multiple components of the ventral visual stream. To understand the neural 
constituents and their interactions that allow us to identify written words, we performed direct intra-cranial recordings in a 
large cohort of humans. This allowed us to isolate the spatiotemporal dynamics of visual word recognition across the entire left 
ventral occipitotemporal cortex. We found that mid-fusiform cortex is the first brain region sensitive to lexicality, preceding the 
traditional visual word form area. The magnitude and duration of its activation are driven by the statistics of natural language. 
Information regarding lexicality and word frequency propagates posteriorly from this region to visual word form regions and 
to earlier visual cortex, which, while active earlier, show sensitivity to words later. Further, direct electrical stimulation of this 
region results in reading arrest, further illustrating its crucial role in reading. This unique sensitivity of mid-fusiform cortex to 
sub-lexical and lexical characteristics points to its central role as the orthographic lexicon—the long-term memory representa-
tions of visual word forms.

Word responsive electrodes were defined as all electrodes with 
>20% gamma band activation and P < 0.01 (one-tailed z test) above 
a pre-stimulus baseline (−500 to −100 ms) during real word view-
ing. Responsiveness was seen across the entire vOTC from the 
occipital pole to mid-fusiform cortex in the left, language-dominant 
hemisphere, and only in the occipital pole of the right hemisphere 
(Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 1). All presented analyses were con-
strained to the left hemisphere.
Orthographic processing in vOTC. We computed gamma band 
activity in two windows to characterize early (100–400 ms24) and 
late processes (400–600 ms). On the basis of prior work by us24,25 
and by others that characterizes functionality of the vOTC19,26, we 
demarcated it into anterior and posterior regions (y = −40 mm). 
We found that anterior vOTC sites were more responsive to words 
than to FF and IL stimuli, especially in the later time window, when 
word-induced activation was sustained longer than for other stimuli 
(Fig. 2d,f). Further, anterior vOTC showed greater activation for 
lower versus higher frequency words (SUBTLEXus27; 100–400 ms) 
and longer rather than shorter words (Fig. 2e,g).
In distinction, posterior vOTC responded most to false fonts and 
did not distinguish between other non-word stimuli in early time 
windows (100–400 ms), but at later time points (400–600 ms) acti-
vation there was sensitive to sub-lexical complexity. In the sentence 
reading task, posterior sites were sensitive to word length and less 
so to word frequency.
To evaluate the consistency of these effects across the popula-
tion, we performed a mixed-effects, multilevel analysis (MEMA) 
of broadband gamma (70–150 Hz) power between 100–400 ms, in 
grouped normalized 3D stereotactic space. This analysis is specifi-
cally designed to account for sampling variations and to minimize 
effects of outliers25,28–34. This MEMA map showed that written words 
activated the left vOTC from occipital pole to mid-fusiform cortex 
(Fig. 3a). We then used this map to delineate regions showing pref-
erential activation for words compared with non-word stimuli (Fig. 
3b). A clear posterior-to-anterior transition—from occipital cortex 
to mid-fusiform gyrus—was observed. We again noted that anterior 
vOTC—specifically mid-fusiform cortex—responded prominently 
to words. It also distinguished between IL stimuli and real words but 
did not show substantial difference between words and word-like 
stimuli (FL, BG and QG). This selectivity pattern was reversed in 
posterior occipitotemporal cortex, which was more active for FF 
stimuli than for words.
To further characterize this spatial gradient, we plotted 
responses as a function of electrode location along the y axis in 
Talairach space. Posterior to −40 mm, there was no significant 
difference between real words and any other stimulus type (Fig. 
3c; −100 to −80 mm: one-way ANOVA, F(5,42) = 3.68, P = 0.008, 
Tukey’s, P = 0.32 to 0.90, M = −0.12 to 0.15, Cohen’s d = −0.54 to 
0.43; −80 to −60 mm: one-way ANOVA, F(5,48) = 4.83, P = 0.001, 
Tukey’s, P = 0.05 to 0.99, M = −0.33 to 0.13, Cohen’s d = −0.26 to 
0.63; −60 to −40 mm: one-way ANOVA, F(5,54) = 2.05, P = 0.09, 
Bayes factor (BF01) >109). Around −40 mm in the antero-posterior 
axis in Talairach space, a distinct transition occurred: respon-
sivity to FF and IL dropped substantially (one-way ANOVA, 
F(5,84) = 13.3, P < 0.001; Tukey’s, FF: P < 0.001, M = 0.56, 95% 
CI 0.27–0.85, Cohen’s d = −0.57, IL: P < 0.001, M = 0.61, 95% CI 
0.33–0.90, Cohen’s d = −0.63) and responses became fully selec-
tive for words and word-like stimuli (FL, BG and QG; Tukey’s, 
P = 0.10–0.90, M = 0.10–0.25, Cohen’s d = −0.26–−0.10). An anal-
ysis at a higher temporal resolution revealed that vOTC anterior 
of −40 mm initially distinguishes word-like letter strings from IL 
and FF between 100 and 200 ms (Extended Data Fig. 2; one-way 
ANOVA, F(5,54) = 6.49, P < 0.001; Tukey’s, FF: P < 0.001, M = 0.69, 
95% CI 0.29–1.09, Cohen’s d = −0.89, IL: P = 0.037, M = 0.42, 95% 
CI 0.02–0.82, Cohen’s d = −0.54).
A 4D representation of the evolution of the functional selec-
tivity in the vOTC was generated by performing MEMA on 
short, overlapping time windows (150 ms width, 10 ms spacing) 
to generate successive images of cortical activity (Supplementary 
Videos 1 and 2). These analyses clearly illustrate the primacy 
of the mid-fusiform cortex in word identification. Within the 
mid-fusiform cortex (39 electrodes, 13 participants), each 
non-word class has a distinct difference in duration of activa-
tion—with increasing sub-lexical structure, the latency of word/
non-word distinction increases (IL: 170 ms, FL: 290 ms, BG: 
380 ms, QG: 410 ms; one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank, q < 0.01; 
Fig. 3d and Supplementary Video 2).
This 4D representation also reveals that, at later time periods 
(>300 ms), an anterior-to-posterior propagation of word selectivity 
occurs—posterior regions show greater sustained activity for words 
rather than non-words. To further elaborate this antero-posterior 
spread of word selectivity, we calculated the sensitivity index (d 
prime for words versus all non-word stimuli) over time at each elec-
trode in vOTC to find the earliest point where responses for real 
versus non-words diverged (Fig. 3e; P < 0.01 for >50 ms). Again, the 
mid-fusiform cortex showed the earliest word selective response 
(~250 ms), and this selectivity then progressed posteriorly to occipi-
tal pole (~500 ms). A correlation of the latency of d prime signifi-
cance with the y axis quantified this anterior-to-posterior selectivity 
gradient (Pearson correlation, r(205) = −0.33, P < 0.001, 95% CI 
−0.48 to −0.21).

In summary, word selectivity in vOTC during passive viewing 
occurs first in mid-fusiform cortex (mFus). This selectivity then 
spreads posteriorly to earlier visual regions such as posterolateral 
vOTC, which while active early, demonstrates word selectivity later. 
Within mid-fusiform cortex, we observe latency differences in 
word/non-word categorization on the basis of the sub-lexical com-
plexity of presented letter strings.
Lexical processing in mid-fusiform cortex. Next, we sought to 
examine how this spatiotemporal lexical response pattern relates to 
higher-order processes, such as sentence reading, that engage the 
entire reading network. Lexical contrasts between high versus low 
frequency words and real versus pseudowords, of gamma activ-
ity between 100–400 ms after each word, revealed two significant 
clusters consistent across both contrasts—the mid-fusiform cortex 
(mFus) and lateral occipitotemporal gyrus (Fig. 4a,b). In this task, 
where words were attended, we saw a reversal of the word versus 
non-word selectivity seen in the previous, passive viewing task: 
pseudowords in Jabberwocky sentences showed greater activation 
than real words2,13, suggesting that the task itself modulates activity 
in mFus.
To quantify the relative sensitivity of mFus (49 electrodes, 15 par-
ticipants; Fig. 4c) to word frequency and word length, we performed 
a linear mixed effects (LME) analysis with fixed effects modelling 
word length and log word frequency (Fig. 4d). A large proportion 
of the variance of this region’s activity (r2 = 0.73) is explained by 
word frequency (t(336) = −10.9, β = −7.6, P < 0.001, 95% CI −8.9 
to −6.2) and word length (t(336) = 4.6, β = 2.4, P < 0.001, 95% CI 
1.4–3.5), though their interaction has no significant impact on 
mFus activity (t(336) = −1.1, β = −0.45, P = 0.29, 95% CI −1.3 to 
0.4, BF01 = 45). Further, to eliminate the confound of transition 
probabilities inherent to sentence construction, we separately ana-
lysed activity for the word list condition (Extended Data Fig. 3). 
This LME model revealed no significant interaction between word 
frequency in syntactically correct sentences or in unstructured 
word lists (t(580) = −0.55, β = −0.3, P = 0.58, 95% CI −1.3 to 0.8, 
BF01 = 49), thus disambiguating word frequency from predictability. 
We also assessed effects of other closely related parameters, bigram 
frequency and orthographic neighbourhood for the pseudoword 
stimuli in mid-fusiform cortex, which have been invoked by ‘local 
combination detector’-based reading models3,4. We found no sig-
nificant effects of bigram frequency (LME: t(156) = 1.8, β = 4.4, 
P = 0.08, 95% CI −0.5 to 9.3, BF01 = 4.0), mean positional bigram 
frequency (LME: t(187) = 0.05, β = −0.11, P = 0.96, 95% CI −3.8 to 
4.0, BF01 = 23), open bigram frequency (LME: t(195) = 1.1, β = 1.9, 
P = 0.26, 95% CI −1.4 to 5.3, BF01 = 11) or orthographic neighbour-
hood (LME: t(84) = 0.96, β = 4.9, P = 0.34, 95% CI −5.3 to 15.3, 
BF01 = 3.9).
Lastly, we evaluated the effect of word frequency on latency 
of lexicality in mFus by computing time courses of activation for 
high, mid and low frequency words and pseudowords, all matched 
for word length. We found a clear separation of duration of activ-
ity dependent on word frequency. High frequency words (180 ms) 
were distinguishable from pseudowords earliest, followed by 
mid-frequency words (270 ms) and lastly low frequency words 
(400 ms) (one-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank, q < 0.01; Fig. 4e).
Temporal dynamics of lexical processing. To replicate this analy-
sis at the level of individual electrodes rather than for the popula-
tion, we performed a multiple linear regression using broadband

gamma activity at individual electrodes (Fig. 4f). Like the MEMA 
(Fig. 4a), this also revealed distinct separations in activity between 
mid-fusiform cortex and lateral occipitotemporal cortex. An LME 
model over time (Fig. 4g) showed an effect of word length first at 
the occipital pole (75 ms) and then more anteriorly. Conversely, 
frequency sensitivity appeared earliest in lateral occipitotemporal 
cortex and mid-fusiform cortex (150 ms) and spread posteriorly. 
Thus, across all our data, we see two temporal stages of lexical 
selectivity: initial selectivity in mid-fusiform cortex followed by an 
anterior-to-posterior spread of selectivity.
In our final analysis, we used an unsupervised clustering algo-
rithm, non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF), on the time 
courses of the lexical and sub-lexical selectivity to quantify their spa-
tiotemporal overlap and separability. An NNMF of the time courses 
of d prime selectivity for words versus all non-words in the pas-
sive viewing task (Fig. 5a) revealed a now familiar pattern: an early 
component in mid-fusiform and a late component in posterolateral 
vOTC and occipital sites (Fig. 5d). These components were pre-
served in analyses for each of the non-word conditions (Extended 
Data Fig. 4a, b). With increasing sub-lexical complexity, the early 
component diminished, and the late component remained highly 
consistent, representing latency differences in the mid-fusiform for 
distinguishing these conditions from words (Fig. 3d and Extended 
Data Fig. 4c).
An NNMF analysis of time courses of z scores of lexical selectiv-
ity, distinguishing pseudowords from real words and high from low 
frequency words (Fig. 5b,c), revealed an almost identical pattern: an 
early component in mid-fusiform cortex and a late component over 
posterolateral vOTC and occipital sites (Fig. 5e,f). The late compo-
nent was remarkably similar in time course to that seen in the pas-
sive viewing task; however, the early component was variable across 
these two conditions, reflecting differences in latency in the distinc-
tion of different frequency words discussed earlier.
Direct cortical stimulation of reading areas. To test the causal, 
rather than correlational role of these regions in reading, we per-
formed direct cortical stimulation of the vOTC in two participants 
with subdural grid electrodes (SDEs) who had coverage across both 
the mid-fusiform cortex and lateral occipitotemporal gyrus in their 
language-dominant hemisphere (one right and one left hemisphere

Stimulation of either region resulted in slowed word production or full 
reading arrest (Supplementary Video 3). Both participants reported 
comparable subjective experiences, that the words were clearly vis-
ible and in focus but they were unable to read them; “I can see it, It’s 
like I don’t know how to read” (TA774B), “Even though I can see the 
words I can’t say them” (TS146B). Stimulation during other naming 
and speech production tasks resulted in no deficits. Both participants 
reported no perceptual differences between stimulation at each site.
Discussion
Our work reveals two spatiotemporally distinct constituents of the 
vOTC that perform distinct roles and are causally linked to reading: 
mid-fusiform cortex and lateral occipitotemporal gyrus. Of these, 
our work shows the central role of the mid-fusiform cortex in both 
word versus non-word discrimination and lexical identification. 
The amplitude and duration of activity in these regions are highly 
sensitive to the statistics of natural language, including word fre-
quency and lexicality.
Our finding that orthographic-to-lexical transformation occurs 
in mid-fusiform cortex is concordant with emerging evidence from 
lesion-symptom mapping35–37 and intra-cranial stimulation stud-
ies38,39. It is also congruent with functional imaging studies of word 
frequency13,19,22,23 and those that show greater activation for attended 
pseudowords than known words in the vOTC13. We find that lateral 
occipitotemporal cortex, while active earlier, displays sensitivity to 
lexical processing later than mFus cortex. The early and late selec-
tivity in these regions during both sub-lexical and lexical process-
ing is a potential correlate of bottom-up and top-down processes. 
The existence of two separable ventral cortical regions with distinct 
lexical and sub-lexical sensitivities is concordant with the view of a 
non-unitary VWFA19,26,40.

expected to be tuned to word frequency and lexicality. Indeed, these 
two features were found to be coded earliest in mid-fusiform cortex 
and drive its activity. Our model, incorporating just word frequency 
and length, explained 73% of the variance of mid-fusiform activa-
tion. This central role of the mid-fusiform has also recently been 
suggested by selective haemodynamic changes following training to 
incorporate new words into the lexicon43,44.
The latency distinctions we observed in the mid-fusiform for 
words of varying lexical and sub-lexical frequency are also consis-
tent with a heuristic where the prime driver of search in the neural 
lexicon is word frequency, and this search terminates once a match 
is found45,46. Under this hypothesis, higher frequency words are 
matched to a long-term memory representation faster than infre-
quent words, while pseudowords require the longest search times, 
since they do not match any long-term memory representations. 
These latency differences invoke the possibility that this region 
functions as the ‘bottleneck’ that limits reading speed19,47,48.
Given previous behavioural and imaging results, we initially 
predicted sensitivity in vOTC to orthographic neighbourhood or 
bigram frequency, thought to be predictors of speed and accu-
racy of non-word identification49–51. During passive viewing, there 
were latency differences in word/non-word discrimination in 
mid-fusiform on the basis of n-gram frequencies. However, during 
sentence reading, neither of these factors showed significant effects 
on pseudoword activation in mid-fusiform cortex. The influence 
of these factors on orthographic processing may depend on the 
demands of the specific task52,53. Specifically, both factors have been 
shown to play a role in how quickly participants reject non-words 
in lexical decision, and may be more indicative of how participants 
perform that particular task rather than reflect automatic word 
identification processes.
The existence of an anterior-to-posterior spread of lexical and 
sub-lexical information from mid-fusiform cortex to earlier visual 
processing regions implies recursive feedback and feedforward 
interactions between multiple stages of visual processing within the 
ventral stream. This notion has a storied past in cognitive models 
of reading, including the interactive activation model5, its deriva-
tives42,54 and the interactive account14,15. The direct measurement

of this anterior-to-posterior spread from mid-fusiform implies its 
role in mediating input from frontal regions26 during word11,12,21 and 
object55 recognition.
Our data suggest that, during bottom-up prelexical process-
ing, there may be a direct transition from letter recognition to the 
lexicon. Here, we found that, during the initial bottom-up phase of 
orthographic processing, the full gradient which was reported in 
fMRI3,9,10 was not immediately present. Rather, in the first 300 ms 
following stimulus onset, only false fonts and infrequent letters were 
sharply distinguished from other stimuli. It is only in a later time 
window, starting around 300 ms or more, that stimuli with frequent 
bigrams, quadrigrams and real words separate in the brain (Fig. 3). 
This suggests that the fMRI signals observed by Vinckier et al. were 
mostly due to a late, and presumably top-down, stage of processing.
It is possible that small regions sensitive to letter bigrams could 
have been missed by intra-cranial sampling. At present, however, the 
minimal hypothesis that agrees with the current data is that, during 
bottom-up processing, a location-specific representation of letters, 
sensitive to word length, is directly followed by a lexical represen-
tation of the recognized word, sensitive only to word frequency, 
as postulated in spatial-coding models and in accordance with a 
few other magnetoencephalography and intra-cranial studies56,57. 
Following this bottom-up stage, visual areas would be expected to 
receive top-down feedback. For pseudoword stimuli, this feedback 
would be proportional to how close the stimuli are to existing items 
in the lexicon, that is, the extent to which they approximate real 
words, thus explaining the gradient previously seen in fMRI9.
In this framework, efficient recognition of written words would 
be primarily on the basis of a fast, prelexical recognition of indi-
vidual letters. During reading acquisition, frequent letters would 
become more efficiently coded in occipital and occipitotemporal 
cortices, as suggested by several fMRI studies58–60. This proposal is 
compatible with a recent psychophysical study which evaluated the 
impact of literacy on the perception of letters and their combina-
tions61. The results suggested that reading acquisition is not nec-
essarily accompanied by a growing sensitivity to frequent bigrams, 
but by an improved coding of individual letters and their precise 
locations, thus reducing the interactions between nearby letters61,62.
The spatiotemporal resolution of intra-cranial recordings pro-
vides unparalleled insights into reading processes, unobtainable 
via other means. Furthermore, fMRI measures of haemodynamic 
responses in the vicinity of mid-fusiform cortex are prone to be 
degraded by susceptibility artefacts63,64. These features may also 
explain the novelty of our findings relative to the functional imag-
ing literature.
While the involvement of mid-fusiform in aspects of both 
sub-lexical and lexical processing in reading is reasonably unam-
biguous, the specificity of this region to orthographic input needs 
more study, perhaps at scales smaller than afforded by the elec-
trodes used here. We have previously shown that left mid-fusiform 
cortex is a critical lexical hub for both visually and auditory cued 
naming25,33, and these data imply that it is in fact a multi-modal lexi-
cal hub whose role includes encoding orthographic information. 
However, as we show here, stimulation38,39 or lesioning35–37 of the 
mid-fusiform can lead to selective disruption of orthographic nam-
ing, potentially suggesting separable orthographic-specific regions 
in the mid-fusiform. This could also be interpreted as there being 
a lack of redundant processing pathways for written language as 
compared with other domains, resulting in orthographic process-
ing being more susceptible to disruption. It is generally accepted 
that CSM is the gold-standard method of causally testing the behav-
ioural correlates of a cortical region. Effects of cortical stimulation 
are strongest locally around the stimulating electrode pair, however, 
a potential limitation of this assumption is the possibility of pro-
ducing non-local effects by propagation of the applied current via 
functional pathways65.
In summary, we have demonstrated a central role of the 
mid-fusiform cortex in the early processing of the statistics of 
lexical and sub-lexical information in visual word reading. We 
have characterized the activity of mid-fusiform cortex as being 
sensitive, in both amplitude and duration, to the frequencies of 
words in natural language. Further, we have shown the existence 
of an anterior-to-posterior spread of lexical information from 
mid-fusiform to earlier visual regions including classical VWFA.
Methods
Participants. A total of 35 participants (17 male, 19–60 years, 5 left-handed, IQ 
94 ± 13, age of epilepsy onset 19 ± 10 years) took part in the intra-cranial recording 
experiments after written informed consent was obtained. All experimental 
procedures were reviewed and approved by the Committee for the Protection 
of Human Subjects (CPHS) of the University of Texas Health Science Center at 
Houston as protocol number HSC-MS-06-0385. Inclusion criteria for this study 
were that the participants were English native speakers, left hemisphere dominant 
for language and did not have significant additional neurological history (for 
example, previous resections, MR imaging abnormalities such as malformations or 
hypoplasia). Three additional participants were tested but later excluded from the 
main analysis as they were determined to be right hemisphere language dominant. 
Hemispheric dominance for language was determined by either fMRI activation 
(n = 1) or intra-carotid sodium amobarbital injection (n = 2). Given that electrode 
placement in these participants was for clinical need rather than experimental 
purposes, no statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but the 
number of participants required was based on providing adequate coverage of 
the areas being studied, greater than that in previous comparable studies25,34,38,56. 
Two additional participants (both female) were recruited post hoc for cortical 
stimulation mapping in their language dominant hemisphere (as confirmed by 
intra-carotid sodium amobarbital injection), on the basis of the findings of the 
main analysis. Permission was obtained from participants for whom identifiable 
images are presented.
Electrode implantation and data recording. Data were acquired from either 
subdural grid electrodes (SDEs; 7 participants) or stereotactically placed depth

electrodes (sEEGs; 28 participants) implanted for clinical purposes of seizure 
localization of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy. SDEs were subdural platinum-iridium 
electrodes embedded in a silicone elastomer sheet (PMT Corporation; top-hat 
design; 3 mm diameter cortical contact) and were surgically implanted via a 
craniotomy following previously described methods66–68. sEEG probes (PMT 
Corporation) were 0.8 mm in diameter, had 8–16 contacts and were implanted 
using a Robotic Surgical Assistant (ROSA; Medtech)69,70. Each contact was a 
platinum-iridium cylinder, 2.0 mm in length with a centre-to-centre separation of 
3.5–4.43 mm. Each participant had multiple (12–20) probes implanted.
Following implantation, electrodes were localized by co-registration of 
pre-operative anatomical 3 T MRI and post-operative CT scans using a cost 
function in AFNI71. Electrode positions were projected onto a cortical surface 
model generated in FreeSurfer72, and displayed on the cortical surface model for 
visualization68.
Intra-cranial data were collected using the NeuroPort recording system 
(Blackrock Microsystems), digitized at 2 kHz. They were imported into MATLAB 
initially referenced to the white matter channel used as a reference by the clinical 
acquisition system, visually inspected for line noise, artefacts and epileptic activity. 
Electrodes with excessive line noise or localized to sites of seizure onset were 
excluded. Each electrode was re-referenced offline to the common average of 
the remaining channels. Trials contaminated by inter-ictal epileptic spikes were 
discarded.
Stimuli and experimental design. Twenty-seven participants undertook a task 
passively viewing orthographic stimuli, and 28 participants undertook a rapid 
serial visual presentation (RSVP) sentence reading task, reading real sentences, 
Jabberwocky sentences and word lists. Two additional participants undertook 
a word and pseudoword reading task and later underwent cortical stimulation 
mapping.
All stimuli were displayed on a 15.4 inch 2,880 × 1,800 LCD screen  
positioned at eye level at a distance of 80 cm and presented using Psychtoolbox73  
in MATLAB.
Orthographic passive viewing. Participants were presented with 80 runs, each 
six stimuli in length and containing one six-character stimulus from each of six 
categories in a pseudorandom order. Stimulus categories, in increasing order of 
sub-lexical structure, were (1) false font strings, (2) infrequent letters, (3) frequent 
letters, (4) frequent bigrams, (5) frequent quadrigrams and (6) words (Fig. 1a). 
n-Gram frequencies were calculated from the English Lexicon Project74. False fonts 
used a custom-designed pseudofont with fixed character spacing. Each letter was 
replaced by an unfamiliar shape with an almost equal number of strokes and angles 
and similar overall visual appearance. The stimuli were based on a previous study9, 
converted for American English readers.
A 1,500 ms fixation cross was presented between each run. During each run, 
each stimulus was presented for 250 ms followed by a blank screen for 500 ms. 
Stimuli were presented in all capital letters in Arial font with a height of 150 pixels. 
To maintain attention, participants were asked to press a button on seeing a target 
string of ‘######’ presented. The target stimulus was inserted randomly into 20 
runs as an additional stimulus and was excluded from analysis. The detection rate 
of the target stimuli was 91 ± 10 %.
Sentence reading. Participants were presented with eight-word sentences using an 
RSVP format (Fig. 1c). A 1,000 ms fixation cross was presented followed by each 
word presented one at a time, each for 500 ms. Words were presented in all capital 
letters, in Arial font with a height of 150 pixels. To maintain the participants’ 
attention, after each sentence they were presented with a two-alternative forced 
choice, deciding which of two presented words was present in the preceding 
sentence, responding via a key press. Only trials with a correct response were used 
for analysis. Overall performance in this task was 92 ± 4%, with a response time of 
2,142 ± 782 ms.
Stimuli were presented in blocks containing 40 real sentences, 20 Jabberwocky 
sentences and 20 word lists in a pseudorandom order. Each participant completed 
between two and four blocks.
Word choice was based on stimuli used for a previous study75. Jabberwocky 
words were selected as pronounceable pseudowords, designed to fill the syntactic 
role of nouns, verbs and adjectives by inclusion of relevant functional morphemes.
Single word reading. Participants were presented with monosyllabic words or 
pseudowords and were asked to read them aloud. Each word was presented 
for 1,500 ms with a 2,000 ms inter-word fixation cross presented. Words were 
presented in all lower-case letters, in Arial font with a height of 150 pixels. Stimuli 
were presented in two blocks, each containing 40 real words and 40 pseudowords.
Cortical stimulation mapping. Trains of 50 Hz balanced 0.3-ms-period square 
waves were delivered to adjacent electrodes for 3–5 s during the task66. Stimulation 
was applied using a Nihon Kohden PE-210A stimulator. At each electrode pair, 
stimulation was begun at a current of 2 mA and increased stepwise by 1–2 mA 
until either an overt phenomenon was observed, after-discharges were induced or 
the 10-mA limit was reached. Positive pairs were identified as sites that repeatably 
resulted in reading arrest while reading standard passages (that is, the ‘Grandfather’ 
and ‘Rainbow’ passages).
Signal analysis. A total of 5,666 electrode contacts were implanted, 891 of which 
were excluded from analysis due to proximity to the seizure onset zone, excessive 
inter-ictal spikes or line noise.
Electrode-level analysis was limited to a region of interest (ROI) based on a 
brain parcellation from the Human Connectome Project76. The ROI encompassed 
the entire occipital lobe and most of the ventral temporal surface, excluding 
parahippocampal and entorhinal regions (Fig. 2b).
Analyses were performed by first bandpass filtering raw data of each electrode 
into broadband gamma activity (BGA; 70–150 Hz) following removal of line noise 
(zero-phase second-order Butterworth bandstop filters). A frequency-domain 
bandpass Hilbert transform (paired sigmoid flanks with half-width of 1.5 Hz) was 
applied, and the analytic amplitude was smoothed (Savitzky–Golay finite impulse 
response, third order, frame length of 151 ms; MATLAB 2017a, Mathworks). BGA 
is presented here as percentage change from baseline level, defined as the period 
−500 to −100 ms before each run in the passive viewing task or before word 1 of 
each sentence.
Electrodes were tested to determine whether they were word responsive 
within the window 100–400 ms post stimulus onset, a time window previously 
used for determining selectivity of vOTC24. This was done by measuring the 
response to real words in the passive viewing task, or all words in word position 
1 in sentence reading. The responsiveness threshold was set at 20% amplitude 
increase above baseline with P < 0.01 (one-tailed z test). For the passive viewing 
and sentence reading tasks, 601 and 459 electrodes were respectively located in left, 
language-dominant vOTC, of which 207 and 196 (in 20 participants each) were 
word responsive (Fig. 2b).
When presented as grouped electrode response plots, within-participant 
averages were taken of all electrodes within each ROI then presented as the 
across-participant average, with coloured patches representing ±1 standard error.
Linguistic analysis. When separating content and function words, function 
words were defined as either articles, pronouns, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, 
prepositions or particles. We quantified word frequency as the base-10 log  
of the SUBTLEXus frequency27. This resulted in a frequency of 1 meaning 10 
instances per million words and 4 meaning 10,000 instances per million words. 
Bigram frequency was calculated as the mean frequency of each adjacent 
two-letter pair, as calculated from the English Lexicon Project74. Orthographic 
neighbourhood was quantified as the orthographic Levenshtein distance (OLD20): 
the mean number of single character edits required to convert the word into its 20 
nearest neighbours77.
Statistical modelling. Word selectivity. The onset time of word selectivity within 
individual electrodes was defined as the first time point where the d prime of word 
versus all non-word stimuli became significant (P < 0.01 for at least 50 ms). The 
significance threshold was determined by bootstrapping with randomly assigned 
category labels, using 1,000 repetitions.
Non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF). NNMF is an unsupervised  
clustering algorithm78. This method expresses a non-negative matrix A as the 
product of a ‘class weight’ matrix W and ‘class archetype’ matrix H, minimizing 
||A – WH|| (ref. 2).
The factorization rank k = 2 was chosen for all analyses in this work. Repeat 
analyses with higher ranks did not identify additional response types. Inputs to the 
factorization were d prime values (Fig. 5a) or z scores (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data 
Fig. 4a) that were half-wave rectified. These were calculated for the m electrodes 
at n time points for the temporal analyses. Factorization generated a pair of class 
weights for each electrode and a pair of class archetypes—the basis function for 
each class. Component ratio was defined as the magnitude normalized ratio 
between the class weights at each electrode. Magnitude was defined as the sum of 
class weights at each electrode.
Surface-based mixed-effects multilevel analysis (SB-MEMA). SB-MEMA was used 
to provide statistically robust28–30 and topologically precise25,31–33 effect estimates 
of band-limited power change from the baseline period. This method, developed 
and described previously by our group79,80, accounts for sparse sampling, outlier 
inferences and intra- and inter-participant variability to produce population maps 
of cortical activity. Significance levels were computed at a corrected alpha level 
of 0.01 using family-wise error rate corrections for multiple comparisons. The 
minimum criterion for family-wise error rates was determined by white-noise 
clustering analysis (Monte Carlo simulations, 1,000 iterations) of data with the 
same dimension and smoothness as those analyzed80. All maps were smoothed 
with a geodesic Gaussian smoothing filter (3 mm full-width at half-maximum) for 
visual presentation.
Amplitude normalized maps were created by normalizing to the beta (β) 
values of an activation mask. The activation mask comprised significant activation 
clusters satisfying the following conditions: corrected P < 0.01, β >10% and 
coverage >2 participants.

To produce the activation movies, SB-MEMA was computed on short, 
overlapping time windows (150 ms width, 10 ms spacing), generating individual 
frames of cortical activity.
Linear mixed effects (LME) modelling. For grouped electrode statistical tests, a 
linear mixed effects model was used. LME models are an extension to multiple 
linear regression, incorporating fixed effects for fixed experimental variables and 
random effects for uncontrolled variables. The fixed effects in our model were 
word length and word frequency, and our random effect was the participant. Word 
length was the number of letters in each word. This variable was mean-centred to 
avoid an intercept at an unattainable value: a zero-letter word. Word frequency  
was converted to an ordinal variable to facilitate combination across participants. 
The ordinal categories for frequency (f) were very high (f > 3.5), high (2.5 < f ≤ 3.5),  
mid (1.5 < f ≤ 2.5), low (0.5 < f ≤ 1.5) and very low (f ≤ 0.5). The random effect 
of participant allowed a random intercept for each participant to account for 
differences in mean response size between participants.
These predictors were used to model the average BGA in the window 
100–400 ms after word onset. Word responses within each length/frequency 
combination were averaged within participant. Participants only contributed 
responses to length/frequency combinations for which they had at least five word 
epochs to be averaged together.
For single electrode analysis of the frequency effect, a multiple linear regression 
was used. Factors word length and word frequency were again used. Word length 
was again mean-centred. Word frequency was treated as a continuous variable. 
For this analysis, all the word epochs from the sentence and word list conditions 
were used. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons using a Benjamini–
Hochberg false detection rate (FDR) threshold of q < 0.05.
Temporal effects of length and frequency on cortical activity were tested using 
the LME model with 25 ms, non-overlapping windows. Significance was accepted 
at an FDR corrected threshold of q < 0.01.
For statistical comparisons, data were assumed to be normal in distribution. 
Given the distinct experimental conditions, data collection and analysis could not 
reasonably be performed in a manner blinded to the conditions of the experiments.

Field-specific reporting
Please select the one below that is the best fit for your research. If you are not sure, read the appropriate sections before making your selection.
Life sciences
Behavioural & social sciences
 Ecological, evolutionary & environmental sciences
For a reference copy of the document with all sections, see nature.com/documents/nr-reporting-summary-flat.pdf
Life sciences study design
All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.
Sample size
Given electrode placement in these patients was for clinical need rather than experimental purposes, the number of patients required was 
based on providing adequate coverage of the areas being studied, based on previous comparable studies.
Data exclusions
Inclusion criteria for this study were that the participants were English native speakers, left hemisphere dominant for language and did not 
have a significant additional neurological history (e.g. previous resections, MR imaging abnormalities such as malformations or hypoplasia). 
Three participants were tested but were later excluded from the main analysis as they were determined to be right hemisphere language 
dominant. 
Replication
Alongside population level effects in our patient cohort, in patients with sufficient coverage, we confirmed these effects within individual 
patients.
Randomization
Patients were not assigned into experimental groups. Electrodes were grouped based on a brain parcellation from the Human Connectome 
Project.
Blinding
Blinding of experimenters was not possible for this study.
Reporting for specific materials, systems and methods
We require information from authors about some types of materials, experimental systems and methods used in many studies. Here, indicate whether each material,

Population characteristics
35 participants (17 male, 19-60 years, 5 left-handed, IQ 94 +/- 13, age of epilepsy onset 19 +/- 10 years) took part in the 
intracranial recording experiments after written informed consent was obtained. Two additional participants (both female) 
were recruited for cortical stimulation mapping in their language dominant hemisphere. All participants were semi-
chronically implanted with intracranial electrodes for the clinical purposes of seizure localization of pharmaco-resistant 
epilepsy. 
Recruitment
Participants were recruited from the pool of patients scheduled to undergo intracranial monitoring at the Texas 
Comprehensive Epilepsy Program.
Ethics oversight
