Pretace to the Second Edition
The first edition of this book has been out of print for seven years. The ques-
tion as to whether a new edition should be produced was answered affirmatively
on many counts. I think that the considerations which led me to write this book
in 1949 are still valid (see Preface to the First Edition). Moreover, a description
of those areas of interest which together comprise the field of Mineralogy seems
to be more necessary than ever, because of the rapid advances which have been
made.
Due to the rapid extension of our knowledge, I did not dare again to treat
the whole field by myself. Accordingly, Professor ZEMANN kindly agreed to
revise the first part of the book dealing with Crystallography. He made many
important corrections.
In Part H the basic question arose as to whether the physical-chemioal
approach to rock forming processes, becoming more and more important, required
inclusive treatment of the fundamentals of physical chemistry in the book. I see
certain dangers in trying to produce a petrology text which is physical chemically
self-sufficient. Thus, I retain the same opinion which prevailed when I wrote the
previous edition; namely that the necessary basic knowledge should be acquired
in lectures and laboratory classes in physics, chemistry, and physical chemistry,
and with the help of standard literature dealing with these subjects. This back-
ground is, therefore, presumed and fundamentals are only referred to occasionally.
In considering which of the new data and areas of interest to include, I at-
tempted to keep in mind the introductory nature of the text and to select that
which seemed of fundamental importance for a student in his scientific work .
Thus, I deleted old material as well as adding new, in bringing the subject matter
up-to-date. Important additions were made particularly in sections dealing with
volatile constituents, metamorphic facies,
and isotope geochemistry. These
changes resulted in no significantnet change in the size of the volume.
The appended tables have been rearranged, particularly in the case of sedi-
mentary and metamorphic rocks. Here the reader may locate detailed data which
could not be mentioned in the text. In particular this gives the reader the oppor-
tunity to familiarize himself with the variability of natural rocks, in contrast
to the simplified diagrams presented for comprehensive survey. I am indebted
to Professor KORITNIG for compiling again and revising the mineral tables. Along
with the tabulated rock data, they are an important supplement to the text.
Professor WEDEPOHL kindly read the proof for Part H. Dr. SMYKATz-KLoss
compiled the indices. I am grateful to both of them for this valuable assistance.
My wife did most of the writing for me and assisted in reading proof.

Preface to the First Edition
To write an introductory text covering the entire field of mineralogy, including
crystallography, petrology, and ore deposits, may seem presumptuous to many
today. The fact that the author has taught this subject regularly through lectures
and Iaboratories for 22 years is not in itself sufficient reason in his view. The
motivation to do so arose out of the necessity to provide for students of this
science and sister sciences 80 single useful and comprehensive book. Previous
texts have been designed with subjects selected to conform to the courses taught
at German Universities. It is questionable whether this limitation is still or ever
was fortunate. Boundaries between the natural sciences have developed histori-
cally and should be maintained, in my opinion, only 80S practicality dictates, such
80S in teaching. Each science is so intimately linked with its sister science that
boundaries tend to disappear. It is known that interdisciplinary approaches
frequently promote particularly successful research. Thus, also in the field of
mineralogy, the influence of the allied sciences has been of great importance. This
is particularly true of the influence of mathematics and physics on crystaIlo-
graphy and of geology on petrology. The changing emphasis on the one or the
other branches of our science, however, has not always been beneficiaI. For
example, it has resulted in judgments such 80S the following, attributed to the
renowned mineralogist A. G. WERNER, relative to HAÜY, one of the founders of
crystallography. The far-sighted geologist L. VON BUCH says in 80letter of May 17,
1804 to D. G. L. KARSTEN : "No, I do not agree with WERNER'S judgment of
HAÜY. He says he is no mineralogist." This book, on the other hand, attempts
to prove that crystallography, especially in its recent developments, is an in-
dispensible prerequisite to petrology, and conversely, the problems of petrology
offer many stimuli to crystallography. Important supporting sciences, in addition
to the examples already given, are chemistry and physical chemistry. Biology
is an important allied science to sedimentary petrology. Similarly, mineralogy
plays 80 role among allied sciences, supporting them 80S weIl. I do not deny that
it is not always easy for students of sister sciences or beginners to enter the field
of mineralogy. Practical teaching experience suggests several reasons why this is
so. Overstressing formal principles in crystallography, along with the great
number of technical terms, are probably the greatest obstacles. A certain amount
of knowledge of crystal forms is, in my opinion, indispensible and should be
acquired like the formula-Ianguage of the chemists. I have tried to keep within
bounds in this respect. The number of really necessary mineral and rock names
is small, certainly when compared to the profusion of specific names in the
biological sciences.
On the other hand, former 80Sweil 80Sliving authors have continued to formulate
new technical terms, mostly derived from the Greek, and these have been con-
tinuously introduced into later publications. I did not see it to be my task to
increase the quantity of technical terms or to replace existing ones by new ones.
I have tried to explain the most frequently used terms and, moreover, to use 80S
often 80S possible the terminology of the allied sciences.

VI
Preface to the First Edition
In this way the book attempts to lead to an understanding of mineralogy,
but is not intended to replace a systematic textbook. My first aim was to provide
the fundamentals for a genetic consideration of crystals and rocks. In order to
provide space to deal with these questions, much information is presented as
tables in the appendix. I believe that the 300 minerals (522mineral names) will
be sufficient for the ordinary student and that the 93 rock types give him a
sufficient survey of variety.
The book results from the generallectures I have given since 1927 in Rostock
and Göttingen. In the literature index I have specified the sources of illustrations
and some statements, but many suggestions by others may have been forgotten
in the course of years. Results of my own investigation and reflection, which
would have been published separately in normal times, have also been incor-
porated. The diagrams of the 32 crystal clasaes are drawn according to NIGGLI.
The crystal structures, unless otherwise specified, have been taken from the
Strukturbericht. I owe thanks for much asaistance to the former and present
members of the Institutes in Rostock and Göttingen. In particular, the crystal
drawings were, for the most part, drawn anew by Mr. WALTER SCHERF, and
some by Dr.1. MEGGENDORFER, who also made the microscopic illustrations
using the Edinger drawing apparatus. She also drew the diagrams of elose-
packed spheres as weIl as some others. Dr. K . JASMUND provided the Figs. 230,
233-235, 277, and 350. Professor KORITNIG compiled the mineral tables and
Dr. P. SCHNEIDERHÖHN the subject index. Both assisted in reading proof.
Foreign literature, as far as it was attainable at the end of 1947, was taken
into consideration. Some references were added even during the correction of
proofs.

1. Introduction
We are all familiar with the subdivision of the natural world into th e plant,
animal, and mineral kingdoms. Of these the realm of minerals is the study and
research area of mineralogy. A mineralogist uses the word mineral, however,
in a much more restricted sense than prevails with common usage. If we examine
a rock rather closely, we notiee, for example, that a sandstone is composed of
individual quartz grains. When we examine a specimen of granite, we ean recog-
inze feldspar, dark mica, and perhaps also hornblende, in addition to quartz.
From a specimen of certain ores, galena, ehalcopyrite, and sphalerite all shine
forth brilliantly. Any such individual rock constituent is a mineral. Mineralogy
encompasses the study of these minerals and the manner in which they oceur ,
and includ es the properties of all rock materials, which, in the sense used here,
embrace ore and salt deposits, as weIl as other useful mineral deposits.
Minerals occur as eonstituents of rocks not only in assemblage, but are found
also as separate individuals. Frequently these have the opportunity to develop
without restrietion in eavities or in surrounding media which could yield to their
growth. Under these conditions they often develop into polyhedral form s called
crystals. These have from time immemorial attracted the attention of thoughtful
natural scientists as weIl as laymen.
Earlier all natural bodies with planar external boundaries were called crystals.
For example, A. G. WERNER, the patriarch of mineralogy, considered that basalt
columns were crystals, because of their somewhat polyhedral shape. Today the
concept of a crystal and a mineral is restrieted to a homoqeneous body, that is,
one composed of only one substance. Basalt columns, which are composed of
feldspar, augite, and other minerals, are not crystals in the modern sense. In
addition we know now that the regular outer form or morphology of a crystal
is neither the unique nor truly diagnostic eharacteristic of the crystalline state .
It is the regularity of the internal strueture which determines the unique
characteristics of crystalline matter. As this knowledge developed during the
last century, it was further recognized that almost all solid bodies are erystalline.
Since the earlier studies of crystals involved almost exclusively natural produets,
minerals, the study of crystals developed as a bran ch of mineralogy.
The regular internal structure of crystals determines their external geometrie
form and is also manifest by other phenomena. If , for example, we strike a piece
of galena or rock salt, it always breaks along planes parallel to the surfaces of
a eube. The mineral hornblende on the other hand breaks or cleaves into four-
sided prismatic forms with prism angles of 124 and 56°. A property common
to many minerals is exemplified by kyanite, which also occurs as prismatic
crystals. Kyanite can be scratched with a steel needle in the direction of elongation
of the prism, but not perpendi cular to it . Another interesting mineral is cordierite ,
a magnesium aluminium silicate named after the French mineralogist CORDIER.
If a cube is cut from a cordierite crystal in the proper orientation and viewed
in each of the three perpendicular direetions corresponding to the cube edges,
1·

it will be noticed that the color is different in each direction, namely blue, lilac,
and yellow. Directional dependence of color has been established for many other
minerals also. If in addition we investigate the heat conductivity of quartz, we
can ascertain that it is about 40% greater in the direction parallel to a prism
edge, than perpendicular to it. This difference can be demonstrated very nicely
also in the case of gypsum. If a cleavage fragment is coated with wax or paraffin
and then probed with a hot needle, the wax melts around the source of the heat
clearly in the form of an ellipse, not a circle.
All of these observations lead to the conclusion that crystals are bodies for
which many properties, such as external shape, cleavage, color, hardness, and
heat conductivity, are dependent upon direction. This directional dependency
of geometrical and physical properties is called anisotropism (Greek. iso, equal;
tropos, direction; an , neg .), It is characteristic of every kind of crystal. Orystals
of very high symmetry show no directional dependence for certain physical
properties, such as the transmission of light, and are said to be isotropic. With
respect to other properties, such as tensile strength, the same crystal may be
anisotropie. Orystals are, therefore, first of all homogeneous substances, and
secondly they are anisotropic.
Very long ago the recognition of the directional dependence of properties
led to attempts at an explanation. The idea finally evolved that crystals were
constructed of tiny building blocks. Thus the Hollander, OHR. HUYGENS in 1678
explained the cleavability, the directional variation in hardness, and the double
refraction of calcite, in terms of an arrangement and orderly grouping together
of very small and invisible flattened ellipsoidal units. In Sweden TORBERN
BERGMANN (1773) and in France RENEE JUST HAÜY (1782) introduced the
concept of "integrating molecules", of building blocks, whose shapes should
correspond to the shapes of cleavage fragments of crystals. As early as 1824,
SEEBER, in Freiburg i. Br., formulated a concept of the arrangement of points
in space quite similar to that which prevails today. So we see that the fundamental
property of a crystal, its directional nonequivalence, has led from the very
beginning directly to a concept of orderly arranged building units.
For some time mathematicians, mineralogists, and physicists have been
concerned with theoretical investigation of such regular repetitive arrangements.
As early as 1891 the mineralogist FEDOROV in Petersburg and independently
the mathematician SCHÖNFLIESS in Koenigsberg proved that there are only 230
symmetrically different ways of arranging points in space. These regular spatial
arrangements are called space groups. Since 1912 it has been possible to investigate
these space groups experimentally, thanks to the discovery by MAX VON LAUE
of X-ray interference by crystals. This discovery has been of the greatest signif-
icance to crystal science. It has been learned since that the "centers of gravity"
of atoms, or ions and molecules, actually confrom to regular point group arrange-
ments. Their spatial relationships can be measured. The interatomic distances
are of the order of magnitude of 1 Angstrom (10-8 cm = 1/100,000,000 cm).
Discussion of the methods of measurement will be reserved for a later chapter.
Weshall next familiarize ourselves with space lattice relationships.
A disordered array of points also shows different relationships in different
directions, but only as long as we consider a region of few points within the total
array. If we integrate some property over long distances in the disordered point
system, we will encounter like conditions in all directions. The situation is quite
different in ordered point systems. It can be rather easily demonstrated that
there is no arrangement of points in space whose regular and periodie spacings
do not vary with direction. This would appear to be inconsistent with the concept

of isotropism. Isotropism arises only statistically as the result of integration of
some property over long distances in a point array. The separation of lattice
particles from one another is so small, that over large distances we obtain only
average values with the usual methods of measuring properties. For example,
a gas in which particles are constantly in motion is isotropie, as is a fluid or a
glass, which is a fluid solidified as a result of supereooling. Such incompletely
ordered matter in the solid state is said
to be amorphous because it possesses no
tendency toward development of a char-
acteristic form. The most important char-
acteristic of a crystal, on the other hand,
is its regular atomic arrangement in space.
Thus the directional dependence of crys-
talline properties can be understood.
A planar net or lattice is shown in Fig. 1. Along any particular set of parallel
lattice lines , points are distributed periodically. In different directions the spacing
of points differs. The arrangement is anisotropie.
What can we say about the homogeneity of such lattices ? As far as th e small
portion in Fig. 1 is concerned, the structure is discontinuous, not homogeneous.

A point array becomes homogeneous if we consider larger expanses of an unlimited,
extended array: that is to say, when each point possesses an infinitely large
number of corresponding or equivalent points in the extended arrangement
(B ARLow,1888). We can mark off a repetition of points in a straight line giving
rows. We can project these linear patterns within a plane creating planar point
nets, and finally we can stack and build these together in space produ cing a
space lattice. The only pre-requisite for real homogeneity is that the structure
be regular. The structural units are repeated periodically. Space lattices conform,

therefore, not only to the property of anisotropism, but also to that of genuine
homogeneity. Crystals possess a corresponding atomic arrangement.
An amorphous body also possesses a sort of homogeneity. Like isotropism,
it is in this case statistically related. In a disordered array the eonstituent partieles
are on the average similarly surrounded. In contrast to this statistical homo-
geneity, crystals have a three-dimensional periodic homogeneity to their space
lattices. Only that matter which possesses such aspace lattice is denoted as
crystalline in this restricted sense. The deviations of real crystals from this
ideally ordered state will be dealt with later in the section on crystal chemistry.
Here let us refer only to the so-called "fluid crystals", which are constructed
from one- and two-dimensional molecular arrangements. They form a sort of
transition to crystals and for that reason are also considered as mesophasee
(Greek ; mesos, medium). Fig.2a-e illustrates the arrangement possibilities of
rod-shaped particles, ranging from the completely disordered to the crystalline
state. Here it is assumed that the rods are perfect cylinders. Departure from this
ideal shape would lead to different arrangement possibilities.
2. Descriptive Crystallography
Law 01 Constancy 01 Interfacial Angles. We shall be concerned above all in
the following sections with ideal crystals. Before we discuss the existing arrange-
ment possibilities, we must familiarize ourselves with the terminology and the
most elementary aids to crystal description. These have been developed for
macroscopic crystals with face development. The faces of a crystal correspond
to some planar net in the space lattice. From this fundamental fact we can
deduce directly the first and oldest law of crystal science: the angles between
the existing faces of like kinds of crystals are under like external conditions
(temperature, pressure) always the same. Today it is self-evident to us that the
angle between two planar nets of identical space lattices will always be the same,
and that for a particular structure it does not matter if we displace a lattice
plane parallel to itself. However, when the Danish scientist NIELS STENSEN
(latinized to NICOLAUS STENO) in 1669 found that identical faces on quartz
erystals always included the identical angle , it was no foregone conclusion but
an important achievement, providing a clue to further understanding. This law
signifies that only the angles between faces are important, not the relative sizes
of the faees. If we observe a collection of quartz crystals from different localities,
it is easy to surmise the difficulty in discovering that they have in eommon
equal angles between corresponding faces (Fig. 3). In 1783 ROME DE L'IsLE first
established the law of eonstancy of interfacial angles as a generally valid law,
applying to all crystals.
Angular Measurement. By measuring the interfaeial angles on crystals it was
possible to reconstruct the ideal form of a erystal from the often very distorted
natural crystal, and then to reveal the conformity of crystal development to
fundamental principles. This led to further development of erystal scienee and
finally to reeognition of the coneept of spaee lattiees. STENSEN'S discovery
initiated a long series of angular measurements of crystals. These have been
continued up to the present time, even though today they are eonsidered by
some to be of less importance than X-ray methods. At first, simple deviees held
in eontaet with a crystal were used for angular measurement (contact gonio-
meter). Since the beginning of the 19th century (WOLLASTON, 1809), optical
apparatus, the rejlecüon. goniometer, has come into use. With this the erystal

is mounted so that an edge or several parallel edges stand vertical. The crystal
is illuminated with a collimated light beam. When the crystal is rotated about
the external facial angle
IX (Fig.4), a light reflection (signal) is observed each
time in the viewing telescope.
The "external" face angle which is measured is equal to the angle which the
face normals make with each other. These relations are readily apparent in Fig. 4.
AB and AF (A B' and AF' after rotation) each represent the outline of one
crystal face of a hexagonal prism. H B' and K B' are the face normals. With a
contact goniometer the "internaI" angle
q; is measured
(IX+ q; = 180°). With
the original one-circle goniometer, it was necessary to remount and adjust the
Fig.5. Two-circle reflect ion goniometer after V. GOLDSCHMIDT by
STOE, Heidelberg. One
graduated circle stands vertical, the other horizontal; both are read by magnüiers
crystal each time in order to measure angles between faces whose edges were
not parallel. The modern two-circle goniometer avoids this inconvenience. All
face normal angles can be ascertained with a single setting, since the two
graduated circles are mounted perpendicular to each other and can be moved
independently (Fig. 5).
Axial Intercepts and Indices. We come now to the description or naming of
crystallographic faces and edges (planes and directions). In crystallography, as
in geometry, a plane can be referred to a system of coordinate axes. When
dealing with space lattices, three lattice lines are chosen as coordinate axes. For
the general case, the plane cuts the three axes at different distances from the
origin.
The axial intercepts of a plane A Be shown in Fig.6 are indicated by the
distances OA, OB, and oe. A different plane will cut off other segments of the
axes ; for example, OA', OB', oe'. Let us choose one plane as the fundamental
or unit plane, and assign values of unity to each of its three intercepts ; for
example, plane A Be. Since the intercepts of our unit plane are now 1, 1, 1, a

second plane A' B' 0 ' will have the intercepts 4, 2, 2. In this notation (4, 2, 2) the
first numeral represents the intercept of the forward projecting axis, the a-axis;
the second numeral, the b-axis, projecting from left to right ; the third numeral,
the c-axis, projecting vertically. To describe the position of the intercept, ratios

are used . We may therefore translate planes, as long as we do not change the
intercept ratios. That is, we can make the intercepts indivisible by a common
denominator, writing them in the case of plane A' B' 0' as (2, I, I) instead of (4, 2,2)
The equation [or a plane in space can be used instead of intercepts to define
a plane:

Similarly it folIows : 0 B = 1/k, 00= 1/1. That is, the intercepts are the reci-
procals of the factors of the equation.
A third possibility for describing the position of a plane in space is by stating
its angular relationships, in terms of the angle between each of the coordinate
axes and the perpendicular from the origin to the plane. The perpendicular is
the plane normal. Angular measurements with the reflection goniometer give
the angles between these plane normals directly. The angles, 1fJ', 1fJ", 1fJ'" between
the normals and the coordinate axes , as Fig. 7 shows, are related to the axial
intercepts and the normal 0 P = d as folIows:

These relationships are used to calculate the axial intercepts of the fundamen-
tal or unit plane. In the case of mutually perpendicular (orthogonal) coordinate
axes, cos2 1fJ' + cos'' 1fJ"+ cos2 1fJ'"= 1.
In this manner, as in the case of the equation for a plane, we end up again
with reciprocal values of the intercepts. Following the suggestion of MILLER
(1839), we generally use today these reciproca l values of the intercepts for
plane and crystal description. As units of measure on the three axes, the axial
intercepts of the unit plane are always used. By multipli cation by a suitable
number h, k, 1can be made integers. These h, k, 1values are called Miller indices.
The indic es for plane ABO (Fig. 6) are t :t:t, Ill ; for A' B' O' t :t:-!' 122.
The indices in the octant discussed so far have positive values. In the other seven

Descriptive Crystallography
11
octants, some indices can be negative according to which axes are appropriately
intersected (see Fig. 6). The minus signs are placed above the index numerals.
Thus the indices of a plane can be represented, for example, as (122) read: one,
minus two, minus two. Planes parallel to an axis have the intercept 00 and the
index O. If the plane's position is only partially or not at all known, the letters
h, k, 1 are used. The indices of a single plane are enclosed in parentheses (Ill);
those for an entire set of planes, a form, in curved brackets, { }, for example {122}.
That plane which is to serve as the unit plane is determined by trial. A plane is
chosen, so that the indices of the entire collection of faces are as simple as possible.
In spite of many attempts, rigid rules for the choice of the unit plane have not
been satisfactorily formulated. If the space lattice is known, the plane consistent
with lattice measurements should be chosen.
Crystal Calculations. Weshall now calculate the indices of a crystal with the
help of angular eosine relationships. For this purpose we shall choose the barite
(BaS04) crystal shown in top view in Fig. 8, keeping in mind the relationships
described above. An oblique view of the same crystal is illustrated in Fig. 48, p. 28.
As our later discussion of symmetry will show, we can base the barite lattice on
an orthogonal coordinate system. We shall choose the direction of the edge
between planes 0 and c as the a axis, between 1and c as the b axis, and between
band m as the c axis. Therefore, the c axis is perpendicular to the plane of the
drawing and the plane c is indexed (001). The angle between planes c and 0 is
52°43'. Therefore, for 0 :
1p~ = 90°,
1p~' = 90° -52°43' = 37°17',
1p~" = 52°43'.
From the angle between face a, standing perpendicular to the plane of the
drawing, and m = 39°ll', it follows that for m :
1p:n = 39°ll',
1p;; = 50°49',
1p;;' = 90°;
similarly for Afrom a r; A= 22° 10' :

for d, from c/\d = 38°52' :
1p.i=51°8',
1p.i'=90°,
1p.i"=38°52'.
for u, from c r; u = 58°ll' :
1p~ = 31°49',
1p~' = 90°,
1p~" = 58°ll'.
For face z, we calculate, from a /\ z = 45°42' ;
1p; = 45°42'
from C/\ z = 64° 19';
1p;' = 64° 19'
From cos- 1p'+cos- 1p"+cos21p'" = I, it folIows : 1p;" = 55° 17'.
Similarly, for face r we find, from c/\r = 46°6' and b r; r = 62°55' :

1p;' = 62°55',

The indices of the individual faces are different, depending on whether the
face z, r, or y was chosen as the unit face. Since in all three cases the complexity
of the indices is approximately equal, it is possible to be in doubt as to which of
the three faces actually represents the unit face. For characterization of barite,
it suffices to select the axial ratio 0.8153 :1: 1.3138, based on the choice of z as
the unit face. However, the axial ratios based on lattice constants determined
by X-rays is doubled in the a axis direction : ao:bo:co= 1.627: I :1.311. Thus the y
face is consistent with the structurally determined unit plane.
Law 01Rational Indices. As can be seen from Table 1, the derived intercepts
and indices can be expressed as whole numbers, including 00 and O. As early as
the time of HAÜY it was recognized that the faces developed on crystals could
always be so simply indexed. A look at the space lattice shows us today that this
must be so, even though a century ago this was not self-evident. On the other
hand, HAÜY'S empirical studies did lead first to the postulation of such point
systems and finally to their discovery. As a general rule the intercept ratios and
MilIer indices can be represented as small whole numbers. This does not follow
directly from space lattice structure. In order to explain the frequency of faces
with low indices on crystals, it is necessary to postulate that there must be quite
simple structurally important relationships, which are favored in the develop-
ment of growth and cleavage faces. BRAVAIS proposed that the common simple
faces which develop on crystals contain particularly densely populated lattice
planes.
Zones. We have already utilized the edge boundaries of crystals in determining
axial directions. Wespeak of several faces whose edges are mutually parallel as
lying in a "zone". The common direction to which these edges are parallel is the
zone axis. The symbols representing edges or zones are placed in brackets [uvw].
Their derivation is ilIustrated in Fig . 9, where we have the edge d passing through
the origin of the coordinate system. The relation of the coordinates of some
point P to the axes is established, u :v:w= [uvw]. The intercepts of the unit
plane again serve as the units of measure on the a, b, and c axes. If the location

of two faces is known, their intersecting edge, a zone, is also fixed . It is possible
to calculate the zone symbols from the indices of two faces from the following
considerations :
The equation of a plane with the intercepts l /h, l /k , l /l is h x + ky+lz = 1
(compare with p. 20). If a plane is translated parallel to itself so that it is made
to pass through the origin, the
equation becomes
c
h x + k y +l x = O. Let us consider two planes with
the indices hl kill and h2k2l2; both are translated so
that each passes through the origin. The ratio of
the coordinates of some arbitrary point on the line
of intersection, the zone axis, gives the zone symbols
sought :
Fig. 9. Coordinates of
a zone
Conversely, two edges or zone axes determine the plane that lies between
them. The indices of the plane follow from th e two equations of planes (hkl) with
different zone symbols, U I VI WI and U 2V2W 2:
h :k :l =(vl · W 2-V2' WI): (WI · U2-
W 2' UI):(UI· V2- U2' VI ) '

In this case particular attention must be paid to the signs. One can obtain all
possible faces on a crystal by proceeding from four faces which do not, to three
which do lie in a zone and determining first from these the zone directions or
zone symbols of the edges lying between these faces ; from the zone directions
so obtained, possible new faces are denoted and from these new zones, etc . It is
a general rule that only those faces occur on a crystal which occur together in
zonal assemblages (zone law).
Axial Systems. The study of crystal edges allows us to choose coordinate
axes whose relations are quite simple. Study of many such crystals leads to the
conclusion that there are six unique axial systems. This was recognized in 1804
by CHR. S. WEISS in an introduction to the German translation of the work s of
H AÜY. In the case of three of these axial systems, the intercepts of the unit
plane are of different lengths along all three axes. In the case of the triclinie
system, none of the three axes intersect at right angles ; in the monoclinie, two
form right angles; and in the orthorhombic, all three are mutually perpendicular
or orthogonal. In all three systems, in order to uniquely charac terize a crystal,
the ratios of the axial intercepts of their unit faces a :b:c must be ascertained. In
order to define the triclinic coordinate axes, the angles between axes must be
defined also. The angle between the a and b axis is designated as y, that between
the band caxes as (x , and between the a and caxes as ß.The monoclinic coordinate

14
Crystal Mathematics
axes are oriented so that the general angle lies between the c- and a-axes, and is
thus ßI, in the monoclinic. For the so-called tetragonal system, two of the three
axial intercepts are equal and the axes are orthogonal. Only the c:a ratio must be
determined to characterize a tetragonal crystal.
The hexagonal coordinate system consists of one vertical axis (c axis) and three
additional axes, al , a2 , and a3 , perpendicular to it and intersecting each other at
120°. As shown in Fig. 10, the a3 axis (running forward and to the right) is con-
sidered to be negative. For this axis the general index i is assigned, while the other
axes, al and a2 , are given the indices hand k. The order of the assigned indices,
varying from alphabetical, is hkil, corresponding to the al , a2 , a3 and c axes
respectively. These four combined indices are called the Bravais indices. The
ratio c: a, therefore, suffices to characterize hexagonal crystals.
Fig. 10. Calculation of indices with hexagonal coordinates
Since only three axes are required to define a plane in space, i is related to
hand k and can be calculated from them. In Fig . 10 let ADE be the outline of a
plane and construct B D parallel to 0 E . Then A 0/A B = 0 E /B D. Since B D
=OD= -I/i, it follows, if we substitute the indices :
l/h
l/h + I/i
l/k
.
--=-i/i '
i= -(h+k).
The symbol i is assumed here to have a negative value, although the minussign
is not indicated. Although many authors use the indices hkil(i = h+ 1) for
hexagonal crystals, the symbol i is often replaced by an asterisk (hk*l).
Finally, in the case of the isometric system, the axial intercepts of the unit
face are equal and the three axes are orthogonal.
Occasionally another coordinate system is made use of, the rhombohedral.
As in the isometrie system, the three axes here are equal as are the interaxial
angles. However, they are not orthogonal as in the isometrie system, but inclined
at some general angle (! (see Appendix p. 350 and Fig . 391).
The Stereographie Projeetion. It is important to become familiar with an
additional descriptive aid, which permits us to reconstruct the crystal geometri-
cally from the measurement of crystal angles, and to illustrate clearly its angles,
faces, and edges as well as its symmetry. Thus we must introduce the stereo-
graphie projection.
Let us imagine a large sphere circumscribing a small crystal. Face normals
are extended from eaeh face to the surface of the sphere (Fig. 11). We obtain a

found wide acceptance in recent years, the general angle is placed between the a- and b-axes.

system of points on the surface of the sphere. The angular distances between two
points, measured along great circles of the sphere, are related to the interfacial
angles. If an edge common to two faces is extended to intersect the sphere, its

point of intersection must lie 90° from the intersections (poles) of all faces which
are parallel to the edge'. Therefore it follows that the poles of all faces with
parallel edges, that is those faces belonging to a zone, must lie on great circles.
They lie on the periphery of sectional planes through the center of the sphere;
the zone pole lies then 90° distant (Fig. 12). In this way a system of points and
great circles is obtained which permits the reading of angular, zonal , and symmetry

Handling of the stereographie proj ection is simplified by utilizing the stereo-
projection of a grid system. A sphere scribed with longitude and latitude lines
is oriented so that the north and south poles lie in the projection plane. The
latitude and longitude grid is then stereographically projected (Fig. 14). In this
way the stereographie or Wulff net is derived. One is reproduced at the end of
this book. It should be torn out and pasted onto a piece of plywood or cardboard .
The meridians of longitude correspond to great cireles, on whieh zonal assembl ages
ean be plotted. The parallels of latitude are not grea t eireles, with the exception
of the equator, and serve only for reekoning angular values. The plotting of a
stereographie projection is carried out on a piece of traeing paper plaeed over the
Wulff net.
We will show the first steps in using the stereographie projeetion, using the
barite erystal (Fig.8 and Table 1) for whieh we earlier ealeulated the Miller

indices (Fig. 15). Let us assurne that by means of goniometrie measurement, we
have aseertained that the angle a :m=39°11' and c:o= 52°43'. The faces a and
m belong to a zone whose great circle projection is the primitive cirele (the eireum-
ferenee of the proj ection plane). The pole of face a is plotted. Then the pole of
face m is plotted 39° 11' from a on the primitive eirele. The pole of face c coincides
with the zone pole of the faces whose poles lie on the primitive cirele. It lies in the
center of the net. Pole 0 lies 52°43' from c, in the zone cob whieh turns out to be
perpendieular to ac. We project 0 onto the normal to ac. Then b is plotted on the
periphery. If we sketch the zones ao and m c as great cireles, we find the pole of face
z at their interseetion ; z thus lies in both zones. It is only possible from Fig. 8 to see
th at z lies in zone a yo . That z also lies in zone mc can be observed, however, by
further goniometrie study . We eould also find z by ealeulation of the angles cz and
az, noted on p. 11, in that we plot the angular distances as eireles around c and a.
At their intersection lies z.We ean now determine the angle "P2", between b and z
(see p. 11) without further projeetion, sinee we ean measure it on the great
eirele bz, This zone bz furnishes the pole of face u at the interseetion with zone ac.

If we find by means of further goniometrie study that r lies in the zone from u
to 0, we find the face pole r at the intersection of this zone with the zone mz .
From the zonal array we can further easily find d and y. The pole of face l is
obtained at the intersection of zone aude and the zone from y to the left o-face.
The existence of the last zonal assemblage is not apparent in Fig. 8, but requires
further goniometrie investigation1. The position of face A. on this crystal must be
determined by additional measurement.
The stereographie projection of the crystal gives us the angular relations and
represents the crystal in ideal form, undisturbed by growth influences. It enables
us immediately to recognize its symmetry relations. This is not always easily
discernible by cursory examination of natural distorted crystals.
With the help of the stereoprojection we can also construct an exact drawing
of the crystal. For drawing we need to know the edge directions. These are given
by the normals to the zone circles. In Fig. 8 the edge between d and r is parallel
to ae , from top to bottom, and that between u and a, parallel to eb, from left to
right. In this way we can construct a top view like that in Fig. 8 from the stereo-
projection. If we rotate the original pole sphere, it is possible to sketch other
views of the crystal. For example, when astands at the center of the net, we get a
front view. Finally the axial intercepts and the indices can be graphically ascer-
tained. In addition to its use in pure crystallography the stereographic projection
is of use in crystal optics (p. 136), and in rock fabric studies. In the latter case,
however, another kind of spherical projection is generally used (p. 312).
3. Crystal Symmetry
Simple Symmetry Operations. We have become familiar thus far with the
most important rudiments of crystallographic terminology. For this purpose it
Fig. 16. Simple space lattice
was necessary to accept the fact that the constituents of a crystal are distributed
regularly within aspace lattice. In order to probe deeper into the understanding
of crystals, we must formulate an idea of the various kinds of space lattices. It
has already been mentioned on p. 4 that there are 230 symmetrically different
kinds of spatial point arrangements (space groups). In order to understand this
we must make ourselves familiar with the manner in which such regular arrange-
ments occur. We have already established (p. 5) that a point array is considered
to be genuinely homogeneous if each point possesses an infinitely large number
of correspondingly different points, whose positions in the array are equivalent.
1 Note that the edges zr and rl in Fig. 8 are not parallel; otherwise they would form a
zone zrl.

Crystal Symmetry
19
What do we mean by "equivalent positions in the array"? How can we
demonstrate this ?
In Fig. 1 we observed a simple planar net. Here it is immediately clear that
the above stipulation for each point is valid, if we consider the lattice to be
infinitely continuous. We need merely to move from point to point. The
arrangement around each point is identical. Such parallel movements can be
carried out just as weIl in three dimensions in aspace lattice (Fig. 16). Such
movements from point to point are called translations.
In the planar lattice illustrated in Fig. 17, we see another possibility for bring-
ing lattice points into coincidence. Here each point can be made to coincide
with another by rotation of 120° = 360°/3. We speak in this case of a three-fold
axis of rotation. As shown in the same figure, we can also imagine the points
to be brought into coincidence by means of reflection across a mirror or symmetry
plane. Planes of symmetry are familiar to us in the organic world also. Every
individual possesses an imperfect plane of symmetry, although the two sides
of one's body are always somewhat diffe-
rently developed. In the case of crystals
also, because of external influences dur-
ing growth, the symmetry is not always
easy to recognize. It can be easily ascer-
tained, however, if the angular relations

symmetry axes and symmetry planes
Fig. 18. By joining regular pentagons it is
not possible to completely fill planar space
rather than face development are considered. The stereographic projection plays
an important role in this respect, as we have seen.
Movements, by means of which points can be made to coincide, are called
symmetry operations. Examples are the translation, reflection across a symmetry
plane, and the 3-fold rotation, with which we have just become familiar. In
crystals we find other additional rotation axes . Weshall neglect for the moment
the Lfold rotation axis, which transforms a system into itself by rotation
through 360°. This is obviously an operation which can be performed with any
arbitrary asymmetrical body. Only 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotation axes occur
in space lattices. 5-, 7-, and other multi-fold axes are excluded. With the latter
it is not possible to regularly divide up a planar area into equal units, as a trial
with 5- (Fig. 18) or 7-fold point arrays easily shows. Regular polygons bounded
by 5, 7, etc. sides cannot be joined together uninterruptedly, completely filling
planar space. Because they contain 5-fold axes , two of the five regular shapes
which have been known since antiquity do not occur as crystal forms. They are
the pentagonal dodecahedron, a twelve-faced form bounded by regular pentagons,
and the icosahedron, a twenty faced-form bounded by equilateral triangles. In

the organic world we are familiar with examples of five-fold symmetry; for
example, rose blossoms and star fish.
Inversion is an additional symmctry operation. In this case every point in
a pattern has an equivalent opposing point, as if repeated by inversion through
a simple lens. In crystals the inversion center is also called a center of symmetry.
Combined Symmetry Operations. If a point not lying on a symmetry axis is
rotatcd 180°, and immediately inverted through a point lying on the rotation
axis, again rotated 180°, etc . the same repetition of points results as with a

symmetry plane perpendicular to the rotation dircction. If a 3-fold axis is
combined in a similar way with inversion, the same distribution results as with
simultaneous presence of a 3-fold axis and a center of symmetry. By combining
a 6-fold axis with inversion as described above, symmetry results which can be

It is important that the combination of 90° rotation and inversion gives a point
distribution which cannot be described in terms of other rotational symmetry
combinations (Fig . 19). We meet the latter combination of symmetry elements,
t he 4-fold rotoinversion axis in numerous crystals. One can derive the 4-fold

axis
by
means
of another combined symmetry element-by
combination of 90° rotation, followed by reflection across a plane perpendicular

usage and refer to these as inversion axes rather than reflection axes . For
consistency the one-fold inversion axis is introduced also. It is obviously identical
to the symmetry center.
If a symmetry plane is combined with the translation operation, a glide plane
is produced (Fig.20). Combination of rotation axes and translation leads to
screw axes. The three varieties of 4-fold screw axes are illustrated in Figs. 21-23.
It can be easily shown that there are only one 2-fold, two 3-fold, in short (n-1)
n-fold screw axes.

We have now enumerated all of the kinds of symmetry compatible with a
space lattice. If we make use of all of these, either alone or in combination, we can
arrive at 230 possibilities in which they can be arranged together, the space groups.
Usually the following symbols are utilized to designate the symmetry elements.
For the 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold axes the numbers 1, 2, 3,4, and 6 are used; for
the corresponding inversion axes the numbers I, 2, 3, 4, and {\ are used (these
symbols are read "bar 1, bar 2, etc ."). We shalliater meet again all the symbols
of the usual symmetry axes; of the inversion axes we use only the symbols
1,3,4, and 6. Screw axes are each designated according to the rotational repetition
of the axis and the amount of translation coupled with the rotation, using the
symbols 21 , 31 , 32 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 , andB, (the symbol 62 , for example,
is read "six .. . two "). Screw axes are not encountered or revealed by the macro-
symmetry of a crystal, since the translation is on the atomic scale. A symmetry
or mirror plane is designated by the symbol m; a glide plane-as in the case of
the screw axis, revealed only by the fine structure-each according to its direction
of translation with respect to a, b, c, n, or d; a, b, c, represent glide planes with
;, :' or ;
translation; n represents a glide plane translation equal to one-half a
diagonal; and d with a magnitude of one-fourth of the diagonal. The symbol I
for a one-fold inversion axis is also used to designate a center of symmetry.
4. The 32 Crystal Classes
If from all of the possible symmetry operations we consider only those which
apply to macroscopic crystals, that is, if we exclude translation and the symmetry
operations resulting from combination with translation, and, therefore, those
which are concerned with displacements of sub-microscopic magnitude (10-8 cm)
(examples 9-14 in Table 2), the number of symmetry groups is reduced to 32.
These are the 32 crystal classes which HESSEL deduced for the first time in 1830
from symmetry studies.
The Triclinic Classes. In the following discussion we shall acquaint ourselves
with the various classes, deriving them by
combining symmetry elements,
beginning with the lowest symmetry. The lowest symmetry class is obviously

that one which possesses no symmetry at all. The edges and planes of a crystal
without symmetry can be related to a triclinic (Greek tris, triple ; clinein, angle)
coordinate system. In this class the crystal faces are called pedions (Greek,
plain) (Fig.24a). In all classes, any face or plane not related to another face
through symmetry is called a pedion. Following the example of P. GROTH, each

pare crystals of calcium thiosulfate, CaS2Üa· 6H2ü, which crystallize in this class.
As members of the next class, we consider those crystals which possess only
a center of symmetry. Here each face is accompanied by an equivalent and
opposite parallel face. This is always the case no matter what its position on the
crystal. Such opposing and parallel pairs of faces are
called pinacoids (Greek, board) (Fig.25). The class

is called the pinacoidal, and is designated by the symbol i (Fig. 26). In addi-
tion to many other minerals, the important plagioclase group of calcium-sodium
feldspars crystallize in this class. These are mixed crystals of Na[AISiaÜs]
(albite) and Ca[AI2S12üs] (anorthite). Their importance is indicated by the fact
that they constitute approximately 40% of the composition of the earth's crust.
Fig. 27 shows an anorthite crystal with the conventional face symbols. The
characteristics of this class are shown also by one of the potassium feldspars
K[AISiaÜs], called microcline. Bright-green colored specimens are called amazonite
and are cut as semi-precious stones. In addition the important mineral kyanite
AI2ü[SiÜ4] belongs to this class.
The two classes 1 and i constitute the triclinic system.
Tbe Monoclinic Classes. The next class that we meet possesses one plane of

symmetry is a pedion as before . A plane parallel to the symmetry plane becomes
a pinacoid, whereas all other planar positions lead to " roof"-shaped pairs of
planes called domes (Greek, doma, roof) . The planes in this class are related to a
monoclinie coordinate system, with the non-orthogonal axes lying in the plane

Now we shall combine together in pairs the three symmetry elements used
abov e. This has been done in Fig. 33a-c. In (a) we see a symmetry plane with
a two-fold axis perpendicular to it; in (b) a symmetry plane with a center of
symmetry; and in (c) a center of symmetry combined with a two-fold axis.
As can be seen the same face arrangement and symmetry appears regardless
of how the three elements are combined. If all three are combined, the same
symmetry results. This example serves to illustrate that the same symmetry
arrangement can be derived in different ways.

In the new class just created, the general form consists of four faces symmetri-
cally related, a form designated as the prism (Fig.34a-c). A pair of parallel
faces lying perpendicular to the symmetry plane with face poles lying in the
symmetry plane and related to each other through the 2-fold axis as well as the
symmetry center, constitutes a pinacoid. Likewise, a pair of faces parallel to
the symmetry plane is a pinacoid.

Orthorhombic Classes. We shall continue to utilize the same symmetry
elements as before , combining them with each other. If two planes of symmetry
are
crossed perpendicular to each other, 2-fold axis is created, lying along

their line of intersection. In this case four faces or planes in general positions
combine to form a pyramid (Fig.39). The cross section of the pyramid is a
rhombus, which gives the system, in which this and the next two classes fall,
the designation orthorhombic. Therefore, the name of this first class is the
(ortho)rhombic pyramidal, with the symbol mm2 (or mm) (Fig.40). The three
orthorhombic classes are related to an orthogonal coordinate axial system,
which is compatible exclusively with their symmetry. In the class mm2, two of
the coordinate axes, the a- and b-axes, He in the symmetry planes, whereas the

each direction. Faces intersecting the upper end of the c-axis have no eorrespond-
ing equivalent faces intersecting the lower end. In addition to pyramids two

If we consider two perpendicular 2-fold axes we see that a third axis must
appear, standing perpendicular to both of them. Each of these three 2-fold axes
is non-polar. All directions and their opposite directions are equivalent . In this

planes and consists of two wedges or sphenoids symmetrically intergrown (Fig. 42).
This form is the disphenoid and the class is called the orthorhombic disphenoidal ,
with the symbol 222 (Fig. 43). The 2-fold axes are the coordinate axes. The

disphenoid can be considered as a distorted tetrahedron. With higher 4-fold sym-
metry it occurs again later as a tetragonal disphenoid (see p. 42). The regular
tetrahedron itself has even higher symmetry. In addition to disphenoids, prisms
and three pinacoids occur in thisclass. Epsomite ,MgS04' 7HzO (Fig.44) crystallizes
in the class 222 as do many organic eompounds.

We have met for the first time in this crystal class a closed form. With it,
it is possible for a crysta l in this class (and in many which we have yet to en-
counter) to eonsist of only one simple form. In the preceeding classes, all simple
forms were open forms. That is, no individual form completely enclosed the
crystal and accordingly the crystal had to consist of a combination of different
forms. Such combinations of different simple forms are very common, irrespective
of the crystal class. They are indeed the rule as the diagrams in this chapter show.
If we now combine two perpendicular 2-fold axes with a symmetry center,
or two perpendicular symmetry planes with a two-fold axis perpendicular to
one of them, or another symmetry plane perpendicular to both of the original
ones, we encounter the symmetry illustrated in Fig. 45. A horizontal symmetry
plane is illustrated in the figure by means of the solid circle. The general form
which we obtain, if the projection points do not lie on any special position such

as a symmetry plane or axis, is, as Fig. 46 shows, a closed form with eight
faces-a double-or dipyramid. The class is called the orthorhombic dipyramidal.
The appropriate class symbol is 21m 21m 21m, or abbreviated, mmm. In addition

to the dipyramid other form s occur. Those parallel to two axes are the pinacoids
{lOO}, {OlO}, and {OOI}. If parallel to only one axis, (with proj ection points on
the trace of the plane of symmetry) they are the prisms {Okl}, {hOl}, {hkO}.
Many common minerals crystallize in this class. Examples are sulfur (Fig. 47) ;
the anhydrous alkaline earth sulfates, anhydrite (CaS04) , celestite (SrS04) ,

barite (BaS04) (Figs. 8 and 48), and

Significance of Class Symbols, The eight crystal classes to which we ha ve
already referred are grouped together into three crystal systems according to
their coordinate axes: in the trielinie system we have met two classes I and I;
in the mono elinic, m , 2, and 21m; and in the orthorhombic, the classes mm2,
222, and m m m.

The 32 Crystal Classes
29
The symbols 1, 1,2, and m need no further explanation; they indicate the
individual symmetry elements for the corresponding class (see p.21).
The
symbol of the monoclinic prismatic class, 21m (read "two over m") indicates
that a 2-fold axis stands perpendicular to a symmetry plane. The symbols 41m
or 61m have fully analogous meanings. We shall refer to these classes later. In
listing the symbols in the orthorhombic classes, the symmetry axis in the direction
of the a-axis is first given, then in the direction of the b-axis, and finally in the
direction of the c-axisl.
A symmetry plane is always referred to with respect to that axis to which it
is perpendicular. Thus we can interpret the symbols 222, mm2, and 21m 21m 21m.
The 19 classes which now follow contain one unique 3-, 4-, or 6-fold axis.
These are referred to in German as " wirtelig " (whorling) crystals. In designating
their class symbols, that symmetry axis parallel to the Wirtel or primary axis
is indicated first. In orienting the crystal this axis is placed vertical. Then those
symmetry axes follow which parallel the horizontal crystallographic axes (se-
condary axes) and are symmetrically equivalent. The symbol for those symmetry
axes which bisect the angles between the secondary axes finally follows (inter-
mediate axes) . As in the case of the orthorhombic system, the symbol for a
symmetry plane is written, giving its location with respect to that axis to which
it is perpendicular.
The crystal class symbols which we have been using were first formulated
by C. HERMANN and CH. MAUGUIN and are now called the Hermann-Mauguin-
Symbols.
The 19 crystal classes which now follow are grouped into the trigonal, the
tetragonal, the hexagonal systems, depending on whether their primary axis is
three-, four-, or six-fold. We shall not treat these with the same thoroughness as
we have the preceding eight, but shall only refer in some detail to those classes in
which important minerals crystallize. We shall refer to the remaining classes
primarily by means of figures and in the summary in the Appendix, p. 342-349.

Fig. 51. Trigonal pyramid
The Trigonal Classes. We begin with that class which contains a 3-fold axis
as its only symmetry element (Fig. 50). In it the general form is a trigonal pyramid
(Fig. 51). This class is called the trigonal-pyramidal, and has the symbol 3. Nickel
sulfite, NiSÜa . 6H2ü , is an important member.
If we then add a center of symmetry, six faces occur in general positions, with
three projection points lying in the upper hemisphere and three others rotated
60° with respect to them in the lower hemisphere (Fig. 52). The symbol of this
class is 3; face distribution is in accordance with a three-fold inversion axis (see
1 This indicates that in the class mm2, the 2-fold axis is the c-axis. Another alternative
crystal setting commonly used placcs the 2-fold axis parallel to b.

p.20). The general form is a rhombohedron, giving the class its name, rhombo-
hedral. When orienting a crystal, if a rhombohedral face faces upward and toward
the observer, so that its projection point lies in the forward sixth of the stereo-
graphie projection, the rhombohedron is designated as positive (Fig. 53). If the
face faces forward, but downward, it is then called a negative rhombohedron.

When we consider the rhombohedron merely as a geometrical figure , it has
higher apparent symmetry, containing three symmetry planes. However, in the
crystal class 3 the rhombohedron as a physical body does not possess these
symmetry planes. This can be recognized by means of etch figures (Fig. 54),
which reveal that the faces have higher indices and, therefore, are in a more
general position. We shall deal with these later (page
177) when discussing the dissolution of crystals. Etch
methods are very important in assigning a crystal to
its proper class. For example, one can differentiate
calcite with its higher symmetry from the mineral
dolomite, CaMg(C0 3)2 ' The latter crystallizes in the
class 3. It was named after the French mineralogist
DEODAT DE DOLOMIEU (1750-1801), not after the
Italian Alpine mountains of the same name. Phenacite,
Be2[Si04] , willemite, Zn2[Si04] , and ilmenite, FeTi03 ,
belong to this class.
A 2-fold axis perpendicular to the 3-fold axis must
evoke two additional equivalent 2-fold axes (Fig. 55),
giving rise to the trigonal-trapezohedral class, with the
symbol 32.The general form is called the trapezahedron,
of which there are both Ieft- (Fig. 56) and right-handed
(Fig . 57) forms. Three faces occur on the upper and
three on the lower ends of the crystal, but in this case
they are not displaced 60° with respect to each other, as in the case of the rhombo-
hedron, but at any general angle . The mineral quartz (Si02) crystallizes in this class.
This is a very important and common mineral which makes up about 12% of
the earth's crust. We shall note ncxt the possible forms in this class. Faces whose
projection points lie at the intersection of a twofold axis and the primitive circle,
form a three-faced open form, a trigonal prism. If one of the faces faces to the
right and toward the observer (1l20), the form is called a right-handed trigonal
prism ; the other, for which the face has the indices (2IIO), is a left-handed prism.
If the projection point of this prism is moved from the primitive circle, along a
line connecting with the center of the projection, a new projection point results,

representing a trigonal dipyramid. This form also has left- and right-handed
orientations. If we place the projection point on the primitive criele, near to, but
not coinciding with, the intersection with the 2-fold axis , we obtain a ditrigonal
prism, also with left- and right-handed orientations. If we make the angular
distan ce between two points on the primitive cirele equal to 60°, we create a

regular " hexagonal " prism. This designation is usually given to this form, al-
though the six faces are not really related through a 6-fold repetition. One face
is obtained from the other through rotation around a 2-fold rather than a 6-fold
axis. Thercfore, it can in reality just as weIl be considered a combination of
equally developed positive and negative trigonal prisms. If we move the pro-
jection point from this border position inward along the connecting line to the
center, either a positive or negative rhombohedron results . Faces represented by
a point lying at the center of the projection form a pinacoid {0001}with its parallel
opposing face.

Quartz (Fig. 58) usually displays faces of the hexagonal prism m {lOi O},
the positive rhombohedro n r {lOil} and the negative Z or r' {Ol il}, the trigonal
dipyrarnids s{1l 21} and s' {2ii l}, (shown in Fig. 59 with Sz and sr) and the
trapezohedron x{5161}. Fig. 59 shows the position of these points in stereographic
proj ection, designating positive and negative and right- and left-handed form s.
If the

developed, they
give the
impression of a hexagonal pyramid. A very careful study of face development
usually shows that each set of three alte rnating faces belong together. Steep

whose projection points would fall on the primitive circle, would be a hexagonal
prism. The varied development of positive and negative rhombohedral faces can
be dependent upon growth or dissolution phenomena. The latter, in the case of
quartz, can be brought about artificially, either with caustic potash (Fig.60) or
hydrofluoric acid. These figures show that two adjacent faces of the so-called

hexagonal prism are not related to each other by a 6-fold axis. Etch figures are
also important technologically, because with their help it can be established
externally whether a crystal is homogeneous, or whether it consists of several
crystals intimately intergrown. Such intergrowths, called twins, will be referred
to later (p. 98).

As has already been noted, there are in this class both left- and right-handed
forms. The ability of a substance to form both left- and right-hand ed crystals is
called enantiomorphism . It is related to the symmetry of the crystal and is en-
countered only in those crystals which possess neither a center nor plane of
symmetry. In the case of quartz the Si and 0 atoms are spirally arranged, right-

handed quartz having left-spiralling screw axes, and left-handed quartz, right.
The 2-fold axes are polar, that is to say, opposing directions are not equivalent.
Related to the symmetry are two additional properties of quartz, its optical
activity (p. 142) and piezoelectric behavior (p. 118), both of which we shall
encounter later.
Quartz is a useful crystal on account of its piezoelectric behavior (oscillator
quartz) and is an important raw material because of its excellent transparency
in the ultraviolet (quartz spectrograph). Smaller crystals are used in the pro-
duction of quartz glass. Optically clear specimens are called rock crysta1. Violet
amethyst, which was at one time considered as a protection from drunkedness,
finds use as a semi-precious stone. The word, probably of pre-Hellenic origin, is
related to the Greek word methyein, meaning to become drunk, and the negative
prefix a. Madeira topaz, quartz topaz, and genuine topaz quartz are names
for yellow to yellow-brown (Madeira wine) colored quartzes, usually produced
by heating amethyst or dark-colored smoky quartz. Chalcedony is quartz which
has grown in fibrous form perpendicular to the 3-fold axis, along the [1010] or
[1120] axes. Quartz, fibrous parallel to c, also occurs and is called quartzin.
Agate
consists
of chalcedony and finely crystalline quartz intermixed. In
addition to quartz the important mineral cinnabar, HgS, crystallizes in the class32.

The next class which we shall study has apolar 3-fold axis. Accordingly,
electrical effects occur along this axis upon heating: the crystal becomes posi-
tively charged at one end, negatively at the other. The charged ends then attract
light particles. This pyroelectric ejject (see p. 118) was first discovered in the
mineral tourmaline, a sodium aluminum borofluorsilicate. This property led to
the Dutch designation of this mineral as " Aschentrekker ". Plates cut perpen-
dicular to the 3-fold axis are also piezoelectric. The class exemplified by tour-
maline is derived by combining the 3-fold axis with a plane of symmetry so that
the axis lies in the plane (Fig. 61). This actually creates three equivalent symmetry
planes intersecting each other at an angle of 60°. The general form is a ditrigonal-
pyramid (Fig. 62). The class is called the ditrigonal-pyramidal, with the symbol
3m.
It is usually the case with tourmaline that several ditrigonal-prisms occur,
so that a cross section of a crystal resembles a triangle with convex-curved sides.
The polarity of the 3-fold axis is rendered observable in many specimens of
tourmaline by the form development (Fig. 63). The "red silver ores" proustite
AgaAsSa and pyrargyrite AgaSbSa also belong to this class.
The addition of 2-fold axes as the angle bisectors of the symmetry planes
of class 3m, leads to the ditrigonal-scalenohedral class, 321m or 3m (Fig. 64). The

crystal is usually referred to as its habit. Thus the habit of calcite in Fig. 68 is
tabular, in Fig. 69 is compaet columnar, in Figs. 70 and 71 columnar to acieular.
The habit of crystals whose dimensions are approximately equal in all directions
is called isometrie.
The elements As, Sb, Bi, as well as the minerals corundum (AI20a) and
hematite (Fe 20a), crystallize in the class 321m. Varities of blue corundum are

called sapphire; the red variety, ruby. Fine-grained corundum is known as
emery.
If we now add a horizontal symmetry plane to the classes 3m or 32, we
derive the ditrigonal-dipyramidal elass, 8m2 (Figs.72 and 73), in which only
the very rare mineral benitoite BaTi[Si309] crystallizes.

As mentioned earlier, theoretically one would expect a crystal class resulting
from the combination of a 3-fold axis and a perpendicular plane of symmetry,
but no representatives sre known. The corresponding class would be called the
trigonal-dipyramidal, with the symbol 8 (Figs.74 and 75).

The 32 Crystal ClaBBeB
37
The symbols of these last two classes (8m2 and 8) have been written using
a 6-fold inversion axis. Therefore, frequently they are not grouped with the
trigonal, but with the hexagonal classes. However, when we recall that a Baxis
is equivalent to 31m, and if, in the assignment of morphology we wish to empha-
size clearly and prominently the 3-fold symmetry, we will then place themamong
the trigonal classes. However, this assignment is still arbitrary, and for a variety
of reasons one might prefer to group them among the hexagonal classes. This
concludes the discussion of the trigonal classes, and we can now proceed to those
containing 6-fold axes.

The Hexagonal Classes. The simplest hexagonal class is the hexagonal
pyramidal,
6
(Figs.76 and 77) containing only a
6-fold axis.
Nepheline,
Na [AISi04] , a common constituent of basaltic rocks, crystallizes in this class.
In nepheline about one-fourth of the sodium is usually replaced by potassium.
If we first add a symmetry plane parallel to the 6-fold axis, we create actually
six equivalent symmetry planes intersecting each other at an angle of 30°. This
is the dihexagonal-pyramidal class, 6mm (Figs. 78 and 79). A form of ZnS, wurt-
zite, crystallizes in this class.
If we combine a horizontal symmetry plane with a 6-fold axis, we derive the
hexagonal-dipyramidal class, 61m (Figs. 80 and 81), in which the most important
phosphate mineral, apatite, Oa5(F, OH, 01) (P04)3 (Fig. 82) crystallizes.
By combining a 2-fold axis perpendicular to the 6-fold axis, we derive the
hexagonal-trapezohedral class, 622 (Fig. 83). The hexagonal trapezohedron corre-
sponds to the trigonal one we met earlier, but has 2 x 6 rather than 2 X 3 faces.
Again right- (Fig.84) and left-handed (Fig.85) forms occur. " High " quartz,

the Si02 modification stable between 575 and 870

" high " quartz inverts into several individuals of " low" quartz without the
original crystallosing its integrity (twinning p. 96ff., also p. 62).

trapezohedral olass 622
If we now add a center of symmetry to this last class or to the class 6mm, we
create the highest symmetry possible in the hexagonal system, the dihexagonal-
dipyramidal class 6fm 2fm 2fm, abbreviated 6fmmm (Figs. 86 and 87). In this
class crystallizes the mineral beryl, Be3AI2[S401S] (Fig.88), known as the semi-
precious blue-green gem aquamarine, or as the green gem emerald. The green
variety of beryl has been especially highly prized since antiquity. In theMiddle
Ages thin plates of beryl were used in the peepholes of holy shrines, explaining
the derivation from the German word, Brille, meaning eye glasses,

The last twelve classes (trigonal and hexagonal) are sometimes subdivided
in a different fashion. The classes 6, 6fm, 622, 6mm, 6fmmm, 8, and 8m2 are
sometimes grouped together into a hexagonal system, whereas the classes 3, :3,

32, 3m, 321m, are grouped together as the trigonal rhombohedral system. In the
latter either hexagonal or rhombohedral coordinate axes (p. 14) are used. For
all twelve of these classes, when referred to hexagonal coordinates, it is sufficient
in characterizing axial parameters to denote the ratio a :c. In the case of rhombo-
hedral coordinate axes, it is necessary to indicate the angle which the three
axes make with each other.

If a horizontal symmetry plane is added, the tetragonal dipyramidal elass,
41m (Fig.92) results. The mineral scheelite (CaW04) (Fig.93) is a member of
this elass.
If the mirror plane is placed vertically, it is repeated again after 90°, in
accordance with the four-fold symmetry . As a result of the symmetry two addi-
tional symmetry planes occur midway between the former two. This elass is

called the ditetragonal-pyramidal, 4mm (Figs.94 and 95). Thus pairs of faces
reoccur in tetragonal repetition. An example of this class is the laboratory pro-

The 32 Crystal Classes
43
If we add to the tetragonal inversion axis either a perpendicular 2-fold axis
or a symmetry plane parallel to the 4-fold axis, two mirror planes parallel to the
rotation axis and two 2-fold rotation axes perpendicular to it appear (Fig. 106).
The general form is the tetragonal scalenohedron in which, as in the trigonal
variety, paired faces above and below oppose each other rotated 90° with respect
to each other. As in the case of the rhombohedron, positive (Fig. 107) and negative
scalenohedra (Fig. 108) can be distinguished. In this tetragonal scalenohedral
class, 42m, are found disphenoids {hhl} (Fig. 109 shows {lll} and {332}),

The Cubic Classes. All of the possible combinations of 2-fold rotation axes
and mirror planes with a single 3-,4-, or 6-fold rotation axes have been exhausted
with the classes already enumerated. If we now attempt to combine with each
other several axes which have higher than two-fold symmetry, we note that this
is onIy possible when we arrange four 3-fold axes along the directions of the
corner diagonals of the cube. We observe further that a 4-fold axis occurs perpen-
dicular to each cube face of the same cube. Since each of these axes penetrates
two cube faces, there are in all three 4-fold axes. Weshall now concern ourselves
with these arrangements. Weshall group together the five remaining crystel
classes into the cubic system. The corresponding crystals are related to orthogon~l
coordinate axes. The unit faces intersect all three axes equally so that no further
statement is necessary, other than to call the crystal cubic.
.
!
The Hermann-Mauguin symbols for cubic crystals are formulated in the
following manner: the kind of symmetry axis parallel to the cube edge is de-
signated in the first position (it does not necessarily have to be a 4-fold axis,
as we shall see); in the second position the kind of symmetry axis parallel to the
corner diagonal of the cube (3 or 3) ; and in the third position the axes parallel
to the edge diagonals. The same symmetry plane notation suffices as with the
preceding crystal classes. We are able to recognize immediately from the Hermann-
Mauguin symbols that we are dealing with a cubic erystal when 3 or 3 oeeurs in
the second position.
I
The lowest eubie symmetry oceurs when onIy the four 3-fold axes along the
cube-diagonals are assumed. With this eombination of 3-fold axes, three 2-fold
axes appear parallel to the edges of the eube and biseeting the angles between
the 3-fold axes. No 4-fold axes are found in the geometrieal eubie shape itself.
Likewise neither symmetry planes nor a center of symmetry appear (Fig. llO) .
The projeetion point of the general form occurs at 2 X 3 positions on the upper

hemisphere with a like number on the lower hemisphere. The corresponding
form is a dodecahedron (Greek dodeca, 12; hedra, plane), called a pentagonal
dodecahedron
(Fig. Ill). In order to
distinguish it from other pentagonal
dodecahedra, we shall refer to it by another common name, tetartoid. In projeo-
tion each of three pentagonal planes is arranged around the projection point
of the tetrahedron (see p. 49). The symbol for this tetratoidal class is 23. In this
class belong the mineral ullmanite (NiSbS), very rarely occurring as well-devel-
oped crystals, sodium chlorate and sodium bromate, both of which are optically
active and piezoelectric (p. 142 and ll8).

Diploid (disdodeca.hedron)
If a horizontal symmetry plane is then added, the number of faces is doubled
and they appear on both the upper and lower ends of the crystaI. At the same
time two additional mirror planes appear, and the 3-fold axis becomes a 6-fold
inversion axis (Fig. ll2). A center of symmetry also occurs. The corresponding
general form is a disdodecahedron (Fig. ll3), composed of 24 faces. In order to
differentiate it from other 24-faced forms, it is also commonly called a diploid,
referring to the occurrence of its faces in pairs. The 21m3 or m3 class is named
after the diploid. In it crystallizes one of the most common minerals, pyrite
(FeS 2) , whose morphology was thoroughly described as far back as 1725 by
HENCKEL, in his monograph, " Die Pyritologie ". Because pyrite occurs in many
forms, and because crystals are readily found , we shall briefly enumerate its
possible forms (Fig. ll4). In the diploid {hkl} three irregular four-sided faces
are distributed around each 3-fold axis, Depending on which of the 24 parts of

the projection one starts from, either positive or negative forms (7+ or 7-) are
obtained. In the case of face location (6), we obtain again 24 faces, which are
trapezoids. This form is called, therefore, the trapezohedron (Fig. 138). It is
illustrated by the form {hhl} with h < l.
Also in the case of face position (5),
we get 24 faces, but now these are isos-
oelestriangles. The resulting form is call-
ed the trisoctahedron, {hhl} with h > 1
(Fig. 136). Points lying on a symmetry
plane (4)are repeated twelve times form-
ing a form bounded by pentagons and
called
the pentagonal
dodecahedron
{hkO} (Fig.131). Thisformisoftencalled
the pyritohedron, because of its com-
mon occurrenceon pyrite.The pentagons
are not regular, or else the body would
have 5-fold axes. In the case of the
pentagonal dodecahedron, positive (4+)
and negative (4-) forms can be distin-
guished. If one places the projection
point at the center of the symmetry
plane, that is to say, 45° from the2-fold
axis, a twelve-facedform (3) is obtained
bounded by rhombi. This form is the
rhombic dodecahedron {110} (Fig. 130).
The positions of the points of emer-
gence of the 3-fold axes correspond to the octahedron {lll} (2) (Fig. 134); the
points of emergence of the 2-fold axis, to the cube {lOO} (1).
Fig. 115. Pyrite cube with striations
Fig. 116. Pyrite. {lOO} and {hkO}
In pyrite the combination of {lOO}, {110}, {I11}, and {hkO} is particularly
common. Often cubes are found whose faces are striated in the manner shown
in Fig. 115. The striations indicate that these crystals lack the 4-fold axes as
well as the diagonal symmetry planes, which are encountered in classes of higher
symmetry. The striations correspond to the directions of horizontal and vertical
edges of the pentagonal dodecahedra (pyritohedra) which result from alternating
growth after {lOO} and {hkO}, especially {2lO} (Fig. 116).
The combination of the pentagonal dodecahedron {210} and the octahedron
{I11} (Fig. 117) gives a 20-faced body illustrated in Fig. 118, if the faces of both
forms are of the proper size. This looks very similar to the icosahedron, the
regular body with 5-fold axes. The twelve pentagonal dodecahedral faces, however,

are not equilateral, but rather isoseeles triangles and frequently appear dull
from fine striations after {421}, while the equilateral triangles of the octahedral
faces are brilliant.
lf we insert into the class 23 a diagonal 2-fold axis instead of the vertical
symmetry plane, this axis is repeated six times, three times around each 3-fold
axis. The three 2-fold axes of the cIass 23 become 4-fold axes (Fig. 119). The
general form is again a twenty-four-faced one bounded by pentagons, the
pentagonal icoeotetrahedron. (Fig. 120), more commonly called a gyroid and after
which the class is named. The class symbol is 432 or 43. The forms are the same

On the basis of their outward crystalline form some crystals of sal ammoniac
(NH4CI) belong to this class. On the basis of its inner atomie structure the
ßform of manganese, which is stable between 150
0 and 850
0 C, is also a represen-
tative of this class.
If a diagonal symmetry plane is introdueed into the class 23, it is repeated
six times. The 2-fold axes become 4-fold inversion axes (Fig. 121). The general
form after whieh the class is named is the hextetrahedron (Fig. 122). The class
is ealled the hextetrahedral with symbol 43m. {lll} is here the tetrahedron
(Fig. 133), {hhl} with h > 1 the deltoid dodeeahedron (deltohedron) (Fig. 135),
and {hhl} with h < 1 the tristetrahedron (Fig. 137). Sphalerite (ZnS) (Fig. 123),
a eommon and the most important zine-bearing mineral, belongs here .

Crystal Mathematics
The introduction of a center of symmetry to class 43m or 432, as weIl as the
introduction of a diagonal symmetry plane to class m3, results in the highest
crystal symmetry obtainable by any combination of symmetry elements (Fig.
124). This class, which is represented by the 48-faced form, the hexoctahedron
(Fig. 125), has the symbol 4fm 3 2fm or m3m and is called the hexoctahedral.
In this class many metals such as gold, silver, and copper crystallize, as do many
important minerals. As examples we oan mention magnetite (FeSü4) , which
forms octahedra and rhombic dodecahedra, and galena (PbS) which occurs as
cubes frequently modified by octahedra and rhombic dodecahedra (Fig.126).

Fluorite (CaF2), which usually crystallizes as cubes and always exhibits octahedral
cleavage, is occasionally modified by the hexoctahedron at the cube corners
(Fig. 127). Gamet, (Mg, Fe+2, Mn+2, Ca)a (Al, Fe+a, Cr+S)2 [Siü4]a, commonly
crystallizes as the rhombic dodecahedron or the trapezohedron (Fig. 128).
Diamond probably also belongs in this class. Leucite K[AlSi2ü6] crystallizes
usually with {1l2} as its diagnostic form.
All of the forms of the cubic system, with the exception of the genoral {hkl}
forms respectively of all five of the cubic classes, are enumerated diagramatically
in Figs. 129-138.
Additional Symbols and Names for the 32 Crystal Classes. In addition to the
Hermann-Mauguin symbols utilized here, there it another symbolism in use
that goes back to Schoenflies. Weshall not deal with it further here, since today
the Hermann-Mauguin symbols are in most general use. Since it is necessary to
have some familiarity with them in order to understand the crystallographic

literature, the reader is referred to Table 2 in Appendix A, in which the Schoen-
flies symbols are also tabulated.
In naming the 32 crystal classes, we have used the name of the most general
form , as recommended by
G ROTH . There are still other names in use whose
derivation is based on the reasoning that one can proceed in each crystal system
from the class of highest symmetry and systematically eliminate symmetry

of
crystallography. This is a field which frequently causes the beginner special
difficulty. Many people have a very poorly-developed three- dimensional per-

three -dimensional perception to a very high degree. This is accomplished onIy

5. Space Groups
The 14 Translation Lattiees (Spaee Lattiees). The most eonvenient way to
build up a periodic point arrangement in space is to start with a point, and by
means of translations in three direetions (whieh naturally may not lie in the
same plane), and repetition of this proeess to the newly ereated point, to produee
a simple lattiee (see Fig. 16). Such a lattice eonsists as it were of parallelopipeds
stacked one upon the other, at whose corners points oeeur. Such a parallelopiped

is called an elementary or unit cell. The magnitude of the three translations and
the angles between them can assume different values. Careful study leads to
the conclusion that only 14 symmetrically different point arrangements can be
obtained in this manner. Seven of these (Fig. 139), comprise the most highly
symmetrical unit cells, containing points only at their corners. Since each point
belongs equally to eight unit cells coming together at a common corner, each
unit cell contains only one point. The lattice is said to be simple primitive. In

particular cases space lattices are known in which the most highly symmetrical
unit cell contains two points. These are called doubly primitive (Fig . 140a-c,
e and f); in addition there are those which contain four points, called quadruply
primitive (Fig . 140d and g).
Space lattices are classified as triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal,
hexagonal, rhombohedral, and cubic, based on their coordinate axes . In the case
of multiple primitive lattices, it is necessary to indicate whether the most highly
symmetrical unit cell is body centered, face-pair centered, or fully face centered.
In order to avoid confusion, it should be emphasized that those lattices which

52
Crystal Mathemati cs
are usually described as multiple primitive can be produced by means of three
translations of a primitive unit cell ; the geometrical form of this cell has then,
however, a lower symmetry than the lattice considered as a point arrangement
in space. It is indicated in Fig. 140 how the point arrangement is obtained through
simple translation. The rhombohedral lattice can be considered as an inter-
penetration of hexagonal lattices and vice versa ; then a triply primitive lattice
must be used. These 14 space lattices are also called Bravais lattices after
BRAVAIS in France, who promulgated them in 1850. The German, FRANKEN-
HEIM, had coneerned himself with these lattiees as early as 1835, but their
eomplete derivation was first published by him in 1855.

first spaee groups. From their number alone it ean be seen that they eannot
explain the symmetry of all 32 erystal elasses. They represent rather the seven
most highly symmetrieal classes of eaeh system 1, 2fm, mmm, 4fmmm, 3 2fm,
6fmm m, m3m.

In order 1.0build up point arrangements in space 1.0 whieh the lower symmetry
classes also eorrespond, one must turn 1.0 another eonstruetional prineiple,
utilizing operations other than translations for the generation of repetition. To
this end one investigates the geometrie possibilities of periodie two-dimensional
patterns (for example, wallpaper and fabries). In so doing we meet again as
symmetry elements all of those whieh we already know from the maerosymmetry
of the erystal, and in addition serew axes, glide planes (see p. 21), and trans-
lations. Just as one ean discern from the symmetry elements of the maeroerystal
only a finite number of eombinations (the 32 erystal classes), so ean we reeognize
only a finite number of symmetry possibilities for spatial patterns-230 whieh
are called the space qroupe. These eneompass the symmetry of all the erystal
elasses. Usually several spaee groups eonstitute eaeh erystal class. This eannot
be diseerned maeroseopieally, sinee the magnitudes of the translations involved
in serew axes and glide planes are so small (order of magnitude: several A). As a
result these appear maeroseopically like ordinary axes or symmetry planes.
Two examples of spaee groups are illustrated in Figs. 141 and 142. In Fig.
141 only 3-fold screw axes are indieated ; in Fig. 142, 3-fold rotation axes,
symmetry planes, and glide planes. Partieles whieh lie on a symmetry center,
a symmetry axis, or a symmetry plane must satisfy their symmetry; partieles
whieh lie between the symmetry elements or on a serew axis or glide plane need
have no unique particle symmetry. As a result it is possible 1.0 build up highly
symmetrieal arrangements from quite asymmetrieal particles. The experimental

investigation of crystals with X-rays, with which we shalllater become acquain-
ted, has revealed, however, that the lattice constituents of crystals, at least,
very frequently possess high individual symmetry.
While the study of the symmetry of periodic three-dimensional arrangements
is quite modern (the first derivations of the 230 space groups were given by
FEDEROV in 1890 and by SCHÖNFLIESS in 1891), mankind has, during that
period for which we have a historical record, concerned himself with two-dimen-
sional arrangements in the design of ornaments. The symmetry of these arrange-
ments can be systematically understood. There are only 17 planar space groups.
Two examples of old Egyptian designs (Figs. 143 and 144) show how strongly

geometrical requirements are fulfilled and how great is their variation . Further-
more, planar symmetry is also important in the case of crystals. Not only the
symmetry of natural crystal faces, but especially the symmetry discerned by
the use of etch figures, is used to recognize the crystal class. We have already
noted this in the case of dolomite and quartz.
The symmetry details of the 230 space groups are amply described in numerous
reference works. A summary table is included here in the Appendix (p. 352). We
shall not concern ourselves with them here, but want only to learn the manner
in which they are described.
Space LatticeDescription. We consider the 230 space groups as an enlargement
of the 14 Bravais lattices, that is, as if a group of points were derived from one
lattice point, or what is the same, from interpenetrating Bravais lattices. If we
want to describe such aspace lattice we need first of all to know that principle
by means of which the translation is repeated. We need to know the parameters

Crystal Mathematics
of the unit cell, that is, the lattice dimensions, a, b, c, and the interaxial angles
IX, ß, y, and its translation group. Secondly it is necessary to know the pattern
of points (motif) that replace the Bravais points. It must be specified how many
atoms occur in the unit cell and how they are arranged, by noting their coordinates
with respect to the coordinate axes of the unit eell. As with face indices, the
coordinates are written in order with respect to the a-, b-, and c-axes. Thus the
translation group alone is sufficient for describing the cubic body-centered
lattice. It can, however, also be described as two interpenetrating simple cubic
lattices, whose origins have the coordinates 0, 0, 0, and t, t, t. If one wishes
to describe the cubic face-centered lattice as simple penetrating cubic lattices,
a base of four points, 000, ott, tot, tto, is needed. The NaCI lattice
is a penetration of two cubic face-centered lattices with the origins for Na, 000,
and Cl ttt. The following point positions are taken up with respect to a simple
cubic lattice.

1. Ionic Bonding
Ionic Radii. Our previous discussion has shown the symmetries which are
possible in point arrays and how they are related to crystal form . We are now
familiar with the geometric framework into which the collective crystal world
can be arranged. We now want to inquire further as to what relationships exist
between the kinds of partieles -
atoms or molecules - and their crystal structural
arrangement. Why, for example, do crystals of the three compounds BN, ZnS,
and NaCl each possess a unique structure and crystallize in different classes !
Chemists and mineralogists have concerned themselves with these questions for
more than 100 years. In the beginning, attempts were made to establish some
universal generalities, by collecting data from as many kinds of crystals as
possible. This approach culminated in 1919 with the publication of P. VON
GROTH'S "Chemische Kristallographie". His first volume was published in 1906.
This is a book which even today is an important reference work, especially in the
field of organic crystallography. In it is compiled all that was known at that time
about the crystal forms of the elements and their compounds. It was not possible
in this way, however, to organize the enormous volume of data according to
some unifying concept. An important principle was revealed around 1920, when
the first crystal structures were experimentally determined. Different investi-
gators, especially V. M. GOLDSCHMIDT and H . G. GRIMM, attempted to explain
the spatial arrangement of particles in terms of their volume requirements. They
recognized that crystal structure was dependent upon the size relationships of
the building blocks. They experimented systematically, synthesizing crystals,
substituting first one and then the other constituent atom. This proved to be
an extremely fruitful method. It was soon suggested that these particles, atoms
and ions, were essentially spherical, and that their "effective radii" could be
calculated. In the case of structures which consist of only one element it is possible
to calculate directly the atomic radii, if the arrangement is known and the as-
sumption made that the atomic spheres are in contact or as elose together as
possible . It is more difficult to determine atomic radii in crystals composed of
several chemical elements. An important step forward was taken in 1922, when
WASASTJERNA first calculated from refractometric data that the ionic radii of
Fl- and 0 2 - were 1.33 and 1.32 A respectively. These data were immediately used
by V. M. GOLDSCHMIDT to derive empirically the ionic radii of many other
elements. As soon as the radius of oxygen became known, the radii of the metallic
ions could be calculated from the structures of their oxides. In 1927 Pauling
calculated another set of ionic radii on the basis of wave mechanics. Both sets of
ionic radii in most cases show very good agreement. In Table A 7, p. 358 in the
Appendix, GOLDSCHMIDT'S ionic and atomic radii are tabulated. With increasing

56
Crystal Chemistry
atomic number, the atomic and ionic radii! decrease in the horizontal rows of the
periodic table ; in the vertical rows on the other hand they increase. Thus it is
noted in Table A 7 that ionic radii decrease in the horizontal row from Na + (0.98A)
to S+6(O.34A), but increase from
Li+(0.78A) to Cs+(1.65A). With increasing
positive ionic charge the radius decreases; for trivalent positively charged manga-
nese the radius is 0.91A, for tetravalent manganese 0.70 A, and for the septavalent
ion, only 0.52 A. Negative charge increases the radius, since electrons are added
to the original shells. Chemical bonding by means of electrostatic forces is called
ionic or heteropolar bonding.

Radius Ratios and
Coordination Number. With the help
of this simple
representation of spherical ions, one can understand a surprising number of
phenomena in the crystal world . Webegin with the question of how such oppo-
sitely charged particles group themselves. We start by assuming that ions are
rigid and that arrangement is energetically most favorable, when each ion is
surrounded by as large a number of neighboring ions as possible. In this way the
average distance between oppositely charged particles is kept as small as possible.
The likely arrangement depends then on the relative size of atoms in a compound
and on the relative numbers of ion species. The size relationships of two ions are
expressed by the radius ratios RAIRB' where RB is taken as the radius of the
larger ion. Frequently chemical compounds with the same atomic proportions
are grouped together and related to a type compound. Thus the substances
NaCI, CsCI, MgO, ZnS, AsS , etc . are AB type compounds; CaF2 , FeS2 , Si02 ,
H 20, etc . are AB2 types ; the compounds CaCOa, PbCOa, CaTiOa, MgSiOa are
A BOa types.
For a given radius ratio it is possible to arrange six B spheres around a sphere
A, as is shown in cross section in Fig. 145. The centers of the B spheres lie at the
corners of an octahedron with all of them in contact with A. We say that the
coordination polyhedron around the A sphere is an octahedron. In general the
coordination polyhedron is that polyhedron formed by connecting the centers
of the coordination neighbors with one another. An example of a structure with

If the A atom is made smaller, maintaining the size of B, it can no longer be in
contact with six spheres. Another arrangement becomes energetically more
favorable, namely that one with four B's around A , in which the centers of the
B spheres lie at the corners of a tetrahedron. The ideal value for the radius ratio

58
Crystal Chemistry
in such a case is RAIRn= Vi-1 R;; 0.22. If on the other hand A is increased in size,
the six B spheres remain in contact with it, but can no longer remain in contact
with each other. As soon as the radius of A is sufficiently large that eight spheres
can coordinate about it, 8-fold cubic coordination results. The radius ratio in
this case, as can be deduced from Fig. 147 is:

Rn = 13 - 1 R;;0.73 .
Fig. 148 shows an example of this coordination in the CsCI structure. Octahedral
coordination is exhibited by the NaCI structure (Fig. 146), tetrahedral coordina-
tion in the sphalerite stru cture (Fig. 149). This last structure is not purely ionic
(see p. 82) and strictly speaking does not belong here. A very similar structure

which likewise possesses fourfold coordination, is that of wurzite (Fig. 150).
Wurtzite is also a form of ZnS, crystallizing , however, not like cubic sphalerite,
but in the dihexagonal pyramidal class ". In the sphalerite structure the Zn atoms
and the S atoms each form a cubic face-centered lattice; in wurtzite each type of
atom forms a hexagonallattice. No really pure ionic compounds crystallize with
either of these structural types. Perhaps most nearly approaching an ionic struc-
ture with tetrahedral coordination is BeO, which has the wurtzite structure.
We can assurne, therefore, that the grouping together of ions obeys such
simple geometrical relationships. These determine the coordination number, the
number of nearest neighbors. The limiting radius ratios just deduced, are applic-
able naturally not only to AB-type compounds, but generally. In the case of A B2
compounds, each A ion has twice as many neighbors as each B ion. If eight
B's surround each A , four A 's surround each B. A is, then, cubically (8-fold) and
B tetrahedrally coordinated, as in the fluorite stru cture (Fig. 151). In a crystal
structure of the type A B 2 , if the Aion is octahedrally coordinated by 6 B ions,
each B ion must in turn have 3 A neighbors.
One would expect that this would be realized ideally, by three octahedra
linked together at a common B ion and with 3 A ions around B forming an

ences from wurtzite are only trivial energetically. In all of the ZnS structures, the Zn is
tetrahedrally coordinated by four S atoms, and vice versa.

equilateral triangle. Actually this ideal arrangement does not occur. Instead t he
coordination in such a structure is always somewhat distorted. Such is the case
for the three Ti0 2 modifications, rutile (Fig. 152), anatase, and brookite. Cassi-
terite, Sn02 , has the same structure as rutile.
Important representatives of A B 2 compounds with tetrahedral coordination
about A, and 2-fold coordination about
B , are the Si0 2 modifications, quartz,
tridymite, cristobalite , coesite, and kea-
tite. The latter is known only as a syn-
thetic product. In these the Si04-te-
trahedra are linked through corners,
so that each oxygen is shared between
t wo Si0 4-tetrahedra . Linkage occurs,
however, only through corners -
the
tetrahedra do not share edges ! The
known Si02-modifications differ from
each other only in the geometry of the
Si0 2 framework. The Si04 tetrahedra
are linked together in the same manner
in all of them 1 (see discussion of tecto-
silicates, p. 74). As an example, high
cristobalite is illustrated in Fig. 153.
Cuprite is another example of an
A B 2 compound. This structure can be
described as an interpenetration of a
body centered 0 - and a face centered Cu-lattice. A summary of the theoretical
coordination relationships for AB and A B 2 compounds is given in t he following

Deviations from Theory. Let us now attempt to confirm these simple geo-
metrical considerations by arranging the X -ray determined structure types of
simple compounds accordi ng to increasing cationic and anionic radii. This has
been done in Tabl e 4 for the alkali halides. It can be seen that strict conformity
to simple geometrie principles is not adhered to.
The coordination relations of other compounds of divalent cations, are given
in Tables 5 and 6. Numerous exceptions to theory are noted here also. The reasons
are varied. The ionic radii used for calculation and those ap pearing in Tables 4, 5,
and 6 are va lid only for 6-fold coordination. With 8-fold coordination, the effective
ionic radii become about 3% greater, as in the alkali halides. As noted in Table 6,
1 The recently synthesized and discovered mineral stishovite, which forms at very high
pressure (above about 120,000 atm.), is a mod ification of Si02 in which the silicon is coordi-
nated octa hedrally by six rather than the usua l four oxygens. It has the rutile structure.

for the compounds of certain metals (Zn, Hg) and some anions, the disagreement
is especially bad. Here the influence of other types of bonding asserts itself. This
effect will be discussed later in more detail. In general, however, when considering
the same anion, coordination number around the cation increases with increasing
effective cation radius.
Pauling's Rules. In the previous discussion we have used only the radius
ratio, that is the size relationships of rigid ionic spheres, in order to explain

61
different structural types. This is naturally a very approximate procedure. The
more propcr way to consider crystals with electrostatic bonding is to inquire
about the energy which is released when ions come together into crystals. Of all
the possible geometrical arrangements, that one occurs, at least at low tempera-
tures where vibrations and other motions of the crystal can be neglected, which
results in greatest release of energy. This is also the most stable arrangement.
One can calculate this released energy (electrostatic lattice energy, see p. 166),
but the procedure is usually very laborious. Often one can resort to PAULINO'S
Rules (PAULINO, 1929), which suggest qualitatively the requirements for electro-
static bonded atomic arrangements with most favorable energy relationships.
Because of their importance, they will be stated here :
1. Around every cation, a coordination polyhedron of anions forms, in which
the cation-anion distance is determined by the radius sums , and the coordination
number by the radius ratio.
2. In a stable coordination structure the total strength of the bonds which
reach an anion from all neighboring cations, is equal to the charge of the anion.
3. Sharing of edges, and especially faces, between two coordination polyhedra
lowers the stability of the coordination structure. This effect is large for cations
of high charge and small coordination number, and is especially large when the
radius ratio approaches the lower limiting value for the polyhedron.
4. In a crystal which contains different cations, those with high charge and
small coordination number tend not to share elements of their coordination
polyhedra.
5. The number of essentially different kinds of constituents in a crystal tend
to be small (Rule of Parsimony).
PAULINO'S first rule treats structures from the same view point as our previous
discussion. Rules 2-4 give the qualitative conditions for the energetically most
favorable linkage of such polyhedra. For rule 2 it is still necessary to explain
what is meant by the "bond strength " between cations and anions. This is equi-
valent to the charge on the cation divided by the number of neighbors in the
coordination polyhedron. As an example, the fluorite structure (Fig. 151) will
serve to make this clear. In CaF 2 eaeh Ca2+ is surrounded by eight Fl - ions; the
bond strength is consequently i =t. Since each Fl- ion is surrounded by four
Ca +2 ions, 4 X t = 1 "bond strength"
contributions result, equal to the charge
on the Fl - ion.
Polymorphism. Since vibration of lattice constituents changes with tempera-
ture, an ionic arrangement which is thermodynamically more favorable at low
temperature need not be stable at higher temperatures. Thus CsCl, which, in
agreement with its radius ratio of 0.91, possesses at room temperature a structure
with 8-fold coordination, transforms at about 460
0 C into the NaCl-type structure,
with octahedral coordination. The nitrates, carbonates, and borates in Table 7
show very clearly that, with increase in cationic radius, a structural change
takes place, and that in the case of a single compound both structural types are
possible at the transition point. This structural change for a given compound
is called polymorphism, and the different structural types are called polymorphs
or structural modifications.
The calcite structure is most easily described as a deformed NaCI structure,
with one cube-diagonal (3-fold axis) standing perpendicular and with the Cl-
ions replaced by triangular C03 groups lying in planes perpendicular to the

(p. 88) which will be described later. In the calcite structure the Ca2+ ions are
surrounded by six oxygens atoms; in aragonite, by nine .
Polymorphism implies that with the same chemical substance, differences in
structural type can occur as a function of external conditions, such as pressure
and temperature. Depending on the magnitude of the geometrical variation, one
can differentiate the following : polytypism, in which different structural types
are met, as previously discussed; polysyngonism, in which only slight changes
in structure are encountered, as exemplified by the transition of high to low
quartz (Fig. 154)1; a third and less important subdivision, in which the structural
type is completely retained, but in which the structure still undergoes physical
change is called polytropism. The difference in physical behavior results from the
fact that chemically strongly bound complexes in the structure begin to rotate
(or at least distribute themselves statistically over several orientations) above
1 According 1;<) recent investigations by ARNOLD, high quartz is distinguished from low
quartz in that the Iormer consists of the tiniest domains with the structure of low quartz,

0 C (Fig. 155).
It is also manifest by lattice constituents exchanging places in the structure,
without changing structural type. Such examples are referred to later (p. 185).
According to the degree of structural change during such transformations, the
coherence of the crystal may be either preserved or lost. As can be observed with

breaking up into several fragments. In the case of KNOa, on the other hand, the
aragonite structure transforms into the calcite structure upon heating to 128

and the crystal disintegrates in the process. If a transformation results upon
cooling as weIl as heating, it is reversible or enantiotropic (Gr. enantioi, opposite;

0 C, can
be observed. In order to observe the transformation from calcite to aragonite,
higher pressures (approx. 3,000 atmospheres) are necessary. This can be accom-
plished very simply by grinding calcite powder vigorously and for a long time
in a mortar (BURNS and BREDIG; DACHILLE and Rov). Transformation in the
solid state results as a rule in the production of individual nuclei of the new
modification, which then grow (solid state reaction). Additional discussion of
the influence of temperature and pressure on the occurrence of particular struc-
tural types will be given later in the discussion of one-component systems
(p. 183). Frequently in the case of polymorphic phases, the phase which is stable
under normal conditions is designated as the ce-modification; that which is stable
at higher temperatures as the ß-modification; then follows the y-modification,
etc. Since these designations are not completely universal, one often uses, for
substances with two
modifications over different temperature ranges,
the
appropriate expressions, high- or low-temperature modifications.
Isomorphism. Table 7 shows also, that the members of each of the two
carbonate groups have the same structure. The phenomenon of chemically
different substances possessing the same structure, as weIl as the concept of

polymorphism, was diseovered at the beginning of the 19th eentury by EILHARD
MITSCHERLICH. Following the suggestion of BERZELIUS, he ealled this phenomenon
isomorphism. Until the introduetion of X-ray strueture investigation, this eoneept

was based only on the similarity of external erystalline form, aseertained primarily
through angular measurements of erystals. Crystal struetural detcrminations
have in many eases corroborated thc views based on morphological studies, in
many cases not. Thus earlier, zircon, ZrSi04, and rutile, Ti02, were eonsidered
by GROTH to be isomorphous. As a matter of fact, by appropriate choiee of
orientation, both crystal forms
assurne quite similar parameters, but their
structures are different. While in the rutile strueture eaeh Ti is surrounded by
six 0 , and eaeh °by three Ti, in thc case of zireon, Si has four and Zr eight°

Miseibility in the solid state was onee regarded as an especially certain
criterion of isomorphism. One referred also to "impfisomorphism "
(indueed
isomorphism) when one form of a crystal grew from another, and so this eoneept
became inereasingly vague. Today the view is taken that even different structural
types, ean be miscible, and so important distinetions must be suggested by
appropriate terminology. Two substanees with the same structural type are
called isotypes ; with similar type, homotypes; and with differing type, heterotypes.
Miscibility in the solid state infers the same eompletely random distribution of
constituents as does miseibility in fluids . Miscibility will be discussed more fully
later (p. 90 and 195). In the case of miscibility in the solid state, one differen-
tiates, as with fluids , between eomplete and limited miseibility. Independent of
the degree of miseibility, one speaks of isomorphie miseibility in isotypic struotures,
homomorphic in similar structures, and heteromorphie in dissimilar struetures.
An example of the latter is the eomplete miseibility of MgCl2 and LiCI (see p. 91).
The representation of ions as rigid spheres also enables us to understand the
formation of mixed crystals . For the oecurrence of isotypism it is sufficient that

radius ratios are equal, but miscibility requires approximately equal absolute
values of ionic radii. Introduction of foreign ions into a crystal can only take
place if they fit rather well in the struc-
ture. The extent to which the radius of
the foreign ion can deviate from the
ideal depends on temperature and the
type of structure.
Camouflage and Capture. The accom-
modation of foreign ions into a crystal
structure plays an important role in geo-
chemistry. Many elements, like gallium,
form their own compounds only rarely.
They almest always fit into compounds
of other substances. When substitution
ofequivalentionsisinvolved,the process
is referred to as "camouflage". Table 8
shows some examples.
If a lower valence ion is replaced,
one refers to the "capture " of the higher
valence ion in the structure of the lower
valence one. Thus monazite, CeP04,
captures tetravalent thorium in place of
trivalent cerium. The charge balance
is maintained by substituting an equi-
valent amount of divalent Ca for Ce, or
bysubstituting [Si04]4-groupsfora por-
tion of the [P04]3- groups. Some exam-
ples of pairs of elements with equal or
similar ionic radii, but with different
valenee, are assembled in Table 9.
Weshall come back again later to
this business of capture in the discussion
of multicomponent systems (p. 195).
However, it may be mentioned here
that chemical laws, in addition to geometrie considerations, must be fulfilled
in the construction of crystals

2. Transition to Other Bond Types
Polarization, Layer Lattices. The representation of ions as rigid spheres is
very appropriate and useful for many purposes, but it also has its limitations. As
we have already noted in the discussion of coordination number, bond types
other than ionic also assert themselves. As we have seen in Table 6, CdF2, along
with most of the series of alkaline earth halides, crystallizes with the calcium fluoride
structure. If in CdF2, with RA/RB=O.77, the anion is replaced by I, the value
of RA/RB becomes 0.47, and we should expect six-fold coordination, instead

phenomenon is called polarization. The polarization hypothesis was not originally
introduced in crystal chemistry to explain structural anomalies, but was discovered
much earlier in studies of liquids. As a result of polarization, the centers ofionic
positive charge are displaced with respect to the centers of negative charge.
The magnitude of the polarizability can be calculated from spectral or refraction
data. The degree of polarizability increases with ionic radius and is especial1y
strong in the case of ions with complex electron structure. Cd(OH)2 forms a
layer structure of the same type as CdI2, although the "ionic radius " of (OH)l-
is equal to that of Fl-. One can imagine that a smal1 cation such as Cd2+, when
it is brought near a large ion like P-, with only weakly-bound outer electrons,
would pull the electron cloud of the larger anion toward itself. If the electrons
are so strongly attracted that they end up belonging equally to both ions, we pass
from strictly ionic bonding, to homopolar or covalent bonding (Fig. 157).
Ionic (heteropolar or polar) bonding depends on the electrostatic attraction
of oppositely charged particles, upon Coulombic forces. In pure ionic bonding
the electron density between two oppositely charged ions falls to zero. This
can be shown experimentally by means of electron density maps calculated
from X-ray data. Fig.158 shows an electron density map for NaCl. Valence
bonding (homopolar or covalent bonding) depends on chemical valence forces,
and involves mutual sharing of electrons between atoms.
The layer structures represent, therefore, a sort of transition from ionic to
covalent structures. In such layer structures mechanical coherence between
atoms within the layers is stronger than between layers, so that the layers can
easily
cleave
apart.

predominantly covalently bonded together, while entire radioals are linked
ionically by means of cations. In Table 11 the shapes of these complex ions are
indicated.
Just as all carbonates and nitrates contain planar
CO~- or
NO~- groups,
so the SO:- group occurs in all sulfates. In the latter, four oxygens are situated
at the corners of a tetrahedron, with the sulfur atom at its center. The S-O
distance measures about 1.48 ± 0.02A.
Among the sulfate minerals, the structure of barite, BaS04, has a certain
similarity to that of NaCl. Ba2+ ions occur at the positions of the Nal+ ions in
NaCl, and the Cll- ions are replaced by the sulfate groups. Thus eaoh Ba2+ ion
is surrounded by six SO:- groups at approximately equal distanoes. The
coordination number of oxygen around barium is twelve. The mineral celestite,
SrS04, is an isotype of barite. Anhydrite, CaS04, crystallizes however, with a
different structure.
Crystal Chemical Formu1ae. In previous discussion we have already mentioned
the importance of coordination number in relation to the construction of crystals.
Consequently it is useful in crystal chemical discussions to include the coordination
numbers and other important features of the structure in a crystal chemical
formula. Weshall follow the suggestions of MACHATSCHKI and write the coordina-
tion number in brackets to the right of and above each element; in addition we
3
2
1
place before the formula 00, 00, or 00, according to whether we are dealing with
a three-dimensional, a sheet, or a chain-structure, Following the formula, the
crystal system is abbreviated, Some examples of structures which we have
alreadydiscussed may clarify this. In NaCl, for example, eaoh Na1+ is coordinated
with six Cll- and each Cll- with six Na1+ octahedrally. Linkage occurs in a like
manner in all three directions in spaoe. The crystal system is cubic. The crystal
chemical formula thus reads:
3
The following structural formulae are thus self-explanatory : 00 Zn(4) S(4)C (sphaler-
ite) ,
~ Zn(4)S[4)h (wurtzite), ~ Cs(8)CI[8)c (cesium chloride), ~ Ti(6) 02(3)t (rutile),
~ Si(4)02[2]trig (quartz), and ;.. Cd(6)Cl2[3)h (cadmium chloride). As a simplifica-
3
tion in the following discussion, 00 will always be omitted, the type of linkage
only being indicated when we are dealing with a layer- or chain-structure. In
addition we shall usually designate only the coordination number around the
cations.
Structures 01 the Silicates. Structural research in the case of the silicates
finally brought organization to an extraordinary abundance of empirical informa-
tion, All silicate minerals contain Si04-tetrahedra in which the Si-O distance
measures about 1.63± 0.03 A. The Si04-group has a -4 charge. Within this
group the Si-O-bonding is assumed to be about 50% ionic (see Table 10). In the
oase of silicates, an oxygen of the SiOt- tetrahedra is rarely replaced by an
hydroxyl group. One such case is the rare mineral afwillite, Ca~7) [Si(4)03(OH)]2 '
2H 20m.
The silicates are classified according to the manner in which Si04-tetrahedra
are linked to one another. If the tetrahedra are independent, having no common
linking oxygen, and bound through cations to one another, as in the case of
zircon with Zr4+, they are referred to as nesosilicates. Olivine, the mixed crystal

Melanite is a Ti-bearing garnet, similar to andradite, in which the Ti4+ prob-
ably substitutes for Fe3+ with simultaneous charge compensation e.g. by partial
substitution of Na1+for Ca2+.
Of the three modifications of AI2SiOs, kyanite and andalusite are quite clearly
nesosilicates. In both there are two kinds of AP+ ions; one-half is coordinated
octahedrally by six 0 ; the other half in kyanite has likewise 6 fold-, but in anda-
lusite, 5 fold-coordination. Thus the structural formula for kyanite is
Al~6 ] °
[Si04]tr., and for andalusite, Al[6]Al[s]°[Si04]or. It
should
be noted that
5-fold coordination is very rare for Al3+. In the structure of the third modification
of AI2SiOs, sillimanite, half of the aluminium is again coordinated by six oxygens;
the other half, however, has tetrahedral coordination, like silicon. The Si and Al
are not randomly distributed over tetrahedral sites, but are ordered. The crystal
chemical formula for this mineral, emphasizing the mutual tetrahedral association
of Si and Al, is:
]
00 AI[6][AI[4]Si[4]Os]or,
or
Al[6]AI[4]O [Si04]or.
Additional nesosilicates
are
topaz,
Al~6]F2[Si04]or,
sphene,
Ca[7]Ti[4]O
[Si04]m, and staurolite. The latter very probably crystallizes monoclinic, but
with only very slight deviation from orthorhombic symmetry. Its structure,
which is closely retated to that of kyanite, gives the following formula,
Fe~+[4L
AI~6]07(OH)[Si04]4m.
In silicates [Si04]4-tetrahedra can be linked also through oxygens. In minerals
linkage through tetrahedral "corners", rather than "edges"
and " faces ", is
known. If in this way small, discrete units occur in the structure, the silicate is
referred to as a group silicate (sorosilicate). Groups of two tetrahedra characterize
thortveitite,
SC2[Si207]m. Vesuvianite (idocrase) alsocontains such groups,

70
Crystal Chemistry
as well as individual tetrahedra. Its structural formula is C~o(Mg, Fe)~4(OH)4­
[Si04MSi207]2t. According to recent structural determinations, the mineral
epidote is a further example. Its stoichiometric formula is Ca2(Al, Fe)aHSia0la,
but, according to the structural determination, the crystal chemical formula is
written Ca~S-S)(AI, Fe)hS)O(OH) [Si04][Si207]m. As in vesuvianite, isolated Si04-
tetrahedra are found along with Si20 7 groups.
More often several silicate tetrahedra link together through corners forming
rings. Such silicates are called ring silicates (cyclosilicates). Rings of three tetra-
hedra, are found in benitoite, Ba[S-12)Ti[S) [SiaOg]trig.
Fig. 160. Beryl structure with [Sia01s]12- rings
Beryl, AI~S)Beh4)[SiS01S]h, (Fig. 160) is built from groups of six tetrahedra,
which likewise are joined into rings. Each tetrahedron shares an oxygen with
two adjacent ones, giving 18 oxygens instead of 24, in the silicate rings.
In tourmaline, a widely distributed mineral whose chemical composition is
quite complex, SiSalS rings form the characteristic building motil. Its formula is
(Ca, Na) (Al, Mg, Fe2+, Fea+, Mn, Li, o--, ...)hS)[B[a)0a]3 [S~OlS] (OH, F)4 trig. In
a few rare minerals (Si, AI)120ao groups are found, in which two
S~OlS rings are
joined together, forming a double ring, bonded through six oxygens.
Cordierite likewise contains hexagonal rings ; their tetrahedral sites, however,
are only 2/a occupied by Si and l/a by Al. Its crystal chemical formula, emphasiz-
ing the
ring
structure,
is
(Mg, Fe2+)~S)Al~4)Si[4) [Si4Al201S]or.
Reformulation
as (Mg, Fe2+)~S) [SiSAl40JS]or, indicates that it can be classüied also as a framework
structure (p. 74).
As the next silicate group we observe those with contiguous tetrahedra strung
out in rows into infinitely long chains and ribbons (inosilicates). Chains are formed
when each tetrahedra in a row shares an oxygen with a tetrahedron on each side,
These chains continue indefinitely to the terminal boundaries of the individual
crystal. In the case of the chains shown in Fig. 161 the X-ray measured distance
from one silicon to the silicon in the second adjacent tetrahedron is about
5 X 10-7 mm. Thus a fragment of a crystal 1 mm long would contain about
4,000,000 tetrahedra. The Si :° ratio rapidly approaches the value 1: 3 with
growing chain length, as can be ascertained easily by simple calculation. Such
1
00 [SiOa]2- chains occur in minerals of the pyroxene group. Diopside, CaMg[Si20s] '
is a member in which the chains are bound together by Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions.

Earlier the names pyroxene and augite were used synonymously for the
entire mineral group. More recently, the name pyroxene has been adopted for
use as the group name, and augite to designate a sub-group of special pyroxenes,

Mg7(OHMSie022] and Fe7(OHMSis022]; they are called anthophyllite. It should
be mentioned that, analogous to the pyroxenes, the names amphibole and horn-
blende were earlier synonymous. Today amphibole is generally used as a major
group name and hornblende in the restricted sense as defined above.
Hornblende proper frequently contains more than two ions of the size class
of Na1+ and Ca2+ per formula unit. These"excess" cations, along with potassium
ions, are situated in interstices in the structure of Ca2Mgs(OH)2[Sis022]'
Pyroxenes and amphiboles can be differentiated macroscopically by means
of their different cleavage . This occurs in both mineral groups parallel to {1l0},
but the angles (1l0)-(1l0) for pyroxenes and amphiboles are markedly different.
In addition the cleavability of amphiboles is clearly better than that of pyroxenes.
Fig.162 shows, in cross section perpendicular to [001], how the cleavage is related to
structure.

A further example of a chain silicate is wollastonite, 00 Ca~6]Ca[71[Sia09]tr.
1
The
00 [SiOaJ2-chains in this case are quite different from those of the pyroxenes.
Only every fourth tetrahedron in a chain has the same orientation. Accordingly
the lattice constants in the chain direction have approximately one and one-half
times the value of pyroxenes. Wollastonite occurs primarily in contact meta-
morphosed limestones.
If chain after chain is joined together in infinite repetition in one plane, we
arrive at sheet structures or phyllosilicates. These two-dimensional artioulated
six-fold rings are the building motüs for many common silicates. The Si:°ratio
is 2:5, with each tetrahedron sharing three of its oxygens with three other tetra-
hedra.
The most important members of the natural layer silicates are mica-like
2
minerals. The fundamental structural units are pseudo-hexagonal
00 [Si20S]2-
layers, which contain also OH- or F -. Two major groups of layer silicates can be
2
differentiated. In the one case, two
00 OH [Si20S]a- layers are bonded together
2
by a layer of octahedrally coordinated cations. In pyrophyllite,
00 Al~6](OH)2-
[Si4010]m, this intermediate layer consists of Al ions, which are coordinated by
four °and two OH (Fig. 163). By the intercalation of water between such layer
silicate packets, the important clay mineral montmorillonite results, whose

Transition to Other Bond Types

structure will be described later (p. 95). If, in the pyrophyllite structure, 3Mg2+
2
occur in place of 2 AP+, we arrive at the structure of talo, 00 Mg~61(OH)2[Si4010]m.
If one fourth of the Si is replaced by Al in the tetrahedral sheet, the layer
packet AI2(OH)2[AlSia01o]1- becomes negatively charged. In the aluminous
mica, muscovite (Fig. 164), the packets are held together by Kr-ions: in a like
manner, they are held together by Na" in paragonite. In phlogopite, three Mg2+
occur in the octahedrallayer in place of two AP+. In dark-colored biotite, apart
of the Mg is replaced by Fe. In natural crystals, (OH) is partly replaced by F.

The formula for biotite is, therefore, 00 K(Mg,
Fe)~61 (OH, F)2[SiaAI010]m. Pure
fluorphlogopite is produced synthetically from a melt. As HENDRICKS has shown,
one can regard mica as an intergrowth of one or more silicate packets, rotated
or translated with respect to each other in different directions, but in a regular
manner, and stacked one upon the other. Several building motifs can be embodied
in a single crystal. Micas are elastically flexible. Chlorites and brittle-micas are,
on the other hand, plastically deformed upon bending. An exainple of a brittle-
mica is margarite, CaAI2(OHMAI2Si201o], in which two Si are replaced by Al
and the alkali ions by alkaline earths.
In the chlorites, biotite-like {(Mg, Al,

layer are combined together. Kaolinite,
00 AI~61 (OHMSi20S]t r (Fig.165), an
important clay mineral, belongs here. The quite rare minerals dickite and nacrite
have the same chemical formula as kaolinite, but differ structurally from this
mineral in the manner in which the "kaolinite" layers are superimposed.
Serpentine, with a kaolinite-like structure, corresponds rather exactly to the
2
formula 00 Mg&61 (OHMSi20S] ' Its relation to kaolinite is similar to that between
tale and pyrophyllite. Since, however, the "magnesium hydroxide" layer does
not have exactly the same dimensions as the Si20S layer, -
it is somewhat too

large - it is deformed, either into a tubular structure (in which case one speaks
of fibrous serpentine or chrysotile), or into the corrugated structure displayed
by platy serpentine or antigorite. The atomic arrangement of chrysotile is not
three-dimensionally periodic and accordingly does not correspond to a typical
crystal structure. In the case of antigorite well-ordered crystals are extremely
rare. Usually the structure is strongly distorted.
Finally, if, in a structure each tetrahedron shares each of its oxygens with
four adjacent tetrahedra, a framework structure or tectosilicate results. The
(Si, AI):O ratio is now 1:2. The most important representatives are the feldspars

~ Na[Al[4]Si&4]Oa] and anorthite ~ Ca[Al~4]Si~4]Oa]. In the case of the K-feld-
spars we can distinguish two modifications based on their structure and optics:
a monoclinic modification, sanidine (Fig. 166), and a triclinic, but distinctly
pseudomonoclinic modification, microcline. The two forms of KAlSia0a differ
in construction primarily in that in sanidine the Si and Al atoms are randomly

distributed over the centers of the tetrahedra, while in microcline they are ordered.
The lowering of symmetry from monoclinic to triclinic is connected with this
ordering. Sanidine is the high temperature modification (its stability field lies
somewhat above 700
0 C). Mierocline is the low temperature modification (it is
stable at normal temperatures). The transition between the two modifications
does not take place, however, at a precise temperature, or as easily as the transition

76
Crystal Chemistry
encountered in the case of quartz. On the contrary, the transition is exceedingly
sluggish. This is not surprising, since a much more drastic rearrangement in
structure is necessary than that eneountered in the inversion between high and
low quartz. In order for sanidine to invert to microcline, or vice versa, the Si and
Al atoms in the framework must be able to change places, which requires a high
activation energy. Thus it is not surprising that the high temperature modification
of K-feldspar, sanidine, is preserved in rocks, whereas high quartz is not. This is
true, for example, in trachytes, where crystals were cooled too suddenly for the
transition to microcline to take place. Although microcline is found in rocks, it is
usually finely polysynthetically twinned, like plagioclase, after both the "albite "
and "pericline " laws (see p.97). It has
been inferred that the crystals first
formed as monoclinic and that later transformation took place which led to this
fine microcline grid twinning. This does not necessarily mean that the presence
of a particular feldspar is indioative that it formed within its stability field, for
example, above about 700
0 C. Under certain circumstances it may have grown
metastably at a lower temperature. This is very important to remember when
attempting to make genetic inferences. Orthoclase is an optically and morpho-
logically monoclinic species of K-feldspar which occurs in intrusive rocks. Accord-
ing to its form development and optical constants, it is a completely different
K-feldspar from sanidine. X-ray investigations have shown that orthoelase is
not a distinct phase, as are sanidine and microcline. From the structural stand-
point, it is a transition state between these two modifications, with intermediate
states of ordering of Si and Al and submicroscopic twinning.
With the plagioclases we must distinguish also, as with the K-feldspars,
between high and low temperature members. This was first recognized from
carefuloptical studies (for example, A. KOEHLER). Here also the high temperature
modification of plagioelase has a statistical distribution of Si and Al in its frame-
work, and the low temperature modification an ordered distribution. The relation,
ships here are still more complicated than with the K-feldspars. This is because-
in the plagioclase " mixed crystal series", the one end-member (anorthite),
relative to the other (albite), has a doubled unit cell, There occurs for NaAlSisOs
below the melting point a third monoclinic high temperature modification
(monalbite) in addition to the triclinic low temperature modification (common
albite) and the triclinic high temperature modification (analbite). It is assumed
that in monalbite, as weIl as in analbite, the Si and Al are statistically dis-
tributed over the tetrahedral sites. Transformation from pure monalbite to
analbite takes place with the ease of high to low quartz inversion, and it can be
concluded that this is connected only with deformation of the lattice, not with
its rearrangement. As a result of the reversibility of this transformation, potassium
free monalbite does not occur as a mineral.
Mixed crystal formation between K-feldspar and anorthite is very limited
and of little mineralogical importance. On the other hand K-feldspar can accept
larger amounts of the albite " molecule" into its strueture. There is at high
temperature a eomplete mixed crystal series between sanidine and monalbite. If
members of this series, whose eompositions do not lie elose to that of the end
members, are eooled slowly, unmixing to Na-rieh and K -rieh eomponents takes
place in the solid state. Such unmixed or exsolved K-Na feldspars are ealled
perthites. It is customary to speak of these as perthites Ü, in one individual with
predominant K-feldspar (host) , an exsolved Na-feldspar phase (guest) occurs
(" albite-spindles"); in the eorresponding opposite case one speaks of anti-perthite.
With the plagioelases also there is limited miscibility at low temperatures.
Unmixing can occur under certain eircumstances (for example, sufficiently slow

Transition to Other Bond Types
77
cooling). This leads not only to separation of two feldspars near to the end
members in composition, but also to other especially stable members.
Such an example is plagioclase with about 5-20% anorthite. One can
recognize "low temperature crystals ", which can be shown to be unmixed by
X-ray investigation. One component is essentially pure albite, the other a
plagioclase with about 25 % anorthite. The unmixing is always on an extremely
fine scale and frequently produces an iridescent play of colors. Such plagioclase
is referred to as peristerite.
The picture given here of the feldspars is still deficient in many points, but
should suffice for a first impression of the extent of the existing problems. That
the framework structure of the feldspars results from the three-dimensional
linkage of Si04 and AI04 tetrahedra through the corners, was first recognized
by MACHATSCHKI on the basis of general silicate constructional principles.
Important studies by BARTH followed. The first structural determination of a
member of this mineral family, that of sanidine, was carried out by W. H . TAYLOR
in 1933. F. LAVES and his co-workers, as well as others, have concerned them-
selves in recent years with the very important concept of order-disorder pheno-
mena in feldspars. Much of this discussion has followed his work.
The jeldspathoids belong also to the tectosilicate group. These minerals occur
in place of, or frequently along with, the feldspars, in alkali and aluminum rich
eruptive rocks. The most important of these are the morphologically cubic leucite,
3
3
00 K[AlS~06] and the hexagonal-pyramidal nepheline,
00 Na[AISi04]h; in the
latter one-fourth of the sodium is frequently replaced by potassium, in such a
way that the Na" ions and K+ ions are not randomly distributed, but lie ordered
3
in the cavities of the 00 [AlSi04]- framework. The correct formula for this nepheline
3
is, therefore,
00 NaaK[Si4AI4016]h.
Additional members of the tectosilicate group are pollucite, Cs[AlS~06]H20C,
a rare cesium silicate, and the zeolites, open-packed aluminosilicate structures
in whose pores in the structure, loosely bound water as well as alkali and
alkaline earth ions are situated (see p. 79). Examples of naturally occuring
3
zeolites are the fairly common minerals analcite,
00 Na[AISi206] . H20c and
3
natrolite,
00 Na2[Al2Si30lO] .2H20or.
The various Si02 modifications also have
three-dimensional framework
structures of Si04 tetrahedra. These are quartz, tridymite, cristobalite, and kea-
tite and the high pressure modification coesite. The stability fields of quartz,
tridymite, cristobalite, and coesite will be dealt with later (see p. 186).
The highest pressure modification of Si02, stishovite, has a rutile-type
3
structure (see p. 51), not a
00 [Si[4]02]·framework structure.
A beautiful example, illustrative that the formula-type [(Si, Al)[4]02Y· does
not necessarily indicate a three-dimensional framework structure, is exhibited
by the hexagonal modification of Ca]Al~4]Si~4JOs].
This phase has the same
chemical formula as anorthite. A structural determination has shown that the
Al as well as Si is tetrahedrally coordinated by four oxygens and that these are
linked through corners. However, the structure is not a tectosilicate, but is more
closely related to the micas, If one superimposes two Si20S sheets, so that apical
oxygens are common to both sheets, a two-dimensional infinite double layer
2
00 [Si[4]02] occurs. The hexagonal modification of Ca[AI2Si20s] contains such
double layers as its usual structural unit, except that one-half of the Si ions

78
Crystal Chemistry
are replaced by Al. To maintain charge balance, Ca2+ ions occur between these
double sheets, and link them together in a manner analogous to the micas .
lUodel Structures. It has often been mentioned that in silicates Si can be
replaced in part by Al, if corresponding additional cation substitution is provided
for to maintain electrical neutrality. There are also isotypes of silicate compounds
in which all of the Si is replaced by Al or another element, in particular by
P
and
As.

utilized to build model structures. Li2BeF4 can serve as a model for Zn2[Si04],
willemite. Table 12 shows that lattice parameters of these two compounds are

quite similar. Those physical properties of fluoroberyllates, such as melting
point, optics, and hardness, which depend on the oharge of the lattice constituents,
are corresponding diminished with lower charge. Such models can be technically
useful. For example, in order to draw conclusions about compounds which might
have very high melting points, this approach has been fruitfully applied in cement
research. Weshall at this point go no further into the relation between crystal
structure and physical properties, but shall refer to this later in the appropriate
discussion of crystal physics.
Structural (OB). In concluding our discussion of the silicates, we should
make mention of the hydroxyl and water content of crystals. Hydroxyl-containing
layers play an important role in many silicates. In our discussion of the CdI2
structure, we have already referred to the strong polarizability of the OH ion.
In most hydroxides, such as Ca(OHh, this leads to the formation of layer lattices.
Ca(OH)2 has a layer structure analogous to CdI2 (see Fig. 156), in which the

Transition to Other Bond Types
79
oxygen ions occupy the positions of the I atoms in CdI2. Hydrogen atoms have
been shown from neutron diffraction (see p. 160) to be only 0.96 A distant from
the oxygen nucleus and so arranged that they are as far distant as possible from
the calcium ions. In this way each oxygenis surrounded by the tetrahedral coordina-
tion of one hydrogen and three calcium ions from the CdI2 type cation layer.
Many hydroxides of divalent elements, such as Mn(OH)2' CO(OH)2' Mg(OH)2
(brucite) and others, have the same or at least very similar structure. In crystal
structures the hydrogen can cause oxygens to approach each other more closely
than is customary. Diaspore, AI[6lO(OH) or (Fig.167) is an example in which
hydrogen is located, practically on the connecting line between two oxygens
but not midway between them. The 0-0 separation is only 2.65 A, compared
to the 0 -0 distance in MgO of 2.98 A. Such an OH-0 interaction is called
a hydrogen bond. Gibbsite (hydrargillite), AI[6](OH)3m (Fig.168), a common
constituent of bauxite, in addition to the above mentioned hydroxides, possesses
a typical layer structure. So does the fibrous iron ore goethite, <x-FeO(OH). The
rarer mineral lepidocrocite, 'Y-FeO(OH), has a different orthorhombic structure.
Structural Water (H20). The crystals with which we have been concerned
above are hydroxides or substances which contain hydroxyl groups and it would
be incorrect to write the formula for diaspore as Al203. H20 . There are, however,
many crystals which contain water moleeules as such . We can divide these into
two different groups.

In one group, water cannot be driven off without destroying the crystal
structure. This becomes evident microscopically from the development of turbi-
dity or opacity in the crystal. All of those compounds which are customarily

(From PAULING)
designated as hydrous salts belong to this group. Examples are chalcanthite,
CuS04 . 5H20, and natron, Na2COa · 10H20. One refers in this connection
to crystal water. Often all or at least a greater part of the crystal water is especially
strongly bound to the cation and called, therefore, cation water. An example is
bischofite, MgCI2 • 6H20, in which the
six water molecules form an octahedral
complexwiththe magnesium.Therefore,
its crystal ehemical formula should be
written [Mg[61(H20)6]CI2m. In chalcan-
thiteonly four ofthefive water molecules
are cation water. These four form a
square planar complex with copper, giv-
ing thestructural formula [Cu[41(H20)4J-
S04·H20tr. In gypsum, CaS04·2H20,
each Ca2+ is coordinated by six oxy-
gens of the sulfate groups and two water
moleeules.
The atomic
arrangement
forms well defined layers parallel to
(010). This planeis also a perfectcleavage
plane. The individual two-dimensional
layers have the same formula as the
complete mineral, CaS04 . 2H 20 . The
layers are held together by means of
hydrogen bonds.
In the other group of hydrous crys-
tals, the water can be driven off without
the structure breaking down. Such crys-
tals are called zeolites. In them thewater
is bound loosely to the walls of oanals in a framework structure. The zeolites are
almest without exception silicates. In zeolites the water can be removed by
heating and can also be replaced by other molecules, such as alcohols, NHa,
and Hg. These fit into holes in the structure without essentially changing the
atomic arrangement of the framework. Many zeolites, because of this property,
are of technical interest as "molecular sieves " . In addition to the water in zeolites,
loosely bound cations, usually alkali ions or Ca2+, are situated in the canals. These
can be readily exchanged by other ions, giving them the important property of
eation exchange. We have already on page 77 become familiar with two examples
of zeolites.
In this connection a few words should be devoted to ice. Its structure is
illustrated in Fig. 169. We can deseribe the geometrie arrangement of the oxygens
in iee, by indieating that in a wurtzite-type lattiee (Fig. 150) the positions of
Zn as well as the S atoms are oeeupied by oxygen. Geometrie similiarity also
oeeurs relative to the strueture of tridymite. If we plaee Si at the positions of
the oxygen in iee and 0 at the positions of hydrogen (the latter being at the
same time moved to the midpoint between two Si atoms), we arrive at the ideal
tridymite strueture. Ice forms a moleeular strueture eontaining the same H 20
moleeules as in water or in water vapor. The O-H distanee measures somewhat
less than 1.00 A, as it does in the OH group. The H-O-H angle is cIose to the
tetrahedral angle, namely 104
0
• While the arrangement of the oxygens is strietly
periodie, this is not the ease for the hydrogen atoms, sinee the H 20 moleeules
are oriented randomly over different possible orientations. The H atoms lie on
or near the eonneeting line between two oxygen atoms, as shown iu Fig. 169.

Covalent Bonding

3. Covalent Bonding
In theforegoing exampIes we have been concerned with ionic or predominantly
ionic bonding. We have, however, repeatedly mentioned that this form of

sponding to a temperature of 5,000°. (From BRILL, GRIMM, HERMANN, PETERS.) (b) Diamond
struc ture in analogous orientation near [110]
bonding does not always occur in its purest form , but that there are transitions,
especiaIly to covalent bonding. We can say the same of homopolar or covalent
bonding. This form of bonding is displayed in its purest form by diamond,
3
00 C [4]C. Its structure is that of sphalerite, in which the Zn as weIl as the S
positions are occupied by equivalent C atoms, each C atom being surrounded
tetrahedraIly by four others. Accordingly the lattice constant ao decreases from
5.40 A (ZnS) to 3.57 A. Fig. 170a shows that the eleetron density is high between
the C atoms arranged in non-planar puckered six-fold rings. As indicated in
Fig. 170a, the electron density along the line from atom C to the underlying atom
does not decrease as much (namely to 4.90 e.A-2 at point A) as along the line
to the atoms above to the right and left (1.84 e.A-2 at point D) . This is, however,
6
Correns, Mineralogy

82
Crystal Chemistry
an effect of the projection, as can be readily scen by comparison with Fig . 170b.
In the void spaces in the structure the electron density drops off essentially to
zero. This structure and bonding is typical also of the other elements of the
fourth row of the period table, Si, Ge, and Sn (gray tin). The four valence
electrons are always distributed toward the corners of a tetrahedron, toward
neighboring atoms, so that two electrons are contributed for each atom. It is,
however, not necessary for an equal number of bonding electrons to be provided
by both atoms. It is sufficient that both together contribute four. An example
is sphalerite, ZnS , already mentioned on p. 58, in which the atomic positions
of the diamond structure are occupied half by Zn and half by S, so that each S
is surrounded by four Zn and vice versa. Additional examples are CuBr, ZnSe,
GaAs, AgI , CdTe, and InSb. In some of these compounds the influence of metallic
bonding is asserted, while others like sphalerite (see p. 67) form transitions to
ionic bonding.
We have already referred (p. 68) to the contribution of covalent bonding
in complex ions or radicals. Covalent bonding is especially important in organic
chemistry, for it is this type of bonding which is effective within organic molecules.
In recent years very important contributions have been made by application
of X-ray structural investigations. We cannot go into these in detail here, In
addition to the exact determination of inter-atomic distances and angles, which
is just as critical in organic as in inorganic chemistry for elucidating questions
of bonding, crystal structure analysis is becoming also increasingly important
in the constitutional elucidation of organic molecules. The determination of
structural arrangements of extremely complex proteins has already been highly
successful.
4. Intermolecular Bonding
In many crystals forces are active, analogous to those which occur between
molecules in fluids . The resultant bonding is referred to as van der Waals or
intermolecular bonding.
The elements of the VI and VII rows of the periodic table form inorganic
molecular crystals exhibiting intermolecular bonding. A rule has been established
for the structures of these semi- and non-metallic elements, which states that
eaeh element has in its structure as many neighboring atoms in nearest coordina-
tion as there are electrons lacking in thc octet of the outer electron shell. If the
number of electrons is n, then the number of neighbors is (8-n) . According to
this " octet rule" I should have only one neighbor, and in fact the I structure
is built of 12 diatomic molecules. If we indicate the outer eight electrons by means
of dots, we obtain the picture:
:1:1:
Each I atom is then surrounded by an octet of electrons as in the inert gases.
In the iodine molecule we are dealing with covalent bonding. These diatomic
molecules are held together in the solid state by means of intermolecular forces.
In the case of selenium and tellurium, where two electrons are lacking in the
octet, essentially infinite structural chains result :

S8 rings . In As, which has three missing electrons, a layer structure occurs. The
structure can be considered also as a simple cubic structure which has been stretched
along a cube diagonal. Of the six neighbors of each As atom, three are more
strongly bonded to it and hence form layers perpendicular to the three-fold
2
axis, that is, parallel to (0001). The crystal-chemical formula is
00 As[31h. 'I'he
same structure is less clearly expressed with antimony and bismuth. With four
missing electrons, we get a three-dimensional structure with four-fold coordina-
tion, like diamond, which can only be bonded together by covalent bonding.
This is the typeof bonding existing within the diatomic molecules, chains, rings,
and ribbons. These units are in turn held together by means of intermolecular
or van der Waals forces, which in the case of Se, Te, As, Sb, and Bi show
transition to metallic bonding.
5. Metallic Bonding
Pure Metals. We come now to another form of bonding, the metallic bond. It
has been concluded from the electrical conductivity of metals (RIECKE, 1898),
that essentially free and mobile elec-
trons occur
between positive metal
ions in metal crystals. These free elec-
trons act as a kind of electron gas. Elec-
tron density determinations have estab-
lished this hypothesis in the case of
Mg. Although metals play only a sub-
ordinate role as minerals, we shall briefly
discuss the types of metal structures
because of their great importance in
understanding the nature of crystals.
Let us recall the coordination struc-
tures of ionic compounds of the type
AB. There the highest coordination
number was eight, as in cesium chloride.
A higher mutual coordination is geo-
metrically impossible in AB-type com-
pounds. However, if the crystal is built
of only one type of element, a twelve-
fold coordination can be attained. The
crystal structure with 12-coordination
correspondsto the elosest packing of like
spheres. A planar arrangement of elose
packed spheres has each sphere in contact with six others. In order to propagate
elosest packing in three dimensions, we must superimpose such elosed packed planar
layers one upon the other so that spheres in one layer always lie in the depressions
in the adjacent layer. In superimposing a third layer one has two choices of orienta-
tion. We can place it either over those depressions which cause the spheres in
the third layer to lie directly over those of the first layer, or the third layer can
be placed over an alternate set of depressions. H, during the stacking of layers,
the fourth layer is the first to lie directly over the initiallayer (Fig . 171), such
packing is called, cubic closest packing . It corresponds to a cubic face-centered
lattice (Fig.140g, p.51) which , because of our method of construction, stands with
one of its cube diagonals perpendicular to the layers. Fig. 172 shows that the
6*

84

closest packed planar layers are parallel to the octahedral plane. In cubic elosest
packing the coordination polyhedron is the cubooctahedron (Fig. 173).
Fig. 172. Cubic closest packing, showing the face-centered nature of the resulting lattice.
That arrangement, in which it is
the third superimposed layer which first
lies directly over the initial layer, is
called hexagonalclosestpacking(Fig.174).
By means of other repetitions of elose
packed layers many " elose packed "
types can arbitrarily be produced. The
cubic and the normal hexagonal elosest
Fig. 173. Cubooctahedron

packing are widely distributed in metals. The following metals crystallize in
cubic elosest packing :
Ag, AI, Au, «Ca, «Ce, «Co, Cu, yFe, Ir, ßLa, aNi, Pb , Pd, ßPr, Pt, aRh, ßSc, Sr, Th, aTI, Yb.

Hexagonal closest packing can also be described as two
interpenetrating
hexagonallattices with the axial ratio co:ao ",-,1.63. The following metals crystallize
with this arrangement :
Be, ßCa, Cd, ßCe, ßCo, Cp, ßCr, Dy, Er, Gd, Hf, Ho, ~La, Mg, Nd, ßNi, Os, ~Pr, Re, Ru,
ceSc, Tb, Tc, ~Ti, ßTl, Tm, Y, Zn, ~Zr.
Almost all of the remaining metals crystallize with a cubic body-centered
lattice (Fig. 140f, p. 51) with the coordination number 8:
Ba, «Cr, Cs, Eu, ~Fe, K, Li, Mo, Na, Nb, Rb, ßRh, Ta, ßTi, V, W, ßZr.
In the two types of closest packing, 74.1% of space is filled; in the cubic
body-centered structure it is somewhat less, but always more than in the simple
cubic atomic arrangements annotated in Table 13.

Comparison of the paeking arrangements of Table 13 with the structures of
metals indicates that there is apparently a tendeney for the most highly symme-
trical structures to form and for space to be filled as completely as possible.
Alloys. Similar tendencies are also prevalent among the metal alloys, which
are teehnically so important. If two metals are melted together, the two metals
may not mix in the solid state, but instead separate into pure crystals of each
of the constituents (see p. 188). However, the original metals may not separate
out of the melt, but instead form alloys. In this ease there are two possibilities.
The first is that mixed crystals form . These are to be expected when the atomic
radii are
sufficiently similar and similar bonding properties prevail. Mixed
crystals have arbitrary and non-constant chemical composition and the two
constituents are randomly distributed in the structure. True mixed crystals are
formed, for example, when we melt together gold and silver. In nature gold is
almost always silver- bearing. If the silver content reaches more than 25 % ,
the natural alloy is called electrum. The other possibility of changing the
constituents of metals is by the formation of a compound between the two
partners. This is a common occurrence in the case of ionic crystals, such as salts,
because each compound corresponds to adefinite stoichiometric composition.
In the case of metal compounds, in a certain sense transitional states occur
between compounds and mixed crystals, since the crystals which form often have
no exactly defined chemical formula, but vary in their composition, showing a
considerable latitude therein.
Following LAVES, we shall refer in metallic systems to mixed crystals when
one of the partners accepts the other into its structure, and to a compound when
a new structure is formed. This is also a crystallographic and non-chemical
definition of a compound. Often a compound state exists only over adefinite
temperature range. Gold and copper, for example, behave like true mixed crystals
in all proportions only at higher temperatures, and with random distribution of

the two kinds of atoms in a cubic-face-centered lattice. Upon sudden cooling,
this arrangement is retained. If cooling takes place slowly, the atoms arrange
themselves into a phase with the composition AuCu3 , so that a "superstructure"
is formed with Cu at the cube corners and Au at the centers of the faces. AuCu3
is a compound and behaves electrically and mechanically quite different from
the suddenly cooled mixed crystal. Upon heating, and the addition of energy,
the energetically most favorable state disappears and the disordered state
corresponding to the mixed crystal appears. Such relations are common among
intermetallic phases. With ionic and covalent compounds, on the other hand,
the structural order is as a rule maintained up to the melting point.
The Hume-Rothery Rule. We shall now mention two important generaliza-
tions with regard to compound formation in metallic systems. The Hume-
Rothery rule states that the structural type depends on the ratio of the number
of valence electrons to the number of atoms in the compound. The metals of
the VIII group of the periodie table must be considered as having zero valence
electrons. The three structural types which occur are indicated in Table 14,
along with some examples.

The Hume-Rothery rule is not without exceptions, and it has as yet no
satisfactory theoretical explanation.
The diamond structure can be considered, from a purely formal standpoint,
as a special case of this rule . The ratio of valence electrons to atoms .is 4 :1.
Laves Phases. While the above-mentioned compounds depend upon the
number of valence electrons, other groups are formed exclusively by geometrie
relationships. These are compounds of the type A B 2, and are designated as
"Laves phases". More than 60 such compounds are already known. Three types
may be differentiated having the MgCu2, MgZn2, and MgNi2 structures. Of
these MgCu2 merits detailed description (Fig. 175). The structure exhibits atomic
properties which, from an energetic standpoint, could not occur in normal ionic
compounds.
In MgCu2 the Mg atoms are surrounded by twelve Cu atoms (four Mg atoms
are located at only about 4 % greater distance). The structure is, however,
constructed so that each Cu atom has as nearest neighbors other Cu atoms, and
six additional dissimilar neighbors (Mg)are found at about a 17% greater distance.
The Cu-Cu distance in MgCu2 is 2.49 A, quite similar to that in elemental
Cu (2.55 A). Also the Mg-Mg distance is not very different from that in metallic
Mg. The geometrie arrangement of the Cu atoms is like that in elemental Cu
except that a portion of the Cu atoms is missing. The structure has an additional

noteworthy geometrical property: if one imagines it to be built of spheres which

as the Cu arrangement inMgCu2 is simi-
lar to cubic closest packing, so does
Mg Zn2 possess analogous similarities to
hexagonal elosest packing. Here the Zn
atoms possess in part this atomic ar-
rangement. MgNi2 displays a sort of mix-
ed structure between MgCu2and MgZn2•
Transition to Other Bond Types. Just
as there are transitions between ionic
and covalent bonding, there are also
transitions between metallic and ionic or
covalent bonding. When metals of the first three groups of the periodie table
form compounds with those of the IV to VII groups, these show, in spite of their
metallic appearance, transition to ionic bonding. For example, these compounds
are soluble in liquid NH3 and possess a noticeable electrical conductivity in
solution. They act in NH3 as normal salts do in water. Examples of such compounds
are Mg2Sn and Mg2Pb, which crystallize with the fluorite structure. Thus they
are also structurally similar to ionic compounds.
A structural type which is not found among purely ionic compounds is that
of NiAs, niccolite. This structure can be most simply described as a hexagonal
elose packing of As atoms in which the Ni atoms are intercalated in the inter-
stices. In a elose packed array there are two kinds of interstices, those with
,,,

octahedral and those
with tetrahedral coordination. As can
be
discerned
immediately from Fig. 176, the number of octahedral sites is equal to the number
of packed spheres; the number of tetrahedral sites is twice this number. In NiAs
all of the octahedral interstices formed from the hexagonal elosest packing of
As atoms are occupied by Ni. While in cubic closest packing the atoms in octa-
hedralsites are arranged likewise in a cubic elose packed array, in the structure
of NiAs the octahedral sites lie in chains in the direction of the hexagonal axis
(Fig. 177). It can be demonstrated that along this chain direction metallic
bonding occurs between Ni atoms, while the coherence between the As- and
Ni-atoms may be dependent predominantly upon covalent bonding.

This sort of accommodation of Ni atoms in the interstices of a elose packed
network helps us to understand an unusual phenomenon exhibited by pyrrhotite,
Fe8. It has long puzzled analytical chemists and mineralogists, that in this
mineral the stoichiometric ratio Fe :8 is not exactly 1:1. Accordingly we find
in older mineralogical books, compositional descriptions such as Fe10811' as well
as others. It was formerly believed that an excess of 8 could be accommodated
in the structure (to 6%), but X-ray investigations have indicated that a
deficiency of Fe actually occurs. The 8 packing, therefore, remains stable even
when not all the octahedral sites are filled with Fe. Unlike the NiAs type, stoichio-
metric Fe8 at room temperature is easily deformed and possesses a larger unit
cell, In addition, iron sulfides of composition Fe1_x8 (x ~ 0.15) occur as super-
structures of the ideal NiAs structure, as a result of an ordered arrangement
of the Fe atoms and the vacancies in the structure.
Another important sulfide structure is that of stibnite, 8b 283. Its structure
is very much more complicated than that of NiAs. We can best perceive its
structure if we first consider only those 8b-8 distances which are less than
2.70 A. Each Sb atom is coordinated by three 8 atoms in a pyramid in which
the average 8-8b-8 angle is 90°. The 8b83 pyramids are linked together
1
into 00 [8b~3l83] ribbons, as illustrated in Fig. 178. Two such ribbons lie together
in the structure in such a manner that one 81 of one chain and two 8bn
of

a second chain always approach at a distance of 2.82 A. This is not much greater
than the greatest distance within the double chain itself (2.68 A) and certainly
must indicate weak chemical bonding. By emphasizing this additional bonding,
the structure can be viewed as consisting of quadruple ribbons in which one half
of the Sb atoms possess a pyramidal 3-fold S coordination and the other half
a (3+ 2) coordination. The antimony with [3+ 2] coordination sits approximately
at the center of the base of a square pyramid formed by S atoms. 'I'he crystal

00 Sb[3)Sb[3+2]S30r.
2
Molybdenite,
00 MO[6)S2h, crystallizes with a typical layer structure, with
covalent bonding within the layer. The coordination polyhedron is, however,
not an octahedron, as we have always imagined 6-fold coordination, but a
trigonal prism.
The pyrite structure, Fe[6] [S2]C, is geometrically derived from the NaCI
structure, in that Fe atoms are fitted into the positions of sodium ions and
dumbbell-shaped S2 moleeules into the positions of the chlorine ions. As a result,
the usual symmetry planes of the NaCI lattice are destroyed and only glide
planes parallel to the cube faces remain. Morphologically these appear as normal
symmetry planes. The bonding is predominantly covalent with a definitely
metallic contribution.
6. Summary 01 Bond Types
In summary we want to make clear again that there are not only the pure
ionic, covalent, intermolecular, and metallic bond types in crystals, but, as we
have seen, also various deviations therefrom. These deviations are manifest
in two different ways.
First of all there are transitions between the main bond types themselves.
For example, transitions between ionic and covalent bonding are found in the
Si-O bonding in silicates and probably in the Zn-S bonding in sphalerite.
Transitions between metallic and covalent or ionic bonding occur in NiAs,
niccolite, or in PbS, galena. The crystal structure of PbS corresponds to NaCI,
but the metallic luster of PbS
shows that the bonding cannot be purely
ionic.
In addition to transitions between bond types, different bond types occur
in crystals at different locations within the same crystal. A distinct example of
this is displayed by orthorhombic sulfur. Within the S8 rings covalent bonding
prevails; between these rings, van der Waals bonding. In silicates we find that
the Si-O bond is transitional between ionic and covalent. Linking Si-O
assemblages together are cations which, in many cases (Na1+, K1+, Mg2+, Ca2+,
Ba2+, as weIl as others) exhibit essentially electrostatic bonding. In pyrite, FeS2,
the S-S distance in the S2group is almost exactly the same as in the S8moleeule,
namely about 2.1 A, indicating that the S-S bond is covalent. Based on its
electrical conductivity it must be concluded that metallic bonding is prevalent
in the structure of pyrite.
The problems of chemical bonding are still far from being completely solved.
Unfortunately the usual structure determination gives only interatomic distances
and thus infers only indirectly the type of bonding. It is of great importance,
therefore, to combine crystal structural results with other physical methods
(electrical conductivity, absorption spectroscopy, magnetic measurements, etc .),
to discern the true nature of bonding within crystals.

Crystal Chemistry
7. Crystal Structures as Packed Spheres
In our discussion of metals, as well as the NiAs-type structures, we have
referred to the elosest packing of spheres. This concept can be put to good
advantage also to describe a number of other structural types, especially if we
allow a certain amount of distortion from ideal packing. The NaCI structure
can be described as cubic elosest packed, in which all octahedral sites are occupied.
In the ideal case the A ions (atoms) would be in contact with the B ions (atoms)
and the B ions likewise in contact with each other. The radius ratio RAIRB would
be exactly 0.41. In NaCI itself the radius ratio is 0.54. The Cl ion packing is
expanded, contrary to the ideal case. In addition to aseries of halides, oxides,
and sulfides (NaBr, MgO, MgS), TiC, TiN, ZrC and ZrN possess this type of
structural packing. In the latter, N or C is situated in the octahedral sites in the
cubic elosest packed array of Ti or Zr. If only one half of the octahedral sites
are occupied and in layers parallel to an octahedral face, the MgCl2-type structure
results. The " cubic elose packing" of the anions is rhombohedrally distorted in
this structure. In an analogous manner the CdI 2-type structure is derived from
a hexagonal elose packed array. Sometimes only a fourth of the octahedral
interstices are occupied, as in Mn4N and Fe4N. Formally the CaF2 structure
can be described, by noting that the Ca2+ ions form a cubic face centered lattice,
corresponding to cubic elose packing, with the F - ions situated in the tetrahedral
sites. It is to be noted, however, that the Ca2+ ions cannot be in contact with
each other, since the F- ions are much too large to fit into the interstices of a
elose packed array of Ca2+ ions. This description fits much better the structure
of Li20, crystallizing analogous to CaF2, except that cations and anions have
exchanged places (antifluorite structure) giving the structural formula
Li~4]0[81c.
The small Li" ions sit in the tetrahedral interstices of a cubic elose packed 0 2-
array. If, in a cubic elose packed array, only one-half of the tetrahedral sites
are occupied, with retention of the highest possible symmetry, the ZnS (sphalerite)
structure results. In order to avoid misunderstanding, it should be expressly
stated that this arrangement, involving like size spheres in contact with each
other is not elosest packing, but quite open packing. A hexagonal elose packing
with half of the tetrahedral sites filled corresponds to the structure of wurtzite
(ZnS).
If both types of interstices in a cubic elose packed array are occupied by
cations, we can arrive at the spinel-type structure,
Mg[41AI~6]04c. Here one-
eighth of the tetrahedral sites, corresponding to one-fourth of the oxygen ions,
are filled by Mg, and one-half of the octahedral sites by Al. It is noteworthy
that the smaller Al-ions are situated in the octahedral, and the larger Mg-ions
in the tetrahedral interstices.
Olivine, (Mg, Fe)~6] [Si04]or, can be considered to a first approximation as
a somewhat deformed and expanded hexagonal elose packed array of oxygen.
In it the densest packed planes lie in the plane (010). The Si atoms are found
in the tetrahedral sites, which are one-eighth occupied, and the Mg or Fe ions
occupy half of the octahedral sites.
8. Deviations from Ideal Crystals
Defects. While the geometrie theory of 230 space groups pictures the crystal
as a completely ordered struoture, the previous discussion of real structures, has
already shown that this ideal picture is not quite correct.

In mixed crystals we have insisted that a random distribution of constituents
occurs. This alone implies disorder. The example, FeS, illustrates a further kind
of disorder, namely incomplete occupancy of equivalent lattice points. In this
structure the Fe atoms are not periodically repeated on the atomic scale. In the
spinels it has been shown that, in addition to the normal spinel mentioned earlier,
there is also a second type of cation distribution which has been found, for
example, in MgGaZ04. In this spinel one-half of the Ga3+ ions are situated
in tetrahedral sites; the remainder along with the Mgz+ ions are situated in the
octahedral sites, and indeed the two types of ions are not situated in definite
locations,
but are
randomly distributed. The
appropriate crystal chemical
formula is as follows:
~ Ga[4l(Ga, Mg)~6l04C . The same phenomenon is found
3
with magnetite,
00 Fe3+[4l(Fe3+, FeZ+)~6l04C.
The spinels form mixed crystals
with the y-modification of Alz03. 'I'his, like spinel, possesses cubic elosest packing.
The unit cell contains 32°ions. In place
of the 24 cation sites per unit cell of
spinel (16AI8Mg), in y-Alz03 there are
211/3 Al accommodated in the octahedral
and tetrahedral sites. In three unit cells
only 64 of a possible 72 sites are occupied
by Al, and purely at random without
geometrie order. The solid solution be-
tween MgAlz04 and
y-Alz03 is
thus
easily explained.
The mixed crystals between MgClz
and LiCI, already mentioned on p. 64,
can likewise be considered as a cubic clos-
Fig.179. CaF2 structure emphasizing the
est packing of chlorine ions. In the MgClz
primative cubicarrangementofthe F- ions
structure half of the octahedral inter-
stices are unoccupied. By the addition of two Li in place of one Mg, mixed
crystals occur, until, upon sufficient replacement by Li, the crystal of formula
LizClz results. Conversely the MgClz structure can be visualized as being derived
by subtraction of two Li in LizClz(LiCI) and replacement by one Mg.
Such view can also be taken of structures which are not elose packed. As an
example, we can consider the mixed crystal between CaFz and YF3. The CaFz
structure can be considered also as a simple cubic array of F ions, in whioh a
Ca ion is situated at the centers of alternate F cubes (Fig. 179). If the Caz+ is
replaced by y3+, additional F appears in the empty alternate F lattices.
As these examples show, crystals whioh display disorder phenomena can be
elassified into two types: those with disordered random distribution of constituents
throughout the entire crystal, substitution crystals; and those with disordered
vacancies. Both kinds of disorder can be simultaneously present in the same
crystal. The manner in which vacancies are produced can be elassified still
further as taking place either by addition, MgClz---i>-LizClz, or by subtraction,
LizClz---i>-MgClz·
Another concept has beenintroduced by SCHOTTKY and WAGNER. They showed
that crystals with a clearly stoichiometric formula must have defects (vacant
sites) at all temperatures above absolute zero. Their number increases with
increasing temperature and diminishes with decreasing temperature. Here also
substitution, addition, and subtraction can be distinguished. These defects must
be postulated in order to explain certain optical and electrical phenomena and,
in part, also reaction in the solid state. 1'0 denote the magnitude of departure

Crystal Chemistry
from ideality it is informative to mention MOTT and GURNEYS' conelusions,
based on measurements of electrical conductivity. In AgCl at 250
0 C, they find
that 0.02% of the ions are in interstitiallattice positions ; at 350
0 C, 0.1%. The
effects of SCHOTTKY-WAGNER defects are in part identical with and indistinguish-
able from those of the above mentioned type. In the latter case we are dealing,
at least in part, with defects which are not stable at absolute zero.
The phenomenon of defects in crystals has been intensively studied in recent
years. Results already demonstrate clearly that the prototype of regularity, the
crystal, can also show gradation of random order. The proviso of the genuinely
homogeneous discontinuum is not strict, but on the atomic scale is only randomly
fulfilled .
Regular Intergrowths. Additional deviations from ideal
construction are
manifest by the intergrowth of several individuals. For a mixed crystal we have
established the requirement that the distribution of atoms, ions, and molecules

shall be random: components exhibit no preferentiallocations, and no segregation
of one or the other end members occurs . In addition to such true mixed crystals,
there are also certain cases in which the components segregate into larger domains,
a kind of tiny crystallite. Fig. 180a shows a random distribution of equal numbers
of black and white squares, such as would be obtained, for example, by throwing
dice. Fig . 180b shows a distribution which is non-random and approaches the
ordered pattern of a chessboard; in Fig.180c the non-random distribution
tends toward a segregation of larger black and white domains.
Intermixing of components can range from a random distribution to inter-
growths completely visible to the naked eye. In this case also it is informative
to illustrate the principle utilizing the concept of elose packed spheres. As men -
tioned previously, in the structure of y-AI20a, oxygens are cubic closed packed
and interstices are occupied by Al. If in addition we insert Mg ions in some of
the tetrahedral interstices, MgAl20 4 occurs at a certain point, and a mixed crystal
between y-A120a and MgAl20 4 is formed. Such mixed crystals, in which the
chemical formula as weIl as the structural type of the end member do not corre-
spond, are called anomalous mixed crystals. The name is poorly chosen because

Deviations from Ideal Crystals
93
it does not properly imply the phenomenon to which it is related. H, in the
example just alluded to, ions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sites were randomly
distributed, one would speak, in spite of the different formula types of the end
members, of a homogeneous mixed crystal. When, however, larger domains are
formed which correspond
to
the end
members, intercalation of one crystal
form in another results (see Fig. 180c). Frequently the intergrowth is oriented
crystallographically with respect to the host crystal. Intergrowths can occur
by unmixing in the solid state. However, it is not necessary that this happen.

For a long time it has been known that two different kinds of crystals can grow
together in a regular arrangement. Intergrowths of rutile and hematite (Fig. 181)
are very common. Beautiful overgrowths can easily be produced exp erimentally
by allowing a drop of aqueous KI solution to evaporate on a fresh muscovite
mica cleavage surfa ce. The octahedral faces of the cubic KI and the corresponding
lattice plane possess trigonal symmetry, the mica cleavage plane, pseudohexagonal
symmetry. Since their dimensions are rather similar, the KI crystals grow with
the octahedral face oriented on the basal plane of the mica. In this way triangular
crystals are formed as a result of controlled crystallization. The triangular crystals
are oriented parallel demonstrating the preferred orientation of the regular inter-
growth.
Non-oriented intergrowths also occur very frequently. Here the relation of
the boundary surface tension (see also p. 244), determines whether a foreign body
is included or shoved aside during growth (" self-refining capacity " ). Such
foreign bodies, be they different crystals, drops of fluid, or gas bubbles, are
called inclusions. They occur probably down to submicroscopic size also.
Imperfeetions. In addition to the defect phenomena already mentioned, a
series of observations leads to the far-reaching supposition that natural and at

appropriate to speak of "real crystals". However, it appears important to
distinguish as far as possible between defects and imperfections.
Disorder can become even greater and result in transitions to mesophases,
as mentioned on page 6. In the case of layer structures, the layers may be
superimposed one over the other in more or less disordered fashion. In the im-
portant clay mineral montmorillonite (Fig . 163, p. 73), layer packets are strati-
fied in a disordered fashion, so that only the (001) planes are parallel ; more
general (hkl) lattice planes are rotated arbitrarily with respect to those in the
neighboring packet. The distance from the centers of contiguous layer packets
varies with increasing water content from about 10 to 20 A. Organic liquids can
produce still greater periodicities. These inner silicate surfaces lead to an ex-

ceptionally high adsorption capacity for the mineral. In the kaolinite-group also
there are representatives with disordered stacking sequences ; these are referred
to as " fireclay " minerals.
Dislocations. In recent years variations from ideal crystal construction have
been revealed which are called dislocations. These are very important for a proper
understanding of many crystal physical phenomena (for example plastic defor-
mation, p. 101 and crystal growth, p. 162). In Fig . 184 a simple and also quite
theoretical example of this is given. It shows a primitive cubic lattice with the
plane of the drawing parallel to (001); the atoms of the planar net above and
below the plane of the drawing lie exactly above and below the indicated points.
It can be seen that in the upper half of the drawing, an additionallattice plane
has been included, which ends in the crystal at B. Around B the lattice is strongly
distorted and the distortion is continued perpendicular to (001) equally in both
directions. This is called a dislocation line. This is not a line in the mathematical
sense, but indicates the locus of greatest lattice distortion. This form of dislocation
is called a step dislocation.

96
Crystal Chemistry
In addition to step dislocations, screw dislocations are important. In this
type of dislocation the lattice planes are so deformed that they are wound like
a spiral staircase around a dislocation line (Fig. 185). The pitch of the spiral is
sometimes only one or a few translation distances (therefore from a few to about
20 A), but may be up to several hundred Angströms in magnitude.
Step- and screw dislocations represent cases in which the dislocation line is a
straight line. There are, however, frequent dislocations in which the dislocation
line is irregular and more diffieult to characterize. Quite generally the dislocation
line delineates especially energetic regions in the crystal.
Twinning. In discussing imperfections in crystals, we assumed that the
growth results in almost parallel domains whose angular variation from the ideal
undistorted lattice is very slight. There is still another form of intergrowth of
crystals of the same substance. In these the mutual positions of the individual
crystal domains are quite dissimilar. They are, however, related by crystallo-
graphically oriented symmetry elements . Obviously these symmetry elements
Fig.186. Albite tw in. (After RAAZ-TERTSCH)
Fig.187. Quartz twin (Brazil law) (idealized)
may not coincide in kind and orientation with those characteristic of a single
crystal of the substance, since only a parallel repetition would result. Such regular
intergrowths of the same sort of crystal are called twins.
There are two kinds of such symmetrical arrangements which we can observe.
In the first case the individual crystals lie as if reflected across a simple crystal
plane, the twin plane. Often this plane is at the same time the growth plane, or
composition plane, as it is in the case of albite twinning (Fig. 186), twin plane (010).
Twinning after the albite law is not confined to albite itself, hut is exceedingly
common among all members of the plagioclase group. In contrast to this example,
twins are known for which the twin plane and composition plane do not coincide,
but in which the latter is an irregular and bent and buckled surface. The two
contiguous crystals can even penetrate one another as in quartz twins (Fig. 187).
In this case the twin plane is a prism plane (1120), and the left- and right-handed
trapezohedra lie symmetrically with respect to it (Brazil law). In practice, the
Brazil twins of quartz are only rarely recognizable from the morphological
development. More frequently the individual twinned units alternate in layers,
as is seen clearly by optical study. It is noted that in Brazil twinning right and
left-handed quartz alternate with each other.

Deviations from Ideal Crystals
97
In the second case the individual crystals are rotated 180
0 with respect to
each other around a simple rational edge direction, the twin axis. An example
is offered again by albite twinned according to the pericline law (Fig. 188).
Fig. 188. Pericline twin
The twin axis is [010]; the composition plane is the so-called " rhombic section".
This is a plane whose position does not correspond to rational indices, but rather
is determined by the dimensions of the crystal and the position of the twin axis.

of anorthite that the formation temperature of such minerals can be deduced
from the deviation of the position of the composition plane calculated theoretically

from the axial ratios and thus be used as a "geologie thermometer". The basis
for this is that the axial ratios of the crystal change with temperature and with
it the position of the " rhombic section". The latter is, however, established by
the formation temperature of twinning and cannot then be further changed.
Penetration twins frequently occur in quartz in which the twin axis coincides with

morphological symmetry 622, the symmetry ascribed to high quartz (see p.37).
In agreement therewith is the fact that, as shown in Fig. 189, the right trapezo-
hedral faces are repeated every 60° (not every 120°, as in low quartz).

The origin of twinning results essentially from two mechanisms. In the case
of growth twinning it may be assumed likely that some particles (ions, atoms, or
molecules) of the initial lattice structure do not continue the normal mode of
growth, but go on to build a related structure, so that at the transition point an
atomic arrangement occurs, that is energetically not quite the most favorable
for the regular further development of the structure. It corresponds, however,
to the next most favorable energetically and to that structure which is geo-
metrically best. As Fig. 190 shows, the transition layer between the two twins
can often be considered as a change in modification. Gold crystallizes, for example,
in cubic closest packing. The transition zone has the structure of hexagonal
closest packing which upon growth changes to cubic packing again. In 1911

Deviations from Ideal Crystals

M ÜGGE had considered the transition layer between individual twins as a thin
plate of a different modification.
From the formation of growth twins it is appropriate to single out the forma-
tion of polysynthetic twins , in which very small (frequently microscopic) twin
laminae occur, repeated over and over. They commonly form by the trans-
formation of a higher symmetry modification into one of lower symmetry, if
both modifications are structurally similar, often by cooling a crystal of a high
temperature modification.
We have already become acquainted with polysynthetic twinning in the
case of microcline (p. 76). The plagioclases also are twinned polysynthetically,
as a rule after the albite and pericline laws. The formation of polysynthetic twins
by mechanical deformation is dealt with later (p. 101).

Twins occur frequently in nature. They are especially characteristic of many
minerals in addition to the feldspars and quartz already mentioned. For exa mple,
cassiterite, Sn0 2 , whose twinning was used by miners in the Middle Ages for
identification, forms the characteristic " elbow " twin shown in Fig. 191. The
twin plane is (101). Other examples are the spinel twin, twinned after the octa-
hedron in the class m3m (Fig. 192), and the common twinning in gypsum after
(100). In pyrite crossed twinning occurs with a rhombic dodecahedral plane as
the twin plane. In the 21m3 crystal class of pyrite, no symmetry planes occur
parallel to {HO}, as is the case on the other hand in the most highly symmetrical
cubic classes. Thus, this direction can serve as a twin plane in pyrite. Calcite
forms twins after the basal pinacoid (0001) (Fig. 193) and after the rhombohedron
(01I2). Renowned are the cross-shaped twins of the class 21m21m21m, exempli-
fied morphologically by staurolite [Fig. 194 after (032) and Fig. 195 after (232)],

which gave rise in the past to legends concerning their origin. As the true
symmetry of staurolite, according to recent work, is monoclinic, although distinctly
pseudo-orthorhombic, the twinning in reality is very complicated. Important
for diagnostic purposes is the twinning of the feldspars. We have mentioned
already the pericline and albite laws for plagioclase (Fig. 188 and 186). In ortho-
Fig. 200. Schematic representation of the forms of intercalation in crystalline matter
clase, crystallizing according to its macrosymmetry in the class 21m, the (010)
plane cannot be a twin plane, since it is a symmetry plane. Here we find the planes
(001) (Manebach law, Fig. 196) and (021) (Baveno law, Fig. 197) as twin planes.
Carlsbad twinning (Fig. 198) can be characterized just as weIl by the planar law
(100) as the axiallaw [001]. Not uncommonly, twinning produces an apparent
false symmetry. For example, in Fig. 199 the triplet of orthorhombic aragonite,
twinned after (HO), appears almost hexagonal.
Summary. In summarizing these different modes of intercalation of foreign
and like individuals, we can illustrate them in the foIlowing schematic diagram
(Fig.200).

III. Crystal Physics
1. Plastic Deformation
General. Twinning of crystals occurs not only during growth, but can be
accomplished also by means of mechanical deformation. Thus we begin to concern
ourselves with the field of crystal physics, a borderline area between physics,
crystallography, and mineralogy in its most restricted sense. As is true of every
interdisciplinary field, the resulting overlap of ideas is desirable and beneficial.
The researcher who approaches the subject from pure physics is accustomed to
drastic simplification of concepts in order to work out fundamental relationships.
The mineralogist, on the other hand, who deals with natural crystals, must
always keep in mind the great variability which nature affords. The two ap-
proaches complement each other. In this introduction crystal physics will be
considered from the viewpoint of the mineralogist. We shall especially consider
and keep in the foreground of our interest those matters which are considered
important, either for the understanding of processes in the earth's crust, or
in aiding us in the understanding of different kinds of crystals.
Mechanical Twinning (simple shear). If a calcite crystal is fixed in the
direction [12.0] between the jaws of a vice and carefully compressed, polysynthetic
Fig.201. Pressure twinning in calcite; the reference plane corresponds to (0112)
(0112) twins are formed. If a cleavage rhomb of calcite is carefully pressed on the
[12.1] edge with a knife, a portion of the crystal can be easily deformed without
breaking (Fig. 201). The angle of the cut does not influence the size of the notch
which is produced. The plane along which the gliding takes place is called the
glide plane ; the direction of movement, the glide direction. Both are independent
of the direction of stress and both are characterized by simple indices. It is
characteristic of this form of deformation that the magnitude of the displacement
is proportional to the interplanar spacing of the twin plane.
Such deformation is called simple gliding. It occurs also in isotropie media
under definite types of stress and is, therefore, important in processes of rock
metamorphism. Many rocks can be considered as isotropie in a first approximation.

Let us consider a sphere which is deformed through shearing into a triaxial
ellipsoid of equal volume-, In deformation to the triaxial ellipsoid, one diameter
of the sphere coincides with the ellipsoida l axis (c) and becomes shorter, a second
becomes longer (a) and a third (b) remains the same length. In Fig. 202 the latter
is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the drawing. The other two ellipsoidal
axes, a and c, lie in the plane of the drawing. The shearing takes pla ce from left
to right . If t he volume and the magnitude of b do not change during deformation,
r2 = a . c. In order to describe the shear-
ing process the following nomenclature
is used. Each triaxial ellipsoid has two
central circular sections. One is the glide
plane or the first circular section k1 •
The shear plane stands perpendicular to
it and parallel to the shear direction rh '
therefore lying in the plane of the draw-
ing. The second circular section, k 2 , cuts
this plane along the line 'YJ2which specifies
that direction, of all possible directions
of deformation, whieh is most markedly
rotated from the initial positi on, that is
around the angle [180° - 2 'lf'] ; 'YJl and 'YJ2
are symmetrical with respect to a, the
longest axis of the deformation ellipsoid.
The magnitude of the shear 8 is given by the distance traversed during deforma-
tion by a point at a unit distan ce from the plane k1 . If 'lf' is the angle between the
two circular sections, tan 'lf' = 2{8 .
In isotropic materiale the circular sections assurne different positions depend-
ing upon the pressure relationships. The amount of deformation (the magnitude
of 8 ) varies with the magnitude of the mechanical stress. In the case of crystals,
on the other hand, definite glide planes occur in the lattice and deformation
takes place only along these planes. In addition, 8 does not depend on the applied
pressure. As soon as the applied stress becomes great enough for the deformation
mechanism to be initiated, the same value of 8 is assumed. Data for k1 , k2 , and
8 are tabulated for some metals and minerals in Table 15. Figs. 203 and 204
illustrate importan t düferences between the positions of the glide planes in calcite
(0112) and in dolomite (0221). The traces of t win lamellae on the surfaces of a
cleavage rhomb of calcite (Fig.203) run parallel to the edges and longer face
diagonals ; in the case of dolomite (Fig. 204), on the other hand, they are parallel
only to the two face diagonals. Th ese differences serve as important criteria in
distinguishing calcite and dolomite. The formation of pressure twinning can
be considered to be similar to twinning whieh results during growth. In both
cases the lattice is rearranged under external influences. In a transition zone
bordering the glide planes a different modification, or really another ordered
state, of the lattice is produced.
Translation Gliding. Glide twinning is one means by which plastic deformation
of crystals takes place. Another possibility is gliding that takes place in a manner

has the same symmetry as the orthorhombic dipyramidal class (see p. 28). The 2-fold axe s

This is referred to as mechanical translation, or translation gliding.
Parts of a crystal are displaced with respect to one another along a crystallo-
graphically defined plane, the translation glide plane. The glide direction is not
arbitrary in this plane, but the movement takes place only in certain crystallo-
graphically defined directions, the translation glide direction. The magnitude of
the translation depends not only on the mechanical properties of the crystal, but
also on the magnitude of the applied stress. Translation takes place only along
unique planes, so that the distance which an arbitrary point traverses in the
crystal, unlike twin gliding, is not proportional to the distance between glide

Crystal Physics
planes. With translation gliding twinning does not occur, but instead the two
parts of the crystal always remain parallel, and crystal lamellae of varying
thickness are mutually displaced. Mechanical deformation by translation gliding
is more common than by twin gliding. Deformation by translation gliding can be
illustrated with reference to the halite (NaCl) lattice. Fig.205 shows a view of
the NaCI lattice with the dodecahedral plane (1l0) indicated as the translation
glide plane. If one part of the crystal is moved relative to another in the direction
of the arrow [1l0], a CI- ion will always lie adjacent to a Na" ion. Therefore,
positive and negative ions always He opposite one another and the unity of
the lattice is always maintained. On the other hand, if one attempts to deform
Fig. 205. Translation gliding and cleavage (sp.) in sodium chloride
the crystal perpendicular to the above direction, along translation direction
[001], the crystal cleaves , for now, during deformation, likecharged ions are
brought into juxtaposition. In NaCl (001) translation planes can occur also when
the glide direction coincides with a cubeface diagonal [1l0]. Octahedral (111)
planes can also serve as glide planes. Glide directions are always those which
allow Na " ions to "glide" on Cl- ions. The migration of dislocations (see p. 95)
through a crystal plays an important role in the actual atomic mechanism of
translation gliding.
Sufficiently thin NaCI crystals (2-4 mm thick) can be deformed easily
by bending. In this case individual layers glide over one another in a manner
analogous to bending a ream of paper. Warming in hot water makes the crystal
sufficiently plastic to be deformed in this way. The water dissolves and heals
cracks which form, so that fracture does not so easily occur. The easy deform-
ability of NaCI was of considerable importance in the genesis of the north German
salt deposits. As a result of relatively slight tectonic pressure, layers of salt were
extensively squeezed into folds. Translation gliding plays a very important role
also in the deformation of metals. In sheet metal rolling, for example, the indi-
vidual crystals which form the sheet are deformed by gliding. Glacier ice also
flows slowly downhill, because the ice crystals are deformed under the pressure
of the overlying ice. The translation glide plane in the hexagonal ice crystal is
the (0001). In the case of kyanite, and especially in the case of BaBrz • 2HzO,
the glide direction is unidirectional, the translation taking place only in one

direction and not in the opposite one. These examples are noted in Table 16,
which also gives a summary of translation gliding, in some metals and minerals.
It is important to note that in the case of most simple structures, translation
glide planes are the most densely populated lattice planes and the glide directions
the most densely populated lattice lines in the crystal. These are denoted by d
in Table 16. If several glide planes or directions occur, they are designated with
decreasing population density as d1 , d2 , etc. In simple ionic structures the lattice
rows which correspond to glide directions are usually occupied by like ions, as
was indicated above in the case of NaCl. In more complex structures these
generalizations break down because lattice rows of different population density
can occur parallel to one another.

Theory of Plastie Deformation. If we investigate the stresses which lead to
plastic deformation, say by stretching a metal crystal in a tensile test, and then
plot the stress as ordinate against the magnitude of the elongation as abscissa,
curves are obtained like those shown in Fig. 206. At low stress the deformation is
insignificant until, at some definite stress, very significant plastic deformation
sets in (shear stress law). This critical stress is called the elastic limit of the crystal.
It is, as Fig. 206 shows, strongly dependent on the orientation of the translation
glide planes relative to the tension direction. The amount of elongation (strain)
is always very much less in ionic crystals than in the case of the cadmium metal
crystal illustrated.

BOAS); IX is the angle between the translation glide plane and the direction of tension at the
start of the test; AQ initial cross section
Experimentally determined values for the elastic limit are always much lower
than those calculated from crystal lattice forces. This sterns in part from the
fact that the theoretical values apply only at absolute zero. At higher tempera-
tures, as R. BECKER and ÜROWAN have shown, energetically rich sites occur
locally in the lattice. As a result the additional tensile stress necessary for de-
formation is lower than that which is necessary at absolute zero. This is reminis-
cent of the phenomena associated with Schottky-Wagner defects (p.91) and
infers some interrelationship. This explanation is not sufficient, however, for
at very low temperatures, too, differences between calculated and observed

Strength Properties
107
stresses are still considerable. It must be assumed, that in addition, imperfections
influence the deformation process. An imperfect crystal possesses stresses at the
boundarics of the mosaic blocks, if we assume the branching structure proposed
by BUERGER. It can be demonstrated, following the suggestion of TAYLOR, that
by imposing an external tensile stress upon such local stresses, jumps of individual
atoms over their potential barriers are induced. Dislocations are propagated
from atom to atom in the lattice by a sort of chain reaction. A relatively small
impulse is necessary, of the order of 0.01 to 0.001 that of the stress calculated
from lattice forces. Then the dislocation migrates through the crystal until the
process comes to astandstill at a barrier (foreign atom, inclusion, other imper-
fection, mosaic block boundaries).
Imperfections, in particular dislocations, are also very important in explaining
the phenomenon of hardening which plays a particularly important role in metal
working. At the beginning of deformation the tensile stress is smaller than re-
quired by theory, but it increases during the course of deformation. The crystal
becomes hardened. During plastic deformation the imperfections are mobilized
and influence one another with commensurate increase in strength. If appro-
priate energy is supplied by heating, the strength decreases again since the initial
state is partially restored. Deformation at low temperature is called cold working,
at higher temperatures, hot working. In our later discussion of rock metamor-
phism (p. 319) we shall encounter similar processes involving rocks.

Cleavage. Having dealt with the plastic behavior of crystals, we now want
to examine those processes which are related to cohesion of a crystal, and during
which
its breaking point is exceeded.
Determination of compressive, tensile,
and bending strengths is technologically
of considerable importance. In crystals
these strength properties are direction-
ally dependent. In many crystals the loss
of cohesion takes place by fracturing
along definite, well-defined planes, that
is, along cleavage planes . Cleavage planes
in crystals always correspond to those
with small rational indices. Cleavability
is governed by symmetry. If a cubic
crystal cleaves along (100), it cleaves
just as weIl along (010) and (001).
The cleavability of mica is fairly weIl
known to all of us, In fact the technical
use of mica depends on the fact that
very thin cleavage flakes can be pro-
duced from it. We can easily rationalize the perfect cleavage of mica on structural
grounds, if we recall that mica has a layer-type lattice. In the case of a layer struc-
ture the coherence within layers is strong, for example, as a result of covalent
bonding ; between the layers it is weak, resulting from intramolecular bonding.
It is easy to conclude that the excellent cleavage should take place between mica
units. Graphite, ~ C[31h (Fig. 207) also has such a layer-type lattice. The technical
utilization of graphite is also dependent upon its excellent cleavage. We are

of moisture on the very large surfaee area whieh results from the fine sub-
division of tale erystallites into tiny sheet-like eleavage partieles.
With ionie erystals like NaCI, cleavability ean be rationalized as was done
by J. STARK, and as we have already done in diseussing the phenomenon of
translation gliding (Fig.205). It ean be noted that, during deformation, posi-

tively charged ions along the cleavage planes are continually brought into juxta-
position with other positively charged ions. In this way the coherence, which is
essentially due to electrostatic attraction, is destroyed. Whether the cleavage
mechanism is actually as depicted by this model, is by no means certain. It is
generally true, however, that almost without exception, ionic crystals cleave so
that the c1eavage fragments formed are electrically neutral. This can be illustrated
easily, für example, in the case of NaGI with its {lOO} cleavage, or for sphalerite,

which cleaves perfectly along {U O} (Fig. 208). To explain the perfect octahedral
{lU} eleavage of fluorite we refer to (Fig. 209). Here the atomic arrangement of
CaF 2 is illustrated, but in this case the diagram differs from Figs. 151 and 179
in that the cube diagonal is oriented vertically. It can be clearly seen that, parallel
to the octahedral planes, series of layers F -Ca-F, F-Ca-F etc. are repeated. Atomic
planes containing only negatively charged fluorine ions are continuous. Between
two such fluorine planes bonding is very weak. It is apparent, however, that the
prerequisite of electrical neutrality of eleavage planes does not provide a complete
solution to the problem of eleavage in ionic crystals. It can be noted that in
NaCI, separation along {U O} also produces electrically neutral parts, yet NaCI
does not possess dodecahedral eleavage. There are similar discrepancies when
considering dodecahedral eleavage in fluorite. In diamond the eleavage does not
take place along {UO}, as in sphalerite, but along {l U} instead . In this purely
covalent lattice the minimum bonding forces are decisive (Fig. 210). The eleavage
planes are those planes which involve the smallest number of bonds per unit area.
Cleavage is an important diagnostic aid in the identification of minerals,
proving useful also in microscopic investigations. In Fig. 211a - d crystal sections
showing eleavage traces are illustrated for a few important crystals. In many
crystals eleavage is poorly developed. This is the case, for example, with quartz.
If one crushes a quartz crystal with a hammer, it is broken generally into small
pieces with conchoidal fracture. This is the manner in which glass is fractured.
Careful statistical studies by v. E NGELHARDT have shown in this case that definite
preferred fracture directions develop as would be expected for a crystalline
material. In the case of quartz these directions vary with temperature. At room
temperature the fracture surfaces lie in part elose to the rhombohedron r, in-
clined 45-65° to the c-axis, and in part steeper faces are formed at 70-75°
inclination to the c-axis (see p. 32).
Compression-, Tensile-, and Bending-Strength. Compression-, tensile-, and
bending-strengths are likewise directionally dependent, as Ta ble 17 shows. For

simple structures like NaCI, the tensile strength can be calculated from the
lattice energy (p. 166). The theoretical values lie around 20,000 kgJcm2, far above
the observed values, which vary between 20-200 kgJcm2• These results have
led to lively discussion during the last 30 years. It is certain that imperfections
in the crystal cause the low strength values. The question as to whether they
are due to mechanical damage, grooves or real small-scale imperfections is still
not resolved, although in many cases probably all are involved. By dissolving
away the external surface of a crystal during or just before the tensile test , the
strength, based on the cross-sectional area, is increased. Very thin specimens give
experimentally the theoretical strength, as Fig. 212 shows,
Hardness. Our previous discussion of strength properties was concerned with
properties that have been clearly and quantitatively defined. The study of

Mineralogists, on the other
hand,

have utilized a hardmess scale established
by MORs in 1812. This is so conceived
that a mineral with a certain hardness
will scratch one of lesser hardness. This
hardness scale (Table 18) is quite useful
in the identification of minerals. Since
gem stones are for the most part charac-
terized by high hardness values, this pro-
perty can be useful for their identifica-
tion. Thus most true gems can be easily
distinguished from glass imitations if
they can be scratched by quartz, which
is of inferior hardness to most gem min-
erals.
Scratching is accomplished by pene-
tration of the point of a crystal or crystal
aggregate into the face of another crys-
tal. In this way easily deformed material
will be plastically deformed, while brittle materials are broken or fractured.
Deformation and fracture can also occur consecutively. For a given mineral
the seraich. hardmess is different on different crystal faces, and is also dependent
on direction on a single face. For brittle crystals the influence of cleavage is often
clearly recognizable here. This is apparent in the data reprodu ced in Fig. 213a-c.
The scratch hardness can be measured with very simple apparatus (SEEBECK,
1833). The crystal is mounted on a small carriage so that the face under investi-
gation is oriented horizontally. A weighted stylus is placed in contact with the
crystal face. The carriage with the mounted crystal is pulled away from under
the stylus by means of a pulley with appropriate weights attached. The counter

weight just necessary to cause the stylus to scratch is taken as the hardness value.
Such relative hardness values are indicated in Fig. 213a-c, as plotted on diffe-
rent crystal faces. The dependence of scratch hardness on cleavability infers that
a correlation exists between hardness and structure. Generally one might predict

such interdependence and expect that hardness would be greater, the closer the
atoms are to each other, and the higher their charge. Experience confirms this
assumption, as V. M. GOLDSCHMIDT was able to show. We shall call attention
first to the relation between hardness and interionic distance for the alkali halides
crystallizing with the NaCI structure (Table 19).

We can see here clearly, that in cases of equal valence and structure, the
hardness
decreases with
increasing interatomic distance of the constituent
atoms. If we vary the valence, maintaining the same structural type and like
interatomic distances, the hardness increases with increasing charge (Table 20).
Finally we can observe the effect on hardness of different structures with
constant interatomic separation and equal valence (Table 21). Comparing pairs

of such compounds it is noted that the substance with the sphalerite or wurtzite-
type structure is always less hard than the corresponding NaCl-type.
The scratch hardness of a mineral is always temperature dependent as would
be expected. The data in Tables 19-21 were obtained at room temperature.
Ioe near its melting point has a scratch hardness of I t - 2; glacial ice from Green-
land, measured at -44°C, has a hardness of 4; at the temperature of solidcarbon
dioxide (-78.5°C) the hardness is 6.

Abrasion Strength. A third form of hardness is abrasion hardness. This should
more properly be called abrasion strength (v. ENGELHARDT). If different minerals
are abraded under completely identical conditions, different weight losses are
obtained, depending on hardness. Relative abrasion hardness values are given
in Table 18 for minerals of the hardness scale, along with the comparable scratch
hardness values. Abrasion strength is a quantitative measure of complex processes.
The emery or silicon carbide grains which are customarily used for abrasion
material cause plastic deformation, but in addition they penetrate the surface
of the crystal and tear out small fragments. Therefore, since work is carried on
in opposition to the surface tension, abrasion strength is also dependent upon the
abrasion fluid. Thus the abrasion hardness of quartz in octyl alcohol is only half
as great as in water. Abrasion hardness can, therefore, be used to measure the
relative surface energies of a crystal.
Percussion and Pressure Figures. A phenomenon based on plastic deformation,
but during which the strength modulus of a crystal is exceeded, is the formation
of percussion figures. If a needle is driven with a sharp blow into a cube face of
NaCl, the crystal splits along the face diagonals and forms in addition striations
parallel to the oube edges (Fig. 214). The cracks as weIl as the striations stem
from translation gliding along dodecahedral planes.

CrystaI Physics
Even more complex are similar relationships exhibited by mica . If one presses,
with a well rounded glass probe of about 3 mm diameter, on a mica flake underlaid
by a pliable base, a flexure figure (Fig.215a) is first formed. This is a triple-
rayed star within an approximately triangular border; the figure usually is
indicative of the monoclinic symmetry of the mica. If one presses harder, a
pressure figure (Fig. 215b) is formed. This is a six-rayed star, but is not always
clearly developed. The borders of the flexure figure correspond approximately to

the directions of the rays in the pressure figure and are presumably associated
with translation gliding. The cracks of the flexure figure correspond to those of the
percussion figure and are probably fault cracks. While flexure and pressure
figures can only be produced with large mica flakes, percussion figures can be
obtained from mica crystals of only a few millimeters diameter. The percussion
figure, shown in Fig.215c, illustrates a six-rayed star, revealing the pseudo-
hexagonal structure of mica. The cracks run parallel to the edges which the
cleavage plane {OOI} makes with the prism {HO} and the pinacoid {OlO}. The
crack developed parallel to {OlO} is usually somewhat longer and is called the
guide-ray. It runs parallel to the crystallographic a axis and thus serves to estab-
lish crystallographic orientation of mica
crystals, when no crystal faces are
present other than the cleavage face, as is usually the case.
3. Elastie Behavior
Free Thermal Dilatation. Weshall discuss further some of those physical
phenomena in crystals which result in change in shape. In this case, however, the
shape is not permanently changed as in plastic deformation, but instead the
crystal recovers its original shape as soon as the distorting force is removed. A
simple example of this is free thermal dilatation, which is observed when a crystal
is uniformly heated or cooled. Although a spherical-shaped amorphous body
expands upon heating, its spherical shape is maintained. The expansion of a
crystal however, is directionally dependent (anisotropie), and generally a triaxial
ellipsoid is formed from a sphere. The symmetry of the space lattice is maintained.
Point rows remain point rows, and if they were originally parallel they remain so.
Only the distances between lattice points and the angles between lattice rows are

ehanged (Fig.216). Geometrieally this form of deformation is ealled homoqeneous
deformation.
Upon homogeneous deformation of a trielinie erystal, no relationship is found
between the orientation of the dilatation ellipsoid and the original erystallo-
graphie axes. In the ease of monoclinie erystals, as a result of the preservation
of symmetry, one of the three axes of the ellipsoid must coincide with the two -
fold axis of the crystal or with the normal to its plane of symmetry. Following
conventional notation for monoclinic erystals, this axis is the b axis (see p. 14
and 22).

Fig. 216. Homogeneous deformation of a planar lattice
However, it is not possible to predict whieh of the ellipsoid axes this will be,
nor how the other two axes are oriented within the ac-plane. In the orthorhombic
system the three ellipsoid axes eoineide with the three crystallographic axes,
giving rise to six possible orientations of the dilatation ellipsoid. In trigonal, tetra-
gonal and hexagonal crystals (see p. 14 and 29), again in compliance with
symmetry, two or three major axes of the ellipsoid must be of equal length. Thus
the triaxial ellipsoid is actually a rotation ellipsoid, produced by the rotation of
an ellipse around one of its major axes. Finally, in the cubie system the symmetry
is so high that the triaxial ellipsoid degenerates to a sphere. During homogeneous
deformation, a cubie erystal behaves like an isotropie body.
In Table 22 and 23 some numerieal values are given, representative of crystal
dilatation during heating. Al ' A2 , and A3 are the eoefficients of expansion measured

Layer struotures have smaller coefficients of expansion within the layers and
larger values perpendicular to them [Ca(OH)2' Mg(OH)2]. Closepacked structures,
such as Mg, or approximately close-packed structures, like topaz, show little
directional dependence. Calcite has a greater expansion along the c-axis than
perpendicular to it. A more detailed disoussion of structural control is still not
possible. Thermal expansion differs, depending upon the type of crystal and
direction within individual grains in a rock, and is important in considering
mechanical weathering of rocks (p. 243).
If a crystal is heated on a goniometer, it is observed that the interfacial
angles change. From such angular measurements it is possible to calculate the
axial ratios of the deformation ellipsoid. This was first pointed out by E. MIT-
SCHERLICH in 1823. In addition to linear coellicients 01 expansion, one uses also
the "cubic", or better the volumetrie coefficient, the increase, cx, of the volume
Vo to volume li, upon heating to 1°C.
li = Yo(1 +cx).
Uniform (hydrostatic) Compression. It is possible to compress a crystal by
applying uniform pressure, just aa it is possible to induce crystal expansion and
contraction by means of uniform heating or cooling. The same relationships apply
here as with free thermal dilatation. A spherical cubic crystal remains a sphere.
In the tetragonal and hexagonal systems a rotation ellipsoid is formed, and in
the remaining systems a triaxial ellipsoid. These ellipsoids differ from those for
thermal dilatation for all crystal classes in their dimensions : for monoclinic and
triclinic crystals also as to the orientation of the axes. Only in cubic crystals
ean the thermal expansion be compensated completely by uniform pressure.
The measurement of compressibility is also expressed analogous to thermal
expansion through coefficients. If we designate "fp as the volume of a crystal
under pressure P and "fp+l as the volume under the pressure P+1, we obtain
the equation for the volume decrease per unit of pressure and the volumetrie
compressibility coefficient k :
v,,+l = "fp(1- k) ;

Be and Mg, with hexagonal-elose paeking, show essentially no anisotropy; in
the ease of Zn, with c:a = 1.86 and representing a transition between anormal
and layered strueture, the anisotropism is clear, and with Bi and Sb, which have
definite layer structures, very pronounced. NaNOa is mueh more compressible
perpendieuiar to the plane of the NOa groups than in the direetion parallel to it,
in accordance with its structure.
Pyroeleetrieity. Upon homogeneous deformation the phenomenon of pyro-
eleetricity (pyr, Greek, fire) is encountered in crystals with a polar major axis.
When such a erystal is heated or eooled, alternate ends of this axis become
oppositely eharged. We have already mentioned tourmalme (see p.33) as a
typieal example. This phenomenon was reeognized long ago by LrnNE (1747) and
AEPINUS (1756). To demonstrate this property, one usually utilizes the fact that
oppositely eharged ends of the erystal attraet small, eharged partieles. If a
cooling crystal is dusted with a mixture of sulfur and red lead, whieh in turn
has been charged by passing it through a fine cotton sieve, the yellow sulfur
becomes negative from the friction, the red lead powder positive, and eaeh is
attraeted by electrostatic attraetion to the appropriate end of the orystal. It is
also possible to measure the potential developed between the two ends of the
crystal by means of sensitive measuring instruments. This effect is confined to
the classes 1, 2, m, mm2, 4, 4mm, 3, 3m, 6, and 6mm.Detection of pyroelectrieity
can be used to establish the appropriate erystal olass in the case of erystals whieh
have imperfeet morphological form development. It is necessary, however, to be
very cautious about such conelusions.
Piezoeleetrieity. If a erystal is not uniformly heated, stresses occur whieh
ean cause the development of electrieal charges. One can aecomplish this also by
applying pressure along apolar direction. This direction need not eoincide with
apolar axis of symmetry. This phenomenon is called piezoelectricity (piezein,
Greek, to press). It was discovered in 1880 by the brothers J. and P. CURIE.
M. G. LIPPMANN concluded the following year that the opposite effect of alter-
nating eontraetion or expansion of a erystal must be effected by applying alter-
nating electrical potentials. For many crystals this property has attained great
technologieal importance. It is not eonfined to the classes that exhibit pyro-
electricity, but can oeeur in all those classes in whieh polar directions are possible,
that is those without a center of symmetry. Only the class 432 has such high
symmetry that in spite of the absence of a center of symmetry, no piezoeleetrie
phenomenon can oceur. This was pointed out by W. VOIGT long ago. To the
pyroeleetrie classes can be added also the classes 222, 4, 42m, 422,32,622,6, 6m2,
23 and 43m.
Quartz is teehnologically the most important naturally oceurring piezoeleetrie
orystal. It exhibits this effeet in the direetion of its polar 2-fold axis, Sinee its
atomic arrangement is also polar in this direetion, it can be demonstrated that
compression oauses a predominantly positive charge to develop on one side, and
a negative charge on the other. As a result of left-right twinning the effeet is
caneelled. Oscillator quartz is used for the eontrol of radio transmission, as a
time and pressure measurer, and for the generation and reeeption of sound
waves of exeeptionally high frequeney (ultrasonie waves). It should be recalled
that a true pyroeleetrie effeet eannot occur in the erystal olass of quartz. Piezo-
eleetrie investigations are of general importanee in determining whether a erystal
has a center of symmetry.
Theory 01 Unilateral Stress. The theory of unilateral stress is eonsiderably
more complex than that of uniform deformation. We ean take as an example a

crystal rod which is stretched. The elastic elongation is proportional to the stress,
for example, an attached weight (Hoox's law).
Lll
-,-=IXS.
Here Lll is the elongation and l the total length of the crystal rod, S the tensile
stress (force per unit area), IX is a proportionally constant, termed the extension
modulus. Its reciprocal, l/IX=E, is the elastic modulus. In a crystal the elastic
modulus is likewise dependent upon direction. In order to describe the elastic
properties of a crystal, six equations are necessary which, in the general case of
the triclinic crystal, contain 21 constants. The higher the symmetry, the simpler
the equations. Even so, in the cubic system three constants are necessary for
complete characterization.
4. Crystal Optics 01 Visible Light
Introdnction. For the mineralogist the most important area of crystal physics
is optics, involving the wave length range of visible light ("ordinary" light)
as well as X-radiation. Those phenomena which involve ordinary light are treated
from the point of view of a continuum, for in this way they are much more simply
described. We may use the notion of a continuum, because the wave lengths of
ordinary light are very large compared to the lattice distances in crystals. For
example, the wave length of red light is 6,400-7,500· 10-8 cm, whereas the
distance between two C atoms in diamond is 1.54· 10-8 cm. When considering
X-ray optics, the wave lengths are the same order of magnitude as the lattice
spacings, For example the wave length of Cu Kot radiation is 1.54.10-8 cm. Thus
in this case matter must be considered as a discontinuum. Both optical concepts
are indispensible tools to the mineralogist. Anyone who, like the chemist, wants
to study laboratory prepared erystals or, like the geologist and soil scientist,
wants to identify minerals accurately or, like the petrologist, to study the struc-
ture of rocks, must master the fundamentals of both optical concepts. In addition
these concepts are used in other sciences, especially metallurgy and structural
study areas. These concepts have been advanced through this work.
a) Optieally Isotropie Substanees
Refraction. We shall begin with ordinary light and consider refraction first.
In optieally isotropie, weakly adsorbing media, such as gases, liquids, glasses,
and cubic crystals, like NaCI, sphalerite, and diamond, SNELL'S law of refraction
is applicable. According to this, the ratio of the propagation velocity of light in
a medium A to its velocity in a denser medium B which it encounters after
crossing an interface, is equal to the ratio of the sines of the angle of incidence (IX)
at the interface and the angle of refraction (ß) in B.
Light velocity in A
sin IX
Light velocity in B =
sin ß .
The reciprocals of the light velocities, referred to the velocity of light in a vacuum,
are called the rejraetive indices, nA and nB' Therefore,

120
CrystalPhysics
In the following discussion and diagrams, the light beam used in experiment
will always be represented by a single ray. Refraction studies are normally in-
vestigated with reference to air and, since nA is elose to unity, (nair= 1.0003)
sin afsin ß gives the refractive index of the substance B.
Total Reßection. If we consider a case in which the light passes from the
medium B, with the higher refractive index, into A, and gradually increase the
angle ß, a value of ßis sooner or later reached, depending on the magnitude of
nB' at which no more light passes into A. This value of ßis called the limiting
angle of total reflection. Diamond owes a considerable part of its brilliance to the
phenomenon of total reflection. An appropriately cut diamond (brilliant cut),
because of its high index (2.4), totally reflects a great deal of light from the under-
side of the crystal (Fig. 217). Accordingly the under surfaces of the diamond
appear mirrored, as if silvered.
Reßection. In addition to the light reflected internally by a diamond,
additional light is reflected from the surface. Together these produce the " brillian-
ce" of the skillfully cut diamond. That portion of the light reflected from the
surfaee is that which is only weakly absorbed in the case of colorless or weakly
colored substances. The greater the index of refraction of the reflecting substance,
the greater the reflectivity. Some data are given in Table 27. For perpendicular
incidence and weak adsorption the formula
(n-l)2
R= (n+l)2
applies. R is the relecting power and represents that percentage of the incident
beam which is reflected. For oblique incidence a more complex formula applies.
Luster. Luster is an important diagnostic property for mineral identification.
It depends, in the case of perfectly planar surfaces, on the reflecting power of the
crystal. With minerals one distinguishes between those with adamantine luster
(therefore, high
index of refraction)
and vitreous luster,

are said to have metallic luster. An ex-
ample is silver, which reflects 95% of the
light at perpendicular incidence. The

Streak. In addition to luster the "streak" of minerals is used for identification.
A fine mineral powder is produced by rubbing the specimen on an un -glazed
porcelain plate. Colorless minerals give a white streak, resulting from complete
scattering of light. Colored minerals, especially those with metallic luster, fre-
quently give colored streaks, because tiny particles distributed in thin layers on
a white surface, still transmit light differentially for those wave lengths which
are not too strongly adsorbed.
Dispersion. Returning again to diamond, we notice that it has an additional
property which makes it especially popular as a gem stone, -
its play of colors.
This is because the index of refraction of diamond is different for different wave

refraction for wave lengths A. = 0.397 and A. = 0.760 (1. is 0.0628 for diamond. This
is approximately five times the dispersion
for water, and three
times that for
ordinary glass. This dispersion is partic-
ularly noticeable if we consider the case

(0.760 (1.) emerges at an angle of 13°. The
angle of incidence here is 24°. By re-
ducing the angle to 20° (Fig. 218b), the dispersion of the two rays is now only
2°13'. Play of colors and brilliance together cause the characteristic "fire" of
diamond.
Index 01 Relraction Determination by tbe Immersion Metbod. Determination
of index of refraction by prism methods and by means of total reflection, as
discussed in many physics texts, will not be considered here . Likewise, it will
not be possible to go into the different
methods of producing monochromatic
light. Here we shall consider only that
method of index determination which has
been adopted for microscope work and
which has proven especially convenient
and accurate.
This is the immersion
method.
If a fragment of a transparent, iso-
tropie crystal or glass is immersed in a
liquid of the same index of refraction,
it cannot be
distinguished
from
the
surrounding medium, when using mono-
chromatic light, and if the surfaces of
the fragment are very clean. In incandes-
cent (white) light, the indicesofrefraction
for all the different wave lengths are never exactly the same, As a result of dis-
persion the object appears with slightly colored borders. If the indices of refraction
of the object and the immersion medium are very different, the grain stands out
prominently, that is, it shows relief. This is because surface irregularities scatter
the light. In addition such a grain (under the microscope) exhibits a bright
border of light. If the barrel of the microscope is raised, the bright line
appears to migrate into the medium of higher index of refraction. This line
is called the Becke line after its discoverer. It provides us with a very convenient
means of determining whether the grain or the immersion medium has the higher
index of refraetion. This behavior ean be applied also to anisotropie erystals, as
will be shown later (p. 130). To explain the Becke line let us observe Fig. 219,
whieh illustrates the refraction relationships for a fluorite cleavage fragment,
n = 1.435, immersed in water, n = 1.333. With perpendicular, as weIl as obliquely
ineident light, the light is bent predominantly into the erystal, because of its
higher index of refraction. Total reflection occurs in part, but this is by no means
a neeessary requisite, nor is it neeessary that the interface be vertical. A complete
explanation of the phenomenon would require consideration of diffraetion as
weIl as refraetion. Increased illumination on the inner border of the higher-index

raised, it appears as if the Becke line migrates inward in tbis case; lowering it
moves the Becke line outward.
b) Optieally Anisotropie Substanees
The Discovery 01 Double Refraction. We have discussed thus far only simple
refracting or optically isotropie substances. The majority of erystals behave
differently, showing double refraction.
This was first observed by ERASMUS
BARTHOLINus, a descendent of a Dan-
ish
academic family.
His publication
dates from 1669, the same year in which
bis
countryman
STENO published the
law of constancy of interfacial angles.
The first sentences of bis treatise are so
characteristic of the genuine delight of a
scientist with a new observation, that
they shall be quoted from the translation
by MIELEITNER:
"Diamonds are relmown to all peoples and
manifold are the joys which such treasures as
precious gems and pearls bring, but they serve
only for pomp and adornment of finger and
neck. On the other hand, he who prefers for
enjoyment the knowledge of rare phenomena
will, I hope, have no less joy in a new form of body, a transparent crystal which was brought
to us recently from Iceland, and belongs perhaps to the greatest wonders which nature has
created."
He describes then a cleavage rhomb of calcite. If we also examine such a
piece, and allow a narrow beam of light to fall on it, we observe that within the
crystal the light is broken up into two beams. In 1679 CHRISTIAN HUYGENS gave
a plausible explanation for this phenomenon, suggesting that two light waves
are transmitted in the crystal. HUYGENS thought in terms of longitudinal waves,
and thus eould only explain a portion of the observed phenomenon. His wave
theory was not accepted because the Newtonian corpuseular theory was in vogue
at the time. Complete explanation on the basis of wave theory first came, when,
in the year 1808, MALUS looked through a calcite rhomb into an open window
of the Luxemburg Palace in Paris. He noted that the two images produced
change in brightness as the crystal is rotated. He concluded from this that the
light corpusoles were somehow one-sided or polar, and called the phenomenon
polarization. This observation of MALus led the Englishman YOUNG (first in a
letter to ARAGO in 1817) to establish a wave theory for light based on transverse
waves. Interference phenomena can be shown for longitudinal as well as trans-
verse waves, but only the latter can exhibit polarization perpendicular to the
direction of propagation. Polarization means then, that from a whirl of transverse
waves vibrating in all directions, those are" sifted" out, which vibrate only in
one direction. Thus some erystals exhibit two phenomena which are not charac-
teristic of amorphous bodies, like liquids or glass. These are double refraction and
polarization.
Wave Normals. As we observe the refracted light in anisotropie crystals, it
becomes apparent that SNELL'S law is not completely valid. For one of the
refracted rays the expression
s~ßOI. =
OOA, is no longer constant; indeed it is no
Sill

123
longer necessary that the refracted rays lie in the plane of incidence. If we turn
our attention however, from propagation velocities in the direction of the light
rays, to directions of the wave normale, we find that SNELL'S law is in fact valid.
In isotropie bodies ray directions and wave normal directions coincide, but this
isnotgenerallythe case in crystals. In an anisotropie medium, ::; =
~g~:: applies
for wave normal velocities. Since in this case the wave normal transmission velo-
city in the crystal, (CB)w' is dependent on direction,
s~n fJoc is no longer constant.

In optically isotropie media, refraction relationships can be illustrated, using
the representation of Huygenian wave fronts. For anisotropie crystals a more
complex surface must be substituted for the spherical wave front. Its form

Fig. 220. Refraction of monochromatic light at the air-calcite interface. A wave front of the
light incident at the right intersects the calcite interface earlier at A than at G, since the ray
at G must travel the additional distance BG. The drawing shows the optical relations at the
instant the ray reaches G. By this time at A the light, which has been broken up into two
components, has moved along paths defined by the ray velocity surfaces shown. The line
connecting the points of intersection of the two surfaces is the [00.1] direction. The dotted
extensions of the ray velocity surfaces in calcite have no significance in air. Theyare shown
only to assist in clarifying the shapes of the surfaces. At all points between A and G light
rays are scattered to develop ray velocity surfaces. These become smaller and smaller toward
G as the time interval becomes shorter. GE and GF represent the wave fronts of the ordinary
and extraordinary waves respectively. The directions of propagation of these waves are
perpendicular to their corresponding wave fronts. The directions of propagation of the corre-
sponding rays are AE and AF
depends upon the crystal symmetry, as weIl as other factors. For calcite it con-
sists of a sphere and an oblate rotation ellipsoid (an ellipse rotated around its
shorter axis) which coincide at two points. The line connecting these two points
coincides with the direction of the three fold axis in calcite. The refraction re-
lationships at the calcite-air interface are illustrated in Fig.220. These optical
surfaces have a rather more complex form in crystals of lower symmetry (ortho-
rhombic, monoclinie, triclinic). Mathematically this surface is represented by a

124
Crystal Physics
quadratic equation. There are always two wave fronts associated with eaoh ray
direction, and vice versa (Figs. 221 and 222). Mastery of the optical processes in
crystals is easier, when we note the wave normal directionsinstead ofray directions.
S

N 2) corresponding to the ray direction (8)

8 2) corresponding to the wave normal (NI)
In this way we can describe all of the phenomena which are important to us, In
the following discussion, when we speak of direction of propagation, we shall
always be referring to the wave normal velocities and likewise to the refractive
indices of the wave normals.
The Indicatrix. The light associated with each of the two waves transmitted
in our calcite crystal is not polarized in the same directions. The vibration direc-
tions of the two waves are perpendicular to each other and both vibration direc-
tions are perpendicular to the wave normal. This is true of all double refracting
(anisotropie) crystals. In order to describe the behavior of light in such crystals,
we shall consider a graphical three-dimensional plot of the indices of refraction
in the vibration directions of the corresponding waves. This gives us, so to speak,
an orthogonal system of coordinate axes. One axis is represented by the wave
normal ; the other two axes are the vibration directions. The lengths of the
vibration axes represent the indices of refraction of the two waves. If we insert
this axial system into the center of an anisotropie, transparent crystal and allow
the wave normal to assume all possible orientations, the ends of the index axes
describe a triaxial ellipsoid. This is a body which we have already encountered
(see p. 102) in disoussing mechanical deformation of a sphere and free thermal
dilatation (p. 114). In optics this solid figure is called an indicatrix or index
ellipsoid (Fig.223). Cross-sectional planes in the indicatrix are generally ellipses.
Let us imagine now a crystal into whose interior the surface of the ellipsoid is
somehow engraved. If we remove an infinitely thin wafer perpendicular to a
wave normal, the lengths of the radii of the ellipse give the indices of refraction
of the two waves assooiated with the wave normal. The directions of the radii
represent their vibration direetions.
The indicatrix has three principal sections , which are also its planes of sym-
metry. The intersections of the three planes define the longest, shortest and
intermediate axes and, therefore, the highest (ny), lowest (naJ, and intermediate
(np) indices of refraction-. If the wave normal coincides with the n y axis, the
elliptical section perpendicular to it contains nlX and np. The birejringence of this
plate is np -nIX' If we now incline the wave normal to the nlXline, in the plane eon-

taining nlX and nl' (Fig.224), we obtain an ellipical perpendicular cross section.
One radius is again np; the other radius is now larger than nlX , and continues to
increase with increasing inclination, until the wave normal finally attains a
position wbere it takes on tbe value of np• Tbe cross section is tben no longer an
ellipse, but instead a circle witb radius np. Sucb a circular section would also

Crystal Physics
opposite side in the ny-na plane (Fig. 224). A circular section implies that the
two waves associated with the wave normal have the same index of refraction.
In the direction perpendioular to the circular section, no double refraction occurs.
The crystal behaveslike an isotropie body. These two special directions are called
theopticaxes, and such crystals are called optically biaxial. The term "optic axis "is
unfortunate in that the beginner must always take care to distinguish between
optic axes and ellipsoidal axes. There is also some danger in confusing them with
crystallographic axes.
The orientation of the indicatrix (optic orientation) with respect to the
crystallographic axes depends on the crystalsymmetry, as was mentioned earlier
in discussing the ellipsoid formed during free thermal dilatation (p. 114). The
triaxial ellipsoid itself (p. 115) has the symmetry mmm, with three mutually
perpendicular symmetry planes and three orthogonal 2-fold axes. In triclinic
crystals it is not possible to predetermine which optical orientation the indicatrix
will assurne. The orientation will be governed by the symmetry restrietions, which
in this system is no more than a center of symmetry. In a monoclinic crystal
either the two-fold axis must coincide with an ellipsoidal axis or the symmetry
plane of the crystal with one of the principal sections of the indicatrix. It is easy
to see, that within these limits, an infinite number of optic orientations are
possible. In an orthorhombic crystal, however, there are only six possible optical
orientations, and one of these must be appropriate in an individual case. In
addition to optical orientation, note must also be taken of the form or shape of
the indicatrix, and, related to it, the angle between the optic axes. Both the shape
and optic angle change with wave length as well as with temperature. For mono-
chromatic red light, the optic angle is different than for blue light. In the trigonal,
tetragonal and hexagonal systems the triaxial ellipsoid becomes a rotation ellip-
soid. Thus only one circular section is present. The crystal is optically uniaxial,
that is, it behaves as if isotropic in only one direction. The optical axis coincides
with the major crystallographic axis (3-, 4-, or 6-fold) of the crystal. In the cubic
system, finally, the indicatrix is a sphere so that only one index of refraction is
necessary to characterize the crystal. There are no unique vibration directions.
For uniaxial crystals the major refractive indices are designated as wand 8,
the Greek letters for the Latin expressions for ordinary (ordinarius) and extra-
ordinary (extraordinarius) waves. In order to understand this method of notation,
we shall consider once again a ray of light obliquely incident on the face of a
calcite cleavage rhomb (IOll). The birefringence (double refraction) causes the
incident ray to be resolved into two rays within the crystal (Fig. 220). If we
rotate the crystal around the face normal, one of the two rays in the crystal
responds to this rotation as it would in an isotropic crystal. This ray and its
associated wave are called the ordinary. On the other hand the direction of
transmission of the other ray changes as the crystal is rotated, and indeed the
ray itself rotates around the ordinary. This ray and its associated wave are
called the extraordinary. In optically uniaxial crystals the index of refraction
of the ordinary wave is always constant. The indicatrix is a rotation ellipsoid
with an infinite number of symmetry planes passing through the rotation axis.
Each such plane is called a principal plane. The axes of the ellipse coinciding with
a principal plane represent the refractive indices wand 8. Depending on the shape
of the uniaxial indicatrix, two kinds of uniaxial crystals can be differentiated.
If the rotation axis is greater than the diameter of the circular section (Fig. 225),
that is, if 8 > o), the crystal is uniaxial positive. Quartz and rutile are examples.
Crystals for which 8 <w (Fig.226) are uniaxial negative. Calcite and apatite are
typical examples.

One distinguishes between optieally positive and negative biaxial erystals also.
If the angle between optie axes (around nr) is less than 90°, the erystal is said to
be biaxial positive ; when greater than 90°, biaxial negative. The index direetion
whieh biseets the aeute optie angle is ealled the acuie bisectrix. That whieh biseets
the obtuse angle, the obtuse bisectrix. Aeeording to the definition of abiaxial
positive erystal, ny must be the aeute biseetrix, and n", the obtuse biseetrix.
In negative erystals the situation is reversed ; n", is the aeute biseetrix, nr the
obtuse. The angle between the optie axes is the optic angle and is designated as
2V. By eonvention in biaxial positive erystals this is the angle around nr, in

128
Crystal Physics
negative crystals, around n." so that 2 V is always less than, or at most, equal
to 90°. If by chance the optic angle is exactly 90°, the biaxial crystal is optically
neutral. The np axis of the indicatrix is the optic normal. As the optic angle of a
positive indicatrix becomes smaller and smaller, the indicatrix approaches the
shape of a positive uniaxial indicatrix and the two circular sections merge into
one. As the angle about n", becomes smaller, the indicatrix becomes a negative
rotation ellipsoid whose rotation axis is n",.
The optic angle is also an important parameter for identification. It is more
sensitive than the indices of refraction to changes in the shape of the indicatrix.
The 2 V is related to the major indices of refraction n"" np, and ny, by the following
expression:
For very low birefringence, the following expression can be used:
tan V~V np-n", .
ny-np
In both cases the optic angle about ny is calculated. If (ny-np) > (np-n",),
V <45°, and the crystal is positive. If (ny-np) < (np-n",) it is negative. The
optic axes always lie in the n", ny plane. This plane is called the optic plane.
Polarizers. Up to now we have onIy considered crystal optics from the theo-
retioal standpoint. Let us now take a look at the phenomena which are important
for the investigation of crystals by means of the polarizing microscope. Such an
instrument is different from an ordinary microscope in that devices are included
for producing polarized light. The simplest method of doing this is by reflection,
for example, from a glass plate. The light observed by MALus in looking through
a calcite crystal was polarized 'by reflection. In 1815 BREWSTER showed that
polarization by reflection is most complete when the reflected and refracted rays
are perpendicular to each other. If cx is the grazing angle and n the index of
refraction of the reflecting substance:
sin (X
----;-----;-;;=---,- = tan cx = n.
sin (90o -
(X)
The vibration direction of the reflected ray is in the plane perpendicular to the
reflecting surface (Fig. 227). Sets of glass plates were used as polarizers in the
Noerrenberg polarization apparatus, which was for a long time the onIy polarizer
available for light beams of large diameter.
A second way of producing polarized light is to utilize the double refracting
property of a crystal and eliminate one of the doubly diffracted rays produced
in some unique direction of propagation. This can be accomplished by differential
absorption. In strongly absorbing crystals the two waves are not onIy refracted
by different amounts, but they may be absorbed to a markedly different extent.
If, in a crystal plate, onIy visible light is transmitted in one vibration direction,
and onIy ultraviolet, for example, in the other direction, the crystal can serve as a
polarizer for visible light. In many tourmaline crystals the ordinary ray is com-
pletely absorbed and onIy the extraordinary rays are transmitted, somewhat
reduced in intensity. A tourmaline plate cut parallel to the 3-fold axis, lets only
the light of the extraordinary ray through. Its vibration direction lies parallel
to the optic axis, corresponding to the general optical properties of uniaxial
crystals. Earlier such tourmaline plates were actually used as polarizers. It is

Crystal Opties of Visible Light
129
possible to produce only very narrow beams of polarized light with these crystals,
since there are no large usable tourmaline crystals. In addition the extraordinary
ray is always colored. Even if it were possible to find a tourmaline crystal in
which the extraordinary ray was very slightly diminished, it would still appear
Fig.227. Polarization of light by refleetion and refraetion in an isotropie medium
colored because both waves are important for the total impression of the absorp-
tion phenomenon. The adsorption properties of iodocinchonidine-sulfate, called
herapathite after its discoverer HERAPATH (1852), are more favorable than those
of tourmaline. From this substance it is possible to produ ce thin crystal plates
of several centimeters size. It is now possible to produce thin transparent sheets
of parallel oriented herapathite crystals embedded in plastic (polaroid). These
have such fine optical properties that they have essentially replaced the early
ealcite polarizers for use in mineralogical microscopes.
F
Fig. 228. Ray paths in the Nieol prism
A third way to produce polarized light depends again on use of a double
refracting crystal. In this case the phenomenon of total rejlection. is used. For this
calcite is used. In Na-light the index of refraction of the ordinary wave is 1.658 and
the major index for the extraordinary wave is 1.486. A calcite prism is cut so
that the incident light produ ces extraordinary waves having the index Cf = 1.54.
The prism is cut in half along a diagonal face and the two halves recemented with
Canada balsam, n ,...., 1.54. The inclination of the faces was so chosen that the
ordinary wave, whose index is always equal to 1.658, is totally reflected in passing
from calcite into the Canada balsam , whereas the extraordinary wave passes
through this interface (Fig.228). This form of polarizer was first described in
1 8~8 by NICoL. Today other cutting orientations as weIl as other cementing agents
are used. The prin ciple, however, remains th e same.

An Anisotropie Plate in Parallel and Polarized Light. Let us now observe a
plate cut from a crystal in an arbritary orientation and illuminated by polarized
light. The elliptical section of the indicatrix gives the vibration directions of the
two waves and their indices of refraction, n~ and n~(n~ < n~) . In order to determine
the indices of refraction of the plate by means of the Becke line method (p. 121),
we must first orient n~ with its vibration direction parallel to the vibration direc-
tion of the polarizer. Then only light vibrating in this direction passes through
the plate, and it has the index n~. To determine n~, the procedure must be repeated,
reorienting the crystal so that n~ is parallel to the polarizer. This procedure can
be demonstrated, using an aggregate of aragonite crystals imbedded in Canada
balsam (n,...., 1.54). The aragonite crystals are elongated parallel to the c axis
p
(na' parallel c= 1.530, nß, parallel a = 1.682, ny, par-
allel b= 1.686). It is observed that in one orientation
aragonite has a significantly higher index than Can-
ada balsam ; in the other direction it is a little lower.
Using the Becke line method, one can estimate also
the differences in indices between two crystals of dif-
ferent minerals in contact, for example, quartz and
feldspar. To do this, the orientation of the indicatrices
of both grains must be taken into account.
An additional phenomenon very important for
mineral identification can be discerned by use of the
polarizer. This is pleochroism: In anisotropie crystals
the two perpendicular vibrating waves are absorbed
to varying degrees. Thus all anisotropie crystals are
pleochroic to some extent, but the differences in ab-
sorption do not in all cases lie in the narrow spectral
region to which our eye is sensitive. An especially
beautiful example of pleochroism is exhibited by cordierite, as was mentioned
early in the introduction to this book . A cube of cordierite is cut with the cube
faces parallel to the three principal sections of the indicatrix. If we orient the
three major vibration directions parallel to the polarizer one after the other, we
see that when n", is parallel to the polarizer, the crystal appears yellow, when ny
is parallel it is blue, and when nß green. Other minerals with strong pleochroism
are tourmaline, biotite, amphiboles and epidote.
We have considered thus far only the two cases in which one of the two
vibration directions in the plate lies parallel to that of the polarizer. We should
consider also the random rotation of the crystal plate with respect to the vibra-
tion direction of the polarizer. If A is the amplitude of the wave transmitted
through the polarizer, and </> the angle between the n~ direction and the vibration
direction of the polarizer, and g and a the amplitudes of the two waves in the
crystal plate (Fig.229), then
g=A cos </>
and
a=A sin</>.
It is seen at once that, when </> = 0°, g= A and a = 0, and for </> = 90°, a = A and
g= O. Between these two extremes, which involve planar polarization, the two
waves combine by phase shifts to form elliptically polarized waves. The com-
bination of two waves of unequal amplitude vibrating perpendicular to one
another and with },/4 path difference to form elliptically polarized light is shown
in Fig.230. Waves of equal amplitude combine under like conditions to form
circular polarized light (Fig.231). The polarization state of light after passing
through polarizer and crystal plate depends, therefore, on the orientation of the

Crystal Optics of Visible Light
131
plate relative to the polarizer. In addition the birefringence must be taken into
account. This is equal to the difference in the two indices of refraction, n~ -- n~.
In addition the thicker the plate, the greater the path difference of the two
waves. The product of the crystal thickness, d, and its birefringence
(n~ -
n~) is
called the retardation.
Fig. 230. Combination of two transverse waves of unequal amplitude, vibrating perpendicular
to one another and with a path difference of Af4. (From POHL)
If we observe a crystal plate of uniform thickness (for example, a mica cleavage
sheet) which gives a phase difference of AJ4 in polarized light (Fig. 232), ellipti-
cally polarized light is produced by rotation between 4J = 0° and 4J = 45°; at
4J = 45° circularly polarized light, and between 45 _90°elliptically polarized light
Fig. 231. Combination of two transverse waves of equal amplitude vibrating perpendicular
to each other and with a path difference of Af4. (From POHL)
is produced again. At 90° the ellipses degenerate to a straight line, and no light
vibrating in the
n~ direction comes through the plate. Only light vibrating in
the n~ direction, which is then oriented parallel to the polarizer, comes through.
In this experiment the relative amplitudes have been changed by rotating the
plate, and the phase difference has been kept constant. At 4J = 45° the amplitudes
of the two waves are equal. We shall now consider a case in which the phase
difference is varied. To do this a wedge-shaped quartz crystal, cut parallel to
its optic axis, is gradually inserted above the polarizer in the 45° position (Fig.233).
The phase differenee increases with increasing wedge thickness. Parallel polarized
light is produced at phase differences of 0, AJ2, 2),/2, 3),/2, 4AJ2, etc . and vibrates
perpendicular to the polarizer at uneven multiples of ),/2 and parallel to it at
even multiples.

is inserted between crossed polarizers in the 45° position, darkness occurs at the
places where the phase differences are 0, A, 2A, etc. The light, as it emerges from
the wedge, is vibrating perpendicular to the vibration direction of the analyzer.
At A/2, 3A/2, 5A/2, etc ., however, maximum brightness is observed. Here the
vibration direction of the wedge coincides with that of the analyser. These ob.
servations are described in the basic formula of FRESNEL:
A = A osin 24J sin n d(n~~n~) .
A is the amplitude of light emerging from the analyser, Ao of the light from
the polarizer, 4J the rotation angle which we have used already , d the plate thick-
ness,

(essentially equal in air). The formula is usually written in quadratic form,
since the light intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude. It can be
seen at oncc from the formula that when qy = 90°, 2qy = 180°, etc. , the amplitude A
becomes zero. This is also the case when d(n~-n~) =A., 2..1, 3..1, etc. At qy=45°,
135°, etc ., the value for sin 2qy attains its maximum value, l.
If the quartz wedge is illuminated with white light, the maxima of brightness
and darkness occur at different places for different wave lengths. This is illustrated
in Fig.234 for blue, green, and red light. As a result of extinction of certain wave
lengths through interjerence, bright interference colors occur, which corrcspond
to those which are exhibited as Newton rings in thin films and which like them
are distributed in orders. In Fig . 235 interference colors exhibited by different
minerals in white light are shown and related to d and (ny- n"J. The values of
birefringence of the minerals shown are based on (s -w) for uniaxial crystals and
(ny- n",) for biaxial crystals for sodium light (..1 = 589 mp.). With the help of this

table (Fig. 235), the retardation can be determined from the interference color
of thc crystal plate in the 45° position between crossed polarizers. If the bire-
fringence of the mineral in the direction of transmission is known, the thickness
of the specimen can be determined from the interference color. This approach is
used in the preparation of thin sections. A rock specimen is cut just thin enough
for the quartz which is present to show its maximum first order white inter-
ference color (the quartz exhibiting this color is cut parallel to its optic axis).
Under these conditions the thin section has the standard thickness of 30 {L.
Conversely, in a thin section of known thickness (determined from the maximum
interference color of quartz), the birefringence of a mineral can be estimated
from the interference color. This is an extremely important diagnostic aid in
petrography.
Determination of the vibration directions of
n~ and n~ in a mineral grain is
also important for identification. It is only necessary to rotate the specimen
between crossed polarizers until complete darkness is obtained. Then the vibra-
tion directions in the grain are parallel to those of the polarizer and analyser.
The ocular of the mineralogical microscope is equipped with eross-hairs which
serve to indicate these directions at a glance. The vibration directions of n~ and n~

Fig.235. Interference colors of minerals for maximum birefringence in relation to plate

are found during rotation to lie in the positions of darkness. These positions are
called extinction positions. A crystal of anhydrite, which cleaves along (100),
(010), and (001), always shows perpendicular sets of cleavage cracks. The crystal
shows extinction when the two cleavage directions parallel the vibration directions
of the crossed polarizers. It is possible to use anhydrite to test whether the vibra-
tion directions of the polarizers are parallel to the cross hairs of the ocular, and

to adjust the microscope accordingly. All uniaxial crystals when lying on a prism
face show extinction parallel to the major axis . They are said to show parallel
extinction to this direction. Quartz crystals elongated along [00.1] or apatite
needles show this sort of parallel extinction. Parallel extinction with respect to
zonal or cleavage directions occurs also in biaxial crystals. Platelets of monoclinic
sanidine developed after P {001} exhibit parallel extinction relative to M {01O}
cleavage traces.
{HO}
cleavage fragments of clinopyroxenes exhibit inclined
extinction against [001]. It is important in describing extinction directions to
indicate the reference direction.
It is very important to be able to ascertain the high index vibration direction
in the crystal plate under consideration. To do this the crystal is oriented in the
45° position between crossed polarizers. A second accessory birefringent plate, for
which the directions of
n~ and n: are known, is placed in the 45° position be-
tween the crystal and the analyser. If n~ of the specimen is parallel to n: of the
accessory plate, the retardation is increased and the interference colors rise toward
higher orders. The sampie appears as if it were thicker. If n~ and n~ are parallel, the
sample appears thinner and lower interference colors occur.Ithas proved especially
useful to use a cleavage plate of gypsum, which gives a first order red interference
color (retardation 550 mIL)' Such a gypsum plate causes samples with very low retar-
dation to exhibit a second order blue interference color as a result of addition.
By subtraction, first order yellow interference colors results. Since these are
very noticeable color changes and result from slight changes in retardation, the
gypsum plate is sometimes called the sensitive tint plate. With crystals of high
birefringence, a quartz wedge is used instead of the gypsum plate. By subtraction
the birefringence is compensated. When sample and quartz wedge both cause
the same phase difference, complete extinction occurs. It is possible to measure
the birefringence quantitatively with a calibrated quartz wedge if the thickness
of the sample is known. The
rotation com/pensaior is used almost exclusively
today for measurement of birefringence. The most distinctive of these is the Berek
compensator.It consists essentially of a plane-parallel plate of calcite cut perpen-
dicular to its optic axis . This is inserted into the accessory slot, located between
the objective and analyzer, in the barrel of the polarizing microscope. It is in-
serted in the 45° position. In addition the calcite plate can be rotated around an
axis in the insertion direction. This rotation direction lies in the plane of the
plate. Thus the plate can be oriented perpendicular to the microscope axis,
producing no phase difference, because the calcite is "isotropie" when viewed
along its optic axis. By inclining the Berek plate, increasing phase difference is
produced, and the birefringence of the sampie can be compensated. The magnitude
of the rotation angle necessary to accomplish compensation is related to the phase
difference, and the compensator is calibrated accordingly.
The locations of vibration directions in a birefringent plate are given by the
major axes of the ellipsoidal seetion which the plane perpendicular to the wave
normal forms with the indicatrix. If the characteristics of the indicatrix are
known, the vibration directions of the waves associated with a specific wave
normal can be constructed very simply with the help of a stereographie projection.
The method was introduced by FRESNEL.
As an example, we will determine for a plagioclase of about 72% anorthite
the inclined extinction angle of M (010) cleavage traces on the plane P(OOI)
(Fig. 236). We place the pole of P(OOI) at the center of a stereographic projection
and plot the pole of plane M (010), as weIl as the optic axis directions Al and A 2 ,
corresponding to independently measured values. The pole of the great circle
through Al and A 2 gives the vibration direction of n{J' and the bisectors of the

136
Crystal Physics
optic angles give the vibration directions of n(/. and ny
0 Since this plagioc1ase is
optically positive, ny is the acute bisectrix. According to the construction of
FRESNEL, the vibration directions of the waves propagated perpendicular to P
are found as follows: P is joined to Al and A 2
0 The bisector of the angle Al PA 2
gives the vibration directions sought, Therefore
n~ lies in that sector of the
projection in which ny lies, and n~ in that which also contains n(/.o We now draw
in the trace of the common edge between
P(OOl) and M(OlO), that is, the trace
of the M cleavage on P , which is the
normal to the zone M -Po The angle
which this direction
makes with the
vibration direction of n~ is the extinction
angle sought.
The observation of specimens in par-
allel polarized light, using only the polar-
izer, is sometimes incorrectly described
as "polarizers parallel" or" Nicols par-
allel"

This error is especially common
in labeling microphotographs. Two po-

tions parallel, are not used in crystal

optics studies, except under very spe-
cialized circumstances. With the second
analyser, the two waves which pass through the crystal plate would be forced
to interfere, as they are also with crossed polarizers. Different interference colors
are obtained, however, which are complementary to those obtained with crossed
polarizers.

The Universal Stage. A great deal of important information on optic orientation
of a crystal can be determined with the polarizing microscope. Much more in-
formation can be obtained, using a universal stage. Many rotation devices have
been used, especially by C. KLEIN in conjunction with the microscope. Although
v. FEDEROV described in 1893 the first universal stage suited for the study of
thin sections, only relatively recently has the universal stage been adapted for
generally wide usage . A variety of universal stages are manufactured by numerous
firms (Fig.237), and with these a specimen can be measurably rotated around
3-5 axes. In this way the principal planes of the indicatrix can be oriented
perpendicular to the microscope axis. The orientation of the optic axes can be
determined by seeking the directions of "isotropism". In the case of biaxial
crystals the optical angle can be measured then by suitable rotation. In a rock
thin section the directions of the optic axes of quartz grains, for example, and
their orientation with respect to rock structures, such as foliation, can be deter-
mined. Such information is especially important in petrofabric studies.
The Conoscope. The conoscopic method provides another approach to studying
the optical properties of a crystal plate in different directions. The strongest
possible convergent beam of polarized light is allowed to fall on the plate. A strong
condenser in the sub-stage illumination apparatus is used for this. A high-power
lens must also be used in the objective. Each of the light waves traveling through
the crystal in a conical bundle traverses a different path length. Accordingly
interference takes place like that which occurs with a quartz wedge. An inter-
ference figure , occurring in the upper focal plane of the objective, is observed
through the analyser. It is only necessary to remove the ocular of the microscope
to view this interference figure . In order to avoid the effects of disturbing scattered
light, a pin-hole aperture is inserted in place of the ocular. In many microscopes
an accessory lens is also used, which can be inserted into the optical path (Ber-
trand or Amici lens). This forms with the ocular a small microscope through which
the interference figure can be observed at low magnification. When the polarizing
microscope is modified in this manner it is called a conoscope (konos, Gr., cone).
In order to avoid a eommon misconception, it should be noted that the light
path of the conoscope is the same as in
the ordinary microscope (orthoscope) at
the same magnification. The only differ-
ence is that in one case an interference
picture of the light is observed, in the
other case a picture of the specimen.
If a plate of a uniaxial crystal cut per-
pendicular to the optic axisisilluminated
in the conoscope, using a monochromat-
ic cone of light, maximum brightness
occurs along those directions where phase
differences F= AJ2,
3Af2, 5Af2,
etc.
prevail. The loci of these directions lie
on a set of coaxial concentric cones. In
the focal plane ofthe objective the figures
of equal phase difference are concentric
circles. Between the bright circles, at
F=O, A, 2A, etc., darkness occurs. The
thicker the plate and the greater its birefringence, the eIoser together the cireIes
He. In this system of concentric circles e
f always vibrates radially, and w tangen-
tially to a cireIe. Wherever the two vibration directions are parallel to those of

138
Crystal Physics
the crossed polarizers, darkness prevails, analogous to extinction positions in
orthoscopic work (p. 134). As a result the interference figure with monochromatic
light shows light and dark rings and a black cross, whose arms are parallel to the
vibration directions of the polarizers. The arms of the cross are narrow and sharp
near the center and become broader and more diffuse towards the edge of the
interference figure (Fig. 238). The arms of the cross are also called isogyres.
In white light the dark cross is also formed, but the interference rings become
colored, with the interference colors rising from the center outward, in the se-
quence shown by the quartz wedge. As the specimen is rotated around the axis
of the microscope, the interference figure is not altered. By means of an accessory

plate it is easy to establish whether W or e' has the greatest index of refraction
and thus determine the optic sign. The first order red gypsum plate is introduced
between specimen and analyser so that its vibration directions are at 45° to the
polarizer. In the case of a positive crystal, if the gypsum plate is introduced in
the NW quadrant of the field, n~ of gypsum is parallel to e' of the sample, and the
interference color rises to blue near the center of the figure , in the NE and SW
quadrants. In the other two quadrants a first order yellow interference color is
observed (Fig .239). For optically negative crystals, the opposite effects are
noted (Fig. 240).
If a uniaxial crystal plate is not cut perpendicular to the optic axis, at small
angles of inclination the axial cross is observed to be displaced toward the edge
of the interference figure. At higher angles of inclination only the arms of the
cross are seen to migrate from time to time across the field of view during rotation.
Sections parallel to the optic axis exhibit an enlarged dark cross that breaks up
very quickly into two segments upon rotation of the specimen. This is, loosely
speaking, abiaxial interference figure with an " optic angle" of 180°.
With abiaxial crystal with small optic angle, in sections cut perpendicular
to the acute bisectrix, the same interference colors are observed around the
points of emergence of the two optic axes. These are the isochromatic curVe8. Close
to the axes they are concentric circles but, with rising interference color they
change first to oval shaped curves and at some definite point- into a figure-eight
shaped curve, in which the crossover point of the "eight" intersects the point
of emergence of the acute bisectrix. At still higher interference colors, the iso-
chromatic curves are " dumbbell" shaped. Fig. 241 shows the spatial distribution

of curves of equal phase differenee for monochromatic light. The isogyre cross
is not shown. It appears only when nB lies parallel to one of the vibration directions
of the polarizers (normal position). Contrary to optic uniaxial crystals, the two
arms of the cross are not equal. That one which parallels the vibration direction

points of emergence of the optic axes. If the crystal is rotated from the normal
position, the cross opens into two hyperbola, which converge again to a cross when
rotated a full 90°. The separation of the two axes can be measured with an optical
micrometer. This distance, in conjunction with an instrumental constant (MAL.
LARD'S constant) determined from a test crystal of known optic angle, can be
used to calculate the optical angle, 2E, in the air. The crystal optic angle 2 V
is then found according to the formula

In sections perpendicular to one of the optic axes, the optic angle can be estimated
from the curvature of the isogyre as indicated in Fig. 242.
The optic sign of abiaxial crystal can be determined with the help of an
accessory plate in a manner similar to uniaxial crystals. To do this the optic
orientation of the crystal must be taken into account. Figs. 243 and 244 should
assist in these considerations for sections cut perpendicular to the acute bisectrix.
The differentiation of uniaxial and biaxial crystals by conoscope observation
of sections strongly inclined to bisectrices and optic axes is not always possible.
The combination of conoscope and universal stage is especially useful in this
respect (H. SCHUMANN, 1937).
As already mentioned (p. 126), there is an appropriate indicatrix for each
specific wave length and temperature. The dependence on wave length of the

140

optic angle, and with it the form of the indicatrix, is especially weIl illustrated
by the extreme case of the orthorhombic mineral , brookite (Ti0 2) . This mineral
frequently occurs in thin platelets developed after (100). If a brookite crystal is
placed under the conoscope and illuminated with blue and then with red light,
it is observed that the optic plane for red light is perpendicular to th at of blue

even when the effect is very much less than that exhibited by brookite. Dispersion
01 the optic angle is indicated in the tables of appendix IHß. r > v means that the
optic angle in red light is greater than in violet light. In this case the isogyres,
relative to the acute bisectrix, are bordered blue on the outside and red on the
inside, being complementary to the relationships of the optic axes.
The change with temperature of the optic angle of gypsum was studied as
early as 1826 by MrTSCHERLICH. At room temperature the optic plane coincides
with the plane of symmetry of th e monoclinic crystal. Upon heating, the optic
angle becomes smaller and smaller and at 90-91

(TUTTON, 1913). For this special wave length and temperature gypsum behaves
like an optically uniaxial crystal. Upon further heating the optic angle opens
again, but now the optic plane is perpendicular to the plane of symmetry of the
crystal.

Strain Birefringence. Isotropie bodies can exhibit birefringence when they
are mechanically stressed. This can be easily demonstrated by bending a glass
rod between crossed polarizers. When the stress is released, the birefringence
disappears. This phenomenon is used
with models of engineering structures,
made of transparent isotropic materials
such as glass or plastic, to investigate
strain distribution caused by mechanical
stress. Lenses in microscope objectives
are sometimes so permanently strained
that they are birefringent and not usable
for workinvolvingpolarized light. Stres-
ses occur also during the rapid cooling
of glass, causing birefringence. The bire-
fringence frequently shown by diamonds
is
probably related
to
such
strain
birefringence. Certain gels, for example,
Si02 • xH 20, develop strainbirefringence
upon drying.
A crystal, whose optical behavior does not correspond to its symmetry is
called optically anomalous. Ineluded here are crystals, like leucite and boracite,
which sometimes occur as multiple twins of a birefringent modification exhibiting
the external form of a higher temperature cubic modification. Other crystals show
anomalies, caused by the inelusion of a mixed crystal component. In the ease of
cubic crystallizing alum, birefringenee ean arise from mixing ehromium alum
with potassium aluminum alum experimentally during growth. Whether the
resulting birefringenee is always due to stress phenomena is not quite eertain.
It could be that such inelusion, if regularly ordered, is caused by form birefringence.
Form Birefringence. Cylindrical or disk-shaped isotropic partieles, whose
thicknesses and inter-partiele separations are small in relation to the wave length
of light, can exhibit birefringence as a result of their arrangement alone. An
aggregate of parallel-arranged, isotropie rodlets behaves as if it were an optically
positive uniaxial crystal. A parallel stack of disk-shaped particles, behaves like
a negative uniaxial crystal. The magnitude of the birefringence depends on the
difference between the refractive indices of the partieles and their enveloping
medium. This so-called form birefringence changes, therefore, with immersion
liquid. If we designate the indices of the partieles and immersion medium as
nl and n2 respectively, and their relative volumes as ml and m2 (mI+ m2 = 1),
the birefringence for rod-shaped particles is a folIows:

In the case of birefringent rod-
or disc-shaped particles, their individual
birefringence is superimposed on the form birefringence. This is important for
some mineral aggregates. An example is chalcedony, which is composed of quartz
fibers which have grown perpendicular to the c-axis. Waves with the lower index
of refraction vibrate parallel to the direction of fiber elongation. Chalcedony,
therefore, exhibits a lower birefringence than quartz, because of the superimposed
form birefringence.
Crystal Structure and Birefringence. Form birefringence can be applied as a
very rough rule of thumb to crystals, in as much as they too, in a sense, are
composed of chains or layers of atoms. Thus layer lattices are in general optically
negative. There are exceptions, however, such as Mg(OH)2 (brucite) and AI(OH)a
(gibbsite), as well as many chlorites. In these minerals the dipole character of the
OH groups apparently determines the birefringence. Carbonates and nitrates with
their CO~- and NO~- groups, are optically negative when these groups lie parallel
to one another in the crystal structure. The higher index of refraction lies in the
plane of the complex group. Calcite, magnesite, aragonite, and others are such
examples. There are many crystals with chain structures, like selenium and
cinnabar (HgS). In cinnabar screwlike ... -Hg-S-Hg-S-...
chains run
parallel to its 3-fold axis. This mineral, like most pyroxenes (especially the
Fe-poor varieties), is optically positive. The same is true of calomel in which
elongate CI-Hg-Hg-CI molecules are always preferentially oriented parallel
to the 4-fold axis of the crystal. Crystals which are close-packed in more than
two directions should exhibit weak or no birefringence. Very noteworthy ex-
ceptions are compounds of titanium (rutile, sphene) and iron (hematite, in con-
trast to corundum). The relation between structure and optical properties is
based on the idea that light is transmitted more slowly in the direction of densest
layering, but there are so many exceptions that strong apriori adherence is not
to be expected. It is possible though to calculate the birefringence in some cases
and this has been done especially by P. P. EWALD, M. BORN and W. L. BRAGG.
Such calculations are tedious and lie beyond the scope of this introduction.
c) Optically Active Crystals
There is an additional property which sometimes complicates optical behavior.
In certain crystals, just as with some liquids, the vibration direction of the plane
polarized light is rotated adefinite amount, proportional to length of the optical
path through the substance. The angle of rotation or. increases regularly with
increasing optical path, d; or. = k . d. This phenomenon is known as optical activity.
It occurs in the very common mineral quartz, as well as numerous others. For
quartz the rotary power has been determined to be or. = 21
0 45'jmm for sodium
light. In order to explain the rotation it can be assumed that every linear polarized
vibration can be considered as the resultant of two circular polarized vibrations
with opposing sense of rotation. In optically active substances the indices of
refraction and, therefore, the transmission velocities of these two polarized waves
are different, that is, they show a sort of birefringence. Hence the resultant
vibration direction is rotated.

Crystal Optics of Visible Light
143
This birefringence is best observed in "isotropic" directions ; in quartz in
the direction of the c-axis, in monoclinic sucrose in the direction of the two
optic axes, and in cubic NaCIOa in all directions. In directions inclined to the
optic axes the two waves are elliptically polarized with opposing vibration
directions. Since the magnitude of the rotation along the c-axis in quartz is
21 045'Imm for sodium light, optical activity cannot be observed in thin sections
which are only about 1/30 mm thick.
Optical activity can be observed in 15 of the 32 crystal classes. A crystal
must not possess a center of symmetry for it to occur. The classes in which
optical activity occurs are enumerated in Table 6 of the appendix lIlA. It
should be noted further that it is possible for a substance to exhibit optical ac-
tivity in the crystalline state without exhibiting it in aqueous solution. NaCIOa
is such an example.

most important of the opaque minerals are the ore minerals, which are opaque
even in thin section. They are studied microscopically by using incident light.
With a small totally reflecting prism placed in the optical path, the specimen is

illuminated vertically (Fig.246). In order to investigate very fine structure at
high magnification, a glass plate is used instead of the prism (Fig.247). The
illuminating device is called an opaque illuminator, and it is mounted in the tube
of the microscope. Since the illumination passes through the opaque illuminator
and the microscope tube, a microscope is often used in which the sample is
focused, not by raising and lowering the microscope barrel, but by adjusting the
microscope stage. Such a microscope is called an ore microscope. In the last
40 years ore microscopy has become more important. It is based to a large extent
on studying the appearance of minerals and their behavior when polished and
etched. A great wealth of data has been collected, but we cannot discuss this in
any more detail here.
Theory. The determination of optical constants of opaque substances is still
in its infancy, because optical relationships for strongly absorbing bodies are
extremely complex. In addition to the refractive index, the absorption coeiiicient
plays a significant role. If Aois the amplitude of the incident light of wave length
Aoin vacuum, and A the amplitude of light that has traversed a distance d in the
crystal, the following relationship applies :
k is a constant, the absorption coeijicient. Occasionally the absorption index x is
used. This is related to Al ' the wave length in the crystal. Frequently the product
of x and the index of refraction n is utilized. If X/Al is substituted in the formula
for lc]Ao, since Ao/Al = n, n X = k. Through the involvement of the absorption
coefficients, a general second order surface, serves as a reference in place of the
indicatrix. The radial vectors of this surface are complex refractive indices, that
is, composed of real and imaginary numbers n' = n - i . k (i =V- 1). We can no
longer deal with perceptual bodies like ellipsoids, but must deal with the appro-
priate optical phenomena purely by calculation.
Triclinic, monoclinic, and orthorhombic crystals have three major indices
of refraction and three major adsorption coefficients. Their directions do not
generally correspond. In the trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal classes, reference
surfaces of the refractive indices as weIl as the adsorption coefficients are rotation
ellipsoids, both having a common rotation axis. In cubic crystals both surfaces
are spheres. It must be expressly noted, however, that even in the cubic system,
SNELL'S law is only valid when the light has perpendicular incidence. The index
of refraction ni is dependent on the angle of incidence, i, in air, according to the
following relationship :
ni=t (n2 -k2+sin2i +V4n2 k2+(n2 -k2 -sin2i)2).
For reflection at perpendicular incidence, the reflecting power R, that portion
of the light reflected (BEER, 1854), is as follows :
(n-l)2+(nk)2
R =
(n+l)2 +(nk)2
e) Fluorescence and Discoloration Halos
We shall conclude our discussion of optics involving visible light by con-
sidering briefly the phenomenon of jluoreecence. This is important in mineral
identification and promises to be of even greater importance in the future. By
fluorescence, a substance radiated with short wave length light reemits light

of longer wave length . Ultraviolet light is used to demonstrate this property.
This is commonly produ ced by means of a mercury-quartz glass lamp, and
filtered through a screen transparent only to ultravi olet light. It is sufficient to
use an ordinary are lamp with such a filt er. Quartz optics are necessary for
transmission. Fluorescence of minerals is usually caused by impurities, which
usually occur in only trace amounts. Common examples are the inclusion of
small amounts of rare earths for Ca2 + in fluorite or of Mn2 + for Ca2+ in calcite.
Their detection can have important geochemical significance, and is often used
in identifying locality of origin. Fluorescent substances can be detected in very
low concentrations. For example, as little as 0.00026 cm" of petroleum can be
detected in 1 cm" of sand.
Another interesting phenomenon is the occurrence of discoloration halos.
These occur frequently in biotite, and less often in amphiboles, cordierite, tour-
maline, fluorite, spinel, and gam et . Dark zones, which are disk-shaped in cross-
section, occur around inclusions of radioactive minerals such as zircon, monazite,
and orthite. They sometimes form distinct rings as in the fluorite from Woelsen-
dorf. The discoloration of the original mineral is th e result of emission of alpha-
particles in the inclusions. From the ring diameter it is possible to determine the
radius of action of the alpha rays and from this the radioactive element. The
time duration of the effect can be estimated from the magnitude of the discolora-
tion and from this the age of the mineral. The discoloration halos of anisotropie
minerals are often pleochroie. These are referred to as pleochroic halos. They
are seen very distinctly around zircon inclusions in cordierite. The cordierite,
which is normally colorless in thin-section, is pleochroic in bright yellow tones
around the zircon inclusions.

discussion of the phenomena associated with the ultraviolet and infra-red regions.
At the present time these are of relatively limited importance as far as mineralogy
is concemed, although absorption measurements in the infrared region are becom-
ing increasingly important. They provide significant information e.g. conceming
the bonding of hydrogen in crystals. Weshall consider instead in some detail
the very short wave length region, the X-ray spectrum. X-rays are of fundamental
importance for the determination of crystal structures, as weIl as for the identi-
fication of minerals. X-ray methods have been especially useful in the study of
very fine-grained minerals not amenable to study by microscopic methods, and
are an important tool also for textural studies of rocks.
Fig, 249. Diffraction from a linear lattice
The Laue Equations. The X-ray interference in crystals was first discovered
in the year 1912 by v. LAUE. Simultaneously he proved the wave character of
X-rays and the existence of atoms and opened the way to the extremely impor-
tant and flourishing field of crystal structure analysis. Space does not permit us
to go into the methods of production of X-rays. Appropriate details can be
obtained from the standard physics references. In order to understand the
phenomenon of X-ray interference by crystals, we shall consider first of all
the case in which a monochromatic X-ray beam is incident upon a linear lattice
and is scattered by the individual lattice points (atoms) (Fig. 249). The path
difference between the rays scattered at two adjacent points in some arbitrary
direction is
~~' - p; ~. In order that the individual waves constructively
reinforce one another in the direction selected, the path difference must be
expressed in whole multiples, h1 , of the wave length, h1 A. The number h1 indicates
whether the zero, first, second, third, etc. order of diffraction is being considered.
If the distances ~ P; and PI' ~ are related to the repeat period a 1 and the
angle 0( of the scattered and angle 0(0 of the incident beam, measured with respect
to the lattice direction, we obtain the following so-called Laue equation:
a(cos 0( -
cos 0(0) = h1 A.
This equation is used also for visible light in grating spectroscopy, and from it A.
can be determined when the other parameters are known.
This Laue equation explains why in visible light no analogous interference
occurs with crystal lattices. The greatest path difference is obtained at angles
corresponding to grazing incidence and scattering. Then the path difference is
almost equal to 2 (~ -~) = 2a ; thus h1A~ 2a. If a is equal to 2· 10-8 cm, then A.
may be no greater than 4 . 10-8 cm, if at least the first order is to occur. As we
know visible light has much longer wave lengths (Fig. 248).
1 In this chapter we shall use a, b, and c for identity periods (lattice constants) rather than
ao' bo' and Co in order to simplify presentation of formulae.

X-ray Optics
147
Fig.250 is a three dimensional diagram indicating the different diffraction
cones produced by monochromatic X-rays at perpendicular incidence to the
linear lattice. Diffraction associated only with a one-dimensional lattice is not
of great importance from a mineralogical standpoint. One dimensional lattices
are not represented as minerals, although asbestos shows certain diffraction
effects which are one-dimensional in character.
Proceeding further, let us consider two linear point lattices, intersecting at
some arbitrary angle , say 70°. If they are radiated simultaneously by mono-
chromatic X-rays perpendicular to the plane defined by the two point rows, a
diffraction pattern as shown in Fig. 251 would be obtained on a film placed
perpendicular to the incident beam. This consists of two families of hyperbolae
which represent the intersections of the two sets of diffraction cones and the
recording film. If both the intersecting linear lattices are repeated by trans-
lations in a plane, a planar lattice or grating is produced. In the resulting diffrac-
tion pattern the intensities at the hyberbolae intersections (Fig. 251) are always
greater than between these points. Such grating spectra are obtained by electron
diffraction from thin mica sheets.
As a final step, if we stack the individual planar lattices one upon the other,
aspace lattice is produced. If the direction of the incident beam in our experi-
ment coincides with the stacking direction, the point rows lying in this new
direction produce a third set of interference cones. These intersect a film placed
perpendicular to the incident beam in concentric circles. The two original point
rows again produce the two families of hyperbolae (Fig. 252). In the case illu-
strated in Fig . 252, the three families of curves never intersect at a common
point. Accordingly a three-dimensional periodic pattern (crystal lattice) with
monochromatic radiation produces cooperative scattering in only certain direc-
tions. These are those which by coincidence would correspond to the intersection
of three diffraction curves in Fig. 252 at common points.
There are two experimental approaches for satisfying the conditions for
diffraction from space lattices :
1. The use of polychromatic (white 1) X-rays. In this case, in experiments such
as those just described, for certain select wave lengths the three sets of curves
intersect occasionally, satisfying the conditions for cooperative interference. In
Fig. 253, this situation is iHustrated using the analogy of visible light.
2. The use of monochromatic X-rays. The crystal must be rotated. Diffraction
takes place in certain specific orientations with respect to the incident X-ray beam,

Mathematically the diffraction directions for a three-dimensional lattice are
derived from the conditions for diffraction for each of three linear lattice rows.
The approach is to solve simultaneously three Laue equations, one for each of
the three linear lattices, in order to ascertain the conditions necessary for re-
inforcement of scattered waves from the three linear lattices. The following are
the three appropriate Laue equations :
a (cos cx - cos iXo)= h1 A )
b (cos ß- eos ßo)= h2 Ä
c (cos y-cos Yo) =ha Ä.
b, ß, ßo and c, y, Yo are analogous to the terms a, cx, iXo used above in the first
Laue equation. The lattice dimensions a, b, and c are crystal constants. If Ä as
weIl as cxo ' ßo and Yo are held constant, generally cx, ß, and y do not give whole
numbers for h1 , h2 , and ha; the three equations are not simultaneously solved and
diffraetion maxima are not produced. Only by varying Ä, can this happen.
v. LAUE used X-rays with a broad range of wave lengths in his first experiments,
and thus obtained interference maximum, even with a stationary crystal. Fig. 262
on p. 158 shows a typical Laue photograph.

Tbe Bragg Equation. By using monochromatic rather than polychromatic
X-rays
the angle of incidence and thus 0(0 ' ßo, and Yo can be varied and
brought into coincidence. In this way W. H . BRAGG and W. L. BRAGG, soon
after LAuE's discovery, determined the first crystal structures. They showed
that X-ray diffraction can be viewed as taking place by " reflection" from lattice
planes in the crysta1. If d represents the interplanar spacing, and 0 the angle
between the lattice plane and the incident X-ray beam , the path difference,
r, from two scattering points, as shown in Fig. 254, is equal to 2d sin 0. Thus
in order for constructive interference to occur, the path difference mu st equal
whole multiples of the wave length, thus,
n A=2d sin O.
(2)
From this Bragg equation it is seen that either Aor () must be varied if diffraction
is to occur from a given plane of atoms. By analogy with visible light optics the
angle () is frequently called the angle of reflection. If we imagine a crystal , radia-
ted by monochromatic X-rays, oriented with the incident X-ray beam essentially
parallel to the lattice plane, we see that no diffraction takes place from this
lattice plane. If we rotate the crystal about an axis lying in the lattice plane,
and perpendicular to the X -ray beam, a reflection occurs as soon as the Bragg
conditions are fulfilled for a value of n = 1. Upon further rotation the reflection
is extinguished again until rotation brings t he plane to an angle whose sine is
double the value of the sine of the angle at which the first reflection occurred.
A further reflection occurs when sin e= 3· 2).d ' etc .
Interrelation of tbe Bragg and Laue Equations. In order to relate these two
expressions, the interplanar spacing d of the Bragg equation is expressed in
terms of the lattice constant a, and the crystallographic (MILLER) indices of the
reflecting plane. For a cubic lattice, the simplest case, which we shall only con-
sider,

This equa tion permits us to relate X to A and to the orders of diffra ction, h1 , h2 ,
and ha. If we now compare E qs. (3) and (4), we see that X= 2 () ; this is called the
Bragg angle. We can also conclude this from Fig. 254, if we extend the reflected
ray downward. The Laue indices are equal to the product of the Miller indices
(cleared of a common denominator) and the order of diffraction n of the Bragg
formula. Therefore:

150
Crystal Physics
In structural studies, the Laue indices or the enlarged Miller indices are always
inferred when using the symbols h, k, l. The beginner must make special note
of this. Fig.255 clarifies this relationship further. In the cross section through
aspace lattice, 2a and 3b are the intercepts of the trace of a macroplane through
p and q. Its Miller indices are therefore h = 3 and k = 2. In the space lattice
additional parallel planes lie between the points of the coordinate axes, with
points which also scatter according to the Bragg relationships. It can be seen
that these planes cut the x-axis at intervals of af3 (= afh) and the y-axis at
bf2(=bfk). They likewise have the Miller indices h=3, k=2.

Fig. 256. Origin of a powder pattern
The Powder Diffraction Pattern. We now want to consider how diffraction
can be used for structure determination. Of the numerous X-ray methods we
shall describe only two in detail, namely, the powder (DEBYE-SCHERRER) method
and the rotating crystal method. In the powder method, a sample consisting of
many very small crystalline particles is exposed to monochromatic X-rays. The
crystals are randomly oriented, thus affording all possible angles of incidence
which correspond to the available interplanar distances. Because of the random
orientation, a given reflecting plane does not diffract in a single direction, but
instead its locus lies on the surface of a cone whose semi-apical angle is equal to
28 for that particular plane. This is very easily visualized, if one imagines a
reflecting lattice plane and rotates the crystal around an axis, represented by
the incident beam. This is indicated in Fig. 256 for a single lattice plane. All of
the additional lattice planes form cones of reflection also, as is true also for the
second and higher orders. On a photographic plate oriented perpendicular to the
incident beam at some definite distance from the specimen, a family of concentric
circles is produced. Usually a cylindrical film is used, with the sampIe under
study located in the axis of the cylindrical film. The sample (powdered) is fre-
quently placed in an X-ray transparent glass capillary. Using a cylindrical film,
and with the X-ray beam perpendicular to the axis of the film, the diffraction
pattern produced when the film is flattened after exposure consists of concentric
ellipses. With the very narrow film strips ordinarily used in X-ray powder cameras,
sections of the ellipses resemble arcs of circles symmetrically distributed with
respect to the 0° 28 reference point (where the undiffracted or primary beam
intersects the film). This arrangement of the film around the sample has the

X-ray Optics
151
advantage that all diffracted rays are registered, including those in the back-
reflection region, that is, at 2() > 90°. In order to determine the angle (), the
distance 2D, between two corresponding diffraction arcs, is measured. D divided
by the camera radius R gives (Fig. 256) the angle 2() in radians. In degrees there-
fore :

Frequently cameras are used with a diameter such that the D value in millimeters
is equal to the () value in degrees. If D is set equal to (), it follows then that :
360/2n=2R=57.33 mm.
In order to determine the parameters of the space lattice, the lattice constants,
from the measured values, the interplanar spacings of the Bragg equation must
be related to the indices of the corresponding planes. That is to say, the diffraction
pattern mnst be indexed. Weshall consider the general case of a crystal with
orthogonal coordinate axes, that is, a crystal which is either cubic, tetragonal,
or orthorhombic. For the interplanar spacing dh k l of a plane (hkl) in the ortho-
rhombic system with lattice constants a, b,c;
If this value for d is substituted in the Bragg equation, and the entire expression
squared, then :

For a cubic crystal for which a = b= c, the expression is simplified as follows:

If we set },,2f4a2 equal to m:
sin 2 () = m (n2 h2+n 2 k2+n 2 l2) .
The sin2 () value for each line in the diffraction pattern is determined and the
common factor m is sought. The residual term must represent the sum of the
squares of the indices or their multiples. The interpretation of a powder pattern
of NaCI is explained in Fig.257. From m=0.01865 it follows that for CuK"
radiation (1.54 A), a = 5.64 A.
Use 01Powder Diffraction Patterns. It is relatively easy to index and interpret
cubic crystals using powder patterns. It is only a little more difficult to do the
same with tetragonal and hexagonal crystals. With crystals of lower symmetry,
indexing and interpretation in this way is particularly unwieldy and difficult,
so that other methods are used. However, for all crystals the powder method
offers the advantage that the interplanar spacings d can easily be determined
from the sinO values (d =
2 s:n () ). By comparison with the powder patterns of
known minerals and artificial crystals, unknown crystalline substances can be
relatively easily and unequivocally identified. This is particularly important
when dealing with very fine-grained substances for which microscopic methods
are inadequate.

In this way it has been possible to obtain important information for the very
fine-grained mineral constituents of clays and soils. X-ray identification is also
used with advantage in the important field of mineral synthesis. In this case
very fine-grained reaction products are usually formed, and identification must
be carried out with very small amounts of sample, By means of the powder
method it is possible to distinguish mechanical mixtures, chemical compounds,
and mixed crystals. Mechanical mixtures of two oxides, for example, give the
superimposed diffraction patterns of each of the pure oxides. If a single chemical
compound occurs, however, it gives a characteristic diffraction pattern that can
be distinguished from those of the starting materials. In the case of mixed
crystals the diagram is representative of a single structure, whose d values and
lattice parameters lie intermediate between those of the two end members.
The powder method provided an additional very important contribution
soon after its introduction by DEBYE and SCHERRER in 1917. This was the in-
dication that some colloids are crystalline. Even today one finds a tendency to
equate the colloidal and the amorphous states, even though powder diffraction
studies have shown that there are crystalline as weIl as amorphous colloids. In
the mineral world, almost all colloids are crystalline. The natural globular-
shaped, so-called mineral gels are actually aggregates of crystals. The most im-
portant exceptions are the volcanic glasses and the silica gels, The latter, when
they occur in their present form as opal have often been transformed into more or
less very fine-grained, and often poorly ordered, cristobalite. An amorphous body,
a gas, liquid, or glass, gives only one or very few diffuse rings when irradiated with
X-rays in the manner of the Debye-Scherrer method. This can be explained by con-
sidering the behavior of crystals during pulverization: as the particles in a powder
become smaller and smaller, the interference maxima become broader and more
diffuse, and the X -ray diffraction pattern approaches that of a truly amorphous
body.
From the line broadening the particle size can generally be calculated. For
very thin specimens and parallel X-ray beam, the following approximation is valid :
A ""
Ä
ß ·cosO'
where ß represents the angular width at half peak intensity, and A the edge
dimension of a cube-shaped particle.
The photographic method is not always used to register X-ray diffraction
patterns. Frequently, and to an increasing extent, a geiger counter or similar
device is employed.

Fiber Diagrams. If a substanee is not suffieiently pulverized, the eireular

considerations the non-random orientation of the crystallites can be determined.

If the particles exhibit a preferred orientation, as do the crystallites in rolled
or extruded metals, the diffraction spots are not randomly distributed, that is,

154
Crystal Physics
the diffraction rings do not show uniform darkening throughout their length.
Instead regions of maximum darkening occur along the diffraction rings. Textured
rocks, such as slates, exhibit this sort of preferred orientation of their mineral
constituents. Mineral aggregates occur in nature in which one unique zone direc-
tion lies more or less parallel in all crystallites. An example is chalcedony, a sub-
parallel aggregate of quartz crystals which have grown fibrous along [11.0].
Fig . 259 shows an X-ray fiber diagram of such a crystalline aggregate. Fiber
diagrams are also produced by animal and plant fibers, stretched rubber, etc.
For all powder patterns, it is important to note that a specific wave length is
used. The radiation selected must be one which does not cause the specimen to
fluoresce by exciting its own characteristic radiation, as this produces a highly
undesirable background. In order to estimate the exposure time, it is important
to keep in mind that the scattering power of an atom is proportional to the
number of electrons it contains. When used wisely the powder method is ex-
tremely versatile and especially useful in petrography.
Structure Determination. In order to carry out a complete structure deter-
mination, the absolute size and shape of the unit cell must first be determined.
To do this rotating single crystal methods, as well as the powder method are used;
the latter most frequently with cubic, tetragonal, and hexagonal crystals. The
latter method will be considered first. This we have already done for NaCl (p. 151
and Fig. 257).

constant m = ).2J4a2= 0.0186.
Therefore for

In order to calculate the number of formula units per unit cell, it is best to
proceed as follows. It is basic that the mass of the unit cell must be a multiple
of the absolute mass of the chemical unit formula. Therefore,
V· e=MW. 1.66°8 .10-24 • Z.
V = Unit cell volume in em"
e= Density of crystal in gJcm3
MW = Molecular weight (in chemical sense)

There are four formula units in the unit cell of NaCl.
To proceed further with the structure determination, we make use of the
macroscopic symmetry as represented by the crystal class on the one hand, and
the intensities of the X-ray reflections on the other. These depend on different
factors. The scattering powers of the different elements are very different. As a
rule of thumb, it can be noted that the atomic scattering power is approximately
proportional to the number of electrons in the atom or ion. Thus for K +and Cl",
the scattering factors are essentially equal; for Na" and Cl, distinctly different.
The differences in intensities for individual reflections, which arise through
interference, are especially important in structure determination.
Weshall consider first the CsCl structure. It can be considered as consisting
of two cubic primitive lattices, one consisting only of Cs", the other of Cl- ions.
The two lattices are displaced with respect to each other by one-half the cube

diagonal. This is equivalent to a displacement of one-half unit translation in all
three translation directions. If we place a Cs" ion at the origin of the unit cell,
the coordinates of the Cl- ion are t t t .The phase difference of the waves scattered
from the "Cs-lattice " and from the "Cl-lattice", with indices hkl measured in
radians, is 2n · t(h+k+l). When (h+k+l) is an even number the two waves
reinforce each other constructively. When (h+k+l) is odd, the two waves
interfere destructively and subtraction occurs. Since the vibration amplitudes
of the Cs-scattered and Cl-scattered waves are not equal, at even values of
(h+k+l), the resultant wave has large amplitude, at odd values of (h+k+l),
small amplitude. If we designate the amplitudes of the Cs-scattered wav es as
Ics and that of the Cl-scattered wave as ICI' then the resultant amplitude S is
and
S= /Cs + /cl
for
(h+k +l) even
S =/cs-/Cl
for
(h+k+l) odd .
S is called the structure [actor (also designated as F) .
The structure of tungsten, which has a cubic body-centered lattice, can be
considered as also based on the CsCI structure. The sites of the Cs as weIl as the
Cl ions are occupied by W. The lattice constants are, of course, different. The W
atoms located at the two lattice points of the original CsCI lattice, have equal
scattering power. For planes for which (h+k+ l) is even, S = 2/w . For planes
for which (h+k+l) is odd, S = /w - /w = O.
The cubic face-centered lattice can be considered as being composed of
four cubic primitive lattices. If one is chosen as the basic lattice, the other three
are derived by translating each of them one-half the face diagonal from the first.
If we place one of th e sites of one primitive lattice at th e origin, we obtain , as
with the body-centered lattice, the phase differences for the other three lattices
(in radians),
2n· t · (h+k) ;
2n· t · (k +l) ;
2 n · t · (l+h) .
for h, k, l mixed ,
for h, k, l all even, or all odd.
S= O
S =4A
Therefore, four waves with equal amplitudes combine and exhibit these phase
relations. If the three indices hkl are either all odd or all even for each of the four
waves, the phase difference is a whole multiple of 2 n and constructive inter-
ference and large resultant amplitude arises. If the indices are mixed odd and
even, then two of the phase differences are an even multiple of 2 ot, and two an
odd multiple, or vice versa. Thus extinction occurs. This can be summarized as
follows :
The absence of reflections with mixed indices can be observed in the powder
photographs of all cubic face-centered metals.
We want now to consider a somewhat more complex case, the NaCI stru cture.
It can be described as one in which the Na" ions form a cubic face-centered
lattice and the CI- ions likewise. The two lattices are displaced with respect to
each other by one-half the cube diagonal, as were the two lattice points in a
body centered lattice. Since it can be considered as a partial face-centered lattice,
reflections with mixed indices are absent. For the remaining reflections, with
hkl unmixed, the interference properties of the body centered lattice are appli-
cable. Therefore reinforcement occurs when (h+k+l) is even, extinction when
(h+k+l) is odd. If we consider the NaCI pattern (Fig. 257) the data given in
Table 28 can be dedu ced from it. All reflections with mixed indices are absent.

Multiplicity factors are listed in one column of Tabl e 28. These are important
in determining intensities of X-ray reflections. Each crystal of the dass m 3m
possesses three equivalent sets of cube lattice planes, four sets of octahedral
planes, six sets of dode cahedral planes, twelve sets of trapezohedral planes, etc .

Since each iifcllattice plane is parallel to the hkl plane of a form , the multiplicity
factor of a hkl lattice plane is only half as great as the number of faces of the
corresponding holohedral crystallographic form . The intensity of a reflection in
a powder pattern is proportional to the mul tiplicity factor of its lattice plane.
Both effects, the multiplicity factor and structure factor are superimposed. In
addition the intensities decrease systematically to O!"::j 50° and then increase
again. Upon the two discontinuous intensity factors, structure factor and multi -
plicity factor, continuous factors related
to changing
() are superimposed,
influencing the intensity. In addition to the atomic scattering factors already
mentioned , these continuous fun ctions are the polarisation, Lorentz, and tem-
perature factors. For an exact evaluation of intensities, these must be taken
into account. A detailed discussion of these is beyond the scope of this discussion.
There are additional geometrical and absorption factors which would have to be
considered also.
We have seen that in the case of a body-centered translation group (structure
of tungsten), all reflections with h+ k + 1= 2n + 1 are missing ; in the case of a
completely face-centered translation group, all reflections with mixed indices
are absent. These mathematically regular absences are called systematic extinc-
tions. They assist in determining not only the translation group (space lattice),
but also indicate the presence or absence of glide planes and screw axes, and
thus assist in determining the space group. Thus syste matic extinctions are of
great importance in X-ray crystal structure analysis.
Rotating Crystal lUethods. It is convenient to index diffraction patterns, in
the manner illustrated here for NaCI, only in the case of very highly sym metrical
crystals. It is more convenient and ofte n imperative to use single crystal rotation
methods. In principle the same experimental arrangement can be used as for the
powder method. A single crystal is substituted for th e polycrystalline powder,
and it is rotated around one of its zone axes, usually a crystallographic axis.
Each lattice plane in the zone is gradually brought into reflecting position at the
appropriate angle of incidence by rotation. Each produces a single diffraction
spot on the film . All of the reflections from plane s in this zone lie on a line which
coincides with the intersection of a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis and

the film. If the zone axis is the c-axis, an reflections from this zone willlie on this
layer line on the film and have the indices hkO. This line of intersection on the
film is called the equator or zero-layer line. The hkl reflections likewise form
series of spots on the film, distributed
on additional layer lines which extend
parallel to the equator at some definite
distan ce from it. Thus the hk2 reflections
lie on the 2nd layer line, etc. The identity
period in the rotation direction can be
determined from the distan ce between a
layer line and the equator. The rotation
method is illustrated schematicallyin Fig.
260.
A rotation diagram of a garnet
crystal rotated around [001] is repro-
duced in Fig. 261. Several layer lines are
seen in addition to the equatorial line.
In order to find the repeat distan ce, a,
in the rotation direction, the following
equation is used :pis th e distance between

An example of such a calculation, using data taken from the original photo-
graph from which Fig. 261 was reproduced, is summarized in Table 29. Th e wave
length used was ).= 1.539A.
If separate rotation patterns are taken around the three crystallogra phic
axes, the unit cell parameters are obtained. These values can then be more
accurately determined from calibrated powder patterns.
In the case of both powder and single crystal meth ods, some of the reflections
from different lattice planes coincide, because they have the same angle of
diffraction. A unique evaluation of X-ray extinctions is not always possible in

158

such cases. For complete interpretation this must be known, however, in order
to determine the appropriate structure factors. For this reason X-ray gonio-
meters are used in which not only the crystal is rotated, but also the film is
simultaneously translated in adefinite direction. In this way the diffraction

and the resulting array of spots can be very easily interpreted. The X -ray gonio-
metrie methods, using perpendicular or inclined incidence of the X-ray beam as
developed by WEISSENBERG, BUERGER, and MENZER are especially important.
We cannot treat them in further detail here.
In this summary it should further be stated that determination of crystal struc-
tures by X-rays alone is frequently extremely difficult. Therefore supplementary
information is of very considerable importance. Atomic and ionic radii, packing
densities, coordination schemes, the principle of electrostatic neutrality (lines of
force should be as short as possible), optical properties (indices of refraction,
birefringence), magnetic and cohesion properties, and other information provide
considerable assistance in crystal structure analysis.

Fig. 264. Conditions for diffraction from a reciprocal lattice
still used for symmetry studies of crystals. However, for crystal structure analysis,
monochromatic methods are much more suitable. Under usual circumstances
X-ray photographs indicate that a given lattice plane reflects equally from both
sides of the plane (G. FRIEDEL, 1913). The effect is to introduce an apparent
center of symmetry. Therefore it is not possible to ascertain by means of X-ray
diffraction alone whether a crystal direction is polar or not, that is, whether or
not a crystal has a true center of symmetry. The exception to this situation
occurs when the crystal contains atoms with an X-ray adsorption edge lying
near to that for the radiation used. Then the symmetry of crystals with enantio-
morphic forms can actually be determined. An example of such an enantiomorphic
structure is that of right and left-handed quartz. It has been shown that th e
morphologically defined right-quartz contains left-spiralling screw axes (p. 32).

Crysta! Physics
The Reciprocal Lattice. In X-ray crystallography it is frequently convenient
to derive an imaginary lattice from the direct lattice of the crystal. The axes of
this imaginary lattice are parallel to the directions of the face normals of the unit
cell and the repeat distances along its axes are the reciprocals of interplanar
lattice spacings. This imaginary lattice is called a reciprocal lattice (Fig. 263).
The reciprocallattice has been extensively used because with its help the diffrac-
tion relationships of single crystal diffraction patterns can be easily understood.
This is shown for a two-dirnensional case in Fig.264. It can be seen that the
reallattice plane is in a position to satisfy the Bragg diffraction conditions, when
its corresponding point in the reciprocal lattice (whose origin is at 0, 0, 0) lies
on a circle of radius I/I. (reflecting circle). In three dimensions we do not use a
circle of reflection but the corresponding Eioald sphere 0/ reileciion, of radius I/I..
If the lattice planes in a crystal are not spaced periodically in one direction,
that is, if they have one-dimensional disorder, the X-ray reflections are not sharp
in all directions. Accordingly the reciprocallattice points are smeared out perpen-
dicular to the disordered planes, sometimes continuously from one reciprocal
lattice point to the next.
Fourier Synthesis. The manner of crystal structure determination discussed
so far depends upon trial and error methods. After the lattice parameters and unit
cell symmetry have been determined and the nu mber of formula units per unit
cell calculated, a structure compatible with the symmetry and intensity relations
is proposed. Fourier synthesis is an important resource in modern crystal structure
determination. It takes its name from the analysis of aperiodic function by
Fourier series. It is possible by means of Fourier methods to determine extremely
complex structures and to do so with much greater accuracy than was possible
earlier with the methods previously described. By the use of special and very
careful methods of measurement, it is possible to determine the electron density
at all points in a crystal (see Figs. 158a and 170a).
Electron Diffraction. An additional diffraction method utilizes electron beams
to produce diffraction patterns. It has been known in theory since DE BROGLIE
(1924), and from experiments by DAVISSON and GERMER (1927), that electrons
can be diffracted like light waves. Electrons with mass m and velocity v behave
like waves with wave length A= ~ , where h is PLANCK'S constant. If velocity is
m v
expressed in terms of an accelerating potential in volts applied to the electrons,
we obtain the expression:
1.=V!~O A.
At 63 V, waves would be produced of wave length equal to that of CuKex radia-
tion. Usually much more energetic electrons are used.
The diffraction of electrons is fundamentally different from that of X-rays,
in that the electron beams are not only influenced by the electron shells of an
atom, but also by its nucleus. The diffracted intensity is about 108 greater than
with X-rays, but they are also much more strongly adsorbed. They are trans-
mitted through only very thin layers.
Neutron Diffraction. Excited neutrons are diffracted like other elementary
particles by crystallattices. Neutrons produced in an atomic pile do not all have
the same velocity. Their wave lengths extend over a large range. "Thermal"
neutrons, which are those which through numerous collisions are in thermal equi-
librium with their surroundings, have their mostfrequent velocities correspondingto

X-ray Optics
161
a wave length of 1.3 A. Thus in a continuous spectrum, the wave lengths of the
neutrons have a maximum at just that wave length most convenient for structural
analysis. For comparison we can recall that the most frequently used X-radiation
for structure determination is that of CuK",(,1 = 1.54 A). By means of reflection
from a crystal and appropriate collimation, a narrow beam of monochromatic
neutrons can be produced and used for diffraction experiments.
It is especially important from the mineralogical standpoint that the position
of hydrogen atoms in crystals can be accurately determined by neutron diffraction.
Because of the very low atomic scattering power of hydrogen, this is possible
by means of X-rays only when the other atoms present in the crystal have low
atomic numbers (to perhaps 20). Even in these favorable cases the hydrogen can
be only inaccurately located. Knowledge of the positions of hydrogen are of
fundamental importance to the crystal chemistry of hydroxides, OH containing
salts, and hydrated salts.
Electron Microscopy. We can only briefly mention the important field of
electron microscopy. It is an important supplementary aid for studying very
fine-grained minerals, such as the clay minerals. It reveals primarily information
about the size and shapes of small particles. It is possible to obtain electron
diffraction patterns from the same samples being viewed in the electron micro-
scope. Lattice contacts can be determined in much the same way as from X-ray
powder patterns.

IV. Crystal Growth and Dissolution
1. Geometrical Relationships
Introduction. In the preceding discussion we have dealt with aseries of
physical properties of crystals and have seen in the last chapter how the atomic
structure of crystals can be determined with the help of X-ray optics. We have
yet to discuss the most sensitive expression of crystal structure, the phenomena
of crystal growth and dissolution. The occurrence of natural planar bounded
bodies was the starting point of crystallography and the origin of such bodies
still remains one of its most important problems. In spite of all the research that
has been carried out, there is still much uncertainty about the mechanisms of
crystal growth.
Growth Velocities. The problem can be approached from different directions.
We will first consider the geometrie approach. Why is it that a given cubic
crystal sometimes crystallizes as cubes, sometimes as dodecahedra and sometimes
as octahedra 1
The law of constancy of interfacial angles teIls us that the faces of the crystal
can be displaced parallel to themselves. We shall assurne that a crystal grows
by means of such parallel displacement of its faces and that each form has a
definite displacement (or growth) velocity, unrelated to its size and boundaries.
This growth velocity, for a given structure, is dependent only on external con-
ditions. These velocities can be measured on growing crystals in the laboratory.
SPANGENBERG determined the following values (Table 30) for potassium alum at
30° C and 0.5% supersaturation.

If we want to study the concurrent development of all possible faces, a sphere
fashioned from a crystal is used as the initial body. It is observed during a growth
experiment that planar surfaces develop at certain places on the sphere. Other
points first remain curved or become rough until these points also gradually are
over-grown by the faces which first appeared. Simple geometrie considerations
show that those faces survive which have the lowest growth velocities. In Fig. 265
the relationships are shown for alum in a section parallel to (HO). The curved and
rough initial state is omitted, and the (hhl) forms indicated in Table 30 are
drawn tangent to the sphere so that they form a polyhedron. Several growth
stages are indicated after equal time intervals, corresponding to the growth
velocities given in Table 30. Already after the first stage, the faces (112) and (221)
are no longer present. Their growth velocities are so great that they would lie
far outside the crystal. By the second stage (110) has also disappeared. The

face (001) becomes smaller and smaller. It would have disappeared by stage six
which, however, is not shown in the drawing.
Whether a face persists during growth or disappears depends upon the ratio
of its displacement velocity to that of the other faces. This will be illustrated by
the simple example of growth of a crystal consisting of a dodecahedron and a

It is easy to see that parallel interfacial boundaries would occur when v {Oll}:
v{OOl} = V2: The size of (Oll ) remains constant during growth. This case is illus-
trated in Fig. 266c.

Dependence on External Conditions. Definite forms whose growth velocities
are small survive as the end product of growth of a spherical crystal. These con-
siderations assist in explaining the characteristic forms of crystals, if the addi-
tional assumption is made that growth velocities are dependent upon external
conditions, especially the magnitude of supercooling and supersaturation of the
solution constituents, and perhaps also temperature and pressure. An example
showing the temperature influence was described by EAKLE for crystallization
of potassium iodate. It crystallizes as a monoclinic crystal, forming pseudocubic
forms. Between 10 and 20°C it grows as " cubes ", but with increasing temperature
the cube is modified by " rhombododecahedron" until, at 70°C, this form occurs
exclusively. To what extent the degree of supersaturation shares in this effect
requires further investigation.
NaCIOa crystallizes as cubes from pure solutions at room temperature. How-
ever, if SOi- ions are added to the solution, say by addition of Na2S0 4 , tetra-
hedra form.
S20~- ions serve as even more effective solution constituents. Even
at concentration ratios of CI0 3: S20~- as low as 1000/1 the cube is eliminated as
the growth form (BUCKLEY). Urea, CO(NH2)2 is another example, known for a
long time to be an effective ingredient for form modification of NaCl. While NaCl
crystallizes from aqueous solutions by evaporation in air (therefore at not too
great a supersaturation) exclusively in the form {100}, the addition of urea to
the solution causes octahedra to appear. At very small urea concentrations the
octahedra occur in combination with the cube ; at higher concentrations the
octahedron occurs alone. Similar form modification is affected by additions of
CdCl2 or PbCI2 • A very large number of other inorganic and organie substances
have very little or no effect on form development of NaCl. Thus the property
involved here is very specific and as yet unpredictable for individual substances.
Fibrous Growth. Geometrie eonsid-
erations lead also to an explanation of
fibrous growth. We must distinguish here
between
minerals which grow fibrous
becau se of their structure, for example
the chain silicates, and those whose fi-
brous growth is a consequence of ex-
ternal growth conditions, as is sometimes
the case for quartz and calcite. We shall
be concerned here with only the latter.
Let us consider a situation in which many
small crys tals are lying close together
on a substrate and in random orienta-
tion. Crystal growth from each of these
nuclei is initiated simultaneously and
the supply of growth material is available
only from above . Fig. 267 represents a
section through such a cluster of crystals
as would be easily produced experimen-
tally and viewed through the side walls of
a cylinder. Of the six nuclei represented,
nuclei 2 and 3 are almost completely
eliminated following growth stage 1. Following stage II crystal 6 has completely
disappeared and crystals 1 and 5 have become insignificant. During stage III
crystal l is gone and 5 has almost disappeared. Nucleus 4, oriented most favorably,
has become more and more prevalent and finally continues to grow all by itself.

Geometrical Relationships
165
Thus a selectivity of nuclei occurs. In addition to the orientation of the nucleus,
this selectivity depends on the face growth velocities. Those nuclei succeed in
this competition for which the greatest growth velocities occur perpendicular
to the substrate. The lateral boundary of such a fiber is not a crystal plane. It is
formed by the junction of two growth directions and is planar only if the tem-
perature and concentration do not vary during growth.
Fibrous growth develops especially distinctly where crystals can grow from
a central nucleus outward in all directions. This can be demonstrated easily in
two dimensions by seeding a supercooled melt of salicylic acid phenyl ester with
a cluster of nuelei. In three dimensions, spherical radially fibrous crystal aggre-
gates, spherulites, form under such conditions. It is also common for the nuclei
to be situated not at the center of the sphere, but on the surface of a cavity. In
such cases the crystals grow radially inward toward the center of the cavity. In
all of these cases the growth directions are those directions of greatest face growth
velocity.
Dissolution. The same geometrical considerations apply to dissolution as to
growth of crystals. However, it must be noted that dissolution of a crystal from
within is the converse of the usual crystal growth (displacement of the crystal-
solution interface outward from the point of origin) . These relationships can be
studied by boring a crystal and dissolving it from within through the bore canal.
If we have a small hollow cavity at the start (say in an alum crystal), we can
utilize Fig. 265 again to illustrate the process involved. As solution progresses
the planes with the smallest growth velocities must be left to predominate. In
this way a polygonal cavity results which is identical in form to anormal crystal,
a so-called negative crystal. Such negative crystals occur frequently in minerals.
By producing them artificially, it can be observed that their forms are influenced
by solution constituents just as is the case for normal crystal growth. Since in
this case naturally no introduction of the solution constituents into the crystal
is possible, it is possible to ascertain clearly the influence of growth velocities
alone, without the effects of form modification due to introduction of solution
impurities into the lattice (FRIEDEL).
Asolid sphere which is dissolved from the outside behaves quite differently.
In this case those faces with greatest growth velocities should persist and finally
dominate. The following must be considered. There are relatively few planes of
low growth velocity, namely those faces with low indices that would persist
during growth. In contrast to these, there occurs on a sphere theoretically an
infinitely large number of planes with high dissolution velocities. The formation
of a large number of faces elose to one another creates the impression of curved
faces and in fact such solution forms are produced by dissolution of a spherical
crystal.
A crystal behaves similarly during degradation by a chemical reaction.
Again the growth velocities are unequal for different face orientations. Also the
relative reaction of different faces depends on thc solution or reaction reagent.

Depositional Energy of Ionic Crystals. Thus far we have considered crystal
growth strictly geometrically, assuming that the growth velocities of differ-
ent faces of a crystal are different.
Before
the development
of structural
crystallography, attempts were made to relate these differences to the surface
tensions of crystal faces. We now know, however, that this is significant only in the
case of extremely small crystallites.
The calculations of depositional energies of individuallattice particles by W.
KOSSEL since 1927 and 1. N. STRANSRI since 1928led to an important breakthrough
in clarifying this phenomenon. Weshall
consider first the growth of a crystal
of the NaCI-type, and only as a first

solelyon electrostatic (Coulombic) forces
involved in the deposition of individual
steps. We shall consider first a one-dimensional Iattice, that is, an ion chain con-
sisting of alternating positive and negative ions (Fig. 268). The work which must
be expended in order to separate an ion with the charge + e to a distance r from
an ion with acharge -e, is e2/r. Conversely this work is released if the ion with
charge +e is brought from infinity to a distance r from the ion - e. The deposited
ion which we assumed had the +e charge is attracted by the neighboring negative
ion with charge -e situated at distance r, is repelled by a second (positive) ion
at distance 2r, is attracted by the next (negative) ion at distance 3r, etc. Through
summation the depositional energy is given as folIows:

Exact mathematical consideration of the summation shows that it is necessary
to take into account only very few ion chains running parallel to the [100] bound-
ary. The additional inner lying chains contribute insignificantly to the deposi-
tional energy.
An additional important source of depositional energy is that which isreleased
when an ion far distant from the edge of a cube face takes up a site which is to
become an extension of the structure (Fig. 270, 1). This increment of energy can
be calculated in a manner analogous to the two previous cases:

Growth 01 NaCl Crystals. In order to use these relationships in considerations
bearing on crystal growth, it is sufficient to use the approximate expressions for
deposition energies, since we are only interested in the orders of preference for face
development. It is evident that in the growing crystal, ions enter those sites
which result in the greatest possible release of energy. Since, in the expression
for depositional energy, the factor e2/r is common for all deposition possibilities,
we shall concern ourselves here with only the variable term, which is designated

as ([J. In the upper portion of Table 33 some ([J values are given for the six crystal
sites corresponding to those in Fig. 270.
From these values it follows that deposition at site 3 is energetically most
favorable. The crystal will continue to form those chains which have already
been started. If the chain continues to develop out to the boundary of the crystal,
the nex t most favorable stage is site 4 and a new chain is initiated from the edge .
Thus growth of those cubic lattice planes already started is completed before new
layers are added. Only when the construction of a lattice plane is completed, can
a new lattice plane be begun. The energetically most favorable site for the be-
ginning of a new lattice plane is at the corner at site 5. Deposition at sites land 6
is improbable.
This theory thus explains the formation of the primary growth form {100}
for NaOl. What is the situation, however, with the other forms such as {HO}
and {l ll}? In the dodecahedrallattice plane there are also chains of Na" and
01- ions . These chains are so situated with respect to each other that one Na of
one chain always has two Na ions of adjacent chains as neighbors. Therefore
Na + and 01- ehains oeeur perpendicular to the NaOI chains. The deposition energy
for the free NaOl chain parallel to [100],
([J~lO is again 0.6932, but that for the
edge [001] of a lattice plane (ll0) is negative:

Fig. 271 shows, to an ion occurring in this plane being brought into juxtaposition
to two attracting neighbors instead of one in the case of the {100} plane. Thus
chains initiated on the dodecahedral surface will continue to grow at a more
ra pid rate than it would on a cube surface, since
tP~lO+ tP~~o is 0.9009. Also de-
position of an ion on a (HO) surface is energetically more favora ble than on a cube
surface. But lateral completion of the layer becomes difficult . The chains thus
form at some distance from one another. The dodecahedral face, therefore, has a
greater growth velocity th an the cube face. It slopes, however, in step formation
in the direction coinciding with the cube edges. In fact, the dodecahedral faces
formed by growth from spherical crystals show striations in these directions.

Fig. 271. Deposition of an ion on a smooth atomic dodecahedral plane of NaCI
The octahedral lattice planes, which in the case of the NaCl type structure
would contain like ions only if they were formed smooth on an atomic scale,
consist for similar reasons of ste pped growth forms. The octahedral face growth
velocity is very great. Although it has been possible to rationalize the cubic
crystallization morphology of NaCI, the development of the most importan t
forms for CsCI and CaF2 cannot be satisfactorily explained in a similar manner.
The above theory enables us to explain some extremely important facts,
however. Let us consider the growth sphere. We saw on the basis of geometrical
considerations, how certain individual faces gradually predominate. We know
now that of th e infinite number of face orientations which the NaCl sphere offers
during growth, the cube faces expand laterally, since all zones of the cube edge
continue to grow rapidly. They offer the maximum energy gain upon deposition.
The faces which occur , however, increase very slowly in thickness. The dodeca-
hedral and octahedral faces grow rapidly as stepped faces. Intermediate regions
are rough because on th em irregular growth takes place.
The growth of crystals with other than ionic bonding affords nothing essen-
tially new. Naturally th e deposition energies are different from those involving
ionic bonding. A crystal of formula type AB with th e NaCl structure can assurne
other values than NaCl for the absolute deposition energy as weil the relationships
for different positions. As a result other forms can be energetically more favorable.
Since the calculation of deposition energies for metallic and covalent crystals is
less weil documented th an for ionic bonding, we shall not go into further details
here.
Dissolution 01 NaCI Crystals. Upon dissolution of a crystal those ions are
abstracted whose removal requires the least amount of energy. We shall consider
a cubic crystal with a partially formed (001) lattice plane (Fig. 272). As dissolution
occurs it will begin (corresponding to th e deposition energies 3 and 7- H in
Table 33) at site 3. As soon as th e ion chain parallel to [100] is completely dissolved
away, fur ther dissolution of the (001) lattice plane is initiated at site 7. As th e
lattice plane is completely destroyed, removal of the ion at site 8 requires th e
least expenditure of energy. A cubic NaCI crystal without cracks and fissures is
so dissolved that it is first decomposed parallel to the cube face, an ion is released
at site 8 at a corner, etc. If cracks are present, the chains so exposed are dissolved .

Upon dissolution of asolid sphere, again those chains are decomposed that
are parallel to the zone of the cube edges. Therefore it is by no means necessary
that faces with simple indices should be produced. Instead curved faces with
curvature parallel to the three cube zones occur. The curvature results from
the formation of small partial faces with increasing or decreasing inclination with
respect to one another. During growth the {lOO} faces spread laterally by growth
of chains and become morphologically
important as a result of their low growth
velocity. Upon dissolution, curved faces
are produced by the chain decomposi-
tion in the zone direction. In the case
10
of NaCI these are described as pyramidal
cube faces. These are faces which have
been built up from chains in the zone
directions of the cube. This importance
of zonal relations is not confined to the
NaCI crystal. This is generally true, as
numerous studies of form development
have shown. The importance of direc-
tions in relation to the faces may not
be disregarded.
Our previous treatment of
crystal
growth was in at least two respectsgreatly
oversimplified. We first of all assumed
that the crystal is an ideal one, secondly
we assumed that the material being accreted occurs in the form of isolated ions
on the surfaces of the forming crystal. We shall deal in turn with the significance
of these deviations from reality.

Growth 01 aReal Crystal. In the example of the (100) face of NaCI, the
deposition energy is considerably less on a completed face than that required for
completion of an atomic layer already started. Another way of expressing this

Structural Considerations
171
is to say that for lateral expansion of a partially formed layer on the surface, a
considerably lower supersaturation is necessary than for initiating a new layer.
Therefore, one should expect macroscopic growth to take place only above a
certain supersaturation (according to theoretical considerations of crystallization
from the vapor phase, this should be of the order of 50%). This is in considerable
contradiction to actual observation. A way out of this paradox is found in that
we do not observe the growth of ideal crystals, but instead real crystals containing
imperfections.
Especially important in this respect are the screw dislocations observed on
the faces of many crystals (see Fig. 185). This was first noted by BURTON,
CABRERA, and FRANK in 1949. We assume first of all that a straight step must

run from the point of emergence of the dislocation to the boundary of the
crystal (for example, in the [100] direction in NaCI). Through the deposition of
material on this edge, the step gradually takes on the form of a spiral (Fig. 273).
Such growth spirals have been noted repeatedly on crystallographic surfaces. If
the step height measures only a few Angstroms, its detection requires special
methods of study which we cannot go into here. We want to note, however, that
on the prism faces of beryl, growth spirals with a step height of only 8.5± 1.0 A
have been described. This amount corresponds well with the corresponding
interplanar spacing in the structure. Step heights of growth spirals can be eon-
siderably greater than the corresponding lattice spacing, reaching sometimes
several hundred Angstroms. Fig.274 shows two examples of growth spirals on
the (0001) faces of silicon carbide, SiC. Fig. 275 shows a growth spiral on (111) of
sphalerite. If a crystal grows by accretion of material in growth spirals, the face
can be displaced any distance parallel to itself without the necessity of accretion
taking place on completed faces. Instead of a completely planar layer, spreading
out to the border of the crystal, followed by the accretion of the next layer, etc.,
spiral staircase-like bent layers, rather than completely planar layers, are formed,
The axis of the spiral is the screw dislocation.

172
Crystal Growth and Dissolution
Deposition of Foreign Matter. Up to now in our treatment of crystal growth
we have assumed that individual ions impinge on the crystal. This is only strictly
true for crystal growth from the vapor phase. Much more important are the
variations resulting from solution. This process is more important in the case of
mineral formation. During growth from aqueous solutions, for example, ions are
always to a greater or lesser extent hydrated. For crystallization of an anhydrous
salt the ions must be freed of their hydration envelopes. In addition, water
molecules are adsorbed to a great extent on the external surfaces of crystals.
Moreover, certain impurities in the solution can be adsorbed on crystal surfaces.
Fig. 275. Polygonal growth spiral on the tctrahedral face of sphalerite (after VERMA).
Magnification X 350
If we consider NaCI again as a distinct example (Fig. 270, Table 33), we find
that foreign ions are preferentially adsorbed at the sites of greatest deposition
energy, and are thus fixed at sites 2,3,4, and 5. These are the active sites in
ionic crystals. Then follows deposition at the edges of a completed crystal, and
finally on its faces.
By incorporation of radioactive ions, adsorption and introduction of ions into
a crystal can be followed experimentally (0. HAHN). These crystals are " self-
photographing" because of their radio-activity and indicate that the foreign
ions are situated at the corners and edges of crystals.
Dipoles are likewise bound to an ionic lattice. In this case the corners and
edges playa less important role than in ionic adsorption. Since the electrostatic
attraction of a neutral face of an ionic crystal, as for example the {lOO} on NaCl,
falls off very quickly with distance, adsorption occurs especially by small dipole-
molecules such as water and ammonia. Cleavage surfaces of crystals are covered
very quickly with a water layer. Large organic molecules are selectively adsorbed
if they contain a group such as the hydroxyl group with a dipole moment.
The adsorbed ions are not necessarily so strongly adsorbed that they are
incorporated into the structure. If for a certain face they have a greater retention
time than for others, a change in the growth velocity of that face and with it a

173
modification in form of the crystal may be effected. Thus we can understand the
effect of solution constituents discussed previously on page 164.
Growth Accessories. In our discussion of growth spirals, we have seen that
a crystal face need not be planar. It is important that the various phenomena of this
kind are often so large that they can be observed by means of a hand lens or
Fig. 276. {hkl} vicinal faces on a cube face of analcite. The apex of the vicinal pyramid lies
to the left of the center of the cube face. (After KALB)
even by the unaided eye. Probably growth spirals only occur on a scale necessitat-
ing high magnification to observe them. The prism faces {lOlO} of quartz, for
example, are frequently horizontally striated. On its rhombohedral faces on the
other hand, very flat irregularities with rounded surfaces are often observed.
In a theoretical classification of variations of a crystal face from the ideal,
two cases should be distinctly differentiated:
Fig. 277. Model of vicinal plane formcd from widely spaced ste ps ; and with very small angle
of inclination
1. There is first of all the essentially ideally formed crystal. In this case, however,
faces can be formed which seem to contradict the law of small rational indices.
These faces , however, usually almost coincide with a low index face and are thus
called vicinal faces (vicinus, lat., neighbor). Fig. 276 shows an example of vicinal
faces and illustrates a cube face of the mineral analcite modified by a very flat
eight-sided pyramid {hk l}. Fig. 277 illustrates a similar situation for NaCI show-
ing the construction from cubic planes of a very slightly inclined Okl-face. If
the indices of vicinal faces vary over small distances, rounded faces are produced.

174
Crystal Growth and Dissolution
Frequently, as shown in Fig. 276, striations can be seen which correspond most
certainly to considerably greater step-heights than a single interplanar spacing.
2. Variation from planar faces can also originate when the crystal under
consideration is really not a single crystal in the strictest sense, but is formed
from blocks tilted somewhat with respect to each other. This gives rise to parketted
surfaces about which we have already spoken in our discussion of crystal imper-
fections (p. 94) and for which Fig. 183 illustrates a typical example. We should
include growth spirals also in this tabulation of growth accessories.
Crystal Growth Not Leading to Convex Polyhedra. If we proceed from crystal
growth as we have already treated it to that involving much greater super-
saturation or supercooling, considerably different types of relationships occur.
Fig.278. Snow flake as an example of dendritic growth (x 30). (After NAKAYA)
In this case the lateral spreading velocities of faces as compared to material
deposition on the faces themselves no longer plays as great a role. As a result, by
means of rapid accretion of material at the sites of high growth velocities, dif-
ferent forms occur which deviate radically from the usual aspect of a crystal.
A well-known example of this is the crystallization product of water in the form
of snow flakes . Fig. 278 gives one example from a great collection of possibilities.
Such growth forms, in which a branching skeleton of crystallographically oriented
needles has replaced the usual complete crystal, are called dendrites (dendron,
gr., tree).
It is certainly by no means possible by varying the conditions ofcrystallization
to produce at will from all substances either polyhedral crystals or dendrites.
In addition to ice, ammonium chloride, which has the CsCI structure, and many
metals have a strong tendency to produce dendritic forms .
The individual branches of dendrites appear on careful examination to have
rounded boundaries (Fig. 279). After the initial extremely rapid growth dies out,
planar faces are gradually produced. The dendrites can slowly grow out into an
ordinary crystal. Since the fine needles are very easily deformed, completion of

Structural Considerations
175
the dendrites in forming crystals with parketted surfaces can occur. However,
it should not be inferred that every parketted crystal must have been formed by
this mechanism.
Dendritic formation is also known in the formation of negative crystals
(see p. 165). Their production can be weIl demonstrated with large ice crystals.
These can be produced artificially in the laboratory or are produced in nature
when large water surfaces are gently frozen. Nuclei are produced first at the
Fig. 279. Point of a copper dendrite ( X 350).

coldest place, therefore at the surface, with most (0001) planes parallel to the
water-air interface. This growth continues with depth so that ice crystals broken
from a pond or lake are oriented parallel to the base. If th e light from an arc
lamp is concentrated by means of a lens on a small area of the ice crystal, cavities
filled with water are formed within the crys tal plate outward from small inclusions,
water bubbles, etc . As shown by TYNDALL, these have (Fig. 280) the form of
snow flakes and "ice flowers ". They represent dendritic growth forms of ice.
Related to the dendrites we should mention here "capillary" crystals and
crystal " whiskers ". These include a variety of different phenomena of which
some have been known by mineralogists for a long time. In the last decade a
great deal of experimental and theoretical work has been carried out in this area.
These growth phenomena, in common with dendrites, exhibit long-fibrous
form . In contrast to dendrites, however, th ey are in typical cases non-branched.
Usually they are straight with a major lattice direction as fiber direction. Some-
times they possess bends or are bent. Sometimes they exhibit corkscrew shaped
forms. Their thickness may vary from a few hundredths to about 50 microns.
They can reach several centimeters in length. It is interesting that the strengths
of whiskers can approach theoretical strength values. Thus we must conelude that
they contain no imperfections or so few (say a single screw dislocation), that this
theoretical strength is not appreciably affected. Characteristically the highest
strength values are obtained from the thinnest fibers (see p. 110).

176
Crystal Growth and Dissolution
Fibrous growth can occur under the most variable conditions, from solution,
from the vapor phase, and in the solid state. Also it is possible by the ordinary
slow crystallization of NaOI or KOIfor thin straight fibers to grow out occasionally
from the cube faces (Fig. 281). Especially widespread among the minerals are
fibrous formed crystals which result from the recrystallization of salt hydrates
upon exposure to the atmosphere or by crystallization from a porous substrate
(salt efflorescence). Sometimes fibrous forms are the common natural crystalli-
zation product. Silver commonly crystallizes as " hair silver" and amphiboles
are often fibrous. The most fibrous of the latter are known from Alpine fissures
(byssolite) or as amphibole asbestos, which can even be woven into coarse fabric.

Among the amphiboles one finds all gradations from extreme needle-like crystal
fibers to approximately equidimensional crystals. We designate as whiskers in the
special sense fibr ous crystals which have grown out of a solid substrate, for
example, from the tin plating on sheet metal, without the need for a fluid phase.
They grow from their base outward and are therefore related to diffusion processes
in the substrate. It is quite likely that screw dislocations play an important role
in their development.
The type of fibrous growth resulting from nuclei selection described previously
on page 164, should not be confused with the phenomena described here.
Destruction of aReal Crystal. Dissolution, or more generally destruction of a
real crystal is also basically different from the relationships for ideal crystals.
Accordingly to our previous notions (p. 169), the dissolution of a NaOI cube
should lead to the development of planar {IOO} surfaces and then, beginning at
the corners, to rounded forms. Especially unfavorable, according to our previous
ideas, is the removal of an ion from the interior of a smooth cube face (site 11 in
Fig. 271 and Table 33). Therefore, it should not be expected that dissolution
should begin at such sites .
However, just the opposite situation is observed. If the surface of a crystal
is dissolved,and thereby etched, and observed under the microscope, it is observed
that the dissolution begins from individual points on the surface, and form s there

small pits, called etch jigures. Their appearance depends on the conditions of
etching, specifically on the etching reagent. Their symmetry, however, always
corresponds to the face symmetry, if we neglect certain special cases using opti-
cally active etch reagents. Two examples of etch figures are given in Fig. 282.
These are etch figures developed on the rhombohedral faces of calcite. It ean be
noted that in both cases the symmetry plane of the face runs vertically in the
figure. Therefore, etch figures provide a means for ascertaining crystal class,
as already indicated previously (p. 30).

acid and (b) sodium hydroxide as etch agents ( x 200). (After PATEL and GOSWAMI )
It remains to question why such etch pits form. This is related again to the
real structure of the crys tal. A crystal face is never ideally planar over thou-
sands of identity periods, but in fact contains a multitude of imperfections. Long
ago the formation of eteh figures was explained as resulting from solution along
cracks (Fig. 283). However, there are additional variations from ideality such
as foreign inelusions and disloeations, which are important here.
Fig. 283. Origin of etch figures (after R. GROSS) . 0-4 dissolution stages
If, for example, a erystal of LiF is deformed, it shows as does NaCI, trans-
Iations along {H O} planes (see p. 104). In the plane of movement the number of
disloeations is markedly inereased. Aeeordingly the etch figures are arranged on
{WO} cleavage faces of meehanieally strained LiF erystals in straight lines whieh
eorrespond to the interseetions of the eube face with dodeeahedral planes (Fig. 284).
Through lateral growth neighboring eteh pits ean overlap and finally give
rise to eteh knobs. Fig. 283 serves to illustrate this.
Future Prospects. Th e theories of erystal growt h proposed by KOSSEL and
STRANSKI, as we have seen, clarify a series of phenomena and for others at least
point toward their solution , There are various reasons why these theories are not
eompletely satisfaetory . Chernical forces, whieh we eannot yet aeeurately cal-

energies. In addition, these relationships are appropriate only for deposition of
individual isolated atoms, which is a radical simplification of what really occurs
in nature. Very erueial, too , is the fact that these relationships are eoneerned
with the growth of ideal erystals, and we know that imperfeetions playa very
erueial role. Thus it is no wonder that in assessments of fundamental values these
relationships alone are not eapable of solving all the problems of erystal morpho-
logy.

The morphology of a erystal depends on its strueture and on its conditions
of formation. The influenee of strueture is asserted in the Kossel-Stranski theory
in the deposition energies. Other investigators have attempted to solve the rela-

geometry (BRAVAIS; DONNAY and HARKER) or with more formal bonding prinei-

to be able to relate the morphology of a mineral to its eonditions of formation
unfortunately still lies in the distant future, beeause of the multitude of form -
influeneing faetors.
Intensive experimental and theoretieal work in the last eentury leads us to

V. Some Physical-Chemical Fundamentals
1. Nucleation and Growth of Nuclei
~[elting Point Determination. In the last cha pter the matter of crystal growth
was discussed from a geometrical and structural viewpoint. lt is now necessary
to examine the question, " When does a crystal crystallize from a melt 1" . The
obvious answer is that it occurs when a fluid is cooled a bit below the melting
temperature (melting point) which prevails at some definite pressure. In order
to determine the exact melting point in those cases where it is not possible to
directly observe th e melting process, it is possible to take advantage of the fact
that heat is liberated during crystallization, the so-called heat of melting or
crystallization. If a melt, for example, of a simple metal, is allowed to cool
slowly, and the te mperature measured as a fun ction of time, it is observed that
in spite of the cooling, adefinite temp erature is reached and the melt remains
at this temperature for a short period of time. This is the precise melting point.
For this short period of time the drop in temperature is compensated for by the
liberated heat 0/ melting, or crystallization. Only when the melt has completely
crystallized does the temperature decrease further. Conversely, it can be observed
upon heating crystals that at the melting point, because of absorption of the heat
of melting, a temperature increase is delayed until everything is fluid . In a like
manner boiling points can be determined through similar effects of th e heat of
vaporization. Changes in structural modification can be noted likewise by similar
effects due to liberation of the heat of transformation. A different method
involves heating a melt to varying temperatures in the vicinity of the melting
point and then cooling it rapidly (quenching). The solid product is then studied
optically or by X-ray methods to ascertain whether crystals have form ed. This
static method is used widely for complex systems.
Supercooling. In the case of natural silicates, as well as with silicates synthe-
sized in the laboratory, the liquid to solid transformation often takes place by
solidification of the melt to a glass, rather th an with th e formation of crystals.
Such a glass does not have adefinite melting point. One observes a temperature
range over which softening of the glass occurs, the softening interval. Such
supercooled melts have no regular crystal structure, but only a minor degree
of molecular order. The supercooling of a melt can occur only in the absence
of a seed crystal of the same composition. Often structurally similar foreign
crys tals will induce crystallization. A good exam ple of the effect of a seed crystal
is the melt of sodium acetate , NaC2Ha0 2 • 3H20, which can be cooled readily
from its melting point at 58.2° C to room temp erature without crystalIization.
Sup ercooling is aided by adding a little water to the normal salt, If a tiny crystal
of the salt is th en thrown into the supercooled melt, the crystallization can be
observed and evolution of the heat of crystallization can be detected, for example,
by means of a thermocoupl e.

182
Some Physical-Chemical Fundamentals
Centers 01 Nucleation. If crystallization of a melt takes place in the absence
of seed crystals, it is observed that at first individual centers of crystallization
(nuclei) spontaneously form, from which crystallization proceeds. The rate of
formation of these nuclei immediately below the melting point is very low. Very
small crystals have a lower melting point than larger megoscopic ones, because
of their much greater surface energy. They are stable, therefore, only at tempera-
tures below the melting point. Such micro-crystals have also a greater solubility.
Th ey are soluble, for example, in an aqueous solution which is already saturated
with respect to larger crystals of the same substance. This situation plays an
importan t role in the metamorphism of rocks, to be discussed later, Thus, from
a melt crystal nuclei first form following some supercooling, even though no

F ig. 285. KH, number of nucleation centers; WG growth rate of the prism faces of nepheline
with increasing supercooling in a melt. (After H. G. F. W INKLER)
nu clei were previously present. Upon further supercooling t he number of centers
of nucleation then increases. It can be ra tionalized that thermal motion at first
allows only ocassional aggregation of atoms or groups of ato ms to form crystals.
With decreasing temperature the probability of crystallization becomes greater,
as shown in Fig. 285, where the curve KH forms a maximum. The number of
centers of nucleation, KH, decreases to zero with greater supercooling, because
now the viscosity of the melt has become so great, that the ions or molecules
can no longer aggregate to form nuclei.
The rate of growth (Fig. 285, WG) of individual nuclei is very low at te mpera-
tures just below the melting point. This increases, as does the number of nucl ei,
with further supercooling because, accompanying the decrease in thermal motion,
there is an increase in the rate of deposition. Only when with decreasing te mpera-
ture there is a significant increase in viscosity, does the rate of growth diminish.
As we have already seen in discussing the geometrical aspects of crystal
growth, it is improper to refer so simply to the rate of growth, and strictly
speaking we should consider growth velocities of individual crystal faces. These
must be investigated individually. From the number of nucleation centers and
the rate of growth, the crystal size as related to supercooling can be calculated.
H. G. WINKLER has been able to correlate the cooling relations with the size
of included crystals in dike rocks (see Fig. 285).

Single Component Systems
183
In order for a glass to form during cooling, the temperature interval in which
nucleation power and growth rate are high must be passed through rapidly.

Phases. We can also consider a crystal and its melt from another viewpoint.
A crystal and its melt both consist of the same matter and are said to constitute
a single component syste m. Crystal and melt are distinguished by means of the
structural arrangement of their constitu-
ent atoms. In the solid state these, as
we know, are for the most part quite
regularly arranged. In the fluid state the
degree of order is much lower, extend-
ing over very small regions or domains.
Frequently the expression " phase "
is
used in this connection. Regions of homo-
geneous character which are separated
by interfaces, are denoted as separate
phases, as for example, the gaseous, fluid ,
and solid phases. Several phases exist
in the solid state, when chemically dif-
0.0- /
ferent crystals occur together, or if one
component occurs in different structural
arrangements (polymorphism).
Equilibrium. A crystal and its melt
at the melting point are said to be in

can be re-
lated to a balance. A small temperature

as we have just seen in discussing the
diagram for H20
supercooling of a melt. Equilibrium is
defined, moreover, in terms of a definite pressure and, strictly speaking, only
for crystals above a certain size. We are referring here to homogeneous (hydro-
static) pressure. When a melting point is indicated without further qualification,
one atmosphere of pressure and a crystal size above 1/1000 mm or 1 (J. is implied.
The System H20. In Fig. 286 are shown the phase relations of water at
different temperatures and pressures. We can see three curves passing through
a common point, the triple point. The two dashed curves define the gaseous
region . To th e left is the stability field for ice and between the fields for ice and
water vapor, is the stability field for liquid water. The boundary curve between
ice and water vapor is called the sublimation curve . At te mperatures and pressures
lying along this curve, ice and the vapor phase are in equilibrium. At P - T
conditions lying along the boundary curve separating liquid water and water
vapor, water boils. This boiling curve terminates at 374
0 C and 225 kg/cm2
pressure, the so-called critical point (see page 226). The solid curve indicates
equilibrium between ice and liquid water and represents the melting curve.
Generally the melting point of a substance is increased as a result of an
increase in pressure. lce is an unusual exception in this respect, a fact which is

important for certain geological processes. Its melting point is lowered by the
application of pressure. If we plot the experimentally determined melting
temperature of iee as a funetion of pressure, wo obtain the eurve shown in Fig. 287.

and thus floats in water. When water freezes it expands and will burst itscontainer
Ü its walls cannot contain the pressure corresponding to the prevailing equilibrium
temperature. If the container is rigid, the water is not able to freeze. Expansion
of ice plays a very important role in rock weathering. As Fig . 286 shows, at a
prevailing pressure of 2,200 kgjcm2, the melting point of ice is _22
0 C. If the
temperature decreases further, and the pressure increases, the structure of ice
changes - a different "modüication" of ice is formed. lce I transforms to ice lII ;
a new solid phase or modification forms in place of the original.

Polymorphism. Changes in structural modification are exceptionally frequent.
This phenomenon is called polymorphism. It was first correctly understood
in 1821 by EILHARD MrTSCHERLICH in Berlin. As early as 1788 the Berliner
mineral-chemist KLAPROTH had observed that calcite has the same chemical
composition -
CaCOa -
as aragonite, although the former crystallized with
ditrigonal-scalenohedral morphology, the latter orthorhombic-dipyramidal. The
findings of KLAPROTH were in conflict with the generally accepted definition of
HAÜY of a "mineral species", according to which every chemical substance
could occur with only one basic morphology. As a result of very detailed analysis,
a variety of impurities, such as MgO, FeO, and MnO were found in calcite, and
were suspected to be the cause of the anomalous morphology. In 1813 STROH-
MEYER in Göttingen consistently found in his aragonites strontium which had
been discovered by KLAPROTH in 1793. This had been overlooked by other

Single Component Systems
185
analysts. Additional analysts confirmed most of bis results, which suggested
th e small amount of strontium impurity to be the cause of the anomalous calcite
crystal form. This interpretation brought to a elose the old concept of mineral
form,
when

that
Na 2H P0 4 • H 20 and sulfur have duplicate morphologies. A profusion of discoveries
followed and today the number of similar observations is too numerous to mention.
The dependence of polymorphie transformations on structural arrangement
has already been elaborated in detail in the chapter on Crystal Chemistry
(p.55- 65). There we have seen that in the case of the carbonates, nitrates,
and borates, the structure with small cations in trigonal array is stable ; with
large cations, in orthorhombic array. In CaCOa and KNOa the cation size is such
that at one atmosphere pressure at low temperatures, the orthorhombic, and at
high temperatures the trigonal forms are stable. On the other hand, at high
pressures the trigonal calcite
can be converted to orthorhombic aragonite .
Examples of other kinds of polymorphism will be referred to in specific places
later.
From the standpoint of the concept of equilibrium, two structural modifications
of the same substance can, as with a crystal and a melt , at a given pressure, be
in equilibrium with one another at a definite temperature (for example at 2,200
kg/cm2 and _22
0 C in the case of ice I and In). Their stability fields are separated
by a boundary curve, analogous to a melting curve in a pressure-temperature
diagram. In the one field one modification crystallizes and is stable ; in th e neigh-
boring field the other is stable. Like supercooled melts, differing structural
modifications can form under temperature -pressure conditions for which they
are not stable. Such metastable modifications can be extremely persistent ; even
more so than a supe rcooled melt or glass.
Let us summariz e once more by means of the diagram for the syste m H 20
(Fig.286). Using pressure and temp erature as coordinates, the lines of the
diagram represent the boundaries between two phases. We have in the upper
left of the diagram the stability field of ice In, below it the field of ice 1. From
it, by means of the melting curve, the field for water lies to the right , and below
this the field for water vapor. This is bounded from the field of ice I above by
the sublimation curve, and from water by the boiling curve. Points at which
three boundary curves converge, here the melting, boiling, and sublimation
curves, are designated as triple points. We have, therefore, the four stability
fields of the phases water, water vapor, ice l and ice In. We shall say no more
abo ut the other modifications of ice which have been produced artificially.
The System Si02
0 We shall refer now to another single component system -
the
system Si02, shown schematically in Fig. 288. At earth surface te mperature
and pressure, low quartz is stable. At 575
0 C it transforms to high quartz and
at 870
0 C tridymite appears. Above 1,470 °C cristobalite is the stable phase .
It is to be noted, moreover, that the transformation low-high quartz takes place
without delay upon heating. It can be rationalized that only minor structural
changes are necessary during this transformation (see p. 62). During the trans-
formation of high quartz to tridymite, the structure must be significantly
reconstructed. This transformation is promoted in melts of LiCI or Na 2W04• In
this case some alkali is ineluded in the tridymite structure . Melts of silica can
be supercooled easily, produ cing a glass that is technically useful in laboratory
ware, because of its insensitivity to te mperature
changes and to acids. In
addition silica glass is used in ultraviolet lamps, because it transmits light in
this wave length region. Tridymite and cristobalite can be supercooled also.
The low temperature modifications of tridymite and cristobalite can exist also

186
Some Physioal-Chemical F und amentals
at low temperatures. There exist all gradations from amorphous silica gel to the
poorly crystallized iX-cristobalite in opals to ß-cristobalite. An additional Si02
modification has been produ ced in the laboratory. At very high pressures coesite
and at higher ones , stishovite form (Table 34). Both phases are also found naturally

where very high temperatures and pressures developed from the impact of
meteorites on quartz bearing rocks, as for example in the Meteor Crater in Arizona
and in the Nördlinger Ries .
Quartz which crystallizes above 575
0 C converts upon cooling to low-quartz.
Since high quartz has a higher hexagonal symmetry than trigonallow-quartz, the
former converts upon cooling into twins of low quartz. The twinning takes place
according to the Dauphinee law (p. 98), in which the 3-fold axis takes on additional
2-fold symmetry and becomes a 6-fold axis. From the orientation of the twin
planes relative to the crystal faces, it is possible under favorable circumstances,
as 0 . MÜGGE showed in 1907, to determine whether the twinning is a growth
phenomenon taking place below 575
0 C, or whether it is a matter involving
conversion from high-quartz. If one first etches the crystal, making the twin
planes visible, and then notes that they are intersected by the trapezohedral
and dipyramidal faces, crystallization above 575
0 C is confirmed. In the case of
growth twins, however, the twin planes and crystal faces coincide. Untwinned
crystals must have formed below 575
0 C. In this way quartz can be used as a
geologie thermometer, giving information on the temperature of formation of a
rock. The temperature of the lew-high quartz inversion changes with pressure,
as Fig. 288 shows. If this is not taken into account, the "thermometer" indicates
tempcratures which are too low.
The System Carbon. As a third example of a single component system, we
will consider the carbon system. It is generally known that there are two modi-
fications of carbon, graphite and diamond. For a number of ycars it has
been possible to treat this system not
only theoretically but also experimen-
tally. It is now possible to synthesize
diamond in its stability field with the
help of catalysts. In Fig. 289 the cross-
hatched area indicates the P-T con-
ditions under which diamond has been
synthesized. The graphite-diamond
transformation curve is slightly in-
clined to the left in the diagram. The
graphite - melt curve isvery steep. The
diagram shows that at earth surface
temperatures and pressures diamondis
unstable.Diamondshave been foundin
meteorites (Arizona crater), therefore

ture and pressure that can be shown in
Fig. 289. It is more difficult toexplain,
with thehelp ofthis diagram. the occur-
rence of diamonds in volcanic pipes.
3. Two Component Systems
The System KNOa-H20. Until now we have considered only single component
systems. How do the crystallization relations change, when we have two compo-
nents, for example, when KNOa crystallizes from an aqueous solution ! Based
on the usual growth process, it would appear that there is nothing fundamental
to change in our thinking. The deposition of ions should take place just as from

188
Some Physical-Chemical Fundamentals
a melt. It is likely, however, that differences will occur, since in addition to the
individual ions of the one component, water molecules are present. Very likely
these could have an influence on the kind of face development, and influence
the crystal habit.
In the case of KNOa, the orthorhombic modification is stable below 127.8° C.
This should precipitate from aqueous solution at room temperature. However,
if we allow a drop of concentrated KNOa solution to evaporate under the micro-
scope, the formation of trigonal rhombohedral crystals is first observed. These

hedral crystals are transformed upon contact with the later forming orthorhombic needles
(middle right). In their vicinity the rhombohedra are dissolved (left above)
should be stable only above 127.8° C. Thus an unstable structural type appears
first , a phenomenon which has been observed among other substances, and is
still not adequately explained, although it is referred to as the " Ostwald step
rule " . Following the rhombohedral crystals, orthorhombic needles precipitate,
mostly from th e border of the drop (Fig. 290). When these needles, during their
growth, extend into the vicinity of a rhombohedron, the latter is dissolved (upper
left of Fig. 290). If a needle comes in contact with a rhombohedron, the latter
changes into an aggregate of orthorhombic crystals (center right of Fig. 290). In
this way the instability at room temperature of the trigonal modification can be
observed directly.
The System Diopside-Anorthite. In considering equilibrium in two component
systems, we must keep in mind that we are dealing with three variables, tempera-
ture, pressure , and the concentration of the two constituents. Strictly speaking
we must represent the phase diagram in three dimensions. Usually a two-dimen-
sional diagram is used, in which the pressure is assumed to be constant. The
influence of pressure can be important for rock forming processes, so we shall
give it consideration later on. We shall first consider situations in which the
pressure is held constant. Usually we let the abscissa represent the variation in
concentration (Fig.291). The left corner of the diagram , labelIed diopside, re-
presents 100% pure CaMg[SiOa]2; at the right , 100% anorthite , Ca[AI2Si20 s].

Two Component Systems
189
The ordinate represents the temperature. If we assurne that our diagram is to
represent apressure of one atmosphere, we can plot on th e temperature axis the
melting point of diopside at 1,390°C and of anorthite at 1,550°C. Impurities or
admixtures lower the melting or freezing temperatures of each end member, the
temperature decrease at low concentrations being proportional to the number
of moles added. (Raoult-van t 'Hoff law). The two melting curves decrease
toward the center and meet at a common point. A normal to the abscissa from this
point gives the composition of the lowest melting mixture, in this case 1,270°C

Fig. 291. The binary system, diopside-anorthite (after B OWEN) circles represent experimental
points
at 42 % anorthite. This point is called the eutectic point (from Gr. eu, good;
tectein, to melt). In hydrous systems this point is called the cryohydratic point
(Gr. kryos, frost) . In such a diagram the region above th e melting curve is the
stability field of the melt. Points on the curve represent melt and crystal in
equilibrium-diopside crystals on th e left and anorthite on the right. If we start
with a melt of composition X (Fig. 291) and temperature 1,439°C, nothing hap-
pens upon cooling until the melting curve is reached at 1,350°C. At this point
diopside crystals precipitate out, the residual melt becoming richer in anorthite.
The melt remains in equilibrium with diopside crystals and changes its compo-
sition along the melting curve until, at 1,270°C, the eutectic composition is
rcached. At this point both diopside and anorthite precipitate out until no melt
remains. The composition of the total mass of diopside and anorthite corresponds
to that of the original melt. We would experience analogous behavior if we had
started out with an anorthite-rich melt. Then anorthite would precipitate out
first until, at th e eutectic point, diopside and anorthite would co-precipitate.
In such two component systems, determination of the melting curves is
carried out with th e aid of the crystallization curves of different compositions,
as shown in Fig. 292.
Eutectic Structures. The structures which result from th e crystallization of
such two component systems are very informative. These simple relationships
can serve as a model for the more complex magmatic rocks. If a melt does not
have exactly the eutectic composition, the first crystals to precipitate outdepend
on which side of the eutectic point the composition lies. Following crystallization,
we would find relatively large crystals of one kind in a finer grained groundmass
of th e two components . These struct ures are analogous to those of many magmatic

190
Some Physical-Chemical F undamentals
rocks. In addition, this simple model shows that the crystallization sequence
has nothing to do with the melting temperature of the two end members. A mine-
ral with high melting point like anorthite can be precipitated at lower temperature
and later than a low melting companion, such as diopside. The temperature of
formation of a mineral depends, therefore, also on the composition of the melt .

At the eutectic composition one frequently observes with metals structures
which have a certain similarity to those of the so-called graphie granites. The
latter exhibit cross-sections of quartz in potassium feldspar which resemble
Hebraic characters (Fig. 293). It is disputed, however, whether the components
are crystallized as eutectic systems. All of these kinds of structure are by no
means to be explained in this way.
Influence 01 Pressure. We want now to bring pressure into the picture, by
calculating from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation the increase in melting point
with pressure. This is necessary because direct observation of the influence of
pressure on such silicatc systems cannot be made rapidly. The equation is :

P is the pressure, T the absolute temperature of the melting point (0C + 273°),
Vfl the specific volume of the melt, and v"r of the crystal, and Q the heat of
melting. We find a 19° melting point increase for every 1,000 kgJcm2 pressure

Fig. 294. Pressure, temperature, concentration diagram for the system, diopside-anorthite
increase for diopside, and onIy a 4° increase for anorthite. The experimental
investigations by YODER in 1952 gave a value for diopside of 13°C for 1,000kgJcm2
over the range of pressure shown in Fig . 294. In this figure the eutectic point
becomes a line, ascending with increasing pressure and shifting laterally at the
same time (somewhat exaggerated in the figure) . However, the shift in eutectic
composition is more pronounced than the rise in eutectic temperature. The
melting curve of Fig.294 has become a slightly curved surface. Let us now
consider two melts of the same composition and at the same temperature. Point 1
(behind the plane of the diagram) is at high pressure, point l ' (in the plane of
the diagram) at low pressure. If the melt is near to the eutectic composition, it
may happen, because of the slope of the eutectic line, that upon cooling at con-
stant pressure (isobar) the same melt will at high pressure (point 1) crystallize
out diopside, hut at low pressure (point 1') anorthite. A rock solidified under
pressure at depth can produce different crystallization products than one crystalli-
zed at the earth's surface. If we cool a melt under high pressure until crystaIs are

192

precipitated (point 2), and then reduce the pressure (point 2') the previously
precipitated crystals are again melted. This is analogous to a sudden outpouring
of lava in connection with a volcanic eruption. If we then continue to cool the
melt at the lower pressure (point 2'), it can happen that we are now on the oppo-
site side of the eutectic point (point 3), as shown in Fig. 294, and that now the
other kind of crystals precipitate out.
Also, a solidified rock can, by pressure reduction, become fluid again. (Com-
pare points 3 and 3' in Fig. 294.) This might happen if pressure is relieved by
formation of a crack or fissure. Since the melt would be lighter than the solid
rock, it could aseend into th e fissure. In this way basaltic magmas can make
their way from depth to the surface.
Early formed crystal inclusions may in both cases not always be completely
remelted. They can remain as corroded residues.

In many eruptive rocks we can observe quartz inclusions which exhibit signs
of solution. Fig . 295 shows this phenomenon in a rhyolite. Such corroded olivine
inclusions have also been observed. Our simple model indicates clearly how such
phenomena can take place. However, we must be aware that other possible
explanations may be equally appropriate (p. 194, 205).
Gibbs' Phase Rul e. Our previous knowledge of the equilibrium relations and
fields of stability of individual phases can be summarized in the GIBBS' Phase
Rule (1876). The individual phases of the single component system - H 20 ,
water, water vapor, ice I and III, have been illustrated figuratively in a two-
dimensional diagram. We could freely vary pressure and temperature within
these two dimensions. We can say that we have two degrees of freedom. The
phase relationships between two phases in equilibrium, such as water with
water vapor or ice I or ice III, are represented by a curve. If we arbitrarily select
the pressure, the temperature is likewise fixed. We have in this case only one
degree of freedom. If finally we wish to have three phases together in equilibrium,

Two Component Systems
193
such as water, water vapor, and ice 1 or water, ice I and ice IU, the equilibrium
is represented by a tripie point. Pressure as weil as temperature is fixed. We
have accordingly no degrees of freedom. If several components, for example,
diopside and anorthite, occur together, an additional variable, or degree of
freedom is introduced, the concentration. So for a melt at temperatures above
the melting surface (Fig. 294), we have three degrees of freedom . If a melt is to
be in equilibrium with one kind of crystal, we would be allowed 2 degrees of
freedom, temperature and pressure varying along the melting surface ; to be in
equilibrium simultaneously with two kinds of crystals, two degrees of freedom
permiting variation along the eutectic line. Thus in a single component system,
there are two degrees of freedom for one phase, one degree for equilibrium be-
tween two phases, and no degrees of freedom for three phase equilibrium. This can
be form ulated as foliows :
No. of phases + no. of degrees of freedom = no. of components + 2 .
While we are already familiar with the use of the terms phase (p. 183) and
degree of freedom, it is necessary to define more precisely the term" component".
Perhaps it would be better to say " independent constituent". In usage one must
be careful to count only those constituents which can transform from one phase
to another independently of other constituents. A shorthand expression for the
GIBB'S phase rule is :
P+F= C+2 .
In rocks often we shall be able to consider the concentrations and, therefore,
the number of independent constituents, as fixed. At the same time pressure and
temperature can be varied over a wide range. Thus we ha ve two degrees of free-
dom and P = C. The number of phases (kinds of minerals) equal the number of
components present. This is the mineralogical phase rule emphasized first by
V. M. GOLDSCHMIDT.
All of this and the following considerations apply only to equilibrium reactions.
In petrology we must be aware that equilibrium will not always be obtained.
We shall be able, however, to recognize this disequilibrium, only if we understand
equilibrium.
The System Leucite-i-Slü.; We return to our simple eutectic system, which
we have described in Fig.291, and ask the question, " What happens if the
two components A and B react with one another and form a third compound
A 2B?". In such a case we would have two two -component systems, A -A2B
and A 2B - B . Diagramatically the two systems would be drawn side by side.
The situation becomes somewhat complicated if the compound A 2B under-
goes decomposition, as is often the case, before reaching the melting point. We
shall select as an exampie the system leucite, K (AISi20s)- Si02 , in which the
intermediate compound K-feldspar, K(AISi30s) forms. As the phase diagram
(Fig.296) shows , the K-feldspar melts with decomposition
(incongruently)
at 1,170° C. If a melt of the K-feldspar composition is cooled, leucite crystals
precipitate out below th e temp erature corresponding to the intersection of th e
melting curve (about 1,550° Cl. Leucite crystallazition continues until 1,170° C.
At lower temperature the previously form ed leucite crystals are dissolved in
reacting with the melt to form K -feldspar crys tals, if enough time is pro vided
so that equilibrium can be maintained. With fur ther cooling, the comp osition
of the melt arrives at the eutectic point and then K -feldspar and tridymite
crystallize out together. The latter converts to quartz up on further cooling .
Melts whose compositions lie between K(AISi20s) and K(AISi30s) do

crystallize out tridymite, because the available Si0 2 is used up first. The early
formed leucite does not completely disappear , but only to the extent that it
corresponds to the leucite : K-feldspar ratio in the melt. Only the first formed
leucite crystals are lost through reaction with Si02• In general, in systems with
an incongruent melting point , dissolution effects on crystals can occur with out
pressure changes, as described in p. 192. We note in addition from Fig.296,
that quartz and leucite cannot occur togeth er, at least if equilibrium is to be
attained.

This incongruent melting can be demonstrated very beautifully with th e salt
hydrohalite , NaCI-H20, according to BRAI TSCH . Monoclinic (pseudohexagonal)
crystals up to 2 mm in size crystallize out of a solution of NaCI, saturated at
30° C, when cooled to abo ut
_ 100C. At room temperature the birefringent
hydrohalite crystals can be recognized in a microprojector as they are decomposed
with the precipitation of NaCI crystals.

l\Iixed Crystal Systems (Solid Solution). A fur th er complication arises if the
two components form mixed crystals with one another, as in the system anorthite,
Ca (AI2Si20s)-albite, Na (AISiaOs). These particular mixed crystals are called
plagioclase . The two components are considered as complctely miscible for this
discussion (see, however, p. 76). Their phase diagram is illustrated in Fig. 297.
We note that two curves connect the melting points of th e two end members.
The upper one serves as the lower boundary of the stability field of the melt
(liquidus) ; th e other as the upper boundary of the solid phase field (solidus).
We shall trace again the fate of a melt, for example, of composition An50, upon
cooling. When the liquidus curve is reached, a solid phase begins to crystallize
out. The composition of the precipitated mixed crys tal is obtained by drawing
a line parallel to the abcissa from the point of intersection on the liquidus. The
point of intersection with the solidus gives the composition of the mixed crystals
in equilibrium with th e melt at this temperature. The melt changes its composition
along the liquidus with further cooling. The mixed crystals change composition
along the solidus until the point is reached at which they have the composition
of the original melt. Then the melt is completely crystallized. If we had under-
taken the cooling so slowly tha t equilibrium could be continually maintained ,
th e plagioclase crystals would have continuously reacted with the melt and
possessed finally the exact composition of the original melt . If, however, cooling
had proceeded so rapidly that the first formed crystals could not react with the
melt , the resulting crystals would have cores consisting of the first formed
anorthite-rich plagioclase and outer layers poorer in anorthite than the final melt.
The continuous plagioclase solid-solution series can be subdivided into memb ers
to which special names are given. Different authors do not agree on the exact sub-
division into memb ers. We shall use the following divisions (see appendix p. 422).

In systems in which the melting behavior is similar to the plagioclase system,
it is common for the centers of crystals to be richer in the higher melting
component . The olivine syste m, Mg2Si04 - Fe 2Si0 4, is analogous. In this case
Mg2Si04 is the higher melting component, and natural olivine crystals show
repeated zoning, becoming more iron- rich toward the outside of the crystal.
If we heat a crystal, the processes involved in cooling a melt are reversed.
That is, first an albite-rich melt is form ed, which beeomes more and more
anorthite-rieh along the liquidus with further heating, until the melt has the
composition of the original plagioclase erystal. Again the crystals in equilibrium
with the melt being produced change their composition along th e solidus. If
equilibrium is not maintained, crystals with albitic cores and anorthitic shells
result , the zoning being reversed from that produced by crystallization.
In general in multicomponent systems, the curve representing complete
crystallization up on cooling and initiation of melting upon heating is called the
solidus ; the boundary curve between the melt and the onset of crystallization,
th e liquidus.
Ionic Capture. The phenomenon, illustrated by plagioclase, that in mixed
crystals higher valence ions are preferentially "captured ", plays an important
role in geochemistry. By capture we refer to the fact that a higher proportion of
th e highest valence ion enters into the crystalline phase than is retained by the
13·

196
Some Physical-Chemical Fundamentals
melt. Such capture is associated with two conditions. First the melting curve
must decrease continuously from the melting point of the higher melting com-
pound to the lower. Also, as with plagioclase, the high melting end member
must also contain the higher valence ion. In addition, it is necessary that equi-
librium be interrupted, either by incomplete reaction of the first-formed crystals
by rapid cooling, or by isolation from their original environment by settling in a
large magma chamber. FinalIy, the inclusion of the higher valence ions must
result in a charge balance in the crystal. In plagioclase, if the divalent Ca++ ion
replaces monovalent Na" ions, the charge is compensated by the coupled sub-
stitution of a trivalent AI+++ ion for a tetravalent Si++++ ion, The balance can
be attained also by creation of lattice vacancies, as in the case of LiCI-MgCI2
solid solution (p. 91).

Fig. 298. The system CdI2 - Cu212 • Solid solution with a minimum. (After H ER Z and B ULLA)
If one plots diagramatically the foreign ion content in the crystalline phase
against that in the melt or solution, at low concentrations of foreign ions in
mixed crystals, an essentially linear plot results. The absorption of the foreign
ions folIows the Nernst distribution law, that is, at low concentrations the number
of foreign ions in the crystalline phase is proportional to th e concentration in the
solution or melt.
In solid solution systems the liquidus and solidus can exhibit also a minimum,
as illustrated in Fig. 298 for the system CuI-CdI 2 • In this case, on the CdI 2 side,
Cd is captured in the solid phase, on the Cu2I 2 side, the lower valence ion Cu.
This latter form of ion substitution is referred to as admission.
The inclusion of foreign ions into a lattice in addition is very dependent upon
the magnitudes of the ionic radii as we have already seen (p. 64). Only atoms or
groups of atoms which are of the proper size to fit into the assemblage can be
accepted into a crystal. The " fit " is a relative term. It depends on the lattice
type and especially on temperature. The higher the temperature, the more

easily can a structure accommodate a constituent which is somewhat too large
or small. It is further evident that ions of less suitable size are admitted into a
crystal in more restricted numbers. This leads to restricted or limited miscibility
between the two end members. An informative phase diagram in this respect
is that for the system NaCI-KCI (Fig. 299). Upon cooling from a melt, mixed
crystals of all compositions between the two end members can be obtained. In
this system both the
liquidus
and
solidus form a minimum at 663
0 C. From
Kfll -rich melts, KCI-rich crystals pre-
cipitate first ;from NaCI-rich melts come
NaCI-rich crystals. Again ,if equilibrium
is maintained, the final mixed crystals
will have a composition corresponding
to that of the initial melt. Upon further
cooling of the mixed crystals of inter-
mediate composition, it can be observed
that they unmix, undergoing a rear-
rangement in the solid state. Lamellae
of NaCI appear in KCI crystals, or vice-
versa, depending on the composition of
the initial melt and crystals. The lower
curve in Fig. 299 indicates the tempera-
tures at which this unmixing or ex-
solution takes place. The system of

lamellae produced is similar to that which can be observed in many feldspars,
which are called perthites (Fig.300). In this case also the exsolution involves
K- and Na-compounds, namely K(AIS~08)' orthoclase, and Na(AIS~08)' albite.
K + has an ionic radius of 1.33 A, Na + 0.98 A. Apparently at low tempera-
tures the one ion does not fit into the structure of the other compound.
This is confirmed further in the system KNOa-NaNOa (Fig. 301). If we com-
pare the two systems (Fig.299 and 301), we observe in the NaCI-KCI system
a wide temperature gap between the
solidus and exosolution curves. In the
system KNOa-NaNOa the exosolution
curve intersects the liquidus and solidus
curves and becomes, in fact , apart of
the latter. The maximum extent of solid
solution in the system KNOa-NaNOa
is indicated in Fig. 301 by the dashed
lines. One sees also that a melt of eu-
tectic composition crystallizes as a mix -
ture of crystals exhibiting the maxi-
mum amount of solid solution in each
phase. With decreasing temperature the
mixed crystals revert in composition
to that of the two pure end-members.
The expression liquidus is frequent-
ly used more generally for the melting
curve in systems in
which no solid-
solution is involved . Thus in the system
diopside-anorthite (Fig. 291), the hori -
zontal line is the solidus, the melting
curve the liquidus. In systems having
immiscibility gaps, as in Fig. 301, the
pair of lines separating the field of the
melt and fields II and III represent the liquidus. Those lines along the boundary
between fields I and II, II and V, III and V, and III and IV represent a solidus.
4. Three Component Systems
The Concentration Triangle. We want to turn now to the three component
systems. Therefore, we must now consider three constituents, in addition to
pressure and temperature. We can represent variations in composition in one
planar diagram, if we represent the sum of the three as equal to 100% and utilize
the percentages to represent each constituent. For representation we use an
equilateral triangle (Fig. 302). At any corner the concentration of one component
is 100%, the other two 0%. The geometrical locus representing 33% A is a line
drawn parallel to BG at a distance 33 from BG. Likewise 16% Bis represented
by a line parallel to AG at a distance 16 from AG. From the intersection of these
two lines, the composition of the three component system is uniquely determined.
The line parallel to AB, representing 51% G must pass through the intersection
of the other two lines. Thus a point at the intersection of the three lines represents
a composition 33% A, 16% B , 51% G. The sides of the composition triangle
correspond to two-component systems. We need now only to construct the con-
centration-temperature diagrams for the two-component systems, to derive a

That
depends completely on the kind of sys-
tem. When we join three simple eutectic
two-component or binary systems of the
sort shown in Fig. 291 (p. 189), we get
within the triangle a ternary eutectic
point, connectcd to each of the binary
eutectic points by eutectic lines.

albite-anorthite-diopside, illustrated in
Fig. 303. We have already dealt indivi-
dually with two of the binary systems.
The third system, albite-diopside, has
an eutectic point very elose to the pure
albite end and exhibits no solid solu-
tion. In the resulting three component
(ternary) system, there is no ternary
eutectic point, only an eutectic line or
trough. In

situation just as a cartographer deals
with topography. Contour lines of the
temperature gradients,
so-called iso-

triangle,
as
is
indicated in
Fig.303. The system is in this way
represented to scale in Fig. 304. There-
fore, within the triangle, we have repre-
sented two
kinds of information at
the same time: concentration and the
configuration of the crystallization pla-
nes and lines. Weshall consider first a
melt with the composition 50 % diop-
side, 25 % albite, and 25% anorthite.
If the temperature of this melt sinks
to 1,275°C, only erystals of diopside
begin to crystallize out. The residual
melt beeomes depleted in diopside, and
its concentration is ehanged upon fur-
ther eooling along a line eonneeting the
eomposition of the melt and the di-

system, are more anorthite-rieh than is the melt. We ean determine their eompo-

sition from Fig. 297. Orystallization on the solidus is not altered by the presence
of diopside. Upon further cooling, the melt changes its composition along the
eutectic line. In order to determine the composition of the crystalline phase in
equilibrium at any point on the eutectic line, we must extend, until it cuts the
plagioclase side of the triangle, a line connecting the point with the diopside
corner. From Fig. 297 we ascertain the solidus composition in equilibrium with
the point of intersection on the plagioclase liquidus. So, in the case of our starting
composition, we find th at crystallization on the eutectic line ceases at about
1,200°0, because at this temperature the plagioclase crystals have the composition

Anso, the same albite :anorthite ratio as the initial melt. It is assumed that
equilibrium was maintained. This would be the case for very slow cooling. If the
cooling takes pla ce more rapidly so that equilibrium is not achieved, or if the first
formed plagioclase crystals are removed, then the crystallization of diopside and
plagioclase must continue past 1,200°0. The melt becomes richer in albite than
when equilibrium prevails, since no anorthite is available from the dissolution
of the first form ed plagioclase. Finally the fluid phase attains a composition at
which plagioclase, richer in albite than before, is crystallized out along with
diopside.
We want to discuss the method for constructing crystallization paths for a
somewhat more complicated case, referring to Fig. 305. If we cool down a melt,
represented by point 1 in the plagioclase field, we determine the composition of
the plagioclase which precipitates out by cooling to the liquidus surface, similarly
as above. We draw a line through point 1 and the diopside corner. Its intersection,
LI ' with the plagioclase side of the triangle gives us, purely geometrically, the
albite :anorthite ratio of the melt . We ascertain from Fig. 297 the corresponding
ratio on the solidus and plot this point SI on the plagioclase side of the triangle.
In order to construct the crystallization path to the eutectic line, we take now a

maintained always. If this is not the ease, if anorthite is removed from the system,
it behaves as a system rieher in albite. This disequilibrium is especially important
in rock formation , as we shall see.
These few examples must be sufficient to show what great importance the
theory of heterogeneous equilibrium, as this branch of physical ehemistry is
called, has for mineralogy. A deep understanding of this field is strongly recom-
mended for every prospective mineralogist . Phase diagrams are only elear sum-
maries of observational data, but the nature of the summary, and conve rsely the
meaning of the phase diagrams require a certain familiarity with t he diversity
of phenomena.
5. Hydrous Melts
Until now we have considered only dry systems. In the last decade a number
of hydrous syste ms have been investigated at high temperatures and pressures.
We have man y reasons to assume that water has played an imp ortan t role in the
occurrenee of magmatic rocks (see p. 223). Therefore, four important examples
of the influence of water on the crystallization of rock forming minerals will be
considered.

gram (Fig. 307) only one specific water vapor pressure of 5,000 kg/cm 2 has been
illustrated. The melting curves at lower water vapor pressures would lie between
those for 5,000 and 0 kg/cm 2• This diagram, in combination with Fig. 294, shows

VI. Formation of Magmatic (Igneous) Rocks
1. Differentiation
Tbe Reaction Principle. Tbe rocks of the earth's crust are divided usually
into three groups : magmatic rocks which crystallize from a fluid melt, sedimen-
tary rocks which are mechanically or chemical-biologically formed from weather-
ing products, and metamorphie rocks which form by transformation processes
from the two previously mentioned groups. The transition between magmatic
and metamorphie rocks is gradational and subdivision somewhat arbitrary.
In the following we shall consider as magmatic all rocks which are produced
from a melt, regardless of the manner in which th e melt originated. There remains,
however, in many instances, doubt as to whether a rock has crystallized from a
true melt, that is, one which was at one time completely fluid , or whether it is
related to partial melting or to transformation produ cts under th e influence of
gases and fluid s. These pro cesses will be considered in part IX on metamorphism.
Probably the most striking aspect to eonsider coneerning magmatie rocks
formed from a melt , is the observation that all graduations exist between light
colored, quartz-rich, low density rocks and low silica, dark, high density ones.
Again and again attempts have been made to explain the diversity of rock types
by modifications of one primary magma. In fact, aseries of processes can be
advan ced which, depending on the circumstances, lead to variable end produ cts
upon cooling of a melt . One possibility is based on the mixed crys tal formation
in the plagioclase system, arising from incomplete attainment of equilibrium as
referred to above (p. 195). Let us assurne that an orthite-rieh plagioc1ase erys tal-
lizes out of a magma first. These erystals are heavier th an th e melt , sink down
into the magma chamber, and are removed from reaction with the surrounding
melt. Thus th e melt becomes enriched in albite. A continuous crystallization
series results, perhaps with bytownite resulting in the lower part of the magma
chamber and oligoc1ase or albite in the upper part.
Another but discontinuous series occurs in systems with incongruent melting
points. As an example, let us consider the two component system, MgO-Si02 ,
iIIustrated in Fig.310. Between Si02 (which occurs as cristobalite at the tem-
peratures iIIustrated) and Mg2Si04 (forsterite, an end member of th e olivine
series), there occurs the compound MgSi03 , enstatite ' . In effect, enstatite is
a diopside in which Ca has been replaced by Mg. It can serve as a representative
of the large family of pyroxenes. Enstatite melts incongruently with decompo-
sition into forsterite and Si0 2 at 1,557°C. From a melt containing 60% Si0 2 ,
forsterite crystallizes out first upon cooling to th e melting curve . If the tempera-
ture is lowered stilI further, point D may be reached, at which temperature forste-
rite and melt are no longer in equilibrium. The previously formed forsterite
crystals react with the melt to form enstatite crystals. The forsterite crys tals are
resorbed, th erefore. Some of the solution features which are observed with
magmatic olivines may be referred to such processes. If the early form ed forsterite

in the following discussion we shall always refer to the natural mineral enstatite.

crystals were removed from the melt, for example by settling, enstatite crystalli-
zation would occur directly, until, at point E, enstatite and cristobalite would
crystallize out together.

Such mineral reactions upon cooling give rise to the discontinuous series,
forstcrite-enstatite. If we refer more generally to olivine and pyroxene, and
enlarge the series to include hornblonde and biotite, and connect this and the
continuous plagioc1ase series with quartz, K-feldspar, and hydrothermal solutions
(see p. 223), as natural observations indicate, we obtain a scheme for the crystalli-
zation sequence of a magma. It corresponds to the crystallization scquence ob-
served in individual rocks.
The continuous plagioc1ase series involves framewerk silicates. In the dis-
continuous olivine-biotite series crystal structures change progressively from
inosilicates with discrete [Si04 ] tetrahedra, into chain and ribbon silicates, to
sheet structures. Bonding energies increase in this sequence. The two series
indicate for us the mineral composition of the most important eruptive rocks,
as the following scheme shows :

Formation of Magmatio (Igneous) Rocks
If we rearrange the two series so that the heavy minerals of the lefthand
series are arranged in a horizontal row, with the light minerals above them, and
then insert the corresponding magmas in between, we obtain the schematic
listing shown below .

This shows how, by means of differential setting of minerals in the melt, acid
(siliceous) rocks can originate from a basic magma. From a magma of the eom-
position of a mixture of anorthite and olivine, bytownite and olivine crystallize
out first. If these crystals were isolated from reaction, labradorite and pyroxene
would follow, forming a rock that corresponds to a gabbro. If these minerals were
also removed from the system, hornblende and andesine would crystallize,
forming a diorite, etc. It is to be noted that the basic (silica-poor) rocks also have
a low water content. During the course of this differentiation process, we proceed
from essentially anhydrous to hydrous melts and finally to hydrous residual
solutions (hydrothermal solutions). However, natural rocks are often observed
which do not fit this simple scheme. Many basalts carry olivine, pyroxene, and
andesine, for example.
As we have discussed above, reactions between early crystallized minerals
and the melt take place in the two two-component systems we have used as
models. The concepts employed here to account for chemical differentiation were
emphasized by N . L. BOWEN, and are referred to as the reaction principle . It
provides a far-reaching explanation of the variability of igneous rock magmas.
The subsidence or rise of minerals in a melt in conjunction with reaction is one
of the likely explanations for the variability of igneous rocks. A classic example
is afforded by the Palisades diabase (basalt) sill occurring in the vicinity of
New York City. This is an intrusive sill about 300 meters thick, in which a con-
centration of ab out 20% olivine occurs in a narrow zone 15-20 meters above
the lower contact. It is important that the typical columnar structure of the
basalt extends undistorted through the olivine-rieh zone.
These differentiation processes do not depend on the mode of origin of the
melt, and apply equally well to those originating through metamorphic processes.
Filter Pressing. Progressive separation of early formed crystals from a melt
need not result only from gravitational settling of the heavy constituents. This
can be brought about also by a filter pressing process in which the melt is squeezed
out from the early formed crystals. This can happen when a partiaHy crystallized
melt is subjected to differential pressures. The process is similar to the action
of a fruit press, in which the juice is separated from the pulp. Such a process can
be initiated by mountain building orogenic movements. This process has been
employed to explain the occurrence of some anorthosites, an almost mono-
mineralic rock consisting of calcium-sodium feldspar. The process may play an
even more general role in folded mountain regions.
Assimilation. An additional concept, developed especially by DALY, to explain
magmatic differentiation, is assimilation. This involves inclusion of foreign rocks

into a magma as it mak es its way from depth toward the surface of the earth.
In fact, inclusions of other igneous rocks and sediments which clearly show
signs of alteration or partial solution are often found in magmatic rocks.
We can again formul ate a model to dcscribc this process in simple cases by
choosing again the simple two-component systems albite-anorthite and for-
sterite-Si0 2 •
Let us consider a plagioclase melt (Fig. 297) with the composition 50 %
albite, which has just reached the liquidus curve at 1,450°0. To this melt is added
a plagioclase crystal of composition 10% albite, which is at the same temperature.
We assurne no higher temperature, because a magma that ascends into the
earth's crust in general will be only slightly superheated, th at is, its temp erature
will lie only slightly above that at which th e first crystals begin to crys tallize
out. We know in fact, from natural observations, that at times formation of
crystals in magmas has already begun before intrusion of the magma upwards.
Thus the melting curve was reached previously. Therefore, we are justified in
assuming in our model system that the melt had just attained the temperature
of 1,450°0. At this temperature a plagioclase with 20% albite is in equilibrium
with the melt. Thc added crystal with 10% albite is analogous to a crystal formed
at an earlier stage from the melt.It must react therefore with th e melt to approach
20% albite, if equilibrium is to be maintained. As the inclusion reacts, the melt
maintains its position on the melting curve or surface and the further course of
crystallization is not influenced. Some heat of reaction is evolved. The reaction
is exothermal, because it is an equilibrium reaction which takes place with
decreasing temperature. If this heat is not dissipated, the temperature of the melt
increases somewhat.
If we had added a cold crystal to the melt , at first the melt would cool some-
what with a corresponding lowering of the starting point for further crystalli-
zation. The subsequent course of crys tallization is not affecte d. In each case the
course of crystallization proceeds, in spite of the addition, as it would without
the addition of foreign crystals. However, an end point would be reached with
a higher an orthite content, due to th e introdu ction of this component by the
inclusion . The reaction of the inclusion corres ponds completely to analogous
reactions with crystals first formed directly from a melt, if it remains in equili-
brium with the melt .
If, on th e other hand, we add a plagioclase crystal with 80% albite to the
melt it cannot generally exist at 1,450°0 in th e solid state, and so melts. If it is
colder than the melt when added, the melt is first cooled and the corresponding
feldspar containing 20% albite crystallizes out, that is, if the melt is not super-
heated. In either case, the inclusion is melted and incorporated in the fluid state
into the melt. The melt as a result becomes rioher in albite and takes longer to
crystallize, and then with phases rich er in albite. The course of crystallization
proceeds further to th e right in th e scheme illustrated above (p. 206). Such melt-
.ing of inclusions takes place only when th ey are rioher in albite than the melt .
We can observe the same relationships in the system forsterite-e-Sifig. If
we add forsterite to a melt from whieh enstatite has been crystallized, the forste-
rite reacts with the melt in part or completely, depending upon the amount,
changing to enstatite. If we were to add enstatite to a melt from which forsterite
had crystallized, the enstatite would melt .
We can quite generally conclude, th erefore, that the reaction principle pro-
vides us with information on the behavior of inclusions in magmas. Inclusions
of rocks corresponding in composition to early crys tallization stages react with
the evolution of the heat of reaction, having no effect on subsequent crystalli-

208
Formation of Magmatic (Igneous) Rocks
zation. They are dissolved by the melt. Inclusions, corresponding in composition
to later stages of crystallization, are melted although the melt is cooled by them.
The course of crystallization is displaced in the direction of mineral compositions
of later crystallization stages. These considerations are strictly applicable to
igneous rock inclusions. They can, however, be appropriately adapted to sedi-
mentary rock inclusions also. Thus sandstone or quartzite inclusions in basalts
frequently show reaction rims of pyroxene and glass (Fig. 311). By the intro-
duction of quartz the course of crystallization, olivine to pyroxene, is displaced
in the direction of pyroxene. Glass is formed as a result of localized cooling. For

such melting to take place, it is necessary that the heat content of the melt be
sufficiently large to prevent cooling of the total melt . Because th e heat contents
of magmas near the earth's surface are low, inclusions from crustal rocks exhibit
usually only slight reaction (as in Fig.311). Geochemical investigations have
shown in addition that Ca and Mg rich rocks, such as melilites, could not have
been formed by assimilation of limestones or dolomites. They have higher Ni
and Cr contents than could have originated from sediments (WEDEPOHL, 1963).
On this basis we must conclude that the assimilation of sediments by magmas
near the earth's surface plays a much lesser role in altering the Ca, Mg, Si0 2 ,
and Al20 a content of igneous rocks than was earlier assumed. The uptake by
a melt of water from argillaceous sediments appears to be a much more important
phenomenon.

Fluid Immiscibility. Additional modes of differentiation have been suggested.
One of these involves liquid immiscibility of silicate magmas. An example of such
immiscibility is illustrated in the right-hand portion of the diagram for the
system MgO-Si02 (Fig. 310). A melt containing Si02 and minor MgO occurs in
the field bounded by the Si02 ordinate and the dashed line. If we progress hori-
zontally to the left (increasing MgO concentration), at a composition correspond-
ing to the intersection with this dashed line, immiscibility occurs. Beyond this
line two melts coexist. The composition of the two melts corresponds at any
fixed temperature to the intersections of a horizontal line and the two dashed
ones projected on the abscissa. The relative proportions of the two melts depend
on the composition of the initial melt from which they formed. Such immiscibi-
lity in the fluid state provides another possible explanation for the diversity of
magmatic rocks. However, experimental investigations have failed
to
sub-
stantiate an important role for immiscibility in natural silicate systems. Moreover,
the influence of water in a melt appears, based on recent experiment, to render
liquid immiscibility unlikely.

[see DALEY]). S younger sediments; k conglomeratc; G granite; Ga gabbro (norite); 0 older

In sulfide-silicate systems liquid immiscibility does play a role in mineral
formation. The sulfide which occurs frequently in natural melts is pyrrhotite,
Fe 1_ XS. Its melt is heavier than silicate melts and would sink in them. In this
case we can use as a model for this process, the system methyl alcohol-hexane.
We can color 4 ml of methyl alcohol with methyl orange and add 6 ml of hexane.
At room temperature the two fluids do not mix and the hexane remains colorless.
At about 50°C complete miscibility occurs, the resulting fluid becoming homo-
genously orange colored. Upon cooling again fine droplets of methyl alcohol
separate out in the hexane, and sink because of their higher specific gravity
(methyl alcohol 0.79, hexane 0.66). Finally the orange colored methyl alcohol
segregates as aseparate layer. If we were to freeze the system during the stage
of immiscible droplet formation, we would have an analog to the occurrence of
pyrrhotite droplets and schlieren in many gabbros. Complete unmixing of this
kind on a very large scale has been suggested to account for the formation of the
famous Sudbury mineral deposits in Canada (Fig.312). There is considerable
opposition to this interpretation of origin, however. This mineral deposit, as a
result of the crystallization of pentlandite, (Fe, Ni) S, is the most important
nickel deposit in the world . Sudbury ore contains 2.5-3% nickel and had an
annual production in 1938 of about 100,000 T Ni. Similar, but much smaller
mineral deposits occur in Sohland on the Spree, Horbach in the Black Forest
and at Petsamo in northern Finland. In Sudbury platinum is also produced

(1954: 10 T), admixed to the extent of only 0.2 g per ton of ore. This serves as a
good example to stress the economic importance of minor impurities in ores. The
average platinum content of igneous rocks is 0.005 gjT; in ultrabasic rocks,
0.02 gjT. Thus in the Sudbury ore natural processes have already brought about
an enrichment of Pt. Immiscibility has been suggested also as an important
factor in silicate-iron oxide melts. The occurrence of magnetite in drop-like form
has been cited as evidence of liquid immiscibility, even though it is observed
rarely in this form . It is possible that the great magnetite-hematite deposits in
northern Sweden originated by such unmixing of fluid magmas. The origin of
carbonate magmas, as observed in the volcanic eruptions in Tanganyika, could
have originated by immiscibility in the fluid state, as has been established ex-
perimentally in the system albite-NaaCOa.
2. Survey 01 Igneous Rocks
Methods 01 Classification. The changes which a melt can experience, either
by unmixing in the fluid state, assimilation of foreign rocks, or by crystal settling
and filter pressing, suffice to some extent to demonstrate how the diversity of
eruptive rocks originates. The processes themselves are not yet sufficiently under-
stood to permit formulation of a general genetic classification. Therefore, other
criteria must be utilized for systematic classification. Three approaches have been
attempted for classification, based on chemical composition or mineral content,
or on geological relationships. Also the geological age has been utilized with
some success.
Chemical history and mineralogical composition must be closely related, but
the examples of two- and three-component systems have just shown us that
even in such simple cases, different mineral assemblages can form from the same
kind of melt, depending upon the conditions of crystallization. May we be remind-
ed of only one example, the system diopside-anorthite (Fig. 291). For an under-
standing of rock genesis, conditions of crystallization are extremely important.
A pure chemical classification would simply obscure the genetically important
criteria.
The determination of mineral composition is carried out primarily by micro-
scopic studies of thin sections. These are rock slices which have been cut to about
0.03 mm thickness and cemented with Canada balsam (n = 1.537 ± 0.003) or
kollolith (n = 1.533 ± 0.003) onto a glass microscope slide. Such thin sections were
first produced in 1851 by SORBY in England and in 1852 by OSCHATZ in Germany.
Mineral identification in thin section requires the application of crystal optics
(III.5). Crystal optics has always been fostered by mineralogists in practice.
Good petrographic work is not possible without mastery of the methods of crystal
optics. In the case of fine-grained rocks and in other special cases, X-ray methods
are used for mineral identification, especially powder methods. Studying minerals
in rocks, utilizing a variety of methods, constitutes one of the most important
jobs of the mineralogist.
Structures.
Genetically as important as the mineral composition is the
arrangement of the mineral constituents, that is their articulation. This is always
carefully studied and described by petrographers. In Germany, as elsewhere,
a distinction is made between rock structure and rock texture. By structure we
mean the manner of construction from the individual constituents, the building
blocks . By texture we mean a higher order articulation, a spatial arrangement
of equivalent structural groups. For example, a masonry wall built of bricks or

Survey of Igneous Rocks
211
of field stone would be said to have a brick -
01' fieldstonc structure, but a
gothic 01' romantic texture. Unfortunatcly, outside of Germany these expressions
are used in a different sense. For th e most part, in the English speaking countries,
the term "texture" is used to mean structure, and the term " fabrie" to mean
texture. " Structure " corresponds to a still greater order of arrangement, referred
to as Absonderung in Germany, and illustrated by columnar structures in basalts,
jointing in rocks, etc. Because of these differences in usage, it is often useful to
use the more general expression" Gefüge " (in German).
The structure expresses the manner in which the mineral constituents fit
together and contact each other, and indicate, therefore something of the crystal-
lization processes of th e magma. It indicates the crystallization sequence, disso-
lution processes, and other things as well, The structure of a glassy rock, for
example, is informative, because this structure is related especially to the cooling
rate (see p. 182), but is also dependent upon chemical composition. Rocks con-
taining little silica, solidify less often as a glass than silica rich rocks. All grada-
tions exist between glassy (hyaline) and fully crystalline (holo crystalline) rocks.
In predominantly glassy rocks crystallization at times takes place in radial
aggregates 0 1' " spherolites". Often incipient crys tallization takes place forming
hair-like crystals, 0 1' trichytes.
Another important
structural
manifestation is the crystal
morphology.
Crystals which grow without interference in the melt take on their characteristic
morphologies ; the crystals are said to bc euhedral and the rock idiomorphic.
Earlier formed crystals hinder the growth of crystals form ed later, interfering
with their development. Thus they show only partial morphological development
and are said to bc sub-hedral, and the rock containing them, hypidiomorphic.
If morphology is completely undeveloped , the crys tals are anhedral and the rock
allotriomorphic 0 1' xenomorphic. If the crystals are anhedral as a result of simul-
taneous crystallization of all the constituents, the rock is said to be panidiomor-
phic. A special case of this is the graphie granitic structure, also referred to as
micropegmatic,
granophyritic,
pegmatophyritic,
0 1'
micrographic
structure.
When dealing with K vfeldspar-quartz assemblages, DRESCIIER-KADEN suggested
the term Schriftgranite (graphie-granite) if th e quartz is partially bounded by
planar surfaces ; if not he suggests the term granophyre. He suggests the term
myrmekite for analogous plagioclase-K feldspar-quartz assemblages. We had
noted earlier (p. 191) th e similarity between these and eutectic stru ctures. Similar
structures can also form by means of replacement phenomena, as we shall note
later when we discuss metamorphism.
Finally, of special genetic significance is the relative grain size of the mineral
constituents of a rock. As a result of uniform, very slow cooling, as occurs with
magmas crystallizing at great depth, the individual crystals all grow to ab out
the same size. Under th ese conditions diffu sion transfers sufficient matter, in the
time available, to permit formation of an equigranular structure. An example
is illustrated in Fig. 313.
It is possible to study directly the crystallization of other types of rock
struc tures , as we observe lava flows from volcanoes. Melts such as th ese, which
are suddenly transported to the earth' s surface and are thereby suddenly cooled,
crystallize with glassy
0 1' fine grained crystalline structures. These structures
are, therefore, diagnostic for extrusive
0 1' surface rocks. If th e melt is cooled
slowly, the first formed crys tals can continue first to grow until a stage is reached
in which the entire melt crystallizes. In the model two component system (Fig.291,
p. 189), this is when the eutectic is reached. It may aiso happen that such a
magma may be cooling slowly at depth, and then be rapidly extruded to the

surface and cooled. In both cases inclusions or phenocrysts may occur emb edded
in a fine grained groundmass. This is called a porphyritic struciure (Fig. 295,
p. 192). The word porphyr (greek: purpur) originally meant a red rock which
happened to exhibit this structure. Its meaning has changed in the course of
time from a color to a structural connotation. Porphyritic structures are found
especially in dike rocks, formed by the extrusion of a magma into cold country
rock ; they are found as weil in many extrusive rocks. As we mentioned earlier

(p. 192) the inclusions or phenocrysts can show evidence of dissolution or partial
remelting. An additional kind of structure form s, in which at first relatively small
crystals of one mineral crystallize, and these are included in larger later formed
crystals of another mineral. This is called a poikilitic structure (gr. poikilos,
mottled). In metamorphic rocks, analogous structures are called poikiloblastic.
A special case of this is the ophitic structure (gr . ophis, snake) common to silica -
poor rocks, in which tabular crystals of plagioclase appear in thin sections as
laths lying within large augite crystals. If the space between feldspar laths is
formed of continuous individual mineral grains (of augite or olivine), it is referred
to as intergranular structure. The structure is referred to as intersertal if a fine
grained or glassy groundmass fills in between the laths. Usually one observes
something intermediate between intersertal and ophitic structures, as illustrated
in Fig. 314.
Textures. While structures express the physical and chemical conditions of
crystallization, textures give us insight into the mechanical relations of the melt.
Textures which do not show directional orientation indicate that the melt was
subjected to substantially no movement during and after crystallization. Flow
textures indicate movement (Fig. 315) and in certain cases even permit detailed
analysis of the fluid movement , for example, by measurement of laminar crystals
(sanidine) arranged parallel to the flow direction. These directions, however,

Survey of Igneous Rocks
213
cannot be interpreted to indicate in which of the two opposite directions move-
ment took place.
Other directed textures form under the influence of external forces, which act
after the solidification of the rock. They will be mentioned later when we discuss
rock metamorphism.

Geological Classifications. If we now attempt a classification of igneous rocks
based on our prevailing knowledge, we encounter numerous difficulties. For some-
time the distinct differences in structures have been used generally to denote
the site of crystallization. Rocks formed at great abyssal depths in the earth
are designated as plutonic. Melts solidified between other rocks at intermediate
(hypabyssal) depth form dike rocks , and if poured out onto the surface, effusive
or extrusive rocks. These distinctions are therefore geological ones, and cannot
always be made with certainty. This is particularly so because all gradations must
exist from abyssal to hypabyssal to extrusive rocks. The hypabyssal group
itself is, in fact, a transitional group which is often omitted in classification
schemes. However, this designation has become so mu ch apart of our nomen-
clature that we shall retain it here.
An additional geological distinction, used almost exclusively in Germany,
involves subdivision of extrusive rock into "old " and " young " varieties. This
distinction is confined generally to the Paleozoic. Older Paleozoic basaltic rocks
are called diabases, basalts occuring in the upper Paleozoic (Permian) are still
given the special name, melaphyres. Th ese names should be discontinued. In the
English-speaking countries, gencrally speaking, the term diabase is used .Ior
coarse grained basalts which occur as dike rocks, and are synonymous with
dolerite. The old extrusive rocks have in many places during the course of earth
history undergone changes and are weakly metamorphosed or " auchimetamor-
phic " . It is recommended that in Germany, as elsewhere, the previous terms for
" old " extrusive rocks be confined to these an chimetamorphic rocks. An unaltered

214
Formation of Magmaeie (Igncous) Rocks
Paleozoic basalt, such as occurs in Scandinavia, if not in Germany, should simply
be called a basalt.
Two types of dike rocks are customarily distinguished. One group consists
of rocks which have the same composition as an observed or assumed parent
rock, but which differs from it in its structure. These rocks are called porphyries,
if they contain dominantly K-feldspar, and porphyrites, with plagioclase. The
name of the parent rock is included, giving rise to terms like granite porphyry,
diorite porphyrite, etc. The word porphyry, as indicated earlier (p. 212) is a
structural term. The name porphyril is applied customarily to anchimetamorphic
extrusive rocks. It would be more satisfactory to use the appropriate rock name,
for example, rhyolite. An additional group of dike rocks contains mineral con-
stituents different from the presumed parent rock. If the light mineral fraction
is enriched relatively, the rock is called an aplite. If the dark minerals predominate,
the rock is called a lamprophyre. These rocks are also referred to as diaschistic,
segregated dikes, as opposed to unsegregated aschistic rocks, the first group.
Today the segregation theory, from which this terminology is derived, is no
longer accepted and aplites and lamprophyres appear to be rocks of different origin.
Mineralogical Classification. The further subdivision of rock types can be
carried out, based on mineral content as proposed by JOHANNSEN, NIGGLI, and
TRÖGER. For plutonic rocks the ratios of the light constituents, quartz, feldspars,
and feldspathoids, are used. The feldspathoids (shortened "foids") include
leucite (K[AlSi206]), nepheline (NaaK[AlSi04]4)' as weIl as the rarer minerals
analcite
(Na[AlSi206] · H 20 ), nosean, sodalite, hauynite, and cancrinite. The
formulae for the last four minerals can be easily compared as folIows:
For every 6 moles of nepheline (NaAlSi04) there occurs I Na 2S04 in nosean,
2 NaCl in sodalite, 1 CaS04 in hauynite, and 1 CaCOa in cancrinite. In these
minerals numerous additional substitutions occur. Their exact formulae are
tabulated in the mineral tables appended on p.422 and p.424. All of these
tectosilicates contain less Si02 than the feldspars, and thus cannot occur simul-
taneously in equilibrium with quartz. This was indicated earlier in discussing
the phase diagram for leucite (Fig.296, p. 194). From these considerations it is
possible to represent rock compositions utilizing two contiguous concentration
triangles (Fig. 316). The apex of the upper triangle represents 100% quartz and
its base gives ratios of alkali to anorthite plagioclase feldspar. This also serves as
the base for the second lower triangle, with 100% "foids" represented by its
apex. The resulting diagram permits a quantitation subdivision of rocks according
to their light mineral content. The compositional boundaries of some typical rock
types are indicated in Fig . 316. Corresponding data are compiled in the Appendix
C 1. The dark mineral constituents, including biotite, hornblende, pyroxene,
and olivine are omitted from the diagram. They are included and summarized
in Table 35. In this table the names of alkali rocks are enclosed in frames. The
size of type gives an indication of the abundance of reach rock type. (See also
p.220, Table 41.)
It is necessary to say a little more about nomenclature. Rocks which contain
predominantly light minerals are said to be leucocratic (gr. leucos, white); those
with predominantly dark minerals, melanocratic (gr. melas, black). Sometimes a
color index is also used, which indicates the percentage of dark-eolored minerals
(including olivine) present in the rock. Frequently one distinguishes between
"acid", that is, silica-rich rocks which are usually light colored, and dark-colored
"basic" rocks. In Table 35 individual typical rocks are indicated and their Si02
contents are given following the compilation of analyses by TRÖGER.jln the

The world wide distribution of rock types is not homogeneous. H ARK ER
(1896) and BECKE (1903) made the observation that alkaline rocks occur around
the Atlantic Ooean , and calcalkaline rocks around the Pacific. Later
N IG GLI
subdivided the alkaline rocks into rocks with a preponderence of sodium, which
correspond to B ECKE'S Atlantic suite. Alkaline rocks with predominant potassium,
such as occur in the area of the Mediterranean Sea, especially in central Italy,

Today we usually make distinctions between so-called tholeiitic and olivine-
alkali basalt clans. Y ODER and TILLEY give the following classification, based on
the normative mineral content. (Calculation of mineral norms is explained on
p. 219.)
Tholeiite, supersaturated with Si02 : quartz+hypersthene.
Tholeiite, saturated with Si02 : hypersthene.
Olivine-tholeiite, undersaturated with Si02 : hypersthene+olivine.
Olivine basalt: olivine.
Alkali basalt: olivine +nepheline.
On the basis of modal (see p. 219) mineral composition, the olivine-alkali
basalt types generally contain diopsidic pyroxene (augite) while the tholeiitic
types contain additional pigeonitic and possibly orthopyroxene.
Chemical Classifications. The subdivision of the alkali and calcalkali rocks
into Atlantic; Mediterranean, and Pacific suites is a chemical classification.
Arrangement into such " petrologic provinces" follows from the chemical analyses
of rocks. If one compares rock analyses, it is difficult to make direct comparisons
from weight percentages of the constituent oxides. Therefore, molecular quotients
are calculated from the weight percentages of the analyses. The weight percent-
ages are divided by the molecular weights and multiplied by 1,000. These molecu-
lar quotients or molecular numbers are compiled in various ways so that mutual
chemical relationships can be shown graphically. In Germany the representation
of NIGGLI is generally used , as is the case in the following example. The molecular
numbers for AI20a, FeO +MgO+MnO (including Fe 20a calculated as FeO) ,
CaO+BaO + SrO,
and K 20+Na 20+Li20 are recalculated to
100% . We
obtain the four groups al+Im+c+alk = 100. Si02 and, where appropriate,
Ti02 , P 20S ' etc. numbers are calculated proportionately. Molecular number
Al20a: molecular number Si02=al:si. Finally the proportions of K 20 and MgO
are calculated from molecular numbers:
k=
K20
.
mg=
:MgO
K20+Na20+Li20'
FeO+l\inO+:MgO
As an example of this type of calculation, the granite of Wurmberg from Braun-
lage investigated by H. NIEMANN, can be used (Table 37).
If one has a large number of analyses to compare, we usually utilize diagrams
in which the al, Im, c, alk, k, and mg values are plotted against si-values. As an
example, values calculated from the analyses of the plutonic rocks of Table 35
(excluding syenite) are plotted in Fig. 317. One can see very clearly the decrease
in Im and c and the increase in al and alk, with increasing si. This form of chemical

expression has its limitations, however. We must be cautious about reading too
mueh into the relationships revealed. It is easy to denote variations by ealeulation
whieh do not represent the natural conditions, espeeially sinee too mueh weight
may be given to insignificant variations of loeal origin or even due to errors in

Another method of reeasting chemieal analyses is used primarily in the
United States. Standard or normative minerals are calculated with the help

of molecular numbers. This method usually is called th e CIPW norm, after its
originators, CROSS, IDDINGS, PIRSSON, and WASHINGTON. The normative minerals
are listed in Table 38. The calculation is simple, when Si02 is in excess. Table 39
indicates how the calculations are made. The detailed procedure is described
by A. HOLMES.

For the Wurmberg granite, as Table 40 shows, the agreement between norma-
tive and optically determined feldspars and quartz is quite good. We can notice
at the same time a serious disadvantage of norm calculations, namely that mica
is not taken into consideration in the calculation. Thus the norm is only a repre-
sentation of the analysis, at best expressing that which could have crystallized
from the magma. Instead of this normative mineral content, the modal content
is usuaBy given now , determined by quantitative optical studies. Whenever
possible, modal analyses so determined should be given.
Abundance 01 Igneous Rock Types. Table 41 gives a summary of the distribution
of the most common igneous rocks. According to all estimates, granites, grano-
diorites, and quartz-diorites are most common. These plutonie rocks make up
about 80% of th e volume of th e Earth's upper crust . The extrusive rocks have
not been included in Table 41 because, according to WEDEPOHL, even when we
include the extensive plateau deposits, they collectively make up only 1-2%
of the total volume of the Earth's crust . Among the extrusive rocks, DALY esti-
mated the volume ratios of basalt :andesite :rhyolite at 50 :10:1.

220
Formation of Magmatic (Igneous) Rocks
The predominance of granitic rocks has led to the idea that they originate
in the crust by means of processes which take place in th e zone of metamorphism,
by complete or partial melting of sediments . However, having made this assump-
tion, it is not apparent why so little of its extrusive equivalent, rhyolite, is found
in the crust, and why so much (50 times) basalt occurs relatively.

In order for partial melting of sediments to take place, we must expect a
relatively high content of volatile constituents, especially water and carbon
dioxide. In a later chapter on volatile components it will be shown that granitic
melts, because of their water content, can rarely find their way to the Earth's
surface. It is generally accepted today that basalts do not originate in the Earth's
crust, but from deeper layers, in the mantle (see p. 333).
3. Abundance 01 the Chemical Elements
Summary. Thus far we have considered only a few of th e commonest elements
and a small number of minerals composed of them. We must now take a look at
the occurrence of the other elements in igneous rocks. The determination of the
abundance of the elements (including their isotopes) and their manner of dis-
tribution in the Earth's crust represents the field of geochemistry, in its narowest
sense. In the broader sense, geochemistry involves the entire study of the origin
and destruction and alteration of minerals and rocks.
The elements considered thus far are actually the most abundant constituents
of igneous rocks. They are listed in the first column of Table 42 and constitute
about 99% of the chemical components of rocks.

Abundance of the Chemical Elements
221
The eight elements form a limited number of igneous rock-forming minerals.
From LARSEN'S data on the abundance of minerals in different rock types, and
from the estimated abundance of rock types (Table 41), WEDEPOHL has calcu-
lated the average mineral composition of igneous rocks, as shown in Table 43.

the earth's crust where they have formed mineral deposits . Here they have
become concentrated by processes which we still do not fully understand by and

abundant , but of which the layman is rarely cognizant .
Titanium. Titanium ean serve as an example to illustrate the different ways
in which the elements oeeur in igneous rocks. The most ubiquitous titanium

mineral is ilmenite, FeTiOs, occurring particularly in basic igneous rocks. Some-
times, in a manner similar to magnetite, it is segregated from a magma as an
independent rock. Magnetite itself also frequently contains titanium. Magnetite
is very widespread as an accessory mineral and is lacking only in many acid
granites and glass-rich extrusive rocks. At high temperatures magnetite can take
up considerable amounts of titanium in solid solution, forming mixed crystals
with ulvospinel, Fe2Ti04 • Upon cooling exosolution occurs. Oxidation takes place
simultaneously, precipitating lamellae of ilmenite parallel to {lU} of magnetite
(Fig. 318). The titanium oxide, rutile, occurs in biotites and pyroxenes in the
form of small laths. Exosolution phenomenon are probably involved here also.
They can survive the weathering of these minerals and become incorporated into
sediments. Quartz also occasionally contains rutile inclusions. It is uncertain to
what extent exosolution is involved here. In many cases they are certainly
foreign inclusions.
In acid and weakly basic rocks, especially syenites, the mineral titanite occurs.
This is an inselsilicate with the composition CaTi[0]Si04 • In very basic rocks
titanium occurs in perovskite, CaTiOs ' In nepheline and leucite bearing extrusive
rocks melanite occurs. This is a calcium-iron garnet, CaSFe2(Si04h, which con-
tains up to 25 % Ti02• The titanium probably replaces the iron. In addition to
these high-Ti accessory minerals, titanium is often found substituting in structures
for major constituents in pyroxene, biotite, hornblende, and olivine (see Table 44).
Many augites, contain up to 5 % Ti02 , and are called titanoaugite.
Phosphorus. Another important element is phosphorus. It occurs almost
exclusively in the accessory mineral apatite, Ca5(F, Cl, OH)(P04)s' In igneous
rocks apatite contains F, and in much lesser amounts Cl, especially in basic
rocks. Hydroxy-apatite is confined to sediments. Apatite is the primary natural
source of phosphorus. The phosphorus content of an igneous rock ,
like that of
titanium, increases with decreasing Si02-content (especially in alkali rocks) .
Apatite originates as a magmatic segregation in large amounts in only one locality,
the Chibina Tundra on the Kola Peninsula. Monazite, CeP04 (containing Th
and rare earths) is found ocassionally in granites, and more rarely the mineral
xenotime, YP04 •
Zirconium. Zircon, an inselsilicate, is distributed widely in granites, syenites,
quartz porphyries, and trachytes. It is by far the most important zirconium
mineral.
Sulfur. Sulfur is distributed in all igneous rocks as pyrite, FeS2• Next in
importance is pyrrhotite , FeS, which occurs in basic rocks, particularly those
of the gabbro family. Chalcopyrite, FeCuS2 is not rare. The copper content of
an igneous rock is due to its chalcopyrite content. In addition to the sulfides,
sulfur is sometimes present in the sulfate-bearing silicates, nosean, 6 (Na [AlSi04]) •
Na2S04 , and hauynite, 6 (Na]AlSi04] ) • CaS04 , which occur almost exclusively
in young nepheline- and leucite-bearing extrusive rocks. Hauynite is especially
abundant in the Mühlstein lavas of Niedermendig (Germany). In other rocks,
sulfate ions indicated in analyses occur in fluid inclusions (see p. 224).
4. The Role 01 Volatile Constituents
It was shown earlier that water affects crystallization in Si02 and silicate
systems, especially by lowering the melting temperature. From observations of
volcanoes and their emanations, it has been known for a long time that magmas
contain water and other volatile constituents. The predominant constituent of
volcanic gases is water vapor, making up generally 90 volume percent. CO2 is

224
Formation of Magmatic (Igneous) Rocks
next most abundant, and then N2. H2, H2S, and S02 have been observed also.
It has become clear that the content of these latter gases is dependent on the
temperature of the volcanic gas.
It has been possible to obtain information on the amount of gases released by
degassing of magmas, from figures determined in 1919 in the region of Katmai
volcano in Alaska. There, in the "Valley of 10,000 Smokes", ZIES estimated that
over an area of only 77 km>, the following quantities of gases were being evolved
annually from a magmatic source of rhyolitic composition at shallow depth :
480· 106 tons H20
1.25 . 106 tons Hel
0.2 . 106 tons HF
0.3 . 106 tons H 2S.
In the laboratory gases have been produced by experimental degassing of
rocks. The greater portion of these gases occur in fluid inclusions. GOGUEL re-
ported the following range of values for H20 in minerals from seven granites
(in mm3jg at O°C and 760 torr) :
quartz
feldspar
biotite
10-1,400 H 20
10-6,100 H 20
600-4,300 H 20 .
The water content of the biotite was represented by free H20, and does not
include OH water released by dehydroxylation.
Tbe System Salt-Water. Ever since consideration has been given to volcanic
phenomena, these volatile constituents bave been repeatedly assigned an important
role in mineral formation. However, it was only through tbe development of
physical chemistry that a deeper understanding of their importance has become
possible . By 1920 P. NIGGLI had investigated and clarified extensively their
relationships. However, only in the last 25 years has it become possible to in-
vestigate these processes experimentally. We shall begin the discussion of these
somewhat complex relationships, utilizing a simple example, the system salt-
water. Here we will be considering a simple eutectic system. Such a two-compo-
nent system cannot, of course, substitute for a multicomponent system, but it
can serve as a model in many fundamental respects. The molten salt and water
must exhibit unliInited miscibility. We consider first an isobaric section of a
system in which both components have very similar boiling points. The boiling
curve is the phase boundary between fluid-vapor and is quite analogous to the
solid-fluid boundary in a completely misoible system in the solid state (Fig. 297,
p. 194). There are two vapor pressure curves, of which the one defines the be-
ginning, the other, completion of condensation from the vapor state. The first,
the condensation curve, is analogous to the "liquidus" in solid-liquid systems ;
the second, the boiling curve corresponds to the " solidus". By vapor, we mean
agas that is in equilibrium with a condensed and, therefore, fluid or solid phase.
The visible mixture of condensed water droplets and air, existing between the
two vapor pressure curves, is usually called steam. Strictly speaking this mixture
is saturated steam, and the real gas is superheated steam.
Let us turn now to a generalized salt-water system in which the boiling point
of the salt is about 1,000° higher than that of water. The pressure is established
at one atmosphere. The vapor pressure curve of the mixture rises from the lower
to higher boiling temperature, just as does the melting curve in the solid-liquid
system, albite-anorthite (Fig.297). When the boiling points are so dissimilar,
it is possible for the boiling curve to intersect twice that portion of the melting
curve which rises from the eutectic point to the melting point of the higher melting

component. Such is the case in Fig. 319. Here e -81 -82 -8ms is the solubility
curve of the salt in water, and can just as well be considered a melting curve.
At 81 it is cut by the boiling curve and at higher temperature only vapor and salt
coexist in equilibrium. Only at higher
temperaturc, corresponding to
8 2, does
condensation of water vapor take place
again,
at
salt
concentrations greater
than 82 , Conversely, upon cooling from a
higher temperature to point
82, boiling
occurs. This boiling which takes place
upon cooling is called retrograde boiling .
If we now consider a melt of very low
water content at point x, upon cooling
it takes a path along the melting curve
from em, to 82 and crystals of salt pre-
cipitate. Likewise in a multicomponent
system the non-volatile constituents can
crystallize just as if no water were pre-
sent. With continucd cooling the melt is
enriched in
water,
or more generally
in all volatile constituents. This is very
important in
numerous respects.
The
more water or other volatile constituents
present, the more can they be incorporat-
ed into mineral phases which are form-
ing. In addition the viscosity, which in-
creases upon cooling in dry melts, de-

creases in the presence of volatile constit-

uents. They make the melt more mobile.
If the pressure at the second boiling point is not sufficient to hold the water
in solution, boiling occurs. This retrograde boiling at atmospheric pressure
can be demonstrated easily, if water vapor is introduced into a KN03 melt
and then the melt is cooled, for the system KN03- H 20 corresponds at one
atmosphere pressure to the phase diagram in Fig.319. In silicate systems, for
example, albite-anorthite, retrograde boiling takes place only at substantially
higher pressures.
Supercritical Phenomena. Until now in our salt-water system thc pressurc
has not been considered. We have seen already the PT diagram for the single
component system H 20 (p. 183). It is important also to consider the supercritical
region, which is illustrated in Fig.320. In this three dimensional diagram the
surface separating various states of water is depicted, so that the specific volume
can be ascertained as related to temperature and pressure. The values for pressure
and specific volume (cm3jg) are plotted logarithmetically. On the left, ice occurs
at temperatures below 0°. To the right is the stability field of fluid water, and
then that of the gaseous state. The unshaded area is bound by the two-phase
boundary. On the two-phase boundary two values for specific volume are plotted
for each pair of T and P values, one for water and one for gas saturated vapor.
For example, if we start at low pressure on the 200
0 isotherm and raise the pres-
sure until the isotherm intersects the two phase boundary, at this pressure
(about 30 kgjcm2) the liquid and gaseous phases are in equilibrium. The same is
true at the intersection of the 300
0 isotherm. However, the 400
0 isotherm no
longer cuts the two-phase boundary because it is above the critical point, de-

fined by the critical temperature of 374°C (tkv) and the corresponding critical
pressure of 225 kg/cm2• Above the critical temperature there is no difference be-
tween gas and liquid, and one can refer only to a fluid state. An important question
now is whether H 20 in the supercritical state can transport dissolved substances.
It appears that solubility in the fluid state depends on density, and thus the
logarithm of the solubility, L, is proportional to the log of the total density, e.
If we plot log L against log e we obtain a straight line. The proportionality
constant varies with the substance and for a given substance with the association
number. For example, for Si02 it would be different from Si(OH)4' Si20(OH)6 and
SiO(OH)3 (GLEMSER). Table 45 gives some values for solubilities of some oxides,
sulfates, CaC03 and ZnS at 500°C and 1,000 kg/cm 2 pressure, as reported by
MOREY.

If we cut an isobaric section somewhere through the middle of the diagram,
we obtain a view of a two-component system with eutectic and boiling and
condensation curves, such as we had described initially (p. 225). If the boiling
points of the two components are very different, the boiling curve will cut the
melting curve in two places, and we obtain an isobaric section analogous to
Fig. 319, with first and second boiling points.

Fig.323. Projection of the system albite-water on the P-T plane of albite. (After the in-
vestigation of GORANSON)
We can project the entire system on a plane, for example the P-T plane of
one of the components. Fig. 322 corresponds to the projection of Fig. 321. In
order to represent in this way a system with greatly differing boiling points,
the observations of GORANSON for the system albite-water are plotted in Fig. 323
as indicated by various dotted lines. Solid lines represent the pure systems. The
remaining lines indicate possible projected relationships.
Such a diagram raises the question as to whether the critical curve always
remains above the three-phase boundary, as is the case in systems with approxi-
mately equal vapor pressures, or whether, due to the presence of volatile con-
stituents, especially water, the two curves intersect, as the bottom curve of
Fig. 323 indicates. In alkali silicate- H 20 systems the critical curve is not inter-

sected, but in the system Si02- H 20 it is. Thus we can assurne this to be the case
in numerous silicate -i-Hjf) systems. This means then that between the points
of intersection (analogous to P and Qin Fig. 323), crystallization from the super-
critical state can occur.
Volatile Constituents
and Intrusion 01 lUagmas. We have already noted
(p. 202 and 203) the influence of H 20 on different one- and two-component
systems. In all of these instances, t he pressure imposed on the syste m is equal
to the partial pressure of H 20. An important consequence of these experiments
is that the melting temperatures are lowered due to the water . This has been
established in the case of granites also. A dry granite begins to melt at the earth's
surface at about 960°0. At 15 km depth, corresponding to a pressure of about
4,000 kgjcm2 and an equivalent water vapor pressure, melting begins at 650°0.
Under these conditions it can contain about 9% water in solution. Below 650°0
it is solidified. At 6 km depth, at a pressure of 1,600 kgjcm2, it would be fully
solidified at 700°0 . A granitic melt, rising upward in the earth's crust, would be
solidified at relatively shallow depths and would not succeed in reaching the sur-
face, if it were not heated above 960° from the beginning. Basalts on the other
hand have a very low water content and their crystallization temperatures are
mu ch higher, at about 1,090°0 , and increase only a little with increasing pressure.
By means of these relations, H. G. F . WINKLER has explained the rarity of
graniti c extrusive rocks, t hat is, rhyolites, relative to the great abundance of
their plutonic equivalents, granites. The water content of granitic magmas thus
depends on their having been derived at least for the most part by the meta-
morphism of sediments . We shall say more about this later (see p. 292). Basalts
on the other hand are derived from deeper layers of the earth, originating at high
temperatures in the earth's mantle, rather than the crust (see p. 333).
We want to consider now the relations of H 20 in a silicate magma, completely
encIosed in a magma chamber. We must distinguish first between the water
content of a melt and the partial pressure of water. By par tial pressure we mean
the water vapor pressure which we would measure if we were able to introduce
an appropriate apparatus in various places in the melt. From without, the homo-
geneous pressure is exerted on the magma reservoir from the overlying rock mass.
This is called the rock pressure. Fig. 324 reproduces the conditions in such a
melt at a constant temperature of 1,000°0 as a fun ction of external pressure. The
data were taken by KENNEDY (1955) from the work of GORANSON on albite -water
melts, which behave very mu ch like a granite melt. The curve descending to the
right indicates the water content of the melt whcn the H 20 pressure is equal to
the external pressure. It indicates the maximum water content in the melt at
different prcssures. Such a system cannot remain stable. The H 20 vapor pressure,
when it equals the external pressure, rises very quickly with increasing depth.
Water would diffuse against the pressure gradient, and the H 20 pressure would
become greater than the external pressure, causing the chamber to explode . The
curves descending to t he left indicate the amount of water dissolved in the melt,
when the partial pressure of H 20 ranges from 500-3,500 kgjcm2• They terminate
at the saturation curve. Let us consider a large magma chamber exte nding from
7.2 km to a depth of 10.6 km. The external pressure at 7.2 km is 2,000 kgjcm2•
If the magma at this depth is saturated, it contains 7.5% water. At the bottom
of the magma chamber at 10.6 km depth the external pressure is 3,000 kgjcm 2•
At this pressure the same melt would contain in solution only 3.3% water. The
water migrates, therefore , against the external pressure. It is concentrated in the
upper part of the magma chamber. The water is squeezed out, so to speak, as
would be expected from its large molecular volume.

230
Formation of Magmatte (Igneous) Rocks
Such a magma reservoir would certainly not have the same temperature
throughout. Along its borders and especially at the top it would be cooled down.
The cooler a melt is, the more water it can take up. At constant external pressure,
the water content increases about 0.5 weight percent for each 100°0 decrease in
temperature. Water migrates, therefore, to the cooler areas on the borders of the
chamber. This means, first of all, that the roof and border portions have a lower
crystallization temperature than the core, and secondly, that the volatile con-
stituents are enriched on the outer margins of the chamber. In very large granite
bodies it can frequently be observed that the margins of the body are coarser
grained, in part porphyritic, and richer in mineral-bearing cavities. This is de-
scribed as miarolitic development.

Fig. 324. Equilibrium distribution of water in an albite melt in the earth's gravity field,
(After GORANSON and KENNEDY, 1955)
The concentration of H 20 in those portions of a magma reservoir lying elose
to the earth's surface can lead to eruptions, if the water vapor pressure becomes
greater than the external pressure confining the melt. This would be the case
if more water is present than the melt can dissolve,
01' it could result from a
decrease in water solubility with falling temperature, corresponding to retrograde
boiling (Fig. 319, p. 225). GORANSON has computed that an albite melt, containing
4.2% water, is in equilibrium at 1,100°0 at apressure of 606 kg/cm2, correspond-
ing to a depth of 21/ 4 km external rock pressure. This pressure is sufficient, there-
fore, to hold the water in solution. After cooling to 819°, albite crystals make up
56% of the system and the residual melt contains 9.5% water. The pressure has
climbed now to 3,000 kg/cm2• It would be necessary now to have an overburden

of 13 km of rock to hold the water in the melt. The existing rock pressure is
insufficient, and a volcanic eruption or explosion would take place.
We know from the Krakatau Volcano in th e Dutch East Indies, that during
the eruption in 1883, 18 km 3 of rock were ejected.Thedust cloud reached 27- 30km
in height and the ash falls covered 827,000 km". During the Katmai eruption in
Alaska in 1912, 21 km" of rock were ejected. The ash distribution is mapped in
Fig. 325. We can see that volcanic ash deposits can extend to great distances
from the explosion crater. The outermost contour of Fig. 325 corresponds to an
ash bed of 6 mm thickness. Volcanic ash can be sedimented in small amounts
over the entire earth. It contributes significantly to ocean deposits in regions far

Formation of Magmarie (Igneous) Rocks
removed from land, such as in the Pacific, where rates of sedimentation of de-
tritus from the continents are very slow. Ash deposits consist either of material
from the ejected fluid magma that is exploded into more or less fine angular
fragments, or of fragmented country rock. Glass tuffs form , if droplets of melt
solidify in the air . Glassy fragments, from which gases have been expelled, form
pumice deposits. Often the magma may exist below the liquidus temperature
before eruption and contain crystals which have already precipitated. Eruption of
such material forms crystal tuffs. At the present time allloose or friable volcanic
products are grouped together as tephra. Ash, containing glass and crystals, and
ejected along with hot gases, forms ignimbrites or welded tuffs, in which the hot
and still deformable glass particles fuse upon deposition. Such rocks are often
difficult to distinguish from lavas.
At Katmai, rhyolitic magma was ejected, at Krakatau, dacitic magma.
Basaltic magmas contain initially very small amounts of water at most, but
these small amounts can be concentrated in the roof of a magma chamber and
lead to eruption.
If an eruption occurs the magma can flow out. During the course of eruption
it becomes more and more gas-deficient and more viscous. This is especially true
of magmas enriched in H 20 and Si02 , which when degased are much more
viscous than basaltic magmas. The values for viscosities of some melts in poises
(g . cm-1 • see") at 1,150°C and atmospheric pressure are:
olivine basalt
'" 9 . 102
andesine basalt r-> 8 . 10'
albite
1 . 108•
BURNHAM (1963) investigated the influence of water on the viscosity of a melt
of granitic composition containing 8.8% H 20, between 700° and 900°C at 4,800 to
7,400 bars. He reported the following values, independent of pressure, in poises :
at 900°C 2.8· 10'
800°C 1.3 · 105
700°C 1.3 · 106•
The viscosities at 800-900°C correspond in order of magnitude to the viscosities
of commercial glasses at these temperatures. The water content causes a reduction
of several tens of percent compared to dry melts.
The hot, water-deficient and relatively fluid basalts can give rise to extensive
sheet eruptions flowing from far extending fissures. Basalt sheets cover 750,000km2
in the Parana Basin in Brazil, 650,000 km2 in the Deccan Plateau in India, and
50,000 km2 in the Karroo area of South Africa. Present day production of lavas
is estimated at between 0.3 and 1 km" (1-3 . 109 t) annually. In these estimates
the submarine eruptions, about which we know very little, are not included.
According to the experimental investigations of YODER and TILLEY, their course
of crystallization is the same as that of terrestrial basalts. They form no hydrous
or sodium-enriched minerals. Only at the rapidly cooled surface of a submarine
flow, do we find a hydrous glass, palagonite, as was observed by the author in
1930 in a basalt collected from 2,000 meters in the ocean. Zeolites can occur also
in the palagonite.
Volcanic emanations and their products will be considered later (p. 240).
Differentiation by Volatile Constitucnts. Until now we have considered only
the effects of water. It does not migrate alone, but contains dissolved constituents.
Morey has shown for the system H20-Na20-Si02 , thatfluid H 20 at 4,000°C and

The Role of Volatile Constituents

2,250 kg/cm2 pressure contains 8.1% Na20 and 11.3% Si0 2 • In contrast, the
solubility of alkali aluminum silicates is very much less. We can assurne, however,
as did G. K E NNE DY , that alkali silicates can be transported along with the water
migrating in a magma chamber. This transport can take place only by diffusion
and must, therefore, happen very slowly.

If the alkali silicates during the course of time are concentrated at the top
of the magma cha mber, the melting point of a granitic melt is significantly
decreased, as Fig. 326 shows. This represents
the three-component system
Si0 2- K 20 -AI20 a in the same manner as illustrated in Fig. 302, p. 199, at an

creases. Melts exist which are rich in alkali and volatile constituents, especially
water. Ro cks, which probably were formed from such melts, are called pegmatites.
They will be discussed later (p. 235).
In addition to alkali silicates, other substances can be dissolved in super-
critical water, as we have seen earlier (p.226, Table 45). If thcse solutions are
released during crystallization of the melt , they can penetrate into porous country
rock or rise along faults to the surface and th ereby rcvert from the fluid state to
hot aqueous solutions. We can imagine, therefore, continuous development of
pegmatites and hydrothermal solutions from one magma. This does not infer,
of course, th at all the constituents of the hot, hydroth ermal solutions come from
th e magmatic source. As they penetrate the overlying rocks, water and other
matter is incorporated from the surroundings. Today it is possible to study such
processes, using isotope analysis as a tool. Thus, th e investigations of waters
from hot springs in areas of recent volcanism in North America, based on the
ratios of H! to H2 and of 0 16 to OlS, have made it probable that primary or
juvenile water is present in amount ~ 5 % (the limit of error of the analytical
methods). That is to say, magmas contribute only a very small amount of water
to hot springs.

The question as to how sulfides have been transported has indeed not yet
been satisfactorily solved. The solubility of the sulfides in water is extraordi-
narily low. Values in Table 46 have been calculated by ELLIS from thermodynamic
data (for more detail see KRAUSKOPF, 1961). At a pH of 3, the solubility of Ag2S
and Cu2S is increased by a factor of 100, the other sulfides by 1,000. However,
with the exception of MnS, this is still much too low to account for transport in
such solutions. A temperature increase to 300°C likewise does not produce suffi-
cient solubility. While the solubilities of Ag2S, Cu2S, PbS, and ZnS increase with
temperature, they decrease for FeS and MnS.

One possibility for raising solubility is by the formation of complexes. Thus
BARNES could show that in the system ZnS-H20-NaOH at an ionic strength
of 10.3 molar, and a pH of 8.2, at 25°C and 6 kgfcm2 pressure, 2.7 gfL ZnS is
dissolved as ZnHS;-ions. This is more than ten times the value found by MOREY
(Table 45) for pure water. Similar complex formation was observed also to in-
crease the solubility of sulfides of Hg and Ag. However, in all of these cases the
pH must be more or less strongly alkaline to obtain sufficiently high solubilities.
It is very questionable, whether the necessarily high H 2S partial pressures are
attained naturally. The question as to how the sulfide ores are transported in
aqueous solutions, requires, therefore, still additional experimental eHort.
Summary of Magmatic Mineral Formation. Volatile constituents, especially
water, play a double role in igneous rock genesis. They influence first of all the
intrusion of a magma into the earth's crust and can cause explosive eruptions.
Secondly, mineral deposits can form from them, which are rich in minerals absent
from igneous rocks.
On the basis of previous discussion we shall organize the processes of igneous
rock formation as foliows :
1. Processes in the silicate melt : differentiation, formation of plutonic rocks at
high and of extrusive rocks at low pressures.
2. Processes in residual solutions : Pneumato-hydrothermal mineral formation.
Pegmatites at high pressure , hydrothermal mineral deposits and exhalative
mineral formation at low pressures.
In the classification of mineral deposits a pneumatolytic stage is included
usually between the pegmatitic and hydrothermal stages. The word pneumato-
lytic was coined in 1851 by R. BUNSEN (gr., pneumo, gas ; lyein, dissolve). He
used the term to describe solution and reaction processes in fumaroles on the
earth's surface. Today the term is applied to the action of gases at depth under
supercritical conditions and to the minerals form ed as a result.
These stages are bound together transitionally. If one attempts a elassi-
fication based on depth of the magma source, we can as we approach the earth's
surface distinguish deep plutonic, plutonic, subvolcanic, and volcanic sources .
The pegmatitic and pneumatolytic stages are limited generally to a plutonic source.

Pneumato-hydrothermall\1ineral Formation
235
However, the degassing of subvolcanic and volcanic magmas is fundamentally
different only in that the pressures are lower and the path s shorter. The distan ce
from the magmatic source has been used also in classification, with terminology
such as intramagmatic, perimagmatic, apomagmatic, and telemagmatic being
applicable. Mineral deposits whose affiliation with a magma cannot be proven,
are called cryptomagmatic. In addition the site of formation of a mineral deposit,
rather than the depth of its magmatic sour ce has been described, leading to
abyssal, hypabyssal, epicrustal, subaquatic, aerial, and sub-aerial designations.
Finally the temp erature of formation has been used for classification, utilizing
the terms hypothermal, mesothermal, and epithermal. These five principles of
classification are not equivalent and their coordinated usage must be established
from case to case, when knowledge permits.
5. Pneumato-hydrothermal Mineral Formation
Pegmatites. We shall adopt the classification based on depth of originating
solutions and begin with pegmatitic mineral deposits. These are precipitated from
silicate-rich aqueous solutions at high temperatures and pressures. The most
magmatic-like memb ers of this mineral group include feldspar, quartz, and mica.
Feldspar and mica decrease in abundance with decreasing temperature, which
corresponds in general to an increase in distance from th e magmatic source.
Quartz on the other hand increases in amount until it may become the main
mineral in hydrothermal veins, into which the pegmatite may grade at lower
temperatures. The temperature of formation of pegmatites may be accepted as
the temperature span lying between 350
0 C and the higher crystallization tempera-
t ure of the magma.
Pegmatites (gr. pegma, framework) fill fissures which are opened either in
the magmatic parent rock itself, or in the neighboring country rock. Such fissure
fillings are generally called veins. Frequently pegmatites are characterized by
very large crystals. Mica and feldspar crystals often occur with diameters of
1 meter, and beryl crystals several meters in length have been observed. The
development of giant crystals indicates direct crystallization from a supercritical
state because, in supercritical fluids, ions have the mobility approaching that of a
gas, due to the high temperature, and on the other hand the spatial packing which
approaches the density of a liquid. These conditions prevail , as we have seen
(p. 227), within only a limited part of the p-v-t system.
In addition to the elements that are abundant in magmas, in different pegma-
tites the elements lithium, beryllium, boron, zirconium, hafnium, molybdenum,
tantalum, thorium, uranium, and the rare earths are enriched often relative to
granites. Fluorine, tin, tungsten, copper and gold occur as weIl in pegmatites as
in pneumatolytic and hydrothermal deposits. We cannot consider here in full
the mineral associations which occur in pegmatites, only a few specific types
will be singled out.
Feldspar pegmatites are probably the most widespread.
The feldspar is
predominantly K-feldspar, less ofte n albite, and occurs in association with much
quartz. These pegmatites, in a fresh state or altered to kaolinite, serve as raw
materials for the ceramic industry. If mica is present in abundance, it is usually
muscovite or phlogopite, which are in demand by the electroindustries as con-
denser materials. Biotite pegmatites are rare. The gern stone beryl, as the blue
or blue-green variety called aquamarine, as weIl as topaz and tourmaline, usually
occur in assooiation with feldspar and quartz.

236
Formation of Magmatic (Igneous) Rocks
Zircon-, titanite-, and phosphate pegmatites are much rarer and serve as
a source of supply for mineral collectors. Many unusual minerals have been noted
in them. They occur usually in association with syenites. Noteworthy rare min-
erals which they contain include monazite, CeP04 , which contains ThSi04 as
weIl as rare earths in solid solution, euxenite, a rare earth niobate, and tantalite,
an iron tantalate-niobate.
Cassiterite-wolframite pegmatites represent a transition into pneumatolytic
veins . Cassiterite and wolframite are the most important ores of tin and tungsten.
Tungsten is a very important alloying constituent of steel, and is used also as
filaments for incandescent lights. The hard metal widia is tungsten carbide. In
the Middle Ages tungsten was much less esteemed. The superstitious miners
believed that it devoured the valuable tin ore. This was the origin of the German
name for tungsten, wolfram. These pegmatites carry the lithium micas lepidolite
and zinnwaldite, from which the element lithium is obtained.
In addition to many eassiterite-wolframite veins, the molybdenite veins are
also included under pneumatolytic deposits. In addition to molybdenite, MoS2 ,
these usually carry quartz and occasionally bismuth ores. Ninety-three percent
of the world 's production of steel-alloying molybdenum is produced from the
pneumatolytic dikes of the Climax mine in Colorado, U.S.A.
Hydrothermal Mineral Deposits, Ore Veins. Mineral deposits derived from
hydrothermal solutions can occur in different forms . Such hot solutions can rise
into fissures and form deposits which are called veins . They can impregnate
fissures in the country rock, reacting with it, and replacing it. Such mineral
deposits, in which the ore formation takes place subsequent to formation of the
country rock are called epigenetic. Mineral deposits in which the ore deposition
takes place simultaneously with the rest of the rock constituents are called
syngenetic. Sedimentary iron ore deposits (p. 274), are examples of the latter.
In the following paragraphs we shall consider primarily the vein deposits.
Gold-tourmaline-quartz and tourmaline-oopper-quartz veins form the connecting
link between pneumatolytic and hydrothermal deposits. These are historically
the real mineral deposits of the mining profession. Only in recent times have
pegmatites been exploited for their mineral content. In hydrothermal veins
gold, silver, copper, lead and tin are found. These were the real metals, as impor-
tant in earlier times as they are .today. The minerals from which they were won,
especially the sulfides, were called ores, or in German Erz, a name of distinction.
Even today among some miners this term is not considered suitable for the iron
minerals. These ore veins have been of great importance to the history of miner-
alogy and geology. Freiberg in Saxony, where these vein deposits were exhaustively
studied long ago, was one of the cradles of this science, especially since the time
of ABRAHAM GOTTLOB WERNER (1749-1817). Here systematic and descriptive
mineralogy was developed, which is fundamental to modern mineralogy, and was
necessary and useful at that time. It is interesting that in Freiburg the beginnings
of genetics found a patron in BREITHAUPT. His paragenesis of minerals was in the
year 1849 a great achievement, because here the whole mineral assemblage, not
the individual mineral, was emphasized. The careful description of the miner-
alization sequence in a vein is an important basis for interpreting their origin. In
the vein represented in Fig . 327 a fissure is filled from both walls. Quartz, sphal-
erite and arsenopyrite crystallized first, followed by the other minerals as the
quartz continued to grow.
An astonishing amount has been written about vein mineral assemblages,
and there has been mueh speculation, but little has been contributed toward
adequate understanding through quantitative experimental and theoretical in-

vestigations. Consequently it is necessary to propose a purely descriptive classi-
fication based on mineral content. Following SCHNEIDERUÖUN, we distinguish
the following mineral assemblages, which are designated with th e old expression
"formation" :

In I and II gold, silver, and copper occur in the native state. In the remainder,
until group VI , sulfides predominate. The mineral assemblages of the different
formations are summarized in Table 47. Plutonic ore deposits of group I type
occur in Germany in the Fichtelgebirge and in Austria in the Hohen Tauern. The
latter was very important during the Middle Ages. To the sub-volcanic deposits
of type I belong the gold ores of Siebenbürgen. As type II deposits we should
mention the immense pyrite deposits in southern Spain and Portugal (Huelva)
and smaller occurrences in the Rh einish Schiefergebirge, especially around the
Siegerland and at Kupferberg in Schlesien. To group III belong the veins at
Freiberg in Saxony, smaller occurances in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) , in
the Rheinish Schiefergebirge on the lower Lahn, and the long-famous occurances
in the Harz at Clausthal, Lauterberg and in the Ostharz. Examples of formation IV
worthy of noting are the silver occurrences at Kongsberg in Sweden , and the veins
at St. Andreasberg in the Harz, at Wittichen in the Schwarzwald (Black Forest) ,
and at Schneeberg and St. Joachimstal in the Erzgebirge. Group V deposits are
especiallyimportant in Bolivia (Potosi) and group VI type deposits are represented
by the large mercury ore deposits of Idria (Carniola) and Almaden (Spain) and the
smaller ones of Landsberg at Obermoschel in the Pfalz. As group VII represent-

atives, the siderite veins of the Siegerland and smaller hematite veins in the
Schwarzwald and Thüringer Wald are noteworthy. Finally, among the examples
of the ore barren formations, the fluorspar veins of th e Harz, the Thüringer Wald ,
Vogtland, and in the Oberpfalz are important, especially for the production of
hydrofluoric acid. Barite veins are mined in the Harz and Bad Lauterberg, on the
Werra at Albungen, in the Thüringer Wald, on the Dill, and in the Schwarzwald
and Spessart. Barite is used in the manufacture of white paint, for the weighting
of textiles and paper, and as materials for protection against radiation. Inter-
mediate between the ore barren and ore bearing veins there are transitional types
of veins. The types of ore, if any, which precipitate, evidently depend consider-
ably on the conditions of crystallization.
Mineralization of hydrothermal veins takes place generally at depth, although
they grade sometimes into surficial hot spring deposits. Formerly distinctions
were made between juvenile springs and vadose springs. The former were derived
from magmatic waters, the latter from surface waters which , after circulating
within the crust, rise to the surface again. A lively controversy took place, espe-
cially in the 1880's as to whether ore deposits derive their mineral content from
magmas or from the leaching of the rock by lateral secretion. The controversy
ended with such a complete defeat of the lateral secretionists , that today the
influence of the country rock is almost completely ignored, certainly without
justification. In this situation also, several roads probably " lead to Rome" , and
many minerals, especially the gangue minerals (oth er than ore minerals) may be
derived from constituents in the country rock. Thus in the case of alpine mineral
veins, the influence of the country rock has been demonstrated. On the other
hand, the upwelling gases and solutions of magmatic origin affect the country
rock. Deposits constituting valuable ores can be precipitated in the pores of the
country rock, giving rise to mineralization in so-called impregnation ore deposits.
Some of the greatest copper deposits, such as those at Bingham (U.S.A.), were
formed in this way. Also by reaction between the country rock and gases and
solutions rising along a fissure, new mineral formation can occur by partial or
complete replacement of the original rock, giving rise to replacement deposits,
This replacement of country rock is associated with the later stages of rock-
forming processes, in the region of metamorphism.
Exhalative Mineral Formation. Exhalative mineral deposits, forming as subli-
mation products from volcanoes, represent the last stage of the magmatic sequence,
grading gradationally into hydrothermal mineralization. A characteristic suite of
minerals form s from the emitted gases upon cooling and by reaction with the atmos-
phere. Some of the minerals, represented by their chemical formulae are :
NaCI, KCI, NH4CI, CaCI2 , PbCI2 , 2KCI · PbCI 2 , MnCI2 , FeCI2 , NaF, MgF2 ,
FesN2 , S, SexSy , AsS, As2Sa, PbS, CuS, HgS, ZnS, FeS, NiS, FeS2 , MgO, PbO,
CuO, Fe20 a and B(OH)a'
AIEo, in the vicinity of extinct volcanoes, hot springs and gaseous emanations
occur. These are listed below in order of decreasing associated temperature:
Hot fumaroles with H20, HCI, S02' CO2, H2, N2.
Solfataras with H2S.
Steam springs, with only H20.
Moffettas with CO2and H20 .
Geysers.
Thermal springs, medicinal springs, mineral springs and sulfur springs with H2S.
There is a very extensive literature concerning these post-volcanic phenomena.
This is especially true of the thermal springs, because of their medicinal use.
An example is the description according to RITTl\IANN of the solfataras in the

region of Lardarello in Tuscany. Here over an area of about 200 km-, from more
than a hundred bored wells, 26 · 106 t of steam with temperatures up to 250°C,
and pressures to 25 kgjcmZ, are produced annually. This amounts to about
2 . 109 kilowatts of energy. The average composition of the steam is :

The high boron content is geochemically important. Earlier boron was produced
from this source.
Vesicles, or bubbles formed by expanding gases, form within volcanic rocks
themselves. These are often mineralized, for example, with calcite, the fibrous
variety of quartz called chalcedony, or with zeolites. These zeolites are hydrous
tectosilicates with porous structures in which the water is so loosely held that it
can be driven off easily upon heating with essentially no change in the silicate
structure. The structure will rehydrate upon further exposure to an atmosphere
saturated in water vapor. The zeolitic water can be replaeed also by other gases
such as HzS, CSz and CC14 • Some typical zeolites are ehabasite (Ca, Naz, K z)

We ean obtain information about the temperature of formation of these
cavity fillings from agates which they frequently contain. Agate consists of
colored, usually fibrous or finely crystalline quartz with some opal, and frequently
eontains larger quartz crystals within it. They oeeur in the vesicles of basaltic
roeks such as the so-called melaphyres of Idar-Oberstein and in south Brazil
and Uruguay. A very eommon type, Festungsagate, exhibits concentric banding
(Fig. 328). From this NACKEN deduced that the silica is homogeneously deposited
concentrically above the critical temperature of water, and thus from the fluid
phase. This type of agate, therefore, should have been formed somewhat above
16

242
Formation of Magmatic (Igneous) Rocks
375°C, since the critical temperature of water is insignificantly increased by the
small addition of silica. Since the quartz enclosed within the agate is the low
temperature variety, the agate formation must have taken place Iikewise below
575°C. Another type, Uruguay agate (Fig.329), contains in addition to the
Fig. 329. Uruguay agate
concentric banding around the border, planar layers within. This indicates that
the latter had deposited from aqueous solution under the influence of gravity,
and that during the formation of the agate, the temperature had decreased
below 375°C.
Banding in agates is usually explained in terms of rhythmic deposition from
solutions diffusing through the silicious
mass, analogous to the formation of
Liesegang rings. However, many observations indicate that the banding can
just as weIl indicate rhythmic periodie degassing.

VII. Weathering and Soil Mineral Formation
1. Mechanical Weathering
The petrogenetic processes which produce new mineral assemblages, either
by alteration of previously formed rocks, or by recombination of alteration
products, are quite different from those which produce igneous rocks. Those
alteration processes which take place at the surface of the earth, at the earth-
atmosphere interface, are called weathering processes.
Weathering products
formed in situ without transport form soils; following transport they form sedi-
ments. Alteration of previously formed rocks which takes place at depth or at
the surface as a result of magmatic influence is considered apart of the meta-
morphic process.
Weathering processes are usually classified as mechanical or chemical in
nature. Mechanical destruction of rocks is accomplished mainly by three processes,
insolation (thermal weathering), frost wedging , and salt expansion.
Thermal Weathering. Insolation occurs when a rock at the surface is repeatedly
heated and cooled. The exposed rock surface expands upon heating to a greater
extent than its interior and upon cooling contracts again. As a result of the stresses
which develop, the outer rock surface is broken up partly into granular particles
and partly into large and small shards. The extent to which these two kinds of
products are produced depends on the characteristics of the rock and on the
severity of the weathering action.
For crystals of most minerals, exact data is available on the magnitude of
expansion due to heating ; on the other hand only old, probably less reliable
data are available for rocks. The pressures which result from expansion can be
calculated from the coefficients of expansion and compressibility. For quartz,
a 40° temperature increase produces apressure of 545 kg/cm2• For rocks un-
fortunately values of the two coefficients have not been determined for com-
parable specimens so that calculations have no significance. Completely con-
clusive
experimental
investigations
of
this
type
of weathering
are
still
lacking.
Frost Wedging. Frost action is somewhat better known. It depends on the
fact that water is an extraordinarily unusual substance which expands upon
changing from the fluid to the solid state, that is, upon freezing. Thus a vessel
which encloses water can burst upon freezing. The pressure which develops upon
freezing can be obtained directly from the pressure-temperature diagram for the
single component system H 20 and the melting curve of ice (Fig. 286, p. 183, 184).
The pressure can attain a value up to 2,200 kg/cm2 at -22°C. At higher pressures
or lower temperatures, we enter the stability field of a different ice modification,
which has a lower specific volume than water. Thus 2,200 kg/cm 2 is the maximum
pressure at which ice wedging can generally occur. In order for frost action to be
effective, it is also necessary that the pores containing the water be so con-
structed that the crystallizing ice is restricted and is not free to crystallize un-
hindered. Thus, entrances to the pores must be constricted. In addition the pore
volume must be more than 90% filled, because the specific volume of water is
16·

244
Weathering and Soil Mineral Formation
90% that of ice. The influence of the rate of cooling, which is frequently mentioned,
could depend on initial cooling of the pore constrictions, resulting first in sealing
off the pore from the remaining fluid. With a rapid drop in temperature these
outer openings of the pores would be cooled first, forming ice crystals, which
could serve as nuclei for the supercooled water within the pore . Even in cylin-
drical pores ice action can take place if a plug whose adherence to the pore
walls is stronger than the wall itself develops from the surface inward.
Salt Expansion. Similar conditions characterize two of the three different
processes which collectively are implied by the term salt expansion. One kind
of salt expansion is based on the fact that a supersaturated solution has a volume
that is less than the combined volumes of a saturated solution in equilibrium
with precipitated crystals. Upon crystallization, a pore pressure develops if
crystals, growing inward, block the entrances to the pores. In the case of alum
solutions, it is possible to calculate, taking into account the compressibility of
water, that apressure of 130 kgjcm2 would develop.
Another kind of salt expansion is related to the ability of many anhydrous
salts to take up structural water. As a result of hydration, the change CaS04~
CaS04· 2H20 results in a calculated pressure increase of about 1,100 kgjcm2,
the change NaS04~NaS04' 10H20 about 250 kgjcm2, and Na2C03~Na2C03'
10H20 about 300 kgjcm2. A pore pressure can only develop under conditions such
that permeability permits access of water to the salt, but at the same time pre-
vents migration of the salt crystals, as, for example, by access through layers of
very fine porosity.
A third kind of salt expansion results from the pressure exerted on its surround-
ings by a growing crystal. The maximum pressure developed is in this case related
to supersaturation. A crystal possesses a greater solubility under pressure. The
greater the supersaturation, the greater the pressure with which the crystal can
be in equilibrium. The folJowing formula applies :
p= R ·T
In !2 .
v
Cs
Pis the excess pressure in atmospheres, R the gas constant (0.082031 atm.jdegree),
T the absolute temperature, v the mole volume of the crystalline substance,
Os the saturation concentration without influence of pressure (that is, the
equilibrium concentration between crystal and solution), 0 the concentration at
which the solution and crystal are in equilibrium at pressure P. From a 175 percent
supersaturated alum solution, alum octahedra develop a 40 kgjcm2growth pressure
against glass. A crystal can only exert pressure if the surface tensions between
crystal, solid neighbor, and crystallizing solution are such that the solution can
penetrate between the crystal and its surroundings. Thus, alum cubes (as con-
trasted with octahedra) develop no growth pressure with respect to glass or mica
plates substituted for glass. The pressure exerted by growing crystals, however,
has
often been greatly exaggerated. For example, it is frequently implied
erroneously that rock fissures containing hydrothermal mineral veins have been
formed as a result of growth pressure.
All three types of salt expansion are manifest by cooling. The effect of super-
saturation is assisted, in addition by removal of water, therefore, by aridity;hydra-
tion expansion is assisted by alternating aridity and humidity. Since increases in
moisture occur frequently even in arid regions as a result of fog, salt expansion
is considered as an important weathering agent in arid regions. Frost weathering,
on the other hand, is related to frequent alternations of freezing and thawing.
The greater the number of cycles, the more intensive the frost action. Insolation

has frequently been described as an important weathering agent in desert regions,
but is certainly not confined there.
2. Chemical Weathering
Solution. Mechanical weathering greatly assists chemical weathering, because
it results in rock disintegration and very substantially aids chemical attack.
When mechanical weathering is hindered, for example, by polishing a rock
surface, chemical weathering proceeds very slowly. Thus in Scandinavia, where
much of the terrane was smoothly polished by Pleistocene glaciers , chemical
weathering has been exceedingly slow since the retreat of the ice, even though
the surface has become populated with moss and moorland.
In nature only a few rocks and minerals are subject to the simplest form of
chemical attack, solution in water. NaCI, KCI, and other easily soluble salts can
exist for substantial times only in very arid regions. In humid regions the simple
solution of only gypsum and anhydrite can be observed.
The process of carbonate dissolution is quite complex. Carbon dioxide dissolved
in water plays the crucial role, as we shall see later when we discuss the origin
of carbonate rocks . It is sufficient here to point out that the solubility of CaC03
rises strongly with the CO2 content of water. Since the solubility of CO2in water
decreases with increasing temperature, the solubility of CaC0 3 is likewise reduced.
Silicate Wcathering. The central problem of weathering is the weathering of
silicates, since these make up more than three-fourths of the earth's crust. The
crust is 66 weight percent feldspar (22% K-feldspar and 42% plagioclase ; see
Table 43, p.221). Thus we can consider the breakdown of feldspar as a model
for silicate weathering. It has been known for a long time that the alkalis potas-
sium and sodium, in feldspar, go into solution very easily. This can be dernon-
strated very easily by putting some powdered K-feldspar in water. If an appro-
priate indicator, such as bromthymol blue is added, in a short time the solution
shows an alkaline reaction. The behavior of aluminium and silicon during weather-
ing has been much less clear until recently. For a long time two differing views
were held.
The older view advocated breakdown of feldspars by hydrolysis,
as a result of which colloidal silicic acid and aluminum hydroxide were formed.
Later these could react, leading to the formation of aluminium silicates. After
the lattice structure of crystals was demonstrated with the help of X-rays, a
second hypothesis was suggested. According to this, after the removal of alkalis
and apart of the Si02, the feldspar structure collapses into the structure of
kaolinite (AI2[(OH)4Si20s])' More recent experimental studies have shown, how-
ever, that both views are incorrect, and that the feldspar goes into ionic solution.
Therefore the silica and alumina are, at least at first, removed in true solution.
Thus, under normal conditions the feldspar is gradually but completely dissolved
and its constituents remain at first in solution. As a result of this dissolution a
very thin rind forms on the feldspar which consists essentially of Al203 and
Si02, always in the ratio of more than 5 Si02 to 1Al203 . The dissolution of the
core takes place through this layer, and simultaneously the layer is broken
down, so that its thickness does not increase during the destruction of the feldspar.
The thickness of the layer was determined to be about 0.00003 mm. Experiments
have shown that leucite, another framework silicate, weathers in the same manner.
In the case of muscovite, the rate of dissolution of different components is
so different, that residual skeletal layers can be produced. As a characteristic of
the layer structure, the diffusion rate of the K ions is relatively much greater
than in feldspar. For the inselsilicate olivine, the dissolution rates of all the

246
Weathering and Soil Mineral Formation
components are approximately the same, so that it is dissolved in water some-
what like NaOl. It must be emphasized that this experimentally established
behavior of silicates applies only to very dilute aqueous solutions at temperatures
between 20° and 40°0 and in open systems. Reactions involving concentrated
salt solutions and completely or approximately closed systems, as weIl as higher
temperatures, can lead to the formation of kaolinite pseudomorphs after feldspar.
The mechanism of pseudomorph formation will be commented on later (p. 309).
3. The Behavior 01 Si, Al, and Fe in Soils
What happens now to those ions which have gone into solution 1 Different
ions behave in different ways . We shall first consider their fate immediately after
weathering, because primarily at this stage they play an important role in the
soll.

Alkali ions are the most stable in solution, the alkali ne earths somewhat less
so. These ions are transported esscntially complctcly away in solution. Alkali
chlorides and sulfates may remain in the soll or migrate in it in arid regions, as do
the calcium salts, gypsum, OaS04 • 2H 20
and calcite, OaOOa' Silicon, aluminum,
and iron on the other hand precipitatc
out again for the most part, usually
right in the soll. During weathcring, new
minerals form from these components
by processes which are very important
in soll formation.
Colloids. These weathering products
are mostly very fine-grained. They are
colloids and thus their study is an impor-
tant aspect of that branch of physical
chemistry called colloid chemistry. 001-
loids constitute a transitional size grade
between coarse grained sediment and
matter of ionic and molecular dimensions
(Fig. 330), that is to say, they comprise
particles of 10-5 to 10-7 cm diameter.
Oolloidal particles can be solid, liquid
or gaseous. The solid colloids, as far as
inorganic
origins
are
concerned, may
be crystalline or amorphous. Thus the
colloidal state
has today only a size

connotation. This needs to be emphasized, because it was believed early in th e study
of colloids that all of them were amorphous, as in glue (gr., kollos) from which
the name was derived. Even today the terms colloidal and amorphous are inter-
changed in the mineralogical literature, lcading to mueh confusion. As long ago
as 1917 SCHERRER showed by X-ray studies that the particles in colloidal gold
sols are crystalline. Likewise in mineralogy we shall be dealing mostly with solid
crys talline colloids.
One of the few exccptions occurs in the system Si0 2- R 20 . During weathering,
silica occurs first as a true silicic acid. When the solubility is exceeded, thi s
silicic acid changes to a sol, a colloidal suspension. In Fig. 331 solubilities in the
systems silica gel-water and aluminum hydroxide-water are given in relation to
the hydrogen ion concentration expressed as pR. pR is the exponent of the
reciprocal of the hydrogen ion concentration. In pure water the ion product
calculated in gram ions per liter is:
If in solution the two ions are present in equal amounts, the R + ion concen-
tration is 10-7, the pR is 7. If an excess of R +ions is present, the solution is acid
and the pR less than 7. For cxample, if [R+]= 10-3 and [OR-] = 10-11, the
pR is 3. On the other hand, pR is greater than 7 in alkaline solutions. If [R+]=
10-12 and [OH -] = 10- 2, the pH is 12. It is to be noted th at since the pH values
are exponents, a unit change in pR, say from 3 to 4, represents a ten-fold change
in hydrogen ion concentration.
A saturated solution of silica may become charged with excess silica if water
is lost from the system, 01' as a result of a decrease in pR. The excess Si0 2 no
longer remains as ions in solution, but as submicroscopic particles of hydrous
Si0 2 • Colloidal sols which contain such swollen hydrated particles are called
hydrosols, 0 1' more generally lyophilic sols (gr. , attracted to water 0 1' solutions).
The solubility data givcn in Fig. 331 refer to the solubility of this sort of gela-
tinous hydrous silica. The solubility of quartz is only about 10 percent th at of
this form of Si0 2 •
In contrast to thc hydrophilie silica sols, are the hydroph obie 01' lyoph obic
sols, which consist of essentially crys talline particles. In the systems AI20 3-H 20
and Fe203-H20, sols intermediate in character are cncountered. In these cases
sols 0 1' gels form which X-ray examination may show to be either crystalline 0 1'
amorphous.
Hydrophobie sols are significantly less stable in solution than hydrophilie
ones. They can be made to settle out 01' coagulate by the addition of ions to the
suspension. Sol particles are elcctrically charged and, since the charge on each
particle is the same, thcy tend to repel one another and stay suspended. The
added ions neutralize these charges, permitting individual particles to come
together into floccs. The process is called flocculation. The product is called a
coagel. H ydrophilie sols also transform from a state of fine particle distribution
in a fluid to one of greater aggregation, into what is called a gel. In this case,
however, the influence of added ions is not as great as with hydrophobie sols.
The tendency to flocculate depends in this case on th e degree of hydration. That ,
is, the less hydrated th e particles, the more nearly th ey approach the character
of hydrophobie particles. In the system SiOc ·H20, the swelling due to hydration
is at a minimum in weakly alkaline solutions. Such a Si0 2 sol can be flocculated
if the salt concentration exceeds 10 millimolesfliter [equivalent to 0.164 g Ca(N03)2
per liter].

248
Weathering and Soil Mineral Formation
The Behavior 01 Silicon. In soils dissolved silica can be abstracted again from
solution in several ways. Certain plants, for example, diatoms, grasses, and
equiseta (scouring rushes) can extract silica from solution. Silica can also be
precipitated by evaporation or by acidifying an alkaline solution (pH> 8.5),
the latter by means of carbonic acid, which originates from the decomposition
of organic substances. Alkali silicate solutions are destroyed by carbonic acid,
with the formation of a hydrous Si02 or gel. From this, more or less well-
ordered low cristobalite first crystallizes and later fibrous (chalcedony) or granu-
lar quartz. The initial amorphous Si02. H20 particles in the gel are less stable
than cristobalite, and this less than quartz. A substance consisting of amphorous
Si02 or this type of cristobalite is caIled opal. That variety caIled precious opal,
which is prized as a gem stone, owes its desirable play of colors to its unique
microscopic structure. It is composed of tiny globules of Si02 arranged in a
close-packed array. The diameter of the globules varies in different opals, but
lies in the range of the wave lengths of visible light. Therefore, light interference
occurs between submicroscopic layers in a manner which can be predicted by the
Bragg equation (p. 149). Crystallization of Si02 gels also results in the formation
of mammillary or reniform structures. Many other minerals, in particular hydrox-
ides, form similar structures. It must be stressed, however, that it is not valid
to draw the conclusion from such structures that pervious coIloidal phenomena
were involved. For example, calcium carbonate incrustations often exhibit very
similar structures, even though they were most certainly deposited from true
solution.
Extensive deposition of Si02 is noted in desert regions where water, rising
in the soil by capillarity, deposits siliceous crusts at the surface or results in
silicification between sand grains in sub-surficial deposits.
Dissolved silica can react also with other minerals, such as calcium carbonate,
depositing quartz. Silicification can take place which can be similar to the effect
of metamorphic processes (see p. 306).
The Behavior 01 Aluminum. Behavior in the system AI203-H20 (Fig.331)
is significantly different. Aluminum remains dissolved in acid (pH < 4) as weIl
as in alkaline solutions (pH > 9; under certain conditions > 10). It precipitates
out as aluminum hydroxide near neutrality. This precipitation can be caused
by evaporation, or when an alkaline solution is acidified, and when an acid
solution is made alkaline. Again carbonic acid is important, although other acids
probably are occasionaIly active. An acid solution can become alkaline or neutral
by loss of its acid constituent (in the case of carbonic acid by heating) or by the
effect of neutralizing reactions, such as reaction with calcium carbonate. In this
way rather pure deposits of technically important aluminum ores have formed.
These are called bauxites after the region of Les Beaux in South France where
they were first found.
Formation 01 Aluminum Silicates. Silica and aluminum hydroxides do not
only precipitate from solution as separate phases. They combine to form com-
pounds, aluminum silicates, whose structures we have considered earlier (p. 73).
Examples are kaolinite [AI2(OH)4Si20s1, and halloysite [AI2(OH)4Si20s] ' 2H20.
Another is montmorillonite,
[AI2(OH)2Si401O] ' n H20 which occurs in greater
amounts in association with altered volcanic tuffs. Rocks composed primarily
of montmorillonite are called bentonites; those of kaolinite, kaolins. Mica like
minerals, similar to muscovite [KAI2(OH, F)2AISi301O]' perhaps form also at
earth surface temperatures. How these reactions take place is not known in
detail. Laboratory syntheses have been carried out at temperatures above 100°C
from silica and aluminum hydroxide gels. Halloysite has not been synthesized.

The Behavior of Si, Al, and Fe in Soils
249
It is very likely that the natural synthesis of crystalline minerals in soils takes
place directly from very dilute true solutions. This would require in any case a
much lesser expenditure of energy, than if the starting material existed already
in the colloidal statc. Based on our knowledge of crystal growth, it is extremely
unlikely that colloidal particles can combine directly to form a crystalline struc-
ture. The formation of aluminium silicates depends, of course, on their individual
solubilities but also on the solubilities of their components. Where relatively mu ch
Al and little Si occur in solution, kaolinitic silicates (A120 a:Si0 2 = 1 :2) will form.
This condition would prevail in soils with pR values < 4, in conformity with
Fig. 331. Under alk aline conditions, where the pH > 8.5, much more Si is in
solution, and conditions would be more fav orable for montmorillonitic silicates
(A120a:Si02 = 1:3 to 1:4). These relationships have been confirmed independently
by the hydrothermal synthescs of NOLL and by appropriate studies of soils.
The ultimate behavior of the two elements silicon and aluminium will vary
depending on reaction conditions and on climatic and local conditions.
The Behavior of Iron. The iron ion is different from aluminum in that it
can occur in two oxidation states, as F e2+ and F ea+. Later, when we deal with
sedimentary iron ores (p. 273), we will discuss the solubility of iron as it relates
to the oxygen content of the solution, to its redox potential. It is sufficient to
establish here that in the presence of oxygen iron is practically insoluble. It can
be transported only in colloidal form as a ferric hydroxide sol.
In the absence of oxygen, iron is stable and soluble as a divalent ion in equi-
librium with carbonic acid, mu ch like the calcium ion (see Fig. 350, p. 273). Also
like Ca, it precipitates out, forming ferrous carbonate (FeCOa) upon loss of CO2 •
F errous iron is ofte n tran sported in conjunction with humic acids. Their presence,
however, probably only indicates that the redox potential is low and that trans-
port as the carbonate is possible. As soon as oxygen centers the system, the
hydroxide, F eOOH, precipitates out.
In the case of iron hydroxides, a particular property of hydrophobic sols is
important . Before flocculation occurs they may be protected by a coating of a
hydrophilic sol. Colloids which provide such protective action are called protective
colloids. An error which appears over and over in the mineralogical literature
needs to be mentioned. Protective colloids are only effective against flocculation,
not against dissolution, since solution would be possible through the hydro-
philic coating or hull. A large amount of iron may be transported as such protected
colloids and be distributed widely in the sea before the protective hull is destroyed
or rendered ineffective. When this happens, the iron hydroxide flocculates.
We distinguish between two iron hydroxide minerals, goethite or IX-FeOOH,
which is the most common, and lepidochrosite or y-FeOOH. The latter has a
platy morphology, the former usually a fibrous one. The name goethite was used
originally for the y-FeOOH , but now for IX-FeOOH. Upon dehydroxylation, iron
hydroxides transform into Fe20a, either an IX-form called hematite, or a y-form
called maghemite. Maghemite forms more often, however , as a result of the oxi-
dation of Fea04 , magnetite. Under certain conditions the hydroxides can change
direc tly to magnetite.
Soil Profiles. When we investigate soils and their development, we must take
into account numerous factors. Those minerals which go into solution and those
which form anew, depend on the source material, on the climate, on the topo-
graphic situation, on the organisms living in and on the soil, and on the interval
of time during which these factors have been active. Thus it is to be borne in
mind that the succession of climatic changes throughout the past can be super-
imposed upon the soil. The science of agronomy is devoted to studying these

250
Weathering and Soil Mineral Formation
processes. We shall consider here only one example, summarized in Fig. 332, of soil
development on the basaltic rocks in Hawaii. Here the climate is warm and con-
stantly humid, but rainfall fluctuates greatly. In regions of low rainfall, the clay
mineral montmorillonite forms in the soils ; with in creasing rainfall, kaolinite, and
finally Al and Fe hydroxides. Montmorillonite formation paralleis development
of alkalinity in the more concentrated soil solutions. With increasing dilution,
the influence of carbonic acid is noted, the soil solutions become neutral or
slightly acid, and kaolinite forms. Upon further leaching, kaolinite is also dissolved
and Al-hydroxides remain behind.

Fig. 332. Development of clay minerals in Hawaiian soils in a constantly humid climate.
(After SHERMAN, 1952)
In climates where intervals of repeated rainfall and aridity prevail, the soils
are not only leached downward from the surface, but water migrates upward
in the soil during times of aridity and can give rise to mineral formation.
Weathering products can exhibit all gradations between X-ray amorphous
and more or less well crystallized minerals. Weathering products in the soil are
predominantly those with layer lattices, such as the Al and Fe-hydroxides,
montmorillonite, and kaolinite. Soils which are rich in hydroxides are frequently
called laterites. There is some disagreement, however, over the exact definition
for laterite.
Bauxites, composed primarily of aluminum
hydroxides,
are weathering
products. Tertiary and younger bauxites consist primarily of gibbsite (hydrar-
gillite), y-AI(OH)3' Mesozoic bauxites of boehmite, y-AIOOH, and those of
Paleozoic age of diaspore, or.-AIOOH. There are, however, many exceptions to
these generalizations. Bauxites are our chief source of aluminum.
Occasionally, in depressions and joints in limestone, pisolitic iron ores occur,
probably as remanents from lateritic weathering. A typical ore might consist
of about two-thirds goethite and one-third kaolinite.
Thus, as the inorganic constituents of soils, we find the unaltered residues of
weathering, minerals formed as weathering products, and finally true and colloidal
solutions which still circulate within the soil. In addition, the soil contains organic
components, which consist partly of organisms, and partly of humus derived
from their remains. Layer silicates play an important role in the soils, both as
residual minerals and as weathering products. As a result of their high surface
areas they can adsorb ions, which can be exchanged reversibly with other ions
in solution. Especially important in this respect are micas, kaolinite, and mont-
morillonite. The mica in soils is probably mostly residual from weathering.

Weathering of Ore Deposits
251
Montmorillonite has the capacity to adsorb ions between its layers as well as on
its external surfaces, so that it has an effectively greater specific surface.
4. Weathering 01 Ore Deposits
Iron-bearing Ores. In the previous discussion we were concerning ourselves
with weathering of normal, or the widely distributed common rock types. Different
conditions are prevalent in other special cases. Because of their economic im-
portance, we need to consider the effects of weathering on ore deposits. These
generally contain for the most part iron sulfides which, upon weathering, form
iron hydroxides.
Miners have for a long time been familiar with the "iron caps " or gossans
which frequently overlie mineral deposits. As an example of hydroxide formation,
we can consider the breakdown of FeS2. Although the pyrite form is rather
stable, the marcasite modification decomposes easily in moist air according to
the following series of reaetions :
4 FeS 2+4 H20+14 O2
= 4 FeS04+4 H2S04
4 FeS04+2 H2S04+O2 = 2 Fe 2(S04la+2 H20
2 Fe 2(S04la+8 H20
= 4 FeOOH+6 H2S04
Summary equation:
4 FeS 2+ 10 H 20+15 O2 = 4 FeOOH+8 H2S04.
Thus both ferrous and ferric sulfates are formed as intermediate products.
This is important because gold, which commonly occurs as an impurity in pyrite,
is somewhat soluble in the presence of ferric sulfate and so can be carried away.
According to the above reactions, from each mole of FeS2 two moles of H 2S0 4
are produced. This sulfuric acid can react with other minerals producing, for
example, gypsum, through reaction with limestone. Especially important is the
utilization of oxygen ; all in all, 15 moles of O2 for every 4 moles of FeS2. Thus
we are dealing with an oxidation phenomenon. Mineral deposits so produced
by the weathering of sulfides under the influence of oxygen in the air are referred
to as oxidized mineral deposits.
Magnetite also oxidizes readily to Fe203, usually forming oc-Fe203, hematite.
The external morphology of magnetite crystals may be preserved, with the forma-
tion of so-called pseudomorphs (pseudos, gr. false) of hematite after magnetite.
Such a pseudomorph is sometimes called martite. Sometimes this oxidation
takes place with preservation of the gross aspects of the crystal structure. In
this case y-Fe203, maghemite, is formed, which is strongly magnetic like magnetite.
As we had noted earlier (p.91) the magnetite structure is built from a cubic
close packed array of oxygen atoms. When oxidized to maghemite this packing
is not affected, but Fe ions migrate into the outer layers formed as a result of
addition of oxygen, according to the equation,
4Fe304+O2= 6Fe203·
Thus Fe vacancies develop in the original Fe lattice. This process results in the
formation of fine grained aggregates, rather than pseudomorphs.
Lead and Copper Ores, Whereas iron sulfides form hydroxides, because their
sulfates are unstable, lead sulfides alter to the very insoluble sulfate, anglesite
(PbS04) . By reaction with carbonic acid this may give rise to the carbonate,
cerrusite (PbC03). Copper sulfides alter to basic carbonates such as the green
variety, malachite [Cu2(OH)2C03] and the blue azurite [Cu3(OH)2(C03)2].
Cementation Zone. During the weathering of sulfide deposits, the solutions
produced can react at greater depth, where no oxygen is present, with fresh

252
Weathering and Soil Mineral Formation
primary sulfides present there. In this way at the expense of the sulfides of base
metals (Fe), sulfides of precious metals, such as copper and silver, are formed.
Thus there is an enrichment due to the formation, for example, of chalcocite,
Cu2S, bornite, CusFeS4 , and argentite, Ag2S. This enriched zone is called the zone
of cementation or of supergene enrichment.

VIII. Sedimentary Rocks
1. Clastic Sediments
Introduction. The mechanical and chemical weathering products of rocks,
after they have been transported and redeposited, are called sediments. The
transporting agents are water, wind, and ice, and in rare instances organisms.

Deposition takes place under the influence of gra vity, as a result of settling,
flocculation, and chemical precipitation, the latter either directly or through the
action of organisms. Likewise evaporite deposits are sediments because they are
redistributed products of weathering. On the other hand tuffs, even though
sedimented after transport, are not sediments because they are not products of
weathering.
We have seen that as a result of chemical weathering new minerals are formed,
of which the hydroxides and aluminum silicates are the most important. In
addition some minerals escape weathering, either because like quartz they are

very insoluble or because erosion sets in before chemical weathering has come to
an end. These residual minerals, as weIl as weathering products and ions in
solution, constitute the raw materials for sediment formation. The resistant

Fig. 334. Summary of different grain size classification of clastic sediments
minerals comprise mainly the sandstones. The
aluminum silicate weathering
products accumulate, along with the finest grained resistates, to form cIays. These
two groups, along with deposits of gravel, pebbles, and boulders, constitute the
clastic (gr. klazein, to crush) sediments. Limestones, phosphates, siliceous rocks,
and evaporites form from solution.
Rivers and streams are the most important transport agents. Fig. 333 shows
two examples of the variations in transport capability of large rivers. Although
the suspended load can vary considerably during the course of a year, the dissolved
load remains noticeably constant, as shown here for both the Danube at Vienna
and the Nile at Cairo.
Clastic sediments are cIassified according to their grain size. Rocks whose
constituents have diameters greater than 2 mm are called psephites (psephos, gr.,
stone) ; between 2 and 0.02 mm psammites (psammos, gr., sand), and less than
0.02 mm pelites (gr. pelos, cIay). In Fig. 334 is given the cIassification used here

Grain-size
Distribution.
Conditions
of transport
and
sedimentation
are
generally such that a sediment is produced whose particles exhibit a variety of
grain size classes . The grain-size distribution is determined by sieving and in the
case of smaller particles, by screening the sediment. It is conve nient to subdivide
size distribution arithmetically into groups of equal size range. From a sieve
analysis of a well-graded gravel, one can adopt the usual numerical progression,
grouping grains which are 1- 2, 2-3, 3-4 mm, etc. Usually, however, the size
distribution covers such a wide range, that it is useful to adopt a logarithmic
classification. In the United States a logarithmic scale to the base 2 is used,
involving the grouping A-t, t-t,t-·Lt- l , 1- 2,2 - 4, 4- 8, 8-16 mm ,
etc. In Germany sub-division to the base 10 is used giving groupings such as
0.002-0.02,0.02-0.2, 0.2-2 ; 2-20, 20-200 mm, etc. If we want to sub-divide
these further, it is sensible and convenient also to make the sub-divisions decadal-
logarithmically, so that equal intervals result, such as 0.02-0.063, 0.063-0.2,
0.2-0.63, 0.63- 2 mm, etc., based on grain diameters. The detailed size distri-
bution should be determined accurately by sieving and screening. Sands, gravels,
and boulders can of course be fairly accurately differentiated visually or with a
hand lens. The nomenclature based on grain size for clastic sediments is given
in Table 48.

Grapbical Representation of Size Distribution. Two methods are customarily
used for graphical representation of sieve and screen analysis. Tbe first is the
distribution curve, based on construction of bar graphs or histograms. Along the
abscissa the chosen size-grades are plotted. The amount of each size grade, as
weight percent, is plotted along the ordinate . The areas of each bar of the histo-
gram must be proportional to the percentage of each constituent size grade. Then
the curve which outlines the histogram is the distribution curve (Fig. 335). We
can see readily the advantage offered when equal spacings are used for equal
changes in size grade. If unequal spacings are used, changes must be made in the
ordinate plot for each grade, if the area is to represent th e amount of each size
grade present.
While the distribution curve gives us a rather graphic picture of the grain
size distribution, is it not as easily visualized directly from the second type of
presentation used, the cumulative curve. This type of graphical representation

ent schematic cumulative curves are illustrated, and qualitatively interpreted.
The grain size distribution of a clastic sediment is the result of a combination
of transport and depositional variables. Their interrelationships are usually so
complex, that it is not possible to draw definite conclusions from grain size
distributions, concerning transport and depositional processes. One might be
able to conclude, for example, that sands deposited by wave action on beaches,
would be particularly well-sorted. That is, they would have a very narrow range of
particle sizes. However, river sands and wind blown dune sands can exhibit similar
grain size distributions (Fig. 337). Glacial tills, deposited by ice, have generally a
very broad grain size distribution ; they are especially poorly sorted (Fig. 338).
Other criteria, related to transport and sedimentation history, include grain
shape and deqree 01 rounding.
The median diameter (md), obtained from a cumulative curve, can be used
as one means of characterizing clastic sediments. This indicates that grain size
for which 50 percent of the grains are smaller and 50 percent are larger. Another
parameter frequently used to characterize sediments is the sorting coefficient,
given as So =VQ3/Ql . Ql and Q3are the first and third quartiles.Ql' represents that

diameter which has 25 % of the distribution smaller than itself. The third quartile,
Q3' is that diameter which has 75% of the distribution smaller than itself. The
better sorted asediment, the smaller the difference between Q1 and Q3' and,
therefore, the closer the sorting coefficient, So, will approach the value 1. Values
up to 1.5 represent weIl sorted and beyond 2, poorly sorted sediments.

Psepbites. In the case of psephitic rocks, the degree of rounding of grains is
used as a parameter in classification. Loose sediment composed of rounded
pebbles is called gravel, of angular blocks, rubble. The corresponding consolidated
rocks are called conglomerates and breceias.
Psammites. In the case of tbe finer

sands and sandstones,
classification is not based so much on grain shape, but rather mineralogical
composition
of
constituent grains and interstitial materials. Feldspar and
chlorite rich sandstones, also containing rock fragments, are called graywackes
(Fig. 339); sandstones containing much feldspar are arkoses ;and those containing
abundant carbonate, calcarenites. Calcium carbonate can also occur as a cement

between detrital grains in calcareous sandstones. Detrital grains are cemented by
silica in siliceous sandstones. If the original quartz grains are cemente d by quartz,
the result is a quartzite. When clay occurs interstitially, we have an argillaceous
sandstone.
Residual rock fragments in sandstones are usually coarser than 2 mm, as
long as they do not themselves consist of very fine-grained material. Quartz
and feldspar predominate between 0.02-2 mm, and the clay minerals below

The average chemical analysis of pelitic and psammitic rocks in Table 49
indicates that chemical differentiation takes place during the sedimentation of
clastic sediments. The psammites are on the average richer in Si02 than pelites.
In individual instances, this differentiation can lead to essentially pure quartz
sandstones.

Guide lUinerals. In addition to the major mineral constituents mentioned,
sandstones also contain still other minerals in much smaller amounts. The in-
vestigation of these minor constituents has become important in the last decade.
It is possible with the help of these accessory minerals in man y cases to identify
and correlate sedimentary layers, especially in borings, where so little sample is

recovered that the characteristic guide fossils are often lacking. In practice the
investigation of such minerals is usually confined to those "heavy" minerals
which have a specific gravity greater than 2.9. They are usually separated in the
laboratory from the lighter constituents
by means of heavy liquids,
such as
bromoform. It should be emphasized
that proper identification of heavy min-
erals requires careful mineralogical crys-
tal
optic work,
without which quite
serious errors in identification can occur.
Very often identification is restricted to
easily recognized heavy minerals such as
rutile, zircon, garnet, and tourmaline,
and with the help of statistics inter-
pretations are attempted. It is frequent-
ly more profitable to place more value
on observation of individual mineral spe-
eies. For example, distinction between
yellow
and red garnets, and rounded
and non-rounded zircons
in
different
size fractions, have proven very useful
in investigations in the north German
Rhaet.

The mineral assemblages occuring in ancient sediments need not always be
the originaIones. The numerous diagenetic processes which are at play in a
sediment after sedimentation and prior to metamorphism can dissolve minerals
or form new ones. The extent to which a mineral is "stable", depends on the
nature of these diagenetic processes.
It is questionable though, whether heavy minerals alone are sufficient to
unravel the source of the sediment. We must always be seeking additional guide

minerals. By noting the presence of " desert quartz", characterized by its round-
ing and iron oxide coating, in the Cape Verde Basin , it became clear that desert
dust was blown there during the last ice age. Sediments collected in the Gulf
of Guinea during th e Meteor expedition, and studied mineralogically, primarily
by V. LEINZ , serve as a particularly fine example of the effect on guide mineral
distribution by ocean currents. Since only the sources of the mineral assemblages
are to be illustrated, it is not important that the sediments He in part in the
deep sea. As Fig. 342 shows, the strong Guinea Current, flowing from the west
at more than 0.5 rn/sec, carries a characteristic assemblage of splintery augite (A) ,
microcline (M), tourmaline (T), zircon (Z), and rounded quartz grains (Q). These

minerals are derived from the adjacent mainland and distributed by the current
flowing parallel to the coast . From the south the South Equatorial Current
transports young volcanic material, glass (G) and a characteristic augite (I),
derived from the predominantly basaltic rocks of the island chain Fernando Po,
Principe, SiLo Thome, Anno Born, and St. Helena. It also carries splintery quartz
(S) along with it, which comes from the mainland coast to the south. It is still
noted as the most abundant mineral the farther removed from the source. The
other larger grains have been left behind during the course of transport. As is
shown here in the case of augite and quartz, crystal morphology is a diagnostic
property worth noting. It is to be noted further, that from the effect of the
Guinea Current, two sands collected from the northeast point of Fernando Po
Island contain only heavy minerals from the 100 km distant north coast, but none
from the island itself.
This study shows also that one must be very cautious in correlating beds
on the basis of similar trace mineral content. In Fig. 342 at sampie locations where
two sets of mineral notations are given, the lower one indicates sediments which
are known to have been deposited during the last glaciation. In attempting to
correlate these in a manner analogous to correlation procedures for borings, one
would conclude that the diluvial sampie at station 225 was of the same age as
the recent marine sediment at station 222. The same error might be made relative
to th e diluvial sediment at station 232.
Placer Deposition. A natural enrichment of heavy minerals can occur in
deposits formed by the running water of streams and rivers, as weIl as by wave
action along the shores of th e ocean. Along the shore incoming waves carry sedi-

ment in suspension. This quickly settles out and individual grains are caused to
roll along the bottoms. Fig . 343 depicts the relative sizes of grains of gold (d = 19.3),
magnetite (d= 5), garnet (d= 4) and quartz (d= 2.65) which have (a) the same
settling velocities in water and (b) the same rolling velocity. The rolling velocity
is that water velocity just sufficient to set a grain in motion. If the water velocity
is just sufficient to put a quartz grain in motion, only heavier materials pro-
portionally smaller than those shown will roll away with it. The greater the
difference in specific gravity between mineral grains, the smaller the grains left
behind. The relationship between grain size and specific gravity of particles of
equal settling velocity is expressed by the formula of STOKES,

where Tl and T2 are the radii and d1 and d2 the specific gravities of the equivalent
spheres (for exact calculations involving grains> 0.05 mm in diameter, the more
complex formula of OSEEN must be used). The rolling 01' traction velocity is
governed by the following formula of NEWTON

(11- 1'
In the flowing water of streams it is probably a combination of settling and
removal by traction, resulting from turbulence, that leads to enrichment of
heavy minerals in sediments. As a result of this winnowing process, placer de-
posits have formed in which gold and platinum, precious stones, such as diamond
01' topaz, and ores like cassiterite have become concentrated. These deposits
represent a geochemically important concentration, also observed in ancient
sediments.
Pelites. While psammites are composed essentially of coarse grained resistant
minerals, pelites 01' clays consist of the very fine grained weathering products.
To the chemist 01' ceramist the term clay has quite a different connotation than as
used by the petrographer. The raw material for fine ceramic products is the rock
material called kaolin, which consists predominantly of the clay mineral kaolinite.
Kaolins occur as metamorphic-hydrothermal deposits, 01' as residual weathering
deposits, sometimes sedimented following relatively short transport. This concept
of a clay would thus embrace numerous true sediments. The term clay is used
in this way in the heavy ceramic, in particular the brick industry. These argilla-
ceous sediments represent the depositions of the finest grained materials from
running 01' standing bodies of water. Deposition of coarse-grained sediment gives
rise to psammites, fined grained sediment to pelites. There is general lack of
agreement on the dividing line between the two types of sediments. Since the
properties of rocks vary continuously with grain-size, the boundary is wholly
arbitrary. We shall consider as clays those rocks whose constituents are pre-
dominantly within the 2-20 {J. range. We shall consider 20 {J. as the upper limit
of clay-size material.
As deposits of the finest sediments, clays consist first of all of residual weather-
ing products which remain for a long time in suspension, either by virtue of their
fine grain-size 01' their platy morphology. In addition they consist of newly formed
minerals which are alsofine-grained and platy in habit. In addition clays often
contain appreciable amounts of organic remains, calcareous and siliceous tests,
as weIl as partially decomposed organic matter. A fourth group of constituents
form subsequently in the sediment by diagenesis, and include FeS2 , glauconite,
and some carbonates.

Clastic Sediments
263
When the different clay minerals are transported into the ocean, their sedimen-
tation behaviors may vary. Illites and kaolinites may settle out much more rapidly
than montmorillonite, which may remain in suspension for a much longer time.
Although it was formerly believed that all clays consisted primarily of kao-
linite , we know today that the most common constituents of sedimentary clays
are imperfect, poorly crystallized micas, which are deficient in potassium, per-
haps as a result of replacement by H30+ ions. This chemical and structural
deficiency may be so extensive that it results in mixed layering, in which mica
and montmorillonite layers are intimately intergrown. The entire group of
deficient micas is frequ ently called the illite group. These micas are probably
for the most part detritial residual weathering produ cts. By means of K-A age
determination methods, it has been shown in some instan ces in young sediments,
that these micas are older than the age of the sediment containing them. They
were derived from older sediments which blanketed th e greater part of the
earth's surface. In ancient sediments micas are also found which are younger
than the sediment containing them, having form ed by diagenesis or by growth
of smaller mica particles. Diagenetic chlorite occurs especially in those clays
which have been deposited from highly saline waters, produced by evaporation
of sea waters. Thus clay mineral form ation is not restricted to development in
soils with subsequent incorporation into sediments. They can form also directly
in the sediment .
Depending on their degree of consolidation and fissility, clays may be de-
signated as clay-stones or shales (bedded). Some claystones owe their hardness to
cementing agents, especially carbonates. Because of their very fine particle size,
characterization of the mineral composition of clays by microscopic studies is
very limited. X-ray diffraction studies are most useful in this respect. Characteri-
zation of clays, based on chemical analysis or particle size distribution alone, is
not likely to be very successful.
Sedimentary Structures and
Textures. Having become familiar with the
constituents of clastic sediments, we want to look now at their characteristic
structures. We have already considered their textural characteristics in dealing
with grain-size distributions. The most important and diagnostic structural
characteristic of sediments is their layering or bedding. This is so characteristic
that we frequently refer to sedimentary rocks as layered rocks. The bedding or
stratification is an expression of variations in material supply during deposition,
which has changed in some way between deposition of contiguous layers. Fig. 333
(p. 253) illustrates the annual variations in suspended load characteristic of dif-
ferent rivers. The sedimentary column provides evidence of the effects of climatic
variations on sediment supply. We can frequently observe quite thin clay films
deposited between two identical beds of limestone. This is interpreted as indi-
cating transport of clay sediment during abrief interval of high rainfall during
aperiod of otherwise high aridity. In lakes, which are fed by glacial streams, the
influx of sediment is greatest in summer, and relatively coarse particles sediment
out . During the course of winter the fine particles are deposited, when sediment
supply and water movement have ceased. In this way laminated deposits of clays
are formed. Such stratified Pleistocene glacial lake deposits are also called varves.
These have been used to count the number of years which have lapsed since the
retreat of glaciers. Volcanic ash eruptions, changes in climate and sea-Ievel, and
changes in the produ ctivity of organisms can give rise to stratification. Thus prob-
lems of stratification are important in petrology in reconstructing earth history.
In sediments deposited from flowing media such as wind, water, and ice,
often there is preserved evidence of the direction of flow. In glacial deposits, linear

deposits of glacial drift are oriented with their long axes in the direction of flow.
This direction is preserved in th e ground moraine after the ice melts. In rapidly
flowing water, flat pebbles are arranged like shingles, tilted in the direction of
stream flow. In slowly flowing water certain objects, like shreds of seaweed and
animal remains such as graptolites or pteropod shells, can be easily lined up
parallel to the direction of flow. In moving, as weIl as in calm water, platy objects
such as mica flakes (Fig. 344) and pelecypod and other shells, are deposited
parallel of the bottom. Such mica plates can give rise to fissility parallel to the
platelet surface. This phenomenon has been given the misleading name, primary
cleavage. It would be better to reserve the expression cleavage for structures
formed by later changes.

ESKOLA)
If a fine mud is caused to move down a slope and becomes mixed with over-
lying water, suspension or turbidit y currents are formed. The suspension will
have a higher density than pure water. Values up to 1.2 have been observed.
Therefore, they have the ability totransport coarse material within them over long
distances. Sediment finally deposited from such turbidity currents will show
graded bedding, with coarser material at the bottom, grading upward into finer
material.
Both as a result of flow of water and wind as weIl as wave motion, wavy sediment
surfaces can be formed. From the geometry of these so-called ripple marks, which

Limestone and Dolomite

may have wave lengths from centimeters to hundreds of meters (dunes), the
mode of occurrence can be deduced. Current ripples are asymmetrical (Fig, 345)
whereas, as a result of the back and forth motion of waves, oscillation or wave
ripples are symmetrical (Fig. 346). If the current dircction changes, supcrimposed

ripple marks are formed in response to the changing currents. In cross section
the sediment then shows crossed bedding. This can happen also as a result of a
change in current velocity, for example, in the formation of delta deposits.
Additional kinds of irregular surfaces can form as a result of slumping of
clumps of sediment on a sloping surface. Such subaquatic slump structures are
a form of folding which may be quite similar in appearance to folds formed by
tectonic processes.
2. Limestone and Dolomite
Solubility 01Calcium Carbonate. Bedding is not restricted to clastic sediments.
It is a characteristic property also of sediments of chemical or biogenic origin,
such as calcareous muds.
Next to clastic sediments, limestones are the most widely distributed. In order
to understand their mode of origin it is necessary that we first clarify the solu-
bility relationships of calcium carbonate. Usually one finds the statement that
calcium carbonate is soluble as the bicarbonate. Since this can lead to some
misunderstanding, we shall prefer to consider the interrelationships of ions in
solution. The solubility of calcium carbonate in pure water is expressed by the
solubility product,
(1)
In natural environments carbonic acid is almost always present and it dis-
sociates according to the relationship :
(2)
This equation is designated as the first dissociation constant of carbonic acid. :
The RCO; ions can dissociate further, according to the expression :
(3)
Thisseconddissociationconstantis very smalI, indicating that RCO;dissociatesonly
very slightly. If R + and CO; ions were to be found in solution they would strive
to combine according to equation (3). Limestone in aqueous solution produces
Ca':' and CO;
ions, although very few in number. If R + ions are added to the
solution, CO;
ions are utilized to form RCO;, the equilibrium of equation (1)
is distrubed, and additional Ca++ goes into solution in order to establish equilibrium
of the three reactions. On the other hand, if we remove R + ions from solution,
CaC03 must precipitate, because of the resulting excess of CO; ions in solution.
We find , therefore, that by adding carbonic acid, or acids in general , dissolution
of calcium carbonate takes place ; reduction of acidity results in carbonate pre -

cipitation. Since in nature only carbonic acid plays an important role, the con-
centration of carbon dioxide in solution is the most important factor affecting
carbonate formation. The solubility of carbon dioxide is very dependent upon
temperature. It is reduced by half over the temperature interval from 00 to 200 C.
Therefore, the temperature influence is extremely important. Of course, it only

plays a role in cases where a gaseous phase is present and in contact with the
solution. The solubility of carbon dioxide, like all gases , is increased with pressure.
This effect perhaps may be important in the case of many springs, in which case
apressure decrease would occur, except on the ocean bottom where elevated
pressure prevails. However , a voluminous supply of carbon dioxide, sufficient to
exceed the saturation limit, has not been demonstrated up to now.
At a fixed carbon dioxide concentration the equilibrium changes with tem-
perature, the solubility of calcium carbonate [Eq. (1)] decreasing with rising
temperature. In addition the equilibrium constants of Eq. (2) and (3)are changed,
K 2 growing more rapidly than K I • The temperature rise is effective here also in
diminishing the solubility of calcium carbonate . The pressure also affects the
dissociation of carbonic acid, increasing the solubility of calcium carbonate in
water (at fixed CO2-content).
Finally the effect of salinity is to be considered. If we add Ca ++ or C0 3 ions
to an equilibrium solution of CaCOa in pure water, without varying external
conditions, CaCOa mu st precipitate, since the solubility product constant, L, is
indeed constant . The solubility is reduced . Foreign ions will increase the solubility,

Limestone and Dolomite
267
changing the constant, L. In addition, complex formation probably plays a role.
As the ultimate result the solubility of calcium carbonate in sea water does not
differ appreciably from that in pure water, as Fig. 347 shows. Aragonite instead
of calcite as a precipitate possesses a greater solubility. The solubility product
of calcite in sea water at 25°C and one atmosphere pressure is 4.5 X 10-9 ; for
aragonite, 7.1 X 10-9 (BERNER, 1965).
Terrestrial Limestone Formation. In fresh water the influence of foreign ions
can play only a subordinate role. Calcareous surface deposits, as have been
described especially from South Africa, form where water rises in the soil by
capillarity and evaporates at the surface. In areas of high precipitation, carbonic
acid charged water dissolves limestone within the mountains at low temperatures
and this, when it flows to the warmer surface, precipitates out as travertine.
Plants can also play an important role in that they remove carbon dioxide from
water. In inland lakes we sometimes find limestone deposits which are called
lake marls. In this case the decrease in CaCOa solubility can be attributed to
evolution of carbon dioxide due to a rise in temperature, as weIl as its removal
by assimilation by green plants. It has been calculated that a lake bottom covered
with the plant species Potamogeton lucens can form annually approximately
5 g/cm2 of calcium carbonate.
Marine, Inorganic Carbonate Formation and Dissolution. Marine carbonate
precipitation is far more important and widespread. We know today, primarily
as a result of the investigations of H . WATTENBERG, that the surface water of
the ocean is at least saturated and, in the tropics, always supersaturated with
calcium carbonate. This supersaturation can be relieved only with difficulty and
then only by means of CaCOa nuclei. Quartz and calcareous shells of animals are
ineffective as seeds for precipitation. Only when shells are pulverized by the surf
and freed of their organic coatings, are they effective as seeds. We should expect
inorganic carbonate precipitation, therefore, primarily only in shallow seas. There,
as a result of complete reduction of supersaturation, as much as 80 g of calcium
carbonate could precipitate out of a cubic meter of sea water. Since a continual
supply of new supersaturated sea water can be brought in by ocean currents,
limestone deposits of considerable thickness could form in this manner.
The deeper portions of the ocean are to a considerable degree undersaturated
with CaCOa, because at the lower temperature, the higher pressure, and a supply
of CO2 from decomposing organic substances, the supersaturation of water
sinking from higher levels is decreased. Thus, in many places in the deep sea,
dissolution of calcium carbonate can take place.
Marine Biochemical Carbonate Formation. In addition to inorganic processes,
limestone can originate also from biochemical processes. A great many organisms
form their shells and tests from calcium carbonate. We can formulate the follow-
ing classification, in which organisms are grouped according to their form of
habitat into benthonic (sessile), planktonic (floating) and nektonic (free swim-
ming) forms.
1. Plants :
a) Benthonic calcareous algae: Lithothamnien, Halimeda, etc.
b) Planktonic calcareous algae : Coccolithophoridae.
2. Animals:
a) Benthonic : corals, calcareous sponges, foraminifera, bryozoa, brachiopods,
echinoderms, molluscs, worms, crustaceans.
b) Planktonic : foraminifera, pteropods.
c) Nektonic: crustaceans (trilobites, ostracods).

268
Sedimentary Rocks
In addition, green marine plants can contribute to carbonate deposits by
assimilation of CO2 from marine waters. Finally, we can mention the effec t
of bacteria, whose activity indirectly leads to carbonate deposition by removal
of H r-ions in the production of NHa. We cannot elaborate further here on these
effects.

Table 50 summarizes data available today on the world-wide distribution
of calcareous deposits in recent marine sediments. In particular we should note
that globigerina ooze is composed primarily of foraminifera. It need not, however ,
be composed predominantly of globigerina. Fig. 348 represents a section cut
through a specimen of globigerina ooze. If all of the calcareous shells were dis-
solved, only an argillaceous component, red clay would remain. This consists of
argillaceous weathering products of terrestrial origin, of volcanic material trans-
ported in part by winds, and of newly formed diagenetic minerals. Its usual
brown color arises from the oxygen content of the deep water which serves as
oxidation agent of iron-rich colloids.

In shallow marine sediments also foraminifera can contribute significantly,
as Table 51 shows. Calcareous algae, which play an essential role here, contri-
bute greatly to the formation of so-called coral reefs, as indicated in Table 52.
It is likely that the calcareous algae fraction has been overestimated, because
they are usually more fragile than corals and contribute an abundance of frag-
ments to the sediment.

At many places over the earth carbonate sedimentation occurs in quite

organisms. Fig. 349 presents a schematic cross section through a platform of

can be admixed with up to 40 % of fecal pellets produced by the indigenous
living fauna. At the reef-like borders of the platform strong turbulence prevails.
At this point spherical oolites form from the supersaturated sea water as a
result of precipitation of calcium carbonate around calcium carbonate nu olei.
An oolite particle, called an ooid, will remain in suspension, until it has grown
too large for the turbulence to sustain it in suspension. Oolites here make up
about 70% of the sediment. The origin of strange calcereous clumps, called
grapestones, is as yet unexplained. In the area noted they may make up as much
as 35 % of the sediment. At the outer edges of the platform algae, corals, and
pelecypods are found. The fine calcareous mud in many places consists of ara -
gonite needles. Wheth er these represent inorganic precipitates or are pulverized
remains of the abundant calcareous algae Halimeda, is still disputed. Primarily
as a result of reworking of reef material, a poorly crystallized Mg-rich calcite is
formed. Table 53 gives the aragonite and Mg-content of the hard parts of some
marine organisms. Calcite, containing very little magnesium in its structure, is
found in deeper water.
Because of its distorted structure, Mg-rieb calcite is more soluble than ara -
gonite, which in turn is more soluble than low Mg calcite . If sea water retreats,
exposing such a calcareous mud, rainwater preferentially dissolves the high
magnesium calcite and aragonite, with the deposition of low Mg-calcite as a
cement. Aragonite oolites may be coated by this secondary calcite, forming
hollow spheroids by subsequent dissolution of the aragonite. They may be filled
later by calcite . If this rapidly hardened limestone is covered again by sea water,
it can be reworked by wave action and incorporated as pebbles into newly formed
sediment .
In the case of sediments permanently covered by sea water, diagenetic trans-
formation can occur only after burial by additional sediment (see p. 293). Under
these conditions pseudomorphs of low Mg-calcite form after high Mg-calcite.
In contrast to earlier views, we know today that in addition to dolomite ,
mixed crystals of calcite with little Mg and of magnesite with little Ca can form.
A little ordered Mg-rich calcite has been found also in shells of organisms (Table53),
although aragonite can accept only very little Mg into its structure . Strontium
is accepted into both structures ; up to .........2,000 gfT in calcite and .........3,000 gfT in
aragonite.

Dolomite Formation. The old puzzle relating to the formation of dolomite
is nearer solution today than ever before. We know from natural observations
that dolomite can be formed shortly after or even contemporaneously with
carbonate deposition from sea waters, especially in lagoons in which high salt
concentration prevails. Very high local salt concentrations may result when
carbonate sediments are exposed as described above. In this case it results from
the evaporation of pore water. Under these conditions dolomite can form .
In addition, progress has been made in the experimental synthesis of dolomite.
Table 54 gives the solubility relationships of calcite and dolomite at room tem-
perature and at various salinities. Both minerals exhibit maximum solubility at
intermediate salinities. Additional investigations in the polycomponent system
Na-Ca-Mg-CI-S04-COa-H20 lend further support to these observations.
In addition to contemporaneous dolomitization, later secondary dolomiti-
zation can occur. Dedolomitization has been observed, involving reversal of
equilibrium and the solution of dolomite leading to deposition of calcite.

3. Sedimentary Iron and Manganese Deposits
Terrestrial Iron Ore Formation. In contrast to calcium and magnesium , iron
can be transported as a carbonate only under very special conditions. Important
in this respect is the complete absence of oxygen in solution. Ferrous carbonate
is less soluble than calcium carbonate, as Fig. 350 shows, but nevertheless con-
siderable amounts of iron can be transported in this way. Springs and streams
carrying such dissolved ferrous carbonate are found especially in marshy regions .
The iron can be precipitated out as iron carbonate in much the same way as
calcium carbonate, that is, by loss of 002 from solution, for example, as a result
of a temperaturc incroaeo. Such mineral deposits are known in marshy regions
and are often called white iron ores. Similar fossil iron deposits also occur in
conjunction with coal beds, and are then designated in amisleading manner as
clay ironstones.

Frequently it will happen that the iron carbonate charged water will dissolve
oxygen. When this happens iron hydroxide precipitates. In addition, bacteria
may initiate pre cipitation. They are able to use the 58 K cal liberated in the

Redox Potential. A reducing environment may be found whenever excess
organic matter is present, so that all oxygen is utiliz ed in the oxidation of the
organic matter. Today we consider oxidation and reduction in a more general
sense than simple loss or gain of oxygen. Oxidation involves increasing the
positive or decreasing the negative valence of an atom and thus the loss of elec-
trons. In like fashion reduction involves a gain in electrons. 'We utilize the redox
potential, Eh, to measure quantitatively the oxidation or reduction capabilities

of a medium. The Eh represents in volts the number of electrons necessary to
reduce the medium.
If a platinum electrode is immersed in a solution containing equal concen-
trations of Fe +2 and Fe+3 ions, it can be demonstrated that the Fe+2 ions give
up electrons to the platinum, giving it a negati ve charge. The Fe+3 ions tend to
take on electrons, giving the electrode a positi ve charge. The actual net charge
on the platinum electrode indicates which of the two reactions dominate. The
more negative the redox potential, the greater the reducing power of the less

oxidized substance. In aqueous solutions, with which we are always dealing in
sediments, it is always necessary to take into consideration the pR, that is, the
prevailing R + and OR- ion concentrations. Thus t he calculated equilibrium is
shifted between the Fe+2 and Fe+3 hydroxides :
according to the following equation:
Eh =0.271-0.059 x pR .
Thus equilibrium lies in the acid region at positi ve Eh and in the alkalin e region
at negative Eh.
In nature observed pR valu es lie for the most part between 4 and 9, the Eh
values between +0.6 and - 0.5 volt. Fig. 352 indicates the total dissolved iron
in relation to pR and Eh. Activity is the thermodynamic means of representing
concentrations of real solutions, which differ from those of ideal solutions. For
very dilute solutions, as in the case of Fig. 352, activity is practically equivalent
to t he ideal solubility.
lUarine Iron Ore Formation. While terrestrial iron ore formation basically
is readily understood, the explanation of marine deposits presents important
düficulties. The iron content of present ocean water is extremely low. About

Sedimentary Iron and Manganese Deposits

6-7 mg are present per ton of sea water. About 1,000 timesmoreiron is present
in colloidal solution. This is still far less than the 50 g/ton for the purest quartz
sand. On the other hand we know that in the geologie past, great amounts of
marine iron ores have been de posited, Prime examples are the minette ores in
Lothringen and the Dogger oolitic ores in southern Germany. As long as oxygen
is present in sea water, practically no iron can be present in true solution. The
ore deposits mentioned contain numerous remains of organisms, indicating that
the ores were deposited in an oxygen bearing medium in sufficient amounts to
support animal life. One can only conclude that the iron was transported as
hydroxide sols, which were flocculated in the marine environment. The floccs
ofte n became attached to mineral particles suspended in the water. Continued

Fig. 353. Iron oolite (Minette) Fentschtal, Lothringen. The black object is rolled up fragment
of mineralized echinoid plate. In the ground mass, calcite, stippled with cleavage, and quartz
build up gave rise to concentric layering. When the spheroids became so heavy
that they could no longer remain in suspension, they sank to the sea floor where
growth ceased. The resulting forms are called ooides and the accumulated rocks
oolite (Fig.353). It is essentially irrelevant how large the original nuclei were .
In turbulent sea water, other materials such as clay minerals can be transported
away, resulting in a concentration of iron minerals on the sea bottom locally.
Since present rivers carry only very small amounts of iron (,....,1 mgjliter), very
special weathering conditions must have prevailed in the source area on land.
They must have existed on a grand scale which we have not observed on earth
anywhere in recent times.
It has also been suggested that in marine zones with negative redox potential
and abundant CO2 , the iron could be leached out of normal sediments, trans-
ported as ferrous iron, and reprecipitated, depending on pR and Eh, either as
carbonate, sulfide, or ferrie hydroxide. Such processes are certainly possible.
The formation of extensive iron ore deposits, however, would necessitate con-
ditions which could be made to conform only with great difficulty to the ocean
circulation, which is invoked by density differences, the earth's rotation, and
wind patterns. Such processes would also imply that very extensive regions of
IS·

276
Sedimentary Rocks
normal sediments would have to be leached. Clays and shales contain on the
average (Table49) 6.5% and sands and sandstones 1.4% Fe 20a+FeO.
The formation of extensive sedimentary iron ore deposits has not taken place
throughout geologic time, but is restricted to certain periods. The formation of
iron coatings on mineral grains, which appear similar to oolites, can probably
also form concretions (see p. 311) on or in muddy sediment after deposition. One
must be extremely careful in trying to interpret the history of sedimentary iron
ores, because after deposition numerous changes, chemical reactions, and migra-
tion of material can be expected. During the course of time colloidal iron hy-
droxides recrystallize to goethite, at the same time incorporating co-precipitated
aluminum hydroxide into its structure. Upon further alteration the hydroxide
loses its water, forming Fe 20a or Fea0 4 , or it reacts with silica gel that was trans-
ported and precipitated with it as a sol, forming silicates. Apart of these may be
micas, similar to
glauconite, and another part chlorites
(Mg, Fe, Al)a(OH)2
[(Si, Al)4010]' transitional to cronstedite (Fe+a, Fe +2)6(OHls[Si, Fe +a)401O]' which
has the kaolinite structure. Consideration of the origin of these minerals belongs
in the chapter on rock transformation.
Glauconite Formation. In coastal regions, lagoons, and similar basins, primary
carbonate ore deposition can probably sometimes occur, although more frequently

floor, it must be a very early diagenetic mineral. Not infrequently foraminifera
shells are found filled with glauconite (Fig. 354). It is difficult to recast the many
analyses of glauconite into a simple generalized formula. This may be related to
the fact that alteration takes place readily on the sea bottom, but more likely to
the collection of most samples from surface outcrops. YODER and EUGSTER have
attempted to interpret glauconites as mixed
crystals of
celadonite, KFe+a-
MgSi4010(OH)2' muscovite KAI2Si40lO(OH)2' and pyrophyllite, AI2Si40lO(OH)2 '
Divalent iron is almost always present in glauconite, presumably substituting
for magnesium. It is also likely that glauconites include different minerals, which

277
fall only in part in YODER and EUGSTER'S system, and may be in part derived
from biotite. Glauconite could be form ed also from montmorillonite. Glauconites
with divalent iron must have been formed at th e appropriate Eh. A portion of th e
ferrous iron can have been oxidized in exposed outcrops.
Since sea water is essentially a NaCI solution it is reaIly surprising that a
potassium silicate crystallizes from it. Many observations indicate that the site
of origin of glauconite is ofte n not free sea water, but perhaps in the intestinal
tracts of marine organisms. This would provide a source of potassium from in-
gested plants and a reducing medium necessary for incorporation of ferrous iron.
Sulfide Formation. Redu cing environments can occur in sea water as well
as in sediments. Redu cing conditions may exist in those portions of the sea
separated from the general ocean, so th at they are not affecte d by deep ocean
currents. Here hydrogen sulfide can form at the deeper water levels. At th e
surface of such ocean segments a prolific fauna and flora are found. Remains of
organisms undergo decomposition as they settle to the sea bottom and in the
deeper levels oxygen is consumed by bacteria, which oxidize the organic matter
to CO2 . If no oxygen from surface waters in equilibrium with oxygen in the air
is supplied by sinking currents, decomposition of organic substances is con-
tinued by anaerobic bacteria. They form hydrogen sulfide either by breaking
down proteins or by utilizing oxygen from sulfate ions in sea water for oxidation
of carbonaceous substances, whose presence is prerequisite for the activity of
these bacteria. Table 55 summarizes data indicative of redu cing conditions for a
characteristic section in the Black Sea, in whose upper water levels the oxygen
graduaIly decreases and is present to about 150 meters depth. At this depth
H 2S appears and increases downward.

The prerequisite for H 2S charged water, therefore, is a well oxygenated
surface water layer, populated with abundant organisms. Any iron in this surface
water, which would be present as iron hydroxides rather than in solution, forms
sulfides from hydrogen sulfide, directly as FeS2 • Pyrrhotite also occurs in sedi-
ments, but only as a rarity. Such muds form ed by the influence of decomposing
organic substances are caIled sapropels (gr. sapros, rotting). In the Black Sea
sediments contain up to 2.5% FeS2 • POMPECKJ compared the Black Sea with
the sea of th e Posidonia shales in the Lias Epsilon of Germany ; later also the sea

Sedimentary Rocks
from which the lower Zechstein (Permian) Kupferschiefer was deposited. It
contains in places up to 3.6 % copper, 4.1% zinc, 2.6% lead, and 0.9 % silver.
These elements are combined in sulfides. According to recent investigations of
WEDEPOHL these same sulfides must be precipitating out by bacterial H 2S pro-
duction in normal sea water today (see Table 63, p.290), but in such small
amounts, that even a current mechanism which would supply fresh water from
time to time is insufficient to explain the high contents in sediments. A supple-
mentary supply from the continents must be considered. It could be shown that
in
th e Rotliegenden
(lower Permian) terrestrial sediments surrounding the
Kupferschiefer Sea, enrichment of these metals had already taken place under
high Eh conditions. Upon changing to a lower Eh they could be mobilized. These
sediments contain also up to 0.5% V, 0.03 % Cr, 0.12 % Ni, 0.04 % Co, and
0.15 % Mo all of which can be correlated with the carbon content . This suggests
that these metals are bound to the organic constituents of the sediment.
Sulfide muds always contain, in addition to clay constituents, such an amount
of organic matter as to suggest that an excess is present over that necessary to
produce hydrogen sulfide. It is very difficult to advance a mechanism to produce
in an ocean basin the pure sulfide deposits such as those illustrated in the Ram-
melsberg ore deposits at Goslar in the Harz Mountains. It is necessary to propose
direct outpouring over a very restricted area of heavy metal bearing waters of
relatively high concentration, for example, from volcanic exhalations. Then one
would have a sort of mixed volcanic-sedimentary deposit. Measurements of the
stable sulfur isotopes make it likely that, in addition to the H 2S supply, anaerobic
bacteria were also active.
Sulfide bearing sediments can form also beneath oxygenated bottom waters
if the hydrogen sulfide forms within the sediment. In contrast to water, this
H 2S is virtually fixed. Oxygen can be introduced only very slowly either by
flowing into the pores in the sediment or by diffusion. If within a sediment the
rate of burial is greater than the rate of oxidation of the organic constituents,
oxygen consumption and H2S production occur. Thus in th e blue muds distrib-
uted widely over the present ocean bottoms, the upper centimeter is usually
oxidized and colored brown, th e layers beneath containing FeS2 and colored
dark gray by organic matter. Argillaceous, organic rich sediments are probably
the source rocks for petroleum . The organic constituents change as the sediment
undergoes an increase in temperature and pressure and organic phases migrate
into adjacent porous rocks (reservoir rocks).
Sedimentary Manganese Deposits. Considerably less is known about the
origin of mangane se than about sedimentary iron ore deposits. Manganese, like
iron, forms divalent and higher valenee ions. Divalent manganese occurs in sedi-
ments as the carbonate, and as a minor component in solid solution in calcite
and dolomite. Trivalent manganese occurs occasionally as manganite, MnO(OH).
It has a lower symmetry than goethite, FeO(OH), but has similar lattice constants.
Hausmannite, Mna0 4 , is a rarer manganese mineral with a spinel-like structure.
The tetravalent manganese oxide, Mn02, occurs in a variety of form s. A weIl
crystallized form , which possesses a tetragonal lattice similar to rutile, is called
polianite. Pyrolusite , ßMn0 2 , form s as very fine grained, pseudomorphs afte r
MnO(OH). Structurally defective pyrolusite
with composition ranging from
MnO~.7Mn02 is used
commercially in batteries. Psilomelane
is a
collective
mineralogical term for mangancse ores of the general composition (Ba, H 20)
MnSOI O Cryptomelane, K ;;; 2MnSOl6 has the IX-Mn02structure and usually contains
potassium. The silicate braunite, Mn2 +Mn~ +IOsl [Si04 ] , occurs also in sedimentary
rocks.

Phosphate Deposits
279
Manganese eompounds are more readily soluble than the eorresponding iron
eompounds. Under natural Eh and pH eonditions, Fe2+ is more easily oxidized
than Mn2+. Thus, during sedimentation manganese and iron ean be separated
quite effeetively. This situation is an important faetor in ore deposition in the
sea, as well as in terrestrial deposits. Thus manganese eoneentrations, always
eontaining some iron, are found in deep sea sediments in the form of irregular
nodules, loeally in sueh great eoneentration that eonsideration is being given to
their exploitation as ore. The manganese is derived perhaps in part from dissolved
foraminifera shells, whieh ean eontain up to 0.02% MnO, but probably primarily
from the submarine weathering of voleanie material.
Manganese is biologieally an important element, being neeessary for photo-
synthesis. Plants ean eontain manganese of the order of 0.1 g/kg of dried material.
4. Phosphate Deposits
Phosphorus is an element of espeeially great biologie importanee. Along with
nitrogen, it is one of those elements whieh regulate the produetivity of organisms
on the land and in the sea. Aeeordingly the phosphorus eontent of sea water
varies between land 60 mg P per ton, depending on the population of organisms.
The souree of phosphorus is the weathering of apatite in igneous rock, whieh
brings it into solution, making it available to plants. The average value for the
phosphorus eontent of organie substanees ean be taken as about 0.6% P in dried
material. Animals piek up phosphorus by ingesting plants and, as is well-known,
vertebrates eoneentrate it in their skeletons. Here the phosphorus eontent may
vary up to about 14.7% P . It is present usually as a phosphate with the apatite
strueture, in whieh (OH) has replaeed the fluorine or ehlorine (hydroxy apatite).
Human beings ingest about 2.6 g P per day. The eoneentration and aeeumulation
of phosphorus in the bones of animals is an important souree of phosphorus.
Fossil feeal deposits (coprolites) oeeasionally aeeumulate in sediments. Guano forms
as a result of reaetion between limestone and fluid bird exerement. The phos-
phorus eontent of sedimentary iron deposits is due in part to the preeipitation of
phosphate with iron hydroxide, and partly to the ineorporation of organie sub-
stanees, espeeially skeletal remains. Invertebrates ean also eontain signifieant
amounts of phosphorus, as Table 56 indieates.

Sedimentary Rocks
Reworking and redeposition of sedimentary phosphate gives rise to deposits
whieh have been given numerous names. Usually they are grouped together as
phosphorites. The phosphate eomponent has the apatite strueture, with sub-
stituted F , Cl, OH, and COa ions. Aeeording to the available solubility data,
this phosphate should preeipitate direetly from sea water at a pH < 8.

Siliea also has a geoehemieal eycle dependent to a eonsiderable extent on
organie processes. Rivers flowing into the sea today earry Si02 in true solution.
Their Si02 eontent (see Table 58, p. 282) is appreeiably less than the solubility
of amorphous Si02 (see Fig. 331). Sea water is undersaturated therefore in Si02 •
As a result no direet preeipitation or erystallization ean take plaee. Some siliea
ean find its way into a sediment by ad-
sorption, but by far the greater portion
is abstraeted from sea water by organ-
isms whieh use it to form shells or skel-
etal material. In this form it is preeip-
itated as opal. The most important of
such organisms are the silieeous algae,
the diatoms. In fresh water environments
diatoms also extraet siliea from waters
and soil solutions to form shells. Fresh
water lake deposits of diatom shells are
ealled Kieselgur or diatomaeeous earth.
In the oeean their development is restrie-
ted mainly to the nutrient rieh waters of
the higher latitudes. Here diatomaeeous
muds are widely distributed as deep
sea
sediments.
In the lower, warmer
latitudes radiolaria and silico flagellates
take over as silieeous organisms. All
three groups are planktonie, settling to
the sea floor after death.
Enroute to the sea bottom some siliea is dissolved. This is evident in Fig. 355
whieh shows the distribution of dissolved siliea in sea water. We must presume
also that in sediments, espeeially those rieh in organie matter and with high
pH, the silieeous shells are dissolved further. It is no surprise, therefore, that in
the geologie reeord, the delieate diatom shells are preserved only rarely, whereas
the more rob ust and eoarser radiolaria often are preserved beautifully in Silurian
and Kulm (Carboniferous) sediments. An example is the radiolarite shown in
Fig . 356. It is erroneous to deduee that such sediments must be deep sea deposits,
simply beeause they eonsist only of robust shells. This indieates only that the
more delieate shells have been dissolved and implies nothing about whether the
solution resulted during settling to depth or oeeurred subsequently in the sediment.
The siliea eontent of sediments frequently ean stem from diatom and other
silieeous shells, even when they are no longer in evidenee, as a result of sub-
sequent redistribution of siliea within the sediment. In Table 57 some data for
bottom samples of the Meteor expedition are given. These indieate that in still
unaltered ealeareous as weIl as argillaceous sediments, eonsiderable amounts of
organogenie siliea ean be admixed. During the course of diagenesis segregation

of carbonate and silica may take place. It is common to find nodules of Si0 2 in
limestone. These are usually referred to as chert nodules. Si0 2 can migrate in
clays also, forming siliceous nodules.

On the sea floor , sessile or attached animals, such as siliceous sponqes, can
supply considerable amounts of silica to the sediment . Siliceous sponges are
undoubtedly th e source of supply of silica of the flints so widely distributed in
the upper Kreide (Cretaceous). Thus we can keep in mind th at not only could
the sponges have been dissolved on the sea floor, but th e silica must have migrated
in fresh sediment and, in addition, migration and reprecipitation occurred later,
for example, after the formation of fissures in the chalk.
Bedded siliceous rocks are sometimes called lydian stone; the individual
bands chert. Nodular siliceous accumulations, essentially of diagenetic origin
(p. 306), are called hornsiones, or when found in chalk, flint.

Sedimentary Rocks
6. Evaporite Deposits
The Source of Ions. We will consider now those chemical constituents which
go into solution during weathering and are carried ultimately in solution into the
ocean. We are concerned first of all with the alkali cations, which form no in-
soluble compounds at the earth's surface, and with the alkaline earths' whose
salts, including carbonates, are fairly insoluble. As we have already seen, in the
presence of carbon dioxide, they can be transported easily in solution. The
important anions are carbonate
(OO~) and bicarbonate
(HOO~), sulfate (SO;)
and chloride (01-). Table 58 permits a comparison of the composition of river

water with the composition of igneous rocks given in Table 42. Such a comparison
indicates that the cations, but not the anions, are derived from the igneous rocks.
The table shows very clearly that SiOz, Alz0 3 and Fe z0 3 are transported in very
small amounts as ions. These oxides combine to form weathering products and
contribute very little as ions in river water. The alkali and alkaline carth content
of river water varies considerably, especially in the case of Ca. This is the con-
sequence of the fact that about 75% of the earth's surface is covered with sedi-
mentary and only 25 % by igneous rocks. If limestone is quantitatively a more
important member of the sedimentary cover in a particular area, because of its
relatively high solubility it is reflected in the local composition of river water.
Such factors are not adequate, however, to account for the observed variations
in anion contents. The anion excess in river water is due to their having been
derived from volatile constituents from magmas. A significant part of the 01-
in river water sterns from sea water. Fine droplets produced by ocean waves
are distributed by wind over the continents and washed by rain into the streams.
These "cyclic salts" have been subtracted from the values for river water as
reflected in the corrected values in Table 58 (after the calculations of Oonway).

utilized further by green plants. NOais of organic origin.

chloride deposits may form. Table 59 gives a few analyses from some of the
quite varied continental evaporite deposits. In addition to soda (Na 2C03 • lOH20),
the mineral trona (Na 2C03 · NaHC03 • 2H20) occurs as an important carbonate.
Glauber salts (Na 2S04 • lOH20) and thenardite (Na 2S04) are found as common
sulfates. As borates are the minerals borax (Na 2B407 • 10H 20 ) (the most impor-
tant commercial source of boron) and kernite (Na 2B407 · 4H 20 ). In addition to
differences due to source area , climatic differences can lead to varied salt depo-
sition in continental deposits. Carbonates can be precipitated out at lower tem-
peratures, sulfates only at higher te mperature, and the deposition of the very
soluble chlorides takes place at the highest temperature.

lUineralogy of lUarine Evaporites. If an arm of the ocean is cut off and isolated,
evaporation leads to the formation of salt deposits. The German deposits of
Zechstein (Permian) age have been thoroughly and well-studied. As a result of
evaporation, calcium carbonate is first to crystallize out of sea water. We have
mentioned that the warm surface water of the tropics is even supersaturated
with calcium carbonate. It is still uncertain to what extent primary dolomite
precipitation takes place. Quantitatively the inorganic precipitation of carbonates
does not amount to much. From a body of sea water 3,000 m deep, a layer of
calcite only 16 cm thick would form. Following the carbonates is the precipitation

of sulfate and chloride salts. Some of the salts precipitated from sea water are
indicated in Table 61, the most common salts being emphasized in italics.
The System CaS04- H20. In order to understand th e conditions of formation
of these salts, we shall recall first the processes by which crystallization of a salt
from its solution takes place. We will illustrate again the two component system

since behavior at high temperature is of
no concern to us here. Likewise we are
not interested in behavior below O°C.
The system CaS0 4 - H 20 isimportantto
us because these sulfates precipitate out
of sea water following the alkaline earth
carbonates. InFig.357 the solubility rela-
tions are illustrated. Along the abscissa
the equilibrium concentration of CaS0 4
in water is plotted ; along the ordinate,
temperature. At low temperatures we
have gypsum, CaS04 . 2H20, as a preci-
pitate. The solubility curves for anhydrite
and gypsum intersect at 42°C. Above
this temperature anhydrite is the stable
precipitate. However, no anhydrite is
precipitated above 42° from aqueous so-
lution. Instead gypsum forms metastably
up to 97°C. Above this temperature it then transforms to the hemi-hydrate,
CaS 0 4 . 1/ 2 H 20, which is called bassamite when it occurs naturally. The hemi-
hydrate is called also pIaster of Paris , when gypsum is carefully dehydrated by
heating to 120-130°C. PIaster of Paris very easily takes up water again to form
gypsum during the setting pro cess. Likewise when sea water is artifically eva-
porated in salt pan s, gypsum always forms.

Evaporite Deposits
285
In the German evaporite deposits thick anhydrite beds are found overlying
the carbonates. Probably these formed from gypsum after deposition under the
influence of high temperatures, higher pressures and circulating salt solutions.
In support of this supposition are the textural relationships and the occurrence
of pseudomorphs of anhydrite after gypsum. In outcrops at the surface the
anhydrite is completely or partially changed to gypsum again by the influence of
surface water.
Two Salts in Aqueous Solution. If we now consider two salts in aqueous
solution, we can conceive of three types of situations. If the two salts have a
common ion, the solubilities are mutually diminished, if no intermediate com-
pound can form. Fig . 358 illustrates, by means of a three dimensional diagram,

the dependence of the mutual solubility of KCI and NaCI on temperature. Moles
of K 2Cl2 in 1,000 moles of H 20 are plotted from left to right, moles of Na 2Cl2 from
bottom to top, and the temperature range 20°-80°C from front to back in the
diagram. The basal surface gives by means of curve 81-84 the solubility of KCI
in water, curve R1-R4 gives that of NaCl. As we can see, the solubility of NaCI
is changed very little with temperature, that of KCI much more significantly.
Surface 81~ -84~ indicates how much KCI and NaCI can be in solution with
KCI as precipitate; surface
R1~ -
R4~ represents the same for NaCI as precipi-
tate. A solution is in equilibrium with precipitated NaCI as weIl as KCI along
the line of intersection of both planes, corresponding to line ~ -~. If a solution
of composition Q (10 moles K 2C12 , 20 moles Na 2Cl2 in 1,000 moles Hgt) at 20°C)
is evaporated it will cut the curve ~81 at point T . Concentration beyond this
point, as a result of evaporation, will precipitate out KCI, the solution will become
less concentrated in KCI until concentration ~ is reached, and then NaCI will
precipitate out as weIl. A KCI and NaCI saturated solution
(~) will precipitate
out KCI alone, by cooling along the indicated dotted line. In this way the two
salts can be separated from each other.
The second type of situation involves two salts with common ions and which
form
a compound. An example is MgCl2 and KCI which
form
carnallite,

MgCl2 • KCI . 6H20 (named after a mining superintendent, v. CARNALL). Fig. 359
illustrates a schematic section at 25°C through a three dimensional diagram for
MgCI2-KCI analogous to Fig.358. Again we shall consider an unsaturated
solution (point Q) and allow it to evaporate. At point T, KCI precipitates out and
continues until at point 0 the double salt precipitates. Now KCI and carnallite
are in equilibrium. In the solution there is, however, still too much MgCI2 , which
reacts with the precipitatcd KCl to form carnallite, until the solution has the
composition of point B . Now MgCI2 • 6H20
(bischojite) and carnallite are in
equilibrium and coprecipitate.

The third case is one in which the two salts have no common ions. Then the
solubilities are mutually increased. The solubility of CaS04 in water is greatly
increased by the addition of NaCI (Fig. 360); the solubility of NaCI is less affected
by CaS04 • By evaporating a solution with a composition Q, gypsum precipitates
first until point Pis reached, and only then does NaCI begin to precipitate. This
inerease in solubility can be utilized in effecting the solution of gypsum and
anhydrite rocks.
The Order of Crystallization from Sea Water. When sea water evaporates,
calcium carbonate and perhaps also dolomite precipitate first as the most in-
soluble components. Only when 70% of the sea water has evaporated, does
gypsum begin to precipitate ; by 89.1% halite, and only when 99.2% evaporated,
does carnallite come out. Here we cannot consider in detail the many possibilities
of evaporite deposition. It is the great contribution of the physical chemist
VAN'T HOFF to have clarified considerably the solubility relations of these salts.
In the following we shall look briefly at the formation of potassium salts and
assume that calcium carbonate, gypsum, halite, and also polyhalite have already
precipitated. This precipitation does not result in well-developed separate layers.
More often layers containing predominately anhydrite are interstratified with
layers rich in rock salt.
Table 62 from 0 . BRAITSCH summarizes the theoretical crystallization se-
quence, under different conditions and based on 100 m of rock salt, that would
result in the previously not detailed precipitation sequence A. The small numerals
specify the salts listed in Table 61. After A, follows the series B, during which

epsomite (e) and bloedite (bl) are precipitated in addition to halite. During
series C we meet, depending on the conditions, sylvite (sy), kainite (k), and leonite
(le), along with halite and epsonite, etc . In deriving this table it is assumed in the
three left hand columns, that stable equilibrium prevailed at 15°, 25°, and 35°C.
The two right hand columns indicate crystallization with metastable equilibrium
at 15° and 25°C.

How does a typical salt sequence appear in nature ? In Fig. 361 an example
is illustrated. The profile begins on the right at 0 meters. A comparison with
Table 62 shows that the correspondence between theory and observation is
quite poor, even when we quite ignore the sequence left of 150 m, where a faul t
occurs. The evaporite sequence was calculated also for higher temperatures up
to 83°C and somewhat better corres pondence was achieved, but we
cannot
accept such high tempera tures. The highest marine water temperature recorded
was 36°C in the Persian Gulf. From the kieserite-carnallite relations one can
conclude that temperatures around 40°C prevailed in the case described.
How do we account for the discrepancy between the laboratory experiment
and nature ? The composition of sea water could have been different. It appears

certain that in a portion of the Zechstein Sea a depletion of MgS04 occurred. It
is possible to calculate also the crystallization sequence from such sea water. When
this is done somewhat better agreement results between observed and theoretical
evaporite crystallization. Another important reason for the observed discrepencies
is metamorphism. The crystallized salts react at only moderate temperatures, as
will be shown later.
Even after the effects of metamorphism are taken into account and all the
observed salts explained with qualitative agreement, there always remain very

signilicant quantitative discrepancies. For example, much more anhydrite has
been formed proportionally than sea water should yield. On the other hand
kieserite and carnallite are less abundant than predicted and bishofite is com-
pletely absent. This is the last salt to precipitate out and evidently is not often
formed in evaporites. The great thiclmess of anhydrite indieates that during the
initial evaporation fresh sea water was introduced repeatedly, and so this dilution
must be taken into aeeount. The effect is to lead to anomalously thin deposits of
salts preeipitating from the later coneentrated solutions.

In support of this is the cyelic nature of the evaporite sequence. This can only
happen through the influx of new sea water. This rhythmic salt deposition is
very beautifully displayed in the two profiles shown in Fig. 362.
7. Rare Elements in Biogenie and Chemical Sediments
We have followed until now in sedimentation only a few especially common
elements. We want now to take note of the rarer elements. Their abundance in
sea water is indicated in Table 63.
Similar to what we had observed in igneous rocks , we find here also relatively
high values for some elements usually considered rare, and very low values for
some more familiar ones. We can comment on only a few of these.
Bromine is enriehed so strongly in sea water (Table 60) that it is produeed
from it in the United States. During the formation of evaporites, Br is isomorph-
ously incorporated into the chloride phases. Its behavior during crystalli-
zation of salt solutions was studied by BOEKE before 1908, and in the last 25years
has beeome a mueh used indicator for genetie and stratigraphie purposes. In
other sediments the bromine content depends on the origin and fate of organic
matter. Algae contain up to 0.12% and the coral genus Gorgonidae up to 0.26% Br
in the dried state.
Iodine is enriched in organisms. Laminaria algae can contain up to 1.7% I
based on dry weight. At one time iodine was extracted from such algae . In eva-

porites it occurs in anhydrite and polyhalite in liniensalz, an interstratification
of anhydrite and halite, and is present in salt clays (up to 20 mgft). The circu-
lation of iodine at the earth's surface has been studied especially weIl because
of its medical importance. It is enriched in the upper layers of the soil (600 to
8,000 gft). Rain water contains 0.2-5 mgft, river water about the same amount.
Through rain water, iodine is introduced into the saltpeter deposits on the coast
of Chile, where it is oxidized to iodate and removed from atmospheric circulation.
Fluorine occurs in sediments combined either in micas or in phosphates.
Boron like bromine is enriched in sea water (Table 60), and associated with
the micas in argillaceous rocks. The boron silicate tourmaline plays onIy a very
minor role. Several boron minerals occur in evaporite deposits. The most common
of these is boracite, (Mg, Fe, Mn)a ClB701a.
Among the rare cations, strontium is by far the most abundant. In spite of
this, separate strontium minerals are rare in marine sediments. This is because
it is camouflaged by incorporation into calcium compounds. It has been deter-
mined that aragonite contains up to 4.7% SrO, calcite 0.14% , anhydrite 0.69% ,
and primary gypsum 0.33 %. Recrystallization of carbonates and sulfates can
liberate Sr and in the presence of SO; ions celestite can form.
Rubidium is incorporated into carnallite and to a lesser extent in sylvite
evaporite deposits.
Of the remaining elements, nitrogen is of special interest. It is the main con-
stituent of the atmosphere, comprising 78.08% of its volume. It probably evolved
as a gaseous emanation very early in the history of the earth. As a result of
bacterial activity and to a lesser extent of electrical discharges in the atmosphere,
it is combined into nitrates and nitrites. Organisms utilize nitrogen primarily in the
synthesis of protein. After death this protein decomposes. In the sea this break-
down proceeds approximately as folIows: protein-e-amino acids-e-urea-e-am-
monia-e-nitrite-e-nitrate. The nitrogen content of surface waters varies con-
siderably, depending on biological conditions. In evaporites only ammonium ions
are noted, comprising up to 16.9% gft in carnallite. Evidently in the concen-
trated brine, oxygen is insufficient to oxidize the ammonia further.
On land nitrate occurs in many places in small amounts as saltpeter, NaNOa.
This is formed during the bacterial decomposition of organic matter. In the case
of the very extensive Chilean nitrate deposits, numerous origins have been
suggested, including derivation from volcanic exhalations, wind-blown sea water
droplets, decomposition of nitrogenous organic matter, and even electrical
discharges in the atmosphere. A fully satisfactory explanation has not been
offered as yet.

Structures and Textures of Biogenie and Chemical Sediments

These chemically and chemical-biogenically deposited rocks are usually
bedded like the clastic rocks. Here also the bedding is due to changes in sedi-
mentation conditions. In evaporite deposits "annual rings", thin anhydrite
laminae interspersed in rock salt, occur which result probably from periodie
influx of and deposition from sea water. In a similar manner inorganic limestone
laminae can form in shale beds. In the case of biological sediments, variations
can result from changes in the living conditions of organisms, for example, eli-
matic changes. Thus clastic and calcereous or siliceous deposits can follow one
another. Organogenic depositional structures can form from encrustations of
lime-forming organisms, especially algae. We have already mentioned the for-
mation of calcareous and iron hydroxide ooids. Macroscopically the true ooids
are very similar in appearance and origin to the pseudo-ooide. The latter are
recognizable by revealing small rock fragments, usually coated with thin crusts.
In addition to calcite, aragonite, dolomite, siderite, barite, phosphorite, opal, and
chalcedony have been described as forming ooids. Ooid-like forms certainly can
form also in muds as concretions, subsequent to sedimentation. This brings us
finally to the oft-mentioned transformation of rocks, that is, to metamorphism
(gr. meta, over again; morphe, form).
19·

IX. Metamorphie Petrogenesis
1. Types 01 Metamorphism
We include under metamorphism all those changes which affect a rock
through reaotions which preserve solid phases at least partially. We exclude
weathering processes on the one hand and complete remelting on the other.
Such transformations can occur through changes in temperature and pressure
alone. Load pressure, resulting from the superposition of later-formed rocks, is
sufficient to accomplish metamorphism. Under normal conditions in the upper
layers of the earth a geothermal gradient of about 3
0 per 100meters exists along
with a hydrostatic (" lithostatic") pressure of about 27 kg/cm2• Rock trans-
formations under such P-T conditions result in load metamorphism or sub-
sidence metarrwrphism.

Fig. 363. Temperature and pressure distribution in the earth to a depth of 500 km. (Mter
MAcDoNALD, 1964)
The geothermal gradient varies from place to place and in addition decreases
in general with increasing depth. It is steeper beneath the continents than beneath
the ocean basins. Thus, theoretically it is possible to propose different geothermal
gradients, depending on assumptions relative to the earth's thermal history and
internal composition. Fig.363 shows the temperature distribution proposed by
MACDoNALD (1964), which was calculated, based on a uranium content (heat
producing element) of 3.3 . 10-6% for the earth's mantle. Pressure distribution
beneath the continents, according to BULLEN, is given on the left of Fig. 363.
Locally in the vicinity of magma bodies, the temperature gradient rises
significantly. If this results in localized temperature effects on rocks, we speak
of contact metamorphism. Under these conditions, therefore, we have a steep

temperature gradient and relatively low load pressure. Extensive rock trans-
formations over wide areas give rise to regional metamorphism. In this case low
temperature gradients and high load pressures are characteristic. Subsidence to
great depths is frequently coupled with mountain building (tectonic) processes.
During tectonism characteristic rock fabrics develop and the rocks may be
plastically deformed. Therefore, deformed rocks, earlier called crystalline schists
(Schiefer), usually result during regional metamorphism.
In order to describe the processes which produce metamorphism, we shall
distinguish between changes which are linked with gross movements of solid
material and those which are not. Webegin with transformation processes devoid
of rock movement, which are static and involve only recrystallization. If the
original mineral phases persist, we speak of isophase recrystallization. If the
original phases react to form new phases, this is allophase recrystallization. In
both cases the chemical constituents remain the same, The change is isochemical.
If material is introduced the change is called allochemical. We shall discuss
first the processes of recrystallization, then mechanical deformation and finally
their combined roles.
2. Chemical Processes in Metamorphism
a) Isoehemical Metamorphism
Fundamentals
Diagenesis. The transformation of rocks begins in the case of sediments
immediately after deposition. The consolidation of a loose calcareous mud into
asolid limestone is one of those processes which does not differ basically from a
metamorphie process. However, such a rock is not referred to in general usage
as a metamorphie, but rather as a sedimentary rock. The processes involved,
for example, in the consolidation of sediments or the formation of concretions,
and for that matter all processes which do not require high temperature or
pressure, are usually separated from metamorphie processes under the term
diagenesis. It is difficult to draw a sharp boundary between diagenetic and meta-
morphic processes, because those minerals which might be diagnostic are ex-
ceptionally difficult to discover (see zeolite facies , p. 303). There is not much to
be gained, however, by coining a new term, such as anchimetamorphism, which is
sometimes used to define an intermediate stage. Rock transformations depend
in addition not only on pressure and temperature, but also on the nature of the
rock. For example, evaporites undergo significant change at very low tempera-
tures. Since what matters to us here is to establish the determining factors in
metamorphism, we shall deal with diagenesis and metamorphism together, in
order to avoid repetition.
Isophase Recrystallization. Weshall discuss in the following section those
processes which lead to crystallization of rocks, and consider first a loose cal-
careous mud which is saturated with water. In such a mixture, first of all, the
solubility is different for different constituents. Aragonite and Mg-rich calcite
have a higher solubility than calcite. In addition there is a noticeable effect of
grain size on solubility. If the pore solution is saturated with respect to very
small particles, it is supersaturated for large ones. The large particles thus grow
at the expense of the smaller ones.
When the small particles are used up, during recrystallization, further pre-
cipitation of calcium carbonate can take place with further filling in of the pore

294
Metamorphic Petrogenesis
space. This can occur if the pore solution undergoes concentration ohanges. We
have seen (p.266) that a temperature increase or lowering of pressure leads to
precipitation of caloium carbonate. Temperature decreases and pressure inoreases
lead to its dissolution. Such changes can be induced by geologic factors such as
elevation above the water level, subsidence to greater depth, and the opening
up of joints and cracks, to mention only a few. As a result of dissolution, small
carbonate particles disappear faster than large ones for purely geometric reasons.
This process along with the greater solubility of very small particles leads to a
genoral increase in grain size. This can be confirmed by observation, by noting
that .even in strongly reorystallized limestones, large fossil shells are preserved,
whereas the smaller ones or smaller fragments have been dissolved.
As a result of these processes the loose sedimentary particles are compacted
together, However, the amount of carbonate in solution is probablyinsufficient
to change, for example, a calcareous mud with 50 % pore volume into a dense
limestone. This requires the influence of a third factor in
recrystallization,
differential pressure. A porous rock is compressed as a result of the superimposi-
tion of later deposited sediments. Nurnerous crystals or crystal aggregates are
formed which support the fabric and the imposed load and thus are subjected to
differential pressure from above. Other crystals will be surrounded hydrostati-
cally by pore water and, therefore, subjected only to hydrostatic pressure. A
crystal under differential excess pressure, that is to say, under stress, is more
soluble. Therefore, those crystals not under stress must grow at the expense of
the streased ones. The same principle applies in the precipitation of minerals in
cavities or vugs, where material is dissolved from the enclosing rock. This prin-
ciple bears the name of the Göttingen physicist, RIED. The same formula applies
here as to growth under differential pressure (see p. 244).
In the ease of recrystallization of calcium carbonate, an example of isophase
metamorphism, a solid rock forms gradually at low temperature and pressure
from a loose material. With a further increase in temperature, as in the vicinity
of a magmatic body, the grain size increase continues, with the formation of
marble as a contact product. Marble owes its translucent warm tone to its coarse
grained calcite texture.
Calcareous sandstones behave in similar fashion to pure carbonate chalk.
In the case of pure quartz sandstone, secondary quartz will precipitate out
forming oriented overgrowths around original sand grains. The resulting rock
is a quartzite. In the case of the so-called Tertiary quartzites, the cementing
silica has been supplied from external sources. lf the silica, as in this case, pre-
cipitates out only as a groundmass or matrix, the process is called silicification.
In other cases the Si02 can be derived by pressure solution. The argillaceous
matrix of other sandstones is mostly not diagenetic in origin, but occurs as fine-
grained material introduced mechanically during sedimentation. Under pressure
of the overlying rocks, such sands oan also develop a certain compactness, in
much the same way as a pharmacist formulates pills by compaction.
In the organie siliceous sediments, colloidal ohemieal processes augment the
dissolution and reprecipitation phenomena. The silica not only goes into true
solution, but the water-deficient gel which constitutes the organie siliceous
skeletons can be peptized, that is, converted to a sol. This happens espeoially in
weakly alkaline solutions such as form by NH3 formation during the breakdown
of organic compounds in the absence of oxygen.
Allophase Recrystallization. We have until now considered only precipitation
and dissolution processes. Increases in temperature and pressure ean induce
sedimentary precipitated minerals to react with one another also. Such allophase

Isochemical Metamorphism
295
metamorphism is observed following very slight temperature rises in evaporite
deposits.
As a model , which is suitable for lecture demonstrations, we shall use the
reaction :
NaCIOs+ KCI-+NaCI + KCIOs'
In aqueous solution at room temperature (20°C) this reaction always proceeds
to the right. It is clear that it proceeds in the direction of products of least solu-
bility. The product of the solubility product constants on the left side is greater
than on the right. This reaction can readily be followed microscopically by
adding water to some small crystals of KOI and NaOlOa• The newly formed
rhombohedron-like monoclinic crystals of KOlOa can be recognized immediately
by their birefringence.
Solubility relationships, and thus the reaction direction, are dependent upon
temperature. Thus, such areaction may proceed in one direction below a certain
temperature and in the opposite direction above it. Thus, in the case of the
following reaction,
2 kainite
+
carnallite~ 2 kieserite
+ 3 sylvite + solution
2(KCI · MgSO,) ·2.75 HsO+KCI ·MgCIs'6Hs0-+2(MgSO, . HsO) + 3KCI+MgCIs+ 9.5HsO
it proceeds to the right above 76°, to the left below this temperature. For a long
time it has been assumed that in experimental work we can substitute a higher
temperature to compensate for the long times involved in natural chemical
reactions. Reactions such as those described above demonstrate that this notion
is false.
The Wollastonite Phase Diagram. Silicates also can form at low temperatures.
As examples we can cite the small albite and K -feldspar crystals found in lime-
stones and marls, such as those of the Muschelkalk of central Germany. These
two minerals can be distinguished from their higher temperature equivalents by
their optical properties (optic angle). Usually, however, neoformation of silicates
is brought about at much higher temperatures.
Aseries of reactions, of great importance in clarifying isochemical recrystalli-
zation of silicates, has been investigated experimentally in the last 20 years. This
has been made possible by the production of apparatus capable of maintaining
high temperatures and pressures. We shall consider an example, based on cal-
culations by V. M. GOLDSCHMIDT in 1912, utilizing an approximate form of the
Nernst heat law. This is the reaction :
calcite + quartz ~wollastonite + carbon dioxide
CaCOs+ SiOs
~
CaSiOs
+ COs
In spite of the apparent simplicity of this particular reaction, it serves to illus-
trate many things about such reactions.
Ourve 1 of Fig. 364 is the equilibrium curve calculated by GOLDSCHMIDT in
1912. Curve 2 was determined experimentally by HARKER and TUTTLE in 1952.
Curve 3, calculated from new thermodynamic data by DANIELSSON in 1956, lies
about as far to the left of the experimental curve as GOLDSCHMIDT'S curve is to
the right. The three curves give a distinct impression of the extent of deviation
between calculation and experiment.
What does such a curve (2) indicate to us 1 We remember from the phase rule
that P+F = B +2. In this system we have four phases. Three are solid, quartz,
calcite and wollastonite; one is agas, 002' We have three independent compo-
nents: OaO, Si02 and 0°2, and, therefore, one degree of freedom. If we choose a

temperature at which all four phases are in equilibrium, this fixes the pressure,
and vice versa. The curve represents these fixed temperatures and pressures.
Therefore, it is called a univariant curve. For all temperatures and pressures
which are not dependent on one another, and which, therefore, do not lie on the
curve, we have two degrees of freedom. The univariant curve thus separates two
divariant fields, in which three phases are stable. On the left, at low temperatures
and pressures, we always have quartz
and calcite and in addition one of the
other phases, wollastonite or 0°2, On the
right we always have wollastonite and
002 and either quartz or calcite. There-
fore, if we find quartz and calcite in a
rock, P - T conditions to the left of the
univariant curve have prevailed. When
we find wollastonite with quartz, or with
ealcite, the rock must have formed at
temperatures and pressures to the right
of the curve.
Our considerations up to now have
assumed that the 002-pressure is equal
to the total pressure in the system. This
is also true of many other reactions
investigated experimentally. Thus, cur-
ves 1-3
of
Fig. 364
apply only to
closed systems. If, in an open system,
all 002 can esoape, conditions are then
defined by curve 4, which was calculated
Fig. 364. Temperature-presaure curves for
by BARTH after the expanded Olaueias-
the wollastonite reaction
•
Olapeyron equation (see p. 191). Natural
conditions
are
certainly
intermediate
between these two extremes. BARTH suggests that wollastonite formation takes
place usually in a region somewhat to the right of curve 4. In addition, we must
in many eases keep in mind that water is also present in the system. In these
cases the H20: 002ratio plays a role . In such a ease the equilibrium curve would
also fall between curves 2 and 4 (GREENWOOD, 1962). It is to be noted in addition
that impurities, for example, Mg- or Fe-content, would cause the system no
longer to be univariant. That is to say, it would possess more than one degree
of freedom.
Our diagram does establish that Ü, at constant temperature, we move in the
direction of higher pressure, the reaction proceeds so that the volume of the
system becomes smaller, in this oase at the expense of 0°2. On the other hand,
when the pressure deereases, a volume inorease is favored. This regular relation-
ship is called the volume rule. If we hold the pressure constant, those phases form
which upon a temperature inorease take up heat upon reacting. With a tempera-
ture decrease those phases form which liberate heat. If we change both the
temperature and pressure, we must rely on the N ernst temperature rule to predict the
reaction direction. In order to illustrate the ohemical relationships, we utilize an
equilateral composition triangle such as that shown in Fig.365, in which the
mole percent of constituents is indicated, On the vertical dashed line the eom-
positions of some starting materials are indioated (points a, b, c), If an assem-
blage with the composition a is heated under pressure, the composition is driven
toward a', forming wollastonite+quartz+ 0°2. A mixture with the compo-

priate compositional join those minerals which can occur together as a result of
metamorphic processes.

Reactions in the Solid State. We generally imagine such transformations as
being accompanied by the formation of a melt or assisted by interstitial fluids,
water or water vapor present in the rock. We imagine that transformations take
place in the presence of a fluid or gaseous phase until gradually the entire rock is
transformed. Thus, at any instant, only a small segment of the rock is under-
going reaction. This action on the part of fluids is not at all necessary. We know
today that crystals can react with one another in the solid state in the absence
of fluids. Such reactions are exemplified,
for example, by unmixing upon cooling
as mentioned earlier on page 197. The
rate of these solid state transformations
depends, in addition
to temperature,
on the perfection of a crystal structure.
~e~rature
The more defective a lattice (see p. 94), ---------------
the more rapidly the solid state reaction
proceeds. Lattice defects can be induced
also
by
mechanical
stress.
Thus, in
deformed rocks the components react
more easily than in unstressed ones. The
significance of solid state reactions must, however, not be overemphasized.
Diffusion occurs only above a certain threshold temperature and then the reaction
rate is still very low. As an example, Table 64 gives some data from JAGITSCH
(1949), who investigated the reaction of soda with metakaolinite. It is very
improbable that extensive rock complexes can be diffused by reaction in the
solid state.
Pore Films and Pore Melts. In unconsolidated sediments a large pore volume
is characteristic. It diminishes with increasing consolidation, but even in rocks

298
Metamorphic Petrogenesis
which appear dry, a very thin pore film of fluid can be present in which ions can
migrate by diffusion. With rising temperature, more and more dissolved material
can be taken up in the film. This can lead to the formation of partial melts which
can themselves migrate under certain conditions.
Facies Classüication
The Zonal Concept. Transformations in an isochemical system depend on the
temperature and pressure to which the system has been subjected. Thus, BEeKE
in 1903 distinguished between rocks near the earth's surface, subjected to mild
metamorphism and those at depth which were strongly transformed. He suggested
as characteristic typomorphic minerals of the deeper zone , the minerals pyroxene,
garnet, biotite, Ca-rich plagioclase, orthoclase, sillimanite, cordierite, and olivine;
for the upper zone , zoisite-epidote, muscovite, chlorite, albite, antigorite, and
chloritoid. Later GRUBENMANN inserted an intermediate stage, distinguishing
three zones of increasing temperature and pressure, which he called the epizone,
mesozone, and katazone. This terminology is still used in Germany today.
BARROW (1893), and later TILLEY in Scotland, introduced another type of
zonation indicator. They utilized a concept of index minerals to characterize
the metamorphism of pelitic sediments. Their progression begins with a chlorite
zone, with the index mineral chlorite representing the lowest grade of meta-
morphism, With progressively increasing metamorphism, the biotite-, almandine-,
staurolite-, and kyanite-zones follow. Metamorphism reaches its highest intensity
or grade with the sillimanite zone, One can thus characterize mineral associations
of like conditions of formation.
Definition 01 Mineral Facies. A further kind of classification of metamorphic
rocks was suggested by ESKOLA (1915). He started from the premise that rocks
having the same bulk chemical composition when in equilibrium, as indicated
by the Phase Rule (see p. 193), must under like conditions form the same mineral
associations. If the chemical composition changes, so must the mineral content
in accordance with theoretical principles. Such mineral-assemblages ESKOLA
called [acies, an expression which had common usage for a long time in geology
(GRESSLY, 1838) for classification of rock and fossil associations. His definition
of mineral facies (1939) is as follows: "A particular facies comprises all rocks
which, by virtue of identical bulk composition, exhibit identical mineralogical
composition. The mineral composition will vary with bulk chemical composition
according to systematic rules. The significance of this principle is based on the
observation that the mineral paragenesis of metamorphic rocks conforms in
many cases to the laws of chemical equilibrium. This definition of facies , however,
carries with it no assumption that chemical equilibrium prevails."
Since its introduction, the facies concept has been discussed by many workers
and expounded in different ways. The most recent redefinition has been given
by FYFE and TURNER (1966) as follows: "A metamorphic facies is one of a suo-
cession of metamorphic mineral associations, which are linked together repeatedly
in space and time, so that a constant and predictable correspondence exists
between the mineral composition of each rock and its bulk chemical composition. "
There have been in addition further commentaries on metamorphic facies. Follow-
ing the precedent of ESKOLA, the various facies are named after the characteristic
rocks which form them, for example, the greenschist facies . However, different
rocks are grouped together under one facies according to the nature of the parent
rock. If we want to use the facies classification for classifying metamorphic
rocks, we must make an exceptionally large number of subdivisions. For the

Isochemical Metamorphism
299
c1assification of metamorphie rocks, mineral composition and fabric should be
considered as well as chemistry. The gross chemical composition of a meta-
morphic rock, which we can determine, does not necessarily represent the exact
composition of the parent rock. Therefore, the facies concept asserts nothing
about the original parent material and does not take into account subsequent
metasomatism. These must be inferred from the chemistry, the fabric, and field

culated by FYFE for kyanite-andalusite (E) andalusite-sillimanite (with range of error)
(F, F'), kyanite-sillimanite (0)
observations. Nor does the facies concept presume that a mineral association is
always in equilibrium. It only implies that under certain geologie conditions the
same mineral transformations occur in response to the same chemical factors.
Thus, it is noteworthy that metastable phases frequently form outside of their
stability fields in nature. Examples are aragonite and gypsum (among the earbon-
ates and sulfates) and diamond. It is generally assumed that this is not the case
with silicate formation. Metastability of silicates is encountered, however, as a
result of retrograde metamorphism (see p. 305). In addition, one must keep in
mind that in experimental studies of metamorphism only a limited number of
components can be considered simultaneously. The equilibrium situation can be
altered (see p. 296) as a result of additional components. It also follows from these
limitations that there exists a continuous gradation between facies. Experimen-
tally determined univariant equilibrium curves can be used only with caution.
Therefore, in Fig. 366, which gives a summary of the entire metamorphie domain,
facies boundaries are not drawn in. The curves indicated in Fig. 366 indicate the

300

calculated stability fields for kyanite (left) and andalusite (below) and sillimanite
(right), with the latitude of error for each curve indicated (double curves). On
the same P - T scale, the same and some additional important equilibria are
indicated in Figs. 367. It is opportune again to emphasize (see p. 296) that the
partial pressures of the appropriate gases, such as H20 and CO2 , must be con-
sidered. In Fig. 366 and 367 these are always considered to be equivalent to the
total rock pressure.

Construction 01 ACF and A'KF Diagrams. In order to represent diagrammati-
cally the mineral associations of different faeies, triangular diagrams of the kind
illustrated in Fig. 365 are usually used. Since only three components can be
represented, it is necessary to greatly simplify compositional representations of
most naturally occurring rocks.
A representation called the ACF diagram,
suggested by ESKOLA, is usually used to represent rock composition. Si02 is not
represented graphically because it is present in excess in many rocks and thus
has no influence on the mineral asaemblages. In addition the accessory components
H 20 and CO2 are ignored. One corner of the triangle, A, represents the molecular
proportions (see p. 217) of Al20S+Fe 20S not combined with Na or K (A120S+
Fe 20S -
[Na20+K 20] = A). C represents the molecular proportion of CaO, not

including that bound in apatite. F represents MgO+ MnO+ FeO, excluding the
amounts of these tied up in biotite if present. These values are recalculated so
that A +0 +F = 100% and are thus expressed as molecular percentages.
In addition, a so-called A'KF diagram can be used to represent the K 20
content of a metamorphic rock. In this case K 20 takes the place of CaO in the

AOF diagram. A' used in this representation need not be identical to A in the
AOF diagram. One can, of course, carry out these calculations only if the per-
centage mineral composition is known. If muscovite (Al20a:K 20 = 3: 1) is present,
as is often the case, one substracts from A in constructing an AOF diagram three
times as much Al20a as there is K 20 in muscovite. In the case of A'KF diagrams
on the other hand, only 1K 20 is omitted in addition to CaO. Also in the case of
CaO, only that amount of CaO should be substracted which corresponds to the
normal or actual Ca-minerals present. This would correspond to all of the CaO in
anorthite (CaO:Al20a= 1), to l/a CaO in grossularite, etc. Thus, we must know
the quantitative mineral content in order to construct these diagrams and cannot
work with the bulk chemical analysis alone. For detailed discussion of all aspects
of these calculations, we must refer to special references such as that by WINKLER
(1965).
The facies classification of metamorphic rocks has been expanded signifi-
cantly and refined during the course of the last two decades. This has been
the result of extensive field and petrographic work, as well as experimental work
in the laboratory. To bring the two approaches into agreement is an important
research objective. Here it is possible only to introduce the subject of facies in-
vestigations.
Contact Mctamorphic Faeies, As mentioned earlier, the confining pressure is
low during contact metamorphism. With progressively rising temperature, we
encounter the albite-epidote-homfels-, the hornblende-hornfels-, and the pyroxene-
hornfels-facies. The expression " hornfels" comes from the horny translucent
appearance frequently exhibited on thin edges of unaltered rock.
The mineral combinations of the albite-epidote-hornfels facies are illustrated
in Fig. 368. In this diagram the extent of solid solution is indicated by the heavy
lines and by a circular field in the case of biotite.

Characteristic mineral assemblages are epidote+ calcite, tremolite+ calcite,
epidote+albite (not indicated in Fig. 368) -l-chlorite and

Its absence may be explained by the fact that many sedimentary clays have
sufficient potassium present to form muscovite instead.

At higher temperature, muscovite+ quartz reacts to form K -feldspar+ anda-
lusite+H 20. Andalusite first forms in the albite-epidote-hornfels facies. Silli-
manite takes its place at higher temperatures.
In the hornblende-hornfels facies we find hornblende and anthophyllite in
place of chlorite, and plagioclase instead of albite. Epidote is missing. Garnets
with the composition grossularite-andradite occur, as weH as diopside and the
combinations muscovite+ andalusite and muscovite+cordierite.
In the pyroxene-hornfels facies, whose mineral combinations are illustrated
in Fig. 369, enstatite or hypersthene replace hornblende. It is characteristic that
muscovite is replaced now by orthoclase+sillimanite, accompanied still by
andalusite. Cordierite+orthoclase is likewise a diagnostic combination.
Even before the introduction of the facies concept, V. M. GOLDSCHMIDT (1911)
had established 10 classes of hornfels from the Oslo region. Classes 1-10, which
represent increasing CaO content, show especially well the accompanying parallel
changes in mineral association. The progressive changes in mineralogy are indi-
cated in Table 65, omitting quartz and orthoclase, which are common to all
10 classes. In naming these classes the minerals indicated in italies are used,
ignoring the persistent biotite. For example, class 7 represents plagioclase-
diopside hornfels. The italicized minerals of Table 65, with the exception of
vesuvianite, are represented in the ACF diagram in Fig. 369 as follows.
Class 1, andalusite+cordierite; class 2, andalusite+plagioclase+ cordierite,
etc. If we neglect in class 1 the albite, which was obtained by calculating the

Isochemical Metamorphism
303
norm and would be better represented
as a constituent of plagioclase, we see
that all of the Goldschmidt classes are
included within the pyroxene-hornfels
facies , since hornblende does not occur
in these rocks. The Goldschmidt classifi-
cation can be considered as an example
of sub-division of a facies depending upon
the parent rocks.
The sanidinite [acies is rare. It occurs
as inclusions in lavas and dikes near
to the surface and directly in contact
with magma . The diagnostic mineral is
sanidine. In
addition tridymite, mul-
lite,
monticellite, melilite, and larnite
(ß·Ca2Si04) and often glass are found in
association.
Regional Metamorphie Faeies. We in-
clude here all of the transformationswhich
take place isochemically over a wide
area. Some workers suggest separating
from regional metamorphism the load or
subsidence metamorphism, during which
the temperature increase is less and
more gradual. However, it is disputed
whether a definite separation is feasible
at the present time. On the other hand,
there are also gradations between con-
tact metamorphic processes, involving
more rapid temperature rise, and granite
formation, which will be treated later
(see p. 321).
Diagenesis certainly is apart of load
or subsidence metamorphism. Mineral
neoformation, for example, formation of
alkali feldspar and chlorite, is observed
in conjunction with diagenesis. Poorly

takes the plaee of laumontite. Analeite belongs as apart of diagenesis. In
Fig. 367, eurve A represents its transformation to albite by the reaetion, anal-
eite + quartz ~albite+H20.
Aeeording to occurrences reported to date, it seems as Ü the zeolite facies is
eonnected with the presence ofloose voleanic material, espeeiallyglass, in sediments.
This explains why this faeies is so uneommon. In mostinstances, in which only dia-
genetie changes are established, sediments transform direetly to the next highest
grade of regional metamorphism, into the greenschist or glaueophaneschist facies.
The glaucophane-law8onite [acies represents an extended development of the
zeolite facies at high pressure and temperature. WINKLER (1965) distinguishes
two subfaeies, the lawsonite-glaueophane- and the Iawsonite-albite-faeies.
According to WINKLER, the Na-amphibole, glaueophane, is not characterisitc.
It occurs also in a high pressure greenschist facies. AB Fig.366 has indicated,
transition is expected between the glaucophane and greenschist facies. The
mineral lawsonite, CaAl2[(OH)2Si207] . H20, is diagnostic. It is noteworthy,
in addition, that in this facies in some places aragonite, and in others calcite, is
found. From this the conclusion is drawn that in these instances aragonite has
formed within its stability field, with T and P oseillating around the phase
boundary calcite-aragonite, running from 100°C and 7,000 km/cm2 to 500°C and
12,000 kg/em2, as indicated by curve 0 of Fig. 367. Aragonite, to be sure, also
forms outside of its stability field, as in reeent sediments, and persists meta-
stably over geologic time spans.
At somewhat higher temperatures and at the same or lower pressures the
next or greenschist facies follows. In eontrast to the preceding facies, it is ex-
ceptionally widely distributed. Three subfacies can be distinguished:
a) quartz-albite-muscovite-chlorite,
b) quartz-albite-epidote-biotite,
c) quartz-albite-epidote-almandine.
Additional characteristic minerals are stilpnomelane or chloritoid. In the
lowest temperature subfacies a, the Mn-garnet spessartite can form in manganese
rich sediments. The subfacies c corresponds to the highest temperature portion
of ESKOLA'S epidote-amphibolite facies.
At still higher temperature the almandine-amphibolite [aciee follows, which can
be divided into the following sub-facies :
a) staurolite-almandine,
b) kyanite-almandine-muscovite,
c) sillimanite-almandine-museovite,
d) sillimanite-almandine-orthoclaae.
In 1966, FYFE and TuRNER introduced again ESKOLA'S albite-epidote-amphi-
bolite and amphibolite facies. With modern methods of investigation, actinolite,
belonging to the greenschist facies, can be readily distinguished from horn-
blende, which oeeurs only in the albite-epidote-amphibolite facies. Since amphi-
bolites without almandine are widely distributed, they have omitted almandine
from the facies name.
Two subfacies can be distinguished in the granulite facies, hornblende-granulite
and pyroxene-granulite. By granulite we mean a rock which carries pyrope-alman-
dine garnet, as weIl as quartz and feldspar. The pyroxene is usually hypersthene.

Allochemical Recrystallization. Metasomatism
305
The eclogite facies is defined by the mineral assoeiation omphacite (a green,
iron-bearing pyroxene) and garnet (pyrope-almandine-grossularite solid solutions),
which almost exclusively make up the eclogites. Some kyanite and enstatite, as
well as rutile, are often present. Although the origin of eclogites is controversial,
most certainly they are formed at high pressures. In contrast to the other facies,
the eclogite facies consists of essentially one mineral association. All eclogitic
rocks which we observe at the surface are probably not always of the same origin,
Since eclogites have approximately the same composition as gabbros, it is fre-
quently assumed that the earth's mantle consists of eclogite . Upon release of
pressure in the mantle, basaltic melts could form from eclogite . The occurrence
of eclogite inclusions in kimberlites speaks for the presence of eclogite in the
earth's mantle. Since kimberlites contain diamonds, it is assummed that they
also stem from great depth. Eclogite inclusions are exceedingly rare in normal
basalts, in contrast to the wide distribution of olivine inclusions in them.
Retrograde Metamorphism
If a rock adjusts itself to the prevailing P - T conditions, according to the
principal supposition behind the facies classification, then the question arises as
to how we have any knowledge of rocks which formed at high temperatures and
pressures. Why have these rocks not adjusted to the P-T conditions at the
earth's surface where we observe them i The reason is that quite generally reao-
tions proceed much more rapidly with rising temperature and thus are inhibited
as the temperature is lowered. In addition, metamorphic reactions take place
with the assistance of volatile constituents, especially water. Usually these are
expelled from a rock at high temperature. Where they are reintroduced, we
observe the transformation of rocks back to lower facies. We call this retro-
gression retrograde metamorphism (HARKER) or diaphthoresis (BEeKE). Such rocks
are called diaphthorites. Mechanical stress promotes recrystallization not only
with rising, but also deereasing temperature. Therefore, mica schists can become
phyllitic as a result of mylonitization (phyllonites) .
From these considerations it follows that when a rock, during the course of
its history, is subjected to several facies grades, that grade corresponding to the
highest temperature persists if there has been no introduction of volatile eon-
stituents, especially water or CO2 • Whether this has been the case is not always
easy to recognize. Moreover, it must always be realized that retrograde meta-
morphism is not confined to isochemical processes.
b) Allochemical Recrystallization. Metasomatism
General. Up to now we have considered only those processes for which the
gross chemieal composition of a rock remains constant. We have not considered
the whole story when we noted that volatile constituents, H 20 and CO2 , in many
cases are expelled from a rock complex. These hot gases and solutions can carry
ions in solution and affect mineral neoformation along their paths. If they enter
fissures they may form vein deposits. We must realize also that the entire country
rock may be altered. This possibility in the case of silicate rocks is at the present
time perhaps too often overlooked. The importance of metasomatism in the
origin of mineral deposits has been recognized for a very long time. We distinguish
between impregnation deposits, in which new material was preoipitated in the
rock pores, and metasomatic or replacement deposits, in which the original rock
was replaced.

Metamorphic Petrogenesis
The more permeable a rock , the more readily can a solution penetrate it.
Therefore, we very often find metasomatic phenomena associated with diagenesis.
Especially common in this respect is dolomitization and silicification.
Dolomitization. We have seen earlier (p.271) that primary dolomitization
cannot take place in normal sea water. Investigations of the solution equilibria
of Ca and Mg carbonates, sulfates, and chlorides (USDOWSKI, 1966) show that
Ca-carbonate is not in equilibrium with sea water, but must transform to Ca-Mg
carbonate in its presence. Because of the reaction kinetics, however, conversion
takes place only when the sea water is concentrated by evaporation. In addition,
because of the low reaction rate, this solution must remain for a long time in
contact with the Ca-carbonate. This process can be represented schematically by
means of the following experimentally established reaction in aqueous solution :
4CaC03+ MgCl2+ MgS04 ~2CaMg(C03)2+ CaCl2+ CaS04.
By means of this reaction, as weIl as the experimentally established reaction :

2CaMg(C03)2+ MgCl2+ MgS04~4MgC03+ CaCl2+ CaS04,
it is possible to interpret genetically the mineral assemblages of recent dolomitic
sediments. In these equations we would substitute the minerals aragonite, Mg-
calcite, calcite, protodolomite (strongly disordered dolomite), dolomite, hydro-
magnesite, magnesite, gypsum, and an-
hydrite. Of these aragonite, Mg-calcite ,
protodolomite, and hydromagnesite are
unstable. They transform in the course
of time into the stable minerals calcite,
dolomite, and magnesite . Therefore, we
have here a sort of metasomatic activity
even at sea water temperatures and are
justified in assuming that such processes
were effective also in the geologic past.
In addition to these early diagenetically
formed dolomites, dolomitization of solid
limestone rocks has occurred after de-
position by the action of groundwater
circulating in the crust. Analyses of such
solutions show that they are so con-
stituted that they can be in equilibrium
with dolomite. If these
solutions en-
counter Iimestone, areaction must occur
Fig. 370. Solubility of Si02-gel and calcite
in water
analogous to the first reaction above,
leading to the formation of dolomite.
Dolomite occurs also with magnesite, the
latter forming by reaction with pore solutions according to the second reaction.
This process occurs less frequently than the dolomitization of limestone, since the
latter is much more common than magnesites.
Silicification.
Another
common
phenomenon,
silicification,
begins
with
certainty during very early diagenesis. Even on the present day sea floor of the
Pacific Ocean, silicification has been described.
Fig. 370 shows the solubility relations of silica gel and CaCOa as related to pH.
These data can serve as a model to describe the processes of silicification and
replacement of calcium carbonate by Si02 • As an example, let us consider a
solution with very low Si02 and CaCOa content at a pH of about 6.5 (Field III).

Allochemical Recrystallization. Metasomatiam
307
We shall imagine it permeating a limestone containing Si0 2 in the form of sili-
ceous organic remains. At first Si02 and CaCOa are dissolved from the rock, but
when field I is reached, Si0 2 precipitates, although CaCOa continues to dissolve.
Another solution with a pH of about 8.5 cuts the solubility curve of CaCOa
before that of Si0 2. In this case Si0 2continues to dissolve, as CaCOa precipitates.
One can easily follow what happens, when solutions which are already saturated
with Si0 2 or CaCOa are active. The results of both processes have been observed.

Silicification, the replacement of calcium carbonatc by silica, is especially wide-
spread. An example is illustrated in Fig. 371. This can result also from solutions
introduced from outside the rock. One can represent such a process schematically
by the following equations :
1. Na2SiOa + [CaCOa] + 2H2COa + H20 ~ 2 NaOH + Ca(HCOa)2 + [Si02]:
[Si02] is dissolved, CaCOa precipitated.
2. Na2SiOa+ [CaCOa] + 4H2COa---,)-2NaHCOa+ Ca(HCOa)2+ [Si02]+H20 +
H2COa: [CaCOa] is dissolvcd, Si02 precipitated.
In addition we must assume that colloidal Si0 2 solutions circulate within
rocks and can precipitate out at alkaline reaction sites. Pure Si02-sols have
their maximum resistance to flocculation by cations in the weakly alkaline region.
Such flocculation probably
explains the siliceous rings, first described
by
L. V. B UCH in 1831.
Kaolinization. Weathering processes and hydrothermal metasomatism lead
to kaolinization, which we can describe by the following equation:
2KA lSiaOs+2H 20 = AI2(OH)4 [SiaOs]+K 20 +4 SiOa.

kaolinite

Metamorphie Petrogenesis
It is always likely that acids, at least carbonic acid, are involved in this trans-
formation. While in the case of very dilute solutions, such as those formed by
weathering, the ions are transported and react only externally to the feldspar,
at higher concentrations and in more or less closed systems, the reaction takes
place within the feldspar erystal. This leads to the formation of pseudomorphs of
the kind deseribed later (p. 309).
Sericitization. Sericitization probably takes place at higher temperatures
and in an acid environment in the following manner:
3KAISi30s+ 2H+~KAI2(OH)2[Si3AIOlO]+ 2K+ + 6Si02.
K-feldspar
museovite
Sericite is the name given to finely divided muscovite.
That sericitization frequently involves more complex processes of intro-
duction of potassium is shown by the observation that sericitized plagioclase does
not contain the sodium mica, paragonite, but rather the potassium mica. In
fact, it forms in amounts much in exeess of that which could be formed from the
potassium present in the original plagioclase (PILLER, 1951). Sericitization also
yields free Si02 which can appear as newly formed quartz within the altered
roek or in its vicinity.
Serpentinization. Serpentinization may be akin also to water metasomatism.
The magnesium silicate serpentine forms from other magnesium bearing silicates
by removal of iron and probably some magnesium, as indicated by reactions such
as :
5Mg2[Si04]+4H20~2Mg3(OH)4[Si205] +4MgO + Si02
700 g forsterite
552 g serpentine
removed
218 cm''
220 cm"
Serpentinization probably can result from the reaetion of aqueous residual
solutions produced by cooling of olivine rich peridotitic magmas, that is by
autometamorphism. The above reaction scheme was selected because Si02 inclu-
sions are observed frequently in serpentine rocks. Essentially no volume change
aeeompanies this process.
Serpentine can react further with carbonic acid to give tale and magnesite
according to the seheme :

By processes which are still unknown, tale can be formed diagenetically in
gypsum rocks. In addition, it is formed by metamorphism from quartz, dolomite,
and water.
Skarn. An important metasomatic synthesis at high temperatures is the
deposition of ore minerals in limestones. These were observed especially in Sweden
and Finland and have been called skarns, following the expression of Swedish
miners. The most important minerals are andradite, hedenbergite-diopside, and
iron-rich hornblende, as well as the iron poor silicates tremolite-actinolite and
vesuvianite. Magnetite or hematite along with quartz and sulfide ores, such as
galena, sphalerite, and chalcopyrite, are mineable. Their origin is disputed.
MAGNUSSON (1966) assumes the parent material to have been sedimentary iron
ores along with limestones and dolomites that were altered by metamorphism.
The common occurrence of fluorite could indicate gaseous transport. Fluorine
contents up to 12,100 ppm and chlorine to 500 ppm have been reported.
Hydrothermal Ore Metasomatism is described frequently. We wish here only
to consider one example which serves to indicate the extent of material transfer

during metasomatism. G ILLULY (1932) estimates that at Ophir Hill, Utah, th e
following material was introdu ced into a limestone bed of 2.8 · 105 m2 lateral
extent and 18.3 m thickness : 270 .106 kg A1203 , 160 .106 kg K 20, 10 · 106 kg
Na20 , 900 . 106 kg Si0 2 , 9 . 106 kg P205' 3 . 106 kg F , and 797 .106 kg CuS, FeS2 ,
PbS, and ZnS.
Greisen. Alteration and impregnation of the country rock occurs also in the
formation of cassiterite. The altered rock is called greisen. Topaz and tourmaline
are usually formed also. The reaction usually assumed is :
SnF4 + 2H 20 = Sn0 2 + 4HF.
Alkali lUetasomatism. Frequently during metam orphism alkali migration is
observed. Examples are the replacement of microcline by albite, neoformation of
albite and potassium feldspars in schists, alteration of hornblende to biotite, etc.
A pertinent question concerns over how great a distance is such alkali migration
effective. In many cases it is indicated that an exchange is confined within a
restricted rock complex. In other cases the introduction takes place from with-
out, as with contact metamorphism by granitic or syenitic plutonic rocks. At
the contact of basaltic rocks have been observed albitized shales which have been
described as adinoles. Spotted contact rocks are called spilosites, banded ones,
desmosites.
Alkali metasomatism plays an important role in the th eory of granite forma-
tion (see p. 322).
c) Fabric 01 Recrystallized Rocks
Pseudomorphs. How do we go about establishing that rock transformations
take place ? We must proceed like a detective, evaluating all the clues. Especially
important in this respect are pseudomorphs. These are structures which retain
the outer morphology of some original crystal, but which has been altered to a new
mineral. As an example one find s in greisens, topaz crystals with the morphology
of feldspar. The process of pseudomorph form ation can best be made clear, if we
place a cleavage fragment of halite in a silver nitrate solution. If the concentration
of AgN03 is sufficient (> 3 molar) , a thin layer of tiny crystals of AgCI forms
immediately. The silver ions diffuse through this layer into the cube, the sodium
ions diffusing outward. The crystallization of AgCI continues at the inner bound-
ary of the AgCI layer and finally we obtain an exact replica of the cleavage frag-
ment replaced by fine grained silver chloride. If the concentration is not high
enough, pillow-shaped deposits occur on the crystal surface. A less than 0.5 M
solution forms many tiny AgCI crystals on the bottom of the container.
An example of pseudomorphism in a rock is illustrated in Fig. 372. In this
case the pseudomorphs subsequently were mechanically deformed.
Relies. Mineral remnants, or relics, give us the most important information
about mineral replacement. This can involve individual minerals which may
escape complete dissolution, perhaps becau se the metamorphic process was
interrupted, as we can see frequently in silicification (Fig.371). Sometimes th e
mineral is not attacked by the solution as is the case with the quartz in Fig. 372.
Also areaction rim may form around the mineral protecting the relic from further
reaction. In addition, the original fabric may remain recognizable. This brings
us to an especially important chapter on metamorphic rocks, metamorphic fabric.
When an ancient laminated clay recrystallizes, frequently one can recognize still
the original lamination (Fig. 373), in spite of complete transformation, even if
very severe recrystallization has taken place. We might conclude from the lami-

310

nations that the original clay sediment had characteristically formed in a glacial
lake (see p. 263).

Blastic Structure. The new formed structure, in contrast to the original
texture, is basically different in origin from that of a crystallized rock in which
the individual components crystallized out of their melt successively or together.
Metamorphism involves transformation of a previously solid rock. If the structural
character of the original rock is preserved, the new structure is described, using
the original structural nomenclature with the addition of the prefix, blasto.
A recrystallized conglomeratic texture is called blastopsephitic, an ancient sand-
stone, blastopsammitic, and an old porphyry, blastoporphyritic.
The Idioblastic Series. If the old structure is no longer recognizable, an
equigranular structure is called granoblastic. In this ease, as was true of igneous
rocks, some minerals exhibit characteristic morphologies, some do not. BEeRE
established the following idioblastic series in which the first-mentioned frequently
show their diagnostic crystal morphology, while the Iast-mentioned very often
do not. The series folIows :
Sphene, rutile, magnetite, hematite, ilmenite, garnet, tourmaline, staurolite,
kyanite;
Epidote, zoisite;
Augite, hornblende ;
Breunnerite [(Mg, Fe)C03 ] , dolomite, albite ;

(From BARTII-CORRENS.EsKOLA)
This does not represent, as is in the case of igneous rocks, an age or crystalli-
zation sequence. It represents the ability of a mineral to develop in opposition
to its neighbor. Therefore, we speak frequently of a "power of crystallization"
or even better of the "form energy" of a mineral. A satisfactory explanation for
this phenomenon has never been given. One can only affirm that the oxides
crystallize best and then the inosilicates. These are especially dense minerals.
Then follow the chain and ribbon struc-
tures, then those with lamellar cleavage,
and finally the framework silicates with
their relatively open structures.It should
be added that albite would appear before
mica in the series only in special cases.
It is likely that surface energy forces
play an essential role in determining
this form energy.
Porphyroblasts. Not infrequently one
observes the neoformation of large in-
dividual erystals, called porphyroblasts,
in recrystallized rocks. These crystals
have usually developed at the expense
of the fine grained groundmass, as illus-
trated in Fig. 374. Even during diagene-
sis such forms develop. Pyrite crystals
in clays and shales attain diameters of
one centimeter. Quartz crystals several
centimeters long occur in gypsum. Sphal-
erite and galena are also common dia-
genetic porphyroblasts. " Crystallized "
sandstones, in which rather large single
calcite crystals grow through and incor-
poratesand, belongin thiscategory. There
are similar occurrences of barite, gypsum, and anhydrite. In plastic clays sulfuric
acid, produced by the weathering of iron pyrite, reacts with calcium carbonate
to form gypsum. These porphyroblasts are usually devoid of inclusions. Whether
a crystal grows by engulfing its surroundings or by shoving it aside depends on
the one hand on the boundary surface tensions between solution, crystal, and the
foreign body, and on the other hand on the pressure it can impose during growth ;
these factors depend in turn on the supersaturation. In true metamorphic rocks the
growth pressure is probably never sufficient to shove aside the surrounding matrix.
Concretions. Individual crystals owe their growth to a concentration gradient
in a rock. In a supersaturated pore solution the ions diffuse to a nucleus per-
mitting growth. Sometimes a lighter colored aureole can be observed around
such crystals. During diagenesis several nuclei form at one place associated with
a concentration gradient, forming concretions. It is not necessary that the entire
solution be supersaturated. H, for example, at one place in the sediment in-
cluded organic matter gradually decomposed forming CO2 , calcium carbonate
could go into solution. At another place NHa may be produced by the anaerobic
decomposition of protein, precipitating calcium carbonate. H the limestone also
contains Si02 as opal (diatoms, sponge spicules), this may be dissolved at the
alkaline site and precipitated where acid conditions prevail (see Figs. 331 and 370).
As a result of such fluctuations in concentration of the pore solutions, silicification
can result. The formation of spottiness or mottling in diagenetic and in truly

312
Metamorphic Petrogenesis
metamorphized rocks is akin to these phenomena. In the case of rocks associated
with contact aureoles, we speak of nodular- and spoüed-slaies.
3. Rock Deformation
Fabrie of Deformed Rocks. Until now we have considered only those fabrics
developed by recrystallization, and have avoided mention of mechanical defor-
mation. We shall begin the discussion of deformation by considering the structural
properties it produces. Especially striking in metamorphic rocks is their schisto-
sity, which stems from the earlier frequently used expression, crystalline schist.
There are also metamorphosed clastic sediments, for example, in the glauco-
phane-lawsonite facies, which show no foliation or schistosity. In schists we ob-

Two large garnets (bright) and mica crystal (dark) in a groundmass of quartz, sericite and
carbonaceous matter. Schistosity of groundmass preserved within large crystals
serve that mica flakes and columnar crystals, such as hornblende, lie in parallel
planes, promoting separation or cleavage along these planes. While the orien-
tation of these crystals can be observed with the naked eye and has been known
for a long time, it has been realized only in the last decade that rocks devoid of
obvious foliation indeed have their constituents in preferred orientation. It has
been established that an apparently randomly crystallized granite exhibits up
to 15% variation in compressive strength, when measurements are made using
prisms oriented in different directions. A marble may show up to 27% variation.
The transparency of the surface layer of marble, which gives it its warm lively
tone, can depend clearly on orientation.
Description of Preferred Orientation (Foliation). How can we establish how
the constituents of a rock are oriented ? For this purpose microscope investigation
is especially important. This enables us to determine the orientation of the
indicatrix of a mineral. Alternatively, X-ray study indicates lattice reference
directions. The orientation of such directions as, for example, the optic axis of
calcite or quartz, is plotted, using an equal area azimuthal projection. This is

used in a manner similar to the stereographie proj ection, but differs from it in
that it gives true areal rather than true angular measurements. Therefore, it is
not satisfactory for angular measurements. We are more interested in this case
in establishing the statistical frequency ofaxial poles, and thus must be able to
compare equal areas. If we then express the data points in terms of projection
coordinates , and relate them to the other fabric properties, schistosity, weal
structure, etc ., we can unravel a picture of the deformation process. Fig.375,
shows a proj ection sphere with th e poles of quartz axes plotted. Along side of

like a topographie map with its contour lines. The maximum concentration of
poles lies at the center of the projection and decreases outward. Such a fabric

orthorhombic fabric, that is, a fabric with three symmetry planes. As we can see,
the precision of fit to orthorhombic symmetry is not great. The maximum at
1 should lie properly on line c-a. A diagram representing monoclinic symmetry
is shown in Fig. 377. While th e symmetry is maintained relatively weIl on the
left side of the diagram , maxima I ' and 4' do not correspond quantitatively.
A triclinie diagram is illustrated in Fig. 378.
Laminar Movement. The study of such fabrics has become very important
in tectonic considerations. From such studies has come the knowledge of the
importance of fabric study generally. Fabric studies are not only confined to all
types of rocks, but more generally extend into all areas of science. BR. SANDER
and WALTER SCHl\HDT can be singled out as pioneers in this area of investigation.
Here we shall confine ourselves to deformation fabrics of rocks and shall query
how such regular arrangements come into existence. We can demonstrate to
ourselves that the rock was made to flow. As a result of the very great viscosity
characteristic of such rock flowage, laminar flow must almost always be involved.
The higher the temperature, the more plastic the rock will become, un til finally
so much melt forms that the material flows like a fluid . In the case of actual
metamorphism we are concerned with movement in the solid state . Planes of
discontinuity occur frequently in rocks, and these fun ction as glide planes. They
may be bedding planes or planes of schistosity produced by metamorphism. The

Rock Deformation

flowage is made possible since the rock consists of lamellae which move over one
another by " lamellar" gliding. The thickness of these lamellae can be very variable,
ranging from microscopic dimensions up to meter thick bands. We have here a
deformation process which corresponds to the mode of translation in crystal
structures. This is deformation along previously formed planes.
Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Deformation. We definc adeformation as
homogeneous, when the stress so changes the rock, that a rock sphere is changed
to an ellipsoid. Thus, circular cross-sections become ellipses. Straight lines within

the rock remain as such. Only their position changes. This is illustrated by com-
paring Figs. 379 and 380, which represent a deforming rock as a stack of cards
within which homogeneous gliding takes place. An original verticalline approaches
the horizontal, the more severe the deformation. Thus, preferred crystal orien-
tation relative to the glide planes is produced.
Fig. 381 illustrates inhomogeneous deformation,
during which
originally
straight lines acquire curvature and in which a spherical surface is irregularly
deformed. As a result of such inhomogeneous deformation, fold structures can
result, as structures inclined to laminations are distorted into bent configurations.
Such fold structures are known as drag folds in contrast to the real folds produced
by bending.
Simple Shear Translation. A special case of homogeneous deformation is
simple shearing (pure shear,
HELMHOLTZ), which is identical to the pressure

twinning in crystals (see p. 102). Let us consider the deformation of a cube which
encloses a sphere, resulting from the vertical application of differential compres-
sional pressure in the direction of the c-(or aa-)axis. As a result the b-(or a2-)axis
is unaffected, the c-axis reduced in dimension, and the a (or al ) axis extended
without a change in the volume of the body. A parallelepiped is produced from
the cube, and the sphere becomes a triaxial ellipsoid (Fig.382). As we have
already mentioned previously, such an ellipsoid has two circular cross sections.
In Fig. 382, these circular sections are
shown in projection as the lines con-
necting the center of the sphere with its
points of intersection with the ellipsoid.
The difference between a crystal and a
mechanically isotropie rock, as we can
consider many rocks to be, is that in the
former the loci of the glide planes are
determined
by
the
crystal structure,
whereas in the latter case its locus de-
pends upon the applied pressure. The
more intense the plastic deformation of
the rock, the smaller the angle between
the deformation plane and the horizon-
tal. In the case of plastic deformation
these planes play only a geometrie role.
If the strength of the rock is exceeded,
fractures are formed along these planes. These are called shear or diagonal frac-
tures. If the plastic deformation is extensive enough the circular sectional planes
are made to coincide with the horizontal.
Formation of Preferred Orientation (Foliation). We want now to consider
deformation of the constituent grains of a rock. In the case of both forms of
deformation there are two kinds of possibilities that can occur. The crystal
grains can be deformed themselves by translation gliding, or they can , if they
are not spherical but columnar or tabular, be grasped in concordance with the
rock flow and reoriented. If the grains themselves are deformed, we speak of
intragranular deformation, while rotation or relative movement of the whole
grain is called intergranular deformation. The two forms together produce charac-
teristic metamorphie fabric.
When rock flowage takes place between two solid or competent boundary
layers, the resulting particle orientation develops a monoclinic orientation relative
to the direction of rock flowage . If the boundaries are irregular, the resulting
fabric is triclinie. In the case of the simple compressional deformation of the
sphere mentioned above, the deformation produces an orthorhombic fabric.
The manner in which the individual grains are deformed depends upon their
crystal structure. In the case of calcite, preferred orientation produced is the
result of simple shear translation along (10ll) and (0112). The micas are deformed
by translation on the base (001). The reader can refer to Tables 15 and 16, p. 103
and 105, concerning the properties of additional minerals.
In the case of quartz several forms of deformation fabric occur. In mylonites
and slickensides (see p. 318), the c-axes lie parallel to the direction of movement.
Other preferred orientations are observed also. Für example, orientations result
in quartz as if a rhombohedral plane has acted as a glide plane. In spite of con-
siderable experimental effort, it is still not understood how the preferred orien-
tation occurs in quartz.

Roek Deformation
317
I nhomogeneous deformation, corresponding to the bending of a stack of cards
(Fig. 381) likewise occurs frequently in nature. If the deformation du e to vertical
application of pressure, as shown in Fig. 382, is inh omogeneous, the b-axis,
which is unchanged under homogeneous deformation , can be extended also. In
the extreme case, the dilation can become sufficiently great along both a- an d
b-axes that the rock flows plastically forming a disk-shaped body. This defor-
mation gives rise to an axial petro-fabric diagram.
Petrofabric descriptions usually are based on a coordinate system with a-, b-,
and c-axes corresponding to those used in crystallography. Deformation planes
and directions can thus be indexed in a manner analogous to crystal faces and
planes. In Fig. 382, the axes are rotated 90° relative to the standard orientation,
with the a-axis running left to right. This was so drawn in this case, since the
b-axis remains constant during homogeneous deformation.
Deformation with Fracture. If its strength is exceeded during deformation,
a rock breaks. Such behavior is illustrated by means of a pressure-compression

diagram, which is similar to the tensile test data previously illustrated (Fig. 206).
In Fig. 383, the experiments by GRIGGS on the Solnhofen lithographie limestone
are illustrated. This is a uniformly very fine-grained rock. At high confining pres-
sures (values indicated for each curve) there is initially only a slight shortening
of the test specimen with increasing differential pressure, until plastic flow takes
over. Then only slight increases in differential pressure result in significant defor-
mation. The lower the confining pressure, the sooner the specimen failure
occurs. Fig. 383 indicates that a confining pressure of 8,000 atmospheres is neees-
sary to initiate plastic deformation of this limestone. This pressure corresponds
to a depth of about 30 km. More recent investigations by HEARD (1960) show
that at room temperature, deformation is initiated already at 7,500 atmospheres
pressure, corresponding to about 28 km depth. Under constant stress conditions
an increase in temperature lowers the strength of a rock. At higher temperatures
deformation is initiated at lower pressures. On the other hand, the pressure of
pore solutions enhances strength, decreasing the deformability of a rock.
Upon breaking, cracks or fractures form which are usually called joints. We
differentiate between shear fractures (or diagonal fractures) and tension fractures,
which form perpendicular to the direction of tension. H . CLOOS especially pointed
out the importance of joints, interpreting them in terms of geologic-tectonic
problems.

318
Metamorphic Petrogenesis
If th e mechanical stress becomes sufficiently great, the rock is broken up
into many small fragments, producing what we call caiaclasts or cataclastic
structures. This breakdown can proceed so far that a rock is completely pulverized,
forming so-called mylonites. The grain size of the cataclastic products may range
from several centimeters to colloidal dimensions. In Fig. 384, we can observe the
initiation of th e cataclastic breakdown of quartz grains. Along shear fra ctures
very thin mylonitic layers, called harnische, are found frequently. Mylonites,
with very coarse grain size are called abrasion breccias. During crushing sufficient
heat can be produced due to friction to cause the rock to melt. Such rocks are
called pseudotachylites, because of their similarity to glassy-melted rocks con-
taining basalt glass (tachylite). It would be better to call these melt mylonites.

Combined Effects of Deformation and Recrystallization. We must now consider
the cooperative interaction of deformation and recrystallization. The so-called
crystalline schists serve to exemplify their mutual roles. A preferred orientation
can result when a mineral grain is dissolved under differential pressure according
to the Riecke principal discussed earlier (p. 294). It was believed earlier that this
was the single explanation for schistosity of rocks. Whether one and the same
crystal can indeed grow further in the direction perpendicular to the applied
pressure has not been demonstrated. Probably, however, we can expect that
those mineral grains not under stress can grow at the expense of the compressed
grains, giving a fabric perpendicular to the applied pressure. This process can act
in conjunction with rock deformation. Usually, however, the foliation can be
traced back to mechanical deformation alone.
The glide planes along which deformation of a rock takes place may serve
as good pathways for circulating solutions and thus promote solution processes
and mineral neoformation in the rock. SANDER especially has emphasized the
importance of the penetrability of a rock. Foliation begins to develop even
during diagenesis. For example, pressure structures or stylolites are formed
during diagenesis as a result of differential resistance to solution along bedding
and joint planes.

Rock Deformation
319
During deformation, recrystallization and neoformation take place as a result
of the RIECKE and penetrability principles respectively. If the deformation is
followed by recrystallization, we speak of a precrystalline-deformation. If de-
formation and recrystallization occur simultaneously, one speaks of para-or
syncrystalline deformation. When deformation follows recrystallization, this is a
case of postcrystalline deformation. Related to the processes of crystallization
alone, one distinguishes pre-, para- (or syn-}, and post-tectonio crys tallization.
The expression " kinematic " is used also in place of " tectonic" .

In metallurgy, the cold-working of metals is an example of postcrystalline
deformation. Cold-working induces hardening of metals and requires generally
a higher input of energy than hot-working. Hot-werking corresponds to simul-
taneous deformation and recrystallization, to paracrystalline deformation.
Lattice defects which cause the hardening form during the deformation which
accompanies cold-working of metals. If cold-working is followed by tempering,
a sequence analogous to pre-crystalline deformation, these lattice defects serve
as nu clei for recrystallization. It can be suggested that porphyroblasts in meta-
morphic rocks form under such conditions. If th ey grow while the compressional
movement still persists, the crystals are rotated during growth and incorporate
portions of the groundmass, which has different orientation as growth proceeds.
An example of such a rotated garnet porphyroblast is illustrated in Fig. 385. In
a case like this it is possible to estimate the magnitude of the shear, lJd, which
caused the "flowage" ; where l is the magnitude of the lateral displacement in a
section of thickness d. According to MÜGGE, in the rock represented in Fig. 385,
some garnets which are rotated about 90° give s values of 1.57 or 3.14. Thus, th e
top and bottom surfaces of a rock layer 100 m thick would be displaced 157 or
314 meters laterally with respect to each other.

Stress and Antistress Minerals. Different minerals react to deformation in
different ways . Some minerals never occur in mechanically deformed rocks.
These have been called anti-stress minerals (HARKER) and include leucite, nephe-
line, sodalite, cancrinite, scapolite, andalusite, and cordierite. On the other hand,
certain other minerals are found most commonly in deformed rocks. These so-

called stress-minerals include kyanite, chloritoid, staurolite, mica, tale, chlorite,
some amphiboles, epidote, and zoisite . While the antistress minerals never occur
in mechanically deformed rocks, stress minerals, such as mica, kyanite, and
staurolite do occur in non-deformed associations.
The factors which account for the differences in stress and anti-stress minerals
are not known. Structural considerations show that the layer and chain silicates

The Problem of Anatexis and the Origin of Granite
321
do not occur as anti-stress minerals. Inosilicates are included in both groups.
Although the most important anti-stress minerals are framework silicates, others
such as albite and microcline frequently occur under stress conditions.
Differential pressure or stress, such as develops during rock deformation,
increases mineral reaction rates. It does not alter, however, the P-T stability
fields established under hydrostatic pressure. Thus aragonite can be converted
to calcite, which is stable at room temperature, by grinding in a mortar. Since
many metastable minerals (for example, diamond and aragonite) are not trans-
formed during the course of geologie time into stable forms , it has been suggested
that stress may be effective as a catalyst for certain transformations.
Distinctions have been made also between so-called plus and minus minerals,
according to whether the sums of the molecular volumes of the oxides are greater,
or less than the molecular volume of the mineral. These considerations, however
have no fundamentalsignificance today, since we now know that minerals are not
just simple mixtures of oxides.
Polymetamorphic Rocks. We have been considering the processes of meta-
morphism as if a rock were subjected in any instance to a single crystallization
and tectonic event. However, during the course of earth history frequently several
metamorphie events may be superimposed. Studies of the growth and movement
of porphyroblasts, may be of assistance in unravelling complex metamorphie
history. Thus, ZWART could propose for the Bosost region of the central Pyrenees
the sequence of metamorphie events illustrated in Fig. 386. First, there occurred
progressive metamorphism under relatively low hydrostatic pressure and a
presumed geothermal gradient of 15°0 per 100 m. This represents an intermediate
stage between regional and contact metamorphism. Finally, retrograde meta-
morphism occured, converting staurolite into pseudomorphs of muscovite.
4. The Problem 01 Anatexis and the Origin 01 Granite
In the vicinity of a magma chamber or by subsidence to great depths, tem-
peratures and pressures can be reached whereby rocks undergo melting. This
brings us into the region of ultrametamorphism. The most important and most
widely discussed topic in this area concerns the origin of granite. In Fig. 367
(p. 300) the minimum melting temperatures for granite (K) and basalt (M) are
plotted as a function of water vapor pressure, assuming that this is equivalent
to the total pressure. These curves indicate in a general way the melting behavior
of granite and basalt and give an indication of what to expect at high temperature.
A discussion of the relation between water content and pressure has been given
earlier (p. 230). We still know too little about the water budget of metamorphie
rocks, to be able to assess its influence here. It appears certain, however, that
even low water contents can be effective in mineral reactions. In general the water
content decreases with increasing depth. WEDEPOHL estimates the water content
in argillaceous sediments at > 5%, in sillimanite gneisses 1-2% , in granites
about 1%, and at 0.2-0.6% in granulites. It is certain that at a sufficiently
high temperature a sediment can be melted. This is not to say, however, that
sediments are simply changed into magmas. If a granite is melted, it produces a
granite melt which again crystallizes to form a granite. Only in exceptional
cases, however, do sediments have the composition of a granite. An example
would be a graywacke for which chemical weathering has played a subordinate
role. Generally K, and especially Na, are carried away during weathering and
removed from the sediment. The average analysis of clays shown in Table 49
21
Correns, Mineralogy

322
Metamorphic Petrogenesis
(p. 259) gives a Na20 and K 20 content of 1.6% and 3.6% respectively (1.7% and
3.7% on a CO2 and H 20 free basis). In contrast the granite analysis given in
Table 37 (p. 218) indicates 3.05% Na 20 and 5.42 % K 20 . The difference in alkali
contents cannot be attributed to neglect of the salt content of interstitial water in
sediment. These salts are included in the analysis and are too little in amount
to make up the difference. There are, however, two other possibilities by which
to derive high alkali products as a result of ultrametamorphism. One possibility
is through partial melting (selective mobilization). When a rock is heated it
does not necessarily melt completely at a given temperature. Let us consider as a
model the simple two-component system illustrated in Fig. 291 (p. 189). If we
heat up a mixture of diopside and anorthite, a melt first forms at the eutectic
temperature, with the eutectic composition. Floating in the melt will be diopside
or anorthite crystals, depending on whether the original composition falls to the
right or left of the eutectic. These crystals also melt as the temperature is in-
creased further. In the case of solid solution series, such as plagioc1ase, melting
is initiated by heating to a temperature at which the solidus is intersected. Under
equilibrium conditions, an albite-enriched melt forms along with anorthite-
enriched crystals. With increasing temperature, melting continues and is finally
complete when the melt phase attains the composition of the original plagio-
c1ase. If a sediment contains water, we would expect the melting curve of the
system to be lowered (see Figs.307 and 308, p.202 and 203). Thus, partial melts,
sometimes called interstitial melts almost always form first when a solid rock
melts. These melts can form stringers or veins in the rock. These are called venites
because, like veins in the human body, they have taken up material from the rock.
As a result of tectonic movements these partial melts can be squeezed out, accu-
mulate as a sort of magma in a different place, and crystallize again. ESKOLA in
particular has disoussed the implications of this form of magma genesis. Such
partial melts, also called mobilisates, would be alkali rich, because the alkalis
lower the melting temperature of a rock. At the eutectic temperature the melt
is enriched in the low melting components. These considerations apply chiefly
only to alkali rich starting materials. A ternary eutectic occurs in the case of a
great many granites, as TUTTLE and BOWEN (1958) have shown. This can be
interpreted to indicate that these granites formed as partial melts, since this
eutectic is not necessarily produced as a result of differentiation of a basic magma.
If we consider an extensive sequence of normal sediments, ultra-metamorphism
leading to partial melting must produce an alkali deficient residue as well as the
alkali rich melt. Rocks of the pyroxene-granulite facies are plausible examples,
especially those which carry hypersthene, garnet, and spinel as well as plagioclase,
K-feldspar, and quartz. From rocks of the amphibolite facies, granitic rocks on
the one hand and granulitic rocks on the other could result from partial melting.
While crystallization of the ferromagnesium minerals from a magma follows the
seheme illustrated on page 205, through metamorphism in the granulite facies
the sequence is reversed, biotite-e-hornblende-s-pyroxene.
In addition to partial melting, it has been suggested frequently that alkali-
rich rocks can be formed by metasomatic processes, during which alkalis in
particular are introduced. The formation of zones of large K-feldspar crystals
over relatively short distances (to about 100 m), round about granite contacts
is a well-known phenomenon. Plagioc1ase formation does not appear to be con-
nected with metasomatism in deep basement rocks , although this may be a
factor in younger rocks. For example, MISCH (1949) reported that in the north-
west Yunnan province (China), Mesozoic sediments were transformed by neo-
formation of plagioclase, K -feldspar, quartz, biotite, and hornblende into grano-

dioritic rocks under low P - T conditions. The question of the ongm of the
granitizing substances is quite controversial. Sometimes the injection of melts
is held responsible. Coarsely admixed rocks which form from both mobile and
immobile components are called migmatites. The mobilized component can have
been introduced into the host either by magmatic injection or produced in situ
by partial melting. In other instances hydrothermal solutions have been evoked
to cause granitization, in other cases, injection of gases. It appears quite likely
that all gradations from relatively anhydrous melts to aqueous solutions to
gaseous emanations indeed occur and promote the formation of alkali rich rocks.
At the present state of knowledge we may assume that there are at least three
types of granite and granite-like rocks. The first are granites which form by
differentiation of basic magmas.
Secondly, one can assume granites have formed from granite-like rocks
either by complete or partial melting. Sediments can give rise to partial melting.
We can formulate the following over-simplified model of this mode of origin.
At the greatest depths we should find rocks of the pyroxene-granulite facies,
the residues of the granitizing medium. The amphibolite facies above would be
granitized and at the highest Ievels we would find granitic intrusions.
The third mode of origin involves transformation of sediments into granite
or granite-like rocks by metasomatism.
Finally, it is to be noted that the interpretation of the origin of a granite is
further complicated, in that granites frequently exhibit metasomatic-like replaoe-
ment phenomena such as myrmekitization, chloritization, and sericitization,
which are postmagmatic in origin. They belong to a pegmatitic hydrothermal
after-stage, sometimes called autometamorphism.
A thorough discussion of the granite problem was presented by MEHNERT
(1959) and constituted the source of the discussion here. We cannot examine in
detail the question of how these theoretical modes of origin are represented in
nature. One cannot ignore the geological side of the problem, especially the
field relations. On the other hand, any interpretation, based on work in the
field, which is in conflict with physical-chemical principles, must be considered
unsatisfactory. When we encounter such contradictory evidence, either the
observational interpretation is incorrect, or we have not considered all possible
physical-chemical factors. We have encountered such a conflict of data previ-
ously when we considered evaporite deposits (see p. 289). We could notexplain
satisfactorily the evaporite composition on the basis of VAN'T HOFF investi-
gations alone. Only by considering different influences, especially salt meta-
morphism, could we arrive at better understanding. We should not forget, how-
ever, that this understanding was only possible after VAN'T HOFF, through his
classic experiments, had established the physical-chemical principles.
5. Nomenclature 01 Metamorphism and Metamorphic Rocks
a) Definitions of Metamorphie Processes
During the course of more than a hundred years of research in the field of
metamorphism an extensive nomenclature has developed. Discussions of the
origin of metamorphie rocks are often impeded by lack of consistency in usage
of terms. At the 1960 meeting of the International Geological Congress " Pro-
posals for the Nomenclature of Migmatites and Related Rocks" were published by
DIETRICH and MEHNERT, with which we largely agree. A suggestion made by
WEGMANN at the beginning of the discussion on nomenclature seems particularly
21·

324
Metamorphic Petrogenesis
noteworthy to me. He suggested that, in addition to distinguishing between
descriptive and genetic terminology, we should in the case of the latter use
functional expressions, that is to say, expressions which describe those possible
processes which have been considered by the various schools of thought on
metamorphism. We have in the preceding, as weIl as this edition of this book,
attempted to supply the basic background to theory, and therefore, have used
only a few of the many technical terms. Since familiarity with terminology is
important for proper understanding of the technicalliterature, the most important
terms are listed alphabetically below.
Anatexis: Rock melting (modifiers: intergranular, partial, differential, selective, complete
melting.
Contamination: Change in composition of a magma by assimilation of inclusions or country
rock.
Diatexis: High-grade anatexis.
Ectexis: Anatexis by in situ formation of a fluid fraction.
Entexis: Formation of migmatites by introducing a mobile fraction.
Hybridization: 1. Mixing of magmas, 2. Synonymous with contamination.
Metablastesis: 1. Recrystallization of rocks with preferential growth of certain minerals
(esp, feldspar). 2. Essentially isoohemical recrystallization (without separation of a
mobile phase).
Metasom: Portion of a rock newly formed by metasomatism.
Metatect: Fluid portion of a migmatite during the main stage of formation,
Metatexis: Lew-grade (differential or partial) anetexis.
Palingenesis: 1. New formation of a magma by melting older rocks (which have dernon-
stratively already participated in a significant portion of the petrogenetic cycle).
2. New formation of rocks with mineral content and fabric of magmatic rocks without
implications as to mechanism.
Permeation: Penetration of solid rock by geochemically mobile substances (melts, solutions,
gases).
Petroblastesis: Rock genesis by crystallization from diffusing flowing ions.
Replacement: Material exchange on an atomic scale or practically simultaneous solution of
older minerals and crystallization of introduced substances,
Stereogen: When the major formation process exists in the solid or predominately solid
(crystallized) state.
b) Metamorphic Rock Nomenclature
As we have indicated previously, metamorphic rocks are usually mechanically
deformed. For this reason the names gneiss and schist have been used for a long
time, in conjunction with the characteristic mineral content; for example, horn-
blende gneiss, chlorite schist, etc.
In the proceedings of a symposium published in 1962 by Austrian workers,
only rocks with parallel texture, and which contain over 20% feldspar and 10%
mica were designated as gneiss. In 1963 WENK was in favor of using only fabric
and not mineral content to characterize gneisses and schists. Schists cleave into
thin plates from a millimeter to 1 cm thick or into columnar fragments of these
dimensions. Gneisses cleave into plates and pieces from a centimeter to a deci-
meter in thickness or into thick prisms (stengle gneisses).
As clays undergo diagenesis and are subjected to increasing regional meta-
morphism, they transform from plastic clay with increasing consolidation and
recrystallization as folIows:
Clay -+shale -+phyllite -+mica schist.
Limestones are metamorphosed to marble and, like gneisses and schists, are
named after characteristic minerals, for example, tremolite marble. The same is
true of quartzites. A metamorphie rock without parallel fabrie is ealled a homjel.

Nomenclature of Metamorphism and Metamorphic Rocks
325
Not only sediments are transformed by metamorphism, but also igneous
rocks. One distinguishes between para-qneisse«, which formed from sedimentary
parents, and orthoqneisse«, which formed from originally igneous rocks. Another
way to designate a metamorphic rock after its parent material, is to add the
prefix meta- to the original rock name. For example, metagraywacke, meta-
diorite, etc,
Two rock names which we have used frequently without precise definition are:
Amphibolite: a rock consisting predominantly of common hornblende and
plagioc1ase.
Granulite: a fine-grained (0.1-1 m) rock with platy structure, of granitic
composition, which always contains pyrope-almandine-spessartite garriet instead
of biotite, as well as K-feldspar and platy quartz.
Finally, we shall conc1ude with some additional definitions from the 1960
proposed nomenc1ature, which were designated as particularly important:
Agmatite: Migmatite with brecciated texture.
Anatexite: Product of anatexis,
Chorismite : Coarsely mixed rock consisting of petrographically distinguishable fractions of
undetermined origin.
Dictyonite: Migmatite with retioular flexure zonal texture.
Ectexite: Product of ectexis.
Ectinite: Product of regional kinetometamorphism (without signüicant metamorphism).
Embrechite: Migmatite with banded, schlieren-, and augen-texture, in which the fabric of
the original rock is still partially preserved.
Metasomatite: Product of metasomatism.
Metatexite: Product of metatexis,
Nebulite: Migmatite with schlieren- and wolken texture.
Neosom: Younger portion of a chorismite.
Ophthalmite: Chorismite with augen- or lenticular texture.
Palaeosomiter Older, original portion of a chorismite.
Phlebite: Metamorphite or migmatite with vein texture.
St.romatite : Chorismite with banded texture.

X. Geochemical Considerations
1. ffistory 01 the Concept 01 Geochemistry
The Concept. With consideration of the origin of granite, we have concluded
our review of the processes involved in the origin and transformation of rocks
in the earth's crust. Thus, we have observed a cycle of processes starting with
magmatic crystallization, leading to weathering, sedimentation, and finally
metamorphism, which can lead in turn to the generation of new magmas. In
dealing with this so-called rock cycle (or geochemical cycle) we have, in fact,
considered the geochemical relations of the most important rockforming ele-
ments.
In conclusion we must examine this concept of geochemistry in somewhat
greater detail. Sometimes the conceptof geochemistryis restrictedto determination
of the terrestrial, crustal, and cosmic abundances of the elements. However, this
purely analytical activity is only aprerequisite data-collecting phase of the real
scientific objective of geochemistry. This objective was defined by V. M. GOLD-
SCHMIDT as the discovery of laws which determine the geochemical distribution
of the elements. We can subdivide geochemistry into the chemistry of the crust,
of the total earth, or of the cosmos (cosmochemistry). Cosmic elemental abun-
dances are related to the origin of the elements, and thus the empirically deter-
mined cosmic abundance values constitute a basis for considerations of theories
of nucleogenesis. Space does not permit us to consider this subject here. When
dealing earlier with petrogenesis, we have considered the very important processes
affecting migration of the major elements, and thus have discussed already an
important part of geochemistry. We shall discuss, therefore, only three additional
geochemical problems. The first is the quantitative calcuIation of materiallosses
and gains (geochemical balance) in the earth's crust. The second concerns the
probable distribution of elements in the earth as well as the cosmos and is thus
related in its strictest application to the question of the origin of the earth,
Thirdly, we must consider that most elements consist of mixtures of isotopes.
The investigation of the isotope distribution laws is currently one of the most
vigorously developing areas of geochemistry. Before we discuss these three
aspects of geochemistry, it is useful to consider some of the facts concerning the
development of geochemistry, especially since the erroneous impression often
prevails that geochemistry is a science which has only recently developed.
The History of Geochemistry. The word geochemistry stems from SCHOEN-
BEIN who used it first in 1838, although as early as 1821 BERZELlUS had referred
to mineralogy as "the chemistry of the earth's crust". Between 1848 and 1854
eARL GUSTAV BISCHOF'S " Lehrbuch der physikalischen und chemischen Geo-
logie" appeared. BISCHOF probably can be considered as one of the real founders
of the geochemistry of the earth's crust. By 1846 ELlE DE BEAUMONT in France
had publiahed the first summary of the crustal abundanoe of the elements.
JUSTUS ROTH wrote his "Allgemeine und chemische Geologie" between 1879 and
1893. In 1904 the "Treatise on Metamorphism", by the American geologist
VAN HISE appeared. This considered quite general geochemical questions as well

Determining Geochemical Balances
327
as metamorphism, especially the geochemical material balance in the erust.
Four years later the standard work by FRANK W. CLARKE, "Data on Geo-
chemistry", was published. The fifth and last edition appeared in 1924; the
sixth edition is being published in parts, some of whieh have appeared already.
Also, the interest in rare elements began early. W. H. HARTLEY and H. RA-
MAGE showed in 1897 that Ga and In are widely distributed in minerals and
rocks. G. EBERHARD began in 1908 bis spectrographie investigations of the rare
earth elements. In similar fashion W. VERNADSKY in 1910 proved the wide
distribution of In, Tl, Ga, Rb, and Cs. In 1917 HARKINS studied the relationship
between abundance of elements in the crust and in meteorites and their position
in the periodie table, and disclosed the rule that bears bis name. HARKINS' rule
states that elements with even atomic numbers are more common than those
with odd numbers. In 1924 VERNADSKY'S book "Geochimie" appeared in French.
In 1930 the German translation of a revised Russian edition appeared. From
1922 on V. M. GOLDSCHMIDT and his colleagues showed the importance of crystal
chemistry in solving geochemical questions. In addition, they determined the
abundance of many rare elements in different rocks, especially by means of
speetroscopie studies.
The bistory of isotope geochemistry began in 1902 with the explanation of
radioactivity by RUTHERFORD and SODDY. The investigations of radioaetive,
unstable isotopes paved the way at the beginning of the twentieth eentury to a
new understanding of the heat budget of the earth and led to the development of
absolute age dating of minerals.
The abundance of stable isotopes has been investigated since the discovery
of heavy hydrogen or deuterium by H. UREY in 1932. The utilization of oxygen
isotope ratios for temperature determination was likewise initiated by H . UREY
in 1947.
2. Determining Geochemical Balances
GOLDSOHMIDT'S Calculation. We are indebted also to GOLDSCHMIDT for his
determination of material balance in the earth's erust. The earlier rough estimates
of ehemieal losses and gains during the rock cycle were further refined sub-
sequently by other investigators, such as CLARKE. The basie assumption of
all such caleulations is that various elements are incorporated into sediments
and into sea water as a result of weathering. 'I'hus, the amount of an element
contained in weathered primary igneous rocks must be equal to the amount
contained in the derived sediments and sea water. For such eonsiderations it is
immaterial whether igneous rocks are really magmatic or whether they have
been formed by metamorpbie processes. In his calculations GOLDSCHMIDT followed
the procedure of SCHLOESING and related material abundances to 1 em2 of the
earth's surface. Tbis has the advantage of producing more manageable smaller
numbers. The amount of weathered primary crystalline rock is designated by E,
sedimentary rocks by S, and seawater by M (always expressed in kgJcm2) . In
addition the pereentage of an element or its oxide, x, in primary rocks is designated
as e"" in sediments as 8"" and in sea water as m",. Thus, the balaneing equation for
any element can be expressed as follows:
E· e",=M· m",+S · 8",.
(1)
In this expression only M and m", are known with any great eertainty. The
values for ez (Table 42, p.221) are still somewhat uncertain. Some values for
8""
likewise still uneertain, are tabulated in Tables 67 and 68. If we take two

328
Geoehemieal Considerations
pairs of values for e", and 8x for two different elements, we can solve simultaneously
two Eq. (1) for the unknown values of E and 8. Based on the elements Na and K,
we obtain values for E and 8 which agree rather weIl with those of GOLDSCHMIDT
and CLARKE. For Ca and Mg, however, quite unlikely values are obtained. Prob-
ably for this reason, GOLDSCHMIDT used a somewhat different approach. He

inserted in Eq. (1) the Na content of argillaceous-sandy sediments, that is,
carbonate-free sediments, assumed at 1%. As the second equation he used the
expression:
He estimated that the alteration of igneous rock to sediments was accompanied
by an 8% loss in CaO, MgO, and Na20, compensated for by a 5% gain in H20.
Thus, Eq. (2) indicates the net loss of 3% by weight. In this way GOLDSCHMIDT
arrived at the values, E = 160 kg/cm2 and 8 = 155 kg/cm2. Taking the values of
0.6 and 2.6% as the CaO and MgO eontent of earbonate-free sediments, he eal-
culated how much CaO and MgO was left over, from the 160 kg of weathered
igneous rocks, for carbonate formation. He obtained the values 12.553 kg CaCOs,
and 1.999 kg MgCOs equivalent to 10.170 kg CaCOs and 4.372 kg CaMg(COS)2'
Including these along with the carbonate-free sediments, we arive at a total of
170 kg sediment produced from 160 kg of igneous rock. GOLDSCHMIDT included
shales and sandstones together. However, following the suggestions of VON
ENGELHARDT we have separated them in Table 66.

Because of the uncertainty of values for e", and 8x ' these calculations can
give only rough approximations. Nevertheless, trial calculations (CORRENS, 1949)
show that the values of 160 kg/cm2for E and 170 kg/cm2for 8 do not significantly
change when the ex values for K and Na are varied.
Material Balance for Some Important Elements. Once we can assume correct
values for E , 8 , and ex , we can attempt to calculate material balances for a number
of elements from Eq. (1). In doing so we can distinguish three essentially different

groups of elements. Table 67 gives the pertinent information for the readily
soluble common cations. A comparison of the calculated and observed amounts
of these elements in sediments shows at least order of magnitude agreement in the
case of Na and K . The agreement is less
satisfactory in the case of magnesium and
least satisfactory with calcium. This is a
consequence of the Ca and Mg ions re-
moved from sea water in the formation of
carbonates incorporated into the sedi-
ments. One can characterize this same
behavior by means of elemental residence
times in the ocean (BARTH, 1952). These
can be computed for each element as the

ratio of the total amount of an element in the sea 00 its annual influx, expressed
in years. In 1961 BARTH estimated the following residence times (in millions of
years) : Na 120, KlO, Mg 23, and Ca 1.2. For these calculations, and in Table 67,
the observed values after ÜLARKE and after RONOV were calculated as follows.
From CLARKE'S analyses of average clays, sands, and limestone, and the data in
Table 67, the "observed" values after CLARK are calculated. The "observed"
RONOV values are derived in a like manner except that data for marine clays
are used instead of CLARKE'S clay values,
Table 68 gives analogous values for the relatively insoluble elements. These
data are derived from Eq. (1) modified to exclude the term M . mx since these
elements are virtually absent from sea water. The agreement between calculated
and observed values for Al20a is very good. Values for Fe20a and Ti02 agree
within the limit of error, Whether the discrepancy for Si02 is due to 000 high
a ex or 000 low a 8x value, or 00 incorrect clay : sand: limestone ratios, is as yet
undetermined.
The anions listed in Table 69 show in part a relationship quite different from
that of the cations. Br, Cl, and S are so strongly enriched in sea water that their
origin by release by weathering from igneous rocks alone is impossible. They
occur in sea water alone in excess of amounts which could have been produced
by weathering. In the case of boron, the observed content in sediments alone is
almost 50 times higher than calculated. These four elements are derived from
the interior of the earth by degassing of igneous rocks (see p. 224). It would appear

330
Geochemical Considerations
that fluorine and iodine are subordinate fractions of the evolved gases. Fluorine
may be tied up in rocks by autometamorphism. Iodine appears to be concen-
trated in sediments, perhaps due to a short residence time resulting from ab-
straction from sea water by algae.
3. Isotope Geochemistry
In the last decade isotope geochemistry has developed into such a compre-
hensive science, that here we can give only a few hints of its importance to geology
and petrology. We distinguish between stable and unstable isotopes. Among the
unstable isotopes we can again differentiate two groups based on origin, those
which are still forming today from interaction with cosmic radiation and those
in the earth's ernst and in meteorites which have occurred from the beginning,
or are the fission products of Th and V.
The Unstable Isotopes. The unstable isotopes newly formed by cosmic radiation
have relatively short half-lives. An example is the unstable carbon-14 (014"radio-
carbon") formed from the stable isotope N~4 by neutron bombardment. Oarbon-14
has a half-life of 5,700 years and is used to date carbonaceous materials from
historical and pre-historical times. Tritium, HL has a much shorter half-life of
12.4 years. It thus serves as an important tracer in studying the circulation of
water in the atmosphere. By means of certain isotopes the cosmic ray ages of
meteorites can be determined. These ages represent the time the meteorites have
resided in space.
Those unstable isotopes with half-lives > 108 years, "radioactive" isotopes
in the narrow sense, are used also in absolute age determination. The V-Th
"clock " has been used for some time. In the last decade use has been made more
and more of two other decay series. One is the decay of Rb87 to Sr87 byß(electron)
emission, with a half-life of 5· 1010 years. The other is the transmutation of
K40 to the stable isotopes Ar4O+ Oa40by K-electron and ßradiation capture, with
a half-life of 1.2 . 1010 years.
Isotopic age determinations are not important only for establishing an abso-
lute geologie time scale. They can give information on the relative ages of indi-
vidual minerals in a rock assemblage, for example, micas and feldspars.
The unstable isotopes are important to us in another respect. When they
decay radioactively, they produce heat. The three most abundant radioactive iso-
topes are V, Th, and K. One gram of V produces, in equilibrium with its daughter
products, 0.71 calJyear; 1 g Th produces 0.20 caljyear; 1 g K 27 . 10-6 cal/year.
The average abundance of these elements in a number of common rocks is indi-
cated in Table 70, along with the corresponding heat output, calculated for a
column of rock 3 km long and with 1 cm2cross section (corresponding to approxi-
mately 1 metric ton of rock). These data show that the heat production is
greatest in those Si02-rich rocks common in the earth's ernst, and decreases with
decreasing Si02 content. Heat production is very low in peridotites, which are
assumed to comprise the upper mantle. If one wishes to calculate the temperature
rise in the earth, one must make certain assumptions about the internal com-
position of the earth. For the temperature distribution depicted in Fig.363, a V
content of 3.3 . 10-2 g/t was assumed.
The Stable Isotopes. The stable isotopes have become important in other
ways for understanding geochemical processes. As the name isotope indicates, all
isotopes of an element have the same atomic number. For example the isotopes
012,013,014 all have the atomic number of 6 for carbon. They differ in their mass
numbers, 12, 13, and 14. This difference in mass, along with the vibrational

energies of molecules containing different isotopes, can lead to isotope fractiona-
tion by diffusion, electrolysis or chemical reaction. Of course, these differences are
very slight. Only the relatively recent development of mass spectrometry has
made it possible to investigate the fractionation effects. Here we shall consider
only two examples. A much-investigated problem is the distribution of oxygen
isotopes in minerals. Oxygen has three stable isotopes, of which 0 16is the most
abundant, constituting 99.76% on the average. 0 17 makes up 0.04% and 018

0.2% in the earth's crust, We can disregard the small fraction of 0 17and consider
alone the fractionation of 0 18. This fractionation is temperature dependent. In
1947 H.UREY suggested the use of 0 18fractionationfortemperature measurements.
Since this time a great number of temperature determinations have been made,
especially on calcium carbonate hard parts of fossil organisms. In explanation we
can consider a simple example, the equilibrium :
00~6+H 20 18~0016018+H 2016.
As a result of distinctly different absolute energies, the rate constants are different
for each indicated reaction direction, the reaction to the right being favored
somewhat. This results in a very slight enrichment of 018in 0°2 , or of 0 16in H 20 .
At 0°0 the fractionation factor amounts to 1.045. The exchange rate increases
greatly in both directions with increasing temperature. At the same time the
influence of absolute energy on establishment of equilibrium is lessened, so that
the fractionation factor at high temperature approaches unity (1.039 at 25°0).
Since the amount of oxygen combined in H 20 in the world's oceans is for all
practical purposes infinite compared to the amount of dissolved 0°2 , the ex-
change reaction influences effectively only the 0 18 content of 0°2 , The 002
dissolved in water can be considered as an important ingredient in the precipi-
tation of calcium carbonate. We cannot consider the details of the mechanism of
incorporation of 0 18 into the carbonate strncture, but it is clear that one can
determine the temperature of crystallization from the 0 18/016 ratio. A number
of precautions must be considered, however. Equilibrium must have prevailed
and the 0 18content of sea water should be known. No isotopic exchange can have
taken place after deposition, that is, as a result of diagenesis. The 018/016 ratio,
expressed in °/00, is usually related to a standard as follows:
0 18/016 sample-
0 18/016 standerd
15 018=
-'------;~=--;--';-_,--­
0 18/016 standard
Over aperiod of time different standards have been used, as can be discerned by
a study of the literature.

332
Geochemical Considerations
A second important example of the application of stable isotope geochemistry
involves the isotopes of sulfur. There are four stable isotopes of sulfur. S32, con-
stituting 95%, and S34, 4.22% are the most abundant. S33, 0.76% , and S38,
0.014% can be ignored. Sulfur occurs in nature either in elemental form, or more
frequently as sulfide or sulfate. Inorganic separation processes are, as with
oxygen, strongly temperature dependent. The fractionation factor decreases
rapidly with temperature. Bacterial reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide is
an important separation process at low temperatures. The light isotope S32 is
always enriched in sulfides, the heavier S34 in sulfates. As previously indicated
(p.277 and 278), this bacterial reduction plays an important role in the sedimentary
cycle. We can attempt, from the isotope ratios, to determine the conditions
of formation of sulfide mineral deposits. We can attempt to distinguish between
deposits of hydrothermal or sedimentary origin. Fig. 387 summarizes <5 S34 values,
calculated in a manner analogous to those for oxygen as described earlier. It
indicates that the range of values for sedimentary sulfides is especially large.
This is because the incorporation of the isotopes into sulfides and sulfates is
dependent also on the proportions of the latter. The more sulfate used up by
reduction, the remainder remaining enriched in S34, the more S34 must be in-
corporated into sulfide. Thus, sedimentary sulfides can be formed which are
likewise enriched in S34. Only those sulfides which give
<5 S34 values less than
-15%0' can be considered of certain sedimentary origin.
An additional interesting result has come out of investigations of sulfur
isotope distributions in fossil sulfates deposited in saline environments since the
Pre-Cambrian. These have shown that the isotope ratios have changed during
the course of time (NIELSEN, 1965).
4. Abundance 01 Elements in the Earth and Cosmos
Layered Structure 01 the Earth. In our considerations thus far the assumption
was made that the abundances of individual elements in the earth's outer ernst
are known. If we now attempt to determine their proportions for the total earth,
we are confronted with some fundamental difficulties. We have direct information
about only the outer few kilometers of the earth's ernst, by direct observation
through borings and mine workings. At the present time these observations have
been made only to a depth of about 5 km. As a result of up-folding and sub-
sequent denudation, we get a view of still deeper layers to about 5-10 km.
From the travel time curves for earthquake waves we can draw some con-
clusions concerning the composition of still deeper layers. Propagation velocities
change with the nature of the rock through which earthquake waves pass. They
depend in addition on the depth parameters of the rock, that is, on temperature
and pressure, as Fig. 388 shows, In constructing the velocity curves,it is assumed
that temperature and pressure are related as shown. Through the interpretation
of travel time curves from earthquakes and explosions it has been concluded that
the earth can be differentiated into different zones. In Fig. 389 the velocities
of longitudinal L waves, analogous to sound waves, and transverse T waves are
plotted as a function of depth. Two major discontinuities are immediately ap-
parent. One, occurring at a very shallow depth, is called the Mohoroviöiö discon-
tinuity. This is considered as the lower boundary of the earth's crust. A second
major discontinuity occurs at a depth of about 2,900 km. This represents the lower
boundary of the earth's mantle. The innermost portion of the earth is called the
core. Data relative to the dimensions, density, and mass of these three zones is
given in Table 71.

We note first that the earth's crust comprises those layers in which the propa.
gation velocities of longitudinal waves are less than 8 km/sec. In Fig. 388 we
see that granite exhibits lower and gabbro somewhat higher velocities. The
outermost crust consists of sediments and granitic or metamorphie rocks; the
deeper crust consists of rocks of gabbroic composition. Beneath the oceans the
crust is quite thin, about 6 km; beneath the continents it reaches a thickness of
about 35 km. These relations are illustrated for the north Atlantic Ocean in
Fig. 390. Beneath the Mid-Atlantic Rise ascending mantle material is presumed.
While the mineralogie composition of the crust can be deduced at least in
part by direct observation, data for the mantle and core, such as those summarized
in Table 70, are deduced by indirect considerations. It is generally accepted
today that the core consists of a nickel-iron mixture. There are a number of
hypotheses concerning the constitution of the upper mantle. It is postulated
by some that eclogite, a gamet-augite rock, is the main constituent of the upper
mantle. Another widely held view postulates a peridotite upper mantle. Dunite
would be the predominant constituent of this mantle. In addition to other argu-
ments, the frequent occurrence of olivine inclusions in basic igneous rocks is
taken as support of this hypothesis. Eclogites have a chemical composition
similar to basalt. RINGWOOD has proposed an upper mantle consisting of pyrolite,
with a chemical composition corresponding to that of a 1:3 ratio of basalt and
peridotite. Olivine inclusions would then correspond to material separated from
the mantle.

This differentiation into a nickel-iron core and silicate layers has led to the
hypothesis, held for some time, that the earth consists of material analogous in
composition to meteoritic material. For this reason it is important that we
examine this idea briefly.
Meteorites. Since it was suggested by ÜHLADNI in 1794, the idea has prevailed
that meteorites are fragments of a celestial body which have reached the earth
from somewhere in space. They probably originate from the belt of small planet-
oids that revolve about the sun in a strongly elliptical orbit between Mars and
Jupiter. Whether they originated from one or more disintegrated planets or from
smaller asteroids is not known. They exhibit great variability in composition, as
Table 72 shows. By way of explanation it is to be noted that we distinguish as
"falls" those meteorites which
were observed to fall (in parentheses) and
as "finds", those whose fall was not observed (in square brackets). The most
common stony meteorites are the chondrites, so-named because they consist of
chondrules, or spherolitic aggregates of silicates. Their diameters vary between

0.1 to a few millimeters. These struetures are absent in the aehondrites. A portion
of the aehondrites have ehemieal eompositions similar to gabbroio roeks. Others
are ehemieally similar to the ehondrites whieh have eompositions like peridotites.
To what extent we ean eonclude that meteoritie material is analogous to the
earth's mantle, and to what extent this material has been ehanged during the
eourse of earth history eannot be con-
sidered here. We shall attempt, however,
to outline a very simple model for the
origin of the earth, whieh eonsists of four
major stages. We owe this summary to
BIBeR (1965).
1. Matter, whieh had a eomposition
similar to iron and stony meteorites,
eoaleseed about 5,000 million years ago
to form a heterogeneous agglomerate.
2. This mass was heated up by the
evolution of heat from radioaetive ele-
ments and from tidalfrietion. Themelting
point of iron was reaehed at depth after
about 500 million years.
3. The fluid iron sank to the interior
forming the earth's eore.
AB a result
about 600 eal/g of heat was liberated.
A low melting portion of the silieates
melted and aseended forming the earth's
mantle. It now eontained essentially all of the radioaetive elements. This happened
3,500-4,500 million years ago,
4. The earth's ernst began to differentiate in some regions about 3,500 million
years ago. Radioaetive elements were enriehed in the ernst relative to the mantle.
Then the eyele erosion-sedimentation-mountain building began,
If we attempt to estimate the ehemieal eomposition of the eore and mantle,
the results are influeneed greatly by a number of more or less uneertain assump-
tions. Values, ealeulated by B. MASON (1966), are eompiled in Table 73 and com-
pared with eorresponding values for the ernst, taken from Table 42. We ean
probably eonelude without reservation that among the most eommon elements,
Si, Al, Ca, K, Na, and Ti are enriehed in the ernst, Fe, Mg, P, and Mn in the
mantle. Sinee, as Table 71 shows, the erust makes up only 0.4 % of the mass of
the earth, the approximate eomposition of the total earth ean be caloulated
from data for the mantle+eore.
Cosmie Abundanee 01 the Elements. We have a mueh better idea of the eosmie
abundanee of elements as a result of speetrographie investigations of stellar light.
These data, supplemented by analyses of meteorites and erustal data, are com-
led in the first two eolumns of Table 74 (SUESS-UREY, 1956 and CAMERON, 1959).
The third eolumn gives the speetral analytieally determined values for the sun,
The sun eontains 333,400 times the mass of the earth and 99.8% of the total
mass of the solar system. The data in these tables are based on Si abundanee of
108• They are espeeially signifieant with respeet to theories of the origin of the
elements, with whieh we eannot deal here.

3. Rhombohedral Axes
It is possible and sometimes useful in the case of trigonal crystals to relate
them to rhombohedral as weIl as hexagonal axes. The relationship between these
two axial systems is illustrated in Fig. 391. It is customary in X-ray crystallo-
graphy to express rhombohedral cells in terms of hexagonal axes.
The relationship between the axial ratio cla (hex.) and the rhombohedral
angle (! ean be expressed as follows:
. e
sm 2 =
3
~ = V.

Hexagonal indices (hk· 1)

be
transformed
to
rhombohedral
indices
(pqr) by the expressions :
p=t(2h+k+1) ,
q=t(k-h+l),
r=t(-2k-h+l).
Conversely:
h=p-q
k=q-r
l=p+q+r.
Thus we obtain:
(OO.l)hex. = (ttt)rh.
or
(lll)rh.;
(lO.O)hex. = (i I I)rh.
or
(2II)rh.;
(lOO)rh

rhombohedral coordinate axes. The origin of
the rhombohedral axes has, as related to the
transformation formulae of the text, the indi-
cated coordinates (based on the ~, a2 and c
axes of the hexagonal coordinate system).

ing to the older Sehoenflies system, the spaee groups assoeiated with a partieular
erystal olass are numbered, the number appearing as a superseript above and
to the right of the class symbol. The Hermann-Mauguin system, used most
widely today, is based on the erystal class notations (see p. 29 and 43). The
symbol for the translation group (spaee lattice) is plaeed in first position
(see p. 50). The following symbols are used:
P primative,
A faee-centered on (100),
B faee-eentered on (010),
o faee-eentered on (001),
F faee-centered on (100), (010) and (001),
I body-eentered,
R rhombohedral.
Following the translation group symbol comes the erystal class (point group)
symbol. This symbolism includes, however, notations eharaeteristie of the entire
three-dimensional pattern (see p. 19). For example,
P43~2 is aspace group
designation eorresponding to the tetragonal trapezohedral 422 elass. A seeond
example is the space group for pyrargyrite, R30, eorresponding to the erystal
olass 3m. If symmetry axes are perpendieular to planes, the same eonvention is
used as with point groups, for, example, P21/o.
We have reprodueed in Table 5 the organization and nomenclature of the
"International Tables for X-ray Crystallography", a referenee work that defin-
itely must be eonsulted for intensive work with spaoe groups and erystal strue-
tures.

Remarks on Hermann-Mauguin Symbols
1. The symbols do not include always all of the symmetry elements of the space group. AB
they appear in the tables they are abbreviated. For, example, onIy the symmetry planes, not
the two-fold axes (2 or 21) are indicated for orthorhombic pyramidal classes. In addition it is
to be borne in mind that a partieular spaee group can contain different symmetry elements
running parallel to each other. The Hermann-Mauguin symbols da not indicate all of these.
If we consider the space group symbols for the two enantiomorphic forms of low quartz, P~21
and P3 221, the 2-fold secondary axes are noted. The notation is incomplete, however, for 21
axes also run in the same direction.
2. The Hermann-Mauguin symbol for a particular space group varies with different
arrangement possibilities, giving rise to numerous combinations, The symbol for the fre-
quently occurring spaee group No. 15 «t» will be P21/c, P21/a or P~/n, depending on the
direction of translation in the glide plane.
3. In the case of space groups of the tetr. scalenohedral, trig. trapezohedral, ditrig. pyra-
midal, trig. scalenohedral, and ditrig. dipyramidal classes, the arrangement changes within
the crystal class. Characteristic examples are No. 114 (D:a): P 421c and No. 115 (D:a): P4m2.
In the first oase (in conformity with p. 42) the horizontal symmetry axes are secondary
axes, in the second case intermediate axes. The two space groups are arrayed at 45° to each
other. One selects an orientation which will produce the smallest unit cell. If we described
space group No. 115 with the standard orientation, we should obtain a double, C-centered
cell, with the symbol C42m.
4. In the classes 3, 3, 32, 3m, and 321m the hexagonal cell is sometimes the smallest,
sometimes the rhombohedral cell, producing corresponding P or R translation groups. Two
members of the trigonal scalenohedral class serve as examples. Brucite, Mg(OH)2 crystallizes
with space group No. 164 (D~a): P3ml. Its primitive unit cell is hexagonal, however, with
a=b=!=c and y=120°. Calcite, CaCOa, crystallizesinspacegroup No. 167 (D:a):R3mc; its
primitive cell is rhombohedral.

B. Summary of the Common Minerals and Their Properties
Compiled by S. KORITNIG
Preliminary Remarks
The following tables summarize the properties of the 300 most common minerals, About
520 mineral names are noted. The minerals are arranged according to the tables of STRUNZ.
A natural classification based on genetic considerations cannot be formulated. That
chapter of the book which deals with the occurrence of minerals indicates that a given
mineral may have formed under a variety of conditions. These various modes of origin are
compiled for eaoh mineral under the heading "occurrence". As has been pointed out in the
section on Crystal Chemistry, a special difficulty in mineral classification stems from fre-
quently varying composition of minerals. In part this is related to simple solid solution. The
extent of solid solution is in most cases clearly indicated in the tables. In some cases
substitution of ions takes place in a manner whioh is not simply described. In cases where
the substitution takes place to a significant extent, the substituting ions are indicated. It
is important to stress to the beginner that for these reasons the chemical formulae indicated
are subject to considerable variation.
It was attempted to note in the tables all of those properties which are characteristic
or diagnostic of the minerals included. Nevertheless these tables cannot be considered
a substitute for the special textbooks in systematic mineralogy, such as DANA's System
0/Mineralcgy.
