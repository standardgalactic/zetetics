Abstract
Picky eating is an under-researched behavior in children. The current study aims to assess
what behaviors correlate with picky eating to better understand potential risk factors for
Anorexia Nervosa. 111 children were evaluated at 5 and 6 years old, and a subset was evaluated
again at 7 and 8 years old (n=36). Executive function and IQ were evaluated using parent reports
and behavioral measures at baseline. Picky eating was reported by a parent questionnaire.
Results showed deficits in shifting to be a predictor of higher picky eating behaviors at ages 5-6
years. Additionally, children who were reported extremely picky eaters at baseline made fewer
errors in executive function conditions in Shape School. Furthermore, correlations showed picky
eating at baseline was a strong predictor of picky eating at Time 2.  Since children are currently
at ages 7 and 8, reports of Anorexia Nervosa have not been obtained. The current study evaluated
pre-established deficits for AN while finding some better and worse outcomes for picky eaters,
which furthers the limited research on picky eating.

Predicting Anorexia Nervosa: Picky Eating, Overcontrol, IQ, and Executive Functioning
Picky eating is a behavior that is often overlooked by parents, as many children grow out
of it as they get older. Picky eating falls on a spectrum of feeding difficulties and can be
characterized as when a child consumes a limited variety of foods and commonly refuses to eat
both familiar and novel foods, as well as a strong food preference. (Dovey et al., 2008; Taylor et
al., 2015). Picky eating is critical to study, because it may be a precursor for psychopathology,
specifically Anorexia Nervosa (AN) (Taylor et al., 2015). AN is a disorder accompanied by
thoughts and pursuits of thinness combined with severe weight loss, along with distorted body
image and intense anxiety around eating (Fairburn et al., 1999). Often, people with AN have a
highly distorted perception of how they look and will continue to try and lose weight even if
their health is at serious risk.
As picky eating is a newly researched phenomenon, there is relatively little research on
picky eating and its associated outcomes in early childhood. The relative lack of literature is
detrimental to early intervention methods as long-term health is linked to nutritional habits that
children display in the early stages of their life, and intervention methods would help stop these
behaviors from turning into psychopathology (Scaglioni et al., 2011). As one in three children
become picky eaters, there needs to be a better understanding of which picky eaters develop
pathology when they are older to mitigate those behaviors (McDermott et al. 2008).
It is essential to differentiate children who are picky eaters and eventually gain better
eating habits versus those who will later develop AN. Through an examination, IQ, and picky
eating behaviors, the current study aims to better understand children at higher risk of developing
AN later in life. Obtaining a better understanding of AN precursors can lead to earlier and more
effective interventions. Eating disorders (ED) are detrimental, as they have high mortality rates

and low recovery rates, so it is important to obtain a better understanding of why this behavior
occurs and what factors are consistent precursors and risk factors of AN. Knowing early markers
and risk factors will ultimately help guide early intervention to mitigate these factors from
turning into a full-blown ED.
Overcontrol and Anorexia Nervosa
The DSM-5 describes AN as an ED where individuals with overvalued ideas about
thinness combined with ritualistic behaviors around food, who fear or engage in persistent
behaviors that interfere with weight gain, despite being a low weight (Brown et al., 2013; Serpell
et al., 2002). Research suggests that AN is a chronic, often severe disorder with a poor prognosis
(Serpell et al., 2002). Additionally, AN is reported to be a familial disorder, where AN
phenotypes are common in family members (Kipman et al., 1999). Many studies have shown a
higher risk for AN in female relatives of probands with AN versus female relatives without
probands (Kipman et al., 1999).
Perfectionism is a prevalent characteristic in both AN and overcontrol (Gilbert et al.,
2019; Dalsgaard et al., 2020). According to The Overcontrol in Youth Checklist (OCYC),
overcontrol in children can be characterized by a pattern of a high need for control,
perfectionism, rigidity, performance monitoring, and social comparison, which is a
transdiagnostic risk factor correlated with psychiatric disorders, including AN. (Gilbert et al.,
2019).
Picky Eating Prevalence
Picky eating is a common childhood characteristic. Mascola et al. (2010) found that 13%
and 20% of children in their study were described as picky eaters at least one point between the
ages of 2 and 11. However, if picky eating behaviors persist, it can pose a severe precursor for an

Picky Eating in Children
5
ED (Zohar et al., 2019). There is no widely accepted definition or characterization of picky
eating and no set diagnostic assessment; there is a wide variety and little consensus of the
prevalence. It is estimated that the “prevalence of picky eating ranges widely from 5.6% in
4-year-olds in the Netherlands (Tharner et al., 2014) to 50% in 2-year-olds in the USA (Carruth
et al., 2004)” (Taylor et al., 2015, p. 352). Since each country has different methods of
assessments and picky eating is under-researched, prevalence is highly unstable, explaining the
different results and outcomes within a study. Results from Taylor et al. showed that early-onset
picky eating was more frequent than late-onset, while only 8% of children were persistent picky
eaters.
Picky Eating and Poor Outcomes
Picky eating can also be associated with poorer well-being. Taylor et al. (2015) explain
that picky eating can eventually lead to adverse health-related outcomes. A four-year follow-up
study conducted by Dahl and Sundelin (1992) showed worse health outcomes for children
classified as picky eaters, as they were at later risk for problems with eating patterns and
behaviors. Dahl and Sundelin (1992) did not focus on why these behaviors happened; rather,
they showed that the trajectory from picky eating to problematic eating behaviors is a major
possibility. In a study conducted in Israel by Zohar and colleagues, 1,055 mothers and children
participated where picky eaters were reported as scoring lower in executive function (2019).
Results showed that at the age of 3, picky eaters displayed a range of behavioral problems with
poorly developed EF (Zohar et al., 2019).
Few studies have been conducted to see if picky eating in childhood can be predictive of
picky eating later in life. McDermott et al. (2008) investigated whether picky eating behaviors
persisted later in life if the child was reported to be a picky eater in preschool. Results showed a

Picky Eating in Children

main effect of a mother’s diagnosis of AN and child picky eating. More specifically, this study
focused on external factors that impinge upon the child’s irregular eating, such as maternal health
perception and parental views on the child. Internal, cognitive factors were not investigated,
which will be researched in the current study. Results showed trends of the risk of picky eating in
preschool and stability with anorexia symptoms in adolescence predicted by earlier digestive
problems and picky eating (McDermott et al., 2008). The research included intervention
strategies that should “be family orientated and include child, mother, and mother-child
psychosocial approaches” (McDermott et al., 2008, p. 204). It was also acknowledged that very
little is known about predictors of picky eating, so it is still necessary to identify predictors to
further interventions to prevent irregular eating from turning into AN. Additionally, this study
was part of a large cohort study in Australia, which provides a strong background, but is not
entirely applicable to the United States since an appropriate assessment measure should consider
country-specific reference values (Taylor et al., 2015). Another limitation is that this study did
not account for a child’s verbal IQ or developmental delays.
It is important to also understand how early picky eating can be classified, and when it
starts to impact cognitive domains. Chatoor et al. (2004) found children who are more
malnourished due to refusal to eat perform poorer cognitively. A study conducted in 2015 by
Cano et al. studied nearly 4,000 children starting at 18 months, assessing them every 18 months
until seven years old. The participants were placed in one of four categories: Children who were
never picky eaters (51.4%); those who went through an early, transient phase of pickiness
(31.9%); those who were consistently picky at each time point (5.5%) and those who were first
described as picky at six years of age (“late-onset,” 4.7%) (Cano et al., 2015). An additional
6.5% of the participants were not classified into one of the four trajectories and were not

Picky Eating in Children

included. Results showed that children in the transient and “late-onset” picky eating categories
were not at an increased risk and were developmentally normal (Cano et al., 2015). However,
children who were early and persistent picky eaters “were at increased risk of
attention/hyperactivity behavioral problems, of oppositional behavior, and their risk for
pervasive developmental delayed behavior problems was double that of children who were never
picky eaters” (Zohar et al., 2019, p. 1250; Cano et al., 2016). More specifically, the persistent
picky eaters were more at risk for ED, especially with emotional control and shifting. Cano et
al.’s (2015 & 2016) study is more closely related to the current study but still lacks the
component of AN development. There is still no research on the interconnectedness of AN with
EF, IQ, and picking eating. The current study will take Cano’s study one step further to see if AN
is associated with IQ and EF deficits that parallel picky eating.
Picky eating is clearly associated with bad outcomes, but the health-related outcomes are
scarcely researched. Zucker et al. (2015) examined the clinical significance of picky eating in
relation to current psychiatric symptoms and risk factors of later psychiatric symptoms, as well
as highlighted the significance of the prevalence of picky eating in preschool. Results showed
that since picky eating in preschoolers was extremely prevalent, 14-20% of parents reported their
preschoolers as picky eating; it was often dismissed as developmentally normal among clinicians
and researchers (Zucker et al., 2015). However, this information is critical, because it has been
associated with emotional, physical, and social impairments (Zucker et al., 2015). Due to the
limited research on picky eating, there is also not a clear consensus of whether picky eating is an
early marker or risk factor for AN (Taylor et al., 2015). The current study aims to distinguish
between picky eaters to determine which child will continue to be persistent picky eaters and
therefore be more at risk for AN later in life.

Intelligence Quotient and Executive Functioning in Anorexia Nervosa
Previous literature has established that executive functioning (EF) and a higher
intelligence quotient (IQ) are connected to AN (Kothari et al., 2013). EF refers to a set of
neurocognitive processes essential for behavioral and cognitive regulation and include inhibition,
working memory, cognitive flexibility, goal selection, planning, and organization
(Aarnoudse-Moens et al., 2009; Aarnoudse-Moens et al., 2012). There is still not a clear
relationship in the literature that incorporates picky eating along with these established
precursors. Research on eating disorders (ED) from a developmental perspective is minimal,
creating a gap in the literature on research addressing data on the specific risk factors and
resilience factors for pathology during childhood development (Steiner & Lock, 1998).
Growing evidence suggests that ED, including AN, can be characterized by particular
neuropsychological profiles, along with IQ and EF (Zakzanis et al., 2010; Kothari et al., 2013;
Lopez et al., 2010). More specifically, past research on the cognitive profiles of patients with AN
showed impairments in specific executive functions, including attention (Ranseen & Humphries,
1992; Dobson & Dozois, 2004; Kothari et al., 2013), cognitive flexibility (Tchanturia et al. 2011;
Tchanturia, 2012; Kothari et al., 2013), problem-solving (Shallice, 1982), and inhibition
(Southgate, 2005; Rosval et al. 2006; Galimberti et al. 2012; Kothari et al., 2013). However,
there are still inconsistent findings, with results showing no differences in EF for ED samples
(Pieters et al., 2003; Gillberg et al., 2007; Galderisi et al., 2011). Where working memory can be
referred to as the cognitive process that stores and manipulates a limited amount of information
over a brief period (Baddeley, 1987, 1992). EF, and individual differences in EF, emerges in
infancy (Blankenship et al., 2019), and deficits in EF reported in preschoolers had impairments

Picky Eating in Children
9
independent of IQ and processing speed, showing the EF can occur before the onset of AN
(Aarnoudse-Moens et al., 2012).
As IQ and EF are impacted by AN, a study was conducted to evaluate the extent that
students with AN differed from their peers academically. Dalsgaard et al. (2020) conducted a
study in Denmark to compare students' academic performances with and without a psychological
disorder. Results showed that students with AN "achieved statistically significantly higher grades
on the final examination" compared to peers without AN (Dalsgaard et al., 2020, p. E1). Students
who were diagnosed with AN had the highest grades compared to all peers, including those
without AN. These findings correspond with previous research that found that high levels of
perfectionism is characteristic of AN that correlates with higher academic achievement
(Dalsgaard et al., 2020). Results are consistent with Lopez et al. (2010) finding that showed that
patients with AN scored significantly higher than healthy controls on IQ tests.
It is also important to understand the timeline of the neuropsychological impairments
found in ED. Kothari et al. (2013) conducted a study to explore if neuropsychological
functioning impairments found in individuals with ED were present prior to the onset of the ED
or secondary to the ED. Intelligence, attention, working memory, and inhibition were measured
in both children who are at high risk of developing an ED, compared to children who are not
(Kothari et al., 2013). Results showed the children whose mothers have AN showed higher IQ,
increased working memory capacity, better visual-spatial functioning, and decreased attentional
control, which might be "intermediate phenotypes on the pathway between genetic vulnerability
and the development of an ED" (Kothari et al., 2013, p. 1). Results were inconsistent with
previous research where children of AN mothers showed better performance in interpreting and

Picky Eating in Children
10
organizing visually perceived materials, whereas previous research suggests that this quality is
impaired in individuals with AN (Lopez et al., 2008b; Kothari et al., 2013).
Furthermore, the results were inconsistent with previous findings which showed no
impairment in working memory for high-risk groups. Children at-risk for an ED scored higher
for working memory, which was only partially accounted for by maternal education and child IQ
(Ohrmann et al., 2004; Kemps et al., 2006). The rationale is that working memory impairment
contributes to the maintenance of the ED, rather than being a pre-onset risk factor (Kothari et al.,
2013). Kothari and colleagues explain that further clarification of neuropsychological profiles is
needed for those at high risk of developing an ED to identify vulnerable indications and target
effective interventions. Overall, these findings indicate that high IQ, worse attentional control,
and decreased inhibition are risk factors for AN. However, previous research on subjects’
cognitive profiles with EDs has revealed impairments in attention and specific EFs, including
cognitive flexibility and inhibition (Taylor et al., 2015). No research has associated picky eating
behaviors with these cognitive deficits. This study emphasizes the importance of including a
younger sample, so AN cannot be present, to ensure behaviors are not a result of the EDs but
rather a precursor.
The Current Study
Sometimes showing signs of picky eating, high IQ, and low EF does not lead to an ED,
so a clearer understanding of why only sometimes these behaviors manifest into an ED is
needed. Again, there are relatively no studies about picky eating in children or combined with IQ
and EF, and there is minimal data about early risk factors of AN. Picky eating is very broad and
develops and changes as children grow up. The current study aims to find if there is a way to
better predict the children who are picky eaters and eventually develop an ED. I aim to examine

Picky Eating in Children
11
associations in children’s EF behaviors to see if there is a similar pattern between picky eating
and pre-established neuropsychological profiles. This information will help determine if the
combination of behaviors can be a stronger predictor of AN.
Based on past research, I hypothesize that children who are parent-reported picky eaters
will have higher IQs (Dalsgaard et al., 2020; Kothari et al., 2013) and demonstrate poor EF
abilities related to inhibition and attentional control but higher working memory (Zohar et al.,
2019; Cano et al., 2015; Kothari et al., 2013). I hypothesize that children who are picky eaters
and have the highest IQ and low EF will continue to exhibit picky eating at Time 2. More
specifically, children with high IQ, low EF, six years old as picky eaters will be at higher risk of
developing AN. It is important to note that we will not draw diagnostic conclusions from this
study because we do not have longitudinal data to see if the children eventually develop AN.
Methods
Participants
Participants were first recruited when they were 5 or 6 years old, with a mean age of the
child at baseline 5.90 (N= 111, SD=0.63)). The sample consisted of 54 females and 57 males
with 74.8% of children identifying as White. The community sample from the St. Louis area was
oversampled for children with overcontrol tendencies, along with perfectionism, self-criticism,
and shyness. Healthy and overcontrolled children were recruited through flyers around the
community, online platforms, and information talks at local elementary schools and childhood
anxiety therapy clinics. Participants then completed a two-year follow-up assessment when the
kids are 7 or 8 years. The current study had 33 children at the follow-up assessment when the
analysis for T2 was conducted (mean age: 8.97, SD = 0.64). Children with Autism Spectrum

Picky Eating in Children
12
Disorder, chronic medical, neurological disorders, speech, language or cognitive delays or
learning disabilities, and current psychotropic medication use were excluded from the study.
Participants who met the criteria signed informed consent and child assent before
partaking in the study. Caregivers completed a series of questionnaires and clinical interviews.
Children and caregivers were invited into the lab where cognitive assessments,
electroencephalogram (EEG), and parent-child interactions were conducted. All assessments are
part of a larger study focused on young children with overcontrolled tendencies. The larger study
consisted of 134 caregiver-child participants, and 110 of these caregivers filled out the picky
eating questionnaire. These 110 caregiver-child participants were included in the current study.
The majority of the sample identified as White (n=83; 75.5%), 11 (10%) identified as Black, 14
(13%) as Multiracial, and 7 (6%) as Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity. The sample included 53 (48%)
females. The Institutional Review Board at Washington University School of Medicine approved
all procedures. The current stresses the importance of understanding the level of severity in
which picky eating causes impairments, so clinicians know when to intervene to mitigate the
effects of these behaviors from turning into pathology later in life.
Measures
Picky Eating Measure. Picky Eating was measured through a parent questionnaire as
part of a psychiatric interview where the parents were asked questions about their child’s eating
behavior. A series of three questions were asked: Is your child a picky eater? Does your child eat
a wide variety of foods? Does your child enjoy eating new foods? Parents were asked to rate
their agreement with the questions on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). Codes were
reversed for the second and third questions, and then scores were summed to create a picky
eating score. A higher score indicated more severe picky eating, where a lower score indicated

Picky Eating in Children
13
low or no picky eating. The three items asked were part of a Nine Item Avoidant/Restrictive
Food Intake disorder screen. The three-item portion of the Stanford Feeding Questionnaire was
used to identify persistent picky eaters (Mascola et al., 2010; Stunkard et al., 1985).
Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (KBIT-II). The KBIT second edition is an IQ scale
that measured verbal and nonverbal intelligence during school age (Cohen et al., 2018).
Shape School. The Shape School is a storybook test that measures inhibition and
switching processes using three conditions: the control, inhibition, and switching condition.
(Aarnoudse-Moens et al., 2009; Espy, 1997). All conditions started with an initial practice block
of 12 stimuli, where participants had to respond correctly to ensure they understood the new
rules before proceeding to the experimental trial. Children were asked to point to the shapes
depending on the rule and condition given at each trial. Children were given instructions at the
start of each experimental trial to complete the task as fast as they can without making any
mistakes. Children experienced all three conditions, where the control condition asked the child
to name all of the shapes’ colors in the order presented in the book. In the inhibition condition,
the child had to name the shapes that had a happy face, as opposed to a sad face. Finally, the
child was presented with the switching condition where they were asked to name the shape only
if they were wearing a hat and smiling (rule from the previous condition). The current study
measured the number of correct responses and response time for all three conditions.
Behavior Rating Inventory for Executive Function (BRIEF), Behavior Rating
Inventory for Executive Function- Preschool (BRIEF-P). The BRIEF and the BRIEF-P were
utilized to measure EF, where parents completed the BRIEF-P for their children younger than six
years old, and the BRIEF was completed by parents, for children who are six years old or older.
The parent-reported measure is an 86-item, well-validated rating scale (α = .98) of their child’s

Picky Eating in Children
14
behavioral manifestations of EF, scored on a 3-point scale from never, sometimes, and often,
where higher scores indicated more significant impairment (Hawkey et al., 2018). Overlapping
subscales of this measure included inhibitory control (Inhibition), cognitive and behavioral
flexibility (Shifting), emotional regulation (Emotional control), working memory (Working
memory), and ability to plan and organize cognition and problem-solving (Plan/organize) (Gioia
et al., 2002; Zohar et al., 2019).
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox. The NIH Toolbox measures cognitive,
emotional, motor, and sensory function. The current study uses the cognition domain and
attention domain. The measurement of cognition evaluates executive functioning through the
Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test and NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort
Test, with a specific focus on spatial attention. The NIH toolbox focuses on shifting and
inhibiting automatic responses that can interfere with achieving a goal. The NIH Toolbox
measures attention through the Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test. The NIH Toolbox
Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test (Flanker) measures attention and inhibitory
control. It requires a participant to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to other
stimuli (fish for ages 3-7 or arrows for ages 8-85). Trials include congruent “flankers” where the
middle stimulus points in the same direction and incongruent “flankers” where the middle
stimulus points in the opposite direction. Participants are given twenty trials, and if children aged
3-7 score at least 90% correct on the fish stimuli, they are presented with additional trials using
arrows. The test takes around three minutes. The NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort
Test is a measure of cognitive flexibility and attention shifting. Participants are presenting with
two target pictures along with two denominations (e.g., shape and color). Subjects are then asked
to match a series of bivalent test pictures  (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target

Picky Eating in Children
15
pictures, first according to one dimension and then, after a number of trials, according to the
other dimension. “Switch” trials are also conducted, where the participant must change the
dimension being matched. This test takes approximately four minutes to administer (Slotkin et
al., 2012). The total score and number of trials were measured for both tasks.
Results
Picky Eating was not associated with demographic variables: picky eating was not
correlated with age (r=.14, p=.14), it did not differ by sex, (t(108)=.14, p=.89) and it did not
differ by race (t(108)=-.49, p=.63) comparing White versus Minority participants, and so these
variables were not used as covariates. An SPSS analysis was used to run Pearson correlations of
Picky Eating at baseline with BRIEF, NIH Toolbox (card sort and flanker), Shape School
(efficiency scores), and KBIT. See Table 1 for correlations between Picky Eating scores with
Executive Function (BRIEF), Cognition and Attention (NIH Toolbox), Inhibition and Switching
processes (Shape School), and IQ (KBIT).
BRIEF Results
Picky Eating showed no significant correlation with BRIEF-Preschool Inhibit T-Score
(r=.14, p =.16) and no significance for BRIEF-Preschool Emotional Control T-Score (r=.11,
p=.27). There was a significant positive correlation between Picky Eating at baseline and
BRIEF-Preschool Shift T-Score (r=.24, p=.01), BRIEF-Preschool Plan/Organize T-Score (r=.91,
p=.047), and BRIEF-Preschool Working Memory T-Score (r=.22, p=.03).
A regression was run for all BRIEF subscales to predict Picky Eating at baseline since it
was associated with baseline Picky Eating in a few domains. The regression tested which
domains of the BRIEF were most strongly associated with predicting Picky Eating. Only Shifting
in the  BRIEF-Preschool Shift T-Score showed significant results for predicted Picky Eating

16
(F(5,102)=2.01, R=.299, ΔR2 =.09, p=.08; B(SE)=.17(.08), p=.038), while the Plan/Organize
and the Working Memory T-scores were no longer significant (p’s>.05).
NIH Toolbox Results
Additionally, there was no significant correlation between Picky Eating at baseline and
the Card Sort Task (that already adjusts for age in the standardized score) (r=-.02, p=.81).
Additionally, there was no significant correlation for the Flanker Task, (that already adjusts for
age in the standardized score) (r=.10, p=.29).
Shape School Results
The correlation for Picky Eating at baseline and Shape School was examined for
Inhibition Efficiency (the number correct- errors/time), Shift Efficiency (the number correct-
errors/time), and Executive Function Efficiency (the number correct- errors/time). There were no
significant correlations for Inhibition Efficiency (r=-.05, p=.63) or Shift Efficiency (r=.07,
p=.48). There was a significant correlation between Picky Eating at baseline and Executive
Function Efficiency (r=.21, p=.037). In order to understand what aspect of the Executive
Function Efficiency relationship is related to Picky Eating, correlations were run evaluating the
total correct responses and errors responses in this condition. There was no relationship between
total correct responses (r=.11, p=.25), but there was a significant correlation with total errors
(r=-.28, p=.004) in the executive functioning condition. See Figure 1.

KBIT Results
The correlation for Picky Eating at baseline and KBIT scores was not significant (r=.05,
p=.58), N=124. The minimum IQ score was 68, the maximum IQ score was 176, and the average
IQ score was 108.58, SD=14.90.

BRIEF behavior rating inventory for executive functioning
Picky Eating, IQ, and EF predicting PE at T2
To explore the interactive effects of EF with baseline Picky Eating predicting Picky
Eating at Time 2, we completed moderation analyses using the PROCESS macro. Since results
from the BRIEF showed Working Memory, Shift, and Plan/Organize as significant results in the
correlation, those variables were used to examine the moderating role of  EF on baseline Picky
Eating predicting Time 2 Picky Eating. Three separate linear regressions were completed and
none of the interactions were significant when examining moderation using the BRIEF.
Specifically, Shifting (BRIEF) did not moderate the relationship between baseline and Time 2
Picky Eating, F(3, 22)=15.70, R2= .68, p<.001, Interaction: B(SE)=-.00 (.00), t=-.26, p=.79.
Plan/Organize (BRIEF), also did not moderate this relationship, F(3, 22)= 16.06, R2= .68,
p<.001, Interaction: B(SE)=.00 (.01), t=.31, p=.76 nor did the Working Memory (BRIEF) F(3,
22)= 16.56, R2= .69, p<.001, Interaction: B(SE)=.00 (.01), t=.14, p=.89.
Additionally, we also completed a separate linear regression examining the interactive
effects of IQ with baseline Picky Eating predicting Time 2 Picky Eating. The interaction of
baseline Picky Eating and IQ was also not significant, but was trending F(3, 21)= 19.30, R2=
.73, p<.001, Interaction: (B(SE)=.01 (.01), t=1.32, p=.20) in the expected direction. The main
effect of the BRIEF subscale was also not significant p>.76. A figure of the direction of effects
of IQ is included N= 26.

Discussion
Results were inconsistent with the hypothesis and past studies because results did not
show significance in a correlation between high IQ and picky eating (Dalsgaard et al., 2020;
Kothari et al., 2013). Children who were picky eaters did not have a higher IQ. Furthermore, the
results did not align with the hypothesis as there would be a significant correlation between
picky eaters and Attentional Control (NIH Toolbox). Based on past literature, it would be
expected that picky eaters would have impairments in attention as past studies revealed results
that showed deficits,  and other literature found attention control as an established deficit of AN
(Zohar et al., 2019, p. 1250; Cano et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2015). Results also showed
inconsistent with previous findings that showed impairments in inhibition for those with AN
(Taylor et al., 2015, Southgate, 2005; Rosval et al. 2006; Galimberti et al. 2012; Kothari et al.,
2013). In the Shape School task, there were no significant deficits in Inhibition Efficiency or the
BRIEF subscale for Inhibition.

When running the analysis there was a significant correlation between Picky Eating and
Working Memory (BRIEF), where worse Working Memory was associated with high Picky
Eating. Past literature has inconsistent findings where some results found children at risk for an
ED scored higher for working memory, but Kothari et al. found poor working memory as a
contributor to the maintenance of the ED rather than a risk factor (2013). So, the results would be
most consistent with Kothari’s findings. Based on these findings, our results show inconsistent
with the previously stated hypothesis that children who are parent-reported picky eaters will have
higher IQs and demonstrate poor EF abilities related to Inhibition and Attentional Control but
higher Working Memory.
In addition to Working Memory, the BRIEF-P showed significant effects between
Shifting and Plan/Organize, where picky eaters showed deficits in Shifting and Plan/Organize
abilities. Since Planning/Organize and WM was not significant in the regression, it cannot be
concluded that any of those variables are a strong predictor of picky eating. However, deficits in
Shifting was a significant EF predictor of Picky Eating, with results trending in the right
direction. Although not all significant, impairments in Shifting and Plan/Organize were
consistent with past literature (Fowler et al., 2005; Cano et al.’s 2015 & 2016). There was no
significant data to support that children who are picky eaters have deficits in emotional control or
inhibition for the BRIEF-P.
Results also indicated there was no predictive ability that baseline Picky Eating would
predict children who are picky eaters at T2 to have deficits in their post-BRIEF assessments.
Although there was no association with deficits in inhibition, results were trending towards a
lower correlation. It is also important to note the small sample size (N=26) due to the lack of
participants who have yet to complete their post-visit.

Additionally, Shape School results found that children who were picky eaters did not
correlate to deficits in Shifting. However, results found children who were extremely picky
eaters at baseline made fewer errors during the last condition of executive function. When
looking at the distribution of errors, few participants were making errors in general, but children
with extreme Picky Eating made the fewest errors at baseline. This was shown in a negative
correlation, and even though results did not show a strong effect, there was a visible negative
correlation. It is important to note that at baseline children with higher PE made fewer correct
responses, but were also the fastest in RT, which is unrelated to the number of errors, and showed
no association with Inhibition Error. One reasoning for this could be due to the perfectionist
characteristic that embodies people with AN (Gilbert et al., 2019; Dalsgaard et al., 2020).
There was a significant correlation between Picky Eating at baseline and Executive
Function Efficiency. A second correlation was run at baseline to evaluate the errors associated
with the individual measures. There was a significant correlation of Executive Function
Efficiency ((correct answers- errors)/time), as well as a significant correlation at the .01 level for
Executive Functioning Total Errors. There were no significant associations between Picky Eating
and NIH Toolbox conditions. So, children who were reported as picky eaters did not show
significant deficits in Cognitive Flexibility, Attention, or Inhibitory Control.
Results did show that children who were picky eaters at Time 1 were significantly likely
to remain picky eaters at Time 2, where out of all the 36 children who completed their
post-assessment and were picky eaters at age 5 & 6 were also picky eaters at age 7 & 8. This is
important because it is less normal for children to be picky eaters at ages 7 and 8 as it is less
typical for the developmental trajectory of children that age. Usually, children grow out of picky

Picky Eating in Children
23
eating when they are toddlers, but showing persistent picky eating at ages 7 and 8 is more likely
to continue.
Lastly, the hypothesis that children who are picky eaters and have the highest IQ and low
EF will continue to exhibit picky eating at Time 2 was not supported. Although results for IQ
and Picky Eating at baseline and post were not significant, it was trending in the expected
direction. Additionally, like past results reported at T2, it is important to note that the sample size
for this analysis at Time 2 was 25, which resulted in the trend finding. So, the combination of
high IQ and Executive Functioning deficits did not interact to better predict Picky Eating at Time
2. A higher baseline IQ and higher baseline Picky Eating interacted to predict the highest Picky
Eating at Time 2.
Since the study was correlational in nature, we have not able to obtain data from children
past age 8 at this time, so there are no causal conclusions that can be drawn to see if children
with high IQ, low EF, and reported as picky eaters will be at higher risk of developing AN later
in life. Furthermore, results that were found cannot be predictive as assessments were
administered at the same time as picky eating reports, so there is no way to tell which behavior
came first.
Future studies should obtain a more representative sample. In the current study, 74.8% of
children were White. Additionally, the children were oversampled for overcontrol as the data
was used from a larger study. Furthermore, studies should be more longitudinal, testing for AN
later in the child’s life. As results cannot be deemed casual due to the lack of data later in the
child’s life, AN developing later in life was not able to be confirmed. Further limitations of this
study were that only 36 children completed their T2 assessment by the time the analysis of this

Picky Eating in Children
24
study was run. More information could have been gathered making the results more
generalizable as well as providing more data on the trends of these behaviors.
Overall, children might grow out of Picky Eating after they are toddlers, but if at ages 5
and 6 are still not grown out of it, and continue to show picky eating behaviors at ages 7 and 8,
children will most likely continue to show the deficits in EF. Therefore, further longitudinal
research is needed to investigate the effects of picky eating to further understand the pathology
associated as well as the deficits that are correlated with those behaviors and to better understand
the predictive factors of AN. The current study shows some better and some worse outcomes for
children who are picky eaters, but there are still a lot of unanswered questions that need to be
further investigated.
