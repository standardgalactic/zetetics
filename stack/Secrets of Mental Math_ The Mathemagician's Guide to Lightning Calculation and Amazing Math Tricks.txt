Foreword
by Bill Nye (the Science Guy®)
I like to think about the ﬁrst humans, the people who came up
with the idea to count things. They must have noticed right
away that ﬁguring on your ﬁngertips works great. Perhaps Og
(a typical ancient cave guy) or one of his pals or associates said,
“There are one, two, three, four, ﬁve of us here, so we need ﬁve
pieces of fruit.” Later, “Hey, look,” someone must have said (or
grunted), “you can count the number of people at the campﬁre,
the number of birds on a tree, stones in a row, logs for a ﬁre, or
grapes in a bunch, just with your ﬁngers.” It was a great start.
It’s probably also how you came to ﬁrst know numbers.
You’ve probably heard that math is the language of science,
or the language of Nature is mathematics. Well, it’s true. The
more we understand the universe, the more we discover its
mathematical connections. Flowers have spirals that line up
with a special sequence of numbers (called Fibonacci numbers)
that you can understand and generate yourself. Seashells form
in perfect mathematical curves (logarithmic spirals) that come
from a chemical balance. Star clusters tug on one another in a
mathematical dance that we can observe and understand from
millions and even billions of kilometers away.
We have spent centuries discovering the mathematical nature
of Nature. With each discovery, someone had to go through the

math and make sure the numbers were right. Well, Secrets of
Mental Math can help you handle all kinds of numbers. You’ll
get comfortable with calculations in a way that will let you know
some of Nature’s numerical secrets, and who knows where that
might take you?
As you get to know numbers, the answer really is at your
ﬁngertips. That’s not a joke, because that’s where it all begins.
Almost everyone has ten ﬁngers, so our system of mathematics
started with 1 and went to 10. In fact, we call both our num-
bers and our ﬁngers “digits.” Coincidence? Hardly. Pretty
soon, though, our ancestors ran out of ﬁngers. The same thing
has probably happened to you. But we can’t just ignore those
big numbers and (this is a joke) throw up our hands.
We need numbers—they’re part of our lives every day, and in
ways we typically don’t even notice. Think about a conversation
you had with a friend. To call, you needed a phone number, and
the time you spent on the phone was measured in numbers of
hours and minutes. Every date in history, including an impor-
tant one like your birthday, is reckoned with numbers. We even
use numbers to represent ideas that have nothing to do with
counting. What’s your 20? (I.e., Where are you? From the old
police “10” codes, like 10-4 for “yes.”) What’s the 411 on that
gal? (I.e., What’s her background; is she dating anyone? From
the number for telephone information.) People describe one
another in numbers representing height and weight. And, of
course, we all like to know how much money we have or how
much something costs in numbers: dollars, pesos, yuan, rupees,
krona, euros, or yen. Additionally (another joke), this book has
a time-saving section on remembering numbers—and large num-
bers of numbers.
If, for some reason, you’re not crazy about math, read a little
further. Of course I, as the Science Guy, hope you do like math.
Foreword
xii

Well, actually, I hope you love math. But no matter how you feel
about math, hatred or love, I’d bet that you often ﬁnd yourself
just wanting to know the answer right away, without having 
to write down everything carefully and work slowly and dili-
gently—or without even having to stop and grab a calculator.
You want the answer, as we say, “as if by magic.” It turns out
that you can solve or work many, many math problems almost
magically. This book will show you how.
What makes any kind of magic so intriguing and fun is that
the audience seldom knows how the trick is performed. “How
did she do that . . . ?” “I don’t know, but it’s cool.” If you have
an audience, the tricks and shortcuts in Secrets of Mental Math
are a lot like magic. The audience seldom knows how a trick is
performed; they just appreciate it. Notice, though, that in
magic, it’s hardly worth doing if no one is watching. But with
Secrets, knowing how it works doesn’t subtract from the fun (or
pun). When arithmetic is easy, you don’t get bogged down in the
calculating; you can concentrate on the wonderful nature of
numbers. After all, math runs the universe.
Dr. Benjamin got into this business of lightning-fast calculat-
ing just for fun. We have to ﬁgure he impressed his teachers and
classmates. Magicians might make some in their audience think
that they have supernatural powers. Mathemagicians, at ﬁrst,
give the impression that they’re geniuses. Getting people to
notice what you’re doing is an old part of sharing ideas. If
they’re impressed, they’ll probably listen to what you have to
say. So try some “mathemagics.” You may impress your friends,
all right. But you’ll also ﬁnd yourself performing just for your-
self. You’ll ﬁnd you’re able to do problems that you didn’t think
you could. You’ll be impressed . . . with yourself.
Now, counting on your ﬁngers is one thing (one ﬁnger’s
worth). But have you ever found yourself counting out loud or
Foreword
xiii

whispering or making other sounds while you calculate? It
almost always makes math easier. The problem, though, is that
other people think you’re a little odd . . . not even (more math
humor). Well, in Secrets of Mental Math, Dr. Benjamin helps
you learn to use that “out-loud” feature of the way your brain
works to do math problems more easily, faster, and more accu-
rately (which is surprising), all while your brain is thinking
away—almost as if you’re thinking out loud.
You’ll learn to move through math problems the same way
we read in English, left to right. You’ll learn to handle big prob-
lems fast with good guesses, actually great guesses, within a per-
cent or so. You will learn to do arithmetic fast; that way you can
spend your time thinking about what the numbers mean. Og
wondered, “Do we have enough fruit for each person sitting
around the ﬁre? If not, there might be trouble.” Now you might
wonder, “Is there enough space on this computer to keep track
of my music ﬁles . . . or my bank account? If not, there might be
trouble.”
There’s more to Secrets than just ﬁguring. You can learn to
take a day, month, and year, then compute what day of the week
it was or will be. It’s fantastic, almost magical, to be able to tell
someone what day of the week she or he was born. But, it’s
really something to be able to ﬁgure that the United States had
its ﬁrst big Fourth of July on a Thursday in 1776. April 15,
1912, the day the Titanic sank, was a Monday. The ﬁrst human
to walk on the moon set foot there on July 20, 1969, a Sunday.
You’ll probably never forget that the United States was attacked
by terrorists on September 11, 2001. With Secrets of Mental
Math, you’ll always be able to show it was a Tuesday.
There are relationships in Nature that numbers describe bet-
ter than any other way we know. There are simple numbers that
you can count on your hands: one, two, three, and on up. But
Foreword
xiv

there are also an inﬁnite number of numbers in between. There
are fractions. There are numbers that never end. They get as big
as you want and so small that they’re hard to imagine. You can
know them. With Secrets of Mental Math, you can have even
these in-between numbers come so quickly to your mind that
you’ll have a bit more space in your brain to think about why
our world works this way. One way or another, this book will
help you see that in Nature, it all adds up.

Foreword
by James Randi
Mathematics is a wonderful, elegant, and exceedingly useful lan-
guage. It has its own vocabulary and syntax, its own verbs, nouns,
and modiﬁers, and its own dialects and patois. It is used brilliantly
by some, poorly by others. Some of us fear to pursue its more eso-
teric uses, while a few of us wield it like a sword to attack and
conquer income tax forms or masses of data that resist the less
courageous. This book does not guarantee to turn you into a Leib-
niz, or put you on stage as a Professor Algebra, but it will, I hope,
bring you a new, exciting, and even entertaining view of what can
be done with that wonderful invention—numbers.
We all think we know enough about arithmetic to get by, and
we certainly feel no guilt about resorting to the handy pocket
calculator that has become so much a part of our lives. But, just
as photography may blind us to the beauty of a Vermeer paint-
ing, or an electronic keyboard may make us forget the magniﬁ-
cence of a Horowitz sonata, too much reliance on technology
can deny us the pleasures that you will ﬁnd in these pages.
I remember the delight I experienced as a child when I was
shown that I could multiply by 25 merely by adding two 0s to my
number and dividing by 4. Casting out 9s to check multiplication
came next, and when I found out about cross-multiplying I was
hooked and became, for a short while, a generally unbearable

math nut. Immunizations against such afﬂictions are not avail-
able. You have to recover all by yourself. Beware!
This is a fun book. You wouldn’t have it in your hands right
now if you didn’t have some interest either in improving your
math skills or in satisfying a curiosity about this fascinating sub-
ject. As with all such instruction books, you may retain and use
only a certain percentage of the varied tricks and methods
described here, but that alone will make it worth the investment
of your time.
I know both the authors rather well. Art Benjamin is not only
one of those whiz kids we used to groan about in school but
also has been known to tread the boards at the Magic Castle in
Hollywood, performing demonstrations of his skill, and on one
occasion he traveled to Tokyo, Japan, to pit his math skills
against a lady savant on live television. Michael Shermer, with
his specialized knowledge of science, has an excellent overview
of practical applications of math as it is used in the real world.
If this is your ﬁrst exposure to this kind of good math stuff, I
envy you. You’ll discover, as you come upon each delicious new
way to attack numbers, that you missed something in school.
Mathematics, particularly arithmetic, is a powerful and depend-
able tool for day-to-day use that enables us to handle our compli-
cated lives with more assurance and accuracy. Let Art and
Michael show you how to round a few of the corners and cut
through some of the trafﬁc. Remember these words of Dr. Samuel
Johnson, an eminently practical soul in all respects: “Arithemeti-
cal inquiries give entertainment in solitude by the practice, and
reputation in public by the effect.”
Above all, enjoy the book. Let it entertain you, and have fun
with it. That, with the occasional good deed, a slice of pizza (no
anchovies!), and a selection of good friends is about all you can
ask of life. Well, almost all. Maybe a Ferrari . . .

Prologue
by Michael Shermer
My good friend Dr. Arthur Benjamin, mathematics professor at
Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, takes the stage
to a round of applause at the Magic Castle, a celebrated magic
club in Hollywood, where he is about to perform “mathemag-
ics,” or what he calls the art of rapid mental calculation. Art
appears nothing like a mathematics professor from a prestigious
college. Astonishingly quick-witted, he looks at home with the
rest of the young magicians playing at the Castle—which he is.
What makes Art so special is that he can play in front of any
group, including professional mathematicians and magicians,
because he can do something that almost no one else can. Art
Benjamin can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers in his
head faster than most people can with a calculator. He can
square two-digit, three-digit, and four-digit numbers, as well as
ﬁnd square roots and cube roots, without writing anything
down on paper. And he can teach you how to perform your own
mathematical magic.
Traditionally, magicians refuse to disclose how they perform
their tricks. If they did, everyone would know how they are
done and the mystery and fascination of magic would be lost.
But Art wants to get people excited about math. And he knows
that one of the best ways to do so is to let you and other readers

in on his secrets of “math genius.” With these skills, almost any-
one can do what Art Benjamin does every time he gets on stage
to perform his magic.
This particular night at the Magic Castle, Art begins by ask-
ing if anyone in the audience has a calculator. A group of engi-
neers raise their hands and join Art on the stage. Offering to test
their calculators to make sure they work, Art asks a member 
of the audience to call out a two-digit number. “Fifty-seven,”
shouts one. Art points to another who yells out, “Twenty-three.”
Directing his attention to those on stage, Art tells them:
“Multiply 57 by 23 on the calculator and make sure you get
1311 or the calculators are not working correctly.” Art waits
patiently while the volunteers ﬁnish inputting the numbers. As
each participant indicates his calculator reads 1311, the audi-
ence lets out a collective gasp. The amazing Art has beaten the
calculators at their own game!
Art next informs the audience that he will square four two-
digit numbers faster than his button-pushers on stage can
square them on their calculators. The audience asks him to
square the numbers 24, 38, 67, and 97. Then, in large, bold
writing for everyone to see, Art writes: 576, 1444, 4489, 9409.
Art turns to his engineer volunteers, each of whom is computing
a two-digit square, and asks them to call out their answers.
Their response triggers gasps and then applause from the audi-
ence: “576, 1444, 4489, 9409.” The woman next to me sits
with her mouth open in amazement.
Art then offers to square three-digit numbers without even
writing down the answer. “Five hundred and seventy-two,” a
gentleman calls out. Art’s reply comes less than a second later:
“572 squared is 327,184.” He immediately points to another
member of the audience, who yells, “389,” followed by Art’s
unblinking response: “389 squared will give you 151,321.”
Prologue

Someone else blurts out, “262.” “That’ll give you 68,644.” Sens-
ing he delayed just an instant on that last one, he promises to
make up for it on the next number. The challenge comes—991.
With no pause, Art squares the number, “982,081.” Several
more three-digit numbers are given and Art responds perfectly.
Members of the audience shake their heads in disbelief.
With the audience in the palm of his hand, Art now declares
that he will attempt to square a four-digit number. A woman calls
out, “1,036,” and Art instantly responds, “That’s 1,073,296.”
The audience laughs and Art explains, “No, no, that’s much too
easy a number. I’m not supposed to beat the calculators on these.
Let’s try another one.” A man offers a challenging 2,843. Pausing
brieﬂy between digits, Art responds: “Let’s see, the square of that
should be 8 million . . . 82 thousand . . . 649.” He is right, of
course, and the audience roars their approval, as loudly as they
did for the previous magician who sawed a woman in half and
made a dog disappear.
It is the same everywhere Art Benjamin goes, whether it is a
high school auditorium, a college classroom, a professional con-
ference, the Magic Castle, or a television studio. Professor Ben-
jamin has performed his special brand of magic live all over the
country and on numerous television talk shows. He has been the
subject of investigation by a cognitive psychologist at Carnegie
Mellon University and is featured in a scholarly book by Steven
Smith called The Great Mental Calculators: The Psychology,
Methods, and Lives of Calculating Prodigies, Past and Present.
Art was born in Cleveland on March 19, 1961 (which he calcu-
lates was a Sunday, a skill he will teach you in Chapter 9). A
hyperactive child, Art drove his teachers mad with his class-
room antics, which included correcting the mathematical mis-
takes they occasionally made. Throughout this book when
teaching you his mathematical secrets, Art recalls when and
Prologue
xxi

where he learned these skills, so I will save the fascinating sto-
ries for him to tell you.
Art Benjamin is an extraordinary individual with an extraor-
dinary program to teach you rapid mental calculation. I offer
these claims without hesitation, and ask only that you remem-
ber this does not come from a couple of guys promising miracles
if you will only call our 800 hotline. Art and I are both creden-
tialed in the most conservative of academic professions—Art in
mathematics and I, myself, in the history of science—and we
would never risk career embarrassment (or worse) by making
such powerful claims if they were not true. To put it simply, this
stuff works, and virtually everyone can do it because this art of
“math genius” is a learned skill. So you can look forward to
improving your math skills, impressing your friends, enhancing
your memory, and, most of all, having fun!

Introduction
Ever since I was a child, I have loved playing with numbers,
and in this book I hope to share my passion with you. I have
always found numbers to have a certain magical appeal and
spent countless hours entertaining myself and others with their
beautiful properties. As a teenager, I performed as a magician,
and subsequently combined my loves of math and magic into a
full-length show, called Mathemagics, where I would demon-
strate and explain the secrets of rapid mental calculation to
audiences of all ages.
Since earning my PhD, I have taught mathematics at Harvey
Mudd College, and I still enjoy sharing the joy of numbers with
children and adults throughout the world. In this book, I will
share all of my secrets for doing math in your head, quickly and
easily. (I realize that magicians are not supposed to reveal their
secrets, but mathemagicians have a different code of ethics.
Mathematics should be awe inspiring, not mysterious.)
What will you learn from this book? You will learn to do
math in your head faster than you ever thought possible. After a
little practice, you will dramatically improve your memory for
numbers. You will learn feats of mind that will impress your
friends, colleagues, and teachers. But you will also learn to view
math as an activity that can actually be fun.

Too often, math is taught as a set of rigid rules, leaving little
room for creative thinking. But as you will learn from Secrets,
there are often several ways to solve the same problem. Large
problems can be broken down into smaller, more manageable
components. We look for special features to make our problems
easier to solve. These strike me as being valuable life lessons that
we can use in approaching all kinds of problems, mathematical
and otherwise.
“But isn’t math talent something that you are born with?” I
get this question all the time. Many people are convinced that
lightning calculators are prodigiously gifted. Maybe I was born
with some curiosity about how things work, whether it be a
math problem or a magic trick. But I am convinced, based on
many years of teaching experience, that rapid math is a skill that
anyone can learn. And like any worthwhile skill, it takes prac-
tice and dedication if you wish to become an expert. But to
achieve these results efﬁciently, it is important that you practice
the right way. Let me show you the way!
Mathemagically,

Quick Tricks:
Easy (and Impressive) Calculations
In the pages that follow, you will learn to do math in your head
faster than you ever thought possible. After practicing the meth-
ods in this book for just a little while, your ability to work with
numbers will increase dramatically. With even more practice,
you will be able to perform many calculations faster than some-
one using a calculator. But in this chapter, my goal is to teach
you some easy yet impressive calculations you can learn to do
immediately. We’ll save some of the more serious stuff for later.
INSTANT MULTIPLICATION
Let’s begin with one of my favorite feats of mental math—how
to multiply, in your head, any two-digit number by eleven. It’s
very easy once you know the secret. Consider the problem:
32  11
To solve this problem, simply add the digits, 3  2  5, put
the 5 between the 3 and the 2, and there is your answer:

352
What could be easier? Now you try:
53  11
Since 5  3  8, your answer is simply
583
One more. Without looking at the answer or writing any-
thing down, what is
81  11?
Did you get 891? Congratulations!
Now before you get too excited, I have shown you only half
of what you need to know. Suppose the problem is
85  11
Although 8  5  13, the answer is NOT 8135!
As before, the 3 goes in between the numbers, but the 1needs
to be added to the 8 to get the correct answer:
935
Think of the problem this way:

Here is another example. Try 57  11.
Since 5  7  12, the answer is
Okay, now it’s your turn. As fast as you can, what is
77  11?
If you got the answer 847, then give yourself a pat on the
back. You are on your way to becoming a mathemagician.
Now, I know from experience that if you tell a friend or
teacher that you can multiply, in your head, any two-digit num-
ber by eleven, it won’t be long before they ask you to do 99 
11. Let’s do that one now, so we are ready for it.
Since 9  9  18, the answer is:
Okay, take a moment to practice your new skill a few times,
then start showing off. You will be amazed at the reaction you
get. (Whether or not you decide to reveal the secret is up to you!)
Welcome back. At this point, you probably have a few ques-
tions, such as:
“Can we use this method for multiplying three-digit numbers
(or larger) by eleven?”

Absolutely. For instance, for the problem 314  11, the
answer still begins with 3 and ends with 4. Since 3  1  4, and
1  4  5, the answer is 3454. But we’ll save larger problems
like this for later.
More practically, you are probably saying to yourself,
“Well, this is ﬁne for multiplying by elevens, but what about
larger numbers? How do I multiply numbers by twelve, or
thirteen, or thirty-six?”
My answer to that is, Patience! That’s what the rest of the
book is all about. In Chapters 2, 3, 6, and 8, you will learn meth-
ods for multiplying together just about any two numbers. Better
still, you don’t have to memorize special rules for every number.
Just a handful of techniques is all that it takes to multiply num-
bers in your head, quickly and easily.
SQUARING AND MORE
Here is another quick trick.
As you probably know, the square of a number is a number
multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 7 is 7  7  49.
Later, I will teach you a simple method that will enable you to
easily calculate the square of any two-digit or three-digit (or
higher) number. That method is especially simple when the
number ends in 5, so let’s do that trick now.
To square a two-digit number that ends in 5, you need to
remember only two things.
1. The answer begins by multiplying the ﬁrst digit by the next higher
digit.
2. The answer ends in 25.
Secrets of Mental Math
4

For example, to square the number 35, we simply multiply
the ﬁrst digit (3) by the next higher digit (4), then attach 25.
Since 3  4  12, the answer is 1225. Therefore, 35  35 
1225. Our steps can be illustrated this way:
How about the square of 85? Since 8  9  72, we immedi-
ately get 85  85  7225.
We can use a similar trick when multiplying two-digit num-
bers with the same ﬁrst digit, and second digits that sum to 10.
The answer begins the same way that it did before (the ﬁrst
digit multiplied by the next higher digit), followed by the prod-
uct of the second digits. For example, let’s try 83  87. (Both
numbers begin with 8, and the last digits sum to 3  7  10.)
Since 8  9  72, and 3  7  21, the answer is 7221.
83
 87

Quick Tricks: Easy (and Impressive) Calculations

Similarly, 84  86  7224.
Now it’s your turn. Try
26  24
How does the answer begin? With 2  3  6. How does it
end? With 6  4  24. Thus 26  24  624.
Remember that to use this method, the ﬁrst digits have to be
the same, and the last digits must sum to 10. Thus, we can use
this method to instantly determine that
31  39  1209
32  38  1216
33  37  1221
34  36  1224
35  35  1225
You may ask,
“What if the last digits do not sum to ten? Can we use this
method to multiply twenty-two and twenty-three?”
Well, not yet. But in Chapter 8, I will show you an easy way to
do problems like this using the close-together method. (For 22 
23, you would do 20  25 plus 2  3, to get 500  6  506, but
I’m getting ahead of myself!) Not only will you learn how to use
these methods, but you will understand why these methods
work, too.
“Are there any tricks for doing mental addition and
subtraction?”
Deﬁnitely, and that is what the next chapter is all about. If I
were forced to summarize my method in three words, I would
say, “Left to right.” Here is a sneak preview.

Consider the subtraction problem
Most people would not like to do this problem in their head
(or even on paper!), but let’s simplify it. Instead of subtracting
587, subtract 600. Since 1200  600  600, we have that
But we have subtracted 13 too much. (We will explain how to
quickly determine the 13 in Chapter 1.) Thus, our painful-
looking subtraction problem becomes the easy addition problem
which is not too hard to calculate in your head (especially from
left to right). Thus, 1241  587  654.
Using a little bit of mathematical magic, described in Chapter
9, you will be able to instantly compute the sum of the ten num-
bers below.

Although I won’t reveal the magical secret right now, here is
a hint. The answer, 935, has appeared elsewhere in this chapter.
More tricks for doing math on paper will be found in Chapter
6. Furthermore, you will be able to quickly give the quotient of
the last two numbers:
359  222  1.61 (ﬁrst three digits)
We will have much more to say about division (including dec-
imals and fractions) in Chapter 4.
MORE PRACTICAL TIPS
Here’s a quick tip for calculating tips. Suppose your bill at a
restaurant came to $42, and you wanted to leave a 15% tip.
First we calculate 10% of $42, which is $4.20. If we cut that
number in half, we get $2.10, which is 5% of the bill. Adding
these numbers together gives us $6.30, which is exactly 15% of
the bill. We will discuss strategies for calculating sales tax, dis-
counts, compound interest, and other practical items in Chapter
5, along with strategies that you can use for quick mental esti-
mation when an exact answer is not required.
IMPROVE YOUR MEMORY
In Chapter 7, you will learn a useful technique for memorizing
numbers. This will be handy in and out of the classroom. Using
an easy-to-learn system for turning numbers into words, you
will be able to quickly and easily memorize any numbers: dates,
phone numbers, whatever you want.
Speaking of dates, how would you like to be able to ﬁgure
out the day of the week of any date? You can use this to ﬁgure

out birth dates, historical dates, future appointments, and so on.
I will show you this in more detail later, but here is a simple way
to ﬁgure out the day of January 1 for any year in the twenty-ﬁrst
century. First familiarize yourself with the following table.
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday

7 or 0
For instance, let’s determine the day of the week of January 1,
2030. Take the last two digits of the year, and consider it to be
your bill at a restaurant. (In this case, your bill would be $30.)
Now add a 25% tip, but keep the change. (You can compute
this by cutting the bill in half twice, and ignoring any change.
Half of $30 is $15. Then half of $15 is $7.50. Keeping the
change results in a $7 tip.) Hence your bill plus tip amounts to
$37. To ﬁgure out the day of the week, subtract the biggest mul-
tiple of 7 (0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, . . .) from your total, and
that will tell you the day of the week. In this case, 37  35  2,
and so January 1, 2030, will occur on 2’s day, namely Tuesday:

Exception: If the year is a leap year, remove $1 from your tip,
then proceed as before. For example, for January 1, 2032, a 25%
tip of $32 would be $8. Removing one dollar gives a total of
32  7  39. Subtracting the largest multiple of 7 gives us 39 
35  4. So January 1, 2032, will be on 4’s day, namely Thursday.
For more details that will allow you to compute the day of the
week of any date in history, see Chapter 9. (In fact, it’s perfectly
okay to read that chapter ﬁrst!)
I know what you are wondering now:
“Why didn’t they teach this to us in school?”
I’m afraid that there are some questions that even I cannot

Chapter 1
A Little Give and Take:
Mental Addition and Subtraction
For as long as I can remember, I have always found it easier to add
and subtract numbers from left to right instead of from right to
left. By adding and subtracting numbers this way, I found that I
could call out the answers to math problems in class well before my
classmates put down their pencils. And I didn’t even need a pencil!
In this chapter you will learn the left-to-right method of
doing mental addition and subtraction for most numbers that
you encounter on a daily basis. These mental skills are not only
important for doing the tricks in this book but are also indis-
pensable in school, at work, or any time you use numbers. Soon
you will be able to retire your calculator and use the full capac-
ity of your mind as you add and subtract two-digit, three-digit,
and even four-digit numbers with lightning speed.
LEFT-TO-RIGHT ADDITION
Most of us are taught to do math on paper from right to left.
And that’s ﬁne for doing math on paper. But if you want to do

math in your head (even faster than you can on paper) there are
many good reasons why it is better to work from left to right.
After all, you read numbers from left to right, you pronounce
numbers from left to right, and so it’s just more natural to think
about (and calculate) numbers from left to right. When you
compute the answer from right to left (as you probably do on
paper), you generate the answer backward. That’s what makes
it so hard to do math in your head. Also, if you want to esti-
mate your answer, it’s more important to know that your
answer is “a little over 1200” than to know that your answer
“ends in 8.” Thus, by working from left to right, you begin with
the most signiﬁcant digits of your problem. If you are used to
working from right to left on paper, it may seem unnatural to
work with numbers from left to right. But with practice you will
ﬁnd that it is the most natural and efﬁcient way to do mental
calculations.
With the ﬁrst set of problems—two-digit addition—the left-
to-right method may not seem so advantageous. But be patient.
If you stick with me, you will see that the only easy way to solve
three-digit and larger addition problems, all subtraction prob-
lems, and most deﬁnitely all multiplication and division prob-
lems is from left to right. The sooner you get accustomed to
computing this way, the better.
Two-Digit Addition
Our assumption in this chapter is that you know how to add
and subtract one-digit numbers. We will begin with two-digit
addition, something I suspect you can already do fairly well in
your head. The following exercises are good practice, however,
because the two-digit addition skills that you acquire here will
be needed for larger addition problems, as well as virtually all
Secrets of Mental Math
12

multiplication problems in later chapters. It also illustrates a
fundamental principle of mental arithmetic—namely, to sim-
plify your problem by breaking it into smaller, more manage-
able parts. This is the key to virtually every method you will
learn in this book. To paraphrase an old saying, there are three
components to success—simplify, simplify, simplify.
The easiest two-digit addition problems are those that do not
require you to carry any numbers, when the ﬁrst digits sum to 9
or below and the last digits sum to 9 or below. For example:
(30  2)
To solve 47  32, ﬁrst add 30, then add 2. After adding 30,
you have the simpler problem 77  2, which equals 79. We
illustrate this as follows:
47  32

77  2

79
(ﬁrst add 30)
(then add 2)
The above diagram is simply a way of representing the men-
tal processes involved in arriving at an answer using our
method. While you need to be able to read and understand such
diagrams as you work your way through this book, our method
does not require you to write down anything yourself.
Now let’s try a calculation that requires you to carry a number:
(20  8)
Adding from left to right, you can simplify the problem by
adding 67  20  87; then 87  8  95.

Now try one on your own, mentally calculating from left to
right, and then check below to see how we did it:
(50  7)
How was that? You added 84  50  134 and added 
134  7  141.
84  57

134  7

141
(ﬁrst add 50)
(then add 7)
If carrying numbers trips you up a bit, don’t worry about it.
This is probably the ﬁrst time you have ever made a systematic
attempt at mental calculation, and if you’re like most people, it
will take you time to get used to it. With practice, however, you
will begin to see and hear these numbers in your mind, and car-
rying numbers when you add will come automatically. Try
another problem for practice, again computing it in your mind
ﬁrst, then checking how we did it:
(40  5)
You should have added 68  40  108, and then 108  5 
113, the ﬁnal answer. Was that easier? If you would like to try
your hand at more two-digit addition problems, check out the
set of exercises below. (The answers and computations are at

Three-Digit Addition
The strategy for adding three-digit numbers is the same as for
adding two-digit numbers: you add from left to right. After each
step, you arrive at a new (and simpler) addition problem. Let’s
try the following:
(300  20  7)
Starting with 538, we add 300, then add 20, then add 7. After
adding 300 (538  300  838), the problem becomes 838  27.
After adding 20 (838  20  858), the problem simpliﬁes to
858  7  865. This thought process can be diagrammed as
follows:
538  327

838  27

858  7

865
 300
 20
 7
All mental addition problems can be done by this method.
The goal is to keep simplifying the problem until you are just
adding a one-digit number. Notice that 538  327 requires you
to hold on to six digits in your head, whereas 838  27 and

858  7 require only ﬁve and four digits, respectively. As you
simplify the problem, the problem gets easier!
Try the following addition problem in your mind before
looking to see how we did it:
(100  50  9)
Did you reduce and simplify the problem by adding left to
right? After adding the hundreds (623  100  723), you were
left with 723  59. Next you should have added the tens (723 
50  773), simplifying the problem to 773  9, which you then
summed to get 782. Diagrammed, the problem looks like this:
623  159

723  59

773  9

782
 100
 50
 9
When I do these problems mentally, I do not try to see the
numbers in my mind—I try to hear them. I hear the problem
623  159 as six hundred twenty-three plus one hundred ﬁfty-
nine; by emphasizing the word hundred to myself, I know where
to begin adding. Six plus one equals seven, so my next problem
is seven hundred and twenty-three plus ﬁfty-nine, and so on.
When ﬁrst doing these problems, practice them out loud. Rein-
forcing yourself verbally will help you learn the mental method
much more quickly.
Three-digit addition problems really do not get much harder
than the following:
858
 634

623
 159

Secrets of Mental Math
16

Now look to see how we did it:
858  634

1458  34

1488  4

1492
 600
 30
 4
At each step I hear (not see) a “new” addition problem. In my
mind the problem sounds like this:
858 plus 634 is 1458 plus 34 is 1488 plus 4 is 1492.
Your mind-talk may not sound exactly like mine (indeed, you
might “see” the numbers instead of “hear” them), but whatever
it is you say or visualize to yourself, the point is to reinforce the
numbers along the way so that you don’t forget where you are
and have to start the addition problem over again.
Let’s try another one for practice:
(400  90  6)
Do it in your mind ﬁrst, then check our computation below:
759  496

1159  96

1249  6

1255
 400
 90
 6
This addition problem is a little more difﬁcult than the last
one since it requires you to carry numbers in all three steps.
However, with this particular problem you have the option of
using an alternative method. I am sure you will agree that it is a
759
 496

A Little Give and Take: Mental Addition and Subtraction
17

lot easier to add 500 to 759 than it is to add 496, so try adding
500 and then subtracting the difference:
(500  4)
759  496

1259  4

1255
(ﬁrst add 500)
(then subtract 4)
So far, you have consistently broken up the second number in
any problem to add to the ﬁrst. It really does not matter which
number you choose to break up, but it is good to be consistent.
That way, your mind will never have to waste time deciding
which way to go. If the second number happens to be a lot sim-
pler than the ﬁrst, I sometimes switch them around, as in the fol-
lowing example:
207  528

528  207

728  7

735
(switch)
 200
 7
Let’s ﬁnish up by adding three-digit to four-digit numbers.
Since most human memory can hold only about seven or eight
digits at a time, this is about as large a problem as you can handle
without resorting to artiﬁcial memory devices, like ﬁngers, calcu-
lators, or the mnemonics taught in Chapter 7. In many addition
problems that arise in practice, especially within multiplication
problems, one or both of the numbers will end in 0, so we shall
emphasize those types of problems. We begin with an easy one:
2700
 567

207
 528

759
 496

Secrets of Mental Math
18

Since 27 hundred  5 hundred is 32 hundred, we simply
attach the 67 to get 32 hundred and 67, or 3267. The process is
the same for the following problems:
Because 40  18  58, the ﬁrst answer is 3258. For the sec-
ond problem, since 40  72 exceeds 100, you know the answer
will be 33 hundred and something. Because 40  72  112, the
answer is 3312.
These problems are easy because the (nonzero) digits overlap
in only one place, and hence can be solved in a single step.
Where digits overlap in two places, you require two steps. For
instance:
(100  71)
This problem requires two steps, as diagrammed the follow-
ing way:
4560  171

4660  71

Carl Friedrich Gauss: Mathematical Prodigy
A
prodigy is a highly talented child, usually called precocious or
gifted, and almost always ahead of his peers.The German math-
ematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) was one such child. He
often boasted that he could calculate before he could speak. By the
ripe old age of three, before he had been taught any arithmetic, he
corrected his father’s payroll by declaring “the reckoning is wrong.” A
further check of the numbers proved young Carl correct.
As a ten-year-old student,Gauss was presented the following math-
ematical problem:What is the sum of numbers from 1 to 100? While
his fellow students were frantically calculating with paper and pencil,
Gauss immediately envisioned that if he spread out the numbers 1
through 50 from left to right,and the numbers 51 to 100 from right to
left directly below the 1–50 numbers,each combination would add up
to 101 (1  100,2  99,3  98, . . .).Since there were ﬁfty sums,the
answer would be 101  50  5050.To the astonishment of everyone,
including the teacher, young Carl got the answer not only ahead of
everyone else, but computed it entirely in his mind. He wrote out the
answer on his slate, and ﬂung it on the teacher’s desk with a deﬁant
“There it lies.” The teacher was so impressed that he invested his own
money to purchase the best available textbook on arithmetic and gave
it to Gauss, stating,“He is beyond me, I can teach him nothing more.”
Indeed, Gauss became the mathematics teacher of others, and
eventually went on to become one of the greatest mathematicians in
history, his theories still used today in the service of science. Gauss’s
desire to better understand Nature through the language of mathe-
matics was summed up in his motto, taken from Shakespeare’s King
Lear (substituting “laws” for “law”):“Thou, nature, art my goddess; to
thy laws/My services are bound.”

LEFT-TO-RIGHT SUBTRACTION
For most of us, it is easier to add than to subtract. But if you con-
tinue to compute from left to right and to break down problems
into simpler components, subtraction can become almost as easy
as addition.
Two-Digit Subtraction
When subtracting two-digit numbers, your goal is to simplify
the problem so that you are reduced to subtracting (or adding) a
one-digit number. Let’s begin with a very simple subtraction
problem:
(20  5)
After each step, you arrive at a new and easier subtraction
problem. Here, we ﬁrst subtract 20 (86  20  66) then we
subtract 5 to reach the simpler subtraction problem 66  5 for
your ﬁnal answer of 61. The problem can be diagrammed this
way:

Of course, subtraction problems are considerably easier
when there is no borrowing (which occurs when a larger digit is
being subtracted from a smaller one). But the good news is that
“hard” subtraction problems can usually be turned into “easy”
addition problems. For example:
(20  9) or (30  1)
There are two different ways to solve this problem mentally:
1. First subtract 20, then subtract 9:
86  29

66  9

57
(ﬁrst subtract 20)
(then subtract 9)
But for this problem, I would prefer the following strategy:
2. First subtract 30, then add back 1:
86  29

56  1

57
(ﬁrst subtract 30)
(then add 1)
Here is the rule for deciding which method to use: If a two-
digit subtraction problem would require borrowing, then round
the second number up (to a multiple of ten). Subtract the
rounded number, then add back the difference.
For example, the problem 54  28 would require borrowing
(since 8 is greater than 4), so round 28 up to 30, compute 54 
30  24, then add back 2 to get 26 as your ﬁnal answer:
(30  2)

Now try your hand (or head) at 81  37. Since 7 is greater
than 1, we round 37 up to 40, subtract it from 81 (81  40 
41), then add back the difference of 3 to arrive at the ﬁnal
answer:
81  37

Three-Digit Subtraction
Now let’s try a three-digit subtraction problem:
(400  10  7)
This particular problem does not require you to borrow any
numbers (since every digit of the second number is less than the
digit above it), so you should not ﬁnd it too hard. Simply sub-
tract one digit at a time, simplifying as you go.

Now try one yourself:
Did you ﬁrst subtract 700 from 853? If so, did you get 853 

back 8 to reach 161, the ﬁnal answer?

Now, I admit we have been making life easier for you by sub-
tracting numbers that were close to a multiple of 100. (Did you
notice?) But what about other problems, like:

If you subtract one digit at a time, simplifying as you go, your
sequence will look like this:

325  68

265  8

What happens if you round up to 500?

Subtracting 500 is easy: 725  500  225. But you have sub-
tracted too much. The trick is to ﬁgure out exactly how much
too much.
At ﬁrst glance, the answer is far from obvious. To ﬁnd it, you
need to know how far 468 is from 500. The answer can be
found by using “complements,” a nifty technique that will make
many three-digit subtraction problems a lot easier to do.
Using Complements (You’re Welcome!)
Quick, how far from 100 are each of these numbers?

to 10. We say that 43 is the complement of 57, 32 is the com-
plement of 68, and so on.
Now you ﬁnd the complements of these two-digit numbers:
37
59
93
44
08
To ﬁnd the complement of 37, ﬁrst ﬁgure out what you need
to add to 3 in order to get 9. (The answer is 6.) Then ﬁgure out
what you need to add to 7 to get 10. (The answer is 3.) Hence,
63 is the complement of 37.
The other complements are 41, 7, 56, 92. Notice that, like
everything else you do as a mathemagician, the complements
are determined from left to right. As we have seen, the ﬁrst dig-
its add to 9, and the second digits add to 10. (An exception
occurs in numbers ending in 0—e.g., 30  70  100—but those
complements are simple!)
What do complements have to do with mental subtraction?
Well, they allow you to convert difﬁcult subtraction problems
into straightforward addition problems. Let’s consider the last
subtraction problem that gave us some trouble:
(500  32)
To begin, you subtracted 500 instead of 468 to arrive at 225
(725  500  225). But then, having subtracted too much, you
needed to ﬁgure out how much to add back. Using complements
gives you the answer in a ﬂash. How far is 468 from 500? The
same distance as 68 is from 100. If you ﬁnd the complement of
68 the way we have shown you, you will arrive at 32. Add 32 to
225, and you will arrive at 257, your ﬁnal answer.

Try another three-digit subtraction problem:
(300  41)
To compute this mentally, subtract 300 from 821 to arrive at
521, then add back the complement of 59, which is 41, to arrive
at 562, our ﬁnal answer. The procedure looks like this:

Chapter 2
Products of a Misspent Youth:
Basic Multiplication
I probably spent too much time of my childhood thinking about
faster and faster ways to perform mental multiplication; I was
diagnosed as hyperactive and my parents were told that I had a
short attention span and probably would not be successful in
school. (Fortunately, my parents ignored that advice. I was also
lucky to have some incredibly patient teachers in my ﬁrst few
years of school.) It might have been my short attention span that
motivated me to develop quick ways to do arithmetic. I don’t
think I had the patience to carry out math problems with pencil
and paper. Once you have mastered the techniques described in
this chapter, you won’t want to rely on pencil and paper again,
either.
In this chapter you will learn how to multiply in your head
one-digit numbers by two-digit numbers and three-digit num-
bers. You will also learn a phenomenally fast way to square
two-digit numbers. Even friends with calculators won’t be able
to keep up with you. Believe me, virtually everyone will be dumb-
founded by the fact that such problems can not only be done

mentally, but can be computed so quickly. I sometimes wonder
whether we were not cheated in school; these methods are so
simple once you learn them.
There is one small prerequisite for mastering the skills in this
chapter—you need to know the multiplication tables through
ten. In fact, to really make headway, you need to know your
multiplication tables backward and forward. For those of you
who need to shake the cobwebs loose, consult the multiplication
chart below. Once you’ve got your tables down, you are ready
to begin.

2-BY-1 MULTIPLICATION PROBLEMS
If you worked your way through Chapter 1, you got into the
habit of adding and subtracting from left to right. You will do vir-
tually all the calculations in this chapter from left to right as well.
This is undoubtedly the opposite of what you learned in school.
Secrets of Mental Math
30

But you’ll soon see how much easier it is to think from left to
right than from right to left. (For one thing, you can start to say
your answer aloud before you have ﬁnished the calculation. That
way you seem to be calculating even faster than you are!)
Let’s tackle our ﬁrst problem:
First, multiply 40  7  280. (Note that 40  7 is just like 
4  7, with a friendly zero attached.) Next, multiply 2  7  14.
Then add 280 plus 14 (left to right, of course) to arrive at 294,
the correct answer. We illustrate this procedure below.
(40  2)
We have omitted diagramming the mental addition of 280 
14, since you learned how to do that computation in the last
chapter. At ﬁrst you will need to look down at the problem
while doing the calculation. With practice you will be able to
forgo this step and compute the whole thing in your mind.
Let’s try another example:
Your ﬁrst step is to break down the problem into small multi-
plication tasks that you can perform mentally with ease. Since

48  40  8, multiply 40  4  160, then add 8  4  32. The
answer is 192. (Note: If you are wondering why this process
works, see the Why These Tricks Work section at the end of the
chapter.)
(40  8)
Here are two more mental multiplication problems that you
should be able to solve fairly quickly. First calculate 62  3.
Then do 71  9. Try doing them in your head before looking at
how we did it.
(60  2)
(70  1)
These two examples are especially simple because the num-
bers being added essentially do not overlap at all. When doing
180  6, you can practically hear the answer: One hundred
eighty . . . six! Another especially easy type of mental multipli-
cation problem involves numbers that begin with ﬁve. When the
ﬁve is multiplied by an even digit, the ﬁrst product will be a mul-
tiple of 100, which makes the resulting addition problem a
snap.

Try your hand at the following problem:

Notice how much easier this problem is to do from left to
right. It takes far less time to calculate “400 plus 35” mentally
than it does to apply the pencil-and-paper method of “putting
down the 5 and carrying the 3.”
The following two problems are a little harder.
(30  8)
(60  7)
As usual, we break these problems down into easier problems.
For the one on the left, multiply 30  9 plus 8  9, giving you
270  72. The addition problem is slightly harder because it
involves carrying a number. Here 270  70  2  340  2  342.
With practice, you will become more adept at juggling

problems like these in your head, and those that require you to
carry numbers will be almost as easy as those that don’t.
Rounding Up
You saw in the last chapter how useful rounding up can be
when it comes to subtraction. The same goes for multiplication,
especially when you are multiplying numbers that end in eight
or nine.
Let’s take the problem of 69  6, illustrated below. On the
left we have calculated it the usual way, by adding 360  54. On
the right, however, we have rounded 69 up to 70, and sub-
tracted 420  6, which you might ﬁnd easier to do.
(60  9)
or
(70  1)
The following example also shows how much easier round-
ing up can be:
(70  8)
or
(80  2)
The subtraction method works especially well for numbers
that are just one or two digits away from a multiple of 10. It does
not work so well when you need to round up more than two dig-

its because the subtraction portion of the problem gets difﬁcult.
As it is, you may prefer to stick with the addition method. Per-
sonally, for problems of this size, I use only the addition method
because in the time spent deciding which method to use, I could
have already done the calculation!
So that you can perfect your technique, I strongly recommend
practicing more 2-by-1 multiplication problems. Below are
twenty problems for you to tackle. I have supplied you with the
answers in the back, including a breakdown of each component
of the multiplication. If, after you’ve worked out these prob-
lems, you would like to practice more, make up your own. Cal-
culate mentally, then check your answer with a calculator. Once
you feel conﬁdent that you can perform these problems rapidly
in your head, you are ready to move to the next level of mental
calculation.

3-BY-1 MULTIPLICATION PROBLEMS
Now that you know how to do 2-by-1 multiplication problems
in your head, you will ﬁnd that multiplying three digits by a sin-
gle digit is not much more difﬁcult. You can get started with the
following 3-by-1 problem (which is really just a 2-by-1 problem
in disguise):
Was that easy for you? (If this problem gave you trouble, you
might want to review the addition material in Chapter 1.) Let’s
try another 3-by-1 problem similar to the one you just did,
except we have replaced the 0 with a 6 so you have another step
to perform:
In this case, you simply add the product of 6  7, which you
already know to be 42, to the ﬁrst sum of 2240. Since you do
not need to carry any numbers, it is easy to add 42 to 2240 to
arrive at the total of 2282.
In solving this and other 3-by-1 multiplication problems, the
difﬁcult part may be holding in memory the ﬁrst sum (in this
case, 2240) while doing the next multiplication problem (in this

case, 6  7). There is no magic secret to remembering that ﬁrst
number, but with practice I guarantee you will improve your
concentration, and holding on to numbers while performing
other functions will get easier.
Let’s try another problem:
Even if the numbers are large, the process is just as simple.
For example:
When ﬁrst solving these problems, you may have to glance
down at the page as you go along to remind yourself what the
original problem is. This is okay at ﬁrst. But try to break the habit
so that eventually you are holding the problem entirely in memory.
In the last section on 2-by-1 multiplication problems, we
saw that problems involving numbers that begin with ﬁve are

sometimes especially easy to solve. The same is true for 3-by-1
problems:
Notice that whenever the ﬁrst product is a multiple of 1000,
the resulting addition problem is no problem at all. This is
because you do not have to carry any numbers and the thou-
sands digit does not change. If you were solving the problem
above in front of someone else, you would be able to say your
ﬁrst product—“three thousand . . .”—out loud with complete
conﬁdence that a carried number would not change it to 4000.
(As an added bonus, by quickly saying the ﬁrst digit, it gives the
illusion that you computed the entire answer immediately!)
Even if you are practicing alone, saying your ﬁrst product out
loud frees up some memory space while you work on the
remaining 2-by-1 problem, which you can say out loud as
well—in this case, “. . . three hundred seventy-eight.”
Try the same approach in solving the next problem, where
the multiplier is a 5:

Because the ﬁrst two digits of the three-digit number are
even, you can say the answer as you calculate it without having
to add anything! Don’t you wish all multiplication problems
were this easy?
Let’s escalate the challenge by trying a couple of problems
that require some carrying.
(600  80  4)
In the next two problems you need to carry a number at the
end of the problem instead of at the beginning:

The ﬁrst part of each of these problems is easy enough to
compute mentally. The difﬁcult part comes in holding the pre-
liminary answer in your head while computing the ﬁnal answer.
In the case of the ﬁrst problem, it is easy to add 5400  360 
5760, but you may have to repeat 5760 to yourself several times
while you multiply 8  9  72. Then add 5760  72. Some-
times at this stage I will start to say my answer aloud before ﬁn-
ishing. Because I know I will have to carry when I add 60  72,
I know that 5700 will become 5800, so I say “ﬁfty-eight hun-
dred and . . .” Then I pause to compute 60  72  132. Because

two!” And there is the answer: 5832.
The next two problems require you to carry two numbers
each, so they may take you longer than those you have already
done. But with practice you will get faster:

When you are ﬁrst tackling these problems, repeat the
answers to each part out loud as you compute the rest. In the
ﬁrst problem, for example, start by saying, “Twenty-eight hun-
dred plus ﬁve hundred sixty” a couple of times out loud to
reinforce the two numbers in memory while you add them
together. Repeat the answer—“thirty-three hundred sixty”—
several times while you multiply 9  7  63. Then repeat
“thirty-three hundred sixty plus sixty-three” aloud until you
compute the ﬁnal answer of 3423. If you are thinking fast
enough to recognize that adding 60  63 will require you to
carry a 1, you can begin to give the ﬁnal answer a split second
before you know it—“thirty-four hundred and . . . twenty-
three!”
Let’s end this section on 3-by-1 multiplication problems with
some special problems you can do in a ﬂash because they
require one addition step instead of two:

(800  25)
In general, if the product of the last two digits of the ﬁrst
number and the multiplier is known to you without having to
calculate it (for instance, you may know that 25  8  200
automatically since 8 quarters equals $2.00), you will get to the
ﬁnal answer much more quickly. For instance, if you know
without calculating that 75  4  300, then it is easy to com-
pute 975  4:

I can assure you from experience that doing mental calculations
is just like riding a bicycle or typing. It might seem impossible
at ﬁrst, but once you’ve mastered it, you will never forget how

BE THERE OR B2: SQUARING TWO-DIGIT NUMBERS
Squaring numbers in your head (multiplying a number by itself)
is one of the easiest yet most impressive feats of mental calcula-
tion you can do. I can still recall where I was when I discovered
how to do it. I was thirteen, sitting on a bus on the way to visit
my father at work in downtown Cleveland. It was a trip I made
often, so my mind began to wander. I’m not sure why, but I
began thinking about the numbers that add up to 20, and I won-
dered, how large could the product of two such numbers get?
I started in the middle with 10  10 (or 102), the product of
which is 100. Next, I multiplied 9  11  99, 8  12  96, 7 
13  91, 6  14  84, 5  15  75, 4  16  64, and so on. I
noticed that the products were getting smaller, and their differ-
ence from 100 was 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, . . . —or 12, 22, 32, 42, 52,
62, . . . (see table below).

I found this pattern astonishing. Next I tried numbers that
add to 26 and got similar results. First I worked out 132  169,
then computed 12  14  168, 11  15  165, 10  16  160,
Secrets of Mental Math
44

9  17  153, and so on. Just as before, the distances these
products were from 169 was 12, 22, 32, 42, and so on (see table
below).
There is actually a simple algebraic explanation for this phe-
nomenon (see Why These Tricks Work, page 50). At the time, I
didn’t know my algebra well enough to prove that this pattern
would always occur, but I experimented with enough examples
to become convinced of it.
Then I realized that this pattern could help me square num-
bers more easily. Suppose I wanted to square the number 13.
Instead of multiplying 13  13,

why not get an approximate answer by using two numbers that
are easier to multiply but also add to 26? I chose 10  16 
160. To get the ﬁnal answer, I just added 32  9 (since 10 and 16
are each 3 away from 13). Thus, 132  160  9  169. Neat!
This method is diagrammed as follows:
16
132
3
160  32  169
3
10
Now let’s see how this works for another square:
Products of a Misspent Youth: Basic Multiplication
45

42
412
1
1680  12  1681
1
40
To square 41, subtract 1 to obtain 40 and add 1 to obtain 42.
Next multiply 40  42. Don’t panic! This is simply a 2-by-1
multiplication problem (speciﬁcally, 4  42) in disguise. Since 
4  42  168, 40  42  1680. Almost done! All you have to
add is the square of 1 (the number by which you went up and
down from 41), giving you 1680  1  1681.
Can squaring a two-digit number be this easy? Yes, with this
method and a little practice, it can. And it works whether you
initially round down or round up. For example, let’s examine
772, working it out both by rounding up and by rounding down:
84
772
7
5880  72  5929
7
70
or
80
772
3
5920  32  5929
3
74
In this instance the advantage of rounding up is that you are
virtually done as soon as you have completed the multiplication
problem because it is simple to add 9 to a number ending in 0!
In fact, for all two-digit squares, I always round up or down
to the nearest multiple of 10. So if the number to be squared
ends in 6, 7, 8, or 9, round up, and if the number to be squared
ends in 1, 2, 3, or 4, round down. (If the number ends in 5, you
Secrets of Mental Math
46

do both!) With this strategy you will add only the numbers 1, 4,
9, 16, or 25 to your ﬁrst calculation.
Let’s try another problem. Calculate 562 in your head before
looking at how we did it, below:
60
562
4
3120  42  3136
4
52
Squaring numbers that end in 5 is even easier. Since you will
always round up and down by 5, the numbers to be multiplied
will both be multiples of 10. Hence, the multiplication and the
addition are especially simple. We have worked out 852 and 352,
below:
90
852
5
7200  52  7225
5
80
40
352
5
1200  52  1225
5
30
As you saw in Chapter 0, when you are squaring a number
that ends in 5, rounding up and down allows you to blurt out
the ﬁrst part of the answer immediately and then ﬁnish it with
25. For example, if you want to compute 752, rounding up to 80
and down to 70 will give you “Fifty-six hundred and . . .
twenty-ﬁve!”
For numbers ending in 5, you should have no trouble beating
someone with a calculator, and with a little practice with the
Products of a Misspent Youth: Basic Multiplication
47

other squares, it won’t be long before you can beat the calcula-
tor with any two-digit square number. Even large numbers are
not to be feared. You can ask someone to give you a really big
two-digit number, something in the high 90s, and it will sound
as though you’ve chosen an impossible problem to compute.
But, in fact, these are even easier because they allow you to
round up to 100.
Let’s say your audience gives you 962. Try it yourself, and
then check how we did it.
100
962
4
9200  42  9216
4
92
Wasn’t that easy? You should have rounded up by 4 to 100
and down by 4 to 92, and then multiplied 100  92 to get 9200.
At this point you can say out loud, “Ninety-two hundred,” and
then ﬁnish up with “sixteen” and enjoy the applause!

Zerah Colburn: Entertaining Calculations
O
ne of the ﬁrst lightning calculators to capitalize on his talent
was Zerah Colburn (1804–1839), an American farmer’s son
from Vermont who learned the multiplication tables to 100 before he
could even read or write. By the age of six, young Zerah’s father took
him on the road,where his performances generated enough capital to
send him to school in Paris and London. By age eight he was interna-
tionally famous, performing lightning calculations in England, and was
described in the Annual Register as “the most singular phenomenon in
the history of the human mind that perhaps ever existed.” No less
than Michael Faraday and Samuel Morse admired him.
No matter where he went,Colburn met all challengers with speed
and precision. He tells us in his autobiography of one set of problems
he was given in New Hampshire in June 1811:“How many days and
hours since the Christian Era commenced, 1811 years ago? Answered
in twenty seconds: 661,015 days, 15,864,360 hours. How many sec-
onds in eleven years? Answered in four seconds; 346,896,000.” Col-
burn used the same techniques described in this book to compute
entirely in his head problems given to him.For example,he would fac-
tor large numbers into smaller numbers and then multiply: Colburn
once multiplied 21,734  543 by factoring 543 into 181  3.He then
multiplied 21,734  181 to arrive at 3,933,854, and ﬁnally multiplied
that ﬁgure by 3, for a total of 11,801,562.
As is often the case with lightning calculators,interest in Colburn’s
amazing skills diminished with time, and by the age of twenty he had
returned to America and become a Methodist preacher. He died at a
youthful thirty-ﬁve. In summarizing his skills as a lightning calculator,
and the advantage such an ability affords,Colburn reﬂected,“True,the
method . . . requires a much larger number of ﬁgures than the com-
mon Rule, but it will be remembered that pen, ink and paper cost
Zerah very little when engaged in a sum.”

WHY THESE TRICKS WORK
This section is presented for teachers, students, math buffs, and
anyone curious as to why our methods work. Some people may
ﬁnd the theory as interesting as the application. Fortunately, you
need not understand why our methods work in order to under-
stand how to apply them. All magic tricks have a rational expla-
nation behind them, and mathemagical tricks are no different. It
is here that the mathemagician reveals his deepest secrets!
In this chapter on multiplication problems, the distributive
law is what allows us to break down problems into their com-
ponent parts. The distributive law states that for any numbers a,
b, and c:
(b  c)  a  (b  a)  (c  a)
That is, the outside term, a, is distributed, or separately
applied, to each of the inside terms, b and c. For example, in
our ﬁrst mental multiplication problem of 42  7, we arrived
at the answer by treating 42 as 40  2, then distributing the 7
as follows:
42  7  (40  2)  7  (40  7)  (2  7)  280  14  294
You may wonder why the distributive law works in the ﬁrst
place. To understand it intuitively, imagine having 7 bags, each
containing 42 coins, 40 of which are gold and 2 of which are sil-
ver. How many coins do you have altogether? There are two
ways to arrive at the answer. In the ﬁrst place, by the very def-
inition of multiplication, there are 42  7 coins. On the other
hand, there are 40  7 gold coins and 2  7 silver coins. Hence,
Secrets of Mental Math
50

we have (40  7)  (2  7) coins altogether. By answering our
question two ways, we have 42  7  (40  7)  (2  7).
Notice that the numbers 7, 40, and 2 could be replaced by any
numbers (a, b, or c) and the same logic would apply. That’s why
the distributive law works!
Using similar reasoning with gold, silver, and copper coins we
can derive:
(b  c  d)  a  (b  a)  (c  a)  (d  a)
Hence, to do the problem 326  7, we break up 326 as 300
 20  6, then distribute the 7, as follows: 326  7  (300  20
 6)  7  (300  7)  (20  7)  (6  7), which we then add
up to get our answer.
As for squaring, the following algebra justiﬁes my method.
For any numbers A and d
A2  (A  d)  (A  d)  d2
Here, A is the number being squared; d can be any number,
but I choose it to be the distance from A to the nearest multiple
of 10. Hence, for 772, I set d  3 and our formula tells us that
772  (77  3)  (77  3)  32  (80  74)  9  5929. The
following algebraic relationship also works to explain my squar-
ing method:
(z  d)2  z2  2zd  d2  z(z  2d)  d2
Hence, to square 41, we set z  40 and d  1 to get:
412  (40  1)2  40  (40  2)  12  1681
Products of a Misspent Youth: Basic Multiplication

Similarly,

Chapter 3
New and Improved Products:
Intermediate Multiplication
Mathemagics really gets exciting when you perform in front of
an audience. I experienced my ﬁrst public performance in eighth
grade, at the fairly advanced age of thirteen. Many mathemagi-
cians begin even earlier. Zerah Colburn (1804–1839), for exam-
ple, reportedly could do lightning calculations before he could
read or write, and he was entertaining audiences by the age of
six! When I was thirteen, my algebra teacher did a problem on
the board for which the answer was 1082. Not content to stop
there, I blurted out, “108 squared is simply 11,664!”
The teacher did the calculation on the board and arrived at
the same answer. Looking a bit startled, she said, “Yes, that’s
right. How did you do it?” So I told her, “I went down 8 to 100
and up 8 to 116. I then multiplied 116  100, which is 11,600,
and just added the square of 8, to get 11,664.”
She had never seen that method before. I was thrilled.
Thoughts of “Benjamin’s Theorem” popped into my head. I actu-
ally believed I had discovered something new. When I ﬁnally
ran across this method a few years later in a book by Martin

Gardner on recreational math, Mathematical Carnival (1965),
it ruined my day! Still, the fact that I had discovered it for
myself was very exciting to me.
You, too, can impress your friends (or teachers) with some
fairly amazing mental multiplication. At the end of the last
chapter you learned how to multiply a two-digit number by
itself. In this chapter you will learn how to multiply two differ-
ent two-digit numbers, a challenging yet more creative task. You
will then try your hand—or, more accurately, your brain—at
three-digit squares. You do not have to know how to do 2-by-2
multiplication problems to tackle three-digit squares, so you can
learn either skill ﬁrst.
2-BY-2 MULTIPLICATION PROBLEMS
When squaring two-digit numbers, the method is always the
same. When multiplying two-digit numbers, however, you can
use lots of different methods to arrive at the same answer. For
me, this is where the fun begins.
The ﬁrst method you will learn is the “addition method,”
which can be used to solve all 2-by-2 multiplication problems.
The Addition Method
To use the addition method to multiply any two two-digit num-
bers, all you need to do is perform two 2-by-1 multiplication
problems and add the results together. For example:
(40  2)
46



40  46 
1840
2  46  
92

1932
Secrets of Mental Math
54

Here you break up 42 into 40 and 2, two numbers that are
easy to multiply. Then you multiply 40  46, which is just 4 
46 with a 0 attached, or 1840. Then you multiply 2  46  92.
Finally, you add 1840  92  1932, as diagrammed above.
Here’s another way to do the same problem:
(40  6)
The catch here is that multiplying 6  42 is harder to do than
multiplying 2  46, as in the ﬁrst problem. Moreover, adding
1680  252 is more difﬁcult than adding 1840  92. So how
do you decide which number to break up? I try to choose the
number that will produce the easier addition problem. In most
cases—but not all—you will want to break up the number with
the smaller last digit because it usually produces a smaller sec-
ond number for you to add.
Now try your hand at the following problems:
(70  3)
(80  1)
The last problem illustrates why numbers that end in 1 are
especially attractive to break up. If both numbers end in the

same digit, you should break up the larger number as illustrated
below:
(80  4)
If one number is much larger than the other, it often pays to
break up the larger number, even if it has a larger last digit. You
will see what I mean when you try the following problem two
different ways:
(70  4)
(10  3)
Did you ﬁnd the ﬁrst method to be faster than the second? I did.
Here’s another exception to the rule of breaking up the num-
ber with the smaller last digit. When you multiply a number in
the ﬁfties by an even number, you’ll want to break up the num-
ber in the ﬁfties:

rest of your life. Once all future dates are taken care of, we can
look back into the past and determine the days of the week for
any date in the 1900s or any other century.
Every year is assigned a code number, and for 2006 that year
code happens to be 0 (see page 218).
Now, to calculate the day of the week, you simply add the
month code plus the date code plus the year code. Thus for
December 3, 2006, we compute
Month Code  Date Year Code  4  3  0  7
Hence, this date will be on Day 7, which is Sunday.
How about November 18, 2006? Since November has a
month code of 2, we have
Month Code  Date Year Code  2  18  0  20.
Now since the week repeats every seven days, we can sub-
tract any multiple of 7 from our answer (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, . . .)
and this will not change the day of the week. So our ﬁnal step is
to subtract the biggest multiple of 7 to get 20  14  6. Hence
November 18, 2006, occurs on Saturday.
How about 2007? Well, what happens to your birthday as
you go from one year to the next? For most years, there are 365
days, and since 364 is a multiple of 7 (7  52  364), then the
day of the week of your birthday will shift forward by one day
in most years. If there are 366 days between your birthdays,
then it will shift forward by two days. Hence, for 2007 we cal-
culate the day of the week just as before, but now we use a year
code of 1. Next, 2008 is a leap year. (Leap years occur every
four years, so 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, . . . , 2096 are the leap
years of the twenty-ﬁrst century.) Hence, for 2008, the year

The last digit of the number 84 is smaller than the last digit of
59, but if you break up 59, your product will be a multiple of
100, just as 4200 is, in the example above. This makes the sub-
sequent addition problem much easier.
Now try an easy problem of a different sort:
(10  1)
Though the calculation above is pretty simple, there is an even
easier and faster way to multiply any two-digit number by 11.
This is mathemagics at its best: you won’t believe your eyes when
you see it (unless you remember it from Chapter 0)!
Here’s how it works. Suppose you have a two-digit number
whose digits add up to 9 or less. To multiply this number by 11,
merely add the two digits together and insert the total between
the original two digits. For example, to do 42  11, ﬁrst do 4 
2  6. If you place the 6 between the 4 and the 2, you get 462,
the answer to the problem!

Try 54  11 by this method.

If you got the right answer the ﬁrst or second time, pat your-
self on the back. The 2-by-2 multiplication problems really do
not get any tougher than this. If you did not get the answer right
away, don’t worry. In the next two sections, I’ll teach you some
much easier strategies for dealing with problems like this. But
before you read on, practice the addition method on the follow-
ing multiplication problems.

Although most people ﬁnd addition easier than subtraction,
it is usually easier to subtract a small number than to add a big
number. (If we had done this problem by the addition method,
we would have added 850  153  1003.)
Now let’s do the challenging problem from the end of the last
section:
(90  1)
Wasn’t that a whole lot easier? Now, here’s a problem where
one number ends in 8:
(90  2)
In this case you should treat 88 as 90  2, then multiply 90 
23  2070. But you multiplied by too much. How much? By 2 
23, or 46 too much. So subtract 46 from 2070 to arrive at 2024,
the ﬁnal answer.

I want to emphasize here that it is important to work out
these problems in your head and not simply look to see how we
did it in the diagram. Go through them and say the steps to
yourself or even out loud to reinforce your thoughts.
Not only do I use the subtraction method with numbers that
end in 8 or 9, but also for numbers in the high 90s because 100
is such a convenient number to multiply. For example, if some-
one asked me to multiply 96  73, I would immediately round
up 96 to 100:
(100  4)
When the subtraction component of a multiplication prob-
lem requires you to borrow a number, using complements (as
we learned in Chapter 1) can help you arrive at the answer more
quickly. You’ll see what I mean as you work your way through
the problems below. For example, subtract 340  78. We know
the answer will be in the 200s. The difference between 40 and
78 is 38. Now take the complement of 38 to get 62. And that’s
the answer, 262!
78  40  38
Complement of 38  62
Now let’s try another problem:

There are two ways to perform the subtraction component of
this problem. The “long” way subtracts 200 and adds back 48:
6840  152

6640  48

6688
(ﬁrst subtract 200)
(then add 48)
The short way is to realize that the answer will be 66 hundred
and something. To determine something, we subtract 52  40 
12 and then ﬁnd the complement of 12, which is 88. Hence the
answer is 6688.
Try this one.
(60  1)
Again, you can see that the answer will be 3900 and some-
thing. Because 67  20  47, the complement 53 means the
answer is 3953.
As you may have realized, you can use this method with any
subtraction problem that requires you to borrow a number, not
just those that are part of a multiplication problem. All of this is
further proof, if you need it, that complements are a very pow-
erful tool in mathemagics. Master this technique and, pretty
soon, people will be complimenting you!

The Factoring Method
The factoring method is my favorite method of multiplying two-
digit numbers since it involves no addition or subtraction at all.
You use it when one of the numbers in a two-digit multiplica-
tion problem can be factored into one-digit numbers.
To factor a number means to break it down into one-digit
numbers that, when multiplied together, give the original num-
ber. For example, the number 24 can be factored into 8  3 or
6  4. (It can also be factored into 12  2, but we prefer to use
only single-digit factors.)
Here are some other examples of factored numbers:

To see how factoring makes multiplication easier, consider the
following problem:
 7  6
Previously we solved this problem by multiplying 46  40
and 46  2 and adding the products together. To use the factor-
ing method, treat 42 as 7  6 and begin by multiplying 46  7,
which is 322. Then multiply 322  6 for the ﬁnal answer of
1932. You already know how to do 2-by-1 and 3-by-1 multipli-
cation problems, so this should not be too hard:
46  42  46  (7  6)  (46  7)  6  322  6  1932
Of course, this problem could also have been solved by revers-
ing the factors of 42:
46  42  46  (6  7)  (46  6)  7  276  7  1932
In this case, it is easier to multiply 322  6 than it is to multi-
ply 276  7. In most cases, I like to use the larger factor in solv-
ing the initial 2-by-1 problem and to reserve the smaller factor
for the 3-by-1 component of the problem.
Factoring results in a 2-by-2 multiplication problem being
simpliﬁed to an easier 3-by-1 (or sometimes 2-by-1) multiplica-
tion problem. The advantage of the factoring method in mental
calculation is you do not have to hold much in memory. Let’s
look at another example, 75  63:
75  63  75  (9  7)  (75  9)  7  675  7  4725
46
 42

Secrets of Mental Math
64

As before, you simplify this 2-by-2 problem by factoring 63
into 9  7 and then multiplying 75 by these factors. (By the way,
the reason we can shift parentheses in the second step is the
associative law of multiplication.)
63  75  63  (5  5  3)  (63  5)  5  3 
 315  5  3  1575  3  4725
Try the following problem for practice:
57  24  57  8  3  456  3  1368
You could have factored 24 as 6  4 for another easy com-
putation:
57  24  57  6  4  342  4  1368
Compare this approach with the addition method:
(20  4)
or
(50  7)
With the addition method, you have to perform two 2-by-1
problems and then add. With the factoring method, you have
just two multiplication problems: a 2-by-1 and a 3-by-1, and
then you are done. The factoring method is usually easier on
your memory.

Remember that challenging multiplication problem earlier in
this chapter? Here it is again:
We tackled that problem easily enough with the subtraction
method, but factoring works even faster:
89  72  89  9  8  801  8  6408
The problem is especially easy because of the 0 in the middle
of 801. Our next example illustrates that it sometimes pays to
factor the numbers in an order that exploits this situation. Let’s
look at two ways of computing 67  42:
67  42  67  7  6  469  6  2814
67  42  67  6  7  402  7  2814
Ordinarily you should factor 42 into 7  6, as in the ﬁrst
example, following the rule of using the larger factor ﬁrst. But
the problem is easier to solve if you factor 42 into 6  7 because
it creates a number with a 0 in the center, which is easier to mul-
tiply. I call such numbers friendly products.
Look for the friendly product in the problem done two ways
below:
43  56  43  8  7  344  7  2408
43  56  43  7  8  301  8  2408
Did you think the second way was easier?
When using the factoring method, it pays to ﬁnd friendly

products whenever you can. The following list should help. I
don’t expect you to memorize it so much as to familiarize your-
self with it. With practice you will be able to nose out friendly
products more often, and the list will become more meaningful.

APPROACHING MULTIPLICATION CREATIVELY
I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter that multiplication
problems are fun because they can be solved any number of
ways. Now that you know what I mean, let’s apply all three
methods explained in this chapter to a single problem, 73  49.
We’ll begin by using the addition method:
(70  3)
Now try the subtraction method:
(50  1)
Note that the last two digits of the subtraction could be
obtained by adding 50  (complement of 73)  50  27  77
or by simply taking the complement of (73  50)  complement
of 23  77.
Finally, try the factoring method:
73  49  73  7  7  511  7  3577
Congratulations! You have mastered 2-by-2 multiplication
and now have all the basic skills you need to be a fast mental

THREE-DIGIT SQUARES
Squaring three-digit numbers is an impressive feat of mental
prestidigitation. Just as you square two-digit numbers by round-
ing up or down to the nearest multiple of 10, to square three-
digit numbers, you round up or down to the nearest multiple of
100. Take 193:
7
200
1932
37,200  72  37,249
7
186
By rounding up to 200 and down to 186, you’ve transformed
a 3-by-3 multiplication problem into a far simpler 3-by-1 prob-
lem. After all, 200  186 is just 2  186  372 with two zeros
attached. Almost done! Now all you have to add is 72  49 to
arrive at 37,249.

Rounding down by 6 to 700 requires you to round up by 6 to
712. Since 712  7  4984 (a simple 3-by-1 problem), 712 
700  498,400. After adding 62  36, you arrive at 498,436.
These last problems are not terribly hard because there is no
real addition involved. Moreover, you know the answers to 62
and 72 by heart. Squaring a number that’s farther away from a
multiple of 100 is a tougher proposition. Try your hand at 3142:
14
328
3142
98,400  142  98,596
14
300
4
18
142
180  42  196
4
10
For this three-digit square, go down 14 to 300 and up 14 to
328, then multiply 328  3  984. Tack on two 0s to arrive at
98,400. Then add the square of 14. If 142  196 comes to you in
a ﬂash (through memory or calculation), you’re in good shape.
Just add 98,400  196 to arrive at 98,596. If you need time to
compute 142, repeat the number 98,400 to yourself a few times
before you go on. (Otherwise you might compute 142  196 and
forget what number to add it to.)
The farther away you get from a multiple of 100, the more
difﬁcult squaring a three-digit number becomes. Try 5292:

If you have an audience you want to impress, you can say
279,000 out loud before you compute 292. But this will not work
for every problem. For instance, try squaring 636:
36
672
6362
403,200  362  404,496
36
600
4
40
362
1,280  42  1,296
4
32
Now your brain is really working, right? The key here is to
repeat 403,200 to yourself several times. Then square 36 to get
1,296 in the usual way. The hard part comes in adding 1,296 to
403,200. Do it one digit at a time, left to right, to arrive at your
answer of 404,496. Take my word that as you become more
familiar with two-digit squares, these three-digit problems get
easier.
Here’s an even tougher problem, 8632:
900
8632
8??
The ﬁrst problem is deciding what numbers to multiply
together. Clearly one of the numbers will be 900, and the other
number will be in the 800s. But what number? You can com-
pute it two ways:
1. The hard way: the difference between 863 and 900 is 37 (the
complement of 63). Subtract 37 from 863 to arrive at 826.
New and Improved Products: Intermediate Multiplication
73

2. The easy way: double the number 63 to get 126, and take the last
two digits to give you 826.
Here’s why the easy way works. Because both numbers are
the same distance from 863, their sum must be twice 863, or
1726. One of your numbers is 900, so the other must be 826.
You then compute the problem like this:
37
900
8632
743,400  372  744,769
37
826
3
40
372
1,360  32  1,369
3
34
If you ﬁnd it impossible to remember 743,400 after squaring
37, fear not. In a later chapter, you will learn a memory system
that will make remembering such numbers much easier.
Try your hand at squaring 359, the hardest problem yet:
41
400
3592
127,200  412  128,881
41
318
1
42
412
1,680  12  1,681
1
40
To obtain 318, either subtract 41 (the complement of 59)
from 359, or multiply 2  59  118 and use the last two digits.
Next multiply 400  318  127,200. Adding 412, or 1,681,
gives you 128,881. Whew! They don’t get much harder than
that! If you got it right the ﬁrst time, take a bow!
Let’s ﬁnish this section with a big problem that is easy to 
do, 9872:

What’s Behind Door Number 1?
T
he mathematical chestnut of 1991 that got everyone hopping
mad was an article in Parade magazine by Marilyn vos Savant, the
woman listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as having the
world’s highest IQ.The paradox has come to be known as the Monty
Hall problem, and it goes like this.
You are a contestant on Let’s Make a Deal. Monty Hall allows you
to pick one of three doors;behind one of these doors is the big prize,
behind the other two are goats.You pick Door Number 2. But before
Monty reveals the prize of your choice,he shows you what you didn’t
pick behind Door Number 3. It’s a goat. Now, in his tantalizing way,
Monty gives you another choice. Do you want to stick with Door
Number 2, or do you want to risk a chance to see what’s behind
Door Number 1? What should you do? Assuming that Monty is only
going to reveal where the big prize is not, he will always open one of
the consolation doors.This leaves two doors, one with the big prize
and the other with another consolation.The odds are now 50-50 for
your choice, right?
Wrong! The odds that you chose correctly the ﬁrst time remain
1 in 3. The probability that the big prize is behind the other door
increases to 2 in 3 because the probability must add to 1.
Thus, by switching doors, you double the odds of winning! (The
problem assumes that Monty will always give a player the option to
switch, that he will always reveal a nonwinning door, and that when
your ﬁrst pick is correct he will choose a nonwinning door at ran-
dom.) Think of playing the game with ten doors and after your pick
he reveals eight other nonwinning doors. Here, your instincts would
probably tell you to switch. People confuse this problem for a variant:
if Monty Hall does not know where the grand prize is, and reveals
Door Number 3, which happens to contain a goat (though it might
have contained the prize), then Door Number 1 has a 50 percent
chance of being correct.This result is so counterintuitive that Marilyn
vos Savant received piles of letters, many from scientists and even
mathematicians, telling her she shouldn’t write about math. They
were all wrong.

CUBING
We end this chapter with a new method for cubing two-digit
numbers. (Recall that the cube of a number is that number mul-
tiplied by itself twice. For example, 5 cubed—denoted 53—is
equal to 5  5  5  125.) As you will see, this is not much
harder than multiplying two-digit numbers. The method is based
on the algebraic observation that
A3  (A  d)A(A  d)  d2A
where d is any number. Just like with squaring two-digit num-
bers, I choose d to be the distance to the nearest multiple of ten.
For example, when squaring 13, we let d  3, resulting in:
133  (10  13  16)  (32  13)
Since 13  16  13  4  4  52  4  208, and 9  13 
117, we have
Secrets of Mental Math
76

133  2080  117  2197
How about the cube of 35? Letting d  5, we get
353  (30  35  40)  (52  35)
Since 30  35  40  30  1,400  42,000 and 35  5  5 
175  5  875, we get
353  42,000  875  42,875
When cubing 49, we let d  1 in order to round up to 50. Here
493  (48  49  50)  (12  49)
We can solve 48  49 by the factoring method, but for this
sort of problem, I prefer to use the close-together method, which
will be described in Chapter 8. (Go ahead and look at it now, if
you’d like!) Using that method, we get 48  49  (50  47) 
(1  2)  2352. Multiplying this by 50, we get 117,600 and
therefore
493  117,600  49  117,649
Here’s a larger one. Try the cube of 92.
923  (90  92  94)  (22  92)
If you are fast at squaring two-digit numbers, then you could
solve 92  94  932  1  8648, or you could use the close-
together method, resulting in 92  94  (90  96)  (2  4) 
8648. Multiplying this by 9 (as described in the beginning of
New and Improved Products: Intermediate Multiplication
77

Chapter 8), we obtain 9  (8,600  48)  77,400  432 
77,832, and therefore 90  92  94  778,320. Since 4  92 
368, we get
923  778,320  368  778,688
We note that when the close-together method is used for the
multiplication problems that arise when cubing two-digit num-
bers, the small product being added will either be (depending on
whether d  1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) 1  2  2, 2  4  8, 3  6  18,
4  8  32, or 5  10  50. Let’s ﬁnish with the cube of 96.
963  (92  96  100)  (42  96)
The product 92  96  8,832 can be done many different
ways. To celebrate the end of this chapter, let’s do some of them.
I’ll start with what I consider to be the hardest way, and end
with what I consider the easiest way. By the addition method,
(90  2)  96  8,640  192  8,832; by the subtraction
method, 92  (100  4)  9,200  368  8,832; by the factoring
method, 92  6  4  4  552  4  4  2,208  4  8,832; by
squaring, 942  22  8,836  4  8,832; by the close-together
method with a base of 90, (90  98)  (2  6)  8,820  12 
8,832; and by the close-together method with a base of 100,
(100  88)  (8  4)  8,800  32  8,832.
The product 42  96  1,536 can also be done a few differ-
ent ways, such as 96  4  4  384  4  1,536, or as 16 
(100  4)  1,600  64  1,536. Finally, since 8,832  100 
883,200, we have
963  883,200  1,536  884,736

Chapter 4
Divide and Conquer:
Mental Division
Mental division is a particularly handy skill to have, both in
business and in daily life. How many times a week are you
confronted with situations that call on you to evenly divide
things, such as a check at a restaurant? This same skill comes
in handy when you want to ﬁgure out the cost per unit of a
case of dog food on sale, or to split the pot in poker, or to ﬁg-
ure out how many gallons of gas you can buy with a $20 bill.
The ability to divide in your head can save you the inconve-
nience of having to pull out a calculator every time you need to
compute something.
With mental division, the left-to-right method of calculation
comes into its own. This is the same method we all learned in
school, so you will be doing what comes naturally. I remember
as a kid thinking that this left-to-right method of division is the
way all arithmetic should be done. I have often speculated that
if the schools could have ﬁgured out a way to teach division
right-to-left, they probably would have done so!

ONE-DIGIT DIVISION
The ﬁrst step when dividing mentally is to ﬁgure out how many
digits will be in your answer. To see what I mean, try on the fol-
lowing problem for size:
179  7
To solve 179  7, we’re looking for a number, Q, such that 7
times Q is 179. Now, since 179 lies between 7  10  70 and
7  100  700, Q must lie between 10 and 100, which means
our answer must be a two-digit number. Knowing that, we ﬁrst
determine the largest multiple of 10 that can be multiplied by 7
whose answer is below 179. We know that 7  20  140 and
7  30  210, so our answer must be in the twenties. At this
point we can actually say the number 20 since that part of our
answer will certainly not change. Next we subtract 179  140 
39. Our problem has now been reduced to the division problem
39  7. Since 7  5  35, which is 4 away from 39, we have the
rest of our answer, namely 5 with a remainder of 4, or 5 and 4
7
.
Altogether, we have our answer, 25 with a remainder of 4, or if
you prefer, 254
7
. Here’s what the process looks like:
Answer: 25 with a remainder of 4, or 25 47

remainder

Let’s try a similar division problem using the same method of
mental computation:
675  8
As before, since 675 falls between 8  10  80 and 8  100
 800, your answer must be below 100 and therefore is a two-
digit number. To divide 8 into 675, notice that 8  80  640
and 8  90  720. Therefore, your answer is 80 something.
But what is that “something”? To ﬁnd out, subtract 640 from
675 for a remainder of 35. After saying the 80, our problem
has been reduced to 35  8. Since 8  4  32, the ﬁnal answer
is 84 with a remainder of 3, or 843
8
. We illustrate this problem
as follows:
Answer: 84 with a remainder of 3, or 84
Like most mental calculations, division can be thought of as a
process of simpliﬁcation. The more you calculate, the simpler
the problem becomes. What began as 675  8 was simpliﬁed to
a smaller problem, 35  8.
Now let’s try a division problem that results in a three-digit
answer:
947  4

remainder

This time, your answer will have three digits because 947
falls between 4  100  400 and 4  1000  4000. Thus we
must ﬁrst ﬁnd the largest multiple of 100 that can be squeezed
into 947. Since 4  200  800, our answer is deﬁnitely in the
200s, so go ahead and say it! Subtracting 800 from 947 gives us
our new division problem, 147  4. Since 4  30  120, we can
now say the 30. After subtracting 120 from 147, we compute
27  4 to obtain the rest of the answer: 6 with a remainder of 3.
Altogether, we have 236 with a remainder of 3, or 2363
4
.
Answer: 236
The process is just as easy when dividing a one-digit number
into a four-digit number, as in our next example.
2196  5
Here the answer will be in the hundreds because 2196 is
between 5  100  500 and 5  1000  5000. After subtract-
ing 5  400  2000, we can say the 400, and our problem has
reduced to 196  5, which can be solved as in the previous
examples.

THE RULE OF “THUMB”
When dividing in your head instead of on paper, you may ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to remember parts of the answer as you continue to cal-
culate. One option, as you’ve seen, is to say the answer out loud
as you go. But for greater dramatic effect, you may prefer, as I
do, to hold the answer on your ﬁngers and say it all together at
the end. In that case, you may run into problems remembering
digits greater than ﬁve if, like most of us, you have only ﬁve ﬁn-
gers on each hand. The solution is to use a special technique,
based on sign language, which I call the Rule of “Thumb.” It is
most effective for remembering three-digit and greater numbers.

This technique not only is useful in this chapter but also will
come in handy (pardon the pun) in subsequent chapters dealing
with larger problems and longer numbers to remember.
You already know that to represent numbers 0 through 5, all
you have to do is raise the equivalent number of ﬁngers on your
hand. When you get your thumb involved, it’s just as easy to
represent numbers 6 through 9. Here are the Rules of “Thumb”:
• To hold on to 6, place your thumb on top of your pinky.
• To hold on to 7, place your thumb on top of your ring ﬁnger.
• To hold on to 8, place your thumb on top of your middle ﬁnger.
• To hold on to 9, place your thumb on top of your index ﬁnger.
With three-digit answers, hold the hundreds digit on your left
hand and the tens digit on your right. When you get to the ones
digit, you’ve reached the end of the problem (except for a possi-
ble remainder). Now say the number on your left hand, the num-
ber on your right hand, the one-digit you’ve just computed, and
the remainder (in your head). Presto—you’ve said your answer!
For practice, try to compute the following four-digit division
problem:

In using the Rule of “Thumb” to remember the answer,
you’ll hold the 7 on your left hand by placing your thumb and
ring ﬁnger together and the 6 on your right hand by placing
your thumb and little ﬁnger together. Once you’ve calculated
the ones digit (which is 3) and the remainder (which is 1), you
can “read” the ﬁnal answer off your hands from left to right:
“seven . . . six . . . three with a remainder of one, or one-
sixth.”
Some four-digit division problems yield four-digit answers. In
that case, since you have only two hands, you will have to say
the thousands digit of the answer out loud and use the rule of
thumb to remember the rest of the answer. For example:
8352  3
Answer: 2784
For this problem, you divide 3 into 8 to get your thousands
digit of 2, say “two thousand” out loud, then divide 3 into 2352
in the usual way.

TWO-DIGIT DIVISION
This section assumes you already have mastered the art of divid-
ing by a one-digit number. Naturally, division problems become
harder as the number you divide by gets larger. Fortunately, I
have some magic up my sleeve to make your life easier.
Let’s start with a relatively easy problem ﬁrst:
597  14
Since 597 lies between 14  10 and 14  100, the answer
(also called the quotient) lies between 10 and 100. To determine
the answer, your ﬁrst step is to ask how many times 14 goes into
590. Because 14  40  560, you know that the answer is 40
something, and so you can say “forty” out loud.
Next, subtract 560 from 597, which is 37 and reduces your
problem to dividing 14 into 37. Since 14  2  28, your answer
is 42. Subtracting 28 from 37 leaves you a remainder of 9. The
process of deriving the solution to this problem may be illus-
trated as follows:
Answer: 42
The following problem is slightly harder because the two-
digit divisor (here 23) is larger.

682  23
In this problem, the answer is a two-digit number because
682 falls between 23  10  230 and 23  100  2300. To 
ﬁgure out the tens digit of the two-digit answer, you need to ask
how many times 23 goes into 680. If you try 30, you’ll see that
it’s slightly too much, as 30  23  690. Now you know that
the answer is 20 something, and you can say so. Then subtract
23  20  460 from 682 to obtain 222. Since 23  9  207, the
answer is 29 with a remainder of 222  207  15.
Answer: 29
Now consider:
491  62
Since 491 is less than 62  10  620, your answer will sim-
ply be a one-digit number with a remainder. You might guess 8,
but 62  8  496, which is a little high. Since 62  7  434, the
answer is 7 with a remainder of 491  434  57, or 75

Answer: 7
Actually, there’s a nifty trick to make problems like this eas-
ier. Remember how you ﬁrst tried multiplying 62  8, but
found it came out a little high at 496? Well, that wasn’t a
wasted effort. Aside from knowing that the answer is 7, you
can also compute the remainder right away. Since 496 is 5 more
than 491, the remainder will be 5 less than 62, the divisor.
Since 62  5  57, your answer is 76
5
2
7. The reason this trick
works is because 491  (62  8)  5  62  (7  1)  5  (62 
7  62)  5  (62  7)  (62  5)  62  7  57.
Now try 380  39 using the shortcut we just learned. So 39 
10  390, which is too high by 10. Hence the answer is 9 with a
remainder of 39  10  29.
Your next challenge is to divide a two-digit number into a
four-digit number:
3657  54
Since 54  100  5400, you know your answer will be a
two-digit number. To arrive at the ﬁrst digit of the answer, you
need to ﬁgure how many times 54 goes into 3657. Since 54 
70  3780 is a little high, you know the answer must be 60
something.
Next, multiply 54  60  3240 and subtract 3657  3240 
417. Once you say the 60, your problem has been simpliﬁed to
417  54. Since 54  8  432 is a little too high, your last digit
is 7 with the remainder 54  15  39.

way is to commit the following fractions—from halves through
elevenths—to memory. This isn’t as hard as it sounds. As you’ll
see below, most one-digit fractions have special properties that
make them hard to forget. Anytime you can reduce a fraction to

Note that the same pattern of numbers repeats itself in each
fraction. Only the starting point varies. You can ﬁgure out the
starting point in a ﬂash by multiplying .14 by the numerator. In
the case of 2
7
, 2  .14  .28, so use the sequence that begins
with the 2, namely .285714. Likewise with 3
7
, since 3  .14 
.42, use the sequence that begins with 4, namely .428571. The
rest follow in a similar way.
You will have to calculate fractions higher than 1

 as you
would any other division problem. However, keep your eyes
peeled for ways of simplifying such problems. For example, you
can simplify the fraction 1

4
 by dividing both numbers by 2, to
reduce it to 1
9
7
, which is easier to compute.
If the denominator of the fraction is an even number, you can
simplify the fraction by reducing it in half, even if the numerator
is odd. For example:

Dividing the numerator and denominator in half reduces it to
a sevenths fraction. Although the sevenths sequence previously

calculation, the number you memorized will pop up:
As you can see, you needn’t work out the entire problem.

TESTING FOR DIVISIBILITY
In the last section, we saw how division problems could be sim-
pliﬁed when both numbers were divisible by a common factor.
We end this chapter with a brief discussion of how to determine
whether one number is a factor of another number. Being able
to ﬁnd the factors of a number helps us simplify division prob-
lems and can speed up many multiplication problems. This will
also be a very useful tool when we get to advanced multiplica-
tion, as you will often be looking for ways to factor a two-,

16

Secrets of Mental Math

three-, or even a ﬁve-digit number in the middle of a multiplica-
tion problem. Being able to factor these numbers quickly is very
handy. And besides, I think some of the rules are just beautiful.
It’s easy to test whether a number is divisible by 2. All you
need to do is to check if the last digit is even. If the last digit is 2,
4, 6, 8, or 0, the entire number is divisible by 2.
To test whether a number is divisible by 4, check if the two-
digit number at the end is divisible by 4. The number 57,852 is a
multiple of 4 because 52  13  4. The number 69,346 is not
a multiple of 4 because 46 is not a multiple of 4. The reason
this works is because 4 divides evenly into 100 and thus into
any multiple of 100. Thus, since 4 divides evenly into 57,800,
and 4 divides into 52, we know that 4 divides evenly into their
sum, 57,852.
Likewise, since 8 divides into 1000, to test for divisibility by
8, check the last three digits of the number. For the number
14,918, divide 8 into 918. Since this leaves you with a remain-
der (918  8  1146
8
), the number is not divisible by 8. You
could also have observed this by noticing that 18 (the last two
digits of 14,918) is not divisible by 4, and since 14,918 is not
divisible by 4, it can’t be divisible by 8 either.
When it comes to divisibility by 3, here’s a cool rule that’s
easy to remember: A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the
sum of its digits are divisible by 3—no matter how many digits
are in the number. To test whether 57,852 is divisible by 3, sim-
ply add 5  7  8  5  2  27. Since 27 is a multiple of 3, we
know 57,852 is a multiple of 3. The same amazing rule holds
true for divisibility by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if
its digits sum to a multiple of 9. Hence, 57,852 is a multiple of
9, whereas 31,416, which sums to 15, is not. The reason this
works is based on the fact that the numbers 1, 10, 100, 1,000,
10,000, and so on, are all 1 greater than a multiple of 9.
Divide and Conquer: Mental Division
99

A number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is even and divisi-
ble by 3, so it is easy to test divisibility by 6.
To establish whether a number is divisible by 5 is even easier.
Any number, no matter how large, is a multiple of 5 if and only
if it ends in 5 or 0.
Establishing divisibility by 11 is almost as easy as determin-
ing divisibility by 3 or 9. A number is divisible by 11 if and only
if you arrive at either 0 or a multiple of 11 when you alternately
subtract and add the digits of a number. For instance, 73,958 is
not divisible by 11 since 7  3  9  5  8  16. However, the
numbers 8,492 and 73,194 are multiples of 11, since 8  4  9 
2  11 and 7  3  1  9  4  0. The reason this works is
based, like the rule for 3s and 9s, on the fact that the numbers 1,
100, 10,000, and 1,000,000 are 1 more than a multiple of 11,
whereas the numbers 10, 1,000, 100,000, and so on are 1 less
than a multiple of 11.
Testing for divisibility by 7 is a bit trickier. If you add or sub-
tract a number that is a multiple of 7 to the number you are test-
ing, and the resulting number is a multiple of 7, then the test is
positive. I always choose to add or subtract a multiple of 7 so
that the resulting sum or difference ends in 0. For example, to
test the number 5292, I subtract 42 (a multiple of 7) to obtain
5250. Next, I get rid of the 0 at the end (since dividing by ten
does not affect divisibility by seven), leaving me with 525. Then
I repeat the process by adding 35 (a multiple of 7), which gives
me 560. When I delete the 0, I’m left with 56, which I know to
be a multiple of 7. Therefore, the original number 5292 is divis-
ible by 7.
This method works not only for 7s, but also for any odd
number that doesn’t end in 5. For example, to test whether
8792 is divisible by 13, subtract 4  13  52 from 8792, to
Secrets of Mental Math
100

arrive at 8740. Dropping the 0 results in 874. Then add 2  13 
26 to arrive at 900. Dropping the two 0s leaves you with 9,
which is clearly not a multiple of 13. Therefore, 8792 is not a
multiple of 13.

Dividing Fractions
Dividing fractions is just as easy as multiplying fractions.
There’s just one extra step. First, turn the second fraction upside
down (this is called the reciprocal) then multiply. For instance,
the reciprocal of 4

Simplifying Fractions
Fractions can be thought of as little division problems. For
instance, 6
3
 is the same as 6  3  2. The fraction 1
4
 is the same
as 1  4 (which is .25 in decimal form). Now we know that
when we multiply any number by 1, the number stays the same.
For example, 3

Good Enough:The Art 
of “Guesstimation”
So far you’ve been perfecting the mental techniques necessary to
figure out the exact answers to math problems. Often, however,
all you’ll want is a ballpark estimate. Say you’re getting quotes
from different lenders on reﬁnancing your home. All you really
need at this information-gathering stage is a ballpark estimate
of what your monthly payments will be. Or say you’re settling a
restaurant bill with a group of friends and you don’t want to ﬁg-
ure each person’s bill to the penny. The guesstimation methods
described in this chapter will make both these tasks—and many
more just like them—much easier. Addition, subtraction, divi-
sion, and multiplication all lend themselves to guesstimation. As
usual, you’ll do your computations from left to right.
ADDITION GUESSTIMATION
Guesstimation is a good way to make your life easier when the
numbers of a problem are too long to remember. The trick is to
round the original numbers up or down:

George Parker Bidder: The Calculating Engineer
T
he British have had their share of lightning calculators, and the
mental performances of George Parker Bidder (1806–1878),born
in Devonshire, were as impressive as any. Like most lightning calcula-
tors, Bidder began to try his hand (and mind) at mental arithmetic as
a young lad. Learning to count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide by
playing with marbles, Bidder went on tour with his father at age nine.
Almost no question was too difﬁcult for him to handle. “If the
moon is 123,256 miles from the earth and sound travels four miles a
minute, how long would it take for sound to travel from the earth to
the moon?” The young Bidder, his face wrinkled in thought for nearly
a minute, replied,“Twenty-one days, nine hours, thirty-four minutes.”
(We know now that the distance is closer to 240,000 miles and
sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space.) At age ten, Bidder
mentally computed the square root of 119,550,669,121 as 345,761 in
a mere thirty seconds. In 1818, Bidder and the American lightning cal-
culator Zerah Colburn were paired in a mental calculating duel in
which Bidder, apparently,“outnumbered” Colburn.
Riding on his fame, George Bidder entered the University of Edin-
burgh and went on to become one of the more respected engineers
in England. In parliamentary debates over railroad conﬂicts, Bidder
was frequently called as a witness, which made the opposition shud-
der; as one said,“Nature had endowed him with particular qualities
that did not place his opponents on a fair footing.” Unlike Colburn,
who retired as a lightning calculator at age twenty, Bidder kept it up
for his entire life. As late as 1878, in fact, just before his death, Bidder
calculated the number of vibrations of light striking the eye in one
second, based on the fact that there are 36,918 waves of red light per
inch, and light travels at approximately 190,000 miles per second.

Notice that we rounded the ﬁrst number down to the nearest
thousand and the second number up. Since the exact answer is
14,186, our relative error is small.
If you want to be more exact, instead of rounding off to the
nearest thousand, round off to the nearest hundred:
ª
The answer is only 14 off from the exact answer, an error of
less than .1%. This is what I call a good guesstimation!
Try a ﬁve-digit addition problem, rounding to the nearest
hundred:
ª
By rounding to the nearest hundred, our answer will always
be off by less than 100. If the answer is larger than 10,000, your
guesstimate will be within 1% of the exact answer.
Now let’s try something wild:
ª
or
If you round to the nearest million, you get an answer of 31
million, off by roughly 285,000. Not bad, but you can do better
by rounding to the nearest hundred thousand, as we’ve shown
in the right-hand column. Again your guesstimate will be within

1% of the precise answer. If you can compute these smaller
problems exactly, you can guesstimate the answer to any addi-
tion problem.
Guesstimating at the Supermarket
Let’s try a real-world example. Have you ever gone to the store
and wondered what the total is going to be before the cashier
rings it up? For estimating the total, my technique is to round
the prices to the nearest 50¢. For example, while the cashier is
adding the numbers shown below on the left, I mentally add the
numbers shown on the right:
My ﬁnal ﬁgure is usually within a dollar of the exact total.
SUBTRACTION GUESSTIMATION
The way to guesstimate the answers to subtraction problems is
the same—you round to the nearest thousand or hundreds digit,
preferably the latter:

ª
or
You can see that rounding to the nearest thousand leaves
you with an answer quite a bit off the mark. By rounding to the
second digit (hundreds, in the example), your answer will usu-
ally be within 3% of the exact answer. For this problem, your
answer is off by only 52, a relative error of 2%. If you round to
the third digit, the relative error will usually be below 1%. For
instance:
ª
or
By rounding the numbers to the third digit rather than to the
second digit, you improve the accuracy of the estimate by a sig-
niﬁcant amount.
DIVISION GUESSTIMATION
The ﬁrst, and most important, step in guesstimating the answer to
a division problem is to determine the magnitude of the answer:

The next step is to round off the larger numbers to the near-
est thousand and change the 57,867 to 58,000. Dividing 6 into
58 gives you 9 with a remainder. But the most important com-
ponent in this problem is where to place the 9.
For example, multiplying 6  90 yields 540, while multiply-
ing 6  900 yields 5,400, both of which are too small. But 6 
9,000  54,000, which is pretty close to the answer. This tells
you the answer is 9,000 and something. You can estimate just
what that something is by ﬁrst subtracting 58  54  4. At this
point you could bring down the 0 and divide 6 into 40, and so
forth. But if you’re on your toes, you’ll realize that dividing 6
into 4 gives you 4
6
 
2
3
 ª .667. Since you know the answer is
9,000 something, you’re now in a position to guess 9,667. In
fact, the actual answer is 9,645—darn close!
Division on this level is simple. But what about large division
problems? Let’s say we want to compute, just for fun, the
amount of money a professional athlete earns a day if he makes
$5,000,000 a year:
365 days$5,0
00,0
00
First you must determine the magnitude of the answer. Does
this player earn thousands every day? Well, 365  1000 
365,000, which is too low.
Does he earn tens of thousands every day? Well, 365 
10,000  3,650,000, and that’s more like it. To guesstimate your
answer, divide the ﬁrst two digits (or 36 into 50) and ﬁgure that’s
11
3
4
6
, or 11
7
8
. Since 18 goes into 70 about 4 times, your guess is that
the athlete earns about $14,000. The exact answer is $13,698.63
per day. Not a bad estimate (and not a bad salary!).
Here’s an astronomical calculation for you. How many sec-

onds does it take light to get from the sun to the earth? Well,
light travels at 186,282 miles per second, and the sun is (on aver-
age) 92,960,130 miles away. I doubt you’re particularly eager to
attempt this problem by hand. Fortunately, it’s relatively simple
to guesstimate an answer. First, simplify the problem:
186,28292,9
60,1
30 ª 18693,0
00
Now divide 186 into 930, which yields 5 with no remainder.
Then append the two 0s you removed from 93,000 and you get
500 seconds. The exact answer is 499.02 seconds, so this is a
very respectable guesstimate.
MULTIPLICATION GUESSTIMATION
You can use much the same techniques to guesstimate your
answers to multiplication problems. For example,
ª
Rounding up to the nearest multiple of 10 simpliﬁes the
problem considerably, but you’re still off by 252, or about 5%.
You can do better if you round both numbers by the same
amount, but in opposite directions. That is, if you round 88 by
increasing 2, you should also decrease 54 by 2:

114

Instead of a 1-by-1 multiplication problem, you now have a
2-by-1 problem, which should be easy enough for you to do.
Your guesstimation is off by only 1.5%.
When you guesstimate the answer to multiplication problems
by rounding the larger number up and the smaller number
down, your guesstimate will be a little low. If you round the
larger number down and the smaller number up so that the
numbers are closer together, your guesstimate will be a little
high. The larger the amount by which you round up or down,
the greater your guesstimate will be off from the exact answer.
For example:
ª
Since the numbers are closer together after you round them
off, your guesstimate is a little high.
ª
Since the numbers are farther apart, the estimated answer is
too low, though again, not by much. You can see that this multi-
plication guesstimation method works quite well. Also notice that
this problem is just 672 and that our approximation is just the ﬁrst
step of the squaring techniques. Let’s look at one more example:

We observe that the approximation is most accurate when
the original numbers are close together. Try estimating a 3-by-2
multiplication problem:
ª
By rounding 63 down to 60 and 728 up to 731, you create 
a 3-by-1 multiplication problem, which puts your guesstimate
within 2004 of the exact answer, an error of 4.3%.
Now try guesstimating the following 3-by-3 problem:
ª
You will notice that although you rounded both numbers up
and down by 8, your guesstimate is off by over 1000. That’s
because the multiplication problem is larger and the size of the
rounding number is larger, so the resulting estimate will be off
by a greater amount. But the relative error is still under 1%.
How high can you go with this system of guesstimating multi-
plication problems? As high as you want. You just need to know
the names of large numbers. A thousand thousand is a million,
and a thousand million is a billion. Knowing these names and
numbers, try this one on for size:

As before, the objective is to round the numbers to simpler
numbers such as 29,000,000 and 14,000. Dropping the 0s for
now, this is just a 2-by-2 multiplication problem: 29  14  406
(29  14  29  7  2  203  2  406). Hence the answer is
roughly 406 billion, since a thousand million is a billion.
SQUARE ROOT ESTIMATION:
DIVIDE AND AVERAGE
The quantity n, the square root of a number n, is the number
which, when multiplied by itself, will give you n. For example,
the square root of 9 is 3 because 3  3  9. The square root is
used in many science and engineering problems and is almost
always solved with a calculator. The following method provides
an accurate estimate of the answer.
In square root estimation your goal is to come up with a num-
ber that when multiplied by itself approximates the original num-
ber. Since the square root of most numbers is not a whole number,
your estimate is likely to contain a fraction or decimal point.
Let’s start by guesstimating the square root of 19. Your ﬁrst
step is to think of the number that when multiplied by itself
comes closest to 19. Well, 4  4  16 and 5  5  25. Since 25
is too high, the answer must be 4 point something. Your next
step is to divide 4 into 19, giving you 4.75. Now, since 4  4 is
less than 4  4.75  19, which in turn is less than 4.75  4.75,
we know that 19 (or 4  4.75) lies between 42 and 4.752. Hence,
the square root of 19 lies between 4 and 4.75.
I’d guess the square root of 19 to be about halfway between,
at 4.375. In fact, the square root of 19 (rounded to three deci-
mal places) is 4.359, so our guesstimate is pretty close. We illus-
trate this procedure as follows:

117

Divide:
Average:
 4.375
Actually, we can obtain this answer another way, which you
might ﬁnd easier. We know 4 squared is 16, which is shy of 19
by 3. To improve our guess, we “add the error divided by twice
our guess.” Here, we add 3 divided by 8 to get 43
8
  4.375. We
note that this method will always produce an answer that is a
little higher than the exact answer.
Now you try a slightly harder one. What’s the square root
of 87?
Divide:
Average:
 9.33
First come up with your ballpark ﬁgure, which you can get
fairly quickly by noting that 9  9  81 and 10  10  100,
which means the answer is 9 point something. Carrying out the
division of 9 into 87 to two decimal places, you get 9.66. To

Using this technique, it’s pretty easy to guesstimate the square
root of two-digit numbers. But what about three-digit numbers?
Actually, they are not much harder. I can tell you right off the bat
that all three-digit and four-digit numbers have two-digit square
roots before the decimal point. And the procedure for comput-
ing square roots is the same, no matter how large the number.
For instance, to compute the square root of 679, ﬁrst ﬁnd your
ballpark ﬁgure. Because 20 squared is 400 and 30 squared is
900, the square root of 679 must lie between 20 and 30.
When you divide 20 into 679, you get approximately 34.
Averaging 20 and 34 gives you a guesstimate of 27, but here’s a
better estimate. If you know that 25 squared is 625, then your
error is 679  625  54. Dividing that by 50, we have 5

1.08. Hence our improved guesstimate is 25  1.08  26.08.
(For an even better estimate, if you know that 26 squared is
676, your error is 3, so add 5
3
2
 ª .06 to get 26.06.) The exact
answer is 26.06, rounded to two decimal places.
To guesstimate the square root of four-digit numbers, look at
the ﬁrst two digits of the number to determine the ﬁrst digit of
the square root. For example, to ﬁnd the square root of 7369,
consider the square root of 73. Since 8  8  64 and 9  9 
81, 8 must be the ﬁrst digit of the square root. So the answer is
80 something. Now proceed the usual way. Dividing 80 into
7369 gives 92 plus a fraction, so a good guesstimate is 86. If you
squared 86 to get 7396, you would be high by 27, so you should
subtract 

right on the money.
To guesstimate the square root of a six-digit number like
593,472 would seem like an impossible task for the uninitiated,
but for you it’s no sweat. Since 7002  490,000, and 8002 
640,000, the square of 593,472 must lie between 700 and 800.
In fact, all ﬁve-digit and six-digit numbers have three-digit square

119

roots. In practice, you only need to look at the square root of
the ﬁrst two digits of six-digit numbers (or the ﬁrst digit of ﬁve
numbers). Once you ﬁgure out that the square root of 59 lies
between 7 and 8, you know your answer is in the 700s.
Now proceed in the usual manner:
Divide:
Average:
ª
 773.5
The exact square root of 593,472 is 770.37 (to ﬁve places),
so you’re pretty close. But you could have been closer, as the fol-
lowing trick demonstrates. Note that the ﬁrst two digits, 59, are
closer to 64 (8  8) than they are to 49 (7  7). Because of this
you can start your guesstimation with the number 8 and pro-
ceed from there:

Just for fun, let’s do a real whopper—the square root of
28,674,529. This isn’t as hard as it might seem. Your ﬁrst step is
to round to the nearest large number—in this case, just ﬁnd the
square root of 29.

All seven-digit and eight-digit numbers have four-digit square
roots, so 5.4 becomes 5400, your estimate. The exact answer is
slightly greater than 5354.8. Not bad!

The Mathematical Duel of Évariste Galois
T
he tragic story of the French mathematician Évariste Galois
(1811–1832) killed at the age of twenty in a duel over “an infa-
mous coquette” is legendary in the annals of the history of mathe-
matics. A precociously brilliant student, Galois laid the foundation for
a branch of mathematics known as group theory. Legend has it that
he penned his theory the night before the duel, anticipating his
demise and wanting to leave his legacy to the mathematics commu-
nity. Hours before his death, on May 30, 1832, Galois wrote to
Auguste Chevalier: “I have made some new discoveries in analysis.
The ﬁrst concerns the theory of equations, the others integral func-
tions.” After describing these, he asked his friend: “Make a public
request of Jacobi or Gauss to give their opinions not as to the truth
but as to the importance of these theorems. After that, I hope some
men will ﬁnd it proﬁtable to sort out this mess.”
Romantic legend and historical truth, however, do not always
match.What Galois penned the night before his death were correc-
tions and editorial changes to papers that had been accepted by the
Academy of Sciences long before. Further, Galois’s initial papers had
been submitted three years prior to the duel, when he was all of sev-
enteen! It was after this that Galois became embroiled in political
controversy, was arrested, spent time in a prison dungeon, and, ulti-
mately, got himself mixed up in a dispute over a woman and killed.
Aware of his own precocity, Galois noted, “I have carried out
researches which will halt many savants in theirs.” For over a century
that proved to be the case.

MORE TIPS ON TIPS
As we indicated in Chapter 0, it is easy to ﬁgure out tips for
most situations. For example, to ﬁgure out a 10% tip, we
merely multiply the bill by 0.1 (or divide the bill by 10). For
example, if a bill came to $42, then a 10% tip would be $4.20.
To determine a 20% tip, you simply multiply the bill by 0.2, or
double the amount of a 10% tip. Thus a 20% tip on a $42 bill
would be $8.40.
To determine a 15% tip, we have a few options. If you have
mastered the techniques of Chapter 2, and are comfortable with
multiplying by 15  5  3, you can simply multiply the bill by
15, then divide by 100. For example, with a $42 bill, we have
42  15  42  5  3  210  3  630, which when divided by
100, gives us a tip of $6.30. Another method is to take the aver-
age of a 10% tip and a 20% tip. From our earlier calculation,
this would be

 $6.30
Perhaps the most popular approach to taking a 15% tip is to
take 10% of the bill, cut that amount in half (which would be a
5% tip), then add those two numbers together. So, for instance,
with a $42 bill, you would add $4.20 plus half that amount,
$2.10, to get
$4.20  $2.10  $6.30
Let’s use all three methods to compute 15% on a bill that is
$67. By the direct method, 67  3  5  201  5  1005,
which when divided by 100 gives us $10.05. By the averaging
$12.60



2
Secrets of Mental Math
122

method, we average the 10% tip of $6.70 with the 20% tip of
$13.40, to get

 $10.05
Using the last method, we add $6.70 to half that amount,
$3.35 to get
$6.70  $3.35  $10.05
Finally, to calculate a 25% tip, we offer two methods. Either
multiply the amount by 25, then divide by 100, or divide the
amount by 4 (perhaps by cutting the amount in half twice). For
example, with a $42 bill, you can compute 42  25  42  5 
5  210  5  1050, which when divided by 100 produces a tip
of $10.50. Or you can divide the original amount directly by 4,
or cut in half twice: half of $42 is $21, and half of that is
$10.50. With a $67 bill, I would probably divide by 4 directly:
since 67  4  163

, we get a 25% tip of $16.75.
NOT-TOO-TAXING CALCULATIONS
In this section, I will show you my method for mentally estimat-
ing sales tax. For some tax rates, like 5% or 6% or 10%, the
calculation is straightforward. For example, to calculate 6%
tax, just multiply by 6, then divide by 100. For instance, if the
sale came to $58, then 58  6  348, which when divided by
100 gives the exact sales tax of $3.48. (So your total amount
would be $61.48.)
But how would you calculate a sales tax of 61



123

I will show you several ways to do this calculation, and you
choose the one that seems easiest for you. Perhaps the easiest
way to add half of a percent to any dollar amount is to simply
cut the dollar amount in half, then turn it into cents. For exam-
ple, with $58, since half of 58 is 29, simply add 29 cents to the
6% tax (already computed as $3.48) to get a sales tax of $3.77.
Another way to calculate the answer (or a good mental esti-
mate) is to take the 6% tax, divide it by 12, then add those two
numbers. For example, since 6% of $58 is $3.48, and 12 goes
into 348 almost 30 times, then add 30 cents for an estimate of
$3.78, which is only off by a penny. If you would rather divide
by 10 instead of 12, go ahead and do it. You will be calculating
6.6% instead of 6.5% (since 1
6
0
  0.6) but that should still be a
very good estimate. Here, you would take $3.48 and add 34¢ to
get $3.82.
Let’s try some other sales tax percentages. How can we calcu-
late 71
4
% sales tax on $124? Begin by computing 7% of 124.
From the methods shown in Chapter 2, you know that 124 
7  868, so 7% of 124 is $8.68. To add a quarter percent, you
can divide the original dollar amount by 4 (or cut it in half,
twice) and turn the dollars into cents. Here, 124  4  31, so
add 31¢ to $8.68 to get an exact sales tax of $8.99.
Another way to arrive at 31¢ is to take your 7% sales tax,
$8.68, and divide it by 28. The reason this works is because 2

 
1
4
. For a quick mental estimate, I would probably divide $8.68
by 30, to get about 29¢, for an approximate total sales tax of
$8.97.
When you divide by 30, then you are actually computing a
tax of 73
7
0
%, which is approximately 7.23% instead of 7.25%.
How would you calculate a sales tax of 7.75%? Probably for
most approximations, it is sufﬁcient to just say that it is a little
less than 8% sales tax. But to get a better approximation, here
Secrets of Mental Math
124

are some suggestions. As you saw in the last example, if you can
easily calculate a 1
4
% adjustment, then simply triple that amount
for the 3
4
% adjustment. For example, to calculate 7.75% of
$124, you ﬁrst calculate 7% to obtain $8.68. If you calculated
that 1
4
% is 31¢, then 3
4
% would be 93¢, for a grand total of
$8.68  0.93  $9.61. For a quick approximation, you can
exploit the fact that 7
9
  .777 is approximately .75, so you can
divide the 7% sales tax by 9 to get slightly more than the .75%
adjustment. In this example, since $8.68 divided by 9 is about
96¢, simply add $8.68  0.96  $9.64 for a slight overestimate.
We can use this approximation procedure for any sales tax.
For a general formula, to estimate the sales tax of $A.B%, ﬁrst
multiply the amount of the sale by A%. Then divide this amount
by the number D, where A/D is equal to 0.B. (Thus D is equal
to A times the reciprocal of B.) Adding these numbers together
gives you the total sales tax (or an approximate one, if you
rounded D to an easier nearby number). For instance, with
7.75%, the magic divisor D would be 7 

sales tax on 6%, then divide that number by 16, since 1

(To divide a number by 16, divide the number by 4 twice, or
divide the number by 8, then by 2.) Try to come up with meth-
ods for ﬁnding the sales tax in the state that you live in. You will
ﬁnd that the problem is not as taxing as it seems!
SOME “INTEREST-ING” CALCULATIONS
Finally, we’ll brieﬂy mention some practical problems pertain-
ing to interest, from the standpoint of watching your invest-
ments grow, and paying off money that you owe.
We begin with the famous Rule of 70, which tells you approx-
imately how long it takes your money to double: To ﬁnd the
Good Enough: The Art of “Guesstimation”
125

number of years that it will take for your money to double,
divide the number 70 by the rate of interest.
Suppose that you ﬁnd an investment that promises to pay you
5% interest per year. Since 70  5  14, then it will take about
14 years for your money to double. For example, if you invested
$1000 in a savings account that paid that interest, then after
14 years, it will have $1000(1.05)14  $1979.93. With an inter-
est rate of 7%, the Rule of 70 indicates that it will take about
10 years for your money to double. Indeed, if you invest
$1000 at that annual interest rate, you will have after ten years
$1000(1.07)10  $1967.15. At a rate of 2%, the Rule of 70 says
that it should take about 35 years to double, as shown below:
$1000(1.02)35  $1999.88
A similar method is called the Rule of 110, which indicates
how long it takes for your money to triple. For example, at 5%
interest, since 110  5  22, it should take about 22 years to
turn $1000 into $3000. This is veriﬁed by the calculation
$1000(1.05)22  $2925.26. The Rule of 70 and the Rule of 110
are based on properties of the number e  2.71828 . . . and
“natural logarithms” (studied in precalculus), but fortunately we
do not need to utilize this higher mathematics to apply the rules.
Now suppose that you borrow money, and you have to pay the
money back. For example, suppose that you borrow $360,000
at an annual interest rate of 6% per year (which we shall inter-
pret to mean that interest will accumulate at a rate of 0.5% per
month) and suppose that you have thirty years to pay off the
loan. About how much will you need to pay each month? First
of all, you will need to pay $360,000 times 0.5%  $1,800 each
month just to cover what you owe in interest. (Although, actu-
ally, what you owe in interest will go down gradually over time.)
Secrets of Mental Math
126

Since you will make 30  12  360 monthly payments, then
paying an extra $1,000 each month would cover the rest of the
loan, so an upper bound on your monthly payment is $1,800 
$1,000  $2,800. But fortunately you do not need to pay that
much extra. Here is my rule of thumb for estimating your
monthly payment.
Let i be your monthly interest rate. (This is your annual
interest rate divided by 12.) Then to pay back a loan of $P in
N months, your monthly payment M is about
M 
In our last example, P  $360,000, and i  0.005, so our for-
mula indicates that our monthly payment should be about
M 
Notice that the ﬁrst two numbers in the numerator multiply
to $1,800. Using a calculator (for a change) to compute
(1.005)360  6.02, we have that your monthly payment should
be about $1,800(6.02)/5.02, which is about $2,160 per month.
Here’s one more example. Suppose you wish to pay for a car,
and after your down payment, you owe $18,000 to be paid off
in ﬁve years, with an annual interest rate of 4%. If there was no
interest, you would have to pay $18,000/60  $300 per month.
Since the ﬁrst year’s interest is $18,000(.04)  $720, you know
that you will need to pay no more than $300  $60  $360.
Using our formula, since the monthly interest rate is i  .04/12 
0.00333, we have
M  $18,000(0.0333)(1.00333)60

and since (1.00333)60  1.22, we have a monthly payment of
about $60(1.22)/(0.22)  $333.
We conclude with some exercises that we hope will hold your
interest.

Chapter 6
Math for the Board:
Pencil-and-Paper Math
In the Introduction to this book I discussed the many beneﬁts
you will get from being able to do mental calculations. In this
chapter I present some methods for speeding up pencil-and-
paper calculations as well. Since calculators have replaced much
of the need for pencil-and-paper arithmetic in most practical sit-
uations, I’ve chosen to concentrate on the lost art of calculating
square roots and the ﬂashy criss-cross method for multiplying
large numbers. Since these are, admittedly, mostly for mental
gymnastics and not for some practical application, I will ﬁrst
touch on addition and subtraction and show you just a couple
of little tricks for speeding up the process and for checking your
answers. These techniques can be used in daily life, as you’ll see.
If you are eager to get to the more challenging multiplication
problems, you can skip this chapter and go directly to Chapter 7,
which is critical for mastering the big problems in Chapter 8. If
you need a break and just want to have some fun, then I rec-
ommend going through this chapter—you’ll enjoy playing with
pencil and paper once again.

COLUMNS OF NUMBERS
Adding long columns of numbers is just the sort of problem you
might run into in business or while ﬁguring out your personal
ﬁnances. Add the following column of numbers as you normally
would and then check to see how I do it.

When I have pencil and paper at my disposal, I add the num-
bers from top to bottom and from right to left, just as we learned
to do in school. With practice, you can do these problems in
your head as fast or faster than you can with a calculator. As 
I sum the digits, the only numbers that I “hear” are the partial
sums. That is, when I sum the ﬁrst (rightmost) column 8  4 
0  7  7  5, I hear 8 . . . 12 . . . 19 . . . 26 . . . 31. Then I put
down the 1, carry the 3, and proceed as usual. The next column
would then sound like 3 . . . 5 . . . 13 . . . 15 . . . 22 . . . 23 . . . 25.
Once I have my ﬁnal answer, I write it down, then check my
computation by adding the numbers from bottom to top and, I
hope, arrive at the same answer.
For instance, the ﬁrst column would be summed, from bot-
tom to top, as 5  7  7  0  4  8 (which in my mind sounds
like 5 . . . 12 . . . 19 . . . 23 . . . 31). Then I mentally carry the 3,
and add 3  2  1  7  2  8  2, and so on. By adding the

numbers in a different order, you are less likely to make the
same mistake twice. Of course, if the answers differ, then at least
one of the calculations must be wrong.
MOD SUMS
If I’m not sure about my answer, I sometimes check my solution
by a method I call mod sums (because it is based on the elegant
mathematics of modular arithmetic). This method also goes by
the names of digital roots and casting out nines. I admit this
method is not as practical, but it’s easy to use.
With the mod sums method, you sum the digits of each num-
ber until you are left with a single digit. For example, to com-
pute the mod sum of 4328, add 4  3  2  8  17. Then add
the digits of 17 to get 1  7  8. Hence the mod sum of 4328 is
8. For the previous problem the mod sums of each number are
computed as follows:

As illustrated above, the next step is to add all the mod sums
together (8  2  8  1  5  5). This yields 29, which sums to
11, which in turn sums to 2. Note that the mod sum of 8651,
your original total of the original digits, is also 2. This is not a
coincidence! If you have computed the answer and the mod
sums correctly, your ﬁnal mod sums must be the same. If they
are different, you have deﬁnitely made a mistake somewhere:
there is about a 1 in 9 chance that the mod sums will match
accidentally. If there is a mistake, then this method will detect it
8 times out of 9.
The mod sum method is more commonly known to mathe-
maticians and accountants as casting out nines because the mod
sum of a number happens to be equal to the remainder obtained
when the number is divided by 9. In the case of the answer
above—8651—the mod sum was 2. If you divide 8651 by 9,
the answer is 961 with a remainder of 2. In other words, if you
cast out 9 from 8651 a total of 961 times, you’ll have a remain-
der of 2. There’s one small exception to this. Recall that the sum
of the digits of any multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 9. Thus, if
a number is a multiple of 9, it will have a mod sum of 9, even
though it has a remainder of 0.
SUBTRACTING ON PAPER
You can’t, of course, subtract columns of numbers the same way
you add them. Rather, you subtract them number by number,
which means that all subtraction problems involve just two
numbers. Once again, with pencil and paper at our disposal, it
is easier to subtract from right to left. To check your answer, just
add the answer to the second number. If you are correct, then
you should get the top number.
If you want, you can also use mod sums to check your
Secrets of Mental Math
134

answer. The key is to subtract the mod sums you arrive at and
then compare that number to the mod sum of your answer:

There’s one extra twist. If the difference in the mod sums is a
negative number or 0, add 9 to it. For instance:
PENCIL-AND-PAPER SQUARE ROOTS
With the advent of pocket calculators, the pencil-and-paper
method of calculating square roots has practically become a lost
art. You’ve already seen how to estimate square roots mentally.
Now I’ll show you how to do it exactly, using pencil and paper.
Remember how in guesstimating square roots you calculated
the square root of nineteen? Let’s look at that problem again, this
time using a method that will give you the exact square root.

I will describe the general method that ﬁts all cases, and illus-
trate it with the above example.
Step 1. If the number of digits to the left of the decimal point is
one, three, ﬁve, seven, or any odd number of digits, the ﬁrst digit
of the answer (or quotient) will be the largest number whose
square is less than the ﬁrst digit of the original number. If the num-
ber of digits to the left of the decimal point is two, four, six, or any
even number of digits, the ﬁrst digit of the quotient will be the
largest number whose square is less than the ﬁrst two digits of the
dividend. In this case, 19 is a two-digit number, so the ﬁrst digit of
the quotient is the largest number whose square is less than 19.
That number is 4. Write the answer above either the ﬁrst digit of
the dividend (if odd) or the second digit of the dividend (if even).
Step 2. Subtract the square of the number in step 1, then bring
down two more digits. Since 42  16, we subtract 19  16  3.
We bring down two 0s, leaving 300 as the current remainder.
Step 3. Double the current quotient (ignoring any decimal point),
and put a blank space in following it. Here 4  2  8. Put down
8   to the left of the current remainder, in this case 300.

8708  8 
69664

Step 4. The next digit of the quotient will be the largest number
that can be put in both blanks so that the resulting multiplica-
tion problem is less than or equal to the current remainder. In
this case the number is 3, because 83  3  249, whereas 84 
4  336, which is too high. Write this number above the second
digit of the next two numbers; in this case the 3 would go above
the second 0. We now have a quotient of 4.3.
Step 5. If you want more digits, subtract the product from the
remainder (i.e., 300  249  51), and bring down the next two
digits; in this case 51 turns into 5100, which becomes the cur-
rent remainder. Now repeat steps 3 and 4.
To get the third digit of the square root, double the quo-
tient, again ignoring the decimal point (i.e., 43  2  86). Place
86   to the left of 5100. The number 5 gives us 865  5 
4325, the largest product below 5100. The 5 goes above the
next two numbers, in this case two more 0s. We now have a
quotient of 4.35. For even more digits, repeat the process as
we’ve done in the example.
Here’s an example of an odd number of digits before the dec-
imal point:

Next, we’ll calculate the square root of a four-digit number.
In this case—as with two-digit numbers—we consider the ﬁrst
two digits of the problem to determine the ﬁrst digit of the
square root:

Finally, if the number for which you are calculating the
square root is a perfect square, you will know it as soon as you
end up with a remainder of 0 and nothing to bring down. For
example:
PENCIL-AND-PAPER MULTIPLICATION
For pencil-and-paper multiplication I use the criss-cross method,
which enables me to write down the entire answer on one line
without ever writing any partial results! This is one of the most

impressive displays of mathemagics when you have pencil and
paper at your disposal. Many lightning calculators in the past
earned their reputations with this method. They would be given
two large numbers and write down the answer almost instanta-
neously. The criss-cross method is best learned by example.
Step 1. First, multiply 4  7 to yield 28, write down the 8, and
mentally carry the 2 to the next computation, below.
Step 2. Following the diagram, add 2  (4  4)  (3  7)  39,
write down the 9, and carry the 3 to the ﬁnal computation,
below.

You have now written the answer: 1598.

Answer: 649,
986
Notice that the number of multiplications at each step is 1, 2,
3, 2, and 1 respectively. The mathematics underlying the criss-
cross method is nothing more that the distributive law. For
instance, 853  762  (800  50  3)  (700  60  2) 
(3  2)  [(5  2)  (3  6)]  10  [(8  2)  (5  6) 
(3  7)]  100  [(8  6)  (5  7)]  1000  (8  7) 
10,000, which are precisely the calculations of the criss-cross
method.
You can check your answer with the mod sum method by
multiplying the mod sums of the two numbers and computing
the resulting number’s mod sum. Compare this number to the
mod sum of the answer. If your answer is correct, they must
match. For example:

If the mod sums don’t match, you made a mistake. This
method will detect mistakes, on average, about 8 times out of 9.
In the case of 3-by-2 multiplication problems, the procedure
is the same except you treat the hundreds digit of the second
number as a 0:

Of course, you would normally just ignore the multiplication
by zero, in practice.
You can use the criss-cross to do any size multiplication prob-
lem. To answer the 5-by-5 problem below will require nine
steps. The number of multiplications in each step is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1, for twenty-ﬁve multiplications altogether.

You can check your answer by using the mod sums method.
CASTING OUT ELEVENS
To double-check your answer another way, you can use the
method known as casting out elevens. It’s similar to casting out
nines, except you reduce the numbers by alternately subtracting
and adding the digits from right to left, ignoring any decimal
point. If the result is negative, then add eleven to it. (It may be
tempting to do the addition and subtraction from left to right,
as you do with mod sums, but in this case you must do it from
right to left for it to work.)

Shakuntala Devi: That’s Incalculable!
I
n 1976 the New York Times reported that an Indian woman named
Shakuntala Devi (b. 1939) added 25,842  111,201,721 
370,247,830  55,511,315, and then multiplied that sum by 9,878, for
a correct total of 5,559,369,456,432, all in less than twenty seconds.
Hard to believe, though this uneducated daughter of impoverished
parents has made a name for herself in the United States and Europe
as a lightning calculator.
Unfortunately, most of Devi’s truly amazing feats not done by
obvious “tricks of the trade” are poorly documented. Her greatest
claimed accomplishment—the timed multiplication of two thirteen-
digit numbers on paper—has appeared in the Guinness Book of World
Records as an example of a “Human Computer.” The time of the
calculation, however, is questionable at best. Devi, a master of 
the criss-cross method, reportedly multiplied 7,686,369,774,870 
2,465,099,745,799, numbers randomly generated at the computer
department of Imperial College, London, on June 18, 1980. Her cor-
rect answer of 18,947,668,177,995,426,773,730 was allegedly gener-
ated in an incredible twenty seconds. Guinness offers this disclaimer:
“Some eminent mathematical writers have questioned the condi-
tions under which this was apparently achieved and predict that it
would be impossible for her to replicate such a feat under highly rig-
orous surveillance.” Since she had to calculate 169 multiplication
problems and 167 addition problems, for a total of 336 operations,
she would have had to do each calculation in under a tenth of a sec-
ond, with no mistakes, taking the time to write down all 26 digits of
the answer. Reaction time alone makes this record truly in the cate-
gory of “that’s incalculable!”
Despite this, Devi has proven her abilities doing rapid calculation
and has even written her own book on the subject.

It even works with multiplication:

If the numbers disagree, you made a mistake somewhere. But
if they match, it’s still possible for a mistake to exist. On aver-
age, this method will detect an error 10 times out of 11. Thus a
mistake has a 1 in 11 chance of sneaking past the elevens check,
a 1 in 9 chance of sneaking past the nines check, and only a 1 in
99 chance of being undetected if both checks are used. For more
information about this and other fascinating mathemagical top-
ics, I would encourage you to read any of Martin Gardner’s
recreational math books.
You are now ready for the ultimate pencil-and-paper multi-
plication problem in the book, a 10-by-10! This has no practical
value whatsoever except for showing off! (And personally I
think multiplying ﬁve-digit numbers is impressive enough since
the answer will be at the capacity of most calculators.) We pre-
sent it here just to prove that it can be done. The criss-crosses
follow the same basic pattern as that in the 5-by-5 problem.
There will be nineteen computation steps and at the tenth step
there will be ten criss-crosses! Here you go:

Chapter 7
A Memorable Chapter:
Memorizing Numbers
One of the most common questions I am asked pertains to my
memory. No, I don’t have an extraordinary memory. Rather, I
apply a memory system that can be learned by anyone and is
described in the following pages. In fact, experiments have
shown that almost anyone of average intelligence can be taught
to vastly improve their ability to memorize numbers.
In this chapter we’ll teach you a way to improve your mem-
ory for numbers. Not only does this have obvious practical ben-
eﬁts, such as remembering dates or recalling phone numbers,
but it also allows the mathemagician to solve much larger prob-
lems mentally. In the next chapter we’ll show you how to apply
the techniques of this chapter to multiply ﬁve-digit numbers in
your head!
USING MNEMONICS
The method presented here is an example of a mnemonic—that
is, a tool to improve memory encoding and retrieval. Mnemonics

work by converting incomprehensible data (such as digit
sequences) to something more meaningful. For example, take
just a moment to memorize the sentence below:
“My turtle Pancho will, my love, pick up my new mover,
Ginger.”
Read it over several times. Look away from the page and say
it to yourself over and over until you don’t have to look back at
the page, visualizing the turtle, Pancho, picking up your new
mover, Ginger, as you do so. Got it?
Congratulations! You have just memorized the ﬁrst twenty-
four digits of the mathematical expression π (pi). Recall that π is
the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, usually
approximated in school as 3.14, or 2
7
2. In fact, π is an irrational
number (one whose digits continue indeﬁnitely with no repeti-
tion or pattern), and computers have been used to calculate π to
billions of places.
THE PHONETIC CODE
I’m sure you’re wondering how “My turtle Pancho will, my
love, pick up my new mover, Ginger” translates into 24 places
of π.
To do this, you ﬁrst need to memorize the phonetic code
below, where each number between 0 and 9 is assigned a conso-
nant sound.
1 is the t or d sound.
2 is the n sound.
3 is the m sound.
4 is the r sound.
5 is the l sound.
Secrets of Mental Math
152

6 is the j, ch, or sh sound.
7 is the k or hard g sound.
8 is the f or v sound.
9 is the p or b sound.
0 is the z or s sound.
Memorizing this code isn’t as hard as it looks. For one thing,
notice that in cases where more than one letter is associated
with a number, they have similar pronunciations. For example,
the k sound (as it appears in words like kite or cat) is similar to
the hard g sound (as it appears in such words as goat). You can
also rely on the following tricks to help you memorize the code:
1 A typewritten t or d has just 1 downstroke.
2 A typewritten n has 2 downstrokes.
3 A typewritten m has 3 downstrokes.
4 The number 4 ends in the letter r.
5 Shape your hand with 4 ﬁngers up and the thumb at a 90-degree
angle—that’s 5 ﬁngers in an L shape.
6 A J looks sort of like a backward 6.
7 A K can be drawn by laying two 7s back to back.
8 A lowercase f written in cursive looks like an 8.
9 The number 9 looks like a backward p or an upside-down b.
0 The word zero begins with the letter z.
Or you can just remember the list in order, by thinking of the
name Tony Marloshkovips!
Practice remembering this list. In about ten minutes you
should have all the one-digit numbers associated with conso-
nant sounds. Next, you can convert numbers into words by
placing vowel sounds around or between the consonant sounds.
For instance, the number 32 can become any of the following
A Memorable Chapter: Memorizing Numbers
153

words: man, men, mine, mane, moon, many, money, menu,
amen, omen, amino, mini, minnie, and so on. Notice that the
word minnie is acceptable since the n sound is only used once.
The following words could not represent the number 32
because they use other consonant sounds: mourn, melon, mint.
These words would be represented by the numbers 342, 352,
and 321, respectively. The consonant sounds of h, w, and y can
be added freely since they don’t appear on the list. Hence, 32
can also become human, woman, yeoman, or my honey.
The following list gives you a good idea of the types of words
you can create using this phonetic code. Don’t feel obligated to
memorize it—use it as inspiration to explore the possibilities on
your own.

Although a number can usually be converted into many
words, a word can be translated only into a single number. This
is an important property for our applications as it enables us to
recall speciﬁc numbers.
Using this system you can translate any number or series of
numbers (e.g., phone numbers, Social Security numbers, driver’s
license numbers, the digits of π) into a word or a sentence. Here’s
how the code works to translate the ﬁrst twenty-four digits of π:

5
3
58
97
9
3
2
384
6264
“My turtle Pancho will, my love, pick up my new mover, Ginger.”
Remember that, with this phonetic code, g is a hard sound, as
in grass, so a soft g (as in Ginger) sounds like j and is repre-
sented by a 6. Also, the word will is, phonetically, just L, and is
represented by 5, since the consonant sound w can be used
freely. Since this sentence can only be translated back to the
twenty-four digits above, you have effectively memorized π to
twenty-four digits!
There’s no limit to the number of numbers this code will
allow you to memorize. For example, the following two sen-
tences, when added to “My turtle Pancho will, my love, pick up
my new mover, Ginger,” will allow you to memorize the ﬁrst
sixty digits of π:

“Have a baby ﬁsh knife so Marvin will marinate the goosechick.”
You can really feel proud of yourself once these sentences roll
trippingly off your tongue, and you’re able to translate them
quickly back into numbers. But you’ve got a ways to go for the
world record. Hiroyuki Goto of Japan recited π to 42,195
places, from memory, in seventeen hours and twenty-one min-
utes in 1995.
HOW MNEMONICS MAKES MENTAL
CALCULATION EASIER
Aside from improving your ability to memorize long sequences
of numbers, mnemonics can be used to store partial results in
the middle of a difﬁcult mental calculation. For example, here’s
how you can use mnemonics to help you square a three-digit
number:

A Piece of Pi for Alexander Craig Aitken
P
erhaps one of the most impressive feats of mental calculation was
performed by a professor of mathematics at the University of
Edinburgh, Alexander Craig Aitken (1895–1967), who not only
learned the value of π to 1,000 places but, when asked to demon-
strate his amazing memory during a lecture, promptly rattled off the
ﬁrst 250 digits of π. He was then challenged to skip ahead and begin
at the 551st digit and continue for another 150 places.This he did suc-
cessfully without a single error.
How did he do it? Aitken explained to his audience that “the
secret, to my mind, is relaxation, the complete antithesis of concen-
tration as usually understood.” Aitken’s technique was more auditory
than usual. He arranged the numbers into chunks of ﬁfty digits and
memorized them in a sort of rhythm.With undaunted conﬁdence he
explained,“It would have been a reprehensibly useless feat had it not
been so easy.”
That Aitken could memorize π to a thousand places does not qual-
ify him as a lightning calculator. That he could easily multiply ﬁve-digit
numbers against each other does. A mathematician named Thomas
O’Beirne recalled Aitken at a desk calculator demonstration. “The
salesman,” O’Beirne wrote, “said something like ‘We’ll now multiply
23,586 by 71,283.’ Aitken said right off, ‘And get . . .’ (whatever it was).
The salesman was too intent on selling even to notice, but his man-
ager, who was watching, did.When he saw Aitken was right, he nearly
threw a ﬁt (and so did I).”
Ironically,Aitken noted that when he bought a desk calculator for
himself, his own mental skills deteriorated quickly. Anticipating what
the future might hold, he lamented,“Mental calculators may, like the
Tasmanian or the Maori,be doomed to extinction. Therefore you may
be able to feel an almost anthropological interest in surveying a curi-
ous specimen, and some of my auditors here may be able to say in the
year A.D. 2000, ‘Yes, I knew one such.’ ” Fortunately, history has proved
him wrong!

As you recall from Chapter 3, to square 342 you ﬁrst multi-
ply 300  384, for 115,200, then add 422. But by the time
you’ve computed 422  1,764, you may have forgotten the ear-
lier number, 115,200. Here’s where our memory system comes
to the rescue. To store the number 115,200, put 200 on your
hand by raising two ﬁngers, and convert 115 into a word like
title. (By the way, I do not consider storing the 200 on ﬁngers to
be cheating. After all, what are hands for if not for holding on
to digits!) Repeat the word title to yourself once or twice. That’s
easier to remember than 115,200, especially after you start cal-
culating 422. Once you’ve arrived at 1,764, you can add that to
title 2, or 115,200, for a total of 116,964.
Here’s another:

total of 74,529. This may seem a bit cumbersome at ﬁrst, but
Secrets of Mental Math
160

with practice the conversion from numbers to words and back
to numbers becomes almost second nature.
You have seen how easily two-digit numbers can be trans-
lated into simple words. Not all three-digit numbers can be
translated so easily, but if you’re at a loss for a simple word to
act as a mnemonic, an unusual word or a nonsense word will
do. For example, if no simple word for 286 or 638 comes
quickly to mind, use a combination word like no fudge or a
nonsense word like jam-off. Even these unusual words should
be easier to recall than 286 or 638 during a long calculation.
For some of the huge problems in the next chapter, these mem-
ory tricks will be indispensable.
MEMORY MAGIC
Without using mnemonics, the average human memory (includ-
ing mine) can hold only about seven or eight digits at a time. But
once you’ve mastered the ability to change numbers into words,
you can expand your memory capacity considerably. Have
someone slowly call out sixteen digits while someone else writes
them down on a blackboard or a piece of paper. Once they are
written down, you repeat them back in the exact order they
were given without looking at the board or the piece of paper!
At a recent lecture demonstration, I was given the following
series of numbers:
1, 2, 9, 7, 3, 6, 2, 7, 9, 3, 3, 2, 8, 2, 6, 1
As the numbers were called out, I used the phonetic code to
turn them into words and then tied them together with a non-
sensical story. In this case, 12 becomes tiny, 97 becomes book,
A Memorable Chapter: Memorizing Numbers
161

362 becomes machine, 793 becomes kaboom, 32 becomes moon,
and 8261 becomes ﬁnished.
As the words were being created, I linked them together to
form a silly story to help me remember them. I pictured ﬁnding
a tiny book, which I placed inside a machine. This caused the
machine to go kaboom, and tossed me to the moon, where I was
ﬁnished. This story may sound bizarre, but the more ridiculous
the story, the easier it is to remember—and besides, it’s more fun.

Chapter 8
The Tough Stuff Made Easy:
Advanced Multiplication
At this point in the book—if you’ve gone through it chapter by
chapter—you have learned to do mental addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division, as well as the art of guesstimation,
pencil-and-paper mathemagics, and the phonetic code for num-
ber memory. This chapter is for serious, die-hard mathemagi-
cians who want to stretch their minds to the limits of mental
calculation. The problems in this chapter range from four-digit
squares to the largest problem I perform publicly—the multipli-
cation of two different ﬁve-digit numbers.
In order to do these problems, it is particularly important that
you are comfortable and reasonably fast using the phonetic code.
And even though, if you glance ahead in this chapter, the prob-
lems seem overwhelming, let me restate the two fundamental
premises of this book: (1) all mental calculation skills can be
learned by almost anyone; and (2) the key is the simpliﬁcation
of all problems into easier problems that can be done quickly.
There is no problem in this chapter (or anywhere else) that you
will encounter (comparable to these) that cannot be mastered and

learned through the simpliﬁcation techniques you’ve learned in
previous chapters. Because we are assuming that you’ve mastered
the techniques needed for this chapter, we will be teaching pri-
marily by illustration, rather than walking you through the prob-
lems word for word. As an aid, however, we remind you that
many of the simpler problems embedded within these larger prob-
lems are ones you have already encountered in previous chapters.
We begin with four-digit squares. Good luck!
FOUR-DIGIT SQUARES
As a preliminary skill for mastering four-digit squares, you need
to be able to do 4-by-1 problems. We break these down into two
2-by-1 problems, as in the examples below:

(4,200  69)
Once you’ve mastered 4-by-1s you’re ready to tackle four-digit
squares. Let’s square 4,267. Using the same method we used with
two-digit and three-digit squares, we’ll square the number 4,267 by
rounding down by 267 to 4,000, and up by 267 to 4,534, multi-
plying 4,534  4,000 (a 4-by-1), and then adding the square of the
number you went up and down by, or 2672, as illustrated below:

(332)
Now, obviously there is a lot going on in this problem. I real-
ize it’s one thing to say, “Just add the square of 267” and quite
another to actually do it and remember what it was you were
supposed to add to it. First of all, once you multiply 4,534  4
to get 18,136, you can actually say the ﬁrst part of the answer
out loud: “Eighteen million . . .” You can do so because the orig-
inal number is always rounded to the nearest thousand. Thus
the largest three-digit number you will ever square in the next
step is 500. The square of 500 is 250,000, so as soon as you see
that the rest of your answer (in this case, 136,000) is less than
750,000, you know that the millions digit will not change.

Once you’ve said “eighteen million . . . ,” you need to hold on
to 136,000 before you square 267. Here’s where our mnemon-
ics from the last chapter comes to the rescue! Using the phonetic
code, you can convert 136 to damage (1  d, 3  m, 6  j).
Now you can work on the next part of the problem and just
remember damage (and that there are three zeros following—
this will always be the case). If at any time in the computations
you forget what the original problem is, you can either glance at
the original number or, if it isn’t written down, ask the audience
to repeat the problem (which gives the illusion you are starting
the problem over from scratch when, in fact, you have already
done some of the calculations)!
You now do the three-digit square just as you learned to do
before, to get 71,289. I used to have trouble remembering the
hundreds digits of my answer (2, in this case). I cured this by rais-
ing my ﬁngers (two ﬁngers here). If you forget the last two digits
(89), you can go back to the original number (4,267), square its
last two digits (672  4,489), and take the last two digits of that.
To compute the ﬁnal answer, you now add 71,289 to damage
(which translates back to 136,000) resulting in 207,289, which
you may now say out loud.
Let’s do one more four-digit square—8,4312:

Without repeating all the detailed steps as we did in the last
problem, I will point out some of the highlights of this problem.
After doing the 8  8,862  70,896, note that 896 is above 750,
so a carry is possible. In fact, since 4312 is greater than 4002 
160,000, there deﬁnitely will be a carry when you do the addi-
tion to the number 896,000. Hence we can safely say aloud,
“Seventy-one million . . .” at this point.
When you square 431, you get 185,761. Add the 185 to the
896 to get 1,081, and say the rest of the answer. But remember
that you already anticipated the carry, so you just say, “. . . 81
thousand . . . 761.” You’re done!
We illustrate one more ﬁne point with 2,7532:

Since you are rounding up to 3,000, you will be multiplying
3,000 by another number in the 2,000s. You could subtract
2,753  247  2,506, but that’s a little messy. To obtain the last
three digits, double 753 to get 1,506. The last three digits of this
number, 506, are the last three digits of the 2,000 number:
2,506! This works because the two numbers being multiplied
must add to twice the original number.
Then proceed in the usual manner of multiplying 3,000 
2,506  7,518,000, convert 518 to the words light off, and say

the ﬁrst part of the answer out loud as “Seven million . . .” You
can say this with conﬁdence since 518 is below 750, so there
will not be a carry.
Next, you add the square of 247. Don’t forget that you can

Thomas Fuller: Learned Men and Great Fools

t would be hard to top the physical handicap on learning experi-
enced by Helen Keller, though the social handicap imposed on
Thomas Fuller, born in Africa in 1710, comes close. He was not only
illiterate; he was forced to work in the ﬁelds of Virginia as a slave and
never received a single day of education.The “property” of Mrs. Eliza-
beth Cox,Thomas Fuller taught himself to count to 100, after which
he increased his numerical powers by counting such items at hand as
the grains in a bushel of wheat, the seeds in a bushel of ﬂax, and the
number of hairs in a cow’s tail (2,872).
Extrapolating from mere counting, Fuller learned to compute the
number of shingles a house would need to cover its roof, the number
of posts needed to enclose it, and other numbers relevant to materi-
als needed in construction. His prodigious skills grew, and with them
his reputation. In his old age, two Pennsylvanians challenged him to
compute, in his head, numbers that would challenge the best lightning
calculators. For example, they asked: “Suppose a farmer has six sows,
and each sow has six female pigs the ﬁrst year, and they all increase in
the same proportion, to the end of eight years, how many sows will
the farmer then have?” The problem can be written as 78  6, that is,
(7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7)  6.Within ten minutes Fuller
gave his response of 34,588,806, the correct answer.
Upon Fuller’s death in 1790, the Columbian Centinel reported that
“he could give the number of poles, yards, feet, inches, and barley-
corns in any given distance, say the diameter of the earth’s orbit; and
in every calculation he would produce the true answer, in less time
than ninety-nine men in a hundred would take with their pens.” When
Fuller was asked if he regretted having never gained a traditional edu-
cation he responded:“No,Massa—it is best I got no learning:for many
learned men be great fools.”

the ﬁnal answer as you did in the previous four-digit problems.

3-BY-2 MULTIPLICATION
We saw in the 2-by-2 multiplication problems that there are
several different ways to tackle the same problem. The variety
of methods increases when you increase the number of digits
in the problem. In 3-by-2 multiplication I ﬁnd that it pays to
take a few moments to look at the problem to determine the
method of calculation that will put the least amount of strain
on the brain.
Factoring Methods
The easiest 3-by-2 problems to compute are those in which the
two-digit number is factorable.
For example:
(8  7)
637  56  637  8  7  5,096  7  35,672
These are great because you don’t have to add anything. You
just factor 56 into 8  7, then do a 3-by-1 (637  8  5,096),
and ﬁnally a 4-by-1 (5,096  7  35,672). There are no addi-
tion steps and you don’t have to store any partial results.
More than half of all two-digit numbers are factorable into
637
 56

The Tough Stuff Made Easy:Advanced Multiplication
169

numbers 11 and below, so you’ll be able to use this method for
many problems. Here’s an example:
(11  4)
853  11  4  9,383  4  37,532
To multiply 853  11, you treat 853 as 850  3 and proceed
as follows:
Now multiply 9,383  4 by treating 9,383 as 9,300  83, as
follows:
If the two-digit number is not factorable into small numbers,
examine the three-digit number to see if it can be factored:
(6  6  4)
76  144  76  6  6  4  456  6  4 
 2,736  4  10,944
Notice that the sequence of the multiplication problems is a
2-by-1, a 3-by-1, and ﬁnally a 4-by-1. Since these are all prob-

lems you can now do with considerable ease, this type of 3-by-2
problem should be no problem at all.
Here’s another example where the two-digit number is not
factorable but the three-digit number is:
(11  7  6)
53  11  7  6  583  7  6  4,081  6  24,486
Here the sequence is a 2-by-2, a 3-by-1, and a 4-by-1, though
when the three-digit number is factorable by 11, you can use the
elevens method for a very simple 2-by-2 (53  11  583). In this
case it pays to be able to recognize when a number is divisible
by 11, as described in Chapter 4.
If the two-digit number is not factorable, and the three-digit
number is factorable into only a 2-by-1, the problem can still be
handled easily by a 2-by-2, followed by a 4-by-1:
(47  9)
83  47  9  3,901  9  35,109
Here you need to see that 423 is divisible by 9, setting up the
problem as 83  47  9. This 2-by-2 is not so easy, but by treat-
ing 83 as 80  3, you get:

Then do the 4-by-1 problem of 3,901  9 for your ﬁnal answer
of 35,109.
The Addition Method
If the two-digit number and the three-digit number cannot be
conveniently factored in the 3-by-2 problem you’re doing, you
can always resort to the addition method:
(720  1)
(treating 72 as 9  8)
The method requires you to add a 2-by-2 (times 10) to a 
2-by-1. These problems tend to be more difﬁcult than prob-
lems that can be factored since you have to perform a 2-by-1
while holding on to a ﬁve-digit number, and then add the results
together. In fact, it is probably easier to solve this problem by
factoring 721 into 103  7, then computing 37  103  7 
3,811  7  26,677.
Here’s another example:
(730  2)
(treating 73 as 70  3)
Though you will usually break up the three-digit number when
using the addition method, it occasionally pays to break up the

two-digit number instead, particularly when the last digit of the
two-digit number is a 1 or a 2, as in the following example:
(50  1)
This reduces the 3-by-2 to a 3-by-1, made especially easy since
the second multiplication problem involves a 1. Note, too, that
we were aided in multiplying a 5 by an even number, which pro-
duces an extra 0 in the answer, so there is only one digit of over-
lap in the addition problem.
Another example of multiplying a 5 by an even number is
illustrated in the following problem:
(60  2)
When you multiply the 6 in 60 by the 5 in 835, it generates
an extra 0 in the answer, making the addition problem espe-
cially easy.
The Subtraction Method
As with 2-by-2s, it is sometimes more convenient to solve a 
3-by-2 with subtraction instead of addition, as in the following
problems:

By contrast, you can compare the last subtraction method with
the addition method, below, for this same problem:
(750  8)
(75  5  5  3)
My preference for tackling this problem would be to use the
subtraction method because I always try to leave myself with
the easiest possible addition or subtraction problem at the end.
In this case, I’d rather subtract 86 than add 344, even though
the 2-by-2 multiplication problem in the subtraction method
above is slightly harder than the one in the addition method.
The subtraction method can also be used for three-digit num-
bers below a multiple of 100 or close to 1,000, as in the next
two examples:

Finally, in the following illustration we break up the two-digit

FIVE-DIGIT SQUARES
Mastering 3-by-2 multiplication takes a fair amount of practice,
but once you’ve managed that, you can slide right into doing ﬁve-
digit squares because they simplify into a 3-by-2 problem plus a
two-digit square and a three-digit square. Watch:
To square the following number:
46,7922
Treat it as:
Using the distributive law we can break this down to:
1.
2.
3.
46,000  46,000  2(46,000)(792)  792  792
This can be stated more simply as:
462  1 million  (46)(792)(2000)  7922
But I do not do them in this order. In fact, I start in the mid-
dle, because the 3-by-2 problems are harder than the two-digit
and three-digit squares. So in keeping with the principle of get-
ting the hard stuff out of the way ﬁrst, I do 792  46  2 and
attach three zeroes on the end, as follows:
(800  8)
“Fisher”

The Tough Stuff Made Easy:Advanced Multiplication

Using the subtraction method, as shown above, compute
792  46  36,432, then double that number to get 72,864.
Using the phonetic code from the last chapter on the number
864 allows you to store this number as 72 Fisher.
The next step is to do 462  1 million, which is 2,116,000,000.
At this point, you can say, “Two billion . . .”
Recalling the 72 of 72 Fisher, you add 116 million to get 188
million. Before saying this number aloud, you need to check
ahead to see if there is a carry when adding Fisher, or 864, to
7922. Here you don’t actually calculate 7922; rather, you deter-
mine that its product will be large enough to make the 864,000
carry. (You can guesstimate this by noting that 8002 is 640,000,
which will easily make the 864,000 carry, thus you bump the
188 up a notch and say, “. . . 189 million. . . .”)
Still holding on to Fisher, compute the square of 792, using
the three-digit square method (rounding up and down by 8, and
so on) to get 627,264. Finally, add 627 to Fisher, or 864, to get
1,491. But since you already made the carry, drop the 1 and say,
“. . . 491 thousand 264.”
Sometimes I forget the last three digits of the answer because
my mind has been so preoccupied with the larger computa-
tions. So before doing the ﬁnal addition I will store the 2 of
264 on my ﬁngers and try to remember the 64, which I can
usually do because we tend to recall the most recent things
heard. If this fails, I can come up with the ﬁnal two digits by
squaring the ﬁnal two digits of the original number, 922, or
8,464, the last two digits of which are the last two digits I’m
looking for: 64. (Alternatively, you can convert 264 into a word
like nature.)
I know this is quite a mouthful. To reiterate the entire prob-
lem in a single illustration, here is how I computed 46,7922:

Let’s look at another ﬁve-digit square example:
83,5222
As before, we compute the answer in this order:
83  522  2,000, 832  1 million, then 5222
For the ﬁrst problem, notice that 522 is a multiple of 9. In
fact, 522  58  9. Treating 83 as 80  3, we get:
(58  9)
83  58  9  4,814  9  43,326
Doubling 43,326 results in 86,652, which can be stored as
86 Julian. Since 832  6,889, we can say, “Six billion . . .”

Adding 889  86 gives us 975. Before saying 975 million we
check to see if Julian (652,000) will cause a carry after squar-
ing 522. Guesstimating 5222 as about 270,000 (500  540),
you see it will not carry. Thus you can safely say, “. . . 975
million . . .”
Finally, square 522 in the usual way to get 272,484 and add
that to Julian (652,000) for the rest of the answer: “. . . 924,484.”

3-BY-3 MULTIPLICATION
In building to the grand ﬁnale of 5-by-5 multiplication, 3-by-3s
are the ﬁnal hurdle. As with 3-by-2s, there are a variety of meth-
ods you can use to exploit the numbers in the simpliﬁcation
process.
Factoring Method
We’ll begin with the factoring method. Unfortunately, most
three-digit numbers are not factorable into one-digit numbers,
but when they are, the calculation is not too bad.
(9  8  4)
829  9  8  4  7,461  8  4  59,688  4  238,752
Notice the sequence involved. You simplify the 3-by-3 (829 
288) to a 3-by-1-by-1-by-1 through the factoring of 288 into 9 
8  4. This then turns into a 4-by-1-by-1 (7,461  8  4), and
ﬁnally into a 5-by-1 to yield the ﬁnal answer of 238,752. The
beauty of this process is that there is nothing to add and nothing
to store in memory. When you get to the 5-by-1, you are one
step away from completion.
The 5-by-1 problem can be solved in two steps by treating
59,688 as 59,000  688, then adding the results of the 2-by-1
(59,000  4) and the 3-by-1 (688  4), as below:

If both three-digit numbers are factorable into 2-by-1s, then
the 3-by-3 can be simpliﬁed to a 2-by-2-by-1-by-1, as in the fol-
lowing problem:
(57  9) 
(41  6)
57  41  9  6  2,337  9  6
 21,033  6
 126,198
As usual, it is best to get the hard part of the problem over ﬁrst
(the 2-by-2). Once you’ve got this, the problem is then reduced
to a 4-by-1, then to a 5-by-1.
More often than not, only one of the three-digit numbers will
be factorable, in which case it is reduced to a 3-by-2-by-1, as in
the following problem:
(51  9)
526  459  526  51  9
 526  (50  1)  9
 26,826  9
 241,434
The next 3-by-3 is really just a 3-by-2 in disguise:
By doubling the 435 and cutting 624 in half, we obtain the
equivalent problem:

Close-Together Method
Are you ready for something easier? The next multiplication
shortcut, which we introduced in Chapter 0, is based on the fol-
lowing algebraic formula:
(z  a)(z  b)  z2  za  zb  ab
Which we rewrite as:
(z  a)(z  b)  z(z  a  b)  ab
This formula is valid for any values of z, a, and b. We shall
take advantage of this whenever the three-digit numbers to be
multiplied (z  a) and (z  b) are both near an easy number z
(typically one with lots of zeroes in it). For example, to multiply:
We treat this problem as (100  7)(100  11).
Using z  100, a  7, b  11, our formula gives us:
100(100  7  11)  7  11  100  118  77

I diagram the problem this way:
(7)
(11)
The numbers in parentheses denote the difference between the
number and our convenient “base number” (here, z  100).
The number 118 can be obtained either by adding 107  11 or
111  7. Algebraically these sums are always equal since (z  a) 
b  (z  b)  a.
With fewer words this time, here’s another quickie:

Neat!
Let’s up the ante a little with a higher base number:

Here, the base number is 70, which we multiply by 81 (78  3).
Even the addition component is usually very simple.
We can also apply this method when the two numbers are
both lower than the base number, as in the following problem
where both numbers are just under 400:
(4)
(13)
The number 383 can be obtained from 396  13, or from
387  4. I would use this method for 2-by-2 problems like the

In our next example, the base number falls between the two
numbers:
(4)

The number 409 is obtained from 396  13, or 413  4.
Notice that since 4 and 13 are of opposite signs we must sub-
tract 52 here.
Let’s raise the ante higher still, to where the second step
requires a 2-by-2 multiplication:
(21)
(37)
(37  7  3)
We note here that step 1 in the multiplication problem (600 
658) is itself a reasonable estimate. Our method enables you to
go from an estimate to the exact answer.
(24)
(47)
(47  6  4)
Also notice that in all these examples, the numbers we multi-
ply in the ﬁrst step have the same sum as the original numbers.

For example, in the problem above, 900  829  1729 just as
876  853  1729. This is because:
z  [(z  a)  b]  (z  a)  (z  b)
Thus, to obtain the number to be multiplied by 900 (which
you know will be 800 plus something), you need only look at
the last two digits of 76  53  129 to determine 829.
In the next problem, adding 827  761  1588 tells us that
we should simply multiply 800  788, then subtract 27  39 as
follows:
(27)
(39)
(39  9  3)
This method is so effective that if the 3-by-3 problem you are
presented with has numbers that are not close together, you can
sometimes modify the problem by dividing one and multiplying
the other, both by the same number, to bring them closer to-
gether. For instance, 672  157 can be solved by:
(36)
(14)
(36  7  2)
When the numbers being multiplied are the same (you can’t
get any closer than that!), notice that the close-together method

produces the exact same calculations you did in our traditional
squaring procedure:

(47)
Addition Method
When none of the previous methods work, I look for an
addition-method possibility, particularly when the ﬁrst two dig-
its of one of the three-digit numbers is easy to work with. For
example, in the problem below, the 64 of 641 is factorable into
8  8, so I would solve the problem as illustrated:
(640  1)
(373  8  8  10)
In a similar way, in the next problem the 42 of 427 is fac-
torable into 7  6, so you can use the addition method and treat
427 as 420  7:
(420  7)

Often I break the last addition problem into two steps, as
follows:
Since addition-method problems can be very strenuous, I usu-
ally go out of my way to ﬁnd a method that will produce a sim-
ple computation at the end. For example, the above problem
could have been done using the factoring method. In fact, that is
how I would choose to do it:
(61  7)
656  61  7  656  (60  1)  7
 40,016  7
 280,112
The simplest addition-method problems are those in which
one number has a 0 in the middle, as below:
(300  8)
These problems tend to be so much easier than other addition-
method problems that it pays to see whether the 3-by-3 can

lems below:

We mention that another way to do this problem is by 308 
366  2, and take advantage of the closeness of 308 and 366.

When-All-Else-Fails Method
When all else fails, I use the following method, which is fool-
proof when you can ﬁnd no other method to exploit the num-
bers. In the when-all-else-fails method, the 3-by-3 problem is
broken down into three parts: a 3-by-1, a 2-by-1, and a 2-by-2.
As you do each computation, you sum the totals as you go.
These problems are difﬁcult, especially if you cannot see the
original number. In my presentation of 3-by-3s and 5-by-5s, I
have the problems written down, but I do all the calculations
mentally.
Here’s an example:
In practice, the calculation actually proceeds as shown below.
Sometimes I use the phonetic code to store the thousands digits

5-BY-5 MULTIPLICATION
The largest problem we will attempt is the mental multiplication
of two ﬁve-digit numbers. To do a 5-by-5, you need to have
mastered 2-by-2s, 2-by-3s, and 3-by-3s, as well as the phonetic
code. Now it is just a matter of putting it all together. As you did
in the ﬁve-digit square problems, you will use the distributive
law to break down the numbers. For example:
Based on this you can break down the problem into four eas-
ier multiplication problems, which I illustrate below in criss-
cross fashion as a 2-by-2, two 3-by-2s, and ﬁnally a 3-by-3,
summing the results for a grand total. That is,

As with the ﬁve-digit squares, I begin in the middle with the
3-by-2s, starting with the harder 3-by-2:
“Mom, no knife”
1.
52  639  52  71  9  3,692  9  33,228
Committing 33,228 to memory with the mnemonic Mom, no
knife, you then turn to the second 3-by-2:
2.
27  196  27  (200  4)  5,400  108  5,292
and add it to the number that you are storing:
3.
(“Mom, no knife”)
for a new total, which we store as:
“Movie lines” (38 million, 520 thousand)
Holding on to movie lines, compute the 2-by-2:
4.
52  27  52  9  3  1,404
At this point, you can give part of the answer. Since this 2-by-2
represents 52  27 million, 1,404 represents 1 billion, 404 mil-
lion. Since 404 million will not cause a carry, you can safely say,
“One billion . . .”

Secrets of Mental Math
194

In this step you add 404 to movie (38) to get 442, at which
point you can say, “. . . 442 million. . . .” You can say this
because you know 442 will not carry—you’ve peeked ahead at
the 3-by-3 to see whether it will cause 442 to carry to a higher
number. If you found that it would carry, you would say, “443
million.” But since lines is 520,000 and the 3-by-3 (639  196)
will not exceed 500,000 (a rough guesstimate of 600  200 
120,000 shows this), you are safe.
6.
639  196  639  7  7  4  4,473  7  4 
 31,311  4  125,244
While still holding on to lines, you now compute the 3-by-3
using the factoring method, to get 125,244. You might convert
244 into a word like nearer. The ﬁnal step is a simple addition of:
7.
125,244  “Lines” (520,000)
This allows you to say the rest of the answer: “. . . 645,244.”
Since a picture is worth a thousand calculations, here’s our
picture of how this would look:

I should make a parenthetical note here that I am assuming in
doing 5-by-5s that you can write down the problem on a black-
board or piece of paper. If you can’t, you will have to create a
mnemonic for each of the four numbers. For example, in the last
problem, you could store the problem as:
—“Neck jump”
—“Lion dopish”
Then you would multiply lion  jump, dopish  neck, lion 
neck, and ﬁnally dopish  jump. Obviously this would slow you
down a bit, but if you want the extra challenge of not being able
to see the numbers, you can still solve the problem.
We conclude with one more 5-by-5 multiplication:
The steps are the same as those in the last problem. You start

Chapter 9
Presto-digit-ation: The Art of
Mathematical Magic
Playing with numbers has brought me great joy in life. I ﬁnd
that arithmetic can be just as entertaining as magic. But under-
standing the magical secrets of arithmetic requires algebra. Of
course, there are other reasons to learn algebra (SATs, modeling
real-world problems, computer programming, and understand-
ing higher mathematics, to name just a few), but what ﬁrst got
me interested in algebra was the desire to understand some
mathematical magic tricks, which I now present to you!
PSYCHIC MATH
Say to a volunteer in the audience, “Think of a number, any
number.” And you should also say, “But to make it easy on
yourself, think of a one-digit or two-digit number.” After you’ve
reminded your volunteer that there’s no way you could know
her number, ask her to:
1. double the number,
2. add 12,

3. divide the total by 2,
4. subtract the original number.
Then say, “Are you now thinking of the number six?” Try
this one on yourself ﬁrst and you will see that the sequence
always produces the number 6 no matter what number is origi-
nally selected.
Why This Trick Works
This trick is based on simple algebra. In fact, I sometimes use
this as a way to introduce algebra to students. The secret num-
ber that your volunteer chose can be represented by the letter x.
Here are the functions you performed in the order you per-
formed them:
1. 2x (double the number)
2. 2x  12 (then add 12)
3. (2x  12)  2  x  6 (then divide by 2)
4. x  6  x  6 (then subtract original number)
So no matter what number your volunteer chooses, the ﬁnal
answer will always be 6. If you repeat this trick, have the volun-
teer add a different number at step 2 (say 18). The ﬁnal answer
will be half that number (namely 9).
THE MAGIC 1089!
Here is a trick that has been around for centuries. Have your
audience member take out paper and pencil and:
1. secretly write down a three-digit number where the digits are
decreasing (like 851 or 973),
Secrets of Mental Math
200

2. reverse that number and subtract it from the ﬁrst number,
3. take that answer and add it to the reverse of itself.
At the end of this sequence, the answer 1089 will magically
appear, no matter what number your volunteer originally chose.
For example:
Why This Trick Works
No matter what three-digit number you or anyone else chooses
in this game, the ﬁnal result will always be 1089. Why? Let abc
denote the unknown three-digit number. Algebraically, this is
equal to:
100a  10b  c
When you reverse the number and subtract it from the origi-
nal number, you get the number cba, algebraically equal to:
100c  10b  a
Upon subtracting cba from abc, you get:
100a  10b  c  (100c  10b  a)
 100(a  c)  (c  a)
 99(a  c)
851
 158


 396

1089
Presto-digit-ation: The Art of Mathematical Magic
201

Hence, after subtracting in step 2, we must have one of the
following multiples of 99: 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792,
or 891, each one of which will produce 1089 after adding it to
the reverse of itself, as we did in step 3.
MISSING-DIGIT TRICKS
Using the number 1,089 from the last effect, hand a volunteer a
calculator and ask her to multiply 1089 by any three-digit num-
ber she likes, but not to tell you the three-digit number. (Say she
secretly multiplies 1,089  256  278,784.) Ask her how many
digits are in her answer. She’ll reply, “Six.”
Next you say: “Call out ﬁve of your six digits to me in any
order you like. I shall try to determine the missing digit.”
Suppose she calls out, “Two . . . four . . . seven . . . eight . . .
eight.” You correctly tell her that she left out the number 7.
The secret is based on the fact that a number is a multiple 
of 9 if and only if its digits sum to a multiple of 9. Since 1  0 
8  9  18 is a multiple of 9, then so is 1089. Thus 1089 times
any whole number will also be a multiple of 9. Since the digits
called out add up to 29, and the next multiple of 9 greater than
29 is 36, our volunteer must have left out the number 7 (since
29  7  36).
There are more subtle ways to force the volunteer to end up
with a multiple of 9. Here are some of my favorites:
1. Have the volunteer randomly choose a six-digit number, scramble
its digits, then subtract the smaller six-digit number from the larger
one. Since we’re subtracting two numbers with the same mod sum
(indeed, the identical sum of digits), the resulting difference will
have a mod sum of 0, and hence be a multiple of 9. Then continue
as before to ﬁnd the missing digit.
Secrets of Mental Math
202

2. Have the volunteer secretly choose a four-digit number, reverse the
digits, then subtract the smaller number from the larger. (This will
be a multiple of 9.) Then multiply this by any three-digit number,
and continue as before.
3. Ask the volunteer to multiply one-digit numbers randomly until
the product is seven digits long. This is not “guaranteed” to
produce a multiple of 9, but in practice it will do so at least 90%
of the time (the chances are high that the one-digit numbers being
multiplied include a 9 or two 3s or two 6s, or a 3 and a 6). I often
use this method in front of mathematically advanced audiences
who might see through other methods.
There is one problem to watch out for. Suppose the numbers
called out add up to a multiple of 9 (say 18). Then you have no
way of determining whether the missing digit is 0 or 9. How do
you remedy that? Simple—you cheat! You merely say, “You
didn’t leave out a zero, did you?” If she did leave out a 0, you
have completed the trick successfully. If she did not leave out the
0, you say: “Oh, it seemed as though you were thinking of noth-
ing! You didn’t leave out a one, two, three, or four, did you?”
She’ll either shake her head, or say no. Then you follow with,
“Nor did you leave out a ﬁve, six, seven, or eight, either. You
left out the number nine, didn’t you?” She’ll respond in the afﬁr-
mative, and you will receive your well-deserved applause!
LEAPFROG ADDITION
This trick combines a quick mental calculation with an aston-
ishing prediction. Handing the spectator a card with ten lines,
numbered 1 through 10, have the spectator think of two posi-
tive numbers between 1 and 20, and enter them on lines 1 and 2
of the card. Next have the spectator write the sum of lines 1 and
Presto-digit-ation: The Art of Mathematical Magic
203

2 on line 3, then the sum of lines 2 and 3 on line 4, and so on as
illustrated below.

Finally, have the spectator show you the card. At a glance,
you can tell him the sum of all the numbers on the card. For
instance, in our example, you could instantly announce that the
numbers sum up to 671 faster than the spectator could do using
a calculator! As a kicker, hand the spectator a calculator, and
ask him to divide the number on line 10 by the number on line
9. In our example, the quotient 

tator announce the ﬁrst three digits of the quotient, then turn
the card over (where you have already written a prediction).
He’ll be surprised to see that you’ve already written the number
1.61!
Why This Trick Works
To perform the quick calculation, you simply multiply the num-
ber on line 7 by 11. Here 61  11  671. The reason this works
is illustrated in the table below. If we denote the numbers on
lines 1 and 2 by x and y, respectively, then the sum of lines 1

through 10 must be 55x  88y, which equals 11 times (5x 
8y), that is, eleven times the number on line 7.

Total:

As for the prediction, we exploit the fact that for any positive
numbers, a, b, c, d, if a/b < c/d, then it can be shown that the
fraction you get by “adding fractions badly” (i.e., adding the
numerators and adding the denominators) must lie in between
the original two fractions. That is,
<

Thus the quotient of line 10 divided by line 9 (21x  34y)/
(13x  21y), must lie between
1.615 . . . 

 1.619 . . .
Hence, the ratio must begin with the digits 1.61, as predicted.
In fact, if you continue the leapfrog process indeﬁnitely, the
ratio of consecutive terms gets closer and closer to

MAGIC SQUARES
Are you ready for a challenge of a different sort? Below you will
ﬁnd what is called a magic square. There has been much written
on magic squares and how to construct them, going back as far
as ancient China. Here we describe a way to present magic
squares in an entertaining fashion. This is a routine I’ve been
doing for years.
I bring out a business card with the following written on the
back:

13

7
12

 34
I say, “This is called a magic square. In fact, it’s the smallest
magic square you can create, using the numbers one through
sixteen. You’ll notice that every row and every column adds to
the same number—thirty-four. Now I’ve done such an extensive
study on magic squares that I propose to create one for you
right before your very eyes.”
I then ask someone from the audience to give me any number
larger than 34. Let’s suppose she says 67.
I then bring out another business card and draw a blank 
4-by-4 grid, and place the number 67 to the right of it. Next I
1  5

2
Secrets of Mental Math

ask her to point to the squares, one at a time, in any order. As
she points to an empty box, I immediately write a number inside
it. The end result looks like this:
16

 67
I continue: “Now with the ﬁrst magic square, every row and
column added to thirty-four. [I usually put the thirty-four card
away at this point.] Let’s see how we did with your square.”
After checking that each row and column adds up to 67, I say:
“But I did not stop there. For you, I decided to go one step fur-
ther. Notice that both diagonals add up to sixty-seven!” Then I
point out that the four squares in the upper left corner sum to
67 (16  19  22  10  67), as do the other three four-square
corners, the four squares in the middle, and the four corner
squares! “They all sum to sixty-seven. But don’t take my word
for any of this. Please keep this magic square as a souvenir from
me—and check it out for yourself!”
HOW TO CONSTRUCT A MAGIC SQUARE
You can create a magic square that sums to any number by tak-
ing advantage of the original magic square that sums to 34.
Keep that square within eyeshot while you construct the volun-
teer’s magic square. As you draw the 4-by-4 grid, mentally per-
form the calculations of steps 1 and 2:
1. Subtract 34 from the given number (e.g., 67  34  33).
2. Divide this number by 4 (e.g., 33  4  8 with a remainder of 1).
Presto-digit-ation: The Art of Mathematical Magic
207

The quotient is the ﬁrst “magic” number. The quotient plus the
remainder is the second “magic” number. (Here our magic
numbers are 8 and 9.)
3. When the volunteer points out a square, inconspicuously look at
the 34-square and see what is in the corresponding square. If it is a
13, 14, 15, or 16, add the second number to it (e.g., 9). If not, add
the ﬁrst magic number (e.g., 8).
4. Insert the appropriate number until the magic square is completed.
Note that when the given number is even, but not a multiple
of 4, then your ﬁrst and second magic numbers will be the same,
so you’ll have just one magic number to add to the numbers in
your 34-square.
Why This Trick Works
The reason this method works is based on the fact that every
row, column, diagonal (and more) from the originally displayed
magic square sums to 34. Suppose the given number had been
82. Since 82  34  48 (and 48  4  12), we would add 12 to
each square. Then every group of four that had previously
summed to 34 would add to 34  48  82. See the magic square
below.

 82
On the other hand, if the given number were 85, our magic
numbers would be 12 and 15, so we would be adding 3 more to
the squares showing 13, 14, 15, and 16. Since each row, col-

umn, and group of four contains exactly one of these numbers,
each group of four would now add to 34  48  3  85 in the
following magic square.

Not only do the rows, columns, and diagonals add up to 15,

8162  2942  7532  6182. Also, 4382  9512  2762  8342 

pens, you might want to explore my paper Magic “Squares”
Indeed! (included in the bibliography).
QUICK CUBE ROOTS
Ask someone to select a two-digit number and keep it secret.
Then have him cube the number; that is, multiply it by itself
twice (using a calculator). For instance, if the secret number is
68, have the volunteer compute 68  68  68  314,432. Then
Presto-digit-ation: The Art of Mathematical Magic
209

ask the volunteer to tell you his answer. Once he tells you the
cube, 314,432, you can instantly reveal the original secret num-
ber, the cube root, 68. How?
To calculate cube roots, you need to learn the cubes from 1
to 10:

1000
Once you have learned these, calculating the cube roots is as
easy as π. For instance, with this example problem:
What is the cube root of 314,432?
Seems like a pretty tough one to begin with, but don’t panic,
it’s actually quite simple. As usual, we’ll take it one step at a time:
1. Look at the magnitude of the thousands number (the numbers to
the left of the comma), 314 in this example.
2. Since 314 lies between 63  216 and 73  343, the cube root lies in
the 60s (since 603  216,000 and 703  343,000). Hence the ﬁrst
digit of the cube root is 6.
3. To determine the last digit of the cube root, note that only the
number 8 has a cube that ends in 2 (83  512), so the last digit
ends in 8.
Secrets of Mental Math
210

Therefore, the cube root of 314,432 is 68. Three simple steps
and you’re there. Notice that every digit, 0 through 9, appears
once among the last digits of the cubes. (In fact, the last digit of
the cube root is equal to the last digit of the cube of the last digit
of the cube. Go ﬁgure out that one!)
Now you try one for practice:
What is the cube root of 19,683?
1. 19 lies between 8 and 27 (23 and 33).
2. Therefore the cube root is 20-something.
3. The last digit of the problem is 3, which corresponds to 343  73,
so 7 is the last digit.
The answer is 27.
Notice that our derivation of the last digit will only work if
the original number is the cube root of a whole number. For
instance, the cube root of 19,684 is 27.0004572 . . . deﬁnitely
not 24. That’s why we included this in our mathemagical magic
section and not in an earlier chapter. (Besides, the calculation
goes so fast, it seems like magic!)
SIMPLIFIED SQUARE ROOTS
Square roots can also be calculated easily if you are given a per-
fect square. For instance, if someone told you that the square of
a two-digit number was 7569, you could immediately tell her
that the original number (the square root) is 87. Here’s how.
1. Look at the magnitude of the “hundreds number” (the numbers
preceding the last two digits), 75 in this example.
2. Since 75 lies between 82 (8  8  64) and 92 (9  9  81), then we
know that the square root lies in the 80s. Hence the ﬁrst digit of
Presto-digit-ation: The Art of Mathematical Magic
211

the square root is 8. Now there are two numbers whose square
ends in 9: 32  9 and 72  49. So the last digit must be 3 or 7.
Hence the square root is either 83 or 87. Which one?
3. Compare the original number with the square of 85 (which we can
easily compute as 80  90  25  7225. Since 7569 is larger than
7225, the square root is the larger number, 87.
Let’s do one more example.
What is the square root of 4761?
Since 47 lies between 62  36 and 72  49, the answer must
be in the 60s. Since the last digit of the square is 1, the last digit
of the square root must be 1 or 9. Since 4761 is greater than
652  4225, the square root must be 69. As with the previous
cube root trick, this method can be applied only when the origi-
nal number given is a perfect square.
AN “AMAZING” SUM
The following trick was ﬁrst shown to me by James “the Amaz-
ing” Randi, who has used it effectively in his magic. Here, the
magician is able to predict the total of four randomly chosen
three-digit numbers.
To prepare this trick you will need three sets of nine cards
each, and a piece of paper with the number 2247 written down
on it and then sealed in an envelope. Next, on each of the three
sets of cards do the following:
On Set A write the following numbers, one number on each
card:
4286
5771
9083
6518
2396
6860
2909
5546
8174
Secrets of Mental Math
212

On Set B write the following numbers:
5792
6881
7547
3299
7187
6557
7097
5288
6548
On Set C write the following numbers:
2708
5435
6812
7343
1286
5237
6470
8234
5129
Select three people in the audience and give each one a set of
cards. Have each of your volunteers randomly pick one of the
nine cards they hold. Let’s say they choose the numbers 4286,
5792, and 5435. Now, in the sequence, have each one call out
one digit from the four-digit number, ﬁrst person A, then per-
son B, and ﬁnally person C. Say they call out the numbers 8, 9,
and 5. Write down the numbers 8, 9, and 5 (895) and say, “You
must admit that this number was picked entirely at random and
could not possibly have been predicted in advance.”
Next, have the three people call out a different number from
their cards. Say they call out 4, 5, and 3. Write 453 below 895.
Then repeat this two more times with their remaining two num-
bers, resulting in four three-digit numbers, such as:
A
B
C
8
9
5
4
5
3
2

Next have someone add the four numbers and announce the
total. Then have someone open the envelope to reveal your pre-
diction. Take a bow!

Why This Trick Works
Look at the numbers in each set of cards and see if you can ﬁnd
anything consistent about them. Each set of numbers sums to
the same total. Set A numbers total to 20. Set B numbers total
to 23. Set C numbers total to 17. With person C’s numbers in
the right column totaling to 17, you will always put down the 7
and carry the 1. With person B’s numbers totaling to 23, plus
the 1, you will always put down the 4 and carry the 2. Finally
with person A’s numbers totaling to 20, adding the 2 gives you
a total of 2247!
A DAY FOR ANY DATE
We conclude our book with one of the classic feats of mental
calculation: how to ﬁgure out the day of the week of anyone’s
birthday. This is actually a very practical skill. It’s not every day
that someone will ask you to square a three-digit number, but
hardly a day goes by without somebody mentioning a date to
you in the past or future. With just a little bit of practice, you
can quickly and easily determine the day of the week of practi-
cally any date in history.
First we assign a code number to every day of the week. They
are easy to remember:

I have found the above list to be easy to remember, especially
since 2’s day is Tuesday. The other days can be given similar
mnemonics: “1 day is Monday, 4’s day is Thursday, and 5 day is
Friday. For Wednesday, notice that if you hold up three ﬁngers,
you get the letter w. For the weekends (at the end of our list),
you might think of Saturday as 6-urday and Sunday as 7 day
(especially if you pronounce the v softly). Or to remember the
zero, you could think of Sunday as none-day or nun-day!
Next we need a code for every month of the year. These month
codes are used for every year, with two exceptions. In a leap year
(like 2000 or 2004 or 2008 or . . .) the month code for January is
5, and the month code for February is 1. To make the month
codes easier to remember, we provide a table of mnemonics below.

December is the L-A-S-T month, or X-M-A-S.
*In a leap year, the code for January is 5 and the code for February is 1.
Now let’s calculate the day of the week for any date in 2006.
After that, we will describe 2007, then 2008, and so on, for the
Presto-digit-ation: The Art of Mathematical Magic
215

rest of your life. Once all future dates are taken care of, we can
look back into the past and determine the days of the week for
any date in the 1900s or any other century.
Every year is assigned a code number, and for 2006 that year
code happens to be 0 (see page 218).
Now, to calculate the day of the week, you simply add the
month code plus the date code plus the year code. Thus for
December 3, 2006, we compute
Month Code  Date Year Code  4  3  0  7
Hence, this date will be on Day 7, which is Sunday.
How about November 18, 2006? Since November has a
month code of 2, we have
Month Code  Date Year Code  2  18  0  20.
Now since the week repeats every seven days, we can sub-
tract any multiple of 7 from our answer (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, . . .)
and this will not change the day of the week. So our ﬁnal step is
to subtract the biggest multiple of 7 to get 20  14  6. Hence
November 18, 2006, occurs on Saturday.
How about 2007? Well, what happens to your birthday as
you go from one year to the next? For most years, there are 365
days, and since 364 is a multiple of 7 (7  52  364), then the
day of the week of your birthday will shift forward by one day
in most years. If there are 366 days between your birthdays,
then it will shift forward by two days. Hence, for 2007 we cal-
culate the day of the week just as before, but now we use a year
code of 1. Next, 2008 is a leap year. (Leap years occur every
four years, so 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, . . . , 2096 are the leap
years of the twenty-ﬁrst century.) Hence, for 2008, the year
Secrets of Mental Math
216

code increases by two, so it will have a year code of 3. The next
year, 2009, is not a leap year, so the year code increases by one,
to 4.
Thus, for example, May 2, 2007, has
Month Code  Date Year Code  0  2  1  3
so this date is a Wednesday.
For September 9, 2008, we have
Month Code  Date Year Code  4  9  3  16
Subtracting the biggest multiple of 7, we have 16  14  2,
so this date is a Tuesday.
On the other hand, January 16, 2008, is a leap year January,
so its month code will be 5 instead of 6. Thus, we have
Month Code  Date Year Code  5  16  3  24
and therefore occurs on day 24  21  3, which is Wednesday.
For your reference, we have listed all of the year codes for the
twenty-ﬁrst century in the ﬁgure on the following page.
The good news is that we do not have to memorize this table.
We can mentally calculate the year code for any date between
2000 and 2099. For the year code of 2000  x, we simply 
take the number x/4 (ignoring any remainder) and add that 
to x. The year code can be reduced by subtracting any multiple
of 7.
For example, with 2061, we see that 6
4
1  15 (with a remain-
der of 1 that we ignore). Thus 2061 has a year code of 61  15 
76. And since we can subtract any multiple of 7, we use the sim-
pler year code of 76  70  6.

Hence March 19, 2061, has

Subtracting 27  21  6 tells us that this date will take place
on Saturday.
What about birth dates between 1900 and 1999? Do the
problem exactly as in the previous calculation, but shift the ﬁnal
answer forward by one day (or simply add 1 to the year code).
Thus March 19, 1961, occurred on a Sunday.
For the date December 3, 1998, we have 9
4
8  24 (with a
remainder of 2 that we ignore). Thus 1998 has year code 98 
24  1  123, where the plus one is added for dates in the
1900s. Next, subtract the biggest multiple of 7. For handy refer-
ence, here are the multiples of 7 that you might need:
7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105,
112, 119, 126, . . .
Since 123  119  4, 1998 has a year code of 4. Therefore,
December 3, 1998, has
Month Code  Date Year Code  4  3  4  11
and 11  7  4, so this date occurred on a Thursday.
For dates in the 1800s, we add 3 to the year code. For exam-
ple, Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln were both born on
February 12, 1809. Since 2009 has a year code of 4, then 1809
has a year code of 4  3  7, which can be reduced to 0. Thus,
February 12, 1809, has
Month Code  Date Year Code  2  12  0  14
and 14  14  0, so they were both born on a Sunday.
Presto-digit-ation: The Art of Mathematical Magic
219

For dates in the 2100s, we add 5 to the year code (or, equiv-
alently, subtract 2 from the year code). For example, since
2009 has a year code of 4, then 2109 has a year code of 4  5 
9, which, after subtracting 7 is the same as a year code of 2.
Dates in the 1700s are treated just like in the 2100s (by
adding 5 or subtracting 2) but we need to be careful. The days
that we are calculating are based on the Gregorian calendar,
established in 1582. But this calendar was not adopted by
England (and the American colonies) until 1752, when Wed-
nesday, September 2, was followed by Thursday, September
14. Let’s verify that September 14, 1752, was indeed a Thurs-
day. Since 2052 has a year code of 2 (from page 218, or by 
52  13  63  2), then 1752 has a year code of 0. Thus Sep-
tember 14, 1752, has
Month Code  Date Year Code  4  14  0  18
and 18  14  4, so it was indeed a Thursday. However, our for-
mula will not work for earlier dates (which were governed by
the Julian calendar).
Finally, we remark that under the Gregorian calendar, a leap
year occurs every four years, with the exception of years that
are divisible by 100, although there is an exception to the
exception: years divisible by 400 are leap years. Thus 1600,
2000, 2400, and 2800 are leap years, but 1700, 1800, 1900,
2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years. In fact, the
Gregorian calendar repeats every 400 years, so you can con-
vert any future date into a date near 2000. For example,
March 19, 2361, and March 19, 2761, will have the same day
of the week as March 19, 1961, which, as we already deter-
mined, is a Sunday.

Epilogue: How Math Helps Us
Think About Weird Things
by Michael Shermer
As the publisher of Skeptic magazine, the executive director of
the Skeptics Society, and a Scientiﬁc American editor with a
monthly column entitled “Skeptic,” I receive volumes of mail
from people who challenge me with stories about their unusual
experiences, such as haunted houses, ghosts, near-death and
out-of-body experiences, UFO sightings, alien abductions,
death-premonition dreams, and much more.
The most interesting stories to me are those about highly
improbable events. The implication of the letter writer’s tale is
that if I cannot offer a satisfactory natural explanation for that
particular event, the general principle of supernaturalism is pre-
served. A common story is the one about having a dream about
the death of a friend or relative, then a phone call comes the
next day about the unexpected death of the person in the dream.
What are the odds of that? I am asked.
Here is where math comes in to play in our thinking and rea-
soning. I don’t want to pontiﬁcate about how mathematics in
school teaches students to think critically, because that has

probably been said by nearly every math teacher in nearly every
math class in nearly every school in America, at least once a
year. I want to give some speciﬁc examples of how I use very
simple math to help me on the job in explaining why weird
things happen to people.
Although I cannot always explain such speciﬁc occurrences, a
principle of probability called the Law of Large Numbers shows
that an event with a low probability of occurrence in a small
number of trials has a high probability of occurrence in a large
number of trials. Or, as I like to say, million-to-one odds happen
295 times a day in America.
Let’s begin with death premonitions. Here is a little “back-of-
the-envelope” calculation I did. Psychologists tell us that the
average person has about ﬁve dreams per day, which equals
1,825 dreams per year. Even if we remember only one out of ten
dreams, that still results in 182.5 remembered dreams a year.
There are 295 million Americans, so that means there will be
53.8 billion remembered dreams per year. Now, anthropologists
and sociologists tell us that each of us knows about 150 people
fairly well (that is, the average person has about 150 names in
his or her address book about which can be said something sig-
niﬁcant). That means there is a network grid of 44.3 billion per-
sonal relationships among those 295 million Americans. The
annual U.S. death rate from all causes across all ages is .008, or
2.6 million per year. It is inevitable that some of those 53.8 bil-
lion remembered dreams will be about some of these 2.6 million
deaths among the 295 million Americans and their 44.3 billion
relationships. It would be a miracle, in fact, if some “death pre-
monition” dreams did not come true.
Even if my numbers are off, even way off, the point still
stands. What are the odds of a death premonition dream com-
ing true? Pretty darn good.
Epilogue: How Math Helps Us Think About Weird Things
223

There is an additional psychological factor at work here
called the conﬁrmation bias, where we notice the hits and ignore
the misses in support of our favorite beliefs. The conﬁrmation
bias explains how conspiracy theories work, for example. Peo-
ple who adhere to a particular conspiracy theory (9/11 was
orchestrated by the Bush administration in order to launch a
war in the Middle East), will look for and ﬁnd little factoids
here and there that seem to indicate that it might be true (Bush
sat in that classroom reading to the children about goats as if he
knew he was safe), while ignoring the vast body of evidence that
points to another more likely explanation (Osama bin Laden
and his band of international terrorists orchestrated 9/11). The
conﬁrmation bias also helps explain how astrologers, tarot-card
readers, and psychics seem so successful at “reading” people.
People who get a reading are likely to remember the handful of
hits and forget the countless misses. When such hits and misses
are actually counted—which I once did for an ABC television
special on psychics—it turns out that there is nothing more than
guessing and random chance at work.
In the case of the death-premonition dream, if just a couple of
these people who have such dreams recount their miraculous
tales in a public forum (next on Oprah!), the paranormal seems
vindicated. In fact, it is nothing more than the laws of probabil-
ity writ large.
This mathematical process of thinking about weird things led
me to another back-of-the-envelope calculation about miracles.
People typically invoke the term miracle to describe really
unusual events, events whose odds of occurring are a “million
to one.” Okay, let’s take that as our benchmark deﬁnition. A
miracle is an event whose odds of occurrence are a million to
one. Now, as we go about our day, we see and hear things hap-
pen about once per second. That is, data from the world and
Secrets of Mental Math
224

events around us are pouring in through our senses at a rate of
about one per second. If we are awake and alert and out in the
world for, say, eight hours a day, that means there are thirty
thousand bits of data per day, or one million events per month
that we take in. The vast majority of these data and events are
completely meaningless, of course, and our brains are wired to
ﬁlter out and forget the vast majority of them because we would
be overwhelmed otherwise. But, in the course of a month, we
would expect million-to-one odds to happen at least once. Add
to that the conﬁrmation bias where we will remember the most
unusual events and forget all the rest, and it is inevitable that
someone somewhere will report a miracle every month. And the
tabloids will be there to record it!
This is a short primer on how science works. In our quest to
understand how the world works, we need to determine what is
real and what is not, what happens by chance and what hap-
pens because of some particular predictable cause. The problem
we face is that the human brain was designed by evolution to
pay attention to the really unusual events and ignore the vast
body of data ﬂowing by; as such, thinking statistically and with
probabilities does not come naturally. Science, to that extent,
does not come naturally. It takes some training and practice.
In addition, there are those pesky cognitive biases I men-
tioned, such as the conﬁrmation bias. And there are others. The
data do not just speak for themselves. Data are ﬁltered through
very subjective and biased brains. The self-serving bias, for
example, dictates that we tend to see ourselves in a more posi-
tive light than others see us: national surveys show that most
business people believe they are more moral than other business
people, while psychologists who study moral intuition think
they are more moral than other such psychologists. In one Col-
lege Entrance Examination Board survey of 829,000 high school
Epilogue: How Math Helps Us Think About Weird Things
225

seniors, 0 percent rated themselves below average in “ability to
get along with others,” while 60 percent put themselves in the
top 10 percent (presumably not all were from Lake Woebegone).
And according to a 1997 U.S. News & World Report study on
who Americans believe are most likely to go to heaven, 52 per-
cent said Bill Clinton, 60 percent thought Princess Diana, 65 per-
cent chose Michael Jordan, 79 percent selected Mother Teresa,
and, at 87 percent, the person most likely to go to heaven was
the survey taker!
Princeton University psychology professor Emily Pronin
and her colleagues tested a bias called blind spot, in which
subjects recognized the existence and inﬂuence in others of
eight different cognitive biases, but they failed to see those
same biases in themselves. In one study on Stanford University
students, when asked to compare themselves to their peers on
such personal qualities as friendliness and selﬁshness, they pre-
dictably rated themselves higher. Even when the subjects were
warned about the better-than-average bias and were asked to
reevaluate their original assessments, 63 percent claimed that
their initial evaluations were objective, and 13 percent even
claimed that they were originally too modest! In a second
study, Pronin randomly assigned subjects high or low scores
on a “social intelligence” test. Unsurprisingly, those given the
high marks rated the test fairer and more useful than those
receiving low marks. When asked if it was possible that they
had been inﬂuenced by the score on the test, subjects responded
that other participants had been far more biased than they
were. In a third study in which Pronin queried subjects about
what method they used to assess their own and others’ biases,
she found that people tend to use general theories of behavior
when evaluating others, but use introspection when appraising
Secrets of Mental Math
226

themselves; however, in what is called the introspection illu-
sion, people do not believe that others can be trusted to do the
same. Okay for me but not for thee.
The University of California at Berkeley psychologist Frank J.
Sulloway and I made a similar discovery of an attribution bias
in a study we conducted on why people say they believe in God,
and why they think other people believe in God. In general,
most people attribute their own belief in God to such intellec-
tual reasons as the good design and complexity of the world,
whereas they attribute others’ belief in God to such emotional
reasons as it is comforting, gives meaning, and that they were
raised to believe. Political scientists have made a similar discov-
ery about political attitudes, where Republicans justify their
conservative attitudes with rational arguments but claim that
Democrats are “bleeding-heart liberals,” and where Democrats
claim that their liberal attitudes are the most rational but claim
that Republicans are “heartless.”
How does science deal with such subjective biases? How do we
know when a claim is bogus or real? We want to be open-minded
enough to accept radical new ideas when they occasionally come
along, but we don’t want to be so open-minded that our brains
fall out. This problem led us at the Skeptics Society to create an
educational tool called the Baloney Detection Kit, inspired by
Carl Sagan’s discussion of how to detect “baloney” in his mar-
velous book The Demon-Haunted World. In this Baloney Detec-
tion Kit, we suggest ten questions to ask when encountering any
claim that can help us decide if we are being too open-minded in
accepting it or too closed-minded in rejecting it.
1. How reliable is the source of the claim? As Daniel Kevles
showed so effectively in his 1999 book The Baltimore Affair, in
Epilogue: How Math Helps Us Think About Weird Things
227

investigating possible scientiﬁc fraud there is a boundary prob-
lem in detecting a fraudulent signal within the background noise
of mistakes and sloppiness that is a normal part of the scientiﬁc
process. The investigation of research notes in a laboratory afﬁl-
iated with Nobel laureate David Baltimore by an independent
committee established by Congress to investigate potential fraud
revealed a surprising number of mistakes. But science is messier
than most people realize. Baltimore was exonerated when it
became clear that there was no purposeful data manipulation.
2. Does this source often make similar claims? Pseudoscientists
have a habit of going well beyond the facts, so when individuals
make numerous extraordinary claims, they may be more than
just iconoclasts. This is a matter of quantitative scaling, since
some great thinkers often go beyond the data in their creative
speculations. Cornell’s Thomas Gold is notorious for his radical
ideas, but he has been right often enough that other scientists
listen to what he has to say. Gold proposes, for example, that oil
is not a fossil fuel at all, but the by-product of a deep hot bio-
sphere. Hardly any earth scientists I have spoken with take this
thesis seriously, yet they do not consider Gold a crank. What we
are looking for here is a pattern of fringe thinking that consis-
tently ignores or distorts data.
3. Have the claims been veriﬁed by another source? Typically
pseudoscientists will make statements that are unveriﬁed, or
veriﬁed by a source within their own belief circle. We must ask
who is checking the claims, and even who is checking the check-
ers. The biggest problem with the cold fusion debacle, for exam-
ple, was not that scientists Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischman
were wrong; it was that they announced their spectacular dis-
covery before it was veriﬁed by other laboratories (at a press
Secrets of Mental Math
228

conference no less), and, worse, when cold fusion was not repli-
cated, they continued to cling to their claim.
4. How does the claim ﬁt with what we know about how the
world works? An extraordinary claim must be placed into a
larger context to see how it ﬁts. When people claim that the
pyramids and the Sphinx were built more than ten thousand
years ago by an advanced race of humans, they are not present-
ing any context for that earlier civilization. Where are the rest of
the artifacts of those people? Where are their works of art, their
weapons, their clothing, their tools, their trash? This is simply
not how archaeology works.
5.Has anyone gone out of the way to disprove the claim,or has
only conﬁrmatory evidence been sought? This is the conﬁrma-
tion bias, or the tendency to seek conﬁrmatory evidence and
reject or ignore disconﬁrmatory evidence. The conﬁrmation bias
is powerful and pervasive and is almost impossible for any of us
to avoid. It is why the methods of science that emphasize check-
ing and rechecking, veriﬁcation and replication, and especially
attempts to falsify a claim are so critical.
6. Does the preponderance of evidence converge to the
claimant’s conclusion, or a different one? The theory of evolu-
tion, for example, is proven through a convergence of evidence
from a number of independent lines of inquiry. No one fossil, no
one piece of biological or paleontological evidence has “evolu-
tion” written on it; instead there is a convergence of evidence
from tens of thousands of evidentiary bits that adds up to a
story of the evolution of life. Creationists conveniently ignore
this convergence, focusing instead on trivial anomalies or cur-
rently unexplained phenomena in the history of life.

7. Is the claimant employing the accepted rules of reason and
tools of research, or have these been abandoned in favor of
others that lead to the desired conclusion? UFOlogists suffer
this fallacy in their continued focus on a handful of unexplained
atmospheric anomalies and visual misperceptions by eyewit-
nesses, while conveniently ignoring the fact that the vast major-
ity (90 to 95 percent) of UFO sightings are fully explicable with
prosaic answers.
8. Has the claimant provided a different explanation for the
observed phenomena, or is it strictly a process of denying the
existing explanation? This is a classic debate strategy—criticize
your opponent and never afﬁrm what you believe in order to
avoid criticism. But this stratagem is unacceptable in science. Big
Bang skeptics, for example, ignore the convergence of evidence of
this cosmological model, focus on the few ﬂaws in the accepted
model, and have yet to offer a viable cosmological alternative that
carries a preponderance of evidence in favor of it.
9. If the claimant has proffered a new explanation, does it
account for as many phenomena as the old explanation? The
HIV-AIDS skeptics argue that lifestyle, not HIV, causes AIDS.
Yet, to make this argument they must ignore the convergence of
evidence in support of HIV as the causal vector in AIDS, and
simultaneously ignore such blatant evidence as the signiﬁcant
correlation between the rise in AIDS among hemophiliacs
shortly after HIV was inadvertently introduced into the blood
supply. On top of this, their alternative theory does not explain
nearly as much of the data as the HIV theory.
10. Do the claimants’ personal beliefs and biases drive the con-
clusions, or vice versa? All scientists hold social, political, and
Secrets of Mental Math

ideological beliefs that could potentially slant their interpreta-
tions of the data, but how do those biases and beliefs affect their
research? At some point, usually during the peer-review system,
such biases and beliefs are rooted out, or the paper or book is
rejected for publication. This is why one should not work in an
intellectual vacuum. If you don’t catch the biases in your
research, someone else will.
There is no deﬁnitive set of criteria we can apply in determin-
ing how open-minded we should be when encountering new
claims and ideas, but with mathematical calculations on the
odds of weird things happening and with an analysis of the sorts
of questions we should ask when we encounter weird things, we
have made a start toward coming to grips with our weird and
wonderful world.
