Biography: 
1870  
Alfred Adler was born Feb 7 in a suburb of  
Vienna. He was the second son in a Jewish family of 
seven children. His father was a grain merchant coming 
from Burgenland. 
Adler was a child of weak health condition, suffering 
from rachitis (rickets) and laryngospasm. He was able to 
walk only at the age of four. When he was five he nearly 
died from pneumonia - doctors had already given up his 
treatment. 
The experience of his younger brother dying and his 
own weak physical condition made him come to the 
decision to become a medical doctor in his early years. 
In his autobiographical notes he describes that he had 
set a goal to overcome his fear of death by choosing the 
occupation of a physician.

Erzieher” (the physician as educator) He converts to Protestantism, not because 
of religious reasons but as a symbol for his attitude of non-religious life style 
(which at that time only could be shown in this way)

Adler was free from any pomposity. He spoke the Viennese dialect, enjoyed sociability 
and simple pleasure of life, such as food. He was very musical, had a good voice and 
enjoyed singing the ballads of Schubert and Schumann. 
His manner was generally simple, he preferred to use non-technical language, 
addressing to any kind of audiences in order to reach as many people directly as 
possible. 
After his many lectures, he liked to be surrounded by the audience, answering 
questions. He would later continue the discussion at home. 
So his students often visited him at home – he stayed in Salmannsdorf, which is a 
green district of Vienna.

Alfred Adler´s most outstanding personal characteristic was his interest in and his 
sympathy with the „common man“. From his student days on he was keenly interested 
in social problems and improvement of living conditions.  
Also from his early years of professional life he was highly engaged in school reform and 
also supported his wife in her activities in women's rights. 
So it was only natural that he was attached to any kind of social reform and therefore 
the Social-Democratic Movement.

both - depth psychology because it

Like S.Freud A. Adler distinguishes the 
“conscious” and the “unconscious”. But 
conscious and unconscious are not 
antipodal struggling forces, as A. Adler is 
understanding the unconscious as “not 
awareness”. 
•
Conscious and unconscious are aspects of a 
unified relational system.
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Theory of neurosis  
•
the psyche is determined by drives, especially the 
sexual drive 
•
the sexual drive develops in different phases; during a 
certain phase a special body region is provided with 
libidinal energy (oral, anal, phallic, latency, genital …) 
•
the drive occurs tension, which has to be discharged - 
this leads to feelings of pleasure 
•
the manner of accomplishment with the drive tension 
leads to specific characters (oral, anal, …) 
•
neurosis develops because of repression of drives (or 
trauma)

At the beginning: 
Theory of Organ inferiority 
Early discussion of psychosomatic disorder! 
!
•A disease afflicts only the inferior  
 (= weak) organ which reacts to pathogenic 
stimuli from the environment 
e.g. 
! Franz Alexander (1950): increased 
vulnerability of an organ causes somatic 
reaction to emotional stress
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

„organ dialect“ 
= a way of expressing inner psychic conflicts 
which cannot be put in words,  
 aiming unconsciously to superiority in a 
discouraged way

Aggression Drive (1908)
•
a superordinate dynamic force 
•
if satisfaction of a basic drive 
failed, the aggression drive will 
succeed satisfaction 
•
a superordinate psychological field 
which connects the drives
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Need for Affection (1908)
•
innate need 
•
children want to be fondled, loved 
and praised 
•
need for social relationship 
•
later develops the social interest
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Masculine Protest (1911)
•
through this concept Adler turns 
toward a psychological path  
•
sex is a metaphor: man = 
superiority; woman = inferiority 
•
overcompensation of feelings of 
inferiority 
•
the desire of being a powerful 
person instead of an inferior one

Feeling of inferiority
•
The primary feeling of inferiority is the 
original and normal feeling in the infant 
and child of smallness, weakness, and 
dependency. 
Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred Adler

• Feeling of inferiority usually acts as an 
incentive for development: 
!
One basic force behind all human activity, a 
striving from a felt minus situation towards a plus 
situation; from a feeling of inferiority towards 
superiority and perfection.

Fictionalism by H. Vaihinger 
(1852 -1933)
•
„The Philosophy of „As If“: A System of the 
Theoretical, Practical, and Religious Fictions of 
Mankind“ (1911) 
•
fictions are ideas, including unconscious 
notions, which have no counterpart in 
reality (e.g. classifications, reducing 
complexity, typology, using analogy, 
mathematics etc.) 
•
useful 
•
hypothesis, dogma 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Fiction and Finalism by A. Adler
•
fictions are helpful for solving 
problems 
•
an „as if world“ 
•
security giving points of orientation 
•
fictions can be adapted and 
abandoned 
•
finalism - orientation toward a final 
goal which gives orientation in the 
chaos of life
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Fictional final goal
•
not only the past determines 
individuals but also the future 
•
causa efficiens + causa finalis 
•
forward orientation of the 
individual toward a final goal (the 
unifying condition)  
•
unconscious 
•
creation of the individual
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
constructed in early childhood as a bridge 
into the future where power and 
superiority resides 
•
has the inevitability of fate if it remains 
unconscious 
•
in hours of insecurity fictions become more 
prominent
Fictional final goal
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
The striving for overcoming, for 
compensation of inferiority, receives its 
specific direction  from the individually 
unique goal, an “ideal self”.
Striving for overcoming, 
perfection, power, superiority
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Compensation – avoidance - 
overcompensation
•
Compensation is the natural 
reaction of the nonneurotic person 
who has accepted being an 
imperfect creature 
•
to be human means to feel inferior 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Compensation – avoidance - 
overcompensation
•
neurotic person is concerned about his 
(enhancement) self-esteem, his goal is of 
superiority 
•
„normal“ person is concerned with 
gaining satisfaction by overcoming 
difficulties which are appreciated as such 
by the others as well - his superiority 
goal includes the welfare of others
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Compensation – avoidance - 
overcompensation
•
Overcompensation by finding means 
to excel in this or another area
As a boy Demosthenes had a speech impediment: 
Demosthenes actually suffered rhotacism, 
mispronouncing ρ (r) as λ (l), had a weak voice. So 
he went to the sea shore, put pebbles into his mouth 
and trained to pronounce very clearly, citing verses 
while running and raising his voice to become louder 
than the roar of the waves. He became one of the 
most famous orators of Ancient Greece.
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Safeguarding tendencies
• Strategies to protect self esteem, to avoid 
situations of inferiority feeling.
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler
Example:  
A child does not do his homework, does not 
prepare for exams. 
What is the safeguarding function in this 
behavior?

•
The individual cannot be considered apart 
from his social environment and situation. 
He is always to be seen as socially 
embedded.  
•
Everybody is aiming to find his place of 
value within the social community. 
Social Interest
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
Socialization of the individual is not 
achieved by repression, but is afforded 
through an innate human ability, which, 
however, needs to be developed.
Social Interest
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Social Interest
•
is not an inborn full-fledged entity 
•
an innate potentiality which has to 
be developed consciously 
•
it develops in a social context 
•
remains throughout life
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Social Interest
• „to see through the eyes, to hear through 
the ears, to feel with the heart of the 
other person“ 
• identification and empathy 
• these abilities are necessary for 
relationships

Style of Life
Adler called an individual's characteristic 
approach to life the “style of life”.  
He expressed this concept as self or ego, 
personality, individuality, the unity of the 
personality, an individual form of creative 
activity, the method of facing problems, 
one's opinion about oneself and the 
problems of life, or the whole attitude 
towards life. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
dynamic concept comprising the final 
goal, the individuals opinion about 
himself, the others and the world 
•
the independent creation of the 
individual           
Style of Life
Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred Adler
the child is not a passive creature 
molded by external forces

Style of Life
“Everyone carries within himself an opinion of himself and 
the problems of life, a life line, and a law of movement which 
keeps fast hold of him without his understanding it or giving 
himself an account of it.”  
(Adler, 1933a)
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

57
Style of Life
• Every individual keeps trying to overcome the feeling of inferiority of early 
childhood by striving for perfection, completion, superiority or evolution. 
• Like Freud, Adler viewed the first five years of life as central in the 
development of personality. By that time, children have experienced 
enough to have adopted a prototype of their goal and style of life, 
although there can be some modification throughout the rest of childhood 
and adolescence. 
• The style of life becomes the way in which individuals approach or avoid 
the three main tasks of life and try to realize their fictional final goal. In 
healthy persons, this dealing with the tasks of life is relatively flexible. 
They can find many ways of solving problems and, when one way is 
blocked, they can choose another. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Style of Life
!
The Style of Life has to be understood as an unconscious 
program of self concepts, concepts of the world, goals and 
believes how those goals can be reached. This life line shapes 
strategies of behavior, which the individual takes for suitable to 
get from his starting point to the goal of overcoming 
difficulties. 
!
Style of Life becomes obvious as soon a person is exposed to 
new and demanding tasks.
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Scheme of Apperception
“The first four to five years are enough for the child to 
complete his/her specific and arbitrary training in the 
face of impressions from the body and the environment. 
From then on the creative activity of the style of life 
begins its work.”  
“The apperception connected with the law of movement 
is the way in which man looks at himself and the 
external world. … It is the opinion which the child, and 
later, in the same direction, the adult has gained of 
himself and the world.” 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Scheme of Apperception
!
The ways of conceiving the self and the world 
seem to fashion for us a set of “lenses” through 
which we see the world.  
Individual perception is limited and there will 
always be a discrepancy between reality and 
the perception of it.  
For normal people, this discrepancy is 
relatively small; for psychologically disturbed 
people, the discrepancy is much greater. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Scheme of Apperception
!
Our senses do not receive actual facts, but a 
subjective image of them.   
The same experience does not mean the same 
to all people experiencing. 
! It is not the event that takes influence on 
us, but the meaning we link to it !
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Scheme of Apperception
!
An example, used by Adler: 
Caesar ´s landing in Egypt:  
Caesar jumped ashore, stumbled and fell on 
the ground. 
Roman soldiers took this as an unfavorable 
omen, until Caesar threw out his arms and 
shouted: “I am embracing you, Africa!”
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

63
Scheme of Apperception -  
Style of life
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler
- by early memories one can obtain more 
easily a picture of the style of life 
- but any event will express the basic 
attitude 
- unconscious and not assailable to 
criticism (of experience)

Adler’s autobiographically note: 
„When I was five I became ill with pneumonia and was 
given up by the physician. A second physician advised a 
treatment just the same, and in a few days I became 
well again. In the joy over my recovery, there was talk 
for a long time about the mortal danger in which I was 
supposed to have been. From that time on I recall 
always thinking of myself in the future as a physician. 
This means that I hat set a goal from which I could 
expect an end to my childlike distress, my fear of 
death. Clearly I expected more from the occupation of 
my choice than it could accomplish :
Scheme of Apperception -  
Style of life
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

The over coming of death and of the fear of death is 
something I should not have expected from human, but 
only from divine accomplishments. Reality, however, 
demands action, and so I was forced to modify my goal by 
changing the conscious form of the guiding fiction until it 
appeared to satisfy reality. So I came to choose the 
occupation of physician in order to overcome death and 
the fear of death.“

• Feeling of Inferiority 
• Fictional final Goal 
• Striving for Overcoming 
• Safeguarding Tendencies 
• Social Interest 
• Style of Life 
• Scheme of Apperception
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Four basic patterns of style of life can be 
detected:  
•
active and constructive („I have to be 
successful");  
•
passive and constructive (“I have to sacrifice 
myself for others”, “I always have to be 
charming”);  
•
active and destructive (“I have to oppose”,”I 
have to take revenge, I have to pay back”);  
•
passive and destructive ("I have to show my 
weaknesses, I have to be lazy”). 
Style of Life
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Observing Style of Life  
in situations of everyday-life
• Imagine a group of four friends going to a 
restaurant 
Each of the four persons has a different life style. 
They enter the restaurant, the servant tells them 
that their pre-booked table has already been given 
away to another group of four, there is only a 
table with three chairs available.  
How would each person of this group of four react, 
depending on his/her individual life style?
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Basic propositions of Individual 
Psychology
•
there is one basic dynamic force behind all human activity, a 
striving from a felt minus situation towards a plus situation, 
from a feeling of inferiority towards superiority (perfection) 
•
the striving receives its specific direction from an individually 
unique goal of self-ideal, which though influenced by biological 
and environmental factors is ultimately the creation of the 
individual. Because it is an ideal, the goal is a fiction. 
•
the goal is only dimly envisaged by the individual, (or even fully 
unconscious) which means that it is largely unknown to him and 
not understood by him.  
•
the goal becomes the final cause and the key for understanding 
the individual
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

• the style of life comprises the movement towards this goal. It 
becomes established in early childhood by the age of 5-6 years, at a 
time where there is no language for feelings and thoughts. That is 
one of the reasons why the style of life rests unknown for the 
individual. 
• the style of life, which means the individuals opinion about himself, 
the others and the world, the movement toward the final goal, his 
apperceptive scheme, his interpretations of life (subjectivity) 
influences every psychological process.  
• the individual cannot be considered apart from his social situation 
and is regarded as socially embedded. IP refuses to recognize and 
examine an isolated human being. 
• all important life problems, including certain drive satisfactions, 
become social problems.

Optimal development of personality
•
In an optimal situation of 
development, adults will win 
children’s cooperation, helping them 
to develop a sense of significance 
through contributing to others, 
minimizing their inferiority feelings, 
stimulating their courage, guiding 
them to be active, and helping them 
feel a part of the whole. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Optimal development of personality
•
These experiences will help children 
identify and develop their capacities 
and become cooperative, productive, 
and satisfied adults. They will be able 
to see and feel their interdependence 
with others and be challenged to 
develop sufficient courage to deal 
with difficulties, to connect intimately 
with others, and to improve 
themselves for the benefit of all. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Maladjustment: “Discouragement” 
• mistaken opinion of: himself (by increased and 
exaggerated inferiority feelings) and the world 
• mistaken style of life: underdeveloped social 
interest and uncooperative goal of personal 
superiority, self-centered instead of task-
centered 
• various forms of abnormal behavior aimed at 
safeguarding the self esteem 
• an unconscious process
The neurotic character
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

The neurotic character
•
Caused by discouragement, the 
person follows a destructive style of 
life, using the symptoms of neurosis 
to reach a fictive superiority. 
•
strives for superiority over others 
rather than superiority over 
difficulties.  
•
A rigid tendentious apperception 
makes the person interpret anything 
self-centered negatively. 
•
lacks of social interest. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
feelings of insecurity force the 
neurotic to stronger attachment to 
fictions, ideals, and principles 
•
her/his thinking is characterized by 
antitheses, dichotomies, and 
prejudice 
•
she/he clings to dogmatized 
fictions to support him in his efforts 
at coping with life
The neurotic character
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
neurotic symptoms have the task to 
safeguard the person’s self-esteem 
•
symptoms: a form of defense of the 
ego from threats by outside 
demands and problems of life (not 
only against instinctual demands)

Adlerian Psychotherapy
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Adlerian Psychotherapy
•
The overall goal of Adlerian 
psychotherapy is helping an individual 
to develop from a partially functioning 
person into a more fully functioning 
one. Fully functioning means solving 
each of the areas of life more 
cooperatively, more courageously, 
with a greater sense of contribution 
and a greater sense of satisfaction. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Adlerian Psychotherapy
•
The first specific goal of therapy is not 
necessarily fulfilling the client's 
expectation. The client may want instant, 
and somewhat magical, relief of symptoms 
or to continue what he is doing without 
feeling so uncomfortable.  
•
The therapist has to be sympathetic to this 
desire, but must clarify and establish, as 
quickly as possible, the cooperative working 
relationship that is required for genuine 
improvement of a difficult situation. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Presumptions
clients come to therapy because they: 
•
 do not understand their symptoms  
•
 cannot control them  
•
 and are frightened by them. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
Psychotherapy represents a specific 
mode of joint action that is at the same 
time instrumental and deeply dialogical  
•
the consultation is a social problem, 
the patient will introduce himself 
according to his law of movement 
•
patient has the same feelings toward 
the therapist as toward important 
persons
Presumptions
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
Even if not available for self-
reflection, the client's problematic 
experiences are an inseparable 
aspect of his or her personality, 
echoing the events that formed 
them. 
Presumptions
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
The client's partly disowned 
experiences lie buried in his/her 
symptoms, which can be regarded 
as meaning-laden signs. 
•
symptoms are individual creations, 
a unique work of art
Presumptions
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
communication does more than just 
report or describe 
•
It is NOT just gathering data to 
come to a theoretically based 
intervention 
Presumptions
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

what psychotherapeutic discourse should 
be:
•
The art of guiding the client to a 
better understanding for him/herself 
•
The art of guiding and supporting 
the client to understand the 
meaning and the aim of his/her 
symptoms and his/her disorder 
•
The art of guiding the client to 
overtake accountability for him/
herself 
•
The art of guiding the client to a 
satisfying new way of life-style 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

Psychotherapeutic discourse
•
Has to provide the climate to 
express feelings, even and 
especially if they are considered 
unsocial, unattractive, immoral, 
insane 
•
Has to give room to feelings which 
have been unknown 
•
Has to support the process of 
growth and personal freedom
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

the most trustworthy approach to the 
exploration of personality is given in as 
comprehensive understanding of: 
•
earliest childhood recollections 
•
position of the birth order 
•
childhood disorders 
•
day and night dream 
•
the nature of the exogenous factor 
that causes the illness
127
Psychotherapeutic discourse
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred

most important component of the

Adlerian Psychotherapy
•
After studying the parallel patterns 
of childhood and the present and 
analyzing the rich projective 
material in early recollections and 
dreams, the therapist develops 
preliminary hypotheses about the 
inferiority feelings, goal, life style, 
private logic, and scheme of 
apperception. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

136
Adlerian Psychotherapy
•
Genuine self-esteem does not come 
from the approval or praise of 
others. It comes from the person's 
own experience of conquering 
difficulties. Therefore, small 
progressive action steps, aimed at 
overcoming previously avoided 
difficulties, must be taken, one at 
a time. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

139
The patient's  style of life is influencing the 
relationship between the client and the 
therapist. This is permanently taken into 
account within the treatment.

Analyzing (day and night) Dreams
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

143
Techniques of Adlerian Psychotherapy: 
Early Memories
Early memories, whether they are "true" or fictional, 
embody a person's core beliefs and feelings about self 
and the world. They contain reflections of the 
person's inferiority feelings, goal, scheme of 
apperception, level and radius of activity, courage, 
feeling of community, and style of life. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
recollections can be classified as 
productions of the individual 
•
according to Adler they are selections, 
distortions, or inventions of past events 
which have to fit the underlying mood, 
purpose, and interest of the patient, his 
style of life 
•
they reflect the individuals inner world 
and style of life 
•
first memory is the fundamental view of 
life
144
Early Recollections 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

145
Techniques of Adlerian Psychotherapy: 
Socratic Questioning:
!
Early stages of psychotherapy: the therapist uses questions to 
gather relevant information, clarify meaning, and verify 
feelings.  
Middle stages of therapy:  more penetrating, leading 
questions uncover the deeper structures of private logic, 
hidden feelings, and unconscious goals. Throughout, new 
options are generated dialectically, examined, and evaluated 
to help the client take steps in a different direction of his/her 
own choosing. The results of these new steps are constantly 
reviewed.  
In the later stages of therapy, the Socratic method is used to 
evaluate the impact of the client's new direction 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

146
Techniques of Adlerian Psychotherapy: 
Guided and Eidetic Imagery:
!
Some clients need a vivid image of themselves as 
happier in the future than they presently are, before they 
journey in a new direction that they know is healthier.  
Guided imagery can be used therapeutically to change 
the negative imprints of childhood family members. 
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

•
Freud’s important contribution for the 
understanding of dreams 
•
manifest and latent content of the 
dream 
•

Techniques of Adlerian Psychotherapy 
Analyzing Dreams
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

148
Techniques of Adlerian Psychotherapy: 
Analyzing dreams:
!
Unity of personality: belonging to this unity is characterizing 
dreams. 
Dreams have to be considered as one of the expressions of 
the style of life. 
In dreams we fool ourselves into an inadequate solution of a 
problem, inadequate from the standpoint of common sense, 
but adequate from the standpoint of our style of life. 
Dreams are metaphors, the goal of achievement remains the 
same as in waking life, but with increased emotional power.
Brigitte Sindelar/Gabriela Pap: The Individual Psychology of Alfred 
Adler

149
Techniques of Adlerian Psychotherapy: 
Analyzing dreams:
Example, given by Adler: 
A case of anxiety neurosis taking the form of 
agoraphobia, heart symptoms, occurred in a man of 
thirty-five. The man wishes to marry.  
Dream: „I crossed the border between Austria and 
Hungary, and they wanted to imprison me.“
What does that dream tell us (and the patient) about 
the final goal of his symptoms.
