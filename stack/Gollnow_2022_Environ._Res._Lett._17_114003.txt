Abstract
Tropical deforestation continues despite global efforts to curb forest loss. Corporate
zero-deforestation supply chain commitments (ZDCs) have the potential to address this
deforestation, especially if strong state-led forest governance is absent. Yet, because ZDC adoption
is limited to particular locations and supply chains, these commitments may fall short at reducing
regional deforestation and protecting biodiverse ecosystems. Here, we leverage timeseries of
spatially explicit corporate commodity sourcing data and ZDCs to assess the current and potential
effect of ZDCs within soybean supply chains on forest loss and biodiversity. We focus on the
Brazilian Amazon, where the first ZDC (soy moratorium (SoyM)) was implemented, and the
Cerrado, where companies have adopted but not implemented ZDCs. We found that in the
Amazon, SoyM signatories that controlled the market caused a 57% reduction in direct
deforestation for soy from 2006 to 2015. In the Cerrado, if companies had implemented their
ZDCs with the same relative effectiveness as in the Amazon, deforestation for soy could have been
reduced by 46%. Thus, ZDC implementation in the Cerrado via stringent monitoring and
enforcement could contribute substantially to forest and habitat conservation. Yet, incomplete
ZDC adoption leaves >50% of soy-suitable forests and the biodiversity that they harbor outside the
reach of ZDCs. To protect these forests, it is vital to incentivize more companies—including
smaller, less publicly exposed traders—to make and implement ZDCs, while also promoting forest
governance through public policy.
1. Introduction
Agricultural commodity expansion is a leading cause
of tropical deforestation (Curtis et al 2018). Defor-
estation drives regional biodiversity loss and is the
second-largest contributor to global greenhouse gas
emissions after fossil fuel use (van der Werf et al 2009,
Gibbs et al 2010). Locally, deforestation-induced
ecosystem service losses may lead to reductions in
agricultural productivity, threaten the livelihoods of
indigenous and other forest-dependent groups, and
increase inequality and conflicts (Henders et al 2015,
de Vos 2016, Alroy 2017, Leclère et al 2020, Leite-Filho
et al 2021, Russo Lopes et al 2021).
The main commodities causing deforestation are
highly concentrated in the hands of a few multina-
tional companies (Hoffmann 2013, Zu Ermgassen
et al 2020). Increased public awareness of the corpor-
ate influence on commodity production has spurred
civil society to demand that such companies improve
the sustainability of their supply chains (Gefi and
Mayer 2004, Latapí Agudelo et al 2019). By 2021, at
least 94 companies had adopted zero-deforestation
supply chain commitments (ZDCs), public pledges of
intention to eliminate deforestation from their sup-
ply chains (Rothrock et al 2022). The large volume
of agricultural commodity production handled by
these companies positions voluntary supply chain

governance as a potentially important tool for con-
serving forests. However, ZDC adoption has no direct
effect on forests without implementation. Implement-
ation includes disseminating policy requirements to
stakeholders, developing and/or applying deforesta-
tion monitoring and verification systems, and enfor-
cing new requirements (Garrett et al 2019, Austin et al
2021, Grabs et al 2021).
The Brazilian soybean sector has long been a focus
of zero-deforestation initiatives due to the substan-
tial deforestation attributed to soy in the Amazon
and Cerrado biomes (figure 1) (Kastens et al 2017,
Gollnow et al 2018, Rausch et al 2019). While cattle
ranching remains the main direct cause of deforest-
ation in Brazil, in the mid-2000s soy expansion into
forests caused around 30% of all deforestation in the
Amazon and 18% in the Cerrado (Gibbs et al 2015,
Rausch et al 2019). Deforestation for soy declined
to 1% of Brazilian Amazon deforestation by 2014,
but increased to 22% of Cerrado forest loss by 2011
(Gibbs et al 2015, Rausch et al 2019).
This reduction in direct deforestation for soy
(hereafter,
‘soy-deforestation’)
in
the
Brazilian
Amazon has been partially attributed to the soy
moratorium (SoyM) (Rudorff et al 2011, Macedo
et al 2012, Gibbs et al 2015, Costa et al 2017, Kastens
et al 2017, Gollnow et al 2018, Heilmayr et al 2020).
The SoyM was the first industry-specific voluntary
ZDC in the tropics (Greenpeace 2006, Gibbs et al
2015). Companies that signed the SoyM implemen-
ted their agreements to not purchase soybeans pro-
duced on lands deforested after 2006, a cut-off date
later moved to 2008 (Gibbs et al 2015).
Previous research on the SoyM’s impacts assumed
complete and homogenous implementation across
all soy companies and producing regions in the
Brazilian Amazon (Gibbs et al 2015, Kastens et al
2017, Heilmayr et al 2020). SoyM signatories handled
around 90% of exports from the Amazon in 2017
(Zu Ermgassen et al 2020). Because these compan-
ies preferentially source from certain municipalit-
ies, levels of ZDC implementation vary across space
(Leijten et al 2022). This heterogeneity is relevant
because the collective local market share of companies
implementing ZDCs may influence supplier decisions
regarding forest clearance. Specifically, in locations
where SoyM signatories dominate the market, suppli-
ers may be less likely to deforest because they cannot
easily sell to actors without ZDCs (Mayer and Gefi
2010, Garrett et al 2019). Evaluating how deforesta-
tion is affected by the local degree of SoyM imple-
mentation, measured as ZDC market share, would
provide insight into the mechanisms underpinning
ZDC effectiveness.
Although ZDC implementation in Brazil has
occurred largely in the Amazon, most Brazilian soy is
produced in the Cerrado, a biome rich in biodiversity
but subject to comparatively lax native vegetation
protection requirements (NVP 2012, Strassburg et al
2017). In 2018, 48% of Brazil’s soybean production
was located in the Cerrado, compared to only 14% in
the Amazon (IBGE 2020). Yet only 20% of remaining
native Cerrado vegetation is undisturbed and just 8%
of the biome is covered by protected areas compared
to 46% in the Amazon (Strassburg et al 2017, Rausch
et al 2019). The recent adoption of ZDCs by several
companies that source from the Cerrado promises
to increase conservation in the biome, protecting
additional forest and associated habitats. A previ-
ous ex-ante assessment of potential ZDC impacts in
the Cerrado used a best case but unrealistic scen-
ario in which all companies sourcing from the Cer-
rado adopted and implemented ZDCs (Soterroni et al
2019). To inform corporate and advocacy organiz-
ations strategies regarding ZDCs in the Cerrado, a
more realistic appraisal that incorporates the level and
distribution of current pledges is needed.
Finally, ascertaining the future potential of ZDCs
relies partially on a better understanding of which
companies adopt ZDCs. Existing research suggests
no significant differences in soy-deforestation risk
between firms with and without ZDC, and that
traders with geographically stable sourcing areas are
more likely to adopt a ZDC (Zu Ermgassen et al 2020,
Leijten et al 2022). However, it remains unclear how
other factors condition ZDC adoption in soybean
supply chains.
Given the potential of ZDCs to address tropical
deforestation and biodiversity loss, we aim to more
accurately measure how the spatial and temporal
heterogeneity of ZDC adoption and implementa-
tion across companies, biomes, and localities affects
soy-driven deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon,
and how ZDCs might reduce deforestation if cur-
rent commitments were implemented in the Cerrado.
Specifically, we ask:
(a) What are the attributes of companies that have
adopted soy ZDCs in the Amazon and Cerrado?
(b) To what degree do adopted or implemented
ZDCs cover forests suitable for soy expansion,
and how much of the habitat of threatened,
forest-dependent species falls within those soy-
suitable forests?
(c) What was the effect of SoyM implementation on
direct soy-deforestation in the Amazon?
(d) How much direct soy-deforestation in the Cer-
rado could have been avoided had adopted ZDCs
been implemented with similar effectiveness and
at the same time as the SoyM?
To address these questions, we first compiled
attributes of major soy traders (with and without
adopted ZDCs) and tracked their sourcing regions
across the Amazon and Cerrado biomes from 2006 to
2015. Then, we evaluated the association between the
2

F Gollnow et al
attributes of these companies and their ZDC adoption
status. We assessed the coverage of such ZDCs vis-`a-
vis threatened forests and forest-dependent species.
Finally, we conducted post-hoc (Amazon) and ex-ante
(Cerrado) evaluations using the municipal market
share of companies with implemented (Amazon)
or adopted (Cerrado) ZDCs to estimate actual or
potential avoided direct soy-deforestation from ZDC
implementation. This research thus provides a more
holistic understanding of the dynamic interactions
between supply policy adoption, implementation,
and outcomes.
2. Methods
2.1. Study area
The study area comprises the Brazilian Amazon and
Cerrado biomes (figure 1), including all companies
exporting soybeans from those areas.
2.2. Background and hypotheses
2.2.1. ZDC adoption
Adoption of voluntary environmental policies by cor-
porations is often driven by advocacy campaigns,
which may result in loss of market shares or market
access for the targeted company (Hendry 2006, Chrun
et al 2016). Thus, a company’s decision to adopt a
sustainability program such as a ZDC is commonly
associated with attributes that make it a likely focus
of such campaigns (Hendry 2006, Mayer and Gefi
2010, Chrun et al 2016, Nolte et al 2017, Rueda et al
2017). These include relatively high corporate envir-
onmental impact (e.g. deforestation), high market
influence, and strong pro-environmental preferences
within consumer market and headquarter locations
such as the EU (Hendry 2006, Nolte et al 2017, Rueda
et al 2017). Thus, we hypothesize that ZDC adop-
tion is more likely for companies that source from
and have infrastructure in high deforestation areas,
are larger, handle more soy, export more soy to the
EU, or are headquartered in the EU.
2.2.2. ZDC implementation and market share
In places where the market share of buyers that imple-
ment a sustainability policy is higher, producers have
fewer opportunities to avoid selling to those buy-
ers, potentially increasing producer costs of non-
compliance (Mayer and Gefi 2010, Garrett et al 2019).
If committed buyers source only a small proportion
of total regional production, only farmers who were
already ZDC compliant would have an incentive to
continue selling to those buyers, reducing the addi-
tionality of the company’s policy in the broader area
outside of its supply chain. Based on this logic we
hypothesize that deforestation reductions are larger
in areas where ZDC companies who implement their
commitments have a bigger collective market share.
2.2.3. ZDC coverage
ZDC coverage describes the spatial reach and level
of ZDC market share within the commodity pro-
duction areas. We hypothesize that within a region,
higher ZDC market share leads to greater avoided
deforestation, assuming ZDC implementation. For
example, a high ZDC market share in the Amazon
of around 90% (9 million tonnes (Mt)) means
that farmers in most soy production regions are
under pressure to meet the requirements of ZDC
firms. In comparison, the 45% (20 Mt) ZDC mar-
ket share in the Cerrado will leave more production
regions outside ZDC company sourcing. This lim-
its the potential impact of these companies’ policies
on conservation, if their policies were implemented
(Trase 2018, Zu Ermgassen et al 2020).
2.3. Data and approach
2.3.1. Soy company ZDCs
We derived all names of companies exporting soy-
beans from Brazil in 2018 from Trase (2020) and
researched whether and when these companies had
adopted or implemented a ZDC (table S1). By 2018,
only the SoyM in the Amazon had been implemen-
ted. Producers in violation of the SoyM were excluded
from supplying to committed companies. In the Cer-
rado, to our knowledge, no company has implemen-
ted their ZDC across their whole supply chain.
We derived company ZDC adoption and imple-
mentation status from corporate reports and online
information, Zu Ermgassen et al (2020), and in the
case of the SoyM the list of members of the Brazilian
national vegetable oil associations (Abiove 2020, Anec
2020). If we could not find a public record of a com-
pany’s intention to eliminate deforestation from their
supply chain, we assumed that the company did not
adopt a ZDC.
2.3.2. Comparing companies’ economic characteristics
and reputational risk exposure
We estimated company exposure to high deforest-
ation areas by measuring company exports from
(tonnes per year), and the number of soy storage and
processing facilities in, high deforestation areas. High
deforestation municipalities were defined separately
for the Amazon and Cerrado as those in the highest
10% quantile of PRODES deforestation rates between
2016 and 2018 (INPE 2018b).
To characterize company size, we obtained com-
pany tax reported share value (in 2018 Brazilian real
(BRL)) from the Brazilian Ministry of the Economy
(Ministério da Economia 2020), matching corporate
tax identifier (Cadastro Nacional de Pessoas Jurídicas
(CNPJ)) between the Trase (2020) and tax databases.
We derived soy sourcing volumes by company from
Trase (tonnes in 2018) (Trase 2020). The main export
locations of ZDC and non-ZDC traders were taken
from Trase in 2018 (Trase 2020).

Figure 1. Land use and land cover change in the states (two-letter labels) of the Brazilian Amazon (a) and Cerrado (b). Land use
and land cover change were derived from Mapbiomas (MapBiomas 2020). Forest, pasture, cropland, soy, and other categories
represent land in the year 2019. Forest is divided into areas suitable for soy and other forests. Soy-deforestation includes all forest
to soy conversion within 5 years post deforestation (SI §1, figure S2). Matopiba (right), includes the states of Maranhao (MA),
Tocantins (TO), Piaui (PI) and Bahia (BA).
We compared all indicators between ZDC and
non-ZDC companies using the Wilcoxon rank sign
test (Wilcoxon 1945).
2.3.3. ZDC coverage of forests suitable for soy
expansion and habitat of threatened, forest-dependent
species market share
We calculated ZDC market share as the export share
of annual soybean tonnes per municipality traded by
ZDC companies in 2018 (Trase 2020). We categor-
ized this market share into five bins, consisting of 0%,
>0%–25%, >25%–50%, >50%–75%, and >75%–
100% ZDC market share. Municipalities without soy-
bean and thus without market share were labeled ‘no
soy’ locations.
We then assessed the degree to which adop-
ted ZDCs cover forests and threatened forest-
dependent species’ habitat in areas suitable for soy-
bean production.
We defined soy-suitable areas as those with mod-
erate to high soy-suitability as derived from the
Global Agroecological Zoning assessment (agrocli-
matic soy-suitability derived for high-input, rain-
fed soybean production), slope <15%, and exclud-
ing soils with strong edaphic restriction (IIASA 2012,
Soares-Filho et al 2014). Then, we intersected soy
suitability with 2018 forest area derived from Map-
biomas (MapBiomas 2020) (figure 1). Finally, we
summarized soy-suitable forest area in each ZDC
market share bin.
We

forest-dependent species as the intersection of species

the Amazon and Cerrado (n = 249) and 2018 forest
area from Mapbiomas (MapBiomas 2020) (Huang
et al 2021). Next, we quantified the combined species
habitat area in all forests and those suitable for soy-
bean expansion. Finally, we calculated the percent of
the total summed species habitat area in soy-suitable
forests located in municipalities across ZDC market
share categories in 2018 (table 1).
2.3.4. Estimating ZDC treatment effect on
soy-deforestation
To evaluate the role of the collective, local lever-
age that companies with ZDCs have to reduce com-
modity deforestation, we assessed the effect of the
SoyM market share on direct soy-deforestation in
the Brazilian Amazon. We included all municipalit-
ies completely inside the Amazon biome with planted
soybeans throughout 2005 and 2015, resulting in 50
municipalities (figure S6).
We defined deforestation for soy as the area of
forest converted to soybeans within 5 years after
deforestation occurred. This 5 year soy-deforestation
attribution captured most conversion from forest to
soy in the Amazon between 2001 and 2018 within an
8 year observation period (SI §1, figures S1 and S2)
and aligns with prior studies that applied lags between
3 and 5 years (Gibbs et al 2015, Zu Ermgassen et al
2020, Song et al 2021). We derived forest and soy land
use from Mapbiomas and excluded forest regrowth
after 2000 (MapBiomas 2020).
Because SoyM market share was highly clustered
around 0% and 100% (figure S7), we considered

municipalities as treated once the SoyM market share
reached ⩾50% (figure S6). We tested thresholds
between >0% and ⩾75% and found the same treat-
ment timing and location for all except one municip-
ality (figure S7).
As counterfactuals to our treatment, we used soy-
producing municipalities in the Amazon that were
not-yet or never treated. By comparing municipalit-
ies within the same biome, we created treatment and
counterfactual groups subject to similar governance
and bioclimatic influences.
To estimate the effect of the SoyM on soy-
deforestation, i.e. the average treatment effect on
the treated (ATT), we estimated a difference-in-
differences (DiD) model with staggered treatment
adoption
(Callaway
and
Sant’Anna
2020).
We
weighted municipal level observations by municipal-
ity area to interpret the estimated ATT as the popula-
tion mean.
The DiD model assumed the treatment to be
staggered, irreversible, and binary, and all observa-
tions to be untreated in the first timesteps (Callaway
and Sant’Anna 2020). Most municipalities satis-
fied the staggered, irreversible treatment assump-
tion (i.e. remained treated after SoyM market share
reached 50% for the first time). Nevertheless, we
tested different definitions of the treatment and found
our results to be robust (see SI §3 and table S7).
We assume that the timing of treatment was exo-
genous, that spillovers across sampled municipality
outcome and treatment status were limited (i.e. the
stable unit treatment value assumption), and that
treated and counterfactual municipalities followed
parallel trends (see SI §3). We tested if our results were
affected by cross-municipality leakage (see SI §3).
2.3.5. Avoided soy-deforestation in the Amazon from
the SoyM
We estimated avoided direct soy-deforestation gener-
ated by the SoyM in the Amazon biome. To do so, we
applied the estimated average treatment effect (ATT)
of the SoyM on the treated municipalities (figure S9),
by calculating the difference between s, the expected
outcome without treatment, and s2, the outcome after
treatment (figure 2, SI §3).
2.3.6. Potentially avoided soy-deforestation in the
Cerrado from implementing existing soy ZDCs
In the Cerrado, we estimated potential avoided soy-
deforestation if all companies with adopted ZDCs
had implemented these commitments from 2006 to
2015 (table S1). We defined municipalities as treated
once ZDC market share reached ⩾50% (figure S11).
For those municipalities, once treated, we reduced
the observed soy deforestation based on the estim-
ated ATT from the SoyM. This assumes that effective-
ness of implementation in the Cerrado is equal to that
observed for the SoyM. Avoided soy-deforestation
was the difference between observed and ‘treated’
soy-deforestation (SI §4).
3. Results
3.1. ZDCs were rare amidst smaller soy companies
and were substantially lower in the Cerrado
Corporate ZDC adoption rates were greater in the
Amazon, where companies took part in the SoyM,
than in the Cerrado, as reported previously (Zu
Ermgassen et al 2020). In the Cerrado, only seven of
129 companies exporting soybeans had a ZDC, with
the first pledge made in 2014 (table S1). In 2018,
these seven companies controlled 66% of soy exports
from the Cerrado. In the Amazon, 16 of 46 soybean-
exporting companies adopted the SoyM, and they
handled 95% of 2018 exports.
On average, companies with higher share value,
greater sunk investments (e.g. storage, crushing, and
refining facilities), and higher soy export volumes
were more likely to adopt ZDCs (figures 3(a), (b),
(d)–(f) and (h)). Compared to non-ZDC traders,
those with ZDCs sourced more soy from municip-
alities with high deforestation rates (figures 3(c) and
(g)) and sourced from municipalities where most soy-
deforestation occurred (table 1, figure S4). There is

Violin shape and boxplot describe the distribution while points indicate the values of individual companies. P-values were

Economia 2020). Figures (b), (c), (f) and (g) refer to 2016–2018 (Trase 2019). Deforestation hotspots were defined as those
municipalities within the highest 10% quantile of annual deforestation (INPE 2018a, 2018b). Soy infrastructure includes
processing (P) and storage (S) facilities in total and within deforestation hotspots (d) and (h) (Trase 2018).
no evidence that commitment adoption is related
to headquarter location. Cerrado ZDC companies
have headquarters in Europe, North America, and
Brazil, while SoyM companies have headquarters
across many regions (table S1).
3.2. Adopted ZDCs in the Amazon and the Cerrado
covered less than half of the soy-suitable forested
areas
Adopted ZDCs covered less than half of the total
remaining forest area suitable for soy expansion,
overall and within only those municipalities with
planted soy in 2018. About 55% and 53% of the soy-
suitable forest in soy-producing municipalities in the
Amazon and Cerrado, respectively, was in municip-
alities where no company had a ZDC (table 1).
3.3. Biodiversity conservation would likely benefit
from ZDC implementation, but large habitat areas
lacked protection
Of all soy-suitable forest habitat areas, 48% in the
Amazon and 90% in the Cerrado were in municipal-
ities with soy production (table 1). If all soy-suitable
forests overlapping with the habitats of threatened
forest-dependent species (n = 249) were cleared, 19%
and 55% of these species’ habitat areas in the Amazon
and Cerrado, respectively, would be removed. Ten
species in the Amazon and three in the Cerrado
would go extinct if all soy-suitable forests were cleared
because their habitats fall only within these forests.
Municipalities with ZDC market share >50%
contained about 20% and 45% of threatened spe-
cies’ habitat areas within soy-suitable forests in the
Amazon and Cerrado, respectively (table 1). In the
Amazon, these species benefit from greater pro-
tection as a result of the implementation of the
SoyM (section 3.4), while in the Cerrado they would
only receive some protection from soy expansion if
currently adopted ZDCs are actually implemented
(section 3.5). Yet, even if adopted ZDCs in the Cer-
rado were implemented, not all at-risk areas would
be covered. Extensive threatened species’ habitat areas
(i.e. 29% in the Amazon and 43% in the Cerrado) are
in soy-producing municipalities with zero ZDC mar-
ket share (table 1).
3.4. SoyM signatories more than halved
soy-deforestation in the municipalities they source
from
Our DiD analysis found that the SoyM reduced dir-
ect soy-deforestation in treated municipalities by 57%
(95% confidence interval (CI): 31%–73%, table S2,
figure 4). Our results were robust against differ-
ent definitions of the counterfactual group (i.e. not-
yet and never treated municipalities), exclusion of
pre-SoyM years, and different treatment definitions
(tables S2(a)–(d), figures S8(a)–(d)). We found no

indication of leakage from treated to neighboring
municipalities (table S2(e), figure S8(e)).
Compared to a counterfactual where the SoyM
had never been implemented, the policy led to
230 993 ha (95% CI: 78 668–475 768 ha) or 53% (95%
CI: 28%–70%) of avoided soy-deforestation in the
Brazilian Amazon between 2006 and 2015 (figure S9).
This exceeds observed 2006–2015 soy-deforestation
(204 703 ha) but is only 1.6% of total observed
2006–2015 Amazon deforestation (14 547 858 ha,
figure S10).
3.5. ZDC implementation in the Cerrado could
have halved soy-deforestation
Had the seven companies that have adopted soy
ZDCs (table S1) implemented their commitments
in the Cerrado in 2006, they could have contrib-
uted an avoided 509 126 ha (95% CI: 278 622–
1115 087 ha) or 46% (95% CI: 24%–59%) of
direct soy-deforestation and around 5% of overall
deforestation between 2006 and 2015 (total observed
soy-deforestation: 1115 087 ha, total observed defor-
estation: 10 032 444 ha, figure S12).
4. Discussion
4.1. Large companies tend to adopt ZDCs, but
adoption does not always lead to implementation
ZDC adoption was greater among larger companies
with a higher fraction of total soy sourcing within
deforestation hotspots and more sunk infrastruc-
ture. Such companies face a high risk of being tar-
geted by civil society organization campaigns due
to their size, environmental impact, and investments
in deforestation-risk regions (Hendry 2006, Rueda
et al 2017). Other factors correlated with com-
pany size and influence may also be responsible for
observed differences. For instance, large companies
might benefit from economies of scale, increasing
the cost-effectiveness of implementation and mitig-
ating risks by trading several commodities (Grabs
and Carodenuto 2021). Since our analytical approach
was designed to assess differences between compan-
ies with and without ZDCs, further research inten-
ded to attribute causes of adoption via ethnographic
and/or statistical approaches is needed (Grabs and
Carodenuto 2021).
While consumer-oriented campaigns are thought
to have played a key role in incentivizing initial com-
mitments by such firms (Gibbs et al 2015, Alix-Garcia
and Gibbs 2017), such campaigns cannot target
every small firm. Currently proposed due diligence
or zero deforestation laws requiring compliance of
production with laws and regulations in exporting
regions may exclude small and medium-sized firms
(European Commission 2021).
Theory suggests that adoption of voluntary
policies by larger, more dominant firms can lead
to policy spillovers to smaller companies that decide
to imitate larger companies (Hendry 2006) to par-
ticipate in the zero-deforestation market. The SoyM
was supported by the two largest soy industry asso-
ciations in Brazil (Abiove 2020, Anec 2020), leading
to high ZDC adoption and implementation among
all industry association members in the Amazon
including smaller firms. However, ZDC adoption
and implementation has not spilled over to smaller
firms in the Cerrado biome. Instead ZDC adoption
in the Cerrado is even more skewed to the largest
firms (table S1). Such large companies are more
likely to have the resources needed to implement
their policies including more stable sourcing rela-
tions with producers that are favorable for policy dis-
semination (Leijten et al 2022). Yet, while they appear
well-positioned to make good on their commitments,
none of these companies have implemented their
Cerrado ZDCs along their full supply chain.
Although prior studies found a link between the
adoption of the SoyM, and trade regulations on
genetically modified soy, to be associated with exports
to the EU (Garrett et al 2013, Nolte et al 2017),
we found that export locations in 2018 were sim-
ilar between ZDC and non-ZDC companies. The
decreasing proportion of exports going to the EU
since the SoyM was adopted may have diminished the
influence of EU consumer preferences on compan-
ies’ incentives to implement new soy ZDCs (table S1).
In 2018, Asian markets dominated soy export destin-
ations, while Europe was the second largest export
market (figure S5). Yet, none of the companies that
adopted ZDCs in the Cerrado have their headquar-
ters in Asia, which suggests lower consumer demand

F Gollnow et al
for ‘environmentally-friendly’ soy and/or less non-
governmnetal organization (NGO) presence in those
countries to pressure companies into greater ZDC
action. Another potential explanation for the lack
of implementation in the Cerrado compared to the
Amazon is that there were fewer firms present in the
Amazon during the initial SoyM adoption and imple-
mentation period in comparison to the highly com-
petitive market for soy trading in the Cerrado. NGOs
directed significant pressure at individual firms with
follow-up reporting on deforestation within these
firms’ supply chains (Greenpeace 2006). Naming and
shaming campaigns have been less visible in the Cer-
rado. This lack of pressure from civil society did not
encourage prompt action by firms. Finally, the polit-
ical context has significantly changed since the SoyM
under the conservative Bolsonaro presidency, which
has bolstered efforts to reduce, rather than expand,
deforestation control (de Area Le˜ao Pereira et al 2020,
Garrett et al 2021).
4.2. Limited ZDC coverage for soy-suitable forests
and forest-dependent species habitat
We found that more than half of soy-suitable forests
and forest-dependent species habitats in the Brazilian
Amazon and Cerrado are in municipalities without
meaningful ZDC market shares, resulting in a major
conservation gap. Particularly in the Cerrado, where
public policies restrict clearing on only 20%–35% of
a private property (NVP 2012), soy-suitable forests
outside ZDC sourcing regions would remain vulner-
able to soy-deforestation even if ZDC companies were
to implement their pledges. In the Amazon, stronger
public policies (e.g. restricting clearing on 50%–80%
of private properties (NVP 2012)), and limited access-
ibility may reduce the risk of soy-deforestation even
if many areas lack ZDC presence (figure 1). Our res-
ults emphasize the concern that because supply chain
governance is a constraint only to those producers
within specific ZDC supply chains and does not cover
all commodities, its ability to meet conservation goals
across landscapes and large regions is limited.
4.3. The SoyM reduced deforestation, but it is
contribution to avoided deforestation in Brazil has
been small
While our finding that the SoyM led to a 57%
reduction of soy-deforestation in treated municip-
alities confirms that ZDCs have effectively reduced
forest loss from soybean expansion in the Amazon,
the impact of the SoyM on overall deforestation in
Brazil, across commodities and regions, appears lim-
ited. The 57% reduction translated to an avoided
26 666 ha yr−1, or just 1.6% of overall Amazon
deforestation over the study period. Moreover, while
we found no evidence of cross-municipality leak-
age in our sample municipalities in the Amazon
(table S2, figure S8(e)), leakage may have occurred
to municipalities that did not produce soy in
2005, other Brazilian biomes, or other countries
(Villoria et al 2022, Gibbs et al 2015, Noojipady et al
2017, Dou et al 2018, Kuschnig et al 2021). Thus,
our findings serve as an upper-bound estimate of the
SoyM’s contribution to reducing (soy-)deforestation
in Brazil.
Yet, our estimate of avoided deforestation is much
lower than the only previous counterfactual-based
assessment by Heilmayr et al (2020), who estimated
that the SoyM reduced overall Amazon biome defor-
estation by 1800 000 ha (95% CI: ±90 000) or 35%
(95% CI: ±16) between 2006 and 2016.
Several methodological differences help explain
differing findings. We estimated the impacts of the
SoyM only in municipalities with high ZDC mar-
ket share. In contrast, Heilmayr et al (2020) assumed
that the SoyM applied to all soy-suitable areas in
the Amazon, including those without SoyM com-
pany presence. Our approach therefore reduced the
potentially affected area to those areas where SoyM
signatories could directly impact producers’ defor-
estation practices. Second, while our outcome vari-
able was soy-deforestation, Heilmayr et al (2020) used
overall deforestation, which likely includes non-soy
deforestation (e.g. forest clearance for cattle ranch-
ing). Finally, Heilmayr et al (2020) applied a triple
DiD estimator, comparing pre and post-SoyM imple-
mentation, soy-suitable and not-suitable locations,
and Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Our DiD estim-
ator instead compared pre and post-treatment and
treated versus not-yet-treated municipalities in the
Amazon biome. This allowed us to avoid potentially
confounding effects between the Amazon and Cer-
rado biomes driven by different environmental laws,
monitoring and enforcement as part of implementa-
tion, and deforestation leakage.
Thus, compared to Heilmayr et al (2020), our
approach likely has greater internal validity, or a more
trustworthy cause and effect relationship between
ZDC implementation and soy-deforestation reduc-
tions in Amazon soy-producing municipalities. Yet,
our estimates may suffer from lower external validity
because they cannot capture deforestation processes
outside of soy-producing municipalities. We caution
generalizing our findings to different social, environ-
mental, and governance settings.
4.4. Implementation of current ZDCs in the
Cerrado may conserve less forest than previously
estimated
Our results suggest that had companies with an adop-
ted ZDC in the Cerrado implemented their commit-
ments with the same effectiveness as the SoyM, they
could have halved observed soy-deforestation in the
biome between 2006 and 2015. This estimate assumes
that the implementation of ZDCs in the Cerrado
would have had the same effect on soy-deforestation
as the SoyM, a strong assumption given that the SoyM
is supported among more companies, restricted to
9

Environ. Res. Lett. 17 (2022) 114003
F Gollnow et al
a comparably small area (Rausch and Gibbs 2021),
and located in a region with stricter environmental
laws (NVP 2012), providing synergies in monitoring
and enforcement of the commitment (Lambin et al
2014, Garrett et al 2019). At the same time, the Cer-
rado faced high pressure for soy expansion, possibly
in part due to displaced demand from the Amazon
because of SoyM implementation (Noojipady et al
2017, Rausch et al 2019). Some research suggests
that the SoyM induced additional deforestation in
the Cerrado and other regions outside Brazil (Villoria
et al 2022, Noojipady et al 2017). Yet, availability of
already cleared land highly suitable for soy produc-
tion in the Cerrado could have absorbed some of the
displaced demand, allowing soy expansion without
additional deforestation (Nepstad et al 2019, Rausch
et al 2019).
Thus, our estimate is likely the upper bound of
the potential impact of implementing adopted ZDCs
in the Cerrado. Yet, our projected reduction in Cer-
rado soy-deforestation (50 913 ha yr−1) based on
the implementation of currently adopted ZDCs and
the market share of companies with adopted ZDCs
(figure S11, table S1) is only half of the avoided
deforestation estimated by Soterroni et al (2019)
(120 000 ha yr−1) who assumed that all companies
would adopt and implement a ZDC. Our approach,
incorporating the municipal ZDC market share into
estimating ZDCs’ potential impact, thus provides a
more plausible best-case estimate of the likely conser-
vation benefits of currently adopted ZDCs in the Cer-
rado. Indeed, deforestation leakage from the Cerrado
to other biomes and countries may still reduce the
impact of these ZDCs on global avoided deforestation
(Villoria et al 2022).
5. Conclusion
Supply chain sustainability policies are prominent
in global food system governance discussions. Using
new spatially and temporally explicit data on soy
company sourcing locations and land use in the
Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado biomes, we explored
factors that are associated with ZDC adoption, and
how spatial and temporally heterogeneous ZDC
adoption and implementation may contribute to con-
servation goals. We empirically tested how incom-
plete ZDC market coverage, measured as the collect-
ive regional market share of companies with adopted
ZDCs, affected soy-deforestation in the Amazon, and
how it could constrain conservation benefits from
implementing existing ZDCs in the Cerrado. Yet,
variable adoption and implementation across com-
panies and space leave many places exposed to soy
buyers without ZDCs. The lack of ZDC implementa-
tion and the low adoption by small and medium firms
in the Cerrado restricts the potential impact of ZDCs
in this highly threatened biome.
Our analysis confirms that implementation of
corporate ZDCs can reduce commodity deforestation
in places where these companies have substantial
market share. We expect that this general mech-
anism will hold true across commodities and geo-
graphies, yet local levels of ZDC effectiveness depend
upon implementation approaches, supply chain
and market structure, and complementary public
environmental policies. For example, unlike soy, a
capital-intensive activity where producers mostly
sell directly to trading companies, cattle, oil palm,
and cocoa supply chains are commonly multi-tier
(Lyons-White and Knight 2018, Grabs et al 2021,
Cammelli et al 2022, Levy et al 2022). This increases
the complexity of supply chain monitoring, which
may, for example, provide additional opportunities
for laundering if not all indirect suppliers are mon-
itored. Moreover, the risk of exacerbating precarious
supplier livelihoods and pushing producers to local
leakage markets may be greater in other supply chains
(Lyons-White et al 2020, Grabs et al 2021). This could
make ZDC impacts on deforestation for a given mar-
ket share substantially lower than has occurred in the
Brazilian Amazon for soy. Measuring these relation-
ships across commodities requires further scientific
attention.
Our results also point to current limitations of
supply chain governance. If supply chain policies
intend to contribute to the task of tackling defor-
estation in Brazil, it is crucial to expand zero-
deforestation supply chain policies beyond soy.
Recent commitments to eliminate deforestation from
the cattle supply chain in the Brazilian Amazon
have been promising, but the lack of monitoring of
indirect suppliers, the narrow focus on the Amazon
biome, and limited adoption by smaller slaughter-
houses undermined their contribution to reducing
deforestation (Alix-Garcia and Gibbs 2017, Klingler
et al 2018, Levy et al 2022). Due-diligence zero-
deforestation and other forest-focused trade reg-
ulations, as proposed by the European Commis-
sion (Kehoe et al 2019, Bager et al 2020, European
Commission 2021) could target more compan-
ies independent of their size and public exposure,
include all forest risk commodities, and cover all
regions. However, supply chain governance should
not be understood as a substitute for state-led
forest policies, which are critical to enable zero-
deforestation monitoring and enforcement, have bet-
ter potential to cover multiple types of commodities,
land users, and regions, and may thereby be better
positioned to mitigate leakage (Garrett et al 2019,
Sellare et al 2022).
