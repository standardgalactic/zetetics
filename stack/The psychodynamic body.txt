Abstract 
 
This thesis is an exploration of the psychodynamic body and its mythos.  I take a 
phenomenological approach to research that remains connected to lived experience.  I 
begin with image making, painting from the subjective body in response to the ancient 
Mesopotamian myth of the flood and archaic cultural material on the flood theme.  I 
discover a relationship between this imagery, this mythos, and earlier work on the 
Dionysian mythology and mysteries.  I gather these images together and with work on 
my own family history I create a painting performance titled Wings from the Deep.   The 
mythos, the poetic structure, of this performance and this thesis, is an exploration of how 
a people, a person, a body, can journey through traumatic states.  The core phenomenon 
of this thesis is the psychodynamic movement from deadness to aliveness, a movement at 
the heart of the psychotherapeutic process.  I apply knowledge of the psychotherapeutic 
conversation to the research process by writing to an important other, Etty Hillesum, a 
young Dutch Jewish woman who wrote a series of diaries during the Holocaust.  I then 
link this conversation with my earlier imagery and the images of the Holocaust to the 
biblical myth of the flood.  This linking of somatic states to mythic material through 
imagery and text is how I develop the poetic language integral to this thesis.  I create a 
constant dialogue from body to image to word, a process, a language, that mirrors 
psychotherapy.  The psychodynamic body structures the mythos of this thesis.  The 
psychodynamic body structures a mythos of psychotherapy. 
 

25
Prologue 
 
 
The primary philosophical approach in this thesis is phenomenology.  I remain 
with embodied experience, with inner necessity, inner momentum.  To express this I 
develop a particular linguistic structure for the thesis writing: poetics.  I not only speak 
with the language of image and worded image but I show the reader how this language 
came into being.  It is through this expression of the creation of language that I come to 
the core meaning of the thesis.  The core phenomenon is psychodynamic movement.  
Embodied psychodynamic movement.  The movement from deadness to aliveness.  The 
creation and presentation of the painting performance Wings from the Deep was an active 
and embodied immersion in this psychodynamic movement, this poetry.  In this way it 
became the foundation for the thesis.   
 
Phenomenology is a return to things as they are, as they appear to the 
consciousness that both creates and observes them.  In this way experience, ie. 
imagination and memory, is deepened, and essential structures are revealed.  It is an 
intuitive process of discovering meaning, an approach that aims to reach beyond the 
traditional subject-object dichotomy (Brooke, 2000, p.3).  Phenomenology and 
psychodynamic psychology are approaches that can work together to recover the 
thinking, feeling and living body in this  “therapeutics of humanity’s modern 
psychological life” (Romanyshyn, 1991, p. xiv). 
 
 
 This is my philosophical position.  I remain with lived experience, with the flow 
of the subjective inner world.  A world brought into being in relationship to the body.  In 
this way I remain with the body’s experience.  I immerse myself in the psychodynamic 
body and its movement.  I discover the body’s language, an imagistic poetic language. 
 
It is a disciplined process.  
...the poet’s imagination is an attempt to see accurately what is there and to find 
precisely the right words to speak what is seen.  Poetic work is both disciplined 
and committed to accuracy.  (Brooke, 1991, p. 8) 

26
The style of writing in this thesis was inspired by authors like Anne Michaels.  
Fugitive Pieces (1997), her first novel, was written with a poet’s sensitivity to language.  
Michaels’ previous books were both award winning collections of poetry, imagistically 
complex and emotively rich.  My experience of poetry and of Michaels’ writing in 
Fugitive Pieces is that it follows psyche, it follows the structure of the internal world.  
The punctuation emphasises sound, timing, imagery and emotion.  This is how I have 
used punctuation in this thesis.  I have attempted to construct a psycho-poetic language.  
A language elaborated by Russell Meares.  
 
‘Inner speech is not the interior aspect of external speech – it is a function of 
itself’.  It is often lacking the grammar of ordinary communicative language.  It is 
condensed, makes jumps, and moves capriciously according to association and 
analogies.  Indeed at times the condensations are such that both Piaget and 
Vygotsky remark that it is incomprehensible.  This led Vygotsky to conclude that 
its purpose was not communicative. 
…We might suppose that this curious, non-linear form of language has the 
purpose of representing and so bringing into being, the sense of self… 
 
The two main forms of human language described here are found in pure 
form only in unusual circumstances.  One, which might be called the language of 
adaption, is linear.  It is shown, undiluted, in legal and political documents.  The 
other, which concerns self, is non-linear and found, relatively pristine, in certain 
kinds of poetry.  The habitual use of the language of adaption can be understood 
as a manifestation of alienation, whereas the sense of self is manifest in a 
language having something of the form of Vygotsky’s ‘inner speech’. 
 
(Meares, 2000, p. 25) 
 
This thesis is constructed from the language of the inner world, ‘inner speech’, 
poetry, a language of movement.  In 1890 philosopher William James in his book 
Principles of Psychology described this inner movement as a “stream of consciousness”.  
Writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were aware of this insightful 
formulation of the inner life, and in 1918 May Sinclair referred to Pilgrimage a series of 

27
novels by Dorothy Richardson as a ‘stream of consciousness’ text.  Richardson’s 
particular approach to imagery in language has inspired many modern day writers 
including Jonathan Coe who writes that: 
...the rhythms of Richardson’s prose are unique...as a critic for the avant garde 
film magazine Close Up, she was acutely sensitive to the potency of the moving 
image, and much of the descriptive writing in Pilgrimage consists of flickering, 
transient, seemingly random images, cut together to form montages that somehow 
carry an unexpected rightness.  (Coe, 2007, p. 13) 
 
Philosopher and psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva also looks back to this fertile time in 
history through her work on ‘poetic language’.  She analyses turn of the century texts in 
order to create her own textual form.  Her main argument in Revolution in Poetic 
Language is “that the nineteenth-century post-Symbolist avant-garde effected a real 
mutation in literary “representation”” (Roudiez, 1984, p. 1).  Like Meares, Kristeva sees 
poetic language as a language free of external constraints, a language with the potential to 
be uniquely individual. 
 
 
The language I have created for this thesis, is, I believe, a contemporary version 
of this poetic avant-garde form.  The form is vital.  The written form expresses the 
phenomenon of the inner world.  The relationship to theory follows this form and has 
been made through the internal world.  I have made associative links to the images and 
worded imagery of the theorists.  The theorists are not only theorists in the obvious sense 
of the word, they are also artists and writers.  The images and textual imagery express 
theory in a subtle way within this poetic structure.  
 
At its core the structure of the inner world is movement.  Movement from one 
psychic state to another.  States felt through the body and in response to our “current 
interpersonal relationships” (Meares, 2000, p.11).  It must be said that this thesis, all its 
imaginings, experiences and internal workings were held in relationship.  The 
psychodynamic body that I describe in images and words, is a body in relationship.  I was 
held by conversations with my analysts and supervisors in a large relational and 

28
analytically oriented field.  I brought traumatic states into this relational field.  This is 
why I could move through them.  Trauma moves in and through relationship.  
 
I express this movement, this embodied movement in the theatre performance 
Wings from the Deep.  I express the movement of the psychodynamic body in the 
improvised gestural painting.  At its core it is a movement from death to life.  I return 
again and again throughout the thesis to Meares and his comment that:  
The heart of the matter...is deadness and aliveness.  Above all, the therapeutic aim 
is to develop a form of conversation in which ‘aliveness’ emerges out of 
deadness.  What is required is a form of language, resembling the artistic process 
as Susanne Langer defined it, which strives towards the finding of ‘expressive 
forms to present ideas of feeling’.  (Meares, 2000, p. 145) 
 
 
In the thesis I have attempted to show how a poetic form comes into being 
through the psychotherapeutic experience.  I invite the reader to discover how poetry is 
constructed.  I show the aliveness of the psychodynamic process, working through the 
impassioned body to intellectual reflection3.  Consciousness coming into being in this 
poetic form is ‘aliveness from deadness’. 
 
Myths are creation stories.  Mythos is thinking in images.  A myth, a mythos, is a 
narrative of creation, in images.  A poetic form.  Every individual psychotherapy is a 
creation story: a mythos.  Poetry, mythos, contains the profound notion, by its very 
structure, of the movement from death into life.  This is why this movement is at the core 
of this thesis.  Sigmund Freud “looks upon Eros and Death as two primal powers, as 
cosmological not just psychological energies...engaged in a dramatic struggle with one 
another and sometimes in so close an embrace that we cannot distinguish between them”  
(Downing, 2000, p. 70).  The core movement of a mythos of psychotherapy is death into 
life.  An embodied psychodynamic, a poetry of lived psychic reality.

Introduction  
 
The psychodynamic body is a psychologically alive body.  A body that is 
engaging with its own personal and cultural imagination.   In my own research I have 
found that to engage with the psychodynamic body is to enter a cyclical dynamic the 
body has known for thousands of years.  For me, in my contemporary female body, the 
cycle begins with aliveness and journeys through states of deadness and madness to 
rediscover aliveness again.  
 
In psychodynamic psychology one’s own psychological body, or psyche, is 
depended upon as the tool for understanding.  It is a qualitative, individual and 
introverted approach to thinking psychologically.  Carl Jung, one of the founders of this 
approach, created the foundations of his ideas during a period Henri Ellenberger (1970) 
terms his ‘creative illness’. 
 
It occurs in various settings and is to be found among shamans, among the 
mystics of various religions, in certain philosophers and creative writers…A 
creative illness succeeds a period of intense preoccupation with an idea and search 
for a certain truth.  It is a polymorphous condition that can take the shape of 
depression, neurosis, psychosomatic ailments, or even psychosis.  Whatever the 
symptoms, they are felt as painful, if not agonizing, by the subject, with 
alternating periods of alleviation and worsening…He suffers from feelings of 
utter isolation, even when he has a mentor who guides him through the 
ordeal…The termination is often rapid and marked by a phase of exhilaration.  
The subject emerges from his ordeal with a permanent transformation in his 
personality and the conviction that he has discovered a great truth or a new 
spiritual world.  (pp. 447-448) 
 
From 1913 to 1919 was a deeply introverted time in Jung’s life.  One in which he 
used every possible avenue to begin to think about what was happening within his own 
psyche.  Imagery was central to his research.  We see this in his own artworks,  
 

30

his dream images and the interior images of himself.  The conversations he was able to 
create between his different inner selves was crucial at this time.  He discovered layers 
within his own psyche, each with it’s own inherent logic. 
Jung resorted to the technique of provoking the upsurge of unconscious imagery 
and its overflowing into consciousness by two means: first by writing down and 
drawing his dreams every morning, and second by telling himself stories and 
forcing himself to prolong them by writing down everything that his unfettered 
imagination could dictate…At first he directed his daydreams by fancying that he 
was digging into the earth and into underground galleries and caves, where he 
encountered all kinds of weird figures…In the subterranean world where his 
fantasies now led him he met the figure of the old man, Elias with a young blind 
woman, Salome, and later a wise and learned man, Philemon.  By conversing with 
Philemon, Jung learned that man can teach himself things of which he is not 
aware.  (Ellenberger, 1970, p. 671) 
 

31
The metaphor of Archaeology is useful here.  Archaeology interprets history 
through layers.  Each layer is recognised as a different developmental stage in our 
collective history.  A particular place may have hundreds of discreet layers each with its 
own mythology and belief structure.  A psyche is like this.   
 
In “Constructions in Analysis” Freud draws a parallel between the work of the 
analyst and the archaeologist. 
 
The two processes are in fact identical, except that the analyst works under better 
conditions and has more material at his command to assist him, since what he is 
dealing with is not something destroyed but something that is still alive…But just 
as the archaeologist builds up the walls of a building from the foundations that 
have remained standing, determines the number and position of the columns from 
depressions in the floor, and reconstructs the mural decorations and paintings 
from the remains found in the debris, so does the analyst proceed when he draws 
his inferences from fragments of memories, from the associations and from the 
behaviour of the subject of the analysis. 
(as cited in Kuspit, 1989, p. 138) 
 
Similarly, I have been the archaeologist of my own psyche, engaging different 
research methods for different layers.  This has included a strong focus on imagery in the 
early phases of my research, to reach instinctive layers of experience.  And the use of the 
conversation with significant others, real and imaginary, in the later phases, to discover 
and express the structures of my thinking.   
 
One significant other in my research has been Etty Hillesum, a young Dutch 
Jewess who wrote a compelling series of diaries of her experience during the Holocaust.  
As I read her diaries, and learnt of her life and loves, I was able to write back to her, 
much like Jung wrote to fantasy figures in his imagination.   
 

32
In October 1942 during a brief period of leave to Amsterdam she writes this about 
her experience at Westerbork Camp: 
At night, as I lay in the camp on my plank bed, surrounded by women and girls 
gently snoring, dreaming aloud, quietly sobbing and tossing and turning, women 
and girls who often told me during the day, ‘We don’t want to think, we don’t 
want to feel, otherwise we are sure to go out of our minds,’ I was sometimes filled 
with an infinite tenderness, and lay awake for hours letting all the many, too many 
impressions of a much too long day wash over me, and I prayed, ‘Let me be the 
thinking heart of these barracks.’  And that is what I want to be again.  The 
thinking heart of a whole concentration camp. (Hillesum, 1981/1983, p. 191) 
 
Through my conversation with Etty I discovered the ‘thinking heart’, alive in the 
midst of a ‘whole concentration camp’.  Alive in the midst of profound trauma.  Thinking 
heart.  It was through our written conversation that I discovered the patterning of my own 
feelings and thoughts and was able to write this thesis. 
 
The conversation is the tool of psychodynamic psychology.  The conversation is a 
creative form.  It is through the conversation that a patient is transformed.   
 
This conversation is carefully constructed.  It exists within a formal structure of 
relationship.  It has rules and boundaries.  It is contained.  It is regularly maintained and 
sustained.  The therapist is empathic, careful, and observant.  The focus is the internal 
world of imagery and feelings, the flow of self.  The conversation occurs between two 
people, two bodies, and includes words, silences, emotions, images, projections, 
introjections and many other psychological states of communication and transformation.  
Everything that occurs between these two people is vital information about the client’s 
psychology and process.  The unseen past makes itself known in the present 
conversation.  It can have the quality of an archaeological project.  The therapist and the 
client together uncover layers of the psyche.  Within these layers can be monstrous 
creations as well as previously undiscovered gems. 

33
Anne Michaels in her poetic writing about the life of Holocaust survivor Jakob 
Beer describes a scene where Jakob the seven-year-old emerges from the mud of an 
archaeological dig where he has been hiding from the Nazis.  He reveals himself to a 
Greek archaeologist who would become his saviour. 
 
A grey fall day.  At the end of strength, at the place where faith is most like 
despair, I leaped from the streets of Biskupin; from underground into air. 
I limped towards him, stiff as a golem, clay tight behind my knees.  I 
stopped a few yards from where he was digging – later he told me it was as if I’d 
hit a glass door, an inarguable surface of pure air – “and your mud mask cracked 
with tears and I knew you were human, just a child, crying with the abandonment 
of your age.” 
He said he spoke to me.  But I was wild with deafness.  My peat-clogged 
ears.   
So hungry.  I screamed into the silence the only phrase I knew in more 
than one language, I screamed it in Polish and German and Yiddish, thumping my 
fists on my own chest: dirty Jew, dirty Jew, dirty Jew.  
(Michaels, 1997, pp. 12-13) 
 
This image of Jakob emerging from the mud of the archaeological dig at Biskupin is a 
deeply evocative image.  Something like the images that emerge in the therapeutic 
conversation.   
 
Throughout his creative illness Jung maintained a constant engagement in clinical 
work, as have I.  During such a sensitised period of self analysis and learning the 
therapist may become deeply affected by their clients.  While in my doctoral research I  
struggled to find a connection to life midst the debris of the Holocaust, the psychological 
struggles in my clinical practice were life and death.  Psychological aliveness was a 
crucial goal.   

34
The heart of the matter…is deadness and aliveness.  Above all, the therapeutic 
aim is to develop a form of conversation in which ‘aliveness’ emerges out of 
deadness. (Meares, 2000, p. 145) 
 
 
This necessary compulsion of the psychotherapist towards ‘aliveness’ is not new.  
Meares’ insight has an ancient foundation.  In Neolithic imagery and ritual a similar 
process occurs.  In the Neolithic shrine at Çatal Hüyük for example, there are strong 
images of birth, death and renewal. 
 
 
Figure 2. Grace Huxtable. Shrine at Çatal Hüyük 
 
Artist and Archaeologist Dorothy Cameron (1981) describes the symbolic 
meaning of the imagery as she sees it: 
In this shrine we see a vivid example of the Neolithic concept of the continuous 
life cycle, the symbols of life and death juxtaposed in a remarkable way.  Life (or 
birth) is symbolised by the bull’s head (the uterus) decorated with the zig-zag 
‘water of life’ motif, standing impressively over the head of the dead person, the 
sweeping horns indicating the breast which awaits the succouring of the new 
birth.  On the north wall is the vulture with human legs (presumably, as Mellart 
says, representing the priestesses dressed as vultures for the performance of the 

35
funerary rite) and along the lower walls are the triangles, again in black (death) 
and red (life), so intertwined as to need no interpretation…This shrine is indeed 
an impressive example of a symbiotic religious belief expressed in forceful 
symbols. (p. 30) 
 
This was a contained space, a focused ritual space, where transformation was 
structured by imagery.  What happens now in the psychotherapy room inside the 
individual psyche of the client, was happening then in the group.  There is a Greek term 
for this collective thinking in images: mythos.   
 
The historical psychologist thus had to proceed like a linguist in order to 
understand how thought was generated and developed within a collective.  This 
was true for all kinds of thought, but comparatively easy to discern in myth, seen 
as a kind of language composed of narrative details. (Von Reden, 1999, p. 59)  
 
Mythos is the kind of thinking which has formed the great mythologies of the 
world.  Each place and people has a creation story, a mythos.  For the researching of this 
thesis, I chose a myth.  As an artist I had worked with myth before and had found that it 
created a structure for the instinctive process I engaged in through my art making.  From 
the very beginning I immersed myself in the flood myth, allowing its inherent archetypal 
structures to inform the process of this thesis.   
 
This is an excerpt from The Epic of Gilgamesh of ancient Mesopotamia: 
 
 
 
The Story of the Flood... 
 
 
Utanapishtim spoke to Gilgamesh, saying: 
 
 
 
I will reveal to you, Gilgamesh, a thing that is hidden, 
a secret of the gods I will tell you!... 
 
 
The hearts of the Great Gods moved them to inflict the Flood. 
Their father Anu uttered the oath (of secrecy)... 

36
Ea, the clever Prince...was under oath with them  
so he repeated their talk to the reed house: 
 
‘Reed house, reed house! Wall, wall! 
 
Hear, O reed house! Understand, O wall! 
 
O man of Shuruppak, son of Ubartutu: 
 
 
 
Tear down the house and build a boat! 
 
 
 
Abandon wealth and seek living beings! 
 
 
 
Spurn possessions and keep alive living beings! 
 
 
 
Make all living beings go up into the boat. 
 
 
 
The boat which you are to build, 
 
 
 
its dimensions must measure equal to each other: 
 
 
 
its length must correspond to its width. 
 
 
 
(Kovacs, 2000, pp. 97-98) 
 
Through working with this ancient myth, this archaeological fragment dug up 
from the past, I was hoping to reconstruct, recycle and construct new life.   
 
The artist is used to engaging with a subject and allowing images to flow in 
response to that material.  For this reason a group of artists4 were invited by the Institute 
of Archaeomythology5 to work with the flood myth and present a performance to the 
International Symposium on the Interdisciplinary Significance of the Black Sea Flood, c. 
6700 BC. held at the Liguria Study Centre, Bogliasco Italy, in 2002.  Many of my initial 
flood paintings were a result of that collaboration.   
 
                                                
4 Collaborators on this project titled Dreaming the Deep included: Jungian Analyst and Singer Glenda 
Cloughley, Dancer and Choreographer Elizabeth Dalman Cameron, Artist Peter Cameron, Dancer Niki 
Shepherd, Dancer Vivienne Rogis, Artist Mary Murray, Dancer Peter Camarotto and Artist Anna Hueneke.  
The purpose of the project was to explore “...the notion that some of the Western equivalents to Australian 
Aboriginal dreamings...have been ‘forgotten’ – and also that they can be remembered...a task for singers, 
dancers and painters...”  (quote from Symposium Abstracts). 
5 “Archaeomythology is an interdisciplinary approach to scholarship formulated by archaeologist Marija 
Gimbutas for the purpose of expanding the parameters of the study and understanding of the 
multidimensional fabric of human cultures. Special emphasis is placed upon the beliefs, rituals, symbolism, 
social structure, and systems of communication of prehistoric societies.”  Quote from Institute of 
Archaeomythology website, December, 2007: http://www.archaeomythology.org/about/about.html.

Figure 3 arose out of work on the birds in the flood myth, the raven and the dove, 
and particularly in response to a Neolithic image spoken of by Cameron about a white 
bird being the eye of a flock of black6.  White bird, eye of a flock of black.  Death into 
life.

The Institute of Archaeomythology also granted me the opportunity of painting 
throughout the symposium in response to the scholars work.  As artist-in-residence I was 
able to stay immersed in an imagistic mind while the scholars presented from a place of 
cultural depth.  This process generated many images which I believe represent something 
of the archaic mind/body.  The images are presented throughout the thesis.

Figure 4. (below), was painted during dramatic circumstances.  The wooden room 
that housed the symposium was built on the edge of a cliff beside the sea.  In the middle 
of the symposium, the scholars entered into a heated debate.  At that same moment a 
storm erupted outside and the sea became dark and heaving.  Whereas I normally painted 
at a small table in the room with the scholars, for this event I went outside unrolled a very 
large piece of paper and painted Bird from the Sea in the heavy rain.

With these images as foundation I was able to begin work on Wings from the 
Deep7 a personal interpretation of the flood mythos.   
 
                                                
7 At the beginning of 2003 I obtained funding from ArtsACT “to assist with the costs of developing Wings 
from the Flood, a cross art performance work in 2003” (excerpt from funding application).  I later retitled 
the performance Wings from the Deep.  I worked on this project with several well known Canberra artists 
(listed on page 109 at the beginning of the included script).  By coincidence, as I began this work, I came to 
know of the conference Re-creating the World.  The Transformative Power of Arts and Play in 
Psychotherapy hosted by the Society for C. G. Jung, Bulgaria, held in September 2003.  With additional 
funding from the University of Western Sydney I was able to attend.  This focused the creative work 
towards the audience of the conference: artists, psychotherapists and Jungian analysts who work with the 
arts.  

39
The word mythos was a technical term in classical Greek for the plot of a tragedy 
or comedy (Aristotle, Poetics...).  This usage probably goes back to the time when 
these art-forms were wholly religious: the mythos or hieros logos was a sacred 
story involving the gods, and the drama (from drao, do, act) was the ritual 
enactment of the story, each being necessary to the other and to the whole 
production.  (Brown, 1971/1976, pp. 643-4)   
 
 
In order to research the flood myth I went to my studio.  The artist’s studio is 
another contained space where imagery and feelings are the focus.  Where any material is 
acceptable in the creation process.  As an artist I always begin with the body, the 
psychodynamic body.  I go to my studio.  I shut the door.  I set up the space.  A large 
blank sheet of paper, a big empty space, big enough to hold whatever somatic material I 
wish to express.  Then I mix the paint.  It too becomes somatic material.  The colours 
become different meanings as I paint.  The feeling though is that they come directly out 
of bodily states.  These are some: blue as water or tears, white as salt, lightness, clean-
ness or bone, black as death or darkness, red as blood, anger or fire and an earth colour as 
sand or skin.  A somatically related palette.   
 
Then I would paint whatever had compelled me to enter the studio, whatever I 
was feeling in my body.  What I discovered in the research paintings for Wings from the 
Deep is that my imagery depicted a cyclical dynamic from war and oppression to strength 
and ascension (Figure 5); an ancestral experience passed on from one generation to 
another through the body.  I gathered enough images to begin to structure a painting 
performance.

The performance space, like my studio, is a contained space.  In this case it is the 
marble foyer of an ancient monastery built beside the Black Sea in Bulgaria.  The 
audience is an international group of artists, analysts and psychotherapists who work with 
the arts.  It is an audience who understands the subject matter of the performance and 
who are used to being presented with a series of images as a communication of 
experience.  A flow of imagery is considered by the therapist to be an expression of self.

I painted on a large piece of paper on the floor while a soundtrack, which included quotes 
from the flood myth, from analysts and artists, as well as music, song and voice played.  I 
also showed other artists work on a screen behind me as I painted (Figure 7).

Becoming a psychotherapist, as it was for Jung and Freud, is a journey through 
the darkness of one’s own psyche.  This personal journey inevitably leads to its cultural 
context, the collective.  To become immersed in a myth, a mythos, is to enter a collective 
form.  By engaging with the flood myth I became engaged with the collective experience 
of my heritage.  At an imagistic and instinctive level I was engaging with the Holocaust. 
 
In a psychological sense, I grew up in a war-zone.  I spent much of my childhood 
swapping between the house of my mother, a Russian Jewish immigrant, and the house of 
my father, a German immigrant.  For both my parents there is a conspicuous dissociation 
from the Holocaust.  My mother’s family completely cut off from the Sydney Jewish 

42
community and their own Jewish identity during the Holocaust.  For my father the 
Holocaust does not exist because he cannot look at it.  For me the process of becoming a 
psychotherapist has included re-experiencing in some way, the dissociated experiences of 
my parents and their forefathers.  It is what sits in my body.  It is the inherited inter-
generational trauma I have had to face to become someone who can be with others’ and 
their suffering.

Saturday 14th April, 2007 
Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Memorial) 
 
Dear Etty, 
 
How do I describe sitting here now for Yom HaShoah, looking at the Jewish 
dignitaries maintaining a gentle reverent tone of conversation?  I feel bathed by 
this, sad too, wondering how it has taken me so long to return.   
 
‘Call us back and we’ll return’, the words of the Hebrew song I included in Wings 
from the Deep. 
 
I read today in the paper, “...the Russian Jews were the worst treated in Europe.” 
(Whittam Smith, 2007).   This is why I am here (in Australia) today.   
 
Now everyone is still, as Ravel is played on cello and piano.  I feel held by the 
sadness.  I feel like the six candles that have been lit, are being lit inside my heart.  
I think of Rothko’s black square and I imagine a light in the middle of it burning 
there now.8 (Hueneke, 2007) 
 
For the Greeks mythos was a collective thinking in images, a narrative structure 
of transformation, the theatrical psyche.  There was another complementary notion: 
logos.  Clear, realistic thinking.  For Primo Levi, a survivor of Auschwitz, logos was his 
god, his inner necessity.  Throughout his ordeal, he remained alert, alive, and conscious 
of his experience.  He remained an analytic mind throughout the trauma.  This has 
tremendous importance, for complex thinking is the first casualty of trauma.  I quote from 
                                                
8Throughout this thesis I include excerpts from my Letters To Etty.  I use these inclusions in the same way 
as I use various quotes and images: to speak in an emotionally alive voice, a psychodynamically alive 
voice.  This thesis is painted and written from the psychodynamic body.  The images have been created 
using a psychodynamic approach to art.  The writing follows this psychodynamic approach, constructed 
through a conversation consisting of six volumes of handwritten letters.  In this way an emotionally alive, 
imagistic language evolved and the psychodynamic body structured the narrative of the thesis.  Hence the 
importance of my conversation with Etty and my reference to it. 

44
his book The Drowned and the Saved a chapter entitled The Intellectual in Auschwitz 
based upon an essay by his friend Jean Améry who also survived Auschwitz. 
 
Death in Auschwitz was trivial, bureaucratic, and an everyday affair.  It was not 
commented on, it was not ‘comforted by tears’.  In the face of death, in the habit 
of death, the frontier between culture and lack of culture disappeared.  Améry 
states that one no longer thought about whether one would die, an accepted fact, 
but rather about how: 
There were discussions about the time necessary for the poison in the gas 
chambers to take effect.  There were speculations about the painfulness of 
death by phenol injection.  Should one hope for a blow on the skull or 
death by exhaustion in the infirmary? 
On this point, my experience and my recollections diverge from Améry’s.  
Perhaps because I was younger, perhaps because I was more ignorant than he, or 
less marked, or less conscious, I almost never had the time to devote to death; I 
had many other things to keep me busy – find a bit of bread, avoid exhausting 
work, patch my shoes, steal a broom, or interpret the signs and faces around me.  
The aims of life are the best defence against death: and not only in the Lager. 
(Levi, 1986/1995, p. 120) 
 
The challenge of this thesis has been to continue to think while empathically 
feeling into unbearable psychological states.  To ceaselessly search for aliveness midst 
deadening dissociative trauma is also the position of the therapist, who must remain as 
conscious as possible, as alert and awake as possible to what is being communicated in 
the therapeutic encounter.  In this way ‘the frontier between culture and lack of culture’ 
can be rediscovered, re-enlivened and retained. 
 
The work of psychodynamic psychology is the work of the individual in the face 
of dehumanising collective pressures.  In the midst of the Holocaust, Etty was able to 
retain her humanity.  She kept a space within her for the most sacred of human feelings: 

45
...one thing is becoming increasingly clear to me: that You cannot help us, that we 
must help You to help ourselves.  And that is all we can manage these days and 
also all that really matters: that we safeguard that little piece of You, God, in 
ourselves.  And perhaps in others as well.  Alas, there doesn’t seem to be much 
You Yourself can do about our circumstances, about our lives.  Neither do I hold 
You responsible.  You cannot help us but we must help You and defend Your 
dwelling place inside us to the last.  (Hillesum, 1981/1983, p. 151) 
 
As Erich Neumann, a German Jew in Israel, wrote just after the Holocaust ended 
in 1948: 
The shadow side of the human race towers over us all, darkening the sky 
with its death-rays and its atom bombers.  Yet the little creature, though always 
almost annihilated by the big battalions, always manages to survive, and David 
always triumphs over Goliath.  It is the little creature that is the bearer of the 
divine miracle, for this little creature is nothing less than the creative individual, 
and it is under his guidance that the human race makes progress on its journey 
through history. 
And so, in the last analysis, the little creature is in fact the greatest of all 
creatures; and it is only on the surface that a psychology which, at this time of all 
times, regards individuality as the central problem of community, appears to be 
fighting a losing battle.  Again and again, these losing battles turn out to be the 
growing-points at which decisive developments take place for mankind.   
Tel Aviv, Israel, May 1948  
(Neumann, 1948/1990, pp. 19-20) 
 
This is the work of the therapist, making space for the individual midst the 
pressure of the collective.   
 
It is also the work of the doctorate.  From the creative illness of the doctoral 
process finally the thesis is born.

Whoever was still alive had reason for hope.  Health, family, happiness, 
professional abilities, fortune, position in society – all these were things that could 
be achieved again or restored.  After all, we still had all our bones intact. 
(Frankl, 1946/1964, p.82) 
 

47
 Bones  
 
Bones.  Bones.  That’s all that is left.  I remember the fragment of a lost culture.  
My mother is telling me about her mother grating potatoes.  I find a recipe.  It is a 
traditional Chanukkah dish.  Potato Latkes.  From the fragments I can find food.  The 
food will sustain me.  Something is alive and embodied.   
 
Potato Latkes  
 
…As Chanucah falls in December, Russian Jews substituted potatoes for cheese 
to make these delectable latkes… 
 
4 large potatoes 
2 beaten eggs 
4 level tbsp self-raising flour 
1 level teasp salt 
Pinch of white pepper 
 
Grate potatoes so finely that they are almost a pulp.  Leave in a sieve to drain for 
10  minutes.  Put in a bowl and add the remaining ingredients.  In a heavy frying 
pan put enough oil to come to a depth of 1 cm.  When it is hot, put in tablespoons 
of mixture, flattening each latke with the back of spoon.  Cook over steady 
moderate heat, 5 minutes on each side, until a rich brown.  Drain on crumpled 
tissue paper and serve at once.  Serves 5-6. 
(Rose, 1976, p. 230) 
 
What is a recipe?  A fragment from the mother.  Mother culture.  A fragment of 
the mother’s body.  A memory of a feed.  Grating the potatoes.  Rebuilding from there.  
This is therapy.  Find a fragment in a conversation.  Rebuild from there. 
 
Victor Tausk (1879-1919) asserted, a few years after joining the movement in 
1909, that the “progress of psychoanalysis” rested with the Jews.  He explained 

48
that the unique position of the Jews as society’s outcasts furnished them with a 
special sensitivity to the collapse of the traditional political and moral order, as 
well as with a capacity for discerning the foundations of a more stable order: “It is 
understandable that in ancient, neglected palaces, with crumbling walls, we 
[Jews] can see the inner structure and can gain insights which are inaccessible [to 
those living] in beautiful new houses with polished facades. 
(Klein, 1985, p. 140)  
 
I begin to look in ancient neglected places.  My archaeological dig begins. 
 
 
The Ancient Body 
 
The ancient body lives in us all, thousands of years old.  A body with knowledge, 
instincts, images, potentials.  A body with knowledge of its own psychodynamics.  To 
come to know this ancient body I went to look at ancient art.  I wondered how this 
ancient art expressed the body and its cyclical dynamics. 
 
Archeological materials are not mute.  They speak their own language.  And they 
need to be used for the great source they are to help unravel the spirituality of 
those of our ancestors who predate the Indo-European by many thousands of 
years.  (Gimbutas, 1991, p. xix) 
 
The concept of regeneration and renewal is perhaps the most outstanding and 
dramatic theme that we perceive in this symbolism.  (Gimbutas, 1991, p. 316) 
 
The question of mortality was of profound concern but the deep perception of the 
periodicity of nature based on the cycles of the moon and the female body led to 
the creation of a strong belief in the immediate regeneration of life at the crisis of 
death.  There was no simple death, only death and regeneration.  And this was the 
key to the hymn of life reflected in this art.  (Gimbutas, 1991, p.321) 

49
This art, these images, belong to ancient culture before writing existed.  The body 
is experienced as a series of images.  The body is a cultural form, an imagistic mythos.  
‘Death and regeneration’. 
 
The ark, or ship is an ancient symbol, belonging to the body.  The womb a sea 
within which the ship can travel. 
The Cycladic anthropomorphic platters of Keros-Syros culture throw more light 
on ship symbolism.  The middle part is usually decorated by interconnected 
spirals symbolizing water (the sea) with a ship in the middle, or there is a radiant 
sun or snake coil design.  The handle is a pair of legs with a triangular vulva 
above, surrounded by plant motifs, zig-zags or striations...Why vulva and ship on 
the same cult object?  Let us note that there are bird’s feet and a fish attached to 
the prow...The feet indicate the presence of the Goddess herself, and the fish is 
one of her basic epiphanies as the Goddess of Regeneration. 
(Gimbutas, 1991, p. 247)

Freshwater Lake – Saltwater Flood 
 
The flood as a reality was proposed by William Ryan and Walter Pitman in 
Noah’s Flood (2000).  Ryan and Pitman summarized their findings thus: 
 
The Black Sea was created when melting glaciers raised the sea level [of the 
Mediterranean] until the sea breached a natural dam at what is now the Bosporus, 
the strait that separates the Mediterranean Sea from the Black Sea.  An 
apocalyptic deluge followed, 
inundating the freshwater lake below 
the dam, submerging thousands of 
square miles of dry land, flipping the 
ecosystem from fresh water to salt 
practically overnight, and probably 
killing thousands of people and 
billions of land and sea creatures.  
(as cited in Cloughley, 2003, p.8) 
 
From this research I constructed the idea in 
my mind of a freshwater lake held within a 
saltwater sea (see Figure 119).  Freshwater 
lake as the preserved culture.  Freshwater 
lake as self without the saltwater trauma 
system.  Idealised self split off from trauma.   
 
 
Later in therapy the saltwater trauma system becomes integrated, in a way that is 
conscious, not flooding.

51
The notion that the traumatic memory system must be integrated into the stream 
of consciousness changes the whole emphasis of therapeutic behaviour.  There 
must be a stream of consciousness before integration can occur.  Priority is 
therefore given to the establishment of this experience.  The therapist’s first task 
is to develop a relationship with the patient in which it is possible for a mental 
activity, which is non-linear and feeling based, to emerge. 
Second, the traumatic system can only enter the stream if it is made of the 
same kind of experience.  Whereas inner life is visualised, the traumatic system is 
not.  In order to facilitate its integration, it must slowly be converted, in the 
context of a relationship in which the associative form of mental activity is 
operative, into an experience which can be ‘looked at’.  Visualisation is 
fundamental to the process of integration. 
 
The narrative form of the stream of consciousness is made up of scenes.  
In order that the traumatic systems and their satellites can be viewed, they must 
slowly be ‘brought before the eyes’, and built up, bit by bit, through imaginative 
immersion in the patient’s experience.” 
(Meares, 2000, pp 130-131) 
 
The goal of this thesis to bring the trauma system10 ‘before the eyes’.  This thesis 
is a visual thesis, alike to the ‘stream of consciousness’.  It presents a flow of images, in 
art and words, as representative of this journey of integration 
 
 
                                                
10 In this thesis two primary images of the trauma system are the flood and the Holocaust. 

52
East and West   
 
A closer inspection of the deluge that separated Europe from Asia Minor reveals  
that it had a sensational effect on the development of human culture: it mobilized 
people with an intensity unknown until that time, triggered a drive for a more 
efficient organization of cultural institutions, and functioned as a cultural divide.  
Whereas, before 6700 B.C., cultural evolution in the circum-Pontic area had been 
one of convergence, the geological separation of the settlements on the southern 
shores of the Black Sea had long-term consequences, above all the diversification 
of cultural patterns in the West and the East. (Haarmann, 2002) 
 
 
Figure 12.  Anna Hueneke.  Separation of East and West.  2002.11

the Black Sea Flood, c. 6700 BC. Liguria Study Centre, Bogliasco, Italy, 2002.  In response to Linguist, 
Harald Haarmann’s presentation ‘On the formation process of old world civilizations’.   
 
 

53
I recalled Harold Haarmann’s idea of the separation of east and west by the flood 
when I read of Freud’s attempt to bring an eastern sensibility to the west through 
psychoanalysis.  Dennis Klein refers to Marthe Robert’s study into the relationship for 
Freud between Jewish culture and psychoanalysis: 
According to Robert, psychoanalysis resolved Freud’s personal dilemma of 
pursuing his ambitions in the West European world, without betraying his Jewish 
past by assimilating or submitting to Christian culture: As a rational and scientific 
theory, it neutralized the differences between Jews and non-Jews, in preparation 
for communication between the two sides.   
(as cited in Klein, 1985, p. xiii) 
 
Psychoanalysis as a connection point between the two cultures.  Perhaps there is a 
longing deep in our collective psyche for the ancient connection between east and west.  
Perhaps psychoanalysis is a kind of ark upon the sea, upon the flood, between the two. 
 
I wonder too, about Moses Mendelssohn12.   He advocated for Judaism at the 
same time as extending its parameters.  Wider education outside of the traditional 
orthodox education.  Hebrew alongside German and French. 
 
I wonder about the Jewish Enlightenment Haskalah13, a time when east and west 
were more connected, invigorated by one another.  A basis for the later development of 
psychoanalysis. 
 
                                                
12 “Mendelssohn wanted to take the Jews out of a ghetto lifestyle and into secular society. He translated the 
Bible into German, although it was written in Hebrew letters, with a Hebrew commentary called the Biur. 
He campaigned for emancipation and instructed Jews to form bonds with the gentile governments. He tried 
to improve the relationship between Jews and Christians as he argued for tolerance and humanity. He 
became the symbol of the Jewish Enlightenment, the Haskalah.”  (Schoenberg) 
13 “The Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, was an intellectual movement in Europe that lasted from 
approximately the 1770s to the 1880s. The Haskalah was inspired by the European Enlightenment but had a 
Jewish character. Literally, Haskalah comes from the Hebrew word sekhel, meaning "reason" or intellect" 
and the movement was based on rationality. It encouraged Jews to study secular subjects, to learn both the 
European and Hebrew languages, and to enter fields such as agriculture, crafts, the arts and science. The 
maskilim (followers of the Haskalah) tried to assimilate into European society in dress, language, manners 
and loyalty to the ruling power. The Haskalah eventually influenced the creation of both the Reform  and 
Zionist movements.”  (Schoenberg) 

54
In my own imagination, on this ark, between cultures, are not only philosophers 
and psychologists but also artists. 
 
Freud himself says: 
I am really by nature an artist...in all countries into which psychoanalysis has 
penetrated it has been better understood and applied by writers and artists than by 
doctors.  My books, in fact, more resemble works of imagination than treatises on 
pathology...In psychoanalysis you may find fused together though changed into 
scientific jargon, the three greatest literary schools of the nineteenth century: 
Heine, Zola, and Mallarmé are united in me under the patronage of my old 
master, Goethe.  (as cited in Hillman, 1995, p. 3) 
 
I sense the richness of a forgotten age.  An age that perhaps my forbears would 
have some experience of.  That is, before they escaped another later flood, the deluge of 
destruction that flooded Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Graves 
 
When the prisoners were forced to dig up the mass graves, the dead entered them 
through their pores and were carried through their bloodstreams to their brains 
and hearts.  And through their blood into another generation.  Their arms were 
into death up to the elbows, but not only into death – into music, into a memory of 
the way a husband or son leaned over his dinner, a wife’s expression as she 
watched her child in the bath; into beliefs, mathematical formulas, dreams.  As 
they felt another man’s and another’s blood-soaked hair through their fingers, the 
diggers begged forgiveness.  And those lost lives made molecular passage into 
their hands. 
 
How can one man take on the memories of even one other man, let alone 
five or ten or a thousand or ten thousand; how can they be sanctified each?  He 
stops thinking.  He concentrates on the whip, he feels a face in his hand, he grasps 
hair as if in a passion grasp, its matted thickness between his fingers, pulling, his 
hands full of names.  His holy hands move, autonomous. 
(Michaels, 1997, p.52) 
 
 
The Jewish Body 
 
I am unfolding my piece of heritage, and at once there rise to my nose the odors 
of my old home. 
My ears begin to sound with the clamor of the shop and the melodies that the 
rabbi sang on holidays.  From every corner a shadow thrusts out, and no sooner 
do I touch it that it pulls me into a dancing circle with other shadows.  They jostle 
one another, prod me in the back, grasp me by the hands, the feet, until all of them 
together fall upon me like a host of humming flies on a hot day.  I do not know 
where to take refuge from them.  And so, just once, I want very much to wrest 
from the darkness a day, an hour, a moment belonging to my vanished home.  
 
(Chagall, Bella., 1969, p. 10)

My great-grandmother Sophia Hillman was born in 1876, in Dvinsk, Latvia to 
parents Isaac Hillman, traveller and Emma Deitz14.  My great-grandfather Philip Josephs 
was born in 1876, in Libau, Latvia to parents Simon Josephs15, tailor and Rachael 
Israels16. 
 
It was the time of pogroms and fear. 
 
…the son had lived through a pogrom when he was a schoolboy, a three-day 
Cossack raid.  On the third morning when the houses were still smoldering and he 
was led, with a half dozen other children, out of a cellar where they had been 
hiding he saw a black-bearded Jew with a white sausage stuffed into his mouth, 
lying in the road on a pile of bloody feathers, a peasant’s pig devouring his arm.” 
(Malamud, 1966, pp. 4-5) 
 
As young adults Sophia and Philip migrated to Glasgow, Scotland where in 1897 
they married17.  In 1902 they immigrated again to New Zealand.  There they began their 
family with my grandfather Harold, the seventh child of eight, born in 1910 in 
Johnsonville.  In 1921 they immigrated again to Australia.   
 
In his immigration papers my great-grandfather describes himself as having grey 
hair, brown eyes and as ‘a bit round shouldered’.  He was self-employed as a tailor in his 
own business on Pitt Street.  Their home was in Randwick, Sydney, where a strong 
Jewish community was growing18.

My great-grandmother Jane Rosenberg was born in Manchester, England in 1882 
to parents Simon Rosenberg19 and Esther Jividsky20. My great-grandfather Wolf Kersh 
was born in 1876, in Krementchey, the Department of Mogilev, Russia to father Jacob 
Kersh and a Russian Jewish mother21. 
 
As a young man he was conscripted into the Russian army.  A cruel army 
especially to its Jewish members.  After being whipped repeatedly by an officer Wolf’s 
fiery temper exploded and he hit the officer.  He ran for his life across the fields of 
Europe till he finally arrived in Manchester, a long way from home.  He was taken in by a 
Jewish family22. 
 
They offer him a warm bowl of soup.  I imagine chicken soup with matzo balls.  
 
Knaidlach 
These are sometimes called ‘halkes’ or ‘matzo balls’.  The secret of success is to 
use sufficient fat to make them tender yet firm.  Providing the specified amount of 
fat is used, the amount of matzo meal may be increased if you prefer a firmer 
(though equally tender) texture.  Ground almonds greatly enhance the flavour and 
texture, but an equal quantity of medium matzo meal can be used instead. 
 
 
1 slightly rounded tbsp soft rendered chicken fat 
(or 3 level tbsp of margarine) 
 
 
1 large egg 
 
 
2 tbsp chicken soup or warm water 
 
 
Half level teasp salt 
 
 
Pinch white pepper 
 
 
2 level tbsp ground almonds 
 
 
2 oz (50 g/approx 6 level tbsp) medium matzo meal

Beat the egg with a rotary whisk until fluffy, then stir in the fat, tepid soup or 
water, seasonings, matzo meal and ground almonds…Refrigerate or chill in a cold 
larder for at least one hour…Wet your hands under cold water tap, take a walnut-
sized piece of the now stiffened mixture, and roll it into a ball between your 
palms.  Have ready a large pan half full of boiling water (or chicken soup).   
Add 1 teaspoon salt, then drop in the balls.  When the water is barely bubbling,  
put on the lid, and simmer gently for 40 minutes, without looking at the contents 
of the pan during that time.  Uncover, lift out the knaidlach with a slotted spoon, 
and lower them gently into simmering chicken soup…Makes 8 knaidlach, enough 
for 4 people. 
(Rose, 1976, pp. 35-36) 
 
In this family home Wolf met Jane Rosenberg.  They married in Manchester in 
1900 and there began their family.  My grandmother Hannah Kersh was born in 
Manchester, the third of six children, in 1907.  Hannah was her Hebrew name23.  Later 
she came to be known as Annie, Connie or even Queenie.  In 1910 Wolf travelled to 
Sydney, Australia and some years later his family followed.  Wolf was employed in his 
own ‘Furniture Factory’ as ‘Master cabinet maker’ in Surry Hills.  The family home was 
also in Surry Hills24. 
 
The Maccabean Hall was built in Sydney with the aim of centralising all 
activities relating to the social, educational and sporting interests of the 
community, and also to assist with the integration of Jewish immigrants.  This 
important step helped in attempts to revitalise the community…in November 
1920 a site was purchased in Darlinghurst Road, Darlinghurst.  The Maccabean 
Hall, or the ‘Mac’ as it was called, was erected under the supervision of architect 
Gordon S. Keesing, and on 9 November 1923 it was opened with great pomp and 
ceremony by Sir John Monash.

Wolf Kersh. 

59
The opening of the hall increased communal social activities and a number 
of local youth clubs amalgamated and became affiliated with it… 
The growth of Jewish youth clubs also aimed at preventing assimilation by 
providing the younger generation with opportunities for more social contact.  The 
involvement of youth was important for maintaining the vitality of the community 
as ‘young blood will bring young courage and new ideas, all of which are needed 
in Sydney’.  In the 1920s attempts were made to fill the need for more permanent 
youth groups.  The Young People’s Hebrew Association was established in 1915 
and the Randwick-Coogee Social Club in 1922… 
(Rutland, 1988, p. 155) 
 
It was through these organisations that my grandparents became vibrant members 
of their own community. 
 
Harold Josephs and Annie Kersh were married at The Great Synagogue, Elizabeth 
Street, Sydney on the 6th December, 1931 by Rabbi Cohen.  I discover their Hebrew 
names on the marriage certificate.  Harold is ‘Deer son of My Light’.   Tsvee ben Ori.  
Annie is ‘Hannah daughter of Wolf’.  Channa bat Ze’ev.25 
 
Evocative images held secretly in the Hebrew script.  A hidden cultural mind.  A 
community of belonging. 
 
In Sydney, 1935, The Hebrew Standard published an article ‘The Nazi Terror in 
Action’, by Rev. L. M. Birkhead on his recent visit to the secret offices of Streicher in 
Nuremberg, Germany.  
...I became so persistent that the office of “Der Stuermer” sent me to what was 
described to as Streicher’s “secret office” where his plans for fomenting world 
violence against the Jews are promoted.  Paul Wurm, in charge of this office,

Body) personal communication, 2007. 

60
which has over its doors the legend, “Fencing School,” unfolded to me the plans 
which Streicher has laid for starting trouble against the Jews in every country. 
   I saw the files which contain the books and papers and pamphlets which 
Streicher has collected from anti-Semites from all over the world.  Also, Wurm 
said, “we are in correspondence with all of these people.”   
   “We purpose to teach them the German technique of dealing with the Jews,” he 
boasted. 
 
In 1941, with their young son Brian, Harold and Annie moved to Manly cutting 
off their ties to family and the Jewish community.  Cut.  Cut.  Cut.  Cut. 
 
I ask my grandmother years later, “Are we Jewish?”   
“I don’t care if you are a Calathumpian,” she tells me, “as long as you are a good 
person.” 
 
My grandfather wanted to help the war effort but was too old.  He applied twice 
to join up.  The second time he was accepted as a general clerk for the RAAF.  He was 
posted to ‘Rec. Centre 2’, which from his 
records looks to be near Narrandera26.   
 
My mother was conceived just before he 
left.  Caroline. 
 
Born into fear.  Born into loss.  Loss of 
father.  Loss of culture.   
 
Loss of mother too.  In 1945 Harold is 
called home.  Urgent needs.

This is to certify that Mrs Josephs is suffering from Total Deafness and 
neurasthenia.  Her condition is deteriorating and she is quite unable to supervise 
her two young children.   
I therefore, consider it essential that her husband should be released as 
soon as possible to relieve her of domestic responsibility and to properly control 
the children.  This matter should be dealt with urgently.27 
 
‘Total Deafness’.  ‘Neurasthenia’.  Not hearing.  No energy to hear.  No energy to live.  
Jews dying.  European Jewish culture decimated.  No culture.  No words.  No images.  
Emptiness. 
 
This emptiness is passed on.  I am feeling into the emptiness.  Seeing the 
emptiness.  Seeing into the emptiness with my body.  
 
The development of self is related to a form of memory in which the past can be 
metaphorically ‘seen’.  States in which the sense of self is deficient are dominated 
by forms of memory in which the component of ‘visualisation’ is lacking.  The 
individual is unaware that he or she is remembering.  In such states, the therapist 
has the task of taking part in the mutual struggle to represent that which cannot be 
seen.  (Meares, 2000, p. 144) 
 
I visit the graves of my four great-grandparents at the Rookwood Cemetery in 
Sydney.  I find them one by one.  They are not buried together.  Wolf Kersh, died 28th 
June 1955.  ‘Wolf son of Jacob’ is inscribed in Hebrew.  Ze’ev ben Yakov. Wolf retained 
his Hebrew name all his life.   
 
Quietly I pay tribute to the long journey from home.

Next I find his wife Jane Kersh, who died some years before him on the 28th 
March 1942.  Another secret is revealed.  Jane and her mother’s Hebrew names are 
inscribed on the headstone.  ‘Living, daughter of Happiness’.  Chaia bat Seemcha. 
  
And on both headstones in Hebrew ‘May this soul be part of the living group’.  
Tehee nishmato tzroorah betzror hachayeem. 
 
The graves of Philip and Sophia Josephs are unmarked.  Philip died on the 25th of 
April 1946.  His wife Sophia died on the 9th of November 1935.   
 
Just a small piece of earth.  A space.  But not empty.  I stand and pay homage to 
the hidden body resting there and its long journey across the seas from the place of birth.  
The skeleton.

The naked skeleton, or the dead person who still lives, is an indestructible, eternal 
figure, which cannot be harmed by the changes of life.  The ideas of eternal 
indestructibility, of form-giving and of solidity-bestowing power – these are all 
ideas which belong to the archetypal symbol of the Self.  The symbols of the 
naked skeleton and of the divine, living dead are consequently outer shapes of the 
Self.  (Fierz-David, 1957/1988, p. 128) 
 
 
The German Body 
 
I know this body.  I have spent time in this body.  I have the broad shoulders and 
strong bones of my father’s body.  As a teenager I spent much time following him 
through his beloved mountains.  Through blizzards, long treks along windy ridges, 
camping in tents in the freezing cold snow.  Yes I know this body and its tenacity too.  
My uncle, aunts, and cousins, my Opa, Oma, and Omi, were all here, all around me as a 
child 
 
There are records of this German body dating back to the 1700s all documented 
on a family tree Precht – Hüneke Stammtafel created by my father Klaus Hueneke in 
1977.  He wrote it in the local dialect of German Plattdeutsch that he grew up with. 
 
My great-grandfather Karl Albert Hüneke was born in 1885 in Bremen.  He was 
the first born of six to parents Johann Albert Hüneke, Shoemaker Shuhmacher and Anna 
Margarethe Bremermann.   
 
My great-grandmother Bertha Gesine Schierloh was born in 1887 in 
Schwachhausen.  She was fourth born of five children to Johann Hinrich Schierloh, 
bricklayer, Maurer and Elizabeth Bertha Emilie Eltrich.   
 
Karl and Bertha married in Bremen on the 31st of October 1908.  Heiratstag.  Two 
months later their first child was born, Berta Gesine, followed by my grandfather Karl 

64
Walter in 1910, and his younger brother Rudolf in 1913.  Kinder.  Karl worked as a 
boilermaker Kesselschmied, soldier Soldat and campmaster Lagermeister.  There is a 
photo of Karl Albert as an eighteen-year-old.  He was a wrestler.  Strong body.  Proud 
German body.   
 
My great-grandfather Johannes Friedrich Precht was born in 1877 in Bremen.  He 
was the fourth child of Christian Diedrich Precht, carpenter Zimmermann, and Christiane 
Johanne Dorothee Stohlbreder, dressmaker Schneiderin.   
 
My great-grandmother Clara Erna Marie Bruns was born in 1888 in Bremen.  She 
was sixth child to Ludwig Heinrich Bruns, cigar-maker Cigarrenmacher and Dorothee 
Wilhelmine Henriette Friedhoff. 
 
Friedrich (Johannes) and Marie (Clara) married in 1909.  Their first daughter, my 
grandmother Clara was born in 1910, followed in quick succession by her four younger 
siblings Cita in 1910, Fritz in 1912, Erika in 1913 and Ludwig in 1914.  Kinder.  
Friedrich worked as a waiter Kellner and a soldier Soldat during the first world war.  As 
well as being wife and mother Marie worked as a cook Köchin.  
 
 
Figure 15. Clara Precht with her mother Marie. 1910. 

65
Clara becomes the carer for her four younger siblings when her father goes to 
war.  Fatherless families.  Loss.  Overburdened mother.   
 
Friedrich returns from war troubled, depressed.  He works in town as a waiter.  
But alcohol tempts him and worsens his depressive temperament.  Clara remembers 
collecting him from work after he’d been drinking accompanying him on the long walk 
home. 
 
After a nervous breakdown in the 1930s her father is hospitalised.  Clara visits 
him every week.  Riding her bicycle across Bremen to visit her father at the  
Nervenklinik29.  Every week. 
 
Already the path to becoming a therapist is 
made.  Two generations later her grand-daughter 
rides her bicycle across town to visit her analyst.  
Every week.  From this discipline comes the 
capacity to hold others.  Every week. 
 
Every week.  Reliable.  Disciplined.  
German discipline.  Responsible daughter. 
 
 
Loss of Father.  Overburdened mother.  
Friedrich returns home from the clinic an utterly 
broken man.  For the remainder of his life he is 
bedridden, speechless, tapping all day on the 
window sill.  A silent communication of despair.  It 
was the time of Hitler.  Drastic actions were taken.  
The operation broke a fundamental connection to 
life lived.  An unspoken sadness permeates the 
family.  A silence.  A shame.  A terror.

Oma is showing me how to cook Rolladen und Kartoffel.  She is telling me in her 
simple English how to roll the thin beef, with the gherkin and bacon inside, and then tie it 
with cotton.  She is telling me how to brown these rolls first then cook them slowly in 
water.  She is showing me how to steam the potatoes in a pressure cooker.  When I try at 
home I can never get the meat as tender as she used to make it.  Rich sauce, tender meat, 
soft potatoes.  Es schmeckt gut Anna?  Sehr gut Oma.  Perfect. 
 
There is film footage - German Lens - of my grandparents and great-grandparents 
digging potatoes kartoffel out of the German earth.  They grew their own vegetables.  
Orchard.  Animals.  Self sufficient.  Outdoors.  Healthy.  Always Green.  Immer grün. 
 
My grandparents Walter and Clara married in Bremen on the 25th January 1936.  
They had four children spaced over 17 years.  Erika in 1936, my father Klaus in 1944, 
Vera in 1947 and Walter in 1953.  My grandfather worked as a toolmaker 
Werkzeugmacher, draughtsman Zeichner, pool attendant Bademeister, and storekeeper 
Ladeninhaber. 
 
15 MARCH, 9:30 A.M.  Yesterday afternoon we read over the notes he had given 
me.  And when we came to the words, ‘If there were only one human being 
worthy of the name of “man”, then we should be justified in believing in men and 
in humanity,’ I threw my arms round him on a sudden impulse.  It is the problem 
of our age: hatred of Germans poisons everyone’s mind.  ‘Let the bastards drown, 
the lot of them’ – such sentiments make one feel that life these days has grown 
impossible.  Until suddenly, a few weeks ago, I had a liberating thought which 
surfaced in me like a hesitant, tender young blade of grass thrusting its way 
through a wilderness of weeds: if there were only one decent German, then he 
should be cherished despite that whole barbaric gang, and because of that one 
decent German it is wrong to pour hatred over an entire people.  (Hillesum, 
1981/1983, p. 8) 
 

67
My grandfather was a draughtsman for Focke-Wulf, an aeroplane manufacturer in 
Bremen, during the war.  In 1941 they moved their entire office to Bad Eilsen in the 
country north of Bremen.  Prisoners came from the camp nearby to dig out the air raid 
shelters for him and his work colleagues.  Seeing they were near starvation he fed them 
his sandwiches in secret.30 
 
Irony is scissors, a divining rod, always pointing in two directions.  If the 
evil can’t be erased, then neither can the good.  It’s as accurate a measure of any 
society: what is the smallest act of kindness that is considered heroic?  In those 
days, to be moral required no more than the slightest flicker of movement – a 
micrometre – of eyes looking away or blinking, while a running man crossed a 
field.  And those who gave water or bread!  They entered a realm higher than the 
angels’ simply by remaining in the human mire. 
Complicity is not sudden, though it occurs in an instant. 
To be proved true, violence need only occur once.  But good is proved true 
by repetition. 
(Michaels, 1997, p. 162) 
 
What did my grandfather see that the German lens does not record?  He used to 
stamp his fist on the table if we left a piece of uneaten food on our plate.  His face would 
contort and in simple English with a heavy German accent he would reprimand and 
remind about those starving in other parts of the world. 
 
When my parents were liberated...There was no more simple meal, no thing was 
less than extraordinary: a fork, a mattress, a clean shirt, a book.  Not to mention 
such things that can make one weep: an orange, meat and vegetables, hot water.  
There was no ordinariness to return to, no refuge from the blinding potency of 
things, an apple screaming its sweet juice. 
(Michaels, 1997, p. 205)

“Is an apple food?” 
 
 
“Yes.” 
 
 
“And you throw away food?  You—my son—you throw away food?” 
 
 
“It’s rotten—“ 
 
 
“Eat it...Eat it!” 
 
 
“Pa, it’s rotten—I won’t—“ 
 
He pushed it into my teeth until I opened my jaw.  Struggling, sobbing, I ate.  Its 
brown taste, oversweetness, tears.  Years later, living on my own, if I threw out 
leftovers or left food on my plate in a restaurant, I was haunted by pathetic 
cartoon scraps in my sleep. 
(Michaels, 1997, p. 218) 
 
My grandfather was a traveller. In 1955, he brought his whole family to a new 
country.  Across the globe.  He knew about the journey.  During the Depression he 
travelled Europe on foot, sleeping on trains at night.  He had a camera from which he 
made postcards which he sold to feed himself.  The traveller.  The German lens.  Ideal 
moments, ideal landscapes captured through the precision of the German lens.   He passes 
this on to his son Klaus. 
 
The Huenekes lived first at Bonegilla Migrant Camp on Lake Hume near 
Wodonga, then in Orange near Bathurst.  There they had many German friends and lived 
in a countryside much like home.  Rich land.  Fertile crops.  Healthy bodies.  The mantra 
of survival.  Immer grün. 
 
I go to the local Farmers Market.  I am speaking to a farmer from Orange.  He is 
selling me a large hessian bag full of potatoes.  Just a week out of the ground.  He is 
telling me that potatoes are a living organism.  Alive.   Keep them in the dark or they 
grow eyes. 
 
Klaus moves to Sydney in the 1960s. 

69
Trapped 
 
The Daughter’s Body 
 
What happens when these two histories meet?  Sparks fly.  Powerful instincts take 
over.   
 
Caroline and Klaus attend a Summer School for the Arts in the 1960s.  Dance, 
Drama, Clay, Painting.   Expression, Self, Inner feelings.  A new mantra - Inner 
Necessity. 
 
A powerful connection is made.  A dangerous conjunction of fated opposites.  
Caroline Josephs and Klaus Hueneke marry on the 14th of September, 1968 in Sydney.   
 
I am born into this on June 20th 1970, the Jewish-German hybrid, the immigrants’ 
Australian daughter. 
 
Wild idealism.  Difficult realities.  Artistic expression and creativity.  My parents 
run a week-long multi-arts workshop at the Canberra School of Art, Exploring Creativity 
in 1977.  Creation and destruction sit side by side.  It was soon after that their marriage 
fell apart.   
 
TUESDAY, 25 MARCH, 9.00 P.M…I can’t remember the precise words we 
exchanged.  It was that afternoon when people thought of nothing but getting 
away to England and I asked, ‘Do you think it makes sense to escape?’  And he 
said, ‘The young have to stay put.’  And I, ‘Do you think democracy can win?’  
And he, ‘It’s bound to win but it’s going to cost us several generations.’  And 
he, fearless Bonger, was suddenly as defenceless as a child, almost gentle, and I 
felt an irresistible need to put my arms round him and to lead him like a child and 
so, with my arm round him, we walked on across the Skating Club.  He seemed a 
broken man and good through and through.  All the passion and fire in him had 

70
been doused.  My heart overflows when I think of how he was that afternoon – he, 
the college tyrant.  And at Jan Willem Brouwers Square I took my leave of him.  I 
stood in front of him, took one of his hands between mine and he gently lowered 
his heavy head a little and looked at me through his blue glasses, which hid his 
eyes, and sounded almost like a stage comic as he said, ‘My pleasure.’ 
 
And next evening at Becker’s, the first thing I heard was: ‘Bonger is dead!’ I said, 
‘That’s impossible, I spoke to him last night at seven o’clock.’  And Becker said, 
‘Then you must have been one of the last people to speak to him.  He put a bullet 
through his brain at eight o’clock.’31  (Hillesum, 1981/1983, pp. 18-20) 
 
In times of war death is a protective cocoon.   
 
My younger sister and I began swapping from house to house across Canberra in

…thousands were stuffed into baking stoves, sewers, garbage bins.  In the 
crawlspaces of double ceilings, in stables, pigsties, chicken coops.  A boy my age 
hid in a crate; after ten months he was blind and mute, his limbs atrophied.  A 
woman stood in a closet for a year and a half, never sitting down, blood bursting 
her veins…Jews were filling the corners and cracks of Europe, every available 
space.  They buried themselves in strange graves, any space that would fit their 
bodies, absorbing more room than was allotted to them in the world. 
(Michaels, 1997, p. 45) 
 
Trapped in a ‘strange grave’.  Trapped in the imagination with no body to enliven 
it.  I could imagine anything.  But there was no way I could move.  There was no space to 
move into.  No relationship to enliven the body.  Warzone.

…I feel like a small battlefield, in which the problems, or some of the problems, 
of our time are being fought out.  All one can hope to do is keep oneself humbly 

72
available, to allow oneself to be a battlefield.  After all, the problems must be 
accommodated, have somewhere to struggle and come to rest and we, poor little 
humans, must put our inner space at their service and not run away.  In that 
respect, I am probably very hospitable; mine is often an exceedingly bloody 
battlefield and dreadful fatigue and splitting headaches are the toll I have to pay.  
(Hillesum, 1981/1983, p. 25) 
 
 
Hidden Realities during War 
 
I am as mystified by my history as anyone.  What is real?  Images.  Associative 
Images.  Painted images.  How else do I know who I am? 
 
How does the imagistic mind see reality?  What reality?  There is a moment in 
therapy when a client reveals themself as they really are.  Reality.  As therapist it can be 
difficult and confronting to really see the damage.  The images are real.  The images do 
represent a felt and experienced reality. 
 
Reality.  As a child it was not always clear.   
 
My father is renting a house in O’Connor.  My sister and I share a room.  There is 
almost nothing in it.  A squeaky narrow bunk bed, made from metal tubing and sprung 
wires stretched to sagging by previous owners.  My sister is on the top bunk.  I poke her 
through the thin mattress.  We giggle until we are told it is time to sleep.   
 
The night.  The night.  I am always scared at night.  I imagine a hundred 
predators.  The night.  The night. 
 
My sister and I are creeping into our father’s bedroom.  It is early morning.  We 
wonder, will he be there this time?   
 

73
A sliver of memory, almost lost.  Easily deniable reality.   
 
Keep them in the dark or they grow eyes. 
 
…the typical case of someone who, accustomed to lying publicly, ends by lying 
in private too, to himself, and building for himself a comforting truth which 
allows him to live in peace. (Levi, 1986/1995, p. 15) 
 
I am in my mother’s house on the other side of town to my father.  I have woken 
up to a spider above my bed.  A huntsman.  I am convinced that if I leave my room the 
spider will fall into my bed and remain there hidden until I return, ready to pounce.  I am 
petrified.  My mother and my sister are asleep.  I am paralysed by the spider.  Waiting.  
 
Spider’s web.  Mother.  Mother’s web.  Fearful to leave.  Fearful to stay. 
 
 
This system [Accommodation] typically arises as a consequence of the 
failures of the mother, or other caregivers, to respond in a way which connects 
with the child’s feeling based reality.  These failures are experienced as mini-
separations and evoke anxiety.  This anxiety drives the child towards re-
establishing the bond with her.  The child behaves in a way which it believes is 
required in order to regain contact with the mother.  This involves a sacrifice.  
The child, in complying to what seems to be demanded, will jettison those 
emotional responses which threaten the link with the caregiver.  He or she emits 
only those expressions which are acceptable even if these expressions are not 
congruent with the bodily states which accompany emotions.  As a consequence, 
the developing individual senses a diminished aliveness which, in later life, he or 
she will describe as ‘deadness’ or even ‘falseness’.  In essence, the child gives up 
the later developing system of intimacy, which depends upon the revelation of 
inner states, in favour of attachment, the stronger, earlier imperative.  The 
relationship is one of ‘non-intimate attachment’.  (Meares, 2000, pp. 113-114) 
 

74
 
Figure 19.  Anna Hueneke.  Selfless.  2006 
 
Thirty years later I meet the huntsman again.  I am living in a house surrounded 
by bush. In the summer a huntsman spider drops from the hallway ceiling every week.  I 
steel myself.  I kill the spider.  I hit it with the back of a broom.  I scream as I do this.  I 
am still petrified.   
 
It is the spider mother I am killing.  Finally I can leave her sticky web.  Lost in the 
web there is no reality.  I want to connect with reality.  Leave the sticky web. 
 
Reality wasn’t mirrored.  Psychological reality.  What was left but to retreat into 
the imagination.  Imagination without body.  Dead body.  When the psychological reality 
is understood the body is enlivened.  
 
 

75
The psychological reality of the Holocaust was hidden by many. 
 
…it is certain that the failure to divulge the truth about the Lagers represents one 
of the major collective crimes of the German people, and the most obvious 
demonstration of the cowardice to which Hitlerian terror had reduced them: a 
cowardice which became an integral part of mores, and so profound as to prevent 
husbands from telling their wives, parents their children.  Without this cowardice 
the greatest excesses would not have been carried out, and Europe and the world 
would be different today.  (Levi, 1986/1995, p. 4) 
 
One has to remember that those who enter therapy are the brave souls who may 
well be operating within a relational system that is something like the Holocaust scene.  
Where the real self has to hide away.   
 
The man excavating in the mud at Biskupin, the man I came to know as Athos, 
wore me under his clothes.  My limbs bone-shadows on his strong legs and arms, 
my head buried in his neck, both of us beneath a heavy coat.  I was suffocating 
but I couldn’t get warm.  Inside Athos’s coat, cold air streaming in from the edge 
of the car door.  The drone of engine and wheels, once in a while the sound of a 
passing lorry.  In our strange coupling, Athos’s voice burrowed into my brain.  I 
didn’t understand so I made it up myself: It’s right, it’s necessary to run…   
(Michaels, 1997, p. 13) 
 
This evocative image represents protection, flight to safety.  It is an image that 
describes something of the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.  We begin deep in 
unconsciousness.  Protection.  Safety.  Separation from the war.  Safety from the 
collective.  Jakob is the buried Jew ‘crying with the abandonment of his age’.  He belongs 
to a collective tragedy.  Yet he is the individual who walks through the therapist’s door.   
 
 
 
 

76
Psychotherapy can initiate processes and healing, always providing we admit 
 
that the sick person is the product of a particular history and culture.  Thus, a 
 
psychotherapy not founded on culture, or a psychotherapist who does not have a 
 
cultured view of life and is unaware that sickness has its roots in cultural 
 
complexes, is inconceivable.  
(López-Pedraza, 1990, p. 58) 
 
For the therapist, facing the reality of the client’s suffering is confronting.  The 
client communicates their suffering in powerful ways through the relationship. 
 
If, as analysts, we work with children of survivors, we must also accept the strong 
emotions projected by the patient when the Holocaust silence is broken and the 
trauma is exposed.  We must have the strength to bear the unbearable 
countertransference that mirrors what is unbearable and secret in every human 
being – the impact of the fragility of civilization in patient and analyst alike, 
which tries to defend against a deeper evil: man’s inhumanity to man. 
 
(Pines, 1993, pp. 224-225)  
 
‘It’s going to cost us several generations.’  ‘Unbearable countertransference.’ 
 
The persecutor suffers too. 
 
…the entire history of the brief ‘millennial Reich’ can be reread as a war against 
memory, an Orwellian falsification of memory, falsification of reality, negation of 
reality...Like all gamblers, he [Hitler] erected around himself a stage set woven 
out of superstitious lies, which he ended by believing with the same fanatical faith 
that he demanded from every German.  His collapse was not only a salvation for 
mankind but also a demonstration of the price to be paid when one dismembers 
the truth.  (Levi, 1986/1995, p. 18) 
 

77
…Hitler’s…father was brutal and repeatedly beat Adolf and his mother did 
nothing to protect him since she felt too intimidated by the father.   
Shamed individuals or groups or nations commonly strike back in rage at 
those they perceive as oppressing them…  (Barney, 1996) 
 
What we encounter through our client in therapy is their internalised familial and 
cultural system.  A system passed from generation to generation.  The parents who are 
unable to empathise were once children whose psychological reality was not brought into 
relationship. 
 
Gustav Dreifuss notes: 
For many years, I worked with Holocaust victims. I was confronted on the one 
hand with man's unbounded capacity for evil, and on the other hand with man's 
capacity to suffer and yet survive. It was difficult even to listen to the endless 
tales of atrocities, and difficult to imagine how victims of the Holocaust, who had 
undergone such terrible experiences, could continue to live their everyday lives. 
Empathy and patient listening were my main tools for helping my patients. I 
believe in the healing power of compassion and have used it to alleviate the 
suffering and enable the victim to live with his wounds. 
 
In the l980's I was invited to Berlin to give a seminar to Jungian analysts on the 
Holocaust. Here I encountered the now adult children of Nazis, and I came to 
realize that their experiences were in one respect comparable to those of children 
of Jewish Holocaust survivors. Jews who had survived very often did not tell their 
children anything about their appalling experiences, in order to spare them their 
parents' mental anguish. The children nevertheless felt that some secret was being 
withheld from them. There is some similarity between Jews and Nazis 
withholding information from their children. Yet there is a fundamental difference 
between the victimizers, the Nazis, and the victims, the Jews: The Nazis were 
ashamed of their past and the Jews wanted to protect their children from the 

78
confrontation with their suffering. Yet, for the victims of the Holocaust, their 
gruesome memories remain with them all the their lives. 
(Dreifuss, 1999) 
 
Slowly, slowly we begin to bring back the embodied experience.  Images are the 
key.  Images lead to deeper body experiences.  Image schemas.  Body knowledge. 
 
The image schema is a mental gestalt, developing out of bodily experience and 
forming the basis for abstract meanings.  Image schemas are the mental structures 
which underpin our experience of discernible order, both in the physical and in 
the world of imagination and metaphor.   
(Knox, 2004, p. 9) 
 
I am the therapist seeing.  Experiencing and understanding through my own body.   
 
Attachment is a major image schema in psychodynamic psychology.  But so often 
I find myself with a client in utero. 
 
Other forms of memory are ‘non-conscious’ or ‘anoetic’.  They include 
the perceptual representation system (PRS) which is operative at birth or even 
earlier... 
The perceptual representation system (PRS) is an aspect of ‘implicit 
memory’ which causes an individual to be influenced by a past experience 
without awareness that he or she is remembering.  In the sense that it does not 
depend upon later maturing aspects of brain function, perceptual representation 
can be regarded as ‘primitive’.  However, this word should not imply relative 
inefficiency.  Perceptual representation is extraordinarily accurate.   
(Meares, 2000, p. 102) 
 
This unconscious feeling constantly informs the therapy.  In utero.  Limitless.  A 
basic body state.  We feel it.  We are in the deep pregnant body.  We feel the baby, 

79
frightened, limitless.  We feel the dangerous swallowing mother.  A devouring gestation.  
We work hard to find a real and separate body.  Facing reality.  Seeing and feeling the 
psychological reality.  Experiencing movement for the first time.  These are the wings.  

80
Images 
 
The Imagistic Mind 
 
The imagistic mind constructs memory not as a historical chronicle but as a 
narrative of images.  Psychologically this has a parallel to Meares’ comparison between a 
‘chronicle’ and the flow or ‘narrative’ of self. 
 
The therapeutic conversation starts in the language of alienation...When the 
therapist is confronted with a chronicle, the therapeutic aim will be to transform 
this conversation into one that is more complex.  Using Spence’s (1984) 
terminology, the task involves the transformation of “historical truth” into 
“narrative truth.”  
(Meares, 1998, p. 888) 
 
In local indigenous culture, collective memory is stored in the dreamtime 
narrative.  It is imagistic and theatrical. 
The concept of time represented by the Dreaming is cyclical.  Time is not a linear 
sequence moving from past to present to future; it is one in which the long past is 
ever present and ties both future and past to the moment when a correct 
reproduction of a Dreaming performance takes place.  
(Ellis, 1984, p. 153) 
 
For indigenous Australians memory is recorded in an inner structure, the 
dreaming.  It is imagistic and alive.  Not a historical record.  This thesis is like this.  The 
flood is a historical reality, as is the holocaust, my childhood, and the histories of my 
parents, grandparents and great-grandparents.  I am approaching these historical realities 
from within the imagistic mind.  I am attempting in my whole approach to this thesis to 
embody this imagistic mind.  To think from within it and express it through this written 
form.   

81
This is, for me, the psychotherapist’s position.  I constantly work to sustain this 
position in my practice.  Every single moment, action, movement, word, feeling and 
image is a communication of the poetic structure of my client’s psyche.  Yes it is reality.  
Yes they are telling me about real situations.  My responsive position though is of 
entering psyche’s poetry.   
 
A language of connectedness is the opposite of the logical and linear.  Although it 
is apparently “ordinary”, it has ideally the effect of poetic expression.   
(Meares, 1998, p. 888) 
 
Early in my research I was reading about the Greek Mysteries, not as a scholar of 
history, but as a psychologist searching to understand the process of transformation.  
What I discovered was that the mysteries rituals were a search for image from within an 
experience of darkness;   “’aliveness’ emerges out of deadness” (Meares, 2000, p.145).   
 
Carl Kerényi, on the etymology of the mysteries says: 
…the Mysteria begin for the mystes when, as sufferer of the event, he closes his 
eyes, falls back as it were into his own darkness, enters into the darkness.  The 
Romans use the term “going-into,” “in-itia” (in the plural), not only for this 
initiating action, the act of closing the eyes, the myesis, which is exactly rendered 
as initiatio, but for the Mysteria themselves.  A festival of entering into the 
darkness, regardless of what issue and ascent this initiation may lead to: that is 
what the Mysteria were, in the original sense of the word.  
(Kerényi, 1944/1978, p.39) 
 
Entering the darkness.  I sense it is about entering the darkness of the body.  As 
Walter Otto says, image is at the core of the process: 
…the climax of the Eleusinian Mysteries was not a ritual, or anything which the 
mystes did or physically experienced, but a vision…”Happy is he who has seen 
it!” says the Homeric Hymn, directly relating the vision to the assurance of a 

82
favored lot in the other world.  As all witnesses agree, everything was a 
preparation for this vision. 
(Otto, 1939/1978, p. 23) 
 
Neuroscientist, Antonio Damasio says that: 
...consciousness...is a feeling that accompanies the making of any kind of image – 
visual, auditory, tactile, visceral – within our living organisms.  
(Damasio, 1999, p.26) 
 
Consciousness begins when brains acquire the power...of telling a story without 
words...Consciousness emerges when this primordial story – the story of an object 
causally changing the state of the body – can be told using the universal nonverbal 
language of body signals.  (Damasio, 1999, pp. 30-31) 
 
...the body, as represented in the brain, may constitute the indispensable frame of 
reference for the neural processes that we experience as the mind...   
(Damasio, 1999, p. xvi) 
 
This is crucial.  Consciousness is the ‘feeling that accompanies the making of any 
kind of image’.  This is aliveness.  Consciousness is aliveness.  Aliveness from deadness.  
The vision in the darkness. 
 
 
Dream Images 
 
Dream images inform my process long before I know what they mean. 
 
I am in an old school corridor, now used only for storage.  I see an old A-frame 
for a backpack, like my father had from his father, but instead of a backpack, attached to 
the frame are a pair of wings. 
 

83
I dream I am being chased.  I run out onto a pier.  It is night.  The sea is dark and 
stormy.  I am being pushed into the sea.  I am almost drowning.  Two children come.  
They throw wings to me.  
 
Wings from the Deep emerges years later. 
 
After the flood symposium32, I dream of swimming in the shallows of a warm sea 
bay, diving for smooth coloured rocks.  Jewels from the sea.  I emerge from the water to 
see the image of a winged snake.

84
Years later in Hans Leisegang’s erudite essay on The mystery of the serpent, I discover 
the winged snake: 
The inside of the bowl, which first attracts our attention, has at the center a 
winged snake – one wing is broken off – twined around an egg-shaped 
omphalos... 
(Leisegang, 1939/1978, p. 195) 
 
 
Figure 21. The alabaster “serpent bowl”: interior. 
 
I come to know that this winged snake is intimately related to Eros-Phanes and Dionysus, 
figures integral to the mythos of this work. 
...the inscription on the bowl refers to the Orphic Helios-Zeus-Dionysus-Phanes 
and since this Phanes is described in one fragment as having “the body and form 
of a serpent,” the snake on the bowl is evidently the Orphic Phanes.  It has his 
golden wings, and the double crown of flames which we see in the Phanes relief 
and in many representations of Helios.  
(Leisegang, 1939/1978, pp. 216-217) 

85
 
Some time after the performance of Wings 
from the Deep in Bulgaria, I dream of the holocaust 
room.  Dark.  A figure is trapped there.  See Figure 
22. 
 
Years later I am introduced to the diaries of 
Etty Hillesum34 and my imaginative relationship to 
the Holocaust is extended from images into a process 
that is also worded and integral to the writing of this 
thesis. 
 
I remember the dream images.  I remember 
their emotional power.  They inform the process.  
Sometimes I paint them.  Sometimes the images 
become part of poetry or theatre. 
 
...when Jung says the dream has a dramatic 
structure he is saying it has a dramatic logic, 
that there is a Dionysian logos and this is the 
logic of theater.  The dream is not only 
psychic nature, it also presents psychic 
logic...if psychotherapy is to understand the dreaming soul from within, it had 
best turn to ‘theatrical logic’.  The nature of the mind as it presents itself most 
immediately has a specific form: Dionysian form...Dionysos’s own art form, 
theatrical poetics. 
(Hillman, 1995, p. 37)

Linguistic Beginnings 
 
The origins of the imagistic language that formed Wings From the Deep and later 
this thesis, began earlier in a performance called Artistories35. 
 
The creative foundations of the performance included the study of language for 
one year.  I immersed myself in the cultural sounds and structures of my history through 
the Russian and German languages.  I also studied the indigenous languages of this land, 
Australia. 
 
I immersed myself in a linguistic 
expression of cultural forms: a unique set 
of sounds, a particular thinking structure, a 
mythos36.  Over the course of the year, the 
languages formed two thinking and feeling 
bodies in my imagination: one Russian 
Jewish, one German.  The languaged mind 
became embodied.  I was then able to 
inhabit these bodies and write from within 
them.  Empathy.   
 
 
                                                
35 Artistories, pronounced Artist-Stories, was a project inspired by Jungian Analyst Glenda Cloughley.  
Dancer Niki Shepherd, and myself Visual Artist worked with local theatre director Eulea Kiraly on two 
separate but related performances together titled Artistories. Glenda Cloughley oversaw the process with 
particular attention to mythology and archetypes.  The title Artistories was based on an earlier poem I had 
written titled artist story (Australian National Capital Artists, 1996, p. 40).  With funding from Temenos “a 
circle of friends interested in cultural applications of Jungian ideas” (quote from Artistories theatre 
program, 1997) we were able to launch a week long season at The Street Theatre, Canberra, in February 
1997.  Artistories was so successful that we were invited to perform in Canberra twice more that year, with 
a short season in October at the Festival of Contemporary Arts, Ralph Wilson Theatre, Gorman House and 
as the opening event for the Australian National Art Therapy Association’s national conference in 
Canberra.  On that November evening, Glenda Cloughley presented a short paper titled “Artistories: 
Therapeutic Reflections”.  She says: “This is about the connection between the human and the divine...the 
deeper we go into our own stories and the big stories we belong to, the more we discover of this link, and 
the greater is our experience of wholeness.” (quote from Artistories ANATA performance program, 1997). 
36 I think of language as a mythos.  I elaborate this idea in the section on language, p. 218. 
 
Figure 23. Anna Hueneke.  
Boat from Germany. 1997. 

87
I wrote the story of Wolf escaping the Russian army in Russian.  I wrote the story 
of Friedrich and his daughter Clara in German.   At first these stories, these languages, 
became part of the background of a set of small paintings exploring my relationship, as 
someone from a migrant background, to Australia. 
 
 
Figure 24. Anna Hueneke. Outside and Inside the Land. 1997. 
 
Later these stories became the background soundscape for the performance.  I 
painted in response to these imaginal bodies, these historical bodies, these migrant 
bodies.  Initially though I was never going to paint onstage.  I worked with theatre 
director Eulea Kiraly and two esteemed local actors, Virginia Anderson and Simon 
Clarke.  We workshopped the performance over several weeks with the idea that 
Anderson and Clarke would embody the stories by physically acting them out.  But after 
a short break and a lengthy discussion between the two actors they confronted the 
director and myself insisting that I paint.  It had to be my body onstage, the body of the 
artist, and I had to be painting.  It was less than a week to opening night.  We realised the 
most alive response would be an improvised one.  So large sheets of thick paper were 
prepared and the two actors became the English speaking storytellers, translating the 
Russian and German for the audience, while I painted.

Figure 27. Anna Hueneke. Artistories III.  Canberra, 1997. 
 
But I also had to address the audience.  This was a direct conversational form, an 
imagistic form.  It had to be emotive, informative and symbolic, as an image is.  For this 
languaging I worked closely with Kiraly.  Her sensitivity to the imagery and her 
experience of the theatrical conversation informed this process.  She taught me how to be 
sparse and spare with strong imagistic language.  A language of emotion.  The language 
of theatre. 
 
 
There is a place where these two stories meet. 
 
It’s on a boat, coming from Europe, on its way to Australia. 
 
In the sea, the rocking of the sea, a love story begins. 
 
Eggs are born.  Tiny precious eggs. 
But the journey is rough, the seas are rough, and history and memory play their 
part. 
Some eggs are broken. 
That sacred boat, became a warzone. 
(Hueneke, 1997)

Figure 28. Anna Hueneke. Artistories IV. Canberra, 1997. 
 
This performance held within it the movement from deadness to aliveness.  The 
theatre space became my art studio, the place where I take these tragic stories to find life 
within them. 
I went to my studio. 
There I found the other beloved, the one within. 
In that sacred space I could transform the pain into beauty. 
(Hueneke, 1997) 
 
 
In a subsequent season of Artistories at the Festival of Contemporary Arts later 
that year, the end of the story changed in response to the events of my life.   
 
I take that dark soul back to my studio. 
 
I paint and the fire begins. 
(Hueneke, 1997) 
 
The imagery changed too.  It included a fiery bird.  An egg.  A boat.  I look back now and 
see wings emerging from the ark.

The Artistories performance was a highly condensed and symbolised form of my 
life.  An intensified, imagistic narrative that included sound, language, music and large 
expressive body gestures in paint.  This experience of my own body painting in a theatre 
space was formative.  I could feel my body and its expressive capacity contained.  Later 
that same year, back in my studio, the dancing figure emerged.  Through the theatre 
experience I came to know the psychodynamic body.  A body that could paint through 

92
trauma to aliveness.  At the moment of the performance I also experienced a place where 
body, image and word were one.  A new language.  A vital learning.

The Dionysian Body 
 
After Artistories I began work on the myth of Ariadne, Dionysus and the 
Minotaur.  The dancing figure became a vital linguistic foundation in forming a language 
of the body in the context of the myth.

The physical experience of the body, my body painting, in the theatre, informed 
this series of images. 
 
Figure 33. Anna Hueneke. Minotaur, Man with Bull Mask37. 1997. 
 
Dionysus is the god of the theatre and the Dionysian body is a tenaciously alive 
body.  Mythologically Dionysus is thrice born.  Born in the Underworld, killed off, split 
apart, fragmented, destroyed, and then miraculously reconstituted and born again.  Then 
again, plucked from the burning embers of his mother’s body and saved (San Roque, 
1998).   
…to live in the body is very difficult and alien for us, as alien as the Greeks 
imagined the origins of Dionysus to be...but we can begin to have an awareness of 
the psychological body when we become conscious of our alienation from the 
body, when we become conscious of how easy it is to lose our connection to it.  
 
                                                
37 The bull mask (Figures 32 and 33) is an important symbol of the Dionysian mythology and theatrical 
practice and has its roots in much earlier fertility rituals (Gimbutas, 1991, pp.178-180). 

94
Through this consciousness, if we are patient, we can grow into a relationship 
with the body and form a possible psychological connection to it. 
 
In modern psychology, as with Dionysus, there is very little discussion 
about the psychic body and our connection to it.  But here, in the context of the 
body, is the place to discuss Dionysus and the theater.  The art of Dionysus par 
excellence is seen in the theater.  We cannot conceive of a good actor who does 
not have a consciousness of the body.  One’s thoughts move into the fascinating 
field of the actor’s training, a discipline in which the psychology of the body 
becomes a painful reality and words and the body of the actor must come together 
in a Dionysiac consciousness.  Such a combination of words and body constellate 
the Dionysiac strata of the psyche not only in the actor but also in the 
psychotherapist.  (Lopez-Pedraza, 2000, p. 52) 
 
What is the emptiness that the dionysian body enters?  The theatrical space. The 
therapeutic space.  The artist’s studio.  The blank page.  In the unenlivened, lost, unloved 
and dissociated lies the potential membrane to a new body.  
 
What body can go into the mysteries of darkness and create life: the dionysian 
body.  The dionysian body is expressed in the hasidic fervour that Martin Buber 
describes. 
The hasidim could not model the tales they told in praise of their zaddikim on a 
literary form either extant or in the making, nor could they wholly adapt them to 
the style of tales current among the people.  The inner tempo of the hasidim is 
frequently too impassioned, too violent for the calm form of such tales, a form 
which could not contain the abundance of what they had to say. 
 
(Buber, 1947/1991, pp. xviii-xix) 
 
Performance painting became my impassioned form to express the dionysian 
body.  For me this dionysian body is the psychodynamic body.  This body is the basis of 
my work, as artist, performer, therapist and writer. 
 

95
Images from the Psychodynamic Body 
 
To express the psychodynamic body, I begin with the body.  What is in my body?  
What does my body want to express?  These are always my questions.  I paint with my 
body.  Image from body.  Body is instinct.  Image is instinct. 
 
The primacy of images means that they are in the realm of cognition what 
instinctual activity is on the conative-affective level.  In the realm of mind, 
instinct is perceived in images.  (p. 174, 1975, Hillman) 
 
…the body provides the substrate, the anatomical structures and physiological 
mechanisms that underpin and provide the foundation for symbolic thought. 
(Knox, 2004, p. 3) 
 
I make embodied images.  Every colour, every mark, every texture is related to a 
felt reality.  A somatic reality.  Paint is symbolic soma. 
 
…an old Mangalili artist from Arnhem Land, placing three ochres and some white 
clay before him, demonstrates: 
The red rock, he said, was his blood, the yellow rock his fat, the black 
rock his skin and the white clay his bones.  These colours made up his 
palette… 
 
(as cited in Hoffert et al., 1988, p.174) 
 
In making images for Wings from the Deep I began with soma.  
 
Salt comes first.  Salt as preserver.  Bitter salt holds deeper waters.

Clay is integral to the flood story: “...all the human beings had turned to clay! 
(Kovacs, 2000, p. 101)”.  This is the first breath of the winged body, out of the clay. 
 
 
Figure 38. Anna Hueneke. Clay. 2002 
 
The first breath.  Feeling into the lungs.  Breathing.  Asthma.  Breathing.  Black 
hole.  The fine membrane of the lungs.  Fine membrane between blackness and breath.  
Breathing into it.  Breath.

Blood turns to life. 
 
 
Figure 41. Anna Hueneke. Blood to Wings.  2002. 
 
Even these simple images contain narratives. The salt holds depth.  The blue 
water is related to the black of death.  The flood.  Wings in the blackness.  The clay 
figure buried takes its first breath.  Breathing into darkness.  Something is rising, 
becoming alive.  The figures arise from the blood.  Narratives.  The body feelings present 
their own narrative.  I move to larger pieces of paper.  The narratives begin to weave 
together.

At the same time in the Wings from the Deep creative process, we were searching 
for narrative.  I did a painting performance.  A first draft.  There was no formed structure.  
A mess.  But from this necessary body mess something was emerging. 

102
 
 
Figures 44 & 45. Anna Hueneke. Wings from the Deep Rehearsal. 2003. 

103
It began to become clear, images were forming.  Archetypal images.  From body 
to image.  Archetypal images were structuring the narrative.  A narrative was forming.  A 
mythos. 
To complete the collective context, personality is amplified by mythological 
parallels.  Myths give another dimension to the present plight.  For Jung, myths 
describe the behaviour of the archetypes; they are dramatic descriptions in 
personified language of psychic processes….to understand one’s mess, one seeks 
the mythical pattern, for its mythical personalities (the archetypal figures) and 
their behaviour give the clues to what is happening in our behaviour.  The 
ultimate context of personality are the myths which the personality is enacting. 
(Hillman, 1975, p. 180) 
 
I was becoming powerfully related to the myth of the flood.  I was learning the 
narrative of the myth’s psychic states, its ‘archetypal figures’. 
 
At the same time I was reading, gathering words.  Word images.  Each quote 
created an image.  Much like the use of quotes in this thesis.  They are images.  They 
become part of the conversation.  The flow of images.  The inner conversation. 
 
I gathered all my images, gathering them around themes38.  I was developing a 
mythos: salt, the ark, rain and tears, flood, war, madness, death, bones, birds, blood, Eros 
and the “Mouth of the Rivers” (Kovacs, 2000, p. 103).  I had a structure for the narrative.  
Twelve.  In the theatre studio I put up 12 large blank sheets of paper.  Twelve archetypal 
moments.  Twelve imagistic points of reference.  On each panel I attached excerpts from 
the myth, photos of my research paintings, quotes from artists, copies of artists’ images, 
quotes from psychological thinkers such as Jung, Freud and others, as well as the 
beginnings of poetry of my own.   
 
                                                
38 I had assistance for this from Jungian Analyst Craig San Roque as well as the two theatre professionals 
Fiona Navilly and Joe Woodward, who worked with me on the creative development of Wings from the 
Deep; all of us working to identify the archetypes in the imagery. 

104
With co-writer, Fiona Navilly, we began to craft the script for Wings from the 
Deep.  We wrote to the content of each panel.  Body to image to word.  Cyclical.  Fiona 
had a particular capacity to write imagistic words.  We would choose an important 
evocative word, then build word pictures around it.  We worked associatively.  We 
worked imagistically.  Both of us, from years of working in the arts, attuned to the 
imagistic process.   
 
We had worked together before.  With a group of women. Where images were 
frightening.  Where self expression created unbearable anxiety.  We worked slowly.  
Draw a face.  Now add a word to the face.  Now draw another face with a different 
emotion.  Now add a word to that face.  Slowly.  Slowly.  Now make a mask from that 
face.  The mask is safe.  The mask has its own story39.  We began to enter the theatrical 
body.  Now draw the body.  Now add words to that body.  Believe in those words.  Use 
those words and those images to make the costumes for the characters.  Use those words 
and those images to make a story.  Body to image to word.  A script was formed.  Songs 
were formed.  We worked together and with several other artists40.  Inching forward for a 
year towards the performance of Wonderful Women Wearing Masks41. 
 
 
Figure 46.  Wonderful Women Wearing Masks Flyer.  2003. 
                                                
39 Although I never spoke about it with the women I had the Dionysian mysteries/mythology in my mind 
throughout the project.  It was fascinating to see how effective the mask was as a creative device, both 
psychologically and theatrically.  With the masks on, the women felt emboldened to tell their stories. 
40Clothing designers Mary Murray and Helen Cathles assisted the women to create the costumes from 
inside to outside the body.  Musician and actress Chrissie Shaw helped the women to sing with full voices 
and then to use that confidence to put the stories they wrote with Fiona and I to music. 
41 This was a project funded by the ACT Government through Healthpact and the YWCA for residents of 
ACT Housing.  The group of women met weekly at the BAC Flats near Civic in Canberra.  I became 
Artistic Co-ordinator for the group in June 2002, working over the course of a year, towards the final 
performance of Wonderful Women Wearing Masks at The Street Theatre, Canberra in 2003. 

105
This history informed our process in Wings from the Deep.  Image to word image.  
We created poetries of word images.  The script.   
 
The two of us engaged in an intense creative conversation.  I could present any 
material to Fiona and she would respond, with images, words, sounds, writing.  Where 
our writing appears in the script, it is two voices as one.  As we had done before we 
worked from primal states through image to word and then narrative structure.  Mythos 
was created from within our creative conversation. 
 
Joe Woodward, theatre director was part of this conversation too.  His role was 
different, sometimes engaged in this intense conversation, but also with an eye to larger 
structures.  He could always see the whole space.  He could fill it with voice, a chorus.  
he could fill it with imagery.  
 
Many other artists worked with us.  The script became embodied.   
 
Jim Sharrock, the drummer, provides the tempo.  The structure.  The imagistic, 
sound footsteps.  Footsteps through the myth.  The drummer is also the storyteller.  He 
reads from the ancient myth.   
 
Moya Simpson, the singer provides the space, the sound texture of each moment.  
Sometimes a sweet song, sometimes a scratched scream.  We ask her to improvise with 
sound.  She tunes in to the embodied intention of the script.  It works.  The words and 
word images inform her sounds. 
 
The chorus provides a body of people. The collective body.  The collective voice.  
The collective body at war.   The collective body split apart by the madness of war.  
Woodward knows this territory.  This territory of darkness.   
 

106
Finally Kimmo Vennonen, the sound artist, and I arrange the narrative.  The 
narrative of sound.  He adds the rain, the stormy sea, and the sound, he finds the sound of 
golden wings. 
 
The sounds.  The embodied sounds.  These artists give sound and language to my 
images.  We are languaging emptiness.  Creating language. 
 
In investigating the origin of language and “after tracing back its history as far as 
we can, we see that the earliest language was anything but intellectual, that it was 
indeed a sort of half-way house between singing and speech with long almost 
conglomerations of sounds, which served rather as an outlet for intense feelings 
than for an intelligible expression of them…”  Indeed, even in modern days 
language is employed “by children (and often by grown people), not so much to 
formulate and express thoughts as to give vent to feelings…” 
(Jespersen as cited in Chomsky, 1982, p. 3) 
 
It is in response to this soundscape that I paint in performance.  Embodied 
painting.  I never know what will occur on the large blank paper.  I am nervous for days.  
I keep disciplined.  I stay in the body.  No alcohol.  I keep the disciplined body.  
Discipline and focus.  I want to stay connected.  Connected to the psychodynamic body.  
That is what I take with me in to the performance. 
 
 
Entering the Theatrical Space 
 
When I am performing.  I listen carefully to the soundtrack.  I follow what is in my body 
and my mind.  I follow the imagination.  I use the body to make marks.  The body is my 
paintbrush.  Body to imagination. Imagination to mark making.  
...I still think people can’t be reduced to psychological formulae, that only the 
artist can render human beings down to their last irrational elements. 
(Hillesum, 1983, p. 26) 

107
Performance Prologue 
 
Antonin Artaud who lived from 1896 to 1948 has inspired many forms of theatre 
including the ‘theatre of the absurd’, avant garde drama, theatrical happenings and 
performance art.  Artaud was a man who knew madness (Schumacher, 1991, pp. xxvi-
xxx).  He took this embodied madness into the contained space of theatre in a search for 
transformation, “Like the plague theatre is a crisis resolved either by death or cure” 
(Artaud, 1964/1995, pp. 20-22). 
 
Like Artaud, I entered the theatre in search of transformation.  Into this space I 
took the intergenerational embodiments of trauma: bitterness, grief, flooding rage, 
madness and death.  I took these ‘archetypal’ states into the space in a form as close to 
their original instinctive and embodied form as I could.  I bombarded myself with 
emotive cues to respond to.  I created a symbolic flood/war.  I wanted to immerse myself 
in it.  Like Artaud, in the midst of this madness I was searching for movement, life, 
‘cure’. 
 
I entered that hermetic vessel, to discover intuitive themes.  I entered the theatre 
to create a new poetry.  Poetry in space, ‘language in space’, “...the notion of language 
belonging to theatre could be fused with the notion of a language in space, such as might 
appear on a stage...things will be stripped of their immediate meaning and will be given a 
new one” (Artaud, 1991, p. 119).  This is the language of the impassioned body, the 
dionysian body.  I was searching to understand, flood, madness and death on their own 
terms, in terms of theatrical logic.  I was wanting to get inside these feelings, find their 
movement. 
...if psychotherapy is to understand the dreaming soul from within, it had best turn 
to ‘theatrical logic’.  The nature of mind as it presents itself most immediately has 
a specific form: Dionysian form...Dionysos’s own art form; theatrical poetics.  
(Hillman, 1995, p. 37). 
 

108
Kristeva refers to Artaud’s writing as “unblended genotext”, a poetic language 
unmitigated by external constraints (Roudiez, 1984, p. 5).  This is the discipline of 
entering the internal world.  It has its own logic.  The logic of the mysteries of life 
coming into being.  Greek scholar Walter Burkett, in his 1999 paper The Logic of 
Cosmogony, writes that: “It is from mortification, from the corpse, that the new and 
stable structure takes its beginning.” 
 
I entered the contained space of theatre to physically embody imagery, to try and 
discover something about the movement inherent in psychotherapy.  To generate an 
embodied experience and then understanding of ‘theatrical logic’, ‘language in space’, 
‘stream of consciousness’, and ‘aliveness from deadness’.42  
 
 
The ‘costume’ that I wear for the performance was inspired by the vulture figures 
on the walls of the shrine at Çatal Hüyük, “On the north wall is the vulture with human 
legs...representing the priestesses dressed as vultures for the performance of the funerary 
rite...” (Cameron, 1981, p.30).  I am clothed in black and winged. 
                                                
42 This embodied experience was internalised, and from it I could then elaborate on the psychotherapeutic 
process, as I have done in further chapters after Wings from the Deep. 

109
Wings from the Deep43

43 Wings from the Deep was performed at the international conference Re-creating the World.  The 
Transformative Power of Arts and Play in Psychotherapy hosted by the Society for C. G. Jung, Bulgaria, 
September 2003.  
Wings from the Deep: concept and creative development, Anna Hueneke; performance painter, 
Anna Hueneke; co-scriptwriters, Fiona Navilly and Anna Hueneke; theatrical advisor, Joe Woodward; 
sound design, Kimmo Vennonen; Singer, Moya Simpson; Singer, Jacqui Bradley; drumming, percussion 
and voice, Jim Sharrock; voice, Kate Harris; voice of Jung and Beckmann, Hermann Pretorius; voice of 
Bones and Death, Joe Woodward; voice of Rothko, Jeremy Yapp; Chorus Director, Joe Woodward; and 
Chorus of voices, students from Daramalan College.  I acknowledge all those involved in Dreaming the 
Deep (footnoted in the Introduction), the matrix from which Wings from the Deep emerged. 
I include the script here as it was written in 2003, but slightly adapted to the thesis format, 
including referencing, and the photos of the performance in Bulgaria.  The CD soundtrack - that I produced 
in Canberra, took to Bulgaria and painted in response to - is included at the back of this thesis.   
The DVD of the performance in Bulgaria is also included at the back of this thesis.  It includes an 
introduction by Jungian Analyst Craig San Roque (with translation into Bulgarian by Art Historian Kristin 
Razsolkova) who makes reference to the Sugarman Project (San Roque, 1998) which the audience has just 
seen on video (Roberts, 2000).  This is an example, along with my performance, of the work in Cultural 
Psychology at the University of Western Sydney.  At the end of the performance San Roque invites the 
artists in the audience to respond.  Ethnomusicologist and Anthropologist, Daniela Ivanova sings a song 
about soldiers dying and yet flowers still growing in the Spring, (from the Rhodope Mountains of 
Bulgaria), and Jungian Analyst and Dancer, Paulo Pereira gently steps into the painting and responds in 
movement.  This response retains the conversation between the performance and the audience in an 
imagistic form. 
As the DVD does not always show the artist’s images that were projected on the screen behind me 
I include them here with the text.  The images from artists Kollwitz and Munch appear in the included 
performance photos.  
44 I begin with a bowl of salt, a symbol of the bitterness that has been carried for generations, also of the 
residue left by the flooding salt waters. 

110
Salt 
 
In the salt is the memory of betrayal 
Betrayal by the mother of life itself 
Forsaking all to die in the mud 
The wound is etched onto time and history 
Salt is rubbed into the wound, forever 
Bitter sarcasm comes 
Quick and sharp, cutting, biting 
at soft insides. 
 
Wall of rock hiding the face of the lost mother, 
Can we see her appearing? 
 
 
Figure 48.  Anna Hueneke. Wings from the Deep II. Bulgaria, 2003. 
 
I was in a house I did not know, which had two stories.  It was “my house.”  I 
found myself in the upper story, where there was a kind of salon furnished with 
fine old pieces in rococo style.  On the walls hung a number of precious old 
paintings.  I wondered that this should be my house, and thought, “Not bad.”  But 
then it occurred to me that I did not know what the lower floor looked like.  

111
Descending the stairs, I reached the ground floor.  There everything was much 
older, and I realised that this part of the house must date from about the fifteenth 
or sixteenth century.  The furnishings were medieval; the floors were of red brick.  
Everywhere it was rather dark.  I went from one room to another, thinking, “Now 
I really must explore the whole house.”  I came upon a heavy door, and opened it.  
Beyond it, I discovered a stone stairway that led down into the cellar.  Descending 
again, I found myself in a beautifully vaulted room which looked exceedingly 
ancient.  Examining the 
walls, I discovered layers of 
brick among the ordinary 
stone blocks, and chips of 
brick in the mortar.  As soon 
as I saw this I knew that the 
walls dated from Roman 
times.  My interest by now 
was intense.  I looked more 
closely at the floor.  It was 
of stone slabs, and in one of 
these I discovered a ring.  
When I pulled it, the stone 
slab lifted, and again I saw a 
stairway of narrow stone 
steps leading down into the 
depths.  These, too, I 
descended, and entered a low cave cut into the rock.  Thick dust lay on the floor, 
and in the dust were scattered bones and broken pottery, like the remains of a 
primitive culture.  I discovered two human skulls, obviously very old and half 
disintegrated.  Then I awoke.   
(Jung, 1989, pp. 158-159)45 
                                                
45 Jung’s dream symbolises the process of this thesis work, of going down into ancient depth, the 
archaeological dig.

The Ark 
 
The Story of the Flood 
 
...I will reveal to you…a thing that is hidden, 
a secret of the gods I will tell you! 
 
...The hearts of the Great Gods moved them to inflict the Flood. 
Their father Anu uttered the oath (of secrecy)... 
 
Ea, the clever Prince...was under oath with them  
so he repeated their talk to the reed house: 
 
 
‘...Tear down the house and build a boat! 
 
 
Abandon wealth and seek living beings! 
 
 
Spurn possessions and keep alive living beings! 
 
 
Make all living beings go up into the boat. 
 
 
The boat which you are to build, 
 
 
its dimensions must measure equal to each other: 
 
 
its length must correspond to its width…’ 
 
Just as dawn began to glow 
the land assembled around me – 
the carpenter carried his hatchet, 
the reed worker carried his...stone… 
The child carried the pitch,  
the weak brought whatever else was needed. 
On the fifth day I laid out her exterior. 
It was a field in area, 
its walls were each 10 times 12 cubits in height, 
the sides of its top were of equal length, 10 times 12 cubits each. 
I laid out its (interior) structure and drew a picture of it... 

113
I provided it with six decks, 
thus dividing it into seven... 
The inside of it I divided into nine... 
I drove plugs (to keep out) water in its middle part. 
I saw to the punting poles and laid in what was necessary. 
Three times 3,600 (units) of raw bitumen I poured into the bitumen kiln, 
three times 3,600 (units of ) pitch…into it… 
 
 
Figure 50.  Anna Hueneke. Wings from the Deep IV. Bulgaria, 2003. 
 
The boat was finished by sunset. 
The launching was very difficult. 
They had to keep carrying a runway of poles front to back, 
until two-thirds of it had gone into the water... 
Whatever I had I loaded on it: 
whatever silver I had I loaded on it, 
whatever gold I had I loaded on it. 
All the living beings that I had I loaded on it, 
I had all my kith and kin go up into the boat, 
all the beasts and animals of the field and the craftsmen I had go up. 
(Kovacs, 2000, pp. 97-100) 

114
Rain/Tears 
 
Waters of the heart 
These soft tears 
loosen my vision 
lead me on 
into my grief and longing 
 
 
Figure 51.  Anna Hueneke. Wings from the Deep V. Bulgaria, 2003. 
 
Waters of the heart 
Cry out 
and the waters grow 
 
Waters of the heart 
overflow 
enter the body 

115
enter the water 
enter the ocean 
abandon.

Flood 
In the morning he let loaves of bread shower down, 
and in the evening a rain of wheat. 
I watched the appearance of the weather- 
the weather was frightful to behold! 
I went into the boat and sealed the entry. 
(Kovacs, 2000, p. 100) 
 
The darkness is suffocating us 
Thunder shakes us 
Water, cold and alien overpowers 
An ominous roar can be heard 
as we run towards higher ground 
 
But some of us find nothing 
but the cold bitter waters of death. 
A silence swallows the screams 
as the bodies sink down, down, down, 
into the deep. 
 
 
Figure 53.  Anna Hueneke. Wings from the Deep VI. Bulgaria, 2003. 

117
All I thought to be real is obliterated by the flooding rage, 
this rage of flood, 
with which I struggle for uncertain future. 
 
Stunned shock…overtook the heavens, 
and turned to blackness all that had been light. 
The…land shattered like a …pot. 
All day long the South Wind blew…, 
blowing fast, submerging the mountain in water, 
overwhelming the people like an attack. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 54.  Anna Hueneke. Wings from the Deep VII. Bulgaria, 2003. 
 
No one could see his fellow, 
they could not recognize each other in the torrent. 
The gods were frightened by the Flood, 
and retreated, ascending to the heaven… 
The gods were cowering like dogs, crouching by the outer wall. 
Ishtar shrieked like a woman in childbirth, 
the sweet-voiced Mistress of the Gods wailed: 
 
 
 

118
‘The olden days have alas turned to clay, 
 
 
because I said evil things in the Assembly of the Gods! 
 
 
How could I say evil things in the Assembly of the Gods, 
 
 
ordering a catastrophe to destroy my people?! 
 
  
No sooner have I given birth to my dear people 
 
 
than they fill the sea like so many fish!’ 
The gods…were weeping with her, 
the gods humbly sat weeping, sobbing with grief... 
their lips burning, parched with thirst. 
Six days and seven nights 
came the wind and flood, the storm flattening the land.

46 This artwork, by an Australian artist originally from England, created between the two world wars, 
depicts a profound connection between the Dionysian and flood mythologies, also including indigenous 
Australians in the themes.  I first discovered this remarkable work in Edwards, 1989, p. 58.

War 
 
When the seventh day arrived, the storm was pounding, 
the flood was a war – struggling with itself like a woman writhing (in labour).

Still more violent 
Still more forceful 
More cannot be endured

Uncontrolled

driven by its own violence 
its marauding consumption 
Taking life into its own  
Violent hands 
It ravages everything 
consuming it, devouring it 
It must eat itself

devastation 
charred and blackened.

Chorus: 
The Blood obscures my vision49 
but I still see you 
“Leave me alone, God!” 
The sky is red 
With Nature’s screaming 
I am bracing my self… 
…I can still stand 
See what they have done to me? 
The blood…my eyes…but still… 
 
 
                                                
49 Inspiration for this section of writing came from Trotsky’s violent death: “I took the...ice axe...out of my 
pocket, took it in my fist and, closing my eyes, I gave him a tremendous blow on the head...” (as cited in 
Sinclair, 1972, p. 444).  “Trotsky saw Hansen through the blood now covering his eyes and weakly said, 
“See what they have done to me!”” (as cited in Sinclair, 1972, p. 445).

50 This section relates the death of Trotsky to the mythological death of Dionysus in the underworld where 
he is hacked to pieces by the Titans (Nonnos as cited in Evans, 1988, p. 154).  Unlike Trotsky’s death 
though Dionysus is miraculously returned to life when all the pieces are cooked up together by his 
grandmother Rea.  “She cooks up the pieces,” is a line from Craig San Roque’s interpretation of the myth 
in his script for Sugarman, a performance developed over many years with indigenous communities in 
Central Australia and the creative foundation of his doctoral work Intoxication, University of Western 
Sydney, 1998.

Death 
 
 
Figure 63. Mark Rothko. The Rothko Chapel. 1964-67. 
 
The sea calmed, fell still, the whirlwind (and) flood stopped up. 
I looked around all day long – quiet had set in 
and all the human beings had turned to clay! 
The terrain was as flat as a roof. 
I opened a vent and fresh air...fell upon the side of my nose. 
I fell to my knees and sat weeping, 
tears streaming down the side of my nose.  (Kovacs, 2000, p. 101)

Bones 
 
Bind up the bones in my back and neck.  Wind the sheets tight around 
me…Bind my neck and back for me.  Put up the knife, gather my bones and place 
them in my body.  Bind me tight that I may walk.  Bind me sturdy that I may stalk 
after death and strike a blow with the broad, flat sword of my will.  I dig my feet 
into earth.  I toss my head to the sky.  I am a man living in two worlds.  I am a 
man with two eyes on two legs walking home.  Bind my vertebrae with thick 
grapevines dipped in saffron and water.  Cover me with a blanket of sky. (Ellis, 
1988, p.122) 
 
 
Figure 65. Anna Hueneke. Wings from the Deep XIII. Bulgaria, 2003. 
 
It is as if I had seen my bones for the first time and knew how they fit 
together, how fitting is the nature of a man to walk.  It is as if I fell in love with 
my bones and was born in their form…This body is the book of all I remember.  
These are the bones of a living god.  I am the reed from which words flow.  Bind 
up my legs, my back and neck.  These bones know where I’ve been.

Birds 
 
I looked around for coastlines in the expanse of the sea, 
and at twelve leagues there emerged a region (of land). 
On Mt. Nimush the boat lodged firm, 
Mt. Nimush held the boat, allowing no sway. 
One day and a second Mt. Nimush held the boat, allowing no sway. 
A third day, a fourth, Mt. Nimush held the boat, allowing no sway. 
A fifth day, a sixth, Mt. Nimush held the boat, allowing no sway. 
When a seventh day arrived 
I sent forth a dove and released it. 
The dove went off, but came back to me; 
no perch was visible so it circled back to me… 
I sent forth a raven and released it. 
The raven went off, and saw the waters slither back. 
It eats, it scratches, it bobs, but does not circle back to me.

Blood 
 
I offered incense in front of the mountain-ziggurat. 
Seven and seven cult vessels I put in place, 
and (into the fire) underneath...I poured reeds, cedar, and myrtle. 
The gods smelled the savor, 
the gods smelled the sweet savor…

…In ecstasy I’ll light the great candles for you now in the night, in the deep black

the skies are red at night.

After the Flood 
  
Blood 
 
It is said that from the bloody whip wounds of Saint Clare of Assisi came the 
scent of roses (Largier, 2007). 
 
Menstruation for a woman embodies a birth, death, rebirth process.  Blood is important. 
 
 
Before going to Bulgaria I dreamt of a group 
of young women running at night through an old 
multi-storeyed building, with many verandahs.  This 
was part of a ritual of becoming a woman.  When I 
arrived in Bulgaria I was astonished that the building 
I was staying in was just like the dream. 
 
One of my research drawings depicted a 
young maiden body with blood dripping down her 
body (see Figure 72). 
 
We worked with the image of blood as 
transformative in the Wings from the Deep script (see 
section titled Blood). 
 
In the lead up to Wings from the Deep, in the 
days of travel from Australia to Europe, and then 
during the first days of the conference, my body 
swelled from within, filling with blood. 
 
My body was full of nascent fertility.  Blood and paint in psychosomatic 
relationship.  Full of blood.  Full of paint.  Full of possibility.

Finally, I painted in Wings from the Deep. 
 
I fell into exhaustion. 
 
I began to bleed.   
 
Something was dying. 
 
 
Saltwater 
 
After the flood, Utanapishtim and his wife went to the “Mouth of the Rivers”, 
(Kovacs, 2000, p. 103). 
 
After the performance there was an overwhelming impulse to take the painting to 
the shore of the sea.  The Black Sea.  Return the painting, return the trauma to its original 
place, the place where the flood began. 
 
 
Figure 73. Collaboration at the Black Sea I. 2003. 
 

139
A natural group53 formed who felt there was more to be done with the painting.  
Together we carried this large painting down to the shore.  Together we wondered how 
this feeling of incompleteness could be resolved.   
 
 
Figure 74. Collaboration at the Black Sea II. 2003. 
 
With very little talking, we worked with the painting.  I felt instinctively it needed 
more water.

Analyst and Analytical Psychologist Craig San Roque and Psychologist and Jungian Analyst Joy Norton 
from Australia, Psychiatrist and Psychotherapist Dmitry Zalessky and Psychologist and Psychotherapist 
Oxana Zalesskaya from the Ukraine, Psychotherapist and Jungian Analyst Janet Robinson from the USA 
and Psychologist and Psychotherapist Yuri Danko also from the Ukraine.

It felt as if the painting wanted to be immersed in water.  Saltwater, cleansing.  
Saltwater. We placed it in the sea.

know what body.

Contained.  We moved it from the shore to another piece of paper.  Ready for a new 
journey.

return to us on the wind.  He thought she was a Mava.  A Ukrainian forest spirit.  Body 
bits, images and song.  She was re-emerging.

We carefully wrapped her up feeling that psychodynamically we had returned the 
pieces torn apart by war to the cultural body they belonged to.  Re-embodied experience. 
 
Jungian Analyst Joy Norton, with us at the Black Sea wrote: 
The archetypal realm was free to flow.  Anna painted as a performance; this was 
both a personal and collective expression…This performance felt like a sacred 
return to the source of creation in this place at the Black Sea, in order to 
remember something…The painting created by Anna Hueneke in the conference 
was a sacred performance, an offering to this place of creation, and a waiting to 
experience what arose.  The image of the flood seemed cleansing; as much a 
flooding of feeling as a moment where creation might be fostered away from the 
fleshless, skeleton-man outside life, who cages experience. 
(Norton, 2003, p. 52)

The Rose 
 
Back home in Australia I dream.   
I am in a painting class.  The teacher asks us to paint the city using only shadows.  
I paint the shadows as roses.  Sepia Roses.  A city defined by its shadows.  Rose 
shadows. 
 
I am taken by the rose, by this dream.  I sit in the rose gardens of my own city and 
I paint.   
 
 
Figure 92. Anna Hueneke. First Rose. 2003. 
 
I was bleeding.  Now I am infused with the scent of roses.  I am back in the 
mysteries.  This mystery of the pain of blood.  Red pain.  Red wound.  To beauty and 
fragrance and the subtlety of the rose.  Red rose.  Shadow rose. Building up the shadows. 

149

This careful attention to the rose infuses my psychotherapy practice.  I begin to see each 
client as a different individual rose.  Together, we build up the form through the shadows.     

150
In this mythos, the blood, the rose and the water are linked.  After the blood and 
the rose, I immerse myself in water.  I discover the swimmer.   
 
 
Figure 95. Anna Hueneke. The Swimmer. 2004. 
 
 
The rhythm.  Breathe in. Breathe out.  Breathe in.  Breathe out.  Arms move 
through the water, heavy, push, heavy, pull.  Determined.  Push through the water, follow 
the rhythm.  There is a moment, when it opens up.  The emptiness inside, it’s not 
strangling me.  It opens 
out.  My back opens out.  
I have wings not arms.  I 
am flying through the 
water.  Space.  Space to 
breathe. 
 
 
I am integrating 
new body states.  They 
become part of the 
Australian performance 
of Wings from the Deep54.

The Broken 
 
Crash!  My sister and I wake in fright.  Bleary eyed we wander out.  The kitchen 
floor is covered with broken crockery. 
 
From the broken comes the rose. 
 
I am standing in front of a public sculpture, a memorial to war55.  I am speaking 
with the artist, Matthew Harding, still in the process of completing the artwork.  He is 
telling me about the day of its ceremonial opening. 
 
The central piece of the sculpture was not finished.  The circle of concrete blocks, 
the stone paving and the metal rods, which reached up to the sky to symbolise wings, 
were complete.  But the most detailed, central part of the sculpture was the sphere.  The 
sphere was made of many pieces of thick glass, put together as a small world, which sat 
within the circular space made by the two metal wings.  The artist spoke of arriving in the 
midst of this ceremony, to install the sphere, but the glue had not had time to set around 
some of the pieces of glass.   
 
In front of this silent reverent crowd, breaking glass was heard, “Crash”, and 
“Crash” again, as several of the thick, translucent and greenish hued, glass pieces fell 
onto the stone ground.

“The ACT Memorial was designed by Canberra artist Matthew Harding incorporating representations of 
the world and the overarching goal of peace, and provides a quiet place for remembrance and 
contemplation…The screen takes the form of a large stylised wing or feather acting as an interpretation of 
the Dove of Peace that enfolds and nurtures the memorial space and the central globe.  Stainless steel tubes 
rise from an arc along the concentric ground plane, before spiralling and interweaving into the form of the 
wing/feather above the central ceremonial space…The central sphere acts as a symbol for the world, and as 
a focal point for ceremonial purposes and remembering all those who served, died or volunteered during 
conflicts and on peacekeeping missions throughout the world.”

The artist felt his world, this beautiful glass world, was shattering. 
 
He and his assistant had had six hours of sleep in one week.  They had been on 
their feet the entire time, working furiously to finish for this ceremony.  They were in a 
heightened state of concentration and identification with the sphere.  They were also in a 
physical state of extreme deprivation.  The artist told me that he felt no one was there, at 
the moment of the final installation it was ‘surreal’ arriving with the truck, with this glass 
sphere, and then it shattered. 
…the artist is so identified with his work that his intentions and his faculties are 
indistinguishable from the act of creation itself…  (Jung, 1993, p. 72) 
In such a heightened state this glass sphere was his world, literally. 
 
The artist described how ‘arduous’ the process of making this sculpture had been, 
physically, mentally and emotionally. 
 
Glass shattering, relationships breaking, sleepless nights, feelings of death… 
 
I suggested to him that the presentation of the sculpture had actually been like a 
performance and that this shattering of glass was like a soldier dying, or like war itself.  
The sleeplessness of the artist reminded me of soldiers at the war front unable to sleep for 
fear of death.  The arduousness of his whole creative process reminded me of war.  It 
seemed to me that by creating this memorial to war and death he had also entered the 
archetypal field of this experience both in his own life and in the creative process of 
making the sculpture.   
 
The primordial image, or archetype, is a figure – be it a daemon, a human being, 
or a process – that constantly recurs in the course of history and appears wherever 
creative fantasy is freely expressed.  Essentially, therefore, it is a mythological 
figure. (Jung, 1993, p. 81) 
 

154
As in religious experience where a mythical model is the vehicle for human 
participation in the transcendent reality, the artist gives herself to a prototype –
often mythical in essence – that she internalises and then reenacts or recreates 
through her art. (Yarian, 1982, p. 93) 
 
It is precisely in great art, that the artist remains indifferent in face of the work, 
almost like a channel that annihilates itself in the creative process for the sake of 
the emergence of the work. (Heidegger as cited in Yarian, 1982, p. 93) 
 
 
A Circle of Roses 
 
Over the next few weeks I returned many times to this experience in my thoughts.  
Like the artist I was identifying with the glass sphere.  I felt it was so cold: the green 
glass, the cold stone, the cold response from the dignitaries at the opening, and the 
coldness and aloneness of the creative process.  I had experienced the pressure placed 
upon the individual artist to produce a meaningful image to a large audience.  I identified 
with the shattered glass, and the fragmentation of self.  This was how I had felt after each 
painting performance.  I wanted to respond.  An image came into my mind of the glass 
sphere surrounded by a circle of red rose petals.   
 
At this time I was in the process of completing my training as a psychotherapist.  
This circle of rose petals symbolised my growing capacity to hold others.  During the 
intensity of my training I had the experience of holding my client through a psychotic 
episode.  This circle of roses, and this shattered sphere, echoed that experience. 
 
I returned to the sculpture some weeks later, with a bag of red rose petals.  It was 
a grey Sunday afternoon, there weren’t many people around.  For the first time I had a 
quiet moment with this sculpture and its story of shattered glass.  I placed the rose petals 
inside the wings, in a circle around the sphere.

For me, this form, this sculpture, now felt whole.  The form had life, blood, roses.  
What had been broken now had a circle of aliveness around it.   

156
Safety.  Protection.  Something new could be born.  An egg.  A self. 
 
I began to see the metal wings of the sculpture as the wings of a giant bird deep 
within the earth.  I could only see the tips of the wings above the earth’s crust.  The 
sphere became this giant bird’s egg.

But the Orphics say that black-winged Night, a goddess of whom even Zeus 
stands in awe, was courted by the Wind and laid a silver egg in the womb of 
Darkness; and that Eros, whom some call Phanes, was hatched from this egg and 
set the Universe in motion.  (Graves, 1969, p. 30) 
 
Since including Eros in the Wings from the Deep script I had been waiting and 
searching to understand this mystery of Eros’ birth.  I felt it that day looking at the 
sculpture.  I felt it laying roses in a circle around the sphere.  I saw it when I saw the giant 
bird lying dormant inside the earth, waking with the scent of roses to lay this beautiful 
silvery egg.

I discovered that Eros-Phanes and Dionysus were related. 
 
Melting the glittering ether that had previously been motionless, 
 
he appeared, a glorious sight to the gods, 
 
he whom we now call Phanes and Dionysus... 
 
when he first came to light, he was called Dionysus, 

158
 
because he moves in a circle round the infinite broad Olympus... 
 
(Saturnalia by Macrobius, as cited in Leisegang, 1939/1978, pp. 199-200) 
 
Let us mix the Erotes’ rose with 
Dionysus: let us fasten on our 
brows the rose with its lovely 
petals and drink, laughing gently.  
Rose, finest of flowers, rose, 
darling of spring, rose, delight of 
the gods also, rose with which 
Kythere’s [Aphrodite’s] son [Eros] 
garlands his lovely curls when he 
dances with the Kharites.  (“Greek 
Lyric II  The Anacreontea”) 
 
A circle of roses.  A circle of love.  A circle of fire.  Eros had a hold on me. Red birds, 
red bird-women poured fourth.  Like fire.  Like blood.  Alive.

The God 
 
Like Saint Theresa I felt pierced by the god.  Eros.

In the Villa of Mysteries in Pompeii Jungian Analyst Linda Fierz-David describes 
the state of the initiate after she has witnessed the sacred connection of Ariadne and 
Dionysus as theia mania: 
 
…in enthusiasm, the state of being filled with god, unity with the Dionysus-
Allbeing is experienced.  Dionysian enthusiasm, which is exactly the experience 
of the pneuma, is a theia mania, a divine madness.  For the Greeks, madness was 
originally a divine punishment…but in the cult of Dionysus, the curse becomes a 
mystical gift of grace… (Fierz-David, 1957/1988, pp. 98-99) 
 
The moment I put the rose petals around the sphere, for me, was a moment when I 
was filled with the god, and like the initiate in the Villa of Mysteries this state also had 

161
the quality of a kind of mania.  Something was going to bring me back to earth.  The next 
day my car was involved in a rear end collision.  Like the ‘dark angel’ of Dionysus who 
arrives with a whip to bring the initiate back to ‘modesty’ this car driving into mine 
brought me back to earth. 
What is needed then, perhaps, is a flash of lightning out of the clear sky 
descending like the winged Dionysian pneuma of the seventh scene, to set the 
person straight... (Fierz-David, 1957/1988, pp. 114-115) 
 
 
Figure 110. Villa of Mysteries Detail. 
 
It is the whip of the dark winged angel in the Villa of Mysteries that creates the 
differentiation between the god and the initiate: 
The angel, as manifest bearer of the Dionysian theia mania, stands face to face 
with the initiate.  The angel shows her that it is not she who has the gift of the 
seer.  The Holy Ghost has filled her for a brief moment, and already, with a 
powerful warding-off movement of the hand, the angel cuts off from itself again 
the mortal being who is certainly not “Christ-like.”  Through this appearance – an 
act of grace – the angel differentiates the woman from the higher femininity of 
Sophia, who she herself never is.  (Fierz-David, 1957/1988, p. 101) 
 

162
This differentiation between the archetypal image and the ego brings life and 
clarity.  Similarly Meares differentiates Erasmus’ embodied religious experience, with 
that of St Paul:  
In his Praise of Folly (1511), Erasmus argued that “the whole man” had the 
capacity for a curious state of mind, which he likened to madness or folly, 
although not quite seriously.  He also likened this state to love: 
He who loves intensely no longer lives in himself but in whatever he 
loves, and the more he can depart from himself and enter into the other, 
the happier he is.  And when a mind yearns towards travelling out of the 
body, and does not rightly use its own bodily organs, you doubtless, and 
with accuracy, call the state of it madness. 
This notion seems central to Erasmanian philosophy, but is also fundamental to an 
understanding of empathy.  What is most important, in the state that Erasmus 
described is that one imaginatively inhabits the other person, at the same time 
retaining one’s own “soul.”  Michael Screech points out that his idea was 
revolutionary in that it reversed the teaching of St Paul.  The Pauline assertion 
was “I live, yet not I but Christ liveth in me,” whereas Erasmus suggests that the 
highest form of experiencing involves the capacity to “migrate” into another.  For 
St Paul the movement was in the opposite direction, so that he was inhabited by 
the Christ.” (Meares, 2005, pp. 182-183) 
 
I think this idea that one loses one’s own body when one is inhabited by the god 
has its roots in the change in consciousness that occurred when writing developed.  A 
monotheistic god was created.  Monotheism and written language came together as part 
of a change in consciousness.  The god was also personified as masculine.  At this point 
body was left behind. 
 
 
 
Turning, then, to Hebrew mythology on its own terms, the Great Father 
God Yahweh-Elohim created heaven and earth in the beginning, and what he said 
was so, and he saw that it was good.  Unlike any earlier god, this god creates and 

163
rules alone: he has no lineage, no family, no mother, wife or child.  The world he 
makes and looks upon comes not from his body but from his word.  
(Baring & Cashford, 1993, p.417) 
 
 
The monotheistic editor of the cosmogony in Genesis I and II could assign no part 
in Creation to anyone but God, and therefore omitted all pre-existing elements or 
beings which might be held divine.  Such abstractions as Chaos (tohu wa-bohu), 
Darkness (hosekh), and the Deep (tehom) would, however tempt no worshippers: 
so these took the place of the ancient matriarchal deities.”  (Graves & Patai as 
cited in Baring & Cashford, 1993, p. 419) 
 
Although this shift in consciousness occurred to word, to logos, we do not have to 
leave the body behind.  Embodied empathy is possible.  In the therapeutic conversation, 
image, body and word come together.  My own experience of the word, the god, the 
logos, was an embodied experience.  I was empathising with the sculpture as a body.  A 
body fragmented by war.  I was empathising with the artist’s experience of creating the 
sculpture.  Empathically, I, like him, became identified with the sculpture, and with the 
mythos of war.  The circle of roses was an act of love, a holding embrace around the 
shattered parts of the psychodynamic body.  This led to an experience of the god.  Eros, a 
maddening love, from which, with a whip of the dark angel, I recovered.   Recovered my 
own body.  Embodied experience.  Embodied dualism.  Image with word.  Body with 
Mind. Mythos with Logos.  This is the therapeutic relationship. 
 
In the next scene of the Villa of Mysteries we see the final stage of the initiation ritual. 
A nude woman stretches herself upward, dancing and floating.  She turns her back 
on the onlooker while a beautifully dressed woman, who looks into the Initiation 
Chamber, circles about the nude one with a thyrsus in her hand.  
These two figures have been interpreted by all scholars as the representation of a 
deificatio – that is, a deification – such as forms the conclusion in many ancient 
mystery cults... 

164
The goal of the Orphic mystery cult is, of 
course, not deification of the human being.  
It consists of the definitive liberation of the 
Dionysian spark, which is the immortal 
soul of the human being, and its union with 
Dionysus.  Accordingly, one must 
understand the nude, aspiring figure in the 
eighth scene as a symbol for the divine 
spark in the initiate which, having just been 
freed by the blow of the Dionysian pneuma, 
prepares to soar upward to achieve union 
with the god...the aspiring figure is entirely 
nude, that is, entirely divine, for in 
antiquity, nudity is an attribute of the 
divine.  That the aspiring figure turns her 
back to the onlooker is also very 
significant; it means that she is indeed to be 
sensed in outline, but nevertheless remains 
impenetrable, as indeed, the divine is 
always impenetrable to the human 
being...she clashes the Dionysian cymbals 
in her upraised hands and thereby beats the time or the rhythm for the woman’s 
figure which revolves around her.  This figure of the beautifully dressed woman 
with the thyrsus...she, I believe, is an embodiment of the initiate who has found 
redemption and has learned to know the way which will be right for her... 
(Fierz-David, 1957/1988, pp. 134-135)

I make a drawing, my own interpretation, of this embodied experience.

56 Red Birdwoman I – III (Figures 106 – 108) were images like the naked figure in the Villa of Mysteries 
scene (Figure 111) an ecstatic and erotic expression of the god.  But Red Birdwoman IV (above) is clothed 
and contained, like the second figure, an ‘embodiment of the initiate’.  I drew it immediately after I found 
out I had qualified as a psychotherapist.  It embodies the internal achievement of becoming a 
psychotherapist.

Autonomous Body 
 
The Diasporist – The Wine Maker 
 
I am always packing.  One week at my mother’s house.  Packing bags.  Moving.  
One week at my father’s house.  Packing bags.  Moving.  I learn to pack carefully.  
I fit my life into a suitcase again and again.  Packing.  Moving.  Arriving.  
Unpacking.  Always leaving.  Always arriving.  The traveller. 
 
Dionysus and Noah inhabit the traveller’s body, the body of the diasporist.   
 
Modern artist R. B. Kitaj makes a compelling description of the diasporist in his 
First Diasporist Manifesto. 
 
Diasporist painting, which I just made up, is enacted under peculiar historical and 
personal freedoms, stresses, dislocation, rupture and momentum.  The Diasporist 
lives and paints in two or more societies at once.  Diasporism, as I wish to write 
about it, is as old as the hills (or caves) but new enough to react to today’s 
newspaper or last week’s aesthetic musing or tomorrow’s terror…My case is built 
on a cliché which may also be an insightful art lesson.  It is that the threatened 
condition of the Jews witnesses the condition of our wider world.  It is a 
radical witness.57  (Kitaj, 1989, pp. 19-21.) 
 
The traveller is the ‘radical witness’.  The traveller is archetypal. The traveller 
sees from outside as does the artist.   
 
There is a traditional notion that the divine presence itself is in the Diaspora… 
(Kitaj, 1989, p. 37) 
 
                                                
57 The bold is my emphasis. 

167
The diasporist body.  The Jewish Body.  The immigrant body.  Dionysian body.  
Body of the traveller.  Divine. 
 
I am reminded of Mark Rothko, and his evocative rectangular shapes which 
describe the archetypal experience of the migrant living with the loss of homeland. 
 
 
Figure 113. Mark Rothko. 1957 #20. 1957 
 
I consider that there is a specific connection between the abstract painting of 
America and the experience of exile…I suspect that for such artists the 
psychological longings surrounding the person of the mother, phase and merge 
into cultural longings.  The life of an exile is dominated by the absent presence of 
the mother-land.  This acute, private accentuation of cultural displacement 
paradoxically enables these painters to touch upon a widely experienced sense of 
alienation or dislocation.  To use Bion’s language...it need not surprise us if the 

168
exile of the immigrant is acutely attuned to the inadequacies of the geometer’s 
space and to the presence of the absence within him of a continent that is 
elsewhere. (Fuller, 1981, p. 231) 
 
Absence of body.  The empty space.  Rothko painted this space, this enormous 
space.  But his body wanted to fill it with blood. 
 
Rothko killed himself very early in the morning of February 25th 1970, cutting 
clean across the arteries just below the crook of his elbow.  His friends found him face up 
in a pool of blood. 
 
A dionysian longing for life midst death?   
 
I would like to say to those who think of my pictures as serene, whether on 
friendship or mere observation, that I have imprisoned the most utter violence in 
every inch of their surface. (Rothko as cited in Breslin, 1993, p. 355) 
 
I wonder if this violence is the violence of Dionysus’ dismemberment.  I wonder 
if in his suicide Rothko literalised and physicalised a symbolic process, a ritual.  I wonder 
if instinctively and unconsciously he felt that through the blood, the stew of wine, life 
would be recreated. 
 
Jung believed that man expressed his most important and fundamental 
psychological conditions in ritual and that if appropriate rituals were not provided, 
persons spontaneously and unconsciously devised rituals... 
(Samuels, Shorter, & Plaut, 2000, p. 131) 
 
The first thing Noah does on arrival after the flood is to make and ingest wine… 
Noah, the first man to plant a vineyard, made wine from its grapes, grew drunk, 
and uncovered his secret parts…  (Graves & Patai, 1965,  p. 120) 
 

169
Noah and Dionysus are both related to wine. 
Deucalion’s son Hellen was the supposed ancestor of all Greeks, and ‘Deucalion’ 
means ‘new wine sailor’ (deuco-halieus); which makes a connexion with Noah, 
inventor of wine.  Hellen was brother to Ariadne of Crete, who married Dionysus 
the Wine-god.  Dionysus also voyaged in a new-moon boat full of animals, 
including a lion and a serpent.  Deucalion’s wife was Pyrrha whose name means 
‘bright red’, like wine.  (Graves & Patai, 1965, p. 118) 
 
Wine is integral to this arriving after the journey.  Wine is integral to the 
recreation of a new body from the dismembered bits.  A mystery.  The ‘secret parts’.  
 
 
Figure 114. Anna Hueneke.  Refugee. 2004. 
 
The diasporist lives with dismemberment.  Dismemberment of their cultural body.  
Dismemberment of their own narrative flow.  The diasporist lives with dismembered 
body bits and must learn how to reunite them anew, creatively and individually away 
from the regular patterns of the cultural body. 
 

170
Narrative of the Oppressed 
 
 
Figure 115. Anna Hueneke. Oppression. 2002.58 
 
What narrative appears before my eyes?  What do I imagine after reading the 
writing of Heinrich Heine, Etty Hillesum’s diaries, the writing of Primo Levi, the 
experience of Victor Frankl in the camps, the First Diasporist Manifesto of Kitaj and the 
evocative prose of Anne Michaels.  I imagine a narrative of the oppressed.   
 
This is the narrative of the client in psychotherapy.  The client is so often the 
member of the family pushed out, scapegoated, punished.  They work against this fate.  
As does the therapist.

Europeanist and classical scholar, Miriam Robbins Dexter’s presentation ‘Colchian Medea and her 
circumpontic sisters’. 
 

171
The narrative of the oppressed. 
 
The bloody corpse of a baby is brought to trap The Rabbi of Bacherach.   
 
Unable to speak, the Rabbi moved his lips without a sound.  At last he cried, “Do 
you not see the Angel of Death?  Down there, he hovers over Bacherach!  But we 
have escaped his sword.  Praised be the Lord!”  And in a voice still quivering with 
horror he told her that while he was cheerfully singing the Haggadah, and 
reclining in comfort, he chanced to glance under the table, and there at his feet he 
saw the bloody corpse of a little child.  “Then I knew,” the Rabbi continued, “that 
our two guests were not of the community of Israel, but of the assembly of the 
godless, who had plotted to place the corpse in our house by stealth in order to 
charge us with child-murder, and to stir up the people to plunder and to murder 
us.  I dared not betray that I had seen through that work of darkness; I would 
simply have hastened my own destruction.  Only by craft have I succeeded in 
saving both of us.  Praised be the Lord!” 
(Heine, 1948, p. 266) 
 
This is the tragedy of the oppressed.  They become an easy scapegoat, an easy 
vessel for projections.   
 
The psychotherapist sometimes must wear an 
ugly mask, appear to the client as the hated other.   
 
The psychotherapist knows the position of the 
scapegoat.  At once feeling the projected emotions of the 
client’s previous bad experiences as well as having to 
steel oneself to respond differently to the countertransference feelings.

Figure 117. Villa of Mysteries Detail. 
 
The Silenus there has above his head the ghostly mask of terror, which promises 
death and horror as a preliminary to transformation.   
(Fierz-David, 1957/1988, p. 86) 
 
Like the figures in the Villa of Mysteries scene, client and therapist stare into the 
horror.  Staring into the flask of wine to see the image of horror reflected there.  The 
wine.  The mask.  Dionysian horror. 
 
Victor Frankl with inspiring strength, was able from his position as prisoner in a 
concentration camp, to enter a therapeutic conversation with his Capo.   
 
Fortunately the Capo in my working party was obliged to me; he had taken a 
liking to me because I listened to his love stories and matrimonial troubles, which 
he poured out during the long marches to our work site.  I had made an 
impression on him with my diagnosis of his character and with my 
psychotherapeutic advice. (Frankl, 1946/1964, p. 24) 
 

173
The oppressed can see with different eyes.  Oppressed peoples see from within the 
trauma system.  The personal and cultural trauma system.  They see the psychic necessity 
of qualities like aggression and depression.  They have the capacity to think in two 
worlds.  They understand from within the depth of their inherited bodies the process of 
bringing that which is unseen into view.   
 
 
Whispers 
 
A dream whispers to me as I am writing.  It was a dream I had when I was 
seventeen.  I had left my home in Canberra and begun study in Melbourne to be an artist. 
 
I am in the desert at night.  Rolling sand dunes.  It is not Australia.  It is the 
Middle East.  There is music overhead.  I look up.  There are hundreds of 
coloured scarves in the sky.  Blowing in the wind.  A beautiful voice speaks 
through the coloured scarves.   
“There comes a time in your life when you must give yourself over.” 
 
In becoming an artist, a maker of images, I did give myself over to something 
beyond me.  An autonomous task, of bringing that which is unseen into view. 
 
 
The Autonomous Creative Complex 
 
How does an autonomous complex arise?...a hitherto unconscious portion of the 
psyche is thrown into activity, and gains ground by activating the adjacent areas 
of association.  The energy needed for this is naturally drawn from consciousness 
– unless the latter happens to identify with the complex...  (Jung, 1993, p. 79) 
 
The normal man can follow the general trend without injury to himself; but the 
man who takes to the back streets and alleys because he cannot endure the broad 

174
highway will be the first to discover the psychic elements that are waiting to play 
their part in the life of the collective.  Here the artist’s relative lack of adaptation 
turns out to his advantage; it enables him to follow his own yearnings far from the 
beaten path, and to discover what it is that would meet the unconscious needs of 
his age.  Thus, just as the one-sidedness of the individual’s conscious attitude is 
corrected by reactions from the unconscious, so art represents a process of self-
regulation in the life of nations and epochs.  (Jung, 1993, p. 83) 
 
Jung’s autonomous creative complex gives an idea, a structure to this experience 
of the diasporist artist.  It recognises the important role of the individual artist and their 
vision. 
 
In my early adult life the autonomous creative complex became the driver of my 
psyche.  I identified with this complex.  My own internal dynamics were led by its 
autonomous creative drive.  I began to structure my self and my work, as artist and 
director of my new School of Creativity around this principle. 
 
 
The School of Creativity 
 
This was my experiment.  A school of art led by the psychodynamic body.  A 
school of art through which the autonomous creative complex could be nurtured in a 
positive way. 
 
The aim is to develop creativity through visual art within a psychodynamic frame.  
(Hueneke, 2003) 
 

175
It was an idea which I could only embody when I was living within the 
autonomous creative complex59.  As I developed as a therapist I built a different internal 
structure.   
 
Dear Etty, 
I ended my School of Creativity last week.  A ten year project. I was trying to do 
something bold and courageous.  I was trying to make a cultural vessel for 
internal necessity.  I was trying to make a space, a place for art led by internal 
necessity, led by the autonomous creative complex.  So much work, so much bold 
enthusiasm...I worked for the half forgotten, half alive members of our society.  
All those on the edges: Schizophrenia, Brain Damage, Psychosis, Depression, 
Autism.  These are all names Etty, for those extreme states brought about by the 
war embedded in our collective psyche.  These are the people who live with 
dissociation, and so quite profoundly, they all embody the potential to also be 
fiercely creative.  I keep using this word ‘fierce’ Etty because my experience of 
the autonomous creative complex is that it is a…what is it?…part of its driving 
energy is aggression.  I think of aggression not as punching someone, although it 
could manifest as that, but as a force exploding out of silence and depression. 
(Hueneke, 2007) 
 
While many people referred to what I did as art therapy, I made a distinction.  I 
felt these images were both intra-psychic and cultural.  I was restoring image making to 
its original cultural necessity.  This is how I hope my images, and those of other well 
known artists, are seen in the context of this thesis.  Images of the psychodynamics of a 
personal and cultural mythos. 
 
 
 
                                                
59 I established the school in Canberra in 1997, and ran it for ten years, first from a studio at Australian 
National Capital Artists in Dickson and then from a studio at Gorman House Arts Centre, until 2007.

Aggression and Rage at God 
 
 
Figure 118. Anna Hueneke.  Tiger Monster. 2003 
 
In Euripides The Bacchae Dionysus was angry with the people of Thebes, for 
forgetting their instincts, for forgetting the body, for forgetting the embodied god.  They 
worshipped a disembodied mind, a repressive Pentheus. 
 
 
 
DIONYSUS 
 
Hear me all!  I speak to you now as Dionysus, 
 
a God revealed to mortal eyes. 
 
I came back to this land of my virgin birth, 
 
to suffer the indignities that only human folly can invent. 
 
I was mocked at, chained, thrown in prison.  Men like Pentheus 
 
who abuse their power in defiance of the Gods 
 
shall ever rediscover the inexorable terror of divine justice. 
 
(Euripides, 1982, p.82) 
 
Metallica is a rock band which formed in the 1980’s.  They formed around the 
musical expression of aggression and anger, and drew enormous crowds who shared in 

177
this collective experience.  In the film VIP Pass: Metallica – Some Kind of Monster60 we 
see the band twenty years later.  The two formative members of the band now have 
children and families to attend to.  Whereas twenty years ago they didn’t consider what 
the culture of drinking and drugs that came along with the music was doing to them.  
They are now.  The aggressive form has become destructive.  Now they are searching for 
a positive way to make their music.  They are searching for a positive form, a positive 
purpose to their angry aggressive music.  They employ a psychotherapist to sit with the 
band at all meetings, rehearsals and recordings.  It is fascinating to watch what happens 
when the psychotherapist engages with a cultural form in the making.   
 
That was my aim at the School of Creativity, to bring a psychodynamic approach 
to the cultural form of art making.  It was differently structured to therapy in that I could 
take on clients who needed to really explore issues around death and rage in an artistic 
form.  “You cannot kill the art materials”, I would say, “no matter how destructive you 
feel towards the art materials, no matter how aggressive, you will always make art.”  
There is a freedom in this, an autonomy. 
 
In this film we see a process unfolding over two years.  Metallica are trying to 
record a new album, but the relationships are very strained.  Their bass player has left 
under explosive circumstances.  The psychotherapist remains present throughout a 
profound process.  One band member leaves for a year to face his own alcoholism.  They 
grieve for their original bass player who died tragically early in the band’s career.  The 
lead singer and the drummer express their anger at one another.  This all happens while 
they struggle to write their new album.  They try and fire the psychotherapist, but then 
realise they still need him.  There is a strong transference and countertransference 
                                                
60“This documentary chronicles the heavy metal band Metallica over a two year period focusing on the time 
of the recording of their album ‘St Anger', their first studio album in over five years. After being together as 
a band for over 20 years, the relationships between band members have become extremely strained 
resulting in long-time bass player, Jason Newsted, leaving the band. At the suggestion of their 
management, the band engages a therapist/performance enhancement coach, Phil Towle, to try and help  
them overcome their personal and professional problems. Midway through filming, James Hetfield (singer 
and co-founder of Metallica) checks himself into rehab to try and overcome his alcohol addition. (From the 
US, in English)”  Retrieved February 2008 from http://www20.sbs.com.au/whatson/?date=2007-05-

relationship of the psychotherapist to the band.  He is the good father who they struggle 
with for independence.   
 
Finally they decide to hire a new bass player.  This is a crucial turning point.  
Hope.  After this long process things begin to fall into place with their music.  They go to 
play at a prison full of men whose aggressive energies led them to powerful destructive 
acts.  The lead singer speaks about music as a positive expression of anger.   
 
They put the new finished CD together.  They title it Saint Anger.  The drummer 
puts it succinctly: “Aggression and anger can be positive.”  
 
In my psychotherapeutic practice I am delighted when someone cocooned by 
narcissistic defences hits the enlivening power of their rage. 
 
The rage, emptiness, and despair that have been warded off by the grandiose self 
now start to be felt and mastered. 
This phase marks what some schools of thought would call the genuine 
analytic work.  Most prominent, especially at its onset, is intense rage in the 
transference...and if the confrontations and interpretations are being introduced 
gradually and empathically, the rage itself should support the individuation 
process...The rage, and often the envy, that have been attendant upon the denied 
yearnings, become gradually integrated as normal assertiveness and self-regard as 
a growing sense of separateness, a therapeutic collaboration, and a communicable 
and analyzable transference experience begin to develop.”

We work against the power of death. 
 
Freud...suggests that narcissism may be the most intimate and archaic expression 
of the death drive.  (Downing, 2000, p.71)

In the early 1930s, as Nazism was becoming more and more powerful, Freud saw 
a world more and more dominated by Death – and saw how our fear of Death 
leads to its gaining more and more power over us.  (Downing, 2000, p. 71)

And there she stepped on to the platform she herself had described only a 
fortnight before in her own unforgettable way.  Talking gaily, smiling, a kind 
word for everyone she met on the way, full of sparkling humour, perhaps just a 
touch of sadness, but every inch the Etty you all know so well.  ‘I have my 
diaries, my little Bible, my Russian grammar and Tolstoy with me and God 
knows what else.’  One of the camp leaders came to take his leave of her and told 
her that he had used every argument he knew to plead her case but in vain.  Etty 
thanked him very much.  I only wish I could describe for you exactly how it 
happened and with what grace she and her family left! 
 
So here I sit now, a little sad, certainly, but not sad for something that has 
been lost, since a friendship like ours is never lost, it is and it endures.

That is what I wrote down, too, on a slip of paper that I pushed into her hand at 
the last moment.  Then I lost sight of her for a bit and wandered around the 
platform.  Tried again to find someone who could still do something for her but in 
vain.  I saw Mother, Father H. and Mischa board Wagon No. 1.  Etty finished up 
in Wagon No. 12, having first stopped to look for a friend in Wagon No. 14 who 
was pulled out again at the last moment.  Then a shrill whistle and the 1000 
‘transport cases’ were moving out.  Another flourish from Mischa who waved 
through a crack in Wagon No. 1, a cheerful ‘bye’ from Etty in No. 12 and they 
were gone...

Rage against death.  Rage at God.  Rage brings 
aliveness.  Blood mixed with clay. 
 
In Atrahasis, Enuma elish, and other 
Akkadian texts, in order to create humans 
from clay a god has to be killed, ‘that the 
god’s blood be thoroughly mixed with the 
clay’.  (Burkert, 1999, p.100) 
 
Levi speaks in the voice of the Nazis: 
We were the diligent executors, and for 
our diligence we were praised and 
promoted.  The decisions were not ours, 
because the regime in which we grew up 
did not allow us autonomous decisions: 
others have decided for us, and it could only happen that way, because our ability 
to decide had been amputated.  So we are not responsible and cannot be punished.  
(Levi, 1986/1995, p. 16)

Levi himself retained his autonomy through fierce aggressive thinking.  No God 
to salve his wounds.  He killed the narcissistic God.  Blood mixed with clay.  He 
remained alert and alive.  
 
I must nevertheless admit that I experienced (and again only once) the temptation 
to yield, to seek refuge in prayer.  This happened in the October of 1944, in the 
one moment in which I lucidly perceived the imminence of death: when, naked 
and compressed among my naked companions with my personal index card in 
hand, I was waiting to file past the ‘commission’ that with one glance would 
decide whether I should immediately go into the gas chamber or was instead 
strong enough to go on working.  For one instant I felt the need for help and 
asylum; then, despite my anguish, equanimity prevailed: one does not change the 
rules of the game at the end of the match, nor when you are losing.  A prayer 
under these conditions would have been not only absurd (what rights could I 
claim? and from whom?) but blasphemous, obscene, laden with the greatest 
impiety of which a nonbeliever is capable.  I rejected the temptation: I know that 
otherwise were I to survive, I would have to be ashamed of it.  
(Levi, 1986/1995, p. xvi) 
 
I remember well the experience of the raging victim in my practice.  Levi’s rage is 
his survival, his aliveness.  
 
It is said in my family that when my great-grandfather was taken to the 
Nervenklinik after a nervous breakdown he was castrated.  His aggressive energies were 
cut off by the Hitlerian system, which in itself was aggression gone mad.  He arrived 
home to his family a severely depressed almost completely incapacitated man.  They had 
cut off his aggressive resource, his way out of depression. 
 
Sue Austin, an Australian Jungian Analyst has done powerful work understanding 
the aggressive underpinnings of work with eating disorders.  She understands the 
possibility that rage can be used to discover self.  Rage can enliven the psychodynamic 

182
body.  In eating disorders the body is caged in a kind of holocaust.  The rage is trapping 
and  starving the person.  No psychodynamic. 
 
 
Austin’s goal is to rediscover, with the client, how 
the rage or aggression can be turned around in an 
enlivening dynamic. 
 
Anorexia is a physically and psychologically 
violent illness, in which aggressive energies have 
become caught up in self-hating, and self- and 
other- punishing amalgams.  I argue that one of 
the important aspects of recovery is that these 
amalgams need to be dissolved to some extent, so 
that the aggressive energies caught up in them 
become available for forming other, more 
enlivening amalgams.  (Austin, 2005, p. 174) 
 
Dear Etty, 
I know this.  The alive heat of a client’s 
murderous rage.  Or my own.  The exhilarating 
danger, and the almost porous surface that lies 
between it and love. 
(Hueneke, 2007) 
 
The dove descending breaks the air 
With flame of incandescent terror 
Of which the tongues declare 
The one discharge from sin and error. 
The only hope, or else despair 
 
 
Lies in the choice of pyre or pyre –  
 
 
To be redeemed from fire by fire.

Who then devised the torment? Love. 
 
Love is the unfamiliar Name 
 
Behind the hands that wove 
 
The intolerable shirt of flame 
 
Which human power cannot remove. 
 
 
We only live, only suspire 
 
 
Consumed by either fire or fire.

Dionysian Body 
 
Different traumatic memory systems are likely to be organised about 
different feeling states.  These states might involve a mingling of emotions.  The 
central affect is anxiety.  Sometimes it is felt merely as a dull and pervasive 
tension, a feeling of unsafety and unease.  At an extreme, there is terror.  Shame is 
common and expressed as humiliation, or utter exposure.  Anger is often intense 
and felt not only towards the other but towards oneself, so that revengeful hate is 
linked to destructive and suicidal ideas. 
 
The patient may confess, with shame, that in the midst of these fantasies 
involving hateful and terrifying images, he or she might wish the raping, abusive, 
and destructive scenes to be acted out upon him/her.  At the same time the thought 
is utterly horrifying, repellent, and rejected.  Mixed up in all this are mutilated 
parts of bodies.  The traumatic system is embodied. 
(Meares, 2000, p. 81) 
 
 
 
Figure 122.  Anna Hueneke.  Anger is the only love.  2005. 

185
The journey expressed in the The Bacchae is a journey into the utterly horrifying 
parts of a traumatic system.  The self hatred, the murderous rage, the vile, forgotten, 
abused, isolated.  Dionysus seeks to revivify, re enliven those lost parts.  It is dangerous. 
 
This is the aliveness of therapy.  Dangerous aspects of experience become known 
on the way to integration. 
 
This to me is Dionysus’ message.  Gather the anger, the rage, the body bits.  
Gather them up.  Cook up the pieces.  Gather the whole body.

She was foaming at the mouth. 
 
Her eyes bulged, rolling wildly. 
 
There was no corner of her mind 
 
not possessed by Bacchus. 
 
She was insane, oblivious to her son! 
 
Seizing his left arm just above the wrist 
 
and pushing with her foot against his chest 
 
she wrenched his arm clean out of the shoulder. 
 
It was not her strength that did it

Pentheus wailing while there was still a gasp left in him,

One carried off an arm, 
 
another a foot with the boot still on it. 
 
They laid his ribs bare - clawed him clean. 
 
His blood still warm on their hands, 
 
they tossed the flesh of Pentheus back and forth 
 
like children playing games. 
 
Nothing is left of him.  His body 
 
lies scattered - some of it on the jagged rocks,  
 
some buried in the forest thickets -  
 
by no means easy to recover. 
 
Except for his poor head.  His mother has it,  
 
proudly in her grip.  She raises it high 
 
on her thyrsus point - that head 
 
she thinks is of some forest beast -  
 
and carries it through the glades of Cithaeron, 
 
leaving her sisters dancing with those raving women. 
 
She is on her way here, inside the city, 
 
exulting in her fearful and pathetic quarry. 
 
She cries out to Bacchus, calling him 
 
“fellow-hunter,” “my ally in the kill,” 
 
“the victor of our chase”!...”

Jungian Analyst, Giles Clark, makes a sharp formulation of the therapeutic 
journey through madness in his paper The Animating Body. 
 
The order of damaged developmental events in the psychotic transference 
seems to go something like this: 
1. Initially, as felt from the inside, we find that we are both in one shared 
active environment.  This means that we have created our shared natural psychic 
universe around us.  The fantasy is: ‘I love you absolutely and shall for ever 
because you love me absolutely and shall forever.  You are mine and we are 
therefore one.’ 
2. Then, disillusioning experience changes or develops the fantasy: ‘I 
simultaneously find that you are not one with me, but are separate, different; you 
have a separate body and a separate mind and live in a different world.  This is 
terrible and intolerable.  I hate and envy you your separateness.  I cannot have you 
because you do not love me absolutely and eternally.’ 
3. ‘Therefore I must force us into a shared unit environment.  I must force 
you to be one with me, and me to be one with you: force us into love.’ 
4. ‘Simultaneously, I hate and envy you so much that I must kill you.  So I 
shall wound you, hurt you, make you ill and sick unto death.’  Therefore this 
commonly sensed active universe or environment field which the analysand has 
created is now simultaneously: 
 
(a) a place full of inactive oceanic reverie and bliss; and 
 
(b) an active battlefield of bullet-like projections and psychic germ 
warfare.  So it is both good and bad, pleasure and pain, loving and hating, sex and 
sickness, a love and death struggle.  This mix-up is maddening.  It is an 
overwhelming state of disorder, chaos and psychosomatic infection. 
5. But first the analyst and thence the analysand discover a paradox: 
namely, that the apparently loving side, the blissful inactive oneness, is deathly, 
and on the other hand that the murderous hate, pain and sickness is actually 
energising, vitalising, animating. 

194
6. And even more paradoxically; this terrible animating body, which is so 
fierce, disharmonious, sickening and disassociated is in fact what brings life and 
unites us.  (Clark, 2001, pp. 121-122) 
 
This psychosomatic aliveness, this ‘animating body’, reminds me of Garcia Lorca’s 
duende. 
To help us seek the duende there is neither map nor discipline.  All one 
knows is that it burns the blood like powdered glass, that it exhausts, that it rejects 
all the sweet geometry one has learned, that it breaks with all styles... 
In idea, in sound, or in gesture, the duende likes a straight fight with the 
creator on the edge of the well.  While angel and muse are content with violin or 
measured rhythm, the duende wounds, and in the healing of this wound which 
never closes is the prodigious, the original in the work of man... 
(Lorca, 1959, pp. 129-136) 
 
The ‘animating body’, the duende, the Dionysian body.  López-Pedraza reflects: 
...the irrational Dionysian complexes, where the incredible and the 
rejected manifest themselves in a single body... 
We cannot conceive of Dionysus as belief.  He is living experience: 
emotions, feelings, complaints, cries of grief and bodily expressions: 
manifestations through which lives repressed by consensus and relegated to the 
social and geographical sidelines in their constant battle for survival made their 
attempts at self-expression.  I speak of those defeated by history, as was the case 
with Garcia Lorca’s Duende which lives on in Andalusia, a region steeped in its 
Roman, Jewish, Moorish and Gypsy complexes. 
...the clinic for the mentally ill, the psychotherapist’s consulting room and 
the study of psychosomatic processes may well be understood as observations of 
the actual world which can, I feel, at times grant us a vision of the irrational as it 
emerges, leaping over the barriers of repression and trying desperately to come 
alive. 
(López-Pedraza, 1990, pp. 57-59) 

195
Aggression, madness, mixed up relations, violence, envy, longing, grief, 
depression, rage; these are all psychosomatic states that belong to my history, my body, 
my mythos as a therapist.  A mythos I am compelled to look at, internally live through, 
make images through, think through, in order to be with others in their mythos. 
Freud...understood that the entire narrative of a human life, the characters that we 
are and the dreams we enter, are structured by the selective logic of a profound 
mythos in the psyche.  (Hillman, 1995, p. 11) 
 
 
Destruction and Creation 
 
During reproduction, a union of female and male cells occurs.  The unity of each 
cell thus is destroyed and, from the product of this destruction, new life 
originates...The male component merges with the female component that becomes 
reorganized and assumes a new form mediated by the unfamiliar intruder.  An 
alteration comes over the whole organism; destruction and reconstruction...The 
joyful feeling of coming into being that is present within the reproductive drive is 
accompanied by a feeling of resistance, of anxiety or disgust.  This does not result 
from spatial proximity to the excreta or from the negativity of a renunciation of 
sexual activity; the feeling directly corresponds to the destructive component of 
the sexual instinct.  (Spielrein, 1994, pp. 156-157) 
 
The ascent to another way of being – the ascent of transformation – cannot occur 
without disintegration, without the process of breaking down; being pulverized 
physically, emotionally, spiritually.  If the container of self is not smashed, the 
vision cannot enter. (Metzger, 1999, p.75) 
 
This is not descending into chaos, although it feels chaotic when we are there.  It 
is entering into domains that cannot be understood in the ways we generally seek 
and convey understanding.  It is entering into worlds which operate by different 

196
laws.  Integrity is required, and so we must be reconstituted; this is the way of 
transformation. (Metzger, 1999, p. 78) 
 
The dismembered Jewish body.  Dionysus’ dismemberment in the Underworld.  
Repetitive generational dismemberment of the Jewish people’s culture.  Dionysus 
dismembered by the Titans.  Then reconstituted.  Divine.  In the wine.  Body bits are 
made whole. 
 
Jackson Pollock, that self-destructive alcoholic artist, a man who bravely plunged 
his wounded depths, painted body bits, body bits in motion.  He used a very viscous form 
of paint that could move.   He captured the movement.  The psychodynamic body. 
 
Pollock began drinking heavily at an early age, 15 years (McIntyre, 2002, p. 76).  
I wonder if Pollock, like Rothko, unconsciously longed for a Dionysian ritual of re-
memberment, hoping that through the wine, the alcohol, something disconnected could 
be reconstituted and made whole.  My sense is that his paintings achieve this; that in the 
viscousness of the paint, which is like blood or bodily fluids (or wine), and with the 
physicality of the throwing, is a ritual of re-memberment. 
 
Dionysus is torn to pieces then reconstituted in the blood, the wine. 
 
The body bits of Jackson Pollock are in the thrown paint.  There he finds rhythm.   
And in these fragmented body bits, in the rhythm, in terms of the body, is a narrative.   
 

197
 
Figure 128. Jackson Pollock.  Blue Poles: Number 11. 1952. 
 
Once rhythm or narrative is discovered there is the potential for a whole, a 
belonging, perspective.  Experience becomes part of a flow.  Narrative is a natural flow 
of images.  Images in flux, transformation.  Jackson Pollock’s thrown paint, his body bits, 
form rhythm and meaning in body’s terms.  Fragmentation is death.  Rhythm is life.  
 
The apparent contradiction in Pollock’s desire to create and simultaneously to 
destroy imagery may be consistent with Henderson’s belief that a psychic birth-
death-rebirth cycle was essential to the maintenance of Pollock’s sanity.62

Death and Rebirth 
 
…generation and fertility…are 
indissolubly bound up with death.  
Without death, there would be no 
procreation.  The inevitability of death is 
not a destiny decreed by some hostile 
power.  In birth itself, in the very act of 
procreation, death is at work….This then 
is the core of the myth of Persephone, to 
which the Eleusinian Mysteries attach.  
Man receives the fertility which is 
indispensable to him from the hand of 
death. (Otto, 1939/1978, pp. 20-21) 
 
It is from mortification, from the 
corpse, that the new and stable 
structure takes  
its beginning. (Burkett, 1999, p. 100) 
 
...neither men nor women can endure 
the darkening which precedes the 
transformation unless they are 
unswervingly mindful of the goal, 
that is, of rebirth.  (Fierz-David, 
1957/1988, p. 89) 
 
As Death becomes an ever more important theme, Freud comes to speak of Eros, 
the cosmic life principle, rather than of sexuality... 
He looks upon Eros and Death as two primal powers, as cosmological not 
just psychological energies, forces that are at work in us, through us, and in the

whole outer world.  He speaks of them as twin brothers, engaged in a dramatic 
struggle with one another and sometimes in so close an embrace that we cannot 
distinguish between them. (Downing, 2000, p. 70) 
 
On the walls of the shrine at Çatal Hüyük the many vultures depicting death are 
painted in red also symbolising life. 
The fact that the vultures were frequently painted in red rather than black could 
reinforce in symbolic terms the concept of rebirth. (Cameron, 1981, p. 29) 
For me, the movement from death to life is expressed in the birds.

The Individual Body 
 
The individual body emerges from these powerful autonomous drives.  An 
individual relationship to one’s body, and one’s cultural body.  Individuation. 
 
Erich Neumann writing during what must 
have been very dark circumstances in 1948 
says: 
The mortal peril which confronts 
modern man is that he may be 
collectivised by the pressure of 
mass events, become the plaything 
of the forces of the unconscious, 
and finally himself perish in the 
disintegration of his own 
consciousness.  The analytical 
psychology of Jung counters this 
peril by teaching the principle of growth towards wholeness through the process 
of individuation.  But this growth towards wholeness necessarily involves a 
creative relationship between the dark instinctual side of man’s nature and the 
light side represented by the conscious mind.  A new form of humanism is 
needed, in which man will learn to make friends with himself and to experience 
his own shadow side as an essential component of his creative vitality.  The 
shadow is not a transitional stage or “nothing but” the instinctual side considered 
simply as the soil in which the roots of life are bedded.  It is the paradoxical secret 
of transformation itself, since it is in fact in and through the shadow that the lead 
is transformed into gold.  It is only when man learns to experience himself as the 
creature of the creator who made light and darkness, good and evil, that he 
becomes aware of his own Self as a paradoxical totality in which the opposites are 
linked together as they are in the Godhead.  Only then – when the creative 
interrelationship of light and shadow is accepted and lived as the foundation of

this world – is life in this world truly possible for man; only then will the unity of 
creation and of human existence escape destruction by that disastrous rift which 
threatens the future of the human race.  (Neumann, 1948/1990, p. 146-147)

Teshuva – Return.  Return to the Ark 
 
There is a place in the myth that is not consumed by flood.  This is the ark.   
 
During the building of the ark in Wings from the Deep I added a Hebrew song to 
the soundtrack.  Both the singer who introduced me to it, and I, did not know the meaning 
of the words, only that it was in Hebrew and this in itself seemed important to me.  It was 
not until an Israeli woman in the audience in Bulgaria told me: Call us back and we’ll 
return. 
 
Teshuva. Return 
 
I find out much later that the principle of teshuva is integral to the flood story.  I 
discover it in a translation of the Torah for children, written in the style of the Ashkenazi 
Jews with some words retained in Hebrew 
(Noah Noach, God Hashem, return 
teshuva).  My Russian Jewish ancestors 
were Ashkenazi Jews. 
 
 
“Noach listened to Hashem and 
began to build the ark. 
 
“Why are you building an ark?” 
everyone asked. 
“In another 120 years, Hashem is 
going to bring a great flood to the 
world.  He is very angry about all 
the sinning.  When the flood 
comes, I will go into the ark and be 
saved.  You can also be saved, if 
you do teshuvah and stop sinning.” 
(Heller, 2003, p. 17)

204
Return to the ark.  One’s own ark.  One’s own right path.  I see this story not in 
the classical Ashkenazi orthodox terms, but in terms of psychodynamic psychology.  That 
is that each place in the flood story is valid.  That the mapping of territories within the 
myth is not based on good or bad, but on different psychic states.  And that to be 
contained by one’s own purpose is to be with God.  It is a psychological interpretation of 
the flood myth.  A psychological interpretation of God. 
 
I escape the tragedy.  I escape the flood.  I get on the Ark.  I enter the 
psychotherapeutic vessel.  I begin to pray.  Therapy. 
 
therapeia (fem. n.) I. a waiting on, service: e.g., service done to the gods, divine 
worship… 
therapeuein (v.) I. to be an attendant, do service; do service to the gods...  
(Hofmann, 1950/1994) 
 
...the stem thera- is related to threskos and thranos.  Threskos means pious, 
devout, god-fearing, religious; other forms of the stem are threskeia (fem. n.), 
religious worship or usage (later, in New Test., religion per se); threskeuein (v.), 
to hold religious observances, observe religiously; be a devotee.   
(Stamatakos, 1994) 
 
On the Ark something occurs.  Transformation is possible. The ark is a 
boundaried space.  Within it a shift in consciousness occurs.  A shift to complexity.   
Language begins after the Ark arrives65.  Language is gestated on the Ark. 
 
It is no mistake that the Torah is placed inside the Ark in the Jewish synagogue.  
The Holy Ark, Aron Ha-Kodesh.  In the synagogue the Torah is held within the Ark 
(Bryan & Whitburn, 1985).  The Torah is the imprint of the thinking of the Jewish 
people.  
                                                
65 In Genesis the next big story/event after the ‘Flood’ is the ‘Tower of Babel’.  (Graves & Patai, 1965) 

205
It is significant that neither biblical nor mishnaic Hebrew possesses a term for 
either “religion” or “Judaism”…The traditional term for this concept, employed in 
the Bible and in the Talmud, is “Torah”.  Now this term...embraces the totality of 
Jewish beliefs and practices, ideals and ideas, in fact, all the products of the 
Jewish creative genius through the centuries. 
(Chomsky, 1982, pp. 8-9) 
 
The Ark, where the Torah is both created and held safe, is the place where 
complexity is possible.  In that safety, a relationship of trust can be made, with God.  
Sacred.

In the mythos of human experience the flooding of emotions is always a potential.  
Flooding is a traumatic state in which there is no hope.  The only hope is to get onto the 
ark.  Make a container.  Make a vessel.  This is the therapeutic frame.  This is the ark.   
 
 

206
The ark is made of wood, and as Athos says to Jakob: 
‘The great mystery of wood is not that it burns, but that it floats.’  
(Michaels, 1997, p. 28) 
The ark, a vessel, floating on the sea. 
 
The ark is made of twos.  Two by two.  Relationship.  Boundary.  In the midst of 
catastrophe.  Resonance.  Relatedness.  Complexity.  Thinking.  Conversation. 
 
 
No Sex on the Ark 
 
Noah had parted his sons from their wives, and forbidden them marital rites: 
while the world was being destroyed they must take no thought for its 
replenishment.  He laid the same prohibition upon all beasts, birds and creeping 
things. 
 
(Graves & Patai, 1965, p. 114) 
 
On the ark, as in therapy, the instincts are frustrated.  From this optimum 
frustration a new desire emerges.  A desire for culture.   
 
Adam Phillips, a post-Freudian, says about sublimation: 
Work had to be done on the forbidden desires – a work akin to alchemy – to make 
them culturally viable.  From a psychoanalytic point of view, sexual and 
aggressive desires inform all cultural production. 
(Phillips, 1998, p. 121) 
 
Isaac Bashevis Singer in The Death of Methuselah describes the significance of the flood:          
Whenever I begin to ponder modern man and his disappointment with his own 
culture, my mind leads me back to the history of creation as it is described by the 
divine genius who wrote the Book of Genesis.  The very creation of man became 
a disappointment to God.  He had to destroy his own masterpiece, which had 

207
become corrupted.  According to the Talmud and the Midrash, the corruption was 
all sexual.  Even the animals became sexually perverted at the time of the flood, 
and perhaps later in Sodom and Gomorrah. 
In my story “The Death of Methuselah,” I explore this theme.  
Methuselah, the man who lived longer than any other human being, was madly in 
love with a shedemon I call Naahma.  She and her lover Ashiel were directing a 
conference of perverts and sadists from all over the world.  Evil had become 
man’s greatest art, his main achievement.  However, there is a spark of hope, 
because Methuselah’s grandson Noah has undertaken the mission to save 
mankind from utter destruction, in his ark. 
(Bashevis Singer, 1990, pp. vii-viii) 
 
On the ark is the creation of separateness.  Noah’s son is called Shem, name.  To 
have a name is to create a separate identity.  Separateness means thought.  Individual 
thinking.  Not just unconscious body processes.  Thinking, culture and separateness are 
created on the ark.   
 
What has my body longed for while I have been researching this thesis?  To have 
a baby.  I frustrate my body’s desire.  I move to culture.  A cultural baby.  This is my 
thesis.  This is the therapeutic process.  We make new culture inside the vessel of 
psychotherapy.  The therapeutic ark is the vessel which produces a separate identity, 
language and culture. 
 
Shem, name.  A person, no longer lost in a collective experience of body.  
Separate.  This happens in therapy.  New relationships can be made, with the therapist, 
with the body, and with the cultural body.  The ark is a structure for the personal, for 
introversion, for the potential of the individual.  It creates a boundary, not between right 
and wrong, holiness and sin, but between the collective tragedy and the potential of the 
individual.  And it happens in conversation. 
 
 

208
The Conversation as Image 
 
Over the years of attention to this doctoral work, which included training as a 
psychotherapist, a series of images have grown from within me, depicting the therapeutic 
conversation.  The ark, the sea, and the two people slowly became one image as I myself 
internalised the process of psychotherapy.  The conversation.

Out of this conversation emerged the ‘third’.  
 
In this case, ‘myself’ is not equivalent to ‘I’ and ‘me’.  Rather, it is a third term.  
This third term is necessary to the whole argument of this book.  It emerges 
during development, is lost in trauma, and is recovered during successful 
treatment – the ‘analytic third’ of Thomas Ogden.  (Meares, 2000, p. 10)

The Conversation - Letters to Etty 
 
In becoming a psychotherapist I learnt the craft of the imagistic conversation68.  I 
applied this knowledge as a research mode through my Letters to Etty (Hueneke, 2007).   
 
…at times I think that I will be able to write one day, to describe things, but then I 
suddenly grow tired and say to myself, ‘Why all these words?’ I want every word 
I write to be born, truly born, none to be artificial, every one to be essential.  For 
otherwise there is no point to it at all...Every word born of an inner necessity – 
writing must never be anything else. (Hillesum, 1981/1983, pp. 100-101) 
 
As I read her diaries I wrote back to Etty.  I read the book slowly over many 
months.  I read and absorbed and responded.  I entered into conversation.  I allowed 
Etty’s psychic state to affect me.  I allowed her writing style to pattern my responses.  I 
allowed the atmosphere she was living in, that was conveyed through her writing, to 
affect me.  I became empathically attuned to Etty in an embodied way.  Not as therapist 
or client, but as fellow explorer in the darkness of the Shoah. 
 
I am not a survivor of the Holocaust in the sense that there are real survivors who 
experienced the concentration camps and their horrors directly.  Nor am I daughter to 
such survivors in a direct sense. 
 
‘The black mystery of what happened in Europe is to me indivisible from my own 
identity.  Precisely because I was not there.’   
(Steiner as cited in Pines, p. 211) 
 
I have found that I continually return to the particular time and place of Europe 
from the 1880s to the 1950s.  I keep circling around this time and place, wondering what  
                                                
68 The ‘Conversational Model’ of psychotherapy was established by the late Robert Hobson and Russell 
Meares in 1985.  It is the training model for the ANZAP Australia New Zealand Association of 
Psychotherapy, Graduate Diploma in Adult Psychotherapy, which I completed in 2006. 

213
was happening in the soul of the larger community.  Like López-Pedraza in Reflections 
on the Duende (1990), he concentrates on the Spanish Civil War, drawing on a wide 
range of sources including the artists Francisco Goya, Pablo Picasso and Garcia Lorca, 
the ritual of the bullfight, the Duende, Dionysian rituals, the philosopher Ortega y Gasset 
and the Spanish language to illustrate the archetypal processes present in the Spanish 
psyche.  
This is how I feel and this is where my feeling takes me: to see the Spanish Civil 
War as a great mythological corrida. (López-Pedraza, 1990, p. 73) 
The Holocaust, the Shoah, is my ‘mythological corrida’.  The Holocaust, as image and 
reality belongs to my mythos. 
 
In my conversation with Etty I went through a kind of Holocaust of the 
imagination based on my childhood experiences.  My parents denial of my emotional 
body, and their lack of empathy was a result of the Holocaust, the real Holocaust, because 
the personal and cultural patterning of dissociation from pain was at its most powerful 
there.   
 
What I discovered with Etty was a way to re-pattern this dissociative habit 
through the written word.  With the structure of the therapeutic conversation as my tool I 
was able to re-connect with and express in words, traumatic psychological states.  I was 
re-connecting with my disavowed childhood, and my parents disavowed cultural trauma.   
 
I was writing through and into and in response to the image of the Holocaust.  The 
image of cultural emptiness.  The image of personal and collective emptiness.  Through 
Etty’s words and my own in response I was beginning to create my own language and 
thinking around trauma. 
 
Like Etty I followed my own inner necessity.  I followed my own emotional life 
and allowed that psychodynamic energy to structure the writing. 
 

214
The artist must...watch his own inner life and hearken to the demands of internal 
necessity...All means are sacred which are called for by internal necessity. 
(Kandinsky, 1964, p.53) 
 
Hilda Doolittle, an imagistic poet, comments on the process of writing about her 
experience of analysis with Freud: 
I do not want to become involved in the strictly historical sequence.  I wish to 
recall the impressions or rather I wish the impressions to recall me.  Let the 
impressions come in their own way, make their own sequence.   
 
(Doolittle, 1971, p.21) 
 
Etty too says this: 
I don’t know how to settle down to my writing.  Everything is still much too 
chaotic and I lack self-confidence, or perhaps the urgent need to speak out.  I am 
still waiting for things to come out and find a form of their own accord.  But first I 
myself must find the right pattern, my own pattern.  
(Hillesum, 1981/1983, p. 26) 
 
I filled six two-hundred-page notebooks from cover to cover.  I allowed the raw 
emotional flow going on inside me to find its own pattern.  By doing this I tried to remain 
connected to the integrity of my own inner structure.  My mythos.  I wrote till I found my 
voice.   
 
When I stopped writing to Etty I immediately began writing this thesis.  The 
writing voice was shaped by my written conversation with Etty.  And it developed in 
complexity as I progressed.  This complexity is what Meares describes as occurring in the 
therapeutic conversation. 
 
Levenson contrasts the kind of therapist’s remark which is a ‘transmission of 
information across interpersonal space’ with another form of communication 
which has more to do with ‘interpersonal resonance’.  ‘Out of resonance, a 

215
patterning emerges.  It is as though all the harmonic variations of the same 
melody light up’.  Put another way, resonance has the effect of triggering a 
previously linear system into one of complexity.  (Meares, 2000, p. 127) 
 
I identified with Etty, a young woman coming to terms with profound trauma.  I 
resonated with the patterning of Etty’s responses to the Holocaust and to the analytically 
oriented relationships she gathered around her.  Out of this resonance emerged 
complexity. 
 
I have not used the narrative of case histories in this thesis.   
...are our case histories not so much empirical demonstrations of the way the 
psyche works but empirical demonstrations of the way that poiesis works in 
organising our vision? 
...Case history...is merely a relic of the medical model, incidental to the concerns 
of the soul...we have to see the inner necessity of historical events... 
(Hillman, 1995, pp. 21-25) 
 
I have allowed my own inner narrative to structure the writing.  According to 
post-Jungian, James Hillman, this is what the founders of psychodynamic psychology 
also did. 
Jung’s...autobiography...came at the end of his twenty-volume cosmology and 
was not intended to belong to the evidence for his much earlier theories, although 
it subsequently turns out to have been the main empirical vessel of his entire 
work.  For Jung’s work, like Freud’s theory of dreams, repression, and the 
unconscious, results from one principal case history and is demonstrated by it, the 
author’s own.  (Hillman, 1995, pp. 32-33) 
 
The writing in this thesis is structured by the mythos of my own psyche. 
 
Freud’s one plot is named after a myth, Oedipus.  With this move, Freud too 
placed mind on a poetic basis.  He understood that the entire narrative of a human 

216
life, the characters that we are and the dreams we enter, are structured by the 
selective logic of a profound mythos in the psyche.  (Hillman, 1995, p. 11) 
 
Wings from the Deep was a mythos in images.  I discovered through this 
conversation with Etty that I could expand this mythos into words.  It was a shift in 
consciousness. 
 
 
The Cultural Shift from Image to Word 
 
Jungian Analysts, Anne Baring and Jules Cashford (1993) propose a shift in 
consciousness depicted in mythology as a shift from woman to man, Goddess to God.  I 
see it as a shift from image to word.  
 
I see the psyche as a narrative that includes both.  Two cultures.  Two forms of 
consciousness.  Image and word.  Both necessary. 
 
Freud suggests that it might be more appropriate to recognize that the animistic, 
subjective, mode of apprehending and organizing experience which brings 
together thought and feeling and works by way of symbols and association is the 
original mode of psychic functioning, the psyche’s primary process.  This more 
poetical, mythic, way of functioning is not a distortion of normal psychic process 
but rather the form of the psyche’s uninhibited activity; it represents the core of 
our being.  (Downing, 2000, pp. 62-63) 
 
People often say...that Dr Jung does not write very clearly, but he does that on 
purpose – he writes with a double attitude, giving full justice to the paradoxes of 
the unconscious... (Von Franz, 1980, p.156) 
 

217
This is the conversation on the ark, the ark of psychotherapy.  A paradoxical 
conversation, for as it floats upon the sea it looks into the past that was before the flood, 
at the same time as it recognises the brave future ahead.   
 
Duality is held on the ark.  In its constant movement, the movement of 
conversation, the two forms come together.  Past and present.  Image and word.  The two 
are one. 
 
Before the flood were primitive images.  Body images.  On the Ark the formation 
of language occurs.  Word images.  In psychotherapy, images lead to language, language 
of self. 
 
The ark holds the animals.  The primitive instincts.  The ark holds the humans.  
The ark holds all things.  Look to the ark.  This is the model for psychotherapy.  For a 
modern religious psychology.   
 
It does not have to be split as in Christianity and Orphism.  Light and dark. 
 
…whereas in Christianity the unfolding leads toward the light and the height of 
spirit, in our Orphic mystery cult it leads toward the Dionysian depth of the 
unconscious psyche… (Fierz-David, 1957/1988, p. 144) 
 
Noah and Dionysus are two figures from the same narrative.  The two figures are one.   
 
Through the vine, the wine, we remember our instincts.  Noah and Dionysus 
remind us not to forget.   
 
Through the sanctified wine of ritual we remember the blood of our instincts. 
 
Two figures, one form. 
 

218
Instinct, body and blood: wine and god. 
 
This thesis is an attempt to write in both languages.  Image and word.  Writing 
from the body.  Attempting to retain the connection to ancient imagistic mythological 
knowledge in the language written.  Mythos and Logos. 
 
My experience is that when a group or an individual has an awareness of all the 
physical states of the body - an awareness of the whole, a whole narrative - this leads to 
language.  When all the images of an archetypal drama or mythos are known, then logos, 
language, is born.  Language is a narrative.  Language is a mythos.  A mythos that is 
always cultural and collective as well as individual69. 
 
Language of self. 
Two of Jackson’s ideas are central to Damasio’s thesis. First, representations of 
all parts of the body are involved in the nervous activity which results in the 
experience of self.  Second, this experience depends on co-ordination of all parts 
of the brain...  (Meares, 2000, p. 48) 
 
 
Language 
 
Shem.  Name.  HaShem.  The Name.  The one and only name.  The name of God.  
Noah’s son is called Shem.   
 
What does the Jewish body do?  How does it speak?  My ancestors bodies speak 
through the chronicle of their lives.  Constant movement.  The Chameleon.  Changing 
identities.  Changing names. 
 
                                                
69 Mary Williams makes a compelling argument “that the personal and collective unconscious are 
indivisible” in her 1963 paper The Indivisibility of the Personal and Collective Unconscious. 

219
Dinora Pines says powerfully of second generation survivors of the Holocaust, 
and clients she has seen in psychoanalysis: 
…they knew, from their parents’ suffering, that the price we paid for a Jewish 
identity also comprises what we know and cannot bear, that we belong to a 
community with a long history of persecution and martyrdom.   
(Pines, 1993, p. 224) 
 
It is dangerous to have a Jewish identity.  I think constantly of my name.  I have a 
German name. I wonder about a Jewish name.  
 
In Egyptian mythology, to know a person’s name is to know their most powerful secret. 
 
“’Tell me your secret name, Father, and you shall live.’ 
“Then Re spoke: ‘I am abounding in names…I am Khepri at dawn, Re at 
noon, Atum in the evening.  These are my names.’ 
“’Yes,’ I said to him.  ‘These are your names.  But tell me your secret 
name, the one your mother and father hid inside you when you were born so no 
magician might have power over you.’ 
“Re was silent.  The hours passed.  At last, in the evening when the poison 
ran through him like fire and he could scarcely breathe, he whispered, ‘You shall 
have my name.  Come closer so it passes from my body to yours.’ 
“Then he closed his eyes.  There was darkness.  He went deeper and 
deeper into himself.  He took his name from his heart and placed it in my heart.  
‘One day,’ he said, ‘you will tell my name to your son, and my name will shine in 
his eyes.’” 
 
(Wolkstein, 1992, pp. 18-19) 
 
Arriving.  The son of Noah, Noach.  The son of a traveller.  The Name.  Shem.  
Separateness.  Self.  You cannot name what is not known.  Self becomes known in 
therapy.  Name.  This is a profound notion.  For when you have language you have the 
capacity to name many things.  Shem - Name begins language.  They stop travelling.  The 

220
journey is over.  They begin to cultivate the land.  They begin to cultivate language.  
What was gestated on the ark, can now be born. 
 
The language family which concerns us most at this time is that designated since 
1781 as Semitic.  The origin of this designation is the genealogical record of 
Genesis 10, 21-31, according to which the peoples employing these languages 
were descendants of Shem, son of Noah.  (Chomsky, 1982, p. 21) 
To reconstruct a ‘self’ after generations of trauma requires the rebuilding of 
language.  Language itself was destroyed by the Nazis. 
 
There were no ‘beautiful words’ in the Lagers.  ‘It is an obvious 
observation that where violence is inflicted on man, it is also inflicted on 
language,’ Levi writes in the fourth chapter, entitled ‘Communicating’.  Each 
Lager had its own peculiar jargon, a mixture of old Prussian terms and words 
newly invented by the SS.  This was not the German of Heine and Goethe – 
‘melodious, refined’ – but a sub-language, ‘a language apart’; it was Orts-und 
zeitgebunden, ‘tied to the place and time’.  (Bailey, 1988, p. xii) 
 
…Primo Levi considers the linguistic hell into which the Austrian philosopher 
Hans Mayer, who re-named himself Jean Améry, was plunged.  The barbaric 
jargon caused him spiritual anguish.  ‘He suffered from it because German was 
his language, because he was a philologist who loved his language: just as a 
sculptor would suffer at seeing one of his statues befouled or mutilated.’…che gli 
scorticava la bocca se cercava di parlarlo: ‘it scorched his mouth when he tried 
to speak it’. (Bailey, 1988, p. xii) 
 
I came to know the language of this thesis through rediscovering my own 
unknown cultural language.  Years ago, while working on the family stories for 
Artistories I had learnt German, Russian, and a small amount of Walpiri, an indigenous 
Australian language.  But the language of Judaism had eluded me. 
 

221
Athos didn’t want me to forget.  He made me review my Hebrew alphabet.  
He said the same thing every day:  “It is your future you are remembering.” 
(Michaels, 1997, p. 21) 
 
During the writing of this thesis, I made a beginning learning Hebrew.  I felt I was 
entering the cultural body.  Resonant words that corresponded to the images I had been 
painting for years.  Resonant emotive imagistic words.  And letters.   
 
The Hebrew alphabet felt like a long ago familiar form. 
 
 
Dear Etty, 
I am learning Hebrew.  I am fascinated.  We learn sounds, meanings, writing it 
down phonetically using the English alphabet.  Then we shift to the Hebrew 
alphabet.  Suddenly the thinking structures are different.  It is all visual.  The 
structure.  The consonants form the structure.  The vowels are not written down. 
 
The vowels are the hidden God. 
The vowels are the images, the inner flow. 
Sounds, structure, image. 
(Hueneke, 2007) 
 
In this vowel-less Hebraic structure there is space in the language for the body to 
walk into and enliven personally.  Just like the therapeutic hour.  That vessel remains.  
The therapist holds it open.  But it is the client who gives it body, who walks into it and 
enlivens it.   
 
Rothko’s paintings are to me visual images of the Hebrew script.  Spaces held 
open for the body to walk into.  Spiritual spaces70.   
                                                
70 The Rothko Chapel is used by many people of different spiritual disciplines as a space within which to 
gather and reflect.  (Barnes, 1989) 

222
I begin to read the story of Hebrew.  I am inspired by this story, of its survival 
over thousands of years, and its recent resurrection.  I feel identified with Hebrew itself.  
As if its story and its foundations in visual structures encodes something of my soul as 
Jew.   
Hebrew has been the sacred language of the Jewish people – the language of its 
religion, culture and civilization.  It has been, in sum, the language of Judaism and 
intimately identified with the national and religious experiences of the Jewish 
people throughout the generations.  The Jewish people can no more be dissociated 
from Hebrew than they can be dissociated from their own spiritual identity – 
Judaism.  (Chomsky, 1982, p. 3) 
 
Uncle Chatzkel, a Lithuanian Jew, who survived horror after horror, loss after 
loss, is devoted to language.  At the age of 91 his occupying passion is the writing of a 
dictionary in Lithuanian and Yiddish (Freedman, 1999).71 
 
I believe that it is in language where the Jewish soul resides.  Devotion to 
language.   
 
Dear Etty, 
Today, at the National Archives, I held my great-grandfathers’ original written 
words in my hand.  Their beautiful ink curves before my eyes.  
 
My own family’s word-less-ness emerges out of brutal oppression; the Kersh 
family from Poland and the Ukraine, and the Josephs from Latvia.  All using 
languages other than their own.  In a new place communication would be small, 
incremental.   
                                                
71 “Uncle Chatzkel portrays the patient triumph of one man's dignity and intellect over genocide, oppression 
and personal adversity. Chatzkel Lemchen has lived through the Russian Revolution, two world wars, a 
communist regime and survived the Holocaust which claimed the lives of his parents and children. He has 
seen it all, except for his Australian relatives. Australian filmmaker Rod Freedman travels to Lithuania to 
meet his great uncle Chatzkel for the first time. He documents this highly personal, intense 
and enlightening experience.”

Moving through the image-less, word-less death space of collective/cultural 
trauma.  Mourning, surviving, reviving – finding life again. 
(Hueneke, 2007) 
 
Languaging emptiness.  ‘Aliveness emerges out of deadness’.  And it happens at 
every level of consciousness. 
 
Hughlings Jackson’s hierarchical model of psychic function depends upon the 
notion of a reverberating system of representations, in which a representation is 
re-represented, after which the new representation is re-re-represented.  The 
highest level of these reverberations allows ‘self’ to emerge.  
(Meares, 2000, p. 55) 
 
The language of self is complex, it builds slowly over a long period of time. 
Body.  Image.  Word.  Self. 
 
In the creation of Wings from the Deep I began with images from the body.  Then 
we wrote from these images to word, then from word back to image.  A constant 
interplay between image and word.  This is psyche’s mode.  In this way the script 
remained in the imagistic voice, as does the basis of this thesis.  Psyche’s imagistic voice 
is a kind of poetry.  Poetry of the self. 
 
But poetry, the power of language to restore: this was what both Athos and Kostas 
were trying to teach me. (Michaels, 1997, p. 79) 
 
Poetry of the Psyche.  George Eliot said this about poetry: 
In Poetry – which has this superiority over all the other arts, that its medium, 
language, is the least imitative, & is in the most complex relation with what it 
expresses...  (Eliot as cited in Davis, 2006, p. 190) 
 

224
I was creating a new language of self in culture.  From body to image to word and 
back again.  Endlessly cyclical.  Endlessly re-referencing.  Growing in complexity.  
Growing a language of self.   
 
Ted Hughes says of his wife and fellow poet Sylvia Plath: 
Though I spent every day with her for six years, and was rarely separated from 
her for more than two or three hours at a time, I never saw her show her real self 
to anybody – except, perhaps, in the last three months of her life. 
Her real self had showed itself in her writing, just for a moment, three 
years earlier, and when I heard it – the self I had married, after all, and lived with 
and knew well – in that brief moment, three lines recited as she went out through 
a doorway, I knew that what I had always felt must happen had now begun to 
happen, that her real self, being the real poet, would now speak for itself, and 
would throw off all those lesser and artificial selves that had monopolized the 
words up to that point.  It was as if a dumb person suddenly spoke… 
…when a real self finds language, and manages to speak, it is surely a 
dazzling event. 
(Hughes as cited in Malcolm, 1994, pp. 3-4) 
 
I have included the fragments of my ancestors’ languages.  My journey has been a 
constant search through language.  To discover the sounds of my culture and the 
structures of knowledge held in language.  Ultimately though it is a search for the 
language of self. 
 
In my conversations with Etty I discovered a language, a structure, a patterning of 
thinking, of words and of images, with which to construct this thesis.  The research 
process had to include conversation.   
 
A babbling conversation.  An inner conversation. 
 

225
’Inner speech is not the interior aspect of external speech – it is a function of 
itself’.   
…We might suppose that this curious, non-linear form of language has the 
purpose of representing and so bringing into being, the sense of self… 
The...[language]...which concerns self, is non-linear and found, relatively pristine, 
in certain kinds of poetry...the sense of self is manifest in a language having 
something of the form of Vygotsky’s ‘inner speech’. 
 
(Meares, 2000, p. 25) 
 
The conversation with Etty was an inner conversation which developed into a 
personal language, a culture, a self.  Culture that was lost in the Holocaust.  Self that was 
lost in the Holocaust of my childhood.  Language of self nascent in the bones of my 
body.  Language reconstructed from ruins.   
 
These are the wings.  The worded wings.  Wings from the deep.   
 
For me Jewish culture, the Jewish imagination, Jewish language, has been integral 
to this reconstruction.  Language and its inherent images is so vital to this artform of the 
conversation. 
 
Every language, including English, has a stock of words which are charged with 
the emotional and intellectual experiences of the people employing it...The richer 
and the more intense the historical experiences of a people, the greater is the 
number of such words in its language and the more emotionally charged they are. 
(Chomsky, 1982, p. 6) 
 
This happens in therapy, as we learn our client’s language we learn which words 
are the more emotionally charged, which words represent major images in their 
emotional mythos.   
 

226
The most emotionally loaded image-word-idea in my inner structure, inner 
language, is wings from the deep.  This is the fundamental movement in my psyche, a 
movement I have faith in, a movement that allows me to enter the depths as an artist, 
analysand, therapist or writer knowing that I/we can and will rise up once again.  It is a 
fundamental belief.  A mythos.

227
The Torah as Cultural Imagination 
 
...it cannot be doubted that the Bible and the esteem with which it has been 
cherished throughout the centuries, counteracted and prevented fundamental 
changes in the structure of the language. (Chomsky, 1982, p. 31) 
 
The biblical phrases and expressions of thirty-five centuries ago pulsate with 
vitality and vigor almost on a par with the language spoken in Israel today. 
(Chomsky, 1982, p. 31) 
 
The Torah, the bible, is a flow of images.  It has provided me with a cultural body 
to engage with.  It has allowed me to think and imagine in an imagistic cultural form.  An 
ancient, and also modern form. 
 
For me, each moment I made a deeper relationship with my own psychodynamic 
body, its images and its words I also unconsciously and consciously deepened my 
relationship to the cultural imagination. 
 
Mother stays at the shul through the whole day… 
Mother is weeping quietly.  She can scarcely any longer see the little 
letters of her prayer book through her clouded spectacles.   
I stand at some distance and wait.  Mother catches her breath, raises her 
weeping face, and nods to me to tell me that she is feeling well, although she 
resumes her weeping at once.  I come closer to her.  I do not know what to do 
among all these weeping mothers.  I look down into the men’s section… 
Suddenly a humming and a clamor rise over the shul.  It becomes full of 
men.  There is a bustle, the air grows hot.  Men throng around the cantor.  The 
heavy curtain of the holy ark is drawn aside.  Now there is silence, the air has 
become motionless.  Only the rustle of prayer shawls can be heard.  The men 
hurry toward the holy ark.  The shining scrolls of the Torah, like princesses 
awakened from sleep, are carried out from the ark.  On their white and dark red 

228
velvet mantles great stars gleam – shields of David embroidered in silver and 
gold.  The handles are mounted with silver, encrusted with mother-of-pearl, and 
crowns and little bells hang from them.   
 
Light glows around the scrolls of the Torah.  All the men in the shul are 
drawn toward them.  The scrolls are surrounded, escorted.  The men crowd after 
the scrolls of the Torah, trying at least to catch a glimpse of them, send a kiss 
from a distance.  And they, the beautiful scrolls of the Torah, tower high above 
the heads of the worshipers, above all the out-stretched hands, and move slowly 
through the shul. 
I can hardly keep myself behind the handrail of the women’s section.  I 
should like so much to jump down, to fall straight into the embrace of the holy 
Torahs, or at least move closer to them, to their quivering light, at least touch 
them, kiss their bright glory.  But the scrolls are already being carried back, back 
to the holy ark.  From both sides of it the tall candles twinkle at them.  The velvet 
curtain is drawn, darkness comes to my eyes. 
As though to drown the sadness, the men begin at once to pray aloud. 
I remain standing at the window.  I am attracted by the men’s section, its 
clamorous air, filled with white talesim, like upraised wings surging through the 
shul, covering every dark spot… 
Grown-up men are crying like children.  I cannot stand it any longer.  I 
myself am crying more and more.  I recover only when I perceive at last a living 
weeping eye behind a crouching talis, when I hear trembling voices saying to one 
another: “Gut yom-tov!  Gut yom-tov!” 
I run home, for soon everyone will be back from shul, and I must set the 
table…In high spirits we fall upon the food.  Glasses of tea are poured and drunk. 
We have saved ourselves.  We are no longer hungry.  May God give his 
seal upon a good year for all of us.  So be it, amen! 
(Bella Chagall, 1946/1969, pp. 90-95) 
 

229
The Torah is brought out in the darkness of the fast.  The light.  The image.  The 
Word of the Torah, appearing in the darkest hour.  And then the feast.  Sweet.  Sweet. 
 
And on it goes.  Life is lived through the constant structure of ritual and festival.  
A mythos for the soul.  This is the mythos which structures life. 
 
The god is communicated through the language and narrative structure of the 
Torah.  The mythos of the Jews.  Through an immersion in mythos, in the imagistic flow 
of a narrative, one feels psychological space.  Through immersion in mythos, in 
embodied imaginings we come to logos, God.  It is through narrative that we come to 
know God.

A Mythos of Psychotherapy 
 
Mythos of the Body 
 
The image schema is a mental gestalt, developing out of bodily experience and 
forming the basis for abstract meanings.  Image schemas are the mental structures 
which underpin our experience of discernible order, both in the physical and in 
the world of imagination and metaphor.  (Knox, 2004, p. 9) 
 
Out of early bodily developmental experience a mythos is formed.  It occurs in 
images, many of them bodily sense impressions, and it gradually gathers to itself 
information to form a mythological structure innate to that individual.  Myths themselves 
are collective forms of humanity’s early developmental process.  For some time I had felt 
I had to make a choice as a therapist between a mythological or a developmental 
approach.  I now see the two as interlinked. 
 
The image schema would therefore seem to be a model that, for the first time, 
offers a developmentally sound description of the archetype-as-such and of the 
archetypal image.  The abstract pattern itself, the image schema, is never 
experienced directly, but acts as a foundation or ground plan that can be likened 
to the concept of the archetype-as-such.  This provides the invisible scaffolding 
for a whole range of metaphorical extensions that can be expressed in conscious 
imagery and language and that would therefore seem to correspond to the 
archetypal image.  These metaphorical elaborations are always based on the 
gestalt of the image schema from which they are derived.  (Knox, 2004, p. 9) 
 
If we consider these early image schemas to be archetypal then it follows 
analytical theory (Hillman, 1975) that a configuration, grouping or sequence of these 
images schemas forms a mythos.  Just as a myth contains a grouping or sequencing of 
archetypal images.  A grouping of a full sequence of image schemas would be the body.  
The body is a mythos. 

231
In our bodies are the ‘image schemas’ of our early bodily experiences: sexual 
intercourse, orgasm, conception, foetus in utero, breast feeding – attachment, baby biting 
the breast, excretion, defecation, menstruation and death. 
 
Body bits.  Pollock paints body bits.  I imagine it is a traumatic infant experience 
coming into a pattern.  Rothko paints space, the emptiness of the absence of mother. 
Soutine paints the bloody visceral dead-alive carcass-birth; his own experience of the 
struggle to be alive72. 
 
 
Figure 144. Chaim Soutine. Carcass of Beef. 1925. 
                                                
72 This is my interpretation in response to his painting Carcass of Beef (Figure 144) and to various written 
pieces about Soutine and his life (Güse, 1982) particularly one by Madeleine Castaing where she describes 
how often he destroyed his own creations.  “Often the session ended with the canvas being destroyed, an 
ominous sound, and he was left weak, exhausted, ill.  Other times he would call for us, pleased, but still full 
of doubt – this was the ritual of the first viewing.” (Güse, 1982, p.15)  

232
Lucian Freud, grandson of Sigmund, paints the ambivalent sexuality of the body73. 
 
 
Figure 145. Lucian Freud. After Cézanne. 1999-2000. 
 
There is a visceral quality to the picture.  The flesh is palpable, tangible, alive. 
(Kennedy, 2001, p. 7) 
 
Klein finds the mythos of early infant experience.   
...the language even of Kleinian psychoanalysis lends itself to talk of internal 
‘Gods’ and, in fact, the Kleinian approach is essentially a mythological 
                                                
73 “The play with perspective, whether the lines of floorboards, the undulating sheet or the damp line on the 
wall, the three wooden steps, the chest of drawers; each adds to the tension, the unresolved, tentative, 
questioning spirit which lies at the heart of Freud’s work.  His subject matter is interpersonal relationships.  
He delights in the capacity of a painting to say so much about the way human beings interact.”  (Kennedy, 
2001, p. 6) 

233
one...Klein stopped using the ‘scientific’ world view promulgated by Freud and 
simply started telling stories about the inner life of children.  While she worked 
backwards from behaviour, even adult behaviour, in pursuit of the story, her 
conclusion was that inner stories (myths, unconscious phantasies) are the 
dominant powers, or Gods, in personal development.  (Samuels, 1999, p. 262) 
 
And Donald Meltzer speaking out of his psychoanalytic background: 
Mrs Klein described, in effect, what you might call a theological model of the 
mind.  Every person has to have what you might describe as a ‘religion’ in which 
his internal objects perform the functions of Gods – but it is not a religion that 
derives its power because of belief in these Gods but because these Gods do in 
fact perform functions in the mind.  Therefore if you do not put your trust in them 
you are in trouble, and this trouble is the trouble of narcissism.   
(Meltzer, 1981, p. 179) 
 
The flood mythos comes from the image schemas of the body: rain, semen 
ejaculations, conception, the small foetus in the sea of the womb, the body as ark forming 
in this sea, the wings as the movement of the baby inside the uterus, birth as deliverance 
from the flood and arrival on dry land.  A new covenant can then be made with god, a 
new relationship with the mythos of the body. 
 
Freud viewed the body as the dwelling place of soul, he found that to speak of the 
soul, of its deepest longings and most profound terror, is to speak of the body, of 
sexuality and death.  And that to speak of the body as the soul knows it, is to 
speak metaphorically, imaginatively, mythically...  (Downing, 2000, p. 60) 
 
So finally I find the body has been there all along structuring the narrative, 
informing the process, guiding instincts until I could find words to speak its mind.  
 
I come to the point of finishing this thesis and finally realise what I have been 
staring at for these last ten years.  The heart of darkness.  The horror of the destructive, 

234
killing mother. Deep in the womb the sea is not calm but stormy.  The angry uterus.  
Gestation itself is a flood.  Birth a death.  Klein knew this horror, working from it to 
develop her own methodology for processing such tragedy.  Her own mythos.   
 
Jung, Freud, Hillman, López-Pedraza, Meares, Meltzer and countless others have 
also developed their own mythos.  As each of us have to in our own very individual 
ways.  Because to be a therapist is to speak the language of psychodynamic movement, a 
poetic language of imagery, a mythos.  This thesis is my mythos.  A mythos of 
psychotherapy.  Staring into the heart of darkness to find the pulsating blood that moves 
death into life. 
 
From this movement, this struggle, between death and life, arise images. 
I believe that phantasies operate from the outset, as do the instincts, and are the 
mental expression of the activity of both the life and death instincts.   
(Klein, 1975, p. 58) 
 
Like the flood the holocaust is a powerful collective cultural reality and image of 
the bad mother.  The flood and the holocaust are also equally images of the bad father, 
violent, humiliating, destructive.  The father whose rage destroys one’s world.  These 
destructive parenting systems, trauma systems, are sometimes passed on through many 
generations. 
 
This is the death we struggle with in the therapeutic relationship.  And in this 
alive struggle with death, we begin to make images.  We bring these destructive systems 
‘before the eyes’, and into ‘the stream of consciousness’  (Meares, 2000).  In this way the 
process is shifted from flooding to seeing.  The prisoner inside the trauma system is set 
free. 
...there was nothing but the wide earth and sky and the lark’s jubilation and the 
freedom of space.  I stopped, looked around, and up to the sky – and then I went 
down on my knees.  At that moment there was very little I knew of myself or of 
the world – I had but one sentence in mind – always the same: 

235
“I called to the Lord from my narrow prison and He answered me in the 
freedom of space.” 
How long I knelt there and repeated this sentence memory can no longer recall.  
But I knew that on that day, in that hour, my new life started.  Step for step I 
progressed, until I again became a human being.  (Frankl, 1946/1964, p. 90)

Wings from the Body 
 
The wings are there when the mystes witnessed a vision, an image.  The wings are 
there at Çatal Hüyük, in the winged vultures who can transform death (black) into life 
(red).  The wings are powerful on the dark angel of the Villa of Mysteries.  The wings of 
the bees emerge from the carcass of the bull in Crete (Baring & Cashford, 1993).  The 
wings, the birds, are on the ark and are the first to seek new life.  In every case, they 

236
occur at the moment when death turns to life.  A crucial turning point: ‘aliveness from 
deadness’.    
 
Physically it is the moment in the gestation of the baby when the mother feels the 
baby move for the first time, like the flutter of tiny wings. 
 
 
Figure 147. Anna Hueneke. Inside Red, Golden Wings. 2003. 
 
This red is not the angry red of destruction.  This is the other side of redness, life 
giving.  Inside are the golden wings of Eros. 
 
This image, Inside Red, Golden Wings is a religious image.   Crafted in the 
medium of the gold leaf panel, it is an image from the body, from an ancient mythos, in a 
religious form. 
  
 
 

237
The Religious Image 
 
Religious feelings.  Religious vocabulary.  Flow of Images.  I see in religion, in 
the Jewish religious practice, a constant flow of imagery.  
 
The religious image.   
Religion would not only give us primary images of soul-making but would open 
depth psychology’s eyes to the religious depth of its activities, to the realization 
that since its inception it has been actively practising religion.   
(Hillman, 1992, p.228) 
 
 
Figure 148. Marc Chagall. Tribe of Zebulun, The Jerusalem Windows. 1962. 
 
How is it that the air and earth of Vitebsk, my birthplace, and of thousands 
of years of exile, find themselves mingled in the air and earth of Jerusalem? 

238
How could I have thought that not only my hands with their colours would 
direct me in my work, but that the poor hands of my parents and of others and still 
others with their mute lips and their closed eyes, who gathered and whispered 
behind me would direct me as if they also wished to take part in my life? 
 
 
Figure 149. Marc Chagall. Tribe of Asher, The Jerusalem Windows. 1962. 
 
I feel, too, as though the tragic and heroic resistance movements, in the 
ghettos, and your war here in this country, are blended in my flowers and beasts 
and my fiery colours… 
I feel as if colours and lines flow like tears from my eyes, though I do not 
weep.  And do not think that I speak like this from weakness – on the contrary, as 
I advance in years the more certain I am of what I want, and the more certain I am 
of what I say. 

239
I know that the path of our life is eternal and short, and while still in my 
mother’s womb I learned to travel this path with love rather than with hate. 
These thoughts occurred to me many years ago, when I first stepped on 
biblical ground preparing to create etchings for the Bible.  And they emboldened 
me to bring my modest gift to the Jewish people – to that Jewish people which 
always dreamt of biblical love, of friendship and peace among all peoples; to that 
people which lived here, thousands of years ago, among the other Semitic 
peoples.  And this, which is today called “Religious Art” I created while bearing 
in mind the great and ancient creations of the surrounding Semitic peoples. 
My hope is that I hereby extend my hand to seekers of culture, to poets 
and to artists among the neighbouring peoples. 
I have concluded two years of labour, creating these twelve stained glass 
windows for this synagogue in Jerusalem.  My hope is that the synagogue will 
please you and that it will overflow with harmony even as I have prayed… 
 
(Chagall as cited in Werner, 1971, pp. 527-528) 
 
The religious imagination seems to associate itself with a very sensitive part of 
the psyche.  The place where self resides.  A place which in damaged persons is fiercely 
protected.  In the long process of therapy we sort through the wounds of childhood finally 
arriving at these intangible finer feelings.  Whatever they may be for each individual.  In 
my case it arrives with my engagement with Judaism.  My ancestors stories.  My new 
understanding of Judaism becomes part of an undiscovered vocabulary for self.   
 
Empathy is crucial to the therapeutic vocabulary.  Real embodied empathy, over 
the long term, leads to recreation of self.  And self is both intrapsychic and cultural.  The 
inner imagination is as important as the cultural imagination.  This is where our artists, 
religious thinkers, psychologists, psychotherapists and other creative thinkers dream us 
on.  Our collective inner world is as important finally as our personal inner world.  They 
are part of each other. 
 

240
And what is real for Jews is real for Jewish painters...To my mind, something 
instinct with one’s culture enters into one’s art.  (Kitaj, 1989, p. 43) 
 
Kitaj also says this in response to Martin Buber on the Holocaust: 
According to Martin Buber (1878-1965), the innermost meaning of that event was 
a message from God for a turning and a renewal.  I thought the message from God 
had not reached me yet but since my art has turned and renewed itself, maybe I 
got the message after all.  (Kitaj, 1989, p. 107) 
 
When he suffered a heart attack in 1989, Kitaj faced not only his own mortality, 
but the mortality of his culture.  In his ‘rebirth’ after ‘death’ was also a renewed 
relationship to his own culture and religion. 
 
 
Figure 150. R. B. Kitaj. The Wedding. 1989-93. 
 
 

241
The cultural body is enlivening.  The religious body.  The religious imagination. 
Jung, of course, began as all doctors did, on the basis also of his contact with 
Freud, with the idea of helping people to become more instinctive, in order that 
they might be healthy, but then he discovered that behind instinct was also 
religion, or that the latter was something instinctive and completely natural, for 
the natural man is the religious man. (Von Franz, 1980, p. 97) 
 
 
No Graven Image 
 
To interpret the second commandment ‘Thou shalt not make any graven images’ 
(Werner, 1971, p. 533) psychologically is to see it as a ruling which makes space for the 
individual imagination.  While Chagall's windows are exquisite representations of the 
cultural imagination it does not stop there.  What was happening in the inner worlds of 
those 176,000 people who went to see his windows in New York is what matters 
(Werner, 1971, p. 529).  What was enlivened in each individual?  This is what the second 
commandment is trying to teach us; to leave the potential open to the imagination of the 
individual. 
 
No Graven Image means, do not idolise the finished artwork.  Look to its process 
and its affect on the inner life of the individual and the cultural psyche.  No Graven 
image.  Don’t stop at one image.  Allow movement and flow.  
 
 
Dear Etty, 
I speak of the conversation as the artform of psychodynamic psychology.  
Because art is a sacred form.  To make an image as part of a ritual is a movement, 
a transformation.  That is art’s sacred role.  Perhaps I should have said that the 
conversation is the ritual of psychodynamic psychology.  And images are what 
flows through as psyche transforms.  Images spoken are transforming.  Images 
created in art are transforming.  The movement of psyche. 
(Hueneke, 2007) 

242
My performances are not finished artworks.  They represent the psychodynamic 
body in motion.  The images of a moving psyche.  After the performances I destroy the 
painting.  The painting belongs with the words, sounds and songs of the soundtrack.  It 
belongs in the context of the relationship between audience and painter.  An alive 
embodied relationship.  This brings the images into being, personally and culturally. 
 
Soul-making needs adequate ideational vessels, and it equally needs to let go of 
them.  In this sense all that is written in the foregoing pages is confessed to with 
passionate conviction, to be defended as articles of faith, and at the same time 
disavowed, broken, and left behind.  By holding to nothing, nothing holds back 
the movement of soul-making from it ongoing process...and when the last image 
vanishes, all icons gone, the soul begins again to populate the stilled realms with 
figures and fantasies born of the imaginative heart.  (Hillman, 1992, p. 229) 
 
James...stated that: ’Thoughts connected as we feel them to be connected 
are what we mean by personal selves’… 
’Thoughts’, in this statement, should be understood as a shorthand term, 
referring to the stream of consciousness, to that drift of images, memories, ideas, 
imaginings… 
Intermingled with, and at the bottom of the flow of inner life is the feeling 
of the body, which is with us all the time.  To much of this body feeling we pay 
no attention at all, though it fluctuates with the state of self... 
The Jamesian self is alive.  It involves change and chance, freedom and 
variety.  It is not static, not a thing, not a ‘structure’, to use common 
psychoanalytic parlance.  It is a process. (Meares, 2000, pp. 10-11) 
 
I have attempted in this thesis writing to present ideas, in the way they are 
presented in the therapeutic conversation.  I have tried to present the body feelings, 
imagery, cultural fragments in the way they are presented during conversation.  I have 
tried to constantly express the personal and cultural aspects of the imaged and thinking 
body.  The psychodynamic body in process.  The psychodynamic body in relationship. 

243
A Mythos of Psychotherapy 
 
This thesis rests on the work of those who speak with image and word, and 
includes: the ancient peoples who created the imagistic narrative represented at Çatal 
Hüyük, the writers of the Epic of Gilgamesh including The Story of the Flood, the writers 
of the Torah, and the artists of the visual narrative at the Villa of Mysteries.  It is 
supported by the work of psychodynamic psychologists who work with imagery and 
narrative including Freud, Jung, Klein, Kristeva, López-Pedraza, Hillman, Meltzer, Pines, 
Clark and Knox.  Also, Meares, who has developed the Conversational Model of 
psychotherapy, out of a subtle and sophisticated understanding of imagistic language.  
Like these psychologists the artists also trust the power of images, artists such as Munch, 
Kollwitz, Beckmann, Brancusi, Rothko, Pollock, Soutine, Lucian Freud, Lasansky, 
Chagall and Kitaj, as well as the unknown artists of the concentration camps.  Writers 
who have provided me with the depth of narrative structure as inspiration to this work are 
Richardson, T. S. Eliot, Bella Chagall and most particularly Michaels who in Fugitive 
Pieces wrote a moving narrative of the Holocaust and its generational ramifications in 
poetic prose.  Also Artaud whose passionate writing takes one to the core of the theatrical 
form.  Lastly has been those who write from direct experience of the Holocaust: Frankl, 
Levi and Hillesum who wrote through the daily images of her life during profound 
oppression of the tenaciously held inner space for God. 
 
This thesis is a mythos, a body of images in psychodynamic motion.  Mythos is a 
life lived.  The body lives and moves through images.  Mythos is the body of logos.   
God, logos, language, becomes known through the body.  A passionate and embodied 
engagement with innerness leads to intellectual reflection.  Implicit knowledge, known 
only in associative images and body feelings, gradually becomes explicit in language.   
 
As we know from our analytic work implicit knowledge may form the 
unconscious bedrock of our understanding, but we frequently also need to be able 
to give conscious expression to this knowledge in the form of language.  This 
requires a process Annette Karmiloff-Smith has identified as ‘representational re-

244
description’.  This process consists of a series of stages in which information is 
initially built up and stored implicitly and then re-encoded into ever more explicit 
format, eventually emerging as concepts which can be expressed in language 
(Karmiloff-Smith 1992)...Although she offers this primarily as a developmental 
model, she also suggests that it underpins the mastering of complex skills in adult 
life as well, which initially can only be learnt implicitly but can later be re-
encoded and described in language.  This is a fundamental feature of analytic 
work – so often we struggle for months or years with implicit awareness about a 
patient and then suddenly find the words to describe what we, and often the 
patient, already know.  An implicit narrative can gradually become explicit.  
(Knox, 2004, p. 10) 
 
In this way I have come to a mythos of psychotherapy.  I began this thesis with 
the creative illness of Jung and Freud.  I took their example seriously, this journey 
through darkness, as a way to becoming a psychodynamic psychotherapist.  Like Jung 
and Freud I have built a structure from within the depths of my own psyche.  I began with 
the body and built from there.  I began in the chthonic (Jaffé, 1990) darkness of the body 
and moved into image.  Primitive visceral images from the body.  Slowly I built visual 
structures from unconscious image schemas.  A mythos of images.  Wings from the Deep 
was a mythos of images that was then amplified by sound and text.  This mythos then 
became languaged.  First through my experience as a psychotherapist working with the 
conversation and then through my conversation with Etty and with Jewish experience, 
thinking and culture.   
 
In this way I took a journey to the depth of madness and death.  And therein found 
the mystery of life.  The mythos of the psychodynamic body.  Death to life. 
 
In the final scene of the frescos of the Villa of Mysteries: 
This concentration upon the essential is expressed in the tenth scene of our fresco 
series by the attentiveness with which the so-called Domina is turned toward the 
holy, mystery-filled sphere of the inner wall.  (Fierz-David, 1957/1988, p.143) 

245
 
The ‘mystery-filled’ ‘inner wall’ of this thesis is Wings from the Deep.  Through 
the performance I was able to enter into an embodied experience of Hillman’s ‘theatrical 
logic’, Artaud’s ‘language in space’, James’ ‘stream of consciousness’, and Meares’ 
‘aliveness from deadness’. Wings from the Deep is the implicit foundation for this mythos 
of psychotherapy.  A mythos made explicit through the poetic language of this thesis.   
 
The art of being an analyst requires us constantly to focus on the subjective, to 
fine-tune to the intuitive, poetic, symbolic narrative that emerges in an analytic 
session...It is an art which requires years of personal analysis, training and 
supervision to nurture the capacity to resonate with the multiple and sometimes 
contradictory threads of the patient’s narrative.  It also requires a deeply ingrained 
respect for the symbolic process.  (Knox, 2004, p.15) 
 
 
Dear Etty, 
I had a dream last night of an older woman, sweet natured, who had lived through 
the Holocaust.  Memories, images, sometimes flicker past in her mind.  She is in 
the country.  She is walking through a field of grassy tussocks into the bush.  She 
carries a black leather doctor’s case.  She has been travelling.  Now she stops and 
opens the case.  As if by magic, from out of this small suitcase she builds a house 
with one room.  It has whitewashed walls with no windows.  But one wall is open 
to the outside.  In the dream the room is filled with flowers.  They are overflowing 
out of the room through the one open side.  She picks up one flower.  It is 
separated from its stem, just the flower head, like a star, five white petals, with a 
rich layering of colours near the centre of each petal.  It is hard, as if it has been 
preserved. (Hueneke, 2007) 
 
The final image of this thesis was also the final image of my letters to Etty.  And 
it encodes my own mythos as a psychotherapist.  In the dream the land on which I build 
the room is not my own.  The flowers in the room are all in pots, not in the earth.  This is 
the tension the immigrant feels.  I carry my history, my memories, my professional and 
cultural knowledge, in a doctor’s case.  The dream doesn’t show it clearly, but inside that 

246
heavy case, carried for so long, is a living heart cut out of its body.  And where do I put 
this heart, not in the ground, no it’s not my land.  I put this ‘thinking heart’74 into the 
body, the psychodynamic body. 
 
                                                
74 “...I prayed, ‘Let me be the thinking heart of these barracks.’  And that is what I want to be again.  The 
thinking heart of a whole concentration camp.” (Hillesum, 1981/1983, p. 191).  My thesis is an attempt to 
be the thinking heart of the psychodynamic body.  The thinking heart of a mythos of psychotherapy.
