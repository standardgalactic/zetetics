I definitely don't want to do it, but I could be convinced. Just pick me if you are out of options, I can paint in any style or any subject matter and 
can probably do it cheaper than other artists.
 
However, it sounds overly bureaucratic and formal for my taste. I could also provide a bit of support to an artist who really wants to do it. I 
definitely work way too hard for too little money but at least I don't have to deal with all the drama. I might find it better to do some repairs to 
damaged or outdated murals.
