Ignorance Interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics
Peter Mittelstaedt
Let S be a proper quantum system with  Hilbert space HS that is prepared in a
 mixed state given by the self-adjoint operator WS = WS+ with tr{WS} = 1.
Here, we assume that WS is not a pure state, i.e. WS ̸= WS2.
Two kinds of mixed states can be distinguished by their preparation.
(a) A “mixture of states” [1], a “real mixture” [2], or a “Gemenge” [3] is an ensem-
ble S(pk, ϕk) of pure states ϕk with probabilities pk.
(b) System S is a subsystem of a compound system S∗= S + S′ with Hilbert space
H∗= HS ⊗HS′ that is prepared in a pure state ∗(S + S′).
In case (a) the mixed state WS = 
i pi P[ϕI] may be considered as a for-
mal description of the “Gemenge” S(pk, ϕk) in terms of Hilbert space quantum
mechanics. Hence, there are obviously no difﬁculties for interpreting the state
WS = 
i pi P[ϕi] as a description of a system S that is objectively in one of
the states ϕi, which is, however subjectively unknown to the observer who knows
only the probability pi. In this situation, we say that the state WS admits “ignorance
interpretation”.
In case (b) the mixed state of the subsystem S of S∗is given by the partial trace
WS = tr′ P[∗] where tr′ denotes the summation over the degrees of freedom of
S′. It is easy to demonstrate that WS = WS+ with tr {WS} = 1. However, nothing
is known about the decomposition of WS into weighted components correspond-
ing to pure states. If the spectrum of WS is not degenerate, then there is a uniquely
deﬁned spectral decomposition WS =  pi P [ψi] of WS into orthogonal, i.e. mu-
tually exclusive states ψi. The states ψi are eigenstates of the operator WS and the
coefﬁcients pi are the eigenvalues. Hence, for any i ∈N the eigenvalue equation
WS ψi = pi ψi holds. However, the decomposition of the state WS is by no means

unique since there are inﬁnitely many decompositions of WS into nonorthogonal
states ψi′. Hence, the operator WS would represent formally an inﬁnite number of
ensembles ( ensembles in quantum mechanics) (n) (WS) := (pi(n), ψi(n)).
This means that the state WS is not sufﬁcient to determine a particular mixture
(n)(WS) of states that is actually realized. Even if WS admits “ignorance inter-
pretation” and can be interpreted as the description of some Gemenge (WS), new
arguments must be added for a complete determination of the Gemenge (WS) in
question.

However, the main question is still open. Does a given mixed state admit at all
“ignorance interpretation”? In other words, is it allowed to assume that a system S
with the mixed state WS =  piP[ϕi] is actually in one of the pure states ϕi, which
is, however, unknown to the observer who knows only the probabilities pi. If this
interpretation of WS were correct, then the mixed state would express the observers
“ignorance” of the actual pure state but not the objective indeterminacy of this state.
It is one of the most fundamental results of quantum mechanics that a mixed state in
general does not admit “ignorance interpretation”. The reason for this result is that
the assumption of a objectively decided pure state leads in general to contradictions
with well established results in quantum mechanics. This can be shown in various
ways and on different levels of generality [4, 5]. See also States, pure and mixed,
and their representations.
