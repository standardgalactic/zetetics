OF NON-LINEAR SYSTEMS OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS,

1. The study of the solutions of the system 
(1.0) 
dxj~ = X~(xl ..... 
x n, t, ~) 
i = 
1, 2 .... 
n, 
dt 
where the X i are regular functions of e for small e is classical. More recently non- 
linear systems like (l.0) have been studied when one or more of the Xi has a pole at 
e --~ 0, or what is equivalent, where e or some power of e occurs as the coefficient of 
the left member of one or more of the equations (1.0), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In this case the 
system when e ~ 0 is of lower order than when e 4=- 0. In the studies [2, 4, 6] it is 
assumed that the system has a solution with a continuous derivative in case e ----- 0 
and conditions are given for this to be the case when e 4 0. 
In applied mathematics there are cases where the system has only discontinuous 
"solutions" when e ~ 0 and yet is known empirically that when e > 0 the system 
has a continuous solution which approaches the discontinuous one as e-~ 0. This 
fact has been exploited by the Russian school of non-linear mechanics. Here a rigorous 
treatment will be given for a case where the system has a discontinuous "solution" 
when e ~ 0. The main result has already been announced, without proof, [3]. Since 
[3] has appeared, a system with a discontinuous solution has been treated [5] by 
Tihonov. In Tihonov's treatment the "jump arcs" instead of being solutions of {2.2) 
must be straight lines. Also the existence of derivatives with respect to initial values 
is not considered. 
The specific system we shall consider here is

S-d~+g-~+h 
-~ O. 
Here fi, ~i, g and h are functions of xl, x~ ..... 
xn, u, t and e. They are continuous 
in e for small e ~ 0. It will be convenient to use a vector notation and to denote 
the vector with components x i by x, the vector with componentsfl by f, and ?~ by q~. 
Thus we can write (1.1) as 
dx 
du 
d2u 
du 
(1.2) 
dt = fdi +q~' 
~[;+g~[+h 
= 0 
where the first equation of (1.2) is a vector equation. The vector f isf(x, u, t, e) and 
similarly for the vector ~ and the scalars g and h. 
By the degenerate system we shall mean (1.2) with ~ ----- 0. We observe that 
the degenerate system is of lower order than (1.2). We shall write the degenerate 
system as 
dy 
dv 
dv 
(1.3) 
~ = 1~+~, 
gdi +h = 0 
where y is a vector with components Yl ..... 
Yn and v is a scalar. In (1.3)f is f(y, v, t, O) 
and similarly for ~, g and h. Let us now consider a solution of (1.3) as a curve in 
the n+ 2 dimensional space (y, v, t). We assume that such a solution starts at a point, 
A. We observe that when the solution reaches a point on the hypersurface g(y,v, t, O) 
0, a singular situation may prevail with regard to dv/dt. 
This situation can be seen clearly by taking a very simple special case. We take 
the van der Pol equation with a change of time scale which may be written as 
d2u 
du 
(1.4) 
~-:=+(u~-l)-:+u 
= o 
dt~ 
- 
- dt 
and we consider the related degenerate equation 
dv 
(1.5) 
(v~-l)hi+v= 0. 
The solution v(t) of (1.5) which at t = 0 satisfies v(0) > 1 is readily obtainable. 
However all we need observe is that since 
dV 
dt 
v is decreasing. Thus for v ~ 1 
V 2- 1 <0

and after a finite elapse of t we have for some t -- tl, v(t~) ~ 1. As t -~ t~--0,~ 
-~ --e~. 
That is for v ~ ld-0, dv/dt ~ 
--oo. Any attempt to continue the solution, as a 
continuous function of t, beyond t ---- tl, fails since for v ---- 1--0, dv/dt ~ 
d-oo. Thus 
the solution cannot pass continuously from above v ~ 1 to below v ~ 1. Moreover 
since v ~ 
I is obviously not a solution of (1.5) the solution cannot be continued as 
v ~ 1. We note that v ---- 1 here corresponds to g ~ 0 in (1.3). 
If we turn to (1.4) with s> 0 we see that the line u= 1 offers no special difficulty. 
Thus a solution u(t) of (1.4) obviously can be continued beyond a point where 
u = l-t-0. Let u = 1~-0 when t ~ tl--O and let us integrate (1.4) from tl--~ to 
t1~-5 where 6 > 0 is small. We find 
dU -] t1+6 
[ U 3 
~ ] tl~-(~ 
( 'tl~r 
du (tl +_ ~) 
Now let us proceed heuristically. If as s -+ 0 we assume 
dt 
approach finite 
limiting values and if we assume that lu[ remains uniformly bounded in the range 
(tl--8, tld-5) then we get 
]t~+~ 
0(~) 
Now letting 6 ~ 0 and recalling that u(tt--O)= 
1, we get 
89167 
= O. 
Solving this last equation we get either u(tl~-O) ~- 1 or u(tl~-O) = --2. The value 1 
we discard on the basis of our experience with (1.5) and we are led to investigate 
further the possibility u(tl ~- 0) = -- 2. Actually (1.4) can be investigated directly [ 1] 
and it is indeed found that as s ~ 0, solutions of (1.4) on reaching u = 1+0 tend 
to jump to u = --2. We shall not pursue this intuitive discussion further but rather 
proceed in w 2 to give a definition of a solution of (1.3) which may be discontinuous. 
The definition will be justified because we shall show that as ~ -~ 0 solutions of (1.2) 
tend to solutions, as we define them here, of (1.3). 
As was observed in [3] the system (1.2) includes as a special case the system 
dx

(1.6) 
d-[ = H(z, w, t, s) ,

where x and H are vectors and H and G are continuous in e for small ~ ~ 0. G and w 
are scalars. With e not appealing on the right this is the system treated by Tihonov 
[5]. In case the right members of (1.6) are not linear in w the system can be brought 
to the form (1.2) (withf ~ 0) simply by differentiating the last equation with respect 
to t. On the other hand if the right members of (1.6) are linear in w then, if we 
du 
introduce the variable u given by d~ = w, the system (1.6) assumes the form

2. We shall now give the definition of a solution of (1.3). We consider the solution 
as a curve, S0, in the n+2 dimensional space (y, v, t). At the point A let t -~ a and 
g > 0. For a ~ t < 31, let (y(t), v(t)) be a solution of (1.3) and let 
(2.0) 
g(y(t), v(t); t, O) > O, 
a ~ t < vl . 
As t -~ rl--0 let g -+ 0. The point (y(~--0), v(v~,0), v,) we denote by B 1. We shall 
denote v(v~--O) by v B and y(~l--0) by YB" ABI is an arc of So. We assume that.at B 1 
n ~g.

Here I ~ I B. The next arc of S O is B~C1 where B~C 1 is a curve y(v) in the hyperplane 
t : 
Vl which satisfies the vector equations 
(2.2) 
dy 
dv = f(y' v, v~, 0). 
(The system (2.2) is (1.3) with t held constant and with the last equation of (1.3) 
omitted). The solution of (2.2) starts at B~. We then consider (2.2) for increasing or 
decreasing v according as h at B is respectively negative or positive. We assume that 
the solution of (2.2) can be continued for increasing or decreasing v, depending as 
we have seen on the sign of h at B, until we reach the first value of v 4= v B for which 
v 
(2.3) 
I a(y(v), v, ~,, o) dv = o. 
vB 
This value of v we call v c and the point C 1 is given by (y(Vc), vc,, 31). At C 1 we assume 
(2.5) 
g(y(vc), we, ~,, o) = g~ > o. 
On the basis of remarks already made we have

(2.5) 
(vc--v~)hB < 0 
where h B = h(yB, VB, T1, 0). (The integral corresponding to (2.3) in the case of the 
van der Pol equation we considered above is simply 
i 
v ( v~--1) dv =. 0 
1 
and since h at B 1 (where v -~ ]) is positive we must take v decreasing. Thus we see 
~at 
here v c=- --2.) 
At C1 we return to the system (1.3) and consider the solution with initial values 
at C1 and with t increasing. We assume that this solution can be continued with g > 0 
until t ~ 32--0 where g ~+ 0. From this point which we denote by B 2 we assume we 
can proceed in the manner already indicated at B 1 with v increasing or decreasing 
depending on the sign of h at B2- Proceeding in this way the solution So is defined 
geometrically as AB1C1B2C~...BNC~A" where A' is an ordinary point (i. e. one 
where g > 0). We assume that (1.3) has a solution So as just defined for a g t _~ ft. 
We assume further that there exists an open set R in the n~-2 dimensional space 
(y, v, t) containing the curve S 0 such that f(y, v, t, e), % g and h and their first order 
partial derivatives with respect to Yi, v and t are uniformly continuous and bounded 
as functions of y, v, t and e when (y, v, t) is in R and ~ ~ 0 is small. We shall also 
assmne that ff and h have second order partial derivatives continuous in R and for 
small e although this assumption can be avoided. 
We see that S0 considered as a curve (but not as a function of t) is continuous 
but that at the points C1, C2, etc. it has a discontinuous tangent. We see further 
that So is the sum of two kinds of arcs, the arcs AB1, C1B2, C~B3, etc. which are 
solutions of (1.3) and might be called regular arcs, and the arcs B1CI, B2C2, etc. 
which are solutions of (2.2) lying in planes t --~ ~i and which might be called jump 
arcs since the arcs are traversed in a zero elapse of t. As a function of t the solution 
is discontinuous and jumps from Bj to Cj at t -- ~j, j = 1, 2 ..... 
N. 
The condition (2.1) can be weakened by allowing I to vanish On g = 0 but 
requiring that I be different from zero and of the same sign off g ---- 0 in the neigh- 
borhood of B. A somewhat simpler situation where there will be no jump at all arises 
when I changes sign in passing through g =- 0. These cases will not be pursued further. 
In what follows the norm of a vector is defined as Ix[ = X[xil. 
The basic results for (1.2) are given in the following theorems, 

76 
Norman Levinson. 
Theorem 1. Let the degenerate system (1.3) have a solution S o in the sense defined 
above, for ~ ~ t ~ ft. Let ~ > O. If ~, 01 and 62 are small enough there is a solution 
x(t), u(t) of (1.2) over (~, fl) for any set of initial values satisfying 
Ix(~)-y(~)]+[u(~)-v(~)J ~ 01 
du (~) 
dv(o,) < 02 
dt 
dt 
= ~" 
Moreover as ~, 01 and 02 tend to zero, the curve representing the solution x(t), u(t) in 
(x, u, t) tends to S o. In particular for any fixed (~ > 0 
(2.6) 
]x(t)--y(t)[-F[u(t)-:v(t)[ 
tends uniformly to zero over the intervals, ~ ~_ t ~_ Vl--(~, Vl-~5 ~ t ~_ T2--0,..., 
vN~-(~ ~ t ~ fl, as e, 0~ and (~2 -~ O. Also

~-- t ~_ ~--~ ..... 
d~u 
d~v 
~-0 
~ t ~ fl as e, 0~ and 0~ --> O. The same is true for dt ~- 
dt ~ 
Theorem 2. It is also the case that if S o is a solution of (1.3) for ~ ~ t ~ fl then 
corresponding to any set of initial values sufficiently near y(~), v(~) there is a solution of 
(1.3) which tends to S o as the initial values tend to those of S o. Moreover the convergence is 
uniform in t if the portions of S o between rj~O are omitted. 
Theorem 2 is in a sense Theorem 1 for the case e = ~-0. 
In what follows let us denote by ~a differentiation with respect to one of the 
n~-I initial coordinates (x(~), u(a)) or with respect to the corresponding initial 
coordinate of (y(~), v(~)). Then we have 
Theorem 3. Subject to the same hypothesis as Theorem 1 we have

~u(t)

and 
~--,o 
uniformly over the same sets of intervals as for (2.6) and (2.7) respectively as s, 6~ and

Theorem 4. The functions 3y(t) 
~v(t) 
and --~a are uniformly continuous with respect 
to changes in the initial values of y and v at a over the same set of intervals of t as in 
Theorem 2. 
Theorem 4 is in a sense Theorem 3 for the case e = -t-0. 
As an application of these theorems in case the right members do not contain t 
or in case they are periodic in t we have the fact that if the degenerate system (1.3) 
has a periodic solution and if the Jacobian associated with the determination of this 
solution by varying initial coordinates is different from zero, then it follows by 
Theorem 3 that (1.2) will also have a periodic solution. We shall show this in w 8. 
3. We shall require several lemmass The first is well known.

Norman Levinson. 
Before turning to the proof of Theorem 1 we make the following observation 
which is valid for Theorem 1, 2, 3 and 4. It suffices to take the case where there is 
only one jump arc on S o since by repeated use of the theorem for the case of one 
jump arc, the theorem for N jump arcs follows at once. Therefore we shall assume 
that S o is of the form AB~CiA'. Clearly there will be no confusion if we call So, ABCA'. 
The proof of Theorem 1 is divided into four parts. In the first part we proceed 
from A to a point short of B; the second part involves the immediate vicinity of B; 
the third part takes the arc BC with the two small portions at ends B and C omitted; 
the fourth part takes the rest of S o to A'. We shall use K throughout the paper to 
represent finite constants which depend on the bounds of [fl, IFI, Igl, Ihi and their 
first order partial derivatives in R or part of R for small e, on the distance from S o 
to the nearest point on the boundary of R, and on the length of So. In particular the 
constants K will remain finite as ~+~+52 -~ +0. Any deviation from this use of 
K will be noted. 
Proof of Theorem

Let the minimum of g(y(t), v(t), t, 0) over (~, V) be denoted by 2m unless this minimum

the mean value theorem,

Since f and ~ are uniformly continuous for small e there must be a continuous function 
~(e) such that ~(0) = 0 and such that 
If(y, v, t, e)--f(y, v, t, 0)[ ~ ~(e) 
with similar results for ~, g and h so long as (y, v, t) is in R.

We have f(x, u, t, ~) -~ f(y(t)+z, v(t)q-w, t, e) and similarly for ~, g, and h. If we now 
apply Lemma 2 to (3.10) and (3.11) and make use of (3.12) and (3.13) we see that 
if e, 6~, and ~ as defined in the statement of Theorem 1 are small enough, (x, u, t) 
is in R for a ~ t ~ 7, and indeed for a ~ t g ~, at least so long as g(x, u, t, e) ~ m,

From (3.14) and the continuity of g we see that we will indeed have g(x, u, t, e) ~ m 
if e, (~1 and ~2 are small enough. We see from (3.14) and (3.15) that for t < 31, Theo- 
rem 1 is established except for the difference of the second derivatives of u and v. 
This we shall show in Lemma 4. The discontinuity at 31 is precisely the point of 
interest here and we begin to handle it in w 4.

We shall denote the point (y(tl), v(t I), tl) by the letter Q. If we choose y so that tl < y < rl, 
and apply the results (3.14) and (3.15) we see that if e, 51 and 52 are small enough 
then for some t (which tends to t 1 as s, ~1, 52 -+ 0) we have u(t) -~ v 1. Let us denote 
this point by P. Then at P we have t = tp, x(tp) ~ Xp and u = u t, ----- u(te) = v I. 
Also as s, 6x, 53 -+ 0, P -~ Q. Clearly we can choose Q as near to B as we wish. 
We now change from t to v (and u) as the independent variable. Since when 
v = u the values of t for the points on S o and the solution of (1.2) are not in general 
equal we will reserve t for the system (1.2) and in this section designate the variable 
t for (1.3) by the letter s. We have then that (1.2) can be written as 
dx

dp 
(4.0) 
du = f +q~P' p = duu' s-d-UU = P2g+p~h 
where f =f(X, 
u, t, e), etc. while (1.3) becomes 
(4.1) 
ely 
ds 
dv = f q-cpq, q = -d-v' 
0 =- gq-qh . 
where f -~ f(y, v, s, 0), etc. Since u and v are the independent variables here we can 
with no confusion use them interchangeably. We consider (4.0) for u ~ v 1. The 
solution of (1.2) can now be regarded at least in certain range of u as a solution 
of (4.0). 
Suppose v2 > VB- Let us choose 
(4.2) 
K 1 > 2(Ifl~-IqIq-1 ) 
for all (x, u, t) in R. (Clearly K 1 is a K). Let R1 denote the region of (x, u, t) bounded 
by the planes u = vl, and u = v 2 and by 
IX--Xpl q-It-tel 
<= gl(v2--Vl). 
Clearly if v 1 and vz are chosen near enough to vB we have R 1 contained in R for small e. 
If we consider the change in g as we follow-a solution of (4.0) we have

We recall the definition of I in (2.1) and our assumption that I ~ 0. Since 
g(y(v), v, s(v), 0) > 0 for v< v B and zero at v = v B we see that dg/dv < O. This fact, 
the fact that I # 0 and the fact that dv/dt is large implies that I < 0. Let Ks be 
chosen so that in R and for small ~, IJ~l < Ks. If R1 is small enough, that is if v~ 
and v2 are near enough to vB, we certainly have J1 < 89 and h < 89 B for (x, u, t) 
in R1 and for small e. 
Let v 1 be near enough to v B so that 
I 
q(vl) = -g-Q < ----

This is possible since gQ -+ 0 as vl -+ v B. Let e, (~ and ~ be so small that P is near

Now let us suppose that for our solution of (4.0) there is a va, vl < va < v2 such 
that for vl ~= u < v a, p(u)< --2gp/h B but that for u ~-va we have either p---- 
--2gp/h B or (x, u, t) reaches the boundary of R~. We shall show that this is impossible. 
By integrating

from v~ to v 3 we see that p > 0 since if p = 0 the left side di,derges. 'For vz g u < va, 
since 0 < p < --2gp/h B, we can assume p < 1 since we can take Q and therefore P

Thus (x(u), t(u)) is in R 1 for v~ _< u _< va and therefore we must have p = --2gp/h B 
at u = v s. Since p < --2gp/h B < --I/4K~ for Vl < u < va, we have

Thus g is decreasing as u increases up to va. Since g is decreasing we have at va 
g+ph < gp@ lph B ~ gp--gp = 0 . 
Thus by (4.3), dp/du < 0 at v a. That is p is decreasing and therefore we cannot have 
p = --2gp/h B for the first time at va. 
We see then that our solution of (4.0) remains in R 1 and can be extended to 
u = v2 and that 0 < p < --2gp/h B for v 1 =~ u =~ v 2. We can take vl as close to v B 
as we wish. Thus Q can be as near B as we wish. By taking e, 51 and 5~ small enough 
we can bring P as close to Q, and therefore to B, as we wish. The nearer we take P 
to B the smaller is gp and therefore the smaller is p for v I ~ u ~ v 2. Since q = --g/h 
until g = 0 after which q is identically zero on So, until v = v C, we see that q for 
Vl ~ v ~ v 2 also gets smaller as we take v I nearer to v B. Since u and v are independent 
variables for the respective systems we can identify u with v. Thus we can write our 
differential equations as

where ~Ol =f(x, v, t, s)--f(x, v, t, O)+pq~(x, v, t, ~) and o~2 = qq~(y, v, s, 0). Using the 
facts just enumerated we have, for vl ~-- v _< v2 
[(Di]-71-[O)2] ~ K(gp@gQ@~f(~)) 
where ~(c) has the same properties as in w 3. Applying a standard theorem to (4.5) 
relating two approximate solutions of a system or else setting ~ ---- (x--y, t--s) and 
making use of Lemma 
1 we have 
[x(vl-- y(v)[ + lt(v)--s(v)] <= K[~p(e )-~-gp-]-gQ-~- IX(Vl)-y(vl)t + ]t(Vl)--8(Vl)l] 
for v 1 g v _~ v2. Since the right member can be made as small as we wish we have 
demonstrated Theorem 1 up to the intersection of the hyper-plane v ---- v2 with S 0. 
We observe that v 2 can be kept fixed in the latter part of our argument as e, 51, and 
52 ~ 0 while vl must approach v B. 
Proof of Theorem 
1, Part 3. Here we demonstrate Theorem 1 over the part 
of the jump arc BC beginning with v = v2 and ending short of the point C.

Since I < 0 and gp > 0 and is small, we see that (4.4) implies that the solution 
of (4.0) crosses the hypersurface g = 0 in exactly one point which is near B. Let us 
designate the point where the solution crosses g = 0 by the subscript 4. We have

In (4.6) g is g(x(u), u, t(u), s) and similarly for h. 
We have already s~en that p(u) < --2gp/h B for vl --~ v ~ v~. Thus given any 
8a > 0, by taking P near enough to B, we can make p(u) ~ 53, v 1 ~ u ~ v2. Given 
any 84 > 0 we can choose s, 51, and 82 small enough so that 
(4.7) 
[x(v~)--y(v2)[ + [t(v2)-- s(v~)] ~ 84.

that we can require 6 a and 64 to be as small as we wish" if we make e, 61, and 02 small

(4.1o) 
fg(x(v), v, t(v), ~)-g(y(,,), v, 8(v), 0)l < 6J(vc-v~+

We can also satisfy (4.10) for vl ~ v g v~ on the basis of Part 2 simply by taking 
e, 01, and 63 small enough. Turning to (4.6) we have

If we choose 6 a small enough so Ka6 a < 08 then certainly the last two inequalities 
used in (4.11) yield 
(4.12) 
p(u) < ~/6, 
up to the point where we first have either p(u) -~ 6a or u ~ vc--65. But if e is small 
enough so that E/66 < 6a we certainly cannot have p(u) ~ 6a in u 4 ~ u ~ vc--65. 
Thus (4.8) holds in this range and we have established Theorem 1 on So up to any 
point just short of C. 
Theorem

beyond. Given any 65 > 0 we saw that for v B ~_ v ~_ Vc--65 we have fx--y[~ft--~'ll~

As we have already seen from (4.3) p > 0 so long as p remains small. We shall show 
that p must exceed min [gc/(2K), 1] in the neighborhood of C where now K is the 
max of Ih] in R. 
Let us denote a value of v < v c by v 5 and a value v > v C by v s. We choose v s 
and v6 near vc. So long as p < I we can construct R2, much like R 1, so that if v 5 andv~ 
are chosen close enough together the solution of (4.0) can be coatinued up to v 6 and 
will lie in R 2 which in turn will lie in R. This is certainly the case then if p is small. 
We can also choose v~ and v G near enough to vr so that in R2, g > ~gc > 0.

Now let us assume that

for some u, v5 < u < v6. If ~7 is small enough this can be replaced by 
ph < -- ~gv 9 
Since gc > 0 we must have h =~ 0. If h > 0 we have p < 0 which is impossible9 If 
h < 0 and [h I < K we have p > gc/(2K). Thus if p < 1 we certainly have p > gv/(2K) 
for some u, v5 < u < vs. 
Since we can choose v 6 as close to C as we wish we see that indeed we can enclose 
C in a sphere in (x, u, t) with center at C and of radius arbitrarily small and that 
having chosen the sphere we can, by taking s, ~1, and ~2 small enough be sure that 
R 2 lies in the sphere and that the solution of (4.0) enters the sphere with p very small 
but at some point in the sphere p ~- min (gc/(2K), 1). Let us denote this point by D. 
At D we transform back to the original independent variables. To show that the 
solution (1.3) changes but little from vl to t D, irrespective of whether ~--t D is 
positive or negative we have only to note that tD--V 1 --> 0 as 8, (~1, (~2 --> 0. We 
can now apply Lemma 2 at D as we did at the point A and we get Theorem 1 for 
the range of t given by max (31, tO) --~ t --~ /~. 
The proof of Theorem 2 is very much simpler and shorter than that of Theorem 1. 
It is quite direct except near B where we must use an argument similar to that used 
in the case of Theorem 1, Part. 2. 
5. The proofs of Theorems 3 and 4 proceed along somewhat different lines. We 
shall first prove Theorem 4. We use the letter a to designate an initial value of x i 
du(~) which has no counterpart in the 
and Yl or of u and v. The initial value of ~- 
degenerate system we shall denote by b. We observe that at t ~ ~, ~yJ~a is zero

unless a is the intial value of Yi in which case Oyi/Oa ~ 1 at t ~ ~. Similarly with 
Ov/Oa. We have 0y 
0x and 0v 
0u 
0-a = 0--a 
0-a = 0--a at t -~ ~ since a represents the same initial 
coordinate in (y, v) as in (x, u). We always have ~a

and similarly for % g and h. The system (5.0) is linear in Oy/Oa and Ov/Oa and the 
coefficients are continuous for ~ < t < T1. The initial values are known and thus 
~y/Oa and Ov/~aare determined for ~ < t < vl. Moreover for cr ~< t _< ? < T~ the 
functions Oy/Oa and Ov/~a are uniformly continuous with respect to t and with 
respect to changes in the initial values of y and v at t = cr

v(s, a) = Vo, 
At v~-v 0<v B but with v0 near v B we change from t to v as the inde- 
pendent variable. We observe that v ~ v 0 determines a point on So near B. 
As before it is convenient to replace t by s and reserve t for the system (1.2). 
Let s at v~-v0 be so where clearly s 0<T 1. We denote Oy/~a and Ov/Oa at

The term d-t a-a = ~aa di- is replaced by use of -d-t- ~- ---" We have easily from (5.0) and 
g 
Lemma 1 that the terms ~yJ~a and ~v/~a are bounded over a ~-- t ~ ~, by a bound 
that depends only on K a'nd m. Thus so long as ]zl+lw I ~ 1 there is an E, a function 
of K and m, which becomes large when m gets small, such that 
(6.3)

J 
where ~(e, 61, 62) is a continuous function of E, 81, 62, and m which tends to zero 
when e, 6t and 62 -~ 0. A similar result holds for G which has terms like those of F 
d2v 
and the additional term S~ad- ~. It is here that we use the existence of the second 
order partial derivatives of g and h. We find that G satisfies an inequality of the 
dv 
same form as (6.3). From the last equation of (5.0)~ a ~/at t = a can be computed.

We have 
-- 0 at t = ~. Thus -- at t = a is bounde~t and therefore 64 is of the 
3a dt

form Ke. With this we see that (6.1) and (6.2) satisfy the hypothesis of Lemma 3 
where st = E~ and e2 = ES~. Using Lemma 3 we see that Theorem 3 is valid for 
~ t ~ I~ < ~t in so far as the derivatives with respect to a are concerned.

As regards the derivatives with respect to b we use (6.0) without (5.0). We set 
z ~- ~x/~b and w -~ ~u/~b and apply Lemma 3. Since at t ~ a, z = w ~- 0 we have

here that ~3 --= 0. Since b dt

We also have (5.3) for the degenerate system. The initial values at u -~ v = v o of 
~X(Vo)/~a and ~t(Vo)/~a may be found in the same way as ~y(Vo)/Oa and ~s(vo)/~a in 
(5.1) and (5.2). Here ~x(vo)/~a means ~X(Vo-f-O)/~a etc. From Part 1 we know that

Let v~--vl be small enough so that K(v~--vl)/# < e~ where s~ is a preassigned positive 
quantity. Taking v 1 and v 2 closer to v B affects the previous argument only in so 
far as it may be necessary to decrease s, 51 and 5~. Let max Iz(v)] ~- M, vl ~-- v ~ v3. 
(If M ~ 1 decrease v 3 so that we get M < 1). Then from 
(6.12) 
M ~= ss-t-s6-~-Ms6-)-Ks89 
or 
M(1--s6--Ke 89 ~ s.5+s6 . 
Thus 2(s~-e6) ~ M ~ Iz(v)l. (In particular then it is unecessary to decrease v3 to 
achieve M < 1). We see then that (6.11) becomes, for any preassigned s 7 > 0,

any point short of C. 
The case ~xl~b, ~tl~b and ~pl~b is handled with the usual modification. That 
is we now set z --~ \~-~, ~/and 
use the fact that at v 0 the values of ]z I and ~p/~b

We now turn to the proof Of Lemma 4. 
Proof of Lemma 
4. Actually the result of this lemma is a consequence of 
Part 1 of Theorem 3 which we have already proved. There we have shown that 
d 5u 
d ~v 
(6.]5) 
-~0, 
~-~-3 <_t_~, 
dt ~a 
dt 3a 
uniformly as e, 3~ and 3~ -> 0. By a well known artifice ~/~a can be changed to d/dt. 
Indeed replace t by a+~ in (1.2). Then we have 
dt

--d(~ ~- 1 , 
~ 
---- f(x, u, t, s)~+q; 
, 
(6.16) 
d2u 
du 
~j+g~+h 
= o. 
Here we have one more dependent variable than in (1.2) namely t. The independent 
variable a is assigned the intitial value a ~- 0. Clearly then t(0) --~ a and a is an a 
for (6.16). Also u = u(a+a, s, x(0), u(0), u'(0)) where x(0) etc. are the values of x 
~u 
du 
du 
etc. at a ~ 0. Clearly ~ 
da 
dt and similarly for v. Using Part 1 of Theorem 1 
for the system (6.16) we have then the proof of Lemma 4 as a consequence of (6.15). 
The proof of Lemma 4 for v1~-3 ~ t _~ fl follows in the same way once (6.15) 
is demonstrated over this range of t. 
7. Theorem

We take v 3 < vv and near v C and choose the point P4(x4, u4, Q) so that P4 is the 
first point where we have p = P4 = ~ and t4 > t3. P4 here is unrelated to the point 
Pa used in the proof of Theorem 1. Clearly from (4.12) of Theorem 1, Pa -> C as

as small as we wish. With (7.24), (7.26) and (7.10) we can proceed now as in Part I 
from t 5 to fl since in the range t c to t 5 or t 5 to te the change in the degenerate system 
is small because {Q--tc[ is small. 
The case where b is used instead of a proceeds with the usual modifications. 
This completes the proof of Theorem 3. 
8. Let us consider the case where the degenerate system has a solution, as 
defined in w 2, which is periodic of period T. Let t ~ ~ be a point where g ~ 0. 
Suppose in the first place we take the case where the functions f(x, u, t, ~), cp, g and h 
are periodic in t of period T. Let the initial values for (1.3) be yl(~) ..... y,(~), v(~). 
du(o,) 
Let us denote the initial values of xl(~),..., x~(~), u(~),--~-- by al,..., a~+l, b. 
Then for the system (1.2) to have a periodic solution for small s it suffices that, if 
fl ~ ~q-T, the determinant at t ~ fl, 
D(al,..., a~+l, b, s) = 
should be continuous as

and D should not vanish. 
This is a consequence of the fact that the existence of a periodic solution of (1.2) is 
equivalent to the existence of a solution (al ..... a,+l, b) of

as e, dl, and d~ -+ 0. This is the Jacobian associated with a periodic solution of (1.3) 
and if it is different from zero we see that (1.2) also has a unique nearby periodic 
solution for small e > 0. In particular if the periodic solution of (1.3) is stable in the 
sense that the associated characteristic roots are all less than one in magnitude then 
the determinant (8.0) does not vanish, 
In case the right members of (1.2) do not involve t the period T is no longer a 
constant for periodic solutions (if any) of the perturbed system. Making the usual 
modification for this situation the same result relating the existence of periodic 
solutions for (1.2) to (1.3) holds again. 
The ease where the last equation of (1.2) is a vector equation can be treated 
quite readily on the basis of results obtained here by making a change of coordinates. 
We shall return to this ease later.
