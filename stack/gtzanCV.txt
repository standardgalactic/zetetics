Research Themes and Contributions
My research is inherently interdisciplinary and has the common unifying thread of using state-of-the-art
signal processing, machine learning and visualization techniques to extract and analyze information from
audio signals with speciﬁc emphasis on music. By increasing the quantity and quality of what the computer
can “listen to” we can develop more effective tools for indexing and manipulating large audio collections
as well as improve musician-computer interactions.
Music Information Retrieval
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is a new emerging area of multimedia research dealing with the anal-
ysis and retrieval of music in digital form. It reﬂects the tremendous recent growth of music-related data
digitally available and the consequent need to search within it to retrieve music and musical information
efﬁciently and effectively. The majority of my research has focused on proposing and solving a variety of
MIR problems. I was fortunate to be one of the pioneers of this research area and my publications have
inspired a large volume of subsequent work and had signiﬁcant impact (h-index of 29 (24 since 2008)
based on Google Scholar, June 2013). MIR topics that I have worked on include: audio segmentation
[C79,C125,C127,C128], compressed domain audio feature extraction [C124], peer-to-peer networks for
content-based audio retrieval [J20,C105,C112], query-by-humming [J17,C21,C107] , similarity retrieval
[J22, C44,BC7,C123], singing voice and gender identiﬁcation [C91,C102], audio matching and align-
ment [C109], feature extraction [J9,J11,BC5,J23,C58,C73,C94,C116,C120,C123], polyphonic instrument
recognition [C74], instrument classiﬁcation [J7, C51], multi-tag annotation [C53, 33], rhythm analysis
[J18,C90,C115, C23], chord, key, and structure detection [C22, C25], music transcription and audio fac-
torization [C18] .
In my work on musical genre classiﬁcation [J9,J13,J24,C103,C104,C106,C108,C119,C128] I proposed a
combination of feature extractors based on the Short-Time Fourier Transform and Wavelet Analysis that

Tzanetakis, George Curriculum Vitae (updated July 2016)

can be used together with machine learning techniques to automatically detect the musical genre of a music
piece in audio format. The journal paper describing this work [J24] received the prestigious 2004 IEEE
Signal Processing Society Young Author Award and is highly cited (1600+ citations - Google Scholar
(accessed June 2013)). An important aspect of the work was the inclusion of features such as rhythm and
pitch information that apply speciﬁcally to musical signals in addition to more general audio features. The
dataset and obtained classiﬁcation results are frequently used as a benchmark for automatic musical genre
classiﬁcation.
Visualization and User Interfaces for Audio and Music
Another major research theme has been the design and development of several novel content and context
aware visualization tools and user interfaces for browsing and manipulating audio and music collections
[J19,C19, C55,C56,C59,C75,C77,C87,C94,C99,C110,C111,C113,C114,C117,C121,C122,C126]. The com-
bination of well designed user interfaces that leverage human capabilities together with automatic content-
based analysis can result in powerful semi-automatic tools. In addition I have worked on immersive audio
and visual displays [J25,J78,C88,C129]. My group has also explored the use of location in smartphone
music interfaces [C48].
Audio Processing Software
Marsyas is a framework for computer audition research that has been available as open source software
since 1999. The impact of Marsyas has been steadily increasing especially since 2007 when a more com-
prehensive website was launched and the core team increased to approximately 4-5 developers. Since
November 2007 when the new website was launched it has received 52483 visits (approximately 41.07
visits/day) from 136 countries (from Google Analytics, April 2011). The software framework has ap-
proximately 300-400 downloads per month since 2007 an increase from less than 50 downloads/month
in 2003. In the summer of 2009 Marysas was a ﬁnalist (top 10 of 730 nominations) project in the Open
Source Software for Academia community choice awards and received over 300 votes of support.
The software provides a variety of common building blocks for audio analysis as well as a development en-
vironment that facilitates experimentation and creation of real-time audio analysis systems [BC6,BC7,J26,
C54,C64,C65,C85,C93,C95]. Marsyas has been used for a variety of projects in academia and industry
several of which are described in http://marsyas.info/about/projects. Industrial applica-
tions include prototyping the patented audio ﬁngerprinting technology of Moodlogic Inc. which has been
used by more than 100,000 users to link mp3 audio ﬁles to a large database (1.5 million songs) of meta-
data and a gender identiﬁcation system for voice messages designed for Teligence Inc. that is processing
approximately 25,000 voice recordings per day.
Academic projects include emotion recognition in music (Greece, Canada), novel interfaces for brows-
ing music (Japan), a dancing music robot (Portugal), and a multi-model search engine for music in
YouTube videos (Singapore). A large number of publications have been written about Marsyas (6), using
Marsyas (31) and citing Marsyas (12). In addition the software has been the basis of several undergrad-
uate projects and 4 graduate theses. More details can be found at http://marsyas.info/about/
publications. Algorithms based on Marsyas are regularly submitted to the Music Information Re-
trieval Evaluation Exchange (http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/2009/index.php/Main_
Page) where they exhibit state-of-the-art performance while being orders of magnitude faster than other
submissions. Marsyas is cross-platform and compiles under Windows (Visual Studio, MinGW and Cyg-
win), MacOS X, Linux, Solaris and Irix. More information can be found at: http://marsyas.info.
Music performance analysis, music robotics, and computer-assisted musical instrument tutoring
Since my appointment at the University of Victoria me and my students have been working on developing

Tzanetakis, George Curriculum Vitae (updated July 2016)
4
techniques for acquiring and analyzing gestural information from music performances [C28, C42, C29,
C46,C69,C71,C84,C92,C96,C97, C99,C101]. Both sensors [C20, C21, C69] and audio analysis [C24],
C98,C100] as well as hybrid combinations [C28, J8] have been utilized. Audio recordings only capture
the end result of a music performance whereas we are interested in capturing and analyzing the process
musicians use to actually create the music on their instruments. We have also explored the use of robotic
devices that utilize the extracted information to “musically” participate in performance and improvisation
[C36, C68,C81,86]. Using automatic analysis tools it is also possible to assist students with feedback and
targeted exercises during musical instrument practice [C63,C70,C76].
Computational Auditory Scene Analysis
Auditory scene analysis refers to the process of identifying, characterizing and potentially separating the
individual sound sources in an environment. My group has proposed an approach to predominant melodic
source separation in polyphonic audio signals that provides good results while being orders of magnitude
more efﬁcient than other source separation algorithms [BC4,J14,C82]. It utilizes a sinusoidal represen-
tation front-end followed by a peak grouping stage that is applied across time and frequency. A peak
similarity metric incorporating frequency, amplitude and harmonic promimity is used in conjuction with
spectral clustering to form the groups [J14,C67]. In the context of this work we also have proposed a novel
harmonicity-based similarity between spectral peaks that can be used to efﬁciently enhance harmonic sig-
nals [C67]. The source separation systems has been used for different tasks including: mono-to-stereo
upmixing [J78], harmonization [C72], and polyphonic instrument recognition [C74]. We have also pro-
posed a method for the amplitude estimation of coincident partials [J12].
Computational Ethnomusicology
Most of existing work in Music Information Retrieval has concentrated on either western popular music
or classical music. Computational ethnomusicology [J16] can be deﬁned as the use of computatational
tools such as MIR algorithms and systems for the study of speciﬁc music cultures around the world. Our
work in this area is characterized by designing systems that are speciﬁc to a particular music culture
in consultation with experts such as ethnomusicologists. Examples of music cultures we have explored
include: North Indian Sitar performance [C76], Afro-Cuban percussion [C61,C62], and various types of
religious text recitation and chants [C35, C49,C10, C60, C66]. Our goal is to build content and context-
aware user interfaces and tools that can assist musicologists exploring speciﬁc music cultures. During the
design and development of these tools we closely collaborate with musicologists who provide feedback
and domain-speciﬁc knowledge.
Large-scale Bioacoustics
Bioacoustics is a cross-disciplinary science that investigates the sound production and reception in ani-
mals. My group has been active developing tools for analysis, retrieval and visualization of large archives
of animal sounds with speciﬁc emphasis on the vocalizations of Orcas. In collaboration with Orcalab, a
research station of northern Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, we are digitizing over 20000
hours of audio recordings from analog media to a digital database and developing semi-automatic and
automatic analysis tools for more effectively accessing these large amounts of data [C37, C38, C39, C15,
C45,C66,C80]. In the summer of 2009 in collaboration with the Neptune networked underwater observa-
tory we were awarded a CANARIE grant to extend this work to the acoustic data captured by the Neptune
instruments and with input from scientists develop tools for research in marine mammal communications.
Audio Fingerprinting and Cover Song Detection
Designed and developed content-based audio ﬁngerprinting technology for Moodlogic Inc [P7]. This
patented software was used by more than 100.000 users to link mpeg audio compressed ﬁles to a large

Tzanetakis, George Curriculum Vitae (updated July 2016)
5
database (1.5 million songs) of metadata that Moodlogic provides to its users. Some characteristics of
the ﬁngerprinting algorithm are: extraction (2 seconds), matching speed (200 milliseconds for 1.5 million
songs), size (300 bytes), accuracy (100% - 13500 queries of 1.5 million songs).
During a 6 month study leave, as a visiting scientist at Google Research, worked and made contributions
to a large scale cover song detection system that is applied to every video uploaded on YouTube (72 hours
of video uploaded every minute). The system helps song writers and music publishers, and YouTube to
increase their advertisement revenue. During the same period made fundamental contributions and is a
named inventor on 6 pending US patents related to audio ﬁngerprinting technology. This technology is
included in all Android Devices running the “Jelly Bean” version of the operating system starting in the
Fall of 2012 (33% of all Android Devices (June 2013)).
Other topics
In addition to these major themes, my group has also worked on: motion estimation [C130], voice trans-
formation [J15], assistive technologies [C59], teaching programming through audio manipulations [C89],
control of spatialized audio [C47], tangible interfaces for soniﬁcation [C50], adapting music to game play
[C52], swarm painting [C40,C41], teaching interfaces for computer vision [C34, and development of new
controllers for music expression [C57]. The control of physical modeling synthesis algorithms has also
been explored using hybrid acoustic instruments [C27] and machine learning [C43].
As a consultant for IVL Audio Inc, I was instrumental in the design of the three Morpheus guitar effects
pedals that perform real-time, low latency, polyphonic pitch shifting (http://morpheusefxsite.
abff.stackablehost.com/droptune.php#). These pedals have been endorsed by several well
known electric guitarists and the Morpheus Bomber pedal was selected by Craig Anderson (a well known
musical journalist) as the best new product of the NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants)
show when it was introduced in 2011.
