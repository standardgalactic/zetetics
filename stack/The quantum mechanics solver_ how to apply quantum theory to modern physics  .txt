Preface to the Second Edition
Quantum mechanics is an endless source of new questions and fascinating
observations. Examples can be found in fundamental physics and in applied
physics, in mathematical questions as well as in the currently popular debates
on the interpretation of quantum mechanics and its philosophical implications.
Teaching quantum mechanics relies mostly on theoretical courses, which
are illustrated by simple exercises often of a mathematical character. Reduc-
ing quantum physics to this type of problem is somewhat frustrating since
very few, if any, experimental quantities are available to compare the results
with. For a long time, however, from the 1950s to the 1970s, the only alterna-
tive to these basic exercises seemed to be restricted to questions originating
from atomic and nuclear physics, which were transformed into exactly soluble
problems and related to known higher transcendental functions.
In the past ten or twenty years, things have changed radically. The devel-
opment of high technologies is a good example. The one-dimensional square-
well potential used to be a rather academic exercise for beginners. The emer-
gence of quantum dots and quantum wells in semiconductor technologies has
changed things radically. Optronics and the associated developments in infra-
red semiconductor and laser technologies have considerably elevated the social
rank of the square-well model. As a consequence, more and more emphasis is
given to the physical aspects of the phenomena rather than to analytical or
computational considerations.
Many fundamental questions raised since the very beginnings of quantum
theory have received experimental answers in recent years. A good example
is the neutron interference experiments of the 1980s, which gave experimental
answers to 50 year old questions related to the measurability of the phase of
the wave function. Perhaps the most fundamental example is the experimen-
tal proof of the violation of Bell’s inequality, and the properties of entangled
states, which have been established in decisive experiments since the late
1970s. More recently, the experiments carried out to quantitatively verify de-
coherence eﬀects and “Schr¨odinger-cat” situations have raised considerable

Preface to the Second Edition
interest with respect to the foundations and the interpretation of quantum
mechanics.
This book consists of a series of problems concerning present-day experi-
mental or theoretical questions on quantum mechanics. All of these problems
are based on actual physical examples, even if sometimes the mathematical
structure of the models under consideration is simpliﬁed intentionally in order
to get hold of the physics more rapidly.
The problems have all been given to our students in the ´Ecole Polytech-
nique and in the ´Ecole Normale Sup´erieure in the past 15 years or so. A special
feature of the ´Ecole Polytechnique comes from a tradition which has been kept
for more than two centuries, and which explains why it is necessary to devise
original problems each year. The exams have a double purpose. On one hand,
they are a means to test the knowledge and ability of the students. On the
other hand, however, they are also taken into account as part of the entrance
examinations to public oﬃce jobs in engineering, administrative and military
careers. Therefore, the traditional character of stiﬀcompetitive examinations
and strict meritocracy forbids us to make use of problems which can be found
in the existing literature. We must therefore seek them among the forefront of
present research. This work, which we have done in collaboration with many
colleagues, turned out to be an amazing source of discussions between us. We
all actually learned very many things, by putting together our knowledge in
our respective ﬁelds of interest.
Compared to the ﬁrst version of this book, which was published by
Springer-Verlag in 2000, we have made several modiﬁcations. First of all,
we have included new themes, such as the progress in measuring neutrino
oscillations, quantum boxes, the quantum thermometer etc. Secondly, it has
appeared useful to include, at the beginning, a brief summary on the basics of
quantum mechanics and the formalism we use. Finally, we have grouped the
problems under three main themes. The ﬁrst (Part A) deals with Elementary
Particles, Nuclei and Atoms, the second (Part B) with Quantum Entangle-
ment and Measurement, and the third (Part C) with Complex Systems.
We are indebted to many colleagues who either gave us driving ideas, or
wrote ﬁrst drafts of some of the problems presented here. We want to pay a
tribute to the memory of Gilbert Grynberg, who wrote the ﬁrst versions of
“The hydrogen atom in crossed ﬁelds”, “Hidden variables and Bell’s inequal-
ities” and “Spectroscopic measurement on a neutron beam”. We are particu-
larly grateful to Fran¸cois Jacquet, Andr´e Roug´e and Jim Rich for illuminating
discussions on “Neutrino oscillations”. Finally we thank Philippe Grangier,
who actually conceived many problems among which the “Schr¨odinger’s cat”,
the “Ideal quantum measurement” and the “Quantum thermometer”, G´erald
Bastard for “Quantum boxes”, Jean-No¨el Chazalviel for “Hyperﬁne struc-
ture in electron spin resonance”, Thierry Jolicoeur for “Magnetic excitons”,
Bernard Equer for “Probing matter with positive muons”, Vincent Gillet for
“Energy loss of ions in matter”, and Yvan Castin, Jean-Michel Courty and Do-

Summary of Quantum Mechanics
In the following pages we remind the basic deﬁnitions, notations and results
of quantum mechanics.
1 Principles
Hilbert Space
The ﬁrst step in treating a quantum physical problem consists in identifying
the appropriate Hilbert space to describe the system. A Hilbert space is a
complex vector space, with a Hermitian scalar product. The vectors of the
space are called kets and are noted |ψ⟩. The scalar product of the ket |ψ1⟩
and the ket |ψ2⟩is noted ⟨ψ2|ψ1⟩. It is linear in |ψ1⟩and antilinear in |ψ2⟩
and one has:
⟨ψ1|ψ2⟩= (⟨ψ2|ψ1⟩)∗.
Deﬁnition of the State of a System; Pure Case
The state of a physical system is completely deﬁned at any time t by a vector
of the Hilbert space, normalized to 1, noted |ψ(t)⟩. Owing to the superposition
principle, if |ψ1⟩and |ψ2⟩are two possible states of a given physical system,
any linear combination
|ψ⟩∝c1|ψ1⟩+ c2|ψ2⟩,
where c1 and c2 are complex numbers, is a possible state of the system. These
coeﬃcients must be chosen such that ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1.

Summary of Quantum Mechanics
Measurement
To a given physical quantity A one associates a self-adjoint (or Hermitian)
operator ˆA acting in the Hilbert space. In a measurement of the quantity A,
the only possible results are the eigenvalues aα of ˆA.
Consider a system in a state |ψ⟩. The probability P(aα) to ﬁnd the result
aα in a measurement of A is
P(aα) =
 ˆPα|ψ⟩

2
,
where ˆPα is the projector on the eigensubspace Eα associated to the eigenvalue
aα.
After a measurement of ˆA which has given the result aα, the state of the
system is proportional to ˆPα|ψ⟩(wave packet projection or reduction).
A single measurement gives information on the state of the system after
the measurement has been performed. The information acquired on the state
before the measurement is very “poor”, i.e. if the measurement gave the result
aα, one can only infer that the state |ψ⟩was not in the subspace orthogonal
to Eα.
In order to acquire accurate information on the state before measurement,
one must use N independent systems, all of which are prepared in the same
state |ψ⟩(with N ≫1) . If we perform N1 measurements of ˆA1 (eigenval-
ues {a1,α}), N2 measurements of ˆA2 (eigenvalues {a2,α}), and so on (with
p
i=1 Ni = N), we can determine the probability distribution of the ai,α,
and therefore the ∥ˆPi,α|ψ⟩∥2. If the p operators ˆAi are well chosen, this
determines unambiguously the initial state |ψ⟩.
Evolution
When the system is not being measured, the evolution of its state vector is
given by the Schr¨odinger equation
i¯h d
dt|ψ⟩= ˆH(t) |ψ(t)⟩,
where the hermitian operator ˆH(t) is the Hamiltonian, or energy observable,
of the system at time t.
If we consider an isolated system, whose Hamiltonian is time-independent,
the energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian |φn⟩are the solution of the time
independent Schr¨odinger equation:
ˆH|φn⟩= En|φn⟩.
They form an orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space. This basis is particu-
larly useful. If we decompose the initial state |ψ(0)⟩on this basis, we can
immediately write its expression at any time as:

Complete Set of Commuting Observables (CSCO)
A set of operators { ˆA, ˆB, . . . , ˆX} is a CSCO if all of these operators commute
and if their common eigenbasis {|α, β, . . . , ξ⟩} is unique (up to a phase factor).
In that case, after the measurement of the physical quantities {A, B, . . . , X},
the state of the system is known unambiguously. If the measurements have
given the values α for A, β for B, . . . , ξ for ˆX, the state of the system is
|α, β, . . . , ξ⟩.
Entangled States
Consider a quantum system S formed by two subsystems S1 and S2. The
Hilbert space in which we describe S is the tensor product of the Hilbert
spaces E1 and E2 respectively associated with S1 and S2. If we note {|αm⟩} a
basis of S1 and {|βn⟩} a basis of S2, a possible basis of the global system is
{|αm⟩⊗|βn⟩}.
Any state vector of the global system can be written as:
|Ψ⟩=

m,n
Cm,n |αm⟩⊗|βn⟩.
If this vector can be written as |Ψ⟩= |α⟩⊗|β⟩, where |α⟩and |β⟩are vectors
of E1 and E2 respectively, one calls it a factorized state.
In general an arbitrary state |Ψ⟩is not factorized: there are quantum
correlations between the two subsystems, and |Ψ⟩is called an Entangled state.
Statistical Mixture and the Density Operator
If we have an incomplete information on the state of the system, for instance
because the measurements are incomplete, one does not know exactly its state
vector. The state can be described by a density operator ˆρ whose properties
are the following:
•
The density operator is hermitian and its trace is equal to 1.
•
All the eigenvalues Πn of the density operator are non-negative. The den-
sity operator can therefore be written as
ˆρ =

n
Πn |φn⟩⟨φn| ,

where the |φn⟩are the eigenstates of ˆρ and the Πn can be interpreted as a
probability distribution. In the case of a pure state, all eigenvalues vanish
except one which is equal to 1.

quantity A is given by

is given by
i¯h d
dt ˆρ(t) = [ ˆH(t) , ˆρ(t)] .
2 General Results
Uncertainty Relations
Consider 2N physical systems which are identical and independent, and are
all prepared in the same state |ψ⟩(we assume N ≫1). For N of them, we
measure a physical quantity A, and for the N others , we measure a physical
quantity B. The rms deviations ∆a and ∆b of the two series of measurements
satisfy the inequality
∆a ∆b ≥1

⟨ψ|[ ˆA, ˆB]|ψ⟩
 .
Ehrenfest Theorem
Consider a system which evolves under the action of a Hamiltonian ˆH(t), and
an observable ˆA(t). The expectation value of this observable evolves according
to the equation:
d
dt⟨a⟩= 1
i¯h⟨ψ|[ ˆA, ˆH]|ψ⟩+ ⟨ψ|∂ˆA
∂t |ψ⟩.
In particular, if ˆA is time-independent and if it commutes with ˆH, the expec-
tation value ⟨a⟩is a constant of the motion.
3 The Particular Case of a Point-Like Particle; Wave
Mechanics
The Wave Function
For a point-like particle for which we can neglect possible internal degrees of
freedom, the Hilbert space is the space of square integrable functions (written
in mathematics as L2(R3)).

3 The Particular Case of a Point-Like Particle; Wave Mechanics
5
The state vector |ψ⟩is represented by a wave function ψ(r). The quantity
|ψ(r)|2 is the probability density to ﬁnd the particle at point r in dimensional
space. Its Fourier transform ϕ(p):
ϕ(p) =
1
(2π¯h)3/2

e−ip·r/¯hψ(r) d3r
is the probability amplitude to ﬁnd that the particle has a momentum p.
Operators
Among the operators associated to usual physical quantities, one ﬁnds:
•
The position operator ˆr ≡(ˆx, ˆy, ˆz), which consists in multiplying the wave
function ψ(r) by r.
•
The momentum operator ˆp whose action on the wave function ψ(r) is the
operation −i¯h∇.
•
The Hamiltonian, or energy operator, for a particle placed in a potential
V (r):
ˆH = ˆp2
2M + V (ˆr)
→
ˆHψ(r) = −¯h2
2M ∇2ψ(r) + V (r)ψ(r) ,
where M is the mass of the particle.
Continuity of the Wave Function
If the potential V is continuous, the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian ψα(r)
are continuous and so are their derivatives. This remains true if V (r) is a step
function: ψ and ψ′ are continuous where V (r) has discontinuities.
In the case of inﬁnitely high potential steps, (for instance V (x) = +∞
for x < 0 and V (x) = 0 for x ≥0), ψ(x) is continuous and vanishes at the
discontinuity of V (ψ(0) = 0), while its ﬁrst derivative ψ′(x) is discontinuous.
In one dimension, it is interesting to consider potentials which are Dirac
distributions, V (x) = g δ(x). The wave function is continuous and the discon-
tinuity of its derivative is obtained by integrating the Schr¨odinger equation
around the center of the delta function [ψ′(0+) −ψ′(0−) = (2Mg/¯h2) ψ(0) in
our example].
Position-Momentum Uncertainty Relations
Using the above general result, one ﬁnds:
[ˆx, ˆpx] = i¯h
→
∆x ∆px ≥¯h/2 ,
and similar relations for the y and z components.

4 Angular Momentum and Spin
Angular Momentum Observable
An angular momentum observable ˆ
J is a set of three operators { ˆJx, ˆJy, ˆJz}
which satisfy the commutation relations
[ ˆJx, ˆJy] = i¯h ˆJz ,
[ ˆJy, ˆJz] = i¯h ˆJx ,
[ ˆJz, ˆJx] = i¯h ˆJy .
The orbital angular momentum with respect to the origin ˆL = ˆr × ˆp is an
angular momentum observable.
The observable ˆJ2 = ˆJ2
x + ˆJ2
y + ˆJ2
z commutes with all the components
ˆJi. One can therefore ﬁnd a common eigenbasis of ˆJ2 and one of the three
components ˆJi. Traditionally, one chooses i = z.
Eigenvalues of the Angular Momentum
The eigenvalues of ˆJ2 are of the form ¯h2j(j +1) with j integer or half integer.
In an eigensubspace of ˆJ2 corresponding to a given value of j, the eigenvalues
of ˆJz are of the form
¯hm ,
with m ∈{−j, −j + 1, . . . , j −1, j}
(2j + 1 values) .
The corresponding eigenstates are noted |α, j, m⟩, where α represents the other
quantum numbers which are necessary in order to deﬁne the states completely.
The states |α, j, m⟩are related to |α, j, m±1⟩by the operators ˆJ± = ˆJx ±i ˆJy:
ˆJ±|α, j, m⟩=

j(j + 1) −m(m ± 1) |α, j, m ± 1⟩.
Orbital Angular Momentum of a Particle
In the case of an orbital angular momentum, only integer values of j and m are
allowed. Traditionally, one notes j = ℓin this case. The common eigenstates
ψ(r) of ˆL2 and ˆLz can be written in spherical coordinates as R(r) Yℓ,m(θ, ϕ),
where the radial wave function R(r) is arbitrary and where the functions Yℓ,m
are the spherical harmonics, i.e. the harmonic functions on the sphere of radius
one. The ﬁrst are:
Y0,0(θ, ϕ) =

Spin
In addition to its angular momentum, a particle can have an intrinsic angular
momentum called its Spin. The spin, which is noted traditionally j = s, can
take half-integer as well as integer values.
The electron, the proton, the neutron are spin s = 1/2 particles, for which
the projection of the intrinsic angular momentum can take either of the two
values m¯h: m = ±1/2. In the basis |s = 1/2 , m = ±1/2⟩, the operators ˆSx,
ˆSy, ˆSz have the matrix representations:

Addition of Angular Momenta
Consider a system S made of two subsystems S1 and S2, of angular momenta
ˆJ1 and ˆJ2. The observable ˆ
J = ˆ
J1 + ˆ
J2 is an angular momentum observable.
In the subspace corresponding to given values j1 and j2 (of dimension (2j1 +
1) × (2j2 + 1)), the possible values for the quantum number j corresponding
to the total angular momentum of the system ˆ
J are:
j = |j1 −j2| , |j1 −j2| + 1 , · · · , j1 + j2 ,
with, for each value of j, the 2j + 1 values of m: m = −j, −j + 1, · · · , j.
For instance, adding two spins 1/2, one can obtain an angular momentum 0
(singlet state j = m = 0) and three states of angular momentum 1 (triplet
states j = 1, m = 0, ±1).
The relation between the factorized basis |j1, m1⟩⊗|j2, m2⟩and the to-
tal angular momentum basis |j1, j2 ; j, m⟩is given by the Clebsch-Gordan
coeﬃcients:
|j1, j2 ; j, m⟩=

Higher dimension harmonic oscillator problems are deduced directly from
these results.
The Coulomb Potential (bound states)
We consider the motion of an electron in the electrostatic ﬁeld of the proton.
We note µ the reduced mass (µ = memp/(me + mp) ≃me) and we set
e2 = q2/(4πϵ0). Since the Coulomb potential is rotation invariant, we can ﬁnd
a basis of states common to the Hamiltonian ˆH, to ˆL2 and to ˆLz. The bound
states are characterized by the 3 quantum numbers n, ℓ, m with:
ψn,ℓ,m(r) = Rn,ℓ(r) Yℓ,m(θ, ϕ) ,
where the Yℓ,m are the spherical harmonics. The energy levels are of the form
En = −EI
n2
with
EI = µe4
2¯h2 ≃13.6 eV .
The principal quantum number n is a positive integer and ℓcan take all integer
values from 0 to n −1. The total degeneracy (in m and ℓ) of a given energy
level is n2 (we do not take spin into account). The radial wave functions Rn,ℓ
are of the form:

Time-Independent Perturbations
We consider a time-independent Hamiltonian ˆH which can be written as ˆH =
ˆH0 + λ ˆH1. We suppose that the eigenstates of ˆH0 are known:
ˆH0|n, r⟩= En|n, r⟩,
r = 1, 2, . . . , pn
where pn is the degeneracy of En. We also suppose that the term λ ˆH1 is
suﬃciently small so that it only results in small perturbations of the spectrum
of ˆH0.
Non-degenerate Case. In this case, pn = 1 and the eigenvalue of ˆH which
coincides with En as λ →0 is given by:
˜En = En + λ ⟨n| ˆH1|n⟩+ λ2 
k̸=n
|⟨k| ˆH1|n⟩|2
En −Ek
+ O(λ3) .
The corresponding eigenstate is:
|ψn⟩= |n⟩+ λ

k̸=n
⟨k| ˆH1|n⟩
En −Ek
|k⟩+ O(λ2)
Degenerate Case. In order to obtain the eigenvalues of ˆH at ﬁrst order in
λ, and the corresponding eigenstates, one must diagonalize the restriction of
λ ˆH1 to the subspace of ˆH0 associated with the eigenvalue En, i.e. ﬁnd the pn
solutions of the “secular” equation:

⟨n, 1|λ ˆH1|n, 1⟩−∆E
. . .
⟨n, 1|λ ˆH1|n, pn⟩
...
⟨n, r|λ ˆH1|n, r⟩−∆E
...
⟨n, pn|λ ˆH1|n, 1⟩
. . .
⟨n, pn|λ ˆH1|n, pn⟩−∆E

= 0 .
The energies to ﬁrst order in λ are ˜En,r = En+∆Er, r = 1, . . . , pn. In general,
the perturbation is lifted (at least partially) by the perturbation.

Summary of Quantum Mechanics
Variational Method for the Ground State
Consider an arbitrary state |ψ⟩normalized to 1. The expectation value of the
energy in this state is greater than or equal to the ground state energy E0:
⟨ψ| ˆH|ψ⟩≥E0. In order to ﬁnd an upper bound to E0, one uses a set of trial
wave functions which depend on a set of parameters, and one looks for the
minimum of ⟨E⟩for these functions. This minimum always lies above E0.
7 Identical Particles
All particles in nature belong to one of the following classes:
•
Bosons, which have integer spin. The state vector of N identical bosons
is totally symmetric with respect to the exchange of any two of these
particles.
•
Fermions, which have half-integer spin. The state vector of N identical
fermions is totally antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two
of these particles.
Consider a basis {|ni⟩, i = 1, 2, . . .} of the one particle Hilbert space.
Consider a system of N identical particles, which we number arbitrarily from
1 to N.
(a) If the particles are bosons, the state vector of the system with N1
particles in the state |n1⟩, N2 particles in the state |n2⟩, etc., is:

cle in the state |n1⟩, another in the state |n2⟩, etc., is given by the Slater

Since the state vector is antisymmetric, two fermions cannot be in the same

Rabi Oscillation
Consider a two-level system |±⟩, of Hamiltonian ˆH0 = ¯hω0|+⟩⟨+|. We couple
these two states with a Hamiltonian ˆH1:
ˆH1 = ¯hω1

e−iωt|+⟩⟨−| + eiωt|−⟩⟨+|

.
We assume that the state of the system is |−⟩at time t = 0. The probability
to ﬁnd the system in the state |+⟩at time t is:
P(t) = ω2

Ω2 sin2(ΩT/2)
with
Ω2 = (ω −ω0)2 + ω2

Time-Dependent Perturbation Theory
We consider a system whose Hamiltonian is ˆH(t) = ˆH0 + ˆH1(t). We assume
the eigenstates |n⟩of ˆH0 and the corresponding energies En are known. At
time t = 0, we assume that the system is in the eigenstate |i⟩of ˆH0. To ﬁrst
order in ˆH1, the probability amplitude to ﬁnd the system in another eigenstate
|f⟩at time t is:

where we have set ¯hω = Ef −Ei.
Fermi’s Golden Rule and Exponential Decay
Consider a system with an unperturbed Hamiltonian ˆH0. Initially, the system
is in an eigenstate |i⟩of energy Ei. We assume that this system is coupled to
a continuum {|f⟩} of eigenstates of ˆH0 by the time-independent perturbation
ˆV . For simplicity, we assume that the matrix elements ⟨f| ˆV |i⟩only depend
on the energies Ef of the states |f⟩.
To lowest order in ˆV , this coupling results in a ﬁnite lifetime τ of the state
|i⟩: the probability to ﬁnd the system in the state |i⟩at time t > 0 is e−t/τ
with:
1
τ = 2π
¯h |⟨f| ˆV |i⟩|2 ρ(Ei) .
The matrix element ⟨f| ˆV |i⟩is evaluated for a state |f⟩of energy Ef = Ei.
The function ρ(E) is the density of ﬁnal states. For non relativistic particles

When the spin degree of freedom of the particle comes into play, this density of
state must be multiplied by the number of possible spin states 2s + 1, where
s is the spin of the particle. The quantity L3 represents the normalization
volume (and cancels identically with the normalization factors of the states
|i⟩and |f⟩). Consider an atomic transition treated as a two-level system,
an excited state |e⟩and a ground state |g⟩, separated by an energy ¯hω and

9 Collision Processes
Born Approximation
We consider an elastic collision process of a non-relativistic particle of mass
m with a ﬁxed potential V (r). To second order in V , the elastic scattering
cross-section for an incident particle in the initial momentum state p and the
ﬁnal momentum state p′ is given by:

where E = p2/(2m).
Scattering by a Bound State
We consider a particle a of mass m undergoing an elastic scattering on a
system composed of n particles b1, . . . , bn. These n particles form a bound
state whose wave function is ψ0(r1, . . . , rn). In Born approximation, the cross
section is

The potential Vj represents the interaction between particles a and bj. The
form factor Fj is deﬁned by:
Fj(q) =

eiq·rj/¯h |ψ0(r1, ..., rj, ..., rn)|2 d3r1 . . . d3rj . . . d3rn .
In general, interference eﬀects can be observed between the various q con-
tributing to the sum which deﬁnes V(q). In the case of a charge distribution,
˜V is the Rutherford amplitude, and the form factor F is the Fourier transform
of the charge density.
General Scattering Theory
In order to study the general problem of the scattering of a particle of mass
m by a potential V (r), it is useful to determine the positive energy E =
¯h2k2/(2m) eigenstates of ˆH = ˆp2/(2m) + V (r) whose asymptotic form is
ψk(r)
∼
|r|→∞eik·r + f(k, u, u′) eikr
r
.
This corresponds to the superposition of an incident plane wave eik·r and
a scattered wave. Such a state is called a stationary scattering state. The
scattering amplitude f depends on the energy, on the incident direction u =
k/k, and on the ﬁnal direction u′ = r/r. The diﬀerential cross section is given
by:
dσ
dΩ= |f(k, u, u′)|2 .
The scattering amplitude is given by the implicit equation
f(k, u, u′) = −m
2π¯h2

e−ik′·r′ V (r′) ψk(r′) d3r′
with
k′ = ku′ .
We recover Born’s approximation by choosing ψk(r′) ≃eik·r.

Summary of Quantum Mechanics
Low Energy Scattering
When the wavelength of the incident particle λ ∼k−1 is large compared to
the range of the potential, the amplitude f does not depend on u and u′ (at
least if the potential decreases faster than r−3 at inﬁnity). The scattering is
isotropic. The limit as = −limk→0 f(k) is called the scattering length.

Neutrino Oscillations
In β decay or, more generally, in Weak interactions, the electron is always
associated with a neutral particle, the neutrino νe. There exists in nature
another particle, the µ lepton, or muon, whose physical properties seem com-
pletely analogous to those of the electron, except for its mass mµ ≃200 me.
The muon has the same Weak interactions as the electron, but it is associated
to a diﬀerent neutrino, the νµ.
A neutrino beam produced in an accelerator can interact with a neutron
(n) in a nucleus and give rise to the reactions
νe + n →p + e
and
νµ + n →p + µ ,
(1.1)
whereas the reactions νe + n →p + µ or νµ + n →p + e are never observed.
The reactions (1.1) are used in practice in order to detect neutrinos.
Similarly, a π−meson can decay via the modes
π−→µ + ¯νµ
(dominant mode) and
π−→e + ¯νe ,
(1.2)
whereas π−→µ + ¯νe or π−→e + ¯νµ are never observed. This is how one can
produce neutrinos abundantly (it is easy to produce π mesons). In (1.2) we
have introduced the antiparticles ¯νµ et ¯νe. There is a (quasi) strict symmetry
between particles and their antiparticles, so that, in the same way as the
electron is associated with the neutrino νe, the antielectron, or positron, e+
is associated with the antineutrino ¯νe. One observes the “charge-conjugate”
reactions of (1.1) and (1.2)
¯νe + p →n + e+ ,
¯νµ + p →n + µ+
and
π+ →µ+ + νµ .
(1.3)
In all what follows, what we will say about neutrinos holds symmetrically for
antineutrinos.
In 1975, a third lepton, the τ, was discovered. It is much more massive,
mµ ≃3500 me, it is associated with its own neutrino ντ, and it obeys the
same physical laws as the two lighter leptons, except for mass eﬀects. Since the

18
1 Neutrino Oscillations
1990’s, the experimental measurements at the LEP colliding ring in CERN
have shown that these three neutrinos νe, νµ, ντ (and their antiparticles) are
the only ones of their kinds (at least for masses less that 100 GeV/c2).
For a long time, physicists believed that neutrinos were zero-mass particles,
as is the photon. In any case, their masses (multiplied by c2) are considerably
smaller than the energies involved in experiments where they are observed.
Therefore, many experimental limits on these masses are consistent with zero.
However, both theoretical and cosmological arguments suggested that this
might not be the case. The proof that neutrino masses are not all zero is a
great discovery of the last ten years.
In the present study, we show how the mass diﬀerences of neutrinos can
be measured by a quantum oscillation eﬀect. The idea is that the “ﬂavor”
neutrinos νe, νµ and ντ, which are produced or detected experimentally are
not eigenstates of the mass, but rather linear combinations of mass eigenstates
ν1, ν2, ν3, with masses m1, m2, m3.
The neutrinos observed on earth have various origins. They can be pro-
duced in accelerators, in nuclear reactors, and also in the atmosphere by cos-
mic rays, or in thermonuclear reaction inside stars, in particular the core of
the sun, and in supernovae explosions.
1.1 Mechanism of the Oscillations; Reactor Neutrinos
In this ﬁrst part, we consider oscillations between two types of neutrinos, the
νe and the νµ. This simple case will allow us to understand the underlying
physics of the general case. We will analyze the data obtained with nuclear
reactors. The average energy of the (anti-)neutrinos produced in reactors is
E = 4 MeV, with a dispersion of the same order.
In all what follows, we will assume that if m is the neutrino mass and p
and E its momentum and energy, the mass is so small that the energy of a
neutrino of mass m and momentum p is
E =

p2c2 + m2c4 ≃pc + m2c4
2pc
,
(1.4)
and that the neutrino propagates to very good approximation at the velocity
of light c.
Let ˆH be the Hamiltonian of a free neutrino of momentum p, which we
assume to be well deﬁned. We note |ν1⟩and |ν2⟩the two eigenstates of ˆH:
ˆH|νj⟩= Ej|νj⟩,
Ej = pc + m2
jc4
2pc
,
j = 1, 2 .
m1 and m2 are the respective masses of the states |ν1⟩and |ν2⟩, and we assume
m1 ̸= m2.

1.1 Mechanism of the Oscillations; Reactor Neutrinos
19
The oscillations of freely propagating neutrinos come from the following
quantum eﬀect. If the physical states of the neutrinos which are produced
(reactions (1.2)) or detected (reactions (1.1)) are not |ν1⟩and |ν2⟩, but linear
combinations of these:
|νe⟩= |ν1⟩cos θ + |ν2⟩sin θ ,
|νµ⟩= −|ν1⟩sin θ + |ν2⟩cos θ
(1.5)
where θ is a mixing angle to be determined, these linear combination of energy
eigenstates oscillate in time and this leads to measurable eﬀects.
1.1.1. At time t = 0, one produces a neutrino of momentum p in the state
|νe⟩. Calculate the state |ν(t)⟩at time t in terms of |ν1⟩and |ν2⟩.
1.1.2. What is the probability Pe for this neutrino to be detected in the state
|νe⟩at time t? The result will be expressed in terms of the mixing angle θ and
of the oscillation length L
L =
4π¯hp
|∆m2| c2 ,
∆m2 = m2
1 −m2
2 .
(1.6)
1.1.3. Calculate the oscillation length L for an energy E ≃pc = 4 MeV and
a mass diﬀerence ∆m2c4 = 10−4 eV2.
1.1.4. One measures the neutrino ﬂuxes with a detector located at a distance
ℓfrom the production area. Express the probability Pe as a function of the
distance ℓ= ct.
1.1.5. The mass of the muon satisﬁes mµc2 = 106 MeV. Conclude that in
such an experiment one cannot detect muon neutrinos νµ with the reaction
(1.1). We recall that mpc2 = 938.27 MeV and mnc2 = 939.57 MeV.
1.1.6. The detectors measure neutrino ﬂuxes with an accuracy of ∼10%.
(a) Assuming ∆m2c4 = 10−4 eV2, determine the minimal distance ℓmin
where to put a detector in order to detect an oscillation eﬀect. For this
calculation, assume the mixing in (1.5) is maximum, i.e. θ = π/4.
(b) How does ℓmin change if the mixing is not maximum?
1.1.7. Several experiments on neutrinos produced by nuclear energy plants
have been performed in Chooz and in Bugey in France. The most recent data
comes from the KamLAND collaboration, in Japan. The results are given on
Fig. 1.1.
(a) Explain the results of Fig. 1.1, except that of KamLAND.
(b) The KamLAND experiment, which was performed in 2002, consisted
in measuring the neutrinos coming from all the (numerous) reactors in
Japan and neighboring countries, which amounts to taking an average
distance of ℓ= 180 km. Putting together that data and the results of
numerous experiments performed on solar neutrinos, the physicists of
Kamland come to the following results:

1.2 Oscillations of Three Species; Atmospheric Neutrinos
We now consider the general formalism with three neutrino species. We denote
|να⟩, α = e, µ, τ the “ﬂavor” neutrinos and |νi⟩, i = 1, 2, 3 the mass eigen-
states. These two bases are related to one another by the Maki-Nagawaka-

where cij = cos θij and sij = sin θij. The complete experimental solution of
the problem would consist in measuring the three mixing angles θ12, θ23, θ13,
the phase δ, and the three masses m1, m2, m3. We consider situations such
that (1.4) is still valid.
1.2.1. At time t = 0 a neutrino is produced with momentum p in the state
|ν(0)⟩= |να⟩. Express, in terms of the matrix elements Uαi, its state at a

later time t. Write the probability Pα→β(t) to observe a neutrino of ﬂavor β
at time t.
1.2.2. We deﬁne the oscillation lengths at an energy E ≃pc by:
Lij =
4π¯hp
|∆m2
ij|c2 ,
∆m2
ij = m2
i −m2
j .
(1.9)
Notice that there are only two independent oscillation lengths since ∆m2
12 +
∆m2
23 + ∆m2
31 = 0. For neutrinos of energy E = 4 GeV, calculate the oscilla-
tion lengths L12 and L23. We will choose for |∆m2
12| the result given in (1.7),
and we will choose |∆m2
23| c4 = 2.5 ×10−3 eV2, a value which will be justiﬁed
later on.
1.2.3. The neutrino counters have an accuracy of the order of 10% and the
energy is E = 4 GeV. Above which distances ℓ12 and ℓ23 of the production
point of the neutrinos can one hope to detect oscillations coming from the
superpositions 1 ↔2 and 2 ↔3?
1.2.4. The Super-Kamiokande experiment, performed in 1998, consists in de-
tecting “atmospheric” neutrinos. Such neutrinos are produced in the collision
of high energy cosmic rays with nuclei in the atmosphere at high altitudes.
In a series of reactions, π± mesons are produced abundantly, and they decay
through the chain:
π−→µ−+ ¯νµ
followed by
µ−→e−+ ¯νe + νµ ,
(1.10)
and an analogous chain for π+ mesons. The neutrino ﬂuxes are detected in
an underground detector by the reactions (1.1) and (1.3).
To simplify things, we assume that all muons decay before reaching the
surface of the Earth. Deduce that, in the absence of neutrino oscillations, the
expected ratio between electron and muon neutrinos
Rµ/e = N(νµ) + N(¯νµ)
N(νe) + N(¯νe)
would be equal to 2.
1.2.5. The corrections to the ratio Rµ/e due to the fact that part of the
muons reach the ground can be calculated accurately. Once this correction is
made, one ﬁnds, by comparing the measured and calculated values for Rµ/e
(Rµ/e)measured
(Rµ/e)calculated
= 0.64 (± 0.05) .
In order to explain this relative decrease of the number of νµ’s, one can think
of oscillations of the types νµ ⇀
↽νe and νµ ⇀
↽ντ. The Super-Kamiokande ex-
periment consists in varying the time of ﬂight of the neutrinos by measuring
selectively the direction where they come from, as indicated on Fig. 1.2. The

neutrinos coming from above (cos α ∼1) have traveled a distance equal to the
atmospheric height plus the depth of the detector, while those coming from
the bottom (cos α ∼−1) have crossed the diameter of the Earth (13 400 km).
Given the weakness of the interaction of neutrinos with matter, one can con-
sider that the neutrinos propagate freely on a measurable distance between a
few tens of km and 13 400 km.
The neutrino energies are typically 4 GeV in this experiment. Can one
observe a νe ⇀
↽νµ oscillation of the type studied in the ﬁrst part?
1.2.6. The angular distributions of the νe and the νµ are represented on
Fig. 1.2, together with the distributions one would observe in the absence
of oscillations. Explain why this data is compatible with the fact that one
observes a νµ ⇀
↽ντ oscillation, no νe ⇀
↽ντ oscillation, and no νe ⇀
↽νµ
oscillation.

1.3 Solutions

1.2.7. In view of the above results, we assume that there is only a two-
neutrino oscillation phenomenon: νµ ⇀
↽ντ in such an observation. We there-
fore use the same formalism as in the ﬁrst part, except that we change the
names of particles.
By comparing the muon neutrino ﬂux coming from above and from below,
give an estimate of the mixing angle θ23. In order to take into account the large
energy dispersion of cosmic rays, and therefore of atmospheric neutrinos, we
replace the oscillating factor sin2(πℓ/L23) by its mean value 1/2 if ℓ≫L23.
The complete results published by the Super-Kamiokande experiment are
|∆m2
23| c4 = 2.5 × 10−3 eV2 ,
θ23 = π/4 ,
θ13 = 0 .
Do they agree with the above considerations?
1.3 Solutions
Section 1.1:
Mechanism of the Oscillations: Reactor Neutrinos
1.1.1. Initially, the neutrino state is |ν(0)⟩= |νe⟩= |ν1⟩cos θ + |ν2⟩sin θ.
Therefore, we have at time t
|ν(t)⟩= |ν1⟩cos θ e−iE1t/¯h + |ν2⟩sin θ e−iE2t/¯h .
1.1.2. The probability to ﬁnd this neutrino in the state |νe⟩at time t is

1.1.3. For an energy E = pc = 4 MeV and a mass diﬀerence ∆m2c4 =

1.1.5. A νµ energy of only 4 MeV is below the threshold of the reaction
νµ +n →p+µ. Therefore this reaction does not occur with reactor neutrinos,
and one cannot measure the νµ ﬂux.
1.1.6. In order to detect a signiﬁcant decrease in the neutrino ﬂux νe, we
must have
sin2(2θ) sin2

πℓ
L

> 0.1 .
(a) For the maximum mixing θ = π/4, i.e. sin2(2θ) = 1, this implies πℓ/L >
0.32 or ℓ> L/10. For E = 4 MeV and ∆m2c4 = 10−4 eV2, one ﬁnds ℓ>
10 km. The typical distances necessary to observe this phenomenon are of the
order of a fraction of the oscillation length.
(b) If the mixing is not maximum, one must operate at distances ℓgreater
than L/10. Note that is the mixing angle is too small, (sin2(2θ) < 0.1 i.e.
θ < π/10), the oscillation amplitude is too weak to be detected, whatever the
distance ℓ. In that case, one must improve the detection eﬃciency to obtain
a positive conclusion.
1.1.7.
(a) In all experiments except KamLAND, the distance is smaller
than 1 km. Therefore, in all of these experiments |1 −Pe| ≤10−3. The oscil-
lation eﬀect is not detectable if the estimate |∆m2| c4 ∼10−4 eV2 is correct.
(b) For |∆m2| c4 = 7.1×10−5 eV2, tan2 θ = 0.45 and ℓ= 180 km, we obtain
Pe = 0.50 which agrees with the measurement. The theoretical prediction
taking into account the eﬀects due to the dispersion in energy is drawn on
Fig. 1.3. We see incidentally how important it is to control error bars in such
an experiment.

1.2.2. We have Lij = 4π¯hE/(|∆m2
ij| c3). The oscillation lengths are propor-
tional to the energy. We can use the result of question 1.3, with a conversion
factor of 1000 to go from 4 MeV to 4 GeV.
•
For |∆m2
12| c4 = 7.1 × 10−5 eV2, we ﬁnd L12 = 140 000 km.
•
For |∆m2
23| c4 = 2.5 × 10−3 eV2, we ﬁnd L23 = 4 000 km.
1.2.3. We want to know the minimal distance necessary in order to observe
oscillations. We assume that both mixing angles θ12 and θ23 are equal to
π/4, which corresponds to maximum mixing. We saw in the ﬁrst part that if
this mixing is not maximum, the visibility of the oscillations is reduced and
that the distance which is necessary to observe the oscillation phenomenon is
increased.
By resuming the argument of the ﬁrst part, we ﬁnd that the modiﬁcation of
the neutrino ﬂux of a given species is detectable beyond a distance ℓij such that
sin2(πℓij/Lij) ≥0.1 i.e. ℓij ≥Lij/10. This corresponds to ℓ12 ≥14000 km for
the oscillation resulting from the superposition 1 ↔2, and ℓ23 ≥400 km for
the oscillation resulting from the superposition 2 ↔3.
1.2.4. The factor of 2 between the expected muon and electron neutrino
ﬂuxes comes from a simple counting. Each particle π−(resp. π+) gives rise to
a νµ, a ¯νµ and a ¯νe (resp. a νµ, a ¯νµ and a νe). In practice, part of the muons
reach the ground before decaying, which modiﬁes this ratio. Naturally, this
eﬀect is taken into account in an accurate treatment of the data.
1.2.5. For an energy of 4 GeV, we have found that the minimum distance to
observe the oscillation resulting from the 1 ↔2 superposition is 14000 km. We
therefore remark that the oscillations νe ⇀
↽νµ, corresponding to the mixing
1 ↔2 which we studied in the ﬁrst part cannot be observed at terrestrial
distances. At such energies (4 GeV) and for evolution times corresponding at

26
1 Neutrino Oscillations
most to the diameter of the Earth (0.04 s), the energy diﬀerence E1 −E2 and
the oscillations that it induces can be neglected.
However, if the estimate |∆m2
23| c4 > 10−3eV2 is correct, the terrestrial
distance scales allow in principle to observe oscillations resulting from 2 ↔3
and 1 ↔3 superpositions, which correspond to νµ ⇀
↽ντ or νe ⇀
↽ντ.
1.2.6. The angular distribution (therefore the distribution in ℓ) observed for
the νe’s does not show any deviation from the prediction made without any
oscillation. However, there is a clear indication for νµ oscillations: there is a
deﬁcit of muon neutrinos coming from below, i.e. those which have had a long
time to evolve.
The deﬁcit in muon neutrinos is not due to the oscillation νe ⇀
↽νµ of the
ﬁrst part. Indeed, we have seen in the previous question that this oscillation is
negligible at time scales of interest. The experimental data of Fig. 1.2 conﬁrm
this observation. The deﬁcit in muon neutrinos coming from below is not
accompanied with an increase of electron neutrinos. The eﬀect can only be
due to a νµ ⇀
↽ντ oscillation.1
No oscillation νe ⇀
↽ντ appears in the data. In the framework of the present
model, this is interpreted as the signature of a very small (if not zero) θ13
mixing angle.
1.2.7. Going back to the probability (1.11) written in question 1.4, the prob-
ability for an atmospheric muon neutrino νµ to be detected as a νµ is:
P(ℓ) = 1 −sin2(2θ23) sin2

 πℓ
L23

,
(1.12)
where the averaging is performed on the energy distribution of the neutrino.
If we measure the neutrino ﬂux coming from the top, we have ℓ≪L23, which
gives Ptop = 1. If the neutrino comes from the bottom, the term sin2(πℓ/L23)
averages to 1/2 and we ﬁnd:
Pbottom = 1 −1
2 sin2(2θ23) .
The experimental data indicate that for −1 ≤cos α ≤−0.5, Pbottom = 1/2.
The distribution is very ﬂat at a value of 100 events, i.e. half of the top value
(200 events).
We deduce that sin2(2θ23) = 1, i.e. θ23 = π/4 and a maximum mixing
angle for νµ ⇀
↽ντ. The results published by Super-Kamiokande fully agree
with this analysis.
1 For completeness, physicists have also examined the possibility of a “sterile” neu-
trino oscillation, i.e. an oscillation with a neutrino which would have no detectable
interaction with matter.

The diﬃculty of such experiments comes from the smallness of the neutrino in-
teraction cross sections with matter. The detectors are enormous water tanks,
where about ten events per day are observed (for instance ¯νe + p →e+ + n).
The “accuracy” of a detector comes mainly from the statistics, i.e. the total
number of events observed.
In 1998, the ﬁrst undoubted observation of the oscillation ντ ⇀
↽νµ was
announced in Japan by the Super-Kamiokande experiment Fukuda Y. et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1562 (1998)). This experiment uses a detector containing
50 000 tons of water, inside which 11 500 photomutipliers detect the Cherenkov
light of the electrons or muons produced. About 60 ντ’s were also detected, but
this ﬁgure is too small to give further information. An accelerator experiment
conﬁrmed the results afterwards (K2K collaboration, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90,
041801 (2003)).
The KamLAND experiment is a collaboration between Japanese, Ameri-
can and Chinese physicists. The detector is a 1000 m3 volume ﬁlled with liq-
uid scintillator (an organic liquid with global formula C-H). The name means

Very many experimental results come from solar neutrinos, which we have
not dealt with here. This problem is extremely important, but somewhat too
complex for our purpose. The pioneering work is due to Davis in his celebrated
paper of 1964 (R. Davis Jr., Phys. Rev Lett. 13, 303 (1964)). Davis operated
on a 37Cl perchlorethylene detector and counted the number of 37Ar atoms
produced. In 25 years, his overall statistics has been 2200 events, i.e. one atom
every 3 days! In 1991, the SAGE experiment done with Gallium conﬁrmed
the deﬁcit (A. I. Abasov et al., Phys. Rev Lett. 67, 3332 (1991) and J. N.
Abdurashitov et al., Phys. Rev Lett. 83, 4686 (1999)). In 1992, the GALLEX
experiment, using a Gallium target in the Gran Sasso, also conﬁrmed the solar
neutrino deﬁcit (P. Anselmann et al., Phys. Lett. B285, 376 (1992)). In 2001
the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) gave decisive experimental results
on solar neutrinos (Q.R. Ahmad et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 071307 (2001) and
89, 011301 (2002); see also M.B. Smy, Mod. Phys. Lett. A 17, 2163 (2002)).
The 2002 Nobel prize for physics was awarded to Raymond Davis Jr. and
Masatoshi Koshiba, who are the pioneers of this chapter of neutrino physics.

Atomic Clocks
We are interested in the ground state of the external electron of an alkali
atom (rubidium, cesium,...). The atomic nucleus has a spin sn (sn = 3/2 for
87Rb, sn = 7/2 for 133Cs), which carries a magnetic moment µn. As in the
case of atomic hydrogen, the ground state is split by the hyperﬁne interaction
between the electron magnetic moment and the nuclear magnetic moment
µn. This splitting of the ground state is used to devise atomic clocks of high
accuracy, which have numerous applications such as ﬂight control in aircrafts,
the G.P.S. system, the measurement of physical constants etc.
In all the chapter, we shall neglect the eﬀects due to internal core electrons.
2.1 The Hyperﬁne Splitting of the Ground State
2.1.1. Give the degeneracy of the ground state if one neglects the magnetic
interaction between the nucleus and the external electron. We note
|me; mn⟩= |electron: se = 1/2, me⟩⊗|nucleus: sn, mn⟩
a basis of the total spin states (external electron + nucleus).
2.1.2. We now take into account the interaction between the electron mag-
netic moment µe and the nuclear magnetic moment µn. As in the hydrogen
atom, one can write the corresponding Hamiltonian (restricted to the spin
subspace) as:
ˆH = A
¯h2 ˆSe · ˆSn ,
where A is a characteristic energy, and where ˆSe and ˆSn are the spin operators
of the electron and the nucleus, respectively. We want to ﬁnd the eigenvalues
of this Hamiltonian.
We introduce the operators ˆSe,± = ˆSe,x ± i ˆSe,y and ˆSn,± = ˆSn,x ± i ˆSn,y.

2.2 The Atomic Fountain
The atoms are initially prepared in the energy state E1, and are sent up-
wards (Fig. 2.1). When they go up and down they cross a cavity where an
electromagnetic wave of frequency ω is injected. This frequency is close to
ω0 = (E1 −E2)/¯h. At the end of the descent, one detects the number of
atoms which have ﬂipped from the E1 level to the E2 level. In all what fol-
lows, the motion of the atoms in space (free fall) is treated classically. It is only
the evolution of their internal state which is treated quantum-mechanically.
In order to simplify things, we consider only one atom in the sub-level of
energy E1. This state (noted |1⟩) is coupled by the electromagnetic wave to
only one state (noted |2⟩) of the sublevel of energy E2. By convention, we ﬁx
the origin of energies at (E1 + E2)/2, i.e. E1 = ¯hω0/2, E2 = −¯hω0/2. We
assume that the time ϵ to cross the cavity is very brief and that this crossing
results in an evolution of the state vector of the form:
|ψ(t)⟩= α|1⟩+ β|2⟩−→|ψ(t + ϵ)⟩= α′|1⟩+ β′|2⟩,

.
2.2.1. The initial state of the atom is |ψ(0)⟩= |1⟩. We consider a single
round-trip of duration T, during which the atom crosses the cavity between
t = 0 and t = ϵ, then evolves freely during a time T −2ϵ, and crosses the
cavity a second time between T −ϵ and T. Taking the limit ϵ →0, show that
the state of the atom after this round-trip is given by:
|ψ(T)⟩= i e−iωT/2 sin((ω −ω0)T/2) |1⟩−i eiωT/2 cos((ω −ω0)T/2) |2⟩(2.1)
2.2.2. Give the probability P(ω) to ﬁnd an atom in the state |2⟩at time T.
Determine the half-width ∆ω of P(ω) at the resonance ω = ω0. What is the
values of ∆ω for a 1 meter high fountain? We recall the acceleration of gravity
g = 9.81 ms−2.
2.2.3. We send a pulse of N atoms (N ≫1). After the round-trip, each atom
is in the state given by (2.1). We measure separately the numbers of atoms
in the states |1⟩and |2⟩, which we note N1 and N2 (with N1 + N2 = N).
What is the statistical distribution of the random variables N1 and N2? Give
their mean values and their r.m.s. deviations ∆Ni. Set φ = (ω −ω0)T/2 and
express the results in terms of cos φ, sin φ and N.
2.2.4. The departure from resonance |ω −ω0| is characterized by the value of
cos((ω−ω0)T) = ⟨N2 −N1⟩/N. Justify this formula. Evaluate the uncertainty
∆|ω −ω0| introduced by the random nature of the variable N2 −N1. Show
that this uncertainty depends on N, but not on φ.
2.2.5. In Fig. 2.2 we have represented the precision of an atomic clock as
a function of the number N of atoms per pulse. Does this variation with N
agree with the previous results?

2.3 The GPS System
The GPS system uses 24 satellites orbiting around the Earth at 20 000 km.
Each of them contains an atomic clock. Each satellite sends, at equal spaced
time intervals, an electromagnetic signal composed of a “click” from a clock
and the indication of its position. A reception device on Earth, which does
not have an atomic clock, detects the signals coming from several satellites.
With its own (quartz) clock, it compares the times at which diﬀerent “clicks”
arrive.
2.3.1. What is the minimum number of satellites that one must see at a given
time in order to be able to position oneself in latitude, in longitude, and in
altitude on the surface of the Earth?
2.3.2. We assume that the relative accuracy of each clock is ∆ω/ω = 10−13
and that the clocks are synchronized every 24 hours. What is the order of
magnitude of the accuracy of the positioning just before the clocks undergo a
new synchronization?
2.4 The Drift of Fundamental Constants
Some cosmological models predict a (small) variation in time of the ﬁne struc-
ture constant α = e2/(¯hc) ∼1/137. In order to test such an assumption, one
can compare two atomic clocks, one using rubidium (Z = 37) atoms, the other
cesium (Z = 55) atoms. In fact, one can show that the hyperﬁne splitting of
an alkali atom varies approximately as:
E1 −E2 = ¯hω0 ∝α2

2.1.1. The Hilbert space of the ground state is the tensor product of the
electron spin space and the nucleus spin space. Its dimension d is therefore
the product of their dimensions, i.e. d = 2 × (2sn + 1).

and a similar relation for ˆSn,x and ˆSn,y, one obtains the wanted result.
(b) The action of ˆSe,+ ˆSn,−and ˆSe,−ˆSn,+ on |me = 1/2; mn = sn⟩gives the
null vector. The same holds for |me = −1/2; mn = −sn⟩. Therefore, only the
term contributes ˆSe,z ˆSn,z and one ﬁnds:
ˆH |me = 1/2; mn = sn⟩= Asn

|me = 1/2; mn = sn⟩
ˆH |me = −1/2; mn = −sn⟩= Asn

(d) >From the previous question, one concludes that the 2-dimensional sub-
spaces Emn generated by |1/2; mn⟩and | −1/2; mn + 1⟩are globally stable
under the action of ˆH. The determination of the eigenvalues of ˆH therefore
consists in diagonalizing the series of 2 × 2 matrices corresponding to its re-
striction to these subspaces. The matrix corresponding to the restriction of ˆH
to the subspace Emn is the same as given in the text.

2.1.3. The eigenvalues given in the text are actually independent of mn.
They are Asn/2 and −A(1 + sn)/2. In the case sn = 1/2 (hydrogen atom),
these two eigenvalues are A/4 and −3A/4.
2.1.4. There are 2sn 2 × 2 matrices to be diagonalized, each of which gives a
vector associated to Asn/2 and a vector associated to −A(1 + sn)/2. In addi-
tion we have found two independent eigenvectors, |1/2, sn⟩and | −1/2, −sn⟩,
associated to the eigenvalue Asn/2. We therefore obtain:
Asn/2
degenerated 2sn + 2 times
−A(1 + sn/2)
degenerated 2sn times
We do recover the dimension 2(2sn + 1) of the total spin space of the ground
state.
2.1.5. The square of the total spin is:
ˆS
2 = ˆS

e + ˆS

n are proportional to the identity and are respectively:

e = 3¯h2

n = ¯h2sn(sn + 1) .
An eigenstate of ˆH is therefore an eigenstate of ˆS
2. More precisely, an eigen-
state of ˆH with eigenvalue Asn/2 is an eigenstate of ˆS
2 with eigenvalue
¯h2(sn + 1/2)(sn + 3/2), corresponding to a total spin s = sn + 1/2. An eigen-
state of ˆH with eigenvalue −A(1+sn)/2 is an eigenstate of ˆS
2 with eigenvalue
¯h2(sn −1/2)(sn + 1/2), i.e. a total spin s = sn −1/2.
Section 2.2:

which corresponds to crossing the cavity, at time t = 0, then to a free evolution
between t = 0 and t = T, then a second crossing of the cavity at time t = T.
We therefore obtain the state vector of the text.
2.2.2. One ﬁnds P(ω) = |β′|2 = cos2((ω −ω0)T/2). This probability is equal
to 1 if one sits exactly at the resonance (ω = ω0). It is 1/2 if ω = ω0 ±π/(2T).
For a round-trip free fall motion of height H = 1 m, we have T = 2

2H/g,
i.e. T = 0.9 s and ∆ω = 1.7 s−1.

2.5 Solutions

2.2.3. The detection of each atom gives the result E1 with a probability
sin2 φ and E2 with a probability cos2 φ. Since the atoms are assumed to be
independent, the distributions of the random variables N1 and N2 are binomial
laws. We therefore have:
⟨N1⟩= N sin2 φ
⟨N2⟩= N cos2 φ
∆N1 = ∆N2 =
√
N | cos φ sin φ| .
2.2.4. We do obtain ⟨N2−N1⟩/N = cos 2φ = cos((ω−ω0)T). The ﬂuctuation
on the variable N2 −N1 induces a ﬂuctuation on the determination of ω −ω0.
The two ﬂuctuations are related by:
∆(N2 −N1)
N
= 2 |sin(2φ)| ∆φ .
Since ∆(N2 −N1) = 2 ∆N2 =
√
N |sin 2φ|, we deduce ∆φ = 1/(2
√
N), or
equivalently:
∆|ω −ω0| =
1
2T
√
N
.
The longer the time T and the larger N are, the better the accuracy.
2.2.5. We notice on Fig. 2.2 that the accuracy of the clock improves like
N −1/2, as N increases. For N = 106 and T = 0.9 s, the above formula gives
5.6 × 10−4 s. The hyperﬁne frequency of cesium is ω0 = 2π × 9.2 GHz, which
corresponds to ∆ω/ω ∼10−14.
Section 2.3:
The GPS System
2.3.1. One must see at least 4 satellites. With two of them, the diﬀerence
between the two reception times t1 and t2 of the signals localize the observer
on a surface (for instance on a plane at equal distances of the two satellites
if t1 = t2); three satellites localize the observer on a line, and the fourth one
determines the position of the observer unambiguously (provided of course
that one assumes the observer is not deep inside the Earth or on a far lying
orbit).
2.3.2. Suppose a satellite sends a signal at time t0. This signal is received by
an observer at a distance D at time t1 = t0 + D/c. If the clock of the satellite
has drifted, the signal is not sent at time t0, but at a slightly diﬀerent time
t′
0. The observer whom we assume has a correct time reference from another
satellite, interprets the time t1 −t′
0 as a distance D′ = c(t1 −t′
0), he therefore
makes an error c(t′
0−t0) on his position. For a clock of relative accuracy 10−13,
the typical drift after 24 hours (=86 000 seconds) is 86 000 × 10−13 s, i.e. an
error on the position of 2.5 meters.
Note that the atomic clocks boarding the GPS satellites are noticeably
less accurate than the fountain cold atom clocks in ground laboratories.

Section 2.4:

Using the expression given in the text for the dependence on α of the frequen-

The quantity inside the brackets is 0.22, which leads to an upper bound of
˙α/α of 1.4 × 10−14 per year, i.e. 4.3 × 10−22 per second. If we extrapolate
this variation time to a time of the order of the age of the universe, this
corresponds to a variation of 10−4. Such an eﬀect should be detectable, in
principle, by spectroscopic measurements on very far objects.
Remark: a more precise determination of the α dependence of ωCs, for
which the approximation Zα ≪1 is not very good, gives for the quantity
inside the bracket a value of 0.45.

Neutron Interferometry
In the late 1970s, Overhauser and his collaborators performed several neutron
interference experiments which are of fundamental importance in quantum
mechanics, and which settled debates which had started in the 1930s. We study
in this chapter two of these experiments, aiming to measure the inﬂuence on
the interference pattern (i) of the gravitational ﬁeld and (ii) of a 2π rotation
of the neutron wave function.
We consider here an interferometer made of three parallel, equally spaced
crystalline silicon strips, as shown in Fig. 3.1. The incident neutron beam is
assumed to be monochromatic.
Fig. 3.1. The neutron interferometer: The three “ears” are cut in a silicon monocrys-
tal; C2 and C3 are neutron counters
For a particular value of the angle of incidence θ, called the Bragg angle,
a plane wave ψinc = ei(p·r−Et)/¯h, where E is the energy of the neutrons and
p their momentum, is split by the crystal into two outgoing waves which are
symmetric with respect to the perpendicular direction to the crystal, as shown
in Fig. 3.2.

where |p| = |p′| since the neutrons scatter elastically on the nuclei of the
crystal. The transmission and reﬂection coeﬃcients are T = |α|2 and R = |β|2,
with of course T + R = 1.
In the interferometer shown in Fig. 3.1, the incident neutron beam is hori-
zontal. It is split by the interferometer into a variety of beams, two of which re-
combine and interfere at point D. The detectors C2 and C3 count the outgoing
neutron ﬂuxes. The neutron beam velocity corresponds to a de Broglie wave-
length λ = 1.445 ˚A. We recall the value of neutron mass M = 1.675×10−27 kg.
The neutron beam actually corresponds to wave functions which are quasi-
monochromatic and which have a ﬁnite extension in the transverse directions.
In order to simplify the writing of the equations, we only deal with pure
monochromatic plane waves, as in (3.1).
3.1 Neutron Interferences
3.1.1. The measured neutron ﬂuxes are proportional to the intensities of the
waves that reach the counters. Deﬁning the intensity of the incoming beam
to be 1 (the units are arbitrary), write the amplitudes A2 and A3 of the wave
functions which reach the counters C2 and C3, in terms of α and β (it is not
necessary to write the propagation terms ei(p·r−Et)/¯h).
Calculate the measured intensities I2 and I3 in terms of the coeﬃcients T and
R.
3.1.2. Suppose that we create a phase shift δ of the wave propagating along
AC, i.e. in C the wave function is multiplied by eiδ.
(a) Calculate the new amplitudes A2 and A3 in terms of α, β and δ.
(b) Show that the new measured intensities I2 and I3 are of the form
I2 = µ −ν(1 + cos δ)
I3 = ν(1 + cos δ)
and express µ and ν in terms of T and R.
(c) Comment on the result for the sum I2 + I3 .

3.2 The Gravitational Eﬀect
The phase diﬀerence δ between the beams ACD and ABD is created by
rotating the interferometer by an angle φ around the direction of incidence.
This creates a diﬀerence in the altitudes of BD and AC, which both remain
horizontal, as shown in Fig. 3.3. The diﬀerence in the gravitational potential
energies induces a gravitational phase diﬀerence.
3.2.1. Let d be the distance between the silicon strips, whose thickness is
neglected here. Show that the side L of the lozenge ABCD and its height H,
shown in Fig. 3.3, are related to d and to the Bragg angle θ by L = d/ cos θ
and H = 2d sin θ. Experimentally the values of d and θ are d = 3.6 cm and
θ = 22.1◦.

observe gravitational eﬀects
3.2.2. For an angle φ, we deﬁne the gravitational potential V to be V = 0
along AC and V = V0 along BD.
(a) Calculate the diﬀerence ∆p of the neutron momenta in the beams AC
and BD (use the approximation ∆p ≪p). Express the result in terms of
the momentum p along AC, the height H, sin φ, M, and the acceleration
of gravity g.
(b) Evaluate numerically the velocity √2gH. How good is the approximation
∆p ≪p?
3.2.3. Evaluate the phase diﬀerence δ between the paths ABD and ACD.
One can proceed in two steps:
(a) Compare the path diﬀerence between the segments AB and CD.
(b) Compare the path diﬀerence between the segments BD and AC.
3.2.4. The variation with φ of the experimentally measured intensity I2 in the
counter C2 is represented in Fig. 3.4. (The data does not display a minimum
exactly at φ = 0 because of calibration diﬃculties.)
Deduce from these data the value of the acceleration due to gravity g.

3.3 Rotating a Spin 1/2 by 360 Degrees
The plane of the setup is now horizontal. The phase diﬀerence arises by placing
along AC a magnet of length l which produces a constant uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B0 directed along the z axis, as shown in Fig. 3.5.
Fig. 3.5. Experimental setup for observing the neutron spin Larmor precession
The neutrons are spin-1/2 particles, and have an intrinsic magnetic mo-
ment ˆµ = γn ˆS = µ0 ˆσ where ˆS is the neutron spin operator, and the ˆσi
(i = x, y, z) are the usual 2 × 2 Pauli matrices. The axes are represented in
Fig. 3.5: the beam is along the y axis, the z axis is in the ABCD plane, and
the x axis is perpendicular to this plane.
We assume that the spin variables and the space variables are uncorrelated,
i.e. at any point in space the wave function factorizes as

in terms of the angle δ = ωT/2.

Comparing the values bn of question 3.3 with this experimental result,
and recalling the result of a measurement of µx for these values, explain why
this proves that the state vector of a spin-1/2 particle changes sign under a
rotation by an odd multiple of 2π.
3.4 Solutions
Section 3.1:
Neutron Interferences
3.1.1. The beams ABDC2 and ACDC2 interfere. Omitting the propagation
factors, one has, at C2 an amplitude
A2 = α2β + β3 = β(α2 + β2) .
Similarly, for ABDC3 and ACDC3,
A3 = 2αβ2 .
The intensities at the two counters are
I2 = R −4R2T
I3 = 4R2T .
3.1.2. When there is a phase shift δ in C, the above expressions get modiﬁed
as follows:
A2 = α2βeiδ + β3 = β(α2eiδ + β2) ,
A3 = αβ2(1 + eiδ) .
The intensities become
I2 = R −2R2T (1 + cos δ)
I3 = 2R2T (1 + cos δ) .
The fact that I2 + I3 does not depend on the phase shift δ is a consequence
of the conservation of the total number of particles arriving at D.
Section 3.2:
The Gravitational Eﬀect
3.2.1. This results from elementary trigonometry.
(a) Since there is no recoil energy of the silicon atoms to be taken care of, the
neutron total energy (kinetic+potential) is a constant of the motion in all the
process. This energy is given by EAC = p2/2M and EBD = (p −∆p)2/2M +
MgH sin φ, hence
∆p ≃M 2gH sin φ/p .
(b) The velocity √2gH is of the order of 0.5 m/s, and the neutron velocity
is v = h/Mλ ≃2700 m/s. The change in velocity ∆v is therefore very small:
∆v = gH/v ≃2 × 10−4 m/s for φ = π/2.

3.4 Solutions
43
3.2.2.
(a) The gravitational potential varies in exactly the same way along
AB and CD. The neutron state in both cases is a plane wave with momen-
tum p = h/λ just before A or C. The same Schr¨odinger equation is used to
determine the wave function at the end of the segments. This implies that the
phases accumulated along the two segments AB and CD are equal.
(b) When comparing the segments AC and BD, the previous reasoning does
not apply, since the initial state of the neutron is not the same for the two
segments. The initial state is exp(ipz/¯h) for AC, and exp[i(p −∆p)z/¯h] for
BD. After travelling over a distance L = AC = BD, the phase diﬀerence
between the two paths is
δ = ∆p L
¯h

3.2.3. >From the previous result, one has δ2 −δ1 = A g (sin φ2 −sin φ1),
where A = M 2λd2 tan θ/(π¯h2). Therefore,
g =
δ2 −δ1
A (sin φ2 −sin φ1) .
There are 9 oscillations, i.e. (δ2 −δ1) = 18π, between φ1 = −32◦and φ2 =
+24◦, which gives g ≃9.8 ms−2. The relative precision of the experiment was
actually of the order of 10−3.

3.3.2. When the neutrons leave the ﬁeld zone, the probability of ﬁnding
µx = +µ0 is
Px(+µ0) = |⟨+x|Σ(T)⟩|2 = cos2 ωT

with T = l/v = lMλ/h.
3.3.3. The above probability is equal to 1 if δ = nπ (ωT = 2nπ), or B0 = nb1
with
b1 = 2π2¯h2
µ0Mlλ = 34.5 × 10−4 T .
For δ = nπ the magnetic moment has rotated by 2nπ around the z axis by
Larmor precession.
3.3.4. The formulas are similar to those found in question 1.2. The phase of
the upper component of the spinor written in the {|+⟩z, |−⟩z} basis, is shifted
by +δ, that of the lower component by −δ:
Amplitude at the counter C2 :

3.3.5. Since the measuring apparatus is insensitive to spin variables, we must
add the probabilities corresponding to Sz = ±1, each of which is the modulus
squared of a sum of amplitudes. Altogether, we obtain the following intensities
of the total neutron ﬂux in the two counters:
I2 = R −2R2T (1 + cos δ) ,
I3 = 2R2T(1 + cos δ)
and
I2 −I3 = R −4R2T(1 + cos δ) .
3.3.6. There will be a minimum of I2 −I3 each time cos δ = +1, i.e. δ = 2nπ.
This corresponds to a constructive interference in channel 3. On the other
hand, there appears a maximum if cos δ = −1, i.e. δ = (2n + 1)π, and this
corresponds to a destructive interference in channel 3 (I3 = 0).
If δ = nπ, whatever the integer n, one is sure to ﬁnd the neutrons in
the same spin state as in the initial beam. However, the interference pattern
depends on the parity of n.
The experimental result ∆B = (64 ± 2) × 10−4 T conﬁrms that if the spin
has rotated by 4nπ, one recovers a constructive interference in channel 3 as in
the absence of rotation, while if it has rotated by (4n+2)π, the interference in
C3 is destructive. The probability amplitude for the path ACD has changed
sign in this latter case, although a spin measurement in this path after the
magnet will give exactly the same result as on the incoming beam.

Spectroscopic Measurement
on a Neutron Beam
We present here a very precise method for spectroscopic measurements, due
to Norman Ramsey. The method, using atomic or molecular beams, can be
applied to a very large class of problems. We shall analyse it in the speciﬁc case
of a neutron beam, where it can be used to determine the neutron magnetic
moment with high accuracy, by measuring the Larmor precession frequency
in a magnetic ﬁeld B0.
A beam of neutrons is prepared with velocity v along the x axis. The beam
is placed in a constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0 directed along the z axis.
We write |+⟩and |−⟩for the eigenstates of the z projection ˆSz of the neutron
spin, and γ for the gyromagnetic ratio of the neutron: ˆµ = γ ˆS, ˆµ being the
neutron magnetic moment operator, and ˆS its spin.
The neutrons are initially in the state |−⟩. When they approach the origin,
they cross a zone where an oscillating ﬁeld B1(t) is applied in the (x, y) plane.
The components of B1 are
B1x = B1 e−r/a cos ω(t −z/c)
B1y = B1 e−r/a sin ω(t −z/c)
B1z = 0 ,
(4.1)
where r =

x2 + y2. We assume that B1 is constant (strictly speaking it
should vary in order to satisfy ∇· B = 0) and that B1 ≪B0.
In all parts of the chapter, the neutron motion in space is treated classically
as a linear uniform motion. We are only interested in the quantum evolution
of the spin state.
4.1 Ramsey Fringes
4.1.1. Consider a neutron whose motion in space is x = vt, y = 0, z = 0.
What is the Hamiltonian ˆH(t) describing the coupling of the neutron magnetic
moment with the ﬁelds B0 and B1?

48
4 Spectroscopic Measurement on a Neutron Beam
Setting ω0 = −γB0 and ω1 = −γB1, write the matrix representation of
ˆH(t) in the basis {|+⟩, |−⟩}.
4.1.2. Treating B1 as a perturbation, calculate, in ﬁrst order time-dependent
perturbation theory, the probability of ﬁnding the neutron in the state |+⟩
at time t = +∞(far from the interaction zone) if it was in the state |−⟩at
t = −∞.
One measures the ﬂux of neutrons which have ﬂipped their spins, and are
in the state |+⟩when they leave the ﬁeld zone. This ﬂux is proportional to
the probability P−+ that they have undergone the above transition.
Show that this probability has a resonant behavior as a function of the
applied angular frequency ω. Plot P−+ as a function of the distance from the
resonance ω −ω0. How does the width of the resonance curve vary with v and
a?
The existence of this width puts a limit on the accuracy of the measurement
of ω0, and therefore of γ. Is there an explanation of this on general grounds?
4.1.3. On the path of the beam, one adds a second zone with an oscillating
ﬁeld B′
1. This second zone is identical to the ﬁrst but is translated along the
x axis by a distance b (b ≫a):
B′
1x = B1 e−r′/a cos ω(t −z/c)
B′
1y = B1 e−r′/a sin ω(t −z/c)
B′
1z = 0 ,
(4.2)
where r′ = ((x −b)2 + y2)
1/2.
Show that the transition probability P−+ across the two zones can be
expressed in a simple way in terms of the transition probability calculated in
the previous question.
Why is it preferable to use a setup with two zones separated by a distance b
rather than a single zone, as in question 4.1.2, if one desires a good accuracy in
the measurement of the angular frequency ω0? What is the order of magnitude
of the improvement in the accuracy?
4.1.4. What would be the probability P−+ if one were to use N zones equally
spaced by the same distance b from one another? What optical system is this
reminiscent of?
4.1.5. Suppose now that the neutrons, still in the initial spin state |−⟩,
propagate along the z axis instead of the x axis. Suppose that the length
of the interaction zone is b, i.e. that the oscillating ﬁeld is given by (4.1) for
−b/2 ≤z ≤+b/2 and is zero for |z| > b/2. Calculate the transition probability
P ′
−+ in this new conﬁguration.
For what value of ω is this probability maximum? Explain the diﬀerence
with the result obtained in question 4.1.2.

4.1.6. In practice, the neutron beam has some velocity dispersion around the
value v. Which of the two methods described in questions 4.1.3 and 4.1.5 is
preferable?
4.1.7. Numerical Application: The neutrons of the beam have a de Broglie
wavelength λn = 31 ˚A. Calculate their velocity.
In order to measure the neutron gyromagnetic ratio γn, one proceeds as in
question 4.1.3. One can assume that the accuracy is given by
δω0 = π

b .
The most accurate value of the neutron gyromagnetic ratio is currently
γn = −1.912 041 84 (±8.8 × 10−7) q/Mp
where q is the unit charge and Mp the proton mass. In a ﬁeld B0 = 1 T, what
must be the length b in order to achieve this accuracy?

Fig. 4.1. Transition probability in one zone
The width of the resonance curve is of the order of v/a. This quantity is
the inverse of the time τ = a/v a neutron spends in the oscillating ﬁeld. From
the uncertainty relation δE.τ ∼¯h, when an interaction lasts a ﬁnite time τ the
accuracy of the energy measurement δE is bounded by δE ≥¯h/τ. Therefore,
from ﬁrst principles, one expects that the resonance curve will have a width
of the order of ¯h/τ in energy, or 1/τ in angular frequency.

Fig. 4.2. Ramsey fringes in a two-zone setup
The envelope of this curve is, up to a factor of 4, the same as the previous
curve. However, owing to the extra oscillating factor, the half-width at half-
maximum of the central peak is now of order πv/(2b). The parameter which
now governs the accuracy is the total time b/v that the neutron spends in the
apparatus, going from one zone to the other.
In spectroscopic measurements, it is important to locate the exact position
of the maximum of the peak. Multiplying the width of the peak by a factor
a/b (≪1 since a ≪b) results in a major improvement of the measurement
accuracy. Of course one could in principle build a single interaction zone of
large size ∼b, but it would be diﬃcult to maintain a well controlled oscillating
ﬁeld over such a large region. From a practical point of view, it is much simpler
to use small interaction zones of size a and to separate them by a large distance
b.

As far as amplitudes are concerned, there is a complete analogy with a dif-
fraction grating in optics.
The neutron (more generally, the particle or the atom) has some transition
amplitude t for undergoing a spin ﬂip in a given interaction zone. The total
amplitude T is the sum
T = t + t eiφ + t e2iφ + . . . ,
where eiφ is the phase shift between two zones.
4.1.5. We now set z = vt, and x = y = 0 for the neutron trajectory. This
will modify the phase of the ﬁeld (Doppler eﬀect)
ω(t −z/c) →ω(1 −v/c)t = ˜ωt
with
˜ω = ω (1 −v/c)
and we must integrate the evolution of ˜α:
i ˙˜α = ω1
2 ei(ω0−˜ω)t ˜β
(with ˜β ≃1) between ti = −b/(2v) and tf = b/(2v). The transition probability
is then

which has a width of the order of b/v but is centered at
˜ω = ω0 ⇒ω =
ω0
1 −v/c ≃ω0 (1 + v/c) .
Comparing with question 4.1.2, we ﬁnd that the resonance frequency is dis-
placed: The neutron moves in the propagation direction of the ﬁeld, and there
is a ﬁrst order Doppler shift of the resonance frequency.
4.1.6. If the neutron beam has some velocity dispersion, the experimental
result will be the same as calculated above, but smeared over the velocity
distribution.
In the method of question 4.1.3, the position of lateral fringes, and the
width of the central peak, vary with v. A velocity distribution will lead to

4.2 Solutions
53
a broader central peak and lateral fringes of decreasing amplitude. However
the position of the central peak does not depend on the velocity, and it is
therefore not shifted if the neutron beam has some velocity dispersion.
On the contrary, in the method of question 4.1.5, the position of the cen-
tral peak depends directly on the velocity. A dispersion in v will lead to a
corresponding dispersion of the position of the peak we want to measure.
The ﬁrst method is highly preferable.
4.1.7. Numerically, for λn = 31 ˚A, v = h/(Mnλn) ≃128 m/s.
Experimentally, one obtains an accuracy δω0/ω0 = δγn/γn = 4.6 × 10−7. For
B = 1 T, the angular frequency is ω0 = γn B0 ≃1.8 × 108 s−1, which gives
δω0/(2π) ≃13 Hz and b ≃2.4 m.
Actually, one can improve the accuracy considerably by analysing the
shape of the peak. In the experiment reported in the reference quoted be-
low, the length b is 2 m and the ﬁeld is B0 = 0.05 T (i.e. an angular frequency

Analysis of a Stern–Gerlach Experiment
We analyze a Stern–Gerlach experiment, both experimentally and from the
theoretical point of view. In the experimental setup considered here, a mono-
chromatic beam of neutrons crosses a region of strongly inhomogeneous mag-
netic ﬁeld, and one observes the outgoing beam.
5.1 Preparation of the Neutron Beam
Neutrons produced in a reactor are ﬁrst “cooled”, i.e. slowed down by cross-
ing liquid hydrogen at 20 K. They are incident on a monocrystal, for instance
graphite, from which they are diﬀracted. To each outgoing direction, there cor-
responds a well-deﬁned wavelength, and therefore a well-deﬁned momentum.
A beryllium crystal acts as a ﬁlter to eliminate harmonics, and the vertical ex-
tension of the beam is controlled by two gadolinium blocks, which are opaque
to neutrons, separated by a thin sheet of (transparent) aluminum of thickness
a, which constitutes the collimating slit, as shown in Fig. 5.1.

5.1.1. The de Broglie wavelength of these monochromatic neutrons is λ =
4.32 ˚A. What are their velocity and their kinetic energy?

5 Analysis of a Stern–Gerlach Experiment
5.1.2. One observes the impacts of the neutrons on a detector at a distance
L = 1 m from the slit. The vertical extension of the beam at the detector
is determined by two factors, ﬁrst the width a of the slit, and second the
diﬀraction of the neutron beam by the slit. We recall that the angular width θ
of the diﬀraction peak from a slit of width a is related to the wavelength λ by
sin θ = λ/a. For simplicity, we assume that the neutron beam is well collimated
before the slit, and that the vertical extension δ of the beam on the detector
is the sum of the width a of the slit and the width of the diﬀraction peak.
Show that one can choose a in an optimal way in order to make δ as small as
possible. What is the corresponding width of the beam on the detector?
5.1.3. In the actual experiment, the chosen value is a = 5 µm. What is the
observed width of the beam at the detector?
Comment on the respective eﬀects of the slit width a and of diﬀraction, on
the vertical shape of the observed beam on the detector?
The extension of the beam corresponds to the distribution of neutron im-
pacts along the z axis. Since the purpose of the experiment is not only to
observe the beam, but also to measure its “position” as deﬁned by the maxi-
mum of the distribution, what justiﬁcation can you ﬁnd for choosing a = 5 µm?
Figure 5.2 is an example of the neutron counting rate as a function of z.
The horizontal error bars, or bins, come from the resolution of the measur-
ing apparatus, the vertical error bars from the statistical ﬂuctuations of the
number of neutrons in each bin. The curve is a best ﬁt to the experimental
points. Its maximum is determined with an accuracy δz ∼5 µm.

5.2 Spin State of the Neutrons
In order to completely describe the state of a neutron, i.e. both its spin state
and its spatial state, we consider the eigenbasis of the spin projection along
the z axis, ˆSz, and we represent the neutron state as
|ψ(t)⟩
:

 ψ+(r, t)
ψ−(r, t)

,
where the respective probabilities of ﬁnding the neutron in the vicinity of
point r with its spin component Sz = ±¯h/2 are
d3P(r, Sz = ±¯h/2, t) = |ψ±(r, t)|2 d3r .
5.2.1. What are the probabilities P±(t) of ﬁnding, at time t, the values ±¯h/2
when measuring Sz irrespective of the position r?
5.2.2. What is, in terms of ψ+ and ψ−, the expectation value of the x com-
ponent of the neutron spin ⟨Sx⟩in the state |ψ(t)⟩?
5.2.3. What are the expectation values of the neutron’s position ⟨r⟩and
momentum ⟨p⟩in the state |ψ(t)⟩?
5.2.4. We assume that the state of the neutron can be written:
|ψ(t)⟩
:
ψ(r, t)

α+
α−

,
where the two complex numbers α± are such that |α+|2 + |α−|2 = 1. How do
the results of questions 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 simplify in that case?
5.3 The Stern–Gerlach Experiment
Between the slit, whose center is located at the origin (x = y = z = 0), and
the detector, located in the plane x = L, we place a magnet of length L whose
ﬁeld B is directed along the z axis. The magnetic ﬁeld varies strongly with z;
see Fig. 5.3.
We assume that the components of the magnetic ﬁeld are
Bx = By = 0
Bz = B0 + b′z .
In what follows we choose1 B0 = 1 T and b′ = 100 T/m.
1 This form violates Maxwell’s equation ∇· B = 0, but it simpliﬁes the following
calculation. With a little modiﬁcation (e.g. Bx = 0, By = −b′y and By ≪Bz over
the region of space crossed by the neutron beam), one can settle this matter, and
arrive at the same conclusions.

nuclear magneton µN = q¯h/2Mp = 5.051 10−27 J · T−1. Hereafter, we denote
the neutron mass by m.
5.3.1. What is the form of the Hamiltonian for a neutron moving in this
magnetic ﬁeld?
Write the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for the state |ψ(t)⟩.
Show that the Schr¨odinger equation decouples into two equations of the
Schr¨odinger type, for ψ+ and ψ−respectively.
5.3.2. Show that one has


|ψ±(r, t)|2 d3r = 0 .
What does one conclude as to the probabilities of measuring µz = ±µ0?
5.3.3. We assume that, at t = 0, at the entrance of the ﬁeld zone, one has
|ψ(0)⟩

α+
α−

and that ⟨r⟩= 0, ⟨py⟩= ⟨pz⟩= 0 and ⟨px⟩= p0 = h/λ, where the value of
the wavelength λ has been given above.
The above conditions correspond to the experimental preparation of the
neutron beam discussed in Sect. 5.1.
Let ˆA be an observable depending on the position operator ˆr and the
momentum operator ˆp. We deﬁne the numbers ⟨A+⟩and ⟨A−⟩by
⟨A±⟩=

What is the physical interpretation of ⟨A+⟩and ⟨A−⟩? Show in particular
that |ψ+|2/|α+|2 and |ψ−|2/|α−|2 are probability laws.
5.3.4. Apply Ehrenfest’s theorem to calculate the following quantities:
d
dt⟨r±⟩,
d
dt⟨p±⟩.
Solve the resulting equations and give the time evolution of ⟨r±⟩and ⟨p±⟩.
Give the physical interpretation of the result, and explain why one observes
a splitting of the initial beam into two beams of relative intensities |α+|2 and
|α−|2.
5.3.5. Calculate the splitting between the two beams when they leave the
magnet. Express the result in terms of the kinetic energy of the incident
neutrons (we recall that L = 1 m and b′ = 100 T/m).
Given the experimental error δz in the measurement of the position of the
maximum intensity of a beam, i.e. δz = 5 × 10−6 m as discussed in question
5.1.3, what is the accuracy on the measurement of the neutron magnetic mo-
ment in such an experiment, assuming that the determination of the magnetic
ﬁeld and the neutron energy is not a limitation? Compare with the result of
magnetic resonance experiments:
µ0 = (−1.91304184 ± 8.8 × 10−7) µN .
5.3.6. In the same experimental setup, what would be the splitting of a beam
of silver atoms (in the original experiment of Stern and Gerlach, the atomic
beam came from an oven at 1000 K) of energy E ≃1.38 × 10−20 J? The
magnetic moment of a silver atom is the same as that of the valence electron
|µe| = q¯h/2me ≃9.3 × 10−24 J.T−1.
5.3.7. Show that, quite generally, in order to be able to separate the two
outgoing beams, the condition to be satisﬁed is of the form
E⊥t ≥¯h/2 ,
where E⊥is the transverse kinetic energy acquired by the neutrons in the
process, and t is the time they spend in the magnetic ﬁeld. Comment and
conclude.
5.4 Solutions
Section 5.1:
Preparation of the Neutron Beam
5.1.1. We have v = h/(λm) and E = mv2/2, which yields v = 916 m s−1
and E = 0.438 × 10−2 eV.

5 Analysis of a Stern–Gerlach Experiment
5.1.2. The contribution of diﬀraction to the beam width is δdiﬀ= L tan θ ∼
Lλ/a. With the simple additive prescription (which can be improved, but
this would not yield very diﬀerent results), we obtain δ = a + Lλ/a which is
minimal for a =
√
Lλ ≃21 µm. The spreading of the beam on the detector is
then equal to the Heisenberg minimum δ = 2
√
Lλ = 42 µm.
The uncertainty relations forbid δ to be less than some lower limit. In other
words, the spreading of the wave packet, which increases as a decreases com-
petes with the spatial deﬁnition of the incoming beam.
5.1.3. For a = 5 µm, we have δ = 91.5 µm.
In that case, the eﬀect of diﬀraction is predominant. The reason for making
this choice is that the shape of the diﬀraction peak is known and can be ﬁtted
quite nicely. Therefore, this is an advantage in determining the position of
the maximum. However, one cannot choose a to be too small, otherwise the
neutron ﬂux becomes too small, and the number of events is insuﬃcient.

d3r = 1 .
The quantity |ψ+(r, t)|2 + |ψ−(r, t)|2 is the probability density of ﬁnding the
neutron at point r.
5.2.2. By deﬁnition, the expectation value of Sx is ⟨Sx⟩= (¯h/2)⟨ψ|ˆσx|ψ⟩

or, equivalently i¯h d

ˆH± = −¯h2
2m∆∓µ0(B0 −b′z) .
In other words, we are dealing with two uncoupled Schr¨odinger equations,
where the potentials have opposite values. This is basically what causes the
Stern–Gerlach splitting.
5.3.2. Since both ψ+ and ψ−satisfy Schr¨odinger equations, and since ˆH±
are both hermitian, we have the usual properties of Hamiltonian evolution
for ψ+ and ψ−separately, in particular the conservation of the norm. The
probability of ﬁnding µz = ±µ0, and the expectation value of µz are both
time independent.
5.3.3. By deﬁnition, we have

|ψ±(r, t)|2 d3r = |α±|2 ,
where |α±|2 is time independent. The quantities |ψ+(r, t)|2/|α+|2 and
|ψ−(r, t)|2/|α−|2 are the probability densities for ﬁnding a neutron at po-
sition r with, respectively, Sz = +¯h/2 and Sz = −¯h/2.
The quantities ⟨A+⟩and ⟨A−⟩are the expectation values of the physical
quantity A, for neutrons which have, respectively, Sz = +¯h/2 and Sz = −¯h/2.
5.3.4. Applying Ehrenfest’s theorem, one has for any observable
d

Therefore
d
dt⟨r±⟩= ⟨p±⟩/m
and
d
dt⟨px±⟩= d
dt⟨py±⟩= 0
d
dt⟨pz±⟩= ±µ0 b′ .
The solution of these equations is straightforward:
⟨px±⟩= p0 ,
⟨py±⟩= 0 ,
⟨pz±⟩= ±µ0b′t
⟨x±⟩= p0 t
m = vt ,
⟨y±⟩= 0 ,
⟨z±⟩= ±µ0b′t2
2m
.
Consequently, the expectation values of the vertical positions of the neutrons
which have µz = +µ0 and µz = −µ0 diverge as time progresses: there is a
separation in space of the support of the two wave functions ψ+ and ψ−. The
intensities of the two outgoing beams are proportional to |α+|2 and |α−|2.
5.3.5. As the neutrons leave the magnet, one has ⟨x⟩= L, therefore t = L/v
and ∆z = |µ0b′|L2/mv2 = |µ0b′|L2/2E where E is the energy of the incident
neutrons.
This provides a splitting of ∆z = 0.69 mm. The error on the position of
each beam is δz = 5 µm, that is to say a relative error on the splitting of the
beams, or equivalently, on the measurement of µ0
δµ0

∼1.5% ,
which is far from the accuracy of magnetic resonance measurements.
5.3.6. For silver atoms, one has |µ0|/2E = 3.4 × 10−4 T−1. Hence, in the
same conﬁguration, one would obtain, for the same value of the ﬁeld gradient
and the same length L = 1 m, a separation ∆z = 3.4 cm, much larger than for
neutrons. Actually, Stern and Gerlach, in their ﬁrst experiment, had a much
weaker ﬁeld gradient and their magnet was 20 cm long.
5.3.7. The condition to be satisﬁed in order to resolve the two outgoing
beams is that the distance ∆z between the peaks should be larger than the
full width of each peak (this is a common criterion in optics; by an appro-
priate inspection of the line shape, one may lower this limit). We have seen
in Sect. 5.1 that the absolute minimum for the total beam extension on the
detector is 2
√
Lλ, which amounts to a full width at half-maximum
√
Lλ. In
other words, we must have:
∆z2 ≥L λ .
In the previous section, we have obtained the value of ∆z, and, by squaring, we
obtain ∆z2 = (µ0b′)2t4/m2, where t is the time spent traversing the magnet.
On the other hand, the transverse kinetic energy of an outgoing neutron is
E⊥= p2
z±/(2m) = (µ0b′)2t2/(2m).

5.4 Solutions
63
Putting the two previous relations together, we obtain ∆z2 = 2E⊥t2/m; in-
serting this result in the ﬁrst inequality, we obtain
E⊥t ≥h/2 ,
where we have used L = vt and λ = h/mv. This is nothing but one of the
many forms of the time–energy uncertainty relation. The right-hand side is
not the standard ¯h/2 because we have considered a rectangular shape of the
incident beam (and not a Gaussian). This brings in an extra factor of 2π.
Physically, this result is interesting in many respects.
(a) First, it shows that the eﬀort that counts in making the experiment
feasible is not to improve individually the magnitude of the ﬁeld gradient,
or the length of the apparatus, etc., but the particular combination of the
product of the energy transferred to the system and the interaction time of
the system with the measuring apparatus.
(b) Secondly, this is a particular example of the fundamental fact stressed by
many authors2 that a measurement is never point-like. It has always a ﬁnite
extension both in space and in time. The Stern–Gerlach experiment is actually
a very good example of a measuring apparatus in quantum mechanics since
it transfers quantum information – here the spin state of the neutron – into
space–time accessible quantities – here the splitting of the outgoing beams.
(c) This time–energy uncertainty relation is encountered in most, if not all
quantum measurements. Here it emerges as a consequence of the spreading of
the wave packet. It is a simple and fruitful exercise to demonstrate rigorously
the above property by calculating directly the time evolution of the following
expectation values:

∆z2 = ⟨z2

Measuring the Electron Magnetic
Moment Anomaly
In the framework of the Dirac equation, the gyromagnetic factor g of the
electron is equal to 2. In other words, the ratio between the magnetic moment
and the spin of the electron is gq/(2m) = q/m, where q and m are the charge
and the mass of the particle. When one takes into account the interaction
of the electron with the quantized electromagnetic ﬁeld, one predicts a value
of g slightly diﬀerent from 2. The purpose of this chapter is to study the
measurement of the quantity g −2.
6.1 Spin and Momentum Precession of an Electron
in a Magnetic Field
Consider an electron, of mass m and charge q (q < 0), placed in a uniform
and static magnetic ﬁeld B directed along the z axis. The Hamiltonian of the
electron is
ˆH =
1
2m(ˆp −q ˆA)
2 −ˆµ · B,
where ˆA is the vector potential ˆA = B × ˆr/2 and ˆµ is the intrinsic magnetic
moment operator of the electron. This magnetic moment is related to the
spin operator ˆS by ˆµ = γ ˆS, with γ = (1 + a)q/m. The quantity a is called
the magnetic moment “anomaly”. In the framework of the Dirac equation,
a = 0. Using quantum electrodynamics, one predicts at ﬁrst order in the ﬁne
structure constant a = α/(2π).
The velocity operator is ˆv = (ˆp −q ˆA)/m, and we set ω = qB/m.
6.1.1. Verify the following commutation relations:
[ˆvx, ˆH] = i¯hω ˆvy ;
[ˆvy, ˆH] = −i¯hω ˆvx ;
[ˆvz, ˆH] = 0 .
6.1.2. Consider the three quantities
C1(t) = ⟨ˆSzˆvz⟩,
C2(t) = ⟨ˆSxˆvx + ˆSyˆvy⟩,
C3(t) = ⟨ˆSxˆvy −ˆSyˆvx⟩.

66
6 Measuring the Electron Magnetic Moment Anomaly
Write the time evolution equations for C1, C2, C3. Show that these three equa-
tions form a linear diﬀerential system with constant coeﬃcients. One will make
use of the quantity Ω= a ω.
6.1.3. What is the general form for the evolution of ⟨ˆS · ˆv⟩?
6.1.4. A beam of electrons of velocity v is prepared at time t = 0 in a
spin state such that one knows the values of C1(0), C2(0), and C3(0). The
beam interacts with the magnetic ﬁeld B during the time interval [0, T]. One
neglects the interactions between the electrons of the beam. At time T, one
measures a quantity which is proportional to ⟨ˆS.ˆv⟩.
The result of such a measurement is presented in Fig. 6.1 as a function of
the time T, for a value of the magnetic ﬁeld B = 9.4 × 10−3 T (data taken
from D.T. Wilkinson and H.R. Crane, Phys. Rev. 130, 852 (1963)). Deduce
from this curve an approximate value for the anomaly a.
6.1.5. Does the experimental value agree with the prediction of quantum
electrodynamics?
Fig. 6.1. Variations of the quantity ⟨ˆS.ˆv⟩, as a function of the time T
6.2 Solutions
6.1.1. The electron Hamiltonian is ˆH = mˆv2/2 −γB ˆSz. The following com-
mutation relations can be established with no diﬃculty
[ˆvx, ˆvy] = i¯hqB/m2 = i¯hω/m,
[ˆvx, ˆvz] = [ˆvy, ˆvz] = 0 ,
[ˆvx, ˆv2
y] = [ˆvx, ˆvy]ˆvy + ˆvy[ˆvx, ˆvy] = 2i¯hω ˆvy/m .
Therefore
[ˆvx, ˆH] = i¯hωˆvy ;
[ˆvy, ˆH] = −i¯hωˆvx ;
[ˆvz, ˆH] = 0 .

6.2 Solutions
67
6.1.2. We make use of the property i¯h(d/dt)⟨ˆO⟩= ⟨[ ˆO, ˆH]⟩, valid for any
observable (Ehrenfest theorem). The time evolution of C1 is trivial:
[ ˆSzˆvz, ˆH] = 0 ⇒
dC1
dt = 0 ;
C1(t) = A1 ,
where A1 is a constant. For C2 and C3, we proceed in the following way:
[ ˆSxˆvx, ˆH] = [ ˆSxˆvx, mˆv2/2] −γB[ ˆSxˆvx, ˆSz] = i¯hω( ˆSxˆvy + (1 + a) ˆSyˆvx).
Similarly,
[ ˆSyˆvy, ˆH] = −i¯hω( ˆSyˆvx + (1 + a) ˆSxˆvy)
[ ˆSxˆvy, ˆH] = −i¯hω( ˆSxˆvx −(1 + a) ˆSyˆvy)
[ ˆSyˆvx, ˆH] = i¯hω( ˆSyˆvy −(1 + a) ˆSxˆvx) .
Therefore,
[ ˆSxˆvx + ˆSyˆvy, ˆH] = −i¯hωa ( ˆSxˆvy −ˆSyˆvx)
[ ˆSxˆvy −ˆSyˆvx, ˆH] = i¯hωa( ˆSxˆvx + ˆSyˆvy)
and
dC2
dt = −ΩC3 ,
dC3
dt = ΩC2.
6.1.3. We therefore obtain d2C2/dt2 = −Ω2C2, whose solution is
C2(t) = A2 cos (Ωt + ϕ) ,
where A2 and ϕ are constant. Hence, the general form of the evolution of
⟨S · v⟩is
⟨S · v⟩(t) = C1(t) + C2(t) = A1 + A2 cos (Ωt + ϕ) .
In other words, in the absence of anomaly, the spin and the momentum of the
electron would precess with the same angular velocity: the cyclotron frequency
(precession of momentum) and the Larmor frequency (precession of magnetic
moment) would be equal. Measuring the diﬀerence in these two frequencies
gives a direct measurement of the anomaly a, of fundamental importance in
quantum electrodynamics.
6.1.4. One calculates the anomaly from the relation a = Ω/ω. The ex-
perimental results for ⟨S · v⟩show a periodic behavior in time with a pe-
riod τ ∼3 µs, i.e. Ω= 2π/τ ∼2 × 106 s−1. In a ﬁeld B = 0.0094 T,
ω = 1.65 × 109 s−1, and a = Ω/ω ∼1.2 × 10−3.
6.1.5. This value is in good agreement with the theoretical prediction a =
α/2π = 1.16 × 10−3.

Remark: The value of the anomaly is now known with an impressive accu-
racy:
atheo. = 0.001 159 652 200 (40)
aexp. = 0.001 159 652 193 (10) .
The theoretical calculation includes all corrections up to order 3 in α.

Decay of a Tritium Atom
The nucleus of the tritium atom is the isotope 3H, of charge Z = 1. This
nucleus is radioactive and transforms into a 3He nucleus by β decay. The
purpose of this chapter is to study the electronic state of the 3He+ ion formed
after the decay.
We consider nuclei as inﬁnitely massive compared to the electron, of
mass m. We write a1 = ¯h2/(me2) for the Bohr radius and EI = mc2α2/2 ≃
13.6 eV for the ionization energy of the hydrogen atom, where α is the ﬁne
structure constant [e2 = q2/(4πϵ0), where q is the electron charge].
In the ground state |ψ0⟩of the tritium atom, the wave function of the
electron (n = 1, l = 0, m = 0) is the same as in the normal hydrogen atom:
ψ0(r) =
1
√πa13 e−r/a1 .
(7.1)
The β decay of the tritium nucleus leads to:
3H →3He + e−+ ¯ν
(7.2)
(¯ν is an antineutrino), where the emitted electron has an energy of the order
of 15 keV and the helium nucleus 3He has charge Z = 2. The decay is an
instantaneous process; the β electron is emitted with a large velocity and
leaves the atomic system very rapidly. Consequently, an ionized 3He+ atom
is formed, for which, at the time t0 of the decay, the wave function of the
electron is practically the same as in tritium, and we shall assume it is still
given by (7.1). We denote by |n, l, m⟩the states of the ionized helium atom
which is a hydrogen-like system, i.e. one electron placed in the Coulomb ﬁeld
of a nucleus of charge 2.
7.1 The Energy Balance in Tritium Decay
7.1.1. Write the Hamiltonian ˆH1 of the atomic electron before the decay and
the Hamiltonian ˆH2 of this electron after the decay (when the potential term
has suddenly changed).

7.1.2. What are, in terms of EI, the energy levels of the 3He+ atom? Give
its Bohr radius and its ground state wave function ϕ100(r).
7.1.3. Calculate the expectation value ⟨E⟩of the energy of the electron after
the decay. One can for instance make use of the fact that:
⟨ψ0| 1
r |ψ0⟩= 1

and
ˆH2 = ˆH1 −e2
r .
Give the value of ⟨E⟩in eV.
7.1.4. Express in terms of |ψ0⟩and |n, l, m⟩the probability amplitude
c(n, l, m) and the probability p(n, l, m) of ﬁnding the electron in the state
|n, l, m⟩of 3He+ after the decay. Show that only the probabilities pn =
p (n, 0, 0) do not vanish.
7.1.5. Calculate the probability p1 of ﬁnding the electron in the ground state
of 3He+. What is the corresponding contribution to ⟨E⟩?

Calculate the probability ∞
n=1 pn of ﬁnding the atomic electron in a bound
state of 3He+ and the corresponding contribution to ⟨E⟩. Comment on the
result.
7.1.7. Experimentally, in the β decay of the tritium atom, one observes that,
in about 3% of the events, there are two outgoing electrons, one with a mean
kinetic energy ⟨Ek⟩∼15 keV, the other with ⟨Ek⟩∼34.3 eV, thus leaving
a completely ionized 3He2+ nucleus, as if the β decay electron had “ejected”
the atomic electron. Explain this phenomenon.

7.1.2. The energy levels corresponding to the bound states of a hydrogen-
like atom of nuclear charge Z are En = −Z2EI/n2. In the present case,

is

7.1.3. The expectation value of the electron energy in the new nuclear con-
ﬁguration is
⟨E⟩= ⟨ψ0| ˆH2|ψ0⟩= ⟨ψ0| ˆH1|ψ0⟩−⟨ψ0| e2
r |ψ0⟩,
which amounts to
⟨E⟩= −EI −e2
a1
= −3EI ≃−40.8 eV .
7.1.4. By deﬁnition, the probability amplitude is c(n, l, m) = ⟨n, l, m|ψ0⟩,
and the probability p(n, l, m) = |⟨n, l, m|ψ0⟩|2. The analytic form is
c(n, l, m) =

Rnl(r) (Yl,m(θ, φ))∗ψ0(r) d3r ,
where Rnl(r) are the radial wave functions of the 3He+ hydrogen-like atom.
Since ψ0 is of the form ψ0(r) = χ(r)Y0,0(θ, φ), the orthogonality of spherical
harmonics implies p(n, l, m) = 0 if (l, m) ̸= (0, 0).
7.1.5. The probability amplitude in the lowest energy state is

Hence the probability p1 = 0.70233 and the contribution to the energy p1E1 =

7.1.6. With the numerical values given in the text, one has p2E2 = −EI/4 =
−3.4 eV, and p = ∞
1 pn = 0.9737 . The contribution to ⟨E⟩is ⟨EB⟩=
∞
1 pnEn = −3.0664 EI = −41.7 eV.
The total probability is smaller than 1; there exists a non-zero probability
(1 −p) = 0.026 that the atomic electron is not bound in the ﬁnal state.
The contribution of bound states ⟨EB⟩= −41.7 eV is smaller than the
total expectation value of the energy ⟨E⟩by 0.9 eV. The probability (1 −p)
corresponds therefore to a positive electron energy, i.e. an ionization of 3He+
into 3He2+ with emission of the atomic electron.
7.1.7. There is necessarily a probability 1−p = 0.026 for the atomic electron
not to be bound around the helium nucleus, therefore that the helium atom
be completely ionized in the decay. If the mean kinetic energy of the expelled
electron is Ek ∼34.3 eV, this represents a contribution of the order of (1 −
p)Ek ∼+0.89 eV to the mean energy which compensates the apparent energy
deﬁcit noted above.

This type of reaction is currently being studied in order to determine the

of the β electron, E the energy of the atomic electron, and E¯ν the neutrino
energy, energy conservation gives for each event: M1c2 −EI = M2c2 + Eβ +
E¯ν + E. For a given value of E, the determination of the maximum energy
of the β electron (which covers all the spectrum up to 19 keV in the tritium
atom case) provides a method for determining the minimum value m¯νc2 of E¯ν
through this energy balance. An important theoretical problem is that current
experiments are performed on molecular tritium (HT or TT molecules) and
that molecular wave functions are not known explicitly, contrary to the atomic
case considered here. The most precise experiment up to date is reported in
Weinheimer et al., Phys. Lett. B460, 219, (1999).

The Spectrum of Positronium
The positron e+ is the antiparticle of the electron. It is a spin-1/2 particle,
which has the same mass m as the electron, but an electric charge of opposite
sign. In this chapter we consider the system called positronium which is an
atom consisting of an e+e−pair.
8.1 Positronium Orbital States
We ﬁrst consider only the spatial properties of the system, neglecting all spin
eﬀects. We only retain the Coulomb interaction between the two particles. No
proof is required, an appropriate transcription of the hydrogen atom results
suﬃces.
8.1.1. Express the reduced mass of the system µ, in terms of the electron
mass m.
8.1.2. Write the Hamiltonian of the relative motion of the two particles in
terms of their separation r and their relative momentum p.
8.1.3. What are the energy levels of the system, and their degeneracies? How
do they compare with those of hydrogen?
8.1.4. What is the Bohr radius a0 of the system? How do the sizes of hydrogen
and positronium compare?
8.1.5. Give the expression for the normalized ground state wave function
ψ100(r). Express |ψ100(0)|2 in terms of the fundamental constants: m, c, ¯h,
and the ﬁne structure constant α.
8.2 Hyperﬁne Splitting
We now study the hyperﬁne splitting of the ground state.

74
8 The Spectrum of Positronium
8.2.1. What is the degeneracy of the orbital ground state if one takes into
account spin variables (in the absence of a spin–spin interaction)?
8.2.2. Explain why the (spin) gyromagnetic ratios of the positron and of the
electron have opposite signs: γ1 = −γ2 = γ. Express γ in terms of q and m.
8.2.3. One assumes that, as in hydrogen, the spin–spin Hamiltonian in the
orbital ground state is:
ˆHSS = A
¯h2 ˆS1 · ˆS2 ,
(8.1)
where the constant A has the dimension of an energy.
Recall the eigenstates and eigenvalues of ˆHSS in the spin basis {|σ1, σ2⟩},
where σ1 = ±1, σ2 = ±1.
8.2.4. As in hydrogen, the constant A originates from a contact term:
A = −2

ϵ0c2 γ1 γ2 ¯h2 |ψ100(0)|2.
(8.2)
(a) The observed hyperﬁne line of positronium has a frequency ν ≃200 GHz,
compared to ν ≃1.4 GHz for hydrogen. Justify this diﬀerence of two
orders of magnitude.
(b) Express the constant A in terms of the ﬁne structure constant and the
energy mc2. Give the numerical value of A in eV.
(c) What frequency of the hyperﬁne transition corresponds to this calculated
value of A?
8.2.5. Actually, the possibility that the electron and the positron can annihi-
late, leads to an additional contribution ˆHA in the hyperﬁne Hamiltonian. One
can show that ˆHA does not aﬀect states of total spin equal to zero (S = 0), and
that it increases systematically the energies of S = 1 states by the amount:
ˆHA :
δES=1 = 3A
4
(δES=0 = 0) ,
(8.3)
where A is the same constant as in (8.2).
(a) What are the energies of the S = 1 and S = 0 states, if one takes into
account the above annihilation term?
(b) Calculate the frequency of the corresponding hyperﬁne transition.
8.3 Zeeman Eﬀect in the Ground State
The system is placed in a constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld B directed along
the z axis. The additional Zeeman Hamiltonian has the form
ˆHZ = ω1 ˆS1z + ω2 ˆS2z ,
where ω1 = −γ1B and ω2 = −γ2B.

8.4 Decay of Positronium
75
8.3.1.
(a) Taking into account the result of question 2.2 and setting ω =
−γB, write the action of ˆHZ on the basis states {|σ1, σ2⟩}.
(b) Write in terms of A and ¯hω the matrix representation of
ˆH = ˆHSS + ˆHA + ˆHZ
(8.4)
in the basis {|S, m⟩} of the total spin of the two particles.
(c) Give the numerical value of ¯hω in eV for a ﬁeld B = 1 T. Is it easy
experimentally to be in a strong ﬁeld regime, i.e. ¯hω ≫A?
8.3.2. Calculate the energy eigenvalues in the presence of the ﬁeld B; express
the corresponding eigenstates in the basis {|S, m⟩} of the total spin. The
largest eigenvalue will be written E+ and the corresponding eigenstate |ψ+⟩.
For convenience, one can introduce the quantity x = 8¯hω/(7A), and the angle
θ deﬁned by sin 2θ = x/
√
1 + x2, cos 2θ = 1/
√
1 + x2.
8.3.3. Draw qualitatively the variations of the energy levels in terms of B.
Are there any remaining degeneracies?
8.4 Decay of Positronium
We recall that when a system A is unstable and decays: A →B + · · · , the
probability for this system to decay during the interval [t, t+dt] if it is prepared
at t = 0, is dp = λe−λtdt, where the decay rate λ is related to the lifetime
τ of the system by τ = 1/λ. If the decay can proceed via diﬀerent channels,
e.g. A →B + · · · and A →C + · · · , with respective decay rates λ1 and λ2,
the total decay rate is the sum of the partial rates, and the lifetime of A is
τ = 1/(λ1 + λ2).
In all what follows, we place ourselves in the rest frame of the positronium.
8.4.1. In a two-photon decay, or annihilation, of positronium, what are the
energies of the two outgoing photons, and what are their relative directions?
8.4.2. One can show that the annihilation rate of positronium into photons
in an orbital state |n, l, m⟩is proportional to the probability for the electron
and positron to be at the same point, i.e. to |ψnlm(0)|2. In what orbital states
is the annihilation possible?
8.4.3. In quantum ﬁeld theory, one can show that, owing to charge conjuga-
tion invariance,
(a) a singlet state, S = 0, can only decay into an even number of photons:
2, 4, · · ·
(b) a triplet state, S = 1, can only decay into an odd number of photons:
3, 5, · · ·
In the orbital ground state ψ100, split by spin–spin interactions as calculated
in Sect. 2, the lifetime of the singlet state is τ2 ∼1.25 × 10−10 s, and the

76
8 The Spectrum of Positronium
lifetime of either of the three triplet states is τ3 ∼1.4×10−7 s. Quantum ﬁeld
theory predicts:

9π (π2 −9) α λ2 .
Compare theory and experiment.
8.4.4. In order to determine the hyperﬁne constant A of positronium, it is
of interest to study the energy and the lifetime of the level corresponding to
the state |ψ+⟩, deﬁned in question 3.2, as a function of the ﬁeld B.
¿From now on, we assume that the ﬁeld is weak, i.e. |x| = |8¯hω/(7A)| ≪1,
and we shall make the corresponding approximations.
(a) What are, as a function of x, the probabilities pS ans pT of ﬁnding the
state |ψ+⟩in the singlet and triplet states respectively?
(b) Use the result to calculate the decay rates λ+
2 and λ+
3 of the state |ψ+⟩
into two and three photons respectively, in terms of the parameter x, and
of the rates λ2 and λ3 introduced in question 4.4.
(c) What is the lifetime τ +(B) of the state |ψ+⟩? Explain qualitatively its
dependence on the applied ﬁeld B, and calculate τ +(B) for B = 0.4 T.
1. One measures, as a function of B, the ratio R = τ +(B)/τ +(0) of the life-
time of the |ψ+⟩state with and without a magnetic ﬁeld. The dependence
on B of R is given in Fig. 8.1, with the corresponding error bars.
(i) What estimate does one obtain for the hyperﬁne constant, A, using
the value of the magnetic ﬁeld for which the ratio R has decreased by
a factor two?
(ii) How do theory and experiment compare?

Section 8.1:
Positronium Orbital States
In positronium, we have, by scaling:
8.1.1. A reduced mass µ = m/2.
8.1.2. A center of mass Hamiltonian ˆH = ˆp2/2µ −q2/4πϵ0r.
8.1.3. The energy levels En = −(1/2)µc2α2/n2 = −(1/4)mc2α2/n2. The
degeneracy is n2 for each level, as in the hydrogen atom; the bound state
energies are half of those of hydrogen.
8.1.4. The Bohr radius is a0 = ¯h/(µcα) = 2¯h/(mcα) = 2aH
0 ∼1.06 ˚A. The
diameter of positronium is ⟨r⟩= 3a0/2 = 3aH
0 , and, since the proton is ﬁxed,
the diameter of the hydrogen is 2⟨r⟩H = 3aH
0 . Therefore the two systems have
the same size.
8.1.5. The ground state wave function is ψ100(r) = e−r/a0/

have |ψ100(0)|2 = (mcα/(2¯h))3/π.
Section 8.2:
Hyperﬁne Splitting
8.2.1. In the orbital ground state, the degeneracy is 4, corresponding to the
number of independent spin states.
8.2.2. Since the masses are equal, but the charges are opposite, we have
γ1 = q/m,
γ2 = −q/m,
γ = q/m.
8.2.3. As usual, we can express the spin–spin operator in terms of the total
spin S as S1 · S2 = [S2 −S2
1 −S2
2]/2. Hence, the orbital ground state is split
into:
(a) the triplet states: | + +⟩, (| + −⟩+ | −+⟩)/
√
2, | −−⟩, with the energy
shift:
ET = A/4 ,
(b) the singlet state: (| + −⟩−| −+⟩)/

ES = −3A/4 .
8.2.4.
(a) There is a mass factor of ∼1/2000, a factor of ∼2.8 for the
gyromagnetic ratio of the proton, and a factor of 8 due to the value of the wave
function at the origin. Altogether, this results in a factor of ∼22/2000 ∼1%
for the ratio of hyperﬁne splittings H/(e+e−).

prediction is not in agreement with the experimental result (∼200 GHz).
8.2.5.
(a) Taking into account ˆHA, the triplet state energy is A while the
singlet state energy is −3A/4. The splitting is δE = 7A/4 = 8.47 × 10−4 eV.
(b) The corresponding frequency is ν = δE/h ∼205 GHz, in agreement with
experiment.
Section 8.3:
Zeeman Eﬀect in the Ground State
8.3.1.
(a) The Zeeman Hamiltonian is ˆHZ = ω( ˆS1z −ˆS2z), therefore, we have
ˆHZ| + +⟩= ˆHZ| −−⟩= 0
ˆHZ| + −⟩= ¯hω| + −⟩
ˆHZ| −+⟩= −¯hω| −+⟩.
In terms of total spin states, this results in
ˆHZ|1, 1⟩= ˆHZ|1, −1⟩= 0
ˆHZ|1, 0⟩= ¯hω|0, 0⟩
ˆHZ|0, 0⟩= ¯hω|1, 0⟩.
(b) Hence the matrix representation in the coupled basis:
ˆHZ =

where the elements are ordered according to: |1, 1⟩, |1, −1⟩, |1, 0⟩, |0, 0⟩.

In a ﬁeld of 1 T, |¯hω| = q¯hB/m = 2µBB ≃1.16 × 10−4 eV. The strong ﬁeld
regime corresponds to |¯hω| ≫A , i.e. B ≫4 T, which is diﬃcult to reach.

Section 8.4:
Decay of Positronium
8.4.1. In a two-photon decay, the outgoing photons have opposite momenta,
their energies are both mc2 = 511 keV.
8.4.2. The wave function vanishes at the origin, except for s-waves
(|ψnlm(0)|2 = 0 if l ̸= 0), owing to the centrifugal barrier. Therefore the
decay can only occur when the positronium is in an s-state.
8.4.3. The given formulas correspond to λ2 = mc2α5/(2¯h) which yields τ2 =
1.24 × 10−10 s and τ3 = 1.38 × 10−7 s, in agreement with experiment.

8 The Spectrum of Positronium
8.4.4.
(a) For a given value of the applied ﬁeld, with the positronium pre-
pared in the state |ψ+⟩, the probabilities of ﬁnding the system in the singlet
and triplet states are respectively pS = sin2 θ ∼x2/4 and pT = cos2 θ ∼
1 −x2/4.
(b) The rate for |ψ+⟩to decay into two photons is the product of the prob-
ability of ﬁnding |ψ+⟩in the singlet state with the singlet state decay rate:
λ+
2 = pSλ2 ∼x2λ2/4 = x2/(4τ2) .
Similarly, one has
λ+
3 = pTλ3 ∼(1 −x2/4)λ3 = (1 −x2/4)/τ3 .

As the ﬁeld B increases, the state |ψ+⟩, which is purely triplet for B = 0,
acquires a greater and greater singlet component. Therefore its lifetime de-
creases as B increases. For B = 0.4 T, one has τ+ = 0.23 τ3 = 3.2 × 10−8 s.
(d) Experimentally, one has R ∼0.5, i.e.
x2τ3/4τ2 ≃1 for B ∼0.22 T.
Therefore x ≃6 × 10−2 and, since A = 8¯hω/7x and ¯hω = 2.3 × 10−5 eV, the
result is A ∼4.4 × 10−4 eV, in good agreement with theoretical expectations.

The Hydrogen Atom in Crossed Fields
We study the modiﬁcation of the energy spectrum of a hydrogen atom placed
in crossed static electric and magnetic ﬁelds in perturbation theory. We thus
recover a result ﬁrst derived by Pauli.
In his famous 1925 paper on the hydrogen atom, W. Pauli made use of the
particular symmetry of the Coulomb problem. In addition to the hydrogen
spectrum, he was able to calculate the splitting of the levels in an electric
ﬁeld (Stark eﬀect) or in a magnetic ﬁeld (Zeeman eﬀect). Pauli also noticed
that he could obtain a simple and compact formula for the level splitting
in a superposition of a magnetic ﬁeld B0 and an electric ﬁeld E0 both sta-
tic and uniform, and perpendicular to each other. In this case, he found that a
level with principal quantum number n is split into 2n −1 sublevels
En + δE(k)
n
with
δE(k)
n
= ¯hk (ω2
0 + ω2
e)1/2 ,
(9.1)
where k is an integer ranging from −(n−1) to n−1, ω0 and ωe are respectively
proportional to B0 and E0, and ωe can be written as
ωe = 3
2 Ωef(n)
with
Ωe = 4πϵ0¯h
Mqe
E0 ,
where M and qe are the mass and charge of the electron, and where f(n)
depends on n only.
It is only in 1983 that Pauli’s result was veriﬁed experimentally. Our pur-
pose, here, is to prove (9.1) in the special case n = 2, to calculate ω0 and ωe
in that case, and, by examining the experimental result for n = 34, to guess
what was the very simple formula found by Pauli for f(n).

9.1 The Hydrogen Atom in Crossed Electric
and Magnetic Fields
We consider the n = 2 level of the hydrogen atom. We neglect all spin eﬀects.
We assume that B0 is along the z axis and E0 along the x axis. We use ﬁrst
order perturbation theory.
9.1.1. What are the energy levels and the corresponding eigenstates in the
presence of B0 only? Check that (9.1) is valid in this case and give the value
of ω0?
9.1.2. In the presence of E0 only, the perturbing Hamiltonian is the electric
dipole term ˆHE = −ˆD.E0 = −qeˆr.E0. Write the matrix representing ˆHE in
the n = 2 subspace under consideration.
We recall that:

where a1 = ¯h2/(Me2) is the Bohr radius (e2 = q2
e/4πϵ0).

9.1.3. Calculate the energies of the levels originating from the n = 2 level in
the presence of the crossed ﬁelds E0 and B0. Show that one recovers (9.1)
with ωe = (3/2)f(2)Ωe, and give the value of f(2).
9.2 Pauli’s Result
The ﬁrst experimental veriﬁcation of Pauli’s result was performed in 1983.1
In Fig. 9.1, the points correspond to a sub-level with a given value of k arising
from the n = 34 level of an hydrogen-like atom. All points correspond to the
same energy of this level, but to diﬀerent values of the static ﬁelds E0 and
B0.
Knowing that ωe is a function of the principal quantum number n of the
form: ωe = (3/2)f(n)Ωe, and that ω0 and Ωe are the constants introduced
above, answer the following questions:
1 Fig. 9.1 was obtained by F. Biraben, D. Delande, J.-C. Gay, and F. Penent, with
rubidium atoms prepared in a Rydberg state, i.e. with an electron placed in a
strongly excited level (see J.-C. Gay, in Atoms in unusual situations, J.-P. Briand
ed., p. 107, Plenum, New York, 1986).

9.1.1. Consider a state |n, l, m⟩. The orbital magnetic moment of the elec-
tron is ˆµorb = γ0 ˆL, with γ0 = qe/(2M). The magnetic Hamiltonian is
ˆH = −ˆµorb.B = −(qe/2M)ˆLzB0.
At ﬁrst order perturbation theory, the energy levels originating from the n = 2
subspace (angular momentum l = 0 or l = 1) are m¯hω0 with m = −1, 0, +1,
and ω0 = −qeB0/(2M) (ω0 > 0 for B0 > 0). The corresponding states are
|2s⟩and |2p, m = 0⟩

δE = +¯hω0 .
9.1.2. The Hamiltonian is ˆHE = −qe ˆx E0. We have to calculate the 16 matrix

Energy Loss of Ions in Matter
When a charged particle travels through condensed matter, it loses its kinetic
energy gradually by transferring it to the electrons of the medium. In this
chapter we evaluate the energy loss of the particle as a function of its mass and
its charge, by studying the modiﬁcations that the state of an atom undergoes
when a charged particle passes in its vicinity. We show how this process can
be used to identify the products of a nuclear reaction.
The electric potential created by the moving particle appears as a time-
dependent perturbation in the atom’s Hamiltonian. In order to simplify the
problem, we shall consider the case of an atom with a single external electron.
The nucleus and the internal electrons will be treated globally as a core of
charge +q, inﬁnitely massive and, therefore, ﬁxed in space. We also assume
that the incident particle of charge Z1q is heavy and non-relativistic, and that
its kinetic energy is large enough so that in good approximation its motion
can be considered linear and uniform, of constant velocity v, when it interacts
with an atom.
Here q denotes the unit charge and we set e2 = q2/(4πε0). We consider the
x, y plane deﬁned by the trajectory of the particle and the center of gravity
of the atom, which is chosen to be the origin, as shown on Fig. 10.1.
Let R(t) be the position of the particle at time t and r = (x, y, z) the
coordinates of the electron of the atom. The impact parameter is b and the
notation is speciﬁed in Fig. 10.1. The time at which the particle passes nearest
to the atom, i.e. x = b, y = 0 is denoted t = 0. We write En and |n⟩for the
energy levels and corresponding eigenstates of the atom in the absence of an
external perturbation.
10.1 Energy Absorbed by One Atom
10.1.1. Write the expression for the time-dependent perturbing potential
ˆV (t) due to the presence of the charged particle.

88
10 Energy Loss of Ions in Matter
10.1.2. We assume that the impact parameter b is much larger than the
typical atomic size, i.e. b ≫⟨r⟩, so that |R(t)| ≫|r| for all t. Replace ˆV (t)
by its ﬁrst order expansion in |r|/|R| and express the result in terms of the
coordinates x and y of the electron, and of b, v and t.
10.1.3. Initially, at time t = −∞, the atom is in a state |i⟩of energy Ei.
Using ﬁrst order time-dependent perturbation theory, write the probability
amplitude γif to ﬁnd the atom in the ﬁnal state |f⟩of energy Ef after the
charged particle has passed (t = +∞). We set ωfi = (Ef −Ei)/¯h and we only
consider the case Ef ̸= Ei.
10.1.4. The calculation of γif involves the Bessel function K0(z). One has

Express γif in terms of K0 and its derivative.
The asymptotic behavior of K0 is K0(z) ≃−ln z for z ≪1, and K0(z) ≃

2π/z e−z for z ≫1. Under what condition on the parameters ωfi, b and v
is the transition probability Pif = |γif|2 large?
Show that, in that case, one obtains

10.2.2. Using the Thomas–Reiche–Kuhn sum rule, calculate the expectation
value δE of the energy loss of the incident particle when it interacts with the
atom.
Let E be the energy of the particle before the interaction. Which parame-
ters does the product E δE depend on?
10.2.3. Experimental Application. We are now interested in incident par-
ticles which are fully ionized atoms (Z1 = Z, where Z is the atomic number),
whose masses are, to a good approximation, proportional to the mass num-
ber A = Z + N (where N is the number of neutrons of the isotope). When
these ions traverse condensed matter, they interact with many atoms of the
medium, and their energy loss implies some averaging over the random impact
parameter b. The previous result then takes the form
E δE = kZ2A ,
where the constant k depends on the nature of the medium.
Semiconductor detectors used for the identiﬁcation of the nuclei in nu-
clear reactions are based on this result. In the following example, the ions to
be identiﬁed are the ﬁnal state products of a reaction induced by 113 MeV
nitrogen ions impinging on a target of silver atoms.
In Fig. 10.2 each point represents an event, i.e. the energy E and energy loss
δE of an ion when it crosses a silicon detector. The reference point corresponds
to the isotope A = 12 of carbon 12
6 C (we use the notation A
ZN for a nucleus
charge Z and mass number A) which loses δE = 30 MeV at an energy E =
50 MeV.
(a) Calculate the constant k and the theoretical prediction for the energy
loss at 60 and 70 MeV. Put the corresponding points on the ﬁgure.
(b) Assuming the reaction could produce the following isotopes:
– boron, Z = 5, A = 10, 11, 12
– carbon, Z = 6, A = 11, 12, 13, 14
– nitrogen Z = 7, A = 13, 14, 15, 16,

10.3 Solutions

10.1.1. The interaction potential between the particle and the atom is the

The probability Pif = |γif|2 is large if K0 or K′
0 are also large. This happens
for ωfib/v ≪1. In this limit, K0(z) ∼−ln z and K′
0(z) ∼−1/z, and we
obtain

Since |⟨f|ˆx|i⟩| ≃|⟨f|ˆy|i⟩|, one can neglect the second term (x ln x ≪1 for

Pif = |γif|2 ≃

10.1.5. The time τ = b/v is the characteristic time during which the inter-
action is important, as we can see on the above formulas. For t ≫τ, the
interaction is negligible.
The condition ωfiτ ≪1 means that the interaction time τ must be much
smaller than the Bohr period ∼1/ωfi of the atom. The perturbation ˆV (t)
must have a large Fourier component at ω = ωfi if we want the probability
Pif to be signiﬁcant (the shorter in time the perturbation, the larger the

spread of its Fourier transform in frequency). In the opposite limiting case,
where the perturbation is inﬁnitely slow, the atom is not excited.
This observation provides an alternative way to evaluate the integrals of
question 1.3. The only values of t which contribute signiﬁcantly are those for
which t is not too large, compared to τ (say |t| ≪10 τ). If ωfiτ ≪1, one
can replace eiωfit by 1 in these integrals; the second integral is then zero for
symmetry reasons and the ﬁrst one is easily evaluated, and gives the desired
result.

we use the closure relation:

(b) For carbon, 12C is produced more abundantly than 13C, 14C and 11C.

tion of 15N, but practically no 13N or 16N.

10.4 Comments
Ionization of matter has numerous applications, for instance in developing
detectors for particle and nuclear physics, or in deﬁning protection regulations
against radioactivity. In order to calculate the energy loss of an ion in matter,
one must integrate the above results over the impact parameter. In practice,
taking everything into account, one ends up with the following formula, due
to Hans Bethe and Felix Bloch, for the rate of energy loss per unit length:

(10.1)
where β = v/c, K is a constant, N is the number density of atoms in the
medium and I is the mean excitation energy of the medium (I ∼11.5 eV).
The cases of protons or heavy ions is of great interest and, in comparatively
recent years, it has allowed a major improvement in the medical treatment of
tumors in the eyes (proton therapy) and in the brain (ion therapy) . Owing
to the factor 1/β2, or equivalently 1/v2, in (10.1), practically all the energy
is deposited in a very localized region near the stopping point. Figure (10.4)
shows the comparison between the eﬀect of ion beams and photons. One can
see the enormous advantage, from the medical point of view, of heavy ion
beams. These permit to attack and destroy tumors in a very accurate and
localized manner, as opposed to γ rays which produce damages all around the
point of interest.
Pioneering work on brain tumor therapy has been developed in Darmstadt
at the Heavy ion accelerator facility. Information can be found on the sites

The EPR Problem and Bell’s Inequality
When a quantum system possesses more than one degree of freedom, the asso-
ciated Hilbert space is a tensor product of the spaces associated to each degree
of freedom. This structure leads to speciﬁc properties of quantum mechanics,
whose paradoxical character has been pointed out by Einstein, Podolsky and
Rosen. Here we study an example of such a situation, by considering entangled
states for the spins of two particles.
The system under consideration is a hydrogen atom which is dissociated
into an electron and a proton. We consider the spin states of these two parti-
cles when they have left the dissociation region and are located in geometri-
cally distinct regions, e.g. a few meters from one another. They are then free
particles whose spin states do not evolve.
11.1 The Electron Spin
Consider a unit vector uϕ in the (z, x) plane: uϕ = cos ϕ uz + sin ϕ ux, where
uz and ux are unit vectors along the z and x axes. We note ˆSeϕ = ˆSe.uϕ the
component of the electron spin along the uϕ axis.
11.1.1. What are the eigenvalues of ˆSeϕ?
11.1.2. We denote the eigenvectors of ˆSeϕ by |e : + ϕ⟩and |e : −ϕ⟩which,
in the limit ϕ = 0, reduce respectively to the eigenvectors |e : +⟩and |e : −⟩
of ˆSez. Express |e : + ϕ⟩and |e : −ϕ⟩in terms of |e : +⟩and |e : −⟩.
11.1.3. Assume the electron is emitted in the state |e : + ϕ⟩. One measures
the component ˆSeα of the spin along the direction uα = cos α uz + sin α ux.
What is the probability P+(α) of ﬁnding the electron in the state |e : + α⟩?
What is the expectation value ⟨ˆSeα⟩in the spin state |e : + ϕ⟩?

11 The EPR Problem and Bell’s Inequality
11.2 Correlations Between the Two Spins
We ﬁrst assume that, after the dissociation, the electron–proton system is in
the factorized spin state |e : + ϕ⟩⊗|p : −ϕ⟩.
We recall that if |u1⟩and |u2⟩are vectors of E, and |v1⟩and |v2⟩of F, if
|u⟩⊗|v⟩belongs to the tensor product G = E ⊗F, and if ˆA and ˆB act
respectively in E and F, ˆC = ˆA ⊗ˆB acting in G, one has:
⟨u2| ⊗⟨v2| ˆC |u1⟩⊗|v1⟩= ⟨u2| ˆA|u1⟩⟨v2| ˆB|v1⟩.
11.2.1. What is the probability P+(α) of ﬁnding +¯h/2 when measuring the
component ˆSeα of the electron spin in this state?
Having found this value, what is the state of the system after the measure-
ment?
Is the proton spin state aﬀected by the measurement of the electron spin?
11.2.2. Calculate the expectation values ⟨ˆSeα⟩and ⟨ˆSpβ⟩of the components
of the electron and the proton spins along axes deﬁned respectively by uα and
uβ = cos β uz + sin β ux.
11.2.3. The correlation coeﬃcient between the two spins E(α, β) is deﬁned
as
E(α, β) = ⟨ˆSeα ⊗ˆSpβ⟩−⟨ˆSeα⟩⟨ˆSpβ⟩

spin state:

rection uα. Give the possible results and their probabilities.
11.3.2. Suppose the result of this measurement is +¯h/2. Later on, one mea-
sures the component ˆSpβ of the proton spin along the direction uβ. Here again
give the possible results and their probabilities.
11.3.3. Would one have the same probabilities if the proton spin had been
measured before the electron spin?
Why was this result shocking for Einstein who claimed that “the real states
of two spatially separated objects must be independent of one another”?

11.4 A Simple Hidden Variable Model
101
11.3.4. Calculate the expectation values ⟨ˆSeα⟩and ⟨ˆSpβ⟩of the electron and
the proton spin components if the system is in the singlet state (11.2).
11.3.5. Calculate E(α, β) in the singlet state.
11.4 A Simple Hidden Variable Model
For Einstein and several other physicists, the solution to the “paradox” uncov-
ered in the previous section could come from the fact that the states of quan-
tum mechanics, in particular the singlet state (11.2), provide an incomplete
description of reality. A “complete” theory (for predicting spin measurements,
in the present case) should incorporate additional variables or parameters,
whose knowledge would render measurements independent for two spatially
separated objects. However, present experiments cannot determine the values
of these parameters, which are therefore called “hidden variables”. The ex-
perimental result should then consist in some averaging over these unknown
parameters.
In the case of interest, a very simpliﬁed example of such a theory is the
following. We assume that, after each dissociation, the system is in a factorized
state |e : +ϕ⟩⊗|p : −ϕ⟩, but that the direction ϕ varies from one event to the
other. In this case, ϕ is the hidden variable. We assume that all directions ϕ
are equally probable, i.e. the probability density that the decay occurs with
direction ϕ is uniform and equal to 1/2π.
Owing to this ignorance of the value of ϕ, the expectation value of an
observable ˆA is now deﬁned to be:
⟨ˆA⟩= 1

11.4.2. The ﬁrst precise experimental tests of hidden variable descriptions
vs. quantum mechanics have been performed on correlated pairs of photons
emitted in an atomic cascade.1 Although one is not dealing with spin-1/2
particles in this case, the physical content is basically the same as here. As
an example, Fig. 11.1 presents experimental results obtained by A. Aspect
and his collaborators in 1982. It gives the variation of E(α, β) as a function
of the diﬀerence α −β, which is found to be the only experimentally relevant
1 The precision has now been greatly improved with the use of photon pairs
produced by nonlinear splitting of ultraviolet photons (for a review, see e.g.
A. Aspect, Nature, vol. 398, p. 189 (18 March 1999)).

Which theory, quantum mechanics or the simple hidden variable model de-
veloped above, gives a good account of the experimental data?
11.5 Bell’s Theorem and Experimental Results
As proved by Bell in 1965, the disagreement between the predictions of quan-
tum mechanics and those of hidden variable theories is actually very general
when one considers correlation measurements on entangled states. We now
show that the correlation results for hidden variable theories are constrained
by what is known as Bell’s inequality, which, however, can be violated by
quantum mechanics in speciﬁc experimental conﬁgurations.
Consider a hidden variable theory, whose result consists in two functions
A(λ, uα) and B(λ, uβ) giving respectively the results of the electron and pro-
ton spin measurements. Each of these two functions takes only the two values
¯h/2 and −¯h/2. It depends on the value of the hidden variable λ for the con-
sidered electron–proton pair. The nature of this hidden variable need not be
further speciﬁed for the proof of Bell’s theorem. The result A of course de-
pends on the axis uα chosen for the measurement of the electron spin, but
it does not depend on the axis uβ. Similarly B does not depend on uα. This
locality hypothesis is essential for the following discussion.

|S| ≤2 .
11.5.4. Consider the particular case α −β = β′ −α = α′ −β′ = π/4, and
compare the predictions of quantum mechanics with the constraint imposed
by Bell’s inequality.
11.5.5. The experimental results obtained by A. Aspect et al. are E(α, β) =
−0.66 (±0.04) for α−β = π/4 and E(α, β) = +0.68 (±0.03) for α−β = 3π/4.
Is a description of these experimental results by a local hidden variable theory
possible?
Are these results compatible with quantum mechanics?

The eigenvalues of this operator are +¯h/2 and −¯h/2.

2 |e : +⟩+ sin ϕ
2 |e : −⟩
|e : −ϕ⟩= −sin ϕ
2 |e : +⟩+ cos ϕ
2 |e : −⟩.
11.1.3. The probability amplitude is ⟨e : + α|e : + ϕ⟩= cos((ϕ −α)/2) and
the probability P+(α) = cos2((ϕ −α)/2). Similarly P−(α) = sin2((ϕ −α)/2),
and the expectation value is, ﬁnally,
⟨ˆSeα⟩= ¯h
2 cos (ϕ −α) .

11 The EPR Problem and Bell’s Inequality
Section 11.2:
Correlations Between the Two Spins
11.2.1. The projector on the eigenstate |e : + α⟩, corresponding to the mea-
sured value, is |e : + α⟩⟨e : + α| ⊗ˆIp, where ˆIp is the identity operator on
the proton states. Therefore
P+(α) = |⟨e : + α|e : + ϕ⟩|2 = cos2 ϕ −α
2
,
and the state after measurement is |e : + α⟩⊗|p : −ϕ⟩. The proton spin
is not aﬀected, because the initial state is factorized (all probability laws are
factorized).
11.2.2. One has ⟨ˆSeα⟩= ¯h
2 cos (ϕ −α) and ⟨ˆSpβ⟩= −¯h
2 cos (ϕ −β).
11.2.3. By deﬁnition, one has:
ˆS2
eα = ¯h2
4
ˆIe
and
ˆS2
pβ = ¯h2
4
ˆIp
and
⟨ˆSeα ⊗ˆSpβ⟩= ⟨e : + ϕ| ˆSeα|e : + ϕ⟩⟨p : −ϕ| ˆSpβ|p : −ϕ⟩
= −¯h2
4 cos(ϕ −α) cos(ϕ −β) .
Therefore E(α, β) = 0. This just reﬂects the fact that in a factorized state,
the two spin variables are independent.
Section 11.3:
Correlations in the Singlet State
11.3.1. There are two possible values:
¯h/2, corresponding to the projector |e : + α⟩⟨e : + α| ⊗ˆIp, and
−¯h/2, corresponding to the projector |e : −α⟩⟨e : −α| ⊗ˆIp.
Therefore, the probabilities are
P+(α) = 1
2

|⟨e : + α|e : +⟩|2 + |⟨e : + α|e : −⟩|2
= 1/2
and similarly P−(α) = 1/2. This result is a consequence of the rotational
invariance of the singlet state.
11.3.2. The state after the measurement of the electron spin, yielding the
result +¯h/2, is
cos α
2 |e : + α⟩⊗|p :−⟩−sin α
2 |e :+ α⟩⊗|p :+⟩= |e : + α⟩⊗|p :−α⟩.
This simple result is also a consequence of the rotational invariance of the
singlet state, which can be written as

11.6 Solutions
105
|Ψs⟩=
1
√
2 (|e : + α⟩⊗|p : −α⟩−|e : −α⟩⊗|p : + α⟩) .
Now the two possible results for the measurement of the proton spin ±¯h/2
have probabilities
P+(β) = sin2 α −β
2
P−(β) = cos2 α −β
2
.
11.3.3. If one had measured ˆSpβ ﬁrst, one would have found P+(β) =
P−(β) = 1/2.
The fact that a measurement on the electron aﬀects the probabilities for the
results of a measurement on the proton, although the two particles are spa-
tially separated, is in contradiction with Einstein’s assertion, or belief. This
is the starting point of the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox. Quantum me-
chanics is not a local theory as far as measurement is concerned.
Note, however, that this non-locality does not allow the instantaneous
transmission of information. From a single measurement of the proton spin,
one cannot determine whether the electron spin has been previously measured.
It is only when, for a series of experiments, the results of the measurements
on the electron and the proton are later compared, that one can ﬁnd this
non-local character of quantum mechanics.
11.3.4. Individually, the expectation values vanish, since one does not worry
about the other variable:
⟨ˆSeα⟩= ⟨ˆSpβ⟩= 0 .
11.3.5. However, the spins are correlated and we have
⟨ˆSeα ⊗ˆSpβ⟩= ¯h2
4

sin2 α −β

−cos2 α −β

and therefore
E(α, β) = −cos(α −β).
Section 11.4:

11.4.1. Using the results of Sect. 2, we have:
⟨ˆSeα⟩= ¯h
2

cos(ϕ −α) dϕ
2π = 0
and similarly ⟨ˆSpβ⟩= 0. We also obtain

106
11 The EPR Problem and Bell’s Inequality
Therefore, in this simple hidden variable model,
E(α, β) = −1
2 cos(α −β).
In such a model, one ﬁnds a non-vanishing correlation coeﬃcient, which is
an interesting observation. Even more interesting is that this correlation is
smaller than the prediction of quantum mechanics by a factor 2.
11.4.2. The experimental points agree with the predictions of quantum me-
chanics, and undoubtedly disagree with the results of the particular hidden
variable model we have considered. We must however point out that the data
given in the text is not the actual measured data. The “true” results are shown
in Fig. 11.2, where the error bars correspond only to statistical errors. The
diﬀerence from theory (i.e. quantum mechanics) is due to systematic errors,
mainly the acceptance of the detectors.

Section 11.5:
Bell’s Theorem and Experimental Results
11.5.1. In the framework of a hidden variable theory, the correlation coeﬃ-
cient is
E(α, β) = 4
¯h2

P(λ) A(λ, uα) B(λ, uβ) dλ ,
where P(λ) is the (unknown) distribution law for the variable λ, with
P(λ) > 0
∀λ
and

P(λ) dλ = 1 .

11.6 Solutions
107
Note that we assume here that the hidden variable theory reproduces the
one-operator averages found for the singlet state:
⟨Seα⟩=

P(λ) A(λ, uα) dλ = 0
⟨Spβ⟩=

P(λ) B(λ, uβ) dλ = 0.
If this was not the case, such a hidden variable theory should clearly be re-
jected since it would not reproduce a well established experimental result.
11.5.2. The quantity of interest can be written:
A(λ, uα)

B(λ, uβ) + B(λ, u′
β)

+ A(λ, u′
α)

B(λ, u′
β) −B(λ, uβ)

.
The two quantities B(λ, uβ) and B(λ, u′
β) can take only the two values ±¯h/2.
Therefore one has either
B(λ, uβ) + B(λ, u′
β) = ±¯h
B(λ, uβ) −B(λ, u′
β) = 0
or
B(λ, uβ) + B(λ, u′
β) = 0
B(λ, uβ) −B(λ, u′
β) = ±¯h ,
hence the result, since |A(λ, uα)| = |A(λ, u′
β)| = ¯h/2.
11.5.3. We multiply the result (11.4) by P(λ) and integrate over λ. Bell’s
inequality follows immediately.
11.5.4. The quantum mechanical result for S is
SQ = −cos(α −β) −cos(α −β′) −cos(α′ −β′) + cos(α′ −β) .
In general, if we set θ1 = α −β, θ2 = β′ −α, θ3 = α′ −β′, we can look for the
extrema of
f(θ1, θ2, θ3) = cos(θ1 + θ2 + θ3) −(cos θ1 + cos θ2 + cos θ3) .
The extrema correspond to θ1 = θ2 = θ3 and sin θ1 = sin 3θ1, whose solutions
between 0 and π are θ1 = 0, π/4, 3π/4, π . Deﬁning the function g(θ1) =
−3 cos θ1 + cos 3θ1 we have: g(0) = −2, g(π/4) = −2
√
2, g(3π/4) = 2
√
2,
g(π) = 2.
We have represented the variation of g(θ) in Fig. 11.3. The shaded areas
correspond to results which cannot be explained by hidden variable theories.
In particular, for α −β = β′ −α = α′ −β′ = π/4, we get SQ = −2
√
2, which
clearly violates Bell’s inequality. This system constitutes therefore a test of
the predictions of quantum mechanics vs. any local hidden variable theory.
11.5.5. The numbers given in the text lead to |3E(π/4) −E(3π/4)| =
2.66 (±0.15) in excellent agreement with quantum mechanics (2
√
2) but in-
compatible with hidden variable theories.
As in the previous question, the actual measurements were in fact E(π/4) =
−0.62 (±0.04), E(3π/4) = 0.60 (±0.03), therefore |3E(π/4) −E(3π/4)| =

108
11 The EPR Problem and Bell’s Inequality
2.46 (±0.15) which violates unquestionably Bell’s inequality, and is consistent
with the quantum mechanical prediction.
It is therefore not possible to ﬁnd a local hidden variable theory which
gives a good account of experiment.

Schr¨odinger’s Cat
The superposition principle states that if |φa⟩and |φb⟩are two possible states
of a quantum system, the quantum superposition (|φa⟩+ |φb⟩)/
√
2 is also an
allowed state for this system. This principle is essential in explaining inter-
ference phenomena. However, when it is applied to “large” objects, it leads
to paradoxical situations where a system can be in a superposition of states
which is classically self-contradictory (antinomic).
The most famous example is Schr¨odinger’s “cat paradox” where the cat
is in a superposition of the “dead” and “alive” states. The purpose of this
chapter is to show that such superpositions of macroscopic states are not
detectable in practice. They are extremely fragile, and a very weak coupling
to the environment suﬃces to destroy the quantum superposition of the two
states |φa⟩and |φb⟩.
12.1 The Quasi-Classical States
of a Harmonic Oscillator
In this chapter, we shall consider high energy excitations of a one-dimensional
harmonic oscillator, of mass m and frequency ω. The Hamiltonian is written
ˆH = ˆp2
2m + 1
2mω2ˆx2 .
We denote the eigenstates of ˆH by {|n⟩}. The energy of the state |n⟩is En =
(n + 1/2)¯hω.
12.1.1. Preliminaries. We introduce the operators ˆX = ˆx

12 Schr¨odinger’s Cat
We recall the commutators: [ ˆX, ˆP] = i, [ˆa, ˆa†] = 1, and the relations: ˆH =
¯hω( ˆN + 1/2) and ˆN|n⟩= n|n⟩.
(a) Check that if one works with functions of the dimensionless variables X
and P, one has
ˆP = −i ∂
∂X
ˆX = i ∂
∂P .
(b) Evaluate the commutator [ ˆN, ˆa], and prove that
ˆa|n⟩= √n|n −1⟩
(12.1)
up to a phase factor which we set equal to 1 in what follows.
(c) Using (12.1) for n = 0 and expressing ˆa in terms of ˆX and ˆP, calculate
the wave function of the ground state ψ0(X) and its Fourier transform
ϕ0(P). It is not necessary to normalize the result.
12.1.2. The Quasi-Classical States. The eigenstates of the operator ˆa are
called quasi-classical states, for reasons which we now examine.
Consider an arbitrary complex number α. Show that the following state
|α⟩= e−|α|2/2 
n
αn
√
n!
|n⟩
(12.2)
is a normalized eigenstate of ˆa with eigenvalue α: ˆa|α⟩= α|α⟩.
12.1.3. Calculate the expectation value of the energy in a quasi-classical
state |α⟩. Calculate also the expectation values ⟨x⟩and ⟨p⟩and the root mean
square deviations ∆x and ∆p for this state. Show that one has ∆x ∆p = ¯h/2.
12.1.4. Following a similar procedure as in question 1.1(c) above, determine
the wave function ψα(X) of the quasi-classical state |α⟩, and its Fourier trans-
form ϕα(P). Again, it is not necessary to normalize the result.
12.1.5. Suppose that at time t = 0, the oscillator is in a quasi-classical state
|α0⟩with α0 = ρeiφ where ρ is a real positive number.
(a) Show that at any later time t the oscillator is also in a quasi-classical
state which can be written as e−iωt/2|α(t)⟩. Determine the value of α(t)
in terms of ρ, φ, ω and t.
(b) Evaluate ⟨x⟩t and ⟨p⟩t. Taking 1.3, and assuming that |α| ≫1, justify
brieﬂy why these states are called “quasi-classical”.
12.1.6. Numerical Example. Consider a simple pendulum of length 1 me-
ter and of mass 1 gram. Assume the state of this pendulum can be described by
a quasi-classical state. At time t = 0 the pendulum is at ⟨x0⟩= 1 micrometer
from its classical equilibrium position, with zero mean velocity.
(a) What is the corresponding value of α(0)?
(b) What is the relative uncertainty on its position ∆x/x0?
(c) What is the value of α(t) after 1/4 period of oscillation?

12.2 Construction of a Schr¨odinger-Cat State
During the time interval [0, T], one adds to the harmonic potential, the cou-
pling
ˆW = ¯hg (ˆa†ˆa)2 .
We assume that g is much larger than ω and that ωT ≪1. Hence, we can
make the approximation that, during the interval [0, T], the Hamiltonian of
the system is simply ˆW. At time t = 0, the system is in a quasi-classical state
|ψ(0)⟩= |α⟩.
12.2.1. Show that the states |n⟩are eigenstates of ˆW, and write the expan-
sion of the state |ψ(T)⟩at time T on the basis {|n⟩}.

(b) Consider a value of |α| of the same order of magnitude as in 1.6. In what
sense can this state be considered a concrete example of the “Schr¨odinger
cat” type of state mentioned in the introduction?
12.3 Quantum Superposition Versus Statistical Mixture
We now study the properties of the state (12.3) in a “macroscopic” situation

12.3.1. Consider a quantum system in the state (12.3). Write the (non-norm-
alized) probability distributions for the position and for the momentum of the
system. These probability distributions are represented in Fig. 12.1 for α = 5i.
Interpret these distributions physically.
12.3.2. A physicist (Alice) prepares N independent systems all in the state
(12.3) and measures the momentum of each of these systems. The measuring
apparatus has a resolution δp such that:

For N ≫1, draw qualitatively the histogram of the results of the N measure-

12.3.3. The state (12.3) represents the quantum superposition of two states
which are macroscopically diﬀerent, and therefore leads to the paradoxical
situations mentioned in the introduction. Another physicist (Bob) claims that
the measurements done by Alice have not been performed on N quantum
systems in the state (12.3), but that Alice is actually dealing with a non-
paradoxical “statistical mixture”, that is to say that half of the N systems
are in the state |α⟩and the other half in the state | −α⟩. Assuming this is
true, does one obtain the same probability distribution as for the previous
question for the N momentum measurements?
12.3.4. In order to settle the matter, Alice now measures the position of each
of N independent systems, all prepared in the state (12.3). Draw the shape
of the resulting distribution of events, assuming that the resolution δx of the

ments assuming he is dealing with a statistical mixture?
12.3.6. Considering the numerical value obtained in the case of a simple pen-
dulum in question 1.6, evaluate the resolution δx which is necessary in order
to tell the diﬀerence between a set of N systems in the quantum superposition
(12.3), and a statistical mixture consisting in N/2 pendulums in the state |α⟩
and N/2 pendulums in the state | −α⟩.
12.4 The Fragility of a Quantum Superposition
In a realistic physical situation, one must take into account the coupling of
the oscillator with its environment, in order to estimate how long one can
discriminate between the quantum superposition (12.3) (that is to say the
“Schr¨odinger cat” which is “alive and dead”) and a simple statistical mixture
(i.e. a set of cats (systems), half of which are alive, the other half being dead;
each cat being either alive or dead.)

12.4 The Fragility of a Quantum Superposition
113
If the oscillator is initially in the quasi-classical state |α0⟩and if the en-
vironment is in a state |χe(0)⟩, the wave function of the total system is the
product of the individual wave functions, and the state vector of the total
system can be written as the (tensor) product of the state vectors of the two
subsystems:
|Φ(0)⟩= |α0⟩|χe(0)⟩.
The coupling is responsible for the damping of the oscillator’s amplitude. At
a later time t, the state vector of the total system becomes:
|Φ(t)⟩= |α1⟩|χe(t)⟩
with α1 = α(t)e−γt; the number α(t) corresponds to the quasi-classical state
one would ﬁnd in the absence of damping (question 1.5(a)) and γ is a real
positive number.
12.4.1. Using the result 1.3, give the expectation value of the energy of the
oscillator at time t, and the energy acquired by the environment when 2γt ≪1.
12.4.2. For initial states of the “ Schr¨odinger cat” type for the oscillator, the
state vector of the total system is, at t = 0,

|α1| ≫1. |χ(+)
e
(t)⟩and |χ(−)
e
(t)⟩are two normalized states of the environment
that are a priori diﬀerent (but not orthogonal).
The probability distribution of the oscillator’s position, measured indepen-
dently of the state of the environment, is then

sition and a statistical mixture?

12.4.3. In a very simple model, the environment is represented by a second
oscillator, of same mass and frequency as the ﬁrst one. We assume that this
second oscillator is initially in its ground state |χe(0)⟩= |0⟩. If the coupling
between the two oscillators is quadratic, we will take for granted that

the states |χ(±)

(b) Using the expression found in question 4.1 for the energy of the ﬁrst os-
cillator, determine the typical energy transfer between the two oscillators,
above which the diﬀerence between a quantum superposition and a sta-
tistical mixture becomes unobservable.
12.4.4. Consider again the simple pendulum described above. Assume the
damping time is one year (a pendulum in vacuum with reduced friction).
Using the result of the previous question, evaluate the time during which a
“Schr¨odinger cat” state can be observed. Comment and conclude.

and ˆa|n⟩is an eigenvector of ˆN corresponding to the eigenvalue n−1. We know
from the theory of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator that the energy
levels are not degenerated. Therefore we ﬁnd that ˆa|n⟩= µ|n −1⟩, where the
coeﬃcient µ is determined by calculating the norm of ˆa|n⟩:

If T = π/g, then e−ign2T = e−iπn2 = 1 if n is even, −1 if n is odd, therefore
e−ign2T = (−1)n
⇒
|ψ(T)⟩= | −α⟩
12.2.3. If T = π/2g, then e−ign2T = e−i π
2 n2 = 1 for n even, and e−ign2T = −i
if n is odd.
We can rewrite this relation as

12.2.4.
(a) For α = iρ, in the state |α⟩, the oscillator has a zero mean
position and a positive velocity. In the state | −α⟩, the oscillator also has
a zero mean position, but a negative velocity. The state 12.3 is a quantum
superposition of these two situations.
(b) If |α| ≫1, the states |α⟩and | −α⟩are macroscopically diﬀerent
(antinomic). The state 12.3 is a quantum superposition of such states. It there-
fore constitutes a (peaceful) version of Schr¨odinger’s cat, where we represent
“dead” or “alive” cats by simple vectors of Hilbert space.
Section 12.3:
Quantum Superposition Versus Statistical Mixture

are

In the latter equation, we have used the fact that, for ρ ≫1, the two Gaussians
centered at ρ
√
2 and −ρ
√
2 have a negligible overlap.
12.3.2. Alice will ﬁnd two peaks, each of which contains roughly half of the
events, centered respectively at p0 and −p0.

118
12 Schr¨odinger’s Cat
12.3.3. The statistical mixture of Bob leads to the same momentum distrib-
ution as that measured by Alice: the N/2 oscillators in the state |α⟩all lead
to a mean momentum +p0, and the N/2 oscillators in the state |−α⟩to −p0.
Up to this point, there is therefore no diﬀerence, and no paradoxical behavior
related to the quantum superposition (12.3).
12.3.4. In the X variable, the resolution of the detector satisﬁes
δX ≪1
|α| = 1
ρ
Alice therefore has a suﬃcient resolution to observe the oscillations of the
function cos2(Xρ
√
2−π/4) in the distribution P(X). The shape of the distri-
bution will therefore reproduce the probability law of X drawn on ﬁgure 12.1,
i.e. a modulation of period (¯hπ2/(2mα2ω))1/2, with a Gaussian envelope.
12.3.5. If Bob performs a position measurement on the N/2 systems in the
state |α⟩, he will ﬁnd a Gaussian distribution corresponding to the probability
law P(X) ∝|ψα(X)|2 ∝exp(−X)2. He will ﬁnd the same distribution for the
N/2 systems in the state | −α⟩. The sum of his results will be a Gaussian
distribution, which is quite diﬀerent from the result expected by Alice. The
position measurement should, in principle, allow one to discriminate between
the quantum superposition and the statistical mixture.
12.3.6. The necessary resolution is δx ≪

mω ∼5 10−26 m. Unfortu-
nately, it is impossible to attain such a resolution in practice.
Section 12.4:
The Fragility of a Quantum Superposition
12.4.1. We have E(t) = ¯hω(|α0|2e−2γt + 1/2): this energy decreases with
time. After a time much longer than γ−1, the oscillator is in its ground state.
This dissipation model corresponds to a zero temperature environment. The
mean energy acquired by the environment E(0)−E(t) is, for 2γt ≪1, ∆E(t) ≃
2¯hω|α0|2γt.
12.4.2.
(a) The probability distribution of the position keeps its Gaussian
envelope, but the contrast of the oscillations is reduced by a factor η.
(b) The probability distribution of the momentum is given by
P(p) = 1
2(|ϕα1(p)|2 + |ϕ−α1(p)|2 + 2η Re(iϕ∗
−α1(p)ϕα1(p)))
Since the overlap of the two Gaussians ϕα1(p) and ϕ−α1(p) is negligible for
|α1| ≫1, the crossed term, which is proportional to η does not contribute
signiﬁcantly. One recovers two peaks centered at ±|α1|
√
2m¯hω.
The diﬀerence between a quantum superposition and a statistical mixture
can be made by position measurements. The quantum superposition leads to
a modulation of spatial period (¯hπ2/(2mα2ω))1/2 with a Gaussian envelope,

12.6 Comments

whereas only the Gaussian is observed on a statistical mixture. In order to
see this modulation, it must not be too small, say
η ≥1/10 .

⟨β| −β⟩= e−|β|2 

= e−|β|2e−|β|2 = e−2|β|2
(b) From the previous considerations, we must have e−2|β|2 ≥1/10, i.e.
|β| ≤1.
For times shorter than γ−1, the energy of the ﬁrst oscillator is
E(t) = E(0) −2γt|α0|2¯hω .
The energy of the second oscillator is
E′(t) = ¯hω(|β(t)|2 + 1/2) = ¯hω/2 + 2γt|α0|2¯hω .
The total energy is conserved; the energy transferred during time t is ∆E(t) =
2γt|α0|2¯hω = ¯hω|β|2. In order to distinguish between a quantum superposi-
tion and a statistical mixture, we must have ∆E ≤¯hω. In other words, if a
single energy quantum ¯hω is transferred, it becomes problematic to tell the
diﬀerence.
12.4.4. With 1/2γ = 1 year = 3 × 107 seconds, the time it takes to reach
|β| = 1 is (2γ|α0|2)−1 ≃2 × 10−12 seconds!
12.6 Comments
Even for a system as well protected from the environment as what we have
assumed for the pendulum, the quantum superpositions of macroscopic states
are unobservable. After a very short time, all measurements one can make
on a system initially prepared in such a state coincide with those made on a
statistical mixture. It is therefore not possible, at present, to observe the eﬀects
related to the paradoxical character of a macroscopic quantum superposition.
However, it is quite possible to observe “mesoscopic” kittens, for systems
which have a limited number of degrees of freedom and are well isolated. The
ﬁrst attempts concerned SQUIDS (Josephson junctions in superconducting
rings), but the results were not conclusive. The idea developed here is oriented
towards quantum optics, and has been proposed by Bernard Yurke and David
Stoler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 57, p. 13 (1986).
The most conclusive results have
been obtained at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, on microwave photons
(50 GHz) stored in a superconducting cavity (M. Brune, E. Hagley, J. Dreyer,
X. Maitre, A. Maali, C. Wunderlich, J.-M. Raimond, and S. Haroche, Phys.

120
12 Schr¨odinger’s Cat
Rev. Lett. 77, 4887 (1996)). The ﬁeld stored in the cavity is a quasi-perfect
harmonic oscillator. The preparation of the kitten (Sect. 2) is accomplished
by sending atoms through the cavity. Dissipation (Sect. 4) corresponds to the
very weak residual absorption by the walls of the superconducting cavity. One
can devise “kittens” made of 5 or 10 photons (i.e. |α|2 = 5 or 10) and one
can check precisely the theory, including the decoherence due to dissipation
eﬀects.

Quantum Cryptography
Cryptography consists in sending a message to a correspondent and in min-
imizing the risk for this message to be intercepted by an unwanted outsider.
The present chapter shows how quantum mechanics can provide a procedure
to achieve this goal. We assume here that Alice (A) wants to send Bob (B)
some information which may be coded in the binary system, for instance
+ + −−−+ + −· · ·
(13.1)
We denote the number of bits of this message by n. Alice wants to send this
message to Bob only if she has made sure that no “spy” is listening to the
communication.
13.1 Preliminaries
Consider a spin 1/2 particle. The spin operator is ˆS = (¯h/2)ˆσ where the set
ˆσi, i = x, y, z are the Pauli matrices. We write |σz = +1⟩and |σz = −1⟩for
the eigenstates of ˆSz with respective eigenvalues +¯h/2 and −¯h/2.
Consider a particle in the state |σz = +1⟩. One measures the component
of the spin along an axis u in the (x, z) plane, deﬁned by the unit vector
eu = cos θ ez + sin θ ex ,
(13.2)
where ez and ex are the unit vectors along the z and x axes respectively. We
recall that the corresponding operator is
ˆS · eu = ¯h
2 (cos θ ˆσz + sin θ ˆσx) .
(13.3)
13.1.1. Show that the possible results of the measurement are +¯h/2 and
−¯h/2.

13 Quantum Cryptography
13.1.2. Show that the eigenstates of the observable (13.3) are (up to a mul-
tiplicative constant):
|σu = +1⟩=
cos φ |σz = +1⟩+ sin φ |σz = −1⟩
|σu = −1⟩= −sin φ |σz = +1⟩+ cos φ |σz = −1⟩
and express φ in terms of θ. Write the probabilities p±
u of ﬁnding +¯h/2 and
−¯h/2 when measuring the projection of the spin along the u axis.
13.1.3. What are the spin states after measurements that give the results
+¯h/2 and −¯h/2 along u?
13.1.4. Immediately after such a measurement, one measures the z compo-
nent of the spin.
(a) What are the possible results and what are the probabilities of ﬁnding
these results in terms of the results found previously along the u axis
(observable (13.3)).
(b) Show that the probability to recover the same value Sz = +¯h/2 as in
the initial state |σz = +1⟩is
P++(θ) = (1 + cos2 θ)/2.
(c) Assuming now that the initial state is |σz = −1⟩, what is, for the same
sequence of measurements, the probability P−−(θ) to recover Sz = −¯h/2
in the last measurement?
Fig. 13.1. A source emits a pair (a, b) of spin-1/2 particles. Alice measures the
component of the spin of a along a direction θa and Bob measures the component
of the spin of b along a direction θb
13.2 Correlated Pairs of Spins
A source produces a pair (a, b) of spin-1/2 particles (Fig. 13.1), prepared in
the state |ψ⟩= φ(ra, rb)|Σ⟩where the spin state of the two particles is
|Σ⟩=

123
Fig. 13.2. A spy, sitting between the source and Bob, measures the component of
the b spin along an axis θs
In other words, the spin variables are decoupled from the space variables
(ra, rb). In (13.4), |σa
u = ±⟩(speciﬁcally u = z) are the eigenstates of the u
component of the spin of particle a, and similarly for b.
13.2.1. Show that this state can also be written as:

13.2.2. The pair of particles (a, b) is prepared in the spin state (13.4), (13.5).
As the two particles move away from each another, this spin state remains
unchanged (unless a measurement is made).
(a) Alice ﬁrst measures the spin component of a along an axis ua of angle
θa. What are the possible results and the corresponding probabilities in
the two cases θa = 0, i.e. the z axis, and θa = π/2, i.e. the x axis?
(b) Show that, after Alice’s measurement, the spin state of the two particles
depends as follows on the measurement and its result
Axis

|σa
x = −1⟩⊗|σb

¿From then on, why can one ignore particle a as far as spin measurements
on b are concerned?
(We recall that if |ψ⟩= |u⟩⊗|v⟩is a factorized state and ˆC = ˆA⊗ˆB, where ˆA and
ˆB act respectively on the spaces of |u⟩and |v⟩, then ⟨ψ| ˆC|ψ⟩= ⟨u| ˆA|u⟩⟨v| ˆB|v⟩).
13.2.3. After Alice’s measurement, Bob measures the spin of particle b along
an axis ub of angle θb.
Give the possible results of Bob’s measurement and their probabilities in terms
of Alice’s results in the four following conﬁgurations:
(a) θa = 0, θb = 0;
(b) θa = 0, θb = π/2;
(c) θa = π/2, θb = 0;

124
13 Quantum Cryptography
1. Alice and Bob decide along which axes x and z they will make their
measurements.
2. Alice, who controls the source S, prepares an ordered sequence of
N ≫n pairs of spins in the state (13.4) (n is the number of bits of the
message). She sends the b spins to Bob and keeps the a spins.
3. For each spin that they collect, Alice and Bob measure either the
x or the z component. Each of them chooses the x or z direction at
random with probability p = 1/2. There is no correlation, for a given
pair of spins (a, b), between the axis chosen by Alice and the one chosen
by Bob. They both register all their results.
4. Bob selects a subset FN of his measurements. He communicates
openly to Alice (by cell phone, www, etc.) the axis and the result of
the measurement for each event of this subset. In practice F ∼0.5.
5. Alice compares, for this subset FN, her axes and her results with
those just communicated by Bob. By doing so, she can tell whether
or not a spy is present. If a spy is spotted, the procedure stops and a
“physical” search for the spy must be undertaken. Otherwise:
6. Alice makes a public announcement that she is convinced not to have
been spied upon, and Bob, still openly, communicates his axes of mea-
surements for the remaining spins. However, he does not communicate
the corresponding results.

(d) θa = π/2, θb = π/2.
In which cases do the measurements on a and b give with certainty the same
result?
13.2.4. Consider the situation θa = 0. Suppose that a “spy” sitting between
the source and Bob measures the spin of particle b along an axis us of angle
θs as sketched in Fig. 13.2.
(a) What are, in terms of θs and of Alice’s ﬁndings, the results of the spy’s
measurements and their probabilities?
(b) After the spy’s measurement, Bob measures the spin of b along the axis
deﬁned by θb = 0. What does Bob ﬁnd, and with what probabilities, in
terms of the spy’s results?
(c) What is the probability P(θs) that Alice and Bob ﬁnd the same results
after the spy’s measurement?
(d) What is the expectation value of P(θs) if the spy chooses θs at random
in the interval [0, 2π] with uniform probability?
What is this expectation value if the spy chooses only the two values
θs = 0 and θs = π/2 each with the same probability p = 1/2?

13.3 The Quantum Cryptography Procedure
In order to transmit conﬁdential information, Alice and Bob use the procedure
outlined in Fig. 13.3. Comment on this procedure, and answer the following
questions.
13.3.1. How can Alice be sure that a spy is present?
13.3.2. What is the probability that an operating spy will escape being de-
tected? Calculate this probability for FN = 200.
13.3.3. Does the spy become more “invisible” if he knows the system of axes
(x, z) chosen by Alice and Bob to perform their measurements?
13.3.4. Comment on the two “experiments” whose results are given in Tables
13.1 and 13.2. Show that a spy has certainly listened to communication 2.
What is the probability that a spy listened to communication 1, but remained
undetected?
13.3.5. Complete the missing item (number 7 in the above procedure), and
indicate how Alice can send her message (13.1) to Bob without using any
other spin pairs than the N pairs which Bob and her have already analyzed.
Using Table 13.3, tell how, in experiment 1, Alice can send to Bob the message

cos(θ/2)|σz = +1⟩+ sin(θ/2)|σz = −1⟩
|σu = −1⟩= −sin(θ/2)|σz = +1⟩+ cos(θ/2)|σz = −1⟩,
therefore φ = θ/2. The probabilities follow directly:

u = cos2(θ/2) , p−
u = sin2(θ/2) .

(a) If the measurement along u has given +¯h/2, then the probabilities for

where Alice and Bob would simply ﬁnd results of opposite signs by measuring
along the same axis.
13.2.2.
(a) Alice ﬁnds ±¯h/2 with p = 1/2 in each case. This result is
obtained by noticing that the projector on the eigenstate |σa
z = +1⟩is
ˆP a
+ = |σa
z = +1⟩⟨σa
z = +1| ⊗ˆIb and that p(+¯h/2) = ⟨Σ| ˆP a
+|Σ⟩= 1/2,
(and similarly for p(−¯h/2)).
(b) This array of results is a consequence of the reduction of the wave packet.
If Alice measures along the z axis, we use (13.4); the normalized projections
on the eigenstates of ˆSa
z are |σa
z = +1⟩⊗|σb
z = +1⟩(Alice’s result: +¯h/2)
and |σa
z = −1⟩⊗|σb
z = −1⟩(Alice’s result: −¯h/2). A similar formula holds for
a measurement along the x axis, because of the invariance property, and its
consequence, (13.5).
Any measurement on b (a probability, an expectation value) will imply
expectation values of operators of the type ˆIa ⊗ˆBb where ˆBb is a projector
or a spin operator. Since the states under consideration are factorized, the
corresponding expressions for spin measurements on b will be of the type
(⟨σa
z = +1| ⊗⟨σb
z = +1|)ˆIa ⊗ˆBb(|σa
z = +1⟩⊗|σb
z = +1⟩) .

This reduces to

z = +1⟩= ⟨σb

where the spin state of a is irrelevant.

similarly, the case θa = π/2, θb = π/2 is identical to θa = 0, θb = 0 (one
actually recovers the same result for any θa = θb).
In the two cases (a) and (d), where θa = θb, i.e. when they measure along the
same axis, Alice and Bob are sure to ﬁnd the same result.

(d) Amazingly enough, the two expectation values are the same. On one
hand, one has

P(θs)dθs/(2π) = 3/4. On the other, since P(0) = 1 and
P(π/2) = 1/2, on the average ¯p = 3/4 if the values θs = 0 and θs = π/2 are
chosen with equal probabilities.

Section 13.3:
The Quantum Cryptography Procedure
13.3.1. Necessarily, if θa = θb, the results of Alice and Bob must be the same.
If a single measurement done along the same axis θa = θb gives diﬀerent
results for Alice and Bob, a spy is certainly operating (at least in an ideal
experiment). If θa ̸= θb, on the average half of the results are the same, half
have opposite signs.
13.3.2. The only chance for the spy to remain invisible is that Alice and Bob
always ﬁnd the same results when they choose the same axis. For each pair
of spins, there is a probability 1/2 that they choose the same axis, and there
is in this case a probability 1/4 that they do not ﬁnd the same result if a
spy is operating (question 2.4(d)). Therefore, for each pair of spins, there is
a probability 1/8 that the spy is detected, and a probability 7/8 that the spy
remains invisible.
This may seem a quite ineﬃcient detection method. However, for a large
number of events, the probability (7/8)F N that the spy remains undetected
is very small. For FN = 200 one has (7/8)200 ≈2.5 × 10−12.
13.3.3. Quite surprisingly, as mentioned above, the spy does not gain any-
thing in ﬁnding out which x and z axes Alice and Bob have agreed on in step
1 of the procedure.
13.3.4. Experiment number 2. Measurements 8 and 12, where the axes are
the same, give opposite results: rush upon the spy!
In experiment number 1, however, measurements 1, 7 and 11 along the x axis
do give the same results and are consistent with the assumption that there is
no spy around. However, the number N = 3 is quite small in the present case.
If a spy is operating, the probability that he remains undetected is ≈40%.
13.3.5. Among the (1 −F)N remaining measurements, Alice selects a se-
quence of events where the axes are the same and which reproduces her mes-
sage. She communicates openly to Bob the labels of these events, and Bob
can (at last!) read the message on his own set of data.
In the present case, Alice tells Bob to look at the results # 8 and # 12, where
Bob can read (+, −).
Comment: This procedure is presently being developed in several industrial
research laboratories. In practice, one uses photon pairs with correlated po-
larizations rather than spin 1/2 particles.

tography, Scientiﬁc American, Vol. 267, p. 26 (October 1992).

Direct Observation of Field Quantization
We consider here a two-level atom interacting with a single mode of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld. When this mode is treated quantum mechanically, speciﬁc
features occur in the atomic dynamics, such as damping and revivals of the
Rabi oscillations.
14.1 Quantization of a Mode of the Electromagnetic
Field
We recall that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator of mass m and
frequency ω/2π obeys the equations of motion dx/dt = p/m and dp/dt =
−m ω2x where x is the position and p the momentum of the oscillator. Deﬁn-
ing the reduced variables X(t) = x(t)

mω/¯h and P(t) = p(t)/
√
¯hmω, the
equations of motion of the oscillator are
dX
dt = ωP
dP
dt = −ωX ,
(14.1)
and the total energy U(t) is given by
U(t) = ¯hω
2 (X2(t) + P 2(t)) .
(14.2)
14.1.1. Consider a cavity for electromagnetic waves, of volume V . Through-
out this chapter, we consider a single mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, of the
form
E(r, t) = ux e(t) sin kz
B(r, t) = uy b(t) cos kz ,
where ux, uy and uz are an orthonormal basis. We recall Maxwell’s equations
in vacuum:
∇· E(r, t) = 0
∇∧E(r, t) = −∂B(r, t)
∂t
∇· B(r, t) = 0
∇∧B(r, t) = 1

show that the equations for dχ/dt, dΠ/dt and U(t) in terms of χ, Π and
ω are formally identical to equations (14.1) and (14.2).
14.1.2. The quantization of the mode of the electromagnetic ﬁeld under con-
sideration is performed in the same way as that of an ordinary harmonic oscil-
lator. One associates to the physical quantities χ and Π, Hermitian operators
ˆχ and ˆΠ which satisfy the commutation relation
[ˆχ, ˆΠ] = i .
The Hamiltonian of the ﬁeld in the cavity is
ˆHC = ¯hω
2

ˆχ2 + ˆΠ2
.
The energy of the ﬁeld is quantized: En = (n + 1/2) ¯hω (n is a non-negative
integer); one denotes by |n⟩the eigenstate of ˆHC with eigenvalue En.
The quantum states of the ﬁeld in the cavity are linear combinations of the
set {|n⟩}. The state |0⟩, of energy E0 = ¯hω/2, is called the “vacuum”, and the
state |n⟩of energy En = E0 +n¯hω is called the “n photon state”. A “photon”
corresponds to an elementary excitation of the ﬁeld, of energy ¯hω.
One introduces the “creation” and “annihilation” operators of a photon as
ˆa† = (ˆχ −i ˆΠ)/
√
2 and ˆa = (ˆχ + i ˆΠ)/
√
2 respectively. These operators satisfy
the usual relations:
ˆa†|n⟩=
√
n + 1|n + 1⟩
ˆa|n⟩= √n|n −1⟩
if
n ̸= 0
and
ˆa|0⟩= 0 .
(a) Express ˆHC in terms of ˆa† and ˆa. The observable ˆN = ˆa†ˆa is called the
“number of photons”.

14.2 The Coupling of the Field with an Atom

The observables corresponding to the electric and magnetic ﬁelds at a
point r are deﬁned as:

The interpretation of the theory in terms of states and observables is the
same as in ordinary quantum mechanics.
(b) Calculate the expectation values ⟨E(r)⟩, ⟨B(r)⟩, and ⟨n| ˆHC|n⟩in an
n-photon state.

|α⟩= e−|α|2/2

(14.4)
where α is any complex number, is called a “quasi-classical” state of the ﬁeld.
(a) Show that |α⟩is a normalized eigenvector of the annihilation operator
ˆa and give the corresponding eigenvalue. Calculate the expectation value
⟨n⟩of the number of photons in that state.
(b) Show that if, at time t = 0, the state of the ﬁeld is |ψ(0)⟩= |α⟩, then,
at time t, |ψ(t)⟩= e−iωt/2|(αe−iωt)⟩.
(c) Calculate the expectation values ⟨E(r)⟩t and ⟨B(r)⟩t at time t in a
quasi-classical state for which α is real.
(d) Check that ⟨E(r)⟩t and ⟨B(r)⟩t satisfy Maxwell’s equations.
(e) Calculate the energy of a classical ﬁeld such that Ecl(r, t) = ⟨E(r)⟩t
and Bcl(r, t) = ⟨ˆB(r)⟩t. Compare the result with the expectation value
of ˆHC in the same quasi-classical state.
(f) Why do these results justify the name “quasi-classical” state for |α⟩if
|α| ≫1?
14.2 The Coupling of the Field with an Atom
Consider an atom at point r0 in the cavity. The motion of the center of mass
of the atom in space is treated classically. Hereafter we restrict ourselves to the
two-dimensional subspace of internal atomic states generated by the ground
state |f⟩and an excited state |e⟩. The origin of atomic energies is chosen
in such a way that the energies of |f⟩and |e⟩are respectively −¯hωA/2 and
+¯hωA/2 (ωA > 0). In the basis {|f⟩, |e⟩}, one can introduce the operators:
ˆσz =

that is to say ˆσ+|f⟩= |e⟩and ˆσ−|e⟩= |f⟩, and the atomic Hamiltonian can
be written as: ˆHA = −¯hωA

The set of orthonormal states {|f, n⟩, |e, n⟩, n ≥0} where |f, n⟩≡|f⟩⊗|n⟩
and |e, n⟩≡|e⟩⊗|n⟩forms a basis of the Hilbert space of the {atom+photons}
states.
14.2.1. Check that it is an eigenbasis of ˆH0 = ˆHA + ˆHC, and give the corre-
sponding eigenvalues.
14.2.2. In the remaining parts of the problem we assume that the frequency
of the cavity is exactly tuned to the Bohr frequency of the atom, i.e. ω = ωA.
Draw schematically the positions of the ﬁrst 5 energy levels of ˆH0. Show that,
except for the ground state, the eigenstates of ˆH0 are grouped in degenerate
pairs.
14.2.3. The Hamiltonian of the electric dipole coupling between the atom
and the ﬁeld can be written as:
ˆW = γ

ˆaˆσ+ + ˆa†ˆσ−

,
where γ = −d

¯hω/ϵ0V sin kz0, and where the electric dipole moment d is
determined experimentally.
(a) Write the action of ˆW on the states |f, n⟩and |e, n⟩.
(b) To which physical processes do ˆaˆσ+ and ˆa†ˆσ−correspond?
14.2.4. Determine the eigenstates of ˆH = ˆH0 + ˆW and the corresponding
energies. Show that the problem reduces to the diagonalization of a set of
2 × 2 matrices. One hereafter sets:

14.3 Interaction of the Atom with
an “Empty” Cavity
In the following, one assumes that the atom crosses the cavity along a line
where sin kz0 = 1.
An atom in the excited state |e⟩is sent into the cavity prepared in the
vacuum state |0⟩. At time t = 0 , when the atom enters the cavity, the state
of the system is |e, n = 0⟩.
14.3.1. What is the state of the system at a later time t?

14.4 Interaction of an Atom
with a Quasi-Classical State
135
14.3.2. What is the probability Pf(T) to ﬁnd the atom in the state f at time
T when the atom leaves the cavity? Show that Pf(T) is a periodic function
of T (T is varied by changing the velocity of the atom).
14.3.3. The experiment has been performed on rubidium atoms for a couple
of states (f, e) such that d = 1.1 × 10−26 C.m and ω/2π = 5.0 × 1010 Hz. The
volume of the cavity is 1.87 × 10−6 m3 (we recall that ϵ0 = 1/(36π109) S.I.).
The curve Pf(T), together with the real part of its Fourier transform
J(ν) =
 ∞
0
cos (2πνT) Pf(T) dT, are shown in Fig. 14.1. One observes a
damped oscillation, the damping being due to imperfections of the experi-
mental setup.
How do theory and experiment compare?
(We recall that the Fourier transform of a damped sinusoid in time exhibits a peak
at the frequency of this sinusoid, whose width is proportional to the inverse of the
characteristic damping time.)

14.4 Interaction of an Atom
with a Quasi-Classical State
The atom, initially in the state |e⟩, is now sent into a cavity where a quasi-
classical state |α⟩of the ﬁeld has been prepared. At time t = 0 the atom
enters the cavity and the state of the system is |e⟩⊗|α⟩.
14.4.1. Calculate the probability Pf(T, n) to ﬁnd, at time T, the atom in the
state |f⟩and the ﬁeld in the state |n + 1⟩, for n ≥0. What is the probability
to ﬁnd the atom in the state |f⟩and the ﬁeld in the state |0⟩?
14.4.2. Write the probability Pf(T) to ﬁnd the atom in the state |f⟩, inde-
pendently of the state of the ﬁeld, as an inﬁnite sum of oscillating functions.

14.4.3. On Fig. 14.2 are plotted an experimental measurement of Pf(T) and
the real part of its Fourier transform J(ν). The cavity used for this mea-
surement is the same as in Fig. 14.1, but the ﬁeld has been prepared in a
quasi-classical state before the atom is sent in.
(a) Determine the three frequencies ν0, ν1, ν2 which contribute most strongly
to Pf(T).
(b) Do the ratios ν1/ν0 and ν2/ν0 have the expected values?
(c) From the values J(ν0) and J(ν1), determine an approximate value for
the mean number of photons |α|2 in the cavity.

14.5 Large Numbers of Photons: Damping
and Revivals
Consider a quasi-classical state |α⟩of the ﬁeld corresponding to a large mean
number of photons: |α|2 ≃n0 ≫1, where n0 is an integer. In this case, the
probability π(n) to ﬁnd n photons can be cast, in good approximation, in the
form:
π(n) = e−|α|2 |α2n

n!

.
This Gaussian limit of the Poisson distribution can be obtained by using the
Stirling formula n! ∼nne−n√
2πn and expanding ln π(n) in the vicinity of
n = n0.
14.5.1. Show that this probability takes signiﬁcant values only if n lies in a
neighborhood δn of n0. Give the relative value δn/n0.
14.5.2. For such a quasi-classical state, one tries to evaluate the probability
Pf(T) of detecting the atom in the state f after its interaction with the ﬁeld.
In order to do this,

(b) Does this damping time depend on the mean value of the number of
photons n0?
(c) Give a qualitative explanation for this damping.
14.5.3. If one keeps the expression of Pf(T) as a discrete sum, an exact
numerical calculation shows that one expects a revival of the oscillations of
Pf(T)
for certain times TR large compared to TD, as shown in Fig. 14.3.
This phenomenon is called quantum revival and it is currently being studied
experimentally.
Keeping the discrete sum but using the approximation (14.5), can you
explain the revival qualitatively? How does the time of the ﬁrst revival depend
on n0?

Given the relation ϵ0µ0c2 = 1, we verify that ˙e(t) = c2kb(t) and ˙b = −ke(t).
Therefore the expectation values of the ﬁeld operators satisfy Maxwell’s equa-
tions.
(e) The energy of the classical ﬁeld can be calculated using the result of ques-
tion 1.1b. Since cos2 ωt + sin2 ωt = 1, we ﬁnd U(t) = ¯hωα2. This “classical”
energy is therefore time-independent. The expectation value of ˆHC is:
⟨HC⟩= ⟨¯hω(N + 1/2)⟩= ¯hω(α2 + 1/2) .
It is also time independent (Ehrenfest’s theorem).
(f) For |α| much larger than 1, the ratio U(t)/⟨HC⟩is close to 1. More
generally, the expectation value of a physical quantity as calculated for a
quantum ﬁeld in the state |α⟩, will be close to the value calculated for a
classical ﬁeld such that Ecl(r, t) = ⟨E(r)⟩t and Bcl(r, t) = ⟨B(r)⟩t.

The coupling under consideration corresponds to an electric dipole interaction
of the form −ˆD · ˆE(r), where ˆD is the observable electric dipole moment of
the atom.
(b)
ˆW couples the two states of each degenerate pair. The term ˆaˆσ+ corre-
sponds to the absorption of a photon by the atom, which undergoes a transi-
tion from the ground state to the excited state. The term ˆa†ˆσ−corresponds
to the emission of a photon by the atom, which undergoes a transition from
the excited state to the ground state.

•
In each eigen-subspace of ˆH0 generated by {|f, n + 1⟩, |e, n⟩} with n ≥0,
one must diagonalize the 2 × 2 matrix:

(a) The three most prominent peaks of J(ν) occur at the frequencies

(b) The ratios of the measured frequencies are very close to the theoretical
predictions: ν1/ν0 =
√
2 and ν2/ν0 =
√
3.
(c) The ratio J(ν1)/J(ν0) is of the order of 0.9. Assuming the peaks have
the same widths, and that these widths are small compared to the splitting
ν1 −ν0, this ratio correponds to the average number of photons |α|2 in the
cavity.
Actually, the peaks overlap, which makes this determination somewhat
inaccurate. If one performs a more sophisticated analysis, taking into account
the widths of the peaks, one obtains |α|2 = 0.85 ± 0.04 (see the reference at
end of this chapter).
Comment: One can also determine |α|2 from the ratio J(ν2)/J(ν1) which
should be equal to |α|2/2. However, the inaccuracy due to the overlap of the
peaks is greater than for J(ν1)/J(ν0), owing to the smallness of J(ν2).

is therefore peaked around n0.

(b) In this approximation, the oscillations are damped out in a time TD which
is independent of the number of photons n0. For a given atomic transition
(for ﬁxed values of d and ω), this time TD increases like the square root of
the volume of the cavity. In the limit of an inﬁnite cavity, i.e. an atom in
empty space, this damping time becomes inﬁnite: we recover the usual Rabi
oscillation. For a cavity of ﬁnite size, the number of visible oscillations of
Pf(T) is roughly νn0TD ∼√n0.

144
14 Direct Observation of Field Quantization
(c) The function Pf(T) is made up of a large number of oscillating functions
with similar frequencies. Initially, these diﬀerent functions are in phase, and
their sum Pf(T) exhibits marked oscillations. After a time TD, the various os-
cillations are no longer in phase with one another and the resulting oscillation
of Pf(T) is damped. One can ﬁnd the damping time by simply estimating
the time for which the two frequencies at half width on either side of the
maximum of π(n) are out of phase by π:
Ωn0+√n0TD ∼Ωn0−√n0TD + π
and

n0 ± √n0 ≃√n0 ± 1

⇒
Ω0TD ∼π .
14.5.3. Within the approximation (14.5) suggested in the text, equation
(14.6) above corresponds to a periodic evolution of period
TR = 4π

n0 + 1 .
Indeed

Ωn0 + Ω0
n −n0
2√n0 + 1

TR = 4π (n0 + 1) + 2π(n −n0) .
We therefore expect that all the oscillating functions which contribute to
Pf(T) will reset in phase at times TR, 2 TR,. . . The time of the ﬁrst revival,
measured in Fig. 14.3, is Ω0T ≃64, in excellent agreement with this predic-
tion. Notice that TR ∼4 √n0 TD, which means that the revival time is always
large compared to the damping time.
Actually, one can see from the result of Fig. 14.3 that the functions are
only partly in phase. This comes from the fact that the numerical calculation
has been done with the exact expression of Ωn. In this case, the diﬀerence
between two consecutive frequencies Ωn+1 −Ωn is not exactly a constant,
contrary to what happens in approximation (14.5); the function Pf(T) is not
really periodic. After a few revivals, one obtains a complicated behavior of
Pf(T), which can be analysed with the techniques developed for the study of
chaos.
14.7 Comments
The damping phenomenon which we have obtained above is “classical”: one
would obtain it within a classical description of the interaction of the ﬁeld
and the atom, by considering a ﬁeld whose intensity is not well deﬁned (this
would be the analog of a distribution π(n) of the number of photons). On the
other hand, the revival comes from the fact that the set of frequencies Ωn is
discrete. It is a direct consequence of the quantization of the electromagnetic

Ideal Quantum Measurement
In 1940, John von Neumann proposed a deﬁnition for an optimal, or “ideal”
measurement of a quantum physical quantity. In this chapter, we study a
practical example of such a procedure. Our ambition is to measure the exci-
tation number of a harmonic oscillator S by coupling it to another oscillator
D whose phase is measured.
We recall that, for k integer:

N+1 = N + 1
for k = p(N + 1), p integer ;

otherwise.
15.1 Preliminaries: a von Neumann Detector
We want to measure a physical quantity A on a quantum system S. We use
a detector D devised for such a measurement. There are two stages in the
measurement process. First, we let S and D interact. Then, after S and D
get separated and do not interact anymore, we read a result on the detector
D. We assume that D possesses an orthonormal set of states {|Di⟩} with
⟨Di|Dj⟩
= δi,j. These states correspond for instance to the set of values
which can be read on a digital display.
Let |ψ⟩be the state of the system S under consideration, and |D⟩the state
of the detector D. Before the measurement, the state of the global system
S + D is
|Ψi⟩= |ψ⟩⊗|D⟩.
Let ai and |φi⟩be the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenstates of the
observable ˆA. The state |ψ⟩of the system S can be expanded as
|ψ⟩=

i
αi|φi⟩.

p(ai) to ﬁnd the values ai in a measurement of the quantity A on this state?

We now observe the state of the detector. What is the probability to ﬁnd the
detector in the state |Dj⟩?
15.1.3. After this measurement, what is the state of the global system S+D?
15.1.4. A detector is called ideal if the choice of |D0⟩and of the coupling S–
D leads to coeﬃcients γij which, for any state |ψ⟩of S, verify: |γij| = δi,j |αj|.
Justify this designation.
15.2 Phase States of the Harmonic Oscillator
We consider a harmonic oscillator of angular frequency ω. We note ˆN the
“number” operator, i.e. the Hamiltonian is ˆH = ( ˆN + 1/2))¯hω with eigen-
states |N⟩and eigenvalues EN = (N + 1
2)¯hω, N integer ≥0.
Let s be a positive integer. The so-called “phase states” are the family of
states deﬁned at each time t by:
|θm⟩=

that the number of quanta N is bounded from above by some value s. The
sets {|N⟩, N = 0, 1, . . . , s} and {|θm⟩, m = 0, 1, . . . , s} are two bases in this
subspace. Express the vectors |N⟩in the basis of the phase states.
15.2.3. What is the probability to ﬁnd N quanta in a phase state |θm⟩?

15.3 The Interaction between the System
and the Detector
We want to perform an “ideal” measurement of the number of excitation
quanta of a harmonic oscillator. In order to do so, we couple this oscillator
S with another oscillator D, which is our detector. Both oscillators have the
same angular frequency ω. The eigenstates of ˆHS = (ˆn + 1
2)¯hω are noted
|n⟩, n = 0, 1, . . . , s, those of ˆHD = ( ˆN + 1
2)¯hω are noted |N⟩, N = 0, 1...s
where ˆn and ˆN are the number operators of S and D.
We assume that both numbers of quanta n and N are bounded from above
by s. The coupling between S and D has the form:
ˆV = ¯hg ˆn ˆN
(15.5)
This Hamiltonian is realistic. If the two oscillators are two modes of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld, it originates from the crossed Kerr eﬀect .
15.3.1. What are the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the total Hamiltonian
ˆH = ˆHS + ˆHD + ˆV
?
15.3.2. We assume that the initial state of the global system S + D is fac-
torized as:
|Ψ(0)⟩= |ψS⟩⊗|ψD⟩, with :

an|n⟩,
|ψD⟩=

where we assume that |ψS⟩and |ψD⟩are normalized. We perform a measure-
ment of ˆn in the state |Ψ(0)⟩. What results can one ﬁnd, with what probabil-
ities? Answer the same question for a measurement of ˆN.
15.3.3. During the time interval [0, t], we couple the two oscillators. The
coupling is switched oﬀat time t. What is the state |Ψ(t)⟩of the system? Is
it also a priori factorizable?
15.3.4. Is the probability law for the couple of random variables {n, N} af-
fected by the interaction? Why?

state |Ψ(t0)⟩of the system.
15.4.3. What is the probability to ﬁnd the value θk in a measurement of the
phase of the “detector” oscillator D?
15.4.4. After this measurement has been performed, what is the state of the
oscillator S? Describe qualitatively what will happen if one were to choose an
interaction time t ̸= t0.

consider this as an “ideal” quantum-measurement process?

15.4.4. After this measurement, the state of the oscillator S is simply |n⟩
(up to an arbitrary phase factor). In the state (15.8), the two systems are
perfectly correlated. To a phase state of D there corresponds only one state
of number of quanta of S. If one were to choose a time interval diﬀerent from
t0, this correlation would not be perfect. After a measurement of the phase of
D, the state of S would be a superposition of states with diﬀerent numbers of
quanta.
15.4.5. We see that this procedure, which supposes a well deﬁned interaction
time interval between the system and the detector, gives the value of the
probability p(n) = |an|2 that S is in a state with n quanta. In addition,
after one has read the result θn on the detector, one is sure that S is in
the state |n⟩, without having to further interact with it (reduction of the
wave packet). In this sense, this procedure does follow exactly the axioms of
quantum mechanics on measurement. It is therefore an “ideal” measurement
of a quantum physical quantity.

One can extend formally this result to other systems than harmonic oscilla-
tors. In practice, the case studied here is a simpliﬁcation of the concrete case
where the oscillators S and D are modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. The
Hamiltonian which is eﬀectively encountered in a optically non-linear crystal,
comes from the phenomenon called the crossed Kerr eﬀect . In an interferom-
eter, where D is a laser beam split in two parts by a semi-transparent mirror,
one can let the signal oscillator S interact with one of the beams. The mea-
surement consists in an interferometric measurement when the two beams of
D recombine.
This type of experiment has been carried out intensively in recent years. It
is also called a “non-destructive” quantum measurement (or QND measure-
ment). One can refer to the article by J.-P. Poizat and P. Grangier, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 70, 271 (1993).

The Quantum Eraser
This chapter deals with a quantum process where the superposition of two
probability amplitudes leads to an interference phenomenon. The two ampli-
tudes can be associated with two quantum paths, as in a double slit interfer-
ence experiment. We shall ﬁrst show that these interferences disappear if an
intermediate measurement gives information about which path has actually
been followed. Next, we shall see how interferences can actually reappear if
this information is “erased” by a quantum device.
We consider a beam of neutrons, which are particles of charge zero and spin
1/2, propagating along the x axis with velocity v. In all what follows, the mo-
tion of the neutrons in space is treated classically as a uniform linear motion.
Only the evolution of their spin states is treated quantum mechanically.
16.1 Magnetic Resonance
The eigenstates of the z component of the neutron spin are noted |n : +⟩and
|n : −⟩. A constant uniform magnetic ﬁeld B0 = B0 uz is applied along the
z axis (uz is the unit vector along the z axis). The magnetic moment of the
neutron is denoted ˆµn = γn ˆSn, where γn is the gyromagnetic ratio and ˆSn
the spin operator of the neutron.
16.1.1. What are the magnetic energy levels of a neutron in the presence of
the ﬁeld B0? Express the result in terms of ω0 = −γnB0.
16.1.2. The neutrons cross a cavity of length L between times t0 and t1 =
t0 + L/v. Inside this cavity, in addition to the constant ﬁeld B0, a rotating
ﬁeld B1(t) is applied. The ﬁeld B1(t) lies in the (x, y) plane and it has a
constant angular frequency ω:
B1(t) = B1(cos ωt ux + sin ωt uy) .
(16.1)
Let |ψn(t)⟩= α+(t)|n : +⟩+ α−(t)|n : −⟩be the neutron spin state at time t,
and consider a neutron entering the cavity at time t0.

(a) Write the equations of evolution for α±(t) when t0 ≤t ≤t1. We set
hereafter ω1 = −γnB1.
(b) Setting α±(t) = β±(t) exp[∓iω(t −t0)/2], show that the problem reduces
to a diﬀerential system with constant coeﬃcients.
(c) We assume that we are near the resonance: |ω−ω0| ≪ω1, and that terms
proportional to (ω −ω0) may be neglected in the previous equations.
Check that, within this approximation, one has, for t0 ≤t ≤t1,
β±(t) = β±(t0) cos θ −ie∓iωt0β∓(t0) sin θ ,
where θ = ω1(t −t0)/2.

16.2 Ramsey Fringes
The neutrons are initially in the spin state |n : −⟩. They successively cross
two identical cavities of the type described above. This is called Ramsey con-
ﬁguration and it is shown in Fig. 16.1. The same oscillating ﬁeld B1(t), given

by 16.1, is applied in both cavities. The modulus B1 of this ﬁeld is adjusted so
as to satisfy the condition φ = π/4. The constant ﬁeld B0 is applied through-
out the experimental setup. At the end of this setup, one measures the number
of outgoing neutrons which have ﬂipped their spin and are in the ﬁnal state
|n : +⟩. This is done for several values of ω in the vicinity of ω = ω0.
16.2.1. At time t0, a neutron enters the ﬁrst cavity in the state |n : −⟩. What
is its spin state, and what is the probability to ﬁnd it in the state |n : +⟩,
when it leaves the cavity?
16.2.2. The same neutron enters the second cavity at time t′
0 = t1 + T, with
T = D/v where D is the distance between the two cavities. Between the two
cavities the spin precesses freely around B0. What is the spin state of the
neutron at time t′
0?
16.2.3. Let t′
1 be the time when the neutron leaves the second cavity: t′

16.2.4. Calculate the probability P+ of detecting the neutron in the state |n :
+⟩after the second cavity. Show that it is an oscillating function of (ω0−ω)T.
Explain why this result can be interpreted as an interference process.
16.2.5. In practice, the velocities of the neutrons have some dispersion
around the mean value v. This results in a dispersion in the time T to get
from one cavity to the other. A typical experimental result giving the inten-
sity of the outgoing beam in the state |n : +⟩as a function of the frequency
ν = ω/2π of the rotating ﬁeld B1 is shown in Fig. 16.2.

(c) Which optical interference experiment is the result reminiscent of?
16.2.6. Suppose one inserts between the two cavities of Fig. 16.1 a device
which can measure the z component of the neutron spin (the principle of such
a detector is presented in the next section). Determine the probability P+,+
of detecting the neutron in the state |n : +⟩between the two cavities and in
the state |n : +⟩when it leaves the second cavity, and the probability P−,+
of detecting the neutron in the state |n : −⟩between the cavities and in the
state |n : +⟩when it leaves the second cavity. Check that one does not have
P+ = P+,+ + P−,+ and comment on this fact.
16.3 Detection of the Neutron Spin State
In order to measure the spin of a neutron, one lets it interact during a time
τ with a spin 1/2 atom at rest. The atom’s spin operator is ˆSa. Let |a : ±⟩
be the two eigenstates of the observable ˆSaz. After the interaction between
the neutron and the atom, one measures the spin of the atom. Under certain
conditions, as we shall see, one can deduce the spin state of the neutron after
this measurement.
16.3.1. Spin States of the Atom.
Let |a : ±x⟩be the eigenstates of ˆSax and |a : ±y⟩those of ˆSay. Write
|a : ±x⟩and |a : ±y⟩in the basis {|a : +⟩, |a : −⟩}. Express |a : ±y⟩in terms
of |a : ±x⟩.
16.3.2. We assume that the neutron–atom interaction does not aﬀect the
neutron’s trajectory. We represent the interaction between the neutron and
the atom by a very simple model. This interaction is assumed to last a ﬁnite
time τ during which the neutron–atom interaction Hamiltonian has the form
ˆV = 2A
¯h
ˆSnz ⊗ˆSax ,
(16.4)
where A is a constant. We neglect the action of any external ﬁeld, including
B0, during the time τ.
Explain why ˆSnz and ˆV commute. Give their common eigenstates and the
corresponding eigenvalues.

16.3.3. We hereafter assume that the interaction time τ is adjusted in such
a way that
Aτ = π/2 .
Suppose the initial state of the system is
|ψ(0)⟩= |n : +⟩⊗|a : +y⟩.
Calculate the ﬁnal state of the system |ψ(τ)⟩. Answer the same question if
the initial state is |ψ(0)⟩= |n : −⟩⊗|a : +y⟩.
16.3.4. We now suppose that the initial spin state is
|ψ(0)⟩= (α+|n : +⟩+ α−|n : −⟩) ⊗|a : +y⟩.
After the neutron–atom interaction described above, one measures the z com-
ponent Saz of the atom’s spin.
(a) What results can one ﬁnd, and with what probabilities?
(b) After this measurement, what prediction can one make about the value
of the z component of the neutron spin? Is it necessary to let the neutron
interact with another measuring apparatus in order to know Snz once the
value of Saz is known?
16.4 A Quantum Eraser
We have seen above that if one measures the spin state of the neutron between
the two cavities, the interference signal disappears. In this section, we will
show that it is possible to recover an interference if the information left by
the neutron on the detecting atom is “erased” by an appropriate measurement.
A neutron, initially in the spin state |n : −⟩, is sent into the two-cavity
system. Immediately after the ﬁrst cavity, there is a detecting atom of the
type discussed above, prepared in the spin state |a : +y⟩. By assumption, the
spin state of the atom evolves only during the time interval τ when it interacts
with the neutron.
16.4.1. Write the spin state of the neutron–atom system when the neutron
is:
(a) just leaving the ﬁrst cavity (time t1), before interacting with the atom;
(b) just after the interaction with the atom (time t1 + τ);
(c) entering the second cavity (time t′
0);
(d) just leaving the second cavity ( time t′
1).
16.4.2. What is the probability to ﬁnd the neutron in the state |n : +⟩at
time t′
1? Does this probability reﬂect an interference phenomenon? Interpret
the result.

160
16 The Quantum Eraser
16.4.3. At time t′
1, Bob measures the z component of the neutron spin and
Alice measures the y component of the atom’s spin. Assume both measure-
ments give +¯h/2. Show that the corresponding probability reﬂects an inter-
ference phenomenon.
16.4.4. Is this result compatible with the conclusion of question 4.2?
16.4.5. In your opinion, which of the following three statements are appro-
priate, and for what reasons?
(a) When Alice performs a measurement on the atom, Bob sees at once an
interference appear in the signal he is measuring on the neutron.
(b) Knowing the result obtained by Alice on each event, Bob can select a
subsample of his own events which displays an interference phenomenon.
(c) The experiment corresponds to an interference between two quantum
paths for the neutron spin. By restoring the initial state of the atom,
the measurement done by Alice erases the information concerning which
quantum path is followed by the neutron spin, and allows interferences
to reappear.
16.4.6. Alice now measures the component of the atom’s spin along an ar-
bitrary axis deﬁned by the unit vector w. Show that the contrast of the
interferences varies proportionally to | sin η|, where cos η = w.uz. Interpret
the result.

Therefore, the probability that the neutron spin has ﬂipped in the two-cavity
system is
P+ = |α+(t′

.
With the approximation of Sect. 1.2c, the probability for a spin ﬂip in a
single cavity is independent of ω, and is equal to 1/2. In contrast, the present
result for two cavities exhibits a strong modulation of the spin ﬂip probability,
between 1 (e.g. for ω = ω0) and 0 (e.g. for (ω −ω0)T = π). This modulation
results from an interference process of the two quantum paths corresponding
respectively to:
•
a spin ﬂip in the ﬁrst cavity, and no ﬂip in the second one,
•
no ﬂip in the ﬁrst cavity and a spin ﬂip in the second one.
Each of these paths has a probability 1/2, so that the sum of the probability
amplitudes (16.6) is fully modulated.

This form agrees with the observed variation in ω of the experimental signal.
The central maximum, which is located at ω/2π = 748.8 kHz corresponds
to ω = ω0. For that value, a constructive interference appears whatever the
neutron velocity. The lateral maxima and minima are less peaked, however,
since the position of a lateral peak is velocity dependent. The ﬁrst two lat-
eral maxima correspond to (ω −ω0)T0 ≃±2π. Their amplitude is reduced,
compared to the central peak, by a factor exp(−2π2τ 2/T 2
0 ).
(b) The angular frequency ω0 is related to the magnetic moment of the
neutron by ¯hω0 = 2µnB0 which leads to µn = 9.65 × 10−27 J T−1. The time
T0 can be deduced from the spacing between the central maximum and a

16.5 Solutions
163
lateral one. The ﬁrst lateral maximum occurs at 0.77 kHz from the resonance,
hence T0 = 1.3 ms. This corresponds to an average velocity v0 = 1230 m s−1.
The ratio of intensities between the second lateral maximum and the central
one is roughly 0.55. This is approximately equal to exp(−8π2τ 2/T 2
0 ), and gives
τ/T0 ≈0.087, and δv ≈110 m s−1.
(c) This experiment can be compared to a Young double slit interference
experiment with polychromatic light.The central fringe (corresponding to the
peak at ω = ω0) remains bright, but the contrast of the interferences de-
creases rapidly as one departs from the center. In fact, the maxima for some
frequencies correspond to minima for others.
16.2.6. The probability P++ is the product of the two probabilities: the prob-
ability to ﬁnd the neutron in the state |n : +⟩when it leaves the ﬁrst cavity
(p = 1/2) and, knowing that it is in the state |n : +⟩, the probability to ﬁnd
it in the same state when it leaves the second cavity (p = 1/2); this gives
P+,+ = 1/4. Similarly P−,+ = 1/4. The sum P+,+ + P−,+ = 1/2 does not
display any interference, since one has measured in which cavity the neutron
spin has ﬂipped. This is very similar to an electron double-slit interference
experiment if one measures which slit the electron goes through.

and these states are related to one another by
|a : ±y⟩= 1
2 ((1 ± i)|a : +x⟩+ (1 ∓i)|a : −x⟩) .
16.3.2. The operators ˆSnz and ˆSax commute since they act in two diﬀerent
Hilbert spaces; therefore [ ˆSnz, ˆV ] = 0.
The common eigenvectors of ˆSnz and ˆV , and the corresponding eigenvalues
are
|n : +⟩⊗|a : ±x⟩
Snz = +¯h/2
V = ±A¯h/2 ,
|n : −⟩⊗|a : ±x⟩
Snz = −¯h/2
V = ∓A¯h/2 .
The operators ˆSnz and ˆV form a complete set of commuting operators as far
as spin variables are concerned.
16.3.3. Expanding in terms of the energy eigenstates, one obtains for |ψ(0)⟩=

2|n : +⟩⊗(|a : +x⟩+ |a : −x⟩)
= |n : +⟩⊗|a : +⟩.
Similarly, if |ψ(0)⟩= |n : −⟩⊗|a : +y⟩, then |ψ(τ)⟩= i|n : −⟩⊗|a : −⟩.
Physically, this means that the neutron’s spin state does not change since it
is an eigenstate of ˆV , while the atom’s spin precesses around the x axis with
angular frequency A. At time τ = π/(2A), it lies along the z axis.
16.3.4. If the initial state is |ψ(0)⟩= (α+|n : +⟩+ α−|n : −⟩) ⊗|a : +y⟩, the
state after the interaction is
|ψ(τ)⟩= α+|n : +⟩⊗|a : +⟩+ iα−|n : −⟩⊗|a : −⟩.
The measurement of the z component of the atom’s spin gives +¯h/2, with
probability |α+|2 and state |n : +⟩⊗|a : +⟩after the measurement, or −¯h/2
with probability |α−|2 and state |n : −⟩⊗|a : −⟩after the measurement.
In both cases, after measuring the z component of the atom’s spin, the
neutron spin state is known: it is the same as that of the measured atom. It is
not necessary to let the neutron interact with another measuring apparatus
in order to know the value of Snz.

probabilities for ﬁnding:

16.5 Solutions
165
(a) the neutron in state + and the atom in state +, i.e. the square of the
modulus of the coeﬃcient of |n : +⟩⊗|a : +⟩(1/4 in the present case),
(b) the neutron in state + and the atom in state −(probability 1/4 again).
One gets therefore P+ = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2: There are no interferences since
the quantum path leading in the end to a spin ﬂip of the neutron can be
determined from the state of the atom.
16.4.3. One can expand the vectors |a : ±⟩on |a : ±y⟩:
|ψf⟩=

The probability amplitude that Bob ﬁnds +¯h/2 along the z axis while Alice
ﬁnds +¯h/2 along the y axis is the coeﬃcient of the term |n : +⟩⊗|a : +y⟩in
the above expansion. Equivalently, the probability is obtained by projecting
the state onto |n : +⟩⊗|a : +y⟩, and squaring. One obtains

which clearly exhibits a modulation reﬂecting an interference phenomenon.

which is also modulated.
16.4.4. This result is compatible with the result 4.2. Indeed the sum of the
two probabilities calculated above is 1/2 as in 4.2. If Bob does not know the
result found by Alice, or if Alice does not perform a measurement, which is
equivalent from his point of view, Bob sees no interferences. The interferences
only arise for the joint probability P(Snz, Say).
16.4.5.
(a) This ﬁrst statement is obviously wrong. As seen in question 4.2,
if the atom A is present, Bob no longer sees oscillations (in ω −ω0) of the
probability for detecting the neutron in the state |+⟩. This probability is equal
to 1/2 whatever Alice does. Notice that if the statement were correct, this
would imply instantaneous transmission of information from Alice to Bob.
By seeing interferences appear, Bob would know immediately that Alice is
performing an experiment, even though she may be very far away.

166
16 The Quantum Eraser
(b) This second statement is correct. If Alice and Bob put together all
their results, and if they select the subsample of events for which Alice ﬁnds
+¯h/2, then the number of events for which Bob also ﬁnds +¯h/2 varies like
cos2((ω −ω0)T/2); they recover interferences for this subset of events. In the
complementary set, where Alice has found −¯h/2, the number of Bob’s re-
sults giving +¯h/2 varies like sin2((ω −ω0)T/2). This search for correlations
between events occurring in diﬀerent detectors is a common procedure, in
particle physics for instance.
(c) This third statement, although less precise but more picturesque than
the previous one, is nevertheless acceptable. The cos2((ω −ω0)T/2) signal
found in Sect. 2 can be interpreted as the interference of the amplitudes cor-
responding to two quantum paths for the neutron spin which is initially in
the state |n : −⟩; either its spin ﬂips in the ﬁrst cavity, or it ﬂips in the
second one. If there exists a possibility to determine which quantum path is
followed by the system, interferences cannot appear. It is necessary to “erase”
this information, which is carried by the atom, in order to observe “some”
interferences. After Alice has measured the atom’s spin along the y axis, she
has, in some sense “restored” the initial state of the system, and this enables
Bob to see some interferences. It is questionable to say that information has
been erased: one may feel that, on the contrary, extra information has been
acquired. Notice that the statement in the text does not specify in which
physical quantity the interferences appear. Notice also that the order of the
measurements made by Alice and Bob has no importance, contrary to what
this third statement seems to imply.
16.4.6. Alice can measure along the axis w = sin η uy +cos η uz, in the (y, z)
plane, for instance. Projecting |ψf⟩onto the eigenstate of ˆSaw with eigenvalue
+¯h/2, i.e. cos(η/2) |a : +⟩+i sin(η/2) |a : −⟩, a calculation similar to 4.3 leads
to a probability

/2. If η = 0 or π (measurement
along the z axis) there are no interferences. For η = π/2 and 3π/2 or, more
generally, if Alice measures in the (x, y) plane, the contrast of the interferences,
| sin η|, is maximum.

Ramsey Fringes with Neutrons. The experimental curve given in the text
is taken from J.H. Smith et al., Phys. Rev. 108, 120 (1957). Since then, the
technique of Ramsey fringes has been considerably improved. Nowadays one
proceeds diﬀerently. One stores neutrons in a “bottle” for a time of the order
of 100 s and applies two radiofrequency pulses at the begining and at the end
of the storage. The elapsed time between the two pulses is 70 s, compared to
1.3 ms here. This improves enormously the accuracy of the frequency measure-
ment. Such experiments are actually devised to measure the electric dipole
moment of the neutron, of fundamental interest in relation to time-reversal

A Quantum Thermometer
We study here the measurement of the cyclotron motion of an electron. The
particle is conﬁned in a Penning trap and it is coupled to the thermal radiation
which causes quantum transitions of the system between various energy levels.
In all the chapter, we neglect spin eﬀects. The method and results come from
an experiment performed at Harvard University in 1999.
We consider an electron of mass M and charge q (q < 0), conﬁned in a
Penning trap. This trap consists in the superposition of a uniform magnetic
ﬁeld B = Bez (B > 0) and an electric ﬁeld which derives from the potential
Φ(r) whose power expansion near the origin is:
Φ(r) = Mω2
z
4q

2z2 −x2 −y2
.
(17.1)
The positive quantity ωz has the dimension of an angular frequency. In all this
chapter we set ωc = |q|B/M (ωc is called the cyclotron angular frequency)
and we assume that ωz ≪ωc.
Useful constants: M = 9.1 10−31 kg ; q = −1.6 10−19 C; h = 6.63 10−34 J s;
Boltzmann’s constant kB = 1.38 10−23 J K−1.
17.1 The Penning Trap in Classical Mechanics
We recall that the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle moving in an
electromagnetic ﬁeld is F = q(E + v × B).
17.1.1. Check that Φ(r) satisﬁes the Laplace equation ∆Φ = 0. What is the
shape of a surface of constant potential Φ(r) =Const?
17.1.2. Show that the classical equation of motion of the electron in the trap
is:
¨x + ωc ˙y −ω2
z
2 x = 0
¨y −ωc ˙x −ω2
z
2 y = 0
¨z + ω2

17.1.3. What is the type of motion along the z axis?
17.1.4. In order to study the component of the motion in the xy plane, we
set α = x + iy.
(a) What is the diﬀerential equation satisﬁed by α(t)?
(b) We seek a solution of this equation of the form α(t) = α0 eiωt. Show that
ω is a solution of the equation:
ω2 −ωcω + ω2
z
2 = 0 .
(c) We note ωr and ωl the two roots of this equation with ωr > ωl. Show
that:
ωr ≃ωc
ωl ≃ω2
z
2ωc
.
17.1.5. We consider the values B = 5.3 T and ωz/(2π) = 64 MHz.
(a) Show that the most general motion of the electron in the Penning trap
is the superposition of three harmonic oscillator motions.
(b) Calculate the frequencies of these motions.
(c) Draw the projection on the xy plane of the classical trajectory of the
trapped electron, assuming that αr ≪αl (the positive quantities αr and
αl represent the amplitudes of the motions of angular frequencies ωr
and ωl).
17.2 The Penning Trap in Quantum Mechanics
We note ˆr and ˆp the position and momentum operators of the electron. The
Hamiltonian of the electron in the Penning trap is, neglecting spin eﬀects:
ˆH =
1
2M (ˆp −qA(ˆr))2 + qΦ(ˆr) ,
where the electrostatic potential Φ(r) is given by (17.1). For the magnetic
vector potential, we choose the form A(r) = B × r/2.
17.2.1. Expand the Hamiltonian and show that it can be written as ˆH =
ˆHxy + ˆHz, where ˆHxy only involves the operators ˆx, ˆy, ˆpx and ˆpy, while ˆHz
only involves the operators ˆz and ˆpz.
Do ˆHxy and ˆHz possess a common eigenbasis?
17.2.2. We are now interested in the motion along the z axis. This is called
the axial motion. Recall without giving any proof:
(a) the expression of the operators ˆaz and ˆa†
z which allow to write ˆHz in the
form ˆHz = ¯hωz ( ˆNz + 1/2) with ˆNz = ˆa†
zˆaz and [ˆaz, ˆa†
z] = 1;
(b) the eigenvalues of ˆNz and ˆHz.

17.2 The Penning Trap in Quantum Mechanics
171
17.2.3. We now consider the motion in the xy plane under the eﬀect of the
Hamiltonian ˆHxy. We set Ω=

ω2c −2ω2z /2. We introduce the right and left
annihilation operators ˆar and ˆal:
ˆar =
	
MΩ
4¯h (ˆx −iˆy) +
i
√
4¯hMΩ
(ˆpx −iˆpy)
ˆal =
	
MΩ
4¯h (ˆx + iˆy) +
i
√
4¯hMΩ
(ˆpx + iˆpy) .
(a) Show that [ˆar, ˆa†
r] = [ˆal, ˆa†
l ] = 1.
(b) Show that any left operator commutes with any right operator, i.e.:
[ˆar, ˆal] = 0
[ˆar, ˆa†
l ] = 0
[ˆa†
r, ˆal] = 0
[ˆa†
r, ˆa†
l ] = 0 .
(c) Recall the eigenvalues of ˆnr = ˆa†
rˆar and ˆnl = ˆa†
l ˆal (no proof is required).
Do ˆnr and ˆnl possess a common eigenbasis?
(d) Show that the Hamiltonian ˆHxy can be written as:
ˆHxy = ¯hωr (ˆnr + 1/2) −¯hωl (ˆnl + 1/2) ,
where the angular frequencies ωr and ωl have been introduced in Sect.
17.1.
(e) Deduce from this the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian ˆHxy.
17.2.4. We note |ψ(t)⟩the state of the system at time t and we deﬁne
ar(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|ˆar|ψ(t)⟩and al(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|ˆal|ψ(t)⟩. Using the Ehrenfest the-
orem, calculate dar/dt and dal/dt.
Integrate these equations and calculate the expectation value of the elec-
tron’s position (⟨x⟩(t), ⟨y⟩(t)) in the xy plane. We set ar(0) = ρr e−iφr and
al(0) = ρl eiφl, where ρr and ρl are real and positive.
Show that the time evolution of the expectation value of the electron po-
sition ⟨r⟩(t) is similar to the classical evolution found in Sect. 17.1.
17.2.5. We note |φ0⟩the eigenstate of ˆH corresponding to the eigenvalues 0
for each of the operators ˆnr, ˆnl and ˆNz.
(a) Determine the corresponding wave function φ0(r) (it is not necessary to
normalize the result).
(b) Using the same numerical values as in question 17.1.5, evaluate the spa-
tial extension of φ0(r).
17.2.6. The experiment is performed at temperatures T ranging between
0.1 K and 4 K. Compare the characteristic thermal energy kBT to each of the
energy quanta of the “cyclotron”, “axial” and “magnetron” motions (associ-
ated respectively with ˆnr, ˆNz and ˆnl). For which of these motions does the
discrete nature of the energy spectrum play an important role?

172
17 A Quantum Thermometer
17.3 Coupling of the Cyclotron and Axial Motions
We now study a method for detecting the cyclotron motion. This method uses
a small coupling between this motion and the axial motion. The coupling is
produced by an inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, and it can be described by the
additional term in the Hamiltonian:
ˆW = ϵ
2Mω2
z ˆnr ˆz2 .
The experimental conditions are chosen such that ϵ = 4 × 10−7.
17.3.1. Write the total Hamiltonian ˆHc = ˆH + ˆW using the operators ˆnr,
ˆnl, ˆpz and ˆz.
17.3.2. Show that the excitation numbers of the cyclotron motion (ˆnr) and
of the magnetron motion (ˆnl) are constants of the motion.
17.3.3. Consider the eigensubspace Enr,nl of ˆnr and ˆnl, corresponding to the
eigenvalues nr and nl.
(a) Write the form of ˆHc in this subspace.
(b) Show that the axial motion is harmonic if the system is prepared in a
state belonging to Enr,nl. Give its frequency in terms of nr and nl.
(c) Give the eigenvalues and eigenstates of ˆHc inside Enr,nl.
17.3.4. Deduce from the previous question that the eigenstates of ˆHc can be
labeled by 3 quantum numbers, nr, nl, nz. We write these states as |nr, nl, nz⟩.
Give the energy eigenvalues in terms of these quantum numbers and of ωr,
ωl, ωz and ϵ.
17.3.5. One measures the beat between a highly stable oscillator of frequency
ωz/(2π) (delivering a signal proportional to sin(ωzt)) and the current induced
in an electric circuit by the axial motion. This latter current is proportional
to ⟨pz⟩(t).
(a) Calculate the time evolution of the expectation values of the position and
momentum operators ˆz and ˆpz assuming that the state of the electron is
restricted to be in the subspace Enr,nl. We choose the initial conditions
⟨ˆz⟩(t = 0) = z0 and ⟨ˆpz⟩(t = 0) = 0.
(b) To ﬁrst order in ϵ, what is the phase diﬀerence ϕ between the detected
current and the stable oscillator after a time τ? Show that the measure-
ment of this phase diﬀerence provides a measurement of the excitation
number of the cyclotron motion.
17.3.6. We now assume that the electron is in an arbitrary state
|Ψ⟩=

nr,nl,nz
cnr,nl,nz|nr, nl, nz⟩.
(a) We measure the phase diﬀerence ϕ on a time interval ranging from t = 0
to t = τ. What are the possible results ϕk of the measurement? Show that

17.4 A Quantum Thermometer
173
this provides a means to determine the excitation number of the cyclotron
motion.
(b) What is the state of the electron after a measurement giving the result
ϕk ?
(c) We choose τ = 0.1 s and we assume that the measurement of ϕ is done with
an accuracy of π/10. Using the previous values of the physical parameters,
show that this accuracy leads to an unambiguous determination of the
cyclotron excitation number.
(d) After a measurement giving the result ϕk, we let the system evolve for a
length of time T under the action of the Hamiltonian ˆHc. We then perform
a new measurement of ϕ. What results do we expect?
17.4 A Quantum Thermometer
In practice, the cyclotron motion is in thermal equilibrium with a thermostat
at temperature T. We recall that, in that situation, the thermal ﬂuctuations
can excite the system in an energy level En with some probability pn.
We perform successive measurements of the phase diﬀerence ϕ in the time
intervals [0, τ], [τ, 2τ], . . ., [(N −1)τ, Nτ]. The total duration Nτ of this series
of measurements for a given temperature T is Nτ = 3000 seconds, i.e. a total
number of results N = 3×104 for τ = 0.1 s. By this procedure, one can follow
the variation of nr during the time interval Nτ, with a time resolution of τ.
17.4.1. Two recordings of this measurement are represented on ﬁgure 17.1
for two diﬀerent temperatures. Comment on these results and explain in par-
ticular:
(a) to what phenomenon are associated the sudden changes of the signal;
(b) what is the fraction of the time during which the electron is in the levels
nr = 0, nr = 1, nr = 2, . . . (the accuracy of a usual graduated ruler is
suﬃcient).
17.4.2. The probability pn for a system to be in the energy level En is given
by the Boltzmann factor pn = N exp(−En/kBT), where N is a normalization
factor. Show that for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator the ratio pn+1/pn
does not depend on n.
17.4.3. Give an estimate of the two temperatures corresponding to the two
recordings of Fig. 17.1.
17.4.4. Fig. 17.2 represents more accurate measurements of the occupation
probabilities of the various cyclotron levels for several temperatures of the
cryostat which contains the Penning trap.
(a) Determine the normalization factor N of the probability law pn for a
one-dimensional harmonic oscillator of angular frequency ω in thermal
equilibrium with a thermostat at temperature T, and calculate the average
excitation number ¯n. It is convenient to set γ = ¯hω/(kBT).

17.1.5.
(a) We have seen previously that the motion along z is harmonic
of angular frequency ωz. In order to obtain the motion in the xy plane, we
integrate the equation of motion of α:
α(t) = αl ei(ωlt+φl) + αr ei(ωrt+φr) ,
where αl and αr are two positive real numbers, and φl and φr are two a priori
arbitrary phases. This gives the forms of x(t) and y(t) by taking the real and
imaginary parts of this expression:

176
17 A Quantum Thermometer
x(t) = αl cos(ωlt + φl) + αr cos(ωrt + φr)
y(t) = αl sin(ωlt + φl) + αr sin(ωrt + φr) .
The motion in the xy plane is a superposition of two harmonic motions of
angular frequencies ωr and ωl.
(b) One ﬁnds ωc/2π = 1.48 × 1011 Hz. The frequencies of the three motions
are therefore:
ωl/2π ≃14 kHz
ωz/2π = 64 MHz
ωr/2π ≃150 GHz
(c) The motion in the xy plane is the superposition of two circular motions,
one is of radius αr and has a high frequency (ωr), and the other is of radius
αl and has a much lower frequency (ωl). Assuming αr ≪αl, this results in a
trajectory of the type represented on the following ﬁgure
Section 17.2:
The Penning Trap in Quantum Mechanics

where we have introduced the z component of the angular momentum ˆLz =
ˆxˆpy −ˆyˆpx. Since ˆHxy involves only the operators ˆx, ˆy and ˆpx, ˆpy, and since
ˆHz only involves ˆz, ˆpz, the two operators ˆHxy and ˆHz commute, and each of
them commutes with the total Hamiltonian ˆH:
[ ˆHxy, ˆHz] = 0
[ ˆHxy, ˆH] = 0
[ ˆHz, ˆH] = 0 .
We can therefore search for an eigenbasis of ˆH in the form of a common
eigenbasis of ˆHxy and ˆHz.
17.2.2.
(a) The Hamiltonian ˆHz corresponds to a harmonic motion of an-
gular frequency ωz. Setting
ˆaz =
	
Mωz
2¯h ˆx + i
ˆp
√2M¯hωz
and
ˆNz = ˆa†
zˆaz ,
one easily ﬁnds its spectrum since the Hamiltonian can be written as ˆHz =
¯hωz( ˆNz + 1/2).

17.5 Solutions
177
(b) From the commutation relation [ˆaz, ˆa†
z] = 1, we deduce that the eigenval-
ues of ˆNz are the non-negative integers nz. The eigenvalues of ˆHz are therefore
of the form ¯hωz(nz + 1/2).
17.2.3. We ﬁrst calculate the generic commutator:
C =

4¯h (ˆx −iηˆy) + ξ

4¯hMΩ
(ˆpx −iηˆpy) ,

√
4¯hMΩ
(ˆpx + iη′ˆpy)

where the four numbers η, ξ, η′ and ξ′ are equal to ±1. Using [ˆx, ˆpx] = [ˆy, ˆpy] =
i¯h, one ﬁnds:
C = 1
4 (ξ + ξ′) (1 + ηη′) .
(a) The commutator [ˆar, ˆa†
r] corresponds to η = η′ = +1 and ξ = ξ′ = 1,
therefore [ˆar, ˆa†
r] = 1. Similarly, one obtains [ˆal, ˆa†
l ] = 1 from η = η′ = −1 and
ξ = ξ′ = 1.
(b) The commutator [ˆar, ˆal] corresponds to ξ = 1 and ξ′ = −1, hence
[ˆar, ˆal] = 0. Similarly, [ˆar, ˆa†
l ] vanishes since it corresponds to η = −η′ = 1.
Therefore the other commutators ([ˆa†
r, ˆal] and [ˆa†
r, ˆa†
l ]) also vanish if we take
the Hermitian conjugates of the previous commutators.
(c) The commutation relation [ˆar, ˆa†
r] = 1 results in the fact that the eigen-
values of ˆnr are the non-negative integers, and the same holds for ˆnl.
(d) The operators ˆnr and ˆnl are expanded as:
ˆnr,l = ˆp2
x + ˆp2
y
4¯hMΩ+ MΩ
4¯h (ˆx2 + ˆy2) −1

where the + (resp.−) sign corresponds to ˆnr (resp. ˆnl). The sum and diﬀerence
of the roots of the equation ω2 −ωcω + ω2
z/2 = 0 are:
ωr + ωl = ωc
ωr −ωl =

ω2c −2ω2z = 2Ω.
We obtain the anticipated result:
ˆHxy = ¯hωr (ˆnr + 1/2) −¯hωl (ˆnl + 1/2)
(e) The eigenvectors of
ˆHxy can therefore be labeled by the two (non-
negative) integer quantum numbers nr and nl corresponding to the eigenvalues
of ˆnr and ˆnl. The corresponding eigenstates are noted |nr, nl⟩. The eigenvalue
of ˆHxy associated to the vector |nr, nl⟩is ¯hωr(nr + 1/2) −¯hωl(nl + 1/2).
17.2.4. We have:
[ˆar, ˆH] = ¯hωr [ˆar, ˆa†
rˆar] = ¯hωr ˆar .

178

Owing to Ehrenfest theorem we therefore ﬁnd: ˙ar = −iωrar and ˙al = +iωlal.
The solutions of these two equations are:
ar(t) = ar(0) e−iωrt
al(t) = al(0) e+iωlt
The expectation value of the position in the xy plane can be calculated by
using:
ar+al =
	
MΩ

i
√
¯hMΩ
⟨px⟩
i(ar−al) =
	
MΩ
¯h
⟨y⟩+

¯hMΩ
⟨py⟩.
In other words:
⟨x⟩(t) =
	
¯h
MΩRe (ar(t) + al(t))
⟨y⟩(t) =
	
¯h
MΩRe (iar(t) −ial(t)) .
Setting ar(0) = ρr e−iφr and al(0) = ρl eiφl, we obtain:
⟨x⟩(t) =
	
¯h
MΩ(ρr cos(ωrt + φr) + ρl cos(ωlt + φl))
⟨y⟩(t) =
	
¯h
MΩ(ρr sin(ωrt + φr) + ρl sin(ωlt + φl))
As in the classical motion, the coordinates ⟨x⟩and ⟨y⟩are the sums of two
sinusoidal functions of angular frequencies ωr and ωl. The x and y components
have equal amplitudes and are phase shifted by π/2 with respect to each
other. The average motion in the xy plane is therefore the superposition of
two uniform circular motions of angular frequencies ωr and ωl. The trajectory
is the same as in question 1.5.
17.2.5.
(a) The wave function φ0(r) corresponding to nr = nl = nz = 0
can be written as the product of three functions in the variables x+iy, x−iy
and z. This function must satisfy ˆaµφ0(r) = 0, with µ = r, l, z. Therefore,
setting η = + and η = −for ˆar and ˆal respectively:

 ∂
∂x −iη ∂
∂y + MΩ
¯h (x −iηy)

φ0(r) = 0

 ∂
∂z + Mωz
¯h
z

φ0(r) = 0 .
By adding and subtracting the two equation for η = ±, we obtain:

 ∂
∂x + MΩ
¯h x

φ0(r) = 0

 ∂
∂y + MΩ
¯h y

φ0(r) = 0
The function φ0(r) is therefore a product of three gaussian functions in the
variables x, y, z:
φ0(r) ∝e−(x2+y2)/4r2
0 e−z2/4z2
0
with
r0 =
	
¯h
2MΩ
and
z0 =
	
¯h
2Mωz
.

(b) The probability distribution |φ0(r)|2 is centered at r = 0. Its extension
along the x and y axes is ∆x = ∆y = r0 ≃11 nm. Along the z axis, we have
∆z = z0 ≃380 nm.
17.2.6. For the range of temperatures of interest the ratio kBT/¯hωµ for µ =
r, l, z is
kBT
¯hωr
= 0.014 −0.6
kBT
¯hωl
= 1.5 × 105 −6 × 106
kBT

= 30 −1300
The discrete nature of the energy spectrum will play a decisive role only for
the cyclotron motion (corresponding to ˆar, ˆa†
r). Only the ﬁrst three levels of
this motion nr = 0, 1, 2, 3 will be occupied signiﬁcantly in this very low tem-
perature domain. For the other components of the motion, of much lower
frequencies than the cyclotron motion, one expects that the thermal ﬂuctua-
tions will populate a large number of levels. The “quantum” character of the
motions will be hidden under the thermal noise.
Section 17.3:
Coupling of the Cyclotron and Axial Motions
17.3.1. In the presence of the axial-cyclotron coupling, the Hamiltonian ˆHc
is:
ˆHc = ¯hωr (ˆnr + 1/2) −¯hωl (ˆnl + 1/2) + ˆp2
z
2M + Mω2
z
2
(1 + ϵˆnr) ˆz2 .
17.3.2. It is straightforward to check that ˆnr and ˆnl commute with ˆHc. The
corresponding physical quantities (i.e. the excitation numbers of the cyclotron
and magnetron motions) are therefore constants of the motion.
17.3.3.
(a) Inside the subspace Enr,nl, the Hamiltonian ˆHc involves only
the operators ˆz and ˆpz:
ˆH(nr,nl)
c
= ˆp2
z
2M + Mω2
z
2
(1 + ϵnr) ˆz2 + Enr,nl
with Enr,nl = ¯hωr (nr + 1/2) −¯hωl (nl + 1/2).
(b) If the system is prepared in a state belonging to the subspace Enr,nl, it
will remain in this subspace since nr and nl are constants of the motion. Its
motion is described by the Hamiltonian ˆH(nr,nl)
c
, corresponding to a harmonic
oscillator along z, with frequency ωz
√1 + ϵnr.
(c) The eigenvalues of ˆH(nr,nl)
c
are ¯hωz (nz + 1/2) √1 + ϵnr + Enr,nl. The
corresponding eigenstates are the Hermite functions ψn(Z), where:
Z = z

Mωz(1 + ϵnr)1/2/¯h .

180
17 A Quantum Thermometer
17.3.4. We can perform the same operation as above inside each subspace
of ˆnr and ˆnl. We thus obtain a basis of eigenstates of ˆHc which we note
|nr, nl, nz⟩. The eigenvalue corresponding to each eigenstate is:
Enr,nl,nz = ¯hωr (nr + 1/2) −¯hωl (nl + 1/2) + ¯hωz(nz + 1/2)
√
1 + ϵnr
Contrary to the result of Sect. 2, this basis no longer corresponds to factorized
functions of the variables x ± iy and z. The coupling between the axial and
cyclotron motions induces a correlation between the axial frequency and the
state of the cyclotron motion.
17.3.5.
(a) If the system is prepared in the subspace Enr,nl, the axial Hamil-
tonian corresponds to a harmonic oscillator of angular frequency ωz
√1 + ϵnr.
The Ehrenfest theorem then gives:
⟨z⟩(t) = z0 cos

ωzt
√
1 + ϵnr

⟨pz⟩(t) = −Mωzz0
√
1 + ϵnr sin

ωzt
√
1 + ϵnr

since the evolution equations of the quantum expectation values coincide with
the classical equations for a harmonic oscillator.
(b) The phase shift accumulated during a time interval τ between the de-
tected current, proportional to ⟨pz⟩(t), and the external oscillator is:
ϕ = ωzτ
√
1 + ϵnr −ωzτ ≃ϵ
2ωzτnr .
Knowing the time τ, the frequency ωz and the coupling constant ϵ, one can
deduce the cyclotron excitation number nr.
17.3.6.
(a) The possible results of a measurement are the numbers
ϕk = ϵ
2ωzτk ,
where k = nr is a non-negative integer. A given experimental result determines
unambiguously the excitation number of the cyclotron motion.
(b) The measurement postulate of quantum mechanics implies that the state
|Ψ ′⟩of the system after a measurement corresponds to the projection of the
state vector before the measurement |Ψ⟩on the eigensubspace corresponding
to the measured result:
|Ψ ′⟩∝

nl,nz
cn(0)
r
,nl,nz|n(0)
r , nl, nz⟩
where the integer n(0)
r
corresponds to the result of the measurement of ϕ. One
must further normalize the right hand side in order to obtain the state vector
|Ψ ′⟩.

17.5 Solutions
181
(c) For the values of the parameters given in the text, one ﬁnds φ1 =
ϵωzτ/2 ≃2π × 1.28. The accuracy of π/10 is much smaller than the dif-
ference between the phase shifts corresponding to nr and nr + 1, and one can
indeed measure unambiguously the excitation numbers nr = 0, 1, 2, . . ..
(d) A measurement of nr prepares the system in an eigensubspace of ˆnr.
Since ˆnr commutes with the Hamiltonian ˆHc, nr is a constant of the motion.
Any further measurement of the cyclotron excitation number will therefore
give the same result nr, corresponding to the same phase shift ϕk. Of course,
this conclusion is no longer true if the system is not fully isolated and interacts
with its environment. The coupling with the environment can cause transitions
between diﬀerent eigenstates of ˆHc, as we shall see in the next section.
Section 17.4:
A Quantum Thermometer
17.4.1.
(a) The sudden jumps of the signal are associated with a change of
the cyclotron excitation number due to the coupling of the trapped electron
with the thermostat. We recall that otherwise nr would be a constant of the
motion.
(b) In the case of the experimental curve a of Fig. 1, the fractions of time
spent in the nl = 0, 1 and 2 levels are 80%, 19% and 1%, respectively. In the
case of curve b, the fractions are 97% and 3% for the time spent on nl = 0
and nl = 1, respectively.
17.4.2. For a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator of frequency ω, one ﬁnds:
pn+1
pn
= e−(n+3/2)¯hω/kBT
e−(n+1/2)¯hω/kBT = e−¯hω/kBT ,
which is independent of n.
17.4.3. For the curves of Fig. 1, we ﬁnd:
•
Curve a: p1/p0 = 0.24, i.e. kBTa = ¯hωc/ |ln(0.24)| ≃0.7 ¯hωc. This corre-
sponds to Ta ≃5 K. In principle, the determination of the temperature
cans also be made using p2/p1, but the accuracy is poor compared to that
obtained with p1/p0.
•
Curve b: p1/p0 = 0.03, i.e. kBTb = ¯hωc/ |ln(0.03)| ≃0.29 ¯hωc. This corre-
sponds to Tb ≃2 K.
17.4.4.
(a) The normalization factor is determined from:
1 = N
∞

n=0
e−(n+1/2)¯hω/kBT .
This is a geometric series in e−γ:
1 = N e−γ/2
1 −e−γ
→
N = 2 sinh(γ/2) .

182

The mean excitation number is:
¯n =


n e−nγ = −d
dγ ln

n
e−nγ

or:
¯n =
1
eγ −1 .
(b) One can see on the above expression that ¯n is a rapidly increasing func-
tion of the temperature. If the temperature is such that γ ∼1, i.e. kBT ∼¯hωc
(or T ∼7.1 K for this experiment), the mean excitation number is of the
order of (e −1)−1 ∼0.6. Below this temperature, the occupation of the level
nl = 0 becomes predominant, as can be seen on the curves of Fig. 17.1. The
variation of ln pn as a function of n is linear:
ln pn = −n ¯hωc
kBT + Const
The slope increases as the temperature decreases. The curves of Fig. 2 clearly
show this linear variation. They correspond to ratios p1/p0 equal 0.16 , 0.092 ,
0.028 , 0.012 , i.e. temperatures of 1.6 K, 2 K, 3 K and 3.9 K, respectively.
(c) In order to measure a temperature with such a device, one must use a
statistical sample which is signiﬁcantly populated in the level nl = 1. It is
experimentally diﬃcult to go below a probability of 10−2 for the level nr = 1,
which corresponds to a temperature T ∼1.5 K.
(d) In order to improve the sensitivity of this thermometer, one can:
•
Increase signiﬁcantly the total time of measurement in order to detect
occupation probabilities of the level nr = 1 signiﬁcantly less than 10−2;
•
Reduce the value of the magnetic ﬁeld B, in order to reduce the cyclotron
frequency ωc, and to increase (for a given temperature) the occupation
probability of the level nl = 1 .

Exact Results for the Three-Body Problem
The three-body problem is a famous question of mechanics. Henri Poincar´e
was the ﬁrst to prove exact properties, and this contributed to his celebrity.
The purpose of this chapter is to derive some rigorous results for the three-
body problem in quantum mechanics. Here we are interested in obtaining
rigorous lower bounds on three-body ground state energies. Upper bounds are
easier to obtain by variational calculations. We will see that our lower bounds
are actually quite close to the exact answers, to which they provide useful
approximations.
18.1 The Two-Body Problem
Consider a system of two particles with equal masses m and momenta p1 and
p2, interacting via a potential V (r12) where r12 = |r1 −r2|.
18.1.1. Write the Hamiltonian ˆH of the system. Let P = p1 + p2 and p =
(p1 −p2)/2 be the total and relative momentum.
Separate the center of mass ˆHcm and the relative ˆH12 Hamiltonians by writing
ˆH as:
ˆH = ˆHcm + ˆH12 ,
Hcm =
ˆP
2
2M ,
ˆH12 = ˆp2
2µ + V (ˆr12) ,
(18.1)
where M = 2m is the total mass of the system. Give the value of the reduced
mass µ in terms of m.
18.1.2. We denote by E(2)(µ) the ground state energy of ˆH12. Give the ex-
pression for E(2)(µ) in the two cases V (r) = −b2/r and V (r) = κr2/2.

18 Exact Results for the Three-Body Problem
18.2 The Variational Method
Let {|n⟩} be the orthonormal eigenstates of a Hamiltonian ˆH and {En} the
ordered sequence of its corresponding eigenvalues: E0 < E1 < E2 < · · · .
18.2.1. Show that ⟨n| ˆH|n⟩= En.
18.2.2. Consider an arbitrary vector |ψ⟩of the Hilbert space of the system.
By expanding |ψ⟩on the basis {|n⟩}, prove the inequality
∀ψ ,
⟨ψ| ˆH|ψ⟩≥E0⟨ψ|ψ⟩.
(18.2)
18.2.3. Show that the previous result remains valid if ˆH is the Hamiltonian
of a two-body subsystem and |ψ⟩a three-body state. In order to do so, one
can denote by ˆH12 the Hamiltonian of the (1, 2) subsystem in the three-body
system of wave function ψ(r1, r2, r3). One can ﬁrst consider a given value of
r3, and then integrate the result over this variable.
18.3 Relating the Three-Body and Two-Body Sectors
Consider a system of three-particles of equal masses m with pairwise interac-
tions:
V = V (r12) + V (r13) + V (r23) .
18.3.1. Check the identity
3(p2
1 + p2
2 + p2
3) = (p1 + p2 + p3)2 + (p1 −p2)2 + (p2 −p3)2 + (p3 −p1)2
and show that the three-body Hamiltonian ˆH(3) can be written as
ˆH(3) = ˆHcm + ˆH(3)
rel ,
ˆHcm =
ˆP
2
6m ,
where ˆP = ˆp1 + ˆp2 + ˆp3 is the total three-body momentum, and where the
relative Hamiltonian ˆH(3)
rel is a sum of two-particle Hamiltonians of the type
deﬁned in (18.1),
ˆH(3)
rel = ˆH12 + ˆH23 + ˆH31
with a new value µ′ of the reduced mass. Express µ′ in terms of m.
18.3.2. Do the two-body Hamiltonians ˆHij commute in general? What would
be the result if they did?
18.3.3. We call |Ω⟩the normalized ground state of ˆH(3)
rel , and E(3) the cor-
responding energy. Show that the three-body ground state energy is related
to the ground state energy of each two-body subsystem by the inequality:
E(3) ≥3E(2)(µ′).
(18.3)

18.5 From Mesons to Baryons in the Quark Model
187
18.3.4. Which lower bounds on the three-body ground-state energy E(3) does
one obtain in the two cases V (r) = −b2/r and V (r) = κr2/2?
In the ﬁrst case, the exact result, which can be obtained numerically, is E(3) ≃
−1.067 mb4/¯h2. How does this compare with the bound (18.3)?
18.4 The Three-Body Harmonic Oscillator
The three-body problem can be solved exactly in the case of harmonic inter-
actions V (r) = κr2/2. In order to do this, we introduce the Jacobi variables:
ˆR1 = (ˆr1 −ˆr2)/
√
2, ˆR2 = (2ˆr3 −ˆr1 −ˆr2)/
√
6, ˆR3 = (ˆr1 + ˆr2 + ˆr3)/
√
3
ˆQ1 = (ˆp1 −ˆp2)/
√
2, ˆQ2 = (2ˆp3 −ˆp1 −ˆp2)/
√
6, ˆQ3 = (ˆp1 + ˆp2 + ˆp3)/
√
3 .
18.4.1. What are the commutation relations between the components ˆRα
j
and ˆQβ
k of ˆRj and ˆQk, (α = 1, 2, 3, and β = 1, 2, 3)?
18.4.2. Check that one has Q2
1 + Q2
2 + Q2
3 = p2
1 + p2
2 + p2
3, and:
3(R2
1 + R2
2) = (r1 −r2)2 + (r2 −r3)2 + (r3 −r1)2 .
18.4.3. Rewrite the three-body Hamiltonian in terms of these variables for a
harmonic two-body interaction V (r) = κr2/2. Derive the three-body ground
state energy from the result. Show that the inequality (18.3) is saturated, i.e.
the bound (18.3) coincides with the exact result in that case.
Do you think that the bound (18.3), which is valid for any potential, can be
improved without further specifying the potential?
18.5 From Mesons to Baryons in the Quark Model
In elementary particle physics, the previous results are of particular interest
since mesons are bound states of two quarks, whereas baryons, such as the
proton, are bound states of three quarks. Furthermore, it is an empirical ob-
servation that the spectroscopy of mesons and baryons is very well accounted
for by non-relativistic potential models for systems of quarks.
The φ meson, for instance, is a bound state of a strange quark s and
its antiquark ¯s, both of same mass ms. The mass mφ is given by mφ =
2ms + E(2)(µ)/c2 where µ = ms/2, c is the velocity of light, and E(2) is the
ground state energy of the s¯s system which is bound by a potential Vq¯q(r).
The Ω−baryon is made of three strange quarks. Its mass is given by MΩ=
3ms + E(3)/c2, where E(3) is the ground state energy of the three s quarks,
which interact pairwise through a two-body potential Vqq(r).
These potentials are related very simply to each other by

188
18 Exact Results for the Three-Body Problem
Vqq(r) = 1
2Vq¯q(r) .
It is a remarkable property, called ﬂavor independence, that these potentials
are the same for all types of quarks.
18.5.1. Following a procedure similar to that of Sect. 3, show that E(3) ≥
(3/2)E(2)(µ′); express µ′ in terms of µ = ms/2.
18.5.2. Consider the potential Vq¯q(r) = g ln(r/r0), and the two-body Hamil-
tonians ˆH(2)(µ) and ˆH(2)(˜µ) corresponding to the same potential but diﬀerent
reduced masses µ and ˜µ. By rescaling r, transform ˆH(2)(˜µ) into ˆH(2)(µ) + C,
where C is a constant.
Calculate the value of C and show that the eigenvalues E(2)
n (µ) of ˆH(2)(µ)
and E(2)
n (˜µ) of ˆH(2)(˜µ) are related by the simple formula
E(2)
n (˜µ) = E(2)
n (µ) + g
2 ln µ
˜µ .
18.5.3. A striking characteristic of the level spacings in quark–antiquark sys-
tems is that these spacings are approximately independent of the nature of
the quarks under consideration, therefore independent of the quark masses.
Why does this justify the form of the above potential Vq¯q(r) = g ln(r/r0)?
18.5.4. Show that the following relation holds between the Ω−and φ masses
MΩand mφ :
MΩ≥3
2mφ + a
and express the constant a in terms of the coupling constant g.
18.5.5. The observed masses are mφ = 1019 MeV/c2 and MΩ= 1672 MeV/c2.
The coupling constant is g = 650 MeV. Test the inequality with these data.

where M = 2m and µ = m/2 are respectively the total mass and the reduced

18.1.2. For a Coulomb-type interaction V (r) = −b2/r, we get

Section 18.2:
The Variational Method
18.2.1. By deﬁnition, ⟨n| ˆH|n⟩= En⟨n|n⟩= En.
18.2.2. Since {|n⟩} is a basis of the Hilbert space, |ψ⟩can be expanded as
|ψ⟩=  cn|n⟩, and the square of its norm is ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=  |cn|2. We therefore
have ⟨ψ| ˆH|ψ⟩=  En|cn|2.
If we simply write
⟨ψ| ˆH|ψ⟩−E0⟨ψ|ψ⟩=

(En −E0)|cn|2 ,
we obtain, since En ≥E0 and |cn|2 ≥0:
⟨ψ| ˆH|ψ⟩≥E0⟨ψ|ψ⟩.
18.2.3. If ˆH = ˆH12, for ﬁxed r3, ψ(r1, r2, r3) can be considered as a non-
normalized two-body wave function. Therefore

ψ∗(r1, r2, r3) ˆH12 ψ(r1, r2, r3) d3r1 d3r2
≥E0

|ψ(r1, r2, r3)|2 d3r1 d3r2 .
By integrating this inequality over r3, one obtains the desired result.
Section 18.3:
Relating the Three-Body and Two-Body Sectors
18.3.1. The identity is obvious, since the crossed terms vanish on the right-
hand side. Therefore ˆH = ˆP
2/(6m) + ˆH12 + ˆH23 + ˆH31, with
ˆHij =

(18.4)
with a reduced mass µ′ = 3m/4.
18.3.2. Obviously, ˆH12 and ˆH23 do not commute; for instance ˆp1 −ˆp2 does
not commute with ˆV (r23). If they did, the three-body energies would just be
the sum of two-body energies as calculated with a reduced mass µ′ = 3m/4,
and the solution of the three-body problem would be simple.

18.3.3. By deﬁnition, E(3) = ⟨Ω| ˆH(3)
rel |Ω⟩= ⟨Ω| ˆHij|Ω⟩. However, owing
to the results of questions 2.2 and 2.3, we have ⟨Ω| ˆHij|Ω⟩≥E(2)(µ′), so that
E(3) ≥3E(2)(µ′)
with
µ′ = 3m/4 .
18.3.4. For a Coulomb-type potential, we obtain

tion relations:

18.4.2. These relations are a simple algebraic exercise.

which coincides with the lower bound obtained in question 3.4. The bound is
therefore saturated if the interaction is harmonic.
In order to improve the bound, one must further specify the interaction.
Actually, the bound is saturated if and only if the interaction potential is
harmonic. Indeed the variational inequality we use becomes an equality if and
only if the wave function coincides with the exact ground state wave function.
Owing to the particular symmetry of quadratic forms, the Jacobi variables
guarantee that this happens in the harmonic case. The property ceases to be
true for any other potential.

with
µ′ = 3µ/4 .
18.5.2. With the rescaling r →αr, one obtains:

18.5.3. In a logarithmic potential, the level spacing is independent of the
mass. This is a remarkable feature of the observed spectra, at least for heavy
quarks, and justiﬁes the investigation of the logarithmic potential. Amazingly
enough, this empirical prescription works quite well for light quarks, although
one might expect that a relativistic treatment is necessary.

18 Exact Results for the Three-Body Problem
18.5.5. For g = 650 MeV and a = 140 MeV/c2, we obtain
MΩc2 = 1672 MeV ≥1669 MeV ,
which is remarkably accurate.
Actually, the quark–quark potential is only logarithmic at distances smaller
than 1 fm, which corresponds to the φ mean square radius. At larger distances,
it grows more rapidly (linearly). Such inequalities are quite useful in practice
for deciding what choice to make for the potential and for its domain of
validity. The generalization of such inequalities can be found in the literature
quoted below. They are useful in a variety of physical problems.

Properties of a Bose–Einstein Condensate
By cooling down a collection of integer spin atoms to a temperature of less
than one micro-Kelvin, one can observe the phenomenon of Bose–Einstein
condensation. This results in a situation where a large fraction of the atoms
are in the same quantum state. Consequently, the system possesses remarkable
coherence properties. We study here the ground state of such an N particle
system, hereafter called a condensate. We will show that the nature of the
system depends crucially on whether the two-body interactions between the
atoms are attractive or repulsive.
19.1 Particle in a Harmonic Trap
We consider a particle of mass m placed in a harmonic potential with a fre-
quency ω/2π. The Hamiltonian of the system is
ˆH = ˆp2
2m + 1
2mω2ˆr2 ,
where ˆr = (ˆx, ˆy, ˆz) and ˆp = (ˆpx, ˆpy, ˆpz) are respectively the position and
momentum operators of the particle. We set a0 =

¯h/(mω).
19.1.1. Recall the energy levels of this system, and its ground state wave
function φ0(r).
19.1.2. We wish to obtain an upper bound on this ground state energy by
the variational method. We use a Gaussian trial wave function:
ψσ(r) =
1
(σ2π)3/4 exp(−r2/(2σ2))
with
σ > 0 .
(19.1)
The values of a relevant set of useful integrals are given below.
By varying σ, ﬁnd an upper bound on the ground state energy. Compare
the bound with the exact value, and comment on the result.

19.2 Interactions Between Two Conﬁned Particles
We now consider two particles of equal masses m, both placed in the same
harmonic potential. We denote the position and momentum operators of the
two particles by ˆr1, ˆr2 and ˆp1, ˆp2.
19.2.1. In the absence of interactions between the particles, the Hamiltonian
of the system is
ˆH = ˆp2

(a) What are the energy levels of this Hamiltonian?
(b) What is the ground state wave function Φ0(r1, r2)?
19.2.2. We now suppose that the two particles interact via a potential v(r1−
r2). We assume that, on the scale of a0, this potential is of very short range
and that it is peaked around the origin. Therefore, for two functions f(r) and
g(r) which vary appreciably only over domains larger than a0, one has

f(r1) g(r2) v(r1 −r2) d3r1 d3r2 ≃4π¯h2a


f(r) g(r) d3r .
(19.2)
The quantity a, which is called the scattering length, is a characteristic of the
atomic species under consideration. It can be positive (repulsive interaction)
or negative (attractive interaction). One can measure for instance that for
sodium atoms (isotope 23Na) a = 3.4 nm, whereas a = −1.5 nm for lithium
atoms (isotope 7Li).
(a) Using perturbation theory, calculate to ﬁrst order in a the shift of the
ground state energy of ˆH caused by the interaction between the two
atoms. Comment on the sign of this energy shift.
(b) Under what condition on a and a0 is this perturbative approach expected
to hold?

we use the variational method with factorized trial wave functions of the type:
Ψσ(r1, r2, . . . , rN) = ψσ(r1) ψσ(r2) . . . ψσ(rN) ,
where ψσ(r) is deﬁned in (19.1).

never exceeds 1200 for a trap of frequency ω/(2π) = 145 Hz. How can this
result be explained?
19.6 Solutions
Section 19.1:
Particle in a Harmonic Trap
19.1.1. The Hamiltonian of a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator can be
written
ˆH = ˆHx + ˆHy + ˆHz ,
where ˆHi represents a one dimensional harmonic oscillator of same frequency
along the axis i = x, y, z. We therefore use a basis of eigenfunctions of ˆH of
the form φ(x, y, z) = χnx(x) χny(y) χnz(z), i.e. products of eigenfunctions of
ˆHx, ˆHy, ˆHz, where χn(x) is the nth Hermite function. The eigenvalues of ˆH
can be written as En = (n+3/2)¯hω, where n = nx +ny +nz is a non-negative
integer.
The ground state wave function, of energy (3/2)¯hω, corresponds to nx = ny =
nz = 0, i.e.
φ0(r) =
1
(a2
0π)3/4 exp[−r2/(2a2
0)] .
19.1.2. The trial wave functions ψσ are normalized. In order to obtain an
upper bound for the ground-state energy of ˆH, we must calculate E(σ) =
⟨ψσ| ˆH|ψσ⟩and minimize the result with respect to σ. Using the formulas
given in the text, one obtains

This quantity is minimum for σ = a0, and we ﬁnd Emin(σ) = (3/2) ¯hω. In
this particular case, the upper bound coincides with the exact result. This is
due to the fact that the set of trial wave functions contains the ground state
wave function of ˆH.

19 Properties of a Bose–Einstein Condensate
Section 19.2:
Interactions between Two Conﬁned Particles
19.2.1.
(a) The Hamiltonian ˆH can be written as ˆH = ˆH1 + ˆH2, where ˆH1
and ˆH2 are respectively the Hamiltonians of particle 1 and particle 2. A basis
of eigenfunctions of ˆH is formed by considering products of eigenfunctions
of ˆH1 (functions of the variable r1) and eigenfunctions of ˆH2 (functions of
the variable r2). The energy eigenvalues are En = (n + 3)¯hω, where n is a
non-negative integer.
(b) The ground state of ˆH is:
Φ0(r1, r2) = φ0(r1) φ0(r2) =

For a repulsive interaction (a > 0), there is an increase in the energy of the
system. Conversely, in the case of an attractive interaction (a < 0), the ground
state energy is lowered.
(b) The perturbative approach yields a good approximation provided the
energy shift ∆E is small compared to the level spacing ¯hω of ˆH. Therefore,
one must have |a| ≪a0, i.e. the scattering length must be small compared to
the spreading of the ground state wave function.

Section 19.4:
Condensates with Repulsive Interactions
19.4.1. Figure 19.2 gives the variation of ˜E(˜σ) as a function of ˜σ for increas-
ing values of η. The value of the function for a given value of ˜σ increases as η
increases. For large ˜σ, the behavior of ˜E does not depend on η. It is dominated
by the potential energy term 3˜σ2/4.
The minimum ˜Emin increases as η increases. This minimum corresponds
the point where the potential energy term, which tends to favor small values
of σ, matches the kinetic and interaction energy terms which, on the contrary,
favor large sizes σ. Since the interactions are repulsive, the size of the system
is larger than in the absence of interactions, and the corresponding energy is
also increased.
Fig. 19.2. Variation of ˜E(˜σ) with ˜σ for η = 0, 10, 100, 1000 (from bottom to top)
19.4.2. Let us assume η is much larger than 1 and let us neglect a priori
the kinetic energy term 1/˜σ2. The function (3/4)˜σ2 + η/˜σ3 is minimum for
˜σmin = (2η)1/5 where its value is
˜Emin = 5
4(2η)2/5 .
One can check a posteriori that it is legitimate to neglect the kinetic energy
term 1/˜σ2. In fact it is always smaller than one of the two other contributions
to ˜E:

For ˜σ < ˜σmin, one has 1/˜σ2 ≪η/˜σ3.

This variation of E/N as N 2/5 is very well reproduced by the data. In Fig. 19.3
we have plotted a ﬁt of the data with this law. One ﬁnds E/N ≃αN 2/5 with
α = 8.2 × 10−33 Joule.
Fig. 19.3. Fit of the experimental data with an N 2/5 law
19.4.4.
(a) One ﬁnds a0 = 1.76 µm and ¯hω = 9.4 10−32 Joule.
(b) Consider the value a = 3.4 nm given in the text. The approximation
η ≫1 will hold if N ≫1300. This is clearly the case for the data of Fig. 19.1.
(c) The coeﬃcient α = 8.2 × 10−33 Joule found by ﬁtting the data leads to
a = 2.8 nm. This value is somewhat lower than the expected value a = 3.4 nm.
This is due to the fact that the result (19.3), E/(N¯hω) ≃1.142 (Na/a0)2/5,
obtained in a variational calculation using simple Gaussian trial functions,
does not yield a suﬃciently accurate value of the ground state energy. With
more appropriate trial wave functions, one can obtain, in the mean ﬁeld ap-
proximation and in the limit η ≫1: Egs/(N¯hω) ≃1.055 (Na/a0)2/5. The ﬁt
to the data is then in agreement with the experimental value of the scattering
length.

Condensates with Attractive Interactions
19.5.1. The function ˜E(˜σ) is represented in Fig. 19.4. We notice that it has
a local minimum only for small enough values of η. For η < 0, there is always
a minimum at 0, where the function tends to −∞.

19.5.2. The absolute minimum at σ = 0 corresponds to a highly compressed
atomic cloud. For such small sizes, approximation (19.2) for a “short range”
potential loses its meaning. Physically, one must take into account the forma-
tion of molecules and/or atomic aggregates which have not been considered
here.
19.5.3. The local minimum at ˜σ ̸= 0 disappears when ˜E(˜σ) has an inﬂexion
point where the derivative vanishes. This happens for a critical value of η
determined by the two conditions:

or σc ≃0.67 a0. If the local minimum exists, i.e. for |η| < |ηc|, one can hope
to obtain a metastable condensate, whose size will be of the order of the
minimum found in this variational approach. On the other hand, if one starts
with a value of |η| which is too large, for instance by trying to gather too
many atoms, the condensate will collapse, and molecules will form.

19.7 Comments
The ﬁrst Bose–Einstein condensate of a dilute atomic gas was observed in
Boulder (USA) in 1995 (M.H. Anderson, J.R. Ensher, M.R. Matthews, C.E.
Wieman, and E.A. Cornell, Science 269, 198 (1995)) with rubidium atoms.
The experimental data shown in this chapter for a sodium condensate
come from the results published by M.-O. Mewes, M.R. Andrews, N.J. van
Druten, D.M. Kurn, D.S. Durfee, and W. Ketterle, Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 416
(1996). The measurement of the energy E/N is done by suddenly switching
oﬀthe conﬁning potential and by measuring the resulting ballistic expansion.
The motion of the atoms in this expansion essentially originates from the
conversion of the potential energy of the atoms in the trap into kinetic energy.
The experimental results on lithium have been reported by C. Bradley,
C.A. Sackett, and R.G. Hulet, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 985 (1997).
The Nobel prize 2001 has been awarded to E. Cornell, W. Ketterle, and
C. Wieman for the achievement of Bose-Einstein condensation in dilute gases
of alkali atoms, and for early fundamental studies of the properties of the
condensates.

spin 1.
We take {|σ1, σ2, · · · , σN⟩}, σn = 1, 0, −1, to be the orthonormal basis of
the states of the system; it is an eigenbasis of the operators { ˆJn

and we shall treat it in ﬁrst order perturbation theory.

20.3 Energy Levels of the Chain
We now work in the subspace E1. We introduce the following notation
|n, ±⟩= |σ1 = 0, σ2 = 0, · · · , σn = ±1, σn+1 = 0, · · · , σN = 0⟩.
Owing to the periodicity of the chain, we deﬁne |N + 1, ±⟩≡|1, ±⟩.

20.3 Energy Levels of the Chain

20.3.1. Show that
ˆH1|n, ±⟩= A(|n −1, ±⟩+ |n + 1, ±⟩) + |ψn⟩,
where |ψn⟩is orthogonal to the subspace E1.
Without giving the complete form of |ψn⟩, give an example of one of its
components, and give the energy of the eigenspace of ˆH0 to which |ψn⟩belongs.
20.3.2. Consider the circular permutation operator ˆT, and its adjoint ˆT †,
deﬁned by
ˆT|σ1, σ2, · · · , σN⟩= |σN, σ1, · · · , σN−1⟩
ˆT †|σ1, σ2, · · · , σN⟩= |σ2, σ3, · · · , σN, σ1⟩.
Write the action of ˆT and ˆT † on the states |n, ±⟩.
20.3.3. Check that, in the subspace E1, ˆH1 and A( ˆT + ˆT †) have the same
matrix elements.
20.3.4. Show that the eigenvalues λk of ˆT are the N-th roots of unity (we
recall that N is assumed to be even):
λk = e−iqk
qk = −π + 2kπ
N
k = 0, · · · , N −1 .
20.3.5. We seek, in E1, the 2N eigenvectors |qk, ±⟩of ˆT, each corresponding
to an eigenvalue λk. Each |qk, ±⟩is written
|qk, ±⟩=


(a) Write a recursion relation between the coeﬃcients cn.
(b) Show that

(c) Show that the states |qk, ±⟩deﬁned using (20.1) and (20.2) are ortho-
normal.
(d) Show that the vectors |qk, ±⟩are also eigenvectors of ˆT † and ˆT + ˆT †, and
give the corresponding eigenvalues.
(e) Calculate the scalar product ⟨n, ϵ|qk, ϵ′⟩(ϵ, ϵ′ = ±) and write the expan-
sion of the states |n, ±⟩in the basis |qk, ±⟩.
20.3.6. We treat the Hamiltonian ˆH1 of Sect. 2 as a perturbation to ˆH0.
We limit ourselves to the ﬁrst excited level of ˆH0, and we want to calcu-
late how the perturbation lifts the degeneracy of this level. We recall that,
in the degenerate case, ﬁrst order perturbation theory consists in diagonaliz-
ing the restriction of the perturbing Hamiltonian in the degenerate subspace
of the dominant term ˆH0.

(a) Explain why the results of questions 3.3 and 3.5 above allow one to solve
this problem.
(b) In ﬁrst order perturbation theory, give the new energy levels which arise
from the ﬁrst excited state of ˆH0, and the corresponding eigenstates.
(c) Draw qualitatively the energies E(qk) in terms of the variable qk which
can be treated as a continuous variable, qk ∈[−π, +π[, if N is very large.
1. What is the degeneracy of each new energy level?
20.4 Vibrations of the Chain: Excitons
We now study the time evolution of the spin chain.
20.4.1. Suppose that at time t = 0, the system is in the state
|Ψ(0)⟩=

ϵ=±


k=0
ϕϵ

k|2 = 1 .
Setting ω = 2A/¯h, write the state |Ψ(t)⟩at a later time t.
20.4.2. We assume that the initial state is |Ψ(0)⟩= |qk, +⟩.
(a) Write the probability amplitude αn(t) and the probability Pn(t) of ﬁnding
at time t the n-th spin pointing upwards, i.e. σn = +1 and σm = 0 for
m ̸= n. Show that Pn(t) is the same for all sites of the chain.
(b) The molecules of the chain are located at xn = na, where a is the lattice
spacing. Show that the probability amplitude αn(t) is equal to the value
at x = xn of a monochromatic plane wave
Ψk(x, t) = Cei(p(q)x−E(q)t)/¯h ,
where C is a constant, q = qk, and x is the abscissa along the chain.
Express p(q) in terms of q.
(c) Show that Ψk(x, t) is an eigenstate of the momentum operator ˆpx =
(¯h/i)∂/∂x along the chain.
Show that the value of p(q) ensures the periodicity of Ψk(x, t), i.e. Ψk(x +
L, t) = Ψk(x, t), where L = Na is the length of the chain.
(d) Show that, for |qk| ≪1, Ψk(x, t) satisﬁes a Schr¨odinger equation for a
particle of negative mass m, placed in a constant potential; give the value
of m.
20.4.3. In a more complete analysis, one can associate quasi-particles to the
magnetic excitations of the chain. These quasi-particles, which we call “mag-
netic excitons”, have an energy E(qk) and a momentum p(qk).
At very low temperatures, T ≈1.4 K, the chain is in the ground state
of ˆH0. If low energy neutrons collide with it, they can create excitons whose
energy and momentum can be determined by measuring the recoil of the
neutrons. The experimental result for E(q) as a function of q ∈[−π, 0] is
given in Fig. 20.1.

20.4 Vibrations of the Chain: Excitons

Fig. 20.1. Experimental measurement of the excitation energy E(q) as a function
of q between −π and 0. The energy scale is in meV (10−3 eV)
(a) Deduce from that data approximate values for D and A.
(b) What do you think of the approximation D ≫A and of the comparison
between theory and experiment? How could one improve the agreement
between theory and experiment?
(c) Is it justiﬁed to assume that the chain is in its ground state when it
is at thermal equilibrium at 1.4 K? We recall the Boltzmann factor:
N(E2)/N(E1) = exp[−(E2 −E1)/kT], with k = 8.6 × 10−5 eV K−1.
20.4.4. Consider, at time t = 0, the state
|Ψ(0)⟩=
N−1

k=0
ϕk|qk, +⟩
with
N−1

k=0
|ϕk|2 = 1.
We assume that N ≫1, that the coeﬃcients ϕk have signiﬁcant values only
in a close vicinity of some value k = k0, or, equivalently, q ≈q0, and that, to
a good approximation, in this vicinity,
E(q) = E(q0) + (q −q0)u0 ,
u0 = dE
dq

q=q0
.
Show that the probability Pn(t) of ﬁnding σn = +1 at time t is the same as
the probability Pn′(t′) of ﬁnding σn′ = +1 at another time t′ whose value will
be expressed in terms of t and of the distance between the sites n and n′.
Interpret the result as the propagation of a spin excitation wave along the
chain. Calculate the propagation velocity of this wave and give its numerical
value for a = 0.7 nm and q0 = −π/2.
20.4.5. We now assume that the initial state is |Ψ(0)⟩= |n = 1, +⟩.

208
20 Magnetic Excitons
(a) Write the probability Pm(t) of ﬁnding σm = +1 at a later time t?
(b) Calculate the probabilities P1(t) and P2(t), in the case N = 2, and inter-
pret the result.
(c) Calculate P1(t) in the case N = 8. Is the evolution of P1(t) periodic?
(d) For N ≫1, one can convert the above sums into integrals. The prob-
abilities are then Pm(t) ≈|Jm−1(ωt)|2 where the Jn(x) are the Bessel
functions. These functions satisfy  |Jn(x)|2 = 1 and Jn = (−)nJ−n.
For x ≫1 we have Jn(x) ≈

2
πx cos(x −nπ/2 −π/4) if x > 2|n|/π, and
Jn(x) ≈0 if x < 2|n|/π.
Which sites are appreciably reached by the probability wave at a time t
such that ωt ≫1?
(e) Interpret the result as the propagation along the chain of a probability
amplitude (or wave). Calculate the propagation velocity and compare it
with the result obtained in question 4.4).

20.2.2. The ground state of ˆH0 corresponds to all the σn equal to zero, so
that E = 0. This ground state is non-degenerate.
20.2.3. The ﬁrst excited state corresponds to all the σ’s being zero except
one: σn equal to ±1. The energy is D, and the degeneracy 2N, since there are
N possible choices of the non-vanishing σn, and two values ±1 of σn.
20.2.4. J± = Jx ± iJy. A direct calculation leads to the result.

20.5 Solutions
209
Section 20.3:
Energy Levels of the Chain
20.3.1. The action of the perturbing Hamiltonian on the basis states is, set-
ting ϵ = ±:
ˆH1|n, ϵ⟩= A (|n −1, ϵ⟩+ |n + 1, ϵ⟩)
+A


(|0, · · · 0, σn = ϵ, 0 · · · 0, σn′ = −1, σn′+1 = +1, 0 · · · 0⟩
+|0 · · · 0, σn = ϵ, 0 · · · 0, σn′ = +1, σn′+1 = −1, 0 · · · 0⟩) .
The vector |ψ⟩= |σ1 = 1, σ2 = −1, 0 · · · 0, σn = ϵ, 0 · · · 0⟩belongs to this latter
set; it is an eigenvector of ˆH0 with energy 3D.
20.3.2. The deﬁnition of ˆT, ˆT † and |n, ±⟩implies:
ˆT|n, ±⟩= |n + 1, ±⟩;
ˆT †|n, ±⟩= |n −1, ±⟩.
20.3.3. We therefore obtain
A( ˆT + ˆT †)|n, ±⟩= A(|n −1, ±⟩+ |n + 1, ±⟩) .
Since
ˆH1|n, ±⟩= A(|n −1, ±⟩+ |n + 1, ±⟩) + |ψn⟩
where ⟨n′, ±|ψn⟩= 0 ,
ˆH1 and A( ˆT + ˆT †) obviously have the same matrix elements in the subspace
E1.
20.3.4. Since ˆT N = ˆI, an eigenvalue λk satisﬁes λN
k = 1, which proves that
each eigenvalue is an N-th root of unity. Conversely, we will see in the following
that each N-th root of unity is an eigenvalue.
20.3.5.
(a) The corresponding eigenvectors satisfy
|qk, ±⟩=

n
cn|n, ±⟩
ˆT|qk, ±⟩= λk|qk, ±⟩
therefore one has

n
cn|n + 1, ±⟩= λk

n
cn|n, ±⟩.
Hence the recursion relation and its solution are
λk cn = cn−1
cn =

λn−1
k
c1 = eiqk(n−1)c1 .

20 Magnetic Excitons
(b) The normalization condition 
n |cn|2 = 1 gives N|c1|2 = 1. If we choose
c1 = eiqk/
√
N, the eigenvectors are of unit norm and we recover the solution
given in the text of the problem.
(c) The scalar product of |qk, ϵ⟩and |qk′, ϵ′⟩is easily calculated:
⟨qk′, ϵ′|qk, ϵ⟩= δϵ,ϵ′ 1
N

n
e2iπn(k−k′)/N = δϵ,ϵ′ δk,k′ .
(d) The vectors |qk, ±⟩are eigenvectors of ˆT † with the complex conjugate
eigenvalues λ∗
k. Therefore they are also eigenvectors of ˆT + ˆT † with the eigen-
value λk + λ∗
k = 2 cos qk = −2 cos(2kπ/N).
(e) From the deﬁnition of the vectors, we have
⟨n, ϵ|qk, ϵ′⟩=
1

N
eiqknδϵϵ′
and (directly or by using the closure relation)
|n, ±⟩=

k=0
e−iqkn|qk, ±⟩.
20.3.6. The restriction of ˆH1 to the subspace E1 is identical to A( ˆT + ˆT †)
(question 3.3). In E1, the operator A( ˆT + ˆT †) is diagonal in the basis |qk, ±⟩.
Therefore the restriction of ˆH1 is also diagonal in that basis. The energy levels
are
E(qk) = D + 2A cos(qk) ,
(20.3)
corresponding to the states |qk, ±⟩. As far as degeneracies are concerned, there
is a twofold degeneracy for all levels (the spin value may be +1 or −1). In
addition, for all levels except q = −π and q = 0, there is a degeneracy qk ↔
−qk (symmetry of the cosine). Therefore, in general, the degeneracy is 4.
Section 20.4:

20.4.2. We now consider an initial state |qk, ±⟩, evolving as e−iE(q)t/¯h|qk, ±⟩.
(a) We therefore obtain an amplitude
αn(t) =
1

N
ei(qkn−E(qk)t/¯h)
and a probability Pn(t) = |αn|2 = 1
N , which is the same on each site.

20.5 Solutions
211
(b) In the expression
αn(t) =
1

N
ei(qkxn/a−E(qk)t/¯h) ,
we see that αn(t) is the value at x = xn of the function Ψk(x, t) =
1
√
N exp[i(px −Et)/¯h] with E(q) = D + ¯hω cos q and p(q) = ¯hq/a.
(c) The function Ψk(x) is an eigenstate of ˆpx with the eigenvalue ¯hqk/a.
Since N is even, we obtain:
eiqkL/a = eiNqk = e2πik = 1 ,
which proves the periodicity of Ψk.
(d) For |qk| ≪1, cos qk = 1 −q2
k/2 . Therefore E = E0 + p2/2m with
E0 = D + 2A
and
m = −¯h2
2Aa2 = −¯h
ωa2 .
Ψk then satisﬁes the wave equation
i¯h∂ψ
∂t = −¯h2
2m
∂2ψ
∂x2 + E0ψ ,
which is a Schr¨odinger equation for a particle of negative mass (in solid state
physics, this corresponds to the propagation of holes and in ﬁeld theory, to
the propagation of anti-particles).
20.4.3.
(a) With the data of the ﬁgure which resemble grosso modo the
E(q) drawn in Fig. 20.2, one ﬁnds D + 2A ∼3.2 × 10−3 eV, and D −2A ∼
0.4 × 10−3 eV. Therefore:
D ∼1.8 × 10−3 eV
A ∼0.7 × 10−3 eV .
(b) The approximation D ≫A is poor. The theory is only meaningful to
order (A/D)2 ∼10%. Second order perturbation theory is certainly necessary
to account quantitatively for the experimental curve which has a steeper shape
than a sinusoid in the vicinity of q = −π.
(c) For T = 1.4 K, kT ∼1.2 × 10−4 eV, exp(−(D −2A)/kT) ∼0.04. To a
few % , the system is in its ground state.
20.4.4. Approximating E(q) = E(q0) + (q −q0)u0 in the vicinity of q0, we
obtain
αn(t) =

(d) Since Jn(ωt) ∼0 for ωt < 2|n|/π, only sites for which |m −1| < πωt/2

We notice in particular that Pm(t) + Pm+1(t) = 2/(πωt) is independent of m
and varies slowly with t.
(e) The probability wave becomes delocalized very quickly on the chain
(ωt > a few π). The edges of the region where the probability is non zero
propagate in opposite directions with the velocity v = πωa/2. This is compa-
rable with what we have found in 4.4 for a wave packet near q = π/2.

A Quantum Box
In recent years, it has become possible to devise quantum boxes (also called
quantum dots) of nanometric dimensions, inside which the conduction elec-
trons of a solid are conﬁned at low temperatures. The ensuing possibility to
control the energy levels of such devices leads to very interesting applications
in micro-electronics and opto-electronics.
A quantum box is made of a material A on which another material B is
deposited. A set of quantum boxes is shown on Fig. 21.1. The dots of In As
(material B) are deposited on a substate of Ga As (material A).

21 A Quantum Box
In this chapter, we are interested in the motion of an electron in a two-
dimensional box. We note −q the electric charge of the electron, and we neglect
spin eﬀects. We shall assume that in a solid, the dynamics of an electron is
described by the usual Schr¨odinger equation where:
(i) the mass of the electron is replaced by an eﬀective mass µ,
(ii) the atoms of the materials A and B create an eﬀective potential V (x, y)
which is slowly varying on the atomic scale.
21.1 Results on the One-Dimensional
Harmonic Oscillator
Consider a particle of mass µ placed in the one-dimensional potential V (x) =
µω2x2/2. We recall the deﬁnition of the annihilation and creation operators

We also recall that the eigenvalues of the number operator ˆnx are the non-
negative integers. Noting |nx⟩the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue
nx, we have
ˆa†

What is the characteristic extension ℓ0 of the electron’s position distribution

21.1.2. The eﬀective mass µ of the electron in the quantum box is µ =
0.07 m0, where m0 is the electron mass in vacuum. We assume that ¯hω =
0.060 eV, i.e. ω/(2π) = 1.45 × 1013 Hz.
(a) Evaluate ℓ0 numerically.
(b) At a temperature of 10 Kelvin, how many levels of the oscillator are pop-
ulated signiﬁcantly?
(c) What is the absorption wavelength of radiation in a transition between
two consecutive levels?

21.2 The Quantum Box
We assume that the eﬀective two-dimensional potential seen by an electron
in the quantum box is:
V (x, y) = 1

(21.4)
We note ˆH0 = (ˆp2
x + ˆp2
y)/2µ + V (x, y) the Hamiltonian of the electron.
21.2.1. We deﬁne the operators ˆay, ˆa†
y and ˆny in an analogous way to (21.1)
and (21.2). Give a justiﬁcation for the fact that the states |nx, ny⟩, which
are eigenstates of ˆnx and ˆny with integer eigenvalues nx and ny, form an
eigenbasis of ˆH0. Give the energy levels EN of ˆH0 in terms of nx and ny.
21.2.2. What is the degeneracy gN of each level EN where N = 0, 1, 2 . . . ?
21.2.3. Express the operator ˆLz = ˆxˆpy −ˆyˆpx as a function of the operators
ˆax, ˆa†
x, ˆay, ˆa†
y.
21.2.4. Write the action of ˆLz on the eigenstates |nx, ny⟩of ˆH0. Do the states
|nx, ny⟩have a well-deﬁned angular momentum Lz ?
21.2.5. We are now interested in ﬁnding another eigenbasis of ˆH0.
(a) Show that ˆH0 and ˆLz commute. Interpret this result physically.
(b) We introduce the “left” and “right” annihilation operators as
ˆal =
1
√
2(ˆax + iˆay)
ˆar =

√
2(ˆax −iˆay)
(21.5)
and the corresponding creation operators ˆa†
l , ˆa†
r. Write the commutation
relations of these four operators.
(c) Show that ˆnl = ˆa†
l ˆal and ˆnr = ˆa†
rˆar commute. Using the values of the
commutators [ˆal, ˆa†
l ] and [ˆar, ˆa†
r], and following the same procedure as in
the usual quantization of the harmonic oscillator, justify that the eigen-
values nl and nr of ˆnl and ˆnr are integers.
We assume that {ˆnl, ˆnr} form a complete set of commuting observables in
the problem under consideration, and we note {|nl, nr⟩} the corresponding
eigenbasis.
(d) Write the expression of ˆnl and ˆnr in terms of ˆax, ˆa†
x, ˆay and ˆa†
y. Deduce
from that an expression of the operators ˆH0 and ˆLz in terms of ˆnl and ˆnr.
Justify that the states {|nl, nr⟩} form an eigenbasis common to ˆH0 and
ˆLz.
(e) We note m¯h and EN the eigenvalues of ˆLz and ˆH0. What are the allowed

21 A Quantum Box
21.2.6. We consider the eigen-subspace of ˆH0 generated by |nx = 1, ny = 0⟩
and |nx = 0, ny = 1⟩as deﬁned in Sect. 2.1 above. Write the eigenstates of
ˆLz in this basis and give the corresponding eigenvalues.
21.3 Quantum Box in a Magnetic Field
One applies a uniform magnetic ﬁeld B, parallel to the z axis, on the quan-
tum box. This ﬁeld derives from the vector potential A(r) = −(yB/2)ux +
(xB/2)uy where ux and uy are the unit vectors along the x and y directions.
We assume that the Hamiltonian of the electron in the quantum box and in
presence of the ﬁeld is given by
ˆHB = 1
2µ(ˆpx + qAx(ˆr))2 + 1
2µ(ˆpy + qAy(ˆr))2 + 1
2µω2(ˆx2 + ˆy2)
with the usual canonical commutation relations [ˆx, ˆpx] = [ˆy, ˆpy] = i¯h and
[ˆx, ˆpy] = [ˆy, ˆpx] = 0. We introduce the cyclotron angular frequency ωc = qB/µ,
(ωc > 0).
21.3.1. Expand ˆHB and show that one can always ﬁnd a basis of the sys-
tem for which both the total energy and the angular momentum along z are
simultaneously well deﬁned.
21.3.2. We deﬁne Ω=

ω2 + ω2c/4. By redeﬁning in a simple manner the
operators of Sect. 2, give the energy levels Enl,nr of the system in terms of
the two integers nl and nr.
21.3.3. For simplicity we subtract the zero point energy ¯hΩfrom the energies
Enl,nr, and we set ˜Enl,nr = Enl,nr −¯hΩ.
(a) Give the approximate expressions of the levels ˜Enl,nr in the two limits of
a weak and of a strong ﬁeld, and give a deﬁnition of these regimes.
(b) Plot as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld, the positions of the energy levels
originating from the N = 0, 1, 2 levels in the absence of magnetic ﬁeld.
(c) Show that two levels cross for a value of B such that ωc = ω/
√
2 and
specify which states they correspond to.
21.3.4. In the following we assume that ωc < ω/
√
2. Using the values of ω
and of the eﬀective mass µ given in the ﬁrst section of the problem, determine
which values of the magnetic ﬁeld correspond to this inequality.
21.3.5. Show that the ﬁrst three eigenstates of ˆHB have respective energies
E0 = ¯hΩ,
E−= 2¯hΩ−¯hωc
2
,
E+ = 2¯hΩ+ ¯hωc
2
.
We note |u0⟩, |u−⟩, |u+⟩the three corresponding eigenstates. What is the value
of the angular momentum Lz in each of these three states?

21.4 Experimental Veriﬁcation

21.4 Experimental Veriﬁcation
One can study the energy levels of an electron in a quantum box by measuring
the absorption spectrum of a light beam. Absorption peaks appear at the Bohr
frequencies (Ef −Ei)/h of the box, corresponding to excitations of the electron
from an initial level |ui⟩to a ﬁnal one |uf⟩.
21.4.1. At a temperature of 10 K, one observes that only the level |ui⟩= |u0⟩
contributes signiﬁcantly to the absorption signal. Justify this fact using the
result of question 1.2.
21.4.2. The experimental values of the frequencies of the ﬁrst two absorption
peaks of a quantum box are given in Fig. 21.2, according to the values of the
applied magnetic ﬁeld. Verify that the model developed above accounts for
the slope of the curves for suﬃciently large values of B, but that it fails to
describe the behavior near B = 0.

The conﬁnement along the z direction can be simulated by an inﬁnite one-
dimensional square well potential of extension D in this direction.
(a) Recall the energy levels of a particle of mass µ in a one-dimensional inﬁnite
well of width D. What is the energy diﬀerence between the two lowest lying
states?

220

(b) Under what condition between D and ω is it legitimate to consider that
the motion along the z axis is “frozen”, and to restrict to the lowest lying
levels of the harmonic motion in the x, y plane?
(c) On the picture 21.1, the vertical (z) and horizontal (xy) scales are diﬀer-
ent. In order to neglect the motion along the z direction, which of the two
scales must be contracted? One can make use of the value of l0 calculated
in Sect. 1.2.
21.5 Anisotropy of a Quantum Box
In order to reproduce the positions of the absorption peaks for low values of
the ﬁeld (see Fig. 21.2), we assume that the conﬁning potential in the quantum
box is slightly anisotropic. We therefore replace the expression (21.4) of the
conﬁning potential by
V (x, y) = 1
2µω2(1 + ϵ)x2 + 1
2µω2(1 −ϵ)y2
with ϵ ≪1 .
(21.6)
We treat the problem using perturbation theory. In what follows, we as-
sume that the magnetic ﬁeld is small (ωc ≪ω). The Hamiltonian ˆHB,ϵ can
therefore be written as:
ˆHB,ϵ = ˆH0 + ˆW
with
ˆH0 = ˆp2
2µ + 1
2µω2(ˆx2 + ˆy2)
and
ˆW = ωc
2
ˆLz + ϵµω2
2 (ˆx2 −ˆy2) .
In this expression, ˆW is the perturbation, and we neglect terms of order B2.
We work in the basis {|nx, ny⟩}.
21.5.1. Using the potential given in (21.6), determine the energy levels of
the electron for B = 0.
21.5.2. Applying perturbation theory, evaluate to ﬁrst order in B and ϵ the
energy shift of the ground state of the quantum box with respect to the value
found in Sect. 2.
21.5.3. We are now interested in the position of the two energy states origi-
nating from the ﬁrst excited level of ˆH0 found in Sect. 2.
(a) Write the restriction of the Hamiltonian HB,ϵ in the basis {|nx = 1, ny =
0⟩, |nx = 0, ny = 1⟩} of the corresponding subspace.
(b) Deduce the approximate values of the energies of interest E−(B, ϵ) and
E+(B, ϵ) (with E−< E+).
(c) Give the expressions of the corresponding eigenstates |u−(B, ϵ)⟩and
|u+(B, ϵ)⟩. One can introduce the mixing angle α such that tan(2α) =
ωc/(ϵω).

21.6 Solutions

21.5.4. We now turn back to the experimental data of Fig. 21.2.
(a) Is the transition region between large values of B and B = 0 correctly
described by this model of an anisotropic quantum box?
(b) What value of the anisotropy ϵ can be deduced from the positions of the
ﬁrst two absorption peaks in the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld?

law |ψ0(x)|2 for the position distribution.
21.1.2.
(a) One ﬁnds ℓ0 = 4.3 nm.
(b) The ratio of populations in the ﬁrst excited level n = 1 and the ground
state n = 0 is given by the Boltzmann law
r = exp(−¯hω/(kBT)) = exp(−70) = 5 × 10−31 ,
which is negligible. The population of other excited levels is even smaller.
Therefore, at T = 10 K, only the ground state is populated.
(c) One ﬁnds λ = 2πc/ω = 21 µm, which corresponds to an infrared radia-
tion.
Section 21.2:
The Quantum Box
21.2.1. The Hamiltonian is ˆH0 = ¯hω(ˆnx + ˆny +1), and the operators ˆnx and
ˆny commute. We can ﬁnd an eigenbasis common to the two operators. If a
function Ψ(x, y) is an eigenfunction of ˆnx, its x dependence is completely de-
termined (Hermite function of the variable x

µω/¯h, corresponding to |nx⟩).
Similarly, for the y dependence. The set {ˆnx, ˆny} is therefore a CSCO, with
eigenbasis |nx, ny⟩. This basis is also an eigenbasis of ˆH0, the eigenvalue cor-
responding to |nx, ny⟩is EN = ¯hω(N + 1) with N = nx + ny.
21.2.2. The energy level EN = ¯hω(N + 1) corresponds to N + 1 possible
couples for (nx, ny): (N, 0), (N −1, 1), . . ., (0, N). The degeneracy is therefore
gN = N + 1.

222

21.2.3. We replace ˆx, ˆpx, ˆy, ˆpy by their values:
ˆx =

ˆpx = i

21.2.4. Making use of the action of the creation and annihilation operators,
one ﬁnds:


nx(ny + 1) |nx −1, ny + 1⟩
−

(nx + 1)ny |nx + 1, ny −1⟩

.
A state |nx, ny⟩is not, in general, an eigenstate of ˆLz and does not have a
well deﬁned angular momentum. The only exception is the state for which
nx = ny = 0, and ˆLz|0, 0⟩= 0. It is a state with Lz = 0.
21.2.5. We are now interested in ﬁnding another eigenbasis of ˆH0.
(a) The commutator of ˆH0 and ˆLz can be calculated using their expres-
sions in terms of the creation and annihilation operators. We ﬁrst calculate
[ˆnx, ˆa†
x] = ˆa†
x and [ˆnx, ˆax] = −ˆax, and the analogous relations for y. One
obtains:
[ ˆH0, ˆLz] = i¯h2ω [ˆnx + ˆny, ˆaxˆa†
y −ˆa†
xˆay]
= i¯h2ω

[ˆnx, ˆax]a†

= i¯h2ω

−ˆaxa†
y −ˆa†
xˆay + ˆaxa†
y + ˆa†
xˆay

= 0 .
This result is the consequence of the rotation invariance around the z axis of
the potential V (x, y). This can also be proven by using the polar coordinate
expression: ˆLz = −i¯h ∂
∂φ, which commutes with the two contributions to ˆH0
(kinetic and potential energy).
(b) There are 4 operators, and therefore 6 commutators to evaluate. We
ﬁrst remark that the two creation operators commute, and so do the two
annihilation operators. Therefore:
[ˆa†
l , ˆa†
r] = 0 ,
[ˆal, ˆar] = 0 .
A simple calculation leads to:

ˆal, ˆa†

2[ˆax, ˆa†

2[ˆay, ˆa†
y] = 1 .

21.6 Solutions
223
Finally, one ﬁnds:
"
ˆal, ˆa†

#

2[ˆax + iˆay, ˆa†
x + iˆa†
y] = 1
2[ˆax, ˆa†

2[ˆax, ˆa†

2[ˆay, ˆa†
y] = 0 .
Therefore, any “right” and “left” operators commute. The commutation rela-
tions between right (or left) creation and annihilation operators are the same
as for usual one-dimensional creation and annihilation operators.
(c) The commutation between the hermitian operators ˆnl and ˆnr is obvious,
since any left operator commutes with any right operator. The quantization of
the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator is entirely based on the commutation
relation [ˆa, ˆa†] = 1, which leads to the fact that the eigenvalues of ˆa†ˆa are
the non-negative integers. The same holds here for the operators ˆnl and ˆnr,
the corresponding eigenvalues are the couples of integers (nl, nr). As it is
suggested in the text, we assume for the moment that the common eigenbasis
of ˆnl and ˆnr is unique, and we note |nl, nr⟩the eigenvector corresponding to
the couple of eigenvalues (nl, nr).
(d) One ﬁnds:
ˆnl = 1

therefore
ˆH0 = ¯hω (ˆnl + ˆnr + 1) ,
ˆLz = ¯h (ˆnr −ˆnl) .
The operators ˆH0 and ˆLz can be expressed in terms of the sole operators
ˆnl and ˆnr. The eigenbasis common to ˆnl and ˆnr is therefore also a common
eigenbasis of ˆH0 and ˆLz.
(e) The vector |nl, nr⟩is the eigenstate of ˆH0 and ˆLz, with eigenvalues E =
¯hω(nl + nr + 1) and Lz = ¯h(nr −nl). We therefore have N = nl + nr and
m = nr −nl. We recover the integer values for the orbital angular momentum,
as expected. For a given N, the value of m belongs to the set {−N, −N +
2, . . . , N −2, N}, therefore there are N +1 possible values. We remark that in
an energy level EN, m has the same parity as N. This comes from the parity
invariance of the problem under consideration.
(f) The graphical representation is given on Fig. 21.3. On a given horizontal
line corresponding to a given energy value, one ﬁnds N + 1 points, which

Fig. 21.3. Allowed quantum numbers for the couple Lz, E
correspond to the degeneracy of an energy level of ˆH0 found previously. This
justiﬁes the fact that {ˆnl, ˆnr} form a CSCO. If two diﬀerent states would
correspond to the same couple of eigenvalues (nl, nr), the corresponding point
of the diagram would be twofold degenerate, and the degeneracy of the energy
level EN would be larger than N + 1.
21.2.6. We must ﬁnd in this subspace two eigenvectors of ˆLz corresponding to
the two eigenvalues ±¯h. A ﬁrst method for ﬁnding these eigenvectors consists
in calculating the action of ˆLz on the vectors of the basis {|nx, ny⟩}. Using
the expression of ˆLz in terms of ˆax, ˆay, . . ., one ﬁnds:
ˆLz|nx = 1, ny = 0⟩= i¯h |nx = 0, ny = 1⟩
ˆLz|nx = 0, ny = 1⟩= −i¯h |nx = 1, ny = 0⟩,
or the 2 × 2 matrix to diagonalize:

 0 −i¯h
i¯h
0

.
The eigenstates associated to the eigenvalues ±¯h are therefore:
(|nx = 1, ny = 0⟩± i|nx = 0, ny = 1⟩) /
√
2
.
Another method consists in starting from the ground state |nl = 0, nr =
0⟩and letting act on this state: (i) the operator ˆa†
r in order to obtain the
eigenvector of energy 2¯hω and angular momentum +¯h, (ii) the operator ˆa†
l in
order to obtain the eigenvector of energy 2¯hω and angular momentum −¯h. Of
course, we recover the previous result.

21.3.3.
(a) Two limiting regimes of the magnetic ﬁeld can be considered,
corresponding to the limits ωc ≪ω (very weak magnetic ﬁeld) and ωc ≫ω
(very strong magnetic ﬁeld). In the ﬁrst case, we have in ﬁrst order in B:
˜Enl,nr ≃¯hω(nl + nr) + ¯hωc(nr −nl)/2 ,
which corresponds to a linear variation in B of the N + 1 levels arising from
the level EN in the absence of the ﬁeld. The slope (¯hqB/(2µ) (nr −nl) is
diﬀerent for each level, which means that there is no degeneracy if B does not
vanish.
For strong ﬁelds, one ﬁnds
Ω+ ωc
2 ≃ωc ,
Ω−ωc
2 ≃ω2

≪ω .
We therefore have
˜Enl,nr ≃¯hωcnr
if
nr ̸= 0 ,
and
˜Enl,0 ≃¯hω2
ωc
nl .
For a non-vanishing nr, the energy level increases linearly with B, the slope
being proportional to nr. For nr = 0, the energy ˜E tends to zero as 1/B.
(b) The energy levels ˜Enl,nr corresponding to N = 0, 1, 2 are represented on
Fig. 21.4.

2 is
µω/(q
√
2) ≃26 T.
21.3.5. If we assume that the ﬁeld B is smaller than 21 T, the three ﬁrst
energy levels of ˆHB correspond to nl = nr = 0 (ground state of energy
¯hΩ), nl = 1, nr = 0 (energy 2¯hΩ−¯hωc/2), and nl = 0, nr = 1 (energy
2¯hΩ+ ¯hωc/2). These three states are eigenstates of ˆLz with the eigenvalues
0, −¯h and ¯h respectively.
Section 21.4:
Experimental Veriﬁcation
21.4.1. In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, we saw in question 1.2 that only
the level nx = ny = 0 is appreciably populated for T = 10 K. As the magnetic
ﬁeld increases, the energy splitting between the ground state and the ﬁrst
excited state diminishes but it stays much smaller than kBT if ωc is less
than ω/
√
2. For ωc = ω/
√
2, the splitting is ¯hω/
√
2. For that value, the ratio
between the populations of the ﬁrst excited state and the ground state is
r′ = exp(−49) = 3.7 × 10−22.
Since only the ground state is populated, all the detectable absorption lines
will occur from transition starting from this state.
21.4.2. The ﬁrst two absorption peaks correspond to the transitions |u0⟩↔
|u−⟩and |u0⟩↔|u+⟩. The corresponding frequencies ν± are such that
ν± = Ω
2π ± ωc
4π .

21.6 Solutions
227
The domain in B explored on the experimental ﬁgure of the text corresponds
to values of ωc which are small compared to ω. We can therefore use the
weak-ﬁeld expansion of question 3.3 in order to simplify this expression
ν± = ω
2π ± ωc
4π .
We therefore expect that the frequencies ν± will vary linearly with B, the
slopes being ±q/(4πµ), and that the two straight lines will cross for a vanishing
ﬁeld at the frequency ω/(2π).
This linear variation of ν± does appear on the ﬁgure for higher values of
B and the measured slope is close to the expected value (2 × 1011 Hz T−1).
However, the experimentally observed behavior for a very weak ﬁeld does not
correspond to our theoretical prediction. Instead of two lines of same frequency
for B = 0, there is a ﬁnite diﬀerence ν+ −ν−.
21.4.3. Role of the z Dimension
(a) The energy levels of an inﬁnite square well of size D are given by En =
π2¯h2n2/(2µD2), with n positive integer, the corresponding eigenstates are the
functions χn(z) ∝sin(nπz/D). The splitting between the ground state and
the ﬁrst excited state is ∆E = 3π2¯h2/(2µD2).
(b) In order to consider that the motion along z is “frozen”, the energy
splitting ∆E between the two ﬁrst levels of the square well must be very large
compared to ¯hω. If this condition is satisﬁed, the accessible states for the
electron conﬁned in the quantum box (in a reasonable domain of temperatures
and exciting frequencies) will be simply combinations of the vectors |nx, ny⟩⊗
|χ0⟩. It is then legitimate to neglect the dynamics of the electron along z.
If this condition is not satisﬁed, absorption lines can appear for frequencies
near those presented on the experimental ﬁgure. They will correspond to the
excitation of the motion along the z axis. The condition that the z motion be
“frozen” is
3π2¯h2
2µD2 ≫¯hω ,
or equivalently
D ≪πℓ0 .
(21.7)
(c) In order for the harmonic approximation of the transverse motion to
be valid, the transverse extension ∆L of the quantum box must be large
compared to ℓ0. The condition obtained in the previous question D ≪πℓ0,
put together with ℓ0 ≪∆L, imposes that the box must have a very ﬂat
geometrical shape: the height D along z must be very small compared to its
transverse extension in xy. We conclude that the vertical scale of the picture
21.1 is very dilated.

µω(1 −ϵ)/¯h. The corresponding eigenvalues are

where nx, ny are non-negative integers.
21.5.2. To ﬁrst order in B and ϵ, the shift of the ground state energy is given
by the matrix element
∆E0,0 = ⟨0, 0| ˆW|0, 0⟩= ωc
2 ⟨0, 0|ˆLz|0, 0⟩+ ϵµω2
2
⟨0, 0|ˆx2 −ˆy2|0, 0⟩.
The state |0, 0⟩is an eigenstate of ˆLz with eigenvalue 0. The ﬁrst term in this
sum therefore vanishes. By symmetry, we have ⟨0, 0|ˆx2|0, 0⟩= ⟨0, 0|ˆy2|0, 0⟩,
which means that the second term also vanishes, to ﬁrst order in ϵ and B.
21.5.3.
(a) We have already determined the matrix ˆLz in the basis under
consideration in question 2.6. We must calculate the matrix elements of ˆx2
and ˆy2. In order to do that, the simplest is to use the expressions of ˆx and ˆy
in terms of creation and annihilation operators. One has:
ˆx2 =
¯h
2µω (ˆax + ˆa†
x)(ˆax + ˆa†
x) ,
which leads to
⟨1, 0|ˆx2|1, 0⟩=

⟨0, 1|ˆx2|0, 1⟩=

where we have set |0, 1⟩≡|nx = 0, ny = 1⟩, etc. for simplicity. We obtain a
similar result by exchanging the roles of x and y. The restriction of ˆHB,ϵ in

(a) The variation of E±(B, ϵ) −E0,0 with B reproduces well the
experimental observations. For large values of B such that ϵ ω ≪ωc, we re-
cover the linear variation with B of the two transition frequencies. When B
tends to zero (ωc ≪ϵ ω), one ﬁnds two diﬀerent Bohr frequencies correspond-
ing respectively to the two transitions nx = ny = 0 →nx = 0, ny = 1 and
nx = ny = 0 →nx = 1, ny = 0.
(b) When B tends to zero, one ﬁnds experimentally that the limit of (ν+ −
ν−)/(ν+ + ν−) is of the order of 0.06. The theoretical prediction for this ratio
is ϵ/2. We therefore conclude that ϵ ≃0.12.

Quantum boxes of semiconductors, a simple model of which has been exam-
ined here, are the subject of many investigations both academic (Coulomb
correlations) and applied (optronics). Here we have only considered electronic
excitations, but collective modes in a lattice (phonons) also play an important
role in the dynamics of quantum boxes. It has been shown recently that the
two types of excitations are strongly coupled. This is in contrast with the usual
situation encountered in semiconductors, for which the coupling between the
electrons and the phonons is weak.
The data presented here come from S. Hameau et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 83,
4152 (1999).

Colored Molecular Ions
Some pigments are made of linear molecular ions, along which electrons move
freely. We derive here the energy levels of such an electronic system and we
show how this energy scheme explains the observed color of the pigments.
Consider molecular ions of the chemical formula (CnHn+2)−, which can
be considered as deriving from polyethylene molecules, such as hexatriene
CH2=CH-CH=CH-CH=CH2, with an even number of carbon atoms, by re-
moving a CH+ group. In an ion of this type, the bonds rearrange themselves
and lead to a linear structure of the following type:
(CH2 · · · CH · · · CH · · · CH · · · CH2)−,
(22.1)
with an odd number n of equally spaced carbon atoms separated by d = 1.4 ˚A.
In this structure, one can consider that the n+1 electrons of the double bonds
of the original polyethylene molecule move independently of one another in a
one-dimensional inﬁnite potential well of length Ln = nd:
V (x) = +∞
for
x < 0
or
x > Ln
= 0
for
0 ≤x ≤Ln .
(22.2)
Actually, one should write Ln = (n −1)d + 2b where b represents the edge
eﬀects. Experimentally, the choice b = d/2 appears to be appropriate.
22.1 Hydrocarbon Ions
22.1.1. What are the energy levels εk of an electron in this potential?
22.1.2. Owing to the Pauli principle, at most two electrons can occupy the
same energy level. What are the energies of the ground state E0 and of the
ﬁrst excited state E1 of the set of n + 1 electrons?
We recall that n
k=1 k2 = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6.

22.1.3. What is the wavelength λn of the light absorbed in a transition be-
tween the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state? One can introduce the
Compton wavelength of the electron: λC = h/(mec) = 2.426 × 10−2 ˚A.
22.1.4. Experimentally, one observes that the ions n = 9, n = 11 and n = 13
absorb blue light (λ9 ∼4700 ˚A), yellow light (λ11 ∼6000 ˚A) and red light
(λ13 ∼7300 ˚A), respectively. Is the previous model in agreement with this
observation? Are the ions n ≤7 or n ≥15 colored?
22.2 Nitrogenous Ions
One can replace the central CH group by a nitrogen atom, in order to form
ions of the type:
(CH2 · · · CH · · · N · · · CH · · · CH2)−.
(22.3)
The presence of the nitrogen atom does not change the distances between
atoms but it changes the above square well potential. The modiﬁcation con-
sists in adding a small perturbation δV (x), attractive and localized around
the nitrogen atom:
δV (x) = 0
for
|x −Ln
2 | > α/2
= −V0
for
|x −Ln
2 | ≤α/2 ,
where α/d ≪1 and V0 > 0.
22.2.1. Using ﬁrst order perturbation theory, give the variations δεk of the
energy level εk of an electron in the well. For convenience, give the result to
leading order in α/d.
22.2.2. Experimentally, one observes that, for the same value of n, the spec-
trum of the nitrogenous ions (22.3) is similar to that of the ions (22.1) but
that the wavelengths λN
n are systematically shorter (blue-shifted) if n = 4p+1,
and systematically longer (red-shifted) if n = 4p+3, than those λ0
n of the cor-
responding hydrocarbons (22.1). Explain this phenomenon and show that λN

and λ0
n are related by:

that the ion n = 9 absorbs violet light (λN
9 ∼4300 ˚A). What is the color of
the nitrogenous ion n = 13?
22.2.4. For suﬃciently large n, if the nitrogen atom is placed not in the
central site but on either of the two sites adjacent to the center of the chain,

one observes the reverse eﬀect, as compared to question 2.2. There is a red
shift for n = 4p + 1 and a blue shift for n = 4p + 3. Can you give a simple
explanation for this eﬀect?

For smaller n, the wavelengths λ7 = 3520 ˚A and λ5 = 2310 ˚A are in the
ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The ions n ≤7 do not absorb visible light
and are thus not colored.
For n ≥15, the wavelengths λ15 = 8550 ˚A and λ17 = 9830 ˚A are in the
infrared region. These ions do not absorb visible light in transitions from the
ground state to the ﬁrst excited state. They are nevertheless colored because
of transitions to higher excited states.

The (single particle) energy levels corresponding to even values of k are prac-
tically unaﬀected by the perturbation; only those with k odd are shifted. This
is simple to understand. For k even, the center of the chain is a node of the
wave function, and the integral deﬁning δεk is negligible. For k odd, on the
contrary, the center is an antinode, we integrate over a maximum of the wave
function, and the perturbation is maximum.
22.2.2. The perturbation to the excitation energy E1 −E0 of question 1.2 is
δE = δε(n+3)/2 −δε(n+1)/2 .

(n + 1)/2 even, i.e. n = 4p + 3, δε(n+1)/2 = 0,

(n + 1)/2 odd, i.e. n = 4p + 1, δε(n+3)/2 = 0,
δE = −δε(n+1)/2 = 2V0α

For n = 4p+1, the perturbation increases the excitation energy, and decreases
λn. For n = 4p + 3, it decreases the excitation energy, and increases λn.
22.2.3. For the ion n = 11 one obtains the relation (1 −11γ/13) = 6000/6700,
therefore γ ∼0.12 and λN
9 = 4330 ˚A, in good agreement with experiment. One
also obtains λN
13 = 6600 ˚A, which absorbs red light and gives a green color
to the corresponding pigment. Note that the presence of the nitrogen atom
yields λN
13 ≤λN
11 whereas λ0
13 > λ0
11.
22.2.4. The distance between a node and an antinode of ψk(x) is δx =
nd/(2k).
For k = (n + 1)/2 and k = (n + 3)/2 which are the states of interest,
we will have respectively δx = nd/(n + 1) and δx = nd/(n + 3), i.e. δx ∼d
if n is large. Consequently, if a wave function has a node at the center, it
has an antinode in the vicinity of the two adjacent sites, and vice versa. The
argument is therefore similar to the answer to questions 2.1 and 2.2, with the
reverse eﬀect. The lines are red-shifted if n = 4p + 1 and they are blue-shifted
if n = 4p + 3.

Hyperﬁne Structure
in Electron Spin Resonance
Many molecular species, such as free radicals, possess an unpaired electron.
The magnetic spin resonance of this electron, called electron spin resonance
(ESR) as opposed to nuclear magnetic resonance, provides useful information
about the electronic structure of the molecule, as we shall see in this chapter.
We assume here the following:
1. Spin variables and space variables are independent, both for electrons and
for nuclei; we are only interested in the former.
2. The spatial ground state of the unpaired electron is non-degenerate, and
one can neglect the eﬀect of a magnetic ﬁeld on its wave function.
3. We only take into account the following magnetic spin interactions: (a)
the Zeeman interaction of spin magnetic moments with an external ﬁeld
B, and (b) the hyperﬁne interaction between the outer electron and the
nuclei.
4. For a given nucleus in the molecule, the hyperﬁne interaction has the form
ˆHHF = (A/¯h2) ˆS · ˆI = (A/4)ˆσe · ˆσn where ˆS = ¯hˆσe/2 is the electron spin
and ˆI = ¯hˆσn/2 is the nuclear spin; ˆσe and ˆσn are the Pauli matrices
which act respectively in the Hilbert spaces of the electron and of the
nucleus. The constant A is given by
A = −2
3 µ0 γe γn ¯h2|ψ(rn)|2 ,
where µ0 = 1/ϵ0c2 is the magnetic susceptibility of vacuum, γe and γn
are the gyromagnetic factors of the electron and of the nucleus under
consideration, and ψ(rn) is the value of the electron wave function at the
position rn of this nucleus.
5. In all the problem, the system is considered to be in a constant uniform
magnetic ﬁeld B directed along the z axis. For simplicity, we set A = ¯ha,
ωe = −γeB, ωn = −γnB and η = (ωe −ωn)/2.
The numerical values of gyromagnetic ratios are

23 Hyperﬁne Structure in Electron Spin Resonance
electron:
γe/(2π) = −28.024 GHz T−1 ,
proton:
γp/(2π) = +42.574 MHz T−1 .
23.1 Hyperﬁne Interaction with One Nucleus
23.1.1. We ﬁrst consider a species where the nuclei do not possess a magnetic
moment, so that there is no hyperﬁne interaction.
Write the Zeeman interaction Hamiltonian of the electron with the mag-
netic ﬁeld B.
What are the energy levels of the system?
What is the value of the frequency that can excite the system? Give its
numerical value for a magnetic ﬁeld of 1 Tesla.
23.1.2. We now assume that the molecule has one spin-1/2 nucleus. We note
the (factorized) eigenbasis common to ˆSz and ˆIz as {|σe; σn⟩} with σe = ±1
and σn = ±1.
(a) Write the complete spin Hamiltonian.
(b) Calculate the action of σe · σn on the vectors of the basis {|σe; σn⟩}.
(c) Write the matrix form of the Hamiltonian in this basis, and calculate its
eigenvalues.
23.1.3. From now on, we assume that the magnetic ﬁeld B is strong, in the
sense that |ωe| ≫|a|.
(a) Give the approximate form of the eigenvalues to ﬁrst order in a/η.
(b) Recover these results by ﬁrst diagonalizing the electron Zeeman Hamil-
tonian, and by treating the other terms, i.e. the nuclear Zeeman Hamil-
tonian and the hyperﬁne interaction, in ﬁrst order perturbation theory.
What are the corresponding eigenstates (to zeroth order in a/η)?
(c) One can show that the transitions that an electromagnetic ﬁeld can in-
duce occur only between states which diﬀer by the value of a single spin
(for instance, the transitions |+; −⟩→|−; +⟩are forbidden). Under these
conditions, what are the observable transition frequencies, knowing that
all transitions which are not forbidden actually occur? Classify these tran-
sitions in two sets corresponding respectively to nuclear and to electronic
spin transitions.
(d) Calculate these frequencies numerically for the hydrogen atom in a ﬁeld
B = 1 T. We recall that, in this case, A/(2π¯h) ≃1.420 GHz.
23.2 Hyperﬁne Structure with Several Nuclei
We now assume that the molecule has N protons in hydrogen atoms located
on sites r1, . . . , rN, whose spins are denoted ˆI1, . . . , ˆIN.
The Hilbert space of spin degrees of freedom is of dimension 2N+1. It is
spanned by the set:

23.3 Experimental Results
239
{|σe; σ1, σ2, . . . , σN⟩} ≡{|σe⟩⊗|σ1⟩⊗|σ2⟩⊗· · · ⊗|σN⟩}
with σe = ±1 and σk = ±1, k = 1, . . . , N. This set is an orthonor-
mal eigenbasis common to the z projection of the spin observables ˆSz and
ˆIkz, k = 1, . . . , N, of the N + 1 particles.
23.2.1. Let Ak = ¯hak be the hyperﬁne constant of proton k. Write the ex-
pression for the spin Hamiltonian of the system (we recall that the magnetic
nucleus–nucleus interaction is neglected).
23.2.2. Show that the restriction of this Hamiltonian to each eigen-subspace
of ˆSz is diagonal.
23.2.3. Assuming, as in 1.3, that the ﬁeld is strong, calculate the eigenvalues
in ﬁrst order perturbation theory, and the corresponding eigenstates.
23.2.4. What are the observable electron spin transition frequencies? How
many lines corresponding to these frequencies should the spectrum display in
principle?
23.2.5. What is the number of lines and the multiplicity of each of them
(i.e. the number of transitions at the same frequency) if all the protons are
equivalent, i.e. if all the |ψ(rk)|2, and therefore the coeﬃcients ak, are equal?
23.2.6. What is the number of lines and their multiplicities, if there exist two
sets of equivalent protons, one with p protons corresponding to the constant
ap, the other with q = N −p protons, corresponding to the constant aq?
23.3 Experimental Results
Experimentally, one measures the positions and the intensities of the absorp-
tion lines in the microwave region. An absorption line appears as a peak in
the absorbed intensity α(ν) as a function of the frequency, whose qualitative
shape is shown in Fig. 23.1.
It can be shown that the intensity of an absorption peak at a given fre-
quency is proportional to the number of transitions (multiplicity of the line)
which can occur at that frequency. For experimental convenience, one ﬁxes
the frequency of the microwave at a given value, and one varies the magnetic
ﬁeld B. This results in an absorption curve α(B).
23.3.1. Figure 23.2 shows the spectrum of the free radical •CH3 (methyl)
(J.N. Chazalviel, private communication). The carbon nucleus does not pos-
sess any magnetic moment; only the protons of the hydrogen atoms give rise
to hyperﬁne interactions.
(a) Interpret this spectrum qualitatively. Explain the number of lines and
their relative intensities. How many diﬀerent coeﬃcients ak are there?

electron in this molecule. It is convenient to express the result in terms of

23.3.2. Answer the same questions for the spectrum of CH3−•COH−COO−
(the radical ion of lactic acid) shown in Fig. 23.3. Neither the oxygen nor the
carbon nuclei carry magnetic moments. The only hyperﬁne interaction arises,
again, from the protons of the hydrogen atoms.

|+; −⟩↔|−; −⟩
∆E = ¯h(ωe −a/2),
ν = |ωe −a/2|/(2π) .
(d) For B = 1 T, νn = 42.6 MHz; a/(2π) = A/(2π¯h) = 1420 MHz;
νe = 28.024 GHz. The nuclear transitions occur at ν1 = 753 MHz and
ν2 = 667 MHz, the electronic transitions occur at ν1 = 28.734 GHz and

Experimental Results
23.3.1. The experimental results conﬁrm the above analysis.
1. For •CH3 there are 4 equally spaced lines of relative intensities 1 : 3 : 3 : 1.
This is in perfect agreement with the fact that the three protons of •CH3
are obviously equivalent. All the Ak coeﬃcients are equal.

2. For a ﬁxed ω, one gets by considering two consecutive lines, for instance
the center lines: a/2 −γeB1 = −a/2 −γeB2 so that a = γe(B1 −B2). We

Hydrogen = 65/1420 ∼0.045 .
In the radical •CH3, the probability that the outer electron is on top of
a proton is smaller by a factor 3 × 0.045 = 0.135 than in the hydrogen
atom.
23.3.2. In the case of CH3−•COH−COO−, there are four dominant lines,
each of which is split into two. This agrees with the fact that, in the molecule
CH3−•COH−COO−, the 3 protons of the CH3 group are equivalent and have
the same hyperﬁne constant a1 whereas the proton of the •COH group has a
diﬀerent constant a2 which is noticeably smaller than a1.
A calculation similar to the previous one gives |ψ(rk)|2/|ψ(0)|2
Hydrogen ∼

Probing Matter with Positive Muons
A very eﬃcient technique for probing the structure of crystals consists in
forming, inside the material, pseudo hydrogenic atoms made of an electron
and a positive muon, and called muonium. This chapter is devoted to the
study of the dynamics of muonium, both in vacuum and in a silicon crystal.
The positive muon is a spin-1/2 particle which has the same charge as
the proton. The muon mass is considerably larger than the electron mass:
mµ/me = 206.77. The muon is unstable and decays with a lifetime τ = 2.2µs.
Its use in probing the structure of crystals is based on the rotation of its spin,
once a muonium atom is formed:
•
It is possible to form muonium atoms in a quantum state such that, at
t = 0, the spin state of the µ+ is known.
•
Using a technique of particle physics, one can measure its spin state at a
later time t.
•
The rotation of the muon spin can be related to the hyperﬁne structure
of the 1s level of muonium.
Therefore, the muonium constitutes a local probe, sensitive to electric and
magnetic ﬁelds in its vicinity. One can obtain in this way information on
the structure of the medium by methods analogous to magnetic resonance
experiments.
In the ﬁrst part of the chapter, we sketch the principle of the method
by studying muonium in vacuum. When the method was ﬁrst applied to a
silicon crystal, in 1973, the results seemed anomalous. We shall see in the
second section how these results were understood, in 1978, as being due to
the anisotropy of crystalline media.
Throughout this chapter, the muon will be considered as stable. For sim-
plicity, we set
ˆµµ+ ≡ˆµ1 = µ1 ˆσ1
ˆµe ≡ˆµ2 = µ2 ˆσ2 ,
where the (x, y, z) components of ˆσ1 and ˆσ2 are the Pauli matrices.
Numerical values of interest are:

24 Probing Matter with Positive Muons
mµc2 = 105.66 MeV
µ1/h = 67.5 MHz T−1
mec2 = 0.511 MeV
µ2/h = −1.40 × 104 MHz T−1 .
24.1 Muonium in Vacuum
Muonium is formed by slowing down a beam of µ+, prepared in a given spin
state, in a thin metal foil. A suﬃciently slow µ+ can capture an electron and
form a hydrogen-like atom in an excited state. This atom falls into its ground
state very quickly (in ∼10−9 s), the muon’s spin state remaining the same
during this process. Once it is formed, the muonium, which is electrically
neutral, can diﬀuse outside the metal.
We assume that, at t = 0, the state of the muonium atom is the following:
•
The muon spin is in the eigenstate | + z⟩≡|+⟩of ˆσ1z.
•
The electron spin is in an arbitrary state α|+⟩+β|−⟩, with |α|2+|β|2 = 1.
•
The wave fuction Ψ(r) of the system is the 1s wave function of the
hydrogen-like system, ψ100(r).
Just as for the hyperﬁne structure of hydrogen, we work in the 4 dimen-
sional Hilbert space corresponding to the spin variables of the electron and
the muon. In this Hilbert space, the spin–spin interaction Hamiltonian is
ˆH = E0 −2
3
µ0
4π |ψ100(0)|2 ˆµ1 · ˆµ2 = E0 + A
4 ˆσ1 · ˆσ2 ,
where the indices 1 and 2 refer respectively to the muon and to the electron,
and where E0 = −mrc2α2/2, with mr being the reduced mass of the (e, µ)
system.
24.1.1. Write the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian ˆH in the basis
{|σ1z, σ2z⟩, σiz = ±}.
24.1.2. Knowing the value of A in the hydrogen atom: A/h = 1420 MHz,
calculate A in muonium. We recall that µ1 = q¯h/(2mµ) for the muon, µ2 =
−q¯h/(2me) for the electron, µp = 2.79 q¯h/(2mp) for the proton, where q is
the unit charge and mp = 1836.1 me.
24.1.3. Write the general form of an eigenstate of ˆσ1z with eigenvalue +1:
(i) in the basis {|σ1z, σ2z⟩}; (ii) in the eigenbasis of ˆH.
24.1.4. We assume that, at t = 0, the system is in a state |ψ(0)⟩of the type
deﬁned above. Calculate |ψ(t)⟩at a later time.
24.1.5.
(a) Show that the operators ˆπ± = (1± ˆσ1z)/2 are the projectors on
the eigenstates of ˆσ1z corresponding to the eigenvalues ±1.
(b) Calculate for the state |ψ(t)⟩the probability p(t) that the muon spin is
in the state |+⟩at time t. Write the result in the form

24.2 Muonium in Silicon
247
p(t) = q p+(t) + (1 −q) p−(t) ,
where p+ (or p−) is the probability that one obtains if the electron is
initially in the eigenstate of σ2z with eigenvalue +1 (or −1), and where
q is a probability, as yet undeﬁned.
24.1.6. In practice, the electronic spins are unpolarized. A rigorous treatment
of the problem then requires a statistical description in terms of a density
operator. To account for this nonpolarization in a simpler way, we shall set
heuristically that the observed probability ¯p(t) corresponds to q = 1/2 in the
above formula.
Using this prescription, give the complete expression for ¯p(t).
24.2 Muonium in Silicon
We now form muonium in a silicon crystal suﬃciently thick that the muonium
does not escape. The muonium stops in an interstitial position inside the
crystal lattice, the nearest atoms forming a plane hexagonal mesh around it.
The global eﬀect of the interactions between the atoms of the crystal and the
muonium atom is to break the spherical symmetry of the spin–spin interaction,
but to preserve the rotational symmetry around the z axis perpendicular to
the plane of the mesh.
We therefore consider the Hamiltonian
ˆH = E0 + A′
4 ˆσ1 · ˆσ2 + D ˆσ1z ˆσ2z ,
where the constant A′ may diﬀer from A since the presence of neighboring
atoms modiﬁes the Coulomb potential and, therefore, the wave function at
the origin. The constants A′ and D will be determined experimentally; their
sign is known: A′ > 0, D < 0.
24.2.1. Calculate the spin energy levels and the corresponding eigenstates of
the muonium trapped in the silicon crystal.
24.2.2. We now reconsider the spin rotation experiment with the following
modiﬁcations:
• Initially the µ+ spin is now in the eigenstate | + x⟩of σx.
• We want to know the probability of ﬁnding the µ+ spin in this same
eigenstate | + x⟩at time t.
One can proceed as in question 1.5:
(a) Calculate in the {|σ1, σ2⟩} basis the states |ψ+(t)⟩and |ψ−(t)⟩which are
initially eigenstates of ˆσ2z (ˆσ2z is the projection of the electron spin along
the z axis).
(b) Evaluate ⟨ψϵ(t)|ˆσ1x|ψϵ(t)⟩, where ϵ = ±.

248
24 Probing Matter with Positive Muons
(c) Consider the projector ˆπx = (1 + ˆσ1x)/2 , and deduce from the previous
question the probabilities p±(t).
(d) Calculate the measured probability ¯p(t) = (p+(t) + p−(t))/2.
24.2.3. Comparison with experiment: Present day technology in data
processing allows one to determine not p(t) itself, but a quantity which is
easier to deal with, the characteristic function g(ω) = Re(f(ω)) where
f(ω) = 1

¯p(t) e−t/τ eiωt dt

recall that D < 0).

In ﬁrst approximation, muonium and hydrogen have similar sizes and wave
functions, since the muon is much heavier than the electron. Therefore we
obtain A ≃AH(mp/2.79 mµ) and A/h ≃4519 MHz.
The reduced mass correction to the value of the wave function at the origin
is straightforward to calculate. It is of the order of 1% and it leads to
A
h = 4519 (1 −0.0126) = 4462 MHz .
This value is very close to the observed 4463MHz, the diﬀerence being due to
relativistic eﬀects.
24.1.3. The state under consideration can be written as
|ψ⟩= |+⟩⊗(α|+⟩+ β|−⟩)
with
|α|2 + |β|2 = 1 .
Equivalently, one can write it as |ψ⟩= α| + +⟩+ β| + −⟩.

where the only constraint on α and β is |α|2 + |β|2 = 1.

(b) The probability of ﬁnding the muon spin in the state |+⟩at time t is by
deﬁnition
p(t) = ∥ˆπ+|ψ(t)⟩∥2 = ⟨ψ(t)|ˆπ+|ψ(t)⟩.

Squaring the norm of ˆπ+|ψ(t)⟩, we get

There is a periodic modulation of the probability of observing the muon spin
aligned with the positive z axis, which can be interpreted as a rotation of the
muon spin with frequency ν = A/h.

24.3 Solutions

• The probability p+(t) corresponds to the initial state |ψ(0)⟩= |++⟩. This
is a stationary state so that p(t) ≡p+(t) = 1 in this case.

2. There is in this case an oscillation with
a 100 % modulation between | + −⟩and | −+⟩, so that p(t) ≡p−(t) =
cos2(At/2(¯h)).
Therefore the result can be cast in the form suggested in the text:
p(t) = q p+(t) + (1 −q) p−(t) ,
with q = |α|2.
24.1.6. When the electronic spins are unpolarized, we obtain following the

Note: The rigorous way to treat partially polarized systems is based on the
density operator formalism. In the present case the density operator for the

so that the initial density operator for the muonium is:

24.2.3. Comparison with Experiment: In practice, the time t corre-

two neutrinos. The positron is suﬃciently energetic and leaves the crystal.
It is emitted preferentially in the muon spin direction. One therefore mea-
sures the direction where the positron is emitted as a function of time. For
N0 incoming muons, the number of positrons emitted in the x direction is
dN(t) = N0¯p(t)e−t/τdt/τ, where τ is the muon lifetime.
A convenient way to analyse the signal, and to extract the desired frequen-
cies, consists in taking the Fourier transform of the above signal. Deﬁning

The function Re(f0(ω)) has a peak at ω = 0 whose half width is 1/τ, which
corresponds to 100 kHz.
(a) The curve of Fig. 24.1 is consistent with this observation. Besides the
peak at ω = 0, we ﬁnd two peaks at ω1 = −2D/¯h and ω2 = (A′ + 2D)/¯h.
Assuming that D is negative, which can be conﬁrmed by a more thorough
analysis, one obtains
2D/h = −37.25 MHz
and
A′/h = 92.1 MHz .
(b) In general, one expects to see peaks at all frequencies ωi −ωj, and in
particular at ω2−ω3 = −A′/¯h. In order to observe the corresponding peak, one
must measure the µ+ spin projection along a direction which is not orthogonal
to the z axis. This leads to a term in cos (ω2 −ω3)t in ¯p(t), which appears in
Fig. 24.1.

Quantum Reﬂection of Atoms
from a Surface
This chapter deals with the reﬂection of very slow hydrogen atoms from a
surface of liquid helium. In particular, we estimate the sticking probability
of the atoms onto the surface. This sticking proceeds via the excitation of a
surface wave, called a ripplon. We show that this probability must vanish at
low temperatures, and that, in this limit, the reﬂection of the atoms on the
surface is specular.
In all the chapter, the position of a particle is deﬁned by its coordinates r =
(x, y) in a horizontal plane, and its altitude z. The altitude z = 0 represents
the position of the surface of the liquid He bath at rest. The wave functions
ψ(r, z) of the H atoms are normalized in a rectangular box of volume LxLyLz.
We write m for the mass of a H atom (m = 1.67 10−27 kg).
25.1 The Hydrogen Atom–Liquid Helium Interaction
Consider a H atom above a liquid He bath at rest (cf Fig. 25.1). We model
the H-liquid He interaction as the sum of pairwise interactions between the H
atom at point (R, Z) (Z > 0), and the He atoms at (r, z), with z < 0:
V0(Z) = n


(R −r)2 + (Z −z)2) Θ(−z)
where n is the number of He atoms per unit volume, and Θ is the Heaviside
function.
25.1.1. We recall the form of the Van der Waals potential:
U(d) = −C6
d6 ,
which describes the long distance interaction between a H atom and a He atom
separated by a distance d. Show that the long distance potential between the
H atom and the liquid He bath is of the form:

Express α in terms of C6 and n.
25.1.2. Experimentally, one ﬁnds α = 1.9 × 10−2eV ˚A3. At what distance
from the surface does gravity become larger than the Van der Waals force? In
what follows, we shall neglect the gravitational force.
25.1.3. Show that the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian which describes the
motion of the H atom are of the form |k⊥, φσ⟩, where k⊥represents a plane
running wave propagating in the plane Oxy, i.e. parallel to the surface of the
liquid He, and where φσ is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian which describes
the motion along the z axis:
⟨R, Z|k⊥, φσ⟩=

25.1.4. We want to evaluate the number of bound states of the motion along
the z axis in the potential:

Z > zmin
V0(Z) = +∞
if

We shall use the WKB approximation.

(d) Infer the order of magnitude of the number of bound states as a function
of zmin and α. What is the domain of validity of the result?
(e) The parameter zmin for the surface of liquid He is of the order of 2 ˚A.
How many bound states does one expect for the motion along the z axis?
(f) Experimentally, one ﬁnds that there is a single bound state H–liquid He,
whose energy is E0 = −8.6×10−5 eV. Compare this result with the WKB
prediction. This unique bound state in the z-axis motion will be denoted
φ0 in the rest of the chapter.
25.2 Excitations on the Surface of Liquid Helium
The general dispersion relation for waves propagating on the surface of a liquid
is
ω2
q = gq + A
ρ0
q3
with q = |q| ,
where ωq and q = (qx, qy) are, respectively, the frequency and the wave vector
of the surface wave, g is the acceleration of gravity and A and ρ0 represent
the surface tension and the mass density of the liquid.
25.2.1. Discuss the nature of the surface waves (capillary waves or gravity
waves) according to the value of the wavelength λ = 2π/q. Perform the nu-
merical application in the case of liquid He: ρ0 = 145 kg m−3, A = 3.5 × 10−4
Jm−2.
25.2.2. Hereafter, we are only interested in waves for which ¯hωq ≃|E0|.
Show that these are always capillary waves and give their wavelengths. In
what follows we shall use the simpler dispersion relation ω2
q = (A/ρ0)q3.
25.2.3. In order to quantize these surface waves, we introduce the bosonic
operators rq and r†
q corresponding to the annihilation and the creation of
an excitation quantum. These elementary excitations are called ripplons. The
Hamiltonian which describes these excitations is:1
HS =
qmax

q
¯hωqˆr†
q ˆrq .
The altitude h(r) of the liquid surface at point r = (x, y) becomes a two-
dimensional scalar ﬁeld operator:
ˆh(r) =
qmax

q
hq(r†
q e−iq.r + rq eiq.r)
with
hq =
 
¯hq

.
1 The summation over q is limited to q < qmax where qmax is of the order of a
fraction of an inverse ˚Angstrom. For larger values of q, hence smaller wavelengths,
the description of the vicinity of the surface in terms of a ﬂuid does not hold any
longer.

25 Quantum Reﬂection of Atoms from a Surface
Evaluate, at zero temperature, the r.m.s. altitude ∆h of the position of the

Numerical application: qmax = 0.5 ˚A−1.
25.3 Quantum Interaction Between H and Liquid He
We now investigate the modiﬁcations to the H–liquid He potential arising
from the possible motion of the surface of the liquid helium bath. In order to
do so, we replace the coupling considered above by
V (R, Z) = n

d2r

dz U(

(R −r)2 + (Z −z)2) Θ(ˆh(r) −z) .
25.3.1. Expand V (R, Z) to ﬁrst order in ˆh and interpret the result.
25.3.2. Replacing ˆh(r) by its expansion in terms of operators ˆrq, ˆr†
q, cast
V (R, Z) in the form:
V (R, Z) = V0(Z) +

q + h.c.

with
Vq(Z) = n

25.3.3. Introducing the creation operators ˆa†
k,σ and the annihilation opera-
tors ˆak,σ of a hydrogen atom in an eigenstate of the motion in the potential
V0(Z), write in second quantization the total hydrogen–ripplon Hamiltonian
to ﬁrst order in ˆh.
25.4 The Sticking Probability
We consider a H atom in an asymptotically free state in the z direction (i.e.
behaving as e±ikσz as z →+∞). This state denoted |k⊥, φσ⟩has an energy
Ei = ¯h2
2m(k2
⊥+ k2
σ) .
We now calculate the probability that this atom sticks on the surface, which
is assumed here at zero temperature.

25.5 Solutions
259
25.4.1. How does the matrix element ⟨φ0|Vq|φσ⟩vary with the size of the
normalization box? We assume in the following that this matrix element is
proportional to kσ if kσ is suﬃciently small, and we introduce M(q) such that
⟨φ0|Vq|φσ⟩=
¯hkσ
√2mLz
M(q) .
All following results will be expressed in terms of M(q).
25.4.2. Using Fermi’s Golden Rule, deﬁne a probability per unit time for an
atom to stick on the surface. In order to do so, one will deﬁne properly:
(a) the continuum of ﬁnal states;
(b) the conditions imposed by energy conservation. For simplicity, we shall
assume that the incident energy Ei is negligible compared to the bound
state energy E0. Show that the emitted ripplon has a wave vector q such
that |q| = q0 with:
¯h
 
A
ρ0
q3/2

r2m = |E0| ;
(c) the density of ﬁnal states.
25.4.3. Express the ﬂux of incident atoms in terms of ¯h, kσ, m and Lz.
25.4.4. Write the expression for the probability that the hydrogen atom
sticks on the surface of the liquid helium bath in terms of ¯h, q0, A, ρ0, kσ and
M(q). Check that this probability is independent of the normalization volume
LxLyLz.
25.4.5. How does this probability vary with the energy of the incident hy-
drogen atoms?
25.4.6. Describe qualitatively how one should modify the above treatment if
the liquid helium bath is not at zero temperature.
25.5 Solutions
Section 25.1:
The Hydrogen Atom–Liquid Helium Interaction
25.1.1. We use cylindrical coordinates, assuming that the H atom is at R =
0. The potential V0(Z) takes the form

Therefore
V0(Z) = −α
Z3
with

25.1.2. The force which derives from V0(Z) has modulus
F(Z) = 3α
Z4 .
We have 3α/Z4
g = Mg for Zg = (3α/(Mg))1/4. The numerical application
yields Zg = 0.86 µm which is very large on the atomic scale. For all the
relevant H–liquid He distances, which are between 0.1 nm and 1 nm, gravity
can be neglected.
25.1.3. The Hamiltonian can be split as ˆH = ˆH⊥+ ˆHZ, where
ˆH⊥= ˆp2
x
2m + ˆp2
y
2m
and
ˆHZ = ˆp2
z
2m + V0( ˆZ) .
These two Hamiltonians commute and the eigenbasis of the total Hamiltonian
ˆH is factorized as a product |k⊥, φσ⟩of (i) the eigenstates of ˆH⊥, where k⊥
represents the wave vector of a plane running wave propagating in the (x, y)
plane, and (ii) the eigenstates φσ of ˆHZ which describes the motion along the
z axis.
25.1.4.
(a) For Z ≤zmin, the overlap of the electron wave functions of the
H and He atoms causes a repulsion between these atoms, which is modeled
here by a hard core potential. For Z ≫zmin, the Van der Waals forces are
dominant.
(b) For Z ≤zmin, the wave function φ(Z) is such that φ(Z) = 0. Since φ(Z)
is continuous, we have φ(zmin) = 0.
(c) For a turning point b, the WKB eigenfunction of energy E has the fol-
lowing form in the allowed region (E > V0(Z)):
φ(Z) =

where Int denotes the integer part and where k(Z) is calculated for a zero

is good if the number of bound states is large. We can take in this case:
n ≃π−1  ∞
zmin k(Z′) dZ′ with ¯hk(Z) =

2mα/Z3, which yields
n ≃2
π¯h
	
2mα

.
(e) The above formula yields n ≃1.36. We therefore expect a number of
bound states close to 1, say between 0 and 2.
(f) The experimental result compares favorably with the WKB. prediction,
but it is beyond the validity of the WKB approximation to give a correct
expression for φ0(Z).
Section 25.2:

25.2.1. The two terms of the dispersion relation are equal if q =

equivalently, for a wavelength

Numerically, one obtains λ = 3 mm. Therefore, we observe capillary waves
(ω2
q ≃Aq3/ρ0) for λ ≪3 mm, and gravity waves (ω2
q ≃gq) for λ ≫3 mm.
For λ = 3 mm the corresponding energy is ¯hωq = 1.3 × 10−13 eV.
25.2.2. For an energy such that |E0| ≫10−13 eV, we are therefore in the
regime of capillary waves, with the wavelength:

which yields ∆h = 0.94 ˚A.
Section 25.3:
Quantum Interaction Between H and Liquid He
25.3.1. Using the fact that Θ′(z) = δ(z), we can write Θ(−z + ˆh(r)) ≃
Θ(−z) + ˆh(r)δ(z) since the δ function is even. Therefore, we obtain
V (R, Z) ≃V0(Z) + n

d2r U(

(R −r)2 + Z2) ˆh(r) .
In this expression, the second term describes the interaction with the “ad-
ditional” or “missing” atoms on the surface as compared to the equilibrium
position z = 0.
25.3.2. Replacing ˆh(r) by its expansion we obtain

variance of the problem. This can be seen directly on the form of the coupling
ˆa†
k,σˆak+q,σ′ˆr†
q ,
which annihilates a H atom with momentum ¯h(k + q) term, and creates a H
atom with momentum ¯hk and a ripplon with momentum ¯hq.
Section 25.4:
The Sticking Probability
25.4.1. We have by deﬁnition
⟨φ0|Vq|φσ⟩=

φ∗
0(Z) Vq(Z) φσ(Z) dZ .
Since |φσ⟩is an asymptotically free state, it is normalized in a segment of
length Lz. Therefore its amplitude varies as L−1/2
z
. Since |φ0⟩is a localized
state which does not depend on Lz, we ﬁnd
⟨φ0|Vq|φσ⟩∝
1
√
Lz
.
The fact that this matrix element is proportional to kσ in the limit of small
incident momenta is more subtle. The positions Z contributing to the matrix
element are close to zero, since the bound state φ0(Z) is localized in the
vicinity of the He surface. Therefore only the values of φσ(Z) around Z = 0
are relevant for the calculation of the integral. For the Z−3 potential between
the H atom and the He surface, one ﬁnds that the amplitude of φσ in this
region is proportional to kσ, hence the result. Such a linear dependance can
be recovered analytically by replacing the Z−3 potential by a square well, but
is out of reach of the WKB approximation, which would predict a dependance
in √kσ for the amplitude around Z = 0 of φσ. The reason for this discrepancy
is that the potential in −αZ−3 is too stiﬀfor the WKB to be valid for the
calculation of φσ at distances larger than mα/¯h2.

264
25 Quantum Reﬂection of Atoms from a Surface
25.4.2. We start with the initial state k⊥, φσ. If the atom sticks to the sur-
face, the ﬁnal state along the z axis is |φ0⟩. The sticking proceeds via the
emission of a ripplon of momentum ¯hq and a change of the transverse mo-
mentum ¯hk⊥→¯hk⊥−¯hq.
(a) The continuum of ﬁnal states is characterized by the vector q:
|k⊥, φσ⟩→|k⊥−q, φ0⟩⊗|q⟩.
(b) Energy conservation gives Ei = Ef with:
Ei = ¯h2(k2
σ + k2
⊥)
2m
Ef = E0 + ¯h2(k⊥−q)2
2m
+ ¯hωq .
We suppose that Ei is negligible compared to the bound state energy E0.
Therefore ¯h2(k⊥· q)/m ∼

|E0|¯h2k2
⊥/(2m) is also very small compared to
|E0|, and we obtain:
¯h2q2
2m + ¯hωq ≃|E0| .
This equation, in addition to the dispersion relation for ripplons, determines
the modulus q0 of q:
¯h

25.4.3. The number of atoms which cross a plane of altitude Z in the direc-
tion Z < 0 during a time interval dt is vzdt/(2Lz) = ¯hkσdt/(2mLz). The ﬂux
is therefore:
Φσ =
¯hkσ
2mLz
.
25.4.4. The sticking probability is the ratio of the probability per unit time,
given by Fermi’s Golden Rule, and the incident ﬂux:
P = 2π
¯h |⟨k⊥, φσ|V |k⊥−q, φ0, q⟩|2 ρ(Ef) 2mLz

.
This reduces to
P =
mkσ|M(q)|2
3Am + 2¯h√Aρ0q0
.
25.4.5. P varies as kσ ∝
√
E. At very small energies, the sticking probability
goes to zero and the H atoms bounce elastically on the liquid He surface.
25.4.6. If the liquid helium bath is not at zero temperature, other processes
can occur, in particular a sticking process accompanied by the stimulated
emission of a ripplon. One must therefore take into account the number nq0
of thermal ripplons.

Laser Cooling and Trapping
By shining laser light onto an assembly of neutral atoms or ions, it is possible
to cool and trap these particles. In this chapter we study a simple cooling
mechanism, Doppler cooling, and we derive the corresponding equilibrium
temperature. We then show that the cooled atoms can be conﬁned in the
potential well created by a focused laser beam.
We consider a “two state” atom, whose levels are denoted |g⟩(ground
state) and |e⟩(excited state), with respective energies 0 and ¯hω0. This atom
interacts with a classical electromagnetic wave of frequency ωL/2π. For an
atom located at r, the Hamiltonian is
ˆH = ¯hω0|e⟩⟨e| −d · (E(r, t)|e⟩⟨g| + E∗(r, t)|g⟩⟨e|) ,
(26.1)
where d, which is assumed to be real, represents the matrix element of
the atomic electric dipole operator between the states |g⟩and |e⟩(i.e. d =
⟨e| ˆD|g⟩= ⟨g| ˆD|e⟩∗). The quantity E + E∗represents the electric ﬁeld. We
set
E(r, t) = E0(r) exp(−iωLt) .
In all the chapter we assume that the detuning ∆= ωL−ω0 is small compared
with ωL and ω0. We treat classically the motion r(t) of the atomic center of
mass.
26.1 Optical Bloch Equations for an Atom at Rest
26.1.1. Write the evolution equations for the four components of the density
operator of the atom ρgg, ρeg, ρge and ρee under the eﬀect of the Hamiltonian
ˆH.
26.1.2. We take into account the coupling of the atom with the empty modes
of the radiation ﬁeld, which are in particular responsible for the spontaneous
emission of the atom when it is in the excited state |e⟩. We shall assume that
this boils down to adding to the above evolution equations “relaxation” terms:

26.1.4. Interpret physically the steady state value of the quantity Γρee in
terms of spontaneous emission rate.
26.2 The Radiation Pressure Force
In this section, we limit ourselves to the case where the electromagnetic ﬁeld
is a progressive plane wave:
E0(r) = E0 exp(ik · r) .
By analogy with the classical situation, we can deﬁne the radiative force op-
erator at point r as:
ˆF (r) = −∇r ˆH .
26.2.1. Evaluate the expectation value of ˆF (r) assuming that the atom is at
rest in r and that its internal dynamics is in steady state.
26.2.2. Interpret the result physically in terms of momentum exchanges be-
tween the atom and the radiation ﬁeld. One can introduce the recoil velocity
vrec = ¯hk/m.
26.2.3. How does this force behave at high intensities? Give an order of
magnitude of the possible acceleration for a sodium atom 23Na, with a reso-
nance wavelength λ = 0.589 × 10−6 m and a lifetime of the excited state of
Γ −1 = 16 × 10−9 s (d = 2.1 × 10−29 C m).
26.2.4. We now consider an atom in uniform motion: r = r0 + v0t (v0 ≪c).
Give the expression for the force acting on this atom.

26.3 Doppler Cooling
269
26.2.5. The action of the force on the atom will modify its velocity. Under
what condition is it legitimate to treat this velocity as a constant quantity for
the calculation of the radiation pressure force, as done above? Is this condition
valid for sodium atoms?
26.3 Doppler Cooling
The atom now moves in the ﬁeld of two progressive plane waves of opposite
directions (+z and −z) and of same intensity (Fig. 26.1). We restrict ourselves
to the motion along the direction of propagation of the two waves and we
assume that for weak intensities (s ≪1) one can add independently the
forces exerted by the two waves.

26.3.1. Show that for suﬃciently small velocities, the total force is linear in
the velocity and can be cast in the form:
f = −mv

.
26.3.2. What is the minimal (positive) value of τmin for a ﬁxed saturation
parameter per wave s0 for an atom at rest? Calculate τmin for sodium atoms,
assuming one ﬁxes s0 = 0.1.
26.3.3. This cooling mechanism is limited by the heating due to the random
nature of spontaneous emission. To evaluate the evolution of the velocity
distribution P(v, t) and ﬁnd its steady state value, we shall proceed in the
following way:
(a) Express P(v, t + dt) in terms of P(v, t). One will split the atoms into
three classes:
•
the atoms having undergone no photon scattering event between t and
t + dt,
•
the atoms having scattered a photon from the +z wave,
•
the atoms having scattered a photon from the −z wave.
We choose dt short enough that the probability of the ﬁrst option is
dominant, and such that multiple scattering events are negligible. We
also assume that the velocities contributing signiﬁcantly to P(v, t) are

270
26 Laser Cooling and Trapping
small enough for the linearization of the force performed above to be
valid. For simplicity we will assume that spontaneously emitted photons
propagate only along the z axis, a spontaneous emission occurring with
equal probabilities in the directions +z and −z.
(b) Show that P(v, t) obeys the Fokker–Planck equation
∂P
∂t = α ∂
∂v (vP) + β ∂2P
∂v2
and express of α and β in terms of the physical parameters of the problem.
(c) Determine the steady state velocity distribution. Show that it corre-
sponds to a Maxwell distribution and give the eﬀective temperature.
(d) For which detuning is the eﬀective temperature minimal? What is this
minimal temperature for sodium atoms?
26.4 The Dipole Force
We now consider a stationary light wave (with a constant phase)
E0(r) = E∗
0(r) .
26.4.1. Evaluate the expectation value of the radiative force operator ˆF (r) =
−∇r ˆH assuming that the atom is at rest in r and that its internal dynamics
has reached its steady state.
26.4.2. Show that this force derives from a potential and evaluate the po-
tential well depth that can be attained for sodium atoms with a laser beam
of intensity P = 1 W, focused on a circular spot of radius 10 µm, and a
wavelength λL = 0.650 µm.

26.1.2. Assume that the atom-ﬁeld system is placed at time t = 0 in the
state
|ψ(0)⟩= (α|g⟩+ β|e⟩) ⊗|0⟩,
where |0⟩denotes the vacuum state of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and neglect
in a ﬁrst step the action of the laser. At time t, the state of the system is
derived from the Wigner–Weisskopf treatment of spontaneous emission:
|ψ(t)⟩= (α|g⟩+ βe−(iω0+Γ/2)t)|e⟩) ⊗|0⟩+ |g⟩⊗|φ⟩,
where the state of the ﬁeld |φ⟩is a superposition of one-photon states for the
various modes of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Consequently the evolution of the
density matrix elements is ρee(t) = |β|2e−Γ t, ρeg(t) = α∗βe−(iω0+Γ )t, or, in
other words,

dρee

The two other relations originate from the conservation of the trace of the
density operator (ρee + ρgg = 1) and from its hermitian character ρeg = ρ∗
ge.
We assume in the following that the evolution of the atomic density oper-
ator is obtained by adding the action of the laser ﬁeld and the spontaneous
emission contribution. Since Γ varies like ω3
0, this is valid as long as the shift
of the atomic transition due to the laser irradiation remains small compared
with ω0. This requires dE ≪¯hω0, which is satisﬁed for usual continuous laser
sources.
26.1.3. The evolution of the density operator components is given by

(ρgg −ρee) .
These equations are often called optical Bloch equations.
At steady-state, ρee and ρgg tend to a constant value, while ρeg and ρge
oscillate respectively as e−iωLt and eiωLt. This steady-state is reached after a
characteristic time of the order of Γ −1. ¿From the second equation we extract
the steady-state value of ρeg as a function of ρgg −ρee = 1 −2ρee:
ρeg = id · E(r) e−iωLt/¯h
i∆+ Γ/2
(1 −2ρee) .
We now insert this value in the evolution of ρee and we get:

272
26 Laser Cooling and Trapping
ρee =
s
2(1 + s)
with
s(r) = 2 |d · E(r)|2/¯h2
∆2 + Γ 2/4
.
The three other values given in the text for ρgg, ρeg and ρge follow immediately.
26.1.4. The steady state value of ρee gives the average probability of ﬁnding
the atom in the internal state |e⟩. This value results from the competition
between absorption processes, which tend to populate the level |e⟩and stim-
ulated+spontaneous emission processes, which depopulate |e⟩to the beneﬁt
of |g⟩.
The quantity Γρee represents the steady-state rate of spontaneous emission
as the atom is irradiated by the laser wave. For a low saturation parameter s,
this rate is proportional to the laser intensity |E(r)|2. When the laser intensity
increases, s gets much larger than 1 and the steady state value of ρee is close
to 1/2. This means that the atom spends half of the time in level |e⟩. In this
case, the rate of spontaneous emission tends to Γ/2.
Section 26.2:
The Radiation Pressure Force
26.2.1. For a plane laser wave the force operator is given by:
ˆF (r) = ik d · E0

ei(k·r−ωLt)|e⟩⟨g| −e−i(k·r−ωLt)|g⟩⟨e|

.
The expectation value in steady state is Tr(ˆρ ˆF ) which gives:
f = ⟨F ⟩= ik d · E0 ei(k·r−ωLt) ρge + c.c.
= ¯hk Γ
2
s0
1 + s0
with
s0 = 2 |d · E0|2/¯h2
∆2 + Γ 2/4
.
26.2.2. The interpretation of this result is as follows. The atom undergoes
absorption processes, where it goes from the ground internal state to the
excited internal state, and gains the momentum ¯hk. From the excited state,
it can return to the ground state by a stimulated or spontaneous emission
process. In a stimulated emission the atom releases the momentum that it has
gained during the absorption process, so that the net variation of momentum
in a such a cycle is zero. In contrast, in a spontaneous emission process, the
momentum change of the atom has a random direction and it averages to zero
since the spontaneous emission process occurs with the same probability in
two opposite directions. Therefore the net momentum gain for the atom in
a cycle “absorption–spontaneous emission” is ¯hk corresponding to a velocity
change vrec. Since these cycles occur with a rate (Γ/2)s0/(1+s0) (as found at
the end of Sect. 26.1), we recover the expression for the radiation force found
above.

26.5 Solutions
273
26.2.3. For a large laser intensity, the force saturates to the value ¯hkΓ/2.
This corresponds to an acceleration amax = ¯hkΓ/(2m) = 9×105m s−2, which
is 100 000 times larger than the acceleration due to gravity.
26.2.4. In the rest frame of the atom, the laser ﬁeld still corresponds to a
plane wave with a modiﬁed frequency ωL −k · v (ﬁrst order Doppler eﬀect).
The change of momentum of the photon is negligible for non-relativistic atomic
velocities. The previous result is then changed into:
f = ¯hk Γ
2
s(v)
1 + s(v)
with
s(v) =
2 |d · E0|2/¯h2
(∆−k · v)2 + Γ 2/4 .
26.2.5. The notion of force derived above is valid if the elementary veloc-
ity change in a single absorption or emission process (the recoil velocity
vrec = ¯hk/m) modiﬁes only weakly the value of f. This is the case when
the elementary change of Doppler shift kvrec = ¯hk2/m is very small compared
with the width of the resonance:
¯hk2
m ≪Γ .
This is the so called broad line condition. This condition is well satisﬁed for
sodium atoms since ¯hk2/(mΓ) = 5 × 10−3 in this case.
Section 26.3:
Doppler Cooling
26.3.1. The total force acting on the atom moving with velocity v is
f(v) = ¯hk Γ

|d · E0|2/¯h2
(∆−kv)2 + Γ 2/4 −
|d · E0|2/¯h2
(∆+ kv)2 + Γ 2/4

where we have used the fact that s ≪1. For low velocities (kv ≪Γ) we get
at ﬁrst order in v
f(v) = −mv
τ
with
τ =
m
¯hk2s0
∆2 + Γ 2/4
2(−∆)Γ
.
This corresponds to a damping force if the detuning ∆is negative. In this
case the atom is cooled because of the Doppler eﬀect. This is the so-called
Doppler cooling: A moving atom feels a stronger radiation pressure force from
the counterpropagating wave than from the copropagating wave. For an atom
at rest the two radiation pressure forces are equal and opposite: the net force
is zero.
26.3.2. For a ﬁxed saturation parameter s0, the cooling time is minimal for
∆= −Γ/2, which leads to
τmin =
m
2¯hk2s0
.

274
26 Laser Cooling and Trapping
Note that this time is always much longer than the lifetime of the excited
state Γ −1 when the broad line condition is fullﬁlled. For sodium atoms this
minimal cooling time is 16 µs for s0 = 0.1.
26.3.3.
(a) The probability that an atom moving with velocity v scatters a
photon from the ±z wave during the time dt is
dP±(v) = Γs0
2

1 ±
2∆kv
∆2 + Γ 2/4

dt .
Since we assume that the spontaneously emitted photons also propagate along
z, half of the scattering events do not change the velocity of the atom: This is
the case when the spontaneously emitted photon propagates along the same
direction as the absorbed photon. For the other half of the events, the change
of the atomic velocity is ±2vrec, corresponding to a spontaneously emitted
photon propagating in the direction opposite to the absorbed photon. Conse-
quently, the probability that the velocity of the atom does not change during
the time dt is 1 −(dP+(v) + dP−(v))/2, and the probability that the atomic
velocity changes by ±2vrec is dP±(v)/2. Therefore one has:
P(v, t + dt) =

1 −dP+(v) + dP−(v)

P(v, t)
+dP+(v −2vrec)
2
P(v −2vrec, t)
+dP−(v + 2vrec)
2
P(v + 2vrec, t) .
(b) Assuming that P(v) varies smoothly over the recoil velocity scale (which
will be checked in the end), we can transform the ﬁnite diﬀerence equation
found above into a diﬀerential equation:
∂P
∂t = α ∂
∂v (vP) + β ∂2P
∂v2 ,
with
α = m
τ
β = Γv2
recs0 .
The term proportional to α corresponds to the Doppler cooling. The term in
β accounts for the heating due to the random nature of spontaneous emission
processes. The coeﬃcient β is a diﬀusion constant in velocity space, propor-
tional to the square of the elementary step of the random walk vrec, and to
its rate Γs0.
(c) The steady state for P(v) corresponds to the solution of:

26.5 Solutions
275
α v P(v) + β dP
dv = 0 ,
whose solution (for α > 0, i.e. ∆< 0) is a Maxwell distribution:
P(v) = P0 exp

.
The eﬀective temperature is therefore
kBT = mβ
α

∆2 + Γ 2/4

.
(d) The minimal temperature is obtained for ∆= −Γ/2:
kBTmin = ¯hΓ
2
.
This is the Doppler cooling limit, which is independent of the laser inten-
sity. Note that, when the broad line condition is fullﬁlled, the corresponding
velocity scale v0 is such that:
vrec ≪v0 =

¯hΓ/m ≪Γ/k .
The two hypotheses at the basis of our calculation are therefore valid: (i)
P(v) varies smootly over the scale vrec and (ii) the relevant velocities are
small enough for the linearization of the scattering rates to be possible.
For sodium atoms, the minimal temperature is Tmin = 240 µK, correspond-
ing to v0 = 40 cm s−1.
Section 26.4:
The Dipole Force
26.4.1. For a real amplitude E0(r) of the electric ﬁeld of the light wave
(standing wave), the force operator ˆF (r) is:
ˆF (r) =
⎛
⎝
i=x,y,z
di∇E0i(r)
⎞
⎠
e−iωLt|e⟩⟨g| + eiωLt|g⟩⟨e|

.
Assuming that the internal dynamics of the atom has reached its steady-state
value, we get for the expectation value of ˆF :
f(r) = ⟨F ⟩= −∇(d · E0(r)) d · E0(r)
1 + s(r)
∆

26.4.2. This force is called the dipole force. It derives from the dipole poten-
tial U(r):

276
26 Laser Cooling and Trapping
f(r) = −∇U(r)
with
U(r) = ¯h∆
2 log(1 + s(r)) .
For a laser ﬁeld with intensity P = 1 W, focused on a spot with radius
r = 10 µm, the electric ﬁeld at the center is
E0 =
	
2P
πϵ0cr2 = 1.6 × 106 V/m .
We suppose here that the circular spot is uniformly illuminated. A more ac-
curate treatment should take into account the transverse Gaussian proﬁle
of the laser beam, but this would not signiﬁcantly change the following re-
sults. This value for E0 leads to dE0/¯h = 3.1×1011 s−1 and the detuning ∆is
equal to 3×1014 s−1. The potential depth is then found to be equal to 2.4 mK,
10 times larger than the Doppler cooling limit. Due to the large detuning, the
photon scattering rate is quite small: 70 photons/s.
26.6 Comments
The radiation pressure force has been used in particular for atomic beam
deceleration (J.V. Prodan, W.D. Phillips, and H. Metcalf, Phys. Rev. Lett.
49, 1149 (1982)). The Doppler cooling was proposed by T.W. H¨ansch and
A. Schawlow (Opt. Commun. 13, 68 (1975)). A related cooling scheme for
trapped ions was proposed the same year by D. Wineland and H. Dehmelt
(Bull. Am. Phys. Soc. 20, 637 (1975)). The ﬁrst observation of 3D laser cooling
of neutral atoms was reported by S. Chu, L. Hollberg, J.E. Bjorkholm, A.
Cable, and A. Ashkin, Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 48 (1985), and the same group
reported one year later the observation of atoms trapped at the focal point of
a laser beam using the dipole force (Phys. Rev. Lett. 57, 314 (1986)).
It was subsequently discovered experimentally in the group of W.D.
Phillips that the temperature of laser cooled atoms could be much lower than
the Doppler limit kBT = ¯hΓ/2 derived in this problem. This clear violation
of Murphy’s law (an experiment working 10 times better than predicted!)
was explained independently in terms of Sisyphus cooling by the groups of C.

The Physics Nobel Prize was awarded in 1997 to S. Chu, C. Cohen-

Bloch Oscillations
The possibility to study accurately the quantum motion of atoms in standing
light ﬁelds has been used recently in order to test several predictions relating
to wave propagation in a periodic potential. We present in this chapter some
of these observations related to the phenomenon of Bloch oscillations.
27.1 Unitary Transformation on a Quantum System
Consider a system in the state |ψ(t)⟩which evolves under the eﬀect of a
Hamiltonian ˆH(t). Consider a unitary operator ˆD(t). Show that the evolution
of the transformed vector
| ˜ψ(t)⟩= ˆD(t)|ψ(t)⟩
is given by a Schr¨odinger equation with Hamiltonian
˜ˆH(t) = ˆD(t) ˆH(t) ˆD†(t) + i¯hd ˆD(t)
dt
ˆD†(t) .
27.2 Band Structure in a Periodic Potential
The mechanical action of a standing light wave onto an atom can be described
by a potential (see e.g. Chap. 26). If the detuning between the light frequency
and the atom resonance frequency ωA is large compared to the electric dipole
coupling of the atom with the wave, this potential is proportional to the light
intensity. Consequently, the one-dimensional motion of an atom of mass m
moving in a standing laser wave can be written
ˆH =
ˆP 2
2m + U0 sin2(k0 ˆX) ,

278
27 Bloch Oscillations
where ˆX and ˆP are the atomic position and momentum operators and where
we neglect any spontaneous emission process. We shall assume that k0 ≃ωA/c
and we introduce the “recoil energy” ER = ¯h2k2
0/(2m).
27.2.1.
(a) Given the periodicity of the Hamiltonian ˆH, recall brieﬂy why
the eigenstates of this Hamiltonian can be cast in the form (Bloch theo-
rem):
|ψ⟩= eiq ˆ
X|uq⟩,
where the real number q (Bloch index) is in the interval (−k0, k0) and
where |uq⟩is periodic in space with period λ0/2.
(b) Write the eigenvalue equation to be satisﬁed by |uq⟩. Discuss the corre-
sponding spectrum (i) for a given value of q, (ii) when q varies between
−k0 and k0.
In the following, the eigenstates of ˆH are denoted |n, q⟩, with energies En(q).
They are normalized on a spatial period of extension λ0/2 = π/k0.
27.2.2. Give the energy levels in terms of the indices n and q in the case
U0 = 0.
27.2.3. Treat the eﬀect of the potential U0 in ﬁrst order perturbation theory,
for the lowest band n = 0 (one should separate the cases q = ±k0 and q
“far from” ±k0). Give the width of the gap which appears between the bands
n = 0 and n = 1 owing to the presence of the perturbation.
27.2.4. Under what condition on U0 is this perturbative approach reliable?
27.2.5. How do the widths of the other gaps vary with U0 in this perturbative
limit?
27.3 The Phenomenon of Bloch Oscillations
We suppose now that we prepare in the potential U0 sin2(k0x) a wave packet
in the n = 0 band with a sharp distribution in q, and that we apply to the
atom a constant extra force F = ma.
We recall the adiabatic theorem: suppose that a system is prepared at time
0 in the eigenstate |φ(0)
n ⟩of the Hamiltonian ˆH(0). If the Hamiltonian ˆH(t)
evolves slowly with time, the system will remain with a large probability in
the eigenstate |φ(t)
n ⟩. The validity condition for this theorem is ¯h⟨φ(t)
m | ˙φ(t)
n ⟩≪
|Em(t) −En(t)| for any m ̸= n. We use the notation | ˙φ(t)
n ⟩= d
dt|φ(t)
n ⟩.

compared to ¯hk. We will approximate this state by the eigenstate of momen-
tum |p = 0⟩. One “slowly” switches on the potential U0(t) sin2(k0x), with
U0(t) ≤ER.
(a) Using the symmetries of the problem, show that the Bloch index q is a
constant of the motion.
(b) Write the expression of the eigenstate of H(t) of indices n = 0, q = 0 to
ﬁrst order in U0.
(c) Evaluate the validity of the adiabatic approximation in terms of ˙U0, ER, ¯h.
(d) One switches on linearly the potential U0 until it reaches the value ER.
What is the condition on the time τ of the operation in order for the
process to remain adiabatic? Calculate the minimal value of τ for cesium
atoms (m = 2.2 × 10−25 kg, λ0 = 0.85 µm.)
27.3.2. Devising a Constant Force. Once U0(t) has reached the maximal
value U0 (time t = 0), one achieves a sweep of the phases φ+(t) and φ−(t) of
the two traveling waves forming the standing wave. The potential seen by the
atom is then U0 sin2(k0x −(φ+(t) −φ−(t))/2) and one chooses
φ+(t) −φ−(t) = k0at2 .
(a) Show that there exists a reference frame where the wave is stationnary,
and give its acceleration.
(b) In order to study the quantum motion of the atoms in the accelerated
reference frame, we consider the unitary transformation generated by
ˆD(t) = exp(iat2 ˆP/2¯h) exp(−imat ˆX/¯h) exp(ima2t3/(3¯h)) .
How do the position and momentum operators ˆX and ˆP transform? Write
the resulting form of the Hamiltonian in this unitary transformation
˜ˆH =
ˆP 2
2m + U0 sin2(k0 ˆX) + ma ˆX .
27.3.3. Bloch Oscillations
We consider the evolution of the initial state n = 0, q = 0 under the eﬀect of
the Hamiltonian ˜ˆH.
(a) Check that the state vector remains of the Bloch form, i.e.
|ψ(t)⟩= eiq(t) ˆ
X|u(t)⟩,
where |u(t)⟩is periodic in space and q(t) = −mat/¯h.
(b) What does the adiabatic approximation correspond to for the evolution
of |u(t)⟩? We shall assume this approximation to be valid in the following.

280
27 Bloch Oscillations
(c) Show that, up to a phase factor, |ψ(t)⟩is a periodic function of time, and
give the corresponding value of the period.
(d) The velocity distribution of the atoms as a function of time is given
in Fig. 27.1. The time interval between two curves is 1 ms and a =
−0.85 ms−2. Comment on this ﬁgure, which has been obtained with ce-
sium atoms.

Section 27.2:
Band Structure in a Periodic Potential
27.2.1. Bloch theorem
(a) The atom moves in a spatially periodic potential, with period λ0/2 =
π/k0. Therefore the Hamiltonian commutes with the translation operator
ˆT(λ0/2) = exp(iλ0 ˆP/(2¯h)) and one can look for a common basis set of
these two operators. Eigenvalues of ˆT(λ0/2) have a modulus equal to 1, since
ˆT(λ0/2) is unitary. They can be written eiqλ0/2 where q is in the interval
(−k0, k0). A corresponding eigenvector of ˆH and ˆT(λ0/2) is then such that
ˆT(λ0/2)|ψ⟩= eiqλ0/2|ψ⟩
or in other words
ψ(x + λ0/2) = eiqλ0/2ψ(x) .
This amounts to saying that the function uq(x) = e−iqxψ(x) is periodic in
space with period λ0/2, hence the result.
(b) The equation satisﬁed by uq is:
−¯h2
2m

 d
dx + iq
2
uq + U0 sin2(kx) uq = E uq .
For a ﬁxed value of q, we look for periodic solutions of this equation. The
boundary conditions uq(λ0/2) = uq(0) and u′
q(λ0/2) = u′
q(0) lead, for each
q, to a discrete set of allowed values for E, which we denote En(q). The
corresponding eigenvector of ˆH and ˆT(λ0/2) is denoted |ψ⟩= |n, q⟩. Now
when q varies in the interval (−k0, k0), the energy En(q) varies continuously
in an interval (Emin
n
, Emax
n
). The precise values of Emin
n
and Emax
n
depend on
the value of U0. The spectrum En(q) is then constituted by a series of allowed
energy bands, separated by gaps corresponding to forbidden values of energy.
The interval (−k0, k0) is called the ﬁrst Brillouin zone.
27.2.2. For U0 = 0, the spectrum of ˆH is simply ¯h2k2/(2m) corresponding
to the eigenstates eikx (free particle). Each k can be written: k = q + 2nk0
where n is an integer, and the spectrum En(q) then consists of folded portions
of parabola (see Fig. 27.2a). There are no forbidden gaps in this case, and the
various energy bands touch each other (Emin
n+1 = Emax
n
).

27.2.3. When q is far enough from ±k0, the spectrum of ˆH has no degeneracy,
and the shift of the energy level of the lowest band n = 0 can be obtained
using simply:
∆E0(q) = ⟨0, q|U0 sin2(k0 ˆX)|0, q⟩
= k0
π
 π/k0

e−iqx U0 sin2(k0x) eiqx dx = U0
2 .
When q is equal to ±k0, the bands n = 0 and n = 1 coincide and one should
diagonalize the restriction of U(x) to this two-dimensional subspace. One gets
⟨0, k0|U0 sin2(k0 ˆX)|0, k0⟩= ⟨1, k0|U0 sin2(k0 ˆX)|1, k0⟩= U0
2 ,
⟨0, k0|U0 sin2(k0 ˆX)|1, k0⟩= ⟨1, k0|U0 sin2(k0 ˆX)|0, k0⟩= −U0
4 .
The diagonalization of the matrix

gives the two eigenvalues 3U0/4 and U0/4, which means that the two bands
n = 0 and n = 1 do not touch each other anymore, but that they are separated
by a gap U0/2 (see Fig. 27.2b for U0 = ER).
27.2.4. This perturbative approach is valid if one can neglect the coupling
to all other bands. Since the characteristic energy splitting between the band
n = 1 and the band n = 2 is 4 ER, the validity criterion is
U0 ≪4 ER .
27.2.5. The other gaps open either at k = 0 or k = ±k0. They result from
the coupling of eink0x and e−ink0x under the inﬂuence of U0 sin2(k0x). This
coupling gives a non-zero result when taken at order n. Therefore the other
gaps scale as U n
0 and they are much smaller that the lowest one.

Section 27.3:
The phenomenon of Bloch Oscillations
27.3.1. Preparation of the Initial State
(a) Suppose that the initial state has a well deﬁned Bloch index q, which
means that
ˆT(λ0/2)|ψ(0)⟩= eiqλ0/2|ψ(0)⟩.
At any time t, the Hamiltonian ˆH(t) is spatially periodic and commute with
the translation operator ˆT(λ0/2). Therefore the evolution operator ˆU(t) also
commutes with ˆT(λ0/2). Consequently:
ˆT(λ0/2)|ψ(t)⟩= ˆT(λ0/2) ˆU(t)|ψ(0)⟩= ˆU(t) ˆT(λ0/2)|ψ(0)⟩,
= eiqλ0/2|ψ(t)⟩,
which means that q is a constant of motion.
(b) At zeroth order in U0, the eigenstates of H corresponding to the Bloch
index q = 0 are the plane waves |k = 0⟩(energy 0), |k = ±2k0⟩(energy
4ER), . . . At ﬁrst order in U0, in order to determine |n = 0, q = 0⟩, we have
to take into account the coupling of |k = 0⟩with |k = ±2k0⟩, which gives
|n = 0, q = 0⟩= |k = 0⟩+

ϵ=±
⟨k = 2ϵk0|U0 sin2 k0x|k = 0⟩
4ER
|k = 2ϵk0⟩.
The calculation of the matrix elements is straightforward and it leads to
⟨x|n = 0, q = 0⟩∝1 + U0(t)
8ER
cos(2k0x) .
(c) The system will adiabatically follow the level |n = 0, q = 0⟩as the
potential U0 is raised, provided for any n′
¯h⟨n′, q = 0|

d|n = 0, q = 0⟩
dt

≪En′(0) −E0(0) .
Using the value found above for |n = 0, q = 0⟩and taking n′ = ±1, we derive
the validity criterion for the adiabatic approximation in this particular case:
¯h ˙U0 ≪64 E2
R .
(d) For a linear variation of U0 such that U0 = ERt/τ, this validity condition
is
τ ≫¯h/(64 ER) ,
which corresponds to τ ≫10 µs for cesium atoms.

27 Bloch Oscillations
27.3.2. Devising a Constant Force
(a) Consider a point with coordinate x in the lab frame. In the frame with
acceleration a and zero initial velocity, the coordinate of this point is x′ =
x −at2/2. In this frame, the laser intensity varies as sin2(kx′), corresponding
to a “true” standing wave.
(b) Using the standard relations [ ˆX, f( ˆP)] = i¯hf ′( ˆP) and [ ˆP, g( ˆX)] =
−i¯hg′( ˆX), one gets
ˆD ˆX ˆD† = ˆX + at2
2
ˆD ˆP ˆD† = ˆP + mat .
The transformed Hamiltonian ˆD ˆH ˆD† is
ˆD ˆH ˆD† =
1
2m

ˆP + mat
2
+ U0 sin2(k0 ˆX) ,
and the extra term appearing in ˜ˆH can be written
i¯hd ˆD
dt
ˆD† = −at ˆP + ma ˆX −ma2t2
2
.
Summing the two contributions, we obtain
˜ˆH =
ˆP 2
2m + U0 sin2(k0 ˆX) + ma ˆX .
This Hamiltonian describes the motion of a particle of mass m in a periodic
potential, superimposed with a constant force – ma.
27.3.3. Bloch Oscillations
(a) The evolution of the state vector is i¯h| ˙ψ⟩= ˜ˆH|ψ⟩. We now put |ψ(t)⟩=
exp(−imat ˆX/¯h)|u(t)⟩and we look for the evolution of |u(t)⟩. We obtain after
a straightforward calculation
i¯h∂u(x, t)
∂t
= −¯h2
2m

 ∂
∂x −imat
¯h
2
u(x, t) + U0 sin2(k0x) u(x, t) .
Using the structure of this equation, and using the initial spatial periodicity
of u(x, 0), one deduces that u(x, t) is also spatially periodic with the same
period λ0/2.
(b) The adiabatic hypothesis for |u(t)⟩amounts to assume that this vector,
which is equal to |un=0,q=0⟩at t = 0, remains equal to |u0,q(t)⟩at any time.
The atom stays in the band n = 0.
(c) Consider the duration TB = 2¯hk0/(ma) during which q(t) is changed into
q(t) −2k0. Since 2k0 is the width of the Brillouin zone, we have |un,q−2k0⟩≡
|un,q⟩. Consequently, when the adiabatic approximation is valid, the state
|ψ(t + TB)⟩coincides (within a phase factor) with the state |ψ(t)⟩. Since this
phase factor does not enter in the calculation of physical quantities such as

27.5 Comments
285
position or momentum distributions, we expect that the evolution of these
quantities with time will be periodic with the period TB.
(d) We ﬁrst note that the initial distribution is such that the average mo-
mentum is zero, and that the momentum dispersion is small compared with
¯hk0, as assumed in this problem. Concerning the time evolution, we see in-
deed that the atomic momentum distribution is periodic in time, with a period
TB ≃8 ms, which coincides with the predicted value 2¯hk0/(ma). Finally we
note that the average momentum increases quasi-linearly with time during the
ﬁrst 4 ms, from 0 to ¯hk0. At this time corresponding to TB/2, a “reﬂexion”
occurs and the momentum is changed into −¯hk0. During the second half of
the Bloch period (from 4 ms to 8 ms) the momentum again increases linearly
with time from −¯hk0 to 0. At the time TB/2, the particle is at the edge of the
Brillouin zone (q = ±k0). This is the place where the adiabatic approxima-
tion is the most fragile since the band n = 1 is then very close to the band
n = 0 (gap U0). One can check that the validity criterion for the adiabatic
approximation at this place is maER ≪k0U 2
0 , which is well fullﬁlled in the
experiment. The reﬂection occurring at t = TB/2 can be viewed as a Bragg
reﬂection of the atom with momentum ¯hk0 on the periodic grating U0 sin2(kx).
27.5 Comments
This paradoxical situation, where a constant force ma leads to an oscillation
of the particle instead of a constant acceleration, is called the Bloch oscillation
phenomenon. It shows that an ideal crystal cannot be a good conductor: when
one applies a potential diﬀerence at the edge of the crystal, the electrons of
the conduction band feel a constant force in addition to the periodic potential
created by the crystal and they should oscillate instead of being accelerated
towards the positive edge of the crystal. The conduction phenomenon results
from the defects present in real metals.
