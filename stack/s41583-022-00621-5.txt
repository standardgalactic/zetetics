We are enthusiastic about the synthesis and 
expansion of the predictive coding of music 
(PCM) hypothesis in the recently published 
Review by Vuust et al. (Vuust, P., Heggli, O. A.,  
Friston, K. J. & Kringelbach, M. L. Music in 
the brain. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 23, 287–305 
(2022))1. This latest version of the PCM hypo­
thesis represents a substantial generalization 
from the domain of time (rhythm) to the 
domain of frequency (melody and harmony). 
Here, we consider limitations to the fram­
ing of the hypothesis as it currently stands, 
and propose generalizations that speak to a 
cross-​cultural understanding of music beyond 
the Western tradition2.
Vuust et al. (see their Fig. 1) define three 
‘constituents of music’: melody, harmony 
and rhythm. While melody and rhythm are 
indeed constituents traditionally found in 
almost all of the world’s music, chord-​based 
harmony is not, despite its recent expansion 
into popular music around the globe3–5. Vuust 
et al. correctly note that “Whereas tonality is 
known in music from all cultures studied, 
neuroscientific studies have concentrated 
mainly on Western harmony,” but then they 
continue to focus predictions from the PCM 
hypothesis on Western chord-​based harmony, 
limiting the generality of this hypothesis  
(see Vuust et al. Figs. 1 and 3–5). We propose 
instead that a more general PCM framework 
could focus on tonality, rather than harmony. 
Western chord-​based harmony could thus 
be seen as a special case of generalized tonal 
relationships between notes, which can take 
the form of chords, scales or non-​chord-​based 
simultaneous tones (for example, South Asian 
drone or Central African hocket)4,6.
Rhythm, too, could benefit from a more 
cross-​culturally general framework. Currently, 
predictions from the PCM hypothesis regard­
ing syncopation and groove are focused on the 
4/4 (‘common time’) and 3/4 (‘waltz’) metres 
common in Western music (see Vuust et al.  
Figs. 1–5). While these metres are also found 
in much non-​Western music, so are non- 
isochronous and unmetered musics (for exam­
ple, Middle Eastern aksak, Hindustani alap 
and Japanese shakuhachi)3,7,8, for which the 
predictions of the PCM hypothesis are less clear.
Expanding the PCM hypothesis beyond 
chord-​based harmonies and isochronous 
metres could allow its predictions to be

Towards a cross-​cultural framework

We thank Patrick Savage and Shinya Fujii for 
their highly relevant comment about our recent 
Review (Music in the brain. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 
23, 287–305 (2022))1, in which they extend the 
predictive coding of music (PCM) framework 
to encompass the perception of music — and 
music listeners — from cultures beyond the 
Western tradition (Towards a cross-cultural  
framework for predictive cod­ing of music. 
Nat. Rev. Neurosci. https://doi.org/10.1038/
s41583-022-00622-4 (2022))2. As Savage 
and Fujii rightly point out, there are music 
genres outside the Western tradition that do 
not include harmony — often being based 
on musical modes other than the major and 
minor modes — and music pieces that are 
non-isochronous or unmetered.
One key offering of the PCM account is 
that it explains music perception (and action,  
emotion and learning) as guided by the brain’s 
real-time generative model. This model relies 
on cultural background (and thereby on 
experience-dependent learning), musical com­
petence, the context in which we experience 
music and our current brain state (including 
attentional set and emotional states), as well 
as individual traits and innate biological fac­
tors. It is important to note that the musical 
percept is not necessarily tied to the auditory 
input3,4. The percept (that is, post­erior beliefs) 
is the product of belief updating under a 
hierarchical generative model, which may 
differ fundamentally among listeners. A key 
example in our Review is that certain musical 
excerpts may be heard with different metres 
or different tonalities, depending on the musi­
cal priors (see Fig. 3 in the Review), and this 
experience can be manipulated by priming 
(that is, changing prior beliefs)5,6. Accordingly, 
the PCM model explains how growing up in 
a certain musical culture profoundly influ­
ences our experience of music; by shaping 
the predictive frameworks that ­underlie  
perception, action, affect and learning.
We agree that Western-based harmony is a 
special case of the more general phenomenon 
of tonality. As we note in our Review: “The 
experience of music is therefore intimately

linked to brain-bound predictive models: for 
example, tonality … and metre”1. We included 
a discussion of harmony as a well-researched 
example of how music perception may be sub­
dued to a statistically learned musical gram­
mar, for listeners from a Western culture.  
Furthermore, the statistical learning proces­
ses involved in harmony or tonality — and 
thereby the principles that underwrite pre­
dictive processing — have been generalized 
beyond musical cultures through behavioural 
and scanning studies using artificial tonal 
­systems and grammars7–11.
For many musical genres — including 
for contemporary styles of music with roots 
in African music that are now considered 
Western, such as modal jazz — it would make 
sense to exemplify PCM by tonality. However,  
tonality may not even be an endpoint pre­
diction for melody (or harmony), as it is 
­intertwined with rhythmic predictions12.
However, as Savage and Fujii correctly point  
out2, there is a need for neuroscienti­fic 
studies of music involving stimuli and lis­
teners with a non-Western background. 
Clearly, we do not fully understand the pre­
dictive coding involved in the processing 
of non-isochronous and unmetred musics.  
An obvious experiment would be to examine 
the neural correlates of temporal violations in 
such music in encultured listeners; for exam­
ple, using the mismatch negativity recorded 
by electroencephalography or magneto­
encephalography. The prediction of the PCM 
model would be that the mismatch negativity 
would have a larger amplitude and a shorter 
latency to violations of such temporal predic­
tions in ­encultured listeners than in Western 
listeners.
We very much look forward to seeing and 
evaluating evidence from empirical neurosci­
entific investigations within the exciting field 
of cross-cultural neuroscience of music; it is 
an ideal way to probe and expand the com­
pass of the PCM framework to instantiations 
of music from a breadth of cultures.
