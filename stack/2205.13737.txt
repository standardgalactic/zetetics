Creases are purposely introduced to thin structures for designing deployable origami, artistic
geometries, and functional structures with tunable nonlinear mechanics. Modeling the mechanics
of creased structures is challenging because creases introduce geometric discontinuity and often
have complex mechanical responses due to the local material damage. In this work, we propose
a continuous description of the sharp geometry of creases and apply it to the study of creased
annuli, made by introducing radial creases to annular strips with the creases annealed to behave
elastically. We ﬁnd creased annuli have generic bistability and can be folded into various compact
shapes, depending on the crease pattern and the overcurvature of the ﬂat annulus.
We use a
regularized Dirac delta function (RDDF) to describe the geometry of a crease, with the ﬁnite spike
of the RDDF capturing the localized curvature. Together with anisotropic rod theory, we solve
the nonlinear mechanics of creased annuli, with its stability determined by the standard conjugate
point test. We ﬁnd excellent agreements between precision tabletop models and predictions from
anisotropic rod theory. The generic bistable and looping behaviors of creased annuli could inspire
the design of novel deployable and morphable structures. We believe our smooth description of
discontinuous geometries will beneﬁt to the mechanical modeling and design of a wide spectrum of
engineering structures that embrace geometric and material discontinuities.
Abrupt changes are ubiquitous in nature and modern engineering, such as the jump of cross sections at a tree
fork, impact forces, mantle discontinuities [1], the interfaces of shock waves [2], and transient behaviors in signal
processing [3], just to name a few. These rapid changes correspond to a step-like jump or a localized spike, which can
be described by a Heaviside function and a Dirac delta function, respectively. In mechanical engineering, material and
geometric discontinuities have been introduced to elastic structures for various outcomes, such as optimal mechanical
properties in stepped beams [4] and remarkable stretchability in ﬂexible electronics [5, 6]. Made by decorating thin
sheets with certain crease patterns, origami structures bring great potential in achieving compact folding [7–10], target
geometries [11–14], and tunable stiﬀness and stability in metamaterials [15–17]. However, it is challenging to study
the mechanics of elastic structures with discontinuities (e.g. creases that correspond to C0 continuity), which normally
require cutting the structure and imposing matching conditions at the discontinuous interfaces [18, 19].
In origami structures, creases have been modeled as discrete hinges [18, 20–24], smooth folds with C1 continuity
[25–27] and as thinner structural elements [28], which all need a careful speciﬁcation of matching conditions between
the creases and the joining facets. Recently, Jules et al. used the Heaviside feature of a hyperbolic tangent function
to describe the local geometry of creases as C∞continuity and studied the mechanics of creased elastica [29].
Here, we propose a ∆function that includes both a boxcar feature and a Dirac delta feature. We use the latter for
a continuous description of the crease geometry and implement it with anisotropic rod theory to study the nonlinear
mechanics of creased annuli, which are found to have generic bistability and rich looping behaviors. We ﬁnd excellent
agreement between precision tabletop models and numerical predictions from anisotropic rod theory, both showing
that the bistability and looping behaviors can be tuned by varying the crease pattern and the overcurvature of the
ﬂat annulus. Overall, our work creates opportunities for folding strips into various shapes by introducing creases.
The analytical framework could facilitate the mechanics design of thin structures embedded with discontinuities for
desired mechanical and geometric properties.
∆FUNCTION
In this work, we use the spike of a regularized Dirac delta function (RDDF) to model the localized curvature of a
crease. We propose the following formulation consisting of two hyperbolic tangent functions,
∆(lb,le)
C
=
1
2(le −lb) [tanh(x −lb
C
) −tanh(x −le
C
)].

First, we report several properties of ∆that may be used for the continuous description of discontinuities. When
C ≪(le −lb), the two steps of hyperbolic tangents are separated and ∆appears to be a boxcar function, with its value
being a constant 1/(le −lb) in the range x ∈[lb,le] and zero elsewhere (see the blue curve in Figure 1). As C →0, ∆
approaches a perfect boxcar function. When (le −lb) < C ∪(le −lb) ∼C, the two steps of hyperbolic tangents collide
and ∆mimics a regularized Dirac delta function (RDDF), symmetric about and maximized at x = (le + lb)/2 (see the
black curve in Figure 1). As (le −lb) →0 and C →0, ∆approaches the Dirac delta function, with its value being
inﬁnite at x = lb = le. In addition, it can be shown that ∫
∞
−∞∆dx = 1 (Supplementary Material SI). When we use ∆
to model the localized curvature of creases, this plays an important role in obtaining target crease angles, which are
determined by the integral of ∆.
The above properties of ∆oﬀer promise for describing various types of discontinuities. For example, using the boxcar
feature of ∆, we can describe any piecewise continuous function as a single continuous piece with C∞(Supplementary
Material SII reports an example characterizing the New York City skyline). In the rest of the paper, we use ∆as a
RDDF to model the curvature of creases in elastic strips and investigate the nonlinear mechanics of creased annuli.
FIG. 1: ∆in Equation (1) can mimic a boxcar proﬁle (blue) and a regularized Dirac delta function (black).
CONTINUOUS DESCRIPTION OF CREASES/KINKS IN ANISOTROPIC RODS
Perfect creases/kinks have a vanishing extension and correspond to C0 continuity, i.e. the local tangent is dis-
continuous that results in a blow up of the local curvature. Due to the material thickness, creases in thin elastic
structures always have a small extension, which results in the localization of the curvature. Here, we combine a series
of ∆functions to describe the rest curvature of anisotropic rods with multiple creases/kinks,

(2)
where nc, γi, s (∈[0,l]), and l represent the number of creases, the ith crease angle (see Figure 2a for the deﬁnition
of crease angle), the arc length of the rod, and its total length, respectively. The prefactor sgni could be ±1 and is used
to prescribe the bending direction of the crease, e.g. the grey accordion in Figures 2a. Ci and (lei −lbi) determine the
local crease proﬁle centered at s=(lei + lbi)/2. With (lei −lbi)→0, our approach degenerates to Jules et al.’s method
that uses a hyperbolic tangent to describe the local tangent angle of creases [29] (Supplementary Material SI). With
Ci≪(lei −lbi), Equation 2 generates uniform bends in the regions s ∈[lbi,lei] with constant curvatures.
We deﬁne (4Ci + lei −lbi) as the nomimal crease length, which results in a crease region s ∈[lbi −2Ci,lei + 2Ci]
and in which most of the crease angle γi is achieved. Decreasing Ci and (lei −lbi) will sharpen the creases and make
them independent of other creases. With the increase of (4Ci + lei −lbi), adjacent creases will overlap and generate
nonﬂat facets. As long as (4Ci +lei −lbi) is small compared with the length of the adjacent facets, the multiple creases
represented by Equation (2) do not aﬀect each other and behave independently. A comprehensive discussion about

3
the inﬂuences of Ci and (lei −lbi) on the crease proﬁle and the errors of crease angles are included in Supplementary
Material SI.
The geometry of the rod is obtained by ﬁrst integrating κ to get the local tangent angle η and then integrating the
kinematic equations to obtain the rod proﬁle. Figure 2a displays two examples with the rod normalized to the same
length 4, including a grey accordion with three unevenly distributed creases of diﬀerent proﬁles and a black square
with four evenly distributed creases of the same proﬁle. η measures the local tangent angle. The grey accordion
contains a uniform crease with an angle γ1 and two nonuniform creases of diﬀerent proﬁles. The two examples in
Figure 2a are used as centerlines to construct strips with kinks (the width of the strip is coplanar to the centerline)
and creases (the width of the strip is perpendicular to the centerline), as shown in Figure 2b.
Figures 2(c-d) present the distribution of the tangent angle η and the rest curvature κ of the two conﬁgurations
in Figure 2a, respectively. At a sharp crease, η approaches a jump resulting in a spike in κ. Increasing the value
of (4Ci + lei −lbi) leads to blunter creases with the jump of η and the spike of κ being smoothed in the horizontal
direction. In the remainder of this article, we apply the above framework to study the bistable and looping behaviors
of creased annuli.

The accordion has nc = 3, (γ1,C1,lb1,le1) = (π/3,0.001,0.4,0.8) , (γ2,C2,lb2,le2) = (π/2,0.1,1.499,1.501), and
(γ3,C3,lb3,le3) = (2π/3,0.01,2.599,2.601). The square has n = 4 and (γi,Ci,lbi,lei) = (π/2,0.01,i −0.501,i −0.499).

GEOMETRY OF CREASED ANNULI AND FABRICATION OF TABLETOP MODELS
Creased annuli are made by ﬁrst introducing evenly distributed radial creases of angle γ to annular strips (with
length L and radius of the centerline rc) and then forcing the two ends to close (Figure 3a). We deﬁne overcurvature
as Oc = L/(2πrc), which measures the number of loops the annuli cover in its ﬂat rest state. The geometric parameters
of the annular strips include number of creases nc, overcurvature Oc, crease angle γ, and the radius rc.
The fabrication process is summarized in Figure 3. We ﬁrst laser cut annular strips with thickness t = 0.254 mm,
width w=5.08 mm, and length L from polyester shim stock (Artus Corp., Englewood, NJ), make nc radial creases at
the desired locations that have been slightly scored by the laser, and close the strip with super glue (Figs. 3a). Then,
we place the closed strip between two 3D printed pyramids with speciﬁc geometries [30], such that the thin strip closely

4
matches the surfaces and ridges of the pyramids (Figs. 3(b-c)); Next, to anneal the crease, we put the pair of stacked
pyramids into an oven at 110○C for one hour and cool the sample down at room temperature (≈21○C), which ﬁxes
the crease angle to be the ridge angle of the pyramids (i.e. the dihedral angle between two lateral surfaces), eliminates
the residual stress inside the crease, and leads to purely elastic creases [29, 31, 32] (Figs. 3(c-d)). After annealing, we
cut the strip and insert (remove) additional (redundant) ﬂat annular strips to adjust the overcurvature (Figure 3e).
Finally, the structure is closed with super glue to obtain creased annuli with target geometry (nc,Oc,γ,rc) (Figs. 3f).
Details of the geometry of the pyramids and the fabrication process are documented in Supplementary Material SIII.
We ﬁnd creased annuli have generic bistability with small overcurvature (Supplementary Video 1) and can be folded
into various shapes by increasing the overcurvature (Supplementary Video 2).

IMPLEMENTATION WITH ANISOTROPIC ROD THEORY
Anisotropic rod theory is normally used to model slender rods or strips with a mild anisotropy of the cross section
[33] (i.e. L >> w ∼t). Several recent studies have demonstrated its accuracy in predicting the nonlinear mechanics of
strips with w/t up to O(10) [34–36]. Throughout this study, we ﬁx w/t to 20 and use an anisotropic rod model to
study creased annuli. The force and moment balances of an inextensible and unshearable rod can be summarized as
N ′ = 0,M ′ + d3 × N
= 0,
(3)
where a prime denotes an s derivative (s (∈[0,l])), and N and M represent contact forces and moments, respectively.
We assume linear constitutive relations M1 = EI1(κ1 −κ10), M2 = EI2(κ2 −κ20), and M3 = GJτ, where the contact
moment M has been resolved on a local material frame (Supplementary Material SIV). E and G are the Young’s
modulus and shear modulus of the constituent isotropic material, respectively; EI1 and EI2, and GJ correspond to the
two bending rigidities and the torsional rigidity, respectively. κ1, κ2 and τ are the curvatures and twist in the deformed
conﬁguration; κ10 and κ20 represent the rest curvatures, which correspond to the geodesic curvature of the annulus
and the localized curvature of the creases, respectively. Here, we have κ10 = 2πOc/L and κ20 = ∑nc
i=1(π −γi)∆(lbi,lei)
Ci
.
In addition, the length of the strip l in numerics is normalized to nc.
To model the sharp creases of creased annuli, we ﬁx (lei −lbi) to a small value 2×10−4Ci, which results in a nominal
crease length 4Ci (notice that (lei −lbi) << Ci). In tabletop models, the crease length mainly depends on the thickness
t of the material and has been shown to be in the order O(t) ∼O(10t) [29, 37]. In order to make the sharpness of
the crease in the numerical modeling be realistic compared with experimental models, we set 10t/(2πrcOc) = 4Ci/l,
where we have estimated the crease length to be 10t and set the ratio between the crease length and the total strip
length to be the same for experiments and numerics. For all the tabletop models, the corresponding Ci is found to
be in [8.42 × 10−4,1.03 × 10−2].

Notice that we have only set the length of the crease in numerics to be approximately the same as the crease length
in experiments; our continuous description of the crease geometry through the speciﬁcation of κ20 does not necessarily
match with the local crease proﬁle in experiments, which could depend on the material and the creasing method. In
Supplementary Material SV, we show that with sharp creases, which are typical for creased thin sheets, the eﬀects
of the local crease geometry on the numerical results are negligible. After nondimensionalization, the only material
parameter is the Poisson’s ratio ν, which we set to 0.33 for the current study. Details of the anisotropic rod model
and its implementation with numerical continuation package AUTO 07P [38] are included in Supplementary Material
SIV.
CREASED ANNULI WITH TUNABLE BISTABILITY AND LOOPING BEHAVIORS
Comparisons between the numerical results (blue renderings) and experimental models (brown) are summarized in
Figure 4 with diﬀerent geometric parameters (nc,Oc,γ,rc). We ﬁnd excellent agreements, except for the folded con-
ﬁgurations where contact exists in physical models and is not included in numerical predictions. The blue renderings
are constructed from anisotropic rod and have the same slenderness (i.e. w/L) with the corresponding experimental
models.
We ﬁnd that creased annuli have generic bistability with small overcurvatures and tunable looping behaviors with
large overcurvatures. In the ﬁrst row of Figure 4 (Oc=0.7), ()1 and ()2 represent a bistable pair and are referred to as
folded and inverted state respectively. For example, (a)1 and (a)2 are a bistable pair that can be manually deformed
to one or the other (Supplementary Video I). In the third row of Figure 4 with a large overcurvature Oc =3, creased
annuli fold into multiply covered loops, e.g. in (c), (f), (i)2, (l), and (o). Notice that with three creases, the folded
conﬁguration (i)2 resemble a triply-covered version of (a)1 and could further be deployed to a stable ﬂower-like shape
in (i)1. With an intermediate overcurvature around 1.5 (the second row in Figure 4), creased annuli with one, two,
there and four creases are monostable, corresponding to (b), (e), (h) and (k), respectively; a creased annulus with
ﬁve creases is bistable, which can be folded into a star conﬁguration (n)2. It is known that annular strips without
creases will fold into multiply covered loops at an overcurvature of odd integers such as Oc = 3,5,7 etc. Our results
show that by introducing radial creases, the out-of-plane mechanical behaviors of annular strips could be signiﬁcantly
enriched, creating various folding patterns and stable conﬁgurations that could be tuned by the number of creases
and overcurvatures.

predictions of anisotropic rod (blue) with diﬀerent geometric parameters (nc,Oc,γ,rc). ()1,2 correspond to a
bistable pair.
We further investigate how overcurvature aﬀects the nonlinear mechanics of creased annuli through numerical
continuation. Figure 5 reports the bifurcation diagram of creased annuli with diﬀerent number of creases in the
Oc −ε plane, with ε=0.5∫
l

6
and b being the two normalized bending stiﬀnesses (Supplementary Material SIV). Here we have ﬁxed (Ci,lei −lbi)
to (0.002,2 × 10−4Ci). Black and grey solid circles represent bifurcation and fold points, respectively. Some of the
unstable branches are partially reported here and truncated by a grey cross. Renderings represent solutions marked
on the curves. Grey and black curves correspond to unstable and stable solutions, respectively. The nonlinear stability
of equilibria is obtained by conducting the conventional conjugate point test for a single rod (Supplementary material
SIV).
The inverted branch (marked by ⧫) loses stability through a fold point with Oc < 1 for nc = 2,3,4 and 5 and Oc≈1
for nc = 1. On the other hand, with the increase of the overcurvature, the folded shape ∎could directly lead to
looped states for nc = 1,2 and 3 following the ∎→☀→▲branch, or lose stability through bifurcations for nc = 4,5
and 6 following the ∎→ →☀branch, with the bifurcated branch ☀connected to looped conﬁguration for nc = 4 or
losing stability through a fold point for nc =5 and 6. In the latter, looped states are independent branches that are
disconnected from the folded state ∎. For example, the ▼→◂→▲branch for nc = 5 and the ▼→◂→ branch for nc = 6
represent multiply-covered branches. Stable states could also exist in a stability island, for example, the ◂→▸branch
for nc = 3 (bounded by two fold points), the ◂branch for nc = 4 (bounded by two bifurcations), the ▲branch for
nc=6 (bounded by two bifurcations), and the▸branch for nc=6 that gains stability through a bifurcation. Generally
speaking, increasing the overcurvature Oc will fold creased annuli into diﬀerent multiply covered shapes, depending
on the number of creases. The looped states normally contain less elastic energy ε. In addition for nc ≥3, increasing
Oc deforms the folded branch (∎) into a ﬂower-like shape, which is stable for nc = 3 (☀) and unstable for nc = 4,5 and
6 (◂).

and grey curves correspond to stable and unstable solutions, respectively.
DISCUSSION
Through precision tabletop models and numerical predictions from anistropic rod theory, we demonstrate that
introducing radial creases to annular strips could signiﬁcantly enrich their nonlinear mechanics by creating generic
bistability and various folding patterns, depending on geometric parameters such as the overcurvature and the crease
pattern. Folding of a large closed structure into smaller multiply covered loops is common in slender structures, such
as rods/strips [39–41], curved folding [18], elastic rod networks [42], and ring origami [43]. Diﬀerent from previous
results, we have demonstrated tunable looping patterns in creased annuli. Our numerical modeling is based on a

7
continuous description of creases through a novel function ∆, which captures the localized curvature at creases.
In Supplementary Material SV, we show that as long as creases are sharp (i.e. the extension of the crease << the
length of its adjacent facets), any RDDF could be used to study creased annuli without causing notable diﬀerences to
its nonlinear mechanics. The ∆function proposed in this work could be used to describe other types of material and
geometric discontinuities, such as the jump of cross sections in stepped beams [4] and the rest curvature of serpentine
strips [5]. In Appendix SVI, we show that a regularized Heaviside function can describe the geometry of 2D surfaces
with discontinuities, which provides opportunities for facilitating the mechanics modeling and design of metasheets
[44, 45].
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fabrication of elastic creased annuli. To obtain elastic creased annuli with target geometric parameters, we ﬁrst
make stress-free creased annuli through annealing, with its geometry prescribed by the surface of regular pyramids.
Then we cut the annealed annuli and insert/remove ﬂat annular arcs to adjust overcurvature. Based on trial and
error, we choose appropriate radii rc for the tabletop models such that they are not too large and do not suﬀer
signiﬁcantly from gravity; at the same time, they are not too small and do not cause apparent plastic deformations
to the materials. The relation between the geometry of the pyramids and the geometry of creased annuli is detailed
in Supplementary Material SIII.
Numerical implementation in continuation package AUTO 07P. Together with anisotropic rod theory, our
continuous modeling of creased annuli is implemented as a two-point boundary value problem in AUTO 07P to con-
duct numerical continuation. We use uniform mesh setting in AUTO to make sure that crease regions have enough
meshes. The start solution, boundary conditions, and continuation steps are detailed in Supplementary Material SIV.
Nonlinear stability of creased annuli. Thanks to our description of creased annuli as a single continuous piece, we
are able to determine the stability of equilibria through the standard conjugate point test. After obtaining equilibria
through numerical continuation, we ﬁrst solve an initial value problem with the forces and moments being the initial
value at s = 0, then stability is determined by examining if conjugate points exist in the interval s ∈[0,l]. Details are
documented in Supplementary Material SIV.

CREASE PROFILES AND ERRORS OF THE CREASE ANGLE
The ∆function used to describe the rest curvature of creased strips leads to creases with certain proﬁles and errors
of the crease angle. Here, we explore the possible crease proﬁles and discuss the resulting errors. We focus on a single
crease whose rest curvature can be described as,
κ0 =
π −γ
2(le −lb) [tanh(s −lb
C
) −tanh(s −le
C
)] = (π −γ)∆(lb,le)
C
,
(S1)
with γ corresponding to the target crease angle. (4C + le −lb) and [lb −2C,le + 2C] represent the nominal crease
length and crease region, respectively. We will show that most of the crease angle is formed in the crease region.
First, the total area below the ∆function is always unity
∫

−∞∆(lb,le)
C
ds =
C
2(le −lb) [ln(cosh(s −lb
C
)) −ln(cosh(s −le
C
))] ∣
∞
−∞= 1.
(S2)
If the rod is inﬁnitely long, we can use Equation S1 to achieve an exact crease angle γ. However, the length of
a realistic rod is always ﬁnite, and thus Equation S1 leads to a crease with the crease angle always bigger than the
target angle γ, because the total turning angle of the tangent is always smaller than the desired angle (π −γ). In
addition, with (le −lb) →0, ∆(lb,le)
C
approaches
1
2C cosh2(
s−lb
C ), which corresponds to Jules et al.’s description of a single
crease in the elastica [29].
Without the loss of generality, we ﬁx lb+le
2
to 1, i.e. the crease is centered at s = 1. The only remaining parameters
aﬀecting the crease proﬁles are (le −lb) and C. Figure S1(b)-(d) display the crease proﬁles and rest curvatures with
diﬀerent parameter settings, corresponding to the colored arrows in Figure S1(a). We have assumed the length of the
rod to be 2 (i.e. s ∈[0,2]) and crease proﬁles are obtained by integrating the rest curvature κ0.
Following the black arrow, we ﬁx (le −lb) to a small number 10−4 and vary C in the range [10−4,1]. With C = 10−4,
the crease is extremely sharp which could be seen through the spike of the curvature. Increasing C makes the crease
blunt and C =1 leads to a shallow arc that does not form the full crease angle. Following the brown arrow, C is ﬁxed
to a small number 10−4 with the increase of (le −lb). In this case, the creases are uniformly bent when (le −lb) >> C,
e.g.
the dashed and dotted renderings in Figure S1(c).
Following the green arrow, we increase (le −lb) and C
simultaneously, resulting in creases similar to those in Figure S1(b). The two shallow dotted arcs in Figures S1(b)
and S1(d) do not fully form the crease angle, because the length of the rod is less than the nominal crease length
(4C + le −lb). For other cases, the resulting crease angle is very close to the target angle γ = π/2.
Next, we quantify the errors by calculating the deviation of the integral of ∆(lb,le)
C
from unity in the region [lb −
βC,le + βC],
Er = 1 −∫
le+βC
lb−βC
∆(lb,le)
C
ds = 1 −
C
le −lb
ln cosh( le−lb
C
+ β)
coshβ
,
(S3)
which shows that Er only depends on the ratio (le −lb)/C. Figure S1e reports Er as a function of (le −lb)/C with
diﬀerent choices of β. When (le −lb)/C →∞, Er →0 no matter what the value of β. When (le −lb) = 0, Er reaches
a maximal value of (1 −tanhβ). For β = 2, the maximal error is 3.6%. In other words, in the nominal crease region
[lb −2C,le +2C], at least 96.4% of the crease angle has been formed. Increasing β reduces the error quickly. For β = 4,
Er is less than 6.71 × 10−4. We conclude that as long as the extremities of the rod are outside the nominal crease
region, we will obtain an accurate crease angle.

NYC-SKYLINE FUNCTION
To characterize the NYC skyline in Figure S2 as a continuous function with C∞, we use the boxcar feature of the
∆function in Equation (1). Figure S2 describes part of the New York City skyline through the following expression
NY C(x) =
53
∑
i=1
fi(x)
2
[tanh(x −lbi
Ci
) −tanh(x −lei
Ci
)] ,
(S4)
where fi(x) represents each segment of the piecewise continuous proﬁle of the NYC skyline. We set Ci to be a
small number 10−4 for all i ∈[1,53] and omit the prefactor 1/(lei −lbi), which leads to ∆=1 in x ∈[lbi,lei] and ∆=0
elsewhere. Here ∆works like a switch that only turns on fi(x) in x ∈[lbi,lei]. Parameters and expressions of NY C(x)
are summarized in table S1.

FABRICATION OF CREASED ANNULAR STRIPS
We 3D print regular pyramids to anneal creases, which ﬁx the crease angle to γ, eliminate the residual stresses,
and result in elastic creases [29, 31, 32]. Figure S3a shows an example of the geometry of a regular pyramid with a
triangular base and a superimposed creased annular strip with three creases. The geometry of the pyramid is fully
determined by the ridge angle γ between two adjacent lateral faces, which sets up the crease angle of creased annuli.
Because γ is always larger than the internal angle of the polygonal base (π −2π/ns), a pyramid with a polygon base

4
of ns sides can be used for annealing creases with an angle larger than (π −2π/ns).
With a prescribed ridge angle γ, the vertex angle of a lateral face ρ can be obtained as
ρ = 2sin−1

(S5)
In order to match the pyramid surface exactly, we laser cut annular strip with an eﬀective length ρrcns (excluding
the gluing length of 2 mm), where rc corresponds to the radius of the centerline. We use super glue to close the strip
with the thickness of the gluing regions being slightly engraved in the cutting process. To achieve precise gluing of
the two ends of annular strips, we 3D print a gadget consisting of a series of circular grooves, through which the two
ends of the annular strip are pushed inside the groove to achieve good alignment (See Figure S3b). Even though
the joint area almost doubles the thickness of the strip, its eﬀects on the nonlinear mechanics of creased annuli are
negligible due to its small length compared with the length of the annuli. After being annealed, the overcurvature of
the stress-free creased annuli is Oc = ρns/(2π). We further cut the annealed strip and insert/remove annular arcs to
adjust its overcurvature Oc. The inserted ﬂat annular arcs are annealed together with the creased annular strips to
make sure all the components of creased annuli have the same material properties.
Theoretically, the shape of creased annuli with a ﬁxed cross section of the strip does not depend on the size of the
experimental models, as long as the strip is slender (i.e. L >> w). However, models with a larger length will be more
ﬂexible and thus suﬀer more from gravity. On the other hand, smaller models have larger curvatures could experience
plastic deformations. The sizes of the physical models (determined by radius rc) are selected by trials and errors,
such that the tabletop models do not suﬀer signiﬁcantly from gravity, and at the same time, do not cause apparent
plastic deformations to the strips. With the strip cross section ﬁxed to w=5.08 mm and t=0.254 mm, we used rc=40
mm for Oc=3, rc=50 mm for Oc=1.5, and rc=70 mm for Oc=0.7 in our tabletop models.

ANISOTROPIC ROD MODEL AND NONLINEAR STABILITY OF EQUILIBRIA
Anisotropic rod theory is normally used to model slender rods with the two dimensions of the cross section being
in the same order of magnitude, e.g. w∼t for a strip with a rectangular cross section. Recent studies have shown that
anisotropic rod model works quantitatively well for capturing the nonlinear mechanics of thin strips with w/t up to
O(10) [34–36]. Here, we use anisotropic rod theory to solve the nonlinear mechanics of creased annuli. Throughout
this study, we ﬁx the aspect ratio of the cross section w/t to 20.
A local orthonormal right-handed material frame (d1,d2,d3) is attached to the centerline of the strip, with d3
corresponding to the local tangent, and d1 and d2 aligned with the width w and thickness t, respectively (see Figure
S4a). The kinematics of the material frame can be described as d′
i = ω × di, with ω = κ1d1 + κ2d2 + τd3 and κ1,κ2
and τ corresponding to two bending curvatures and the twist, respectively. The internal forces and moments can be
resolved on the material frame as N = N1d1 +N2d2 +N3d3 and M = M1d1 +M2d2 +M3d3. Substituting the resolved

5
forces and moments and the kinematics of the material frame into the equilibrium Equations (i.e. Equation (3) in the
main text), we have
N ′
1 −N2τ + N3κ2 = 0,N ′
2 + N1τ −N3κ1 = 0,N ′
3 + N2κ1 −N1κ2 = 0,
M ′
1 −M2τ −N2 + M3κ2 = 0,M ′
2 + M1τ −M3κ1 + N1 = 0,M ′
3 + M2κ1 −M1κ2 = 0.
(S6)
We use linear constitutive laws M1=EI1(κ1−κ10), M2=EI2(κ2−κ20), and M3=GJτ, where E and G are the Young’s
modulus and shear modulus, respectively. EI1, EI2, and GJ are the two bending rigidities and the torsional rigidity,
respectively. κ10 and κ20 correspond to the two bending curvatures of the rest conﬁguration. Here, κ10 = 2πOc/L
and κ20=∑nc
i=1(π −γi)∆(lbi,lei)
Ci
correspond to the geodesic curvature of the annular strip and the curvature of creases,
respectively. Substituting the constitutive laws into Equation (S6), dividing the two sides of each equation by GJ,
and deﬁning the stiﬀness ratios a=EI1/(GJ) and b=EI2/(GJ), we have

where a prime denotes an ¯s derivative (¯s=s/l ∈[0,1] ) and (q1,q2,q3,q4) corresponds to the unit quaternions. In
this study, the arc length s explicitly enters the equation through κ20 and the ﬁnal ODE s′ =l turns the system into
a standard boundary value problem. Following Healey and Mehta [46], the dummy parameter µ in Equation (S7)
allows a consistent prescription of boundary conditions for quaternions. In numerical continuation, we treat µ as a
free parameter and keep monitoring its value, which should be numerically zero [46]. In our work, µ is found to be in
the order of 10−14.
For rods with a rectangular cross section composed of an elastically isotropic material, the bending and twisting

(S9)
Here ν is the Poisson’s ratio, which is set to 0.33 in this study. λ depends on the aspect ratio of the cross section.
For w/t=20, we have λ=0.3228 [47]. For the creased annuli, we clamp the middle of one segment at the origin of a
Cartesian coordinate, with d1, d2, and d3 aligned to z, −y, and x direction, respectively (Figure S4a). The boundary
conditions can be summarized as
x(0) = 0,y(0) = 0,z(0) = 0,q1(0) = 1,q2(0) = 0,q3(0) = 0,q4(0) = 0,
x(1) = 0,y(1) = 0,z(1) = 0,q1(1) = −1,q2(1) = 0,q3(1) = 0,q4(1) = 0,s(0) = 0.
(S10)
Equations S7 and S10 make a well-posed two point boundary value problem with ﬁfteen unknowns N1, N2, N3,
κ1, κ2, τ, q1, q2, q3, q4, x, y, z, s, and µ. To solve the boundary value problem, we conduct numerical continuation
through AUTO 07P, which uses orthogonal collocation and pseudo-arclength continuation to trace the solutions and
detect bifurcations and limit points. We use a stress-free planar annulus in the y −x plane as a starting point for
continuation. The exact solution of the planar circle can be summarized as
N1 = 0,N2 = 0,N3 = 0,κ1 = 2π/l ,κ2 = 0,τ = 0,q1 = cos(π¯s),q2 = 0,q3 = 0,q4 = sin(π¯s),

To obtain the folded and inverted state, we ﬁrst decrease κ10 by decreasing Oc (κ10=2πOc/l), which leads to a pair
of stable conical shapes bifurcated from the planar branch. Then we add crease angle to the bifurcated branches to
obtain a folded and an inverted state, respectively. Finally, we systematically study how geometric parameters such
as overcurvature and number of creases aﬀect the nonlinear mechanics of creased annuli.

stress-free annular strip. (b) A pair of bifurcated conical shapes. (c) Folded (orange) and inverted states (blue).
To determine the stability of an equilibrium solution (κ1,κ2,τ,N1,N2,N3), we adopted a method from geometric
mechanics to test the existence of conjugate point [48, 49], which applies to a single continuous rod with clamp-clamp
boundary conditions. We solve the following matrix diﬀerential equations [48, 49],

Together with the initial conditions D(0) = I6×6 and P(0) = 06×6, we obtain an initial value problem that is solved
with MATLAB. If the solution of Equation (S12) satisﬁes det(P)≠0 for all s ∈(0,l], then the equilibrium is stable.
If det(P)=0 for some s ∈(0,l], then the equilibrium is unstable. If det(P)≠0 for all s ∈(0,l) and det(P(l))=0, then
we cannot conclude the stability and higher order variations of the energy functional need to be considered [48, 49].
Figure S5(a-b) and S5(c-d) summarized the solutions and conjugate point tests of creased annuli with six creases
(l=6) and two creases (l=2), respectively. The bifurcation curves are presented in the energy ε versus overcurvature
Oc plane, with (Ci,lei −lbi) ﬁxed to (0.002,4 × 10−7). Some of the test results det(P) are multiplied with a factor,
which does not aﬀect the stability information. For example, in Figure S5(b), the black curve represents 10−3× the
test result of the solution ⧫in S5(a). In all the tests, unstable solutions contain at least one conjugate point (where
the scaled det(P) crosses zero) and stable solutions are free of conjugate points in s ∈(0,l]. Right at a critical point
such as a fold or bifurcation point, detP(l)=0 and a conjugate point is located exactly at s=l end. For example, the

The rest curvature of a crease with target angle γ can be described as (π −γ)δi. Here Ci controls the sharpness of
the crease and a perfect crease with C0 continuity is achieved by taking the limit Ci →0. Ci is obtained by setting
the nominal crease length of δi to be the same with ∆. Speciﬁcally, in Figure S6a, we have ∫
1.004
0.996 δids = 96.4% for all
i=1,2,3, which is also true for ∆with C =0.002 and (le −lb)=2 × 10−4C.
Figure S6(a) shows the curvature distribution of diﬀerent RDDFs with γ ﬁxed to 0.5π. While the curvature clearly
contains a similar localized feature around the crease at s = 1 (shown as spikes with diﬀerent heights), the inset
shows the signiﬁcant diﬀerences of the curvature in the nominal crease region. The crease proﬁles generated by these
δ functions can be obtained by integrating the curvature, which are shown together in Figure S6(b) for the global
shape and Figure S6(c) for the local crease geometry. We remark that even though the local crease geometry varies
signiﬁcantly across diﬀerent RDDFs, no notable diﬀerences are found in the global shapes. Intuitively, we would
expect that if the various right-angle rods in Figure S6(b) are subject to the same loading, the nonlinear mechanics
responses would be the same, even though the rods may contain very diﬀerent local deformations around the crease
region. Figure S6(d-e) reports the curvature distribution and the corresponding crease proﬁles by scaling the size of

8
the creases in Figure S6(a) up to 150 times. In this case, signiﬁcant diﬀerences among diﬀerent creases are observed
in the global shapes, and we would expect diﬀerent mechanical behaviors of these structures subjected to identical
loading conditions.

with a normalized length 2. (a) Curvature distribution of a sharp crease with γ = π/2. (b) The corresponding rod

RDDFs. (d) Creases that are 150 times the size of (a) are obtained by scaling the geometric parameters accordingly.
(e) The resulted rod geometries from (d) contains signiﬁcant diﬀerences.
In the following, we use an example to demonstrate that as long as creases are sharp, any RDDF can be implemented
to solve the nonlinear mechanics of creased structures. Figure S7 displays numerical results of creased annuli with
(nc,γ) ﬁxed to (2,90○) and the crease described by diﬀerent RDDFs in Equation (S15).
Figure S7(a-b) include
numerical results of sharp creases whose geometric parameters are the same as those in Figure S6(a). With sharp
creases, the diﬀerence in the elastic energy of diﬀerent crease proﬁles is negligible and the deformed shapes almost
coincide with each other, demonstrated through the four square markers and their corresponding renderings. This is
also true for the strains τ and (κ2 −κ20) of the solutions marked by squares, reported in Figure S7(b). The insets in

9
Figure S7(b) shows that notable diﬀerences only exist around the crease region. In contrast, Figures S7(c-d) present
numerical results of blunt creases sharing the same geometric parameters with those in Figure S6(d). With diﬀerent
crease proﬁles, signiﬁcant diﬀerences are found in the elastic energy ε, deformed shapes (the renderings in Figure
S7(c)), and strains (Figure S7(d); corresponding to the squares in Figure S7(c)). We conclude that any RDDF could
be used to model sharp creases without causing notable diﬀerences in the nonlinear mechanics (large deformations,
stability, etc.)
of creased strips.
The ∆function proposed in the current study could address diﬀerent types of
discontinuities because it contains both Heaviside and Dirac-delta features.

CONTINUOUS DESCRIPTION OF 2D SURFACES WITH GEOMETRIC DISCONTINUITIES
The creased annular strips studied in this work contain 1D discontinuities along the arc length of the strip. Here, we
show that a hyperbolic tangent could be used to describe 2D surfaces with discontinuities. 2D steps can be described
through the following equation
H(r(x,y)) = 1
2 [tanh(r(x,y)
C
) + 1] ,
(S16)
where r is a real valued function of x and y and C controls the sharpness of the step. When C →0, H(x,y) = 1 for
r(x,y) > 0 and H(x,y) = 0 elsewhere. The domain r(x,y) > 0 will be referred to as the base of the 2D step and the
curve r(x,y) = 0 represents its boundary. Figures S8a and S8b displays a half-plane based step S with r = 3x + 2y −1
and a dumbbell based step DB with r = x4 −x6 −y2 + 0.01, respectively. The product of several half-plane based step
functions H(ri) can be used to describe a step with a convex polygonal base
P(x,y) =
ns
∏
i=1
H(ri(x,y)),
(S17)
where ns represents the number of sides of the polygonal base. The i-th side of the polygon base is part of the line
ri(x,y) = 0. For a point inside the polygon (xp,yp), we always have ri(xp,yp) > 0. Figure S8c displays a step with a
convex polygonal base, described by the following function
P1 =[0.5(tanh((0.5x −0.1)/C) + 1)][0.5(tanh((−0.1x −0.4y + 0.3)/C) + 1)]
[0.5(tanh((−0.3x −0.1y + 0.24)/C) + 1)][0.5(tanh((−0.1x + 0.5y −0.08)/C) + 1)] .
(S18)
Steps with a concave polygonal base can be obtained by adding those associated to the convex partitions of the
concave base. Figure S8d presents an example combining the geometry in Figure S8(c) and an additional step with
a convex polygonal base, described by the following function,
P2 = P1+[0.5(tanh((−0.6y + 0.42)/C) + 1)][0.5(tanh((−0.1x + 0.2y −0.06)/C) + 1)]
[0.5(tanh((0.1x + 0.4y −0.3)/C) + 1)] .
(S19)
Multiplying H(x,y) by an arbitrary function allows us to generate a new function that equals to the original
function within the base of H and vanishes elsewhere. Figure S8e displays a single dimple on a thin sheet, described
by
D1 = [0.5(tanh((0.25 −x2 −y2)/C) + 1)][1.6(0.25 −x2 −y2)] .
(S20)
Combining several such functions, we are able to decorate multiple dimples of diﬀerent geometries in a thin sheet.
Figure S8f presents an example described by the following function
D2 =[0.5(tanh((0.172 −x2 −y2)/C) + 1)][6(0.172 −x2 −y2)]
+[0.5(tanh((0.152 −(x −0.5)2 −(y −0.5)2)/C) + 1)][7(0.152 −(x −0.5)2 −(y −0.5)2)]
+[0.5(tanh((0.152 −(x + 0.5)2 −(y + 0.5)2)/C) + 1)][7(0.152 −(x + 0.5)2 −(y + 0.5)2)]
+[0.5(tanh((0.152 −(x + 0.5)2 −(y −0.5)2)/C) + 1)][7(0.152 −(x + 0.5)2 −(y −0.5)2)]
+[0.5(tanh((0.152 −(x −0.5)2 −(y + 0.5)2)/C) + 1)][7(0.152 −(x −0.5)2 −(y + 0.5)2)]
+[0.5(tanh((0.252 −(x −0.5)2 −y2)/C) + 1)][3(0.252 −(x −0.5)2 −y2)]
+[0.5(tanh((0.252 −(x + 0.5)2 −y2)/C) + 1)][3(0.252 −(x + 0.5)2 −y2)]
+[0.5(tanh((0.252 −x2 −(y −0.5)2)/C) + 1)][3(0.252 −x2 −(y −0.5)2)]
+[0.5(tanh((0.252 −x2 −(y + 0.5)2)/C) + 1)][3(0.252 −x2 −(y + 0.5)2)] .

The above continuous descriptions of 2D surfaces with discontinuities could be useful in numerical modeling of
shape-morphing metasheets [44, 45]. In addition, H can be used to approximate a complicated surface by partitioning
it, describing each subdomain with a continuous function, and combining these functions together. Figure S9 displays
the external surface of the Empire State Building, characterized by the following function

where the ﬁrst 24 functions contain steps with rectangular bases [xi1,xi2] × [yi1,yi2] and heights zi. Their values
are summarized in table S2. The cylindrical antenna is modeled by the last term, corresponding to a circle based step.
The plot in Figure S9a is obtained with C =0.00001, which plays an important role in determining the sharpness of
the geometric discontinuity. Figures S9(b-d) report this eﬀect by rendering Equation (S22) with larger values of C.
