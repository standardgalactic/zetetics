Preface to the First Edition
Two WORLD WARS
in one
generation,
separated by
an
uninterrupted
chain of local wars and revolutions, followed by no peace treaty for the
vanquished and no respite for the victor, have ended
in the anticipation of
a third World War between the two remaining world powers. This moment
of anticipation
is
like the calm
that
settles
after
all hopes have
died. We
no
longer hope
for an eventual
restoration
of
the
old
world
order
with
all
its
traditions, or for the
reintegration of the masses of
five continents
who have
been thrown
into
a
chaos
produced
by
the
violence
of
wars
and
revolutions and
the growing decay
of
all
that
has
still
been
spared.
Under the most diverse conditions and disparate circumstances, we watch
the development
of
the same phenomena—homelessness on
an
unprece-
dented scale, rootlessness to an unprecedented depth.
Never has our future been more unpredictable, nevej have we depended
so much on political
forces
that cannot be
trusted
to follow
the
rules of
common
sense
and
self-interest—forces
that
look
like
sheer
insanity,
if
judged by
the standards of other centuries.
It
is
as though mankind had
divided
itself between
those who
believe
in
human
omnipotence
(who
think that everything
is possible
if one knows how to organize masses for
it)
and
those
for whom
powerlessness
has become
the major experience
of their lives.
On the
level of historical
insight and
political thought there
prevails an
ill-defined, general agreement that the essential structure of
all civilizations
is
at the breaking point. Although
it may seem
better preserved
in some
parts of the world than
in others,
it can nowhere provide the guidance
to
the possibilities of the century, or an adequate response to
its horrors. Des-
perate^hope and desperate fear often seem closer to the center of such events
than balanced judgment and measured
insight. The
central
events
of our
time are not less effectively forgotten by those committed to a belief in an
unavoidable doom, than by those who have given themselves up to reckless
optimism.
This book has been written against
a background of both
reckless opti-
mism and reckless despair.
It holds that Progress^and Doom are two sides
of the same medal; that both are articles of superstition, not of faith.
It was

vm
PRI-FACE TO
THl-
FIRST
EDITION
written out
of
the
conviction
that
it
should
be
possible
to
discover
the
hidden
mechanics by
which
all
traditional
elements
of our
political
and
spiritual
world
were
dissolved
into
a
conglomeration
where
everything
seems to have lost specific value, and has become unrecognizable for human
comprehension, unusable for human purpose. To yield to the mere process
of
disintegration has become
an
irresistible
temptation,
not
only
because
it
has assumed
the
spurious
grandeur
of
"historical
necessity,"
but
also
because everything outside
it has begun to appear lifeless, bloodless, mean-
ingless, and unreal.
The conviction
that everything that happens on earth must be compre-
hensible to man can lea3^ to interpreting history by commonplaces. Compre-
hension does not mean denying the outrageous, deducing the unprecedented
from precedents, or explaining phenomena by such analogies and generali-
ties
that
the impact of
reality and the shock of experience
are no longer
felt.
It means, rather, examining and bearing consciously the burden which
our century has placed on us—neither denying
its existence nor submitting
meekly to
its weight. Comprehension,
in
short, means the unpremeditated,
attentive facing up to, and resisting of, reality—whatever
it may be.
In this sense,
it must be possible
to face and understand the outrageous
fact that so small (and, in world politics, so unimportant)
a phenomenon as
the Jewish question and antisemitism could become
the
catalytic agent for
first, the Nazi movement, then
a world war, and
finally
the establishment
of death
factories.
Or,
the
grotesque
disparity
between
cause
and
effect
which introduced the era of imperialism, when economic
diflficulties
led,
in
a few decades, to a profound transformation of political conditions
all over
the world. Or, the curious contradiction between the totalitarian movements'
avowed cynical "realism" and their conspicuous disdain of the whole texture
of
reality.
Or,
the
irritating
incompatibility between
the
actual power
of
modern man
(greater than ever before, great to the point where he might
challenge
the
very
existence
of
his own
universe)
and
the
impotence
of
modern men to
live
in, and understand the sense
of,
a world which
their
own strength has established.
The
totalitarian
attempt
at
global
conquest
and
total
domination
has
been
the
destructive way
out
of
all
impasses.
Its
victory may
coincide
with
the destruction
of humanity; wherever
it
has
ruled,
it has begun
to
destroy the essence of man. Yet to turn our backs on the destructive forces
of the century
is of little
avail.
The trouble
is that our period has so strangely intertwined the good with
the bad that without the imperialists' "expansion for expansion's sake," the
world might
never
have become
one;
without
the
bourgeoisie's
political
device of "power for power's
sake,"
the
extent
of human
strength
might
never have been discovered; without the fictitious world of totalitarian move-
ments,
in which with unparalleled clarity the
essential
uncertainties of our
time have been spelled out, we might have been driven to our doom with-
out ever becoming aware of what has been happening.
And
if
it
is true that in the
final stages of totalitarianism an absolute evil

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
IX
appears
(absolute
because
it
can
no
longer
be
deduced
from
humanly
comprehensible
motives),
it
is
also
true
that
without
it we
might
never
have known the^ truly radical nature of Evil.
Antisemitism
(not merely
tTie hatred of Jews), imperialism
(not merely
conquest),
totalitarianism
(not merely
dictatorship)—one
after the
other,
one more
brutally than
the
other, have demonstrated
that human
dignity
needs a new guarantee which can be found only in a new political principle,
in
a new law on
earth,
whose
validity
this
time
must comprehend
the
whole of humanity while
its power must remain
strictly
limited,
rooted
in
and controlled by newly defined
territorial
entities.
We can no longer afford
to take
that which was good
in the
past and
simply
call
it our heritage,
to discard the bad and simply think of
it
as
a
dead
load which
by
itself
time
will
bury
in
oblivion. The
subterranean
stream of Western history has
finally come to the surface and usurped the
dignity of our tradition. This
is the reality in which we live. And this
is why
all efforts to escape from the grimness of the present into nostalgia for a
still
intact past, or into the anticipated oblivion of a better future, are vain.
Summer, 1950


Preface to the Second Enlarged Edition
SINCE
1951, when
this book
first
appeared,
only one
event happened
that had
a
direct bearing upon our understanding of
totalitarianism
and
total domination
as
a novel form of government. This
is not
Stalin's
death, nor even the succession
crisis
in Russia and the
satellite countries,
but
the
Hungarian
revolution—the
first
and
yet
unique
instance
of
a
people's
uprising
against
total
domination.
At
this moment,
hardly
two
years
after
the
uprising, no one
can
tell
whether
this was
only
the
last
and most desperate flare-up of a
spirit which, since
1789, has manifested
itself
in the
series of European
revolutions,
or
if
it
contains
the germ of
something new which will have consequences of
its own. In either case, the
event
itself
is important enough
to
require
a
re-examination of what we
know, or think we know, about totalitarianism. The reader will find in this
new edition a last chapter,
in the form of an Epilogue, where
I have
tried
to bring
the older
story up
to
date. However,
the
reader should bear
in
mind that developments of the year 1958 have not been taken into account,
with the result that the partial restalinization in Soviet Russia and the satel-
lite countries
is hinted at as a strong probability, but not told and analyzed
as an accomplished fact.
This
is
not
the only
addition. As sometimes happens
in such
matters,
there were certain insights of a more general and theoretical nature which
now appear to me
to grow directly out of the
analysis of the elements of
total domination in the third part of the book, but which
I did not possess
when
I
finished
the
original
manuscript
in
1949.
These
are now
incor-
porated
in Chapter
XIII,
"Ideology and
Terror,"
of
the
present
edition
and they replace the rather inconclusive "Concluding Remarks" that closed
the
original
edition, some of which, however, have been
shifted
to other
chapters.
These changes
are not
revisions.
It
is
true
that
in
the
present
edition,
even apart from the two new chapters. Part
III on Totalitarianism and the
last chapters of Part
II on Imperialism
(dealing with such
pretotalitarian
phenomena
as
statelessness and
the
transformation
of
parties
into move-
ments)
are considerably
enlarged,
while
Part
I on
Antisemitism and
the
chapters 5 to 8 on Imperialism have remained untouched. But the changes
are
technical
additions
and
replacements
which do
not
alter
either
the
analysis
or argument
of
the
original
text. They
were
necessary
because
so much
documentary
and
other
source
material
on
the
Hitler
regime
had become
accessible
years
after
this book was
finished. Thus
I knew
the Nuremberg documents
only
in
part and
only
in
English
translations,
and many books, pamphlets and magazines published
in Germany during

XII
PREFACE TO
THI- SECOND ENLARGED EDITION
the war were
not
available
in
this
country.
Additions and
replacements,
therefore,
concern
mainly
quotations
in
text
and
footnotes
where
I
can
now use original
instead of secondary
sources.
However, what
I
tried to do for source material,
I could not do for the
huge
literature
of
recent years on Nazi Germany and
Soviet
Russia. Not
even
all of the more important contributions
are mentioned. While
I
sin-
cerely regret this omission,
I
left out of account, without
regret, the
rather
voluminous
literature
of memoirs
published
by
Nazi
and
other German
functionaries after the end of the war. The dishonesty of this kind of apolo-
getics
is obvious and embarrassing
but
understandable,
whereas
the
lack
of comprehension they display of what actually happened, as well as of the
roles the authors themselves played in the course of events,
is truly aston-
ishing.
For kind permission to peruse and quote
archival
material,
I thank the
Hoover
Library
in
Stanford,
California,
the
Centre
de
Documentation
Juive in Paris, and the Yiddish Scientific Institute in New York. Documents
in
the Nuremberg
Trials
are quoted
with
their Nuremberg
File Number;
other documents
are
referred
to with
indication
of
their present
location
and archival number.
The two new chapters of this edition appeared before
in the Review of
Politics, July
1953, under the
title, "Ideology and
Terror,
a Novel Form
of Government," and
in the Journal of Politics, February
1958, under the
title, "Totalitarian Imperialism:
Reflections on the Hungarian Revolution."
The additions and enlargements of the
present
edition,
with
the excep-
tion
of
the
analysis
of
the
Hungarian
revolution,
appeared
first
in
the
German edition published in 1955. Therefore they had to be translated and
incorporated
into
the
English
edition.
TTiis
difficult
job
of
editing
and
translating was done by Mrs. Therese Pol, to whom
I am greatly indebted.

PART ONE
Antisemitism
This
is a remarkable century which opened with
the Revolution and ended with the
Affaire!
Per-
haps
it will be called the century of rubbish.
ROGER MARTIN DU CARD


CHAPTER one:
Aiitisemitism as an Outrage
to Common Sense
MANY STILL consider
it an accident that Nazi ideology centered around
antisemitism and
that Nazi
policy, consistently and uncompromis-
ingly, aimed
at the persecution and
finally the extermination of the Jews.
Only the horror of the
final catastrophe, and even more the homelessness
and uprootedness of the survivors, made the "Jewish question" so promi-
nent
in our everyday
political
life. What the Nazis themselves claimed
to
be their chief discovery—the role of the Jewish people in world politics
and
their
chief
interest—persecution
of
Jews
all
over
the
world—have
been regarded- by public opinion
as a pretext for winning
the masses or
an interesting device of demagogy.
The failure to take seriously what the Nazis themselves said
is compre-
hensible enough. There
is hardly an aspect of contemporary history more
irritating and mystifying than
the
fact
that of
all the
great unsolved po-
litical questions
of our century,
it should have been
this, seemingly small
and unimportant Jewish problem
that had
the dubious honor
of
setting
the whole
infernal machine
in motion. Such discrepancies between cause
and
efifect outrage our common
sense,
to
say nothing
of
the
historian's
sense of balance and harmony. Compared with
the events themselves,
all
explanations of antisemitism look as
if they had been hastily and hazard-
ously contrived, to cover up an issue which so gravely threatens our sense
js£„proportion and our hope for sanity.
One of these hasty explanations has been the identification of antisemi-
tism
with
rampant
nationalism
and
its
xenophobic
outbursts.
Unfortu-
nately,
the fact
is
that modern antisemitism grew
in proportion
as
tradi-
tional nationalism
declined, and reached
its climax
at the exact moment
when the European system of nation-states and
its precarious balance of
power crashed.
It has already been noticed that the Nazis were not simple nationalists.
Their nationaUst propaganda was directed toward their fellow-travelers and
not
their convinced members; the
latter, on
the contrary, were never
al-
lowed
to
lose
sight
of
a
consistently
supranational approach
to
politics.
Nazi "nationalism" had more than one aspect in common with the recent
nationalistic propaganda
in
the
Soviet Union, which
is
also used only
to
feed the prejudices of the masses. The Nazis had a genuine and never re-

^
ANTISEMITISM
voked contempt for
the narrowness
of
nationalism,
the provinciaHsm
of
the nation-state, and they repeated time and again
that their "movement,"
international in scope like the Bolshevik movement, was more important to
them than any
state, which would necessarily be bound to a specific
terri-
tory. And not only the Nazis, but
fifty years of antiscmitic
history, stand
as evidence against the identification of antisemitism with nationalism. The
first
antisemitic parties
in
the
last decades of the nineteenth century were
also among
the
first
that banded
together
internationally. From
the very
beginning, they called international congresses and were concerned with a
co-ordination of international, or at least inter-European,
activities.
General
trends,
like
the coincident
decline
of
the
nation-state and the
growth of antisemitism, can hardly ever be explained satisfactorily by one
reason or by one cause
alone. The
historian
is
in most such
cases con-
fronted
with
a
very complex
historical
situation where he
is
almost
at
liberty, and that means
at a loss, to isolate one factor as the "spirit of the
time." There
are, however,
a few helpful
general
rules. Foremost among
them for our purpose is Tocqueville's great discovery (in L'Ancien Regime et
la Revolution, Book
II, chap.
1 )
of the motives for the violent hatred
felt
by the French masses for the aristocracy at the outbreak of the Revolution
—a hatred which stimulated Burke to remark that the revolution was more
concerned with "the condition of a gentleman" than with the institution of
a
king.
According
to
Tocqueville,
the
French
people
hated
aristocrats
about
to lose
their power more than
it had ever hated them before, pre-
cisely because
their rapid loss of real power was not accompanied by any
considerable decline in their fortunes. As long as the aristocracy held vast
powers of jurisdiction,
they were not only
tolerated but respected. When
noblemen
lost
their
privileges, among others
the
privilege
to
exploit and
oppress, the people felt them to be parasites, without any real function in
the
rule of the country.
In other words,
neither oppression nor
exploita-
\ tion as such
is ever the main cause for resentment; wealth without visible-'
function
is much more
intolerable because nobody can understand why
Tt'should be tolerated.
Antisemitism
reached
its
climax when
Jews
had
similarly
lost
their
public functions and
their influence, and were
left with nothing but
their
wealth. When
Hitler came
to
power,
the German
banks
were
already
almost judenrein
(and
it was here
that Jews had held key
positions
for
more than a hundred years)
and German Jewry as a whole,
after a long
steady growth in social status and numbers, was declining so rapidly
that
statisticians
predicted
its disappearance
in
a few decades.
Statistics,
it
is
true, do not necessarily point
to
real
historical processes;
yet
it
is
note-
worthy that to a statistician Nazi persecution and extermination could look
like a senseless acceleration of a process which would probably have come
about in any case.
The same
holds
true
for
nearly
all Western European
countries. The
Dreyfus Affair exploded not under the Second Empire, when French Jewry
was
at the height of
its prosperity and influence, but under the Third Re-

ANTISEMITISM AS AN OUTRAGE TO COMMON SENSE
5
public when Jews had
all but vanished from important positions
(though
not from
the
political
scene).
Austrian
antisemitism became
violent not
under the reign of Metternich and Franz Joseph, but
in the postwar Aus-
trian Republic when
it was perfectly obvious
that hardly any other group
had suffered the same loss of influence and prestige through the disappeair
ance of the Hapsburg monarchy.
Persecution
of
powerless
or power-losing
groups may
not be
a
very
pleasant
spectacle,
but
it
does
not
spring from human meanness
alone.
What makes men obey or tolerate real power and, on the other hand, hate
people who have wealth without power,
is the rational
instinct that power
has
a certain function and
is of some general
use. Even exploitation and
oppression
still make society work and establish some kind of order. Only
wealth without power or aloofness without a policy are felt to be parasitical,
useless, revolting, because such conditions cut all the threads which tie men
together. Wealth which does not exploit lacks even
the relationship which
exists between exploiter and exploited; aloofness without policy does not
imply even the minimum concern of the oppressor for the oppressed.
The general decline of Western and Central European Jewry, however,
constitutes
merely
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
subsequent
events
took
place. The decline
itself explains them as
little as the mere loss of power
by the aristocracy would explain
the French Revolution. To be aware of
such general rules
is important only in order to refute those recommenda-
tions
of common
sense which
lead
us
to
believe
that
violent
hatred
or
sudden rebellion spring necessarily from great power and great abuses, and
that consequently organized hatred of the Jews cannot but be a reaction to
their importance and power.
More serious, because
it appeals to much better people,
is another com-
mon-sense fallacy:
the Jews, because they were an entirely powerless group
caught up in the general and insoluble conflicts of the time, could be blamed
for them and finally be made to appear the hidden authors of
all evil. The
best
illustration—and the best refutation—of
this explanation, dear to the
hearts of many
liberals,
is
in a joke which was
told
after the
first World
War. An antisemite claimed
that the Jews had caused
the war;
the reply
was: Yes, the Jews and the bicycHsts. Why the bicyclists? asks the one. Why
the Jews? asks the other.
The theory that the Jews are always the scapegoat implies that the scape-
joaUttight have been anyone else as well.
It upholds the perfect innocence
of the victim, an innocence which insinuates nof only that no evil was done
but
that nothing
at
all was done which might possibly have a connection
jwith
the
issue
at
stake.
It
is
true
that the scapegoat theory
in
its purely
ar'bltrary form
never appears
in
print. Whenever, however,
its
adherents
painstakingly try to explain why a specific scapegoat was so well suited to
his role, they show that they have left the theory behind them and have got
themselves involved in the usual historical research—where nothing
is ever
discovered except that history
is made by many groups and that for certain
reasons one group was
singled
out. The
so-called
scapegoat
necessarily

5
ANTISEMITISM
ceases to be the innocent victim whom the world blames for
all
its sins and
through whom
it wishes
to escape punishment;
it becomes one group
of
people among other groups,
all of which are involved in the business of this
world. And
it does not simply cease to be coresponsible because
it became
the victim of the world's injustice and cruelty.
Until recently the inner inconsistency of the scapegoat theory was
suffi-
cient reason
to discard
it as one of many theories which are motivated by
escapism. But the rise of terror as a major weapon of government has lent
it a credibility greater than
it ever had before.
A fundamental
difference between modem
dictatorships and
all
other
tyrannies of the past
is that terror is no longer used as a means to extermi-
nate and frighten opponents, but as an instrument to rule masses of people
who are perfectly obedient. Terror as we know
it today strikes without any
preliminary
provocation,
its
victims
are
innocent even from
the point
of
view of the persecutor. This was the case in Nazi Germany when full terror
was directed against Jews,
i.e.,
against people with certain common char-
acteristics
which
were
independent
of
their
specific
behavior.
In
Soviet
Russia
the
situation
is more
confused,
but
the
facts,
unfortunately,
are
only too obvious. On the one hand, the Bolshevik system, unlike the Nazi,
never admitted
theoretically
that
it could practice
terror
against innocent
people, and though in view of certain practices this may look like hypocrisy,
it makes
quite
a
difference. Russian
practice, on
the other hand,
is even
more "advanced" than the German in one respect:
arbitrariness of terror
is
not even limited by racial differentiation, while the old class categories have
long since been discarded, so that anybody in Russia may suddenly become
a victim of the police terror. We are not concerned here with the ultimate
consequence of rule by terror—namely, that nobody, not even the executors,
can ever be free of fear; in our context we are dealing merely with the arbi-
trariness by which victims are chosen, and
for
this
it
is decisive that they
are objectively innocent, that tiiey are chosen regardless of what they may
or may not have done.
At first glance this may look like a belated confirmation of the old scape-
goat theory, and
it
is true that the victim of modern terror does show
all
the characteristics of the scapegoat: he
is objectively and absolutely inno-
cent because nothing he did or omitted to do matters or has any connection
with his fate.
There
is, therefore, a temptation to return to an explanation which auto-
matically discharges
the victim of
responsibility:
it seems
quite adequate
to a reality in which nothing strikes us more forcefully than the utter inno-
cence of the individual caught in the horror machine and his utter inability
to change his fate. Terror, however, is only in the last instance of its develop-
J ment a mere form of government. In order to establish a totalitarian regime,
fterror must be presented as an instrument for carrying out a specific ideology;
and that ideology must have won the adherence of many, and even a majority,
before terror can be stabilized. The point for the historian
is that the Jews,
before becoming the main victims of modem terror, were the center of Nazi

ANTISEMITISM AS AN OUTRAGE TO COMMON SENSE
7
ideology. And an^ideology which has to persuade and mobilize people cannot
choose
its victim
arbitrarily.
In other words,
if a patent forgery
like
tfie"
"Protocols of the Elders of Zion"
is believed by so many people that
it can
become the
text of a whole
political movement,
the
task of the historian
is no longer to discover a forgery. Certainly
it
is not to invent explanations
which dismiss the chief political and historical fact of the matter:
that the
forgery
is being believed. This fact is more important than the
(historically
speaking, secondary) circumstance that
it
is forgery.
The
scapegoat explanation
therefore remains one
of
the
principal
at-
tempts to escape the seriousness of antisemitism and the significance of the
fact that the Jews were driven into the storm center of events. Equally wide-
spread
is the opposite doctrine of an "eternal antisemitism" in which Jew-
hatred
is a normal and natural reaction
to which history gives only more
or less opportunity. Outbursts need no special explanation because they are
natural consequences of an eternal problem. That this doctrine was adopted
by professional antisemites
is a matter of course;
it gives the best possible
alibi for
all horrors.
If
it
is
true
that mankind has
insisted on murdering
Jews for more than two thousand years, then Jew-killing
is a normal, and
even human, occupation and Jew-hatred
is
justified beyond
the need
of
argument.
The more
surprising
aspect
of
this explanation,
the assumption
of an
eternal antisemitism,
is that
it has been adopted by a great many unbiased
historians and by an even greater number of Jews. It
is this odd coincidence
which makes the theory so very dangerous and confusing.
Its escapist basis
is in both instances the same:
just as antisemites understandably desire to
escape responsibility for their deeds, so Jews, attacked and on the defensive,
even more understandably do not wish under any circumstances to discuss
their share of responsibility. In the case of Jewish, and frequently of Chris-
tian, adherents of this doctrine, however, the escapist tendencies of
official
apologetics are based upon more important and
less rational motives.
The birth and growth of modern antisemitism has been accompanied by
and interconnected with Jewish assimilation, the secularization and withering
away of the old
religious and
spiritual values
of Judaism. What
actually
happened was that great parts of the Jewish people were at the same time
threatened by physical extinction from without and dissolution from within.
In
this
situation, Jews concerned with the survival of
their people would,
in a curious desperate misinterpretation, hit on the consoling idea that anti-
semitism, after
all, might be an excellent means for keeping the people
to-
gether, so that the assumption of eternal antisemitism would even imply an
eternal
guarantee
of
Jewish
existence.
This
superstition,
a
secularized
travesty of the idea of eternity inherent in a faith in chosenness and a Mes-
sianic hope, has been strengthened through the fact that for many centuries
the Jews experienced the Christian brand of hostility which was indeed a
powerful agent of preservation,
spiritually
as well
as
politically. The Jews
mistook modern anti-Christian antisemitism for the old religious Jew-hatred
—and this all the more irmocently because their assimilation had by-passed

g
ANTISEMITISM
Christianity
in
its religious and cultural aspect. Confronted with an obvious
symptom
of
the
decline
of
Christianity,
they
could
therefore
imagine
in
all
ignorance
that
this was some
revival
of
the
so-called "Dark
Ages."
Ignorance or misunderstanding of their own past were partly responsible for
their
fatal underestimation of the actual and unprecedented dangers which
lay ahead. But one should
also bear
in mind
that lack of
political
ability
and judgment have been caused by the very nature of Jewish history,
the
history'of a people without a government, without a country, and without
a language. Jewish history
offers
the extraordinary
spectacle
of a people,
unique
in
this
respect, which began
its history with a well-defined concept
of
history and
an
almost conscious
resolution
to
achieve
a well-circum-
scribed plan on earth and then, without giving up this concept, avoided
all
political
action
for two thousand
years. The
result was
that
the
political
history of the Jewish people became even more dependent upon unforeseen,
accidental factors than the history of other nations, so that the Jews stumbled
,
<^from one role to the other and accepted responsibility for none. /
In view of the final catastrophe, which brought the Jews so near to com-
plete annihilation, the thesis of eternal antisemitism has become more dan-
gerous than ever. Today
it would absolve Jew-haters of crimes greater than
anybody had ever believed
possible. Antisemitism,
far from being a mys-
terious
guarantee
of
the
survival of
the Jewish
people, has been
clearly
revealed as a threat of its extermination. Yet this explanation of antisemitism,
like the scapegoat theory and for similar reasons, has outlived
its refutation
by
reality.
It
stresses,
after
all,
with
different arguments but equal
stub-
bornness,
that complete and inhuman innocence which so
strikingly char-
acterizes
victims
of modern
terror, and therefore seems confirmed by the
events.
It even has the advantage over the scapegoat theory that somehow
it
answers the uncomfortable question: Why the Jews of all people?—if only
with the question begging reply: Eternal hostility.
It
is quite remarkable that the only two doctrines which at least attempt
to explain
the
political
significance
of the
antisemitic movement deny
all
specific Jewish
responsibility and refuse to discuss matters
in
specific
his-
i/ torical
terms.
In
this
inherent negation
of
the
significance
of human
be-
havior,
they
bear
a
terrible
resemblance
to
those modern
practices
and
forms of government which, by means of arbitrary terror, liquidate the very
possibility
of human
activity. Somehow
in
the extermination camps Jews
were murdered
as
if
in
accordance
with
the
explanation
these
doctrines
had given of why they were hated:
regardless of what they had done or
omitted to do, regardless of vice or virtue. Moreover, the murderers them-
selves, only obeying orders and proud of
their passionless
efficiency, un-
cannily resembled
the
"innocent"
instruments
of an inhuman impersonal
course of events which the doctrine of eternal antisemitism had considered
them to be.
Such common denominators between theory and practice are by them-
selves no indication of
historical
truth, although they are an indication of
the "timely" character of such opinions and
explain why
they sound
so

ANTISEMITISM
AS AN OUTRAGE TO COMMON SENSE

plausible to the multitude. The historian is concerned with them only insofar
as they are themselves part of his history and because they stand in the way
of his search for truth. Being a contemporary, he
is as likely to succumb to
their persuasive force
as anybody
else. Caution
in handling generally
ac-
cepted opinions that claim
to explain whole trends of history
is especially
important for the historian of modern
times, because
the
last century has
produced an abundance of ideologies that pretend to be keys to history but
are actually nothing but desperate efforts to escape responsibility.
Plato,
in his famous
fight against the
ancient
Sophists,
discovered
that
their "universal art of enchanting the mind by arguments" (Phaedrus 261)
had nothing
to do with
truth but aimed
at opinions which by
their very
nature are changing, and which are valid only "at the time of the agreement
and as long as the agreement lasts" (Theaetetus 172). He also discovered
the very insecure position of truth
in the world, for from "opinions comes
persuasion and not from
truth"
(Phaedrus 260). The most
striking
dif-
ference between
ancient
and modern
sophists
is
that
the
ancients
were
satisfied with a passing victory
of
the argument
at
the expense
of
truth,
whereas the moderns want a more lasting victory at the expense of reality.
In other words, one destroyed
the
dignity of human thought whereas
the
others destroy the dignity of human
action. The old manipulators of logic
were the concern of the philosopher, whereas the modern manipulators of
facts stand in the way of the historian. For history itself
is destroyed, and
its
comprehensibility—based upon the fact that
it
is enacted by men and there-
fore can be understood by men—is in danger, whenever facts are no longer
held to be part and parcel of the past and present world, and are misused
to prove this or that opinion.
There are, to be sure, few guides left through the labyrinth of inarticulate
facts
if opinions are discarded and
tradition
is no longer accepted
as un-
questionable. Such perplexities of historiography, however, are very minor
consequences,
considering
the profound
upheavals
of our time and
their
effect upon the historical structures of Western mankind. Their immediate
result has been to expose
all those components of our history which up to
now had been hidden from our view. This does not mean that what came
crashing down
in
this
crisis (perhaps the most profound
crisis
in Western
history since the downfall of the Roman Empire) was mere fagade, although
many things have been revealed as fagade that only a few decades ago we
thought were indestructible essences.
The simultaneous
decline
of
the European
nation-state and growth
of
antisemitic movements, the coincident downfall of nationally organized Eu-
rope and the extermination of Jews, which was prepared for by the victory
of antisemitism over all competing isms in the preceding struggle for persua-
sion of public opinion, have to be taken as a serious indication of the source
of
antisemitism. Modern
antisemitism must be
seen
in
the more
general
framework of the development of the nation-state, and at the same time
its
source must be found
in certain aspects of Jewish
history and
specifically
Jewish functions during the last centuries.
If, in the final stage of disintegra-

10
ANTISEMITISM
tion,
antiscmitic slogans proved
the most
cfTectivc means of inspiring and
organizing great masses of people for imperialist expansion and destruction
of the old forms of government, then the previous history of the relationship
between Jews and
the
state must contain elementary clues
to the growing
hostility between certain groups of society and the Jews. We shall show this
development
in the next chapter.
If, furthermore,
the steady growth of
the modem mob—that
is, of the
dcclassi's of all classes—produced leaders who, undisturbed by the question
of whether the Jews were sufficiently important to be made the focus of a
political
ideology,
repeatedly saw
in them
the
"key
to
history" and
the
central cause of
all
evils, then
the previous history of the
relationship be-
tween
Jews
and
society must
contain
the
elementary
indications
of
the
hostile relationship between the mob and the Jews. We shall deal with the
relationship between Jews and society in the third chapter.
The fourth chapter deals with the Dreyfus AfTair, a kind of dress rehearsal
for the performance of our own time. Because of the peculiar opportunity
it offers of seeing,
in a brief historical moment,
the otherwise hidden po-
tentialities of antisemitism as a major political weapon within the framework
of
nineteenth-century
politics and
its
relatively well-balanced
sanity,
this
case has been treated in full detail.
The following
three chapters,
to be
sure, analyze only
the preparatory
elements, which were not fully realized
until the decay of the nation-state
and the development of imperialism reached the foreground of the political
scene.

CHAPTER two:
THg Jgws, thc Natioii- Statc,
and the Birth of Antisemitism
I:
The Equivocalities of Emancipation
and the Jewish State Banker
AT THE height of
its development in the nineteenth century, the nation-
1-
state granted
its Jewish inhabitants equaHty of rights. Deeper, older,
and more fateful contradictions are hidden behind the abstract and palpa-
ble
inconsistency
that Jews
received
their
citizenship
from
governments
which
in
the process of centuries had made nationality a prerequisite for
citizenship and homogeneity
of population
the
outstanding
characteristic
of the body
politic.
The
series of emancipation edicts which slowly and hesitantly followed
the French
edict
of
1792 had been preceded and were accompanied by
an
equivocal
attitude
toward
its
Jewish
inhabitants on
the
part
of
the
nation-state. The breakdown of the feudal order had given rise to the new
revolutionary
concept
of
equality,
according
to which
a
"nation
within
the
nation"
could no
longer be
tolerated.
Jewish
restrictions
and
privi-
leges had to be abolished together with all other special rights and liberties.
This growth of equality, however, depended largely upon the growth of an
independent
state machine
which,
either
as an
enlightened despotism
or
as
a
constitutional government
above
all
classes
and
parties,
could,
in
splendid
isolation, function,
rule, and represent the
interests of the nation
as a whole. Therefore, beginning with the late seventeenth century, an un-
precedented need arose for state credit and a new expansion of the
state's
sphere of economic and business interest, while no group among the Euro-
pean populations was prepared to grant credit to the state or take an active
part in the development of state business.
It was only natural that the Jews,
with
their age-old experience
as moneylenders and
their connections with
European nobility—to whom they frequently owed local protection and for
whom they used to handle financial matters—would be called upon for help;
it was clearly in the interest of the new state business to grant the Jews cer-
tain privileges and to treat them as a separate group. Under no circumstances
could
the
state
afford
to see them wholly
assimilated
into the
rest of the
population, which refused credit to the state, was reluctant to enter and to

12
ANTISEMITISM
develop
businesses owned by
the
state, and followed
the
routine
pattern
of private capitalistic enterprise.
Emancipation
of
the Jews,
therefore,
as granted by
the
national
state
system
in Europe during
the nineteenth century, had
a double
origin and
an
ever-present equivocal
meaning. On
the one hand
it was due
to
the
political and legal structure of a new body politic which could function only
under the conditions of political and legal equality. Governments, for their
own sake, had to iron out the inequalities of the old order as completely and
as quickly as possible. On the other hand,
it was the clear result of a gradual
extension of specific Jewish privileges, granted originally only to individuals,
then through them
to
a small group
of
well-to-do Jews;
only when
this
limited group could no longer handle by themselves
the ever-growing de-
mands of state business, were these privileges finally extended to the whole
of Western and Central European Jewry.*
Thus,
at the same time and in the same countries, emancipation meant
equality and privileges, the destruction of the old Jewish community auton-
omy and
the conscious
preservation
of
the Jews
as
a
separate group
in
society, the abolition of special restrictions and special rights and the exten-
sion of such rights to a growing group of individuals. Equality of condition
for all nationals had become the premise of the new body politic, and while
this equality had actually been carried out at least to the extent of depriving
the old
ruling
classes
of
their
privilege
to govern and
the
old oppressed
classes of their right to be protected,
the process coincided with
the
birth
of the class society which again separated the nationals, economically and
socially,
as
efficiently
as
the
old
regime.
EquaUty
of
condition,
as
the
Jacobins had
understood
it
in
the French
Revolution, became
a
reality
only
in America, whereas on
the European
continent
it was
at once
re-
placed by a mere formal equality before the law.
The fundamental contradiction between a political body based on equality
before
the law and a
society based on
the inequality of
the
class system
prevented the development of functioning republics
as well as the birth of
a new poUtical hierarchy. An insurmountable inequality of social condition,
1 To
the modern
historian
rights and
Uberties
granted
the
court Jews
during
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries may
appear
to
be
only
the
forerunners
of
equality:
court Jews
could
live wherever
they
liked,
they were
permitted
to
travel
freely within
the realm of
their sovereign, they were allowed
to
bear arms and had
rights
to
special
protection from
local
authorities.
Actually
these
court
Jews,
char-
acteristically
called
Generalpn'vilegierte
Jiidcn
in
Prussia,
not
only
enjoyed
better
living
conditions
than
their
fellow Jews who
still
lived
under
almost
medieval
re-
strictions,
but
they were
better
off than
their
non-Jewish
neighbors.
Their
standard
of
living was much
higher than
that of
the contemporary
middle
class,
their
privi-
leges
in most cases were
greater than those granted
to
the
nicrch:>nts. Nor
did
this
situation escape
the
attention of
their contemporaries. Christian Wilhelm Dohm,
the
outstanding
advocate
of
Jewish
emancipation
in
eighteenth-century
Prussia,
com-
plained of the practice,
in force since the time of Frederick William
I, which granted
rich
Jews
"all
sorts
of
favors
and
support"
often
"at
the
expense
of,
and
with
neglect of
diligent
legal
[that
is, non-Jewish]
citizens." In Denkwurdigkeiten meiner
Zeit, Lemgo,
1814-1819, IV, 487.

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism
13
the fact that class membership on the continent was bestowed upon the in-
dividual and, up to the
first World War, almost guaranteed to him by birth,
could nevertheless exist side by side with political equality. Only politically
backward
countries,
like Germany, had
retained
a few
feudal
remnants.
There members of the aristocracy, which on the whole was well on
its way
to transforming itself into a class, had a privileged political status, and thus
could preserve
as a group
a certain
special
relationship
to
the
state. But
these were remnants. The
fully developed
class system meant
invariably
that the status of the individual was defined by his membership
in his own
class and his relationship
to another, and not by his position
in the
state
or within
its machinery.
The only exceptions
to
this
general
rule were the Jews. They
did not
form a class of their own and they did not belong to any of the classes in
their countries. As a group, they were neither workers, middle-class people,
landholders, nor peasants. Their wealth seemed to make them part of the
middle class, but they did not share in
its capitalist development; they were
scarcely represented in industrial enterprise and
if, in the last stages of their
history in Europe, they became employers on a large scale, they employed
white-collar personnel and not workers. In other words, although their status
was defined through their being Jews,
it was not defined through their rela-
tionship to another class. Their special protection from the state (whether
in the old form of open
privileges, or a special emancipation
edict which
no other group needed and which frequently had to be reinforced against
the hostility of society) and their special services to the governments pre-
vented their submersion in the class system as well as their own establish-
ment as a class.- Whenever,
therefore, they were admitted to and entered
society, they became a well-defined, self-preserving group within one of the
classes, the aristocracy or the bourgeoisie.
There
is no doubt that the nation-state's interest in preserving the Jews
as a special group and preventing their assimilation into class society coin-
cided with the Jewish interest in self-preservation and group survival.
It
is
also more
than
probable
that without
this
coincidence
the governments'
attempts would have been in vain; the powerful trends toward equalization
of all citizens from the side ot the state and incorporation of each individual
into a class from the side of society, both clearly implying complete Jewish
assimilation, could be frustrated only through a combination of government
intervention and voluntary co-operation. Official policies for the Jews were,
after
all, not always so consistent and unwavering as we may believe
if we
consider only the final results.^ It is indeed surprising to see how consistently
2 Jacob
Lestschinsky,
in
an
early
discussion
of
the
Jewish
problem,
pointed
out
that Jews
did
not
belong
to any
social
class, and spoke of
a
"Klasseneinschiebsel"
(in
Weltwirtschafts-Archiv,
1929, Band
30,
123 ff.),
but saw only
the disadvantages
of
this
situation
in Eastern Europe, not
its great advantages
in Western and Central
European countries.
3 For example, under
Frederick
11
after
the
Seven
Years' War,
a decided
effort
was made
in Prussia to incorporate
the Jews
into a kind of mercantile system. The

J4
ANTISEMITISM
Jews neglected
their chances for normal capitalist enterprise and business.*
But without the
interests and practices of the governments, the Jews could
hardly have preserved their group identity.
In contrast
to
all other groups, the Jews were defined and their position
determined by
the body
politic.
Since, however,
this body
politic had no
other social
reality, they were,
socially speaking,
in the void. Their
social
inequality was quite dilTerent from the inequality of the class system;
it was
again mainly the result of their relationship to the state, so that, in society,
the very fact of being born a Jew would either mean
that one was over-
privileged—under special protection of the government—or underprivileged,
lacking certain rights and opportunities which were withheld from the Jews
in order to prevent their assimilation.
The schematic outline of the simultaneous rise and decline of the Euro-
pean
nation-state system and European Jewry unfolds roughly
in the
fol-
lowing stages:
1. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries witnessed the slow develop-
ment of nation-states under the
tutelage of absolute monarchs.
Individual
Jews everywhere rose out of deep obscurity into the sometimes glamorous,
and always influential, position of court Jews who financed state affairs and
handled
the
financial
transactions
of
their
princes.
This development
af-
fected the masses who continued to

it affected the Jewish people as a whole.

After the French Revolution, which abruptly changed political condi-
tions on the whole European continent,
nation-states
in
the modern sense
emerged whose business transactions required a considerably larger amount
of capital and credit than the court Jews had ever been asked to place at a
older
general Juden-reglement of
1750 was supplanted by a system of regular
per-
mits
issued only
to those
inhabitants who
invested a considerable
part of
their
for-
tune
in new manufacturing
enterprises. But
here,
as everywhere
else, such govern-
ment attempts
failed completely.

a

the

eighteenth
century:
"When
the mirror factory
in Neuhaus, Lower Austria, which was subsidized by the adminis-
tration,
did not produce,
the Jew Wertheimer gave
the Emperor money
to buy
it.
When asked
to take over the factory he refused, stating that his time was taken up
with
his
financial
transactions."

In
this
tradition, which kept
rich Jews from real positions of power
in capitalism,
is the fact that in
1911
the Paris Rothschilds sold their share
in the oil wells of Baku
to
the Royal
Shell group,
after having been, with
the exception of
Rockefeller,
the
world's biggest petroleum
tycoons. This
incident
is
reported

Andre Sayou's statement ("Les Juifs"
in Revue Economique
Interruitionale,
1932)
in his polemic against Werner Sombart's identification of Jews with capitalist develop-
ment, may be taken
as a general
rule:
"The
Rothschilds and
other
Israelites who
were
almost
exclusively engaged
in
launching
state
loans and
in
the
international
movement
of
capital,
did
not
try
at
all ... to
create
great
industries."

Only
the
combined
wealth
of
the
wealthier
strata
of
Western and Central European Jewry, which they entrusted to some promi-
nent Jewish bankers for such purposes, could
suffice
to meet the new en-
larged governmental
needs.
This
period
brought
with
it
the
granting
of
privileges, which up
to
then had been
necessary only
for court Jews,
to
the larger wealthy class, which had managed to settle in the more important
urban and financial centers in the eighteenth century. Finally emancipation
was granted in all full-fledged nation-states and withheld only in those coun-
tries where Jews, because of
their numbers and
the general backwardness
of these regions, had not been
able
to organize themselves
into a
special
separate group whose economic
function was
financial
support
of
their
government.
3.
Since this intimate relationship between national government and Jews
had rested on the indifference of the bourgeoisie to politics
in general and
state finance
in particular,
this period came to an end with the
rise of im-
perialism
at the end of the nineteenth century when
capitalist business
in
the form of expansion could no longer be carried out without active political
help and intervention by the
state. Imperialism, on the other hand, under-
mined
the
very
foundations
of
the
nation-state and
introduced
into
the
European
comity
of
nations
the
competitive
spirit
of
business
concerns.
In the early decades of this development, Jews lost their exclusive position
in
state business to imperialistically minded businessmen; they declined
in
importance
as
a
group,
although
individual Jews kept
their
influence
as
financial advisers and as inter-European middlemen. These Jews, however
in contrast to the nineteenth-century
state bankers—had even
less need of
the Jewish community
at large, notwithstanding
its wealth, than
the court
Jews of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, and
therefore
they
fre-
quently
cut
themselves
off completely from
the
Jewish community. The
Jewish communities were no longer financially organized, and although
in-
dividual Jews in high positions remained representative of Jewry as a whole
in the eyes of the Gentile world, there was
little
if any material reality be-
hind
this.
4. As
a group. Western Jewry
disintegrated
together with
the
nation-
state during the decades preceding
the outbreak
of
the
first World War.
The rapid decline of Europe after the war found them already deprived of
their former power, atomized into a herd of wealthy individuals. In an im-
perialist age, Jewish wealth had become insignificant; to a Europe with no
sense of balance of power between
its nations and of inter-European solidar-
ity,
the non-national, inter-European Jewish "lement became an object of
universal hatred because of
its useless wealth, and of contempt because of
its lack of power.
The
first governments
to need regular income and secure finances were
the
absolute
monarchies under which
the
nation-state came
into
being.
Feudal princes and kings also had needed money, and even credit, but for
specific purposes and temporary operations only; even in the sixteenth cen-

16
ANTISEMITISM
tury, when
the Fuggers put
their own
credit
at
the disposal
of
the
state,
they were not yet thinking of establishing a special state credit. The absolute
monarchs
at
first provided
for
their financial needs partly through
the old
method
of war and
looting,
and
partly
through
the new
device
of
tax
monopoly. This undermined the power and ruined the fortunes of the nobil-
ity without assuaging the growing hostility of the population.
For a long time the absolute monarchies looked about society for a class
upon which to rely as securely as the feudal monarchy had upon the nobility.
In France an incessant struggle between the guilds and the monarchy, which
wanted to incorporate them into the state system, had been going on since
the fifteenth century. The most interesting of these experiments were doubt-
less
the
rise of mercantilism and the attempts of the absolute
state
to get
an
absolute monopoly over national business and
industry. The
resulting
disaster, and the bankruptcy brought about by
the concerted resistance of
the rising bourgeoisie, are sufficiently well known.
Before the emancipation edicts, every princely household and every mon-
arch in Europe already had a court Jew to handle financial business. During
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, these court Jews were always single
individuals who had inter-European connections and inter-European credit
at their disposal, but did not form an international financial
entity." Char-
* The
influence, however, of
mercantile
experiments on
future
developments can
hardly be overrated. France was the only country where
the mercantile system was
tried consistently and resulted in an early flourishing of manufactures which owed their
existence
to
state
interference;
she
never
quite
recovered
from
the
experience.
In
the
era
of
free
enterprise,
her
bourgeoisie
shunned
unprotected
investment
in
native
industries while her bureaucracy, also a product of the mercantile system,
sur-
vived
its
collapse.
Despite
the
fact
that
the
bureaucracy
also
lost
all
its
productive
functions,
it
is even today more characteristic of the country and a greater impediment
to her recovery than the bourgeoisie.
" This
had
been
the
case
in
England
since Queen
Elizabeth's
Marrano
banker
and the Jewish financiers of Cromwell's armies, until one of the twelve Jewish brokers
admitted to the London Stock Exchange was said to have handled one-quarter of
all
government loans of his day (see Salo W. Baron, A Social and Religious History of the
Jews,
1937,
Vol.
II:
Jews and Capitalism);
in
Austria, where
in
only
forty
years
(1695-1739),
the Jews
credited
the
government
with
more
than
35
million
florins
and where
the death
of Samuel Oppenheimer
in
1703
resulted
in
a grave
financial
crisis for both state and Emperor; in Bavaria, where in 1808 80 per cent of all govern-
ment loans were endorsed and negotiated by Jews
(see M. Grunwald, Samuel Oppen-
heimer und sein Kreis,
1913);
in France, where mercantile conditions were especially
favorable
for
the
Jews, Colbert
already
praised
their
great
usefulness
to
the
state
(Baron, op. cit., loc. cit.), and where in the middle of the eighteenth century the German
Jew, Licfman Calmer, was made a baron by a grateful king who appreciated services
and
loyalty
to
"Our
state
and
Our
person"
(Robert
Anchel,
"Un
Baron
Juif

in Souvenir
et Science,
I, pp. 52-55); and
also
in
Prussia where
Frederick
II's Miinzjuden
were
titled
and
where,
at
the end
of the eighteenth century, 400 Jewish families formed one of the wealthiest groups
in
Berlin. (One of the best descriptions of Berlin and the
role of the Jews
in
its society
at the turn of the eighteenth century
is to be found
in Wilhelm Dilthey, Das Leben
Schleiermachers,
1870,
pp.
182 ff.).

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism
17
acteristic of these times, when Jewish individuals and the
first small wealthy
Jewish communities were more powerful than at any time in the nineteenth
century/ was
the
frankness
with which
their
privileged
status and
their
right to
it was discussed, and the careful testimony of the authorities to the
importance of their services to the state. There was not the slightest doubt
or ambiguity about the connection between services rendered and privileges
granted. Privileged Jews received noble
titles almost as a matter of course
in France, Bavaria, Austria and Prussia, so that even outwardly they were
more than just wealthy men. The fact that the Rothschilds had such a hard
time getting their appHcation for a
title approved by the Austrian govern-
ment
(they succeeded in 1817), was
the
signal
that a whole period had
come to an end.
By the end of the eighteenth century it had become clear that none of the
estates or classes in the various countries was willing or able to become the
new ruUng class, that is to identify itself with the government as the nobihty
had done for centuries.* The failure of the absolute monarchy ta find a sub- "/
stitute within society led to the full development of the nation-state and
its
claim
to be above
all
classes, completely independent
of
society and
its
particular interests, the true and only representative of the nation as a whole.
It resulted, on the other side, in a deepening of the split between state and
society upon which the body politic of the nation rested. Without
it, there
would have been no need—or even
any
possibility—of
introducing
the
Jews into European history on equal terms.
When
all attempts to
ally
itself with one of the major classes
in society
had failed, the state chose to establish
itself as a tremendous business con-
cern. This was meant to be for administrative purposes only, to be sure, but
the range of interests, financial and otherwise, and the costs were so great
that one cannot but recognize the existence of a special sphere of state busi-
ness from the eighteenth century on. The independent growth of state busi-
ness was caused by a
conflict with the
financially powerful forces
of
the
time, with the bourgeoisie which went the way of private investment, shunned
all state intervention, and refused active financial participation in what ap-
peared
to be an "unproductive"
enterprise. Thus
the Jews were
the only
part of the population willing
to
finance the
state's beginnings and
to
tie
their destinies to its further development. With their credit and international
connections, they were in an excellent position to help the nation-state to

1703, and

ish audience.
8 The only, and irrelevant, exception might be those tax collectors, called fermiers-
generaux,
in France, who rented from the
state the right to collect taxes by guaran-
teeing a
fixed amount
to the government. They earned
their
great wealth from and
depended directly upon the absolute monarchy, but were too small a group and too

establish

the
biggest enterprises and employers
of
the
time.'
Great
privileges,
decisive changes
in
the Jewish
condition, were
neces-
sarily the price of the fulfillment of such services, and, at the same time, the
reward for great risks. The greatest privilege was equality. When the Miinz-
juden of Frederick of Prussia or
the court Jews of the Austrian Emperor
received through "general privileges" and "patents" the same status which
half a century later all Prussian Jews received under the name of emancipa-
tion and equal
rights; when,
at
the end
oi'
the eighteenth century and
at
the
height
of
their wealth,
the Berlin Jews managed
to prevent an
influx
from the Eastern provinces because they did not care to share their "equal-
ity" with poorer brethren whom they did not recognize as equals; when, at
the time of tlie French National Assembly, the Bordeaux and Avignon Jews
protested
violently
against
the French
government's
granting
equality
to
Jews of the Eastern provinces—it became clear that at least the Jews were
not thinking
in terms of equal rights but of privileges and special
liberties.
And
it
is really not surprising that privileged Je^vs, intimately linked to the
businesses of their governments and quite aware of the nature and conditions
of their status, were reluctant to accept for
all Jews
this
gift of a freedom
which they themselves possessed as the price for services, which they knew
had been
calculated
as such and
therefore could hardly become
a
right
for
all.^o
Only at the end of the nineteenth century, with the rise of imperialism,
did
the owning classes begin
to change
their original estimate of
the un-
productivity
of
state
business.
Imperialist
expansion,
together
with
the
growing perfection of
the instruments
of violence and
the
state's absolute
monopoly of them, made the state an interesting business proposition. This
meant, of course,
that
the Jews gradually but automatically
lost
their ex-
clusive and unique position.
But the good fortune of the Jews,
their
rise from obscurity to
political
significance, would have
to come
to an even
earlier end
if they had been
confined
to a mere business function
in the growing nation-states. By the
middle of the
last century some states had won enough confidence
to get

along without Jewish
backing and
financing
of government
loans. ^^ The
nationals' growing consciousness, moreover, that their private destinies were
becoming more and more dependent upon those
of
their
countries made
them ready to grant the governments more of the necessary credit. Equality
itself was symbolized
in the
availability to
all of government bonds which
were
finally even considered
the
most
secure form
of
capital
investment
simply because
the
state, which
could wage
national
wars, was
the
only
agency which actually could protect
its citizens' properties. From the middle
of the nineteenth century on, the Jews could keep their prominent position
only because they had
still another more important and fateful role to play,
a role
also intimately
linked
to
their participation
in the
destinies
of the
state. Without
territory and without
a government of their own,
the Jews
had always been an inter-European element;
this
international
status
the
nation-state necessarily preserved because the Jews' financial services rested
on
it. But even when
their economic
usefulness had exhausted
itself,
the
inter-European status of the Jews remained of great national importance in
times of national conflicts and wars.
While the need of the nation-states for Jewish services developed slowly
and
logically, growing out of the general context of European history, the
rise of the Jews to political and economic significance was sudden and un-
expected to themselves as well as their neighbors. By the later Middle Ages
the
Jewish moneylender had
lost
all
his former
importance,
and
in
the
early
sixteenth
century Jews had
already
been
expelled from
cities
and
trade
centers
into
villages
and
countryside,
thereby
exchanging
a more
uniform
protection from remote
higher
authorities
for an
insecure
status
granted by petty local nobles.'- The turning point had been in the seventeenth
century when,
during
the
Thirty
Years' War,
precisely
because
of
their
dispersion
these
small,
insignificant
moneylenders
could
guarantee
the
necessary provisions to the mercenary armies of the war-lords
in far-away
lands and with the aid of small peddlers buy
victuals
in
entire provinces.
Since these wars remained half-feudal, more or
less private
affairs
of the
princes,
involving no
interest of other classes and
enlisting no help from
the people, the Jews' gain in status was very limited and hardly visible. But
the number of court Jews increased because now every feudal household
needed the equivalent of the court Jew.
As long as these court Jews served small feudal lords who,
as members

only
the
Jews,

state credit based upon the

superfluous.

that
after
1830
"public
credit already became
less of a
risk so
that Christian banks began
to handle
this
business

increasing
measure."

these
interpretations
stands
the
fact

ANTISEMITISM
of the
nobility, did not aspire to represent any centralized
authority, they
were the servants of only one group in society. The property they handled,
the money they lent, the provisions they bought up,
all were considered the
private property of
their master, so
that such
activities could not involve
them in political matters. Hated or favored, Jews could not become a political
issue of any importance.
When, however,
the function
of the feudal
lord changed, when he de-
veloped into a prince or king, the function of his court Jew changed too. The
Jews, being an alien element, without much interest in such changes in their
environment, were
usually
the
last
to become aware
of
their heightened
status. As far as they were concerned, they went on handling private busi-
ness, and their loyalty remained a personal affair unrelated to political con-
siderations. Loyalty meant honesty;
it did not mean taking sides in a con-
flict or remaining true for political reasons. To buy up provisions, to clothe
and feed an army,
to lend currency for the
hiring
of mercenaries, meant
simply an interest in the well-being of a business partner.
This kind of relationship between Jews and aristocracy was the only one
that ever
tied a Jewish group
to another stratum
in
society.
After
it
dis-
appeared
in the
early nineteenth
century,
it was never replaced.
Its only
remnant for the Jews was a penchant for
aristocratic
titles
(especially
in
Austria and France), and for the non-Jews a brand of liberal antisemitism
which lumped Jews and nobility together and pretended that they were in
some kind of
financial
alliance
against the
rising bourgeoisie. Such
argu-
mentation, current in Prussia and France, had a certain amount of plausibility
as long as there was no general emancipation of the Jews. The
privileges
of the court Jews had indeed an obvious similarity to the rights and liberties
of the nobility, and
it was true that the Jews were as much afraid of losing
their privileges and used the same arguments against equality as members of
the aristocracy. The plausibility became even greater in the eighteenth cen-
tury when most privileged Jews were given minor titles, and at the opening
of the nineteenth century when wealthy Jews who had
lost their
ties with
the Jewish communities looked for new social
status and began
to model
themselves on
the
aristocracy. But
all
this was
of
little consequence,
first
because
it was quite obvious that the nobility was on the decline and that
the Jews, on the contrary, were continually gaining in status, and also be-
cause the aristocracy
itself, especially in Prussia, happened to become the
first class that produced an antisemitic ideology.
The Jews had been the purveyors in wars and the servants of kings, but
they did not and were not expected to engage
in the
conflicts themselves.
When these conflicts enlarged into national wars, they
still remained an in-
ternational element whose importance and usefulness lay precisely in their
not being bound
to any national cause. No longer
state bankers and pur-
veyors in wars
(the
last war financed by a Jew was the Prussian-Austrian
war of 1866, when Bleichroeder helped Bismarck after the latter had been
refused
the
necessary
credits by
the Prussian Parliament),
the Jews had
become the financial advisers and assistants in peace treaties and, in a less

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism
21
organized and more indefinite way, the providers of news. The last peace
treaties drawn up without Jewish assistance were those of the Congress of
Vienna, between the continental powers and France. Bleichroeder's role in
the peace negotiations between Germany and France in 1871 was akeady
more significant than his help in war," and he rendered even more impor-
tant services
in
the
late seventies when, through
his connections with
the
Rothschilds, he provided Bismarck with an indirect news channel to Ben-
jamin Disraeli. The peace treaties of Versailles were the last in which Jews
played a prominent role as advisers. The last Jew who owed his prominence
on
the national scene
to
his
international Jewish
connection was Walter
Rathenau, the
ill-fated foreign minister of the Weimar Republic. He paid
with his
life
for having
(as one
of his colleagues put
it
after
his death)
donated his prestige
in the international world of finance and the support
of Jews everywhere
in the world ^*
to the ministers of the new Republic,
who were completely unknown on the international scene.
That antisemitic governments would not use Jews for the business of war
and peace
is obvious. But the elimination of Jews from
the international
scene had a more general and deeper significance than antisemitism.
Just
because the Jews had been used as a non-national element, they could be
of value in war and peace only as long as during the war everybody tried
consciously to keep the possibilities of peace intact, only as long as every-
body's aim was a peace of compromise and the re-establishment of a modus
Vivendi. As soon as "victory or death" became a determining policy, and
war
actually aimed
at
the complete
annihilation
of
the enemy,
the Jews
could no
longer be
of any
use.
This
policy
spelled
destruction
of
their
collective existence in any case, although the disappearance from the political
scene and even extinction of a specific group-life would by no means neces-
sarily have
led
to
their
physical
extermination. The
frequently
repeated
argument, however, that the Jews would have become Nazis as easily as their
German fellow-citizens
if only they had been permitted to join the move-
ment, just as they had enlisted in Italy's Fascist party before Italian Fascism
introduced race legislation,
is only half true.
It
is true only with respect to
the psychology of individual Jews, which of course did not greatly
differ
from the psychology of their environment. It is patently false in a historical
sense. Nazism, even without antisemitism, would have been the deathblow
to the existence of the Jewish people in Europe; to consent to
it would have

representative^ of
Central European
reactionary governments from
Metternich
to
Bismarck,
had one thing in common: they were
all sincerely concerned with the "bal-
ance of power" in Europe. They tried, of course, to shift this balance to the
advantage of their respective countries, but they never dreamed of seizing a
monopoly over the continent or of annihilating their neighbors completely.
The Jews could not only be used in the interest of this precarious balance,
they even became
a kind of symbol of the common
interest of the Euro-
pean nations.
It
is therefore more than accidental that the catastrophic defeats
of the
peoples of Europe began with the catastrophe of the Jewish people.
It was
particularly easy to begin the dissolution of the precarious European balance
of power with the elimination of the Jews, and particularly difficult to under-
stand
that more was involved
in
this elimination than an unusually
cruel
nationalism or an ill-timed revival of "old prejudices." When the catastrophe
came, the fate of the Jewish people was considered a "special case" whose
history
follows
exceptional
laws, and whose
destiny was
therefore
of no
general relevance. This breakdown of European solidarity was
at once
re-
flected
in
the breakdown of Jewish
solidarity
all over Europe. When
the
persecution of German Jews began, Jews of other European countries
dis-
covered that German Jews constituted an exception whose fate could bear
no resemblance to their own. Similarly, the collapse of German Jewry was
preceded by
its split into innumerable factions, each of which believed and
hoped that its basic human rights would be protected by special privileges
the privilege of having been a veteran of World War
I, the child of a veteran,
the proud son of a father killed in action.
It looked as though the annihila-
tion of
all individuals of Jewish origin was being preceded by the bloodless
destruction and self-dissolution of the Jewish people, as though the Jewish
people had owed
its existence exclusively to other peoples and their hatred.
It
is
still one of the most moving aspects of Jewish history that the Jews'
active
entry
into European
history was
caused
by
their
being
an
inter-
European, non-national element in a world of growing or existing nations.
That this role proved more lasting and more essential than their function as
state bankers
is one
of the
material
reasons
for the new modern type
of
Jewish
productivity
in
the
arts and
sciences.
It
is
not
without
historical
justice that their downfall coincided with the ruin of a system and a political

body which, whatever
its other
defects, had needed and could
tolerate a
purely European element.
The grandeur of this consistently European existence should not be for-
gotten because
of the many undoubtedly
less
attractive
aspects of Jewish
history during the last centuries. The few European authors who have been
aware of this aspect of the "Jewish question" had no special sympathies for
the Jews, but an unbiased estimate of the whole European situation. Among
them was
Diderot,
the
only
eighteenth-century
French
philosopher who
was not hostile to the Jews and who recognized
in them a useful link be-
tween Europeans
of
different
nationalities; Wilhelm von Humboldt who,
witnessing
their emancipation
through
the French
Revolution, remarked
that the Jews would
lose
their
universality when they were changed
into
Frenchmen; ^^
and
finally
Friedrich
Nietzsche, who
out
of
disgust
with
Bismarck's German Reich coined the word "good European," which made
possible his correct estimate of the significant role of the Jews in European
history, and saved him from falling into the pitfalls of cheap philosemitism
or patronizing "progressive" attitudes.
This
evaluation,
though
quite
correct
in
the
description
of
a
surface
phenomenon, overlooks the most serious paradox embodied in the curious
political history of the Jews. Of
all European peoples,
the Jews had been
the only one without a state of their own and had been, precisely for
this
reason, so eager and so suitable for alliances with governments and
states
as such, no matter what these governments or
states might represent. On
the other hand, the Jews had no political tradition or experience, and were
as
little aware of the tension between society and state as they were of the
obvious risks and power-possibilities of their new role. What little knowledge
or
traditional practice they brought
to
politics had
its source
first
in
the
Roman Empire, where they had been protected, so to speak, by the Roman
soldier, and later, in the Middle Ages, when they sought and received pro-
tection against the population and the local rulers from remote monarchical
and Church authorities. From these experiences, they had somehow drawn
the conclusion that authority, and especially high authority, was favorable
to them and that lower
officials, and especially the common people, were
dangerous. This
prejudice, which expressed a
definite
historical
truth but
no longer corresponded to new circumstances, was as deeply rooted in and
as
unconsciously
shared by
the
vast
majority
of Jews
as
corresponding
prejudices about Jews were commonly accepted by Gentiles.
The history of the relationship between Jews and governments
is rich in
examples of how quickly Jewish bankers switched their allegiance from one

government to the next even after revolutionary changes.
It took the French
Rothschilds in 1848 hardly twenty-four hours to transfer their services from
the government of Louis
Philippe
to the new short-lived French Republic
and again to Napoleon
III. The same process repeated
itself,
at a
slightly
slower pace, after the downfall of the Second Empire and the estabhshment
of the Third Republic. In Germany this sudden and easy change was sym-
bolized,
after the revolution of 1918,
in the financial policies of the War-
burgs on one hand and the shifting political ambitions of Walter Rathenau
on the other.*"
More
is involved in this type of behavior than the simple bourgeois pat-
tern which always assumes
that nothing succeeds
like
success.*' Had
the
Jews been bourgeois
in
the ordinary sense of
the word,
they might have
gauged correctly the tremendous power-possibilities of their new functions,
and
at least have
tried to play that fictitious
role of a secret world power
which makes and unmakes governments, which antisemites assigned to them
anyway.
Nothing,
however,
could be
farther from
the
truth. The
Jews,
without knowledge
of
or
interest
in power,
never thought
of
exercising
more than mild pressure for minor purposes of
self-defense. This lack of
ambition was later sharply resented by the more assimilated sons of Jewish
bankers and businessmen. While some of them dreamed, like Disraeli, of a
secret Jewish society to which they might belong and which never existed,
others, hke Rathenau, who happened
to be
better informed,
indulged
in
half-antisemitic
tirades against the wealthy traders who had neither power
nor social status.
This innocence has never been quite understood by non-Jewish statesmen
or historians. On the other hand, their detachment from power was so much
taken for granted by Jewish representatives or writers that they hardly ever
mentioned
it except to express their surprise at the absurd suspicions leveled
against them. In the memoirs of statesmen of the last century many remarks
occur to the effect that there won't be a war because Rothschild in London
or Paris or Vienna does not want
it. Even so sober and reliable a historian
as
J. A. Hobson could state as late as 1905: "Does any one seriously sup-
pose that a great war could be undertaken by any European state, or a great
state loan subscribed,
if the House of Rothschild and its connexions set their
face against it?" ** This misjudgment
is as amusing in
its naive assumption

Rathenau,
foreign
minister
of
the Weimar
Republic
in
1921
and one
of
the
outstanding
representatives
of Germany's new
will
to
democracy, had
pro-
claimed as
late as 1917
his "deep monarchical convictions," according
to which only
an "anointed" and no
"upstart
of
a
lucky career"
should
lead a country.

it
were

a

the
methods
of
the
house
of

differ much from those of their Gentile colleagues. For

that everyone
is like oneself, as Mettemich's sincere belief that "the house
of Rothschild played a greater role in France than any foreign government,"
or his confident prediction to the Viennese Rothschilds shortly before the
Austrian revolution
in
1848:
"If
I should go
to the dogs, you would go
with me." The truth of that matter was
that the Rothschilds had as
little
political idea as other Jewish bankers of what they wanted to carry out in
France, to say nothing of a well-defined purpose which would even remotely
suggest a war. On
the
contrary,
like
their fellow Jews
they never
allied
themselves with any specific government, but rather with governments, with
authority as such. If at this time and later they showed a marked preference
for monarchical governments as against republics,
it was only because they
rightly suspected that republics were based to a greater extent on the will
of the people, which they instinctively mistrusted.
How deep the Jews' faith in the state was, and how fantastic their ignorance
of actual conditions in Europe, came to light in the last years of the Weimar
Republic when,
already reasonably frightened about
the
future,
the Jews
for once tried their hand in politics. With the help of a few non-Jews, they
then
founded
that
middle-class
party
which
they
called
"State-party"
(Staatspartei) , the very name a contradiction in terms. They were so naively
convinced that their "party," supposedly representing them in political and
social
struggle, ought to be the
state
itself,
that the whole
relationship of
the party to the state never dawned upon them. If anybody had bothered to
take seriously this party of respectable and bewildered gentlemen, he could
only have concluded that loyalty
at any price was a fagade behind which
sinister forces plotted to take over the state.
Just as the Jews ignored completely the growing tension between state and
society, they were also the
last to be aware that circumstances had forced
them
into
the center of
the
conflict. They
therefore never knew how
to
evaluate antisemitism, or rather never recognized the moment when social
discrimination changed into a political argument. For more than a hundred
years, antisemitism had slowly and gradually made
its way into almost
all
social
strata
in almost
all European countries
until
it emerged suddenly
as the one issue upon which an almost unified opinion could be achieved.
The law according to which
this process developed was simple: each class
of society which came into a conflict with the
state
as such became
anti-
semitic because the only social group which seemed to represent the state
were the Jews. And the only class which proved almost immune from anti-
semitic propaganda were
the workers who, absorbed in the
class
struggle
and equipped with a Marxist explanation of history, never came into direct
conflict with the state but only with another class of society, the bourgeoisie,
which the Jews certainly did not represent, and of which they were never a
significant part.
The
poUtical emancipation
of
the Jews
at
the
turn
of
the
eighteenth
century
in some
countries, and
its
discussion
in
the
rest of Central and
Western Europe, resulted
first of
all in a decisive change in their attitude

26
ANTISEMITISM
toward the state, which was somehow symbolized in the rise of the house of
Rothschild, The new policy of these court Jews, who were the first to become
full-fledged state bankers, came to light when they were no longer content
to
serve one
particular
prince
or government
through
their
international
relationships
with court Jews
of other countries, but decided
to
establish
themselves
internationally and
serve
simultaneously and
concurrently
the
governments
in Germany, France, Great
Britain,
Italy and Austria. To a
large extent,
this unprecedented course was a reaction
of
the Rothschilds
to the dangers of real emancipation, which, together with equality,
threat-
ened to nationalize the Jewries of the respective countries, and to destroy
the very inter-European advantages on which the position of Jewish bankers
had rested. Old Meyer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the house, must
have recognized that the inter-European status of Jews was no longer secure
and that he had better try to realize this unique international position in his
own family. The establishment of his five sons in the five financial capitals
of Europe—Frankfurt, Paris, London, Naples and Vienna—was his ingeni-
ous way out of the embarrassing emancipation of the Jews."
The Rothschilds had entered upon their spectacular career as the financial
servants of the Kurfurst of Hessen, one of the outstanding moneylenders of
his time, who taught them business practice and provided them with many
of their customers. Their great advantage was that they lived in Frankfurt,
the only great urban center from which Jews had never been expelled and
where they formed nearly 10 per cent of the city's population at the begin-
ning of the nineteenth century. The Rothschilds started as court Jews without
being under the jurisdiction of either a prince or the Free City, but directly
under the authority of the distant Emperor in Vienna. They thus combined
all the advantages of the Jewish
status
in the Middle Ages with those of
their own times, and were much less dependent upon nobility or other local
authorities than any of their fellow court Jews. The later financial activities
of the house, the tremendous fortune they amassed, and their even greater
symbolic fame since the early nineteenth century, are sufficiently well known.^"
They entered the scene of big business during the last years of the Napoleonic
wars when—from 1811
to 1816—almost half the EngUsh subventions
to
the Continental powers went through
their hands. When
after
the
defeat
of Napoleon the Continent needed great government loans everywhere for
the reorganization of
its state machines and the erection of financial struc-
tures on the model of the Bank of England, the Rothschilds enjoyed almost a
monopoly
in the handling of state loans. This lasted for three generations

during which they succeeded in defeating
all Jewish and non-Jewish com-
petitors in the
field. "The House of Rothschild became," as Capefigue put
it,-i "the chief treasurer of the Holy Alliance."
The international establishment of the house of Rothschild and its sudden
rise above
all other Jewish bankers changed the whole structure of Jewish
state
business. Gone was
the
accidental development, unplanned and un-
organized, when
individual Jews shrewd enough
to
take
advantage
of
a
unique opportunity frequently rose
to the heights of great wealth and
fell
to
the depths of poverty
in one man's
lifetime; when such
a
fate hardly
touched
the
destinies
of
the Jewish people
as
a whole except
insofar
as
such Jews sometimes had
acted
as
protectors and
petitioners
for
distant
communities; when, no matter how numerous the wealthy moneylenders or
how influential the individual court Jews, there was no sign of the develop-
ment
of
a
well-defined
Jewish group which
collectively
enjoyed
specific
privileges and rendered
specific
services.
It was
precisely the Rothschilds'
monopoly on the issuance of government loans which made
it possible and
necessary to draw on Jewish capital at large, to direct a great percentage of
Jewish wealth
into the channels of state business, and which thereby pro-
vided the natural basis for a new inter-European cohesiveness
of Central
and
Western
European
Jewry. What
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries had been an unorganized connection among
individual Jews
of
different
countries, now became
the more
systematic
disposition
of
these
scattered opportunities by a single firm, physically present in
all important
European capitals, in constant contact with all sections of the Jewish people,
and in complete possession of all pertinent information and all opportunities
for organization.^^
The exclusive position of the house of Rothschild
in the Jewish world
replaced to a certain extent the old bonds of religious and spiritual tradition
whose gradual loosening under the impact of Western culture for the
first
time
threatened
the
very
existence
of
the
Jewish
people. To
the
outer
world,
this one family also became a symbol of the working reality of Jew-
ish
internationalism
in
a world
of
nation-states and
nationally
organized
peoples. Where, indeed, was there better proof of the fantastic concept of
a Jewish world government than in this one family, nationals of five different
countries, prominent everywhere,
in close co-operation with
at
least three
different governments
(the French, the Austrian, and the
British), whose
frequent
conflicts never
for a moment shook
the
solidarity of
interest
of
their
state
bankers? No propaganda could have
created
a symbol more
effective for political purposes than the reality itself.
The popular notion
that the Jews—in contrast
to other peoples—were
tied together by the supposedly closer bonds of blood and family
ties, was
to a large extent stimulated by the reality of this one family, which virtually

Jewish capital for their own business transactions and how
far

28
ANTISEMITISM
represented
the whole economic
and
political
significance
of
the
Jewish
people. The
fateful consequence was
that when,
for
reasons
which had
nothing
to do with
the Jewish
question,
race problems came
to
the
fore-
ground
of
the
political
scene,
the Jews
at once
fitted
all
ideologies and
doctrines which defined a people by blood ties and family characteristics.
Yet another,
less
accidental,
fact accounts for
this image of the Jewish
people. In the preservation of the Jewish people the family had played a far
greater role than in any Western political or social body except the nobility.
Family ties were among the most potent and stubborn elements with which
the
Jewish people
resisted
assimilation and
dissolution.
Just
as
declining
European
nobility strengthened
its marriage and house
laws,
so Western
Jewry became all the more family-conscious in the centuries of their spiritual
and
religious
dissolution. Without the old hope for Messianic redemption
and the firm ground of traditional folkways, Western Jewry became over-
conscious of the fact that their survival had been achieved in an alien and
often hostile environment. They began to look upon the inner family circle as
a kind of last fortress and to behave toward members of
their own group
as though
they were members
of a big family.
In other words,
the
anti-
semitic picture of the Jewish people
as a family closely knit by blood
ties
had something in common with the Jews' own picture of themselves.
This situation was an important factor
in the
early^
rise and continuous
growth
of antisemitism
in the nineteenth century. Which group
of people
would turn antisemitic in a given country at a given historical moment de-
pended exclusively upon general circumstances which made them ready for
a violent antagonism to their government. But the remarkable similarity of
arguments and images which time and again were spontaneously reproduced
have an intimate relationship with the truth they distort. We find the Jews
always
represented
as
an
international
trade
organization,
a
world-wide
family concern with
identical
interests everywhere,
a
secret force behind
the throne which degrades all visible governments into mere facade, or into
marionettes whose strings are manipulated from behind the scenes. Because
of their close relationship to state sources of power, the Jews were invariably
identified with power, and because of their aloofness from society and con-
centration upon the closed
circle of the family, they were invariably sus-
pected of working for the destruction of all social structures.

popular hatred of Jews in Poland and Rumania. There, due to the inability
of
the governments
to
solve
the land question and
give
the
nation-state
a minimum
of
equality
through
liberation
of
the
peasants,
the
feudal
aristocracy succeeded not only
in maintaining
its
political dominance but
also
in preventing
the
rise of a normal middle
class. The Jews
of
these
countries,
strong
in number and weak
in every other
respect,
seemingly
fulfilled some of the functions of the middle class, because they were mostly
shopkeepers and traders and because as a group they stood between the big
landowners and the propertyless
classes. Small property holders, however,
can exist as well in a feudal as in a capitalist economy. The Jews, here as
elsewhere, were unable or unwilling
to develop
along
industrial
capitalist
lines,
so
that
the
net
result
of
their
activities was
a
scattered,
inefficient
organization
of consumption
without an adequate
system
of production.
The Jewish positions were an obstacle for a normal capitalistic development
because they looked as though they were the only ones from which economic
advancement might be expected without being capable of fulfilling this ex-
pectation. Because of their appearance, Jewish interests were
felt to be in
conflict with those
sections
of
the population from which a middle
class
could normally have developed. The governments, on the other hand, tried
halfheartedly
to encourage a middle
class without liquidating
the
nobility
and big landowners. Their only serious attempt was economic liquidation
of the Jews—partly as a concession to public opinion, and partly because
the Jews were
actually
still
a part of the old feudai order. For centuries
they had been middlemen between
the
nobility and peasantry; now they
formed a middle class without
fulfilling
its productive functions and were
indeed one of the elements
that stood
in the way of industrialization and
capitalization."
These
Eastern
European
conditions,
however,
although
they constituted the essence of the Jewish mass question, are of
little im-
portance in our context. Their political significance was limited to backward
countries where the ubiquitous hatred of Jews made
it almost useless as a
weapon for specific purposes.
Antisemitism
first flared up in Prussia immediately
after the defeat by
Napoleon
in
1807, when the "Reformers" changed the
political structure
so that the nobility lost its privileges and the middle classes won their free-
dom
to
develop.
This
reform,
a
"revolution from
above,"
changed
the
half-feudal structure of Prussia's enhghtened despotism into a more or less
modern nation-state whose final stage was the German Reich of 1871.
Although a majority of the Berlin bankers of the time were Jews, the
Prussian reforms did not require any considerable financial help from them.
The outspoken
sympathies
of
the
Prussian
reformers,
their advocacy
of
Jewish emancipation, was the consequence of the new equality of all citizens,
the abolition of privilege, and the introduction of free trade. They were not
interested in the preservation of Jews
as Jews for special purposes. Their

these conditions

iv and
vi.

ANTISEMITISM
reply
to
the argument
that under conditions
of equaUty
"the Jews might
cease to exist" would always have been:
"Let them. How does
this matter
to a government which asks only that they become good citizens?" -' Emanci-
pation, moreover, was
relatively
inoffensive,
for Prussia had
just
lost
the
eastern
provinces
which
had
a
large
and
poor
Jewish
population. The
emancipation
decree
of
1812
concerned
only
those
wealthy
and
useful
Jewish groups who were already privileged with most civic rights and who,
through the general abolition of privileges, would have suffered a severe loss
in civil status. For these groups, emancipation meant not much more than
a general legal affirmation of the status quo.
But the sympathies of the Prussian reformers for the Jews were more than
the logical consequence of their general political aspirations. When, almost
a decade later and in the midst of rising antisemitism, Wilhelm von Hum-
boldt declared: "I love the Jews really only en masse; en detail I rather avoid
them," ^^ he stood of course in open opposition
to
the prevailing fashion,
which
favored
individual Jews
and
despised
the
Jewish
people. A
true
democrat, he wanted to liberate an oppressed people and not bestow privi-
leges upon
individuals. But
this view was
also
in
the
tradition of the old
Prussian government
officials, whose
consistent
insistence
throughout
the
eighteenth
century
upon
better
conditions
and
improved
education
for
Jews have frequently been recognized. Their support was not motivated by
economic or
state reasons
alone, but by a natural sympathy
for the only
social group that also stood outside the social body and within the sphere
of the
state,
albeit for entirely different reasons. The education of a
civil
service whose loyalty belonged to the state and was independent of change
in government, and which had severed
its
class
ties, was one of the out-
standing achievements of the old Prussian
state. These
officials were a de-
cisive group
in eighteenth-century
Prussia, and the
actual predecessors
of
the Reformers; they remained the backbone of the state machine all through
the nineteenth
century, although
they
lost much of
their influence
to
the
aristocracy after thd Congress of Vienna. ^^
Through the attitude of the Reformers and especially through the emanci-
pation edict of 1812, the special
interests of the state
in the Jews became
manifest in a curious way. The old frank recognition of their usefulness
as
Jews (Frederick
II of Prussia exclaimed, when he heard of possible mass-
conversion:
"I hope
they won't do such
a
devilish
thing!")

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism
31
special Jewish services would have been sacrilege, according to the mentality
of the time. The special conditions which had led to emancipation, though
well known
to everybody concerned, were now hidden
as
if they were
a
great and terrible secret. The edict
itself, on the other hand, was conceived
as the last and, in a sense, the most shining achievement of change from a
feudal state into a nation-state and a society where henceforth there would
be no special privileges whatsoever.
Among the naturally bitter reactions of the aristocracy, the class that was
hardest hit, was a sudden and unexpected outburst of antisemitism. Its most
articulate
spokesman, Ludwig von
der
Marwitz
(prominent among
the
founders
of a conservative ideology), submitted a lengthy
petition
to
the
government in which he said that the Jews would now be the only group
enjoying special advantages, and spoke of the
"transformation
of the old
awe-inspiring Prussian monarchy into a new-fangled Jew-state." The political
attack was accompanied by
a
social
boycott which changed
the
face
of
Berlin
society almost overnight. For
aristocrats had been among the
first
to
establish
friendly
social
relationship
with Jews and had made famous
those salons of Jewish hostesses
at the turn of the century, where a truly
mixed society gathered for a brief time. To a certain extent,
it
is true,
this
lack
of prejudice was
the
result
of
the
services
rendered by
the Jewish
moneylender who for centuries had been excluded from
all greater business
transactions
and
found
his
only
opportunity
in
the
economically
un-
productive and insignificant but socially important loans to people who had
a tendency to
live beyond
their means. Nevertheless,
it
is remarkable that
social relationships survived when the absolute monarchies with their greater
financial possibilities had made the private loan business and the individual
small court Jew a thing of the past. A nobleman's natural resentment against
losing a valuable source of help
in emergencies made him want to marry
a Jewish girl with a rich father rather than hate the Jewish people.
Nor was the outburst of aristocratic antisemitism the
result of a closer
contact between Jews and
nobility. On the contrary, they had
in common
an instinctive opposition to the new values of the middle
classes, and one
that sprang from very similar sources. In Jewish as well as in noble families,
the individual was regarded
first of
all as a member of a family; his duties
were
first of
all determined by the family which transcended the
life and
importance
of
the
individual.
Both
were
a-national
and
inter-European,
and each understood
the
other's way of
life
in which
national
allegiance
was secondary to loyalty to a family which more often than not was scattered
all over Europe. They shared a conception that the present
is nothing more
than an insignificant link in the chain of past and future generations. Anti-
Jewish liberal writers did not fail to point out this curious similarity of prin-
ciples, and they concluded that perhaps one could get rid of nobility only by
first getting rid of the Jews, and this not because of their financial connections
but because both were considered to be a hindrance to the true development
of that "innate personality," that ideology of self-respect, which the liberal

32
ANTISEMITISM
middle classes employed in their fight against the concepts of birth, family,
and
heritage.
These pro-Jewish factors make
it
all the more significant that the aristo-
crats
started
the
long
line
of
antisemitic
political
argumentation.
Neither
economic
ties nor social intimacy carried any weight
in a situation where
aristocracy openly opposed the egalitarian nation-state.
Socially, the attack
on the state identified the Jews with the government; despite the fact that the
middle
classes,
economically
and
socially,
reaped
the
real
gains
in
the
reforms, politically they were hardly blamed and suffered the old contemptu-
ous aloofness.
After the Congress of Vienna, when during the long decades of peaceful
reaction under the Holy Alliance, Prussian nobility had won back much of
its influence on the state and temporarily become even more prominent than
it had ever been in the eighteenth century, aristocratic antisemitism changed
at once into mild discrimination without further poHtical
significance.^® At
the same
time,
with
the
help
of
the
romantic
intellectuals,
conservatism
reached its full development as one of the political ideologies which in Ger-
many adopted a very characteristic and ingeniously equivocal attitude toward
the Jews. From then on the nation-state, equipped with conservative argu-
ments, drew a distinct line between Jews who were needed and wanted and
those who were not. Under the pretext of the essential Christian character
of the state—what could have been more alien to the enlightened despots!
the growing Jewish intelligentsia could be openly discriminated against with-
out harming the affairs of bankers and businessmen. This kind of discrimina-
tion which
tried
to close the
universities
to Jews by excluding them from
the civil services had the double advantage of indicating that the nation-state
valued special services higher than equality, and of preventing, or at least
postponing, the birth of a new group of Jews who were of no apparent use
to the state and even
likely to be assimilated into
society.^^ When,
in the
eighties, Bismarck went to considerable trouble to protect the Jews against
Stoecker's antisemitic propaganda, he said expresses verbis that he wanted
to
protest
only
against
the
attacks
upon
"moneyed
Jewry
.
.
. whose
interests are tied to the conservation of our state institutions" and that his
friend Bleichroeder, the Prussian banker, did not complain about attacks on
Jews in general (which he might have overlooked) but on rich Jews.^°

emancipation

reason why

were

In
1823
Frederick
William

"the

renovations," and

successor, Frederick Wil-

amalgamation between the Jews and the other inhabitants" of his kingdom. Elbogen,

The seeming equivocation with which government
officials on
the one
hand protested
against equality
(especially professional
equality)
for
the
Jews, or complained somewhat
later about Jewish
influence
in
the
press
and yet, on the other, sincerely "wished them well in every respect," ^^ was
much more suited to the interests of the
state than the
earlier zeal of the
reformer. After
all,
the Congress
of Vienna had returned
to
Prussia
the
provinces
in which
the poor Jewish masses had
lived
for
centuries, and
nobody but a few intellectuals who dreamed of the French Revolution and
the Rights of Man had ever thought of giving them the same status as their
wealthy brethren—who certainly were the last to clamor for an equality by
which they could only lose.^" They knew as well as anybody else that "every
legal or political measure for the emancipation of the Jews must necessarily
lead to a deterioration of their civic and social situation." ^^ And they knew
better than anybody else how much their power depended upon their posi-
tion and prestige within the Jewish communities. So they could hardly adopt
any other policy but
to "endeavor
to
get more
influence
for
themselves,
and keep
their fellow Jews
in
their national
isolation, pretending that
this
separation
is part of their religion. Why?
.
.
. Because the others should
depend upon them even more, so that they, as unsere Leute, could be used
exclusively by those in power." ** And
it did turn out that in the twentieth
century, when emancipation was for the
first time an accomplished fact for
the Jewish masses, the power of the privileged Jews had disappeared.
Thus a perfect harmony of interests was established between the powerful
Jews and the state. Rich Jews wanted and obtained control over their fellow
Jews and segregation from non-Jewish
society;
the
state could combine
a
policy
of benevolence toward
rich Jews with
legal
discrimination
against
the Jewish intelligentsia and furtherance of social segregation,
as expressed
in the conservative theory of the Christian essence of the state.

quence and subsided quickly

be
carried out
against
the
desires of

representatives was common knowledge
in
the
eighteenth
century. Mirabeau
argued before
the Assemblee Nationale

1789:
"Gentlemen,
is
it because
the Jews
don't want to be citizens that you don't proclaim them citizens? In
a government
like
the one you now establish,

ANTISEMITISM
and radical intellectuals inspired and led a new movement immediately after
the Congress of Vienna.
Liberal opposition
to
Metternich's
police regime
on the continent and bitter attaclcs on the reactionary Prussian government
led
quickly
to
antisemitic
outbursts and
a
veritable
flood
of
anti-Jewish
pamphlets.
Precisely because
they were much
less candid and outspoken
in
their
opposition
to
the government
than
the
nobleman
Marwitz had
been
a decade
before,
they attacked the Jews more than
the government.
Concerned mainly with equal opportunity and resenting most of
all the re-
vival of aristocratic
privileges which
limited
their admission
to
the public
services,
they introduced
into
the discussion
the
distinction between
indi-
vidual Jews,
"our brethren," and Jewry
as
a group,
a
distinction which
from then on was to become the trademark of leftist antisemitism. Although
they did not fully understand why and how the government, in
its enforced
independence from society, preserved and protected the Jews as a separate
group, they knew well enough
that some
political connection existed and
that the Jewish question was more than a problem of individual Jews and
human tolerance. They coined the new nationalist phrases "state within the
state," and "nation within the nation." Certainly wrong in the
first instance,
because the Jews had no pohtical ambitions of their own and were merely
the only social group that was unconditionally loyal to the state, they were
half right
in the second, because the Jews, taken
as a social and not as a
political body, actually did form a separate group within the nation. ^^
In Prussia, though not in Austria or in France,
this radical antisemitism
was almost as short-lived and inconsequential as the earlier antisemitism of
nobility. The
radicals were more and more absorbed by
the liberalism of
the economically rising middle classes, which
all over Germany some twenty
years later clamored in their diets for Jewish emancipation and for realiza-
tion of political equahty.
It established, however, a certain theoretical and
even literary tradition whose influence can be recognized in the famous anti-
Jewish writings of the young Marx, who so frequently and unjustly has been
accused of antisemitism. That the Jew, Karl Marx, could write the same way
these anti-Jewish radicals did
is only proof of how
little
this kind of
anti-
Jewish argument had
in common with
full-fledged
antisemitism. Marx
as
an
individual Jew was
as
little embarrassed by
these
arguments
against
"Jewry" as, for instance, Nietzsche was by his arguments against Germany.
Marx,
it
is true, in his later years never wrote or uttered an opinion on the
Jewish question; but this
is hardly due to any fundamental change of mind.
His
exclusive preoccupation with
class
struggle
as
a phenomenon
inside
society, with the problems of capitahst production in which Jews were not
involved as either buyers or sellers of labor, and his utter neglect of political
questions, automatically prevented his further inspection of the state struc-
ture, and thereby of the role of the Jews. The strong influence of Marxism
on the labor movement in Germany is among the chief reasons why German

revolutionary movements showed so few
signs
of an ti-Jewish sentiment. ^^
The Jews were indeed of little or no importance for the social struggles of
the time.
The beginnings
of the modem
antisemitic movement date back
every-
where
to
the
last
third
of the
nineteenth
century.
In Germany,
it began
rather unexpectedly once more among
the
nobility, whose
opposition
to
the state was again aroused by the transformation of the Prussian monarchy
into a fell-fledged nation-state after 1871. Bismarck, the actual founder of
the German Reich, had maintained close relations with Jews ever since he
became Prime Minister; now he was denounced for being dependent upon
and
accepting
bribes from
the
Jews.
His
attempt and
partial
success
in
abolishing most feudal remnants
in
the government inevitably
resulted
in
conflict with the aristocracy;
in their attack on Bismarck they represented
him as either an innocent victim or a paid agent of Bleichroeder. Actually
the
relationship was
the
very
opposite;
Bleichroeder was
undoubtedly
a
highly esteemed and well-paid agent of Bismarck.^^
Feudal
aristocracy, however, though
still powerful enough
to
influence
public opinion, was in
itself neither strong nor important enough to start a
real
antisemitic movement
like
the one
that began
in
the
eighties.
Their
spokesman, Court Chaplain Stoecker, himself a son of lower middle-class
parents, was a much less gifted representative of conservative interests than
his predecessors,
the romantic
intellectuals who had formulated
the main
tenets of a conservative ideology some fifty years earlier. Moreover, he dis-
covered the usefulness of antisemitic propaganda not through
practical or
theoretical considerations but by accident, when he, with the help of a great
demagogic talent, found out
it was highly useful for filling otherwise empty
halls. But not only did he
fail to understand his own sudden successes; as
court chaplain and employee of both the royal family and the government,
he was hardly in a position to use them properly. His enthusiastic audiences
were composed exclusively of lower middle-class people, small shopkeepers
and tradesmen,
artisans and old-fashioned craftsmen. And the
anti-Jewish
sentiments
of
these
people
were
not
yet,
and
certainly
not
exclusively,
motivated by a conflict with the
state.

ANTISEMITISM
tury was preceded by a
scries of
financial scandals and fraudulent
affairs
whose main
source was an overproduction
of ready
capital.
In France
a
majority of Parliament members and an
incredible number of government
orticials were soon so deeply involved
in swindle and bribery that the Third
Republic was never to recover the prestige
it lost during the
first decades of
its existence;
in Austria and Germany the aristocracy was among the most
compromised. In
all three countries, Jews acted only as middlemen, and not
a
single Jewish house emerged with permanent wealth from the frauds of
the Panama Affair and the Grimdungsschwindel.
However, another group of people besides noblemen, government officials,
and Jews were seriously involved in these fantastic investments whose prom-
ised profits were matched by incredible losses. This group consisted mainly
of the lower middle
classes, which now suddenly turned
antisemitic. They
had been more seriously hurt than any of the other groups: they had risked
small
savings
and had
been
permanently
ruined.
There
were
important
reasons
for
their
gullibility.
Capitalist
expansion on
the
domestic
scene
tended more and more
to liquidate small property-holders, to whom
it had
become
a question of
life or death
to increase quickly the
little they had,
since they were only too likely to lose
all. They were becoming aware
that
if they did not succeed
in climbing upward into the bourgeoisie, they might
sink down
into the proletariat. Decades of general prosperity slowed down
this development so considerably (though
it did not change
its trend)
that
their
panic
appears
rather
premature. For
the
time
being,
however,
the
anxiety of the lower middle classes corresponded exactly to Marx's predic-
tion of their rapid dissolution.
The lower middle classes, or petty bourgeoisie, were the descendants of
the guilds of artisans and tradesmen who for centuries had been protected
against the hazards of
life by a closed system which outlawed competition
and was
in the
last instance under the protection of the state. They conse-
quently blamed
their misfortune upon
the Manchester system, which had
exposed them
to the hardships of a competitive society and deprived them
of
all special protection and privileges granted by public
authorities. They
were,
there/ore,
the
first
to clamor for the "welfare
state," which they ex-
pected not only to shield them against emergencies but to keep them in the
professions and callings they had inherited from their families. Since an out-
standing characteristic
of the century
of
free
trade was
the
access of
the
Jews
to
all
professions,
it was almost a matter of course
to
think of the
Jews
as
the
representatives of the "applied system
of Manchester carried
out to the extreme,"
^'* even though nothing was farther from the truth.
This rather derivative resentment, which we find
first in certain conserva-
tive
writers who occasionally combined an
attack on
the bourgeoisie with
an
attack on Jews,
received
a great stimulus when
those who had hoped
for help from
the government or gambled on
miracles had
to accept
the

rather dubious help of bankers. To
the small shopkeeper the banker ap-
peared
to be the same kind of exploiter
as
the owner of a big
industrial
enterprise was to the worker. But while the European workers, from
their
own experience and a Marxist education in economics, knew that the capi-
talist filled the double function of exploiting them and giving them the op-
portunity to produce, the small shopkeeper had found nobody to enlighten
him about his social and economic destiny. His predicament was even worse
than
the worker's and on
the
basis
of
his
experience he considered
the
banker a parasite and usurer whom he had to make his silent partner, even
though this banker, in contrast to the manufacturer, had nothing whatsoever
to do with his business.
It
is not
difficult to comprehend that a man who
put his money solely and directly to the use of begetting more money can
be hated more bitterly than the one who gets his profit through a lengthy and
involved process of production. Since at that time nobody asked for credit
if he could possibly help
it—certainly not small tradesmen—bankers looked
like
the exploiters not of working power and productive capacity, but of
misfortune and misery.
Many of these bankers were Jews and, even more important, the general
figure of the banker bore definite Jewish
traits for historical reasons. Thus
the
leftist movement of the lower middle class and the
entire propaganda
against banking capital turned more or
less
antisemitic, a development of
little importance in industrial Germany but of great significance
in France
and, to a lesser extent, in Austria. For a while
it looked as though the Jews
had indeed for the
first time come into
direct
conflict with another
class
without interference from
the
state. Within
the framework
of
the nation-
state, in which the function of the government was more or less defined by
its ruling position above competing classes, such a clash might even have
been a possible,
if dangerous, way to normalize the Jewish position.
To
this
social-economic element, however,
another was
quickly added
which in the long run proved to be more ominous. The position of the Jews
as bankers depended not upon loans
to small people
in
distress, but
pri-
marily on the issuance of state loans. Petty loans were left to the small
fel-
lows, who in
this way prepared themselves for the more promising careers
of their wealthier and more honorable brethren. The
social resentment of
the lower middle
classes
against
the Jews turned
into
a highly explosive
poUtical element, because these bitterly hated Jews were thought to be well
on
their way
to
political power. Were they not only too well known
for
their relationship with the government
in other respects?
Social and eco-
nomic hatred, on the other hand, reinforced the political argument with that
driving violence which up to then
it had lacked completely.
Friedrich Engels once remarked that the protagonists of the antisemitic
movement of his time were noblemen, and its chorus the howling mob of the
petty bourgeoisie. This
is true not only for Germany, but also for Austria's
Christian SociaUsm and France's Anti-Dreyfusards. In
all these
cases,
the
aristocracy, in a desperate last struggle, tried to ally itself with the- conserva-
tive forces of the churches—the Catholic Church
in Austria and France,

jg
ANTISEMITISM
the Protestant Church
in Germany—under the pretext of fighting hberalism
with the weapons of Christianity. The mob was only a means to strengthen
their position, to give their voices a greater resonance. Obviously they neither
could nor wanted to organize the mob, and would dismiss
it once their aim
was
achieved.
But
they
discovered
that
antisemitic
slogans
were
highly
effective
in mobilizing large strata of the population.
The followers of Court Chaplain Stoecker did not organize the
first anti-
semitic parties in Germany. Once the appeal of antisemitic slogans had been
demonstrated,
radical
antiscmites
at
once
separated
themselves
from
Stacker's Berlin movement, went into a full-scale fight against the govern-
ment, and founded parties whose representatives in the Reichstag voted
in
all
major
domestic
issues
with
the
greatest
opposition
party,
the
Social
Democrats.'" They quickly got rid of the compromising initial aUiance with
the old powers; Boeckcl, the
first antisemitic member of Parliament, owed
his seat to votes of the Hessian peasants whom he defended against "Junkers
and Jews,"
that
is
against
the
nobility which owned
too much land and
against the Jews upon whose credit the peasants depended.
Small
as
these
first antisemitic
parties were, they
at once
distinguished
themselves from
all other parties. They made the original claim
that they
were not a party among parties but a party "above
all parties." In the class-
and party-ridden
nation-state, only the
state and the government had ever
claimed
to be above
all
parties and
classes,
to represent
the nation
as
a
whole.
Parties were admittedly groups whose deputies represented
the
in-
terests of their voters. Even though they fought for power,
it was implicitly
understood that
it was up to the government to establish a balance between
the
conflicting
interests and
their
representatives. The
antisemitic
parties'
claim to be "above all parties" announced clearly their aspiration to become
the representative of the whole nation, to get exclusive power, to take posses-
sion of the state machinery, to substitute themselves for the state. Since, on
the other hand, they continued to be organized as a party,
it was also clear
that they wanted state power as a party, so that their voters would actually
dominate the nation.
The body
politic of the nation-state came into existence when no single
group was any longer
in a position
to wield exclusive
political power,
so
that the government assumed actual poHtical rule which no longer depended
upon
social and economic
factors. The
revolutionary movements
of
the
left, which fought for a radical change of social conditions, had never directly
touched
this
supreme
political
authority. They had
challenged
only
the
power of the bourgeoisie and its influence upon the state, and were therefore
always ready to submit to government guidance in foreign affairs, where the
interests
of
an
assumedly
unified
nation
were
at
stake. The
numerous
programs of the antisemitic groups, on the other hand, were, from the begin-
ning, chiefly concerned with foreign affairs; their revolutionary impulse was

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism

directed against the government rather than a social class, and they actually
aimed to destroy the political pattern of the nation-state by means of a party
organization.
The claim of a party to be beyond all parties had other, more significant,
implications than antisemitism.
If
it had been only a question of getting rid
of the Jews, Fritsch's proposal, at one of the early antisemitic congresses,^**
not
to
create
a new
party
but
rather
to
disseminate
antisemitism
until
finally
all existing parties were hostile
to Jews, would have brought much
quicker results. As
it was, Fritsch's proposal went unheeded because
anti-
semitism was then already an instrument for the liquidation not only of the
Jews but of the body politic of the nation-state as well.
Nor was
it an accident that the claim of the antisemitic parties coincided
with the early stages of imperialism and found exact counterparts in certain
trends in Great Britain which were free of antisemitism and in the highly
antisemitic pan-movements on the Continent.*^ Only in Germany did these
new trends spring directly from antisemitism as such, and antisemitic parties
preceded and survived the formation of purely imperialist groups such
as
the AUdeutscher Verband and others,
all of which also claimed to be more
than and above party groups.
The
fact
that
similar
formations
without
active
antisemitism—which
avoided the charlatan aspect of the antisemitic parties and therefore seemed
at first to have far better chances for final victory—were finally submerged
or liquidated by the antisemitic movement is a good index to the importance
of the issue. The antisemites' belief that their claim to exclusive rule was no
more than what the Jews had in fact achieved, gave them the advantage of a
domestic program, and conditions were such that one had to enter the arena
of social struggle in order to win political power. They could pretend to fight
the Jews
exactly
as
the workers were
fighting
the bourgeoisie. Their
ad-
vantage was that by attacking the Jews, who were believed to be the secret
power behind governments, they could openly attack the state itself, whereas
the imperialist groups, with their mild and secondary antipathy against Jews,
never found the connection with the important social struggles of the times.
The second highly significant characteristic of the new antisemitic parties
was that they started at once a supranational organization of all antisemitic
groups in Europe, in open contrast to, and in defiance of, current nationalistic
slogans. By introducing
this supranational element,
they
clearly
indicated
that they aimed not only
at political rule over the nation but had already
planned a step further for an inter-European government "above
all
na-
tions." *2 This second revolutionary element meant the fundamental break

the
status quo;
it has been
frequently overlooked because
the
anti-
scmitcs themselves,
partly because of traditional habits and partly because
Ihcy consciously
lied, used
the language of the reactionary parties in their
propaganda.
The
intimate relationship between
the peculiar conditions of Jewish ex-
istence and the ideology of such groups
is even more evident in the organiza-
tion of a group beyond nations than in the creation of a party beyond parties.
The Jews very clearly were the only inter-European element in a nationalized
Europe.
It seemed only
logical
that
their enemies had
to organize on
the
same
principle,
if
they were
to
fight
those who were supposed
to be
the
secret manipulators of the
political destiny of
all nations.
While
this argument was sure
to be convincing as propaganda,
the suc-
cess of supranational antisemitism depended upon more general considera-
tions. Even
at the end of the
last century, and especially since the Franco-
Prussian War, more and more people
felt that the national organization of
Europe was antiquated because
it could no longer adequately respond
to
new economic challenges. This feeling had been a powerful supporting argu-
ment for the international organization of socialism and had,
in
turn, been
strengthened by
it. The conviction
that
identical
interests
existed
all over
Europe
was
spreading
through
the
masses.''^
Whereas
the
international
socialist organizations remained passive and uninterested in all foreign policy
issues
(that
is
in
precisely
those
questions
where
their
internationalism
might have been
tested),
the antisemites
started with problems
of foreign
policy and even promised solution of domestic problems on a supranational
basis. To take
ideologies less
at their face value and
to look more closely
at
the
actual programs
of
the
respective
parties
is
to
discover
that
the
socialists, who were more concerned with domestic issues, fitted much better
into the nation-state than the antisemites.
Of course
this does not mean that the
socialists' internationalist convic-
tions were not sincere. These were, on the contrary, stronger and, inciden-
tally, much older than the discovery of class interests which cut across the
boundaries of national states. But the very awareness of the all-importance
of
class
struggle induced them
to neglect
that heritage which
the French
Revolution had bequeathed to the workers' parties and which alone might
have led them to an articulate political theory. The socialists kept implicitly
intact the original concept of a "nation among nations," all of which belong
to the family of mankind, but they never found a device by which to trans-
Chemnitz and founded
the
Alliance Antijuive
Universelle. A good account of
these
meetings and congresses, their programs and discussions,
is to be found in Wawrzinek,

3 The
international
solidarity
of
the workers' movements
was,
as
far
as
it went,
an
intcr-European
matter.
Their
indifference
to
foreign
policy was
also
a
kind
of
self-protection
against

or
struggle
against
the

As
far
as
economic
interests
were
concerned,
it was
all
too obvious
that
everybody
in
the French
or
British
or Dutch
nation would
feel the
full impact of the
fall of their empires, and
not
just
capitalists and bankers.

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism

form
this
idea
into
a working concept
in
the world
of
sovereign
states.
Their internationalism, consequently, remained a personal conviction shared
by everybody, and
their healthy
disinterest
in national sovereignty turned
into a quite unhealthy and unrealistic indifference to foreign politics. Since
the parties of the left did not object to nation-states on principle, but only
to the aspect of national sovereignty; since, moreover, their own inarticulate
hopes for federalist structures with eventual
integration
of
all nations on
equal terms somehow presupposed national liberty and independence of all
oppressed peoples, they could operate within the framework of the nation-
state and even emerge, in the time of decay of
its social and political struc-
ture, as the only group in the population that did not indulge in expansionist
fantasies and in thoughts of destroying other peoples.
The supranationalism of the antisemites approached the question of in-
ternational organization from exactly the opposite point of view. Their aim
was a dominating superstructure which would destroy
all home-grown na-
tional structures
alike. They could indulge
in hypernationalistic
talk even
as they prepared to destroy the body
politic of their own nation, because
tribal nationalism, with
its immoderate
lust for conquest, was one of the
principal powers by which
to force open the narrow and modest limits of
the nation-state and
its
sovereignty.** The more
effective
the
chauvinistic
propaganda, the easier
it was
to persuade public opinion
of the necessity
for a supranational
structure which would
rule from above and without
national distinctions by a universal monopoly of power and the instruments
of violence.
There
is
little doubt
that
the
special
inter-European
condition
of
the
Jewish people could have
served
the purposes
of
socialist
federalism
at
least as well as
it was
to serve the
sinister plots of supranationalists. But
socialists were
so concerned with
class
struggle and
so
neglectful
of
the
political consequences
of
their own
inherited concepts
that
they became
aware of the existence of the Jews as a political factor only when they were
already confronted with full-blown antisemitism as a serious competitor on
the domestic scene. Then they were not only unprepared to integrate the
Jewish issue into
their
theories, but actually
afraid
to touch
the question
at
all. Here as in other international issues, they left the field to the supra-
nationalists who could then seem to be the only ones who knew the answers
to world problems.
By the turn of the century,
the
effects of the swindles
in the seventies
had run their course and an era of prosperity and general well-being, espe-
cially in Germany, put an end to the premature agitations of the
eighties.
Nobody could have predicted that
this end was only a temporary
respite,
that
all unsolved political questions, together with
all unappeased
political
hatreds, were to redouble in force and violence
after the
first World War.
The
antisemitic
parties

successes,

IV:
Leftist Antisemitism
WERE IT NOT for the frightful consequences of antisemitism in our own time,
wc might have given
less
attention
to
its development
in Germany. As a
political
movement,
nineteenth-century
antisemitism
can
be
studied
best
in France, where for almost a decade
it dominated the political scene. As
an
ideological
force, competing with other more respectable
ideologies for
the
acceptance
of
public
opinion,
it reached
its most
articulate form
in
Austria.
Nowhere had
the Jews rendered such
great
services
to
the
state
as
in
Austria,
whose many
nationalities were
kept
together
only by
the Dual
Monarchy of
the House of Hapsburg, and where the Jewish
state banker,
in
contrast
to
all
other European
countries,
survived
the downfall
of
the
monarchy. Just as at the beginning of this development in the early eighteenth
century, Samuel Oppenheimer's
credit had been
identical
with
the
credit
of the House of Hapsburg, so "in the end Austrian credit was that of the
Creditanstalt"—a Rothschild banking house.^^ Although the Danube mon-
archy had no homogeneous population, the most important prerequisite for
evolution
into
a
nation-state,
it could not avoid
the transformation
of an
enlightened despotism
into
a constitutional monarchy and the creation
of
modern civil services. This meant that
it had to adopt certain institutions of
the nation-state. For one thing, the modern class system grew along nation-
ality
lines, so that certain
nationalities began
to be
identified with
certain
classes
or
at
least
professions. The German became
the dominating
na-
tionality in much the same sense as the bourgeoisie became the dominating
class
in the
nation-states. The Hungarian landed
aristocracy played a role
that was even more pronounced than, but essentially similar to, that played
by the nobility in other countries. The state machinery itself tried its best to
keep the same absolute distance from society, to rule above
all nationalities,
as the nation-state with respect to its classes. The result for the Jews was sim-
ply
that the Jewish nationality could not merge with the others and could
not become a nationality itself, just as
it had not merged with other classes in
the nation-state, or become a class
itself. As the Jews
in nation-states had
differed from
all classes of society through
their special relationship to the
state, so they
diflfcred from
all other nationalities
in Austria through
their
special
relationship
to
the Hapsburg monarchy. And
just
as everywhere
else each class that came into open conflict with the state turned antisemitic,
so
in Austria each
nationality
that not only engaged
in
the
all-pervading
struggle of the nationalities but came into open conflict with the monarchy

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism
43
itself, started its fight with an attack upon the Jews. But there was a marked
difference between
these
conflicts
in
Austria, and
those
in Germany and
France. In Austria they were not only sharper, but at the outbreak of the
first World War every single nationality, and that meant every stratum of
society, was in opposition to the state, so that more than anywhere else in
Western or Central Europe
the population was imbued with
active
anti-
semitism.
Outstanding among these conflicts was the continuously rising state hos-
tility of the German nationality, which accelerated after the foundation of
the Reich and discovered
the
usefulness
of
antisemitic
slogans
after
the
financial crash of 1873. The social situation at that moment was practically
the same
as
in Germany, but the
social propaganda
to catch the middle-
class vote immediately indulged in a much more violent attack on the state,
and a much more outspoken confession of nonloyalty to the country. More-
over, the German Liberal Party, under the leadership of Schoenerer, was
from the beginning a lower middle-class party without connections or
re-
straints from the side of the nobility, and with a decidedly left-wing outlook.
It never achieved a real mass basis, but
it was remarkably successful in the
universities
during
the
eighties
where
it
organized
the
first
closely
knit
students' organization on the basis of open antisemitism. Schoenerer's anti-
semitism,
at
first almost exclusively directed against the Rothschilds, won
him the sympathies of the labor movement, which regarded him as a true
radical gone astray." His main advantage was that he could base his
anti-
semitic propaganda on demonstrable
facts:
as a member of the Austrian
Reichsrat he had fought for nationalization of the Austrian
railroads,
the
major part of which had been in the hands of the Rothschilds since 1836
due to a state license which expired in 1886. Schoenerer succeeded in gather-
ing 40,000 signatures against its renewal, and in placing the Jewish question
in the limelight of public interest. The close connection between the Roth-
schilds and
the
financial
interests
of
the monarchy became very obvious
when
the government
tried
to extend
the
license under conditions which
were
patently
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
state
as
well
as
the
public.
Schoenerer's agitation in this matter became the actual beginning of an ar-
ticulate antisemitic movement in Austria.*^ The point is that this movement,
in contrast
to the German Stoeckcr
agitation, was
initiated and led by a
man who was sincere beyond doubt, and therefore did not stop at the use
of antisemitism as a propaganda weapon, but developed quickly that Pan-
German
ideology which was
to
influence Mazism more
deeply
than any
other German brand of antisemitism.

in the long run. the Schocncrcr movement was tempo-
rarilv defeated hv
a second
antisemitic
party,
the
Christian-Socials under
the
leadership
of
I.ueizer.
While
Schoenerer
had
attacked
the
Catholic
Church and
its considerable
inlUience on Austrian
politics almost
as much
as he had the Jews,
the Christian-Socials were
a Catholic
party who
tried
from the outset to ally themselves with those reactionary conservative forces
which had proved so helpful in Germany and France. Since they made more
social concessions, they were more successful than in Germany or in France.
They,
together
with
the
Social
Democrats,
survived
the
downfall
of
the
monarchy and became
the most
influential group
in postwar Austria. But
long before the establishment of an Austrian Republic, when, in the nineties,
Lueger had won the Mayoralty of Vienna by an
antisemitic campaign,
the
Christian-Socials
already
adopted
that
typically
equivocal
attitude
toward
the Jews
in the
nation-state—hostility
to the
intelligentsia and
friendliness
toward the Jewish business class.
It was by no means an accident that, after
a bitter and bloody contest for power with the socialist workers' movement,
they took over
the
state machinery when
Austria, reduced
to
its German
nationality, was
established
as
a
nation-state. They turned out
to be
the
only
party which was prepared
for exactly
this
role
and, even under the
old monarchy, had won
popularity because of their nationalism.
Since the
Hapsburgs were
a German house and had granted
their German subjects
a certain predominance, the Christian-Socials never attacked the monarchy.
Their function was rather to win large parts of the German nationality for
the
support
of
an
essentially
unpopular
government.
Their
antisemitism
remained without consequence; the decades when Lueger ruled Vienna were
actually a kind of golden age for the Jews. No matter how far their propa-
ganda occasionally went
in order to get votes, they never could have pro-
claimed with Schoenerer and the Pan-Germanists that "they regarded
anti-
semitism
as
the
mainstay
of our
national
ideology,
as
the most
essential
expression
of genuine
popular conviction and
thus
as
the major
national
achievement of the century."
"* And although they were as much under the
influence of clerical circles as was the antisemitic movement in France, they
were of necessity much more restrained in their attacks on the Jews because
they did not attack the monarchy as the antisemites in France attacked the
Third Republic.
The successes and
failures of the two Austrian
antisemitic
parties show
the scant relevance of social
conflicts
to the long-range
issues of the time.
Compared with the mobilization of all opponents to the government as such,
the
capturing
of lower
middle-class
votes was
a temporary phenomenon.
Indeed,
the
backbone
of
Schoenerer's movement was
in
those German-
speaking provinces without any Jewish population at
all, where competition
with Jews or hatred of Jewish bankers never existed. The
survival of the
Pan-Germanist movement and
its
violent antisemitism
in these
provinces,
while
it subsided in the urban centers, was merely due to the fact that these

45
provinces were never reached to the same extent by the universal prosperity
of the pre-war period which reconciled the urban population with the gov-
ernment.
The complete lack of loyalty to their own country and
its government,
for which
the Pan-Germanists
substituted an open
loyalty
to Bismarck's
Reich, and the resulting concept of nationhood
as something independent
of
state and
territory,
led
the Schoenerer group
to
a veritable
imperialist
ideology
in which
lies
the
clue
to
its temporary weakness and
its
final
strength.
It
is also the reason why the Pan-German party in Germany
(the
Alldeutschen), which never overstepped the limits of ordinary chauvinism,
remained
so extremely
suspicious and
reluctant
to
take
the
outstretched
hands of their Austrian Germanist brothers. This Austrian movement aimed
at more than rise to power as a party, more than the possession of the state
machinery.
It wanted a revolutionary reorganization of Central Europe
in
which the Germans of Austria, together with and strengthened by the Ger-
mans
of Germany, would become
the
ruling
people,
in which
all
other
peoples of the area would be kept in the same kind of semiservitude as the
Slavonic nationahties in Austria. Because of this close affinity to imperialism
and the fundamental change
it brought
to
the concept of nationhood, we
shall have to postpone the discussion of the Austrian Pan-Germanist move-
ment. It is no longer, at least in its consequences, a mere nineteenth-century
preparatory movement;
it
belongs, more
than
any
other brand
of
anti-
semitism,
to the course of events of our own century.
The exact opposite
is true of French
antisemitism. The Dreyfus
Affair
brings into the open
all other elements of nineteenth-century antisemitism
in
its mere
ideological and
political
aspects;
it
is
the culmination
of
the
antisemitism which grew out of the special conditions of the nation-state. Yet
its violent form foreshadowed future developments, so that the main actors
of the Affair sometimes seem to be staging a huge dress rehearsal for a per-
formance that had to be put off for more than three decades.
It drew
to-
gether
all the open or subterranean,
political or
social sources which had
brought the Jewish question into a predominant position in the nineteenth
century; its premature outburst, on the other hand, kept it within the frame-
work of a typical nineteenth-century ideology which, although
it survived
all French governments and political crises, never quite fitted into twentieth-
century
poUtical
conditions. When,
after
the
1940
defeat,
French
anti-
semitism
got
its supreme chance under
the Vichy government,
it had
a
definitely
antiquated
and,
for
major
purposes,
rather
useless
character,
which German Nazi writers never forgot to point out.*''
It had no influence
on the formation of Nazism and remains more significant in
itself than as
an active historical factor in the final catastrophe.
The principal reason for these wholesome hmitations was that France's
antisemitic
parties, though
violent on
the domestic
scene, had no

national
aspirations. They belonged
after
all
to
the
oldest and most
fully
developed nation-state in Europe. None of the antisemites ever tried seriously
to organize a "party above parties" or to seize the
state as a party and for
no other purpose but party
interests. The few attempted coups d'etat which
might
be
credited
to
the
alliance
between
antisemites
and
higher army
oflicers
were
ridiculously
inadequate
and
obviously
contrived.^"
In
1898
some
nineteen
members
of
Parliament
were
elected
through
antisemitic
campaigns, but
this was a peak which was never reached again and from
which the decline was rapid.
It
is
true, on
the other hand,
that
this was
the
earliest instance of
the
success of antisemitism as a catalytic agent for all other political issues. This
can be attributed to the lack of authority of the Third Republic, which had
been voted
in with
a very
slight majority.
In
the eyes of the masses,
the
state had lost
its prestige along with the monarchy, and attacks on the state
were no longer a sacrilege. The early outburst of violence in France bears
a
striking resemblance
to
similar
agitation
in
the
Austrian and German
Republics
after
the
first World War. The Nazi
dictatorship
has been
so
frequently
connected
with
so-called
"state-worship"
that
even
historians
have become somewhat blind
to the truism
that the Nazis took advantage
of
the complete breakdown
of
state
worship,
originally prompted by
the
worship of a prince who
sits on the throne by the grace of God, and which
hardly
ever occurs
in
a
Republic.
In
France,
fifty
years
before
Central
European countries were
affected by
this universal
loss of reverence,
state
worship had suffered many defeats.
It was much easier to attack the Jews
and the government together there than in Central Europe where the Jews
were attacked in order to attack the government.
French antisemitism, moreover,
is as much older than
its European coun-
terparts as
is French emancipation of the Jews, which dates back to the end
of the eighteenth century. The representatives of the Age of Enlightenment
who prepared the French Revolution despised the Jews as a matter of course;
they saw in them the backward remnants of the Dark Ages, and they hated
them as the financial agents of the aristocracy. The only articulate friends
of the Jews in France were conservative writers who denounced anti-Jewish
attitudes
as "one of
the
favorite
theses of the eighteenth century." " For
the more liberal or radical writer
it had become almost a tradition to warn
against the Jews as barbarians who
still lived in the patriarchal form of gov-
ernment and recognized no other state." During and after the French Rev-
olution, the French clergy and French aristocrats added their voices to the
general anti-Jewish sentiment, though for other and more material reasons.
They accused
the revolutionary government of having ordered the
sale of
clerical property to pay "the Jews and merchants to whom the government

is indebted." " These old arguments, somehow kept alive through the never-
ending struggle between Church and State in France, supported the general
violence and embitterment which had been touched off by other and more
modern forces at the end of the century.
Mainly because of the strong clerical support of antisemitism, the French
socialist movement finally decided to take a stand against antisemitic propa-
ganda in the Dreyfus Affair. Until then, however, nineteenth-century French
leftist movements had been outspoken in their antipathy to the Jews, They
simply
followed
the
tradition
of
eighteenth-century
enlightenment
which
was
the source of French hberalism and radicaUsm, and they considered
anti-Jewish attitudes an integral part of anticlericalism. These sentiments on
the left were strengthened first by the fact that the Alsatian Jews continued
to
live from
lending money
to
peasants,
a
practice
which had
already
prompted
Napoleon's
decree
of
1808.
After
conditions had changed
in
Alsace,
leftist antisemitism found a new source of strength in the financial
policies of the house of Rothschild, which played a large part in the financ-
ing of the Bourbons, maintained close connections with Louis Philippe, and
flourished under Napoleon
III.
Behind
these
obvious
and
rather
superficial
incentives
to
anti-Jewish
attitudes there was a deeper cause, which was crucial to the whole
struc-
ture of the specifically French brand of radicaUsm, and which almost suc-
ceeded
in
turning
the
whole French
leftist movement
against
the
Jews.
Bankers were much stronger in the French economy than in other capitalist
countries, and France's industrial development, after a brief rise during the
reign of Napoleon III, lagged so far behind other nations that pre-capitalist
socialist
tendencies
continued
to
exert considerable
influence. The
lower
middle classes which in Germany and Austria became antisemitic only dur-
ing the seventies and eighties, when they were already so desperate that they
could be used for reactionary politics as well as for the new mob policies,
had been antisemitic in France some fifty years earlier, when, with the help
of the working class, they carried the revolution of 1848 to a brief victory.
In the forties, when Toussenel published his Les Juifs, Rois de I'Epoque,
the most
important book
in
a
veritable
flood
of pamphlets
against
the
Rothschilds,
it was
enthusiastically received by
the
entire
left-wing
press,
which at the time was the organ of the revolutionary lower middle classes.
Their
sentiments,
as
expressed by
Toussenel,
though
less
articulate
and
less sophisticated, were not very different from those
of the young Marx,
and Toussenel's attack on the Rothschilds was only a less gifted and more
elaborate
variation
of
the
letters from
Paris
which Boerne had
written
fifteen years before." These Jews,
too, mistook

central figure
in the capitalist system, an error which has exerted a certain
influence on
the municipal and lower government bureaucracy
in France
up to our own time."
However
this outburst of popular anti-Jewish
feeling, nourished by an
economic
conflict
between
Jewish
bankers
and
their
desperate
clientele,
lasted no
longer
as an important
factor
in
politics than
similar outbursts
with purely economic or social causes. The twenty years of Napoleon Ill's
rule over a French Empire were an age of prosperity and security for French
Jewry much like the two decades before the outbreak of the first World War
in Germany and Austria.
The only brand of French antisemitism which actually remained strong,
and outlasted
social antisemitism
as well
as the contemptuous
attitudes of
anticlerical
intellectuals, was tied up with a general xenophobia. Especially
after the
first World War, foreign Jews became the stereotypes for
all for-
eigners. A differentiation between native Jews and those who "invaded" the
country from the East has been made in
all Western and Central European
countries.
Polish and Russian Jews were
treated exactly the same way
in
Germany and Austria as Rumanian and German Jews were treated in France,
just
as Jews from Posen
in Germany or from Galicia
in Austria were re-
garded
with
the same
snobbish
contempt
as
Jews from
Alsace were
in
France. But only in France did this difl[erentiation assume such importance
on the domestic scene. And
this
is probably due to the fact that the Roth-
schilds, who more than anywhere else were the butt of anti-Jewish attacks,
had immigrated into France from Germany, so that up to the outbreak of
the second World War
it became natural to suspect the Jews of sympathies
with the national enemy.
Nationalistic antisemitism, harmless when compared with modem move-
ments, was never a monopoly of reactionaries and chauvinists
in France.
On
this
point,
the
writer
Jean
Giraudoux,
the
propaganda
minister
in
Daladier's war cabinet, was
in complete agreement ^^ with Retain and the
Paris
(January,
1832):
"Rothschild
kissed
the
Pope's
hand. ... At
last
the
order
has come
which God
had
planned when
he
created
the
world. A
poor
Christian
kisses the
Pope's
feet, and a
rich Jew
kisses
his hand.
If Rothschild had gotten
his
Roman loan
at 60 per cent, instead of 65, and could have sent the cardinal-chamber-
lain more
than
ten thousand
ducats, they would have allowed him
to embrace
the
Holy
Father.
.
.
. Would
it not be the
greatest luck for the world
if
all kings were
deposed and the Rothschild family placed on the throne?" Briefe aus Paris. 1830-1833.
»"* This
attitude
is
well
described
in
the
preface
by
the municipal
councilor Paul
Brousse
to Cesare Lombroso's famous work on antisemitism
(1899). The character-
istic part of the argument
is contained
in the following: "The small shopkeeper needs
credit, and we know how
badly organized
and how expensive
credit
is
these
days.
Here too the small merchant places the
responsibility on the Jewish banker. All the
way down to the worker
i.e. only those workers who have no clear notion of scien-
tific socialism—everybody thinks the
revolution
is being advanced
if the
general
ex-
propriation of
capitalists
is preceded by
the expropriation of Jewish
capitalists, who
are the most typical and whose names are the most familiar to the masses."
" For
the
surprising
continuity
in
French
antisemitic
arguments,
compare,
for
instance, Charles Fourier's picture of the Jew "Iscariote" who arrives
in France with
100,000
pounds,
establishes
himself
in
a
town
with
six
competitors
in
his
field.

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism
49
Vichy government, which
also, no matter how hard
it tried to please the
Germans, could not break through the Umitations of
this outmoded antip-
athy for Jews. The failure was
all the more conspicuous since the French
had produced an outstanding
antisemite who
realized
the
full range and
possibilities of the new weapon. That this man should be a prominent novel-
ist
is characteristic of conditions
in France, where antisemitism in general
had never fallen into the same social and intellectual disrepute as in other
European countries.
Louis Ferdinand Celine had
a simple
thesis,
ingenious and containing
exactly
the
ideological
imagination
that
the more
rational
French
anti-
semitism had lacked. He claimed that the Jews had prevented the evolution
of Europe into a political entity, had caused
all European wars since 843,
and had plotted
the ruin of both France and Germany by
inciting
their
mutual
hostihty. Cehne proposed
this
fantastic
explanation of history
in
his Ecole des Cadavres, written
at the time of the Munich pact and pub-
lished during the
first months of the war. An earlier pamphlet on the sub-
ject, Bagatelle pour un Massacre (1938), although
it did not include the
new key
to European
history, was
already remarkably modem
in
its
ap-
proach;
it avoided
all restricting differentiations between native and foreign
Jews, between good and bad ones, and did not bother with elaborate legisla-
tive proposals (a particular characteristic of French antisemitism), but went
straight to the core of the matter and demanded the massacre of
all Jews.
Celine's
first book was very favorably received by France's leading
in-
tellectuals, who were half pleased by the attack on the Jews and half con-
vinced that
it was nothing more than an
interesting new
literary
fancy."^
For exactly
the same reasons French home-grown
Fascists
did not
take
Celine
seriously,
despite the fact that the Nazis always knew he was
the
only true antisemite in France. The inherent good sense of French poUticians
and
their deep-rooted respectabiUty prevented
their accepting a charlatan
and crackpot. The result was that even the Germans, who knew better, had
to continue to use such inadequate supporters as Doriot, a follower of Mus-
solini, and Petain, an old French chauvinist with no comprehension what-
ever of modern problems, in their vain efforts to persuade the French people
that extermination of the Jews would be a cure for everything under the
sun. The way
this situation developed during the years of French
ofl&cial,
crushes
all the competing houses, amasses a great fortune, and returns
to Germany
(in Theorie des quatre mouvements, 1808, Oeuvres Completes, 88 ff.) with Giraudoux's
picture of 1939: "By an infiltration whose secret
I have

in vain to detect, hun-
dreds

all her noisy
resentment and hostility against Great Britain. France was and remained
though declining in importance—the nation par
< xcellence on the Continent,
and even her feeble imperialist attempts usually ended with the birth of new
national independence movements.
Since, moreover, her antiscmitism had
been nourished principally by the purely national French-German
conflict,
the Jewish

almost automatically
kept from
playing much
of

THE nation-state; the birth of antisemitism
51
in Germany and a half-hearted RepubUc in continual
crisis in France—all
of them
still under the shadow of the world-wide power of the British Em-
pire—managed
to
carry
on. None
of
these
governments
was
especially
popular, and
all faced growing domestic opposition; but nowhere did there
seem to exist an earnest political will for radical change
in political condi-
tions. Europe was much too busy expanding economically
for any nation
or social stratum
to take political questions
seriously. Everything could go
on because nobody cared. Or, in the penetrating words of Chesterton, "every-
thing
is prolonging
its existence by denying that
it exists." "^
The enormous growth
of
industrial and economic capacity produced
a
steady weakening of purely political factors, while at the same time economic
forces became dominant
in
the
international play
of power. Power was
thought to be synonymous with economic capacity before people discovered
that economic and industrial capacity are only its modern prerequisites. In a
sense, economic power could bring governments to heel because they had
the same
faith
in economics
as the plain businessmen who had somehow
convinced them that the state's means of violence had to be used exclusively
for protection of business interests and national property. For a very brief
time, there was some truth in Walter Rathenau's remark that 300 men, who
all know each other, held
the
destinies of the world
in
their hands. This
odd state of affairs lasted exactly until 1914 when, through the very fact of
war, the confidence of the masses in the providential character of economic
expansion fell apart.
The Jews were more deluded by the appearances of the golden age of
security than any other section of the European peoples. Antisemitism seemed
to be a thing of the past; the more the governments lost in power and prestige,
the less attention was paid to the Jews. While the state played an ever nar-
rower and
emptier
representative
role,
pohtical
representation
tended
to
become a kind of theatrical performance of varying quality until in Austria
the theater itself became the focus of national life, an institution whose pub-
lic significance was certainly greater than that of Parliament. The theatrical
quality of the political world had become so patent that the theater could
appear as the realm of reality.
The growing influence
of big business on the
state and the
state's de-
clining need for Jewish services threatened the Jewish banker with extinc-
tion and forced certain
shifts
in Jewish occupations. The
first sign of the
'decline of the Jewish banking houses was their loss of prestige and power
within the Jewish communities. They were no longer strong enough to cen-
tralize and, to a certain extent, monopolize the general Jewish wealth. More
and more Jews left state finance for independent business. Out of food and
clothing
deliveries
to armies and governments grew
the Jewish food and
grain commerce, and the garment industries in which they soon acquired a
prominent position in
all countries; pawnshops and general stores in small

country
towns were
the
predecessors
of department
stores
in
the
cities.
This docs
not mean
that
the
relationship between Jews and governments
ceased to exist, but fewer individuals were involved, so that at the end of this
period wc have almost the same picture as
at the beginning:
a few Jewish
individuals
in important financial positions with
little or no connection with
the broader strata of the Jewish middle class.
More important than
the expansion of the independent Jewish business
class was another
shift
in the occupational structure. Central and Western
European Jewries had reached a saturation point
in wealth and economic
fortune. This
might have been
the moment
for them
to show
that
they
actually wanted money for money's or for power's sake. In the former case,
they might have expanded their businesses and handed them down to their
descendants;
in
the
latter
they
might
have
entrenched
themselves
more
firmly
in
state
business and fought
the
influence
of big business and
in-
dustry on governments. But they did neither. On the contrary, the sons of
the well-to-do businessmen and, to a lesser extent, bankers, deserted
their
fathers' careers for the liberal professions or purely intellectual pursuits they
had not been able to afford a few generations before. What the nation-state
had once feared so much, the birth of a Jewish intelligentsia, now proceeded
at a fantastic pace. The crowding of Jewish sons of well-to-do parents into
the
cultural occupations was
especially marked
in Germany and Austria,
where a great proportion of cultural institutions, like newspapers, publishing,
music, and theater, became Jewish enterprises.
What had been made possible through the
traditional Jewish preference
and respect for intellectual occupations resulted in a real break with tradi-
tion and the intellectual assimilation and nationalization of important strata
of Western and Central European Jewry.
Politically,
it indicated emancipa-
tion
of Jews from
state
protection, growing consciousness
of
a common
destiny with
their fellow-citizens, and a considerable loosening of the
ties
that had made Jews an inter-European element.
Socially, the Jewish
intel-
lectuals were the
first who,
as a group, needed and wanted admittance
to
non-Jewish
society.
Social
discrimination,
a
small matter
to
their
fathers
who had not cared for social intercourse with Gentiles, became a paramount
problem for them.
Searching for a road into society,
this group was forced to accept social
behavior patterns set by individual Jews who had been admitted into society
during the nineteenth century
as exceptions
to the
rule of discrimination.
They quickly discovered the force that would open
all doors, the "radiant
Power of Fame" (Stefan Zweig), which a hundred years' idolatry of genius
had made
irresistible. What distinguished the Jewish pursuit of fame from
the general fame idolatry of the time was that Jews were not primarily
in-
terested in
it for themselves. To hve in the aura of fame was more important
than
to become famous; thus
they became outstanding
reviewers,
critics,
collectors, and organizers of what was famous. The "radiant power" was
a very real social force by which the socially homeless were able to estabhsh
a home. The Jewish
intellectuals,
in other words,
tried, and

extent
succeeded,
in becoming
the
living
tie binding famous
individuals
into a society of the renowned, an international society by
definition, for
spiritual achievement transcends national boundaries. The general weaken-
ing of political factors, for two decades having brought about a
situation
in which reality and appearance, poUtical reality and theatrical performance
could
easily parody each
other, now enabled them
to become
the
repre-
sentatives of a nebulous international society
in which national prejudices
no longer seemed valid. And paradoxically enough, this international society
seemed to be the only one that recognized the nationalization and assimila-
tion of
its Jewish members;
it was
far easier for an Austrian Jew
to be
accepted
as an Austrian
in France than
in
Austria. The
spurious world
citizenship of this generation,
this
fictitious nationality which they claimed
as soon
as
their Jewish
origin was mentioned,
in part already resembled
those
passports which
later
granted
their owner
the
right
to
sojourn
in
every country except the one that issued
it.
By their very nature, these circumstances could not but bring Jews into
prominence just when their activities, their satisfaction and happiness in the
world of appearance, proved that, as a group, they wanted in fact neither
money nor power. While serious statesmen and publicists now bothered with
the Jewish question less than at any time since the emancipation, and while
antisemitism almost entirely disappeared from the open political scene, Jews
became the symbols
of Society as such and the objects
of hatred
for
all
those whom society did not accept. Antisemitism, having lost
its ground in
the special conditions that had influenced
its development during the nine-
teenth century, could be freely elaborated by charlatans and crackpots into
that weird mixture of half-truths and wild superstitions which emerged in
Europe after 1914, the ideology of all frustrated and resentful elements.
Since the Jewish question
in
its
social aspect turned
into a catalyst of
social unrest, until finally a disintegrated society recrystallized ideologically
around a possible massacre of Jews,
it
is necessary to outhne some of the
main
traits
of
the
social
history
of emancipated Jewry
in
the
bourgeois
society of the last century.

CHAl'TER THREE
The Jews and Society
THE jews' political ignorance, which fitted them so well for their special
role and
for taking roots
in
the
state's sphere of business, and
their
prejudices against the people and in favor of authority, which blinded them
to
the
political dangers
of
antiscmitism, caused them
to be
oversensitive
toward
all forms of social discrimination.
It was
difficult to see the decisive
difference between
political argument and mere
antipathy when
the
two
developed side by side. The point, however,
is that they grew out of exactly
opposite aspects of emancipation:
political antiscmitism developed because
the Jews were a separate body,
while
social discrimination
arose because
of the growing equality of Jews with
all other groups.
Equality of condition, though
it
is certainly a basic requirement for jus-
tice,
is nevertheless among the greatest and most uncertain ventures of mod-
ern mankind. The more equal conditions are, the less explanation there is for
the
differences
that
actually
exist between people; and
thus
all
the more
unequal do
individuals and groups become. This perplexing consequence
came fully to light as soon as equality was no longer seen
in terms of an
omnipotent being
like God or an unavoidable common destiny
like death.
Whenever equality becomes a mundane fact in
itself, without any gauge by
which
it may be measured or explained, then there
is one chance in a hun-
dred that
it
will be recognized simply
as a working principle of a political
organization in which otherwise unequal people have equal rights; there are
ninety-nine chances that
it will be mistaken for an innate quality of every
individual, who
is "normal"
if he
is like everybody else and "abnormal"
if
he happens to be different. This perversion of equality from a political into
a social concept
is
all the more dangerous when a society leaves but
little
space for special groups and individuals, for then
their differences become
all the more conspicuous.
The great challenge
to the modern period, and
its peculiar danger, has
been that in
it man for the first time confronted man without the protection
of differing circumstances and conditions. And
it has been precisely this new
concept of equality that has made modem race relations so difficult, for there
we
deal
with
natural
differences which by no
possible
and
conceivable
change of conditions can become
less conspicuous.
It
is because
equality
demands that
I recognize each and every individual as my equal, that the
conflicts between
different groups, which for reasons of
their own
are
re-
luctant to grant each other
tliis basic equality, take on such
terribly cruel
forms.

THE JEWS AND SOCIETY
55
Hence
the more equal
the Jewish condition,
the more
surprising were
Jewish differences. This new awareness led to social resentment against the
Jews and at the same time to a peculiar attraction toward them; the com-
bined reactions determined the social history of Western Jewry. Discrimina-
tion, however,
as well
as
attraction, were
politically
sterile. They
neither
produced a pohtical movement against the Jews nor served in any way to
protect them against their enemies. They did succeed, though, in poisoning
the social atmosphere, in perverting all social intercourse between Jews and
Gentiles, and had a definite effect on Jewish behavior. The formation of a
Jewish type was due to both—to special discrimination and to special favor.
Social antipathy for Jews, with
its varying forms of discrimination, did
no great political harm in European countries, for genuine social and eco-
nomic
equality was
never
achieved. To
all appearances new
classes
de-
veloped as groups to which one belonged by birth. There
is no doubt that
it was only in such a framework that society could suffer the Jews to establish
themselves as a special clique.
The
situation would have been
entirely
different
if,
as
in
the
United
States, equality of condition had been taken for granted;
if every member of
society—from whatever stratum—had been firmly convinced that by ability
and luck he might become the hero of a success
story. In such a
society,
discrimination becomes the only means of distinction, a kind of universal
law according to which groups may
find themselves outside
the sphere of
civic,
political, and economic
equality. Where
discrimination
is
not
tied
up with the Jewish
issue only,
it can become a crystallization point for a
political movement that wants to solve
all the natural
difficulties and con-
flicts of a multinational country by violence, mob rule, and the sheer vul-
garity of race concepts. It is one of the most promising and dangerous para-
doxes of the American Republic that it dared to realize equality on the basis
of
the most unequal population
in
the world,
physically and
historically.
In
the United
States,
social
antisemitism may one day become
the very
dangerous nucleus for a political movement.^ In Europe, however,
it had
little influence on the rise of political antisemitism.
1 Although Jews stood out more than other groups in the homogeneous populations
of European countries,
it does not follow that they are more threatened by discrimina-
tion than other groups in America. In fact, up to now, not the Jews but the Negroes
by nature and history the most unequal among the peoples of America—have borne
the burden of social and economic discrimination.
This could change, however,
if a political movement ever grew out of
this merely
social
discrimination. Then Jews might
very
suddenly become
the
principal
objects
of hatred for the simple reason
that they, alone among
all other groups, have them-
selves,
within
their
history and
their
religion,
expressed
a
well-known
principle
of
separation. This
is not
true of
the Negroes
or Chinese, who
are
therefore
less
en-
dangered
politically, even though they may
differ more from
the
majority than the
Jews.

5(J
ANTISEMITISM
I:
Between Pariah and Parvenu
THE PRECARIOUS balance between society and state, upon which the nation-
state rested socially and
politically, brought about a peculiar law governing
Jewish admission
to
society. During the
150 years when Jews
truly
lived
amidst, and
not
just
in
the neighborhood
of, Western European
peoples,
they always had to pay with political misery for social glory and with social
insult for political success.
Assimilation, in the sense of acceptance by non-
Jewish society, was granted them only as long as they were clearly distin-
guished exceptions from
the Jewish masses even though
they
still shared
the same restricted and humiliating political conditions, or later only when,
after
an
accomplished
emancipation
and
resulting
social
isolation,
their
political
status was already challenged by antisemitic movements.
Society,
confronted
with
political, economic, and
legal equality
for Jews, made
it
quite clear that none of its classes was prepared to grant them social equaUty,
and
that only exceptions from the Jewish people would be received. Jews
who heard
the strange compliment that they were exceptions, exceptional
Jews, knew quite well that
it was this very ambiguity—that they were Jews
and yet presumably not
like Jews—which opened the doors of society
to
them.
If they desired
this kind of intercourse, they tried, therefore, "to be
and yet not to be Jews." ^
The seeming paradox had a solid basis in fact. What non-Jewish society
demanded was
that
the newcomer be
as
"educated"
as
itself,
and
that,
although he not behave
like an "ordinary Jew," he be and produce some-
thing out of the ordinary,
since,
after
all, he was a Jew. All advocates of
emancipation called for assimilation, that is, adjustment to and reception by,
society,
which
they
considered
either
a prehminary
condition
to
Jewish
emancipation or
its automatic consequence. In other words, whenever those
who actually
tried to improve Jewish conditions attempted to think of the
Jewish question from
the point of view of the Jews themselves, they im-
mediately approached
it merely in
its social aspect.
It has been one of the
most
unfortunate
facts
in
the
history
of
the Jewish people
that
only
its
enemies, and almost never
its friends, understood that the Jewish question
was a political one.
The defenders of emancipation tended to present the problem as one of
"education," a concept which
originally
applied
to Jews
as
well
as non-
Jews.^ It was taken for granted that the vanguard in both camps would con-

is expressed
in Wilhelm
v. Humboldt's "Expert Opinion" of

for the Jews, but should

sist
of
Specially
"educated,"
tolerant,
cultured
persons.
It
followed,
of
course, that the particularly tolerant, educated and cultured non-Jews could
be bothered
socially only with exceptionally educated Jews. As a matter
of course, the demand, among the educated, for the abolition of prejudice
was very quickly to become a rather one-sided
affair, until only the Jews,
finally, were urged to educate themselves.
This, however,
is only one side of the matter. Jews were exhorted to be-
come educated enough not to behave like ordinary Jews, but they were, on
the other hand, accepted only because they were
Jews, because
of
their
foreign, exotic appeal. In the eighteenth century,
this had
its source in the
new humanism
which
expressly
wanted
"new
specimens
of humanity"
(Herder), intercourse with whom would serve
as an example of possible
intimacy with
all types of mankind. To the enlightened Berlin of Mendels-
sohn's time, the Jews served as living proof that
all men are human. For
this generation, friendship with Mendelssohn or Markus Herz was an ever-
renewed demonstration of the
dignity of man. And because Jews were a
despised and oppressed people, they were for
it an even purer and more
exemplary model of mankind.
It was Herder, an outspoken friend of the
Jews, who first used the later misused and misquoted phrase, "strange people
of Asia driven
into our regions." * With
these words, he and
his
fellow-
humanists greeted the "new specimens of humanity" for whom the eighteenth
century had "searched the earth," ^ only to find them in their age-old neigh-
bors. Eager to stress the basic unity of mankind, they wanted to show the
origins of the Jewish people
as more
alien, and hence more
exotic, than
they actually were, so
that the demonstration of humanity as a universal
principle might be more effective.
For a few decades
at the turn of the eighteenth century, when French
Jewry
already
enjoyed emancipation and German Jewry had
almost no
hope or desire for it, Prussia's enUghtened intelligentsia made "Jews all over
the world turn their eyes to the Jewish community in Berlin" ^ (and not in
Paris!). Much of this was due to the success of Lessing's Nathan the Wise,
or to its misinterpretation, which held that the "new specimens of humanity,"
because they had become examples of mankind, must also be more intensely
human individuals.^ Mirabeau was strongly influenced by this idea and used
to cite Mendelssohn as his example.^ Herder hoped that educated Jews would

show a greater freedom from prejudice because "the Jew
is free of certain
pohtical judgments which
it
is very hard or impossible for us to abandon."
Protcstinc
against
the
habit
of
the
time
of granting "concessions
of new
mercantile advantages," he proposed education as the true road to emancipa-
tion of Jews from Judaism, from "the old and proud national prejudices,
.
.
.
customs that do not belong to our age and constitutions," so that Jews could
become
"purely humanized," and
of
service
to
"the development
of
the
sciences
and
the
entire
culture
of mankind."^ At about
the same
time,
Goethe wrote
in a review of a book
of poems
that
their author, a Polish
Jew. did "not achieve more than a Christian etudiant en belles lettres," and
complained
that where he had
expected something
genuinely new, some
force beyond shallow convention, he had found ordinary mediocrity.^"
One can hardly overestimate the disastrous effect of this exaggerated good
will on
the newly Westernized, educated Jews and
the impact
it had on
their social and psychological position. Not only were they faced with the
demoralizing demand that they be exceptions to their own people, recognize
"the
sharp
difference between them and
the
others," and
ask
that such
"separation ... be
also
legalized" by
the governments; ^^ they were
ex-
pected even to become exceptional specimens of humanity. And since
this,
and not Heine's conversion, constituted the true "ticket of admission" into
cultured European society, what else could these and future generations of
Jews do but try desperately not to disappoint anybody? "
In the early decades of this entry into society, when assimilation had not
yet become a tradition
to follow, but something achieved by few and ex-
ceptionally gifted individuals,
it worked very well indeed. While France was
the land of political glory for the Jews, the first to recognize them as citizens,
Prussia seemed on
the way
to becoming
the country
of
social
splendor.
Enlightened
Berlin, where Mendelssohn had established close connections
with many famous men of his time, was only a beginning. His connections
with non-Jewish
society
still had much
in common with the scholarly
ties
that had bound Jewish and Christian learned men
together
in nearly
all
periods
of European
history. The new and
surprising element was

generation. Mendelssohn was
revered
for
his
uniqueness. His

to

it impossible for him to break ultimately with the Jewish people,

his
successors
did
as
a
matter of course. He
felt he was

for
the good
will and
protection
of
the
governing
nation"
(see his "Letter to Lavater," 1770, in Gesammelte Schriften, Vol. VII, Berlin.
1930); that
is, he always knew that the extraordinary esteem for his person paralleled
an extraordinary contempt for
his people. Since he. unlike Jews of following genera-
tions, did not share this contempt, he did not consider himself an exception.
i

THE JEWS AND SOCIETY

Mendelssohn's friends used these relationships for nonpersonal, ideological,
or even political purposes. He himself explicitly disavowed
all such ulterior
motives and expressed time and again
his complete
satisfaction
with
the
conditions under which he had to
live, as though he had foreseen that his
exceptional
social
status and freedom had something
to do with
the
fact
that he
still belonged to "the lowliest inhabitants of the
(Prussian king's)
domain." ^^
This indifference to political and civil rights survived Mendelssohn's inno-
cent relationships with the learned and enlightened men of his time;
it was
carried later into the salons of those Jewish women who gathered together
the most brilliant society Berlin was ever to see. Not until after the Prussian
defeat of 1806, when
tiie introduction of Napoleonic legislation into large
regions of Germany put the question of Jewish emancipation on the agenda
of public discussion, did this indifference change into outright fear. Emanci-
pation would
liberate
the
educated
Jews,
together
with
the
"backward"
Jewish people, and their equality would wipe out that precious distinction,
upon which,
as they were very well aware,
their
social
status was based.
When the emancipation finally came to pass, most assimilated Jews escaped
into conversion to Christianity, characteristically finding
it bearable and not
dangerous to be Jews before emancipation, but not after.
Most representative of these salons,
and the genuinely mixed society they
brought together in Germany, was that of Rahel Varnhagen. Her original,
unspoiled,
and
unconventional
intelligence, combined
with
an
absorbing
interest in people and a truly passionate nature, made her the most brilliant
and the most interesting of these Jewish women. The modest but famous
soirees in Rahel's "garret" brought together "enlightened" aristocrats, mid-
dle-class intellectuals, and actors—that
is,
all those who, like the Jews, did
not belong
to
respectable
society. Thus
Rahel's
salon, by
definition and
intentionally, was
established on
the
fringe
of
society, and did not share
any of
its conventions or prejudices.
It
is amusing
to note how closely the assimilation of Jews into society
followed the precepts Goethe had proposed for the education of his
Wil-
helm Meister, a novel which was to become the great model of middle-class
education. In
this book the young burgher
is educated by noblemen and
13 The
Prussia which Lessing had
described
as
"Europe's most enslaved country"
was to Mendelssohn "a state
in which one of the wisest princes who ever ruled men
has made
the
arts and
sciences
flourish,
has made
national freedom
of thought
so
general that
its beneficent effects reach even the
lowliest inhabitants of
his domain."
Such humble contentment
is touching and
surprising
if one
realizes
that
the
"wisest
prince" had made
it very hard for the Jewish philosopher to get permission to sojourn
in Berlin and, at a time when his Miinzjuden enjoyed
all privileges, did not even grant
him
the
regular
status
of a
"protected Jew." Mendelssohn was even aware
that
he,
the
friend of
all educated Germany, would be
subject
to
the same tax
levied upon
an ox led to the market
if ever he decided to
visit his friend Lavater in Leipzig, but
no
political conclusion regarding
the improvement of such
conditions ever occurred
to him.

actors. SO that he may learn how to present and represent his individuality,
and thereby advance from the modest status of a burgher's son into a noble-
man. For the middle classes and for the Jews, that
is, for those who were
actually outside of high aristocratic society, everything depended upon "per-
sonality" and the ability to express
it. To know how to play the role of what
one actually was, seemed the most important
thing. The pecuUar fact that
in Germany the Jewish question was held to be a question of education was
closely connected with this early start and had its consequence in the educa-
tional
Philistinism of both
the Jewish and non-Jewish middle
classes, and
also
in the crowding of Jews into the liberal professions.
The charm of
the
early
Berlin
salons was
that nothing
really mattered
but
personality
and
the
uniqueness
of
character,
talent,
and
expression.
Such
uniqueness, which
alone made
possible an almost unbounded com-
munication and
unrestricted
intimacy, could be replaced neither by rank,
money, success, nor literary fame. The brief encounter of true personalities,
which joined a HohenzoUern prince, Louis Ferdinand, to the banker Abra-
ham Mendelssohn; or a
political
publicist and diplomat, Friedrich Gentz,
to Friedrich
Schlegel, a writer of the then ultramodern romantic school
these were a few of the more famous visitors at Rahel's "garret"—came to
an end in 1806 when, according to their hostess,
this unique meeting place
"foundered
like
a
ship
containing
the
highest enjoyment
of
life." Along
with
the
aristocrats,
the romantic
intellectuals became
antisemitic, and
al-
though
this by no means meant
that
either group gave up
all
its Jewish
friends, the innocence and splendor were gone.
The real turning point in the social history of German Jews came not in
the year of
the Prussian
defeat, but two years
later, when,
in
1808,
the
government passed the municipal law giving full civic, though not political,
rights to the Jews. In the peace treaty of 1807, Prussia had lost with her
eastern provinces the majority of her Jewish population; the Jews left within
her territory were "protected Jews" in any event,
that
is, they already en-
joyed civic rights in the form of individual privileges. The municipal eman-
cipation only legalized these privileges, and outlived the general emancipa-
tion decree of 1812; Prussia, having regained Posen and
its Jewish masses
after the defeat of Napoleon, practically rescinded the decree of 1812, which
now would have meant political rights even for poor Jews, but left the mu-
nicipal law intact.
Though of
little political importance so far as the actual improvement of
the
Jews'
status
is
concerned,
these
final emancipation
decrees
together
with the loss of the provinces in which the majority of Prussian Jews lived,
had tremendous
social consequences. Before
1807,
the protected Jews
of
Prussia had numbered only about 20 per cent of the total Jewish population.
By the time the emancipation decree was issued, protected Jews formed the
majority in Prussia, with only 10 per cent of "foreign Jews" left for contrast.
Now the dark poverty and backwardness
against which "exception Jews"
of wealth and education had stood out so advantageously was no longer

there. And this background, so essential as a basis of comparison for social
success and psychological self-respect, never again became what
it had been
before Napoleon. When
the Polish provinces were regained
in
1816,
the
formerly "protected Jews" (now registered as Prussian
citizens of Jewish
faith)
still numbered above 60 per cent,"
Socially speaking, this meant that the remaining Jews in Prussia had lost
the native background against which they had been measured as exceptions.
Now they themselves composed such a background, but a contracted one,
against which the individual had to strain doubly in order to stand out at all.
"Exception Jews" were once
again simply Jews, not exceptions from but
representatives of a despised people. Equally bad was the social influence of
governmental interference. Not only the classes antagonistic to the govern-
ment and therefore openly hostile to the Jews, but
all strata of society, be-
came more or less aware that Jews of their acquaintance were not so much
individual exceptions as members of a group in whose favor the state was
ready to take exceptional measures. And
this was precisely what the "ex-
ception Jews" had always feared.
Berlin
society
left
the Jewish
salons with unmatched
rapidity, and by
1808 these meeting-places had already been supplanted by the houses of the
titled bureaucracy and the upper middle
class. One can
see, from any of
the numerous correspondences of the time, that the intellectuals as well as
the aristocrats now began to direct their contempt for the Eastern European
Jews, whom they hardly knew, against the educated Jews of Berlin, whom
they knew very well. The latter would never again achieve the self-respect
that springs from a collective consciousness of being exceptional; henceforth,
each one of them had to prove that although he was a Jew, yet he was not
a Jew. No longer would
it suffice to distinguish oneself from a more or less
unknown mass of "backward brethren"; one had
to stand out—as an
in-
dividual who could be
congratulated on
being an
exception—from
"the
Jew," and thus from the people as a whole.
Social discrimination, and not political antisemitism, discovered the phan-
tom of
"the Jew." The
first author
to make
the
distinction between
the
Jewish
individual and
"the Jew
in general,
the Jew everywhere and no-
where" was an obscure pubficist who had, in
1 802, written a biting satire on
Jewish
society and
its hunger for education,
the magic wand
for general
social acceptance, Jews were depicted as a "principle" of philistine and up-
start society.^^ This rather vulgar piece of literature not only was read with
delight by quite a few prominent members of Rahel's salon, but even indi-
rectly inspired a great romantic poet, Clemens von Brentano,
to write

very witty paper
in which again the philistine was identified with the Jew.^«
With the early idyll of a mixed society something disappeared which was
never,
in any other country and at any other time,
to return. Never again
did any
siKial group accept Jews with a free mind and heart.
It would be
friendly with Jews either because
it was excited by
its own daring and "wick-
edness" or as a protest against making pariahs of fellow-citizens. But social
pariahs the Jews did become wherever they had ceased to be political and
civil outcasts.
It
is important to bear in mind that assimilation as a group phenomenon
really
existed
only among Jewish
intellectuals.
It
is no
accident
that
the
first educated Jew, Moses Mendelssohn, was also the
first who, despite his
low civic
status, was admitted
to non-Jewish
society. The court Jews and
their successors,
the
Jewish bankers and businessmen
in
the West, were
never socially acceptable, nor did they care to leave the very narrow limits
of
their
invisible
ghetto.
In
the beginning
they were proud,
like
all
un-
spoiled upstarts, of the dark background of misery and poverty from which
they had
risen;
later, when they were attacked from
all
sides, they had
a
vested interest in the poverty and even backwardness of the masses because
it became an argument, a token of their own security. Slowly, and with mis-
givings, they were forced away from the more rigorous demands of Jewish
law—they never
left
religious
traditions altogether—yet demanded
all
the
more orthodoxy from the Jewish masses.*' The dissolution of Jewish com-
munal autonomy made them
that much more
eager not only
to
protect
Jewish communities against the authorities, but also to rule over them with
the help of the state, so that the phrase denoting the "double dependence"
of poor Jews on "both the government and
their wealthy brethren" only
reflected reality.**

the Jewish communities, but they did not belong to them socially or even
geographically. They stood, in a sense, as far outside Jewish society as they
did outside
Gentile
society. Having made
brilliant
individual
careers and
been granted considerable privileges by their masters, they formed
a kind
of community
of
exceptions
with
extremely
Umited
social
opportunities.
Naturally despised by court society, lacking business connections with the
non-Jewish middle class, their social contacts were as much outside the laws
of society
as
their economic
rise had been independent
of contemporary
economic conditions. This isolation and independence frequently gave them
a feeling of power and pride,
illustrated by the following anecdote told in
the
beginning
eighteenth
century:
"A
certain
Jew
.
.
.
, when
gently
reproached by a noble and cultured physician with
(the Jewish)
pride
al-
though they had no princes among them and no part in government
.
.
.
replied with insolence: We are not princes, but we govern them." ^^
Such pride
is almost
the opposite
of class
arrogance, which developed
but slowly among
the
privileged Jews. Ruling
as
absolute princes among
their own people, they
still
felt themselves
to be primi
inter pares. They
were prouder of being a "privileged Rabbi of all Jewry" or a "Prince of the
Holy Land" than of any
titles
their masters might offer them.^"
Until the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century,
they would
all have
agreed
with
the
Dutch Jew who said: "Neque in toto orbi
alicui nationi inservimus," and
neither then nor later would they have understood fully the answer of the
"learned Christian" who replied: "But this means happiness only for a few.
The people considered as a corpo
{sic)
is hunted everywhere, has no
self-
government,
is subject to foreign
rule, has no power and no
dignity, and
wanders
all over the world, a stranger everywhere." ^^
Class arrogance came only when business connections were established
among
state bankers
of
different countries; intermarriage between leading
families soon followed, and culminated in a real international caste system,
unknown thus far in Jewish society. This was
all the more glaring to non-
Jewish observers, since
it took place when the old feudal estates and castes
were rapidly disappearing into new classes. One concluded, very wrongly,
that the Jewish people were a remnant of the Middle Ages and did not see
that this new caste was of quite recent birth.
It was completed only in the
nineteenth
century and
comprised
numerically no more
than
perhaps
a
hundred families. But since these were
in the limelight, the Jewish people
as a whole came to be regarded as a caste. -^

them were
it not for the fact that they had certain psychological
traits and
behavior patterns
in common with Jewish
intellectuals who were,
after
all,
usually
the sons of businessmen. The Jewish
notables wanted
to dominate
the Jewish people and therefore had no desire to leave
it, while
it was char-
acteristic of Jewish
intellectuals that they wanted to leave their people and
be admitted to society; they both shared the feeling that they were exceptions,
a feelini: perfectly
in harmony with the judgment of their environment. The
"exception Jews" of wealth
felt
like exceptions from
the common destiny
of the Jewish people and were recognized by the governments as exception-
ally useful; the "exception Jews" of education felt themselves exceptions from
the Jewish people and also exceptional human beings, and were recognized
as such by society.
Assimilation, whether carried to the extreme of conversion or not, never
was a real menace to the survival of the Jews.^^ Whether they were welcomed
or rejected,
it was because they were Jews, and they were well aware of
it.
The
first generations of educated Jews
still wanted
sincerely
to
lose
their
identity
as Jews, and Boerne wrote with a great deal of bitterness, "Some
reproach me with being a Jew, some praise me because of
it, some pardon
me for
it, but all think of it." -* Still brought up on eighteenth-century ideas,
they longed for a country without either Christians or Jews; they had de-
voted themselves to science and the
arts, and were greatly hurt when they
found out that governments which would give every privilege and honor to
a Jewish banker, condemned Jewish
intellectuals
to
starvation.'-^ The con-
versions which, in the early nineteenth century, had been prompted by fear
of being lumped together with the Jewish masses, now became a necessity
for daily bread. Such a premium on lack of character forced a whole genera-
tion
of Jews
into
bitter
opposition
against
state
and
society. The "new
specimens of humanity,"
if they were worth their salt, all became rebels, and
since
the most reactionary governments of the period were supported and
financed by Jewish bankers,
their
rebellion was
especially
violent
against
the
official representatives of their own people. The anti-Jewish denuncia-
tions
of Marx and Boerne cannot be properly understood except
in
the
light of this conflict between rich Jews and Jewish intellectuals.
This conflict, however, existed in full vigor only in Germany and did not
survive the antisemitic movement of the century. In Austria, there was no
Jewish
intelligentsia to speak of before the end of the nineteenth century,
23 A
remarkable, though
little-known,
fact
is
that
assimilation
as
a program
led
much more frequently
to conversion than to mixed marriage. Unfortunately
statistics
cover up
rather than
reveal
this
fact because they consider
all unions between con-
verted and nonconverted Jewish partners to be mixed marriages. We know, however,
that
there were
quite
a number of
families
in Germany who had been baptized
for
generations and
yet remained purely Jewish. That
the converted Jew only rarely
left
his family and even more rarely
left his Jewish surroundings altogether, accounts for
this. The
Jewish
family,
at
any
rate, proved
to
be
a more
conserving
force
than
Jewish
religion.

Hapsburg monarchy's protection, and became
socialist only
after the
first
World War, when the Social Democratic party came to power. The most
significant, though not the only, exception to this rule was Karl Kraus, the
last representative
of
the
tradition
of Heine, Boerne, and Marx.
Kraus's
denunciations of Jewish businessmen on one hand, and Jewish journalism
as the organized cult of fame on the other, were perhaps even more bitter
than those of his predecessors because he was so much more isolated in a
country where no Jewish revolutionary tradition existed. In France, where
the emancipation decree had survived
all changes of governments and re-
gimes,
tfie small number of Jewish intellectuals were neither the forerunners
of a new class nor especially important in intellectual
life. Culture as such,
education as a program, did not form Jewish behavior patterns as
it did in
Germany.
In no other country had there been anything like the short period of true
assimilation so decisive for the history of German Jews, when the real van-
guard of a people not only accepted Jews, but was even strangely eager to
associate with them. Nor did
this
attitude ever completely disappear from
German society. To the very end, traces of it could easily be discerned, which
showed,
of course,
that
relations with Jews never came
to be taken
for
granted. At best
it remained a program, at worst a strange and exciting ex-
perience.
Bismarck's well-known remark
about "German
stallions
to be
paired off with Jewish mares," is but the most vulgar expression of a prevalent
point of view.
It
is only natural that this social situation, though
it made rebels out of
the
first educated Jews, would in the long run produce a
specific kind of
conformism rather than an effective tradition of rebellion."" Conforming to
a society which discriminated against "ordinary" Jews and in which, at the
same time,
it was generally easier for an educated Jew to be admitted to
fashionable
circles than for a non-Jew
of
similar condition, Jews had to
differentiate themselves clearly from the "Jew in general," and just as clearly
to indicate that they were Jews; under no circumstances were they allowed
simply to disappear among their neighbors. In order to rationalize an am-
biguity which they themselves did not fully understand, they might pretend
to "be a man in the street and a Jew at home." -' This actually amounted to
a feeling of being different from other men in the street because they were
Jews, and
different from other Jews
at home because they were not like
"ordinary Jews."
26 The
"conscious
pariah"
(Bernard Lazare)
was
the
only
tradition
of
rebellion
which established
itself, although those who belonged to
it were hardly aware of
its
existence. See the author's "The Jew as Pariah. A Hidden Tradition," in Jewish Social
Studies, Vol. VI, No. 2 (1944).
27 It
is not without irony
that
this excellent formula, which may serve
as a motto
for Western European assimilation, was propounded by a Russian Jew and
first pub-
lished
in Hebrew.
It comes from Judah Leib Gordon's Hebrew poem, Hakitzah ami,
1863. See

ANTISEMITISM
The behavior patterns of assimilated Jews, determined by this continuous
concentrated
effort
to distinguish themselves, created a Jewish type that
is
recognizable everywhere. Instead of being defined by nationality or religion,
Jews' were
being transformed
into
a
social group whose members shared
certain psychological
attributes and reactions,
the sum
total of which was
supposed
to
constitute
"Jewishness."
In
other words, Judaism became
a
psychological quality and the Jewish question became an involved personal
problem for every individual Jew.
In his tragic endeavor to conform through differentiation and distinction,
the new Jewish type had
as
little
in common with the feared "Jew
in gen-
eral"
as with
that
abstraction,
the
"heir of
the prophets and eternal pro-
moter of justice on earth," which Jewish apologetics conjured up whenever
a Jewish journalist was being attacked. The Jew of the apologists was en-
dowed with
attributes that are indeed the privileges of pariahs, and which
certain Jewish rebels living on the fringe of society did possess—humanity,
kindness, freedom from
prejudice,
sensitiveness
to
injustice. The
trouble
was that these qualities had nothing to do with the prophets and that, worse
still, these Jews usually belonged neither to Jewish society nor to fashionable
circles of non-Jewish society. In the history of assimilated Jewry, they played
but an
insignificant role. The "Jew in general," on the other hand,
as de-
scribed by professional Jew-haters, showed those
qualities which
the par-
venu must
acquire
if he
wants
to
arrive—inhumanity,
greed,
insolence,
cringing servility, and determination to push ahead. The trouble in this case
was that these qualities have also nothing to do with national attributes and
that, moreover,
these Jewish
business-class
types showed
little
inclination
for non-Jewish society and played almost as small a part
in Jewish
social
history. As long as defamed peoples and classes exist, parvenu- and pariah-
qualities
will
be
produced anew by
each
generation
with
incomparable
monotony, in Jewish society and everywhere else.
For
the
formation
of
a
social
history
of
the Jews
within
nineteenth-
century European society,
it was, however, decisive that to a certain extent
every Jew in every generation had somehow at some time to decide whether
he would remain a pariah and stay out of society altogether, or become a
parvenu, or conform to society on the demoralizing condition that he not so
much hide his- origin as "betray with the secret of his origin the secret of his
people as well." ^^ The latter road was
difficult, indeed, as such secrets did
not exist and had to be made up. Since Rahel Vamhagen's unique attempt
to establish a social
life outside of official society had failed, the way of the
pariah and the parvenu were equally ways of extreme solitude, and the way
of conformism one of constant regret. The so-called complex psychology of
the average Jew, which in a few favored cases developed into a very modem
sensitiveness, was based on an ambiguous situation. Jews felt simultaneously
the pariah's regret at not having become a parvenu and the parvenu's bad
conscience
at having betrayed
his people and exchanged equal
rights
for
"This formulation was made by Karl Kraus around 1912. See Untergang der Welt
duTch schwarze Magie, 1925.

personal privileges. One thing was certain:
if one wanted to avoid
all am-
biguities of social existence, one had to resign oneself to the fact that to be
a Jew meant
to belong
either
to an
overprivileged upper
class
or
to an
underprivileged mass which, in Western and Central Europe, one could be-
long to only through an intellectual and somewhat artificial solidarity.
The
social
destinies
of average Jews were determined by
their eternal
lack of decision. And society certainly did not compel them to make up their
minds,
for
it was
precisely
this ambiguity
of
situation and character that
made the relationship with Jews attractive. The majority of assimilated Jews
thus lived in a twilight of favor and misfortune and knew with certainty only
that both success and failure were inextricably connected with the fact that
they were Jews. For them the Jewish question had lost, once and for
all,
all
political significance; but
it haunted their private Uves and influenced their
personal decisions all the more tyrannically. The adage, "a man in the street
and a Jew at home," was bitterly realized:
political problems were distorted
to the point of pure perversion when Jews tried to solve them by means of
inner experience and private emotions; private life was poisoned to the point
of inhumanity—for example in the question of mixed marriages—when the
heavy burden
of unsolved problems
of
public
significance was crammed
into that private existence which
is much better ruled by the unpredictable
laws of passion than by considered policies.
It was by no means easy not to resemble the "Jew in general" and yet re-
main a Jew;
to pretend not to be
like Jews and
still show with
sufficient
clarity
that one was
Jewish. The
average Jew,
neither a parvenu nor
a
"conscious pariah" (Bernard Lazare), could only stress an empty sense of
difference which continued to be interpreted, in all its possible psychological
aspects and variations from innate strangeness to social alienation. As long
as the world was somewhat peaceful, this attitude did not work out badly and
for generations even became a modus vivendi. Concentration on an
artifi-
cially complicated inner
life helped Jews
to respond
to
the unreasonable
demands of society, to be strange and exciting, to develop a certain imme-
diacy of self-expression and presentation which were originally the attributes
of the actor and the virtuoso, people whom society has always half denied
and half admired. Assimilated Jews, half proud and half ashamed of their
Jewishness, clearly were in this category.
The process by which bourgeois society developed out of the ruins of
its
revolutionary
traditions and memories added the black ghost of boredom
to economic saturation and general indifference to political questions. Jews
became people with whom one hoped to while away some time. The
less
one thought of them
as
equals,
the more
attractive and entertaining they
became. Bourgeois society, in its search for entertainment and
its passionate
interest in the individual, insofar as he differed from the norm that is man,
discovered the attraction of everything that could be supposed to be mys-
teriously wicked or secretly vicious. And precisely
this feverish preference
opened the doors of society to Jews; for within the framework of this society,
Jewishness,
after having been distorted into a psychological quality, could

^
ANTISEMITISM
easily be perverted into a vice. The Enlightenment's genuine tolerance and
curiosity for everything human was being replaced by a morbid lust for the
exotic, abnormal, and different as such. Several types
in society, one after
the other, represented the exotic, the anomalous, the different, but none of
them was in the least connected with political questions. Thus only the role of
Jews
in
this decaying society could assume a stature that transcended the
narrow limits of a society affair.
Before we follow the strange ways which led the "exception Jews," famous
and notorious
strangers,
into
the
salons of
the Faubourg
St. Germain
in
fin-de-sii-cle France, we must recall the only great man whom the elaborate
self-deception of the "exception Jews" ever produced.
It seems that every
commonplace idea gets one chance in at least one individual to attain what
used to be called historical greatness. The great man of the "exception Jews"
was Benjamin Disraeli.

:
The Potent Wizard "
BENJAMIN
DISRAELI, whosc
chief
interest
in
life was
the career of Lord
Beaconsfield, was
distinguished by two
things:
first,
the
gift
of
the gods
which we moderns banally call luck, and which other periods revered as a
goddess named Fortune, and second, more intimately and more wondrously
connected with Fortune than one may be able to explain, the great carefree
innocence of mind and imagination which makes
it impossible to classify the
man as a careerist, though he never thought seriously of anything except his
career. His innocence made him recognize how foolish
it would be to feel
declasse and how much more exciting it would be for himself and for others,
how much more useful for his career, to accentuate the fact that he was a
Jew "by dressing differently, combing his hair oddly, and by queer manners
of expression and verbiage." ^° He cared for admission to high and highest
society more passionately and shamelessly than any other Jewish intellectual
did; but he was the only one of them who discovered the secret of how to
preserve luck, that natural miracle of pariahdom, and who knew from the be-
ginning that one never should bow down in order to "move up from high to
higher."
He played the game of politics like an actor in a theatrical performance,
except
that he played his part so well that he was convinced by his own
make-believe. His
life and his career read like a fairy-tale, in which he ap-
peared
as
the prince—offering the blue flower of the romantics, now
the
primrose
of
imperialist England,
to
his
princess,
the Queen
of England.

THE JEWS AND SOCIETY
69
The British colonial enterprise was the fairyland upon which the sun never
sets and
its capital the mysterious Asiatic Delhi whence the prince wanted
to escape with his princess from foggy prosaic London. This may have been
foolish and childish; but when a wife writes to her husband as Lady Beacons-
field wrote
to hers: "You know you married me
for money, and
I know
that
if you had to do
it again you would do
it for love," ^^ one
is silenced
before a happiness that seemed to be against all the rules. Here was one who
started out to
sell his soul to the devil, but the devil did not want the soul
and the gods gave him
all the happiness of this earth.
Disraeli came from
an
entirely
assimilated
family;
his
father,
an
en-
lightened gentleman, baptized the son because he wanted him to have the
opportunities
of
ordinary
mortals. He had few
connections
with
Jewish
society and knew nothing of Jewish
religion or customs. Jewishness, from
the beginning, was a fact of origin which he was at liberty to embellish, un-
hindered by actual knowledge. The result was that somehow he looked
at
this fact much in the same way as a Gentile would have looked at
it. He
realized much more clearly than other Jews
that being a Jew could be
as
much an opportunity as a handicap. And since, unlike his simple and modest
father, he wanted nothing
less
than
to become
an
ordinary
mortal and
nothing more than "to distinguish himself above
all his contemporaries," ^-
he began to shape his "olive complexion and coal-black eyes" until he with
"the mighty dome of his forehead—no Christian temple, to be sure— (was)
unlike any hving creature one has met." " He knew instinctively that every-
thing depended upon the "division between him and mere mortals," upon
an accentuation of his lucky "strangeness."
All
this demonstrates
a unique understanding of
society and
its
rules.
Significantly,
it was Disraeli who said, "What
is a crime among the multi-
tude
is only a vice among the few" ^*—perhaps the most profound insight
into the very principle by which the slow and insidious decline of nineteenth-
century society into the depth of mob and underworld morality took place.
Since he knew this rule, he knew also that Jews would have no better chances
anywhere than in circles which pretended to be exclusive and to discriminate
against them; for inasmuch
as these
circles of the few,
together with
the
multitude, thought of Jewishness
as a crime,
this "crime" could be trans-
formed at any moment into an attractive "vice." Disraeli's display of exoti-
cism,
strangeness,
mysteriousness,
magic,
and power drawn from
secret
sources, was aimed correctly
at
this disposition
in society. And
it was his
virtuosity
at
the
social game which made him
choose

Conservative
Party, won him a seat in Parliament, the post of Prime Minister, and,

with which he started

and wild as such an ambition must have appeared, he at
last won the stake for which

but
not
least,
the
lasting
admiration
of
society and
the
friendship
of
a
Queen.
One of the reasons for his success was the sincerity of his play. The im-
pression he made on his more unbiased contemporaries was a curious mix-
ture of acting and "absolute sincerity and unreserve." ^^ This could only be
achieved by a genuine innocence that was partly due to an upbringing from
which
all specific Jewish influence had been excluded. ^^ But Disraeli's good
conscience was
also due to his having been born an Englishman. England
did not know Jewish masses and Jewish poverty, as she had admitted them
centuries after their expulsion in the Middle Ages; the Portuguese Jews who
settled
in England
in
the
eighteenth
century were wealthy and educated.
Not
until
the end of the nineteenth century, when the pogroms
in Russia
initiated the modern Jewish emigrations, did Jewish poverty enter London,
and along with
it the difference between the Jewish masses and their well-
to-do
brethren.
In
Disraeli's
time
the Jewish
question,
in
its
Continental
form, was
quite unknown, because only Jews welcome
to
the
state
lived
in England. In other words, the English "exception Jews" were not so aware
of
being
exceptions
as
their
Continental
brothers
were. When
Disraeli
scorned the "pernicious doctrine of modern
times,
the natural equality of
men," *' he consciously followed
in the footsteps of Burke who had "pre-
ferred the rights of an Englishman to the Rights of Man," but ignored the
actual situation in which privileges for the few had been substituted for rights
for
all. He was so ignorant of the real conditions among the Jewish people,
and so convinced of "the influence of the Jewish race upon modern com-
munities," that he frankly demanded that the Jews "receive
all that honour
and favour from
the northern and western
races, which,
in
civilized and
refined nations, should be the lot of those who charm the pubhc taste and
elevate
the public
feeling."
^** Since
political influence of Jews
in England
centered around the English branch of the Rothschilds, he
felt very proud
about
the
Rothschilds'
help
in
defeating Napoleon and
did
not
see any
reason why he should not be outspoken in his political opinions as a Jew.^"
As a baptized Jew, he was of course never an
official spokesman for any
Jewish community, but
it remains true that he was the only Jew of his kind
and his century who tried as well as he knew to represent the Jewish people
politically.
Disraeli, who never denied that "the fundamental fact about (him) was
that he was a Jew," *° had an admiration
for
all
things Jewish
that was
matched only by his ignorance of them. The mixture of pride and ignorance

in these matters, however, was
characteristic of
all the newly
assimilated
Jews. The great difference
is that Disraeli knew even a
little less of Jewish
past and present and therefore dared to speak out openly what others be-
trayed
in the half-conscious
twilight of behavior patterns
dictated by fear
and arrogance.
The political result of Disraeli's ability to gauge Jewish possibilities by the
political aspirations of a normal people was more serious; he almost auto-
matically produced
the
entire
set
of
theories about Jewish
influence and
organization that we usually find in the more vicious forms of antisemitism.
First of all, he actually thought of himself as the "chosen man of the chosen
race." *^ What better proof was there than his own career:
a Jew without
name and riches, helped only by a fev/ Jewish bankers, was carried to the
position of the first man in England; one of the less liked men of Parliament
became Prime Minister and earned genuine popularity among those who for
a long time had "regarded him as a charlatan and treated him as a pariah." ^^
Political success never satisfied him. It was more difficult and more important
to be admitted to London's society than to conquer the House of Commons,
and
it was certainly a greater triumph to be elected a member of Grillion's
dining club—"a select coterie of which
it has been customary to make rising
politicians
of both
parties,
but from which
the
socially
objectionable
are
rigorously excluded" *^—than to be Her Majesty's Minister. The delightfully
unexpected climax of all these sweet triumphs was the sincere friendship of
the Queen,
for
if the monarchy
in England had
lost most of
its
political
prerogatives in a
strictly controlled, constitutional nation-state,
it had won
and retained undisputed primacy in English society. In measuring the great-
ness of Disraeli's triumph, one should remember that Lord Robert Cecil,
one of his eminent colleagues in the Conservative Party, could
still, around
1850, justify a particularly bitter attack by stating that he was only "plainly
speaking out what every one
is saying of Disraeli in private and no one will
say in public." ^* Disraeli's greatest victory was that finally nobody said in
private what would not have flattered and pleased him
if
it had been said in
public. It was precisely this unique rise to genuine popularity which Disraeli
had achieved through a policy of seeing only the advantages, and preaching
only the privileges, of being born a Jew.
Part of Disraeli's good fortune
is the fact that he always
fitted his time,
and that consequently his numerous biographers understood him more com-
pletely than
is the case with most great men. He was a living embodiment of
ambition, that powerful passion which had developed in a century seemingly
not allowing for any distinctions and differences. Carlyle,
at any rate, who
interpreted
the
whole
world's
history
according
to
a
nineteenth-century
ideal of the hero, was

ANTISEMITISM
Disraeli's hands/* No other man among
his contemporaries corresponded
to
Carlylc's
heroes
as
well
as
Disraeli,
with
his
concept
of
greatness
as
such, emptied of
all specific achievements; no other man fulfilled so exactly
the demands
of the
late nineteenth century for genius
in the
flesh
as
this
charlatan who took his role seriously and acted the great part of the Great
Man with genuine naivete and an overwhelming display of fantastic
tricks
and entertaining artistry. Politicians fell in love with the charlatan who trans-
formed
boring
business
transactions
into dreams
with
an
oriental
flavor;
and when
society
sensed an aroma
of black magic
in
Disraeli's shrewd
dealings, the "potent wizard" had actually won the heart of his time.
Disraeli's
ambition
to
distinguish
himself from
other
mortals
and
his
longing for aristocratic society were typical of the middle classes of his time
and country. Neither
political reasons nor economic motives, but the im-
petus
of
his
social
ambition, made him
join
the Conservative
Party and
follow
a policy
that would always
"select the Whigs for hostility and the
Radicals
for
alliance." *^
In no European country
did
the middle
classes
ever achieve enough
self-respect to reconcile
their
intelligentsia with
their
social status, so that aristocracy could continue to determine the social scale
when
it had
already
lost
all
political
significance. The unhappy German
Philistine discovered his "innate personality" in his desperate struggle against
caste
arrogance, which had grown out of the
decline
of nobility and
the
necessity to protect aristocratic
titles against bourgeois money. Vague blood
theories and strict control of marriages are rather recent phenomena in the
history of European aristocracy. Disraeli knew much better than the German
Philistines what was required
to meet the demands of aristocracy. All
at-
tempts of the bourgeoisie
to
attain
social
status
failed to convince
aristo-
cratic
arrogance
because
they
reckoned
with
individuals
and
lacked
the
most
important element
of
caste
conceit,
the
pride
in
privilege
without
individual
effort and
merit, simply by virtue of birth. The "innate person-
ality" could never deny that its development demanded education and special
effort of the
individual. When Disraeli "summoned up a pride of race to
confront a pride
of caste,"
*'' he knew that the
social
status of the Jews,
whatever else might be said of
it, at least depended solely on the fact of birth
and not on achievement.
Disraeli went even
a step further. He knew that the
aristocracy, which
year after year had to see quite a number of rich middle-class men buy titles,
was haunted by very serious doubts of
its own value. He therefore defeated
them
at
their game by
using
his
rather
trite and popular imagination
to
describe fearlessly how the Englishmen "came from a parvenu and hybrid
race, whUe he himself was sprung from the purest blood in Europe," how
"the
life of a
British peer
(was)
mainly
regulated by Arabian laws and
"This happened

Syrian customs," how "a Jewess
is the queen of heaven" or that "the flower
of the Jewish race is even now sitting on the right hand of the Lord God of
Sabaoth." ** And when he finally wrote that "there
is no longer in fact an
aristocracy in England, for the superiority of the animal man
is an essential
quality of aristocracy," " he had in fact touched the weakest point of modern
aristocratic race theories, which were later to be the point of departure for
bourgeois and upstart race opinions.
Judaism, and belonging to the Jewish people, degenerated into a simple
fact of birth only among assimilated Jewry. Originally
it had meant a spe-
cific
religion,
a
specific
nationality,
the
sharing
of
specific memories and
specific hopes, and, even among the privileged Jews,
it meant at least
still
sharing
specific economic
advantages.
Secularization
and
assimilation
of
the Jewish intelligentsia had changed self-consciousness and self-interpreta-
tion in such a way that nothing was left of the old memories and hopes but
the awareness of belonging to a chosen people. Disraeli, though certainly not
the only "exception Jew" to believe in his own chosenness without believing
in Him who chooses and
rejects, was the only one who produced a
full-
blown race doctrine out of this empty concept of a historic mission. He was ^
ready to assert that the Semitic principle "represents
all that
is spiritual in
our nature," that "the vicissitudes of history find their main solution—all
is
race," which
is "the key to history" regardless of "language and religion,"
for "there is only one thing which makes a race and that is blood" and there
is only one
aristocracy, the
"aristocracy of nature" which consists of "an
unmixed race of a first-rate organization." ^°
The close relationship of
this
to more modern race ideologies need noti/
be
stressed, and
Disraeli's discovery
is one more proof of how
well theyi
serve
to combat feelings of social
inferiority. For
if race doctrines
finally^
served much more
sinister and immediately
political
purposes,
it
is
still
true that much of their plausibility and persuasiveness lay
in the fact that
they helped anybody
feel himself an
aristocrat who had been
selected by
birth on the strength of "racial" qualification. That these new selected ones
did not belong to an elite, to a selected few—which, after
all, had been in-
herent
in the pride of a nobleman—but had
to share chosenness with an
ever-growing mob, did no essential harm to the doctrine, for those who did
not belong to the chosen race grew numerically in the same proportion.
Disraeli's race doctrines, however, were as much the result of his extraor-
dinary
insight
into
the
rules
of
society
as
the outgrowth
of
the
specific

in an independent,

remained without any protection against transformation of formerly genuine
religious beliefs into superstitions. The Jewish intelligentsia was exposed also

ANTISEMITISM
to the Influences of the Jewish reformers who wanted to change a national
religion into a religious denomination. To do so, they had to transform the
two
basic elements of Jewish
piety—the
Messianic hope and
the
faith
in
Israel's chosenness, and they deleted from Jewish prayerbooks the visions of
an ultimate restoration of Zion, along with the pious anticipation of the day
at the end of days when the segregation of the Jewish people from the nations
of the earth would come
to an end. Without the Messianic hope, the idea
of chosenness meant eternal segregation; without faith in chosenness, which
charged one
specific people with
the redemption
of
the world, Messianic
hope evaporated into the dim cloud of general philanthropy and universalism
which became so characteristic of
specifically Jewish
political enthusiasm.
The most
fateful element
in Jewish
secularization was
that the concept
of chosenness was
being separated from
the
Messianic hope, whereas
in
Jewish
religion
these two elements were two aspects of God's redemptory
plan for mankind. Out of Messianic hope grew that inclination toward final
solutions of political problems which aimed at nothing less than establishing
a paradise on earth. Out of the belief in chosenness by God grew that fan-
tastic delusion, shared by unbelieving Jews and non-Jews
alike,
that Jews
are by nature more
intelligent,
better,
healthier, more
fit for survival—the
motor of history and the salt of the earth. The enthusiastic Jewish intellectual
dreaming of the paradise on earth, so certain of freedom from
all national
ties and prejudices, was
in fact farther removed from political reality than
his
fathers, who had prayed for the coming of Messiah and the return of
the people to Palestine. The assimilationists, on the other hand, who without
any enthusiastic hope had persuaded themselves that they were the
salt of
the earth, were more
effectively separated from the nations by
this unholy
conceit than their fathers had been by the fence of the Law, which, as
it was
faithfully
believed,
separated
Israel from
the
Gentiles
but would be
de-
stroyed
in
the days of the Messiah.
It was
this conceit of the "exception
Jews," who were too "enlightened" to believe
in God and, on the grounds
of their exceptional position everywhere, superstitious enough to believe in
themselves,
that actually tore down the strong bonds of pious hope which
had tied Israel to the rest of mankind.
Secularization,
therefore,
finally produced that paradox, so decisive for
the psychology of modern Jews, by which Jewish assimilation—in
its liqui-
dation
of national consciousness,
its transformation of a national
religion
into a confessional denomination, and
its meeting of the half-hearted and
ambiguous demands of state and society by equally ambiguous devices and
psychological tricks—engendered a very real Jewish chauvinism,
if by chau-
vinism we understand the perverted nationalism in which
(in the words of
Chesterton)
"the individual
is himself the thing to be worshipped; the indi-
vidual
is
his own
ideal and even
his own
idol." From now
on,
the
old
religious concept of chosenness was no longer the essence of Judaism;
it
became instead the essence of Jewishness.
This paradox has found
its most powerful and charming embodiment in
Disraeli. He was an English imperialist and a Jewish chauvinist; but
it
is

not difficult to pardon a chauvinism which was rather a play of imagination
because, after
all, "England was the Israel of his imagination"; ^^ and
it
is
not
difficult,
either, to pardon his English imperialism, which had so
little
in common with the single-minded resoluteness of expansion for expansion's
sake, since he was, after
all, "never a thorough Englishman and was proud
of the
fact." ^^ All those curious contradictions which
indicate
so
clearly
that the potent wizard never took himself quite seriously and always played
a role to win society and to find popularity, add up to a unique charm, they
introduce
into
all his utterances an element of charlatan enthusiasm and
day-dreaming which makes him
utterly
different from
his
imperialist
fol-
lowers. He was lucky enough to do his dreaming and acting in a time when
Manchester and the businessmen had not yet taken over the imperial dream
and were even
in sharp and furious opposition
to
"colonial adventures."
His
superstitious
belief
in blood and race—into which he mixed
old
ro-
mantic folk credulities about a powerful supranational connection between
gold and blood—carried no
suspicion
of
possible
massacres, whether
in
Africa, Asia, or Europe proper. He began as a not too
gifted writer and
remained
an
intellectual whom
chance made
a member
of
Parliament,
leader of his party, Prime Minister, and a friend of the Queen of England.
Disraeli's notion of the Jews' role in politics dates back to the time when
he was
still simply a writer and had not yet begun his political career. His
ideas on the subject were therefore not the result of actual experience, but
he clung to them with remarkable tenacity throughout his later
life.
In
his
first novel, Alroy
(1833), Disraeli evolved a plan for a Jewish
Empire in which Jews would rule
as a
strictly separated
class. The novel
shows the influence of current illusions about Jewish power-possibiUties as
well as the young author's ignorance of the actual power conditions of his
time. Eleven years
later,
political experience
in Parliament and
intimate
intercourse with prominent men taught Disraeli that "the aims of the Jews,
whatever they may have been before and
since, were,
in
his day,
largely
divorced from the assertion of political nationality in any form." ^^ In a new
novel, Coningsby, he abandoned the dream of a Jewish Empire and unfolded
a fantastic scheme according to which Jewish money dominates the rise and
fall of courts and empires and rules supreme in diplomacy. Never in his life
did he give up this second notion of a secret and mysterious influence of the
chosen men of the chosen race, with which he replaced his earlier dream of
an openly
constituted,
mysterious
ruler
caste.
It became
the pivot of his
political philosophy. In contrast to his much-admired Jewish bankers who
granted loans to governments and earned commissions, Disraeli looked
at
the whole affair with the outsider's incomprehension that such power-possi-
bilities could be handled day after day by people who were not ambitious for
power. What he could not understand was that a Jewish banker was even

ANTISEMITISM
less interested
in politics than his non-Jewish colleagues; to Disraeli, at any
rate,
it was a matter of course
that Jewish wealth was only
a means
for
Jewish politics. 1 he more he learned about the Jewish bankers' well-function-
ing
organization
in
business
matters and
their
international exchange
of
news and information, the more convinced he became that he was dealing
with something
like
a
secret
society
which,
without anybody knowing
it,
had the world's destinies
in
its hands.
It
is well known that the belief
in a Jewish conspiracy that was kept to-
gether by a secret society had the greatest propaganda value for antisemitic
publicity, and by far outran all traditional European superstitions about ritual
murder and well-poisoning. It is of great significance that Disraeli, for exactly
opposite purposes and
at a time when nobody thought seriously of secret
societies, came
to identical conclusions, for
it shows clearly to what extent
such fabrications were due to social motives and resentments and how much
more
plausibly
they explained events or
political and economic
activities
than the more trivial truth did. In Disraeli's eyes, as in the eyes of many less
well-known and reputable charlatans
after him, the whole game of poHtics
was played between secret societies. Not only the Jews, but every other group
whose influence was not politically organized or which was in opposition to
the whole
social and
political system, became
for him powers behind the
scenes. In 1863, he thought he witnessed "a struggle between the secret so-
cieties and the European millionaires; Rothschild hitherto has won." ** But
also "the natural equality of men and the abrogation of property are pro-
claimed by secret societies";" as late as 1870, he could
still talk seriously
of forces "beneath the surface" and believe sincerely
that "secret societies
and
their international energies,
the Church of Rome and her claims and
methods,
the eternal
conflict between science and faith" were
at work
to
determine the course of human history.^"
Disraeli's unbelievable naivete made him connect all these "secret" forces
with
the Jews. "The
first
Jesuits were Jews;
that mysterious Russian
di-
plomacy
which
so
alarms
Western
Europe

organized
and
principally
carried on by Jews; that mighty revolution which

is entirely developing under the auspices of Jews," "men of Jewish race are
found

socialist groups). The

atheists; the most
skilful accumulators

all
this

cause they wish

imagination,
the world had become
Jewish.

THE JEWS AND SOCIETY
77
In
this singular delusion, even
that most ingenious of Hitler's publicity
stunts,
the
cry
of a
secret
alliance between
the Jewish
capitalist and
the
Jewish socialist, was already anticipated. Nor can
it be denied that the whole
scheme, imaginary and fantastic
as
it was, had a logic of
its own.
If one
started, as Disraeli did, from the assumption that Jewish millionaires were
makers of Jewish politics,
if one took into account the insults Jews had suf-
fered for centuries (which were real enough, but
still stupidly exaggerated
by Jewish apologetic propaganda),
if one had seen the not infrequent
in-
stances when the son of a Jewish millionaire became a leader of the workers'
movement and knew from experience how closely knit Jewish family
ties
were as a rule, Disraeli's image of a calculated revenge upon the Christian
peoples was not so far-fetched. The truth was, of course, that the sons of
Jewish millionaires inclined toward leftist movements precisely because their
banker fathers had never come into an open
class
conflict with
workers.
They therefore completely lacked
that class consciousness
that
the son of
any ordinary bourgeois family would have had as a matter of course, while,
on
the other
side, and for exactly the same reasons,
the workers
did not
harbor those open or hidden antisemitic sentiments which every other class
showed the Jews as a matter of course. Obviously leftist movements in most
countries offered the only true possibilities for assimilation.
Disraeli's
persistent fondness
for explaining
politics
in
terms
of
secret
societies was based on experiences which later convinced many lesser Euro-
pean
intellectuals. His basic experience had been
that a place
in English
society was much more
difficult to win than a seat
in Parliament. English
society of his time gathered
in fashionable clubs which were independent
of party
distinctions. The
clubs,
although
they were extremely
important
in the formation of a political
elite, escaped pubhc control. To an outsider
they must have looked very mysterious indeed. They were secret insofar as
not everybody was admitted to them. They became mysterious only when
members of other classes asked admittance and were either refused or ad-
mitted
after a plethora of incalculable, unpredictable, apparently
irrational
difficulties. There
is no doubt
that no
political honor could
replace
the
triumphs that intimate association with the privileged could give. Disraeli's
ambitions, significantly enough, did not suffer even at the end of his life when
he experienced severe
political
defeats,
for he remained
"the most com-
manding figure of London society." ^^
In
his naive
certainty of the paramount importance
of secret
societies,
Disraeli was a forerunner of those new social strata who, born outside the

framework of society, could never understand its rules properly. They found
themselves
in a
state of
affairs where the
distinctions between society and
politics were constantly blurred and where, despite seemingly chaotic condi-
tions, the same narrow class interest always won. The outsider could not but
conclude
that
a
consciously
established
institution
with
definite
goals
achieved such remarkable results. And
it is true that this whole society game
needed only a resolute
political will
to transform
its half-conscious play of
interests and essentially purposeless machinations into a definite policy. This
is what occurred
briefly
in France during the Dreyfus
Affair, and again in
Germany during the decade preceding Hitler's
rise
to power.
Disraeli, however, was
not only
outside
of English, he was
outside
of
Jewish, society as well. He knew little of the mentality of the Jewish bankers
whom he so deeply admired, and he would have been disappointed indeed
had he realized
that these "exception Jews," despite exclusion from bour-
geois society
(they never really
tried
to be admitted), shared
its foremost
political principle that political activity centers around protection of property
and profits. Disraeli saw, and was impressed by, only a group with no out-
ward political organization, whose members were
still connected by a seem-
ing
infinity
of family and
business
connections.
His
imagination went
to
work whenever he had to deal with them and found everything "proved"
when,
for instance, the shares of the Suez Canal were offered the English
government through the information of Henry Oppenheim (who had learned
that
the Khedive
of Egypt was anxious
to
sell)
and
the
sale was
carried
through with the help of a four million sterling loan from Lionel Rothschild.
Disraeli's
racial
convictions and
theories about
secret
societies
sprang,
in the last analysis, from his desire to explain something apparently mysteri-
ous and in fact chimerical. He could not make a political reality out of the
chimerical power of "exception Jews"; but he could, and did, help transform
chimeras
into
public
fears and
to
entertain
a bored
society
with
highly
dangerous fairy-tales.
With the consistency of most race fanatics, DisraeU spoke only with con-
tempt of the "modern newfangled sentimental principle of nationaUty." ^® He
hated the political equality at the basis of the nation-state and he feared for
the survival of the Jews under
its
conditions. He fancied
that race might
give a social as well as political refuge against equalization. Since he knew
the
nobility of his time
far better than he ever came
to know the Jewish
people,
it is not surprising that he modeled the race concept after aristocratic
caste concepts.
No doubt these concepts of the socially underprivileged could have gone
far, but they would have had little significance in European politics had they
not met with
real
political necessities when,
after the scramble for Africa,
they could be adapted to political purposes. This willingness to believe on the
part of bourgeois society gave Disraeli, the only Jew of the nineteenth cen-
tury, his share of genuine popularity. In the end,
it was not his fault that the

the great catastrophe of his people.

rightly been
called
la
capitale du dixneuvieme
siecle
(Walter
Benjamin).
Full
of promise,
the nineteenth century had
started with
the
French Revolution,
for more than one hundred years witnessed
the
vain
struggle against the degeneration of the citoyen into the bourgeois, reached
its nadir
in
the Dreyfus
Affair, and was given another fourteen years
of
morbid respite. The first World War could still be won by the Jacobin appeal
of Clemenceau, France's last son of the Revolution, but the glorious century
of the nation par excellence was
at an end
'^° and
Paris was
left; without
political significance and social splendor,
to the
intellectual avant-garde of
all countries. France played a very small part in the twentieth century, which
started, immediately after Disraeli's death, with the scramble for Africa and
the competition for imperialist domination
in Europe. Her
decline,
there-
fore, caused partly by the economic expansion of other nations, and partly
by internal disintegration, could assume forms and follow laws which seemed
inherent in the nation-state.
To a certain extent, what happened in France in the eighties and nineties
happened thirty and forty years later in
all European nation-states. Despite
chronological distances, the Weimar and Austrian Republics had much in
common
historically
with
the
Third
Republic,
and
certain
political
and
social
patterns
in
the Germany and Austria
of
the
twenties and
thirties
seemed almost consciously to follow the model of France's fin-de-siecle.
Nineteenth-century antisemitism, at any rate, reached its climax in France
and was
defeated because
it remained
a
national domestic
issue without
contact with imperialist trends, which did not exist there. The main features
of this kind of antisemitism reappeared in Germany and Austria
after the
first World War, and
its social effect on the respective Jewries was almost
the same, although
less sharp,
less extreme, and more disturbed by other
influences.

The French Revolution? Its dates must surely be set at 1789-1918."
61 The
fact
that certain psychological phenomena
did not come out
as sharply
in
German and Austrian Jews, may partly be due to the strong hold of the Zionist move-
ment on Jewish
intellectuals
in these
countries. Zionism
in
the decade
after the
first
World War, and even
in the decade preceding
it, owed
its
strength
not so much

Its
influence was

80
ANTISEMITISM
The chief reason, however, for the choice of the salons of the Faubourg
Saint-Germain
as an example of the
role of Jews
in non-Jewish
society
is
that nowhere else
is there an equally grand society or a more truthful record
of
it. When Marcel Proust, himself half Jewish and in emergencies ready to
identify himself
as
a Jew,
set out
to search
for "things past," he
actually
wrote what one of his admiring critics has called an apologia pro
vita sua.
The
life of
this greatest
writer of twentieth-century France was spent ex-
clusively in society; all events appeared to him as they are reflected in society
and reconsidered by the individual, so that reflections and reconsiderations
constitute
the
specific
reality and
texture of Proust's
world.^- Throughout
the Remembrance of Things Past,
the
individual and
his reconsiderations
belong to society, even when he retires into the mute and uncommunicative
solitude
in which Proust himself
finally disappeared when he had decided
to write
his work. There his inner
life, which
insisted on transforming
all
worldly happenings
into inner experience, became
like a mirror in whose
reflection
truth
might
appear. The
contemplator
of
inner
experience
re-
sembles the onlooker in society insofar as neither has an immediate approach
to
life but perceives reality only
if
it
is reflected. Proust, bom on the fringe
of society, but
still
rightfully belonging to
it though an outsider, enlarged
this inner experience
until
it included
the whole range of aspects
as they
appeared to and were reflected by
all members of society.
There
is no better witness, indeed, of this period when society had eman-
cipated
itself
completely
from
public
concerns,
and when
politics
itself
was becoming a part of social
life. The victory of bourgeois values over the
citizen's sense of responsibility meant the decomposition of political issues
into their dazzling, fascinating reflections in society.
It must be added that
Proust himself was a true exponent of this society, for he was involved in
both
of
its most
fashionable
"vices," which
he,
"the
greatest
witness
of
dejudaized Judaism" interconnected in the "darkest comparison which ever
has been made on behalf of Western Judaism":
^^ the "vice" of Jewishness
and the "vice" of homosexuality, and which in their reflection and individual
reconsideration became very much alike indeed.^*
It was
Disraeli who had discovered
that
vice
is but the corresponding
reflection of crime in society. Human wickedness,
if accepted by society,
is
changed from an
act of
will into an inherent, psychological quality which
man cannot choose or reject but which
is imposed upon him from without,
and which rules him as compulsively
as the drug rules the
addict. In

similating crime and transforming it into vice, society denies all responsibility
and establishes a world of fatalities in which men find themselves entangled.
The moralistic judgment as a crime of every departure from the norm, which
fashionable circles used to consider narrow and philistine,
if demonstrative
of inferior psychological understanding,
at least showed greater respect for
human
dignity.
If crime
is understood
to be a kind of fataUty, natural or
economic, everybody will finally be suspected of some special predestination
to
it. "Punishment
is the right of the criminal," of which he
is deprived
if
(in the words of Proust)
"judges assume and are more inclined to pardon
murder in inverts and treason in Jews for reasons derived from
.
.
.
racial
predestination." It is an attraction to murder and treason which hides behind
such perverted tolerance,
for
in
a moment
it can switch
to a decision
to
liquidate not only all actual criminals but all who are "racially" predestined
to commit certain crimes. Such changes take place whenever the legal and
political machine
is not separated from society so that social standards can
penetrate into
it and become political and legal rules. The seeming broad-
mindedness that equates crime and vice,
if allowed to establish
its own code
of law, will invariably prove more cruel and inhuman than laws, no matter
how severe, which respect and recognize man's independent responsibiUty
for his behavior.
The Faubourg Saint-Germain, however,
as Proust depicts
it, was in the
early stages of this development. It admitted inverts because
it felt attracted
by what
it judged to be a vice. Proust describes how Monsieur de Charlus,
who had formerly been
tolerated,
"notwithstanding his
vice," for his per-
sonal charm and old name, now rose to social heights. He no longer needed
to lead a double life and hide his dubious acquaintances, but was encouraged
to bring them into the fashionable houses. Topics of conversation which he
formerly would have avoided—love, beauty, jealousy—lest somebody sus-
pect his anomaly, were now welcomed avidly
"in view of the experience,
strange, secret, refined and monstrous upon which he founded" his views.®'
Something
very
similar happened
to
the
Jews.
Individual
exceptions,
ennobled Jews, had been tolerated and even welcomed in the society of the
Second Empire, but now Jews as such were becoming increasingly popular.
In both cases, society was far from being prompted by a revision of preju-
dices. They did not doubt that homosexuals were "criminals" or that Jews
were
"traitors"; they only revised their attitude toward crime and treason.
The trouble with their new broadmindedness, of course, was not that they
were no longer horrified by inverts but that they were no longer horrified
by crime. They did not in the least doubt the conventional judgment. The
best-hidden
disease
of
the
nineteenth
century,
its
terrible boredom
and
general weariness, had burst like an abscess. The outcasts and the pariahs
upon whom society called in its predicament were, whatever else they might
have been,
at least not plagued by ennui and,
if we are
to
trust Proust's
judgment, were the only ones in fin-de-siecle society who were
still capable

of passion. Proust leads us through the labyrinth of social connections and
ambitions onlv by the thread of man's capacity for love, which
is presented
in the perverted passion of Monsieur de Charlus for Morel,
in the devastat-
ing loyaUy
of
the Jew Swann
to
his
courtesan and
in
the
author's own
desperate
jealousy
of
Albertinc,
herself
the
personification
of
vice
in
the
novel.
Proust made
it very clear
that he regarded the outsiders and new-
comers, the inhabitants of "Sodome et Ghomorre." not only as more human
but as more normal.
The ditlerence between the Faubourg Sa nt-Germain, which had suddenly
discovered the attractiveness of Jews and inverts, and the mob which cried
"Death
to the Jews" was that the salons had not yet associated themselves
openly with crime. This meant that on the one hand they did not yet want
to participate actively in the killing, and on the other,
still professed openly
an antipathy toward Jews and a horror of inverts. This
in turn resulted in
that typically equivocal situation in which the new members could not con-
fess
their
identity openly, and yet could not hide
it
either. Such were
the
conditions from which arose
the complicated game of exposure and con-
cealment, of half-confessions and lying distortions, of exaggerated humility
and exaggerated arrogance,
all of which were consequences of the fact that
only
one's
Jewishness
(or homosexuality)
had opened
the
doors
of
the
exclusive salons, while at the same time they made one's position extremely
insecure. In
this equivocal situation, Jewishness was for the individual Jew
at once a physical
stain and a mysterious personal privilege, both inherent
in a "racial predestination."
Proust describes
at great length how
society, constantly on the lookout
for the strange, the exotic, the dangerous,
finally identifies the refined with
the monstrous and gets ready to admit monstrosities—real or fancied—such
as
the
strange, unfamiliar "Russian or Japanese play performed by native
actors";
'^''' the "painted, paunchy, tightly buttoned personage

friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself."

better suited of course were those whom nobody had ever known, who,
in
the
first stage of their assimilation, were not identified with, and were not
representative
of, the Jewish community, for such identification with well-

known bodies would have
limited
severely
society's
imagination and
ex-
pectations. Those who,
like Swann, had an unaccountable
flair for society
and taste in general were admitted; but more enthusiastically embraced were
those who, like Bloch, belonged to "a family of
little repute,
[and J had to
support, as on the floor of the ocean, the incalculable pressure of what was
imposed on him not only by the Christians upon the surface but by
all the
intervening layers of Jewish castes superior to his own, each of them crushing
with
its contempt the one that was immediately beneath
it." Society's will-
ingness to receive the utterly alien and, as it thought, utterly vicious, cut short
that climb of several generations by which newcomers had "to carve
their
way through
to the open
air by raising themselves from Jewish family
to
Jewish family." "
It was no accident that this happened shortly after native
French Jewry, during the Panama scandal, had given way before the initia-
tive and unscrupulousness of some German Jewish
adventurers;
the
indi-
vidual exceptions, with or without
title, who more than ever before sought
the
society of
antisemitic and monarchist salons where they could dream
of the good old days of the Second Empire, found themselves in the same
category
as Jews whom they would never have invited
to
their houses.
If
Jewishness as exceptionalness was the reason for admitting Jews, then those
were preferred who were clearly "a solid troop, homogeneous within
itself
and utterly dissimilar to the people who watched them go past," those who
had
not
yet
"reached
the
same
stage
of
assimilation"
as
their
upstart
brethren."
Although Benjamin
Disraeli was
still one of those Jews who were ad-
mitted to society because they were exceptions, his secularized self-represen-
tation as a "chosen man of the chosen race" foreshadowed and outlined the
lines along which Jewish self-interpretation was to take place. If this, fantastic
and crude as
it was, had not been so oddly similar to what society expected
of Jews, Jews would never have been able to play their dubious role. Not,
of course, that they consciously adopted Disraeli's convictions or purposely
elaborated
the
first
timid,
perverted
self-interpretation
of
their
Prussian
predecessors of the beginning of the century; most of them were
blissfully
ignorant of all Jewish history. But wherever Jews were educated, secularized,
and
assimilated under
the ambiguous
conditions
of
society
and
state
in
Western and Central Europe, they
lost
that measure of political responsi-
bility which their origin implied and which the Jewish notables had still felt,
albeit in the form of privilege and rulership. Jewish origin, without religious
and political connotation, became everywhere a psychological quaUty, was
changed into "Jewishness," and from then on could be considered only
in
the categories of virtue or vice. If it is true that "Jewishness" could not have
been perverted into an interesting vice without a prejudice which considered
it a crime,
it
is also true that such perversion was made possible by those
Jews who considered
it an innate virtue.

ANTISEMITISM
Assimilated Jewry has been reproached with aHenation from Judaism, and
the
final catastrophe brought upon
it
is frequently thought
to have been a
suffering as senseless
as
it was
horrible, since
it had
lost
the old value of
martyrdom. This argument overlooks the fact that as far as the old ways of
faith and
life
are concerned,
"alienation" was equally apparent
in Eastern
European countries.
But
the
usual
notion of the Jews of Western Europe
as "dejudaized"
is misleading for another reason.
Proust's
picture,
in con-
trast to the
all too obviously interested utterances of official Judaism, shows
that never did the
fact of Jewish birth play such
a decisive
role
in
private
life and everyday existence as among the assimilated Jews. The Jewish
re-
former who changed a national
religion into a
religious denomination with
the understanding that
religion
is
a
private
affair, the Jewish
revolutionary
who pretended
to be
a world
citizen
in order to
rid himself of Jewish na-
tionality, the educated Jew, "a man in the street and a Jew at home"—each
one of these succeeded in converting a national quality into a private
affair.
The
result was
that
their private
lives,
their decisions and sentiments,
be-
came the very center of their "Jewishness." And the more the fact of Jewish
birth
lost
its
religious,
national, and social-economic significance,
the more
obsessive Jewishness became; Jews were obsessed by
it as one may be by a
physical defect or advantage, and addicted
to
it
as one may be
to
a
vice.
Proust's "innate
disposition"
is nothing but
this personal,
private obses-
sion, which was so greatly
justified by
a society where
success and
failure
depended upon the
fact of Jewish
birth. Proust mistook
it for
"racial pre-
destination," because he saw and depicted only
its
social aspect and
indi-
vidual
reconsiderations. And
it
is
true
that
to the
recording onlooker the
behavior of the Jewish clique showed the same obsession
as
the behavior
patterns followed by inverts. Both felt either superior or inferior, but in any
case proudly
different from
other normal
beings; both
believed
their
dif-
ference to be a natural fact acquired by birth; both were constantly justifying,
not what they
did, but what they were; and both,
finally, always wavered
between such apologetic attitudes and sudden, provocative claims that they
were an elite. As though their social position were forever frozen by nature,
neither could move from one clique into another. The need to belong existed
in other members of society too—"the question
is not as for Hamlet, to be
or not to be, but to belong or not to belong" "—but not to the same extent.
A
society
disintegrating
into
cliques
and
no
longer
tolerating
outsiders,
Jews or
inverts,
as individuals but because of the
special circumstances of
their admission, looked like the embodiment of this clannishness.
Each
society demands of
its members
a
certain amount
of
acting,
the
ability to present, represent, and act what one actually
is. When society dis-
integrates
into cliques such demands are no longer made of the
individual
but of members of cliques. Behavior then
is controlled by
silent demands
and not by individual capacities, exactly as an actor's performance must
fit
'^ Cities of the Plain. Part
II, chapter
iii.

THE JEWS AND SOCIETY

into the ensemble of all other roles in the play. The salons of the Faubourg
Saint-Germain consisted of such an ensemble of cliques, each of which pre-
sented an extreme behavior
pattern. The
role
of the
inverts was
to show
their abnormality,
of the Jews
to represent black magic
("necromancy"),
of the artists to manifest another form of supranatural and superhuman con-
tact, of the aristocrats to show that they were not like ordinary ("bourgeois")
people. Despite their clannishness,
it
is true, as Proust observed, that "save
on the days of general disaster when the majority
rally round the victim as
the Jews
rallied round Dreyfus,"
all
these newcomers shunned intercourse
with their own kind. The reason was that
all marks of distinction were de-
termined only by the ensemble of the cliques, so that Jews or inverts
felt
that they would lose their distinctive character in a society of Jews or inverts,
where Jewishness or homosexuality would be
the most
natural,
the most
uninteresting, and the most banal thing
in the world. The same, however,
held true of their hosts who also needed an ensemble of counterparts before
whom they could be different, nonaristocrats who would admire
aristocrats
as these admired the Jews or the homosexuals.
Although these cliques had no consistency in themselves and dissolved as
soon
as no members of other cliques were around,
their members used a
mysterious sign-language as though they needed something strange by which
to
recognize each
other.
Proust
reports
at
length
the importance
of such
signs, especially for newcomers. While, however, the inverts, masters at sign-
language, had
at
least
a
real
secret,
the Jews used
this language
only
to
create
the expected atmosphere
of mystery.
Their
signs
mysteriously and
ridiculously indicated something universally known:
that
in the corner of
the salon of the Princess So-and-So
sat another Jew who was not allowed
openly to admit his identity but who without this meaningless quality would
never have been able to climb into that corner.
It
is noteworthy that the new mixed society
at the end of the nineteenth
century, like the first Jewish salons in Berlin, again centered around nobility.
Aristocracy by now had
all but lost its eagerness for culture and
its curiosity
about "new specimens of humanity," but
it retained its old scorn of bourgeois
society. An urge for social distinction was its answer to political equality and
the loss of political position and privilege which had been affirmed with the
establishment of the Third Republic. After a short and
artificial
rise during
the Second Empire, French aristocracy maintained itself only by social clan-
nishness and
half-hearted
attempts
to
reserve
the
higher
positions
in
the
army for its sons. Much stronger than political ambition was an aggressive
contempt
for
middle-class
standards, which
undoubtedly was
one
of
the
strongest
motives
for
the
admission
of
individuals
and whole
groups
of
people who had belonged to socially unacceptable classes. The same motive
that had enabled Prussian aristocrats to meet socially with actors and Jews
finally led in France to the social prestige of inverts. The middle classes, on
the other hand, had not acquired social
self-respect,
although they had
in
the meantime risen to wealth and power. The absence of a political hierarchy

Sa
ANTISEMITISM
in
the
nation-state and
the
victory
of
equality rendered
"society
secretly
more
hierarchical
as
it became outwardly more democratic."
''*
Since
the
principle of hierarchy was embodied
in
the exclusive
social
circles
of the
Faubourg Saint-Germain, each society in France "reproduced the character-
istics more or less modified, more or less in caricature of the society of the
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
which
it
sometimes
pretended ...
to
hold
in
contempt, no matter what status or what political ideas
its members might
hold."
Aristocratic
society was
a
thing
of
the
past
in
appearance
only;
actually
it pervaded the whole social body (and not only of the people of
France) by imposing "the key and the grammar of fashionable social life." "
When Proust felt the need for an apologia pro vita sua and reconsidered his
own
life spent
in aristocratic circles, he gave an analysis of society as such.
The main point about the role of Jews
in
this fin-de-siecle society
is that
it was the antisemitism of the Dreyfus Affair which opened society's doors
to Jews, and
that
it was the end of the
Affair, or rather the discovery of
Dreyfus' innocence, that put an end to their social glory. ^^ In other words,
no matter what the Jews thought of themselves or of Dreyfus, they could
play the role society had assigned them only as long as this same society was
convinced that they belonged to a race of traitors. When the traitor was dis-
covered to be the rather stupid victim of an ordinary frame-up, and the inno-
cence of the Jews was established, social interest in Jews subsided as quickly
as
did
political
antisemitism.
Jews
were
again
looked upon
as
ordinary
mortals and
fell
into
the
insignificance from which the supposed crime of
one of their own had raised them temporarily.
It was essentially the same kind of social glory that the Jews of Germany
and Austria enjoyed under much more
severe circumstances immediately
after the first World War. Their supposed crime then was that they had been
guilty of the war, a crime which, no longer identified with a single act of a
single individual, could not be refuted, so that the mob's evaluation of Jew-
ishness
as a crime remained undisturbed and society could continue
to be
delighted and fascinated by
its Jews up to the very end. If there
is any psy-
chological truth
in the scapegoat theory,
it is as the effect of this social
atti-
tude toward Jews; for when antisemitic legislation forced society to oust the
Jews,
these "philosemites"
felt as though they had to purge themselves of
secret viciousness,
to cleanse themselves of a stigma which they had mys-
teriously and wickedly loved. This psychology, to be sure, hardly explains
why
these "admirers" of Jews
finally became
their murderers, and

even be doubted that they were prominent among those who ran the death
factories, ahhough the percentage of the so-called educated
classes among
the actual killers
is amazing. But
it does explain the incredible disloyalty of
precisely those strata of society which had known Jews most intimately and
had been most delighted and charmed by Jewish friends.
As far as the Jews were concerned, the transformation of the "crime" of
Judaism
into
the
fashionable
"vice"
of Jewishness was dangerous
in
the
extreme. Jews had been able to escape from Judaism into conversion; from
Jewishness there was no escape. A crime, moreover, is met with punishment;
a vice can only be exterminated. The interpretation given by society to the
fact of Jewish birth and the role played by Jews in the framework of social
life are intimately connected with the catastrophic thoroughness with which
antisemitic devices could be put to work. The Nazi brand of antisemitism
had
its roots in these social conditions as well as in political circumstances.
And though the concept of race had other and more immediately political
purposes and functions,
its application
to
the Jewish question
in
its most
sinister aspect owed much of its success to social phenomena and convictions
which virtually constituted a consent by public opinion.
The deciding forces
in
the Jews' fateful journey
to the storm center of
events were without doubt
political; but
the
reactions
of
society
to
anti-
semitism and
the psychological
reflections
of
the Jewish
question
in
the
individual had something to do with the specific cruelty, the organized and
calculated
assault upon every
single
individual
of Jewish
origin,
that was
already characteristic of the antisemitism of the Dreyfus
Affair. This pas-
sion-driven hunt of the "Jew in general," the "Jew everywhere and nowhere,"
cannot be understood
if one
considers
the
history
of
antisemitism
as
an
entity
in
itself,
as a mere
political movement.
Social
factors, unaccounted
for in political or economic history, hidden under the surface of events, never
perceived by the historian and recorded only by the more penetrating and
passionate force of poets or novelists (men whom society had driven into
the desperate solitude and loneliness of the apologia pro vita sua) changed
the
course
that mere
political
antisemitism would have
taken
if
left
to
itself, and which might have
resulted
in
anti-Jewish
legislation and even
mass expulsion but hardly in wholesale extermination.
Ever
since
the Dreyfus
Affair and
its
political
threat
to
the
rights
of
French Jewry had produced a
social situation
in which Jews enjoyed an
ambiguous glory, antisemitism appeared in Europe as an insoluble mixture
of
political motives and
social elements.
Society always reacted
first
to a
strong
antisemitic movement
with marked
preference
for
Jews,
so
that
Disraeli's remark that "there
is no race
at this present
.
.
.
that so much
delights and fascinates and elevates and ennobles Europe
as
the Jewish,"
became particularly true in times of danger. Social "philosemitism" always
ended by adding to political antisemitism
that mysterious fanaticism with-
out which antisemitism could hardly have become the best slogan for or-
ganizing the masses. All the declasses of capitaUst society were finally ready

88
ANTISEMITISM
to unite and establish mob organizations of their own; their propaganda and
their attraction rested on the assumption that a society which had shown
its
willingness
to incorporate crime
in
the form of vice
into
its very structure
would by now be ready to cleanse
itself of viciousness by openly admitting
criminals and by publicly committing crimes.

CHAPTER FOUR
The Dreyfus Affair
i:
The
Facts
of
the Case
IT HAPPENED in France
at
the end of the year
1894. Alfred Dreyfus,
a
Jewish officer of the French General
Staff, was accused and convicted
of espionage
for Germany.
The
verdict,
lifelong
deportation
to
Devil's
Island, was unanimously adopted. The
trial took place behind closed doors.
Out of an allegedly voluminous dossier of the prosecution, only the so-called
"bordereau" was shown. This was
a
letter, supposedly
in Dreyfus' hand-
writing, addressed to the German military attache, Schwartzkoppen. In July,
1895, Colonel Picquard became head
of the Information Division
of
the
General Staff. In May, 1896, he told the chief of the General Staff, Boisdeffre,
that he had convinced himself of Dreyfus' innocence and of the guilt of an-
other officer, Major Walsin-Esterhazy.
Six months
later, Picquard was
re-
moved to a dangerous post in Tunisia. At the same time, Bernard Lazare, on
behalf of Dreyfus' brothers, published the
first pamphlet of the Affair: Une
erreur judiciaire; la verite sur I'affaire Dreyfus. In June, 1897, Picquard in-
formed Scheurer-Kesten, Vice-President of the
Senate,
of
the
facts of the
trials and of Dreyfus' innocence.
In November,
1897, Clemenceau
started
his
fight for re-examination of the
case. Four weeks
later Zola joined the
ranks of the Dreyfusards.
J'Accuse was published by Clemenceau's news-
paper in January, 1898. At the same time, Picquard was arrested. Zola, tried
for calumny of the army, was convicted by both the ordinary tribunal and
the Court
of Appeal.
In August,
1898,
Esterhazy was
dishonorably
dis-
charged because of embezzlement. He at once hurried to a British journalist
and told him that he—and not Dreyfus—was the author of the "bordereau,"
which he had forged in Dreyfus' handwriting on orders from Colonel Sand-
herr, his superior and former chief of the counterespionage division. A few
days
later Colonel Henry, another member of the same department, con-
fessed forgeries of several other pieces of the secret Dreyfus dossier and com-
mitted suicide. Thereupon the Court of Appeal ordered an investigation of
the Dreyfus case.
In June, 1899, the Court of Appeal annulled the original sentence against
Dreyfus of 1894. The
revision
trial took place
in Rennes
in August. The
sentence was made ten years' imprisonment because of "alleviating circum-
stances." A week later Dreyfus was pardoned by the President of the Repub-
lic. The World Exposition opened in Paris in April, 1900. In May, when the
success of the Exposition was guaranteed, the Chamber of Deputies,
with

gg
ANTISEMITISM
overwhelming majority, voted against any
further
revision of
the Dreyfus
case. In December of the same year all trials and lawsuits comiected with the
affair were liquidated through a general amnesty.
In
1903
Dreyfus asked
for
a new
revision.
His
petition was
neglected
until
1906, when Clcmenccau had become Prime Minister. In July,
1906,
the Court of Appeal annulled the sentence of Rennes and acquitted Dreyfus
of
all charges. The Court of Appeal, however, had no authority to acquit;
it
should
have
ordered
a new
trial.
Another
revision
before
a
military
tribunal would,
in
all probability and despite the overwhelming evidence in
favor of Dreyfus, have led to a new conviction. Dreyfus, therefore, was never
acquitted in accordance with the law,^ and the Dreyfus case was never really
settled. The reinstatement of the accused was never recognized by the French
people, and the passions that were originally aroused never entirely subsided.
As
late
as
1908, nine years
after the pardon and two years
after Dreyfus
was cleared, when,
at Clemenceau's instance, the body of Emile Zola was
transferred
to
the
Pantheon,
Alfred Dreyfus was
openly
attacked
in
the
street. A Paris court acquitted his assailant and indicated that
it "dissented"
from the decision which had cleared Dreyfus.
Even stranger
is the fact that neither the
first nor the second World War
has been
able
to bury
the
affair
in oblivion. At the behest of the Action
Frangaise, the Precis de
I'Affaire Dreyfus ^ was republished in 1924 and has
since been the standard reference manual of the Anti-Dreyfusards. At the
premiere
of L'Affaire Dreyfus
(a play
written by Rehfisch and Wilhelm
Herzog under the pseudonym of Rene Kestner)
in 1931, the atmosphere of
the nineties still prevailed with quarrels in the auditorium, stink-bombs in the
stalls,
the shock troops of the Action Fran^aise standing around to
strike
terror
into
actors,
audience
and
bystanders. Nor
did
the
government
Laval's government—act in any way differently than
its predecessors some
thirty years before:
it gladly admitted
it was unable to guarantee a
single
undisturbed performance, thereby providing a new late triumph for the Anti-
Dreyfusards. The play had to be suspended. When Dreyfus died
in
1935,
the
general
press was
afraid
to touch
the
issue ^
while
the
leftist papers
still spoke
in
the old terms
of Dreyfus' innocence and
the
right wing
of
Dreyfus' guilt. Even today, though to a lesser extent, the Dreyfus Affair
is
still
a kind of shibboleth
in French
politics. When Petain was condemned
the
influential
provincial newspaper
Voix du Nord
(of
Lille)

divided as
it was
after the Dreyfus case," because the verdict of the court
could not

all the French peace of

*
While the Dreyfus Affair
in
its broader
political aspects belongs
to
the
twentieth century, the Dreyfus case, the various trials of the Jewish Captain
Alfred Dreyfus, are quite typical of the nineteenth century, when men
fol-
lowed legal proceedings so keenly because each instance afforded a
test of
the
century's
greatest achievement,
the complete
impartiaUty
of
the
law.
It
is characteristic of the period that a miscarriage of justice could arouse
such political passions and inspire such an endless succession of
trials and
retrials, not to speak of duels and fisticuffs. The doctrine of equality before
the law was
still so firmly implanted in the conscience of the civilized world
that a single miscarriage of justice could provoke public indignation from
Moscow to New York. Nor was anyone, except in France itself, so "modern"
as to associate the matter with pohtical issues.^ The wrong done to a single
Jewish officer in France was able to draw from the rest of the world a more
vehement and united reaction than
all the persecutions of German Jews a
generation
later. Even
Czarist Russia could
accuse France
of barbarism
while in Germany members of the Kaiser's entourage would openly express
an indignation matched only by the radical press of the 1930's.^
The dramatis personae of the case might have stepped out of the pages
of Balzac: on the one hand, the class-conscious generals frantically covering
up for the members of their own clique and, on the other, their antagonist,
Picquard,
with
his
calm,
clear-eyed and
slightly
ironical
honesty.
Beside
them stand the nondescript crowd of the men in Parliament, each
terrified
of what his neighbor might know; the President of the Republic, notorious
patron of the
Paris
brothels, and
the examining magistrates,
living
solely
for the sake of social contacts. Then there
is Dreyfus
himself,
actually a
parvenu, continually boasting to his colleagues of his family fortune which
he spent on women; his brothers, pathetically offering
their entire fortune,
and then reducing the offer to 150,000 francs, for the release of their kins-
man, never quite sure whether they wished to make a sacrifice or simply to
suborn the General Staff; and the lawyer Demange, really convinced of his

will be discussed below. American public opinion was such
that
in

effect of
this threat see below. For a comprehensive study

to Reichchancellor Hohenlohe that the verdict at Rennes was a "mixture of vulgarity
and cowardice,
the
surest
signs of barbarism," and
that France "has therewith
shut
herself out of the family of civilized nations," cited by Herzog, op.

September
12, 1899. In the opinion of von Buelow the Affaire was the "shibboleth" of

himself from attacks and injury to his personal interests. Lastly, there
is the
adventurer Estcrhazy, he of the ancient escutcheon, so utterly bored by this
bourgeois world as to seek
relief equally
in heroism and knavery. An erst-
while second lieutenant of the Foreign Legion, he impressed his colleagues
greatly by his superior boldness and impudence. Always in trouble, he lived
by serving as
duelist's second
to Jewish
officers and by blackmailing their
wealthy coreligionists. Indeed, he would avail himself of the good offices of
the chief rabbi himself in order to obtain the requisite introductions. Even in
his ultimate downfall he remained true to the Balzac tradition. Not treason
nor
wild dreams
of a great orgy
in which
a hundred thousand
besotted
Prussian Uhlans would run berserk through Paris ^ but a paltry embezzle-
ment of a
relative's cash sent him
to his doom. And what shall we say of
Zola, with
his impassioned moral fervor,
his somewhat empty pathos, and
his melodramatic declaration, on
the eve of his
flight
to London,
that he
had heard the voice of Dreyfus begging him to bring this sacrifice? ^
All
this belongs
typically
to the nineteenth century and by
itself would
never have survived two World Wars. The old-time enthusiasm of the mob
for Esterhazy, like
its hatred of Zola, have long since died down to embers,
but so too has
that
fiery passion against aristocracy and clergy which had
once inflamed Jaures and which had alone secured the final release of Drey-
fus. As the Cagoulard
affair was
to show,
officers of the General
Staff no
longer had to fear the wrath of the people when they hatched their plots for
a coup d'etat. Since the separation of Church and State, France, though cer-
tainly no
longer clerical-minded, had
lost a
great
deal of her
anticlerical
feeling, just as the CathoHc Church had itself lost much of its political aspira-
tion.
Petain's
attempt
to
convert
the
republic
into
a
Catholic
state was
blocked by
the
utter indifference of the people and by
the lower
clergy's
hostility to clerico-fascism.
The Dreyfus Affair in
its political implications could survive because two
of
its elements grew in importance during the twentieth century. The
first
is
hatred of the Jews; the second, suspicion of the republic itself, of ParUament,
and the state machine. The larger section of the public could still go on think-
ing the
latter,
rightly or wrongly, under the influence of the Jews and the
power of the banks. Down to our times the term Anti-Dreyfusard can
still
serve as a recognized name for all that is antirepublican, antidemocratic, and
antisemitic. A few years ago it still comprised everything, from the monarch-
ism of the Action Frangaise to the National Bolshevism of Doriot and the
social Fascism of Deat. It was not, however, to these Fascist groups, numer-
ically unimportant as they were, that the Third Republic owed
its collapse.
On the contrary, the plain,
if paradoxical, truth
is that their influence was
never so shght
as
at
the moment when
the
collapse
actually took
place.

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR
93
What made France fall was the fact that she had no more true Dreyfusards,
no one who believed that democracy and freedom, equality and justice could
any longer be defended or
realized under the
republic.® At long
last
the
republic
fell
like
overripe
fruit
into
the
lap
of
that
old
Anti-Dreyfusard
clique ^° which had always formed the kernel of her army, and
this
at a
time when she had few enemies but almost no friends. How little the Petain
clique was a product of German Fascism was shown clearly by
its slavish
adherence to the old formulas of forty years before.
While Germany shrewdly truncated her and ruined her entire economy
through the demarcation
line, France's leaders
in Vichy tinkered with the
old Barres formula of "autonomous provinces," thereby
crippling her
all
the more. They introduced anti-Jewish legislation more promptly than any
Quisling, boasting all the while that they had no need to import antisemitism
from Germany and that their law governing the Jews differed in essential
points from that of the Reich. ^^ They sought to mobilize the Catholic clergy
against the Jews, only to give proof that the priests have not only lost their
political influence but are not actually antisemites. On the contrary,
it was
the very bishops and synods which the Vichy regime wanted to turn once
more into political powers who voiced the most emphastic protest against
the persecution of the Jews.
Not the Dreyfus case with
its
trials but the Dreyfus Affair in
its entirety
offers a foregleam of
the
twentieth
century. As Bernanos pointed out
in
J932
ij "Xhe Dreyfus
affair aheady belongs
to
that
tragic era which cer-
tainly was not ended by the last war. The
affair reveals the same inhuman
character, preserving amid the welter of unbridled passions and the flames
of hate an inconceivably cold and callous heart." Certainly
it was not
in
France that the true sequel to the affair was to be found, but the reason why
France fell an easy prey to Nazi aggression is not far to seek. Hitler's propa-
» That even Clemenceau no longer believed in
it toward the end of his
life
is shown
clearly by the remark quoted
in Rene Benjamin, Clemenceau dans
la
retraite,
Paris,
1930, p. 249: "Hope? Impossible! How can
I go on hoping when
I no longer believe
in that which roused me, namely, democracy?"
10 Weygand, a known adherent of the Action Frangaise, was
in his youth an Anti-
Dreyfusard. He was one of the subscribers
to the "Henry Memorial" established by
the Libre Parole
in honor of the unfortunate Colonel Henry, who paid with
suicide
for his forgeries while on the General Staff. The
list of subscribers was later published
by Quillard, one of the editors of L'Aurore (Clemenceau's paper), under the
title of
Le Monument Henry,
Paris,
1899. As for Petain, he was on the general
staff of the
military government of Paris from 1895 to 1899, at a time when nobody but a proven
anti-Dreyfusard would have been tolerated. See Contamine de Latour, "Le Marechal
Petain,"
in Revue de Paris,
I, 57-69. D. W. Brogan, op.

pertinently ob-
serves that of the
five World War
I marshals, four (Foch,
Petain, Lyautey, and Fa-
yolle) were bad republicans, while the
fifth, Joffre, had well-known
clerical
leanings.
11 The myth that Petain's anti-Jewish legislation was forced upon him by the Reich,
which took
in almost the whole of French Jewry, has been exploded on the French
side
itself. See

ANTISEMITISM
ganda spoke a language long familiar and never quite
forgotten. That the
"Caesarism"
'*
of
the
Action
Franqaise
and
the
nihilistic
nationalism
of
Barres and Maurras never succeeded in their original form is due to a variety
of causes,
all of them negative. They lacked social vision and were unable
to translate into popular terms those mental phantasmagoria which their con-
tempt for the
intellect had engendered.
We are here concerned essentially with the political bearings of the Drey-
fus Affair and not with the legal aspects of the case. Sharply outlined in
it
arc
a number of
traits
characteristic
of
the
twentieth
century.
Faint and
barely distinguishable during the early decades of the century, they have at
last emerged into
full daylight and stand revealed as belonging to the main
trends of modern
times. After thirty years of a mild, purely social form of
anti-Jewish discrimination,
it had become a
little
difficult to remember that
the cry, "Death to the Jews," had echoed through the length and breadth of
a modern state once before when
its domestic policy was crystallized in the
issue of antisemitism. For thirty years the old legends of world conspiracy
had been no more than the conventional stand-by of the tabloid press and the
dime novel and the world did not easily remember that not long ago, but
at a time when the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" were
still unknown, a
whole
nation
had
been
racking
its
brains
trying
to
determine
whether
"secret Rome" or "secret Judah" held the reins of world politics.^*
Similarly, the vehement and nihihstic philosophy of spiritual self-hatred ^^
suffered something of an
eclipse when
a world
at temporary peace with
itself yielded no crop of outstanding criminals
to
justify the exaltation of
brutality and unscrupulousness. The Jules Guerins had to wait nearly forty
years before the atmosphere was ripe again for quasi-military storm troops.
The declasses, produced through nineteenth-century economy, had to grow
numerically
until
they were
strong minorities
of
the
nations,
before
that
coup
d'etat, which had remained but a grotesque plot ^^
in France, could
achieve
reality
in Germany almost without
effort. The prelude
to Nazism
was played over the entire European stage. The Dreyfus case, therefore,
is

distinctly modern note
is struck
in Zola's Letter to France of
1898: "We hear
on
all sides that the concept of liberty has gone bankrupt. When the Dreyfus business
cropped

this prevalent hatred of
liberty found a golden opportunity.

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR

more than a bizarre, imperfectly solved "crime," ^^ an affair of staff officers
disguised by
false beards and dark
glasses, peddling
their stupid forgeries
by night in the streets of Paris. Its hero
is not Dreyfus but Clemenceau and
it begins not with the arrest of a Jewish
staff officer but with the Panama
scandal.
II:
The Third Republic and French Jewry
BETWEEN 1880 and 1888
the Panama Company, under the leadership of
de Lesseps, who had constructed
the Suez Canal, was
able
to make but
little practical progress. Nevertheless, within France
itself
it succeeded dur-
ing this period in raising no less than 1,335,538,454 francs in private loans.^^
This success
is the more significant when one considers the carefulness of
the French middle
class
in money
matters. The
secret
of
the company's
success
lies
in the fact that
its several public loans were invariably backed
by Parliament. The building of the Canal was generally regarded as a public
and national service rather than as a private enterprise. When the company
went bankrupt, therefore,
it was the foreign policy of the republic that really
suffered the blow. Only after a few years did
it become clear that even more
important was the ruination of some half-million middle-class Frenchmen.
Both the press and the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry came to roughly
the same conclusion:
the company had already been bankrupt for several
years. De Lesseps, they contended, had been Uving in hopes of a miracle,
cherishing the dream that new funds would be somehow forthcoming to push
on with the work. In order to win sanction for the new loans he had been
obliged to bribe the press, haff of Parliament, and
all of the higher officials.
This, however, had called for the employment of middlemen and these
in
turn had commanded exorbitant commissions. Thus, the very thing which
had originally inspired public confidence
in the enterprise, namely.
Parlia-
ment's backing of the loans, proved in the end the factor which converted a
not too sound private business into a colossal racket.
There were no Jews either among the bribed members of Parliament or
on the board of the company. Jacques Reinach and Cornelius Herz, however,
vied for the honor of distributing the baksheesh among the members of the
Chamber, the former working on the right wing of the bourgeois parties and
the latter on the radicals (the anticlerical parties of the petty bourgeoisie).^^
Reinach was the secret
financial counsellor of the government during
the
1' Whether Colonel Henry forged the bordereau on orders from the chief of staff or
upon

Similarly,
the
attempted
assassination
of
Labori, counsel
for Dreyfus
at the Rennes
tribunal, has never been properly cleared
up. Cf. Emile Zola, Correspondance: lettres a Maitre Labori,

eighties -" and
therefore handled
its
relations with
the Panama Company,
while Herz's role was a double one. On the one hand he served Reinach as
liaison with the radical wings of Parliament, to which Reinach himself had
no access; on
the other
this
office gave him such a good insight into
the
extent of the corruption that he was able constantly to blackmail his boss and
to involve him ever deeper in the mess.^^
Naturally there were quite a number of smaller Jewish businessmen work-
ing for both Herz and Reinach. Their names, however, may well repose in
the oblivion into which they have deservedly fallen. The more uncertain the
situation of the company, the higher, naturally, was the rate of commission,
until in the end the company itself received but little of the moneys advanced
to
it. Shortly before the crash Herz received for a single intra-parliamentary
transaction an advance of no less than 600,000 francs. The advance, how-
ever, was premature. The loan was not taken up and the shareholders were
simply 600,000 francs out of pocket.-- The whole ugly racket ended
dis-
astrously for Reinach. Harassed by the blackmail of Herz he
finally com-
mitted
suicide.-^
Shortly before his death, however, he had taken a step the consequences
of which for French Jewry can scarcely be exaggerated. He had given the
Libre
Parole, Edouard Drumont's
antisemitic
daily,
his
list
of suborned
members
of Parliament,
the
so-called
"remittance men," imposing
as
the
sole condition that the paper should cover up for him personally when
it
published
its exposure. The Libre Parole was transformed overnight from
a small and
politically
insignificant sheet
into one of the most
influential
papers
in
the
country,
with 300,000
circulation. The golden
opportunity
proffered by Reinach was handled with consummate care and
skill. The
list
of culprits was published in small installments so that hundreds of politicians
had to live on tenterhooks morning after morning. Drumont's journal, and
with
it
the
entire
antisemitic
press and movement, emerged
at
last
as
a
dangerous force
in the Third Republic.
The Panama scandal, which, in Drumont's phrase, rendered the invisible
visible, brought with
it two revelations. First,
it disclosed that the members
of
Parliament
and
civil
servants
had become
businessmen.
Secondly,
it
showed
that
the
intermediaries between
private
enterprise
(in
this
case,
the company) and the machinery of the state were almost exclusively Jews.^*
20 Such, for instance, was the testimony of the former minister, Rouvier, before the
Commission of Inquiry.
21 Barres (quoted by Bemanos, op.
cit., p. 271)
puts the matter tersely: "Whenever
Reinach had swallowed something,
it was Cornelius Herz who knew how
to make
him disgorge
it."
"Cf. Frank, op.
cit.,
in the chapter headed "Panama";
cf. Suarez, op.
cit.,
p.
155.
23 The
quarrel between Reinach and Herz
lends
to the Panama scandal an
air of
gangsterism unusual
in
the nineteenth
century.
In
his
resistance
to
Herz's blackmail
Reinach went so far as to recruit the aid of former police inspectors in placing a price
of ten thousand francs on the head of his
rival; cf. Suarez, op.
cit., p.
157.

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR
97
What was most surprising was that
all these Jews who worked
in such an
intimate relationship with the
state machinery were newcomers. Up
to the
establishment of
the Third Republic,
the handling of
the
finances
of
the
state had been pretty well monopolized by the Rothschilds. An attempt by
their rivals, Pereires Brothers, to wrest part of
it from their hands by estab-
lishing the Credit Mobilier had ended in a compromise. And
in 1882, the
Rothschild group was
still powerful enough
to drive
into bankruptcy
the
Catholic Union Generale, the real purpose of which had been to ruin Jewish
bankers.-'^ Immediately
after the conclusion
of
the peace
treaty
of
1871,
whose financial provisions had been handled on the French side by Roth-
schild and on the German side by Bleichroeder, a former agent of the house,
the Rothschilds embarked on an unprecedented policy: they came out openly
for the monarchists and against the republic.^^ What was new in
this was
not the monarchist trend but the
fact that for the
first time an important
Jewish financial power set
itself in opposition to the current regime. Up to
that time the Rothschilds had accommodated themselves to whatever political
system was
in power.
It seemed,
therefore,
that the republic was
the
first
form of government that really had no use for them.
Both the political influence and the social status of the Jews had for cen-
turies been due to the fact that they were a closed group who worked directly
for the
state and were directly protected by
it on account of
their special
services. Their close and immediate connection with the machinery of gov-
ernment was possible only so long as the state remained at a distance from
the people, while the ruling classes continued to be indifferent to
its manage-
ment. In such circumstances the Jews were, from the
state's point of view,
the most dependable element in society just because they did not really be-
long to
it. The parliamentary system allowed the liberal bourgeoisie to gain
control of the
state machine. To
this
bourgeoisie, however,
the Jews had
never belonged and they therefore regarded
it with a not unwarranted sus-
picion. The regime no longer needed the Jews
as much as before, since
it
was now possible
to achieve through Parliament a financial expansion be-
yond the wildest dreams of the former more or less absolute or constitutional
monarchs. Thus the leading Jewish houses gradually faded from the scene of
finance
politics and betook themselves more and more
to
the
antisemitic
salons of the aristocracy, there to dream of financing reactionary movements
designed to restore the good old days." Meanwhile, however, other Jewish
circles, newcomers among Jewish plutocrats, were beginning to take an in-

life
of
the
Third
Republic. What
the
Rothschilds
had
almost
forgotten
and
what
had
nearly
cost them
their
power was
the simple
fact
That once
they
withdrew, even
for a moment,
from
active
interest
in a regime,
they immediately
lost
their
influence not
only upon cabinet circles but upon the Jews. The Jewish immigrants were
the
first to see their chance.-"* They realized only too well that the republic,
as
it had developed, was not the logical sequel of a united people's uprising.
Out of the slaughter of some 20,000 Communards, out of military defeat
and economic
collapse,
what had
in
fact emerged was
a
regime whose
capacity
for government had been doubtful from
its
inception. So much,
indeed, was
this
the case
that within
three years a society brought
to the
brink of ruin was clamoring for a dictator. And when
it got one in President
General MacMahon
(whose
only
claim
to
distinction was
his
defeat
at
Sedan )
, that individual had promptly turned out to be a parliamentarian of
the old school and after a few years (1879)
resigned. Meanwhile, however,
the various elements
in
society, from the opportunists to the radicals and
from
the coalitionists
to the extreme
right, had made up their minds what
kind of policies they required from their representatives and what methods
they ought to employ. The right policy was defense of vested interests and
the right method was corruption.^^ After 1881, swindle (to quote Leon Say)
became the only law.
It has been
justly observed that at
this period of French history every
political
party had
its Jew,
in
the same way
that every
royal household
once had its court Jew.^° The difference, however, was profound. Investment
of Jewish capital in the state had helped to give the Jews a productive role
in
the economy of Europe. Without their assistance the eighteenth-century
development of the nation-state and
its independent civil service would have
been inconceivable. It was, after all, to these court Jews that Western Jewry
owed
its emancipation. The shady
transactions
of Reinach and
his con-
federates did not even lead to permanent riches. ^^ All they did was to shroud

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR

in even deeper darkness
the mysterious and scandalous
relations between
business and politics. These parasites upon a corrupt body served to provide
a thoroughly decadent
society with an exceedingly dangerous
alibi.
Since
they were Jews
it was possible
to make scapegoats
of them when
public
indignation had to be allayed. Afterwards things could go on the same old
way. The antisemites could at once point to the Jewish parasites on a cor-
rupt society in order to "prove" that
all Jews everywhere were nothing but
termites
in
the otherwise healthy body of the people.
It did not matter to
them that the corruption of the body politic had started without the help of
Jews; that the policy of businessmen
(in a bourgeois society to which Jews
had not belonged) and their ideal of unlimited competition had led to the
disintegration of the state in party politics; that the ruling classes had proved
incapable any longer of protecting
their own
interests,
let alone
those
of
the
country
as
a
whole. The
antisemites who
called
themselves
patriots
introduced that new species of national feeling which consists primarily
in
a complete whitewash of one's own people and a sweeping condemnation
of all others.
The Jews could remain a separate group outside of society only so long
as a more or less homogeneous and stable state machine had a use for them
and was
interested
in
protecting
them. The
decay
of
the
state machine
brought about the dissolution of the closed ranks of Jewry, which had so
long been bound up with
it. The
first sign of
this appeared
in the
affairs
conducted by newly naturalized French Jews over whom
their native-born
brethren had
lost control
in much the same way
as occurred
in the Ger-
many of the
inflation period. The newcomers
filled
the gaps between the
commercial world and the state.
Far more
disastrous was another process which
likewise began
at
this
time and which was imposed from above. The dissolution of the state into
factions, while
it disrupted
the closed
society of the Jews,
did not force
them into a vacuum in which they could go on vegetating outside of state
and society. For that the Jews were too rich and,
at a time when money
was one of the
salient requisites of power, too powerful. Rather did they
tend to become absorbed into the variety of social "sets," in accordance with
their
political leanings
or, more frequently,
their social connections.
This,
however, did not lead to their disappearance. On the contrary, they main-
tained certain
relations with
the
state machine and continued,
albeit
in a
crucially different form, to manipulate the business of the state. Thus, despite
their known opposition to the Third Republic,
it was none other than the
Rothschilds who undertook the placement of the Russian loan while Arthur
Meyer, though baptized and an avowed monarchist, was among those
in-
volved in the Panama scandal. This meant that the newcomers
in French
Jewry who formed the principal
links between private commerce and the
machinery of government were followed by the native-born. But
if the Jews
had previously constituted a strong, close-knit group, whose usefulness for
the state was obvious, they were now split up into cliques, mutually antag-
onistic but all bent on the same purpose of helping society to batten on the
state.

ANTISEMITISM
III:
Army and Clergy Against the Republic
SEEMINGLY REMOVED ffom
all
such
factofs,
Seemingly immune from
all
corruption, stood
the army, a heritage from
the Second Empire. The
re-
public had never dared to dominate
it, even when monarchistic sympathies
and intrigues came
to open expression
in
the Boulanger
crisis. The
officer
class consisted then
as before of the sons of those old aristocratic families
whose ancestors, as emigres, had fought against their fatherland during the
revolutionary wars. These
officers were strongly under the influence of the
clergy who ever since the Revolution had made a point of supporting
re-
actionary
and
antirepublican
movements.
Their
influence
was
perhaps
equally strong over those
officers who were of somewhat lower birth but
who hoped, as a result of the Church's old practice of marking talent without
regard to pedigree, to gain promotion with the help of the clergy.
In
contrast
to
the
shifting and
fluid
cliques of
society and
Parliament,
where admission was easy and allegiance fickle, stood the rigorous exclusive-
ness of the army, so characteristic of the caste system.
It was neither mili-
tary life, professional honor, nor esprit de corps that held
its officers together
to form a reactionary bulwark against the republic and against all democratic
influences;
it was simply the
tie of caste." The refusal of the state to democ-
ratize the army and to subject
it to the civil authorities entailed remarkable
consequences.
It made the army an entity outside of the nation and created
an armed power whose
loyalties could be turned
in directions which none
could foretell. That this caste-ridden power,
if but left to
itself, was neither
for nor against anyone
is shown clearly by the story of the almost burlesque
coups d'etat
in which, despite statements to the contrary,
it was
really un-
willing to take part. Even
its notorious monarchism was, in the final analysis,
nothing but an excuse for preserving itself as an independent interest-group,
ready
to defend
its
privileges "without regard
to and
in
despite
of, even
against the republic."
'-^ Contemporary journalists and later historians have
made valiant efforts to explain the conflict between military and civil powers
during the Dreyfus Affair in terms of an antagonism between "businessmen
and soldiers." " We know today, however, how unjustified
is this indirectly
antiscmitic interpretation. The
intelligence department of the General
Staff
were themselves reasonably expert at business. Were they not trafficking as

loc.
cil.: "The reason
the army was
reluctant
to make a move
was
that
it wanted
to show
its opposition
to the
civil power of the republic, without
at the same time losing the force of that opposition by committing itself to a monarchy."

that Maximilian Harden
(a German Jew)
described the
Dreyfus case
in Die Zukunjt (1898). Walter Frank, the antisemitic historian, employs
the same
slogan

the heading of
his chapter on Dreyfus while Bernanos

tary

openly in forged bordereaux and
selling them
as nonchalantly
to foreign
military attaches as a leather merchant might traffic in skins and then become
President of the Republic, or the son-in-law of the President traffic in honors
and distinctions? ^^ Indeed, the zeal of Schwartzkoppen, the German attache,
who was anxious to discover more military secrets than France had to hide,
must have been a positive source of embarrassment
to these gentlemen of
the counterespionage service who,
after
all, could
sell no more than they
produced.
It was the great mistake of Catholic politicians to imagine that, in pursuit
of their European policy, they could make use of the French army simply
because
it appeared to be antirepublican. The Church was,
in
fact,
slated
to pay for this error with the loss of its entire political influence in France.^"
When
the department
of
intelligence
finally emerged
as
a common
fake
factory, as Esterhazy, who was in a position to know, described the Deuxieme
Bureau," no one in France, not even the army, was so seriously compro-
mised as the Church. Toward the end of the last century the Catholic clergy
had been seeking
to recover
its old
political power
in
just those quarters
where, for one or another reason, secular authority was on the wane among
the people. Cases
in point were those of Spain, where a decadent feudal
aristocracy had brought about the economic and cultural ruin of the coun-
try, and Austria-Hungary, where a conflict of nationalities was threatening
daily to disrupt the state. And such too was the case in France, where the
nation appeared to be sinking fast into the slough of conflicting interests.^®
The army—left
in a
political vacuum by the Third Republic—gladly
ac-
cepted the guidance of the Catholic clergy which at least provided for civilian
leadership without which the military lose their "raison d'etre (which)
is to
defend the principle embodied
in
civilian society"—as Clemenceau put
it.
The Catholic Church then owed
its popularity to the widespread popular
skepticism which saw in the republic and in democracy the loss of all order,
security, and
political
will. To many the hierarchic system
of the Church
seemed the only escape from chaos. Indeed,
it was
this,
rather than any
religious revivahsm, which caused the clergy
to be held
in respect. ^^ As a
matter of fact, the staunchest supporters of the Church at that period were
the exponents of that so-called "cerebral" Catholicism, the "Cafliolics with-
out faith," who were henceforth to dominate the entire monarchist and ex-

treme nationalist movement. Without believing in their other-worldly basis,
these "Catholics" clamored for more power to
all authoritarian institutions.
This, indeed, had been the line first laid down by Drumont and later endorsed
by Maurras/**
The
large
majority
of
the Catholic
clergy,
deeply involved
in
political
maneuvers,
followed
a
policy of accommodation.
In
this,
as
the Dreyfus
Affair makes clear, they were conspicuously successful. Thus, when Victor
Basch took up the cause for a retrial his house at Rennes was stormed under
the leadership of three priests," while no less distinguished a figure than the
Dominican Father Didon
called on
the
students
of the College D'Arcueil
to "draw the sword,
terrorize, cut off heads and run amok."
"'- Similar too
was the outlook of the three hundred lesser clerics who immortalized them-
selves in the "Henry Memorial," as the Libre Parole's list of subscribers to a
fund for the benefit of Madame Henry (widow of the Colonel who had com-
mitted suicide while in prison ") was called, and which certainly
is a monu-
ment
for
all
time
to
the shocking corruption
of
the upper
classes
of the
French people
at that date. During the period of the Dreyfus
crisis
it was
not her regular clergy, not her ordinary reUgious orders, and certainly not
her homines religiosi who influenced the political line of the Catholic Church.
As far as Europe was concerned, her reactionary policies in France, Austria,
and Spain, as well as her support of antisemitic trends in Vienna, Paris, and
Algiers were probably an immediate consequence of Jesuit influence.
It was
the Jesuits who had always best represented, both in the written and spoken
word,
the
antisemitic
school
of
the Catholic
clergy.** This
is
largely
the
consequence of their statutes according to which each novice must prove that
he has no Jewish blood back to the fourth generation.*^ And since the be-
ginning of the nineteenth century the direction of the Church's international
policy had passed into their hands.**

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR
103
We have already observed how the
dissolution of the
state machinery
facilitated
the entry
of the Rothschilds
into
the
circles
of the
antisemitic
aristocracy. The
fashionable
set
of Faubourg
Saint-Germain
opened
its
doors not only to a few ennobled Jews, but their baptized sycophants, the
antisemitic Jews, were
also
suffered
to
drift
in
as well
as complete new-
comers.*^ Curiously enough, the Jews of Alsace, who like the Dreyfus family
had moved to Paris following the cession of that territory, took an especially
prominent part in this social climb. Their exaggerated patriotism came out
most markedly in the way they strove to dissociate themselves from Jewish
immigrants. The Dreyfus family belonged to that section of French Jewry
which sought
to
assimilate by adopting
its own brand
of
antisemitism.**
This adjustment
to
the French
aristocracy had one
inevitable
result:
the
Jews
tried
to launch
their sons upon
the same higher military
careers
as
were pursued by those of their new-found friends. It was here that the
first
cause of
friction
arose. The admission of the Jews
into high
society had
been relatively peaceful. The upper classes, despite their dreams of a restored
monarchy, were a
politically spineless
lot and did not bother unduly one
way or the other. But when the Jews began seeking equality
in the army,
they came face to face with the determined opposition of the Jesuits who
were not prepared to tolerate the existence of officers immune to the influence
of the confessional." Moreover, they came up
against an inveterate caste
spirit, which the easy atmosphere of the salons had led them
to
forget, a
caste
spirit which,
already strengthened by
tradition and
calling, was
still
further
fortified by uncompromising
hostility
to
the Third Republic and
to the civil administration.
A modern historian has described the struggle between Jews and Jesuits
as a "struggle between two rivals," in which the "higher Jesuit clergy and
the Jewish plutocracy stood facing one another in the middle of France hke
two invisible lines of battle." ^° The description
is true insofar as the Jews
great Jesuit controversialist, always demanded
it should become, an absolute monarchy
whose
policies can be directed by the
Jesuits and whose development can be
deter-
mined by pressing a button."

JQ4
ANTISEMITISM
found
in
the
Jesuits
their
first
unappeasable
foes,
while
the
latter came
promptly
to
realize how powerful
a weapon
antisemitism could
be. This
was the
first attempt and the only one prior to Hitler to exploit the "major
political concept" " of antisemitism on a Pan-European scale. On the other
hand, however,
if
it
is assumed
that
the
struggle was one
of two equally
matched
"rivals"
the
description
is
palpably
false. The Jews
sought no
higher degree of power than was being wielded by any of the other cliques
into which the republic had
split. All they desired at the time was sufficient
influence to pursue their social and business interests. They did not aspire to
a political share
in the management of the
state. The only organized group
who sought that were the Jesuits. The
trial of Dreyfus was preceded by a
number of incidents which show how resolutely and energetically the Jews
tried to gain a place
in the army and how common, even at that time, was
the
hostility
toward
them.
Constantly
subjected
to
gross
insult,
the few
Jewish
officers there were were obliged always to fight duels while Gentile
comrades were unwilling to act as
their seconds.
It
is, indeed,
in
this con-
nection that the infamous Esterhazy first comes upon the scene as an excep-
tion to the rule."
It has always remained somewhat obscure whether the
arrest and con-
demnation of Dreyfus was simply a judicial error which
just happened by
chance
to
light up
a
political conflagration, or whether
the General
Staff
deliberately planted the forged bordereau for the express purpose of at last
branding a Jew as a traitor. In favor of the latter hypothesis
is the fact that
Dreyfus was the first Jew to find a post on the General Staff and under exist-
ing conditions this could only have aroused not merely annoyance but posi-
tive fury and consternation. In any case anti-Jewish hatred was unleashed
even before the verdict was returned. Contrary to custom, which demanded
the withholding of
all information in a spy case
still sub iudice, officers of
the
General Staff cheerfully supplied the Libre Parole with details of the case
and the name of the accused. Apparently they feared lest Jewish influence
with the government lead to a suppression of the
trial and a
stifling of the
whole
business. Some show of plausibility was afforded these fears by the
fact
that
certain
circles
of French Jewry were known
at
the
time
to be
seriously concerned about the precarious situation of Jewish officers.

Bernanos, op.

"So, shorn of ridiculous hyperbole,

it
really
is:
not a mere
piece of crankiness,
a mental
quirk,
but a major political concept."

"I did not hesitate when Captain Cremieux could

occasion
was
in
September,
1896, when
he
received
10,000
francs.
This
misplaced
generosity was
later
to have disquieting
results. When, from the comfortable
security
of England. Esterhazy at length made his revelations and thereby compelled a revision
of
the
case,
the
antisemitic
press
naturally
suggested
that he had been
paid by
the
Jews
for
his self-condemnation. The
idea
is
still advanced
as
a major argument
in
favor of Dreyfus' guilt.

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR
105
It must also be remembered that the Panama scandal was then fresh in
the public mind and that following the Rothschild loan to Russia distrust of
the Jews had grown
considerably.^^ War
Minister
Mercier was
not only
lauded by the bourgeois press at every fresh turn of the trial but even Jaures'
paper, the organ of the socialists, congratulated him on "having opposed the
formidable pressure of corrupt politicians and high finance." ^* Character-
istically this encomium drew from the Libre Parole the unstinted commenda-
tion, "Bravo, Jaures!" Two years later, when Bernard Lazare published his
first pamphlet on the miscarriage of justice, Jaures' paper carefully refrained
from discussing
its contents but charged the sociaUst author with being an
admirer of Rothschild and probably a paid agent." Similarly, as late as 1897,
when the fight for Dreyfus' reinstatement had already begun, Jaures could
see nothing in
it but the conflict of two bourgeois groups, the opportunists
and the clerics.
Finally, even after the Rennes retrial Wilhelm Liebknecht,
the German Social Democrat,
still believed in the guilt of Dreyfus because
he could not imagine that a member of the upper classes could ever be the
victim of a false verdict.^^
The skepticism of the radical and
socialist press,
strongly colored
as
it
was by anti-Jewish feelings, was strengthened by the bizarre
tactics of the
Dreyfus family in
its attempt to secure a retrial. In trying to save an inno-
cent man they employed the very methods usually adopted in the case of a
guilty one. They stood in mortal terror of publicity and relied exclusively on
back-door maneuvers." They were lavish with their cash and treated Lazare,
one of their most valuable helpers and one of the greatest figures in the case,
as if he were their paid agent.^^ Clemenceau, Zola, Picquard, and Labori—to
53 Herzog, op.
cit., under date of 1892 shows
at length how the Rothschilds began
to adapt themselves to the republic. Curiously enough the papal policy of coalitionism,
which
represents an attempt
at rapprochement by
the Catholic Church,
dates from
precisely
the same
year.
It
is therefore
not
impossible
that
the
Rothschild
line was
influenced by
the
clergy. As
for
the
loan
of 500
million
francs
to
Russia, Count
Miinster
pertinently
observed:
"Speculation
is
dead
in
France.
.
.
. The
capitalists
can
find no way of
negotiating
their
securities
.
.
. and
this
will
contribute
to
the
success of the loan.
.
.
. The big Jews believe that
if they make money they will best
be able to help their small-time brethren. The result
is that, though the French market
is
glutted
with
Russian
securities, Frenchmen
are
still
giving good

family,
for
instance, summarily
rejected
the
suggestion of Arthur
Levy, the writer, and Levy-Bruhl, the scholar, that they should circulate a petition of
protest among
all leading figures of public
life. Instead they embarked on a series of
personal
approaches
to
any
politician
with whom
they happened
to
have
contact;

name but the more active of the Dreyfusards—could in the end only save
their good names by dissociating their efforts, with greater or less fuss and
publicity, from the more concrete aspects of the issue. ^^
There was only one basis on which Dreyfus could or should have been
saved. The
intrigues
of a corrupt
Parliament,
the dry
rot of a collapsing
society, and the clergy's lust for power should have been met squarely with
the
stern
Jacobin concept
of
the
nation
based upon human
rights—that
republican
view
of communal
life
which
asserts
that
(in
the
words
of
Clcmenceau) by infringing on the rights of one you infringe on
the rights
of
all. To rely on Parliament or on society was to lose the fight before be-
ginning
it. For one thing the resources of Jewry were
in no way superior
to those of the rich Catholic bourgeoisie; for another all of the higher strata
of society, from the clerical and aristocratic families of the Faubourg Saint-
Germain
to
the
anticlerical and
radical
petty
bourgeoisie, were
only
too
willing to see the Jews formally removed from the body pohtic. In this way,
they reckoned,
they would be able
to purge themselves of possible
taint.
The loss of Jewish social and commercial contacts seemed to them a price
well worth paying. Similarly, as the utterances of Jaures indicate, the Affair
was regarded by Parliament as
a golden opportunity for rehabilitating, or
rather regaining,
its time-honored reputation for incorruptibility.
Last, but
by no means
least,
in the countenancing of such slogans as "Death
to the
Jews" or "France for the French" an almost magic formula was discovered
for reconciling the masses to the existent state of government and society.

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR
707
Both views go back to the same fundamental error of regarding the mob as
identical with rather than as a caricature of the people.
The mob is primarily a group in which the residue of all classes are repre-
sented. This makes
it so easy to mistake the mob for the people, which also
comprises
all
strata
of
society. While
the people
in
all
great revolutions
fight
for
true
representation,
the mob
always
will
shout
for
the
"strong
man," the "great leader." For the mob hates society from which it is excluded,
as well as Parliament where
it is not represented. Plebiscites, therefore, with
which modern mob leaders have obtained such excellent results, are an old
concept of politicians who rely upon the mob. One of the more intelligent
leaders
of
the
Anti-Dreyfusards,
Deroulede,
clamored
for
a
"Republic
through
plebiscite."
High
society and
politicians
of
the Third Republic had produced
the
French mob in a series of scandals and public frauds. They now felt a tender
sentiment of parental familiarity with
their offspring, a feeling mixed with
admiration and fear. The least society could do for its offspring was to pro-
tect
it verbally. While the mob actually stormed Jewish shops and assailed
Jews in the streets, the language of high society made
real, passionate vio-
lence look
like harmless
child's
play.''^ The most important
of
the
con-
temporary documents
in
this
respect
is
the "Henry Memorial" and
the
various solutions
it proposed to the Jewish question: Jews were to be torn
to pieces like Marsyas in the Greek myth; Reinach ought to be boiled aUve;
Jews should be stewed in
oil or pierced to death with needles; they should
be "circumcised up to the neck." One group of officers expressed great im-
patience to try out a new type of gun on the 100,000 Jews in the country.
Among the subscribers were more than 1,000
officers, including four gen-
erals in active service, and the minister of war, Mercier. The relatively large
number of intellectuals ^- and even of Jews in the list is surprising. The upper
classes knew that the mob was flesh of their flesh and blood of their blood.
Even a Jewish historian of the time, although he had seen with his own eyes
that Jews are no longer safe when the mob rules the street, spoke with secret
admiration
of
the
"great
collective movement." ^^
This
only shows how
deeply most Jews were rooted in a society which was attempting to eUminate
them.
If Bemanos, with reference to the Dreyfus Affair, describes antisemitism
as a major political concept, he is undoubtedly right with respect to the mob.

article by Andre Chevrillon, "Huit Jours a Rennes,"
in La Grande Revue, February,

some friends of mine about Dreyfus, chanced to remark, 'I'd like to torture him.' 'And
I wish,' rejoined one of the ladies, 'that he were innocent. Then he'd suffer more.' "

ANTISEMITISM
It had been
tried out previously
in
Berlin and Vienna, by Ahlwardt and
Stoecker,
by
Schoenerer and
Lueger,
but nowhere was
its
efficacy more
clearly proved than
in France. There can be no doubt that
in the eyes of
the mob the Jews came
to serve as an object lesson for
all the things they
detested.
If they hated society they could point to the way in which the Jews
were tolerated within
it; and
if they hated the government they could point
to the way in which the Jews had been protected by or were identifiable with
the state. While
it
is a mistake to assume that the mob preys only on Jews,
the Jews must be accorded
first place among
its favorite victims.
E.xcluded as
it
is from society and political representation, the mob turns
of necessity
to extraparliamentary
action. Moreover,
it
is inclined
to seek
the real forces of political
life in those movements and influences which are
hidden from view and work behind the scenes. There can be no doubt that
during
the
nineteenth
century Jewry
fell
into
this
category,
as
did
Free-
masonry
(especially
in Latin countries) and the
Jesuits."*
It
is, of course,
utterly untrue
that any of these groups
really
constituted a
secret
society
bent on dominating the world by means of a gigantic conspiracy. Neverthe-
less,
it
is
true
that
their
influence, however overt
it may have been, was
exerted beyond the formal realm of politics, operating on a large
scale
in
lobbies, lodges, and the confessional. Ever since the French Revolution these
three groups have shared
the doubtful honor of being,
in the eyes of the
European mob, the pivotal point of world politics. During the Dreyfus crisis
each was able to exploit this popular notion by hurling at the other charges
of conspiring to world domination. The slogan,
"secret Judah,"
is due, no
doubt,
to the inventiveness of certain Jesuits, who chose to see
in the
first
Zionist Congress (1897)
the core of a Jewish world conspiracy.*'^ Similarly,
the concept of "secret Rome" is due to the anticlerical Freemasons and per-
haps to the indiscriminate slanders of some Jews as well.
The fickleness of the mob
is proverbial, as the opponents of Dreyfus were
to
learn
to
their sorrow when,
in
1899,
the wind changed and
the small
group of true republicans, headed by Clemenceau, suddenly
realized, with
mixed feelings, that a section of the mob had rallied to their side.^" In some
eyes
the two
parties
to
the great controversy now seemed
like "two
rival
gangs of charlatans squabbling for recognition by the rabble"
''^ while actually
the voice of the Jacobin Clemenceau had succeeded
in bringing back one
part of the French people to their greatest tradition. Thus the great scholar,
Emile Duclaux, could write:
"In
this drama played before a whole people
^* A study of European superstition would probably show that Jews became objects
of this typically nineteenth-century brand of superstition fairly late. They were preceded
by the Rosicrucians, Templars, Jesuits, and Freemasons. The treatment of nineteenth-
century history suffers greatly from the lack of such a study.

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR
109
and so worked up by the press
that the whole nation ultimately took part
in
it, we see the chorus and anti-chorus of the ancient tragedy railing at each
other. The scene is France and the theater is the world."
Led by the Jesuits and aided by the mob the army
at last stepped into
the fray confident of victory. Counterattack from the
civil power had been
effectively forestalled. The antisemitic press had stopped men's mouths by
publishing Reinach's
lists of the deputies involved in the Panama scandal.^*
Everything suggested an effortless triumph. The society and the politicians
of the Third Republic,
its scandals and
affairs, had created a new class of
declasses; they could not be expected to fight against their own product; on
the
contrary,
they were
to adopt
the language and outlook
of
the mob.
Through the army the Jesuits would gain the upper hand over the corrupt
civil power and the way would thus be paved for a bloodless coup d'etat.
So long as there was only the Dreyfus family trying with bizarre methods
to rescue their kinsman from Devil's Island, and so long as there were only
Jews concerned about their standing in the antisemitic salons and the
still
more
antisemitic army,
everything
certainly pointed
that way.
Obviously
there was no reason to expect an attack on the army or on society from that
quarter. Was not the sole desire of the Jews to continue to be accepted in
society and
suffered
in
the armed
forces? No one
in
military or
civilian
circles needed to suffer a sleepless night on their account.*'^
It was discon-
certing,
therefore, when
it transpired
that
in the
intelligence
office
of the
General
Staff
there
sat
a high
officer, who, though possessed
of
a good
Catholic background, excellent military prospects, and the "proper" degree
of antipathy toward the Jews, had yet not adopted the principle that the end
justifies the means. Such a man,
utterly divorced from
social clannishness
or professional ambition, was Picquard, and of this simple, quiet, politically
disinterested spirit the General Staff was soon to have
its
fill. Picquard was
no hero and certainly no martyr. He was simply that common type of citizen
with an average interest in public affairs who in the hour of danger (though
not a minute earlier)
stands up to defend his country in the same unques-
tioning way as he discharges his daily dutiesJ" Nevertheless, the cause only
68 To what extent the hands of members of Parliament were
tied
is shown by the
case of Scheurer-Kestner, one of their better elements and vice-president of the senate.
No sooner had he entered his protest against the
trial than Libre Parole proclaimed
the
fact that
his
son-in-law had been involved
in the Panama
scandal.

1897.

cit., Book VII, ch.
1
: "The desire to
let the matter rest was not
uncommon among French Jews, especially among the
richer French Jews."
^0 Immediately after he had made
his discoveries Picquard was banished to a dan-
gerous post
in Tunis. Thereupon he made
his
will, exposed
the whole
business, and
deposited a copy of the document with
his lawyer. A few months
later, when
it was
discovered
that he was
still
alive,
a deluge
of mysterious
letters came
pouring
in,
compromising him and accusing him of complicity with che "traitor" Dreyfus. He was
treated
like a gangster who had threatened to "squeal." When
all
this proved of no
avail, he was arrested, drummed out of the array, and divested of his decorations,
all
of which he endured with quiet equaoimity.

JJQ
ANTISEMITISM
grew serious when, after several delays and hesitations, Clemenceau at last
became convinced
that Dreyfus was
innocent and
the
republic
in danger.
At the beginning of the struggle only a handful of well-known writers and
scholars
rallied
to
the
cause,
Zola, Anatole
France,
E. Duclaux,
Gabriel
Monod, the historian, and Lucien Herr, librarian of the Ecole Normalc. To
these must be added the small and then
insignificant circle of young
intel-
lectuals who were
later
to make
history
in
the Cahiers de
la
quinzaine.''^
That, however, was
the
full
roster
of Clemenceau's
allies. There was no
political group, not a single politician of repute, ready to stand
at his side.
The
greatness
of Clemenceau's approach
lies
in
the
fact
that
it was
not
directed against a particular miscarriage of justice, but was based upon such
"abstract" ideas as justice,
liberty, and civic virtue.
It was based,
in short,
on
those very concepts which had formed
the
staple
of old-time Jacobin
patriotism and against which much mud and abuse had already been hurled.
As time wore on and Clemenceau continued, unmoved by threats and dis-
appointments, to enunciate the same truths and to embody them in demands,
the more "concrete" nationalists lost ground. Followers of men like Barres,
who had accused the supporters of Dreyfus of losing themselves in a "welter
of metaphysics," came
to realize
that the abstractions of the "Tiger" were
actually nearer
to
political
realities than the
limited
intelligence of ruined
businessmen or the barren traditionalism of
fatalistic
intellectuals.'^^ Where
the
concrete approach
of
the
realistic
nationalists
eventually
led them
is
illustrated by
the
priceless
story of how Charles Maurras had "the honor
and pleasure,"
after
the defeat of France, of falling
in during his
flight
to
the south with a female astrologer who interpreted to him the political mean-
ing of recent events and advised him to collaborate with the Nazis. ^^
Although antisemitism had undoubtedly gained ground during the three
years following the
arrest of Dreyfus, before the opening of Clemenceau's
campaign,
and
although
the
anti-Jewish
press had
attained
a
circulation
comparable
to that of the
chief papers, the
streets had remained
quiet.
It
was only when Clemenceau began his articles in L'Aiirore, when Zola pub-
lished
his
J'Accuse, and when the Rennes tribunal set
off the dismal suc-
cession of trials and retrials that the mob stirred into action. Every stroke of
the Dreyfusards (who were known
to be a small minority)
was followed
by a more or
less violent disturbance on the
streets.^* The organization of
the mob by the General Staff was remarkable. The

THE DREYFUS AFFAIR
HI
the army to the Libre Parole which, directly or indirectly, through its articles
or the personal intervention of
its editors, mobilized students, monarchists,
adventurers, and plain gangsters and pushed them into the
streets.
If Zola
uttered a word, at once his windows were stoned. If Scheurer-Kestner wrote
to the colonial minister, he was at once beaten up on the streets while the
papers made scurrilous attacks on his private
life. And
all accounts agree
that
if Zola, when once charged, had been acquitted he would never have
left the courtroom alive.
The
cry, "Death
to
the
Jews,"
swept
the
country.
In Lyon,
Rennes,
Nantes,
Tours,
Bordeaux,
Clermont-Ferrant,
and
Marseille—everywhere,
in
fact—antisemitic
riots broke out and were
invariably
traceable
to
the
same source. Popular indignation broke out everywhere on
the same day
and at precisely the same hour." Under the leadership of Guerin the mob
took on a military complexion. Antisemitic shock troops appeared on the
streets and made certain that every pro-Dreyfus meeting should end in blood-
shed. The complicity of the pohce was everywhere patent.^^
The most modern figure on the side of the Anti-Dreyfusards was probably
Jules Guerin. Ruined in business, he had begun his political career as a police
stool pigeon, and acquired that
flair for discipline and organization which
invariably marks the underworld. This he was later able to divert into political
channels, becoming the founder and head of the Ligue Antisemite. In him
high society found its first criminal hero. In its adulation of Guerin bourgeois
society showed clearly that in its code of morals and ethics
it had broken for
good with
its own standards. Behind the Ligue stood two members of the
aristocracy, the Duke of Orleans and the Marquis de Mores. The latter had
lost his fortune in America and became famous for organizing the butchers of
Paris into a manslaughtering brigade.
Most eloquent of these modern tendencies was the farcical siege of the
so-called Fort Chabrol.
It was here,
in
this
first of "Brown Houses," that
the cream of the Ligue Antisemite foregathered when the police decided at
last to arrest their leader. The installations were the acme of technical per-
fection. "The windows were protected by iron shutters. There was a system
of electric bells and telephones from cellar to roof. Five yards or so behind
the massive entrance,
itself always kept locked and bolted, there was a
tall
grill of cast iron. On the right, between the grill and the main entrance was
a small door, likewise iron-plated, behind which sentries, handpicked from
the butcher legions, mounted guard day and night." " Max Regis, instigator
of the Algerian pogroms,
is another who strikes a modern note.
It was this
youthful Regis who once called upon a cheering Paris rabble to "water the
^5 On January

1898,
antisemitic demonstrations took place
at Bordeaux, Mar-
seille,
Clermont-Ferrant,
Nantes,
Rouen,
and
Lyon. On
the
following day
student
riots broke out in Rouen, Toulouse, and Nantes.
^6 The crudest instance was that of the police prefect of Rennes, who advised Pro-
fessor Victor Basch, when the
latter's house was stormed by a mob 2,000 strong, that
he ought to hand in his resignation, as he could no longer guarantee his safety.

ANTISEMITISM
tree of freedom with the blood of the Jews." Regis represented that section
of the movement which hoped to achieve power by legal and parliamentary
methods. In accordance with
this program he had himself elected mayor of
Algiers and utilized his office to unleash the pogroms in which several Jews
were
killed,
Jewish women
criminally
assaulted and Jewish-owned
stores
looted.
It was to him also that the polished and cultured Edouard Drumont,
that most famous French antisemite, owed his seat in Parliament.
What was new
in
all
this was not the activity of the mob; for that there
were abundant precedents. What was new and surprising at the time—though
all too familiar to us—was the organization of the mob and the hero-worship
enjoyed by
its leaders. The mob became the direct agent of that "concrete"
nationalism espoused by Barres, Maurras, and Daudet, who together formed
what was undoubtedly a kind of elite of the younger intellectuals. These men,
who despised the people and who had themselves but recently emerged from
a ruinous and decadent cult of estheticism, saw in the mob a living expression
of virile and primitive "strength."
It was they and their theories which
first
identified the mob with
the people and converted
its leaders into national
heroes.'** It was their philosophy of pessimism and their deUght in doom that
was the
first sign of the imminent collapse of the European inteUigentsia.
Even Clemenceau was not immune from the temptation to
identify the
mob with
the
people. What made him
especially prone
to
this
error was
the
consistently ambiguous
attitude
of
the Labor party toward
the
ques-
tion of "abstract"
justice. No party, including the
socialists, was ready to
make an issue of justice per se, "to stand, come what may, for justice, the
sole unbreakable bond of union between
civilized men." " The
socialists
stood for the interests of the workers, the opportunists for those of the liberal
bourgeoisie,
the
coalitionists for those of
the Catholic higher
classes, and
the radicals for those of the anticlerical petty bourgeoisie. The socialists had
the great advantage of speaking in the name of a homogeneous and united
class. Unlike the bourgeois parties they did not represent a society which
had split into innumerable cliques and cabals. Nevertheless, they were con-
cerned primarily and essentially with the interests of their class. They were
not troubled by any higher obligation toward human solidarity and had no
conception
of what communal
life
really meant. Typical of
their
attitude
was the observation of Jules Guesde, the counterpart of Jaures in the French
party, that "law and honor are mere words."
The
nihilism which characterized
the
nationalists was no monopoly
of
the Anti-Dreyfusards. On the contrary, a large proportion of the
socialists
and many of those who championed Dreyfus,
like Guesde, spoke the same
language.
If the Catholic La Croix remarked that "it is no longer a question
whether Dreyfus
is innocent or guilty but only of who will win, the friends
of the army or
its foes," the corresponding sentiment might well have been

voiced, mutatis mutandis, by the partisans of Dreyfus.^" Not only the mob
but a considerable section of the French people declared itself, at best, quite
uninterested in whether one group of the population was or was not to be
excluded from the law.
As soon as the mob began its campaign of terror against the partisans of
Dreyfus, it found the path open before
it. As Clemenceau attests, the workers
of Paris cared little for the whole affair. If the various elements of the bour-
geoisie squabbled among themselves,
that,
they thought,
scarcely
affected
their own interests. "With the open consent of the people," wrote Clemen-
ceau, "they have proclaimed before the world the failure of their 'democracy.'
Through them
a
sovereign people shows
itself
thrust from
its
throne
of
justice, shorn of
its infallible majesty. For there
is no denying that this evil
has befallen us with the full complicity of the people itself.
.
.
. The people
is not God. Anyone could have foreseen that this new divinity would some
day topple to his fall. A collective tyrant, spread over the length and breadth
of the land,
is no more acceptable than a single tyrant ensconced upon his
throne." "
At last Clemenceau convinced Jaures that an infringement of the rights
of one man was an infringement of the rights of
all. But in this he was suc-
cessful only because the wrongdoers happened to be the inveterate enemies
of the people ever since
the Revolution, namely,
the
aristocracy and
the
clergy.
It was against the rich and the clergy, not for the republic, not for
justice and freedom that the workers
finally took to the
streets. True, both
the speeches of Jaures and the
articles of Clemenceau are redolent of the
old revolutionary passion for human
rights. True,
also,
that
this passion
was strong enough to rally the people to the struggle, but
first they had to
be convinced that not only justice and the honor of the repubhc were at stake
but also their own class "interests." As
it was, a large number of socialists,
both inside and outside the country,
still regarded
it as a mistake to meddle
(as they put
it)
in the internecine quarrels of the bourgeoisie or to bother
about saving the republic.
The
first to wean the workers,
at least partially, from
this mood of in-
difference was that great lover of the people, Emile Zola. In his famous in-
dictment of the republic he was also, however, the
first to deflect from the
presentation of precise political facts and to yield to the passions of the mob
by raising the bogy of "secret Rome." This was a note which Clemenceau
adopted
only
reluctantly,
though
Jaures
did
with
enthusiasm. The
real
achievement of Zola, which
is hard to detect from his pamphlets,
consists
in the resolute and dauntless courage with which
this man, whose
life and
works had exalted the people to a point "bordering on idolatry," stood up
to challenge, combat, and finally conquer the masses, in whom, like Clemen-
80 It was
precisely
this which

circle around Charles Peguy. This
disturbing
similarity between
Drey-
fusards and Anti-Dreyfusards
is the subject matter of the instructive novel by Martin
du Gard, Jean Barois,
1913.

ccau, he could
all
the
time scarcely distinguish
the mob from
the people.
"Men have been found
to
resist the most powerful monarchs and to refuse
to bow down
before them,
but few indeed have been found
to
resist
the
crowd, to stand up alone before misguided masses, to face their implacable
frenzy without weapons and with folded arms to dare a no when a yes
is
demanded. Such a man was Zola!" "-
Scarcely had J'Accuse appeared when the Paris socialists held their
first
meeting and passed a resolution calling for a revision of the Dreyfus case.
But only live days later some thirty-two socialist officials promptly came out
with a declaration that the fate of Dreyfus, "the class enemy," was no con-
cern of theirs. Behind
this declaration stood large elements of the party
in
Paris. Although
a
split
in
its ranks continued
throughout
the
AlTair,
the
party numbered enough Dreyfusards to prevent the Ligue Antisemite from
thenceforth
controlling
the
streets. A
socialist meeting even branded
anti-
scmitism "a new form of reaction." Yet a few months later when the parlia-
mentary
elections took
place,
Jaures was
not
r.iturned, and
shortly
after-
wards, when Cavaignac, the minister of war, treated the Chamber to a speech
attacking Dreyfus and commending the army as indispensable, the delegates
resolved, with only two dissenting votes, to placard the walls of Paris with
the text of that address. Similarly, when the great Paris strike broke out in
October of the same year, Miinster, the German ambassador, was able re-
liably and confidentially to inform Berlin that "as far as the broad masses
are concerned,
this
is
in no sense a political issue. The workers are simply
out for higher wages and these they are bound to get in the end. As for the
Dreyfus case, they have never bothered their heads about
it." *^
Who then, in broad terms, were the supporters of Dreyfus? Who were the
300,000 Frenchmen who so eagerly devoured Zola's J'Accuse and who fol-
lowed
religiously
the
editorials
of Clemenceau? Who were
the men who
finally succeeded
in
splitting every
class, even every family,
in France into
opposing factions over the Dreyfus
issue? The answer
is
that they formed
no party or homogeneous group. Admittedly they were recruited more from
the lower than from the upper classes, as they comprised, characteristically
enough, more physicians than lawyers or civil servants. By and large, how-
ever, they were a mixture of diverse elements: men as far apart as Zola and
Peguy or Jaures and Picquard, men who on
the morrow would part com-
pany and go
their
several
ways. "They come from
political
parties
and
religious communities who have nothing
in common, who are even in con-
flict with each other.
.
.
. Those men do not know each other. They have
fought and on occasion
will
fight again. Do not deceive yourselves; those
are the 'elite' of the French democracy." «»

fallen prey to that fatal pride which marked the rest of his career. Out of
his experiences in the Dreyfus Affair grew his despair of the people, his con-
tempt for men, finally his belief that he and he alone would be able to save
the republic. He could never stoop
to play the claque to the
antics of the
mob.
Therefore, once he began
to
identify
the mob with
the people, he
did indeed cut the ground from under his feet, and forced himseltf into that
grim aloofness which thereafter distinguished him.
The disunity of the French people was apparent
in each family. Char-
acteristically enough,
it found political expression only
in the ranks of the
Labor party. All others,
as well
as
all parliamentary groups, were
solidly
against Dreyfus
at
the
beginning
of
the campaign
for
a
retrial.
All
this
means, however,
is that the bourgeois parties no longer represented the true
feelings of the electorate, for the same disunity that was so patent among the
socialists obtained among almost all sections of the populace. Everywhere a
minority
existed which
took up
Clemenceau's
plea
for
justice,
and
this
heterogeneous minority made up
the Dreyfusards. Their
fight
against
the
army and the corrupt complicity of the republic which backed
it was
the
dominating factor
in French
internal
politics from
the end of 1897
until
the opening of the Exposition
in
1900.
It
also exerted an appreciable
in-
fluence on the nation's foreign policy. Nevertheless, this entire struggle, which
was to result eventually in at least a partial triumph, took place exclusively
outside of Parliament. In that so-called representative assembly, comprising
as
it did a
full 600 delegates drawn from every shade and color both of
labor and of
the
bourgeoisie,
there were
in
1898
but two supporters
of
Dreyfus and one of them, Jaures, was not re-elected.
The disturbing thing about the Dreyfus Affair
is that
it was not only the
mob which had to work along extraparliamentary lines. The entire minority,
fighting as
it was for Parliament, democracy, and the republic, was likewise
constrained
to wage
its
battle
outside
the Chamber. The
only
difference
between the two elements was that while the one used the streets, the other
resorted to the press and the courts. In other words, the whole of France's
political
life during the Dreyfus
crisis was
carried on outside Parliament.
Nor do the several parliamentary votes in favor of the army and against a
retrial in any way invalidate
this conclusion.
It
is significant
to remember
that when parliamentary feeling began
to turn,
shortly before
the opening
of the Paris Exposition, Minister of War Gallifet was able to declare truth-
fully that this in no wise represented the mood of the country.*^ On the other
hand the vote against a retrial must not be construed as an endorsement of
the coup d'etat policy which the Jesuits and certain radical antisemites were
trying to introduce with the help of the army.®*^ It was due, rather, to plain

minister of war, wrote
to Waldeck:
"Let
us
not
forget
that
the
great
majority of people in France are antisemitic. Our position would be, therefore, that on
the one side we would have the entire army and the majority of Frenchmen, not to
speak of the civil service and the senators;

is that of Deroulede who sought, while attending
the funeral of President Paul Faure,
in February,
1899, to
incite General Roget to

resistance against any change in the status quo. As a matter of fact, an equally
overwhelming
majority
of
the Chamber would have
rejected
a
military-
clerical dictatorship.
Those members of Parliament who had learned to regard politics as the
professional
representation
of
vested
interests
were
naturally
anxious
to
preserve that state of affairs upon which their "calling" and their profits de-
pended. The
Dreyfus
case
revealed,
moreover,
that
the
people
likewise
wanted
their representatives to look after their own special interests rather
than to function as statesmen. It was distinctly unwise to mention the case in
election propaganda. Had
this been due solely to antisemitism the situation
of
the Dreyfusards would
certainly have been
hopeless.
In point
of
fact,
during
the
elections they already enjoyed considerable support among the
working class. Nevertheless even those who sided with Dreyfus did not care
to see
this political question dragged into the elections.
It was, indeed, be-
cause he
insisted on making
it the pivot of his campaign that Jaures
lost
his seat.
If Clemenceau
and
the
Dreyfusards
succeeded
in
winning
over
large
sections of
all classes to the demand of a retrial, the Catholics reacted as a
bloc; among them there was no divergence of opinion. What the Jesuits did
in steering the aristocracy and the General
Staff, was done for the middle
and lower classes by the Assumptionists, whose organ. La Croix, enjoyed
the
largest circulation of
all Catholic journals
in France." Both centered
their agitation against the republic around the Jews. Both represented them-
selves as defenders of the army and the commonweal against the machina-
tions of "international Jewry." More striking, however,
tlian the attitude of
the Catholics in France was the fact that the Catholic press throughout the
world was
solidly against Dreyfus. "All these journalists marched and are
still marching at the word of command of
their superiors." ** As the case
progressed,
it became increasingly clear that the agitation against the Jews
in France followed an international line. Thus the Civilta CattoUca declared
that Jews must be excluded from the nation everywhere, in France, Germany,
Austria, and
Italy. Catholic politicians were among the
first to realize that
latter-day power politics must be based on the interplay of colonial ambi-
tions. They were therefore the
first to link antisemitism to imperialism, de-
claring
that
the
Jews
were
agents
of
England
and
thereby
identifying
antagonism toward them with Anglophobia.^' The Dreyfus case,

Jews were the central figures, thus afforded them a welcome opportunity to
play their game. If England had taken Egypt from the French the Jews were
to blame/" while the movement for an Anglo-American alliance was due,
of course, to "Rothschild imperialism." ®^ That the Catholic game was not
confined to France became abundantly clear once the curtain was rung down
on that particular scene. At the close of 1899, when Dreyfus had been par-
doned and when French public opinion had turned round through fear of a
projected boycott of the Exposition, only an interview with Pope Leo XIII
was needed to stop the spread of antisemitism throughout the world.^^ Even
in the United States, where championship of Dreyfus was particularly en-
thusiastic among the non-Catholics,
it was possible to detect in the Catholic
press after 1897 a marked resurgence of antisemitic feeling which, however,
subsided overnight
following
the
interview with Leo
XIII.^* The "grand
strategy" of using antisemitism as an instrument of Catholicism had proved
abortive.
v:
The Jews and the Dreyfusards
THE CASE of the unfortunate Captain Dreyfus had shown the world that in
every Jewish nobleman and multimillionaire there
still remained something
of the old-time pariah, who has no country, for whom human rights do not
exist, and whom society would gladly exclude from
its privileges. No one,
however, found
it more difficult to grasp this fact than the emancipated Jews
themselves. "It isn't enough for them," wrote Bernard Lazare, "to reject any
solidarity with
their foreign-born brethren; they have
also
to go charging
them with
all the evils which their own cowardice engenders. They are not
content with being more jingoist than the native Frenchmen; like all emanci-
pated Jews everywhere, they have also of their own volition broken
all
ties
of solidarity. Indeed, they go so far that for the three dozen or so men in
France who are ready to defend one of their martyred brethren you can find
some thousands ready
to
stand guard over
Devil's
Island,
alongside
the
most rabid patriots of the country." »* Precisely because they had played so
small a part in the political development of the lands in which they lived,
they had come, during the course of the century, to make a fetish of legal
equality. To them
it was the unquestionable basis of eternal security. When
the Dreyfus Affair broke out to warn them that their security was menaced,
they were deep in the process of a disintegrating assimilation, through which

ANTISEMITISM
their lack
of
poliiical wisdom was
intensified
rather than
otherwise. They
were
rapidly assimilating themselves
to those elements of society
in which
nil political passions are smothered beneath the dead weight of social snob-
hcry,
big
business, and
hitherto unknown
opportunities
for
profit. They
hoped
to get
rid of the antipathy which
this tendency had called
forth by
diverting
it against
their poor and
as yet unassimilatcd immigrant brethren.
Using the same
tactics as Gentile society had employed against them they
took
pains
to dissociate themselves from
the
so-called Ostjuden.
Political
antisemitism,
as
it had
manifested
itself
in
the pogroms
of
Russia and
Rumania, they dismissed airily as a survival from the Middle Ages, scarcely
a reality of modern politics. They could never understand that more was at
stake in the Dreyfus AITair than mere social status, if only because more than
mere social antisemitism had been brought to bear.
These then are the reasons why so few wholehearted supporters of Dreyfus
were to be found in the ranks of French Jewry. The Jews, including the very
family of the accused, shrank from starting a political
fight. On
just these
grounds,
Labori,
counsel
for
Zola,
was
refused
the
defense
before
the
Rcnncs
tribunal, while Dreyfus' second lawyer, Demange, was constrained
to base his plea on the issue of doubt. It was hoped thereby to smother under
a deluge of compliments any possible attack from the army or
its
officers.
The
idea was
that the royal road
to an
acquittal was
to pretend that the
whole thing boiled down to the possibility of a judicial error, the victim of
which just happened by chance to be a Jew. The result was a second verdict
and
Dreyfus,
refusing
to
face
the
true
issue, was induced
to renounce
a
retrial and instead
to petition for clemency,
that
is,
to plead
guilty."'' The
Jews
failed
to see
that what was
involved was an organized
fight
against
them on a political
front. They therefore resisted the co-operation of men
who were prepared to meet the challenge on this basis. How blind their atti-
tude was
is shown clearly by the case of Clemenceau. Clemenceau's struggle
for justice as the foundation of the state certainly embraced the restoration
of equal rights to the Jews. In an age, however, of class struggle on the one
hand and rampant jingoism on the other,
it would have remained a political
abstraction had
it not been conceived,
at the same time, in actual terms of
the oppressed
fighting
their
oppressors. Clemenceau was one
of
the few
true friends modern Jewry has known just because he recognized and pro-
claimed before
the world
that Jews were one of the oppressed peoples of
Europe. The antisemite tends to see in the Jewish parvenu an upstart pariah;
consequently
in every huckster he fears a Rothschild and in every shnorrer
a parvenu. But Clemenceau,
in his consuming passion for justice,
still saw
the Rothschilds as members of a downtrodden people. His anguish over the

VI:
The Pardon and
Its Significance
THAT THE Drcyfus drama was a comedy became apparent only in
its
final
act. The deus ex machina who united the disrupted country, turned Parlia-
ment in favor of a retrial and eventually reconciled the disparate elements
of the people from the extreme right to the socialists, was nothing other than
the Paris Exposition
of
1900. What Clemenceau's
daily
editorials,
Zola's
pathos, Jaures' speeches, and the popular hatred of clergy and aristocracy
had failed to achieve, namely, a change of parliamentary feeling in favor of
Dreyfus, was at last accomplished by the fear of a boycott. The same Parlia-
ment that a year before had unanimously rejected a retrial, now by a two-
thirds majority passed a vote of censure on an anti-Dreyfus government. In
July, 1899, the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet came to power. President Loubct
pardoned Dreyfus and liquidated the entire affair. The Exposition was able
to open under the brightest of commercial skies and general fraternization
ensued: even socialists became eligible for government posts; Millerand, the
first socialist minister in Europe, received the portfolio of commerce.
Parliament became the champion of Dreyfus! That was the upshot. For
Clemenceau, of course,
it was a defeat. To the bitter end he denounced the
ambiguous pardon and the even more ambiguous amnesty. "All it has done,"
wrote Zola,
"is to lump together in a single stinking pardon men of honor
and hoodlums. All have been thrown into one pot." "^ Clemenceau remained,
as at the beginning, utterly alone. The socialists, above
all, Jaures, welcomed
both pardon and amnesty. Did
it not insure them a place in the government
and a more extensive representation of their special interests? A few months
later, in May,
1900, when the success of the Exposition was assured, the
real truth at last emerged. All these appeasement tactics were to be
at the
expense of the Dreyfusards. The motion for a further
retrial was defeated
425 to 60, and not even Clemenceau's own government in 1906 could change
the situation;
it did not dare to entrust the retrial to a normal court of law.
The
(illegal)
acquittal through
the Court of Appeals was a compromise.
But defeat for Clemenceau did not mean
victory for the Church and

army. The separation of Church and State and the ban on parochial educa-
tion
brought
to an end
the
political
influence
of Catholicism
in
France.
Similarly, the subjection of the intelligence service to the ministry of war, i.e.,
to the civil authority, robbed the army of its blackmailing influence on cabinet
and Chamber and deprived
it of any justification for conducting police
in-
quiries on
its own account.
In
1909 Drumont stood
for
the Academy. Once
his
antisemitism had
been lauded by the Catholics and acclaimed by the people. Now, however,
the
"greatest
historian
since
Fustel"
(Lemaitre)
was
obliged
to
yield
to
Marcel
Provost, author of the somewhat pornographic Demi-Vierges, and
the new "immortal" received the congratulations of the
Jesuit Father Du
Lac."' Even the Society of Jesus had composed
its quarrel with the Third
Republic. The close of the Dreyfus case marked the end of clerical
anti-
semitism. The compromise adopted by the Third Republic cleared the de-
fendant without granting him a regular trial, while
it restricted the activities
of Catholic organizations. Whereas Bernard Lazare had asked equal rights
for both sides, the state had allowed one exception for the Jews and another
which threatened the freedom of conscience of Catholics. ^^ The parties which
were really in conflict were both placed outside the law, with the result that
the Jewish question on the one hand and political Catholicism on the other
were banished thenceforth from the arena of practical politics.
Thus
closes
the only
episode
in which
the subterranean
forces
of
the
nineteenth century enter the
full light of recorded history. The only visible
result was
that
it gave
birth
to
the
Zionist movement—the only
political
answer Jews have ever found to antisemitism and the only ideology in which
they have ever taken seriously a hostility that would place them in the center
of world events.

in the Dreyfus Affair
is best described by Charles Peguy, "Notre
Jeunesse,"
in Cahiers de

Paris,
1910. Regarding him as the
true
repre-
sentative of Jewish
interests, Peguy formulates Lazare's demands as follows: "He was
a partisan of the
impartiality of the law. Impartiality of law in the Dreyfus case, im-
partial law
in
the case of the
religious orders. This seems
like a
trifle;
this can
lead
far.

isolation

death."

CHAPTER five:
The Political Emancipation
of the Bourgeoisie
THE THREE DECADES from 1884 to 1914 separate the nineteenth century,
which ended with
the scramble for Africa and the
birth of the pan-
movements, from the twentieth, which began with the first World War. This
is the period of Imperialism, with
its stagnant quiet in Europe and breath-
taking developments in Asia and Africa.^ Some of the fundamental aspects of
this time appear so close to totalitarian phenomena of the twentieth century
that
it may be justifiable
to consider the whole period a preparatory stage
for coming catastrophes.
Its quiet, on the other hand, makes
it appear
still
very much a part of the nineteenth century. We can hardly avoid looking at
this close and yet distant past with the too-wise eyes of those who know the
end of the story in advance, who know
it led to an almost complete break
in the continuous flow of Western history as we had known
it for more than
two thousand years. But we must also admit a certain nostalgia for what can
still be
called
a "golden age of security," for an
age,
that
is, when even
horrors were
still marked by
a
certain moderation and controlled by
re-
spectabiUty, and
therefore could be
related
to
the general appearance
of
sanity. In other words, no matter how close to us this past is, we are perfectly
aware that our experience of concentration camps and death factories
is as
remote from its general atmosphere as
it is from any other period in Western
history.
The central inner-European event of the imperialist period was the po-
litical emancipation of the bourgeoisie, which up to then had been the
first
class^ in history to achieve economic pre-eminence without aspiring to politi-
caljule. The bourgeoisie had developed within, and together with, the nation-
state, which almost by definition ruled over and beyond a class-divided so-
ciety. Even when the bourgeoisie had already established itself as the ruling
class,
it had
left
all pohtical decisions
to the
state. Only when the nation-
state proved unfit to be the framework for the further growth of capitahst
economy did
the
latent
fight between
state and
society become openly a
struggle for power. During the imperialist period neither the state nor the

bourgeoisie won a decisive victory. National institutions resisted throughout
the brutality and megalomania of imperialist aspirations, and bourgeois
at-
tempts to use the state and
its instruments of violence for
its own economic
purposes were always only half successful. This changed when the German
bourgeoisie staked everything on
the
Hitler movement and aspired to rule
with
the help of the mob, but then
it turned out to be too late. The_bour-
gcoisie succeeded
in destroying the nation-state but won a Pyrrhic victory;
the mob proved quite capable of taking care of politics by
itself and liqui-
dated the bourgeoisie along with all other classes and institutions.

Expansion and the Nation-State
"EXPANSION
IS
everything,"
said Cecil Rhodes, and
fell
into
despair,
for
every night he saw overhead "these stars
.
.
.
these vast worlds which we
can never reach.
I would annex the planets
if I could." ^ He had discovered
the moving principle of the new, the imperialist era
(within
less than two
decades,
British colonial possessions increased by AVz
million square miles
and 66
million
inhabitants,
the French nation gained 3Vi
million square
miles and 26 milHon people, the Germans won a new empire of a million
square miles and
1 3 million natives, and Belgium through her king acquired
900,000 square miles with SVi
million population^); and yet in a flash of
wisdom Rhodes recognized at the same moment
its inherent insanity and
its
contradiction to the human condition. Naturally, neither insight nor sadness
changed his policies. He had no use for the flashes of wisdom that led him so
far beyond the normal capacities of an ambitious businessman with a marked
tendency toward megalomania.
"World politics
is for a nation what megalomania
is for an individual," *
said Eugen Richtcr (leader of the German progressive party)
at about the
same historical moment. But his opposition
in the Reichstag to Bismarck's
proposal
to
support
private companies
in
the
foundation
of
trading and
maritime stations, showed clearly that he understood the economic needs of
a nation
in his time even less than Bismarck himself.
It looked as though
those who opposed or ignored imperialism—like Eugen Richter in Germany,
or Gladstone
in England, or Clemenceau
in France—had
lost touch with
reality and did not
realize
that trade and economics had already involved
every nation
in world politics. The national principle was leading into pro-
vincial ignorance and the battle fought by sanity was lost.

THE
POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE
125
Moderation and confusion were the only rewards of any statesman's con-
sistent opposition to imperialist expansion. Thus Bismarck, in 1871, rejected
the offer of French possessions
in Africa in exchange for Alsace-Lorraine,
and twenty years later acquired Heligoland from Great Britain in return for
Uganda, Zanzibar, and Vitu—two kingdoms for a bathtub, as the German
imperialists told him, not without justice. Thus in the eighties Clemenceau
opposed the imperialist party
in France when they wanted to send an ex-
peditionary force to Egypt against the British, and thirty years later he sur-
rendered the Mosul
oil
fields
to England for the sake of a French-British
alUance. Thus Gladstone was being denounced by Cromer in Egypt as "not
a man
to whom
the
destinies
of
the
British
Empire
could
safely
be
entrusted."
That statesmen, who thought primarily
in terms
of the
established na-
tional territory, were suspicious of imperialism was justified enough, except
that more was involved than what they called "overseas adventures." They
knew by instinct rather than by insight that this new expansion movement,
in which "patriotism ...
is best expressed in money-making" (Huebbe-
Schleiden) and the national flag
is a "commercial asset" (Rhodes), could
only destroy the political body of the nation-state. Conquest as well as empire
building had fallen into disrepute for very good reasons. They had been car-
ried out successfully only by governments which, like the Roman Republic,
were based primarily on law, so that conquest could be followed by integra-
tion of the most heterogeneous peoples by imposing upon them a common
law. The
nation-state, however, based upon
a homogeneous
population's
active consent to its government ("/e plebiscite de tous les jours" ^), lacked
such a unifying principle and would, in the case of conquest, have to assimi-
late rather than to integrate, to enforce consent rather than justice, that
is,
to degenerate into tyranny. Robespierre was already well aware of this when
he exclaimed:
"Perissent
les colonies si elles nous en coiitent I'honneur,
la
liberie."
Expansion as a permanent and supreme aim of politics
is the central po-
litical idea of imperialism. Since
it implies neither temporary looting nor the
more lasting assimilation of conquest,
it
is an entirely new concept in the
long history of political thought and action. The reason for
this surprising
originality—surprising because entirely new concepts are very rare in poli-
tics—is simply
that
this concept
is not
really
political
at
all,
but has
its
origin
in
the realm
of business
speculation, where expansion meant
the
permanent broadening of
industrial production and economic transactions
characteristic of the nineteenth century.
In the economic sphere, expansion was an adequate concept because in-
dustrial growth was a working reality. Expansion meant increase in actual
* Ernest Renan in his classical essay Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?,
Paris,
1882,
stressed
"the actual consent, the
desire to
live together, the
will
to preserve worthily the un-
divided inheritance which has been handed down"
as the chief elements which keep
the members of a people together in such a way that they form a nation. Translation

IMPERIALISM
production of goods to be used and consumed. The processes of production
arc
as unlimited
as
the capacity of man
to produce
for,
establish,
furnish,
and improve on
the human world. When production and economic growth
slowed down,
their
limits were not so much economic
as
political,
insofar
as production depended on, and products were shared
by, many
different
peoples who were organized
in widely differing political bodies.
Imperialism was born when the ruling class
in capitalist production came
up against national limitations to
its economic expansion.
The bourgeoisie
turned to polities out of economic necessity; for
if
it did not want to give up
the capitalist system whose inherent law
is constant economic growth,
it had
to impose this law upon
its home governments and to proclaim expansion to
be an ultimate political goal of foreign policy.
With
the slogan "expansion for expansion's sake," the bourgeoisie
tried
and partly succeeded
in persuading their national governments to enter upon
the path of world
politics. The new policy they proposed seemed for a mo-
ment to find
its natural limitations and balances in the very fact that several
nations
started
their
expansions
simultaneously
and
competitively.
Im-
perialism
in
its
initial stages could indeed
still be described as a struggle of
"competing empires" and
distinguished from
the
"idea
of empire
in
the
ancient and medieval world (which) was that of a federation of States, under
a hegemony, covering ...
the entire recognized world."
'^ Yet such a com-
petition was only one of the many remnants of a past era, a concession to
that
still prevailing national principle according to which mankind
is a family
of nations vying for excellence, or to the liberal belief that competition will
automatically
set
up
its own
stabilizing predetermined
limits
before one
competitor has liquidated
all the others. This happy balance, however, had
hardly been
the inevitable outcome of mysterious economic laws, but had
relied
heavily on
political, and even more on
police
institutions
that pre-
vented competitors from using revolvers. How a competition between fully
armed
business concerns—"empires"—could end
in
anything
but
victory
for one and death
for the others
is
difficult to understand. In other words,
competition
is no more
a
principle of
politics
than expansion, and needs
political power just as badly for control and restraint.
In
contrast
to
the economic structure,
the
political
structure cannot be
expanded indefinitely, because
it
is not based upon the productivity of man,
which
is, indeed,
unlimited. Of
all forms of government and organizations
of people,
the nation-state
is
least suited for unlimited growth because the
genuine consent
at
its
base cannot
be
stretched
indefinitely, and
is
only
rarely, and
with
difliculty, won from conquered
peoples. No
nation-state
could
with
a
clear conscience
ever
try
to conquer
foreign
peoples,
since
such a conscience comes only from the conviction of the conquering nation
that
it
is imposing a superior law upon

conceived of
its law as an outgrowth of a unique national substance which
was not valid beyond its own people and the boundaries of
its own territory.
Wherever
the
nation-state appeared
as
conqueror,
it
aroused
national
consciousness
and
desire
for
sovereignty among
the
conquered
people,
thereby defeating
all genuine attempts at empire building. Thus the French
incorporated Algeria
as
a province
of the mother country, but could not
bring themselves to impose their own laws upon an Arab people. They con-
tinued rather to respect Islamic law and granted their Arab citizens "personal
status," producing the nonsensical hybrid of a nominally French
territory,
legally as much a part of France as the Departement de la Seine, whose in-
habitants are not French citizens.
The early British "empire builders," putting their trust
in conquest as a
permanent method
of
rule, were never
able
to
incorporate
their
nearest
neighbors, the Irish, into the far-flung structure either of the British Empire
or the British Commonwealth of Nations; but when, after the last war, Ire-
land was granted dominion status and welcomed
as a full-fledged member
of the British Commonwealth, the failure was just as
real,
if less palpable.
The
oldest
"possession" and
newest dominion
unilaterally denounced
its
dominion status (in 1937) and severed all ties with the English nation when
it refused to participate in the war. England's rule by permanent conquest,
since
it "simply failed to destroy" Ireland
(Chesterton), had not so much
aroused her own "slumbering genius of imperialism" ^ as
it had awakened
the spirit of national resistance in the Irish.
The national structure of the United Kingdom had made quick assimila-
tion and
incorporation
of
the conquered
peoples
impossible;
the
British
Commonwealth was never a "Commonwealth of Nations" but the heir of the
United Kingdom, one nation dispersed throughout the world. Dispersion and
colonization did not expand, but transplanted, the
political
structure, with
the result that the members of the new federated body remained closely tied
to
their common mother country for sound reasons
of common past and
common law. The Irish example proves how
ill fitted the United Kingdom
was to build an imperial structure in which many different peoples could live
contentedly
together.** The
British
nation proved
to be
adept not
at
the
justification of our presence
in Egypt remains based, not upon the defensible right of
conquest, or on force, but upon our own behef
in the element of consent. That
ele-
ment, in
1919, did not
in any articulate form exist.
It was dramatically challenged by
the Egyptian outburst of March
1919."

it, rejoicing over the defeat of Gladstone's
first Home Rule
Bill. During
the
following twenty
years of Conservative—and
that was
at
that time
imperialist—rule
(1885-1905), the
English-Irish
conflict was not only
not solved but
became much more
acute. See

IMPERIALISM
Roman art of empire building but at following the Greek model of coloniza-
tion.
Instead of conquering and imposing their own law upon foreign peo-
ples, the English colonists settled on newly won territory in the four corners
of the world and remained members of the same
British nation. '° Whether
the federated structure of the Commonwealth, admirably built on the reality
of one nation dispersed over the earth, will be sufficiently elastic to balance
the
nation's
inherent
difficulties
in empire
building and
to admit perma-
nently non-British peoples
as
full-fledged "partners
in
the concern" of the
Commonwealth, remains to be seen. The present dominion status of India
a status, by the way, flatly refused by Indian nationalists during the war—has
frequently been considered to be a temporary and transitory solution. ^^
The inner contradiction between the nation's body politic and conquest as
a political device has been obvious since the failure of the Napoleonic dream.
It
is due to this experience and not to humanitarian considerations that con-
quest has since been
officially condemned and has played a minor role
in
the
adjustment
of
borderline
conflicts.
The Napoleonic
failure
to
unite
Europe under
the French
flag was
a
clear
indication
that conquest by
a
nation led either to the
full awakening of the conquered people's national
consciousness
and
to
consequent
rebellion
against
the
conqueror,
or
to
tyranny. And though tyranny, because
it needs no consent, may successfully
rule over foreign peoples,
it can stay in power only
if
it destroys
first of
all
the national institutions of
its own people.
The French,
in contrast to the British and
all other nations in Europe,
nation
as
the French
Revolution became
for
the
French,
the United Kingdom had
already reached
that
stage
of maturity
that
is always accompanied by
a
loss of the
power of assimilation and
integration which
the body
politic of the
nation
possesses
only
in
its
initial
stages. What
then
followed
was,
indeed,
one
long
sad
story
of
"coercion
[that] was
not imposed
that
the people might
live
quietly
but that people
might die
quietly"
(Chesterton, op.
cit.,
p. 60).
For a
historical survey of the
Irish question
that includes the
latest developments,

(in
Longman's Pamphlets on the British Commonwealth, London,

10 Very characteristic
is the following statement of J. A. Froude made shortly before
the beginning of the
imperialist
era:
"Let
it be once established that an Englishman
emigrating
to Canada or the Cape, or Australia, or New Zealand did not
forfeit
his
nationality, that he was
still on English
soil
as much
as
if he was
in Devonshire or
Yorkshire, and would remain an Englishman
while
the
English Empire
lasted; and
if we spent a quarter of the sums which were sunk
in
the morasses
at Balaclava
in
sending out and
establishing two
millions
of our people
in
those
colonies,
it would
contribute more
to
the
essential
strength
of the country than
all
the wars
in which
we have been entangled from Agincourt to Waterloo." Quoted from Robert Livingston
Schuyler, The
Full of the Old Colonial System, New York,
1945,
pp.
280-81.
"The eminent
South
African
writer, Jan
Disselboom, expressed
very
bluntly
the
attitude of the Commonwealth
peoples on
this
question:
"Great
Britain
is merely a
partner
in

all descended from
the same
closely
allied
stock.
.

Those
parts of

actually tried in recent times to combine ius with imperium and to build an
empire in the old Roman sense. They alone at least attempted to develop the
body politic of the nation into an imperial political structure, believed that
"the French nation (was) marching ...
to spread the benefits of French
civilization"; they wanted
to incorporate overseas possessions
into the na-
tional body by treating the conquered peoples as "both
.
.
.
brothers and
,
.
.
subjects—brothers
in the fraternity of a common French civilization,
and
subjects
in
that
they
are
disciples
of French
light and
followers
of
French leading." *^ This was partly carried out when colored delegates took
their seats in the French Parliament and when Algeria was declared to be a
department of France.
The result of this daring enterprise was a particularly brutal exploitation
of overseas possessions for the sake of the nation. All theories to the con-
trary, the French Empire actually was evaluated from the point of view of
national defense, ^^ and the colonies were considered lands of soldiers which
could produce a jorce noire to protect the inhabitants of France against their
national enemies. Poincare's famous phrase in 1923, "France
is not a coun-
try
of forty
millions; she
is
a country of one hundred
millions," pointed
simply to the discovery of an "economical form of gunfodder, turned out by
mass-production methods."
'^ When Clemenceau insisted at the peace table
in 1918 that he cared about nothing but "an unlimited right of levying black
troops to assist in the defense of French territory in Europe
if France were
attacked in the future by Germany," ^^ he did not save
the French nation
from German aggression, as we are now unfortunately in a position to know,
although his plan was carried out by the General Staff; but he dealt a death-
blow to the
still dubious possibihty of a French Empire.^" Compared with

at
brutal
exploitation of overseas possessions
for the sake of
the nation was made by the Netherlands
in the Dutch East Indies
after the defeat of
Napoleon had restored the Dutch colonies to the much impoverished mother country.
By

the

this blind desperate nationalism,
British
imperialists compromising on
the
mandate system looked
like guardians of the self-determination of peoples.
And
this despite the
fact
that they
started
at once
to misuse the mandate
system
by
"indirect
rule,"
a method
which
permits
the
administrator
to
govern
a people "not
directly but through the medium of
their own
tribal
and local authorities." *'
The
British
tried
to escape
the dangerous inconsistency inherent
in
the
nation's attempt at empire building by leaving the conquered peoples to their
own devices as far as culture, religion, and law were concerned, by staying
aloof and
refraining from spreading
British law and culture. This did not
prevent the natives from developing national consciousness and from clamor-
ing
for
sovereignty and
independence—though
it may have
retarded
the
process
somewhat.
But
it
has
strengthened
tremendously
the new
im-
perialist consciousness of a fundamental, and not just a temporary, superi-
ority of man over man, of the "higher" over the "lower breeds." This in turn
exacerbated the subject peoples' fight for freedom and blinded them to the
unquestionable
benefits
of
British
rule. From
the very
aloofness
of
their
administrators who, "despite their genuine respect for the natives as a peo-
ple, and
in some cases even their love for them
.
.
.
almost to a man, do
not believe
that they are or ever
will be capable of governing themselves
without supervision," " the "natives" could not but conclude that they were
being excluded and separated from the rest of mankind forever.
Imperialism
is not empire building and expansion
is not conquest. The
British conquerors,
the old "breakers of law in India" (Burke), had
little
in common with the exporters of British money or the administrators of the
Indian peoples. If the latter had changed from applying decrees to the mak-
ing of laws, they might have become empire builders. The point, however,
is that the English nation was not interested in this and would hardly have
supported them. As
it was,
the imperialist-minded businessmen were
fol-
lowed by civil servants who wanted "the African to be left an African," while
quite a few, who had not yet outgrown what Harold Nicolson once called
came "the admiration of
all colonizing nations."
(Sir Hesketh
Bell, former Governor
of Uganda, Northern Nigeria,
etc., Foreign Colonial Administration
in the Far East,
1928,
Part
I). The
Dutch
methods
have many
similarities
with
the
French:
the
granting of European
status
to deserving
natives, introduction of a European school
system, and other
devices of gradual
assimilation. The Dutch
thereby
achieved
the
same
result:
a strong national independence movement among the subject people.
In
the present study Dutch and Belgian imperialism
are being neglected. The
first
is
a
curious and changing
mixture
of French
and
English
methods;
the
second
is
the story not of the expansion of the Belgian nation or even the Belgian bourgeoisie,
but of the expansion of the Belgian king personally, unchecked by any government,
unconnected
with
any
other
institution.
Both
the
Dutch and
the
Belgian
forms
of
imperialism
are
atypical. The
Netherlands
did
not expand
during
the
eighties,
but
only
consolidated
and
modernized
their
old
possessions. The
unequalled
atrocities
committed in the Belgian Congo, on the other hand, would offer too unfair an example
for what was generally happening
in overseas possessions.

their "boyhood-ideals," *° wanted
to help them to "become a better Afri-
can" ^^—whatever that may mean. In no case were they "disposed to apply
the administrative and political system of their own country to the govern-
ment of backward populations," ^^ and to tie the far-flung possessions of the
British Crown to the English nation.
In contrast to true imperial structures, where the institutions of the mother
country are in various ways integrated into the empire,
it
is characteristic of
imperialism that national institutions remain separate from the colonial ad-
ministration although they are allowed to exercise control. The actual mo-
tivation for this separation was a curious mixture of arrogance and respect:
the new arrogance of the administrators abroad who faced "backward pop-
ulations" or "lower breeds" found
its correlative in the respect of old-fash-
ioned statesmen at home who felt that no nation had the right to impose
its
law upon a foreign people. It was in the very nature of things that the arro-
gance turned out to be a device for rule, while the respect, which remained
entirely negative, did not produce a new way for peoples
to
live
together,
but managed only
to keep
the
ruthless
imperialist
rule by decree
within
bounds. To the salutary restraint of national institutions and politicians we
owe whatever benefits the non-European peoples have been
able,
after
all
and despite everything, to derive from Western domination. But the colonial
services never ceased to protest against the interference of the "inexperienced
majority"—the nation—that tried to press the "experienced minority"—the
imperialist administrators—"in the direction of imitation," -^ namely, of gov-
ernment in accordance with the general standards of justice and liberty
at
home.
That a movement of expansion for expansion's sake grew up in nation-
states which more than any other poHtical bodies were defined by boundaries
and
the limitations of possible conquest,
is one example of the seemingly
absurd disparities between cause and effect which have become the hallmark
of modern history. The wild confusion of modern historical terminology
is
only a by-product of these disparities. By comparisons with ancient Empires,
by mistaking expansion for conquest, by neglecting the difference between
Commonwealth and Empire (which pre-imperialist historians called the dif-
ference between plantations and possessions, or colonies and dependencies,
or, somewhat later, colonialism and imperialism^^), by neglecting, in other

tried
to
dismiss
the
disturbing
fact
that
so
many of the important events
in modern
history look as though molehills
had labored and had brought forth mountains.
Contemporary historians, confronted with the spectacle of a few capitalists
conducting their predatory searches round the globe for new investment pos-
sibilities and appealing
to
the
profit motives of the much-too-rich and the
gambling
instincts
of
the much-too-poor, want
to clothe imperialism with
the old grandeur of Rome and Alexander the Great, a grandeur which would
make
all
following events more humanly
tolerable. The
disparity between
cause and elTect was betrayed in the famous, and unfortunately true, remark
that
the
British Empire was acquired
in
a
fit of absent-mindedness;
it be-
came cruelly obvious in our own time when a World War was needed to get
rid
of
Hitler,
which was
shameful
precisely
because
it was
also
comic.
Something
similar was
already
apparent during
the Dreyfus
Affair when
the best elements in the nation were needed to conclude a struggle which had
started as a grotesque conspiracy and ended as a farce.
The only grandeur of imperialism
lies in the nation's losing battle against
it. The tragedy of
this half-hearted opposition was not that many national
representatives could be bought by the new imperialist businessmen; worse
than corruption was the fact that the incorruptible were convinced that im-
perialism was the only way to conduct world politics. Since maritime stations
and access to raw materials were really necessary for all nations, they came
to believe
that annexation and expansion worked for the
salvation of the
nation. They were the
first to fail to understand the fundamental difference
between
the old foundation of trade and maritime stations for the sake of
trade and the new policy of expansion. They believed Cecil Rhodes when
he
told them to "wake up to the fact that you cannot live unless you have
the trade of the world," "that your trade
is the world, and your
life
is the
world, and not England," and
that
therefore
they "must deal with
these
questions of expansion and retention of the world." -^ Without wanting
to,
sometimes even without knowing
it, they not only became accomplices
in
imperialist
politics, but were
the
first
to be blamed and exposed for
their
"imperialism." Such was the case of Clemenceau who, because he was so
desperately
worried
about
the
future
of
the French
nation,
turned
"ira-
insofar as
the colony was "formed of the
British people or
.
.
. such admixture
of
the
British population
as to make
it safe
to introduce representative
institutions." See
Robert Livingston Schuyler, op.
cil., pp. 236 ff.
In
the
nineteenth
century, we must
distinguish
three types of overseas possessions
within
the

Empire:
the
settlements or
plantations
or
colonies,
like
Australia
and other dominions; the trade stations and possessions
like
India; and the maritime
and
military
stations
like
the Cape of Good Hope, which were held
for
the sake of
the
former.
All
these
possessions

in government
and

against aggressors.
The conscience of the nation, represented by Parliament and a free press,
functioned, and was
resented by
colonial
administrators,
in
all European
countries
with
colonial
possessions—whether
England,
France,
Belgium,
Germany, or Holland. In England,
in order to distinguish between the im-
perial government seated
in London and controlled by Parliament and co-
lonial administrators, this influence was called the "imperial factor," thereby
crediting imperialism with the merits and remnants of justice
it so eagerly
tried to eliminate.^" The "imperial factor" was expressed
politically
in the
concept that the natives were not only protected but in a way represented
by
the
British,
the "Imperial Parliament." ^' Here
the English came very
close to the French experiment in empire building, although they never went
so far as to give actual representation to subject peoples. Nevertheless, they
obviously hoped that the nation as a whole could
act as a kind of trustee
for
its conquered peoples, and
it
is true that
it invariably
tried
its best to
prevent the worst.
The conflict between the representatives of the "imperial factor" (which
should rather be called the national factor) and the colonial administrators
runs
like
a
red
thread
through
the
history
of
British
imperialism. The
"prayer" which Cromer addressed
to Lord
Salisbury
during
his
adminis-
tration of Egypt in 1896, "save me from the English Departments,""^^ was
repeated over and over again, until in the twenties of this century the nation
and everything
it stood for were openly blamed by the extreme imperialist
party
for
the threatened
loss
of
India. The
imperialists had always been
deeply resentful that the government of India should have "to justify
its ex-
istence and
its policy before public opinion
in England";
this control now
made
it impossible
to proceed
to those measures
of "administrative mas-
26 The origin of this misnomer probably
lies
in the history of British rule
in South
Africa,
and
goes
back
to
the
times when
the
local

Cecil
Rhodes
and
Jameson, involved the "Imperial Government"
in London, much against
its intentions,
in the war against the Boers. "In
fact Rhodes, or rather Jameson, was absolute
ruler
of a

three times the
size of England, which could be administered
'without

was the

Africa.
In
1897, Carl
Peters was removed
from his post
in German Southeast Africa and had to resign from the gov-
ernment
service because
of
atrocities
against
the
natives. The same
thing
happened to Governor Zimmerer. And in 1905, the tribal chiefs for the first
time addressed their complaints to the Reichstag, with the result that when
the colonial administrators threw them
into
jail,
the German Government
intervened.^'
The same was true of French
rule. The governors general appointed by
the
government
in
Paris
were
either
subject
to
powerful
pressure from
French colonials as in Algeria, or simply refused to carry out reforms in the
treatment of natives, which were allegedly inspired by "the weak democratic
principles of
(their) government." ^^ Everywhere imperialist administrators
felt that the control of the nation was an unbearable burden and threat to
domination.
And
the
imperialists were perfectly
right. They knew
the conditions of
modern
rule over subject peoples better than those who on
the one hand
protested against government by decree and arbitrary bureaucracy and on
the other hoped
to retain
their possessions forever for the greater glory of
the
nation. The
imperialists knew
better than
nationalists
that
the body
politic of the nation
is not capable of empire building. They were perfectly
aware that the march of the nation and
its conquest of peoples,
if allowed
to follow its own inherent law, ends with the peoples' rise to nationhood and
the defeat of the conqueror. French methods, therefore, which always
tried
to combine national aspirations with empire building, were much less suc-
cessful than
British methods, which,
after the eighties of the
last century,
were
openly
imperialistic,
although
restrained
by
a mother
country
that
retained
its national democratic institutions.

THE POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE
135
II:
Power and the Bourgeoisie
WHAT IMPERIALISTS actually wanted was expansion of political power with-
out the foundation of a body politic. Imperialist expansion had been touched
off by a curious kind of economic crisis, the overproduction of capital and
the emergence of "superfluous" money, the result of oversaving, which could
no longer find productive investment within the national borders. For the
first time, investment of power did not pave the way for investment of money,
but export of power followed meekly in the train of exported money, since
uncontrollable investments in distant countries threatened to transform large
strata of society into gamblers, to change the whole capitalist economy from
a system of production into a system of financial speculation, and to replace
the profits of production with profits in commissions. The decade immedi-
ately before the imperialist era, the seventies of the
last century, witnessed
an unparalleled increase in swindles, financial scandals, and gambling in the
stock market.
The pioneers in this pre-imperialist development were those Jewish finan-
ciers who had earned their wealth outside the capitalist system and had been
needed by the growing nation-states for internationally guaranteed loans. *^
With the firm establishment of the tax system that provided for sounder gov-
ernment finances,
this group had every reason to fear complete extinction.
Having earned
their money for centuries through commissions,
they were
naturally
the
first to be tempted and
invited
to serve
in the placement of
capital which could no longer be invested profitably in the domestic market.
The Jewish international financiers seemed indeed especially suited for such
essentially
international
business
operations.^* What
is more,
the govern-
ments themselves, whose assistance in some form was needed for investments
in faraway
countries,
tended
in
the
beginning
to
prefer
the well-known

3* It
is
interesting
that
all
early
observers
of
imperialist developments
stress
this
Jewish element very strongly while
it hardly plays any
role
in more recent
literature.
Especially
noteworthy,
because
very
reliable
in
observation
and
very
honest
in
analysis,
is
J. A. Hobson's development
in
this
respect.
In
the
first
essay which he
wrote on the subject, "Capitalism and Imperialism in South Africa"
(in Contemporary
Review,
1900), he
said: "Most of
(the
financiers)
were Jews,
for
the Jews
are par
excellence
the
international
financiers,
and,
though
English-speaking,
most
of them
are of
continental
origin.
.
.
. They went
there
(Transvaal)
for money, and
those
who came early and made most have commonly withdrawn their persons, leaving their
economic fangs
in the carcass of their prey. They fastened on the Rand ...
as they
are prepared to fasten upon any other spot upon the globe.
.
.
.
Primarily, they
are
financial speculators taking their gains not out of the genuine
fruits of industry, even
the industry of others, but out of construction, promotion and
financial manipulation
of companies." In Hobson's
later study Imperialism, however, the Jews
are
not even
mentioned;
it had become obvious
in the meantime that
their influence and
role had
been temporary and somewhat
superficial.

role of Jewish
financiers

IMPERIALISM
Jew ish financiers to newcomers in international finance, many of whom were
adventurers.
After
the
financiers had opened
the
channels
of
capital export
to
the
superfluous wealth, which had been condemned to idleness within the nar-
row framework of national production,
it quickly became apparent that the
absentee shareholders did not care to take the tremendous risks which cor-
responded
to
their tremendously enlarged
profits. Against these
risks,
the
commission-earning
financiers, even
with
the benevolent assistance
of the
state, did not have enough power to insure them: only the material power of
a state could do that.
As soon as
it became clear that export of money would have to be fol-
lowed by export of government power, the position of financiers in general,
and
Jewish
financiers
in
particular, was
considerably weakened, and
the
leadership of imperialist business transactions and enterprise was gradually
taken over by members of the native bourgeoisie. Very instructive
in
this
respect is the career of Cecil Rhodes in South Africa, who, an absolute new-
comer,
in a few years could supplant the all-powerful Jewish financiers in
first
place.
In Germany,
Bleichroeder, who
in
1885 had
still been
a co-
partner in the founding of the Ostafrikanische Gesellschajt, was superseded
along
with Baron
Hirsch when Germany began
the
construction
of
the
Bagdad
railroad, fourteen years
later, by
the coming giants of imperialist
enterprise, Siemens and the Deutsche Bank. Somehow the government's re-
luctance to yield real power to Jews and the Jews' reluctance to engage in
business with
political implication coincided so well
that, despite the great
wealth
of
the Jewish group, no
actual
struggle
for power ever developed
after
the
initial
stage
of gambling and commission-earning had come
to
an end.
The various national governments looked with misgiving upon the grow-
ing tendency to transform business into a political issue and to identify the
economic interests of a relatively small group with national interests as such.
But
it seemed that the only alternative to export of power was the dehberate
sacrifice of a great part of the national wealth. Only through the expansion
of the national instruments of violence could the foreign-investment move-
ment be
rationalized, and
the
wild
speculations
with
superfluous
capital,
which had provoked gambling of
all savings, be reintegrated into the eco-
nomic system of the nation. The state expanded its power because, given the
choice between greater losses than the economic body of any country could
sustain and greater gains than any people left to its own devices would have
dreamed of,
it could only choose the latter.
The
first consequence of power export was that the state's instruments of
violence,
the police and
the army, which
in
the framework of the nation
existed
beside,
and were
controlled
by,
other
national
institutions,
were
separated from
this body and promoted to the position of national repre-
sentatives in uncivilized or weak countries. Here, in backward regions with-
out
industries and
political
organization, where
violence was
given more
latitude than in any Western country, the so-called laws of capitalism were

THE
POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE
137
actually allowed to create
realities. The bourgeoisie's empty desire to have
money beget money as men beget men had remained an ugly dream so long
as money had to go the long way of investment
in production; not money
had begotten money, but men had made things and money. The secret of
the new happy fulfillment was precisely that economic laws no longer stood
in the way of the greed of the owning classes. Money could
finally beget
money because power, with complete disregard for
all laws—economic as
well as ethical—could appropriate wealth. Only when exported money suc-
ceeded in stimulating the export of power could
it accomplish
its owners'
designs. Only the unlimited accumulation of power could bring about the
unHmited accumulation of capital.
Foreign investments,
capital export which had started
as an emergency
measure, became a permanent feature of all economic systems as soon as
it
was protected by export of power. The
imperialist concept of expansion,
according
to which
expansion
is
an
end
in
itself and
not
a
temporary
means, made its appearance in political thought when
it had become obvious
that one
of
the most
important permanent functions
of
the
nation-state
would be expansion
of power. The state-employed administrators
of
vio-
lence soon formed a new class within the nations and, although their field of
activity was far away from the mother country, wielded an important influ-
ence on
the body
politic
at home.
Since
they were
actually nothing but
functionaries of violence they could only think
in terms of power politics.
They were the first who, as a class and supported by their everyday experi-
ence, would claim that power is the essence of every political structure.
The new feature of
this
imperialist
political philosophy
is not the pre-*/
dom inant place
it gave violence, nor the discovery that power
is one of the
^
basic
political
realities. Violence has always been the ultima
ratio
in po-
litical action and power has always been the visible expression of rule and
government. Butjierther had ever before been the conscious aim of the body
politic or the ultimate goal of any definite policy. For power left to itself can
achieve nothing but more power, and violence administered for power's (and
not for law's) sake turns into a destructive principle that will not stop until
there
is nothing left to
violate.
This contradiction, inherent in
all ensuing power politics, however, takes
on an appearance of sense
if one understands
it in the context of a sup-
posedly permanent process which has no end or aim but
itself. Then
the
test
of achievement can
indeed become
meaningless
and power can
be
thought
of
as
the never-ending,
self-feeding motor
of
all
political
action
that corresponds
to
the legendary unending accumulation
of money
that
begets money. The concept of unlimited expansion that alone can
fulfill the
hope for unlimited accumulation of
capital, and brings about the
aimless
accumulation
of power, makes
the foundation
of new
political
bodies
which up to the era of imperialism always had been the upshot of conquest
well-nigh impossible. In fact,
its logical consequence
is the destruction of all
living communities, those of the conquered peoples as well as of the people
at home. For every
political
structure, new or
old,
left
to
itself develops

Stabilizing forces which stand in the way of constant transformation and ex-
pansion/'! hcrcforc
all
political
bodies
appear
to be
temporary
obstacles
when they are seen as part of an eternal stream of growing power.
While the administrators of permanently increasing power in the past era
of moderate
imperialism
did not even
try
to
incorporate conquered
terri-
tories, and
preserved
existing backward
political communities
like empty
ruins of bygone
life, their totalitarian successors dissolved and destroyed
all
politically
stabilized structures, their own as well as those of other peoples.
The mere export of violence made the servants into masters without giving
them
the
master's
prerogative:
the
possible
creation
of something
new.
Monopolistic
concentration
and
tremendous
accumulation
of
violence
at
home made the servants active agents
in the destruction, until finally
totali-
tarian expansion became a nation- and a people-destroying force.
Power became
the essence of political action and the center of political
thought when
it was separated from the political community which
it should
serve. This,
it
is true, was brought about by an economic factor. But the re-
sulting introduction of power as the only content of politics, and of expansion
as
its only aim, would hardly have met with such universal applause, nor
would
the
resulting dissolution of the nation's body politic have met with
so
little opposition, had
it not so perfectly answered the hidden desires and
secret convictions
of the economically and
socially dominant
classes. The
bourgeoisie, so long excluded from government by the nation-state and by
their own lack of interest
in public
aflairs, was
politically emancipated by
imperialism.
Imperialism must be considered
the
first
stage
in
political
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie rather than the
last stage of capitalism.
It
is well known how
little the owning classes had aspired to government, how well contented they
had been with every type of state that could be trusted with protection of
property
rights. For them, indeed,
the
state had always been only a well-
organized police force. This false modesty, however, had the curious conse-
quence of keeping the whole bourgeois class out of the body poHtic; before
they
were
subjects
in
a monarchy
or
citizens
in
a
republic,
they
were
essentially
private
persons.
This
privateness
and
primary
concern
with
money-making had developed a set of behavior patterns which are expressed
in
all
those
proverbs—"nothing succeeds
like
success,"
"might
is
right,"
"right
is expediency," etc.—that necessarily spring from the experience of a
society of competitors.
When, in the era of imperialism, businessmen became politicians and were
acclaimed
as statesmen, while statesmen were taken seriously only
if they
talked the language of successful businessmen and "thought in continents,"
these
private
practices and
devices were gradually transformed
into
rules
and principles for the conduct of public
affairs. The
significant fact about
this process of revaluation, which began at the end of the last century and is
still
in
effect,
is that
it began with the application of bourgeois convictions
to foreign affairs and only slowly was extended to domestic politics. There-
fore, the nations concerned were hardly aware that the recklessness that had

THE
POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE
139
prevailed in private
life, and against which the public body always had to
defend itself and
its individual citizens, was about to be elevated to the one
publicly honored political principle.
It
is
significant that modern
believers
in power are
in complete accord
with the philosophy of the only great thinker who ever attempted to derive
public good from private
interest and who,
for the sake of private good,
conceived and outhned a Commonwealth whose
basis and ultimate end
is
accumulation of power. Hobbes,
indeed,
is
the only
great philosopher
to
whom the bourgeoisie can rightly and exclusively lay claim, even
if his prin-
ciples were not recognized by the bourgeois class for a long time. Hobbes's
Leviathan
^^•' exposed the only political theory according to which the
state
is based not on some kind of constituting law—whether divine law, the law
of nature, or the law of social contract—which determines
the
rights and
wrongs of the individual's interest with respect to public
affairs, but on the
individual interests themselves, so that "the private interest
is the same with
the publique."
^'^
There
is hardly a single bourgeois moral standard which has not been an-
ticipated by
the unequaled
magnificence
of Hobbes's
logic. He
gives an
almost complete picture, not of Man but of the bourgeois man, an analysis
which in three hundred years has neither been outdated nor excelled. "Rea-
son ...
is
nothing
but Reckoning";
"a
free
Subject,
a
free
Will
.
.
.
[are] words
.
.
.
without meaning; that
is to say. Absurd." A being with-
out reason, without the capacity for
truth, and without free
will—that
is,
without
the
capacity
for
responsibility—man
is
essentially
a
function
of
society and judged
therefore
according
to
his
"value
or worth ...
his
price; that
is to say so much as would be given for the use of his power."
This price is constantly evaluated and re-evaluated by society, the "esteem of
others," depending upon the law of supply and demand.
Power, according to Hobbes,
is the accumulated control that permits the
individual to fix prices and regulate supply and demand in such a way that
they contribute to his own advantage. The individual will consider his ad-
vantage
in complete
isolation, from
the point of view of an absolute mi-
nority, so to speak; he will then realize that he can pursue and achieve his
interest only with the help of some kind of majority. Therefore,
if man
is
actually driven by nothing but his individual interests, desire for power must
be the fundamental passion of man.
It regulates the relations between indi-
vidual and society, and
all other ambitions as
well, for riches, knowledge,
and honor follow from
it.

enough
(see chapter
xii). However, one
should
not overlook
the
fact
that Hobbes
wanted most of
all to protect private
interests by pretending
that, rightly understood,
they were the
interests of the body politic
as well, while on the contrary totalitarian
regimes proclaim
the

IMPERIALISM
Hobbcs points out
that
in
the struggle for power, as
in
their native ca-
pacities for power, all men are equal; for the equality of men
is based on the
fact that each has by nature enough power to
kill another. Weakness can be
compensated
for by
guile. Their equality as potential murderers places
all
men
in
the same
insecurity, from which
arises
the need
for a
state. The
raisori d'etre of the state
is the need for some security of the individual, who
feels himself menaced by
all his fellow-men.
The crucial feature
in Hobbes's picture of man
is not at
all the
realistic
pessimism for which
it has been praised
in recent times. For
if
it were true
that man
is a being such as Hobbes would have him, he would be unable to
found any body
politic
at
all. Hobbes, indeed, does not succeed, and does
not even want
to succeed,
in incorporating
this being definitely into a po-
litical community. Hobbes's Man owes no loyalty
to his country
if
it has
been defeated and he
is excused
for every treachery
if he happens
to be
taken
prisoner. Those who
live outside
the Commonwealth
(for
instance,
slaves ) have no further obligation toward their fellow-men but are permitted
to
kill as many as they can; while, on the contrary, "to resist the Sword of
the Commonwealth
in defence of another man, guilty or innocent, no man
hath Liberty," which means
that there
is
neither fellowship nor responsi-
bility between man and man. What holds them together
is a common
in-
terest which may be "some Capitall crime, for which every one of them ex-
pecteth death";
in
this case they have the right to "resist the Sword of the
Commonwealth," to "joyn together, and assist, and defend one another.
.
.
.
For they but defend their lives."
Thus membership in any form of community
is for Hobbes a temporary
and limited affair which essentially does not change the solitary and private
character of the individual (who has "no pleasure, but on the contrary a
great deale of griefe in keeping company, where there
is no power to over-
awe them all") or create permanent bonds between him and his fellow-men.
It seems
as though Hobbes's picture of man
defeats
his purpose
of pro-
viding the basis for a Commonwealth and gives instead a consistent pattern
of
attitudes
through
which
every
genuine community
can
easily
be
de-
stroyed. This
results
in
the
inherent and admitted
instability
of Hobbes's
Commonwealth, whose very conception includes its own dissolution—"when
in a warre (forraign, or intestine,) the enemies get a final Victory
.
.
.
then
is the Commonwealth dissolved, and every man
at liberty to protect him-
selfe"—an instability that
is
all the more striking as Hobbes's primary and
frequently repeated aim was to secure a maximum of safety and stability.
It would be a grave injustice to Hobbes and his dignity as a philosopher
to consider this picture of man an attempt at psychological realism or philo-
sophical truth. The fact is that Hobbes is interested in neither, but concerned
exclusively with the political structure
itself, and he depicts the features of
man according to the needs of the Leviathan. For argument's and convic-
tion's
sake, he presents
his
political
outline
as though he
started from a
realistic insight into man, a being that "desires power after power," and as
though he proceeded from
this
insight
to
a plan
for a body
politic

fitted
for
this
power-thirsty
animal.
The
actual
process,
i.e.,
the
only
process
in which
his concept of man makes
sense and goes beyond
the
obvious banality of an assumed human wickedness,
is precisely the opposite.
This new body poUtic was conceived for the benefit of the new bourgeois
society as
it emerged in the seventeenth century and this picture of man
is a
sketch for the new type of Man who would
fit into
it. The Commonwealth
is
based on the delegation of power, and not of rights.
It acquires a monopoly
on killing and provides
in exchange a conditional guarantee against being
killed. Security
is provided by the law, which
is a direct emanation from the
power monopoly of the state (and
is not established by man according to
human standards of right and wrong). And as
this law flows directly from
absolute power,
it represents absolute necessity in the eyes of the individual
who lives under it. In regard to the law of the state—that is, the accumulated
power of society as monopolized by the state—there
is no question of right
or wrong, but only absolute obedience, the blind conformism of bourgeois
society.
Deprived of political
rights,
the
individual,
to whom public and
official
life manifests
itself in the guise of necessity, acquires a new and increased
interest in his private life and his personal fate. Excluded from participation
in the management of public
affairs that involve
all citizens, the individual
loses his rightful place in society and his natural connection with his fellow-
men. He can now judge his individual private
life only by comparing
it with
that of others, and his relations with his fellow-men inside society take the
form of competition. Once public
affairs are regulated by
the
state under
the guise of necessity, the social or public careers of the competitors come
under the sway of chance. In a society of individuals,
all equipped by nature
with equal capacity for power and equally protected from one another by
the state, only chance can decide who will succeed."
According to bourgeois standards, those who are completely unlucky and
unsuccessful are automatically barred from competition, which
is the life of
society. Good fortune
is identified with honor, and bad luck with shame. By
assigning
his
political
rights
to
the
state
the
individual
also
delegates
his
social responsibiUties to
it: he asks the state to relieve him of the burden of
8^ The elevation of chance to the position of final arbiter over the whole of life was
to reach
its
full development in the nineteenth century. With
it came a new genre of
literature, the novel, and the decline of the drama. For the drama became meaning-
less in a world without action, while the novel could deal adequately with the destinies
of human beings who were
either
the
victims of necessity or
the
favorites
of
luck.
Balzac showed the full range of the new genre and even presented human passions as
man's
fate, containing
neither virtue nor
vice, neither reason nor
free
will. Only the
novel
in
its
full
maturity,
having
interpreted and
re-interpreted
the
entire
scale
of
human matters, could preach the new gospel of infatuation with one's own
fate
that
has played
such
a
great
role among
nineteenth-century
intellectuals.
By
means
of
such
infatuation
the
artist and
intellectual
tried
to draw
a
line between
themselves
and
the
philistines,
to
protect
themselves
against
the
inhumanity
of
good
or bad
luck, and they developed
all the gifts of modern
sensitivity—for suffering, for under-
standing, for playing a prescribed
role—which
are so desperately needed by human
dignity, which demands of a man that ho at least be a willing victim
if nothing else.

]42
IMPERIALISM
caring for the poor precisely as he asks for protection against criminals. The
difference
between
pauper
and
criminal
disappears—both
stand
outside
society. The unsuccessful are robbed of the virtue that classical civilization
left them; the unfortunate can no longer appeal to Christian charity.
Hobbes liberates those who are excluded from society—the unsuccessful,
the unfortunate, the criminal—from every obligation toward society and state
if the state does not take care of them. They may give free rein to their de-
sire for power and are told to take advantage of their elemental
ability to
kill, thus restoring that natural equahty which society conceals only for the
sake of expediency. Hobbes foresees and justifies the social outcasts' organi-
zation
into a gang of murderers as a logical outcome of the bourgeoisie's
moral philosophy.
Since power
is
essentially only a means
to an end a community based
solely on power must decay in the calm of order and stability;
its complete
security reveals that
it is built on sand. Only by acquiring more power can
it
guarantee the status quo; only by constantly extending its authority and only
through the process of power accumulation can
it remain
stable. Hobbes's
Commonwealth
is a vacillating structure and must always provide itself with
new props from the outside; otherwise
it would collapse overnight into the
aimless, senseless chaos of the private interests from which
it sprang. Hobbes
embodies the necessity of power accumulation in the theory of the state of
nature,
the
"condition
of perpetual war"
of
all
against
all,
in which
the
various

states

other
like
their
individual
subjects before they submitted to the authority of a Commonwealth.^* This
ever-present possibility of war guarantees the Commonwealth a prospect of
permanence because
it makes
it possible for the state to increase
its power
at the expense of other states.
It would be erroneous to take at its face value the obvious inconsistency
between Hobbes's plea
for security of the
individual and
the inherent
in-
stability of his Commonwealth. Here again he
tries
to persuade,
to appeal
to certain basic instincts for security which he knew well enough could sur-
vive in the subjects of the Leviathan only in the form of absolute submission
to the power which "over-awes them all," that
is, in an all-pervading, over-
whelming fear—not exactly the basic sentiment of a safe man. What Hobbes
actually
starts from
is an unmatched insight into the political needs of the
new social body of the
rising bourgeoisie, whose fundamental belief in an
unending process of property accumulation was about to eliminate
all indi-
vidual safety. Hobbes drew the necessary conclusions from social and eco-
nomic
behavior
patterns when he proposed
his
revolutionary changes
in

constitution. He outlined
the only new body
politic which could

place of individuals. The World Government

correspond to the new needs and interests of a new class. What he actually
achieved was a picture of man as he ought to become and ought to behave
if he wanted to
fit into the coming bourgeois society.
Hobbes's insistence on power as the motor of all things human and divine
(even God's reign over men
is "derived not from Creating them
.
.
. but
from
the
Irresistible Power")
sprang from
the
theoretically
indisputable
proposition that a never-ending accumulation of property must be based on
a never-ending accumulation of power. The philosophical correlative of the
inherent instability of a community founded on power
is the image of an
endless process of history which, in order to be consistent with the constant
growth
of
power,
inexorably
catches
up
with
individuals,
peoples,
and
finally
all mankind. The limitless process of capital accumulation needs the
political structure
of so "unlimited a Power"
that
it can protect growing
property by constantly growing more powerful. Granted
the fundamental
dynamism of the new social class,
it
is perfectly true that "he cannot assure
the power and means
to
live
well, which he hath
at present, without the
acquisition of more." The consistency of this conclusion is in no way altered
by the remarkable fact that for some three hundred years there was neither
a sovereign who would "convert this Truth of Speculation into the Utility of
Practice," nor a bourgeoisie
politically conscious and economically mature
enough openly to adopt Hobbes's philosopny of power.
This process
of never-ending accumulation of power necessary for the
protection of a never-ending accumulation of capital determined the "pro-
gressive" ideology of the late nineteenth century and foreshadowed the rise
of imperialism. Not the naive delusion of a limitless growth of property, but
the realization that power accumulation was the only guarantee for the sta-
bility of so-called economic laws, made progress irresistible. The eighteenth-
century notion
of progress,
as conceived
in pre-revolutionary France,
in-
tended criticism of the past to be a means of mastering the present and con-
trolling
the
future; progress culminated
in
the emancipation
of man. But
this notion had
little to do with the endless progress of bourgeois
society,
which not only did not want the liberty and autonomy of man, but was ready
to
sacrifice everything and everybody
to supposedly superhuman
laws
of
history. "What we call progress
is
[the] wind
.
.
.
[that] drives
[the angel
of history] irresistibly into the future to which he turns his back while the
pile of ruins before him towers to the skies." ^° Only in Marx's dream of a
classless society which, in Joyce's words, was to awaken mankind from the
nightmare of history, does a
last, though Utopian,
trace of the eighteenth-
century concept appear.

J44
IMPERIALISM
The imperialist-minded businessman, whom the stars annoyed because he
could not annex them, realized that power organized for its own sake would
beget more power. When the accumulation of capital had reached its natural,
national limits, the bourgeoisie understood that only with an "expansion
is
everything"
ideology, and only
with
a corresponding power-accumulating
process, would
it be possible to set the old motor into motion again. At the
same moment, however, when
it seemed as though the true principle of per-
petual motion had been discovered, the specifically optimistic mood of the
progress ideology was shaken. Not that anybody began to doubt the
irre-
sistibility
of
the
process
itself,
but many people began
to
see what had
frightened Cecil Rhodes:
that the human condition and the limitations of
the globe were a serious obstacle to a process that was unable to stop and
to
stabilize, and could
therefore only begin a
series
of destructive
catas-
trophes once it had reached these limits.
In the imperialistic epoch a philosophy of power became the philosophy
of the elite, who quickly discovered and were quite ready to admit that the
thirst for power could be quenched only through destruction. This was the
essential cause
of
their nihilism
(especially conspicuous
in France
at
the
turn, and in Germany
in the twenties, of this century) which replaced the
superstition of progress with
the equally vulgar superstition of doom, and
preached automatic annihilation with the same enthusiasm that the fanatics
of automatic progress had preached the
irresistibility of economic laws.
It
had taken Hobbes, the great idolator of Success, three centuries to succeed.
This was partly because the French Revolution, with its conception of man as
lawmaker and citoyen, had almost succeeded in preventing the bourgeoisie
from
fully developing
its notion of history
as
a necessary
process. But
it
was also partly because of the revolutionary implications of the Common-
wealth,
its fearless breach with Western tradition, which Hobbes did not fail
to point out.
Every man and every thought which does not serve and does not conform
to the ultimate purpose of a machine whose only purpose
is the generation
and accumulation of power is a dangerous nuisance. Hobbes judged that the
books of
the
"ancient Greeks and Romans" were
as
"prejudicial"
as
the
teaching of a Christian "Summum bonum ...
as
[it]
is spoken of in the
Books of the old Morall Philosophers" or the doctrine that "whatsoever a
man does against his Conscience,
is Sinne" and that "Lawes are the Rules of
Just and Unjust." Hobbes's deep distrust of the whole Western tradition of
political thought will not surprise us
if we remember that he wanted nothing
more nor less than the justification of Tyranny which, though
it has occurred
many times in Western history, has never been honored with a philosophical
foundation. That
the Leviathan
actually amounts
to a permanent govern-
ment of tyranny, Hobbes
is proud to admit:
"the name of Tyranny
signi-
fieth nothing more nor lesse than the name of Soveraignty
.
.
.
; I think the
toleration of
a professed hatred of Tyranny,
is a Toleration of hatred
to
Commonwealth in generall.
.
.
."
Since Hobbes was a philosopher, he could already detect in the rise of the

THE
POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE
145
bourgeoisie all those antitraditionalist qualities of the new class which would
take more than three hundred years to develop fully. His Leviathan was not
concerned with
idle
speculation about new
political
principles or the old
search for reason
as
it governs
the community
of men;
it was
strictly a
"reckoning of the consequences" that follow from the rise of a new class in
society whose existence
is essentially
tied up with property
as a dynamic,
new property-producing device. The so-called accumulation of capital which
gave birth to the bourgeoisie changed the very conception of property and
wealth : they were no longer considered to be the results of accumulation and
acquisition but their beginnings; wealth became a never-ending process of
getting wealthier. The
classification of the bourgeoisie
as an owning
class
is only superficially correct, for a characteristic of this class has been that
everybody could belong
to
it who conceived of
life
as
a process
of per-
petually becoming wealthier, and considered money as something sacrosanct
which
under no
circumstances
should
be
a mere
commodity
for
con-
sumption.
Property by itself, however,
is subject to use and consumption and there-
fore diminishes constantly. The most radical and the only secure form of
possession is destruction, for only what we have destroyed
is safely and for-
ever ours. Property owners who do not consume but strive to enlarge their
holdings continually find one very inconvenient limitation, the unfortunate
fact that men must die. Death is the real reason why property and acquisition
can never become a true political principle. A social system based essentially
on property cannot possibly proceed toward anything but the final destruc-
tion of
all property. The finiteness of personal life
is as serious a challenge
to property as the foundation of society, as the Umits of the globe are a chal-
lenge to expansion as the foundation of the body politic. By transcending the
limits
of human
life
in planning
for an automatic continuous growth
of
wealth beyond
all personal needs and
possibilities
of consumption,
indi-
vidual property is made a public affair and taken out of the sphere of mere
private
life. Private interests which by their very nature are temporary, lim-
ited by man's natural span of life, can now escape into the sphere of pubUc
affairs and borrow from them that
infinite length of time which
is needed
for continuous accumulation. This seems to create a society very similar to
that of the ants and bees where "the Common good differeth not from the
Private; and being by nature enclined to their private, they procure thereby
the common benefit."
Since, however, men are neither ants nor bees, the whole thing
is a delu-
sion. Public
life takes on the deceptive aspect of a total of private interests
as though these interests could create a new quaUty through sheer addition.
All the so-called hberal concepts of politics
(that
is,
all the pre-imperialist
pohtical notions of the bourgeoisie)—such as unlimited competition regu-
lated by a secret balance which comes mysteriously from the sum
total of
competing activities, the pursuit of "enhghtened self-interest" as an adequate
pohtical virtue, unUmited progress inherent in the mere succession of events
—have this in common:
they simply add up private lives and personal be-

146
IMPERIALISM
havior patterns and present
the sum
as laws of history, or economics, or
politics.
Liberal
concepts,
however,
while
they
express
the
bourgeoisie's
instinctive
distrust
of and
its
innate
hostility
to public
affairs,
are only
a
temporary compromise between the old standards of Western culture and the
new
class's
faith
in property
as a dynamic, self-moving principle. The old
standards give way to the extent that automatically growing wealth actually
replaces
political
action.
Hobbcs was
the
true, though never fully recognized, philosopher of the
bourgeoisie because he
realized
that acqu sition
of wealth conceived
as
a
never-ending process can be guaranteed only by the seizure of political power,
for the accumulating process must sooner or
later force open
all
existing
territorial
limits. He foresaw that a society which had entered the path of
never-ending
acquisition had
to engineer a dynamic
political organization
capable of a corresponding never-ending process of power generation. He
even, through sheer force of imagination, was able to outline the main psy-
chological
traits of the new type of man who wjuld
fit into such a society
and
its tyrannical body
politic. He foresaw the necessary idolatry of power
itself by
this new human type, that he would be
flattered at being called a
power-thirsty animal, although actually society would force him to surrender
all his natural forces, his virtues and his vices, and would make him the poor
meek
little fellow who has not even the
right
to
rise against tyranny, and
who,
far from
striving for power, submits
to any existing government and
does not stir even when his best friend falls an innocent victim to an incom-
prehensible ralson d'etat.
For a Commonwealth based on the accumulated and monopolized power
of
all
its individual members necessarily leaves each person powerless, de-
prived of his natural and human capacities.
It leaves him degraded into
a
cog
in the power-accumulating machine,
free
to console himself with sub-
lime
thoughts about
the
ultimate
destiny
of
this machine, which
itself
is
constructed
in such a way that
it can devour the globe simply by following
its own inherent law.
The
ultimate
destructive purpose
of
this Commonwealth
is
at
least
in-
dicated in the philosophical interpretation of human equality as an "equality
of ability"
to
kill. Living with
all other nations "in the condition of a per-
petuall
war, and upon
the
confines
of
battle,
with
their
frontiers armed,
and canons planted against their neighbours round about,"
it has no other
law of conduct but the "most conducing to
[its] benefit" and will gradually
devour weaker structures
until
it comes to a last war "which provideth for
every man, by Victory, or Death."
By "Victory or Death," the Leviathan can indeed overcome
all political
limitations
that go
with
the
existence
of
other
peoples and
can
envelop
the whole earth
in
its tyranny. But when the
last war has come and every
man has been provided for, no ultimate peace
is established on earth:
the
power-accumulating machine, without which continual expansion would not
have
been
achieved,
needs more
material
to devour
in
its
never-ending
process. If the last victorious Commonwealth cannot proceed to "annex the

147
planets,"
it can only proceed
to destroy
itself in order to begin anew the
never-ending process of power generation.
Ill:
The Alliance Between Mob and Capital
WHEN IMPERIALISM entered the scene of politics with the scramble for Africa
in
the
eighties,
it was promoted by businessmen, opposed
fiercely by
the
governments in power, and welcomed by a surprisingly large section of the
educated classes.*" To the last
it seemed to be God-sent, a cure for
all evils,
an easy panacea for all conflicts. And
it
is true that imperialism
in a sense
did not disappoint these hopes.
It gave a new lease on
life to political and
social structures which were quite obviously threatened by new social and
political
forces and
which, under other
circumstances,
without
the
inter-
ference of imperialist developments, would hardly have needed two world
wars to disappear.
As matters
stood,
imperialism
spirited away
all troubles and produced
that deceptive
feeling
of
security,
so
universal
in pre-war Europe, which
deceived
all but the most sensitive minds. Peguy in France and Chesterton
in England knew instinctively that they lived in a world of hollow pretense
and that
its stability was the greatest pretense of
all. Until everything began
to crumble,
the
stability
of obviously outdated
political
structures was
a
fact, and
their stubborn unconcerned
longevity seemed
to
give
the
lie
to
those who felt the ground tremble under their feet. The solution of the riddle
was imperialism. The answer to the fateful question: why did the European
comity of nations allow
this
evil
to spread
until everything was destroyed,
the good as well as the bad, is that all governments knew very well that their
countries were
secretly
disintegrating,
that the body
politic was being de-
stroyed from within, and that they lived on borrowed time.
Innocently
enough,
expansion
appeared
first
as
the
outlet
for
excess
capital production and offered a remedy, capital export.*^ The tremendously
increased wealth produced by
capitalist production under a
social system
based on maldistribution had
resulted
in "oversaving"—that
is,

mulalion
of capital which was condemned
to
idleness within
the
existing
national capacity for production and consumption. This money was actually
superfluous, needed by nobody though owned by a growing class of some-
bodies. The ensuing
crises and
depressions during
the decades precedmg
the
era
of
imperialism * had
impressed upon
the
capitalists
the
thought
that
their whole economic system
of production depended upon
a supply
and demand
that from now on must come from "outside of
capitalist so-
ciety." «' Such supply and demand came from inside the nation, so long as
the
capitalist system
did not control
all
its
classes together with
its
entire
productive
capacity. When
capitalism had pervaded
the
entire economic
structure and
all social strata had come into the orbit of
its production and
consumption system, capitalists clearly had to decide either to see the whole
system collapse or to find new markets, that
is, to penetrate new countries
which
were
not
yet
subject
to
capitalism and
therefore could
provide
a
new noncapitalistic supply and demand.
The decisive point about the depressions of the sixties and seventies, which
initiated
the
era
of
imperialism, was
that
they
forced
the
bourgeoisie
to
realize for the
first time that the original sin of simple robbery, which cen-
turies ago had made possible the "original accumulation of capital" (Marx)
and had started
all further accumulation, had eventually to be repeated lest
the motor of accumulation suddenly die down." In the face of this danger,
which
threatened
not
only
the
bourgeoisie but
the whole
nation
with
a
catastrophic breakdown
in production, capitalist producers understood that
the forms and
laws of
their production system "from
the beginning had
been calculated for the whole earth." *'
*- The obvious connection between the severe crises
in the
sixties
in England and
the seventies on
the Continent and
imperialism
is mentioned
in Hayes, op.
cit.,
in a
footnote only (on
p. 219), and
in Schuyler, op.
cit., who believes
that "a
revival of
interest
in
emigration
was
an
important
factor
in
the
beginnings
of
the
imperial
movement" and that
this
interest had been caused by "a serious depression
in
British
trade and
industry" toward
the close of the
sixties
(p. 280). Schuyler
also describes
at some
length
the
strong
"anti-imperial
sentiment
of
the
mid-Victorian
era." Un-
fortunately.
Schuyler makes
no
differentiation between
the Commonwealth
and
the
Empire
proper, although
the discussion of pre-imperialist material might
easily have
suggested such
a
differentiation.

to
Rosa Luxemburg's
brilliant
insight
into
the
political
structure
of
imperialism
{op.
cit.,
pp. 273
ff., pp.
361
ff.), the
"historical process of the accumu-
lation
of capital depends
in
all
its
aspects upon
the
existence of noncapitalist
social
strata." so that "imperialism
is the political expression of the accumulation of capital
in
its competition
for the
possession of the remainders of the
noncapitalistic world."
This essential dependence of capitalism upon a noncapitalistic world
lies
at the
basis
of
all
other
aspects of
imperialism, which
then may
be explained
as
the
results of
oversaving
and
maldistribution
(Hobson,
op.

as
the
result
of
overproduction
and
the
consequent
need
for new
markets
(Lenin,
Imperialism,
the
Last
Stage
of
Capitalism,
1917), as the
result of an undersupply of raw material (Hayes, op.
cit.),
or as capital export in order to equalize the national profit rate (Hilferding, op.
cit.).

THE POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE
149
The
first reaction to the satiirated home market, lack of raw materials,
and growing crises, was export of capital. The owners of superfluous wealth
first
tried foreign investment without expansion and without political con-
trol, which resulted in an unparalleled orgy of swindles, financial scandals,
and stock-market speculation,
all
the more alarming since foreign
invest-
ments grew much more rapidly than domestic ones.*" Big money resulting
from oversaving paved the way for
little money,
the product of the
little
fellow's work. Domestic enterprises, in order to keep pace with high profits
from foreign investment, turned likewise to fraudulent methods and attracted
an increasing number of people who,
in
the hope of miraculous
returns,
threw their money out of the window. The Panama scandal in France, the
Griindungsschwindel
in Germany
and
Austria, became
classic
examples.
Tremendous
losses resulted from the promises of tremendous
profits. The
owners of little money lost so much so quickly that the owners of superfluous
big capital soon saw themselves left alone in what was, in a sense, a battle-
field.
Having
failed
to
change
the
whole
society
into
a community
of
gamblers they were again
superfluous, excluded from
the normal process
of
production
to
which,
after some
turmoil,
all
other
classes
returned
quietly,
if somewhat impoverished and embittered.*^
Export of money and foreign investment as such are not imperiaUsm and
do not necessarily lead
to expansion as a political device. As long as
the
owners
of superfluous
capital were content with
investing
"large portions
of their property in foreign lands," even
if
this tendency ran "counter
to
all past traditions of nationalism," ** they merely confirmed their aUenation
from the national body on which they were parasites anyway. Only when
they demanded government protection of their investments
(after the initial
stage of swindle had opened their eyes to the possible use of politics against
the risks of gambling) did they re-enter the life of the nation. In this appeal,
however, they followed the established tradition of bourgeois society, always
to consider
political institutions
exclusively
as an instrument for the pro-
tection of individual property.*' Only the fortunate coincidence of the rise

investment
increased
ninefold
while
national
income

to

He assumes a similar though probably

foreign investments.

IMPERIALISM
of a new class of property holders and the
industrial revolution had made
the Ixnirgcoisie producers and stimulators of production. As long as
it ful-
filled this basic function in modern society, which
is essentially a community
of producers,
its wealth had an important function for the nation as a whole.
The owners of superfluous capital were the
first section of the class to want
profits without
fulfilling some real
.social function—even
if
it was the func-
tion of an exploiting producer—and whom, consequently, no police could
ever have saved from the wrath of the people.
Expansion
then was an escape
not only
for superfluous
capital. More
important,
it protected
its owners against the menacing prospect of remain-
ing
entirely superfluous and
parasitical.
It saved
the bourgeoisie from
the
consequences
of
maldistribution
and
revitalized
its concept
of ownership
at
a time when wealth could no longer be used
as a factor in production
within the national framework and had come into conflict with the produc-
tion ideal of the community as a whole.
Older than
the superfluous wealth was another by-product of
capitalist
production:
the human debris
that every
crisis, following invariably upon
each
period
of
industrial growth,
eliminated permanently from producing
society. Men who had become permanently
idle were as superfluous
to the
community as the owners of superfluous wealth. That they were an actual
menace
to
society had been recognized throughout the nineteenth century
and
their
export had
helped
to
populate
the
dominions
of Canada and
Australia as well as the United
States. The new fact
in the imperialist era
is
that
these
two
superfluous
forces,
superfluous
capital
and
superfluous
working power,
joined hands and
left
the country
together. The concept
of expansion,
the export
of government power and
annexation
of every
territory
in which
nationals had invested either their wealth or their work,
seemed
the only
alternative
to increasing losses
in wealth and population.
Imperialism and
its idea of unlimited expansion seemed to offer a permanent
remedy for a permanent evil.'"

enough,

itself becoming
superfluous.
South Africa had been in British possession since the beginning of the cen-
tury because
it assured
the maritime road
to
India. The opening
of
the
Suez Canal, however, and the subsequent administrative conquest of Egypt,
lessened considerably the importance of the old trade station on the Cape.
The British would,
in
all probability, have withdrawn from Africa
just as
all European
nations had done whenever
their possessions and
trade
in-
terests in India were liquidated.
The particular irony and, in a sense, symbolical circumstance in the un-
expected development of South Africa
into
the
"culture-bed
of Imperial-
ism" ^^
lies in the very nature of
its sudden attractiveness when
it had
lost
all
value
for
the Empire
proper:
diamond
fields were
discovered
in
the
seventies and large gold mines in the eighties. The new desire for profit-at-
any-price converged for the first time with the old fortune hunt. Prospectors,
adventurers, and the scum of the big cities emigrated to the Dark Continent
along with capital from industrially developed countries. From now on, the
mob, begotten by the monstrous accumulation of capital, accompanied
its
begetter on those voyages of discovery where nothing was discovered but
new possibilities for investment. The owners of superfluous wealth were the
only men who
could
use
the
superfluous men who came from
the
four
corners of the earth. Together they established the first paradise of parasites
whose lifeblood was
gold. Imperialism,
the product of superfluous money
and
superfluous
men,
began
its
startling
career
by
producing
the
most
superfluous and unreal goods.
It may
still be doubtful whether the panacea of expansion would have
become
so
great
a
temptation
for
non-imperialists
if
it had
offered
its
dangerous
solutions only for those superfluous forces which,
in any case,
were
already
outside
the
nation's body
corporate. The
complicity
of
all
parliamentary
parties
in
imperialist programs
is
a matter
of
record. The
history of
the
British Labor Party
in
this
respect
is an almost unbroken
chain
of
justifications
of
Cecil Rhodes'
early
prediction:
"The workmen
find
that although
the Americans
are exceedingly fond
of them, and
are
just now exchanging the most brotherly sentiments with them yet are shutting
out their goods. The workmen also find that Russia, France and Germany
locally are doing the same, and the workmen see
that
if they do not look
out they will have no place in the world to trade at all. And so the workmen
have become Imperialist and the Liberal Party
are following." "^ In Ger-
many, the
liberals (and not the Conservative Party)
were the
actual pro-
moters of that famous naval policy which contributed so heavily to the out-
break of the
first World War.^^ The Socialist Party wavered between active

(it repeatedly voted funds for the

all ques-
tions of foreign
policy. Occasional warnings against the Lumpenproletanat,
and the possible bribing of sections of the working class with crumbs from
the
inHH-rialist
table,
did
not
lead
to a deeper understanding of
the great
appeal which the imperialist programs had to the rank and
file of the party.
In
Marxist
terms
the new phenomenon
of an
alliance between mob and
capital seemed so
unnatural,
so obviously
in
conflict with
the doctrine of
class struggle, that the actual dangers of the imperialist attempt—to divide
mankind
into master races and slave
races,
into higher and lower breeds,
into colored peoples and white men,
all of which were attempts
to unify
the people on the basis of the mob—were completely overlooked. Even the
breakdown of international solidarity at the outbreak of the first World War
did
not
disturb
the complacency
of
the
socialists
and
their
faith
in
the
proletariat
as such.
Socialists were
still probing the economic laws of im-
perialism when
imperialists had long since stopped obeying them, when in
overseas countries
these laws had been
sacrificed
to the
"imperial factor"
or
to
the
"race
factor," and when only
a few
elderly gentlemen
in high
finance
still believed
in the inalienable rights of the profit rate.
The curious weakness of popular opposition to imperialism, the numerous
inconsistencies and outright broken promises of liberal statesmen, frequently
ascribed
to opportunism or bribery, have other and deeper causes. Neither
opportunism
nor
bribery could have persuaded
a man
like Gladstone
to
break
his promise,
as
the leader
of the
Liberal
Party,
to evacuate Egypt
when he became Prime
Minister. Half consciously and hardly
articulately,
these men shared
with
the
people
the
conviction
that
the
national body
itself was so deeply split into classes, that class struggle was so universal a
characteristic of modern political
life, that the very cohesion of the nation
was jeopardized. Expansion again appeared as a lifesaver,
if and insofar as
it could provide a common interest for the nation as a whole, and
it is mainly
for
this
reason
that
imperialists were allowed
to become
"parasites upon
patriotism."
'•"*
Partly, of course, such hopes still belonged with the old vicious practice of
"healing" domestic conflicts with foreign adventures. The
difference, how-
ever,
is marked. Adventures
are by
their very nature limited
in time and
space; they may succeed temporarily
in overcoming
conflicts,
although
as
a rule they
fail and tend rather to sharpen them. From the very beginning
the
imperialist adventure of expansion appeared to be an eternal solution,
because expansion was conceived
as
unlimited.
Furthermore,
imperialism
was not an adventure
in the usual sense, because
it depended
less on na-
tionalist slogans

solid
basis
of economic
interests.

with the sum total of individual interests, expansion as such appeared to be
a possible common interest of the nation as a whole. Since the owning and
dominant classes had convinced everybody that economic interest and the
passion
for ownership
are
a sound
basis
for
the body
politic, even non-
imperialist statesmen were easily persuaded to yield when a common eco-
nomic interest appeared on the horizon.
These then are the reasons why nationalism developed so clear a tendency
toward imperialism,
the inner contradiction of the two principles notwith-
standing.''* The more
ill-fitted nations were for the incorporation of foreign
peoples
(which
contradicted
the
constitution
of
their own body
politic),
the more they were tempted to oppress them. In theory, there
is an abyss
between
nationalism
and
imperialism;
in
practice,
it
can and
has
been
bridged
by
tribal
nationalism and
outright
racism. From
the
beginning,
imperialists
in
all countries preached and boasted of
their being "beyond
the parties," and the only ones to speak for the nation as a whole. This was
especially
true
of
the
Central and Eastern European
countries
• with few
or no overseas holdings; there the alliance between mob and capital took
place
at home and resented even more
bitterly
(and attacked much more
violently)
the national institutions and
all national
parties.'^®
The
contemptuous
indifference
of
imperialist
politicians
to
domestic
issues was marked everywhere, however, and especially
in England. While
"parties above
parties"
like
the Primrose League
were
of secondary
in-
fluence, imperialism was the chief cause of the degeneration of the two-party
system into the Front Bench system, which led to a "diminution of the power
of opposition" in Parliament and to a growth of "power of the Cabinet as
against the House of Commons." " Of course this was also carried through
as a policy beyond the strife of parties and particular interests, and by men
who claimed to speak for the nation as a whole. Such language was bound
to attract and delude precisely those persons who
still retained a spark of
political idealism. The cry for unity resembled exactly the battle cries which
had always led peoples
to war; and
yet, nobody detected
in the universal
and permanent instrument of unity the germ of universal and permanent war.
Government officials engaged more actively than any other group in the
nationalist brand of imperialism and were chiefly responsible for the con-
fusion of imperiaUsm with nationahsm. The nation-states had created and
depended upon the civil services as a permanent body of officials who. served

Their professional
honor and sclf-respect-^^specially in England and Germany—denved from
their being servants of the nation as a whole. They were the only group with
a direct interest in supporting the state's fundamental claim to mdependence
of classes and factions. That the authority of the nation-state itself depended
largely on
the economic independence and
political
neutrality of
its
civil
servants becomes obvious
in our time; the dechne of nations has invariably
started with the corruption of
its permanent administration and the general
conviction
that
civil
servants
are
in
the pay, not of
the
state, but of the
owning classes. At the close of the century the owning classes had become
so dominant that
it was almost ridiculous for a state employee to keep up
the
pretense
of serving the
nation. Division
into classes
left them outside
the
social body and
forced them
to form
a
clique
of
their own.
In
the
colonial services they escaped the actual disintegration of the national body.
In ruling foreign peoples in faraway countries, they could much better pre-
tend to be heroic servants of the nation, "who by their services had glorified
the British race,"
'^^ than
if they had stayed at home. The colonies were no
longer simply "a
vast system
of outdoor
relief
for
the upper
classes"
as
James Mill could still describe them; they were to become the very backbone
of British nationalism, which discovered in the domination of distant coun-
tries and the rule over strange peoples the only way
to serve British, and
nothing but
British,
interests. The
services
actually believed
that "the pe-
culiar genius of each nation shows
itself nowhere more clearly than in their
system of dealing with subject races." °^
The truth was that only far from home could a citizen of England, Ger-
many, or France be nothing but an Englishman or German or Frenchman.
In
his own country he was
so entangled
in economic
interests
or
social
loyalties
that he
felt closer to a member of his class
in a foreign country
than
to a man of another class
in
his own. Expansion gave nationalism a
new lease on
life and therefore was accepted as an instrument of national
politics. The members of the new colonial societies and imperialist leagues
felt
"far removed from
the
strife
of
parties," and
the
farther away they
moved the stronger their belief that they "represented only a national pur-
pose." "° This shows

means for preservation were desperate too, and in the end the remedy proved
worse than the evil—which, incidentally,
it did not cure.
The
alliance between
capital and mob
is
to be found
at the genesis
of
every
consistently
imperialist
policy.
In
some
countries,
particularly
in
GreaFIBritain,
this new alliance between the much-too-rich and the much-
too-poor was and remained confined to overseas possessions. The so-called
hypocrisy of
British
policies was
the
result of the good sense of English
statesmen who drew
a sharp
line between
colonial methods and normal
domestic
policies,
thereby
avoiding
with
considerable
success
the
feared
boomerang
eff^ect
of imperialism upon
the homeland.
In other
countries,
particularly
in Germany and Austria,
the
alliance took
effect
at home
in
the form of pan-movements, and to a lesser extent in France, in a so-called
colonial policy. The aim
of these "movements" was, so
to speak,
to im-
perialize the whole nation (and not only the "superfluous" part of
it), to
combine domestic and foreign policy in such a way as to organize the nation
for_the looting of foreign territories and the permanent degradation of alien
peoples.
The rise of the mob out of the capitalist organization was observed early,
and
its growth carefully and anxiously noted by
all great historians of the
nineteenth century. Historical pessimism from Burckhardt to Spengler springs
essentially
from
this
consideration.
But what
the
historians,
sadly
pre-
occupied with
the phenomenon
in
itself,
failed to grasp was
that the mob
could not be identified with the growing industrial working class, and cer-
tainly not with the people as a whole, but that
it was composed actually of
the refuse of
all classes. This composition made
it seem that the mob and
its representatives had abolished class differences, that those, standing out-
side the class-divided nation were the people
itself (the Volksgemeinschaft,
as
the Nazis would
call
it)
rather than
its
distortion and
caricature. The
historical
pessimists
understood
the
essential
irresponsibility
of
this new
social stratum, and they also correctly foresaw the possibility of converting
democracy
into a despotism whose
tyrants would
rise from
the mob and
lean on
it for support. What they failed to understand was that the mobis^
not only
the refuse but
also the by-product of bourgeois
society,
directly
produced by
it and therefore never quite separable from
it. They failed for
this reason
to notice high
society's constantly growing admiration for the
underworld, which runs
like a red thread through
the nineteenth century,
its
continuous
step-by-step
retreat on
all
questions
of
morality,
and
its
growing taste for the anarchical cynicism of
its offspring. At the turn of the
century,
the Dreyfus
Affair showed
that underworld and high
society
in
France were so closely bound together that it was difficult definitely to place
any of the "heroes" among the Anti-Dreyfusards in either category.
This
feeling of
kinship,
the joining
together of
begetter and
offspring,
already classically expressed in Balzac's novels, antedates
all practical eco-
nomic,
political,
or
social
considerations
and
recalls
those
fundamental
psychological
traits of the new type of Western man that Hobbes outlined

.-^
IMPERIALISM
ihrcc hundred years ago. But
it
is true that
it was mainly due to the insights,
acuuircd by
the
bourgeoisie during
the
crises and depressions which pre-
ceded imperiaUsm,
that high society
finally admitted
its readiness to accept
the revolutionary change
in moral standards which Hobbes's "realism" had
proposed, and which was now
being proposed anew by
the mob and
its
leaders. The very
fact
that the
"original sin" of "original accumulation of
capital" would need additional sins to keep the system going was far more
effective in persuading the bourgeoisie to shake off the restraints of Western
tradition than either
its philosopher or
its underworld.
It finally induced the
German bourgeoisie to throw off the mask of hypocrisy and openly confess
its relationship to the mob, calling on
it expressly to champion
its property
interests.
It
is significant that this should have happened in Germany. In England
and Holland the development of bourgeois society had progressed relatively
quietly and the bourgeoisie of these countries enjoyed centuries of security
and freedom from
fear.
Its
rise
in France, however, was interrupted by a
great
popular
revolution
whose
consequences
interfered
with
the
bour-
geoisie's enjoyment of supremacy. In Germany, moreover, where the bour-
geoisie did not reach
full development until the latter half of the nineteenth
century,
its rise was accompanied from the start by the growth of a revolu-
tionary working-class movement with a tradition nearly
as old as
its own.
It was a matter of course that the less secure a bourgeois class felt in its own
country, the more
it would be tempted to shed the heavy burden of hypoc-
risy. High
society's
affinity with
the mob came
to
light
in France
earlier
than
in Germany,
but was
in
the end
equally
strong
in
both
countries.
France, however, because
of her revolutionary
traditions and her
relative
lack of industrialization, produced only a relatively small mob, so that her
bourgeoisie was
finally forced to look for help beyond the frontiers and to
ally
itself with
Hitler Germany.
Whatever the precise nature of the long historical evolution of the bour-
geoisie
in
the
various European
countries,
the
political
principles
of
the
mob,
as encountered
in
imperialist ideologies and
totalitarian movements,
betray a surprisingly strong affinity with the political attitudes of bourgeois
society,
if the latter are cleansed of hypocrisy and untainted by concessions
to Christian
tradition. What more recently made
the
nihihstic
attitudes
of
the mob
so
intellectually
attractive
to
the bourgeoisie
is a relationship of
principle that goes far beyond the actual birth of the mob.
In other words,
the disparity between cause and effect which character-
ized
the
birth
of
imperialism has
its
reasons. The
occasion—superfluous
wealth created by ovcraccumulation, which needed the mob's help
to
find
safe and
profitable investment—set in motion a force that had always lain
in
the basic
structure
of bourgeois
society, though
it had been hidden by
nobler
traditions and by
that
blessed hypocrisy which La Rochefoucauld
called the compliment vice pays to virtue. At the same time, completely un-
principled power
politics could not be played
until a mass of people^ w^as
available who were free of all principles and so large numerically that they

THE
POLITICAL EMANCIPATION OF THE BOURGEOISIE
157
surpassed the ability of state and society to take care of them. The fact that
this mob could be used only by imperialist politicians and inspired only by
racial doctrines made
it appear as though imperialism alone were able
to
settle the grave domestic, social, and economic problems of modern times.
The philosophy of Hobbes,
it
is
true, contains nothing of modern race
doctrines, which not only stir up the mob, but in their totalitarian form out-
line very clearly the forms of organization through which humanity could
carry the endless process of capital and power accumulation through to
its
logical end in self-destruction. But Hobbes at least provided political thought
with the prerequisite for all race doctrines, that
is, the exclusion in principle
of the idea of humanity which constitutes the sole regulating idea of inter-
national law. With the assumption that foreign pohtics is necessarily outside
of the human contract, engaged in the perpetual war of all against all, which
is the law of the "state of nature," Hobbes affords the best possible theoretical
foundation for those naturalistic ideologies which hold nations to be
tribes,
separated from
each
other by
nature,
without any
connection
whatever,
unconscious of the solidarity of mankind and having in common only the
instinct for self-preservation which man shares with
the animal world.
If
the idea of humanity, of which the most conclusive symbol
is the common
origin of the human species, is no longer valid, then nothing is more plausible
than a theory according to which brown, yellow, or black races are descended
from some other species of apes than the white race, and that
all together
are predestined by nature
to war
against each other
until they have
dis-
appeared from the face of the earth.
If
it should prove to be true that we are imprisoned in Hobbes's endless
process of power accumulation, then the organization of the mob
will
in-
evitably take the form of transformation of nations into races, for there
is,
under the conditions
of an accumulating
society, no other unifying bond
available between individuals who in the very process of power accumulation
and expansion are losing all natural connections with their fellow-men.
Racism may indeed carry out the doom of the Western world and, for
that matter, of the whole of human civilization. When Russians have become
Slavs, when Frenchmen have assumed the role of commanders of a jorce
noire, when Englishmen have turned
into "white men,"
as
already
for a
disastrous
spell
all Germans became Aryans,
then
this change
will
itself
signify the end of Western man. For no matter what learned scientists may
say, race
is, politically speaking, not the beginning of humanity but
its end,
not the origin of peoples but their decay, not the natural birth of man but
his unnatural death.

Race-Thinking Before
Racism
IF
RACE-THINKING were a German
invention,
as
it has been sometimes
a>iscrted,
then "German
thinking"
(whatever
that may
be)
was
vic-
torious
in many parts of the
spiritual world long before the Nazis started
their
ill-fated
attempt
at
world
conquest.
Hitlerism
exercised
its
strong
international and inter-European appeal during the
thirties because racism,
although a
state doctrine only
in Germany, had been a powerful trend in
public opinion everywhere. The Nazi political war machine had long been
m motion when
in 1939 German tanks began
their march of destruction,
since—in
political warfare—racism was calculated to be a more powerful
ally
than
any
paid
agent
or
secret
organization
of
fifth
columnists.
Strengthened by the experiences of almost two decades in the various capi-
tals, the Nazis were confident that their best "propaganda" would be their
racial
policy
itself,
from
which,
despite many
other
compromises
and
broken promises,
they had never swerved for expediency's
sake.^ Racism
was neither a new nor a secret weapon, though never before had
it been
used with
this thoroughgoing consistency.
The
historical
truth
of
the matter
is
that race-thinking, with
its
roots
deep
in
the
eighteenth
century, emerged
simultaneously
in
all
Western
countries
during
the
nineteenth
century.
Racism
has
been
the
powerful
ideology of imperialistic pohcies since the turn of our century.
It certainly
has absorbed and revived all the old patterns of race opinions which, how-
ever, by
themselves would
hardly have been
able
to
create
or,
for
that
matter, to degenerate into racism as a Weltanschauung or an ideology. In
the
middle
of
the
last
century,
race
opinions
were
still
judged
by
the
yardstick
of
political
reason:
Tocqueville
wrote
to
Gobineau
about
the
lattcr's
doctrines, "They
are probably wrong and
certainly
pernicious." ^
Not
until
the end
of
the
century were
dignity and importance
accorded
race-thinking
as though
it had been one of the major
spiritual contribu-
tions of the Western world.'

the German-Russian
pact, Nazi propaganda stopped
all
attacks on "Bol-
shevism"
but
never gave up the
race-line.

RACE-THINKING BEFORE RACISM
159
Until
the
fateful days
of
the "scramble
for
Africa,"
race-thinking had
been one of the many free opinions which, within
the general framework
of liberalism, argued and fought each other
to win
the consent of public
opinion/ Only a few of them became
full-fledged
ideologies,
that
is,
sys-
tems based upon a single opinion that proved strong enough to attract and
persuade
a
majority
of people and broad enough
to
lead them
through
the various experiences and
situations
of an average modern
life. For an
ideology differs from a simple opinion in that
it claims to possess either the
key
to history, or the solution for
all the "riddles of the universe," or the
intimate knowledge
of
the hidden
universal
laws which
are supposed
to
rule
nature and man. Few
ideologies
have won
enough
prominence
to
survive the hard competitive struggle of persuasion, and only two have come
out on top and essentially defeated
all others:
the ideology which interprets
history
as an economic
struggle
of
classes, and
the
other
that
interprets
history as a natural fight of races. The appeal of both to large masses was
so strong
that they were
able
to
enlist
state support and
establish them-
selves as
official national doctrines. But far beyond
the boundaries within
which
race-thinking
and
class-thinking
have
developed
into
obligatory
patterns of thought, free public opinion has adopted them to such an extent
that not only intellectuals but great masses of people will no longer accept
a presentation of past or present facts that
is not in agreement with either
of these views.
The tremendous power of persuasion inherent in the main ideologies of
our times
is
not
accidental. Persuasion
is not
possible without appeal
to
either experiences or desires,
in other words
to immediate
political needs.
Plausibility in these matters comes neither from scientific facts, as the vari-
ous brands of Darwinists would like us to believe, nor from historical laws,
as the historians pretend,
in
their efforts
to discover the law according
to
which
civilizations
rise
and
fall.
Every
full-fledged
ideology
has
been
created,
continued
and
improved
as
a
political
weapon
and
not
as
a
theoretical doctrine.
It
is true
that sometimes—and such
is the case with
racism—an ideology has changed
its
original
political
sense, but without
immediate
contact
with
political
life
none
of
them
could
be
imagined.
Their scientific aspect
is secondary and arises
first from the desire to pro-
vide
watertight
arguments,
and
second
because
their
persuasive
power
also got hold of scientists, who no longer were
interested
in the
result of
their research but
left
their laboratories and hurried
off
to preach
to
the
multitude
their new interpretations of
life and world.' We owe
it
to these

(Hayes,

scientific
results which was
at least as strong as his passion for science
itself, has been stressed recently by an ap-
plauding

Two
rather extreme examples may be quoted
to show what
scientists
are capable

f(^
IMPERIALISM
"scientific"
preachers
rather
than
to any
scientific
findings
that
today no
single
science
is
left
into whose
categorical
system
race-thinking
has
not
deeply
|-)enetrated.
This
again
has made
historians, some
of whom
have
been tempted to hold science responsible for race-thinking, mistake certain
cither
philological
or
biological
research
results
for
causes
instead
of
consequences of
race-thinking." The
opposite would have come
closer
to
the
truth. As
a
matter
of
fact,
the
doctrine
that
Might
is
Right
needed
several centuries (from the seventeenth to the nineteenth)
to conquer natu-
ral science and produce
the "law" of the survival of the
fittest. And
if, to
lake another instance, the theory of de Maistre and Schelling about savage
tribes as the decaying residues of former peoples had suited the nineteenth-
century
political
devices
as
well
as
the
theory
of
progress,
we
would
probably
never have
heard much
of
"primitives"
and no
scientist would
have wasted his time looking for the "missing link" between ape and man.
The blame
is not
to be
laid on any science
as such, but
rather on certain
scientists who
were
no
less
hypnotized
by
ideologies
than
their
fellow-
citizens.
The
fact
that
racism
is
the
main
ideological weapon
of
imperialistic
politics
is
so
obvious
that
it
seems
as
though many
students
prefer
to
avoid
the beaten track of truism.
Instead, an old misconception of racism
of.
Both were
scholars of good
standing,
writing during World War
I. The German
historian of
art, Josef Strzygowski,
in
his
Altai, Iran und Volkerwanderung
(Leipzig,
|V|7) discovered the Nordic race to be composed of Germans. Ukrainians. Armenians,
Persians.
Hungarians,
Bulgars and Turks
(pp.
306-307). The Society of Medicine of
Paris
not only published
a report on
the discovery of "polychesia"
(excessive defeca-
tion)
and
"bromidrosis"
(body
odor)
in
the German
race,
but
proposed
urinalysis
for the detection of German
spies; German urine was "found" to contain 20 per cent
non-uric
nitrogen
as
against
15
per cent
for other
races. See Jacques
Barzun, Race,
New York.
1937.
p.
239.
' This quid pro quo was partly the
result of the zeal of students who wanted to put
down every
single
instance
in which
race has been mentioned. Thereby they mistook
relatively
harmless
authors,
for whom
explanation by
race was
a
possible and some-
times fascinating opinion, for full-fledged
racists. Such opinions, in themselves harmless,
were
advanced
by
the
early
anthropologists
as
starting
points
of
their
investiga-
tions. A
typical
instance
is the naive hypothesis of Paul
Broca. noted French anthro-
pologist of the middle of the
last century, who assumed
that "the brain has something
to do with
race and the measured shape of the skull
is the best way to get
at the con-
tents of the brain" (quoted
after Jacques Barzun, op.
cit.,
p.
162).
It
is obvious
that
this
assertion,
without
the support
of a conception of
the
nature
of man,
is simply
ridiculous.
As for the philologists of the early nineteenth century, whose concept of "Aryanism"
has seduced almost every student of racism to count them among the propagandists or
even
inventors of
race-thinking,
they
are
as innocent
as innocent can
be. When they
overstepped
the
limits of pure
research
it was because they wanted
to
include
in the
same cultural brotherhood as many nations as possible. In the words of Ernest Seillicre,
La Philosophie de ilmpcrialisnw. 4
vols..
1903-1906:
"There was a kind of intoxica-
tion:
modern
civilization
believed
it had
recovered
its pedigree
.
.
. and an organism
was born which embraced
in one and
the same fraternity
all
nations whose language
showed
some
affinity
with
Sanskrit."
(Preface, Tome
I.
p.
xxxv.)
In
other
words,
these men were
still
in
the humanistic
tradition of the eighteenth century and shared
its enthusiasm about strange people and exotic cultures.

RACE-THINKING BEFORE RACISM

as a kind of exaggerated nationalism
is
still given currency. Valuable works
of students, especially in France, who have proved that racism
is not only
a quite different phenomenon but tends
to destroy
the body
politic of the
nation,
are
generally overlooked.
Witnessing
the
gigantic competition be-
tween
race-thinking and
class-thinking
for dominion
over
the
minds
of
modern men, some have been inclined to see
in the one the expression of
national and
in the other the expression of international trends,
to believe
the one to be the mental preparation for national wars and the other to be
the
ideology
for
civil
wars.
This
has been
possible
because
of
the
first
World War's curious mixture of old national and new imperialistic conflicts,
a mixture in which old national slogans proved
still to possess a far greater
appeal to the masses of
all countries involved than any imperialistic aims.
The last war, however, with
its Quislings and collaborationists everywhere,
should have proved that racism can
stir up
civil conflicts
in every country,
and
is one of the most ingenious devices ever invented for preparing
civil
war.
For the
truth
is
that race-thinking entered
the scene
of
active
politics
the moment the European peoples had prepared, and
to
a
certain
extent
realized,
the new body
politic
of
the
nation. From
the
very
beginning,
racism deliberately cut across
all national boundaries, whether defined by
geographical,
linguistic,
traditional,
or
any
other
standards,
and
denied
national-political existence as such. Race-thinking, rather than class-think-
ing, was
the
ever-present shadow accompanying
the development
of
the
comity of European nations, until
it finally grew to be the powerful weapon
for
the destruction of those
nations.
Historically speaking,
racists have
a
worse
record
of
patriotism
than
the
representatives
of
all
other
inter-
national ideologies together, and they were the only ones who consistently
denied
the
great
principle upon which
national
organizations
of
peoples
are built, the principle of equality and solidarity of
all peoples guaranteed
by the idea of mankind.
i:
A "Race" of Aristocrats Against a "Nation" of Citizens
A STEADILY rising interest
in the most
different,
strange, and even savage
peoples
was
characteristic
of
France
during
the
eighteenth
century.
This was
the
time when
Chinese
paintings
were
admired
and
imitated,
when one of the most famous works
of
the century was named
Lettres
Persanes, and when travelers' reports were the favorite reading of society.
The honesty and simplicity of savage and uncivilized peoples were opposed
to
the
sophistication and
frivolity
of
culture. Long
before
the
nineteenth
century with
its tremendously enlarged opportunities for travel brought the
non-European world
into
the home
of every
average
citizen,
eighteenth-
century French society had tried to grasp spiritually the content of cultures
and countries that lay far beyond European boundaries. A great enthusiasm

jf^t
IMPERIALISM
for "new specimens of mankind" (Herder)
filled
the hearts of the heroes
of
ihc
French
Revolution who
together
with
the French
nation
liberated
every
people
of every
color under
the
French
flag.
This
enthusiasm
for
strange and foreign countries culminated
in
the message
of
fraternity,
be-
cause"
it was
inspired by
the
desire
to prove
in every new and
surprising
"specimen of mankind" the old saying of La Bruyere: "La raison est de tous
les
climats."
Yet
it
is
this
nation-creating
century and
humanity-loving
country
to
which we must trace the germs of what later proved to become the nation-
destroying and humanity-annihilating power of racism.^
It
is a remarkable
fact
that the
first author who assumed the coexistence of different peoples
with different origins in France, was
at the same time the
first to elaborate
definite
class-thinking. The Comte de
Boulainvillicrs,
a French nobleman
who wrote
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century and whose works
were
published
after
his
death,
interpreted
the
history
of France
as
the
history of two different nations of which
the one, of Germanic origin, had
conquered the older inhabitants, the "Gaules," had imposed
its laws upon
them, had taken
their lands, and had settled down as the ruling
class, the
"peerage" whose supreme
rights rested upon
the
"right of conquest" and
the "necessity of obedience always due to the strongest."
* Engaged chiefly
in finding arguments against the rising political power of the Tiers Etat and
their spokesmen,
the "nouveau corps" formed by
"gens de
lettres
et de
his," Boulainvillicrs had to fight the monarchy too because the French king
wanted no
longer
to
represent
the peerage
as primus
inter pares but the
nation as a whole;
in him, for a while, the new rising class found
its most
powerful protector. In order to regain uncontested primacy for the nobility,
Boulainvillicrs proposed
that
his fellow-noblemen deny
a common
origin
with
the French
people, break up
the
unity
of
the
nation, and claim an
original and
therefore
eternal
distinction." Much bolder than most of
the
later defenders of
nobility,
Boulainvillicrs denied any predestined connec-
tion with the soil; he conceded that the "Gaules" had been in France longer,
that
the
"Francs" were
strangers and
barbarians. He
based
his
doctrine
solely on the eternal right of conquest and found no
difficulty
in
asserting
that "Friesland
.
.
.
has been the true cradle of the French nation." Cen-
turies before the actual development of imperialistic racism, following only
the inherent
logic of his concept, he considered the original inhabitants of
France natives in the modern sense, or in his own terms "subjects"—not of
' Francois Hotman, French sixteenth-century author of Franco-Gallia,
is sometimes
held
to be a forerunner of eighteenth-century
racial doctrines,
as by Ernest
Seilliere,
op.
cit. Against
this misconception, Theophile Simar has
rightly protested: "Hotman
appears, not as an apologist for the Teutons, but as the defender of the people which
was oppressed by the monarchy" (Etude Critique sur
la Formation de
la doctrine des
Races au I8e et son expansion au 19e siecle, Bruxelles,
1922, p. 20).

the king—but
of
all
those whose
advantage was
descent from
the
con-
quering people, who by right of birth were to be called "Frenchmen."
Boulainvilliers was deeply influenced by
the seventeenth-century might-
right doctrines and he certainly was one of the most consistent contempo-
rary
disciples
of
Spinoza, whose
Ethics he
translated and whose
Traite
theologico-polUique
he
analyzed.
In
his
reception
and
application
of
Spinoza's
political
ideas, might was changed
into conquest and conquest
jicted
as a kind of unique judgment on
the
natural
qualities and human
^ivileges of men and nations. In this we may detect the
first traces of later
naturalistic
transformations
the
might-right
doctrine was
to
go
through.
This view
is
really corroborated by
the
fact
that
Boulainvilliers was one
of
the
outstanding
freethinkers
of
his
time, and
that
his
attacks on
the
Christian Church were hardly motivated by anticlericalism alone.
Boulainvilliers'
theory, however,
still
deals
with
peoples and not with
races; it bases the right of the superior people on a historical deed, conquest,
and
not
on
a
physical
fact—although
the
historical
deed
already
has
a
certain
influence on
the
natural
qualities
of
the conquered
people.
It
invents two different peoples within France in order to counteract the new
national
idea,
represented
as
it was
to
a
certain
extent by
the
absolute
monarchy
in alliance with
the
Tiers Etat.
Boulainvilliers
is antinational
at
a time when the idea of nationhood was
felt to be new and revolutionary,
but had not yet shown, as
it did in the French Revolution, how closely
it
was connected with a democratic form of government.
Boulainvilliers pre-
pared
his
country
for
civil war without knowing what
civil war
meant.
He
is representative of many of the nobles who did not regard themselves
as representative of the nation, but as a separate ruling caste which might
have much more
in common with
a foreign people of the "same
society
and condition" than with
its compatriots.
It has been,
indeed,
these
anti-
national trends
that exercised
their influence
in
the milieu of
the emigres
and
finally were absorbed by new and outspoken
racial
doctrines
late
in
the nineteenth century.
Not
until
the
actual outbreak
of the Revolution forced
great numbers
of the French nobility to seek refuge in Germany and England did Boulain-
villiers' ideas show their usefulness as a political weapon. In the meantime,
his influence upon the French
aristocracy was kept
alive,
as can be seen
in the works of another Comte, the Comte Dubuat-Nangay,^^ who wanted
to
tie French
nobility even
closer
to
its continental brothers. On
the eve
of the Revolution, this spokesman of French feudalism
felt so insecure that
he hoped for
"the
creation
of
a kind
of Internationale
of
aristocracy
of
barbarian origin," ^^ and since the German nobility was the only one whose
help could eventually be expected, here too the true origin of the French
nation was supposed
to
be
identical
with
that
of
the Germans and
the
French lower classes, though no longer slaves, were not free by
birth but

IMPERIALISM
by
"affranchisscment," by grace
of those who were
free by
birth, of
the
nobility. A
few
years
later
the
French
exiles
actually
tried
to form
an
intcrmitionale of
aristocrats
in order
to stave
off
the
revolt of those they
considered
to be a foreign enslaved people. And although the more practi-
cal
side
of
these
attempts
suffered
the
spectacular
disaster
of
Valmy,
emigres
like
Charles
Francois
Dominique
de
Villiers, who
about
1800
opposed the "Gallo-Romains" to the Germanics, or like William Alter who
a decade
later dreamed of a federation of
all Germanic peoples/- did not
admit defeat.
It probably never occurred
to them
that they were
actually
traitors, so
firmly were they convinced
that the French Revolution was
a
"war between foreign peoples"—as Fran9ois Guizot much
later put
it.
While
Boulainvilliers,
with
the calm
fairness
of a
less
disturbed
time,
based the rights of nobility solely on the rights of conquest without directly
depreciating the very nature of the other conquered nation, the Comte de
Montlosier, one of the rather dubious personages among the French exiles,
openly expressed his contempt for this "new people risen from slaves
.
.
.
(a mixture)
of
all races and
all
times." ^^ Times
obviously had changed
and noblemen who no longer belonged
to an unconquered race
also had
to change. They gave up the old idea, so dear to Boulainvilliers and even
to
Montesquieu,
that conquest
alone,
fortune des armes,
determined
the
destinies
of men. The Valmy
of noble
ideologies came when
the Abbe
Sie'yes
in
his famous pamphlet
told the
Tiers Etat
to "send back
into
the
forests of Franconia
all those families who preserve the absurd pretension
of being descended from the conquering race and of having succeeded to
their rights." '*
It
is rather curious that from these early times when French noblemen
in their class struggle against the bourgeoisie discovered that they belonged
to another nation, had another genealogical origin, and were more closely
tied
to an international caste than to the
soil of France,
all French
racial
theories have supported
the Germanism or
at
least the
superiority of the
Nordic
peoples
as
against
their own countrymen. For
if
the men
of
the
French
Revolution
identified themselves
mentally
with Rome,
it was
not
because they opposed to the "Germanism" of their nobility a "Latinism" of
the Tiers Etat, but because they
felt they were the spiritual heirs of Roman
Republicans.
This
historical
claim,
in
contrast
to
the
tribal
identification
of the nobility, might have been among the causes that prevented "Latinism"
from emerging as a racial doctrine of
its own. In any event, paradoxical as
it sounds, the fact
is
that Frenchmen were
to
insist earlier than Germans

in exile, was closely connected with the French chief of police,

financial conditions of a refugee. Later, he

society. See Joseph

did
the

Prussian
defeat
of
1806,

to

identification
of
classes
and
races
and
distinguished
between
a
"Germanic nobility" and a
"celtic bourgeoisie," ^® and again a nobleman,
the Comte de Remusat, proclaimed the Germanic origin of the European
aristocracy. Finally, the Comte de Gobineau developed an opinion already
generally accepted among the French nobility into a full-fledged historical
doctrine, claiming to have detected the secret law of the fall of civilizations
and to have exalted history
to the dignity of a natural science. With him
race-thinking completed
its
first
stage, and began
its second
stage whose
influences were to be felt until the twenties of our century.
II:
Race Unity as a Substitute for National Emancipation
RACE-THINKING
in Germany did not develop before
the defeat of the old
Prussian army by Napoleon.
It owed
its
rise
to the Prussian patriots and
political romanticism, rather than
to the
nobility and
their spokesmen. In
contrast
to
the French brand of race-thinking
as
a weapon
for
civil war
and for splitting the nation, German race-thinking was invented in an effort
to
unite
the people
against foreign domination.
Its
authors
did not look
for
allies
beyond
the
frontiers
but wanted
to awaken
in
the
people
a
consciousness of common
origin. This
actually excluded the nobility with
their notoriously cosmopolitan relations—which, however, were
less char-
acteristic of the Prussian Junkers than of the rest of the European nobility;
at any
rate,
it excluded
the
possibility
of
this
race-thinking basing
itself
on the most exclusive class of the people.
Since German
race-thinking accompanied
the long
frustrated
attempts
to unite the numerous German states,
it remained so closely connected, in
its early stages, with more general national feelings that
it
is rather difficult
to
distinguish between mere
nationalism and
clear-cut
racism.
Harmless
national
sentiments
expressed
themselves
in what we know today
to be
racial
terms,
so
that even
historians who
identify
the
twentieth-century
German brand of racism with the peculiar language of German nationalism
have
strangely been
led
into mistaking Nazism
for German
nationalism,
thereby helping
to underestimate
the tremendous
international
appeal
of
Hitler's
propaganda.
These
particular
conditions
of German
nationalism
changed only when,
after 1870,
the
unification of the nation
actually had
taken place and German racism, together with German imperialism,
fully
developed. From these early times, however, not a few characteristics sur-

IMPERIALISM
vivcd which have remained
significant
for
the
specifically German brand
of race-thinking.
In contrast to France, Prussian noblemen felt their mterests to be closely
connected with
the
position of
the
absolute monarchy and,
at
least since
the
time of Frederick
II,
they sought
recognition
as
the
legitimate
repre-
sentatives of the nation as a whole. With the exception of the few years of
Prussian reforms (from 1808-1812), the Prussian
nobility was not
fright-
ened by the
rise of a bourgeois class that might have wanted
to take over
the government, nor did they have
to fear a coalition between
the middle
classes and
the
ruling house. The
Prussian
king,
until
1809
the
greatest
landlord of the country, remained primus inter pares despite
all
efforts of
the Reformers. Race-thinking, therefore, developed outside the nobility, as
a weapon
of
certain
nationalists who wanted
the
union
of
all German-
speaking peoples and
therefore
insisted on
a common
origin. They were
liberals
in the sense
that they were rather opposed to the exclusive rule of
the Prussian Junkers. As long as
this common origin was defined by com-
mon language, one can hardly speak of race-thinking.^^
It
is noteworthy
that only
after
1814
is
this common
origin described
frequently
in terms of "blood relationship," of family
ties, of
tribal
unity,
of unmixed
origin. These
definitions, which appear almost simultaneously
in
the writings of the Catholic Josef Goerres and nationalistic
liberals
like
Ernst Moritz Arndl or F. L. Jahn, bear witness to the
utter failure of the
hopes of rousing
true
national sentiments
in
the German people. Out of
the
failure
to
raise
the people
to nationhood, out of the lack of common
historical memories and the apparent popular apathy
to common destinies
in
the
future,
a
naturalistic
appeal was
born
which
addressed
itself
to
tribal
instincts
as a possible substitute for what the whole world had seen
to be the glorious power of French nationhood. The organic doctrine of a
history for which "every race
is a separate, complete whole" ^^ was invented
by men who needed ideological definitions of national unity as a substitute
for political nationhood.
It was a frustrated nationalism that led to Arndt's
statement that Germans—who apparently were the last to develop an organic
unit>'—had
the luck
to be of pure, unmixed stock, a "genuine people." "
Organic naturalistic definitions of peoples are an outstanding characteris-
tic of German ideologies and German historism. They nevertheless are not
yet actual racism, for the same men who speak
in these "racial" terms
still
uphold the central pillar of genuine nationhood, the equality of
all peoples.

life, he insists on the genuine equal plurality of peoples
in whose complete multitude alone mankind can be realized.^" And Arndt,
who later was to express strong sympathies with the national liberation move-
ments of the Poles and
the
Italians, exclaimed:
"Cursed be anyone who
would subjugate and
rule foreign peoples." ^^ Insofar as German national
feelings had not been the fruit of a genuine national development but rather
the reaction to foreign occupation,^^ national doctrines were of a peculiar
negative character, destined to create a wall around the people,
to
act as
substitutes for frontiers which could not be clearly defined either geograph-
ically or historically.
If,
in
the early form of French
aristocracy, race-thinking had been
in-
vented
as an instrument of internal division and had turned out
to be
a
weapon for civil war, this early form of German race-doctrine was invented
as a weapon of internal national unity and turned out to be a weapon for
national wars. As the decline of the French nobility as an important class
in the French nation would have made this weapon useless
if the foes of the
Third Republic had not revived
it, so upon the accomplishment of German
national unity the organic doctrine of history would have
lost
its meaning
had
not modern
imperialistic
schemers wanted
to
revive
it,
in
order
to
appeal to the people and to hide their hideous faces under the respectable
cover of nationalism. The same does not hold true for another source of
German racism which, though seemingly more remote from
the scene of
politics, had a far stronger genuine bearing upon
later political ideologies.
Political romanticism has been accused of inventing race-thinking,
as
it
has been and could be accused of inventing every other possible irresponsible
opinion. Adam Mueller and Friedrich Schlegel are symptomatic in the high-
est degree of a general playfulness of modern thought in which almost any
opinion can gain ground temporarily. No real thing, no historical event, no
political idea was safe from the all-embracing and all-destroying mania by
which
these
first
literati could always
find new and original opportunities
for new and fascinating opinions. "The world must be romanticized,"
as
Novalis put
it, wanting "to bestow a high sense upon the common, a mys-
terious appearance upon
the
ordinary,
the
dignity
of
the unknown upon

states: "No branch has a

the people, an
object
that could be changed
at a moment's
notice
into
the
state, or the
family, or
nobility, or anything else
that either—in the
earlier days—hap-
pened to cross the minds of one of these intellectuals or—later when, grow-
ing older, they had learned die reality of daily bread—happened to be asked
for by some paying patron.-' Therefore
it
is almost impossible to study the
development of any of the free competing opinions of which the nineteenth
century
is
so
amazingly
full,
without coming
across
romanticism
in
its
Cierman form.
What these
first modern
intellectuals actually prepared was not so much
the development of any single opinion but the general mentality of modern
German scholars; these
latter have proved more than once that hardly an
ideology can be found to which they would not willingly submit
if the only
reality—which even a romantic can hardly afford to overlook—is at stake,
the
reality of
their position. For
this peculiar behavior, romanticism pro-
vided
the most
excellent
pretext
in
its
unlimited
idolization
of
the
"per-
sonality"
of
the
individual, whose
very
arbitrariness became
the proof of
genius. Whatever served the so-called productivity of the individual, namely,
the
entirely
arbitrary game of his "ideas," could be made the center of a
whole outlook on life and world.
This inherent cynicism of romantic personality-worship has made possible
certain modern
attitudes among
intellectuals. They were
fairly
well repre-
sented by Mussolini, one of the
last heirs of
this movement, when he de-
scribed himself as at the same time "aristocrat and democrat, revolutionary
and
reactionary,
proletarian and
antiproletarian,
pacifist and
antipacifist."
The
ruthless
individualism
of
romanticism
never
meant
anything
more
serious than that "everybody
is free to create for himself his own ideology."
What was new
in Mussolini's experiment was the "attempt to carry
it out
with
all possible energy." ^^
Because of
this inherent "relativism"
the direct contribution of roman-
ticism to the development of race-thinking can almost be neglected. In the
anarchic game whose rules
entitle everybody
at any given time
to
at
least
one personal and arbitrary opinion,
it is almost a matter of course that every
conceivable
opinion
should be formulated and duly
printed. Much more
characteristic than
this chaos was the fundamental
belief in personality as
an ultimate aim in itself. In Germany, where the conflict between the nobility
and the rising middle class was never fought out on the political scene, per-
sonality worship developed as the only means of gaining at least some kind
of social emancipation. The governing class of the country frankly showed
its
traditional
contempt
for
business
and
its
dislike
for
association
with
merchants in spite of the
latter's growing wealth and importance, so that

was not easy to find the means of winning some kind of self-respect. The
classic German Bildungsroman, Wilhelm Meister, in which the middle-class
hero
is educated by noblemen and actors because the bourgeois in his own
social sphere
is without "personality,"
is evidence enough of the hopeless-
ness of the situation.
German
intellectuals, though they hardly promoted a
political
fight for
the middle classes
to which they belonged, fought an embittered and, un-
fortunately, highly successful battle for social
status. Even those who had
written
in defense of nobility
still
felt their own
interests
at stake when
it
came to social ranks. In order to enter competition with rights and qualities
of birth, they formulated the new concept of the "innate personality" which
was to win general approval within bourgeois society. Like the
title of the
heir of an old family, the "innate personality" was given by birth and not
acquired by merit. Just as the lack of common history for the formation of
the
nation had been
artificially overcome by
the
naturalistic
concept
of
organic development, so, in the social sphere, nature
itself was supposed to
supply
a
title when
political
reality had
refused
it.
Liberal
writers
soon
boasted of "true nobility" as opposed to the shabby titles of Baron or others
which could be given and taken away, and
asserted, by
implication,
that
their natural privileges, like "force or genius," could not be retraced to any
human deed.-®
The
discriminatory
point
of
this new
social
concept was
immediately
affirmed. During the long period of mere social antisemitism, which
intro-
duced and prepared
the discovery of Jew-hating as a political weapon,
it
was the lack of "innate personality," the innate lack of tact, the innate lack
of productivity, the innate disposition for trading,
etc., which separated the
behavior of his Jewish colleague from that of the average businessman. In
its feverish attempt to summon up some pride of
its own against the caste
arrogance
of
the
Junkers,
without, however,
daring
to
fight
for
political
leadership,
the bourgeoisie from
the very beginning wanted
to look down
not so much on other lower classes of their own, but simply on other peoples.
Most significant for these attempts
is
the small
literary work
of Clemens
Brentano -^ which was
written
for and read
in
the
ultranationalistic
club
of Napoleon-haters that gathered together in 1808 under the name of "Die
Christlich-Deutsche Tischgesellschaft." In his highly sophisticated and witty
manner, Brentano points out the contrast between the "innate personality,"
the genial individual, and the
"philistine" whom he immediately
identifies
with Frenchmen and Jews. Thereafter, the German bourgeois would at least
try to attribute to other peoples
all the qualities which the nobility despised
as typically bourgeois—at
first to the French,
later to the English, and
al-
ways to the Jews. As for the mysterious qualities which an "innate person-

liberal writer Buch-
holz, Vntersuchungen ueber den Geburtsadel, Berlin,

cannot be given or taken away; for,
like power and genius,
it
sets
itself and exists by
itself."

IMPERIALISM
ality" received at birth, they were exactly the same as those the real Junkers
claimed for themselves.
Although
in this way standards of nobility contributed to the rise of race-
thinking,
the
Junkers
themselves
did
hardly
anything
for
the
shaping
of
this mentality. The only Junker of
this period to develop a political theory
of
his own, Ludwig von der Marwitz, never used
racial terms. According
to him, nations were separated by language—a spiritual and not a physical
difference—and although he was
violently opposed
to the French Revolu-
tion, he spoke
like Robespierre when
it came to the possible aggression of
one nation against another: "Who aims at expanding his frontiers should be
considered
a
disloyal
betrayer among
the
whole
European
republic
of
states." -'
It was Adam Mueller who insisted on purity of descent as a test
of
nobility, and
it was Haller who went beyond the obvious
fact that the
powerful
rule those deprived of power by
stating
it as a natural law
that
the weak should be dominated by the strong. Noblemen, of course, applauded
enthusiastically when they learned that
their usurpation of power was not
only
legal but
in accordance with natural laws, and
it was
a consequence
of bourgeois definitions that during the course of the nineteenth century they
avoided "mesalliances" more carefully than ever before."
This
insistence on common
tribal origin
as an
essential of nationhood,
formulated by German nationalists during and
after the war of 1814, and
the emphasis
laid by
the romantics on
the innate personality and natural
nobility prepared the way intellectually for race-thinking in Germany. From
the former sprang the organic doctrine of history with
its natural laws; from
the
latter arose at the end of the century the grotesque homunculus of the
superman whose natural destiny
it
is
to
rule
the world. As long
as
these
trends ran
side by
side,
they were but temporary means
of escape from
political
realities. Once welded
together,
they formed
the
very
basis
for
racism
as
a
full-fledged
ideology.
This, however,
did not happen
first
in
Germany, but in France, and was not accomplished by middle-class
intel-
lectuals
but by
a
highly
gifted and
frustrated nobleman,
the Comte
de
Gobineau.

The New Key to History
IN 1853, Count Arthur de Gobineau published his Essai sur Vlnegalite des
Races Hutnaines which, only some
fifty years
later, at the turn of the cen-
tury, was
to become a kind of standard work for race theories
in history.

RACE-THINKING BEFORE RACISM
171
The
first sentence of the four-volume work—"The fall of civilization
is the
most striking and, at the same time, the most obscure of
all phenomena of
history" ^^—indicates clearly the essentially new and modern interest of
its
author,
the new pessimistic mood which pervades
his work and which
is
the ideological force
that was capable of uniting
all previous
factors and
conflicting opinions. True, from time immemorial, mankind has wanted to
know as much as possible about past cultures, fallen empires, extinct peo-
ples; but nobody before Gobineau thought of finding one single reason, one
single
force
according
to which
civilization
always
and everywhere
rises
and
falls. Doctrines of decay seem to have some very intimate connection
with
race-thinking.
It
certainly
is no coincidence
that another early
"be-
liever
in
race," Benjamin
Disraeli, was
equally
fascinated by
the
fall
of
cultures, while on the other hand Hegel, whose philosophy was concerned
in great part with the dialectical law of development in history, was never
interested in the rise and fall of cultures as such or in any law which would
explain the death of nations: Gobineau demonstrated precisely such a law.
Without Darwinism or any other evolutionist theory to influence him,
this
historian boasted
of having introduced
history
into
the family
of natural
sciences,
detected
the
natural
law
of
all
courses
of
events,
reduced
all
spiritual utterances or cultural phenomena to something "that by virtue of
exact science our eyes can see, our ears can hear, our hands can touch."
The most surprising aspect of the theory,
set forth
in the midst of the
optimistic nineteenth century,
is
the
fact
that the author
is fascinated by
the fall and hardly interested in the rise of civilizations. At the time of writing
the Essai Gobineau gave but little thought to the possible use of his theory
as a weapon in actual
politics, and therefore had the courage to draw the
inherent sinister consequences of his law of decay. In contrast to Spengler,
who predicts only the fall of Western culture, Gobineau foresees with "scien-
tific" precision nothing less than the definite disappearance of Man—or,
in
his words, of the human race—from the face of the earth. After four volumes
of rewriting human history, he concludes: "One might be tempted to assign
a total duration of 12 to 14 thousand years to human rule over the earth,
which era is divided into two periods
: the first has passed away and possessed
the youth ...
the second has begun and will witness the declining course
down toward decrepitude."
It has rightly been observed that Gobineau, thirty years before Nietzsche,
was concerned with the problem of "decadence." ^* There
is, however,
this
difference,
that Nietzsche possessed the basic experience of European de-
cadence,
writing
as
he
did
during
the
climax
of
this
movement
with
Baudelaire
in
France,
Swinburne
in England, and Wagner
in Germany,
whereas Gobineau was hardly aware of the variety of the modern taedium
vitae, and must be regarded as the last heir of Boulainvilliers and the French

IMPERIALISM
exiled
nobility
who,
without
psychological
complications,
simply
(and
rightly) feared for the fate of aristocracy as a caste. With a certain naivete
he
accepted
almost
literally
the
eighteenth-century
doctrines
about
the
origin of
the French people:
the bourgeois are the descendants of
Gallic-
Roman slaves, noblemen are Germanic.'- The same is true for his insistence
on
the
international
character
of
nobility. A more modern
aspect
of
his
theories is revealed in the fact that he possibly was an impostor (his French
title being more
than dubious),
that he exaggerated and overstrained
the
older doctrines
until they became frankly ridiculous—he claimed for him-
self a genealogy which led over a Scandinavian pirate to Odin:
"I, too, am
of
the
race
of Gods." " But
his
real importance
is
that
in
the midst
of
progress-ideologies
he
prophesied doom,
the end
of mankind
in
a
slow
natural catastrophe. When Gobineau started
his work,
in the days
of
the
bourgeois king, Louis Philippe, the fate of nobility appeared sealed. Nobihty
no longer needed
to fear the victory of the
Tiers Etat,
it had already oc-
curred and they could only complain. Their distress, as expressed by Gobi-
neau, sometimes comes very near to the great despair of the poets of de-
cadence who,
a few decades
later, sang the
frailty of
all things human
les neiges d'antan, the snows of yesteryear. As far as Gobineau himself was
concerned,
this
affinity
is rather incidental; but
it
is interesting to note that
once
this
affinity was
established, nothing could prevent very
respectable
intellectuals
at the
turn of the century,
like Robert Dreyfus
in France or
Thomas Mann
in Germany, from taking this descendant of Odin seriously.
Long before the horrible and the ridiculous had merged into the humanly
incomprehensible mixture that is the hallmark of our century, the ridiculous
had lost
its power to
kill.
It is also to the peculiar pessimistic mood, to the active despair of the last
decades of the century that Gobineau owed his belated fame. This, however,
does not necessarily mean that he himself was a forerunner of the generation
of "the merry dance of death and trade" (Joseph Conrad). He was neither
a statesman who believed in business nor a poet who praised death. He was
only
a
curious
mixture
of
frustrated nobleman and
romantic
intellectual
who invented racism almost by
accident.
This was when he saw
that he
could not simply accept the old doctrines of the two peoples within France
and
that,
in view of changed circumstances, he had
to revise the old
line
that the best men necessarily are at the top of society. In sad contrast to his
teachers, he had
to explain why
the best men, noblemen, could not even
hope
to regain
their former position. Step by step, he identified the
fall of
his caste with the
fall of France, then of Western civilization, and then of
the whole of mankind. Thus he made that discovery, for which he was so
much admired by later writers and biographers, that the fall of civilizations
is due to a degeneration of race and the decay of race
is due to a mixture
of blood. This implies that in every mixture the lower race
is always dom-

inant. This kind of argumentation, almost commonplace
after the turn of
the century, did not
fit
in with
the progress-doctrines
of Gobineau's con-
temporaries, who
soon
acquired
another
idee
fixe,
the
"survival
of
the
fittest." The
liberal optimism
of
the
victorious bourgeoisie wanted
a new
edition of the might-right theory, not the key to history or the proof of in-
evitable decay. Gobineau tried in vain to get a wider audience by taking a
side
in
the American
slave
issue and by conveniently building
his whole
system on the basic conflict between white and black. He had to wait almost
fifty years to become a success among the elite, and not until the first World
War with
its wave of death-philosophies could his works claim wide popu-
larity-^**
What Gobineau was actually looking for in politics was the definition and
creation
of an
"elite"
to
replace
the
aristocracy.
Instead
of
princes,
he
proposed a "race of princes," the Aryans, who he said were
in danger of
being submerged by the lower non-Aryan classes through democracy. The
concept of race made
it possible
to organize
the "innate personalities" of
German romanticism,
to define them
as members of a natural aristocracy
destined to
rule over
all others.
If race and mixture of races
are
the
all-
determining factors
for the individual—and Gobineau did not assume
the
existence of "pure" breeds—it is possible to pretend that physical superiori-
ties might evolve in every individual no matter what his present social situa-
tion, that every exceptional man belongs to the "true surviving sons of
.
.
.
the Merovings," the "sons of kings." Thanks
to race, an
"elite" would be
formed which could lay claim to the old prerogatives of feudal families, and
this only by
asserting that they
felt
like noblemen;
the acceptance
of the
race ideology as such would become conclusive proof that an individual was
"well-bred,"
that "blue blood" ran through
his
veins and
that a superior
origin implied superior rights. From one political event, therefore, the decline
of the nobility, the Count drew two contradictory consequences—the decay
of the human race and the formation of a new natural aristocracy. But he did
not live to see the practical application of his teachings which resolved their
inherent contradictions—the new
race-aristocracy
actually began
to
effect
the "inevitable" decay of mankind in a supreme effort to destroy
it.
Following the example of his forerunners, the exiled French noblemen,
Gobineau saw
in
his
race-elite not only a bulwark against democracy but
also
against
the "Canaan monstrosity"
of
patriotism.^'* And
since France
still happened
to be
the
"patrie" par
excellence,

still based upon the essential
equality of men, and

all, she was
the only country of his

in which even people with black skin could enjoy

it was
natural
for Gobineau
to give
allegiance not
to

people, but to
the English, and
later,
after the French defeat of 1871,
to the Germans.^"
Nor can
this lack of dignity be called accidental and
this opportunism an
unhappy
coincidence. The
old
saying
that
nothing

like

reckons with people who are used to various and arbitrary opinions. Ideolo-
gists who pretend

It would be absurd to ask people to be reliable who by their very convictions
must justify any given situation.
It must be conceded that up to the time when the Nazis, in establishing
themselves
as a
race-elite, frankly bestowed
their contempt on
all peoples,
including the German, French racism was the most consistent, for
it never
fell
into
the weakness
of
patriotism.
(This
attitude
did not change even
during the
last war; true, the "essence aryenne" no longer was a monopoly
of the Germans but rather of the Anglo-Saxons, the Swedes, and the Nor-
mans, but nation, patriotism, and law were
still considered to be "prejudices,
fictitious and nominal values.") " Even Taine believed firmly in the superior

gentsia with new and exciting psychological toys to play with on the great
playground of history. Gobineau's
"fils des rois" were close relatives of the
romantic heroes,
saints, geniuses and supermen of the
late nineteenth cen-
tury, all of whom can hardly hide their German romantic origin. The inherent
irresponsibility of romantic opinions received a new stimulant from Gobi-
neau's mixture of races, because
this mixture showed a historical event of
the past which could be traced in the depths of one's own self. This meant
that inner experiences could be given historical significance, that one's own
self had become the battlefield of history. "Since I read the Essai, every time
some conflict stirred up the hidden sources of my being,
I have
felt that a
relentless battle went on in my soul, the battle between the black, the yellow,
the Semite and
the Aryans." ^^

IV:
The "Rights of Englishmen"
vs. the Rights of Men
WHILE THE SEEDS
of German race-thinking were planted during the Na-
poleonic
wars,
the beginnings
of
the
later English development appeared
during
the French Revolution and may be
traced back
to
the man who
violently denounced
it
as
the "most
astonishing
[crisis]
that has
hitherto
happened
in
the world"—to Edmund Burke. *^ The tremendous
influence
his work has exercised not only on English but also on German
political
thought
is well known. The fact, however, must be stressed because of re-
semblances between German and English race-thinking as contrasted with
the French brand. These resemblances stem from the fact that both coun-
tries had defeated the Tricolor and therefore showed a certain tendency to
discriminate
against
the
ideas
of
Liberte-Egalite-Fraternite
as
foreign
in-
ventions. Social inequality being the basis of English society,
British Con-
servatives
felt not
a
little uncomfortable when
it came
to
the
"rights
of
men." According to opinions widely held by nineteenth-century Tories,
in-
equality belonged to the English national character. Disraeli found "some-
thing better than the Rights of Men in the rights of Englishmen" and to Sir
James Stephen "few
things
in history [seemed] so beggarly
as
the degree
to which the French allowed themselves to be excited about such things." "
This
is one of the reasons why they could afford
to develop race-thinking

IMPERIALISM
along national
lines
until
the end
of the nineteenth century, whereas
the
same opinions
in France showed their true antinational face from the very
beginning.
Burke's main argument against
the
"abstract principles" of the French
Revolution
is contained
in
the following sentence:
"It has been
the
uni-
form
policy
of our
constitution
to
claim and
assert our
liberties,
as
an
entailed inheritance derived to us from our forefathers, and to be transmitted
to our posterity; as an estate specially belonging to the people of this king-
dom, without any reference whatever
to any other more general or prior
right." The concept of inheritance, applied to the very nature of liberty, has
been
the
ideological
basis
from
which
English
nationalism
received
its
curious touch of race-feeling ever since the French Revolution. Formulated
by a middle-class writer,
it signified the direct acceptance of the feudal con-
cept of
liberty
as
the sum
total
of
privileges
inherited together with
title
and land. Without encroaching upon the rights of the privileged class within
the English nation, Burke enlarged the principle of these privileges
to
in-
clude
the whole
English
people,
establishing them
as
a kind
of
nobility
among nations. Hence he drew
his contempt for those who claimed
their
franchise as the rights of men, rights which he saw
fit to claim only as "the
rights of Englishmen."
In England
nationalism
developed
without
serious
attacks on
the
old
feudal classes. This has been possible because the English gentry, from the
seventeenth century on and in ever-increasing numbers, had assimilated the
higher ranks of the bourgeoisie, so that sometimes even the common man
could attain
the position of a
lord. By
this process much
of the ordinary
caste
arrogance
of
nobility was
taken away and
a considerable
sense
of
responsibility for the nation as a whole was created; but by the same token,
feudal concepts and mentality could influence the political ideas of the lower
classes more
easily than elsewhere. Thus,
the concept of inheritance was
accepted almost unchanged and applied
to the entire British "stock." The
consequence
of
this
assimilation
of noble standards was
that
the English
brand of race-thinking was almost obsessed with
inheritance
theories and
their modern equivalent, eugenics.
Ever since the European peoples made practical attempts to include
all
the peoples of the earth
in
their conception of humanity,
they have been
irritated by the great physical differences between themselves and the peo-
ples
they found on other continents.'" The
eighteenth-century enthusiasm
for the diversity in which the all-present identical nature of man and reason
could find expression provided a rather thin cover of argument to the crucial
question, whether the Christian tenet of the unity and equaUty of
all men,
based upon common descent from one original set of parents, would be kept
** A significant
if moderate echo of this inner bewilderment can be found in many
an eighteenth-century traveling report. Voltaire thought
it important enough to make a
special
note
in
his
Dictionnaire Philosophique: "We have
seen, moreover, how
dif-
ferent the races are who inhabit
this globe, and how
great must have been
the
sur-
prise of the first Negro and the
first white man who met"
(Article: Homme).

RACE-THINKING BEFORE RACISM

in the hearts of men who were faced with tribes which, as far as we know,
never had found by themselves any adequate expression of human reason
or human passion
in either cultural deeds or popular customs, and which
had developed human institutions only to a very low level. This new prob-
lem which appeared on the historical scene of Europe and America with the
more
intimate knowledge
of African
tribes had
already caused, and
this
especially
in America and some
British possessions,
a relapse
into forms
of social organization which were thought to have been definitely liquidated
by
Christianity. But even
slavery, though
actually established on
a
strict
racial
basis,
did
not make
the
slave-holding
peoples
race-conscious
be-
fore the nineteenth century. Throughout
the eighteenth century, American
slave-holders themselves considered
it a temporary institution and wanted to
abolish
it gradually. Most of them probably would have said with Jefferson:
"I tremble when
I think that God
is just."
In France, where
the problem
of black
tribes had been met with
the
desire to assimilate and educate, the great scientist Leclerc de Buffon had
given a first classification of races which, based upon the European peoples
and classifying
all others by
their differences, had taught equality by
strict
juxtaposition.^^ The eighteenth century, to use Tocqueville's admirably pre-
cise phrase, "believed in the variety of races but in the unity of the human
species." " In Germany, Herder had refused
to apply the "ignoble word"
race to men, and even the first cultural historian of mankind to make use of
the classification of different species, Gustav Klemm,"
still respected the idea
of mankind as the general framework for his investigations.
But
in America and England, where people had
to solve a problem of
living together
after the abolition of slavery, things were considerably
less
easy.
With
the
exception
of
South
Africa—a
country
which
influenced
Western racism only after the "scramble for Africa"
in the eighties—these
nations were the first to deal with the race problem in practical politics. The
abolition of slavery sharpened inherent conflicts instead of finding a solution
for existing serious
difficulties. This was especially
true
in England where
the "rights of Englishmen" were not replaced by a new political orientation
which might have declared the rights of men. The
abolition of slavery
in
the British possessions in 1834 and the discussion preceding the American
Civil War,
therefore, found
in England
a highly confused public opinion
which was
fertile
soil for the various
naturalistic doctrines which arose
in
those decades.
The
first of these was represented by
the
polygenists who,
challenging
the Bible as a book of pious
lies, denied any relationship between human
"races";
their main
achievement was
the
destruction
of
the
idea
of
the
natural law as the uniting Hnk between
all men and
all peoples. Although
it did not stipulate predestined racial superiority, polygenism arbitrarily
iso-
lated all peoples from one another by the deep abyss of the physical impos-
es //w/o/>^ Naturelle,

sibility of human
understanding and communication. Polygenism
explains
why "Hast
is East and West
is West; And never the twain shall meet," and
helped much
to prevent intermarriage
in
the colonies and
to promote
dis-
crimination
against
individuals of mixed
origin. According
to polygenism,
these people are not true human beings; they belong to no single race, but
arc
a kind of monster whose "every
cell
is
the
theater of
a
civil war." *^
Lasting
as
the
influence of polygenism on
English race-thinking proved
to be
in the long run,
in the nineteenth century
it was soon to be beaten in
the
field of public opinion by another docuine. This doctrine
also started
from the principle of inheritance but added to
it the political principle of the
nineteenth century, progress, whence
it arrived at the opposite but far more
convincing conclusion
that man
is
related not only
to man but
to animal
life, that the existence of lower races shows clearly that gradual differences
alone
separate man and
beast and
that a powerful
struggle
for existence
dominates
all
living
things. Darwinism was
especially strengthened by the
fact that
it followed the path of the old might-right doctrine. But while this
doctrine, when used exclusively by aristocrats, had spoken the proud language
of conquest,
it was now translated into the rather bitter language of people
who had known
the
struggle for daily bread and fought
their way
to
the
relative security of upstarts.
Darwinism met with such overwhelming success because
it provided, on
the basis of inheritance, the ideological weapons for race as well as class rule
and could be used
for,
as
well
as
against, race discrimination.
Politically
speaking, Darwinism as such was neutral, and
it has led, indeed, to all kinds
of pacifism and cosmopolitanism
as
well
as
to
the sharpest forms
of im-
perialistic
ideologies.
•''-'
In
the
seventies
and
eighties
of
the
last
century,
Darwinism was
still almost exclusively
in the hands of the
utilitarian
anti-
colonial party
in England. And the
first philosopher of evolution, Herbert
Spencer, who treated sociology
as
part of biology, believed natural
selec-
tion
to benefit the evolution of mankind and
to result in everlasting peace.
For
political
discussion, Darwinism
offered two
important
concepts:
the
struggle for existence with
optimistic
assertion of the necessary and auto-
matic "survival of the
fittest," and the indefinite possibilities which seemed
to
lie in the evolution of man out of animal
life and which started the new
"science" of eugenics.
The doctrine of the necessary survival of the
fittest, with
its implication
that the top layers in society eventually are the "fittest," died as the conquest
doctrine had died, namely, at the moment when the ruling classes in England
or the English domination in colonial possessions were no longer absolutely
secure, and when
it became highly doubtful whether those who were "fittest"
today would
still be the
fittest tomorrow. The other part of Darwinism, the
genealogy of man from animal
life, unfortunately survived. Eugenics prom-
ised to overcome the troublesome uncertainties of the survival doctrine ac-

cording to which
it was impossible either to predict who would turn out to
be the
fittest or to provide the means for the nations to develop everlasting
fitness. This possible consequence of applied eugenics was stressed
in Ger-
many in the twenties as a reaction to Spengler's Decline of the West.^" The
process of selection had only to be changed from a natural necessity which
worked behind
the backs
of men
into an
"artificial," consciously
applied
physical
tool.
Bestiality had always been
inherent
in eugenics, and Ernst
Haeckel's early remark that mercy-death would save "useless expenses for
family and state"
is quite characteristic.^^ Finally the
last disciples of Dar-
winism in Germany decided to leave the field of scientific research altogether,
to forget about the search for the missing link between man and ape, and
started instead their practical efforts to change man into what the Darwinists
thought an ape
is.
But before Nazism,
in the course of
its
totalitarian policy, attempted
to
change man into a beast, there were numerous efforts to develop him on a
strictly hereditary basis into a god." Not only Herbert Spencer, but
all the
early evolutionists and Darwinists "had as strong a faith in humanity's angelic
future
as
in man's simian
origin." "

stresses the strong practical morality of
all
these early materialists. He explains "this curious divorce of morals from beliefs" by
"what
later
sociologists have
described
as
a

(p.
130).
This
explanation,
however, appears rather weak
if one
recalls that other materialists who,
like Haeckel
in Germany
or Vacher
de
Lapouge
in
France,
had
left
the
calm

other hand,
their contemporaries who were
not

their
materialistic
doctrines, such as Barres and Co.
in France, were very practical adherents of the per-
verse
brutality which swept France during the Dreyfus
Affair. The sudden decay of
morals in the Western world seems to be caused less by an autonomous development of
certain "ideas" than by a series of new
political events and new
political and
social
problems which confronted a bewildered and confused humanity.
^* Such was the title of the widely read book of Fr. Galton, published in 1869, which
caused a flood of literature about the same topic in the following decades.

intellectuals

their dreams
of
re-
placing

classes

a new

nonpolitical
means. At the end of the century, writers treated
political topics
in terms
of biology and zoology
as a matter of course, and zoologists wrote "Bio-
logical Views of our Foreign Policy"
as though they had detected an
in-
fallible guide for statesmen.^' All of them put forward new ways to control
and regulate the "survival of the fittest" in accordance with the national in-
terests of the English people/"
The most dangerous
aspect of
these
evolutionist doctrines
is
that they
combined
the inheritance concept with the insistence on personal achieve-
ment and
individual character which had been so important for
the
self-
respect
of
the
nineteenth-century middle
class. This middle
class wanted
scientists who could prove that the great men, not the aristocrats, were the
true
representatives of
the
nation,
in whom
the "genius
of the race" was
personified.
These
scientists
provided
an
ideal
escape from
poHtical
re-
sponsibility when they "proved"
the early statement of Benjamin
Disraeli
that the great man
is "the personification of race,
its choice exemplar." The
development of
this
"genius" found
its
logical end when another
disciple
of evolutionism simply declared: "The Englishman
is the Overman and the
history of England is the history of his evolution." "
It
is as significant for English as it was for German race-thinking that
it
originated among middle-class writers and not the nobility, that
it was born
of the desire to extend the benefits of noble standards to
all classes and that
it was nourished by true national feelings. In this respect, Carlyle's ideas on
the genius and hero were really more the weapons of a "social reformer"
than
the
doctrines
of
the "Father of
British ImperiaUsm,"
a
very
unjust
accusation, indeed.'* His hero worship which earned him wide audiences in
both England and
in Germany, had
the same
sources
as
the personahty
worship of German romanticism. It was the same assertion and glorification
of the innate greatness of the individual character independent of his social
environment. Among the men who influenced the colonial movement from

RACE-THINKING BEFORE RACISM
181
the middle of the nineteenth century until the outbreak of actual imperiaUsm
at
its end, not one has escaped the influence of Carlyle, but not one can be
accused of preaching outspoken racism. Carlyle himself, in his essay on the
"Nigger Question" is concerned with means to help the West Indies produce
"heroes." Charles Dilke, whose Greater Britain (1869)
is sometimes taken
as the beginning of imperialism,^^ was an advanced radical who glorified the
English colonists as being part of the British nation, as against those who
would look down upon them and their lands as mere colonies.
J. R. Seeley,
whose Expansion of England (1883)
sold 80,000 copies in
less than two
years,
still respects the Hindus as a foreign people and distinguishes them
clearly from "barbarians." Even Froude, whose admiration for the Boers,
the
first white people
to be converted
clearly
to
the
tribal philosophy
of
racism, might appear suspect, opposed too many
rights for South Africa
because
"self-government
in
South
Africa meant
the government
of
the
natives by the European colonists and that
is not self-government." *"
Very much as in Germany, English nationalism was born and stimulated
by
a middle
class which had never
entirely emancipated
itself from
the
nobility and
therefore
bore
the
first germs
of
race-thinking.
But
unlike
Germany, whose lack of unity made necessary an ideological wall
to sub-
stitute for historical or geographical facts, the British Isles were completely
separated from the surrounding world by natural frontiers and England as
a nation had to devise a theory of unity among people who lived in far-flung
colonies beyond the seas, separated from the mother country by thousands
of miles. The only link between them was common descent, common origin,
common language. The separation of the United States had shown that these
links
in themselves do not guarantee domination; and not only America,
other
colonies
too,
though
not
with
the same
violence,
showed
strong
tendencies toward developing along
dififerent constitutional
lines from
the
mother country. In order to save these former British nationals, Dilke,
in-
fluenced by Carlyle, spoke of "Saxondom," a word that seemed able to win
back even the people of the United States, to whom one-third of his book
is
devoted. Being a radical, Dilke could act as though the War of Independence
had not been a war between two nations, but the English form of eighteenth-
century
civil war,
in which he
belatedly sided with
the Republicans. For
here lies one of the reasons for the surprising fact that social reformers and
radicals were the promoters of nationalism in England: they wanted to keep
the colonies not only because they thought they were necessary outlets for
the lower classes; they actually wanted to retain the influence on the mother
country which these more radical sons of the British
Isles exercised. This
motif is strong with Froude, who wished "to retain the colonies because he
thought
it possible to reproduce in them a simpler state of society and a
nobler way of life than were possible in industrial England," ^^ and
it had a

definite impact on Scclcy's Expansion of England: "When we have accus-
tomed ourselves to contemplate the whole Empire together and we call
it all
lingland \se shall see that there too
is a United States." Whatever later polit-
ical writers may nave used "Saxondom" for, in Dilkc's work
it had a genuine
political meaning for a nation that was no longer held together by a limited
country. 'The idea which in
all the length of my travels has been at once my
fellow and my guide—the key wherewith
to unlock
the hidden
things
of
strange new lands— is
the
conception ...
of
the
grandeur
of our
race
already girdling the earth, which
it
is destined perhaps, eventually to over-
spread"
(Preface). For
Dilke, common
origin,
inheritance,
"grandeur
of
race" were neither physical facts nor the key to history but a much-needed
guide
in the present world, the only reliable link in a boundless space.
Because English colonists had spread
all over the earth,
it happened that
the most dangerous concept of nationalism, the idea of "national mission,"
was
especially
strong
in
England. Although
national mission
as such
de-
veloped for a long while untinged by racial influences in all countries where
peoples aspired
to nationhood,
it proved
finally
to have a peculiarly close
aflinity to race-thinking. The above-quoted English nationalists may be con-
sidered borderline cases
in the light of later experience. In themselves, they
were not more harmful than, for example, Auguste Comte in France when
he expressed the hope for a united, organized, regenerated humanity under
the leadership
presidence—of France.''- They do not give up the idea of
mankind, though they think England
is the supreme guarantee for humanity.
They could not help but ovcrstress
this nationalistic concept because of
its

sion
idea,
a
dissolution which
for English
politics was not
a propagated
ideology but an established fact with which every statesman had to reckon.
What separates them definitely from
later racists
is that none of them was
ever seriously concerned with discrimination against other peoples as lower
races,
if only
for
the
reason
that
the
countries
they were
talking
about,
Canada and Australia, were almost empty and had no serious population
problem.
It
is, therefore, not by accident that the
first English statesman who re-
peatedly
stressed his
belief in races and race superiority
as a determining
factor of history and politics was a man who without particular interest in
the colonies and the English colonists—"the colonial deadweight which we
do
not govern"—wanted
to
extend
British
imperial power
to Asia
and,
indeed,
forcefully
strengthened
the
position
of Great
Britain
in
the
only
colony
with
a
grave
population and
cultural problem.
It was Benjamin
Disraeli who made
the Queen
of England

of India; he was
the
first English statesman who regarded
India
as
the
cornerstone
of an
Empire and who wanted
to cut
the
ties which
linked
the English people
to the nations of the Continent."^ Thereby he

stones for a fundamental change in
British
rule
in India. This colony had
been governed with the usual ruthlessness of conquerors—men whom Burke
had called "the breakers of the law in India." It was now to receive a care-
fully planned administration which aimed at the establishment of a permanent
government by administrative measures. This experiment has brought Eng-
land very
close
to
the danger against which Burke had warned,
that
the
"breakers of the law in India" might become "the makers of law for Eng-
land." "* For all those, to whom there was "no transaction in the history of
England of which we have more just cause to be proud
.
.
.
than the es-
tablishment
of
the
Indian Empire,"
held
Hberty and
equality
to be
"big
names for a small thing."
""^
The policy introduced by Disraeli signified the establishment of an exclu-
sive caste in a foreign country whose only function was rule and not coloniza-
tion. For the realization of this conception which Disraeli did not live to see
accomplished, racism would indeed be an indispensable tool. It foreshadowed
the menacing transformation of the people from a nation into an "unmixed
race
of
a
first-rate organization"
that
felt
itself
to be
"the
aristocracy
of
nature"—to repeat in Disraeli's own words quoted above.""
What we have followed so
far
is
the story of an opinion
in which we
see only now,
after
all the
terrible experiences of our times, the
first dawn
of racism. But although racism has revived elements of race-thinking in every
country,
it
is not the history of an idea endowed by some "immanent logic"
with which we were concerned. Race-thinking was a source of convenient
arguments for varying political conflicts, but
it never possessed any kind of
monopoly over the political
life of the respective nations;
it sharpened and
exploited existing conflicting interests or existing poHtical problems, but
it
never created new
conflicts or produced new categories of
political
think-
ing. Racism sprang from experiences and political constellations which were
still unknown and would have been
utterly strange even
to such devoted
defenders
of "race"
as Gobineau or Disraeh. There
is an
abyss between
the men of brilliant and
facile conceptions and men
of
brutal deeds and
active
bestiality which no
intellectual explanation
is
able
to
bridge.
It
is
highly probable that the thinking in terms of race would have disappeared
in due time together with other irresponsible opinions of the nineteenth cen-
tury,
if the "scramble for Africa" and the new era of imperialism had not
exposed Western humanity
to new and shocking experiences. Imperialism

"If ever Europe by her shortsightedness
falls into an inferior and exhausted
state, for England there
will remain an
illustrious
future"
{Ibid.,

would have necessitated
the invention of racism
as the only possible "ex-
planation" and excuse for its deeds, even
if no race-thinking had ever existed
in the civilized world.
Since, however, race-thinking did
exist,
it proved to be a powerful help
to racism. The very existence of an opinion which could boast of a certain
tradition served
to hide
the
destructive
forces
of the new doctrine which,
without this appearance of national respectability or the seeming sanction of
tradition,
might have
disclosed
its
utter
incompatibility
with
all Western
political and moral standards
of
the
past, even before
it was allowed
to
destroy the comity of European nations.

CHAPTER SEVEN
Race and Bureaucracy
Two NEW DEVICES for political organization and rule over foreign peoples
were discovered during the first decades of imperialism. One was race as
a principle of the body politic, and the other bureaucracy as a principle of
foreign domination. Without race as a substitute for the nation, the scramble
for Africa and the investment fever might well have remained the purpose-
less "dance of death and trade" (Joseph Conrad) of all gold rushes. Without
bureaucracy as a substitute for government, the British possession of India
might well have been left to the recklessness of the "breakers of law in India"
(Burke) without changing the political climate of an entire era.
Both discoveries were actually made on the Dark Continent. Race was the
emergency explanation of human
beings whom no European or
civilized
man could understand and whose humanity so frightened and humiliated
the immigrants
that they no longer cared
to belong
to
the same human
species. Race was
the Boers' answer
to
the overwhelming monstrosity
of
Africa—a whole
continent populated and overpopulated by
savages—an
explanation
of
the madness which grasped and
illuminated them
like
"a
flash of lightning in a serene sky:
'Exterminate
all the brutes.' "
^ This an-
swer resulted
in
the most
terrible massacres
in recent
history,
the Boers'
extermination
of Hottentot
tribes,
the
wild murdering by
Carl
Peters
in
German Southeast Africa, the decimation of the peaceful Congo population
—from 20 to 40 million reduced to 8 million people; and
finally, perhaps
worst of
all,
it resulted
in the triumphant introduction of such means
of
pacification
into
ordinary,
respectable
foreign
policies. What
head
of
a
civilized state would ever before have uttered the exhortation of William II
to
a German expeditionary
contingent
fighting
the Boxer
insurrection
in
1900:
"Just
as
the Huns
a thousand years
ago, under the leadership
of
Attila, gained a reputation by virtue of which they
still
live
in history, so
may the German name become known in such a manner in China that no
Chinese will ever again dare to look askance at a German." ^
1 Joseph Conrad, "Heart of Darkness" in Yot4th and Other Tales,
1902,
is the most
illuminating work on actual race experience
in Africa.
^Quoted from Carlton
J. Hayes, A
Generation of Materialism, New York,
1941,
p. 338.—An even worse case
is of course that of Leopold
II of Belgium, responsible
for the blackest pages
in the history of Africa. "There was only one man who could
be accused of the outrages which reduced the native population
[of the Congo] from
between 20
to 40
million
in
1890
to
8,500,000
in 1911—Leopold
II."

.«g
IMPERIALISM
While
race, whether as
a home-grown ideology
in Europe or an emer-
gency explanation for shattering experiences, has always attracted the worst
elements m Western
civilization, bureaucracy was discovered by and
first
attracted the
best, and sometimes even the most clear-sighted, strata of the
i:uro|x-an
intelligentsia.
1 he administrator who ruled by reports
' and
de-
crees
in more hostile secrecy than any oriental despot grew out of a
tradi-
tion of
military
discipline
in
the midst of ruthless and
lawless men;
for a
long time he had
lived by the honest, earnest boyhood ideals of a modern
knight
in shining armor sent
to protect helpless and primitive people. And
he
fulfilled
this
task, for better or worse,
as long as he moved
in a world
dominated by
the old
"trinity—war,
trade and piracy" (Goethe), and not
in a complicated game of far-reaching investment policies which demanded
the domination of one people, not as before for the sake of
its own
riches,
but for the sake of another country's wealth. Bureaucracy was the organiza-
tion of the great game of expansion
in which every area was considered a
stepping-stone
to further involvements and every people an instrument for
further conquest.
Although
in
the end
racism and bureaucracy proved
to be
interrelated
in many ways, they were discovered and developed independently. No one
who
in one way or the other was implicated
in
their perfection ever came
to realize the full range of potentialities of power accumulation and destruc-
tion
that
this combination
alone
provided.
Lord
Cromer, who
in
Egypt
changed
from
an
ordinary
British
charge
d'affaires
into
an
imperialist
bureaucrat, would no more have dreamed of combining administration with
mxssacre
("administrative massacres" as Carthill bluntly put
it forty years
later), than the race fanatics of South Africa thought of organizing massacres
for the purpose of establishing a circumscribed, rational political community
(as the Nazis did in the extermination camps).
I:
The Phantom World of the Dark Continent
vv TO THE END of the
last century, the colonial enterprises of the seafaring
European peoples produced two outstanding forms of achievement:
in
re-
cently discovered and
sparsely populated
territories,
the founding
of new
settlements which adopted
the legal and political institutions of the mother
country; and
in well-known though exotic countries in the midst of foreign
peoples, the establishment of maritime and trade stations whose only func-
tion was
to
facilitate the never very peaceful exchange of the treasures of
the world. Colonization took place
in America and Australia,
the two con-
Uncnts that, without a culture and a history of their own, had fallen into the
hands of Europeans. Trade
stations were characteristic
of Asia where
for
centuries Europeans had shown no ambition
for permanent
rule or
inten-
Ti.' ^*^ A. Canhills description of the "Indian system of government by reports"

tions
of
conquest,
decimation
of
the
native
population,
and
permanent
settlement.* Both forms
of
overseas
enterprise
evolved
in
a
long
steady
process which extended over almost four centuries, during which the settle-
ments gradually achieved independence, and the possession of trade stations
shifted among the nations according to
their relative weakness or strength
in Europe.
The only continent Europe had not touched
in the course of
its colonial
history was the Dark Continent of Africa.
Its northern shores, populated by
Arabic peoples and tribes, were well known and had belonged to the Euro-
pean sphere of influence in one way or another since the days of antiquity.
Too well populated to attract
settlers, and too poor to be exploited, these
regions
suffered
all kinds of foreign
rule and anarchic
neglect, but oddly
enough never—after the decline of the Egyptian Empire and the destruction
of Carthage—achieved authentic independence and reliable poHtical organ-
ization. European countries tried time and again,
it
is true, to reach beyond
the Mediterranean
to impose
their
rule on Arabic lands and
their Chris-
tianity on Moslem peoples, but they never attempted to treat North African
territories like overseas possessions. On the contrary, they frequently aspired
to incorporate them into the respective mother country. This age-old tradi-
tion,
still followed
in recent times by
Italy and France, was broken
in the
eighties when England went into Egypt to protect the Suez Canal without
any
intention
either
of conquest
or
incorporation. The
point
is
not
that
Egypt was wronged but that England (a nation that did not lie on the shores
of the Mediterranean) could not possibly have been interested in Egypt as
such, but needed her only because there were treasures in India.
While imperialism changed Egypt from
a country occasionally coveted
for her own sake into a military station for India and a stepping-stone for
further expansion, the exact opposite happened to South Africa. Since the
seventeenth
century,
the
significance
of the Cape of Good Hope had de-
pended upon India, the center of colonial wealth; any nation that established
trade stations there needed a maritime station on the Cape, which was then
abandoned when trade in India was liquidated. At the end of the eighteenth
century, the British East India Company defeated Portugal, Holland, and
France and won a trade monopoly in India; the occupation of South Africa
followed as a matter of course.
If imperialism had simply continued the old
trends of colonial trade (which
is so frequently mistaken for imperiahsm),
England would have liquidated her position in South Africa with the opening
of
tlie Suez Canal in
1869.^ Although today South Africa belongs
to

* It
is important to bear
in mind that colonization of America and Australia was
accompanied by comparatively
short periods of cruel
liquidation because of the
na-

weakness, whereas
"in

genesis
of modern
South
African
society
it
is of
the
greatest
importance
to know
that
the
land beyond
the
Cape's borders was not the open land which lay before the Australian squatter.
It was
already an area of settlement, of settlement by a great Bantu population." See C. W.

Commonwealth,
it was always different from the other dominions;
fertility
and sparscncss of population, the main prerequisites for definite settlement,
were lacking
and a sinulc clfort
to
settle 5,000 unemployed Englishmen
at
the beginning of the nineteenth century proved
a
failure. Not only did
the
streams of emigrants from the
British
Isles consistently avoid South Africa
throughout
the nineteenth century, but South Africa
is the only dominion
from which a steady stream of emigrants has gone back to England in recent
times.*
South
Africa,
which
became
the
"culture-bed
of
Imperialism"
(Damce), was never claimed by England's most radical defenders of "Saxon-
dom" and
it did not figure
in the visions of her most romantic dreamers of
an Asiatic Empire. Th^s in
itself shows how small the real influence of pre-
imperialist colonial enterprise and overseas settlement was on the develop-
ment
of
imperialism
itself.
If
the Cape
colony had remained
within
the
framework
of
prc-imperialist
policies,
it would have been abandoned
at
the exact moment when
it actually became all-important.
Although the discoveries of gold mines and diamond fields in the seventies
and eighties would have had
little consequence
in themselves
if they had
not accidentally acted as a catalytic agent for imperialist forces,
it remains
remarkable
that the imperialists' claim
to have found a permanent solution
to the problem of superfluity was
initially motivated by a rush for the most
superfluous raw material on earth. Gold hardly has a place in human produc-
tion and
is
of no importance compared
with
iron,
coal,
oil, and
rubber;
instead,
it
is the most ancient symbol of mere wealth. In
its uselessness
in
industrial
production
it
bears
an
ironical
resemblance
to
the
superfluous
money that financed the digging of gold and to the superfluous men who did
the digging. To the imperialists' pretense of having discovered a permanent
savior for a decadent society and antiquated political organization,
it added
its own
pretense
of
apparently
eternal
stability
and
independence
of
all
functional determinants.
It was significant that a society about
to part with
all
traditional
absolute values began
to look
for an
absolute value
in
the
world of economics where, indeed, such a thing does not and cannot exist,
since everything
is
functional by
definition. This
delusion
of an
absolute
value has made the production of gold since ancient times

adventurers, gamblers,
criminals,
of elements
outside
the pale
of normal,
sane
society. The new turn
in the South African gold rush was
that here
the
luck-hunters were
not
distinctly
outside
civilized
society
but, on
the
contrary, very clearly a by-product of this society, an inevitable residue of
the
capitalist system and even the representatives of an economy
that
re-
lentlessly produced a superfluity of men and capital.
The superfluous men, "the Bohemians of the four continents" ^ who came
rushing down to the Cape,
still had much
in common with the old adven-
turers. They too
felt "Ship me somewheres east of Suez where the best
is
like the worst, / Where there aren't no Ten Commandments, an' a man can
raise
a
thirst." The
difference was
not
their
morality or immorality, but
rather that the decision to join this crowd "of all nations and colors"
* was
no longer up to them; that they had not stepped out of society but had been
spat out by
it; that they were not enterprising beyond the permitted limits
of civilization but simply victims without use or function. Their only choice
had been
a negative
one,
a
decision
against
the
workers' movements,
in
which the best of the superfluous men or of those who were threatened with
superfluity estabhshed a kind of countersociety through which men could
find
their way back into a human world of fellowship and purpose. They
were nothing of their own making, they were
like
living symbols of what
had happened to them, living abstractions and witnesses of the absurdity of
human institutions. They were not individuals like the old adventurers, they
were the shadows of events with which they had nothing to do.
Like Mr. Kurtz in Conrad's "Heart of Darkness," they were "hollow to
the core," "reckless without hardihood, greedy without audacity and cruel
without courage." They believed in nothing and "could get (themselves)
to
believe
anything—anything." Expelled from
a world with accepted
social
values, they had been thrown back upon themselves and
still had nothing
to fall back upon except, here and there, a streak of talent which made them
as dangerous as Kurtz if they were ever allowed to return to their homelands.
For the only talent that could possibly burgeon
in
their hollow souls was
the gift of fascination which makes a "splendid leader of an extreme party."
The more gifted were walking incarnations of resentment like the German
Carl Peters
(possibly the model for Kurtz), who openly admitted
that he
"was fed up with being counted among the pariahs and wanted to belong to
a master race." ^ But gifted or not, they were
all "game for anything from
pitch and
toss
to wilful murder" and
to them
their fellow-men were "no
more one way or another than that fly there." Thus they brought with them,
or they
learned
quickly,
the code
of manners which
befitted
the coming
type of murderer to whom the only unforgivable sin is to lose his temper.
There were, to be sure, authentic gentlemen among them, like Mr. Jones
of Conrad's Victory, who out of boredom were willing to pay any price to

inhabit the "world of hazard and adventure," or
like Mr. Heyst, who was
drunk with contempt for everything human until he drifted "like a detached
leaf
.
.
.
without
ever
catching on
to
anything." They
were
irresistibly
attracted by a world where everything was a joke, which could teach them
"the
Cireat Joke"
that
is "the mastery of despair." The
perfect gentleman
and the perfect scoundrel came
to know each other well in the "great wild
jungle
without
law,"
and
they
found
themselves
"well-matched
in
their
enormous dissimilarity, identical souls
in difTcrent disguises." We have seen
the behavior of high society during the Dreyfus Affair and watched Disraeli
discover the social relationship between vice and crime; here, too, we have
essentially the same story of high society falling in love with
its own under-
world, and of the criminal feeling elevated when by civilized coldness,
the
avoidance of "unnecessary
exertion," and good manners he
is allowed
to
create a vicious, refined atmosphere around his crimes. This refinement, the
very contrast between the brutality of the crime and the manner of carrying
it out, becomes the bridge of deep understanding between himself and
the
perfect gentleman. But what,
after
all, took decades to achieve
in Europe,
because
of
the delaying
effect of
social
ethical
values, exploded with
the
suddenness of a short circuit in the phantom world of colonial adventure.
Outside
all social restraint and hypocrisy, against the backdrop of native
life, the gentleman and the criminal
felt not only the closeness of men who
share the same color of skin, but the impact of a world of infinite possibili-
ties for crimes committed in the spirit of play, for the combination of horror
and
laughter,
that
is
for
the
full
realization
of
their own
phantom-like
existence. Native
life lent these ghostlike events a seeming guarantee against
all consequences because anyhow
it looked to these men like a "mere play of
shadows. A
play of shadows,
the dominant race could walk through un-
aflectcd and disregarded
in
the pursuit
of
its incomprehensible aims and
needs."
The
world
of
native
savages was
a
perfect
setting
for men who had
escaped the reality of civilization. Under a merciless sun, surrounded by an
entirely hostile nature, they were confronted with human beings who, living
without
the
future of a purpose and the past of an accomplishment, were
as incomprehensible
as
the inmates of a madhouse. "The
prehistoric man
was
cursing
us,
praying
to
us, welcoming
us—who could
tell? We were
cut
off from
the comprehension
of our surroundings; we
glided
past
like
phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be, before
an enthusiastic outbreak
in a madhouse. We could not understand because
we were too far and could not remember, because we were traveling in the
night of
first
ages, of those ages that are gone leaving hardly a sign—and
no
memories. The
earth seemed
unearthly, ... and
the men ... No,
they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of
it—this sus-
picion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled
and
leaped, and spun, and made horrid
faces; but what
thrilled you was
just the thought of their humanity—like yours—the thought of your remote
kmship with this wild and passionate uproar" ("Heart of Darkness").

RACE AND BUREAUCRACY
191
It is strange that, historically speaking, the existence of "prehistoric men"
had so little influence on Western man before the scramble for Africa.
It
is,
however,
a matter of record
that nothing much had happened
as
long
as
savage tribes, outnumbered by European settlers, had been exterminated, as
long
as
shiploads
of Negroes
were imported
as
slaves
into
the
Europe-
determined world of the United
States, or even as long as only individuals
had drifted into the interior of the Dark Continent where the savages were
numerous enough
to constitute a world of
their own, a world of
folly,
to
which the European adventurer added the folly of the ivory hunt. Many of
these adventurers had gone mad in the silent wilderness of an overpopulated
continent where
the presence of human beings only underlined
utter
soli-
tude, and where an untouched, overwhelmingly hostile nature that nobody
had ever taken the trouble to change into human landscape seemed to wait
in sublime patience "for the passing away of the fantastic invasion" of man.
But their madness had remained a matter of individual experience and with-
out consequences.
This changed with the men who arrived during the scramble for Africa.
These were no longer lonely individuals; "all Europe had contributed to the
making of (them)." They concentrated on
the southern
part of
the con-
tinent where they met the Boers, a Dutch
splinter group which had been
almost forgotten by Europe, but which now served
as a natural introduc-
tion to the challenge of new surroundings. The response of the superfluous
men was largely determined by the response
of the only European group
that
ever, though
in complete
isolation, had
to
live
in
a world of black
savages.
The Boers are descended from Dutch
settlers who in the middle of the
seventeenth century were stationed at the Cape to provide fresh vegetables
and meat
for
ships on
their voyage
to
India. A
small group
of French
Huguenots was
all that followed them in the course of the next century, so
that
it was only with the help of a high birthrate that the
little Dutch splinter
grew into a small people. Completely isolated from the current of European
history, they set out on a path such "as few nations have trod before them,
and scarcely one trod with success." ^^
The two main material factors in the development of the Boer people were
the extremely bad soil which could be used only for extensive cattle-raising,
and the very large black population which was organized in tribes and lived
as nomad hunters." The bad
soil made
close
settlement impossible and
prevented the Dutch peasant settlers from following the village organization
of their homeland. Large families, isolated from each other by broad spaces
of wilderness, were forced into a kind of clan organization and only the ever-
present threat of a common foe, the black tribes which by far outnumbered

all, slavery, though
it domesticated a certain part of the
savage population, never got hold of

still under no circum-
stances ought to be like oneself remained at the basis of slavery and became
the basis for a race society.
Mankind
remembers
the
history
of
peoples
but
has
only
legendary
knowledge of prehistoric tribes. The word "race" has a precise meaning only
when and where peoples are confronted with such tribes of which they have
no historical record and which do not know any history of their own. Whether
these
represent
"prehistoric man,"
the
accidentally surviving specimens
of
the
first forms of human life on earth, or whether they are the "posthistoric"
survivors of some unknown
disaster which ended a
civilization we do not
know. They certainly appeared rather like the survivors of one great catas-
trophe
which
might have
been
followed by
smaller
disasters
until
cata-
strophic monotony seemed to be a natural condition of human
life. At any
rate, races
in
this sense were found only
in regions where nature was par-
ticularly
hostile. What made them
different from other human beings was
not at all the color of their skin but the fact that they behaved like a part of
nature,
that they
treated nature
as
their undisputed master,
that they had
not created a human world, a human
reality, and that therefore nature had
remained,
in
all
its majesty,
the only overwhelming
reality—compared
to
which
they appeared
to be phantoms, unreal and ghostlike. They were,
as
it were, "natural" human beings who lacked the specifically human character,
the specifically human
reality, so that when European men massacred them
they somehow were not aware that they had committed murder.
Moreover, the senseless massacre of native tribes on the Dark Continent
was
quite
in
keeping
with
the
traditions
of
these
tribes
themselves. Ex-
termination of hostile
tribes had been the
rule
in
all African native wars,
and
it was
not
abolished when
a black
leader happened
to unite
several
tribes under his leadership. King Tchaka, who at the beginning of the nine-
teenth century united
the Zulu
tribes
in an extraordinarily disciplined and
warlike
organization,
established
neither
a people nor
a nation
of Zulus.
He
only
succeeded
in
exterminating more
than one
million members
of

RACE AND BUREAUCRACY

cannot establish a
political body,
the destruction remained an unrecorded
episode
in an unreal, incomprehensible process which cannot be accepted
by man and therefore
is not remembered by human history.
Slavery in the case of the Boers was a form of adjustment of a European
people
to a black
race,^* and only
superficially resembled those
historical
instances when
it had been a
result of conquest or slave
trade. No body
politic, no communal organization kept the Boers together, no territory was
definitely colonized, and the black slaves did not serve any white civilization.
The Boers had
lost both
their peasant
relationship
to
the
soil and
their
civilized feeling for human
fellowship. "Each man
fled the tyranny of his
neighbor's smoke" ^^ was
the
rule
of
the
country, and each Boer family
repeated in complete isolation the general pattern of Boer experience among
black savages and ruled over them
in absolute lawlessness, unchecked by
"kind neighbors ready
to cheer you or
to
fall on you stepping delicately
between the butcher and the policeman,
in the holy terror of scandal and
gallows
and
lunatic
asylums"
(Conrad).
Ruling
over
tribes
and
living
parasitically from
their labor, they came to occupy a position very similar
to that of the native
tribal leaders whose domination
they had
liquidated.
The natives, at any rate, recognized them as a higher form of tribal leader-
ship, a kind of natural deity to which one has to submit; so that the divine
role of the Boers was as much imposed by
their black slaves
as assumed
freely by themselves.
It
is a matter of course
that
to these white gods of
black slaves each law meant only deprivation of freedom, government only
restriction of the wild arbitrariness of the
clan.^" In the natives the Boers
discovered
the only "raw
material" which
Africa provided
in abundance
and they used them not for the production of riches but for the mere essen-
tials of human existence.
The black slaves
in South Africa quickly became the only part of the
population that actually worked. Their
toil was marked by
all the known
disadvantages of slave labor, such
as lack of initiative,
laziness, neglect of
tools, and general inefficiency. Their work therefore barely sufficed to keep
their masters alive and never reached the comparative abundance which nur-
tures
civilization.
It was
this absolute dependence on
the work
of others
and complete contempt for labor and productivity
in any form that trans-
formed the Dutchman into the Boer and gave his concept of race a distinctly
economic meaning. ^^

true
history of South African colonization describes the growth, not of a
settlement of Europeans, but of a totally new and unique society of different races and
colours

attainments,

heredity
and

Fhey treated the
natives as raw material and
lived
on them as one might live on the fruits of wild trees. Lazy and unproductive,
;hcy agreed to vegetate on essentially the same
level as the black tribes had
vegetated for thousands of years. The great horror which had seized European
men
at
their
first confrontation with
native
life was stimulated by precisely
this touch of inhumanity among human beings who apparently were as much
a part of nature as wild animals. The Boers lived on their slaves exactly the
way
natives had
lived on an unprepared and unchanged
nature. When the
BtK-rs.
in
their
fright and misery, decided
to
use
these savages
as though
they were
just another form of animal
life, they embarked upon a process
which could only end with
their own degeneration into
a white
race
living
beside
and
together
with
black
races from whom
in
the end
they would
differ only
in the color of their skin.
The poor whites in South Africa, who
in 1923 formed 10 per cent of the
total white population'"' and whose standard of living does not differ much
from that of the Bantu tribes, are today a warning example of this possibility.
Their poverty
is almost exclusively the consequence of their contempt for
work and their adjustment to the way of life of black tribes. Like the blacks,
they deserted
the
soil
if
the
most
primitive
cultivation no
longer
yielded
the
little
that was necessary or
if they had exterminated the animals of the
region.-" Together with their former slaves, they came to the gold and dia-
mond centers, abandoning their farms whenever the black workers departed.
But
in contrast
to
the
natives who were immediately hired
as cheap un-
skilled
labor,
they demanded and were
granted
charity
as
the
right
of
a
white
skin, having
lost
all consciousness that normally men do not earn a
living by the color of their skin.-' Their race consciousness today
is violent
"* The
point
is
that,
for
instance,
in
"the West
Indies
such
a
large
proportion
of
slaves as were held at the Cape would have been a sign of wealth and a source of pros-
perity"; whereas
"at the Cape slavery was the
sign of an unenterprising economy
.
.
.
whose labour was wastcfully and
inefficiently used"
(ih'uL).
It was chiefly
this that led
Barnes
(o/i.
(//..

and many other observers
to
the conclusion:
"South
Africa
is
thus
a
foreign
country,
not
only
in
the
sense
that
its
standpoint
is
definitely
un-
British. but also in the much more radical sense that
its very raison d'etre, as an attempt
at
an
organised
society,
is
in
contradiction
to
the
principles on which
the
states
of
Christendom are founded."
'"This corresponded
to as many
as
160,000
individuals
(Kiewiet,
op.

James (op.
cii..
p. 43) estimated the number of poor whites in
1943
at 500,000 which
would correspond to about 20 per cent of the white population.
-'" "The

the
result

not only because they have nothing
to lose save
their membership
in
the
white community, but also because the race concept seems
to define
their
own
condition much more
adequately
than
it does
that
of
their former
slaves, who
are well on
the way
to becoming workers,
a normal part
of
human
civilization.
Racism as a ruling device was used in
this society of whites and blacks
before imperialism exploited
it
as a major
political
idea.
Its
basis, and
its
excuse, were still experience itself, a horrifying experience of something alien
beyond
imagination
or comprehension;
it was
ternpting indeed simply
to
declare that these were not human beings. Since, however, despite
all ideo-
logical
explanations
the
black men stubbornly
insisted on
retaining
their
human features, the "white men" could not but reconsider their own human-
ity and decide that they themselves were more than human and obviously
chosen by God to be the gods of black men. This conclusion was logical and
unavoidable if one wanted to deny radically all common bonds with savages;
in practice
it meant that Christianity for the
first time could not
act
as a
decisive curb on the dangerous perversions of human self-consciousness, a
premonition
of
its
essential
ineffectiveness
in
other more
recent
race
so-
cieties."^ The Boers simply denied
the Christian
doctrine
of
the common
origin of men and changed those passages of the Old Testament which did
not yet transcend the limits of the old Israelite national religion into a super-
stition which could not even be called a heresy. ^^ Like the Jews, they firmly
believed in themselves as the chosen people,-* with the essential difference
that they were chosen not for the sake of divine salvation of mankind, but for
the lazy domination over another species that was condemned to an equally
lazy drudgery.'-' This was God's will on earth as the Dutch Reformed Church
proclaimed
it and
still proclaims
it today
in sharp and
hostile contrast to
the missionaries of all other Christian denominations.^''
22 The Dutch Reformed Church has been
in
the
forefront of
the
Boers'
struggle
against the
influence of Christian
missionaries on
the Cape.
In
1944, however, they
went one step farther and adopted "without a single voice of dissent" a motion oppos-
ing
the
marriage
of
Boers
with
EngUsh-speaking
citizens.
(According
to
the Cape
Times,
editorial of July

1944. Quoted from New Africa, Council on African Af-
fairs. Monthly Bulletin, October,
1944.)
23 Kiewiet
{op.
cit.,
p.
181) mentions "the doctrine of racial superiority which was
drawn from the
Bible and
reinforced by
the popular
interpretation which
the
nine-
teenth century placed upon Darwin's theories."
2* "The God of the Old Testament has been
to them almost
as much
a
national
figure as He has been to the Jews. ...
I
recall a memorable scene
in a Cape Town
club, where
a bold Briton, dining by chance with three or four Dutchmen, ventured
to observe that Christ was a non-European and that, legally speaking, he would have
been
a prohibited immigrant
in the Union of South
Africa. The Dutchmen were so
electrified at the remark that they nearly
fell off their chairs" (Barnes, op.
cit., p. 33).
25 "For the Boer farmer the separation and the degradation of the
natives
are
or-
dained by God, and
it
is crime and blasphemy to argue to the contrary" (Norman Bent-
wich,
"South
Africa. Dominion
of
Racial
Problems."

Political
Quarterly,

Vol. X, No. 3).
26 "To this day the missionary
is to the Boer the fundamental traitor, the white man
who stands for black against white" (S. Gertrude Millin, Rhodes, London, 1933, p. 38).

.Q^
IMPERIALISM
BiXT racism, unlike the other brands, has a touch of authenticity and, so
to speak
of inniKence. A complete lack of literature and other mtellectual
achievement
is
the
best witness
to
this statement."
It was and remams a
desperate reaction to desperate living conditions which was inarticulate and
inconsequential as long as
it was
left
alone. Things began
to happen only
with
the
arrival
of
the
British, who showed
little
interest m
their newest
colony which in 1849 was
still called a military station (as opposed to either
a colony or a plantation). But their mere presence—that
is, their contrasting
altitude toward
the
natives whom they did not consider a different animal
species,
their
later attempts
(after 1834)
to abolish slavery, and above
all
their
elforts
to impose
fixed boundaries upon landed property—provoked
the stagnant Boer society
into
violent
reactions.
It
is characteristic of
the
Boers
thai
these reactions followed
the same, repeated pattern throughout
the nineteenth century: Boer farmers escaped British law by treks into the
interior wilderness
of the country, abandoning without
regret
their homes
and their farms. Rather than accept limitations upon their possessions, they
left ihem
altogether. =" This does not mean
that
the Boers did not
feel
at
home wherever they happened
to be; they
felt and
still feel much more
at
home
in Africa than any subsequent immigrants, but
in Africa and not in
any specific limited
territory. Their fantastic treks, which threw the British
administration into consternation, showed clearly that they had transformed
themselves into a tribe and had lost the European's feeling for a territory, a
pairia of his own. 1 hey behaved exactly like the black tribes who had also
roamed
the Dark Continent for
centuries—feeling
at home wherever
the
horde happened to be, and fleeing like death every attempt at definite settle-
ment.
Rootlessness
is characteristic of all race organizations. What the European
"movements" consciously aimed
at, the transformation of the people into a
horde, can
be watched
like a laboratory
test
in
the Boers'
early and sad
attempt. While rootlessness
as a conscious aim was based primarily upon
2' "Because they had
little
art,
less
architecture, and no
literature, they depended
upon
their
farms,
their
Bibles, and
their blood
to
set them
off
sharply
against
the
native and the outlandcr" (Kiewiet, op.
cit.,
p.
121).
2" "The
true
Vortrckker hated
a boundary. When
the
British Government
insisted
on fixed boundaries for the Colony and for farms within
it, something was taken from
him. ...
It was best surely to betake themselves across the border where there were
water and free
land and no British Government to disallow Vagrancy Laws and where
white men
could
not
be
haled
to court
to answer
the complaints
of
their servants"
(Ihid., pp. 54-55). "The Great Trek, a movement unique in the history of colonization"
(p. 58) "was the defeat of the policy of more intensive settlement. The practice which
required the area of an entire Canadian township for the settlement of ten families was
extended through
all of South Africa.
It made
for ever impossible the segregation of
white and black races in separate areas of settlement. ... By taking the Boers beyond
the
reach
of
British
law. the Great Trek enabled them
to establish
'proper'
relations
with
the
native population"
(p.
56). "In
later years, the Great Trek was
to become
more than
a
protest;
it was
to become a
rebellion
against the
British
administration,
and the foundation stone of the Anglo-Boer racialism of the twentieth century" (James,
op.
cit.,
p. 28).

hatred of a world that had no place for "superfluous" men, so that
its de-
struction
could become
a supreme
political
goal,
the
rootlessness
of
the
Boers was a natural result of early emancipation from work and complete
lack of a human-built world. The same striking similarity prevails between
the "movements" and the Boers' interpretation of "chosenness." But while
the Pan-German, Pan-Slav, or Polish Messianic movements' chosenness was
a more or less conscious instrument for domination, the Boers' perversion
of Christianity was
solidly rooted
in
a horrible
reality
in which miserable
"white men" were worshipped
as
divinities by equally unfortunate "black
men." Living in an environment which they had no power to transform into
a civilized world, they could discover no higher value than themselves. The
point, however,
is
that no matter whether racism appears
as
the
natural
result of a catastrophe or as the conscious instrument for bringing
it about,
it
is always closely
tied
to contempt for labor, hatred of
territorial
limita-
tion, general rootlessness, and an activistic faith in one's own divine chosen-
ness.
Early
British
rule
in South
Africa,
with
its
missionaries,
soldiers, and
explorers, did not realize that the Boers' attitudes had some basis in reality.
They did not understand that absolute European supremacy—in which they,
after all, were as interested as the Boers—could hardly be maintained except
through racism because the permanent European settlement was so hope-
lessly outnumbered;
''••
they were shocked
"if Europeans
settled
in Africa
were to act like savages themselves because
it was the custom of the coun-
try," ^° and to their simple utilitarian minds
it seemed folly to sacrifice pro-
ductivity and profit to the phantom world of white gods ruling over black
shadows. Only with the settlement of Englishmen and other Europeans dur-
ing the gold rush did they gradually adjust to a population which could not
be lured back into European civilization even by profit motives, which had
lost contact even with the lower incentives of European man when
it had
cut
itself off from his higher motives, because both lose their meaning and
appeal
in a society where nobody wants to achieve anything and everyone
has become a god.

29 In 1939, the total population of the Union of South Africa amounted to 9,500,000
of whom 7,000,000 were
natives and 2,500,000 Europeans. Of the
latter, more than
1,250,000 were Boers, about one-third were British, and 100,000 were Jews. See Nor-

Up country to the mines. Most of them were English, but among them was
more than a sprinkling from Riga and Kiev, Hamburg and Frankfort, Rotter-
dam and San Francisco." " All of them belonged to "a class of persons who
prefer adventure and speculation
to settled industry, and who do not work
well in the harness of ordinary
life.
.
.
.
(There were]
diggers from Amer-
ica and Australia, German speculators, traders, saloonkeepers, professional
gamblers,
barristers
,
.
.
,
ex-officers of the army and navy, younger sons
of good families ...
a marvelous motley assemblage among whom money
flowed like water from the amazing productiveness of the mine." They were
joined by thousands of natives who
first came to "steal diamonds and to lag
their earnings out
in
rifles and powder," ^- but quickly started to work for
wages and became
the seemingly
inexhaustible cheap
labor supply when
the "most stagnant of colonial regions suddenly exploded
into
activity."
-^^
The abundance of natives, of cheap labor, was the first and perhaps most
important difference between
this gold rush and others of
its
type.
It was
soon apparent
that the mob from the four corners of the earth would not
even have to do the digging; at any rate, the permanent attraction of South
Africa, the permanent resource that tempted the adventurers
to permanent
settlement, was not the gold but this human raw material which promised a
permanent emancipation from work." The Europeans served solely as super-
visors and did not even produce skilled labor and engineers, both of which
had constantly to be imported from Europe.
Second
in importance only, for the ultimate outcome, was
the
fact that
this gold rush was not simply
left to
itself but was financed, organized, and
connected with
the ordinary European economy through
the accumulated
superfluous wealth and with
the help of Jewish
financiers. From the very
beginning "a hundred or so Jewish merchants who have gathered like eagles
over
their prey""
actually acted
as middlemen through whom European
capital was invested in the gold mining and diamond industries.
The only section of the South African population that did not have and
did not want
to have a share
in
the suddenly exploding
activities
of
the
country were the Boers. They hated all these uitlanders, who did not care for
citizenship but who needed and obtained British protection, thereby seem-
ingly
strengthening
British government influence on
the Cape. The Boers
reacted as they had always reacted, they sold their diamond-laden possessions
m
Kimberley
and
their
farms
with
gold
mines
near
Johannesburg
and
trekked once more
into
the
interior wilderness. They
did not understand
that this new influx was different from the British missionaries, government
officials, or ordinary
settlers, and they realized only when
it was
too
late

and they had already lost their share in the riches of the gold hunt that the
new idol of Gold was not at
all irreconcilable with their idol of Blood, that
the new mob was as unwilling to work and as unfit to establish a civilization
as they were themselves, and would therefore spare them the British officials'
annoying insistence on law and
the Christian
missionaries'
irritating con-
cept of human equality.
The Boers feared and fled what actually never happened, namely, the in-
dustrialization of the country. They were right insofar as normal production
and civilization would indeed have destroyed automatically the way of
life
of a race society. A normal market for labor and merchandise would have
liquidated the privileges of race. But gold and diamonds, which soon pro-
vided a living for half of South Africa's population, were not merchandise
in the same sense and were not produced in the same way as wool in Aus-
tralia, meat in New Zealand, or wheat in Canada. The irrational, non-func-
tional place of gold in the economy made
it independent of rational produc-
tion methods which, of course, could never have tolerated the fantastic dis-
parities between black and white wages. Gold, an object for speculation and
essentially dependent in value upon political factors, became the "lifeblood"
of South Africa ^^ but
it could not and did not become the basis of a new
economic order.
The Boers also feared the mere presence of the uitlanders because they
mistook them for British
settlers. The
uitlanders, however, came
solely
in
order to get rich quickly, and only those remained who did not quite succeed
or who, like the Jews, had no country to return to. Neither group cared very
much
to establish a community
after the model of European countries,
as
British
settlers had done
in
Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
It was
Barnato who happily discovered
that
"the Transvaal Government
is
like
no other government in the world.
It
is indeed not a government at
all, but
an unlimited company of some twenty thousand shareholders." ^^ Similarly,
it was more or
less a series of misunderstandings which
finally led
to the
British-Boer war, which the Boers wrongly believed to be "the culmination
of the British Government's lengthy quest for a united South Africa," while
it was actually prompted mainly by investment
interests.^** When the Boers
lost the war, they lost no more than they had already deliberately abandoned,
that
is, their share
in the riches; but they definitely won the consent of
all
other European elements, including the British government, to the lawless-

British or

and whereas
the
rise of Nazi Germany and
its conscious attempt to trans-
form
the German people
into a race strengthened
the
political position of
the Boers considerably, Germany's defeat has not weakened
it.
The Boers hated and feared the financiers more than the other foreigners.
They somehow understood that the financier was a key figure in the com-
bination of superfluous wealth and superfluous men, that
it was his function
to turn
(he essentially transitory gold hunt into a much broader and more
permanent
business.*' The war with
the
British,
moreover, soon demon-
strated an even more decisive aspect;
it was quite obvious that
it had been
prompted by foreign investors who demanded the government's protection
of their tremendous
profits
in faraway countries
as a matter of course—as
though armies engaged
in
a war against foreign peoples were nothing but
native police forces involved
in a fight with native criminals.
It made
little
difference
to the Boers that the men who introduced
this kind of violence
into the shadowy affairs of the gold and diamond production were no longer
the
financiers, but those who somehow had risen from the mob
itself and,
like Cecil Rhodes, believed less in profits than in expansion for expansion's
sake.*= The
financiers, who were mostly Jews and only the representatives,
not the owners, of the superfluous capital, had neither the necessary political
influence nor enough economic power to introduce poHtical purposes and the
use of violence into speculation and gambling.

natives and
its

that

imperialism, were remarkably representative of
it in its initial period/^ They
had taken advantage of the overproduction of capital and
its accompanying
complete reversal of economic and moral values. Instead of mere trade in
goods and mere
profit from production,
trade
in capital
itself emerged on
an unprecedented
scale.
This
alone would have
given them
a prominent
position; in addition
profits from investments
in foreign countries soon in-
creased
at a much more rapid
rate than trade
profits, so
that traders and
merchants
lost
their primacy
to
the
financier." The main economic char-
acteristic of the financier is that he earns his profits not from production and
exploitation
or exchange
of
merchandise
or normal
banking,
but
solely
through commissions. This
is important in our context because
it gives him
that
touch
of
unreality,
of phantom-hke
existence
and
essential
futility
even
in
a normal economy,
that
are
typical
of
so many
South
African
events. The
financiers
certainly
did
not
exploit
anybody
and
they
had
least
control
over
the
course
of
their
business
ventures,
whether
these
turned out to be common swindles or sound enterprises belatedly confirmed.
It
is
also
significant
that
it was
precisely
the mob element among
the
Jewish people who turned into financiers. It is true that the discovery of gold
mines
in
South
Africa had
coincided
with
the
first modem pogroms
in
Russia, so that a trickle of Jewish emigrants went to South Africa. There,
however, they would hardly have played a role
in the international crowd
of desperadoes and fortune hunters
if a few Jewish financiers had not been
there ahead of them and taken an immediate interest in the newcomers who
clearly could represent them in the population.
The Jewish financiers came from practically every country on
the con-
tinent where they had been,
in terms of class,
as superfluous
as the other
South African immigrants. They were quite
different from the few
estab-
lished families
of Jewish notables whose
influence had
steadily decreased
after 1820, and into whose ranks they could therefore no longer be assimi-
lated. They belonged in that new caste of Jewish financiers which, from the
seventies and eighties on, we find in
all European capitals, where they had
come, mostly after having left their countries of origin, in order to try their
luck in the international stock-market gamble. This they did everywhere to
the great dismay of the older Jewish families, who were too weak to stop
the unscrupulousness of the newcomers and therefore only too glad
if the
latter decided to transfer the field of their activities overseas. In other words,
the Jewish financiers had become as superfluous in legitimate Jewish bank-
ing
as
the wealth
they represented had become
superfluous
in

** The increase in profits from foreign investment and a relative decrease of foreign
trade profits characterizes the economic side of imperialism. In

while
in

profits
from
foreign
investment
amounted to 90 or 100 million pounds. See J. A. Hobson, Imperialism, London, 1938,

It
is obvious that investment demanded a much more conscious long-range
policy of exploitation than mere trade.

industrial enterprise and the fortune hunters in the world of legitimate labor.
In South Africa itself, where the merchant was about to lose his status within
the
countr>'s economy
to
the
financier,
the new
arrivals,
the
Barnatos,
Beits. Sammy Marks, removed the older Jewish
settlers from
first position
much more
easily
than
in
Europe."''
In South Africa, though hardly any-
where
else, they were the
third factor
in
the
initial
alliance between capi-
tal and mob;
to a
large extent, they
set the
alliance
into motion, handled
the
influx
of
capital and
its investment
in
the
gold mines and diamond
fields, and soon became more conspicuous than anybody else.
The
fact of
their Jewish origin added an undefinable symbolic flavor to
the role of the financiers—a flavor of essential homelessness and rootlessness
—and thus served to introduce an element of mystery, as well as to symbol-
ize the whole affair. To this must be added their actual international connec-
tions, which
naturally stimulated the general popular delusions concerning
Jewish
political power
all over the world.
It
is
quite comprehensible
that
all
the
fantastic
notions
of
a
secret
international Jewish power—notions
which
originally had been
the
result
of
the
closeness
of Jewish banking
capital
to
the
state's sphere of business—became even more virulent here
than on
the European continent. Here, for the
first time Jews were driven
into the midst of a race society and almost automatically singled out by the
Boers from
all
other "white" people
for
special
hatred,
not only
as
the
representatives of the whole enterprise, but as a different "race," the embodi-
ment of a devilish principle introduced into the normal world of "blacks"
and "whites." This hatred was
all the more violent as
it was partly caused
by
the suspicion
that
the Jews with
their own older and more
authentic
claim would be harder than anyone
else
to convince of the Boers' claim
to
chosenness.
While
Christianity
simply
denied
the
principle
as
such,
Judaism seemed a direct challenge and
rival. Long before
the Nazis con-
sciously
built up an antisemitic movement
in South Africa,
the race issue
had invaded the conflict between the uitlander and the Boers in the form of
antisemitism,"" which
is
all the more noteworthy
since
the importance
of
Jews
in the South African gold and diamond economy did not survive the
turn of the century.
As soon as the gold and diamond industries reached the stage of imperialist
development where absentee shareholders demand their governments' polit-
ical protection,
it turned out that the Jews could not hold their important
economic position. They had no home government to turn to and their posi-
tion in South African society was so insecure that much more was at stake
for them than a mere decrease in influence. They could preserve economic
*'- Early Jewish
settlers
in South Africa
in
the eighteenth and the
first part of the
nineteenth century were adventurers; traders and merchants followed them
after the
middle of the century, among whom the most prominent turned to industries such
as
fishing, sealing, and whaling (De Pass Brothers) and ostrich breeding
(the Mosenthal
family). Later, they were almost forced into the Kimberley diamond industries where,
however, they never achieved such pre-eminence as Barnato and Beit.

security and permanent settlement in South Africa, which they needed more
than any other group of
uitlanders, only
if they achieved some
status
in
society—which
in
this
case meant
admission
to
exclusive
British
clubs.
They were forced to trade their influence against the position of a gentle-
man, as Cecil Rhodes very bluntly put
it when he bought his way into the
Barnato Diamond Trust, after having amalgamated his De Beers Company
with Alfred Beit's Company.*^ But these Jews had more
to offer than just
economic power;
it was thanks to them that Cecil Rhodes, as much a new-
comer and adventurer as they, was finally accepted by England's respectable
banking business with which the Jewish financiers after
all had better con-
nections than anybody
else.*^ "Not one of the English banks would have
lent a single
shilling on the security of gold shares.
It was the unbounded
confidence of these diamond men from Kimberley that operated like a mag-
net upon their co-rehgionists at home." *^
The gold rush became a full-fledged imperialist enterprise only after Cecil
Rhodes had
dispossessed
the
Jews,
taken
investment
policies from Eng-
land's into his own hands, and had become the central figure on the Cape.
Seventy-five per cent
of the dividends paid
to shareholders went abroad,
and a large majority of them to Great Britain. Rhodes succeeded in inter-
esting the British government in
his business
affairs, persuaded them
that
expansion and export of the instruments of violence was necessary to protect
investments, and that such a policy was a holy duty of every national govern-
ment. On
the other hand, he introduced on
the Cape
itself
that
typically
imperialist economic policy of neglecting all industrial enterprises which were
not owned by absentee shareholders, so that finally not only the gold mining
companies but the government itself discouraged the exploitation of abundant
base metal
deposits and
the production
of consumers' goods. ^^ With
the
initiation
of
this
policy, Rhodes introduced the most potent factor
in
the
eventual appeasement of the Boers;
the neglect of
all authentic
industrial
enterprise was the most solid guarantee for the avoidance of normal capitaUst
development and thus against a normal end of race society.
It took
the Boers
several decades
to understand
that imperialism was

is no mere money transaction," Rhodes

life as a gentleman for
eight years and then committed suicide. See Millin, op.
cit., pp.
14, 85.

all
its peacetime industrial energy on the pro-

returns. But South Africa
also has tremendous
deposits
of
iron
ore,
copper,
asbestos,
manganese,
tin,
lead,
platinum,
chrome,
mica
and
graphite.
These, along with
the coal mines and
the handful of
factories producing consumer
goods, were known as 'secondary' industries. The investing public's interest in them was
limited. And development of these secondary industries was discouraged by the gold-
mining companies and to a large extent by the government" (James, op.
cit., p. 333).

IMPERIALISM
nothing to be afraid of, since
it would neither develop the country as Aus-
tralia and Canada had been developed, nor draw
profits from the country
at
large,
being
quite content
with
a high
turnover of investments
in one
specific
field.
Imperialism
therefore was
willing
to abandon
the
so-called
laws
of
capitalist
production and
their
egalitarian
tendencies,
so
long
as
profits from specific investments were safe. This led eventually to the aboli-
tion of
the law of mere
profitableness and South
Africa became
the
first
example
of
a phenomenon
that
occurs
whenever
the mob becomes
the
dominant factor in the alliance between mob and capital.
In one respect, the most important one, the Boers remained the undisputed
masters
of
the
country:
whenever
rational
labor and production
policies
came
into
conflict with race considerations,
the
latter won.
Profit motives
were sacrificed time and again to the demands of a race society, frequently
at a
terrific
price. The rentability of the railroads was destroyed overnight
when
the government dismissed 17,000 Bantu employees and paid whites
wages that amounted to 200 per cent more; ^^ expenses for municipal gov-
ernment became prohibitive when native municipal employees were replaced
with
whites;
the Color Bar
Bill
finally excluded
all
black
workers from
mechanical jobs and forced
industrial enterprise
to
a tremendous
increase
of production costs. The race world of the Boers had nobody to fear any
more,
least of
all white labor, whose trade unions complained bitterly that
the Color Bar Bill did not go far enough."
At
first glance,
it
is
surprising
that a violent antisemitism survived
the
disappearance of the Jewish financiers as well as the successful indoctrination
with racism of all parts of the European population. The Jews were certainly
no excepfion to this rule; they adjusted to racism as well as everybody else
and
their behavior toward black people was beyond reproach." Yet they
had, without being aware of
it and under pressure of special circumstances,
broken with one of the most powerful traditions of the country.
The
first sign of "anormal" behavior came immediately after the Jewish
financiers had
lost their position in the gold and diamond industries. They
did not leave the country but settled down permanently ** into a unique posi-

»' Here
again,
a
definite
difference between
the
earlier
settlers and
the
financiers
can be recognized
until the end of the nineteenth century. Saul Salomon, for instance,
a Negrophilist member of the Cape Parliament, was a descendant of a family which
had settled
in South Africa
in the early nineteenth century. Emden, op.

"Between
1924 and

figures
are
very
striking

figures with

gration

tion for a white group:
they neither belonged
to the "lifeblood" of Africa
nor to the "poor white trash." Instead they started almost immediately
to
build up those industries and professions which according to South African
opinion are "secondary" because they are not connected with gold." Jews
became manufacturers of furniture and clothes, shopkeepers and members
of the professions, physicians, lawyers, and journalists. In other words, no
matter how well they thought they were adjusted to the mob conditions of
the country and its race attitude, Jews had broken its most important pattern
by introducing into South African economy a factor of normalcy and pro-
ductivity, with the result that when Mr. Malan introduced into Parliament a
bill to expel
all Jews from the Union he had the enthusiastic support of
all
poor whites and of the whole Afrikander population.®"
This change in the economic function, the transformation of South African
Jewry from representing the most shadowy characters in the shadow world
of gold and race into the only productive part of the population, came like
an oddly belated confirmation of the original fears of the Boers. They had
hated the Jews not so much as the middlemen of superfluous wealth or the
representatives of the world of gold; they had feared and despised them as
the very image of the uitlanders who would try to change the country into
a normal producing part of Western
civilization, whose
profit motives,
at
least, would mortally endanger the phantom world of race. And when the
Jews were
finally cut
off from
the golden
lifeblood of
the
uitlanders and
could not
leave
the country
as
all
other
foreigners would have done
in
similar circumstances, developing "secondary" industries instead, the Boers
turned out to be right. The Jews, entirely by themselves and without being
the image of anything or anybody, had become a real menace to race society.
As matters stand today, the Jews have against them the concerted hostility
of
all those who believe
in race or gold—and that
is practically the whole
European population
in South Africa. Yet they cannot and will not make
common cause
with
the only other group which
slowly and
gradually
is
being won away from race
society:
the black workers who are becoming
more and more aware of their humanity under the impact of regular labor
and urban life. Although they, in contrast to the "whites," do have a genuine
race origin, they have made no fetish of race, and the abolition of race society
means only the promise of their liberation.
In contrast to the Nazis,
to whom racism and antisemitism were major
political weapons for the destruction of civilization and the setting up of a
new body
politic, racism and
antisemitism
are a matter of course and a
categories of uitlanders, settled there permanently; their share in the annual emigration
is less than 2 per cent.

natural consequence of the status quo
in South Africa. They did not need
Nazism in order to be born and they influenced Nazism only in an indirect
way.
There
were, however,
real and
immediate boomerang
effects
of South
Africa's
race
society on
the
behavior
of European
peoples:
since cheap
Indian and Chinese labor had been madly imported to South Africa when-
ever her
interior supply was temporarily
halted,"*^ a change of attitude
to-
ward colored people was
felt immediately in Asia where, for the
first time,
people were treated
in almost the same way as those African savages who
had frightened Europeans literally out of their wits. The difference was only
that
there could be no excuse and no humanly comprehensible reason for
treating Indians and Chinese as though they were not human beings. In a
certain sense,
it
is only here that the real crime began, because here every-
one ought to have known what he was doing.
It
is true that the race notion
was somewhat modified
in Asia; "higher and lower breeds," as the "white
man" would say when he started to shoulder his burden,
still indicate a scale
and the possibility of gradual development, and the idea somehow escapes
the concept of two entirely different species of animal life. On the other hand,
since the race principle supplanted the older notion of alien and strange peo-
ples in Asia,
it was a much more consciously applied weapon for domination
and exploitation than
in Africa.
Less
immediately
significant
but
of greater importance
for
totalitarian
governments was
the other experience
in
Africa's race
society,
that
profit
motives are not holy and can be overruled, that societies can function ac-
cording to principles other than economic, and that such circumstances may
favor those who under conditions of rationalized production and the capital-
ist system would belong to the underprivileged. South Africa's race society
taught
the mob
the
great
lesson
of which
it had always had
a confused
premonition,
that through
sheer
violence an
underprivileged group could
create a class lower than
itself, that for this purpose
it did not even need a
revolution but could band together with groups of the ruling classes, and
that
foreign or backward peoples
offered
the best opportunities
for such
tactics.
The
full impact of the African experience was
first realized by leaders
of the mob, like Carl Peters, who decided that they too had to belong to a
master race. African colonial possessions became the most
fertile
soil for
the flowering of what
later was
to become the Nazi
elite. Here they had
seen with their own eyes how peoples could be converted into races and how,
simply by taking the
initiative
in
this process, one might push one's own
people into
the position of the master
race. Here they were cured of the
" More than 100,000 Indian coolies were imported to the sugar plantations of Natal
in the nineteenth century. These were followed by Chinese laborers
in the mines who
numbered about 55,000 in
1907. In 1910, the British government ordered the repatria-
tion of
all Chinese mine laborers, and
in
1913
it prohibited any further immigration
from India or any other part of Asia. In 1931, 142,000 Asiatics were
still in the Union
and treated like African natives. (See also Scbultze, op.

illusion that the historical process
is necessarily "progressive," for
if
it was
the course of older colonization to trek to something, the "Dutchman trekked
away from everything," ^* and
if "economic history once taught that man
had developed by gradual steps from a
life of hunting to pastoral pursuits
and finally to a settled and agricultural
life," the story of the Boers clearly
demonstrated that one could also come "from a land that had taken the lead
in a thrifty and intensive cultivation
.
.
.
[and] gradually become a herds-
man and
a hunter." ^^ These
leaders understood very
well
that
precisely
because the Boers had sunk back to the level of savage tribes they remained
their undisputed masters. They were perfectly willing to pay the price,
to
recede
to the
level of a race organization,
if by so doing they could buy
lordship over other
"races." And they knew from
their experiences
with
people gathered from the four corners of the earth in South Africa that the
whole mob of the Western civilized world would be with them.^°
III:
The Imperialist Character
OF THE TWO main political devices of imperialist rule, race was discovered
in South Africa and bureaucracy in Algeria, Egypt, and India; the former
was
originally
the barely conscious
reaction
to
tribes
of whose humanity
European man was ashamed and frightened, whereas the latter was a con-
sequence of that administration by which Europeans had tried to rule foreign
peoples whom they felt to be hopelessly their inferiors and at the same time
in need of their special protection. Race, in other words, was an escape into
an irresponsibility where nothing human could any longer exist, and bureauc-
racy was the result of a responsibility that no man can bear for his fellow-
man and no people for another people.
The exaggerated sense of responsibility
in
the
British administrators of
India who succeeded Burke's "breakers of law" had its material basis in the
fact that the British Empire had actually been acquired in a
"fit of absent-
mindedness." Those, therefore, who were confronted with the accomplished
fact and the job of keeping what had become theirs through an accident, had
to find an interpretation that could change the accident into a kind of willed
act. Such historical changes of fact have been carried through by legends

with a
responsibility
that appears
to be the consequence of an unending chain of
events rather than conscious
acts, demands an explanation and interpreta-
tion of the past
in which the mysterious key to his future destiny seems to
be concealed. Legends were the spiritual foundations of every ancient
city,
empire, people, promising safe guidance through the limitless spaces of the
future. Without ever relating facts reliably, yet always expressing their true
significance,
they
offered a
truth beyond
realities, a remembrance beyond
memories.
Legendary explanations of history always served
as belated corrections
of facts and real events, which were needed precisely because history
itself
would hold man responsible for deeds he had not done and for consequences
he had never foreseen. The truth of the ancient legends—what gives them
their fascinating actuality many centuries
after the
cities and empires and
peoples they served have crumbled
to dust—was nothing but the form
in
which
past events were made
to
fit
the human
condition
in
general and
political
aspirations
in
particular. Only
in
the frankly invented
tale about
events did man consent to assume his responsibility for them, and to con-
sider past events
his past. Legends made him master of what he had not
done, and capable of dealing with what he could not undo. In
this
sense,
legends are not only among the
first memories of mankind, but actually the
true beginning of human history.
The flourishing of historical and political legends came to a rather abrupt
end with the birth of Christianity. Its interpretation of history, from the days
of Adam to the Last Judgment, as one single road to redemption and salva-
tion,
olTered
the most powerful and
all-inclusive legendary explanation of
human destiny. Only after the spiritual unity of Christian peoples gave way
to the plurality of nations, when the road to salvation became an uncertain
article
of
individual
faith
rather than
a universal
theory
applicable
to
all
happenings, did new kinds of historical explanations emerge. The nineteenth
century has offered us the curious spectacle of an almost simultaneous birth
of the most varying and contradictory ideologies, each of which claimed to
know
the hidden
truth
about
otherwise incomprehensible
facts.
Legends,
however, arc not
ideologies; they do not aim
at universal explanation but
are always concerned
with concrete
facts.
It seems rather
significant
that
the growth of national bodies was nowhere accompanied by
a foundation
legend, and that a
first unique attempt in modem times was made precisely
when the decline of the national body had become obvious and imperialism
seemed to take the place of old-fashioned nationalism.
The author of the imperialist legend
is Rudyard Kipling,
its topic
is the

RACE AND BUREAUCRACY
209
British
Empire,
its
result
the
imperialist
character
(imperialism was
the
only school of character
in modern
politics). And while the legend of the
British Empire has
little
to do with
the
realities
of British
imperialism,
it
forced or deluded into
its services the best sons of England. For legends
at-
tract the very best in our times, just as ideologies attract the average, and the
whispered tales of gruesome secret powers behind the scenes attract the very
worst. No doubt, no
political structure could have been more evocative of
legendary tales and justifications than the British Empire, than the
British
people's
drifting from
the conscious founding
of
colonies
into
ruling and
dominating foreign peoples
all over the world.
The foundation
legend,
as Kipling
tells
it,
starts from
the fundamental
reality of the people of the British
Isles.*'' Surrounded by the sea, they need
and win the help of the three elements of Water, Wind, and Sun through the
invention of the Ship. The ship made the always dangerous alliance with the
elements
possible and made
the Englishman master of the world.
"You'll
win the world," says Kipling, "without anyone caring how you did
it:
you'll
keep the world without anyone knowing how you did
it: and you'll carry the
world on your backs without anyone seeing how you did
it. But neither you
nor your sons will get anything out of that
little job except Four Gifts—one
for the Sea, one for the Wind, one for the Sun and one for the Ship that
carries you.
.
.
. For, winning the world, and keeping the world, and carry-
ing the world on their backs—on land, or on
sea, or in the
air—your sons
will always have the Four Gifts. Long-headed and slow-spoken and heavy
—damned heavy—in the hand, will they be; and always a
little bit to wind-
ward of every enemy—that they may be a safeguard to
all who pass on the
seas on their lawful occasions."
What brings the little tale of the "First Sailor" so close to ancient founda-
tion legends
is
that
it
presents
the
British
as
the
only
politically mature
people, caring for law and burdened with the welfare of the world,
in the
midst of barbarian tribes who neither care nor know what keeps the world
together. Unfortunately
this presentation lacked the innate truth of ancient
legends; the world cared and knew and saw how they did
it and no such
tale could ever have convinced the world that they did not "get anything out
of that
little job." Yet there was a certain reality
in England herself which
corresponded to Kipling's legend and made
it at
all possible, and that was
the existence of such virtues as chivalry, nobility, bravery, even though they
were utterly out of place in a political reality ruled by Cecil Rhodes or Lord
Curzon.
The fact that the "white man's burden"
is either hypocrisy or racism has
not prevented a few of the best Englishmen from shouldering the burden in
earnest and making themselves the tragic and quixotic fools of imperialism.
As real in England as the tradition of hypocrisy
is another less obvious one
which one
is tempted to call a tradition of dragon-slayers who went enthusi-
astically into far and curious lands to strange and naive peoples to slay the

First Sailor," in Humorous

numerous dragons that had plagued them for centuries. There
is more than
a
grain
of
truth
in
Kipling's other
tale, "The Tomb
of His Ancestor," "^
in
which
the Chinn
family
"serve
India
generation
after
generation,
as
dolphins follow in line across the open sea." They shoot the deer that steals
the poi>r man's crop, teach him the mysteries of better agricultural methods,
free him from some of
his more harmful
superstitions and
kill
lions and
tigers in grand style. Their only reward
is indeed a "tomb of ancestors" and
a family legend, believed by the whole Indian tribe, according to which "the
revered ancestor ...
has a
tiger of his own—a saddle tiger that he rides
round
the country whenever he
feels
inclined." Unfortunately,
this
riding
around
the countryside
is "a sure sign of war or pestilence or—or some-
Ihiniz." and
in
this particular case
it
is a sign of vaccination. So that Chinn
the Voungcst, a not very important underling in the hierarchy of the Army
Services, but all-important
as far
as
the Indian
tribe
is concerned, has
to
shoot the beast of his ancestor so that people can be vaccinated without fear
of "war or pestilence or something."
As modern
life goes,
the Chinns indeed "are luckier than most folks."
Their chance
is that they were born into a career that gently and naturally
leads them
to the realization of the best dreams of youth. When other boys
have to forget "noble dreams," they happen to be just old enough to trans-
late them
into
action. And when
after
thirty years
of
service
they
retire,
their steamer will pass "the outward bound troopship, carrying his son east-
ward to the family duty," so that the power of old Mr. Chinn's existence as
a government-appointed and army-paid dragon-slayer can be imparted to the
next generation. No doubt, the British government pays them for their serv-
ices, but
it
is not
at
all clear in whose service they eventually land. There
is a strong possibility that they really serve this particular Indian tribe, gen-
eration after generation, and
it
is consoling all around that at least the tribe
itself
is convinced of
this. The
fact
that
the higher
services know hardly
anything
of
little
Lieutenant
Chinn's
strange
duties and
adventures,
that
they are hardly aware of his being a successful reincarnation of his grand-
father, gives his dreamlike double existence an undisturbed basis in reality. He
is simply at home in two worlds, separated by water- and gossip-tight walls.
Born
in "the heart of the scrubby tigerish country" and educated among his
own people
in peaceful, well-balanced, ill-informed England, he
is ready to
live permanently with two peoples and is rooted in and well acquainted with
the tradition, language, superstition, and prejudices of both. At a moment's
notice he can change from the obedient underling of one of His Majesty's
soldiers into an exciting and noble figure in the natives' world, a well-beloved
protector of the weak,
the dragon-slayer of old
tales.
The point
is that these queer quixotic protectors of the weak who played
their
role behind
the scenes of
oflicial
British
rule were not so much
the
product of a primitive people's naive imagination as of dreams which con-
tained the best of European and Christian
traditions, even when they had

already deteriorated into the
futility of boyhood
ideals.
It was neither His
Majesty's soldier nor the British higher official who could teach the natives
something of the greatness of the Western world. Only those who had never
been able to outgrow their boyhood ideals and therefore had enlisted
in the
colonial services were
fit for the task. Imperialism to them was nothing but
an accidental opportunity to escape a society in which a man had to forget
his youth
if he wanted to grow up. English society was only too glad to see
them depart to faraway countries, a circumstance which permitted the tolera-
tion and even the furtherance of boyhood ideals in the public school system;
the colonial services took them away from England and prevented,
so
to
speak, their converting the ideals of their boyhood into the mature ideas of
men. Strange and curious lands attracted the best of England's youth since
the end of the nineteenth century, deprived her society of the most honest
and the most dangerous elements, and guaranteed, in addition to this
bliss,
a certain conservation, or perhaps petrification, of boyhood noblesse which
preserved and infantilized Western moral standards.
Lord Cromer, secretary to the Viceroy and financial member in the pre-
imperialist government of
India,
still belonged
in
the category
of
British
dragon-slayers. Led solely by "the sense of sacrifice" for backward popula-
tions and "the sense of duty"
*^^ to the glory of Great Britain that "has given
birth
to a class
of
officials who have both
the
desire and
the capacity
to
govern,"*''' he declined in 1894 the post of Viceroy and refused ten years
later the position of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Instead of such
honors, which would have satisfied a lesser man, he became the little-publi-
cized and all-powerful British Consul General in Egypt from 1883 to 1907.
There he became
the
first
imperialist
administrator,
certainly
"second
to
none among those who by their services have glorified the British race";
"'^
perhaps the last to die in undisturbed pride: "Let these suffice for Britain's
meed— / No nobler price was ever won, / The blessings of a people freed /
The consciousness of duty done."
*"'
Cromer went to Egypt because he realized that "the Englishman straining
far over to hold his loved India [has
to] plant a firm foot on the banks of
the Nile."
*'^ Egypt was to him only a means to an end, a necessary expansion
for the sake of security for India. At almost the same moment
it happened
that another Englishman set foot on the African continent, though at
its op-
posite end and for opposite reasons:
Cecil Rhodes went
to South Africa
and saved the Cape colony after
it had lost
all importance for the English-
man's "loved India." Rhodes's ideas on expansion were far more advanced

IMPERIALISM
than those of his more respectable colleague in the north; to him expansion did
not need to be justified by such sensible motives as the holding of what one
already possessed. "Expansion was everything" and India, South Africa, and
Eg>pt were equally important or unimportant as stepping-stones
in an ex-
pansion limited only by the size of the earth. There certainly was an abyss
between
the
vulgar megalomaniac and
the educated man
of
sacrifice and
duty; yet they arrived
at roughly identical results and were equally respon-
sible for the "Great Game" of secrecy, which was no less insane and no less
detrimental to politics than the phantom world of race.
The
outstanding
similarity between Rhodes's
rule
in South Africa and
Cromer's domination of Egypt was that both regarded the countries not as
desirable ends in themselves but merely as means for some supposedly higher
purpose. They were similar therefore
in their indifference and aloofness,
in
their genuine lack of interest in their subjects, an attitude which differed as
much from the cruelty and arbitrariness of native despots in Asia as from the
exploiting carelessness of conquerors, or the insane and anarchic oppression
of one race tribe through another. As soon as Cromer started to rule Egypt
for the sake of India, he
lost his
role of protector of "backward peoples"
and could no longer sincerely believe that "the self-interest of the subject-
races
is
the principal
basis of the whole Imperial
fabric."
"**
Aloofness became the new attitude of all members of the British services;
it was a more dangerous form of governing than despotism and arbitrariness
because
it did not even tolerate that last link between the despot and his sub-
jects, which
is formed by bribery and
gifts. The very integrity of the British
administration made despotic government more inhuman and
inaccessible
to
its subjects than
Asiatic rulers or reckless conquerors had ever
been.**^
Integrity and
aloofness were symbols for an
absolute
division
of
interests
to the point where they are not even permitted
to
conflict. In comparison,
exploitation, oppression, or corruption look hke safeguards of human dig-
nity, because
exploiter and exploited, oppressor and oppressed,
corruptor
and corrupted
still
live in the same world,
still share
the same goals,
fight
each odier for the possession of the same things; and
it
is this tertium com-
parationis which aloofness destroyed. Worst of all was the fact that the aloof
administrator was hardly aware that he had invented a new form of govern-
ment but actually believed that his attitude was conditioned by "the forcible
contact with a people living on a lower plane." So, instead of believing in
his individual superiority with some degree of essentially harmless
vanity,
he
felt
that he belonged
to "a nation which had reached a comparatively
high plane of civilization" "^ and therefore held his position by right of birth,
regardless of personal achievements.

is fascinating because
it embodies the very turning

point from the older colonial to imperialist services. His
first reaction to his
duties in Egypt was a marked uneasiness and concern about a state of
af-
fairs which was not "annexation" but a "hybrid form of government to which
no name can be given and for which there
is no precedent." ^^ In 1885, after
two years of service, he still harbored serious doubts about a system in which
he was the nominal British Consul General and
the actual
ruler of Egypt
and wrote that a "highly delicate mechanism [whose]
efficient working de-
pends very greatly on the judgment and ability of a few individuals
.
.
. can
... be justified [only]
if we are able to keep before our eyes the possibihty
of evacuation. ...
If that
possibility becomes so remote
as
to be of no
practical account ...
it would be better for us ...
to arrange
.
.
.
with
the other Powers that we should take over the government of the country,
guarantee
its debt, etc." ^^ No doubt Cromer was right, and either, occupa-
tion or evacuation, would have normalized matters. But that "hybrid form
of government" without precedent was to become characteristic of
all im-
perialist enterprise, with the result that a few decades afterwards everybody
had lost Cromer's early sound judgment about possible and impossible forms
of government, just as there was lost Lord Selboume's early insight that a
race society as a way of
life was unprecedented. Nothing could better char-
acterize the
initial stage of imperialism than the combination of these two
judgments on conditions in Africa:
a way of
life without precedent in the
south, a government without precedent in the north.
In the following years, Cromer reconciled himself
to
the "hybrid form
of government"; in his letters he began to justify
it and to expound the need
for the government without name and precedent. At the end of his
life, he
laid down
(in his essay on "The Government of Subject Races")
the main
lines of what one may well call a philosophy of the bureaucrat.
Cromer started by recognizing that "personal influence" without a legal
or written political treaty could be enough for "sufficiently effective super-
vision over public affairs" ^^ in foreign countries. This kind of informal in-
fluence was preferable to a well-defined policy because
it could be
altered
at a moment's notice and did not necessarily involve the home government
in case of difficulties. It required a highly trained, highly reliable staff whose
loyalty and patriotism were not connected with personal ambition or vanity
and who would even be required to renounce the human aspiration of having
their names connected with their achievements. Their greatest passion would
have
to
be
for
secrecy
("the
less
British
officials
are
talked
about
the
better"),^* for a role behind the scenes;
their greatest contempt would be
directed at publicity and people who love
it.
Cromer himself possessed
all these
qualities
to a very high degree;
his
wrath was never more strongly aroused than when he was "brought out of

of

institutions can only be a danger, for
it
is impossible to govern

Bureaucracy
is always a government of experts, of an "experienced minority"
which has to resist as well as
it knows how the constant pressure from "the
inexperienced
majority." Each
people
is
fundamentally
an
inexperienced
majority and can

specialized

as

ness of

principles
in

result
in

tions." which, according to Cromer, was the principal defect of the French
system.'"

suffered from
a
lack
of
vanity. According to Jameson, he expected to be remembered for at least
four thousand years. Yet, despite all his appetite for self-glorification, he hit
upon the same idea of rule through secrecy as the overmodest Lord Cromer.
Extremely fond of drawing up
wills, Rhodes insisted
in
all of them
(over
the course of two decades of his public life)
that his money should be used
to found "a secret society ...
to carry out his scheme," which was to be
"organized
like
Loyola's, supported by
the accumulated wealth
of
those
whose aspiration
is a desire to do something," so that eventually there would
be "between two and three thousand men
in the prime of
life scattered
all
over the world, each one of whom would have had impressed upon his mind
in
the most susceptible period of his
life the dream of the Founder, each
one
of whom,
moreover, would have been

selected towards the Founder's purpose."

RACE AND BUREAUCRACY

Rhodes opened the society at once to all members of the "Nordic race" *" so
that the aim was not so much the growth and glory of Great Britain—her
occupation of the "entire continent of Africa, the Holy Land, the valley of
the Euphrates, the islands of Cyprus and Candia, the whole of South Amer-
ica,
the
islands of the
Pacific,
.
.
.
the whole of the Malay Archipelago,
the seaboards of China and Japan [and] the ultimate recovery of the United
States" *^—as
the expansion
of
the "Nordic race" which,
organized
in a
secret society, would establish a bureaucratic government over
all peoples
of the earth.
What overcame Rhodes's monstrous
innate
vanity and made him
dis-
cover
the charms
of secrecy was
the same
thing
that overcame Cromer's
innate sense of duty:
the discovery of an expansion which was not driven
by the
specific appetite for a
specific country but conceived as an endless
process in which every country would serve only as stepping-stone for further
expansion.
In view of such a concept,
the
desire
for glory can no longer
be satisfied by the glorious triumph over a specific people for the sake of
one's own people, nor can the sense of duty be
fulfilled through
the con-
sciousness of specific services and the fulfillment of specific tasks. No matter
what individual qualities or defects a man may have, once he has entered
the maelstrom
of an unending process
of expansion, he
will,
as
it were,
cease to be what he was and obey the laws of the process, identify himself
with anonymous
forces
that he
is supposed
to serve
in order
to keep
the
whole process
in motion; he
will
think
of himself
as mere
function, and
eventually consider such functionality, such an incarnation of the dynamic
trend, his highest possible achievement. Then, as Rhodes was insane enough
to say, he could indeed "do nothing wrong, what he did became
right.
It
was his duty to do what he wanted. He felt himself a god—nothing less." ^^
But Lord Cromer sanely pointed out the same phenomenon of men degrad-
ing themselves voluntarily into mere instruments or mere functions when he
called the bureaucrats "instruments of incomparable value in the execution
of a policy of Imperialism." ®^
It
is obvious that these secret and anonymous agents of the force of ex-
pansion
felt no obligation to man-made laws. The only "law" they obeyed
was the "law" of expansion, and the only proof of their "lawfulness" was
success. They had to be perfectly willing to disappear into complete oblivion
once failure had been proved,
if for any reason they were no longer
"in-
struments
of incomparable
value." As
long
as
they were
successful,
the
feeling of embodying forces greater than themselves made
it relatively easy
to resign and even to despise applause and glorification. They were monsters
of conceit in their success and monsters of modesty in their failure.
80 It
is
well known
that
Rhodes's
"secret
society" ended
as
the
very
respectable
Rhodes Scholarship Association to which even today not only Englishmen
but mem-
bers

races,"

as Germans,

and

are

IMPERIALISM
At the basis of bureaucracy as a form of government, and of
its inherent
replacement of law with temporary and changing decrees,
lies this supersti-
tion of a possible and magic identification of man with the forces of history.
1 he ideal of such a political body
will always be the man behind the scenes
who pulls
the strings of history. Cromer hnally shunned every "written
in-
strument, or, indeed, anything which
is tangible" "'
in his relationships with
Egypt—even
a proclamation
of annexation—in order
to be
free
to obey
only the law of expansion, without obligation
to a man-made
treaty. Thus
docs
the bureaucrat shun every general law, handling each situation sepa-
rately by decree, because a law's inherent
stability threatens to establish a
permanent community in which nobody could possibly be a god because all
would have to obey a law.
The two key figures in this system, whose very essence
is aimless process,
arc the bureaucrat on one side and the secret agent on the other. Both types,
as
long
as
they
served only
British
imperialism,
never
quite
denied
that
they were descended from dragon-slayers and protectors of the weak and
therefore
never drove
bureaucratic regimes
to
their inherent extremes. A
British bureaucrat almost two decades after Cromer's death knew "adminis-
trative massacres" could keep India within the British Empire, but he knew
also how Utopian
it would be to try to get the support of the hated "Eng-
lish
Departments"
for an
otherwise
quite
realistic
plan.*^ Lord
Curzon,
Viceroy
of
India,
showed
nothing
of Cromer's
noblesse
and
was
quite
characteristic
of
a
society
that
increasingly
inclined
to
accept
the mob's
race standards
if they were offered
in the form of fashionable snobbery.*^
But snobbery
is
incompatible
with
fanaticism and
therefore never
really
efficient.
The same
is true of the members of the British Secret Service. They too
are of illustrious origin—what the dragon-slayer was to the bureaucrat, the
adventurer
is
to the secret agent—and they too can rightly lay claim
to a

'despotism
and
bureaucracy work so well
in
India, may not that be perhaps at some time used as an
argument
for introducing something of the same system
here?' " The government of
India, at any
rate, "knew well enough that
it would have to justify
its existence and
its
policy before public opinion in England, and
it well knew that that public opinion would
never tolerate oppression" (A. Carthill, op.
cit., pp. 70 and 41-42).
"« Harold
Nicolson
in
his Curzon: The Last Phase 1919-1925, Boston-New York,
1934. tells the following story: "Behind the lines in Flanders was a large brewery in the
vats of which the private soldiers would bathe on returning from the trenches. Curzon
was taken to see
this dantesque exhibit. He watched with interest those hundred naked
hgures disportmg themselves
in
the steam. 'Dear
me!,' he
said.
'I had no conception
that
the lower classes had such
white
skins.' Curzon would deny the
authenticity of
this story but loved
it none the less" (pp. 47-48).

foundation legend, the legend of the Great Game as told by Rudyard Kipling
in Kim.
Of course every adventurer knows what Kipling means when he praises
Kim because "what he loved was the game for its own sake." Every person
still able
to wonder
at
"this great and wonderful world" knows
that
it
is
hardly an argument against the game when "missionaries and secretaries of
charitable societies could not see the beauty of it."
Still less,
it seems, have
those a right to speak who think
it "a sin to kiss a white
girl's mouth and
a virtue to kiss a black man's shoe." ^^ Since
life
itself ultimately has to be
lived and loved for
its own sake, adventure and love of the game for
its
own sake
easily appear
to be
a most
intensely human symbol of
life.
It
is
this underlying passionate humanity
that makes Kim the only novel of
the
imperialist
era
in
which
a
genuine
brotherhood
links
together
the
"higher and lower
breeds,"
in
which Kim,
"a
Sahib and
the
son
of
a
Sahib," can
rightly
talk
of "us" when he
talks
of
the "chain-men,"
"all
on one
lead-rope." There
is more
to
this "we"—strange
in
the mouth
of a
believer
in
imperialism—than
the
all-enveloping anonymity
of men
who are proud to have "no name, but only a number and a
letter," more
than
the common
pride
of
having
"a
price
upon
[one's]
head." What
makes them comrades
is
the common experience of being—through dan-
ger,
fear,
constant
surprise,
utter
lack
of
habits,
constant
preparedness
to
change
their
identities—symbols
of
life
itself,
symbols,
for
instance,
of happenings
all
over
India,
immediately
sharing
the
life
of
it
all
as
"it
runs
like
a
shuttle
throughout
all
Hind,"
and
therefore
no
longer
"alone, one
person,
in
the middle
of
it
all,"
trapped,
as
it were, by the
limitations
of
one's own
individuality
or
nationality.
Playing
the
Great
Game, a man may feel as though he lives the only
life worth while because
he
has been
stripped
of everything which may
still be considered
to be
accessory.
Life
itself seems
to be
left,
in a fantastically
intensified
purity,
when man has cut himself off from
all ordinary social
ties, family, regular
occupation,
a
definite
goal,
ambitions, and
the guarded
place
in
a com-
munity
to which he belongs by birth. "When every one
is dead the Great
Game is finished. Not before." When one is dead, life
is finished, not before,
not when one happens to achieve whatever he may have wanted. That the
game has no ultimate purpose makes
it so dangerously similar to
life
itself.
Purposelessness
is the very charm of Kim's existence. Not for the sake
of England did he accept his strange duties, nor for the sake of India, nor for
any other worthy or unworthy cause. Imperialist notions like expansion for
expansion's or power for power's sake might have suited him, but he would
not have cared particularly and certainly would not have constructed any
such formula. He stepped
into
his peculiar way
of
"theirs not
to reason
why,
theirs but to do and die" without even asking the
first question. He
was tempted only by the basic endlessness of the game and by secrecy as

cit., p. 88.

such. And secrecy again seems like a symbol of the basic mysteriousness of
Somehow
it was not the fault of the born adventurers, of those who by
their very nature dwelt outside society and outside
all political bodies, that
they found m
imperialism
a
political game
that was endless by
definition;
ihcy were not supposed
to know
that
in
politics an endless game can end
only
in catastrophe and
that
political secrecy hardly ever ends
in anything
nobler than the vulgar duplicity of a spy. The joke on these players of the
Great Game was that their employers knew what they wanted and used their
passion
for anonymity
for ordinary spying. But
this triumph of the profit-
hungry-
investors was temporary, and they were duly cheated when a few
decades
later
they met
the players of the game of totalitarianism, a game
played without
ulterior motives
like
profit and therefore played with such
murderous
efficiency
that
it devoured even those who financed
it.
Before
this happened, however,
the
imperialists had destroyed the best
man who ever turned from an adventurer (with a strong mixture of dragon-
slayer)
into a secret agent, Lawrence of Arabia. Never again was the experi-
ment of secret politics made more purely by a more decent man. Lawrence
experimented fearlessly upon himself, and then came back and believed that
he belonged to the "lost generation." He thought this was because "the old
men came out again and took from us our victory"
in order to "re-make
[the world]
in the likeness of the former world they knew." ^^ Actually the
old men were quite inefficient even in this, and handed their victory, together
with
their power, down
to other men of the same
"lost generation," who
were neither older nor so dissimilar to Lawrence. The only difference was
that Lawrence
still clung
fast
to a morality which, however, had
already
lost
all objective bases and consisted only of a kind of private and neces-
sarily quixotic attitude of chivalry.
Lawrence was seduced into becoming a secret agent in Arabia because of
his strong desire
to leave the world of dull respectability whose continuity
had become simply meaningless, because of his disgust with the world as well
as with himself. What attracted him most in Arab civilization was
its "gospel
of
bareness
.
.
.
[which]
involves
apparently
a
sort
of
moral
bareness
too," which "has refined
itself clear of household gods." ^^ What he
tried
to avoid most of
all after he had returned to English civilization was living
a
life of his own, so that he ended with an apparently incomprehensible en-
listment as a private
in the British army, which obviously was the only in-
stitution
in which a man's honor could be
identified with
the
loss
of his
individual personality.
When
the outbreak of the
first World War sent T. E. Lawrence
to the
Arabs of the Near East with the assignment to rouse them into a rebellion
against
their Turkish masters and make them
fight on the
British
side, he

came into the very midst of the Great Game. He could achieve his purpose
only
if a national movement was stirred up among Arab
tribes, a national
movement that ultimately was to serve British imperialism. Lawrence had to
behave as though the Arab national movement were his prime interest, and
he did
it so well that he came to believe
in
it himself. But then
again he
did not belong, he was ultimately unable
"to think
their thought" and
to
"assume
their character." "" Pretending to be an Arab, he could only lose
his
"English
self" ®* and was
fascinated by
the complete
secrecy
of
self-
effacement
rather than
fooled by
the obvious
justifications
of benevolent
rule over backward peoples that Lord Cromer might have used. One genera-
tion older and sadder than Cromer, he took great delight in a role that de-
manded a reconditioning of
his whole
personality
until he
fitted
into
the
Great Game, until he became the incarnation of the force of the Arab na-
tional movement,
until he
lost
all natural vanity
in his mysterious alliance
with forces necessarily bigger than himself, no matter how big he could have
been, until he acquired a deadly "contempt, not for other men, but for
all
they do" on their own initiative and not in alliance with the forces of history.
When, at the end of the war, Lawrence had to abandon the pretenses of
a secret agent and somehow recover his "English self,"
'*- he "looked at the
West and
its conventions with new eyes:
they destroyed
it
all for me.""''

the
Great Game
of
incalculable
bigness,
which
no
publicity had
glorified or Umited and which had elevated him, in his twenties, above kings
and prime
ministers because he had "made 'em or played with them,"
""'
Lawrence came home with an obsessive desire for anonymity and the deep
conviction
that nothing he could possibly
still do with
his
life would ever
satisfy him. This conclusion he drew from his perfect knowledge that
it was
not he who had been big, but only the role he had aptly assumed, that his
bigness had been the result of the Game and not a product of himself. Now
he did not "want
to be big any more" and, determined
that he was not
"going
to be respectable
again," he
thus was indeed "cured ...
of any
desire ever to do anything for myself." °^ He had been the phantom of a
force, and he became
a phantom among
the
living when
the
force,
the
function, was taken away from him. What he was frantically looking for was
another
role
to
play, and

incidentally was

IMPERIALISM
George Bernard Shaw inquired so kindly but uncomprehendingly, as though
he srK>kc from another century, not understanding why a man of such great
achie\ements
should
not own
up
to
them.''" Only
another
role,
another
function would
be
stroni; enough
to
prevent himself and
the world from
idcntif>ing him with
his deeds
in Arabia, from replacing
his old
self with
a new personality. He did not want to become "Lawrence of Arabia," since,
fundamentally, he did not want to regain a new self after having lost the old.
His greatness was that he was passionate enough
to refuse cheap compro-
mises and easy roads
into
reality and
respectability,
that he never
lost his
awareness that he had been only a function and had played a role and there-
fore "must not benefit
in any way from what he had done
in Arabia. The
honors which he had won were refused. The jobs offered on account of his
reputation had to be declined nor would he allow himself to exploit his suc-
cess by
profiting from writing a single paid piece of journalism under the
name of Lawrence." "^
The story of T. E. Lawrence
in
all
its moving bitterness and greatness
was not simply the story of a paid
official or a hired spy, but precisely the
story of a real agent or functionary, of somebody who actually believed he
had
entered—or been
driven
into—the stream
of
historical
necessity and
become
a functionary or agent of the
secret forces which
rule
the world.
"I had pushed my go-cart into the eternal stream, and so
it went faster than
the ones that are pushed cross-stream or up-stream. I did not believe finally
in
the Arab movement:
but thought
it necessary in
its time and place." "^
Just as Cromer had
ruled Egypt
for
the sake
of
India, or Rhodes South
Africa
for
the
sake
of
further expansion, Lawrence had
acted
for some
ulterior
unpredictable
purpose. The only
satisfaction he could
get out of
this,
lacking
the calm good conscience of some limited achievement, came
from
the
sense
of functioning
itself, from
being embraced and driven by
some big movement. Back
in London and
in despair, he would
try to find
some
substitute
for
this kind of "self-satisfaction" and would "only
get
it
out of hot speed on a motor-bike." "^ Although Lawrence had not yet been
seized by the fanaticism of an ideology of movement, probably because he
was too well educated for the superstitions of his time, he had already ex-
perienced that fascination, based on despair of
all possible human responsi-
bility, which the eternal stream and
its eternal movement exert. He drowned
himself in
it and nothing was left of him but some inexplicable decency and
a pride in having "pushed the right way." "I am
still puzzled as to how far
the individual counts:
a
lot,
I fancy,
if he pushes the right way." i"" This,
then,
is the end of the real pride of Western man who no longer counts as
an end
in himself, no longer does "a thing of himself nor a thing so clean
»« George
Bernard Shaw, asking Lawrence
in
1928 "What
is your game

(for
which he could "get good references") were not authentic.

as to be his own" ^"^ by giving laws to the world, but has a chance only
"if
he pushes the right way," in alliance with the secret forces of history and
necessity—of which he is but a function.
When the European mob discovered what a "lovely virtue" a white skin
could be in Africa,^"^ when the English conqueror
in India became an ad-
ministrator who no longer believed in the universal validity of law, but was
convinced of his own innate capacity to rule and dominate, when the dragon-
slayers turned into either "white men" of "higher breeds" or into bureau-
crats and
spies, playing the Great Game of endless
ulterior motives
in an
endless movement; when the British Intelligence Services (especially after the
first World War) began to attract England's best sons, who preferred serv-
ing mysterious
forces
all over the world
to
serving the common good
of
their country, the stage seemed to be set for all possible horrors. Lying under
anybody's nose were many of the elements which gathered together could
create a totalitarian government on the basis of racism. "Administrative mas-
sacres" were proposed by Indian bureaucrats while African officials declared
that "no ethical considerations such
as
the
rights of man
will be allowed
to stand in the way" of white rule.^"^
The happy fact is that although British imperialist rule sank to some level
of vulgarity, cruelty played a lesser role between the two World Wars than
ever before and a minimum of human rights was always safeguarded.
It
is
this moderation in the midst of plain insanity that paved the way for what
Churchill
has
called
"the
liquidation
of His
Majesty's Empire" and
that
eventually may turn out to mean the transformation of the English nation
into a Commonwealth of English peoples.

so
closely

tallized into movements, however, and captured the imagination of broader
strata only with the triumphant imperialist expansion of the Western nations

eighties. The Central and Eastern European nations, which had no

in
the
fact
that
its concept of cohesive expansion does not
allow for any geographic distance between the methods and

it did not require boomerang effects

to make itself and
all
its consequences felt in Europe. Continental imperial-

and could not be preceded by export of superfluous money and superfluous
men, because Europe did not offer colonial opportunities for either. Among
their leaders, we find therefore almost no businessmen and few adventurers,
but many members of the free professions, teachers, and civil servants.'*
While overseas
imperialism,
its
antinational tendencies notwithstanding,
succeeded in giving a new lease on
life to the antiquated institutions of the
nation-state, continental imperialism was and remained unequivocally hos-
tile to all existing political bodies.
Its general mood, therefore, was far more
rebellious and
its leaders
far more adept
at revolutionary
rhetoric. While
overseas imperialism had offered real enough panaceas for the residues of
all classes, continental imperialism had nothing to offer except an ideology
and a movement. Yet this was quite enough in a time which preferred a key
to history to political action, when men in the midst of communal disintegra-
tion and
social atomization wanted
to belong
at any
price.
Similarly,
the
visible distinction of a white skin, whose advantages in a black or brown en-
vironment are easily understood, could be matched successfully by a purely
imaginary distinction between an Eastern and a Western, or an Aryan and
a non-Aryan soul. The point
is that a rather complicated ideology and an
organization which furthered no immediate
interest proved to be more
at-
tractive than tangible advantages and commonplace convictions.
Despite their lack of success, with
its proverbial appeal
to the mob, the
pan-movements exerted from the beginning a much stronger attraction than
overseas imperialism. This popular appeal, which withstood tangible failures
and constant changes
of program, foreshadowed
later
totalitarian
groups
which were
similarly vague
as
to
actual
goals and
subject
to
day-to-day
changes of political
lines. What held the pan-movements' membership
to-
gether was much more a general mood than a clearly defined aim.
It
is true
that overseas imperialism also placed expansion as such above any program
of conquest and therefore took possession of every territory that offered
it-
self as an easy opportunity. Yet, however capricious
the export of super-
fluous money may have been,
it served to delimit the ensuing expansion; the
aims
of
the pan-movements
lacked even
this
rather
anarchic element
of
human planning and geographic restraint. Yet, though they had no specific
programs for world conquest, they generated an all-embracing mood of total
predominance, of touching and embracing all human issues, of "pan-human-
ism," as Dostoevski once put it.*"

the

lay

wjth
the mob, which was led then

still

the

to

they

and
they
were
aware
of
the
organizational,
not
merely
ideological or propaganda,
uses
to which race concepts can be put. Their
significance
is only superficially grasped
in the relatively modest theories of
foreign
policy—a Germanized
Central Europe
or
a
Russianized
Eastern
and Southern Europe—which served
as
starting points for
the world-con-
quest programs of Nazism and Bolshevism." The "Germanic peoples" out-
side
the
Reich
and
"our minor
Slavonic
brethren"
outside Holy
Russia
generated a comfortable smoke screen of national rights to self-determina-
tion, easy stepping-stones
to
further expansion.
Yet, much more
essential
was the fact that the totalitarian governments inherited an aura of holiness:
they had only to invoke the past of "Holy Russia" or "the Holy Roman Em-
pire" to arouse
all kinds of superstitions
in Slav or German
intellectuals.^*
Pseudomystical
nonsense,
enriched
by
countless
and
arbitrary
historical
memories, provided an emotional appeal that seemed to transcend, in depth
and breadth, the limitations of nationalism. Out of
it, at any rate, grew that
new kind of nationalist feeling whose
violence proved an
excellent motor
to
set mob masses
in motion and quite adequate
to replace the older na-
tional patriotism as an emotional center.
This new
type
of
tribal
nationalism, more
or
less
characteristic
of
all
Central and Eastern European nations and nationalities, was quite different
in content and significance—though not
in violence—from Western nation-
alist excesses. Chauvinism—now usually thought of in connection with the
"nationalisme integral" of Maurras and Barres around the turn of the cen-
tury, with
its romantic
glorification of the past and
its morbid cult of the
dead—even in
its most wildly fantastic manifestations, did not hold that men
of French origin, born and raised in another country, without any knowledge
of French language or culture, would be "born Frenchmen" thanks to some
mysterious
qualities of body or
soul. Only with
the "enlarged
tribal con-
sciousness" did that peculiar identification of nationality with one's own soul
emerge,
that
turned-inward
pride
that
is no
longer concerned
only
with
public
affairs but pervades every phase of private
life
until,
for example,
"the private
life of each true Pole ...
is a public
life of Polishness." ^^

is that the one
is extroverted, con-
cerned
with
visible
spiritual
and
material
achievements
of
the
nation,
whereas the other, even in its mildest forms (for example, the German youth

is introverted, concentrates on the individual's own soul which

as
the embodiment of general national
qualities. Chauvinist

still
points
to something
that

existed

this into a

existent pseudomystical elements which
it proposes
to
realize
fully
in
the
future. It can be easily recognized by the tremendous arrogance, inherent in
its self-concentration, which dares to measure a people,
its past and present,
by the yardstick of exalted inner qualities and inevitably rejects
its
visible
existence, tradition, institutions, and culture.
Politically speaking,
tribal nationalism always
insists that
its own people
is surrounded by "a world of enemies," "one against all," that a fundamental
difference exists between this people and all others. It claims
its people to be
unique, individual, incompatible with
all others, and denies theoretically the
very possibility of a common mankind lonjg before
it
is used to destroy the
humanity, of man.

JUST AS
continental imperialism sprang from

not participated
in national emancipation and had not achieved
the
sov-

in multinational Austria-Hungary and Russia, the pan-movements naturally
found their most fertile
soil. Moreover, since the Dual Monarchy harbored
both Slavic and German irredentist nationalities, Pan-Slavism and Pan-Ger-

the beginning on
its
destruction, and
Austria-
Hungary became

The
German-conceived
hlueprint for the economic union of Central Europe under German leader-
ship, along with
all similar continental-empire projects of the German Pan-
Cicrmans, changed at once, when Austrian Pan-Germans got hold of
it, into
a structure that would become "the center of German
life
all over the earth
and be allied with
all other Germanic states." "
It
is
self-evident
that
the
expansionist
tendencies
of Pan-Slavism were
as embarrassing to the Czar as the Austrian Pan-Germans' unsolicited pro-
fessions of loyalty to the Reich and disloyalty to Austria were to Bismarck."
For no matter how high national feelings occasionally ran, or how ridiculous
nationalistic claims might become
in
times of emergency,
as
long
as
they
were bound to a defined national territory and controlled by pride in a limited
nation-state
they
remained
within
limits which
the
tribalism
of
the
pan-
movements overstepped at once.
The modernity of the pan-movements may best be gauged from their en-
tirely new position on antisemitism. Suppressed minorities
like the Slavs in
Austria and
the Poles
in Czarist Russia were more
likely, because of their
conflict with
the government,
to discover
the hidden connections between
the Jewish communities and the European nation-states, and
this discovery
could easily lead to more fundamental hostility. Wherever antagonism to the
state was not identified with lack of patriotism, as in Poland, where
it was
a sign of Polish loyalty to be disloyal to the Czar, or in Austria, where Ger-
mans looked upon Bismarck as their great national figure,
this antisemitism
assumed more violent forms because the Jews then appeared as agents not
only
of an
oppressive
state machine but
of
a
foreign
oppressor. But
the
fundamental role of antisemitism in the pan-movements
is explained as
little
by the position of minorities as by the specific experiences which Schoenerer,
the protagonist of Austrian Pan-Germanism, had had
in
his
earlier career
when,
still a member of the Liberal Party, he became aware of the connec-
tions between
the Hapsburg monarchy and the Rothschilds' domination of
Austria's railroad system. =' This by
itself would hardly have made him an-
nounce that "we Pan-Germans regard antisemitism

The Czars'
attitude toward Pan-Slavism was much more equivocal because
the
Pan-
Slav conception of the
state included strong popular support
for despotic government.
Yet even under such tempting circumstances, the Czar refused to support^ the expan-
sionist demand of the Slavophiles and their successors. See Staehlin, op.

Russian writer Rozanov to pretend that "there
is no problem in Russian
life
in which
like a 'comma' there
is not
also the question: How to cof)e with
the Jew."'-'"'
The clue to the sudden emergence of antisemitism as the center of a whole
outlook on
life and the world—as distinguished from
its mere
political role
in France during the Dreyfus Affair or
its role
as an instrument of propa-
ganda
in the German Stoecker movement—lies
in the nature
of tribalism
rather than in political facts and circumstances. The true significance of the
pan-movements' antisemitism
is
that hatred
of the Jews was,
for
the
first
time, severed from all actual exp>erience concerning the Jewish people, polit-
ical, social, or economic, and followed only the peculiar logic of an ideology.
Tribal nationalism, the driving force behind continental imperialism, had
little in common with the nationalism of the fully developed Western nation-
state. The nation-state, with
its claim to popular representation and national
sovereignty,',
as
it had developed
since
the French Revolution through
the
nineteenth century, was the result of a combination of two factors that were
still separate in the eighteenth centurv' and remained separate in Russia and
Austria-Hungary: nationality and state. Nations entered the scene of history
and were emancipated when peoples had acquired a consciousness of them-
selves as cultural and historical entities, and of their territorv- as a permanent
home, where
history had
left
its
visible
traces, whose
cultivation was
the
product of the common labor of their ancestors and whose future would de-
pend upon
the
course
of
a common
civilization.
Wherever
nation-states
came into being, migrations came to an end, while, on the other hand, in the
Eastern and Southern European regions
the establishment of nation-states
failed because they could not fall back upon firmly rooted peasant classes.-'
Sociologically the nation-state was the body politic of the European emanci-
pated peasant classes, and this is the reason why national armies could keep
their permanent position within these
states only up to the end of the
last
centurv', that
is. only as long as they were truly representative of the
rural
class. "The Army,"' as Marx has pointed out, "was the 'point of honor" with
the
allotment
farmers:
it was
themselves
turned
into
masters,
defending
abroad
their newly established property.

IMPERIALISM
culminated
in
general
conscription was
the product of
firmly rooted and
emancipated peasant classes.
While consciousness of nationality
is a comparatively recent development,
the structure of the
state was derived from centuries of monarchy and en-
lightened despotism. Whether in the form of a new republic or of a reformed
constitutional monarchy, the state inherited as
its supreme function the pro-
tection of all inhabitants in
its territory no matter what their nationality, and
was supposed to act as a supreme legal institution. The tragedy of the nation-
state was that the people's rising national consciousness interfered with these
functions.
In
the name
of
the
will
of
the people
the
state was forced
to
recognize only "nationals" as citizens, to grant full civil and political rights
only to those who belonged to the national community by right of origin and
fact of birth. This meant that the state was partly transformed from an
in-
strument of the law into an instrument of the nation.
The conquest of the
state by the nation ^° was greatly facilitated by the
downfall of the absolute monarchy and the subsequent new development of
classes. The absolute monarch was supposed
to serve
the
interests
of
the
nation as a whole,
to be the visible exponent and proof of the existence of
such a common
interest.
The enlightened despotism was based on Rohan's
"kings command the peoples and interest commands the king"; ^" with the
abolition of the king and sovereignty of the people, this common interest was
in constant danger of being replaced by a permanent conflict among class in-
terests and struggle for control of the state machinery, that is, by a permanent
civil war. The only remaining bond between the
citizens of a nation-state
without
a monarch
to symbolize
their
essential community, seemed
to be
national, that
is, common origin. So that in a century when every class and
section
in the population was dominated by class or group interest, the inter-
est of the nation as a whole was supposedly guaranteed in a common origin,
which sentimentally expressed itself in nationalism.
The secret conflict between state and nation came to light at the very birth
of the modern nation-state, when the French Revolution combined the decla-
ration of the Rights of Man with the demand for national sovereignty. The
same essential rights were at once claimed as the inahenable heritage of
all
human beings and as the specific heritage of specific nations, the same nation
was
at once declared
to be subject
to laws, which supposedly would flow
from the Rights of Man, and sovereign, that
is, bound by no universal law
and acknowledging nothing superior to itself." The practical outcome of this
contradiction was
that from then on human
rights were protected and en-
forced only as national rights and that the very institution of a state, whose
supreme task was to protect and guarantee man his rights as man, as citizen

and as national, lost
its legal, rational appearance and could be interpreted
by the romantics as the nebulous representative of a "national soul" which
through the very fact of
its existence was supposed to be beyond or above
the law.
National sovereignty, accordingly,
lost
its original connotation of
freedom of the people and was being surrounded by a pseudomystical aura of
lawless arbitrariness.
Nationalism
is
essentially
the expression of
this perversion of the
state
into an instrument of the nation and the identification of the citizen with the
member of the nation. The relationship between state and society was de-
termined by
the
fact of
class
struggle, which had supplanted
the former
feudal order. Society was pervaded by liberal individualism which wrongly
believed that the state ruled over mere individuals, when in
reality
it ruled
over classes, and which saw in the state a kind of supreme individual before
which
all others had to bow. It seemed to be the will of the nation that the
state protect
it from the consequences of
its social atomization and,
at the
same time, guarantee its possibility of remaining in a state of atomization. To
be equal to this task, the state had to enforce
all earlier tendencies toward
centralization; only a strongly centralized administration which monopolized
all instruments of violence and power-possibihties could counterbalance the
centrifugal forces constantly produced in a class-ridden society. Nationalism,
then, became the precious cement for binding together a centralized
state
and an atomized society, and
it actually proved to be the only working, live
connection between the individuals of the nation-state.
Nationalism always preserved
this
initial intimate loyalty to the govern-
ment and never quite
lost
its function
of preserving a precarious balance
between nation and state on one hand, between the nationals of an atomized
society on the other. Native citizens of a nation-state frequently looked down
upon naturalized citizens, those who had received their rights by law and not
by birth, from the state and not from the nation; but they never went so
far
as
to
propose
the Pan-German
distinction
between
"Staatsfremde,"
aliens
of
the
state, and
"Volksjremde,"
aliens
of
the
nation, which was
later incorporated into Nazi legislation. Insofar as the state, even in
its per-
verted form, remained a legal institution, nationalism was controlled by some
law, and insofar as
it had sprung from the identification of nationals with
their territory,
it was limited by definite boundaries.
Quite different was the first national reaction of peoples for whom nation-
ality had not yet developed beyond the inarticulateness of ethnic conscious-
ness, whose languages had not yet outgrown the dialect stage through which
all European languages went before they became suited for literary purposes,
whose peasant classes had not struck deep roots in the country and were not
on the verge of emancipation, and
to whom, consequently,
their national
quality appeared
to be much more a portable
private matter,
inherent
in
their very personality, than a matter of public concern and civilization.^- If
32 Interesting in this context are the
socialist propositions of Karl Renner and Otto
Bauer in Austria to separate nationality entirely from
its territorial basis and to make
it a kind of personal status; this of course corresponded to a situation in which ethnic

they wanted
to match
the national pride of Western nations, they had no
country, no state, no historic achievement to show but could only point to
themselves, and that meant, at best,
to their language—as though language
by
itself were
already an achievement—at worst,
to
their
Slavic, or Ger-
manic, or God-knows-what
soul. Yet
in
a century which naively assumed
that
all
peoples were
virtually
nations
there was hardly anything
else
left
to the oppressed peoples of Austria-Hungary, Czarist Russia, or the Balkan
countries, where no
conditions
existed
for
the
realization
of
the Western
national
trinity of pcoplc-tcrritory-statc, where
frontiers had changed con-
stantly for many centuries and populations had been in a stage of more or
less continuous migration. Here were masses who had not the slightest idea
of the meaning of patria and patriotism, not the vaguest notion of responsi-
bility for a common, limited community. This was the trouble with the "belt
of mixed populations" (Macartney)
that stretched from
the
Baltic
to
the
Adriatic and found
its most articulate expression in the Dual Monarchy.
Tribal nationalism grew out of this atmosphere of rootlessness.
It spread
widely not only among the peoples of Austria-Hungary but also, though on
a higher level, among members of the unhappy intelligentsia of Czarist Rus-
sia. Rootlessness was the true source of that "enlarged tribal consciousness"
which
actually meant that members of these peoples had no definite home
but
felt
at home
wherever
other members
of
their
"tribe" happened
to
live.
"It
is our distinction," said Schoenerer,
".
.
.
that we do not gravi-
tate toward Vienna but gravitate to whatever place Germans may live in." ^^
The
hallmark
of
the pan-movements was
that
they
never even
tried
to
achieve national emancipation, but
at once,
in
their dreams
of expansion,
transcended the narrow bounds of a national community and proclaimed a
folk community
that would remain
a
political
factor even
if
its members
were dispersed
all over the earth. Similarly, and
in contrast to the true na-
tional
liberation movements of small peoples, which always began with an
exploration of the national past, they did not stop
to consider history but
projected the basis of their community into a future toward which the move-
ment was supposed to march.
Tribal nationalism, spreading through
all oppressed nationalities
in East-
em and Southern Europe, developed
into a new form of organization, the
pan-movements, among those peoples who combined some kind of national
home country, Germany and Russia, with a large, dispersed irredenta, Ger-
mans and Slavs abroad.^* In contrast to overseas
imperialism, which was
groups were dispersed
all over the empire without
losing any of their national char-
acter.

content with relative superiority, a national mission, or a white man's burden,
the pan-movements started with absolute claims to chosenness. Nationalism
has been frequently described as an emotional surrogate of religion, but only
the tribalism of the pan-movements offered a new religious theory and a new
concept of holiness.
It was not the Czar's religious function and position
in
the Greek Church that led Russian Pan-Slavs to the atVirmation of the Chris-
tian nature of the Russian people, of their being, according to Dostoevski,
the "Christopher among the nations" who carry God directly into the affairs
of this world. '•
It was because of claims to being "the true divine people of
modern times" '" that the Pan-Slavs abandoned their earlier liberal tenden-
cies
and,
notwithstanding governmental
opposition and
occasionally
even
persecution, became staunch defenders of Holy Russia.
Austrian
Pan-Germans
laid
similar
claims
to
divine
chosenness
even
though
they, with
a similar
liberal
past, remained
anticlerical and became
anti-Christians. When
Hitler, a self-confessed disciple of Schoenerer, stated
during the last war: "God the Almighty has made our nation. We are defend-
ing His work by defending
its very existence," ''
the
reply from
the other
side, from a follower of Pan-Slavism, was equally true to type: "The German
monsters are not only our foes, but God's foes."
'^ These recent formulations
were not born of propaganda needs of the moment, and this kind of fanati-
cism does not simply abuse
religious
language; behind
it
lies
a
veritable
theology which gave
the
earlier pan-movements
their momentum and
re-
tained a considerable influence on
the development of modern
totalitarian
movements.
The pan-movements preached the
divine
origin
of
their own people
as
against the Jewish-Christian faith in the divine origin of Man. According to
them, man, belonging inevitably to some people, received his divine origin
only
indirectly through membership
in a people. The individual,
therefore,
has
his divine value only
as long
as he belongs
to
the people singled out
for divine origin. He forfeits this whenever he decides to change his nation-
ality, in which case he severs
all bonds through which he was endowed with
dominated territory. See also Dcckcrt, op.
cit., who stated
in
1914:
"that Pan-Latinism
has declined more and more, and
that
nationalism and
state consciousness have
be-
come stronger and
retained a greater potential
there than anywhere
else
in Europe"

IMPERIALISM
divine origin and falls, as
it were, into metaphysical homelessness. The polit-
ical advantage of this concept was twofold.
It made nationality a permanent
quality which no longer could be touched by history, no matter what hap-
pened
to
a given people—emigration, conquest,
dispersion. Of even more
immediate impact, however, was
that in the absolute contrast between the
divine origin of one's own people and
all other nondivine peoples
all differ-
ences between
the individual members of the people disappeared, whether
social or economic or psychological. Divine origin changed the people into
a uniform "chosen" mass of arrogant robots.^^
The
untruth
of
this
theory
is
as conspicuous
as
its
poHtical
usefulness.
God created neither men—whose origin clearly
is procreation—nor peoples
—who came into being as the result of human organization. Men are unequal
according to their natural origin, their different organization, and fate in his-
tory. 1 heir equality is an equality of rights only, that is, an equality of human
purpose; yet behind
this equality of human purpose
lies, according to Jew-
ish-Christian
tradition,
another
equality, expressed
in
the concept
of one
common origin beyond human history, human nature, and human purpose
—the common origin in the mythical, unidentifiable Man who alone
is God's
creation. This divine
origin
is the metaphysical concept on which the polit-
ical equality of purpose may be based, the purpose of establishing mankind
on
earth.
Nineteenth-century
positivism and
progressivism
perverted
this
purpose of human equality when they set out to demonstrate what cannot be
demonstrated, namely,
that men are equal by nature and different only by
history and circumstances, so that they can be equalized not by rights, but
by circumstances and education. Nationalism and
its concept of a "national
mission" perverted the national concept of mankind as a family of nations
into
a hierarchical structure where
differences of history and organization
were misinterpreted as diflerences between men, residing in natural origin.
Racism, which denied the common origin of man and repudiated the common
purpose of estabUshing humanity, introduced the concept of the divine origin
of one people as contrasted with
all others, thereby covering the temporary
and changeable product of human endeavor with a pseudomystical cloud of
divine eternity and finality.
This
finality
is what acts as the common denominator between the pan-
movements' philosophy and race concepts, and explains
their inherent
af-
finity
in
theoretical
terms.
Politically,
it
is not important whether God or
nature
is thought to be the origin of a people; in both cases, no matter how
exalted the claim for one's own people, peoples are transformed into animal
species so that a Russian appears as different from a German as a wolf
is
from a fox. A "divine people" lives in a world in which
it
is the born perse-
»eThis was
already
recognized by
the
Russian
Jesuit,
Prince Ivan
S. Gagarin,
in
his
pamphlet

Russie

(1856)
in
which
he
attacked
the
Slavophiles because "they wish
to establish the most complete
religious,
political, and
national uniformity.
In their foreign policy, they wish to fuse
all Orthodox Christians
of whatever nationality, and all Slavs of whatever religion, in a great Slav and Orthodox
empire." (Quoted from Hans Kohn, op. cit.)

cutor of
all other weaker species, or the bom victim of
all other stronger
species. Only the rules of the animal kingdom can possibly apply to its polit-
ical destinies.
The tribalism of the pan-movements with its concept of the "divine origin"
of one people owed part of
its great appeal to
its contempt for liberal in-
dividualism/" the ideal of mankind and the dignity of man. No human dig-
nity
is
left
if the individual owes his value only to the fact that he happens
to be born a German or a Russian; but there is, in its stead, a new coherence,
a sense of mutual reliability among all members of the people which indeed
was very apt to assuage the rightful apprehensions of modern men as to what
might happen
to them
if, isolated individuals
in an atomized society, they
were
not
protected by
sheer numbers
and
enforced
uniform
coherence.
Similarly, the "belt of mixed populations," more exposed than other sections
of Europe to the storms of history and less rooted in Western tradition,
felt
earlier than other European peoples the terror of the ideal of humanity and
of the Judaeo-Christian faith in the common origin of man. They did not
harbor any illusions about the "noble savage," because they knew something
of the potentialities of evil without research into the habits of cannibals. The
more peoples know about one another, the less they want to recognize other
peoples as their equals, the more they recoil from the ideal of humanity.
The appeal of tribal isolation and master race ambitions was partly due
to an
instinctive
feeling
that mankind, whether a
religious
or humanistic
ideal, implies a common sharing of responsibility.*^ The shrinking of geo-
graphic distances made
this a political actuality of the
first order.*^
It also
made idealistic talk about mankind and the dignity of man an
affair of the
past simply because
all these
fine and dreamlike notions, with
their time-
honored traditions, suddenly assumed a terrifying timeliness. Even insistence
on the sinfulness of
all men, of course absent from the phraseology of the
liberal protagonists of "mankind," by no means suffices for an understand-
ing of the fact—which the people understood only too well—that the idea
^0 "People
will recognize
that man has no other
destination
in
this world but
to
work for the destruction of his personality and
its replacement through a
social and
unpersonal existence." Chaadayev, op.
cit. Quoted from Ehrenberg, op.
cit.,
p.
60.
*i The following passage
in Frymann, op.
cit., p.
186,
is characteristic: "We know
our own people,
its qualities and
its shortcomings—mankind we do not know and we
refuse
to care or get enthusiastic about
it. Where does

does
it end,

^2 It was
this shrinking of geographic distances that found an expression
in Fried-
rich Naumann's Central Europe: "The day

of hunKinily. purged of
all sentimentality, has the very serious consequence
that
in one form or another men must assume responsibihty
for
all crimes
committed by men, and that eventually
all nations will be forced to answer
for the evil committed by
all others.
Tribalism and racism
are the very
realistic,
if very
destructive, ways of
escaping
this
predicament
of common
responsibility.
Their
metaphysical
rootlessness, which matched so
well the
territorial uprootedness of the na-
tionalities
it
tirst seized, was equally well suited to the needs of the shifting
masses of modern
cities and was therefore grasped
at once by totalitarian-
ism; even the
fanatical adoption by the Bolsheviks of the
greatest
antina-
tional doctrine. Marxism, was counteracted and Pan-Slav propaganda rein-
troduced in Soviet Russia because of the tremendous isolating value of these
theories in themselves."'-'
It
is true that the system of rule
in Austria-Hungary and Czarist Russia
served as a veritable education
in
tribal nationalism, based
as
it was upon
the oppression of nationalities.
In Russia this oppression was the exclusive
monopoly of the bureaucracy which also oppressed the Russian people with
the
result
that only
the Russian
intelligentsia became
Pan-Slav. The Dual
Monarchy, on the contrary, dominated
its troublesome nationalities by giv-
ing
to them
just enough freedom
to oppress other
nationalities,
with
the
result
that
these became
the
real mass basis
for
the
ideology
of the pan-
movements. The
secret
of the
survival
of the House
of Hapsburg
in
the
nineteenth century
lay
in
careful
balance and support
of
a
supranational
machinery by
the mutual antagonism and
exploitation of Czechs by Ger-
mans, of Slovaks by Hungarians, of Ruthenians by Poles, and so on. For
all of them
it became
a matter of course
that one might achieve
nation-
hood
at
the expense of the others and
that one would gladly be deprived
of freedom
if the oppression came from one's own national government.
The two pan-movements developed without any help from
the Russian
or German governments. This did not prevent their Austrian adherents from
indulging
in the delights of high treason
against the Austrian government.
It was this possibility of educating masses in the spirit of high treason which
provided
Austrian pan-movements
with
the
sizable popular
support
they
always
lacked
in Germany and
Russia
proper.
It was
as much
easier
to
induce the German worker to attack the German bourgeoisie than the gov-
ernment, as
it was easier
in Russia "to arouse the peasants against squires
than against the Czar."

and Russian peasants were surely tremendous;
the former looked upon
a
not too beloved monarch
as
the symbol
of national
unity, and
the
latter
considered
the head
of
their government
to be
the
true
representative
of
God on earth. These differences, however, mattered
less than the fact that
neither in Russia nor in Germany was the government so weak as in Austria,
nor had
its
authority
fallen
into such
disrepute
that
the pan-movements
could make
political
capital out of revolutionary
unrest. Only
in
Austria
did the revolutionary impetus find
its natural outlet in the pan-movements.
The
(not very ably carried out)
device of divide et impera did
little to di-
minish
the
centrifugal tendencies of national sentiments, but
it succeeded
quite
well
in inducing superiority complexes and a general mood of
dis-
loyalty.
Hostility to the state as an institution runs through the theories of all pan-
movements. The
Slavophiles' opposition
to
the
state has been
rightly de-
scribed
as
"entirely
different from anything
to be found
in
the system
of
official nationalism";
*'•" the state by
its very nature was held to be alien to
the people. Slav superiority was felt to
lie in the Russian people's indiffer-
ence
to the
state,
in
their keeping themselves
as a corpus separatum from
their own government. This
is what the Slavophiles meant when they called
the Russians a "stateless people" and this made
it possible for these "liber-
als" to reconcile themselves to despotism;
it was in accord with the demand
of despotism that the people not "interfere with
state power," that
is, with
the absoluteness of that power.^" The Pan-Germans, who were more articu-
late politically, always insisted on the priority of national over state interest *^
and
usually argued
that "world
politics
transcends
the framework
of
the
state,"
that
the
only permanent
factor
in
the
course
of
history was
the
people and not states; and that therefore national needs, changing with cir-
cumstances, should determine,
at
all times, the political acts of the
state. ^*
But what in Germany and Russia remained only high-sounding phrases up to
the end of the first World War, had a real enough aspect in the Dual Mon-
archy whose decay generated a permanent
spiteful contempt for the gov-
ernment.
It would be a serious error to assume that the leaders of the pan-move-
ments were reactionaries or "counter-revolutionaries." Though as a rule not
too interested in social questions, they never made the mistake of siding with
capitalist
exploitation and most
of them had belonged, and

the Pan-German League "embodied a
real attempt
at popular
control
in foreign
alTairs.
It believed firmly
in the efficiency of a strong na-
tionally minded publie opinion ... and initiating national policies through
force of popular demand." » Except
that
the mob, organized
in
the pan-
movements and inspired by race ideologies, was not at
all the same people
whose revolutionary actions had led to constitutional government and whose
true representatives at that time could be found only
in the workers' move-
ments, but with
its "enlarged
tribal consciousness" and
its conspicuous lack
of patriotism resembled much rather a "race."
Pan-Slavism,
in contrast
to Pan-Germanism, was formed by and perme-
ated the whole Ru.ssian intelligentsia. Much less developed in organizational
form and much
less
consistent
in
political programs,
it maintained
for a
remarkably long time a very high
level of literary sophistication and philo-
sophical speculation. While Rozanov speculated about
the mysterious
dif-
ferences between Jewish and Christian sex power and came to the surpris-
ing conclusion
that
the Jews are "united with that power, Christians being
separated from
it,"
'"
the
leader of Austria's Pan-Germans cheerfully
dis-
covered devices to "attract the interest of the little man by propaganda songs,
post cards, Schocnerer beer mugs, walking sticks and matches. ^^ Yet eventu-
ally "Schelling and Hegel were discarded and natural science was called upon
to furnish the theoretical ammunition" by the Pan-Slavs as well.^^
Pan-Germanism, founded by a
single man, Georg von Schoenerer, and
chiefly supported by German-Austrian students, spoke from the beginning a
strikingly vulgar language, destined to appeal
to much larger and different
social
strata.
Schocnerer was consequently
also
"the
first
to
perceive
the
possibilities
of
antiscmitism
as an
instrument
for forcing
the
direction
of
foreign
policy and
disrupting ...
the
internal
structure
of
the
state." "
Some of the rea.sons for the suitability of the Jewish people for this purpose
arc obvious:
their very prominent
position
with
respect
to
the Hapsburg
monarchy together with
the fact that in a multinational country they were
more easily recognized as a separate nationality than in nation-states whose
citizens, at least in theory, were of homogeneous stock. This, however, while
it certainly explains the violence of the Austrian brand of antisemitism and
shows how shrewd a politician Schoenerer was when he exploited the issue,
docs not help us understand the central ideological role of antisemitism in
both pan-movements.

turned antisemitic only in the last decades of the nineteenth century; Schoe-
nerer the Pan-German had already openly announced his
hostility to state
institutions when many Jews were
still members of his party." In Germany,
where
the
Stoecker movement had
demonstrated
the
usefulness
of
anti-
semitism as a political propaganda weapon, the Pan-German League started
with a certain antisemitic tendency, but before 1918
it never went so far as
to exclude Jews from membership.^' The Slavophiles' occasional antipathy
to Jews turned into antisemitism
in the whole Russian intelligentsia when,
after the assassination of the Czar in
1881, a wave of pogroms organized
by the government brought the Jewish question into the focus of pubhc at-
tention.
Schoenerer, who discovered antisemitism at the same time, probably be-
came aware of its possibilities almost by accident: since he wanted above all
to destroy the Hapsburg empire,
it was not difficult to calculate the effect
of the exclusion of one nationality on a state structure that rested on a multi-
tude of nationalities. The whole fabric of this peculiar constitution, the pre-
carious balance of
its bureaucracy could be shattered
if the moderate op-
pression, under which all nationaUties enjoyed a certain amount of equality,
was undermined by popular movements. Yet, this purpose could have been
equally well served by the Pan-Germans' furious hatred of the Slav national-
ities, a hatred which had been well established long before the movement
turned antisemitic and which had been approved by its Jewish members.
What made
the antisemitism of
the pan-movements
so
effective
that
it
could survive the general decline of antisemitic propaganda during the de-
ceptive
quiet
that preceded
the outbreak
of the
first World War was
its
merger with the tribal nationalism of Eastern Europe. For there existed an
inherent affinity between the pan-movements' theories about peoples and the
rootless existence of the Jewish people.
It seemed the Jews were the one
perfect example of a people in the tribal sense, their organization the model
the pan-movements were striving to emulate,
their survival and their sup-
posed power the best proof of the correctness of racial theories.
If other nationalities
in the Dual Monarchy were but weakly rooted in
the soil and had little sense of the meaning of a common territory, the Jews
were the example of a people who without any home at all had been able to
keep
their
identity through
the centuries and could therefore be
cited
as
proof that no territory was needed to constitute a nationality.'"
If the pan-
movements insisted on the secondary importance of the state and the para-
mount importance of the people, organized throughout countries and not
necessarily represented in visible institutions, the Jews were a perfect model

really meant
that
they
believed they were
different and better
simply
because
they happend
to
be
born
as
Jews,
regardless
of Jewish
achievements and tradition.
It
is true enough that
this Jewish attitude,
this, as
it were, Jewish brand
of
tribal
nationalism, had been
the
result of the abnormal position of the
Jews
in modern states, outside the pale of society and nation. But the posi-
tion of these shifting ethnic groups, who became conscious of their nation-
ality only through
the example of other—Western—nations, and
later the
position of the uprooted masses of the big cities, which racism mobilized so
cflicicntly, was
in many ways very similar. They too were outside the pale
of siKiety. and they too were outside the political body of the nation-state
which seemed
to be
the only satisfactory
political organization of peoples.
In
the Jews they recognized
at once
their happier, luckier competitors be-
cause, as they saw
it, the Jews had found a way of constituting a society of
their own which, precisely because
it had no visible representation and no
normal political outlet, could become a substitute for the nation.
But what drove
the Jews into the center of these racial ideologies more
than anything else was the even more obvious fact that the pan-movements'
claim to chosenness could clash seriously only with the Jewish claim.
It did
not matter that the Jewish concept had nothing in common with the tribal
theories
about
the
divine
origin
of one's own
people. The mob was not
much concerned with such niceties of historical correctness and was hardly
aware of the dilTerence between
a Jewish mission
in history to achieve the
establishment
of mankind
and
its own
"mission"
to dominate
all
other
peoples on
earth. But

leaders of the pan-movements knew quite
well
that the Jews had divided the world, exactly as they had, into two halves

to be the luckier competitors who had inherited something, were recognized
for something which Gentiles had to build from scratch. ^^
It
is a "truism" that has not been made truer by repetition that antiscm-
itism
is only a form of envy. But in relation to Jewish chosenness
it
is true
enough. Whenever peoples have been separated from
action and achieve-
ments, when these natural
ties with the common world have broken or do
not exist for one reason or another, they have been inclined to turn upon
themselves in their naked natural givenness and to claim divinity and a mis-
sion to redeem the whole world. When this happens in Western civilization,
such peoples will invariably find the age-old claim of the Jews in their way.
This
is what the spokesmen of pan-movements sensed, and this
is why they
remained
so
untroubled by
the
realistic
question
of whether
the
Jewish
problem
in terms
of numbers ^nd power was important enough
to make
hatred of Jews the mainstay of their ideology. As their own national pride
was independent of all achievements, so their hatred of the Jews had eman-
cipated itself from
all specific Jewish deeds and misdeeds. In
this the pan-
movements
were
in complete
agreement,
although
neither knew how
to
utilize this ideological mainstay for purposes of political organization.
The time-lag between the formulation of the pan-movements' ideology and
the possibility of its serious political application
is demonstrated by the fact
that the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"—forged around 1900 by agents
of the Russian secret police in Paris upon the suggestion of Pobyedonostzev,
the political adviser of Nicholas
II, and the only Pan-Slav ever in an influ-
ential
position—remained
a
half-forgotten pamphlet
until
1919, when
it
began its veritably triumphal procession through all European countries and
languages;
"^^
its circulation some thirty years later was second only to Hit-
ler's Mein Kampf. Neither
the forger nor his employer knew
that a time
would come when the police would be the central institution of a society
and the whole power of a country organized according
to the supposedly
Jewish principles laid down in the Protocols. Perhaps
it was Stalin who was
the first to discover
all the potentialities for rule that the police possessed;
it
certainly was
Hitler who,
shrewder
than
Schoenerer
his
spiritual
father,
knew how to use the hierarchical principle of racism, how to exploit the anti-
semitic assertion of the existence of a "worst" people in order properly to
organize the "best" and all the conquered and oppressed in between, how to
generalize the superiority complex of the pan-movements so that each people,
with the necessary exception of the Jews, could look down upon one that
was even worse off than itself.
Apparently a few more decades of hidden chaos and open despair were
necessary before large strata of people happily admitted that they were going

to achieve what, as they believed, only Jews
in their innate devilisiiness had
K-cn able to achieve thus far. The leaders of the pan-movements, at any rate,
though
already
vaguely aware of
the
social question, were very one-sided
in their insistence on foreign policy. They therefore were unable to see that
antiscmitism
could form
the
necessary
link connecting domestic
with
ex-
ternal
methods;
they
did
not know
yet how
to
establish
their "folk com-
munity." that
is. the completely uprooted, racially indoctrinated horde.
That the pan-movements' fanaticism hit ipon the Jews as the ideological
center, which was the beginning of the end of European Jewry, constitutes
one of the most logical and most bitter revenges history has ever taken. For
of course
there
is some
truth
in "enlightened" assertions from Voltaire
to
Rcnan and Taine
that
the Jews' concept of chosenness,
their identification
of religion and nationality, their claim to an absolute position in history and
a
singlcd-out
relationship
with God, brought
into Western
civilization an
otherwise unknown element of fanaticism
( inherit .;d by Christianity with
its
claim
to exclusive possession of Truth) on one
side, and on the other an
clement of pride that was dangerously close to
its racial perversion.''^ Politi-
cally,
it was of no consequence that Judaism and an intact Jewish piety al-
ways were notably free of, and even hostile
to, the heretical immanence of
the Divine.
For
tribal nationalism
is the precise perversion of a religion which made
God choose one nation, one's own nation; only because
this ancient myth,
together with the only people surviving from antiquity, had struck deep roots
in Western civilization could the modern mob leader, with a certain amount
of plausibility, summon up the impudence to drag God into the petty con-
flicts between peoples and to ask His consent to an election which the leader
had
already
happily
manipulated."^ The hatred of
the
racists
against
the
Jews sprang from a superstitious apprehension that
it actually might be the
Jews, and
not
themselves, whom God had chosen,
to whom success was
granted by divine providence. There was an element of feeble-minded
re-
sentment against a people who,
it was feared, had received a rationally in-
comprehensible guarantee that they would emerge eventually, and in spite of
appearances, as the final victors in world history.

conquered Western mankind. Guided by
their own ridiculous superstition,
the leaders of the pan-movements found
that
little hidden cog
in
the me-
chanics of Jewish piety that made a complete reversion and perversion pos-
sible, so that chosenness was no longer the myth for an ultimate realization
of the ideal of a common humanity—but for its final destruction.
II:
The Inheritance of Lawlessness
OPEN DISREGARD for law and
legal
institutions and ideological
justification
of
lawlessness has been much more
characteristic
of
continental
than
of
overseas imperialism. This
is partly due to the fact that continental imperial-
ists lacked the geographical distance
to separate the
illegality of their rule
on foreign continents from the legality of their home countries' institutions.
Of equal importance
is the fact that the pan-movements originated in coun-
tries which had never known constitutional government, so that their lead-
ers naturally conceived of government and power in terms of arbitrary de-
cisions from above.
Contempt for law became characteristic of all movements. Though more
fully
articulated
in
Pan-Slavism
than
in Pan-Germanism
it
reflected
the
actual conditions of rule
in both Russia and Austria-Hungary. To describe
these two despotisms, the only ones left in Europe at the outbreak of the first
World War, in terms of multinational states gives only one part of the pic-
ture. As much as for their rule over multinational territories they were dis-
tinguished from other governments
in
that
they governed
the peoples
di-
rectly (and not only exploited them) by a bureaucracy; parties played
in-
significant roles, and parliaments had no legislative functions; the state ruled
through an administration that applied decrees. The significance of Parlia-
ment for the Dual Monarchy was
little more than that of a not too bright
debating
society. In Russia as well
as pre-war Austria serious opposition
could hardly be found there but was exerted by outside groups who knew
that
their
entering
the
parliamentary
system would
only
detract popular
attention and support from them.
Legally, government by bureaucracy
is government by decree, and
this
means that power, which in constitutional government only enforces the law,
becomes the direct source of all legislation. Decrees moreover remain anony-
mous (while laws can always be traced to specific men or assemblies), and
therefore seem to flow from some over-all ruling power that needs no justi-
fication.
Pobyedonostzev's contempt
for
the
"snares"
of
the law was
the
eternal contempt of the administrator for the supposed lack of freedom of
the legislator, who
is hemmed in by principles, and for the inaction of the
executors of law, who are restricted by
its interpretation. The bureaucrat.

7.^4
IMPERIALISM
who by merely administering decrees has the illusion of constant action, feels
tremendously
superior
to
these
"impractical"
people who
are
forever en-
tangled
in
"legal
niceties" and
therefore
stay outside
the sphere of power
which to him
is the source of everything.
Ihe
administrator
considers
the
law
to
be
powerless
because
it
is by
definition
separated from
its
application. The
decree, on
the
other hand,
does not exist at
all except
if and when
it
is applied;
it needs no justification
except
applicability.
It
is true that decrees are used by
all governments
in
times of emergency, but then the emergency
itself
is a clear justification and
automatic limitation. In governments by bureaucracy decrees appear in their
naked
purity
as though they were no longer issued by powerful men, but
were the incarnation of power itself and the administrator only
its accidental
agent. There are no general
principles which simple reason can understand
behind
the decree, but ever-changing circumstances which
only an expert
can know
in detail. People ruled by decree never know what rules them be-
cause of the
impossibility
of understanding decrees
in themselves and
the
carefully organized
ignorance of
specific circumstances and
their
practical
significance
in which
all administrators keep their subjects. Colonial imperi-
alism, which
also
ruled by decree and was sometimes even defined
as the
"rci;inu' dvs decrets,"''-" was dangerous enough; yet the very fact that the ad-
ministrators over native populations were imported and
felt to be usurpers,
mitigated
its influence on the subject peoples. Only where, as in Russia and
Austria, native rulers and a native bureaucracy were accepted as the
legiti-
mate government, could
rule by decree create the atmosphere of
arbitrari-
ness and .secretiveness which effectively hid
its mere expediency.
Rule by decree
has conspicuous advantages
for the domination
of
far-
flung territories with heterogeneous populations and for a policy of oppres-
sion.
Its
efficiency
is
superior simply
because
it
ignores
all
intermediary
stages between
issuance and
application, and because
it
prevents
political
reasoning by
the
people
through
the
withholding
of
information.
It
can
easily overcome the variety of local customs and need not rely on the neces-
sarily slow process of development of general law.
It
is most helpful for the
establishment
of
a
centralized
administration
because
it
overrides
auto-
matically
all matters of local autonomy.
If rule by good laws has sometimes
been called the
rule of wisdom,
rule by appropriate decrees may
rightly be
called the rule of cleverness. For
it
is clever to reckon with ulterior motives
and aims, and
it
is wise to understand and create by deduction from gen-
erally accepted principles.
Government by bureaucracy has to be distinguished from the mere out-
growth and deformation of civil services which frequently accompanied the
decline of the nation-state—as, notably, in France. There the administration
has survived
all changes
in regime
since
the
Revolution, entrenched
itself
like a parasite in the body politic, developed
its own class interests, and be-
come a useless organism whose only purpose appears to be chicanery and
prevention
of normal economic and
political development.

course many
superficial
similarities between the two types of bureaucracy,
especially
if one pays too much attention to the striking psychological simi-
larity of petty officials. But
if the French people have made the very serious
mistake
of accepting
their
administration
as
a
necessary
evil,
they
have
never committed
the
fatal
error of allowing
it
to
rule
the country—even
though the consequence has been that nobody rules
it. The French atmos-
phere
of government
has become one
of
inefficiency and
vexations;
but
it has not created an aura of pseudomysticism.
And
it
is this pseudomysticism that
is the stamp of bureaucracy when
it
becomes a form of government. Since the people
it dominates never really
know why something is happening, and a rational interpretation of laws does
not exist, there remains only one thing that counts, the brutal naked event
itself. What happens to one then becomes subject to an interpretation whose
possibilities
are
endless,
unlimited by
reason and unhampered by knowl-
edge. Within the framework
of such
endless
interpretative
speculation, so
characteristic
of
all
branches
of
Russian
pre-revolutionary
literature,
the
whole
texture
of
life and world assume
a
mysterious
secrecy
and
depth.
There
is
a dangerous charm
in
this
aura
because
of
its
seemingly
inex-
haustible richness; interpretation of suffering has a much larger range than
that of action for the former goes on
in the inwardness of the soul and re-
leases
all the possibilities of human imagination, whereas the
latter
is con-
stantly checked, and
possibly
led
into
absurdity, by outward consequence
and controllable experience.
One of the most glaring
differences between
the
old-fashioned
rule by
bureaucracy and the up-to-date totalitarian brand
is that Russia's and Aus-
tria's pre-war rulers were content with an
idle radiance of power and,
sat-
isfied to control
its outward
destinies,
left the whole inner
life of the soul
intact.
Totalitarian
bureaucracy,
with
a more complete
understanding
of
the meaning of absolute power, intruded upon the private individual and his
inner
life with equal brutality. The result of this radical efficiency has been
that the inner spontaneity of people under its rule was killed along with their
social and political
activities, so that the merely political
sterility under the
older bureaucracies was followed by total sterility under totalitarian rule.
The age which saw
the
rise
of the pan-movements,
however, was
still
happily ignorant of total
sterilization. On the contrary, to an innocent ob-
server (as most Westerners were) the so-called Eastern soul appeared to be
incomparably
richer,
its
psychology
more
profound,
its
literature
more
meaningful than that of the "shallow" Western democracies. This psycho-
logical and
literary adventure
into the "depths" of suffering did not come
to
pass
in
Austria-Hungary
because
its
literature
was
mainly German-
language literature, which after all was and remained part and parcel of Ger-
man
literature
in general. Instead of inspiring profound humbug, Austrian
bureaucracy rather caused its greatest modern writer to become the humorist
and
critic of the whole matter. Franz Kafka knew well enough the super-
stition of fate which possesses people who
live under the perpetual
rule of
accidents,
the
inevitable tendency
to
read
a
special superhuman meaning
into happenings whose
rational
significance

undcpiianding of the ccncemed. He was well aware of the weird attractive-
ness of such peoples,
their melancholy and beautifully sad folk
tales which
seemed so superior
to
the
lighter and brighter literature of more fortunate
peoples. He exposed
the
pride
in
necessity
as such, even
the
necessity of
evil, and
the
nauseating conceit which
identifies
evil and misfortune with
destiny. The miracle
is only
that he could do
this in a world
in which the
main elements of
this atmosphere were not fully articulated; he
trusted his
great powers of imagination
to draw
all
the necessary conclusions and,
as
it were,
to complete what reality had somehow neglected to bring into
full
focus."
Only the Russian Empire of that time offered a complete picture of rule
by bureaucracy.
1 he chaotic conditions of the country—too vast to be ruled,
populated by primitive peoples without experience
in political organization
of any kind, who vegetated under the incomprehensible overlordship of the
Russian bureaucracy—conjured up an atmosphere of anarchy and hazard in
which
the conflicting whims of petty officials and the daily accidents of in-
competence and inconsistency inspired a philosophy that saw
in the Acci-
dent
the
true Lord of
Life, something
like
the apparition of Divine Prov-
idence.** To the Pan-Slav who always insisted on the so much more "inter-
esting" conditions
in Russia against the shallow boredom of civilized coun-
tries,
it looked as though the Divine had found an intimate immanence in
the soul
of the unhappy Russian people, matched nowhere
else on
earth.
In an unending stream of literary variations the Pan-Slavs opposed the pro-
fundity and violence of Russia to the superficial banality of the West, which
did not know suffering or the meaning of sacrifice, and behind whose sterile
civilized surface were hidden frivolity and triteness. "^^ The totalitarian move-
ments
still owed much of
their appeal
to
this vague and embittered
anti-
*' Sec especially the magnificent story in The Castle (1930) of the Barnabases, which
reads
like a weird travesty of a piece of Russian
literature. The family
is
living under
a curse, treated
as
lepers
till they
feel themselves
such, merely because one of their
pretty daughters once dared
to
reject the indecent advances of an important
official.
The plain
villagers, controlled to the
last
detail by a bureaucracy, and slaves even
in
their
thoughts
to
the whims
of
their
all-powerful
officials, had
long
since come
to
realize
that
to be
in
the
right or to be
in the wrong was for them a matter of pure
"fate" which
they could
not
alter.
It
is
not, as K. naively assumes, the sender of an
obscene
letter who
is exposed,
but
the
recipient who becomes branded and
tainted.
This
is what
the
villagers mean when
they speak of
their
"fate."
In
K.'s
view,
"it's
unjust and monstrous, but
|he
is)
the only one
in
the
village of that opinion.'
«« Dcitkalion of accidents serves of course
as
rationalization
for every people
that
is not master of
its own destiny. See for instance Steinberg, op.

Western mood that was especially in vogue in pre-Hitler Germany and Aus-
tria, but had seized
the general European
intelligentsia of the twenties
as
well. Up to the moment of actual seizure of power, they could use this pas-
sion
for
the profound and
rich
"irrational," and during
the
crucial years
when the exiled Russian intelligentsia exerted a not negligible influence upon
the spiritual mood of an entirely disturbed Europe,
this purely literary
atti-
tude proved to be a strong emotional factor in preparing the ground for total-
itarianism."*
Movements, as contrasted to parties, did not simply degenerate into bu-
reaucratic jnachines,"^ but saw
in bureaucratic regimes possible models of
organization. The admiration which inspired the Pan-Slav Pogodin's descrip-
tion of the machine of Czarist Russian bureaucracy would have been shared
by them
all: "A tremendous machine, constructed after the simplest prin-
ciples, guided by the hand of one man
.
.
. which sets
it in motion at every
moment with
a single movement, no matter which direction and speed he
may choose. And
this
is not merely a mechanical motion,
the machine
is
entirely animated by inherited emotions, which are subordination,
limitless
confidence and devotion to the Czar who
is their God on earth. Who would
dare to attack us and whom could we not force into obedience?"
'^^
Pan-Slavists were less opposed to the state than their Pan-Germanist col-
leagues. They sometimes even
tried
to convince
the Czar
to become
the
head of the movement. The reason for
this tendency
is of course that the
Czar's position differed considerably from that of any European monarch,
the Emperor of Austria-Hungary not excluded, and
that the Russian des-
potism never developed into a rational
state
in the Western sense but re-
mained fluid, anarchic, and unorganized. Czarism, therefore, sometimes ap-
peared
to
the
Pan-Slavists
as
the symbol of a gigantic moving force
sur-
rounded by a halo of unique holiness.

in
the
ideologies which
Continental
parties had
already developed
to
a considerable
extent. The
difference
in
their use of ideology was that
they not only added ideological
justification to
interest representation, but
used ideologies as organizational principles.
If the parties had been bodies
for the organization of class interests, the movements became embodiments
of ideologies.
In other words, movements were "charged with philosophy"
and claimed they had
set
into motion "the
individualization of the moral
universal within a collective." ^^
It
is true that concretization of ideas had
first been conceived in Hegel's
theory of state and history and had been further developed in Marx's theory
of the proletariat as the protagonist of mankind.
It
is of course not acci-
dental that Russian Pan-Slavism was as much influenced by Hegel as Bol-
shevism was
influenced by Marx. Yet
neither Marx nor Hegel assumed
actual human beings and actual parties or countries to be ideas in the flesh;
both believed in the process of history in which ideas could be concretized
only in a complicated dialectical movement.
It needed the vulgarity of mob
leaders to hit upon the tremendous
possibilities of such concretization for
the organization of masses. These men began to
tell the mob that each of
its members could become such a lofty all-important walking embodiment
of something ideal
if he would only join the movement. Then he no longer
had to be loyal or generous or courageous, he would automatically be the
very incarnation of Loyalty, Generosity, Courage. Pan-Germanism showed
itself somewhat
superior
in
organizational
theory,
insofar
as
it
shrewdly
deprived
the
individual German
of
all these wondrous
qualities
if he
did
not adhere to the movement (thereby foreshadowing the spiteful contempt
which Nazism
later expressed
for the non-Party members
of
the German
people), whereas Pan-Slavism, absorbed deeply in
its limitless speculations
about the Slav soul, assumed that every Slav consciously or unconsciously
possessed such a soul no matter whether he was properly organized or not.
It needed
Stalin's ruthlessness
to introduce into Bolshevism the same con-
tempt for the Russian people that the Nazis showed toward the Germans.
I t is
this absoluteness of movements which more than anything else sep-
arates them from party structures and their partiality, and serves to justify
their claim
to overrule
all objections of individual conscience. The partic-
ular
reality of
the
individual person appears against the background of a
spurious reality of the general and universal, shrinks into a negligible quan-
tity or
is submerged
in
the stream of dynamic movement of the universal
itself.
In
this
stream
the
difference between ends and means
evaporates
together with
the personality, and
the
result
is
the monstrous immorality
of ideological politics. All that matters is embodied in the moving movement
itself; every
idea, every
value has vanished
into
a welter of
superstitious
pseudoscientific immanence.

IMPERIALISM
III:
Party and Movement
THi
STRIKING
iind
fatcful
difference between continental and overseas im-
perialism has been that their
initial successes and failures were in exact op-
position.
While continental
imperialism, even
in
its
beginnings, succeeded
in
realizing
the
imperialist
hostility
against
the
nation-state by organizing
large
strata of people
outside
the
party
system, and always
failed
to
get
results
in tangible expansion, overseas imperialism, in
its mad and success-
ful
rushes
to annex more and more
far-flung
territories, was
never
very
successful when
it attempted to change the home countries'
political struc-
ture. The nation-state system's ruin, having been prepared by
its own over-
seas imperialism, was eventually carried out by those movements which had
originated outside
its own realm. And when
it came to pass that movements
began
successfully
to compete with
the
nation-state's party system,
it was
also seen
that they could undermine only countries with
a multiparty
sys-
tem,
that mere
imperialist
tradition was not
sufficient
to
give them mass
appeal, and
that Great
Britain,
the
classic country of two-party
rule,
did
not produce
a movement
of
either
Fascist
or Communist
orientation
of
any consequence outside her party system.
The slogan "above the parties," the appeal to "men of
all parties," and
the boast that they would "stand far removed from the
strife of parties and
represent only a national purpose" was equally characteristic of all imperial-
ist groups,"* where
it appeared as a natural consequence of their exclusive
interest
in
foreign
policy
in which
the
nation was supposed
to
act
as
a
whole in any event, independent of classes and parties."^ Since, moreover, in
the Continental systems
this
representation of
the nation
as
a whole had

The
Pan-German
League
always
insisted on
its
being
"above
the
parties;
this was
and
is a
vital condition
for the League" (Otto Bonhard, op.
cit.). The
first
real party
that claimed to be more than a
party, namely an "imperial party," was the National-
Liberal
Party
in
Germany
under
the
leadership
of
Ernst
Bassermann
(Frymann,
op.
lit.).
In
Russia,
the
Pan-Slavs needed only
to pretend
to be nothing more than popular
support
for the government,
in order to be removed from
all competition with parties;
for
the government
as
"the Supreme Power
in
action
.
.
. cannot be understood
as
related
to
parties." Thus M.

"This
clearly
was
still
the
purpose
of
the
early
"beyond
party" groups among
which up
to
1918 the Pan-German League must
still be counted. "Standing outside of
all organized political parties, we may go our purely national way. We do not ask: Are
you

Are
you

been the "monopoly" of the
state,'^"
it could even seem that the imperialists
put
the
state's
interests above everything
else,
or that
the
interest of the
nation as a whole had found
in them
its long-sought popular support. Yet
despite
all such claims
to
true popularity
the
"parties above
parties"
re-
mained small societies of intellectuals and well-to-do people who,
like the
Pan-German League, could hope
to
find
a larger appeal only
in times of
national emergencyJ^
The
decisive
invention
of the pan-movements,
therefore, was
not
that
they too claimed to be outside and above the party system, but that they
called themselves "movements,"
their very name alluding to the profound
distrust for
all parties that was already widespread in Europe
at the turn
of the century and finally became so decisive that in the days of the Weimar
Republic,
for instance,
"oach new group believed
it could
find no
better
legitimization and no
better appeal
to
the masses than
a
clear
insistence
that it was not a 'party' but a 'movement.' "'*'
It is true that the actual disintegration of the European party system was
brought
about,
not by
the pan-
but by
the
totalitarian movements. The
pan-movements, however, which found their place somewhere between the
small and comparatively harmless
imperialist
societies and the
totalitarian
movements,
were
forerunners
of
the
totalitarians,
insofar
as
they
had
already discarded the element of snobbery so conspicuous in
all imperialist
leagues, whether the snobbery of wealth and birth in England or of educa-
tion in Germany, and therefore could take advantage of the deep popular
hatred for those institutions which were supposed to represent the people.
'''*
It
is not surprising that the appeal of movements
in Europe has not been
hurt much by the defeat of Nazism and the growing fear of Bolshevism.
As matters stand now, the only country in Europe where Parliament
is not
despised and the party system not hated
is Great Britain.^"
'"Carl Schmitt, Stuat, Bewegung, Volk (1934). speaks of the "monopoly of politics
which the state had acquired during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."
''' Wertheimer,

depicts
the
situation
quite
correctly when
she
says:
"That
there was any
vital connection
before
the war between
the Pan-German League and
the imperial government
is entirely preposterous." On the other hand,
it was perfectly
true that German policy during the
first World War was decisively influenced by Pan-
Germans because
the
higher
officer corps
had become
Pan-German.

252
IMPERIALISM
Faced with the stability of political institutions in the British
Isles and the
simultaneous decline of
all
nation-states on the Continent, one can hardly
avoid
concluding
that
the
difference
between
the
Anglo-Saxon
and
the
Continental
party
system
must
be
an
important
factor.
For
the
merely
material
differences between
a
greatly
impoverished England and
an un-
dcstroyed France were not great after the close of this war; unemployment,
the greatest revolutionizing factor
in prewar Europe, had
hit England even
harder than many Continental countries; and the shock to which England's
political
stability was being exposed
right
after the war through the Labor
Government's
liquidation
of
imperialist government
in
India and
its
ten-
tative
efforts
to rebuild an English world policy along nonimperialist
lines
must have been tremendous. Nor does mere
difference
in
social
structure
account
for the
relative
strength of Great
Britain;
for the economic
basis
of her social system has been severely changed by the socialist Government
without any decisive change
in
political
institutions.
Behind
the
external
difference between
the Anglo-Saxon two-party and
the
Continental
multiparty system
lies
a fundamental
distinction between
the
party's function within the body
politic, which has great consequences
for the party's attitude to power, and the
citizen's position in
his
state.
In
the
two-party
system
one
party
always
represents
the
government
and
actually rules the country, so that, temporarily, the party in power becomes
identical with
the
state. The
state,
as a permanent guarantee of the coun-
try's unity,
is represented only in the permanence of the office of the King*^^
( for the permanent Undersecretaryship of the Foreign Office
is only a mat-
ter of continuity). As the two parties are planned and organized for
alter-
nate
rule,"*-
all branches
of the
administration
are planned and organized
for alternation. Since the rule of each party
is limited in time, the opposition
party
exerts
a
control
whose
efficiency
is
strengthened by
the
certainty
that
it
is
the
ruler of tomorrow.
In
fact,
it
is
the
opposition
rather than
the symbolic position of the King that guarantees the integrity of the whole
against one-party
dictatorship. The obvious advantages of
this system
are
that
there
is
no
essential
difference between government and
state,
that
power as well as the state remain within the grasp of the citizens organized
in the
party, which represents the power and the
state
either of today or
of tomorrow, and that consequently there
is no occasion for indulgence
in
lofty
speculations about Power and
State
as though they were something
beyond human
reach,
metaphysical
entities
independent
of
the
will
and
action of the citizens.

CONTINENTAL IMPERIALISM: THE PAN-MOVEMENTS
253
The Continental party system supposes that each party defines
itself con-
sciously as a part of the whole, which in turn is represented by a state above
parties.**^ A one-party
rule therefore can only
signify
the
dictatorial dom-
ination of one part over
all others. Governments formed by
alliances be-
tween party leaders are always only party governments, clearly distinguished
from
the
state which
rests
above
and beyond
them.
One
of
the
minor
shortcomings of this system
is that cabinet members cannot be chosen
ac-
cording to competence, for too many parties are represented, and ministers
are
necessarily chosen according
to
party
alliances; ^^^
the
British
system,
on the other hand, permits a choice of the best men from the large ranks
of one party. Much more relevant, however,
is the fact that the multiparty
system never allows any one man or any one party to assume
full responsi-
bility, with the natural consequence
that no government, formed by party
alliances, ever feels fully responsible. Even
if the improbable happens and
an absolute majority of one party dominates Parliament and results in one-
party
rule,
this can only end either
in dictatorship, because
the system
is
not prepared for such government, or in the bad conscience of a
still truly
democratic leadership which, accustomed to thinking of
itself only
as part
of the whole, will naturally be afraid of using its power. This bad conscience
functioned
in
a
well-nigh exemplary
fashion when,
after
the
first World
War, the German and Austrian
Social Democratic
parties emerged
for
a
short moment as absolute majority parties, yet repudiated the power which
went with
this
position.
'^^
Since
the
rise
of the
party systems
it has been
a
matter
of course
to
identify parties with particular interests, economic or
others,**** and
all Con-
"^ The best account of the essence of the Continental
party system
is given by the
Swiss
jurist Johann Caspar
Bluntschli,
Charakter
unci Geist der politischen
Parteien,
1869. He
states:
"It
is
true
that a
party
is only
part
of a
greater whole,
never
this
whole
itself. ...
It
must
never
identify
itself
with
the
whole,
the
people
or
the
state
.
.
.
; therefore a party may fight against other
parties, but
it must never ignore
them and
usually must
not want
to destroy them. No
party can
exist
all by
itself"
(p.
3). The same idea
is expressed by Karl
Rosenkranz,
a German Hegelian philoso-
pher,
whose book on
political
parties
appeared
before
parties
existed
in Germany:
Ueber den Begriff der politischen Partei
( 1843):
"Party
is conscious partiality"
(p. 9).
^^ See
John
Gilbert
Heinberg,
Comparative Major
European
Governments, New
York,
1937, chapters vii and
viii. "In England one political party usually has a majority
in
the House
of Commons, and
the
leaders
of
the
party
are members
of
the Cab-
inet. ...
In France, no
political party
in
practice ever has a
majority of the mem-
bers of the Chamber of Deputies, and, consequently, the Council of Ministers
is com-
posed of the leaders of a number of party groups"
(p.
158).
'^^ See Demokratie and Partei, ed. by Peter R. Rohden, Vienna,
1932, Introduction:
"The
distinguishing
characteristic
of German
parties
is
.
.
.
that
all

tincntal
parties, not only the labor groups, have been very frank in admit-
ting this as long as they could be sure
that
a

parties exerts
its
power more or
less
in
the
interest
of
all.

the
contrary,

"particular
principle"

is
itself
the
actual
or
future
state
of
the
country;
particular
interests
are represented
in the party
itself,
as
its
right and
left
wmg, and
held
in check by the very
necessities of government. And since
in
the two-party system
a
party cannot
exist
for any
length
of time
if
it
dt-tcs not win enough strength
to assume power, no theoretical justification
IS needed, no ideologies are developed, and the peculiar fanaticism of Con-
tinental
party
strife, which
springs
not
so much from
conflicting
interests
as from antagonistic ideologies,
is completely absent. ^^
The
trouble
with
the
Continental
parties,
separated on
principle from
government and power, was not so much that they were trapped in the nar-
rowness of particular interests as that they were ashamed of these interests
and
therefore
developed
those
justifications
which
led each
one
into
an
ideology claiming that
its particular
interests coincided with the most gen-
eral interests of humanity. The conservative party was not content to defend
the interests of landed property but needed a philosophy according to which
God had created man
to
till
the
soil by the sweat of his brow. The same
is
true
for
the
progress
ideology
of
the
middle-class
parties
and
for
the
labor
parties'
claim
that
the
proletariat
is
the
leader
of
mankind.
This
strange combination of lofty philosophy and down-to-earth interests
is para-
doxical
only
at
first
glance.
Since
these
parties
did
not
organize
their
members
(or
educate
their
leaders)
for
the
purpose
of
handling
public
affairs, but
represented them only as private individuals with
private inter-
ests,
they had
to cater
to
all
private
needs,
spiritual
as
well
as
material.
In
other
words,
the
chief
difference
between
the
Anglo-Saxon
and
the
Continental
party
is
that
the former
is
a
political organization of
citizens
who need
to
"act
in concert"
in order to
act
at
all,^'* while
the
latter
is

in
Parliament.
In
Sweden,

Social

Party was

party

parties were frankly based upon protection of
interests; the German Conservative
Party
for
instance
developed
from
the
"Association

in

Interests were
not
necessarily economic, however.

the organization of private individuals who want
their interests to be pro-
tected against interference from public
affairs.
It is consistent with this system that the Continental state philosophy rec-
ognized men to be citizens only insofar as they were not party members,
i.e.,
in their individual unorganized relationship to the state
{Staatsbiirger) or in
their
patriotic enthusiasm
in
times
of emergency
{citoyens) .^^
This was
the unfortunate
result of the transformation of the
citoyen
of the French
Revolution into the bourgeois of the nineteenth century on one hand, and
of the antagonism between
state and
society on
the
other. The Germans
tended to consider patriotism an obedient self-oblivion before the
authori-
ties
and
the
French
an
enthusiastic
loyalty
to
the phantom
of
"eternal
France." In both
cases,
patriotism meant an abandonment of one's
party
and partial
interests
in favor of the government and the
national
interest.
The point
is that such nationalistic deformation was almost inevitable in a
system that created political parties out of private interests, so that the pub-
lic good had to depend upon force from above and a vague generous
self-
sacrifice from below which could be
achieved only by
arousing national-
istic
passions.
In
England, on
the
contrary,
antagonism between
private
and national
interest never played
a
decisive
role
in
politics. The more,
therefore, the party system on the Continent corresponded to class interests,
the more urgent was the need of the nation for nationalism, for some pop-
ular expression and support of national
interests, a support which England
with
its direct government by party and opposition never needed so much.
If we consider the difference between the Continental multiparty and the
British
two-party
system
with
regard
to
their
predisposition
to
the
rise
of movements,
it seems plausible that
it should be
easier for
a one-party
dictatorship
to
seize
the
state machinery
in
countries where
the
state
is
above the parties, and thereby above the citizens, than in those where the
citizens by
acting
"in
concert,"
i.e., through
party
organization,
can win
power legally and feel themselves to be the proprietors of the
state
either
of today or of tomorrow.
It appears even more plausible that the mystifica-
no men could act with confidence, who were not bound together by common opinions,
common
affections, and common
interests."
^° For
the
Central European concept
of
citizen
(the
Staatsbiirger)
as opposed
to
party member,
see
Bluntschli,
op.
cit.:
"Parties
are
not
state
institutions,
.
.
.
not
members of the
state organism, but
free social
associations whose formations depend
upon
a changing membership
united
for common
political
action by
a
definite con-
viction." The
difference between
state and
party
interest
is
stressed
time and
again:
"The
party must
never
put
itself above
the
state, must
never put
its
party
interest
above the state interest"
(pp. 9 and
10).
Burke, on
the
contrary,
argues
against
the
concept
according
to which
party
in-
terests or party membership make a man
a worse
citizen. "Commonwealths are made
of families, free commonwealths of parties
also; and we may
as well affirm
that our
natural regards and ties of blood tend inevitably to make men bad citizens, as that the
bonds of our party weaken
those by which we
are held
to our country"
{op.
cit.).
Lord John Russell, On Party (1850), even goes one step further when he asserts that
the
chief of the good
effects of
parties
is
"that
it
gives a substance
to
the shadowy
opinions of politicians, and attaches them
to steady and
lasting principles."

The ahenation of the masses from government, which was the beginning

with

different
in
France and
other Western democracies on one hand, and
in
the
Central
European
countries, Germany
chiefly, on
the
other.
In Germany, where
the
state was by
definition above the

In France, ruled by party
alliances, no
real
government
has
been
possible
since
the
establishment
of
the
Third
Republic and
its
fantastic
record
of
cabinets. Her weakness was
the op-
posite of the German one; she had liquidated the state which was above the
parties and
above
Parliament
without
reorganizing her
party system
into
a body capable of governing. The government necessarily became
a
ridic-
ulous
exponent
of
the
ever-changing
moods
of
Parliament
and
public
opinion. The German system, on the other hand, made Parliament a more
or
less
useful
battlefield
for conflicting
interests and opinions whose main
function
was
to
influence
the government
but
whose
practical
necessity
in the handling of state
affairs was, to say the
least, debatable.
In France,
the
parties
suffocated
the government;
in Germany, the
state emasculated
the parties.
Since the end of the
last century, the repute of these Constitutional par-
liaments and
parties has
constantly
declined;
to
the
people
at
large
they
looked
like expensive and unnecessary
institutions. For
this
reason
alone
each group that claimed to present something above party and class

^ts and

a
great Chance
for popularity."
Such groups

in appearance only,
for the true
goal of every "party above parties" was to promote one particular interest
until
it
had
devoured
all
others,
and
to make
one
particular group
the
master of the
state machine. This
is what
finally happened
in
Italy under

In Germany
ihc

asked
of
those

to
be
"above

Against
this
spirit of the
old
Prussian
civil
service
the Nazis asserted
the
priority
of
the
Party,
because
they
wanted
dictatorship.
Goebbels demanded
explicitly:
"Each
party member who becomes
a
state
functionary
has
to remain
a National
Socialist
first ... and to co-operate closely with the party administration" (quoted from GoU-
fried Neesse, Pariei
iinJ Staat,
1939,
p. 28).

CONTINENTAL IMPERIALISM: THE PAN-MOVEMENTS
251
Mussolini's Fascism, which up
to
1938 was
not
totalitarian
but
just
an
ordinary
nationalist
dictatorship
developed
logically
from
a
multiparty
democracy. For
there
is
indeed some
truth
in
the
old
truism
about
the
affinity between majority rule and dictatorship, but this
affinity has nothing
whatever to do with totalitarianism.
It
is obvious
that,
after many decades
of inefficient and muddled multiparty
rule, the seizure of the
state for the
advantage of one party can come
as
a
great
relief because
it
assures
at
least, though only for a limited time, some consistency, some permanence,
and a little less contradiction.
The
fact that the seizure
of power by
the Nazis was
usually
identified
with
such
a
one-party
dictatorship
merely
showed how much
political
thinking was
still rooted in the old established patterns, and how
little the
people
were prepared
for what
really was
to
come.
The
only
typically
modern aspect of the Fascist party dictatorship
is that here,
too, the party
insisted
that
it was
a movement;
that
it was
nothing
of
the
kind,
but
merely usurped
the
slogan "movement"
in
order
to
attract
the
masses,
became evident
as soon
as
it
seized the
state machine without
drastically
changing the power structure of the country, being content to
fill
ail gov-
ernment positions with party members.
It was
precisely through the iden-
tification
of
the
party
with
the
state,
which
both
the
Nazis
and
the
Bolsheviks
have
always
carefully
avoided,
that
the
party
ceased
to
be
a "movement" and became tied to the basically stable structure of the
state.
Even though the totalitarian movements and their predecessors, the pan-
movements, were
not
"parties
above
parties"
aspiring
to
seize
the
state
machine but movements aiming
at the destruction of the
state,
the Nazis
found
it very convenient to pose as such, that
is, to pretend to follow faith-
fully the
Italian model of Fascism. Thus they could win the help of those
upper-class and business
elite who mistook the Nazis for the older groups
they had
themselves
frequently
initiated
and
which had made
only th^^
rather modest pretense
of conquering
the
state machine
for one
party. ^^
The businessmen who helped Hitler into power naively believed that they
were only supporting a dictator, and one of their own making, who would
naturally rule to the advantage of their own class and the disadvantage of
all others.
The imperialist-inspired "parties above parties" had never known how to
profit from popular hatred
of the
party system
as
such; Germany's
frus-
trated pre-war imperialism, in spite of
its dreams of continental expansion
and
its
violent
denunciation
of
the
nation-state's
democratic
institutions,
never reached the scope of a movement.
It certainly was not
sufficient to
haughtily discard class
interests,
the very foundation of the
nation's party
system,
for
this
left them
less appeal than even the ordinary
parties
still
^^ Such

What

high-sounding

a

or

the German
Pan-Germans,

Ludendorff and

recognized
this
error
and
tried
to make up
for

they
failed

their remarkable
ability
to appeal to the most

of the masses because they clung to an outdated nontotalitarian state wor-
ship

could
not
understand
that
the
masses'
furious
interest
in
the
so-called
"suprastate
powers"
{iiberstaatliche
Mdchte)—i.e.,
the
Jesuits,
the Jews, and the Freemasons—did not spring from nation or state worship
but, on the contrary, from envy and the desire also to become a "suprastate
power." "^
The
only countries where
to

state
idolatry and
nation
worship were not yet outmoded and where
nationalist slogans
against the

to

degree,
Spain

Portugal,

had
actually
suffered
a

hindrance
to
their
full
national development through the power of the Church.
It was partly due
to
this
authentic
element
of
belated
national development and
partly
to
the wisdom of the Church, which very sagely recognized that Fascism was
neither
anti-Christian nor
totalitarian
in
principle and
only
established
a
separation
of Church and
State which
already
existed
in other
countries,
that
the
initial
anticlerical
flavor
of
Fascist
nationalism
subsided
rather
quickly and gave way to
a modus vivendi as
in
Italy, or to a positive
al-
liance, as
in Spain and Portugal.

regards
the
Fascists,
their
movement had come
to an end with
the
seizure
of power,
at
least with
respect to domestic
policies; the movement could now maintain
its motion
only in matters of foreign policy, in the sense of imperialist expansion and
typically
imperialist
adventures.
Even
before
the
seizure
of
power,
the
Nazis
clearly kept
aloof from
this
Fascist form
of
dictatorship,
in which
the
"movement"
merely
serves
to

totfi'jtarian movements
is
best
illustrated by
their
attitude toward the army, thatis, toward the na-

who destroyed
the
spirit of the army by
subordinating
it
to
the
political
commissars
or
totalitarian
elite
formations,
the
Fascists
could
use
such
intensely
nationalist
instruments
as
the
army,
with which
they
identified
themselves
as they had
identified themselves with
the
state. They wanted
a Fascist
state and a Fascist army, but
still an army and
a
state; only
in
Nazi Germany
and
Soviet
Russia army
and
state
became
subordinated
functions
of the movement. The
Fascist
dictator—but
neither
Hitler nor
Stalin—was the only true usurper in the sense of classical
political theory,
and his one-party rule was in a sense the only one
still intimately coimected
with
the
multiparty
system. He
carried
out
what
the
imperialist-minded

societies, and
"parties above

at,
so that
it
is

This
•A-as
possible
because economic
and
national
interests
were
almost
iden-
tical
here
and
because economic
and
social
status depended
largely on
nationality; nationalism,
therefore, which had been
a
unifying force
in the
nation-states, here became
at once a principle of internal disruption, which
resulted
in
a
decisive
ditTerence
in
the
structure
of
the
parties
as com-
pared with those of
nation-states. What held together the members of the
parties
in
multinational
Austria-Hungary
was
not
a
particular
interest,
as
in
the
other
Continental
party
systems,
or
a
particular
principle
for
organized
action
as
in
the Anglo-Saxon,
but
chiefly
the
sentiment
of be-
longing
to
the same
nationality.
Strictly
speaking,
this
should have
been
and was a great weakness
in the Austrian parties, because no definite goals
or
programs
could
be
deduced
from
the
sentiment
of
tribal
belonging.
The pan-movements made
a
virtue
of
this
shortcoming by
transforming
parties into movements and by discovering that form of organization which,
in
contrast
to
all
others, would never need
a
goal
or program but could
change
its
policy from day
to day without harm
to
its membership. Long
before Nazism
proudly pronounced
that
though
it had
a program
it
did
not need
one. Pan-Germanism discovered how much more important
for
mass appeal
a
general mood was than laid-down
outlines and
platforms.
For
the only
thing
that
counts
in
a movement
is
precisely
that
it keeps
itself
in constant movement."" The
Nazis,
therefore, used
to
refer
to
the
fourteen
years
of
the Weimar
Republic
as
the
"time
of
the
System"
Sysicmzcii—the
implication being
that
this time was
sterile, lacked dyna-
mism, did not "move." and was followed by their "era of the movement."
The
state, even as a one-party dictatorship, was
felt to be in the way of
the ever-changing needs of an ever-growing movement. There was no more
characteristic
difference
between
the
imperialist
"above
party
group"
of
the Pan-German League in Germany
itself and the Pan-German movement
in Austria than
their attitudes toward the
state: ^°" while the "party above

to seize the
state machine, the true movement aimed
at
its
destruction;
while
the
former
still
recognized
the
state
as
highest
authority once
its representation had fallen
into the hands of the members
of one party
(as
in Mussolini's
Italy), the
latter recognized the movement
as independent of and superior
in authority
to the state.

from the outside,
the older
parties showed
clearly
that they too were no
longer
able
to
function
as
representatives
of
specific
class
interests
but
had become mere defenders of the
status quo. The speed with which the
German and Austrian Pan-Germans
rallied
to Nazism
has
a
parallel
in
the much
slower and more
complicated
course through which Pan-Slavs
finally found out
that
the
liquidation of Lenin's Russian Revolution had
been
thorough
enough
to make
it
possible
for them
to
support
Stalin
wholeheartedly. That Bolshevism and Nazism
at the height of their power
outgrew mere
tribal
nationalism
and had
little
use
for
those who were
still
actually convinced of
it
in principle,
rather than
as mere propaganda
material, was neither the Pan-Germans' nor the Pan-Slavs' fault and hardly
checked their enthusiasm.
The decay of the Continental party system went hand
in hand with

it
all the more obvious that the nation-state was no longer capable
of facing the major political
issues of the
time.^**- Even more
serious was
the
ill-fated effort of the peace treaties of 1919 to introduce national
state
organizations
into
Eastern and Southern Europe where
the
state
people
frequently
had
only
a
relative
majority
and
were
outnumbered
by
the
combined
"minorities." This new
situation would have been
sufficient
in
itself
to undermine
seriously
the
class
basis
of
the
party

were now
organized
along
national
lines

though
the
liquidation
of

served
only
to
enable
a
host
of
similar experiments to start on a dwarfed scale. ^"^ In other countries, where
the
nation-state and the
class basis of
its parties were not touched by mi-

a similar breakdown; and
it

system,
the
more
class-conscious
its
people
had
been,
the
more
dramatic and dangerous was
this breakdown.
This was the situation between the two wars when evejy movement had
a greater chance than any ^irty because the movement attacked the
instiTtl^
TiOfl ol the stale and did not
apf>eal to classes. Fascism and Nazism always
boasted
that
their
hatred was
directed
not
against
individual
classes,
but
the class system as such, which they denounced as an invention of Marxism.
Even more significant was the fact that the Communists also, notwithstand-
ing their Marxist ideology, had to abandon the rigidity of their class appeal
when,
after
1935,
under
the
pretext
of
enlarging
their
mass
base,
they
formed Popular Fronts everywhere and began to appeal to the same grow-
mg masses outside
all
class strata which up
to then had been the
natural
prey to Fascist movements. Jsirtna
f^f th^
r,\(\ p prt^es^was prppare<i-to
rece i vfe—
these masses, nor did they gauge correctly the growing importance of their
8umTvrs~Trnd the growing
political influence of their leaders. This error in
judgment by the older parties can be explained by the fact that their secure
position
in Parliament and safe representation
in the offices and institutions
of the
state made them
feel much closer to the sources of power than to
the
masses;
they
thought
the
state would remain
forever
the
undisputed
master of
all instruments of violence, and that the army, that supreme insti-
tution of the nation-state, would remain the decisive element in
all domestic
crises. They therefore
felt free to ridicule the numerous paramilitary forma-
tions which had sprung up without any
officially recognized
help. For the
weaker
the
party
system grew under
the
pressure
of movements
outside
of
Parliament and
classes,
the more
rapidly
all former antagonism
of the
parties
to
the
state
disappeared. The
parties,
laboring under
the
illusion
of
a
"state
above
parties,"
misinterpreted
this harmony
as
a
source
of
strength, as a wondrous relationship to something of a higher order. But the
state was as threatened as the party system by the pressure of revolutionary
movements, and
it could no longer afford to keep
its
lofty and necessarily
unpopular position above internal domestic
strife. The army had long since
ceased
to be
a
reliable bulwark
against
revolutionary
unrest,
not because
it was
in sympathy with the revolution but because
it had lost
its position.
Twice in modern times, and both times in France, the nation par excellence,
the army
had
already proved
its
essential
unwillingness
or
incapacity
to
help those
in power or to seize power by
itself:
in 1850, when
it permitted
the mob of the "Society of December 10" to carry Napoleon III to power,i"^
and again
at the end of the nineteenth century, during the Dreyfus
Affair,
when nothing would have been easier than the establishment of
a military
dictatorship.
The,jiciilj:alit^^f
the
army,
its
willingness
to
serve
every
master,
eventually
left thTltSTe m
a
position
of "mediation between
the
organized

interests.
It was no longer above but between the
classes
of society." "'•

the
status quo without reaHzing that
this very
alliance served
as much
as
anything else to change the status quo.
The breakdown of the European party system occurred
in a spectacular
wa'y
with
Hitler's
rise
to
power.
It
is now
otten
conveniently
forgotten
that at the moment of the outbreak of the second World War, the majority
of European countries had already adopted some form of dictatorship and
discarded the party system, and
that
this revolutionary change
in govern-
ment had been effected
in most countries without revolutionary upheaval.
Revolutionary
action more often than
not was
a
theatrical concession
to
the desires of violently discontented masses rather than an actual battle for
power. After
all,
it did not make much difference
if a few thousand almost
unarmed people staged a march on Rome and took over the government
in
Italy,
or whether
in Poland
(in
1934)
a
so-called
"partyless
bloc,"
with a program of support for a semifascist government and a membership
drawn from the nobility and the poorest peasantry, workers and business-
men, Catholics and orthodox Jews,
legally won two-thirds of the
seats
in
Parliament.'*"'
In France,
Hitler's
rise
to power, accompanied by
a growth
of Com-
munism and Fascism, quickly cancelled the other parties' original relation-
ships
to each other and changed time-honored party
lines
overnight. The
French
Right, up
to then
strongly anti-German and pro-war,
after
1933
became
the vanguard
of pacifism and understanding with Germany. The
Left switched with equal speed from pacifism
at any price to a firm stand
against Germany and was soon accused of being
a party
of warmongers
by
the same
parties which
only
a few
years
before
had
denounced
its
pacifism
as
national treachery.
^'^'^ The years
that followed
Hitler's
rise
to
power proved even more
disastrous
to
the
integrity
of
the French
party
system. In the Munich crisis each party, from Right to Left,
split internally
on the only relevant political issue: who was for, who was against war with
Germany.*"^ Each party harbored a peace faction and a war faction; none
of them could remain united on major
political decisions and none stood
the
test of Fascism and Nazism without
splitting
into
anti-Fascist on one
side, Nazi
fellow-travelers on
the
other. That
Hitler could
choose
freely
from
all parties for the erection of puppet regimes was the consequence of
this
pre-war
situation,
and
not
of an
especially
shrewd
Nazi
maneuver.
There was not a single party in Europe that did not produce collaborators.
Against the disintegration of the older parties stood the
clear-cut unity
of the Fascist and Communist movements everywhere—the former, outside
of Germany and Italy, loyally advocating peace even at the price of foreign
domination, and the latter for a long while preaching war even at the price

of national ruin. The point, however,
is not so much that the extreme Right
even.Av here had abandoned
its
traditional
nationalism
in favor of
Hitler's
Kuropc and
that the extreme
Left had forgotten
its
traditional pacifism
in
favor
of
old
nationalist
slogans,
but
rather
that
both
movements
could
count on the
loyalty of a membership and leadership which would not be
disturbed by
a sudden switch
in
policy. This was dramatically exposed
in
the Cierman-Russian nonaggression pact, when the Nazis had to drop their
chief slogan
against
Bolshevism
and
the Communists had
to
return
to
a
pacifism which they always had denounced as petty-bourgeois. Such sudden
turns did not hurt them
in the
least.
It
is
still well remembered how strong
the Communists remained
after their second volte-face
less than two years
later when
the
Soviet Union was attacked by Nazi Germany, and
this
in
spite of the
fact
that both
political
lines had involved the rank and
file
in
serious
and
dangerous
political
activities which demanded
real
sacrifices
and constant action.
Different
in appearance but much more violent in reality was the break-
down of the party system
in pre-Hitler Germany. This came into the open
during the
last
presidential
elections
in 1932 when entirely new and com-
plicated forms of mass propaganda were adopted by
all
parties.
The choice
of candidates was
itself
peculiar. While
it was
a matter of
.ourse
that
the
two movements,
which
stood
outside
of and
fought
the
parliamentary system from opposite
sides, would present their own candi-
dates
(Hitler
for the
Nazis, and Thiilmann
for the Communists),
it was
rather
surprising
to
see
that
all
other
parties
could suddenly
agree upon
one
candidate. That
this candidate happened
to be
old Hindenburg who
enjoyed
the
matchless
popularity
which,
since
the
time
of MacMahon,
awaits the defeated general
at home, was not
just
a joke;
it showed how
much
the
old
parties wanted merely
to
identify
themselves
with
the
old-
time
state, the state above the parties whose most potent symbol had been
the national army, to what an extent, in other words, they had already given
up the party system
itself. For in the face of the movements, the differences
between the parties had indeed become quite meaningless; the existence of
all of them was
at stake and consequently they banded together and hoped
to maintain a status quo that guaranteed their existence. Hindenbur:g..became
t{?e symbol oM he nation-state and the party system, while Hitler and^al-
_IIiann_£omnctccl with each
ot.^er to becomEIiriir Imih ^^ymhnlj^ tT^7~j^;^P
As significant as the choice of candidates were the electoraT^osterSTi^one
of them
praised
its candidate
for
his own
merits;
the posters for Hinden-
burg claimed merely
that "a
vote
for Thiilmann
is
a
vote
for Hitler"—
warning
the workers
not
to waste
their
votes on
a candidate
sure
to be
beaten
(Thiilmann)
and thus put
Hitler
in the saddle. This was how the
Social Democrats reconciled themselves to Hindenburg., who was not even
mentioned. The parties of the Right played the same game and emphasized
that "a vote for Hitler
is
a vote for Thalmann." Both,
in addition, alluded
quite clearly to the instances in which the Nazis and Communists had made
common
cause,
in
order
to
convince
aU
loyal
party
members,
whether

CONTINENTAL IMPERIALISM: THE PAN-MOVEMENTS

Right or Left, that the preservation of the status quo demanded Hindenburg.
In contrast
to
the propaganda
for Hindenburg
that
appealed
to
those
who wanted the status quo at any price—and in 1932 that meant unemploy-
ment for almost half the German people—the candidates of the movements
had to reckon with those who wanted change at any price (even at the price
of destruction of all legal institutions), and these were
at least as numerous
as the ever-growing millions of unemployed and their families. The Nazis
therefore did not wince
at the
absurdity
that "a vote
for Thalmann
is
a
vote
for Hindenburg,"
the Communists
did not
hesitate
to
reply
that "a
vote
for
Hitler
is
a
vote
for Hindenburg," both
threatening
their
voters
with the menace of the status quo in exactly the same way their opponents
had threatened their members with the specter of the revolution.
Behind the curious uniformity of method used by the supporters of all the
candidates lay the tacit assumption that the electorate would go to the polls
because
it was frightened—afraid of the Communists,
afraid of the Nazis,
or afraid of the status quo. In this general fear all class divisions disappeared
from the political scene; while the party alliance for the defense of the status
quo
blurred
the
older
class
structure maintained
in
the
separate
parties,
the rank and
file of the movements was completely heterogeneous and
as
dynamic and fluctuating as unemployment
itself. ^^•* While within the frame-
work
of
the
national
institutions
the
parliamentary
Left had
joined
the
parliamentary Right, the two movements were busy organizing together the
famous transportation
strike on the
streets of Berlin in November,
1932.
When one considers the extraordinarily rapid decline of the Continental
party system, one should bear in mind the very short life span of the whole
institution.
It existed nowhere before the nineteenth century, and
in most
European countries the formation of political parties took place only
after
1848,
so
that
its
reign
as an unchallenged
institution
in
national
politics
lasted hardly four decades. During the
last two decades of the nineteenth
century,
all the
significant
political developments
in France,
as
well
as
in
Austria-Hungary, already took place outside of and in opposition to parlia-
mentary parties, while everywhere smaller imperialist "parties above parties"
challenged the institution for the sake of popular support for an aggressive,
expansionist foreign policy.
While the
imperialist leagues
set themselves above
parties for the sake
of
identification with
the
nation-state,
the pan-movements
attacked
these
same
parties
as part and parcel
of
a general system which
included
the
nation-state; they were not so much "above parties"
as "above the
state"
for
the
sake
of
a
direct
identification
with
the
people.
The
totalitarian
'°® The German
socialist
party underwent
a
typical change from
the beginning of
the century to
1933. Prior to the
first World War only
10 per cent of
its members did
not belong to the working class whereas about 25 per cent of
its votes came from the
middle
classes.
In
1930, however, only 60 per cent of
its members were workers and
at
least 40 per cent of
its votes were middle-class
votes. See Sigmund Neumann,

Nothing proves better the irreparable decay of the party system than the
great efforts after this war to revive
it on the Continent, their pitiful results,
the enhanced
appeal
of movements
after
the
defeat
of Nazism,
and
the
obvious
threat
of Bolshevism
to
national
independence. The
result
of
all
efforts to restore the status quo has been only the restoration of a political
situation
in which
the
destructive movements
are
the
only
"parties"
that
function
properly.
Their
leadership
has
maintained
authority
under
the
most
trying circumstances and
in
spite of constantly changing party
lines.
In order to gauge correctly the chances for survival of the European nation-
state,
it would be wise not to pay too much attention to nationalist slogans
which
the
movements
occasionally
adopt
for
purposes
of
hiding
their
true
intentions,
but
rather
to consider that by now everybody knows
that
they
are
regional
branches
of
international
organizations,
that
the
rank
and
file
is
not
disturbed
in
the
least when
it becomes obvious
that
their
policy
serves
foreign-policy
interests
of
another and even
hostile
power,
and
that denunciations
of
their leaders
as
fifth columnists,
traitors
to
the
country,
etc., do not impress their members to any considerable degree. In
contrast to the old
parties, the movements have survived the
last war and
are
today
the
only
"parties" which have remained
alive and meaningful
to their adherents.

CHAPTER nine:
Thc Decliiie of the Nation-
State and the End of the Rights of Man
IT
IS ALMOST impossible even now to describe what
actually happened
in Europe on August 4,
1914. The days before and the days after the
first World War are separated not like the end of an old and the beginning
of a new period, but like the day before and the day after an explosion. Yet
this figure of speech
is as inaccurate as are
all others, because the quiet of
sorrow which settles down after a catastrophe has never come to pass. The
first explosion seems to have touched off a chain reaction in which we have
been caught ever since and which nobody seems
to be
able
to
stop. The
first World War exploded the European comity of nations beyond
repair,
something which no other war had ever done. Inflation destroyed the whole
class of small property owners beyond hope for recovery or new formation,
something which no monetary
crisis had
ever done
so
radically
before.
Unemployment, when
it came, reached fabulous proportions, was no longer
restricted to the working class but seized with insignificant exceptions whole
nations.
Civil wars which ushered in and spread over the twenty years of
uneasy peace were not only bloodier and more
cruel than
all their prede-
cessors;
they
were
followed
by
migrations
of
groups
who,
unlike
their
happier predecessors
in
the
religious
wars, were welcomed nowhere
and
could
be
assimilated
nowhere. Once
they had
left
their homeland
they
remained homeless, once
they had
left
their
state
they became
stateless;
once they had been deprived of their human rights they were
rightless, the
scum of the earth. Nothing which was being done, no matter how stupid,
no matter how many people knew and foretold the consequences, could be
undone or prevented. Every event had
the
finality
of a
last judgment,
a
judgment
that was passed
neither by God nor by
the
devil,
but
looked
rather like the expression of some unredeemably stupid
fatality.
Before
totalitarian
politics consciously
attacked and
partially destroyed
the very structure of European
civilization, the explosion of 1914 and
its
severe consequences of
instability had
sufficiently shattered
the facade
of
Europe's political system to lay bare its hidden frame. Such visible exposures
were the sufferings of more and more groups of people to whom suddenly
the rules of the world around them had ceased
to apply.
It was precisely
the seeming stability of the surrounding world that made each group forced
out
of
its
protective
boundaries
look
like
an
unfortunate
exception
to

>^,V
IMPERIALISM
.in Otherwise sane and normal
rule, and which
filled with equal cynicism
victims and
observers
of an
apparently
unjust
and
abnormal
fate.
Both
rnisiixik
this cynicism for growing wisdom
in the ways of the world, while
.ictuaily
they
were more
baffled
and
therefore became more
stupid
than
they
ever had
been
before.
Hatred,
certainly
not
lacking
in
the
pre-war
world, began to play a central role
in public affairs everywhere, so that the
[x>litical scene
in
the
deceptively
quiet years
of the twenties assumed
the
sordid
and
weird
atmosphere
of
a
Strindbergian
family
quarrel.
Nothing
perhaps
illustrates
the
general
disintegration
of
political
life
better
than
this vague, pervasive hatred of everybody and everything, without a focus
for
its passionate
attention, with nobody to make
responsible
for the
state
of
affairs—neither
the
government
nor
the
bourgeoisie
nor
an
outside
power.
It consequently
turned
in
all
directions,
haphazardly
and
unpre-
dictably,
incapable
of
assuming
an
air
of
healthy
indifference
toward
anything under the sun.
This atmosphere of disintegration, though characteristic of the whole of
F-urope between the two wars, was more visible in the defeated than in the
victorious countries, and
it developed
fully
in the
states newly established
after the
liquidation
of the Dual Monarchy and
the
Czarist Empire. The
last
remnants
of
solidarity
between
the
nonemancipated
nationalities
in
the
"belt
of mixed
populations" evaporated
with
the
disappearance
of
a
central despotic bureaucracy which had also served to gather together and
divert from each other the
diffuse hatreds and conflicting national claims.
Now everybody was
against everybody
else, and most
of
all
against
his
closest neighbors—the Slovaks
against the Czechs,
the Croats
against the
Serbs, the Ukrainians against the Poles. And this was not the result of the
conflict
between
nationalities
and
the
state
peoples
(or
minorities
and
majorities);
the
Slovaks
not
only
constantly
sabotaged
the
democratic
Czech government
in
Prague, but
at
the same time persecuted
the Hun-
garian minority on their own
soil, while a similar hostility against the state
people on one
hand, and among themselves on the
other,
existed among
the dissatisfied minorities in Poland.
At
first glance
these
troubles
in
the old European trouble
spot looked
like
petty
nationalist
quarrels
without
any
consequence
for
the
political
destinies of Europe. Yet
in these regions and out of the liquidation of the
two multinational
states of pre-war Europe, Russia and Austria-Hungary,
two victim groups emerged whose
sufferings were
different from those
of
all others in the era between the wars; they were worse off than the dispos-
sessed
middle
classes,
the unemployed,
the
small
rentiers,
the pensioners
whom
events had
deprived
of
social
status,
the
possibility
to work,
and
the
right
to
hold
property:
they had
lost
those
rights
which had
been
thought of and even defined as inalienable, namely the Rights of Man. The

governments
to represent and
to
protect them and
therefore were forced
to Hve either under the law of exception of the Minority
Treaties, which
all
governments
(except
Czechoslovakia)
had
signed
under
protest
and
never recognized
as law, or under conditions of absolute lawlessness.
With
the emergence
of the
minorities
in Eastern and Southern Europe
and with
the
stateless people driven
into Central and Western Europe,
a
completely new
element
of
disintegration
was
introduced
into
postwar
Europe. Denationalization became a powerful weapon of totalitarian politics,
and the constitutional inability of European nation-states to guarantee human
rights to those who had
lost nationally guaranteed
rights, made
it possible
for the persecuting governments
to impose
their standard of values even
upon
their
opponents.
Those whom
the
persecutor had
singled
out
as
scum of the earth—Jews, Trotskyites, etc.—actually were received as scum
of the earth everywhere;
those whom
persecution had
called
undesirable
became the indesirables of Europe. The official SS newspaper, the Schwarze
Korps,
stated
explicitly
in
1938
that
if the world was
not
yet convinced
that the Jews were the scum of the earth,
it soon would be when unidenti-
fiable
beggars, without nationality, without money, and without passports
crossed their frontiers.- And
it
is true that this kind of factual propaganda
worked better than Goebbels'
rhetoric, not only because
it established the
Jews
as scum
of
the
earth,
but
also because
the
incredible
plight
of an
ever-growing group of innocent people was
like
a practical demonstration
of the totalitarian movements' cynical claims that no such thing as inalien-
able human
rights existed and that the
affirmations of the democracies
to
the contrary were mere prejudice, hypocrisy, and cowardice
in the face of
the cruel majesty of a new world. The very phrase "human rights" became
for

dcrniined
the
stability
of
Europe's
nation-state
system from
the
outside.
None of these factors, however, had sprung directly from the tradition and
the
institutions
of
nation-states
themselves.
Their
internal
disintegration
began only
after
the
first World War,
with
the appearance
of
minorities
created by the Peace Treaties and of
a constantly growing refugee move-
ment,
the
consequence
of
revolutions.
The inadequacy of the Peace Treaties has often been explained by the
fact
that
the peacemakers belonged to a generation formed by experiences
in
the pre-war era. so that they never quite realized the
full impact of the
war whose peace they had to conclude. There
is no better proof of this than
their attempt
to
regulate the
nationality problem
in Eastern and Southern
Europe through
the establishment of nation-states and the introduction of
minority
treaties.
If the wisdom of the extension of a form of government
which even
in countries with old and
settled
national
tradition could
not
handle the new problems of world politics had become questionable,
it was
even more doubtful whether
it could be imported into an area which lacked
the very conditions for the
rise of nation-states: homogeneity of population
and rootedness in the
soil. But to assume that nation-states could be estab-
lished
by
the
methods
of
the
Peace
Treaties
was
simply
preposterous.
Indeed: "One glance
at the demographic map of Europe should be
suffi-
cient
to show
that
the
nation-state
principle
cannot
be
introduced
into
Eastern Europe."^ The
Treaties lumped
together many
peoples
in
single
states,
called some
of them
"state
people" and
entrusted them
with
the
government,
silently assumed that others
(such
as the Slovaks in Czecho-
slovakia,
or the Croats and Slovenes
in Yugoslavia)
were equal partners
in
the government, which
of course they were not/ and with equal
arbi-
trariness created out
of the remnant
a
third group
of
nationalities
called
"minorities,"
thereby
adding
to
the many burdens
of
the new
states
the
trouble
of observing
special
regulations
for
part
of
the
population.^ The
result was that those peoples to whom states were not conceded, no matter
whether they were
official
minorities or only
nationalities,
considered
the
Treaties an
arbitrary game which handed out
rule
to some and
servitude
to others. The newly created
states, on the other hand, which were prom-
ised equal status in national sovereignty with the Western nations, regarded
the
Minority
Treaties
as
an open breach
of promise
and
discrimination

because only new
states, and not even defeated Germany, were bound
to
them.
The perplexing power vacuum resulting from the dissolution of the Dual
Monarchy and the liberation of Poland and the Baltic countries from Czar-
ist despotism was not the only factor that had tempted the statesmen
into
this disastrous experiment. Much stronger was the impossibility of arguing
away
any
longer
the more
than
100
million Europeans who had
never
reached the stage of national freedom and self-determination
to which co-
lonial peoples already aspired and which was being held out to them.
It was
indeed true that the role of the Western and Central European proletariat,
the oppressed history-suffering group whose emancipation was
a matter of
life and death for the whole European social system, was played in the East
by "peoples without a history."*' The national liberation movements of the
East were revolutionary in much the same way as the workers' movements
in the West; both represented the "unhistorical" strata of Europe's popula-
tion and both strove to secure recognition and participation in public affairs.
Since the object was to conserve the European status quo, the granting of
national self-determination and sovereignty to
all European peoples seemed
indeed inevitable; the
alternative would have been to condemn them ruth-
lessly to the status of colonial peoples (something the pan-movements had
always proposed) and to introduce colonial methods into European affairs.
'^
The point, of course,
is that the European status quo could not be pre-
served and
that
it became
clear only
after the downfall of the
last rem-
nants of European autocracy that Europe had been ruled by a system which
had never taken into account or responded to the needs of at
least 25 per
cent of her population. This
evil, however, was not cured with the estab-
lishment of the succession states, because about 30 per cent of their roughly
100
million
inhabitants were
officially recognized
as
exceptions who had
to be specially protected by minority treaties. This figure, moreover, by no

Historical consciousness played
a great
role in the formation of national conscious-
ness. The emancipation of nations from dynastic rule and the overlordship of an inter-
national aristocracy was accompanied by
the emancipation of
literature from the
"in-
ternational"
language
of
the
learned
(Latin
first and
later
French)
and
the growth
of
national
languages
out
of
the popular
vernacular.
It seemed
that
peoples whose
language was
fit
for
literature had
reached
national
maturity
per
definitionem. The
liberation
movements
of
Eastern
European
nationalities,
therefore,
started
with
a
kind
of
philological
revival
(the
results
were
sometimes
grotesque
and
sometimes
very
fruitful) whose
political function
it was
to prove
that the people who possessed
a literature and a history of their own, had the right to national sovereignty.
^ Of course
this was not always a clear-cut ahernative. So far nobody has bothered
to
find out
the
characteristic
similarities between
colonial and
minority
exploitation.
Only
Jacob
Robinson,
"Staatsbiirgerliche und

in
passing: "A
peculiar
economic protectionism appeared,
not directed against othc;
countries but against
cer-
tain groups
of
the
population.
Surprisingly,
certain methods
of
colonial
exploitation
could be observed in Central Europe."

IMPERIALISM
means
tells the whole story;
it only indicates the difference between peoples
with a government of their own and those who supposedly were too small
and
tiK) scattered
to reach
full nationhood. The Minority Treaties covered
only
those
nationalities
of whom
there
were
considerable numbers
in
at
least two of the
succession
states,
but omitted from consideration
all
the
other
nationalities
without
a government
of
their own,
so
that
in some
of the succession states the nationally frustrated peoples constituted 50 per
cent
of
the
total
population.^ The
worst
factor
in
this
situation was
not
even
that
it became
a matter of course for the
nationalities
to be disloyal
to
their
imposed
government
and
for
the
governments
to
oppress
their
nationalities
as
etViciently
as
possible,
but
that
the
nationally
frustrated
population was
firmly convinced—as was everybody
else—that
true
free-
dom,
true
emancipation,
and
true
popular
sovereignty
could be
attained
only with
full national emancipation, that people without their own national
government were deprived of human
rights. In this conviction, which could
base
itself on the fact that the French Revolution had combined the decla-
ration of the Rights of Man with national sovereignty, they were supported
by the Minority Treaties themselves, which did not entrust the governments
with
the
protection
of
different
nationalities
but
charged
the
League
of
Nations
with
the safeguarding
of
the
rights
of those who,
for reasons
of
territorial
settlement,
had been
left
without
national
states
of
their own.
Not
that
the
minorities would
trust
the League
of Nations
any more
than
they had
trusted the
state
peoples. The League,
after
all, was com-
posed of
national statesmen whose sympathies could
not but be with
the
unhappy new governments which were hampered and opposed on principle
by between 25 and 50 per cent of their inhabitants. Therefore the creators
of the Minority Treaties were soon forced to interpret their real intentions
more
strictly and to point out the "duties" the minorities owed to the new
stales;"
it now developed that the Treaties had been conceived merely as a
painless
and
humane
method
of
assimilation,
an
interpretation
which
naturally enraged
the
minorities.^" But
nothing
else could have been ex-

It has been estimated that prior to 1914 there were about 100 million people whose
national
aspirations had
not
been
fulfilled.

pected within a system of sovereign nation-states;
if the Minority Treaties
had been intended to be more than a temporary remedy for
a topsy-turvy
situation, then their impHed restriction on national sovereignty would have
affected the national sovereignty of the older European powers. The repre-
sentatives of the
great nations knew only
too
well
that
minorities
within
nation-states must sooner or
later be either assimilated or hquidated. And
it did not matter whether they were moved by humanitarian considerations
to protect splinter nationalities from persecution, or whether
political con-
siderations
led them
to
oppose
bilateral
treaties
between
the
concerned
states and the majority countries of the minorities
(after
all, the Germans
were the strongest of
all the
officially recognized minorities, both in num-
bers and economic position); they were neither willing nor able to overthrow
the laws by which nation-states exist. *^
Neither
the League
of Nations nor
the
Minority
Treaties would have
prevented the newly established states from more or less forcefully assimi-
lating
their
minorities. The
strongest
factor
against
assimilation was
the
numerical and cultural weakness of the so-called state peoples. The Russian
or the Jewish minority in Poland did not feel Polish culture to be superior
to
its own and neither was
particularly impressed by
the
fact
that Poles
formed roughly 60 per cent of Poland's population.
The embittered nationalities, completely disregarding the League of Na-
tions, soon decided to take matters into their own hands. They banded to-
gether
in
a
minority
congress which was
remarkable
in more
than one
respect.
It contradicted the very idea behind the League
treaties by calling
itself
officially the "Congress
of Organized National Groups
in European
States," thereby nullifying the great labor spent during the peace negotiations
to
avoid
the ominous word
"national."^-
This had
the
important
conse-
quence
that
all
"nationalities," and not
just
"minorities," would
join and
that
the number of the
"nation of minorities" grew
so
considerably
that
even claimed
that
"the
object of
the
Minority Treaties
[is] ...
to secure
.
.
.
that
measure of protection and
justice which would gradually prepare them to be merged
in the national community to which they belonged" (C. A. Macartney, National States
and National Minorities, London,
1934, pp. 276, 277).
"
It
is true that some Czech statesmen, the most liberal and democratic of the lead-
ers of national movements, once dreamed of making the Czechoslovak republic a kind
of Switzerland. The reason why even Benes never serious attempted
to effectuate such
a solution to his harassing nationality problems was that Switzerland was not a model
that could
be
imitated,
but
rather
a
particularly
fortunate
exception
that proved an
otherwise established
rule. The newly established
states did not
feel secure enough to
abandon a centralized state apparatus and could not create overnight those small
self-
administrative bodies of communes and cantons upon whose very extensive powers the
Swiss system of federation
is based.
'^Wilson
notably, who had been
a
fervent advocate of granting
"racial,
religious,
and linguistic rights to the minorities," "feared that 'national
rights' would prove harm-
ful inasmuch
as minority groups thus marked
as separate corporate bodies would be
rendered thereby
'liable
to jealousy and
attack'"
(Oscar
J. Janowsky, The Jews and
Minority
Rights, New
York,
1933,

IMPERIALISM
the combined
nationalities
in
the
succession
states outnumbered
the
state
peoples. But
in
still another way the "Congress of National Groups" dealt
a decisive blow
to the League
treaties. One of the most
baffling aspects of
the
Eastern European
nationality problem
(more
baffling than
the
small
size and great number of peoples involved, or the
"belt of mixed popula-
tions"'*) was the interregional character of the nationalities which,
in case
they put their national
interests above the
interests of their respective gov-
ernments, made them an obvious
risk
to the
security of
their countries."
The League
treaties had attempted to ignore the interregional character of
the minorities by concluding a separate treaty with each country, as though
there were no Jewish or German minority beyond
the borders
of
the
re-
spective
states. The "Congress
of National Groups"
not only
sidestepped
the
territorial
principle
of the
League;
it was
naturally dominated by
the
two
nationalities which were represented
in
all succession states and were
therefore
in
a
position,
if they wished,
to make
their weight
felt
all over
Eastern and Southern
Europe. These two groups were
the Germans and
the Jews. The German minorities
in Rumania and Czechoslovakia voted of
course
with
the German
minorities
in Poland and Hungary,
and nobody
could have expected the Polish Jews, for instance,
to remain
indiflferent to
discriminatory
practices
of
the
Rumanian
government.
In
other
words,
national
interests and not common
interests
of minorities
as such formed
the
true
basis of membership
in the Congress,
'•"' and only the harmonious
relationship between the Jews and the Germans (the Weimar Republic had
successfully played the
role of special protector of minorities)
kept
it
to-
gether. Therefore,
in 1933 when the Jewish delegation demanded a protest
against the treatment of Jews in the Third Reich
(a move which they had
no right to make, strictly speaking, because German Jews were no minority)
and
the Germans announced
their solidarity with Germany and were sup-
ported by
a majority
(antisemitism was
ripe
in
all succession
states), the
Congress,
after
the Jewish delegation had
left forever, sank into complete
insignificance.
The
real
significance of the Minority Treaties
lies not in their practical
application
but
in
the
fact
that they were guaranteed by an
international
body,
the
League
of
Nations.

minority as a permanent
institution, the recognition that milHons of people
lived outside normal legal protection and needed an additional guarantee of
their elementary rights from an outside body, and the assumption that
this
state of affairs was not temporary but that the Treaties were needed in order
to establish a lasting modus vivendi—all
this was something new, certainly
on such a
scale,
in European history. The Minority Treaties said
in plain
language what
until then had been only implied
in the working system of
nation-states, namely, that only nationals could be citizens, only people of
the same national origin could enjoy the full protection of legal institutions,
that
persons
of
different
nationality
needed some
law
of exception
until
or unless they were completely assimilated and divorced from
their origin.
The
interpretative speeches on the League
treaties by statesmen of coun-
tries
without
minority
obligations
spoke
an even
plainer
language:
they
took
it for granted that the law of a country could not be
responsible for
persons
insisting on a different
nationality.^^ They thereby admitted—^and
were quickly given the opportunity to prove
it practically with the
rise of
stateless people—that the transformation
of the
state from an instrument
of the law into an instrument of the nation had been completed; the nation
had conquered
the
state,
national
interest had
priority over law long be-
fore Hitler could pronounce "right
is what
is good for the German people."
Here again the language of the mob was only the language of public opinion
cleansed of hypocrisy and restraint.
Certainly the danger of this development had been inherent in the struc-
ture of the nation-state since the beginning. But insofar as the establishment
of nation-states coincided with the establishment
of constitutional govern-
ment, they always had represented and been based upon the rule of law as
against the rule of arbitrary administration and despotism. So that when the
precarious balance between nation and
state, between national interest and
legal institutions broke down, the disintegration of this form of government
and of organization
of peoples came
about
with
terrifying
swiftness.
Its
disintegration, curiously enough, started at precisely the moment when the
right to national self-determination was
recognized for
all of Europe and
when
its essential conviction, the supremacy of the will of the nation over
all legal and "abstract" institutions, was universally accepted.
accomplished the suppression of the principle cuius regio eius religio. The Congress of
Vienna in 1815 had already taken steps to secure certain rights to the Polish populations
in Russia, Prussia, and Austria,
rights that certainly were not merely "religious";
it
is,
however,
characteristic
that
all
later
treaties—the
protocol
guaranteeing
the
inde-
pendence of Greece
in
1830, the one guaranteeing the independence of Moldavia and
Wallachia
in
1856, and
the Congress
of
Berlin
in
1878 concerned
with Rumania
speak
of
"religious," and
not
"national"
minorities,
which
were
granted
"civil"
but
not
"political"
rights.
'^ De Melio Franco,
representative of
Brazil on the Council of the League of Na-
tions,
put
the problem
very
clearly:
"It seems
to me obvious
that
those who
con-
ceived this system of protection did not dream of creating within certain States a group
of inhabitants who would regard themselves as permanently foreign to the general or-
ganization of the country" (Macartney, op.
cit.,
p. 277).

27(t
IMPERIALISM
At
the
time
of
the
Minority
Treaties
it
could
be, and was,
argued
in
their favor, as
i( were as their excuse, that the older nations enjoyed consti-
tutions which
unplicitly or explicitly
(as
in the case of France, the nation
IHtr t-xcfllt-nir)
were founded upon
the
Rights of Man,
that even
if there
were other nationalities within
their borders they needed no additional law
for them, and
that
only
in
the
newly
established
succession
states was
a
temporary
enforcement
of human
rights
necessary
as
a compromise and
exception."* The arrival of the stateless people brought an end to this illusion.
The
minorities were only
half
stateless; de
jure they belonged
to some
ptilitical body even though they needed additional protection in the form of
special
treaties and
guarantees; some
secondary
rights,
such
as
speaking
one's own
language and
staying
in
one's own
cultural and
social
milieu,
were
in jeopardy
and
were
halfheartedly
protected by
an
outside
body;
but
other more elementary
rights,
such
as
the
right
to
residence and
to
work, were never touched. The framers
of the Minority
Treaties
did not
foresee
the
possibility of wholesale population transfers or the problem of
people who had become "undeportable" because there was no country on
earth
in which
they enjoyed
the
right
to
residence. The
minorities could
still be regarded
as an exceptional phenomenon,
peculiar to
certain
terri-
tories
that
deviated from
the norm.
This argument was
always
tempting
because
it
left
the system
itself untouched;
it has
in
a way
survived
the
second World War whose peacemakers, convinced
of the
impracticability
of minority
treaties, began to "repatriate" nationalities as much as possible
in an
ctTort
to unscramble "the belt of mixed populations."^^ And
this
at-
tempted large-scale repatriation was not the direct result of the catastrophic
experiences
following
in the wake of the Minority Treaties;
rather,
it was
hoped
that such
a step would
finally
solve
a problem which,
in
the
pre-
ceding
decades,
had
assumed
ever
larger
proportions
and
for which
an
internationally
recognized and
accepted procedure
simply
did not
exist
the problem of the stateless people.

has been statelessness, the newest mass phenomenon in contemporary
his-
tory, and the existence of an ever-growing new people comprised of stateless
persons, the most symptomatic group
in contemporary
politics.^" Their ex-
istence can hardly be blamed on one factor alone, but
if we consider the
different groups among
the
stateless
it appears
that
every
political
event
since
the end of the
first World War
inevitably added a new category
to
those who lived outside the pale of the law, while none of the categories, no
matter how the original constellation changed, could ever be renormalized.^^
Among
them, we
still
find
that
oldest group
of
stateless
people,
the
Heimatlosen produced by
the Peace
Treaties
of
1919,
the
dissolution
of
Austria-Hungary, and the establishment of the Baltic states. Sometimes their
real origin could not be determined, especially
if at the end of the war they
happened not to reside in the city of their birth, 2- sometimes their place of
^° "The problem of statelessness became prominent after the Great War. Before the
war,
provisions
existed
in some
countries,
notably
in
the United
States, under which
naturalization could be revoked
in those cases
in which
the naturalized person ceased
to maintain
a genuine attachment
to
his adopted country. A person so denaturalized
became
stateless. During the war,
the principal European States found
it necessary to
amend
their
laws of
nationality
so
as
to take power
to cancel
naturalization"
(John
Hope Simpson, The Refugee Problem,
Institute of International
Affairs, Oxford,
1939,
p. 231). The class of stateless persons created through revocation of naturalization was
very small; they established, however, an easy precedent so that,
in the interwar period,
naturalized
citizens were as a
rule the
first section of a population that became
state-
less. Mass cancellation of naturalizations, such as the one introduced by Nazi Germany
in
1933 against
all naturalized Germans of Jewish origin, usually preceded denationali-
zation of citizens by birth in similar categories, and the introduction of laws that made
denaturalization
possible through
simple
decree,
like
the ones
in
Belgium and
other
Western democracies
in
the
thirties,
usually preceded
actual mass denaturalization; a
good
instance
is the
practice of the Greek government with respect
to the Armenian
refugees: of 45,000 Armenian refugees
1,000 were naturalized between 1923 and 1928.
After
1928, a law which would have
naturalized
all refugees under twenty-two years
of age was suspended, and
in
1936,
all
naturalizations were canceled by the govern-
ment.
(See Simpson, op.
cit.,
p. 41.)
^' Twenty-five
years
after
the
Soviet regime had disowned one and a
half million
Russians,
it was estimated that
at
least 350,000
to 450,000 were
still
stateless—which
is a tremendous percentage
if one considers that a whole generation had passed since
the
initial
flight, that a considerable portion had gone overseas, and that another large
part had
acquired
citizenship
in
different
countries through
marriage.

It
is true that the United States has placed stateless immigrants on a footing of com-
plete
equality with other
foreigners, but
this has been possible only because
this,

immigration,
has
always

origin changed
hands
so many
times
in
the
turmoil
of postwar
disputes
that the nationality of
its inhabitants changed from year to year (as in Vilna
which a French
official once termed
la capitale des apatrides); more often
than one would imagine, people took
refuge
in
statelessness
after the
first
World War
in order to remain where they were and avoid being deported
to
a "homeland" where they would be
strangers
(as
in the case of many
Polish and Rumanian Jews
in France and Germany,
mercifully helped by
the
antiscmitic
attitude of their respective consulates).
Unimportant
in
himself,
apparently
just
a
legal
freak,
the
apatride
received
belated
attention
and
consideration when
he was
joined
in
his
legal status by the postwar refugees who had been forced out of their coun-
tries
by
revolutions, and were promptly
denationalized by
the
victorious
governments
at home. To
this group
belong,
in chronological
order,
mil-
lions of Russians, hundreds of thousands of Armenians, thousands of Hun-
garians, hundreds of thousands of Germans, and more than half a million
Spaniards—to enumerate only the more important categories. The behavior
of these governments may appear today to be the natural consequence of
civil war; but
at the time mass denationalizations were something entirely
new and unforeseen. They presupposed
a
state
structure which,
if
it was
not
yet
fully
totalitarian,
at
least would
not
tolerate
any
opposition
and
would rather lose
its citizens than harbor people with different views. They
revealed, moreover, what had been hidden throughout
the
history
of na-
tional
sovereignty,
that
sovereignties
of neighboring countries could come
into deadly conflict not only in the extreme case of war but in peace.
It now
became clear that
full national sovereignty was possible only as long as the
comity
of European
nations
existed;
for
it was
this
spirit
of unorganized
solidarity and
agreement
that prevented any government's
exercise
of
its
full
sovereign power.
Theoretically,
in the
sphere
of
international law,
it
had always been
true
that
sovereignty
is nowhere more
absolute than
in
matters
of
"emigration,
naturalization,
nationality,
and
expulsion"; ^3
the
point, however,
is
that
practical consideration and
the
silent acknowledg-
ment of common
interests
restrained national sovereignty
until the
rise of
totalitarian regimes. One
is almost tempted to measure the degree of totali-
tarian
infection
by
the
extent
to
which
the
concerned
governments
use
their sovereign right of denationalization (and
it would be quite interesting
then
to
discover
that
Mussolini's
Italy was
rather
reluctant
to
treat
its
refugees
this way^^). But one should bear in mind
at the same time
that
there was hardly a country
left on the Continent that did not pass between
the two wars some new legislation which, even

it did not use

extensively, was always phrased to allow for getting rid of a great number
of its inhabitants at any opportune moment.'^'''
No paradox of contemporary politics
is filled with a more poignant irony
than
the
discrepancy
between
the
efforts
of
well-meaning
idealists who
stubbornly
insist on regarding
as
"inalienable" those human
rights, which
are enjoyed only by citizens of the most prosperous and civilized countries,
and the situation of the rightless themselves. Their situation has deteriorated
just
as stubbornly,
until the internment camp—prior to the second World
War the exception rather than the
rule for the
stateless—has become
the
routine
solution
for
the problem
of domicile
of the
"displaced
persons."
Even the terminology applied to the stateless has deteriorated. The term
"stateless"
at
least acknowledged the
fact that these persons had
lost
the
protection of
their government and
required
international agreements
for
safeguarding their legal
status. The postwar term "displaced persons" was
invented during the war for
the express purpose
of
liquidating
stateless-
ness once and for
all by ignoring
its existence. Nonrecognition of stateless-
ness
always means
repatriation,
i.e.,
deportation
to
a
country
of
origin,
which
either
refuses
to
recognize
the
prospective
repatriate
as
a
citizen,
or, on the contrary, urgently wants him back for punishment.
Since non-
totalitarian countries, in spite of their bad intentions inspired by the climate
of war,
generally have
shied away from mass
repatriations,
the number
of stateless people—twelve years
after the end of the war—is larger than
ever. The decision of the statesmen
to
solve
the problem
of
statelessness
by ignoring
it
is further revealed by the lack of any
reliable
statistics on
the
subject.
This much
is known,
however:
while
there
are one
million
"recognized" stateless, there are more than ten million so-called "de facto"
stateless; and whereas
the
relatively innocuous problem
of
the
"de
jure"
stateless occasionally comes up at international conferences, the core of state-
lessness, which
is
identical with
the refugee
question,
is simply not men-
tioned.
Worse
still,
the number
of
potentially
stateless
people
is
con-
tinually on
the
increase.

Portugal went much
farther
in
a

of

reaffirmed
it
by
a new
decree
in
1934 which
in
the
characteristically vague manner
of the time spoke of persons "manquant gravement a
letirs devoirs de citoyen beige."
In
Italy,
since
1926,
all
persons
could
be
denaturalized who
were

of
Italian
citizenship" or a menace
to the
public
order. Egypt and Turkey
in
1926 and
1928
respectively
issued
laws according
to which people could be denaturalized who
were a threat to the
social
order. France threatened with denaturalization those of
its
new
citizens who committed
acts contrary
to the
interests of France
(1927).
Austria
in
1933 could deprive of Austrian
nationality any of her
citizens who served or par-
ticipated abroad

action
hostile
to
Austria. Germany,
finally,
in
1933

nationality decrees

by
stating that
all persons
"residing abroad" could at will be deprived of German nationality.

IMPERIALISM
regard lo those who were citizens by birth; now we have reached the point
where
even
free
democracies,
as,
for
instance,
the
United
States,
were
seriously
considering
depriving
native
Americans
who
are
Communists
of their citizenship. The
sinister aspect of these measures
is that they
are
being considered
in
all
innocence.
Yet, one need
only remember
the ex-
treme care of the Nazis, who insisted that all Jews of non-German nationality
"should be
deprived
of
their
citizenship
either prior
to,
or,
at
the
latest,
on
the day
of deportation"-^"
(for German Jews such
a decree was
not
needed, because
in the Third Reich there existed a law according to which
all Jews who had
left the territory—including, of course, those deported to
a
Polish camp—automatically
lost
their
citizenship)
in
order
to
realize
the true implications of statelessness.
The
first great damage done to the nation-states as a result of the arrival
of hundreds of thousands of stateless people was that the
right of asylum,
the only
right that had ever figured
as a symbol of the Rights of Man
in
the
sphere
of
international
relationships,
was
being
abolished.
Its
long
and sacred history dates back
to the very beginnings of regulated
political
life. Since ancient times
it has protected both the refugee and the land of
refuge
from
situations
in
which
people
were
forced
to become
outlaws
through circumstances beyond their control.
It was the only modern rem-
nant of the medieval principle that quid quid
est
in
territorio est de
terri-
loriu,
for
in
all other cases the modern state tended to protect
its
citizens
beyond
its own borders and to make sure, by means of reciprocal treaties,
that
they
remained
subject
to the laws
of
their country. But though
the
right
of asylum continued
to function
in
a world organized
into
nation-
states and.
in individual instances, even survived both World Wars,
it was
felt to be an anachronism and in conflict with the international rights of the
slate.
Therefore
it cannot be found
in written law,
in no
constitution or
international agreement, and the Covenant of the League of Nations never
even so much
as mentioned
it.^"
It
shares, in this respect, the
fate of the
Rights of Man, which also never became law but led a somewhat shadowy

existence
as an appeal
in
individual
exceptional cases
for which normal
legal institutions did not
suffice.^^
The second great shock
that the European world
suffered through
the
arrival of the refugees ^^ was the
realization
that
it was impossible
to
get
rid of them or transform them into nationals of the country of refuge. From
the beginning everybody had agreed that there were only two ways to solve
the problem: repatriation or naturalization.-^ When the example of the
first
Russian and Armenian waves proved that neither way gave any
tangible
results, the countries of refuge simply refused to recognize
statelessness
in
all
later
arrivals, thereby making the
situation
of the
refugees even more
intolerable.^" From the point of view of the governments concerned
it was
understandable enough
that
they
should keep
reminding
the League
of
Nations
"that
[its] Refugee work must be
liquidated with the utmost
ra-
pidity";^' they had many reasons
to fear that those who had been ejected
^'' The only guardians of the
right
of asylum were
the few
societies whose
special
aim was
the
protection
of human
rights. The most important
of them,
the
French-
sponsored
Ligue
des
Droits
de I'Homme
with
branches
in
all
democratic European
countries, behaved
as though
the question were
still merely the saving of individuals
persecuted
for
their
political
convictions
and
activities.
This
assumption,
pointless
already
in
the
case
of millions
of Russian
refugees, became simply absurd
for Jews
and Armenians. The Ligue was
neither ideologically nor administratively equipped to
handle the new problems. Since
it did not want to face the new situation,
it stumbled
into functions which were much
better
fulfilled by any of the many
charity agencies
which the refugees had
built up themselves with the help of their compatriots. When
the Rights of Man became the object of an especially
inefficient charity organization,
the concept of human rights naturally was discredited a
little more.
^*^ The many and varied
efforts of the
legal profession
to simplify the problem by
stating a difference between the stateless person and the refugee—such as maintaining
"that the status of a stateless person
is characterized by the fact of his having no nation-
ality, whereas that of a refugee
is determined by his having lost diplomatic protection"
(Simpson, op.
cit.,
p. 232)—were always defeated by the fact that
"all refugees are for
practical purposes stateless" (Simpson, op.
cit.,
p. 4).
^" The most ironical formulation of this general expectation was made by R. Yewdall
Jermings, "Some International Aspects of the Refugee Question" in British Yearbook
of International Law,
1939:
"The
status of a refugee
is
not, of course, a permanent
one. The aim
is that he should rid himself of that status as soon as possible, either by
repatriation or by naturalization
in the country of refuge."
^° Only the Russians, in every respect the aristocracy of the stateless people, and the
Armenians, who were assimilated to the Russian
status, were ever officially recognized
as
"stateless," placed under
the protection of the League of Nations' Nansen
Office,
and given traveling papers.
^' Childs, op.
cit. The reason for
this desperate attempt
at promptness was the fear
of
all governments that even the smallest
positive gesture "might encourage countries
to get rid of their unwanted people and that many might emigrate who would otherwise
remain
in
their countries even under
serious
disabilities"
(Louise W.
Holborn, "The
Legal Status of Political Refugees, 1920-38," in American Journal of International Law.
1938).

from
the old
trinity
of state-people-territory, which
still formed
the
basis
of E:uropcan organization and
political civilization, formed only the begin-
ning of an
increasing movement, were only the
first
trickle from an ever-
growing
reservoir.
It was obvious, and even the Evian Conference
recog-
nized
it
in
1938,
that
all German
and
Austrian
Jews
were
potentially
stateless; and
it was
only
natural
that
the
minority
countries
should
be
encouraged
by Germany's example
to
try
to
use
the same methods
for
getting
rid
of some of their minority
populations.'^-' Among the
minorities
the Jews and
the Armenians
ran
the
greatest
risks and soon showed
the
highest
proportion
of
statelessness;
but
they
proved
also
that
minority
treaties did not necessarily
offer protection but could
also serve
as an
in-
strument to single out certain groups for eventual expulsion.
Almost as frightening as these new dangers arising from the old trouble
spots of Europe was the entirely new kind of behavior of
all European na-
tionals in "ideological" struggles. Not only were people expelled from coun-
try and
citizenship, but more and more persons of
all countries, including
the Western democracies, volunteered to fight in
civil wars abroad
(some-
thing which up to then only a few idealists or adventurers had done) even
when
this meant
cutting themselves
off from
their
national communities.
This was the lesson of the Spanish
Civil War and one of the reasons why
the governments were so frightened by the
International Brigade. Matters
would not have been quite so bad
if this had meant that people no longer
clung so
closely
to
their nationality and were
ready
eventually
to be
as-
similated into another national community. But this was not at
all the case.
The
stateless people had
already shown
a
surprising stubbornness
in
re-
taining
their
nationality;
in every sense
the
refugees
represented
separate
foreign minorities who frequently did not care to be naturalized, and they
never banded
together,
as the minorities had done temporarily,
to defend
common
interests.^'' The International Brigade was organized into national
for the German refugees themselves. But the governments did not want to extend the
privileges
already
granted
to
a new category
of refugees who, moreover,
threatened
to increase
their number indefinitely."
^* To
the 600,000 Jews
in Germany and Austria who were potentially
stateless
in
1938, must
be added
the Jews
of Rumania
(the
president
of the Rumanian Federal
Commission
for
Minorities, Professor Dragomir, having
just announced
to
the world
the impending
revision of the citizenship of
all Rumanian Jews) and Poland
(whose
foreign
minister
Beck had
officially
declared
that
Poland had one
million Jews
too
many). See Simpson, op.
cit.,
p. 235.
^^ It
is
difficult to decide what came
first, the
nation-states' reluctance
to naturalize
refugees
(the practice of naturalization became increasingly restricted and the practice
of denaturalization increasingly common with the arrival of refugees)
or the refugees'
reluctance
to
accept
another
citizenship.
In
countries
with
minority
populations
like
Poland,
the refugees
(Russians and Ukrainians)
had a
definite tendency to assimilate
to the mmonties without however demanding Polish citizenship. (See Simpson, op.
cit.,
p. 364.)
The
behavior of Russian
refugees
is
quite
characteristic. The Nansen passport
de-
scribed
Its bearer
as "personne
d'origine
riisse," because "one would
not have dared
to
tell the Russian emigre that he was without nationality or of doubtful nationality."

battalions in which the Germans felt they fought against Hitler and the Ital-
ians
against
Mussolini,
just
as
a few
years
later,
in
the
Resistance,
the
Spanish
refugees
felt
they
fought
against
Franco when
they
helped
the
French against Vichy. What the European governments were so
afraid of
in
this process was that the new
stateless people could no longer be said
to
be
of
dubious
or
doubtful
nationality
(de
nationalite
indeterminee)
.
Even though they had renounced their citizenship, no longer had any con-
nection with or loyalty to their country of origin, and did not identify their
nationality
with
a
visible,
fully
recognized
government,
they
retained
a
strong attachment to their nationality. National splinter groups and minori-
ties, without deep roots in their territory and with no loyalty or relationship
to the state, had ceased to be characteristic only of the East. They had by
now infiltrated,
as refugees and stateless persons, the older nation-states of
the West.
The real trouble started as soon as the two recognized remedies, repatria-
tion and
naturalization, were
tried. Repatriation measures
naturally
failed
when there was no country to which these people could be deported. They
failed not because of consideration for the
stateless person
(as
it may ap-
pear today when Soviet Russia claims
its former citizens and the democratic
countries must
protect them from
a
repatriation
they do not want); and
not because of humanitarian sentiments on the
part of the countries
that
were swamped with refugees; but because neither the country of origin nor
any other agreed to accept the stateless person.
It would seem that the very
undeportability
of
the
stateless
person
should
have
prevented
a
govern-
ment's expelling him; but since the man without a
state was "an anomaly
for whom
there
is no
appropriate niche
in the framework of the
general
law"-'^—an outlaw by
definition—he was completely
at
the mercy
of the
police, which
itself did not worry too much about committing a few illegal
acts
in order to diminish the country's burden
of
indesirables.^-'
In
other
words, the state, insisting on
its sovereign right of expulsion, was forced by

It smuggled
its expelled stateless into the neighboring countries, with the
result that the
latter
retaliated
in
kind. The
ideal
solution of
repatriation,
to smuggle
the
refugee back
into
his country of origin, succeeded only in a few prominent
instances,
partly because
a
nontotalitarian
police was
still
restrained by
a
few rudimentary
ethical considerations,
partly because the
stateless person
was
as
likely
to be smuggled back from
his home
country
as from
any
other, and
last but not least because the whole traffic could go on only with
neighboring countries. The consequences of this smuggling were petty wars
between the police at the frontiers, which did not exactly contribute to good
international
relations, and an accumulation of
jail sentences for the
state-
less who. with the help of the police of one country, had passed "illegally"
into the
territory of another.
Every attempt by international conferences to establish some legal status
for stateless people failed because no agreement could possibly replace the
territory to which an
alien, within the framework of existing law, must be
deportable.
All
discussions
about
the
refugee
problems
revolved
around
this one
question: How can
the
refugee be made
deportable
again? The
second World War and the DP camps were not necessary to show that the
only practical substitute for a nonexistent homeland was an internment camp.
Indeed,
as early as the
thirties
this was the only "country" the world had
to offer the
stateless.^''
Naturalization, on the other hand, also proved to be a failure. The whole
naturalization
system
of European
countries
fell
apart when
it was con-
fronted with
stateless people, and
this for the same reasons that the
right
of asylum had been
set
aside.
Essentially naturalization was an appendage
to the
nation-state's legislation that reckoned only with "nationals," people
born
in
its territory and citizens by birth. Naturalization was needed in ex-
ceptional
cases,
for
single
individuals whom
circumstances
might
have
driven into a foreign territory. The whole process broke down when

came
a question of handling mass
applications
for
naturalization:^^ even
from
the
purely
administrative
point
of
view, no European
civil
service
could possibly have dealt with the problem. Instead of naturalizing
at least
a small portion of the new
arrivals,
the countries began
to cancel
earlier
naturalizations,
partly because of general panic and partly because the
ar-
rival of great masses of newcomers actually changed the always precarious
position of naturalized citizens of the same
origin.'*'' Cancellation of natural-
ization or the introduction of new laws which obviously paved the way for
mass denaturalization^" shattered what
little confidence the refugees might
have
retained
in
the
possibility
of
adjusting themselves
to
a new normal
life;
if assimilation to the new country once looked
a
little shabby or
dis-
loyal,
it was now simply
ridiculous. The
difference between
a
naturalized
citizen and a
stateless
resident was not great enough to
justify
taking any
trouble, the former being frequently deprived of important
civil
rights and
threatened
at any moment with the
fate of the
latter.
Naturalized persons
were
largely
assimilated
to
the
status
of
ordinary
aliens,
and
since
the
naturalized had already lost their previous citizenship, these measures simply
threatened another considerable group with statelessness.
It was almost
pathetic
to
see how
helpless
the European governments
were, despite their consciousness of the danger of statelessness to their estab-
lished legal and political institutions and despite
all their efforts to stem the
tide. Explosive events were no longer necessary. Once
a number of
state-
less people were
admitted
to
an
otherwise
normal
country,
statelessness
spread
like
a
contagious
disease.
Not
only
were
naturalized
citizens
in
danger of reverting to the
status of statelessness, but
living conditions for
all aliens markedly deteriorated. In the
thirties
it became increasingly
diffi-
^^ Two
instances of mass naturalization
in
the Near East were clearly exceptional:
one
involved Greek
refugees from Turkey whom
the Greek government
naturalized
en bloc
in
1922 because
it was actually a matter of repatriation of a Greek minority
and
not
of
foreign
citizens;
the
other
benefited Armenian
refugees from Turkey
in
Syria, Lebanon, and other formerly Turkish countries, that
is, a population with which
the Near East had shared common citizenship only a few years ago.
^® Where
a wave of refugees found members of
their own
nationality already
set-
tled
in
the country
to which they immigrated—as was
the
case with
the Armenians
and Italians in France, for example, and with Jews everywhere—a certain retrogression
set
in
in
the
assimilation
of
those who had
been
there
longer.
For
their
help and
solidarity could be
mobilized
only by
appealing
to
the
original
nationality
they had
in common
with
the newcomers.
This
point was
of immediate
interest
to countries
flooded by refugees but unable or unwilling
to give them
direct help or the
right to
work.
In
all these cases, national feelings of the older group proved to be "one of the
main
factors
in
the
successful establishment
of
the
refugees"
(Simpson,
op.
cit.,
pp.
45-46),
but
by
appealing
to
such
national
conscience
and
solidarity,
the
receiving
countries
naturally
increased
the number
of
unassimilated
aliens. To
take one
par-
ticularly
interesting
instance,
10,000
Italian
refugees were enough
to postpone
indefi-
nitely the
assimilation of almost one
million
Italian immigrants
in France.
'*° The French government, followed by other Western
countries, introduced during
the
thirties an
increasing number of
restrictions
for
naturalized
citizens:
they were
eliminated from certain professions for up to ten years after their naturalization, they
had no

rights,

cult
to
distinguish
clearly between
stateless
refugees and normal
resident
aliens. Once the government
tried to use
its
right and repatriate a resident
ilien against
his will, he would do his utmost to find refuge in statelessness.
During the
first World War enemy aliens had already discovered the great
advantages
of
statelessness.
But
what
then had
been
the
cunning
of
in-
dividuals who found
a loophole
in the law had now become the instinctive
reaction of
masses.
France,
Europe's
greatest

because
she
had
regulated
the
chaotic
labor market by
calling
in
alien
workers
in times
of need and deporting them
in
times
of unemployment
and
crisis, taught her aliens a lesson about the advantages of statelessness
which they did not readily forget. After 1935, the year of mass repatriation
by the Laval government from which only the stateless were saved, so-called
"economic
immigrants"
and
other
groups
of
earlier
origin—Balkans,
Italians.
Poles, and
Spaniards—mixed with
the waves
of
refugees
into
a
tangle that never again could be unraveled.
Much worse than what statelessness did to the time-honored and neces-
sary
distinctions
between
nationals
and
foreigners,
and
to
the
sovereign
right
of
states
in
matters
of
nationality
and
expulsion,
was
the damage
suffered by
the very
structure of
legal national
institutions when
a grow-
ing number of
residents had to
live
outside
the
jurisdiction of these laws
and
without
being
protected by
any
other. The
stateless
person,
without
right
to residence and without the
right to work, had of course constantly
to
transgress
the
law. He was
liable
to
jail
sentences
without
ever com-
mitting a crime. More than
that, the entire hierarchy of values which per-
tain in civilized countries was reversed in his case. Since he was the anomaly
for whom the general law did not provide,
it was better for him to become
an anomaly for which
it did provide, that of the criminal.
The best criterion by which to decide whether someone has been forced
outside the pale of the law
is to ask
if he would
benefit by committing
a
crime.
If a small burglary
is
likely to improve
his
legal
position,
at
least
temporarily, one may be sure he has been deprived of human
rights. For
then
a criminal offense becomes the best opportunity to regain some kind
of human
equality, even
if
it be
as
a
recognized exception
to
the norm.
The one important fact
is that
this exception
is provided for by law. As a
criminal
even
a
stateless
person
will
not be
treated worse
than
another
criminal, that
is, he will be treated like everybody
else. Only as an offender
against the law can he gain protection from
it. As long as his
trial and his
sentence
last, he
will be safe from
that arbitrary police
rule
against which
there are no lawyers and no appeals. The same man who was
in
jail yes-
terday because of his mere presence
in this world, who had no rights what-
ever and lived under threat of deportation, or who was dispatched without
sentence and without
trial to some kind of internment because he had tried
to work and make a
living, may become almost
a
full-fledged
citizen be-
cause of a
little theft. Even
if he
is penniless he can now get a lawyer, com-
plain about
his
jailers, and
he

longer the scum of the earth but important enough
to be informed of
all
the details of the law under which he
will be
tried. He has become
a
re-
spectable person. ^2
A much
less
reliable and much more
difficult way to
rise from an un-
recognized anomaly to the status of recognized exception would be to be-
come a genius. Just as the law knows only one difference between human
beings, the difference between the normal noncriminal and
the anomalous
criminal, so a conformist society has recognized only one form of determined
individualism, the genius. European bourgeois society wanted the genius to
stay outside
of human
laws,
to be a kind of monster whose
chief
social
function was to create excitement, and
it did not matter
if he actually was
an outlaw. Moreover,
the
loss
of citizenship deprived people
not only
of
protection, but also of
all clearly established,
officially recognized
identity,
a fact for which their eternal feverish efforts to obtain
at least birth
certifi-
cates from the country that denationalized them was a very exact symbol;
one of
their problems was solved when they
achieved
the degree
of
dis-
tinction that will rescue
a man from the huge and nameless crowd. Only
fame will eventually answer the repeated complaint of refugees of
all social
strata that "nobody here knows who
I am"; and
it
is true that the chances
of the famous refugee are improved just as a dog with a name has a better
chance to survive than a stray dog who
is just a dog in general.^"'
The nation-state, incapable of providing a law for those who had lost the
protection of
a
national government,
transferred
the whole
matter
to
the
police. This was the
first time the
police
in Western Europe had received
authority to
act on
its own,
to
rule directly over people;
in one sphere of
public life
it was no longer an instrument to carry out and enforce the law,
but had become
a
ruling
authority
independent
of government
and min-
istries.^*
Its strength and
its emancipation from law and government grew
in direct proportion to the influx of refugees. The greater the ratio of state-

compared with an expulsion order, cancellation of a work permit, or a decree sending

if he was
so lucky as to receive a long sentence, he might have returned righteously and peace-

to

profession, even
that of a professional
thief. His
jail
sentence
guaranteed him
the
constitutional
rights
that
nothing
else—no
protests
of
loyalty and no appeals—could have obtained for him once his citizenship had become
doubtful.

fact
that
the same
principle
of formation of an
elite
frequently worked
in
totalitarian concentration camps where the "aristocracy" was composed of a majority
of criminals and a few
"geniuses,"

artists, shows how
closely
related the
social positions of these groups
are.
** In
France,
for

it was
a
matter
of
record
that
an
order
of
expulsion
emanating from the police was much more serious than one which was issued "only" by
the
Ministry
of
Interior and
that
the
Minister

Interior could
only

cases

It
gcK-s
without
saying
that
the
totalitarian
regimes, where
the
police
had
risen
to
the peak
of power, were
especially eager
to consolidate
this
power through
the domination over vast groups of people, who, regardless
of any
offenses committed
by
individuals,
found
themselves
anyway
be-
yond the pale of the law. In Nazi Germany, the Nuremberg Laws with their
distinction between
Reich
citizens
(full
citizens)
and
nationals
(second-
class citizens without political rights) had paved the way for a development
in which eventually
all
nationals of "alien blood" could
lose
their nation-
ality by
official
decree; only
the outbreak
of the war prevented
a
corre-
sponding
legislation, which had been prepared
in
detail. ^*^ On
the
other
hand,
the
increasing
groups
of
stateless
in
the
nontotalitarian
countries
led
to
a form
of
lawlessness,
organized by
the
police,
which
practically
resulted
in
a
co-ordination
of
the
free world
with
the
legislation
of
the
totalitarian
countries. That concentration camps were
ultimately provided
for the same groups
in
all countries, even though
there were considerable
differences
in the treatment of their inmates, was
all the more characteristic
as
the
selection of the groups was
left exclusively
to the
initiative of the
totalitarian
regimes:
if
the
Nazis
put
a
person
in
a
concentration camp
and
if he made a successful escape,
say, to Holland, the Dutch would put
him
in
an
internment camp.
Thus,
long
before
the outbreak
of
the war
the police
in a number of Western countries, under the pretext of "national
security,"
had on
their own
initiative
established
close
connections
with
the Gestapo and the GPU, so that one might say there existed an independ-
ent foreign
policy of the
police.
This police-directed
foreign
policy
func-
tioned quite independently of the official governments; the relations between
the Gestapo and
the French
police were never more
cordial than
at

time
of Leon Blum's
popular-front government, which was
guided by
a
decidedly anti-German
policy.
Contrary
to
the
governments,
the
various
police organizations were never overburdened with "prejudices" against any
totalitarian regime; the information and denunciations received from GPU
agents were
just
as welcome
to them
as
those from
Fascist
or Gestapo
agents. They knew about the eminent
role
of the
police apparatus
in
all
totalitarian
regimes,
they knew
about
its
elevated
social
status
and
po-
litical
importance, and they
never bothered
to
conceal
their
sympathies.
That the
Nazis eventually met with
so
disgracefully
little
resistance from
the police
in
the countries they occupied, and
that they were
able
to
or-
ganize terror as much as they did with the assistance of these
local police
forces, was due
at
least
in part to the powerful position which the police
had achieved over the years
in their unrestricted and arbitrary domination
of stateless and refugees.
Both in the history of the "nation of minorities" and in the formation of
a stateless people, Jews have played a significant role. They were at the head
of the so-called minority movement because of their great need for protec-
tion (matched only by the need of the Armenians) and their excellent inter-
national connections, but above
all because they formed a majority
in no
country and therefore could be regarded as the minorite par excellence,
i.e.,
the only minority whose interests could be defended only by internationally
guaranteed protection.^^
The
special needs of the Jewish people were
the
best
possible
pretext
for denying that the Treaties were a compromise between the new nations'
tendency
forcefully
to
assimilate
alien
peoples and
nationalities who
for
reasons
of expediency
could
not
be
granted
the
right
to
national
self-
determination.
A similar incident made the Jews prominent in the discussion of the
ref-
ugee and statelessness problem. The
first Heimatlose or apatrides,
as they
were created by the Peace Treaties, were for the most part Jews who came
from the succession states and were unable or unwilling to place themselves
under the new minority protection of their homelands. Not until Germany
forced German Jewry
into emigration and
statelessness
did
they form
a
very considerable portion of the stateless people. But in the years following
Hitler's successful persecution of German Jews
all
the
minority
countries
began
to
think
in terms of expatriating
their
minorities, and
it was
only
natural
that they should
start
with
the minorite par
excellence,
the
only
nationality
that
actually had no other protection than
a
minority
system
which by now had become a mockery.
The notion that statelessness
is primarily a Jewish problem*^ was a pre-

Hitler's solution of the Jewish prob-

them

a new
category
of
refugees,
the
Arabs,
thereby
increasing
the
number of the stateless and rightless by another 700,000 to 800,000 people.
And what happened
in Palestine within the smallest territory and
in terms
of hundreds of thousands was then repeated
in India on a
large
scale
in-
volving many
millions
of
people.
Since
the
Peace
Treaties
of
1919
and
1920 the
refugees and the
stateless have attached themselves
like
a curse
to
all
the
newly
established
states on
earth
which
were
created
in
the
image of the nation-state.
For these new states this curse bears the germs of a deadly sickness. For
the
nation-state cannot
exist once
its
principle of equality before
the law
has broken down.
Without
this
legal
equality, which
originally was
des-
tined to replace the older laws and orders of the feudal society, the nation
dissolves
into an
anarchic mass
of over- and
underprivileged
individuals.
Laws
that
are
not equal
for
all
revert
to
rights and
privileges, something
contradictory
to the very nature of nation-states. The clearer the proof of
their
inability
to
treat
stateless people
as
legal persons and the greater the
extension of arbitrary rule by police decree, the more difficuh
it
is for states
to
resist the temptation to deprive
all citizens of legal status and rule them
with an omnipotent police.
II:
The
Perplexities
of
the Rights
of Man
THE DECLARATION of the Rights of Man at the end of the eighteenth century
was
a turning point
in
history.
It meant nothing more nor
less than
that
from
then on Man, and
not God's command
or
the customs
of
history,
should
be
the source of Law. Independent of the
privileges which
history
had bestowed upon certain strata of society or certain nations, the declara-
tion indicated man's emancipation from
all tutelage and announced that he
had now come of age.
when
there
is no longer a Jewish
question; but since Jews form such
a high percent-
age of the refugees, the refugee question
will be much
simplified" (Kabermann, "Das
mternationale Fliichtlingsproblem," in Zeitschrift
fiir Politik. Bd.
29, Heft
3,
1939).

DECLINE OF NATION-STATE; END OF RIGHTS OF MAN
291
Beyond
this, there was another implication of which the framers of the
declaration were only
half aware. The proclamation of human
rights was
also meant to be a much-needed protection in the new era where individuals
were no longer secure
in the
estates
to which
they were born or sure of
their equality before God
as Christians.
In other words,
in the new secu-
larized and emancipated
society, men were no longer sure
of these
social
and human rights which until then had been outside the political order and
guaranteed not by government and constitution, but by social, spiritual, and
religious forces. Therefore throughout the nineteenth century, the consensus
of opinion was that human
rights had to be invoked whenever individuals
needed
protection
against
the new
sovereignty
of
the
state and
the new
arbitrariness of society.
Since the Rights of Man were proclaimed to be "inalienable," irreducible
to and undeducible from other rights or laws, no authority was invoked for
their establishment; Man himself was their source as well as their ultimate
goal. No special law, moreover, was deemed necessary to protect them be-
cause
all laws were supposed to rest upon them. Man appeared
as the only
sovereign in matters of law as the people was proclaimed the only sovereign
in matters of government. The people's sovereignty
(different from that of
the prince) was not proclaimed by
the grace of God but
in the name of
Man, so
that
it seemed only natural
that the
"inalienable"
rights of man
would find their guarantee and become an inalienable part of the
right of
the people to sovereign self-government.
In other words, man had hardly appeared as a completely emancipated,
completely isolated being who carried his dignity within himself without ref-
erence to some larger encompassing order, when he disappeared again into
a member of a people. From the beginning the paradox involved in the dec-
laration of inalienable human rights was that
it reckoned with an "abstract"
human being who seemed to exist nowhere, for even savages lived in some
kind of a social order.
If a tribal or other "backward" community did not
enjoy human
rights,
it was obviously because
as
a whole
it had
not yet
reached
that stage of
civilization,
the
stage of popular and
national
sov-
ereignty, but was oppressed by foreign or native despots. The whole ques-
tion of human
rights, therefore, was quickly and inextricably blended with
the question
of
national emancipation; only
the emancipated
sovereignty
of the people, of one's own people, seemed to be able to insure them. As
mankind,
since
the French Revolution, was conceived
in
the image of
a
family of nations,
it gradually became self-evident that the people, and not
the individual, was the image of man.
The
full implication of
this
identification of the
rights of man with the
rights of peoples
in
the European
nation-state system came
to
light only
when a growing number of people and peoples suddenly appeared whose
elementary rights were
as
little safeguarded by the ordinary functioning of
nation-states in the middle of Europe as they would have been in the heart
of Africa. The Rights of Man, after
all, had been defined as "inalienable"
because they were supposed
to be independent of
all governments; but
it

ij2
IMPERULISM
turned out that the moment human beings lacked their own government and
had to
fall back upon their minimum rights, no authority was left to protect
them and no institution was willing to guarantee them. Or when, as in the
case of the minorities, an international body arrogated to itself a nongovern-
mental
authority,
its
failure was apparent even
before
its measures were
fully
realized; not only were the governments more or
less openly opposed
to
this encroachment on
their sovereignty, but the concerned
nationalities
themselves did not recognize a nonnational guarantee, mistrusted everything
which was
not
clear-cut support of
their "national"
(as opposed
to
their
mere "linguistic, religious, and ethnic")
rights, and preferred either, like the
Germans or Hungarians, to turn to the protection of the "national" mother
country, or,
like the Jews, to some kind of interterritorial
solidarity."*"^
The stateless people were as convinced as the minorities that loss of na-
tional
rights was
identical
with
loss
of human
rights,
that the former
in-
evitably entailed the latter. The more they were excluded from right in any
form, the more they tended to look for a reintegration into a national, into
their own national community. The Russian refugees were only the
first to
insist on their nationality and to defend themselves furiously against attempts
to lump them together with other stateless people. Since them, not a single
group of refugees or Displaced Persons has failed to develop a fierce, violent
group consciousness and
to clamor
for
rights
as—and only
as—Poles or
Jews or Germans, etc.
Even worse was that
all societies formed for the protection of the Rights
of Man,
all attempts to arrive at a new bill of human rights were sponsored
by marginal figures—by a few international jurists without political experi-
ence or professional philanthropists supported by the uncertain sentiments
of professional
idealists. The groups they formed, the declarations they
is-
sued, showed an uncanny
similarity
in language and
composition
to
that
of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals. No statesman, no po-
litical
figure
of any
importance
could
possibly
take them
seriously; and
none
of
the
liberal
or
radical
parties
in Europe
thought
it
necessary
to
incorporate into their program a new declaration of human
rights. Neither
before nor
after the second World War have
the victims themselves ever
invoked these fundamental
rights, which were so evidently denied them, in
their many attempts to find a way out of the barbed-wire labyrinth into which
events had driven them. On
the
contrary,
the
victims shared
the disdain
" Pathetic
instances
of
this
exclusive
confidence
in
national
rights were
the
con-
sent
before the second World War, of nearly 75
per cent of the German minority in
the Itahan Tyrol to leave their homes and
resettle in Germany, the voluntary repatria-
tion of a German island
in Slovenia which had been there since the fourteenth century
or. immediately after the close of the war, the unanimous rejection by Jewish refugees
in an
Italian DP camp of an
offer of mass naturalization by the
Italian government.
In the face of the experience of European peoples between
the two wars,
it would be
a
serious
mistake
to
interpret
this
behavior
simply
as
another example
of
fanatic
nationalist
sentiment;
these
people
no
longer
felt
sure
of
their elementary
rights
if
these
were
not
protected
by
a
government
to
which
they
belonged
by
birth.

and indifference of the powers that be for any attempt of the marginal so-
cieties to enforce human rights in any elementary or general sense.
The failure of
all responsible persons
to meet the calamity of an ever-
growing body of people forced to live outside the scope of
all tangible law
with the proclamation of a new
bill of rights was
certainly not due
to
ill
will. Never
before had
the
Rights
of Man,
solemnly proclaimed by
the
French and the American revolutions
as the new fundament
for
civilized
societies, been
a
practical
political
issue. During
the
nineteenth
century,
these rights had been invoked in a rather perfunctory way, to defend indi-
viduals against the increasing power of the
state and
to mitigate the new
social insecurity caused by the
industrial
revolution. Then the meaning of
human rights acquired a new connotation: they became the standard slogan
of the protectors of the underprivileged,
a kind of additional
law,
a
right
of exception necessary for those who had nothing better to fall back upon.
The reason why the concept of human
rights was
treated
as
a
sort
of
stepchild
by
nineteenth-century
political
thought
and why
no
liberal
or
radical party
in the twentieth
century, even when an urgent need for en-
forcement of human
rights
arose, saw
fit to
include them
in
its program
seems obvious:
civil rights—that
is the varying rights of citizens in different
countries—were supposed to embody and
spell out in the form of tangible
laws the eternal Rights of Man, which by themselves were supposed to be
independent of citizenship and nationality. All human beings were citizens
of some kind of political community;
if the laws
of their country did not
live up to the demands of the Rights of Man, they were expected to change
them, by legislation in democratic countries or through revolutionary action
in despotisms.
The Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable
even
in
countries whose
constitutions were
based upon them—whenever
people appeared who were no longer citizens of any sovereign state. To this
fact, disturbing enough in
itself, one must add the confusion created by the
many
recent attempts
to frame
a new
bill
of human
rights, which have
demonstrated that no one seems able to define with any assurance what these
general human rights, as distinguished from the rights of citizens, really are.
Although everyone seems to
agree that the plight of these people consists
precisely in their loss of the Rights of Man, no one seems to know which
rights they lost when they lost these human rights.
The first loss which the rightless suffered was the loss of their homes, and
this meant the loss of the entire social texture into which they were born and
in which they established for themselves a distinct place in the world. This
calamity
is far from unprecedented; in the long memory of history, forced
migrations of individuals or whole groups of people for political or economic
reasons look like everyday occurrences. What
is unprecedented
is not the
loss of a home but the impossibility of finding a new one. Suddenly, there
was no place on earth where migrants could go without the severest restric-
tions, no country where they would be assimilated, no territory where they
could found a new community of their own.
This, moreover, had next to

iy^
IMPERIALISM
nothing to do with any material problem of overpopulation;
it was a prob-
lem not of space but of political organization. Nobody had been aware that
mankind, for so long a time considered under the image of a family of na-
tions, had reached the stage where whoever was thrown out of one of these
tightly organized closed communities found himself thrown out of the family
of nations altogether.^'*
The second
loss which the
rightless suffered was the
loss of government
protection, and
this did not imply just the loss of legal
status in their own,
but
in
all
countries.
Treaties
of
reciprocity and
international
agreements
have woven a web around the earth that makes
it possible for the citizen of
every country to take his legal status with him no matter where he goes
(so
that,
for
instance,
a German
citizen under the Nazi regime might not be
able
to enter
a mixed
marriage abroad because
of the Nuremberg laws).
Yet. whoever
is no longer caught in
it finds himself out of legality altogether
(thus during the last war stateless people were invariably in a worse position
than enemy aliens who were
still indirectly protected by their governments
through international agreements).
By itself the loss of government protection is no more unprecedented than
the loss of a home. Civilized countries did offer the right of asylum to those
who.
for
political reasons, had been persecuted by their governments, and
this practice, though never officially incorporated into any constitution, has
functioned well enough throughout the nineteenth and even in our century.
Tlie trouble arose when
it appeared
that the new categories of persecuted
were far too numerous to be handled by an unofficial practice destined for
exceptional cases. Moreover, the majority could hardly qualify for the right
of asylum, which
implicitly presupposed
political
or
religious
convictions
which were not outlawed
in the country of refuge. The new refugees were
persecuted not because of what they had done or thought, but because of
what they unchangeably were—born
into
the wrong kind
of
race
or
the
wrong kind of class or drafted by the wrong kind of government
(as in the
case of the Spanish Republican Army).^"'
The more
the number of rightless people increased, the
greater became
the temptation to pay less attention to the deeds of the persecuting govern-
ments than
to
the
status of the persecuted. And the
first glaring fact was
that these people, though persecuted under some
political pretext, were no
"The few chances
for
reintegration open
to
the new migrants were mostly based
on their nationality: Spanish refugees, for instance, were welcomed to a certain extent
in Mexico. The United States,
in the early twenties, adopted a quota system according
to which each
nationality already represented
in
the country received, so to speak, the
right
to
receive
a number of former countrymen
proportionate
to
its numerical part
in the
total population.
'" How dangerous
it can
be
to
be
innocent
from
the
point
of view of the
perse-
cutmg government, became very
clear when, during the
last war,
the American gov-
ernment
offered
asylum
to
all
those German
refugees who were
threatened by
the
extradition paragraph
in
the German-French
Armistice. The condition was, of course,
that
the
applicant could prove
that
he had done something
against
the Nazi
regime.
The proportion of refugees from Germany who were able
to
fulfill
this condition was
very small, and they, strangely enough, were not the people who were most in danger.

DECLINE OF NATION-STATE; END OF RIGHTS OF MAN

longer,
as the persecuted had been throughout
history,
a
liability and an
image
of shame
for
the
persecutors;
that
they
were
not
considered
and
hardly pretended to be active enemies (the few thousand Soviet chizens who
voluntarily left Soviet Russia after the second World War and found asylum
in democratic countries did more damage to the prestige of the Soviet Union
than millions of refugees in the twenties who belonged to the wrong class),
but that they were and appeared to be nothing but human beings whose very
innocence—from every point of view, and especially that of the persecuting
government—was their greatest misfortune. Innocence, in the sense of com-
plete lack of responsibility, was the mark of their rightlessness as
it was the
seal of their loss of political
status.
Only in appearance therefore do the needs for a reinforcement of human
rights touch upon the fate of the authentic
political
refugee.
Political
ref-
ugees, of necessity few in number,
still enjoy the
right to asylum
in many
countries, and this right acts, in an informal way, as a genuine substitute for
national law.
One of the surprising aspects of our experience with stateless people who
benefit legally from committing a crime has been the fact that
it seems to
be easier to deprive a completely innocent person of legality than someone
who has committed an
offense.
Anatole
France's famous
quip,
"If
I am
accused of stealing the towers of Notre Dame,
I can only
flee the country,"
has assumed a horrible reality. Jurists are so used to thinking of law in terms
of punishment, which indeed always deprives us of certain rights, that they
may find
it even more difficult than the layman to recognize that the depriva-
tion of
legality,
i.e., of all
rights, no longer has
a connection with
specific
crimes.
This situation illustrates the many perplexities inherent in the concept of
human rights. No matter how they have once been defined
(life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness, according to the American formula, or as equality
before
the
law,
liberty,
protection
of
property, and
national
sovereignty,
according to the French); no matter how one may attempt to improve an
ambiguous formulation like the pursuit of happiness, or an antiquated one
like
unqualified
right
to
property;
the
real
situation
of
those whom
the
twentieth century has driven outside the pale of the law shows that these are
rights of citizens whose loss does not entail absolute rightlessness. The
sol-
dier during the war
is deprived of his right to
life, the criminal of his right
to freedom,
all citizens during an emergency of their right to the pursuit of
happiness, but nobody would ever claim that
in any of these
instances
a
loss of human rights has taken place. These
rights, on the other hand, can
be granted (though hardly enjoyed) even under conditions of fundamental
rightlessness.
The calamity of the rightless
is not that they are deprived of
life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness, or of equality before the law and freedom of
opinion—formulas
which
were
designed
to
solve
problems
within
given
communities—but that
they no longer belong
to any community whatso-
ever. Their plight
is not that they are not equal before the law, but that no

2<^6
IMPERIALISM
law exists for them; not that they are oppressed but that nobody wants even
to oppress them. Only
in the
last stage of a rather lengthy process
is
their
right
to
live threatened; only
if they remain perfectly "superfluous,"
if no-
btxly can be found to "claim" them, may their lives be in danger. Even the
Nazis started their extermination of Jews by
first depriving them of
all legal
status (the status of second-class citizenship) and cutting them off from the
world of the
living by herding them into ghettos and concentration camps;
and before they
set the gas chambers into motion they had carefully tested
the ground and found out to their satisfaction that no country would claim
these
people. The
point
is
that
a condition of complete
rightlessness was
created before the right to live was challenged.
The same
is true even to an
ironical extent with regard to the
right of
freedom which
is sometimes considered
to be
the very essence
of human
rights. There
is no question that those outside the pale of the law may have
more freedom
of movement
than
a
lawfully imprisoned
criminal
or
that
they enjoy more freedom of opinion in the internment camps of democratic
countries than they would in any ordinary despotism, not to mention in a
totalitarian country."'" But neither physical safety—being fed by some state
or private welfare agency—nor freedom of opinion changes in the least their
fundamental situation of rightlessness. The prolongation of their lives
is due
to charity and not to
right, for no law exists which could force the nations
to feed them; their freedom of movement,
if they have
it
at
all, gives them
no right
to residence which even the jailed criminal enjoys
as a matter of
course; and their freedom of opinion
is a fool's freedom, for nothing they
think matters anyhow.
These
last
points
are
crucial. The
fundamental
deprivation
of human
rights
is manifested
first and above
all
in the deprivation of a place in the
world
which makes
opinions
significant and
actions
effective.
Something
much more fundamental than freedom and justice, which are
rights of
cit-
izens,
is at stake when belonging to the community into which one
is born
is no longer
a matter of course and not belonging no longer a matter of
choice, or when one
is placed
in
a
situation where,
unless he commits a
crime, his treatment by others does not depend on what he does or does not
do. This extremity, and nothing else,
is the situation of people deprived of
human
rights. They
are deprived, not of the
right
to freedom, but
of the
right
to action; not of the
right
to think whatever they
please, but
of the
right to opinion.
Privileges
in some cases, injustices
in most, blessings and
doom are meted out to them according to accident and without any relation
whatsoever to what they do, did, or may do.

opinions) and a right to belong to some kind of organized community, only
when millions of people emerged who had
lost and could not regain these
rights because of the new global political situation. The trouble
is that
this
calamity arose not from any
lack
of
civilization,
backwardness,
or mere
tyranny, but, on the contrary, that
it could not be repaired, because there
was no longer any "uncivilized" spot on earth, because whether we like
it
or not we have really started to live in One World. Only with a completely
organized humanity could
the
loss
of home and
political
status become
identical with expulsion from humanity altogether.
Before
this, what we must call a "human right" today would have been
thought
of
as
a
general
characteristic
of the human
condition which no
tyrant could take away.
Its
loss entails the
loss of the relevance of speech
(and man,
since
Aristotle, has been
defined
as
a being commanding the
power of speech and thought), and the loss of
all human relationship (and
man, again since
Aristotle, has been thought of as the
"political
animal,"
that is one who by definition lives in a community), the loss, in other words,
of some of the most essential characteristics of human
life. This was to a
certain extent the plight of slaves, whom
Aristotle therefore did not count
among human beings.
Slavery's fundamental
offense
against human
rights
was not that
it took liberty away (which can happen in maii.y other
situa-
tions), but that
it excluded a certain category of people even from the pos-
sibility of fighting for freedom—a
fight possible under tyranny,
and even
under the desperate conditions of modern terror (but not under any condi-
tions of concentration-camp life). Slavery's crime against humanity did not
begin when one people defeated and enslaved
its enemies (though of course
this was bad enough), but when
slavery became an
institution
in which
some men were "born" free and others slave, when
it was forgotten that
it
was man who had deprived his fellow-men of freedom, and when the sanc-
tion for the crime was attributed to nature. Yet in the light of recent events
it
is possible to say that even slaves
still belonged to some
sort of human
community; their labor was needed, used, and exploited, and this kept them
within the pale of humanity. To be a slave was after all to have a distinctive
character,
a
place
in
society—more than the
abstract nakedness of being
human and nothing but human. Not the
loss of
specific
rights,
then, but
the loss of a community willing and able to guarantee any rights whatsoever,
has been the calamity which has befallen ever-increasing numbers of people.
Man,
it turns out, can lose
all so-called Rights
of Man without losing his
essential quality as man, his human dignity. Only the
loss of a polity
itself
expels him from humanity.
The
right
that corresponds
to
this
loss and
that was
never even men-
tioned among the human
rights cannot be expressed
in the
categories
of
the eighteenth century because they presume that rights spring immediately
from
the
"nature"
of man—whereby
it makes
relatively
little
difference
whether this nature
is visualized in terms of the natural law or in terms of
a being created in the image of God, whether
it concerns "natural" rights or
divine commands. The
decisive factor
is
that these
rights and the human
dignity they bestow should remain valid and real even if only a single human

29,^
IMPERIALISM
being existed on earth; they are independent of human plurality and should
remain valid even
if a human being
is expelled from the human community.
When the Rights of Man were proclaimed
for the
first time, they were
regarded
as being independent of history and the
privileges which
history
had accorded certain
strata of
society. The new independence
constituted
the newly discovered dignity of man. From the beginning, this new dignity
was of a rather ambiguous nature. Historical rights were replaced by natural
rights, "nature" took the place of history, and
it was
tacitly assumed
that
nature was less alien than history to the essence of man. The very language
of the Declaration of Independence as well as of the Declaration des Droits
de I'Homme—"inalienable," "given with
birth,"
"self-evident truths"—im-
plies
the
belief
in
a kind
of human "nature" which would be
subject
to
the same laws of growth as that of the individual and from which rights and
laws could
be
deduced. Today we
are
perhaps
better
qualified
to
judge
exactly what
this human "nature" amounts
to;
in any event
it has shown
us
potentialities
that were neither recognized nor even suspected by West-
ern philosophy and religion, which for more than three thousand years have
defined and redefined this "nature." But
it
is not only the, as
it were, human
aspect of nature that has become questionable to us. Ever since man learned
to master
it
to such an extent
that
the destruction of
all organic
life on
earth with man-made instruments has become conceivable and technically
possible, he has been alienated from nature. Ever since a deeper knowledge
of natural processes
instilled serious doubts about the existence
of natural
laws
at
all, nature
itself has assumed a sinister aspect. How should one be
able
to deduce
laws and
rights from
a universe which apparently knows
neither the one nor the other category?
Man
of
the
twentieth
century
has become
just
as
emancipated
from
nature as eighteenth-century man was from history. History and nature have
become equally
alien to
us, namely,
in the sense that the essence of man
can no longer be comprehended in terms of either category. On the other
hand, humanity, which for the eighteenth century,
in Kantian terminology,
was no more than a regulative idea, has today become an inescapable fact.
This new
situation,
in which "humanity" has
in
effect assumed
the
role
formerly
ascribed
to
nature
or
history, would mean
in
this
context
that
the
right
to have
rights, or the
right of every individual
to belong
to hu-
manity, should be guaranteed by humanity
itself.
It
is by no means certain
whether this
is possible. For, contrary
to the best-intentioned humanitarian
attempts to obtain new declarations of human rights from international or-
ganizations,
it should be understood
that
this
idea transcends
the
present
sphere of international law which
still operates in terms of reciprocal agree-
ments
and
treaties
between
sovereign
states;
and,
for
the
time
being,
a
sphere that
is above the nations does not exist. Furthermore,
this dilemma
would by no means be eliminated by the establishment of a "world gov-
ernment." Such a world government
is indeed within the realm of possibility,
but one may suspect that in reality
it might differ considerably from the ver-
sion promoted by
idealistic-minded organizations. The crimes
against hu-
man rights, which have become a specialty of totalitarian regimes, can always

be justified by the pretext that
right
is equivalent to being good or useful
for the whole in distinction to
its parts.
(Hitler's motto that "Right
is what
is good for the German people"
is only the vulgarized form of a conception
of law which can be found everywhere and which
in practice
will remain
ineffectual
only
so
long
as
older
traditions
that
are
still
effective
in
the
constitutions prevent
this.) A conception
of law which
identifies what
is
right with the notion of what
is good for—for the individual, or the family,
or the people, or the largest number—becomes inevitable once the absolute
and transcendent measurements of religion or the law of nature have
lost
their authority. And this predicament
is by no means solved
if the unit to
which the "good for" applies
is
as large as mankind
itself. For
it
is
quite
conceivable, and even
within
the realm of
practical
political
possibilities,
that one fine day a highly organized and mechanized humanity will conclude
quite democratically—namely by majority
decision—that for humanity
as
a whole
it would be better
to liquidate
certain parts thereof. Here,
in the
problems of factual
reality, we are confronted with one of the oldest per-
plexities
of
political
philosophy,
which
could remain
undetected
only
so
long as a stable Christian theology provided the framework for
all political
and philosophical problems, but which long ago caused Plato to say: "Not
man, but a god, must be the measure of all things."
These facts and reflections offer what seems an
ironical,
bitter, and be-
lated
confirmation
of
the famous
arguments
with which Edmund
Burke
opposed the French Revolution's Declaration of the Rights of Man. They
appear to buttress
his
assertion that human
rights were an
"abstraction,"
that
it was much wiser to rely on an "entailed inheritance" of rights which
one transmits to one's children like life
itself, and to claim one's rights to be
the "rights of an Englishman" rather than the inalienable
rights of man.^^
According to Burke, the rights which we enjoy spring "from within the na-
tion," so that neither natural law, nor divine command, nor any concept of
mankind such as Robespierre's "human race," "the sovereign of the earth,"
are needed as a source of law.^^
The pragmatic soundness of Burke's concept seems to be beyond doubt in
the light of our manifold experiences. Not only did loss of national rights in
all instances entail the loss of human rights; the restoration of human rights,
as the recent example of the State of
Israel
proves, has been achieved so
far only through the restoration or the establishment of national rights. The
conception of human rights, based upon the assumed existence of a human
being as such, broke down
at the very moment when those who professed
to believe in
it were for the
first time confronted with people who had in-
deed lost all other qualities and specific relationships—except that they were
still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of
being human. And in view of objective political conditions,
it
is hard to say
how the concepts of man upon which human
rights are based—that he

created
in the image of God
(in the American formula), or that he
is the
a'prcsentativc of mankind, or that he harbors within himself the sacred de-
mands of natural law
(in the French formula)—could have helped to find
a solution to the problem.
The survivors of the extermination camps, the inmates of concentration
and internment camps, and even the comparatively happy
stateless people
could
see without Burke's arguments
that the abstract nakedness of being
nothing but human was their greatest danger. Because of
it they were
re-
garded as savages and, afraid that they might end by being considered beasts,
they insisted on their nationality, the last sign of their former citizenship, as
their only remaining and
recognized
tie with humanity.
Their
distrust
of
natural, their preference for national, rights comes precisely from their real-
ization that
natural
rights are granted even to savages. Burke had already
feared that natural "inalienable" rights would confirm only the "right of the
naked savage,""''' and therefore reduce civilized nations to the status of sav-
agery. Because only savages have nothing more to
fall back upon than the
minimum fact of their human origin, people cling to their nationality
all the
more desperately when they have
lost
the
rights and protection
that such
nationality once gave them. Only their past with
its
"entailed inheritance"
seems to attest to the fact that they
still belong to the civilized world.
If a human being loses
his
political
status, he should, according to the
implications of the inborn and inalienable rights of man, come under exactly
the
situation
for which
the
declarations
of such
general
rights
provided.
Actually the opposite
is the case.
It seems that a man who
is nothing but a
man has lost the very qualities which make
it possible for other people to
treat him as a fellow-man. This
is one of the reasons why
it
is far more dif-
ficult to destroy the legal personality of a criminal, that is of a man who has
taken upon himself the
responsibility
for an act whose consequences now
determine his fate, than of a man who has been disallowed all common hu-
man responsibilities.
Burke's arguments therefore gain an added
significance
if we look only
at the general human condition of those who have been forced out of
all
political communities. Regardless of treatment, independent of liberties or
oppression, justice or
injustice, they have
lost
all those parts of the world
and all those aspects of human existence which are the result of our common
labor, the outcome of the human
artifice.
If the tragedy of savage tribes
is
that they inhabit an unchanged nature which they cannot master, yet upon
whose abundance or frugality they depend for their livelihood, that they live
and die without leaving any trace, without having contributed anything to a
common world, then these
rightless people are indeed thrown back into a
peculiar state of nature. Certainly they
are not barbarians; some of them,
indeed, belong
to
the most educated
strata
of
their
respective
countries;
nevertheless, in a world that has almost liquidated savagery, they appear as
the first signs of a possible regression from civilization.

world
it has produced, the more at home men feel within the human artifice
—the more they will resent everything they have not produced, everything
that
is merely and mysteriously given them. The human being who has lost
his place in a community, his political status in the struggle of his time, and
the legal personality which makes his actions and part of his destiny a con-
sistent whole,
is left with those qualities which usually can become articulate
only in the sphere of private
life and must remain unqualified, mere
exist-
ence in all matters of public concern. This mere existence, that
is,
all that
which
is mysteriously given us by
birth and which
includes
the shape of
our bodies and the talents of our minds, can be adequately dealt with only
by the unpredictable hazards of friendship and sympathy, or by the great
and incalculable grace of love, which says with Augustine, "Volo ut sis
(I
want you to be)," without being able to give any particular reason for such
supreme and unsurpassable affirmation.
Since
the
Greeks, we
have known
that
highly
developed
political
life
breeds
a deep-rooted
suspicion of
this
private
sphere,
a deep
resentment
against the disturbing miracle contained in the fact that each of us
is made
as he
is—single, unique, unchangeable.
This whole
sphere
of the merely
given, relegated to private
life
in civilized society,
is a permanent threat to
the public sphere, because the public sphere
is as consistently based on the
law of equality as the private sphere
is based on the law of universal
dif-
ference and
differentiation.
Equality,
in contrast
to
all
that
is involved
in
mere existence,
is not given us, but
is the result of human organization inso-
far as
it
is guided by the principle of justice. We
are not born equal; we
become equal
as members of a group on the
strength of our decision to
guarantee ourselves mutually equal
rights.
Our
political
life
rests on the assumption that we can produce
equality
through organization, because man can act in and change and build a com-
mon world, together with
his equals and
only with
his
equals. The dark
background of mere givenness, the background formed by our unchange-
able and unique nature, breaks
into the
political scene
as the
alien which
in
its
all
too obvious
difference
reminds
us
of
the
limitations of human
activity—which
are
identical with
the
limitations
of human
equality. The
reason why highly developed political communities, such as the ancient city-
states
or modern
nation-states,
so
often
insist
on
ethnic homogeneity
is
that they hope to eliminate as far as possible those natural and always pres-
ent differences and differentiations which by themselves arouse dumb hatred,
mistrust,
and
discrimination
because
they
indicate
all
too
clearly
those
spheres where men cannot act and change at will,
i.e., the limitations of the
human artifice. The "alien"
is a frightening symbol of the fact of difference
as such, of individuality as such, and indicates those realms
in which man
cannot change and cannot
act and
in
which,
therefore, he has
a
distinct
tendency to destroy.
If a Negro in a white community
is considered a Negro
and nothing else, he loses along with
his
right to equality that freedom of
action which is specifically human;
all his deeds are now explained as "nec-
essary" consequences of some "Negro" qualities; he has become some speci-

302
IMPERIALISM
men
of an animal
species,
called man. Much
the same
thing happens
to
those who have lost all distinctive political qualities and have become human
beings and
nothing
else. No
doubt,
wherever
public
life
and
its law
of
equality are completely victorious, wherever a civilization succeeds
in elim-
inating or reducing
to
a minimum
the dark background
of
difference,
it
will end
in complete petrifaction and be punished,
so to speak, for having
forgotten that man
is only the master, not the creator of the world.
The great danger arising from the existence of people forced to live out-
side the common world
is that they are thrown back,
in the midst of civil-
ization, on their natural givenness, on their mere
differentiation. They lack
that tremendous equalizing of differences which comes from being citizens
of some commonwealth and
yet, since they are no longer allowed
to par-
take
in
the human
artifice,
they
begin
to
belong
to
the human
race
in
much the same way as animals belong to a specific animal species. The par-
adox involved
in the
loss of human
rights
is that such
loss coincides with
the instant when
a person becomes a human being
in general—without
a
profession,
without
a
citizenship,
without an
opinion,
without
a
deed by
which to identify and specify himself
and different in general, representing
nothing
but
his own
absolutely
unique
individuality
which,
deprived
of
expression within and action upon a common world, loses
all
significance.
The danger
in the existence of such people
is twofold:
first and more
obviously,
their
ever-increasing numbers
threaten
our
political
life,
our
human
artifice, the world which
is the
result of our common and co-ordi-
nated
effort
in much the same, perhaps even more
terrifying, way
as the
wild elements of nature once threatened the existence
of man-made
cities
and countrysides. Deadly danger to any civilization
is no longer
likely
to
come from without. Nature has been mastered and no barbarians threaten to
destroy what they cannot understand, as the Mongolians threatened Europe
for
centuries. Even
the emergence
of
totalitarian governments
is
a
phe-
nomenon within, not outside, our civilization. The danger
is that a global,
universally
interrelated
civilization may produce
barbarians from
its own
midst by forcing millions of people
into conditions which,
despite
all ap-
p>earances, are the conditions of savages.^*
'* This modern expulsion from humanity has much more radical consequences than
the
ancient and medieval custom of outlawry.
Outlawry,
certainly
the "most
fearful
fate which
primitive law could
inflict," placing
the
life of the outlawed person
at the
mercy of anyone he met, disappeared with the establishment of an effective system of
law enforcement and was
finally replaced by extradition
treaties between
the
nations.
It had been primarily a substitute for a police
force, designed
to compel criminals to
surrender.
The early Middle Ages seem
to have been
quite conscious of the danger involved
m
"civil
death."
Excommunication
in
the
late Roman
Empire meant
ecclesiastical
death
but
left
a person who had
lost
his membership
in
the church
full
freedom
in
all
other
respects.
Ecclesiastical and
civil
death became
identical
only
in
the Mero-
vmgian
era, and
there excommunication
"in general practice
[was]
limited
to tempo-
rary withdrawal or suspension of the
rights of membership which might be regained."

is more characteristic of the totaUtarian movements in general
and
of the
quality
of fame
of
their
leaders
in
particular than
the
startling swiftness with which they are forgotten and the startling ease with
which
they
can
be
replaced. What
Stalin
accomplished
laboriously
over
many years through
bitter factional
struggles and vast concessions
at
least
to the name
of
his predecessor—namely,
to legitimate himself
as Lenin's
political
heir—Stalin's
successors
attempted
to do without
concessions
to
the name of their predecessor, even though Stalin had thirty years' time and
could
manipulate
a
propaganda
apparatus, unknown
in
Lenin's
day,
to
immortalize his name. The same
is true for Hitler, who during his lifetime
exercised a fascination to which allegedly no one was immune,^ and who
' The "magic spell" that Hitler cast over his listeners has been acknowledged many
times,
latterly by the publishers of Hitlers Tischgesprache, Bonn,
1951

Talks,
American
edition. New
York,
1953;
quotations
from
the
original German
edition). This
fascination—"the strange magnetism
that
radiated from
Hitler
in such
a compelling manner"—rested indeed "on the fanatical
belief of this man
in himself"
(introduction by Gerhard
Ritter,
p.
14), on
his pseudo-authoritative judgments about
everything under the sun, and on the
fact
that
his opinions—whether they dealt with
the
harmful
effects of smoking
or
with Napoleon's
policies—could
always be
fitted
into an all-encompassing ideology.
Fascination
is a
social phenomenon, and
the
fascination
Hitler exercised
over
his
environment must be understood
in terms of the particular company he kept. Society
is always
prone
to
accept
a
person
offhand
for what
he
pretends
to
be,
so
that a
crackpot
posing
as
a
genius always has
a
certain chance
to be
believed.
In modern
society, with
its characteristic lack of discerning judgment, this tendency is strengthened,
so
that someone who
not only
holds
opinions
but
also
presents them
in
a
tone
of
unshakable
conviction
will
not
so
easily
forfeit
his
prestige,
no
matter how many
times
he
has
been
demonstrably
wrong.
Hitler, who
knew
the
modern
chaos
of
opinions
from
first-hand
experience,
discovered
that
the
helpless
seesawing between
various
opinions and
"the
conviction
.
.
.
that
everything
is
balderdash"
(p.
281)
could best be avoided by adhering to one of the many current opinions with "unbend-
ing consistency." The
hair-raising
arbitrariness of such fanaticism holds great fascina-
tion
for
society because
for the duration
of the
social
gathering
it
is freed from the
chaos
of
opinions
that
it
constantly
generates.
This
"gift"
of
fascination,
however,
has only social relevance;
it
is so prominent
in the
Tischgesprficlie because here Hitler
played the game of society and was not speaking to his own kind but to the generals
of
the Wehrmacht,
all of whom more or
less belonged
to
"society." To
believe that
Hitler's
successes were based on
his "powers
of
fascination"
is altogether erroneous;
with those qualities alone he would have never advanced beyond the role of a promi-
nent figure in the salons.

jfQfy
TOTALITARIANISM
after
his defeat and death
is today so thoroughly forgotten that he scarcely
plays any further role even among the neo-Fascist and neo-Nazi groups of
postwar Germany. This impermanence no doubt has something to do with
the
proverbial
fickleness
of
the
masses and
the fame
that
rests on them;
more
likely,
it can be traced to the perpetual-motion mania of totalitarian
movements which can remain
in power only so long as they keep moving
and
set everything around them
in motion.
Therefore,
in a
certain
sense
this very impermanence
is a rather flattering testimonial to the dead leaders
insofar
as
they
succeeded
in contaminating
their
subjects
with
the
speci-
fically
totalitarian
virus; for
if there
is such
a thing as
a
totalitarian per-
sonality or
mentality,
this extraordinary
adaptability and absence
of con-
tinuity
are
no doubt
its outstanding
characteristics. Hence
it might
be
a
mistake
to assume
that
the
inconstancy
and
forgetfulness
of
the
masses
signify that they are cured of the totalitarian delusion, which
is occasionally
identified with the Hitler or Stalin cult; the opposite might well be true.
It would be
a
still more
serious mistake
to
forget, because
of
this Im-
permanence, that the totalitarian regimes, so long as they are in power, and
the totalitarian leaders, so long as they are
alive, "command and rest upoii
mass support" up to the end.'- Hitler's
rise to power was legal in terms of
majority
rule"* and neither he nor Stalin could have maintained the leader-
ship of large populations, survived many
interior and exterior
crises, and
braved the numerous dangers of relentless intra-party struggles
if they had
not had the confidence of the
masses. Neither the Moscow
trials nor
the
liquidation of the Rohm faction would have been possible
if these masses
had not supported Stalin and Hitler. The widespread belief that Hitler was
simply an agent of German
industrialists and that Stalin was victorious
in
the succession struggle after Lenin's death only through a sinister conspiracy
are both legends which can be refuted by many facts but above
all by the
leaders' indisputable popularity.'' Nor can their popularity be attributed Lo
the victory of masterful and lying propaganda over ignorance and stupidity.

A CLASSLESS SOCIETY
307
For the propaganda of totalitarian movements which precede and accom-
pany
totalitarian
regimes
is
invariably
as frank
as
it
is mendacious, and
would-be
totalitarian rulers
usually
start
their careers by boasting of
their
past crimes and carefully outlining their future ones. The Nazis "were con-
vinced that evil-doing in our time has a morbid force of attraction,"'' Bol-
shevik
assurances
inside
and
outside
Russia
that
they do
not
recognize
ordinary moral standards have become
a mainstay of Communist propa-
ganda, and experience has proved time and again that the propaganda value
of evil deeds and general contempt for moral standards
is independent of
mere
self-interest,
supposedly
the
most
powerful
psychological
factor
in
politics.
The attraction of evil and crime for the mob mentality
is nothing new.
It
has always been true
that the mob
will
greet "deeds of violence with the
admiring remark:
it may be mean but
it
is very clever."" The disturbing
factor in the success of totalitarianism
is
rather the
true
selflessness
of
its
adherents:
it may be understandable that a Nazi or Bolshevik
will not be
shaken
in
his conviction by crimes
against people who do
not belong
to
the movement or are even hostile to
it; but the amazing fact
is that neither
is he likely to waver when the monster begins
to devour
its own children
and not even
if he becomes a victim of persecution himself,
if he
is framed
and condemned,
if he
is purged from the party and sent to a forced-labor
or
a concentration camp. On
the
contrary,
to
the wonder
of
the
whole
civilized world, he may even be willing to help in his own prosecution and
frame his own death sentence
if only his status as a member of the move-
ment
is not touched.^
It would be naive
to consider
this stubbornness of
conviction which outlives
all
actual experiences and cancels
all immediate
self-interest
a
simple expression
of
fervent
idealism.
Idealism,
foolish
or
heroic,
always
springs from some
individual
decision and
conviction and
is subject to experience and argument.^ The fanaticism of totalitarian move-

^ This, to be
sure,
is a specialty of the
Russian brand of totalitarianism.
It
is
inter-
esting
to
note
that
in the early
trial of
foreign
engineers
in
the
Soviet Union, Com-
munist
sympathies
were
already
used
as
an
argument
for
self-accusation:

I was told:
'If you are
in favour of the Soviet Government, as
you
pretend
you
are,
prove
it
by
your
actions;
the Government
needs
your
con-
fession.' " Reported by Anton Ciliga, The Russian Enigma, London,
1940,
p.
153.
A
theoretical
justification
for
this
behavior was
given by
Trotsky: "We can only
be
right
with and
by
the
Party,
for
history
has provided no other way
of being
in
the
right. The
English
have
a
saying, 'My

or

.
.
. We have
much
better
historical
justification
in saying whether
it
is
right
or wrong
in
certain
individual concrete cases,
it
is my party" (Souvarine, op.
tit.,
p. 361).
On
the
other hand,
the Red Army
officers who
did
not
belong
to
the movement
had to be tried behind closed doors.
^ The Nazi author Andreas Pfenning explicitly
rejects
the
notion
that the SA were
fighting
for an
"ideal" or were prompted by an
"idealistic experience." Their "basic

ment
leaves
its
fanaticized
followers
in the
lurch,
killing
in them any
re-
maining conviction
that might have survived the collapse of the movement
itself." But within
the organizational framework
of the movement,
so long
as
it
holds
together,
the
fanaticized members can
be
reached by
neither
experience nor argument;
identification with
the movement and
total con-
formism seem to have destroyed the very capacity for experience, even
if
it be as extreme as torture or the fear of death.
The

all
Central and Eastern European countries (the Czech part of Czechoslovakia
was one of the notable exceptions); yet even Mussolini, who was so fond
of the term
"totalitarian
state,"
did not attempt to estabHsh

tion
center
(Hauptamt-Sihultingsanu)
of
the
SS,
it
is
quite
evident
that
the word
"idealism" has been studiously
avoided. Not
idealism was demanded of SS members,
but
"utter
logical
consistency
in
all questions of ideology and the
ruthless pursuit of
the

" In

equally

was
"the
fact
that

not

'to

that
this

unit
"after
the enormous
sacrifices
of
the
preceding
years, which
far
exceeded
the
proportionate losses of the Wehrmacht,
in the last few weeks acted like any unit drawn
from
the ranks of civilians, and bowed
to the hopelessness of the situation" (Karl O.

Similar
nontotalitarian
dictatorships
sprang up
in prewar Rumania,
Poland, the Baltic states, Hungary, Portugal and Franco Spain. The Nazis,
who had an unfailing instinct for such
differences, used to comment con-
temptuously on the shortcomings of their Fascist
allies while their genuine
admiration for the Bolshevik regime
in Russia
(and the Communist Party
in Germany) was matched and checked only by their contempt for Eastern
European races. ^^ The only man for whom Hitler had "unqualified respect"
was "Stalin the genius," ^^ and while in the case of Stalin and the Russian
over, were arrested and found innocent,
a procedure quite inconceivable under condi-
tions of Nazi
or Bolshevik
terror. See E. Kohn-Bramstedt,

Goebbels on
the
difference
between
Fascism
and
National
Socialism:
"[Fascism]
is
.
.
. nothing
like National Socialism. While the
latter goes deep down to the roots.
Fascism
is only a
superficial
thing" (The Goebbels Diaries 1942-1943,
ed.
by
Louis
Lochner, New York,
1948, p. 71). "[The Duce]
is not a revolutionary like the Fiihrer
or
Stalin. He
is so bound
to
his own
Italian people that he
lacks the broad
qualities
of a worldwide revolutionary and insurrectionist"
{ibid.,
p. 468).
Himmler expressed the same opinion
in a speech delivered
in
1943
at a Conference
of Commanding
Officers:
"Fascism
and
National
Socialism
are
two
fundamentally
different
things,
.
.
. there
is absolutely no comparison between Fascism and National
Socialism
as
spiritual,
ideological
movements."

Hitler recognized in
the early twenties the
affinity between
the Nazi and the Com-
munist
movements:
"In
our movement
the two
extremes come
together:
the Com-
munists from
the Left and
the
officers and
the
students from
the
Right. These two
have always been
the most
active elements.
.
.
. The Communists were
the
idealists
of
Socialism.
.
.
." See
Heiden,
op.
cit.,
p.
147. Rohm,
the
chief of the SA,
only
repeated a current opinion when he wrote
in the
late twenties: "Many things are
be-
tween
us and
the Communists,
but we
respect
the
sincerity
of
their
conviction and
their willingness to bring sacrifices for their own cause, and
this unites us with them"
(Ernst Rohm, Die Geschichte eines Hochverrdters,
1933, Volksausgabe,
p. 273).
During the
last war, the Nazis more readily recognized the Russians as
their peers
than any other nation.
Hitler, speaking
in May,
1943,
at a conference of the Reichs-
leiter and Gauleiter, "began with the fact that in this war bourgeoisie and revolutionary
states
are
facing
each
other.
It
has
been
an
easy
thing
for
us
to
knock
out
the
bourgeois
states,
for they were
quite
inferior to
us
in
their upbringing and
attitude.
Countries with an ideology have an edge on
bourgois
states. ...
[In
the
East] we
met
an
opponent who
also
sponsors an
ideology, even though
a wrong
one.
.
.
."
(Goebbels Diaries,
p. 355).—This estimate was based on
ideological, not on military
considerations.
Gottfried
Neesse,
Partei
iind
Staat,
1936, gave
the
official
version of
the movement's
struggle
for power when he wrote:
"For us
the
united
front of the
system
extends from
the German
National
People's
Party
[i.e.,
the extreme
Right]
to the Social Democrats. The Communist Party was an enemy outside of the system.
During the
first months of 1933, therefore, when the doom of the system was already
sealed, we
still had to fight a decisive
battle against the Communist Party"
(p. 76).

not have (and presumably never
will have)
the
rich docu-
mentary material that
is available for Germany, we nevertheless know since
Khrushchev's speech before the Twentieth Party Congress that Stalin trusted
only one man and that was
Hitler.'^
The point
is
that
in
all these smaller European countries nontotalitarian
dictatorships were preceded by totalitarian movements, so
that
it appeared
that
totalitarianism was too ambitious an aim,
that although
it had served
well enough
to organize
the masses
until the movement
seized power,
the
absolute
size of the country then forced the would-be
totalitarian
ruler of
masses
into the more familiar patterns of class or party
dictatorship. The
truth
is that these countries simply did not control enough human material
to allow for total domination and
its inherent great
losses
in population.^"'
Without much hope for the conquest of more heavily populated
territories,
the tyrants in these small countries were forced into a certain old-fashioned
moderation
lest they
lose whatever people
they had
to
rule.
This
is
also
why Nazism, up to the outbreak of the war and
its expansion over Europe,
lagged so far behind
its Russian counterpart in consistency and ruthlessness;
even
the German people were not numerous enough
to allow for the
full
development of this newest form of government. Only
if Germany had won
the war would she have known a fully developed totalitarian rulership, and
the sacrifices
this would have entailed not only for the "inferior races" but
for the Germans themselves can be gleaned and evaluated from the legacy of
Hitler's plans.'" In any event
it was only during the war, after the conquests
'*We now
know
that
Stalin
was
warned
repeatedly
of
the
imminent
attack
of
Hitler on the Soviet Union. Even when the Soviet military attache
in
Berlin informed
him
of the day of the Nazi
attack,
Stalin refused
to believe that Hitler would violate
the
treaty.

in the East furnished large masses of people and made the extermination
camps possible, that Germany was able to establish a truly totalitarian
rule.
(Conversely, the chances for totalitarian rule are frighteningly good
in the
lands
of
traditional
Oriental despotism,
in
India and
China, where
there
is almost inexhaustible material to feed the power-accumulating and man-
destroying machinery of total domination, and where, moreover, the mass
man's
typical feeling of superfluousness—an
entirely new phenomenon
in
Europe, the concomitant of mass unemployment and the population growth
of the last 150 years—has been prevalent for centuries in the contempt for
the value of human
life.)
Moderation or
less murderous methods of
rule
were hardly attributable to the governments' fear of popular rebellion; de-
population
in
their own country was
a much more
serious
threat.
Only
where
great masses
are
superfluous
or can be
spared without
disastrous
results of depopulation is totalitarian rule, as distinguished from a totalitarian
movement,
at
all possible.
Totalitarian movements are possible wherever there are masses who for
one reason or another have acquired the appetite for political organization.
Masses are not held together by a consciousness of common interest and they
lack
that
specific
class
articulateness
which
is
expressed
in
determined,
limited, and obtainable goals. The term masses applies only where we deal
with people who
either because
of
sheer numbers,
or
indifference,
or
a
combination of both, cannot be integrated into any organization Jbased on
common
interest,
into
political
parties or municipal governments or pro-
fessional organizations or trade unions. Potentially, they exist in every coun-
try and form
the
majority
of those
large numbers
of
neutral,
politically
indifferent people who never join a party and hardly ever go to the
polls.
It was characteristic of the
rise of the Nazi movement
in Germany and
of the Communist movements
in Europe
after
1930^''
that they
recruited
their members from
this mass of apparently
indifferent people whom
all
other parties had given up
as too
apathetic or too stupid
for
their
atten-
tion. The
result was
that
the
majority
of
their membership
consisted
of
means of which
the
"institutional
authority"
of
the poUce—namely,
to
ship persons
innocent of any
offenses to concentration camps—was
to be
legalized and expanded.
(See
Paul
Werner,
SS-Standartenfiihrer,
in
Deiitsches
Jiigendrecht,

4,
1944.)
In connection with
this "negative population policy." which
in
its aim
at extermina-
tion decidedly matches the
Bolshevist party
purges,
it
is important to remember
that
"in
this process of selection
there can
never be
a
standstill" (Himmler, "Die Schutz-
staffel,"
in
Grundlagen,
Aiifhau
und
Wirtschaftsordniing
des
nationalsozialistischen
Staates, No. 7b). "The struggle of the Fuehrer and his party was a hitherto unattained
selection.
.
.
. This selection and this struggle were ostensibly accomplished on January
30,
1933.
.
.
. The Fuehrer and
his
old guard knew
that

describes
the
situation
correctly:
"The Communists had only very
modest
successes when they
tried
to win
influence among the masses of the working
class;
their mass
basis,
therefore,
if they had
it
at
all, moved more and more away
from the proletariat" ("Die neue Komintern," in Der Monat, Berlin, 1949, Heft 4).

^/•>
TOTALITARIANISM
people who
never
before had appeared on
the
political
scene.
This
per-
mitted the introduction of entirely new methods
into
political propaganda,
and
indifference
to
the
arguments
of
political
opponents;
these
move-
ments not only placed themselves outside and
against the
party system
as
a
whole,
they
found
a membership
that had
never been
reached,
never
been "spoiled" by the party system. Therefore they did not need to refute
opposing
arguments
and
consistently
preferred
methods
which
ended
in
death
rather than
persuasion, which
spelled
terror
rather than conviction.
They
presented
disagreements
as
invariably
originating
in
deep
natural,
social,
or
psychological sources beyond
the
control
of the
individual and
therefore beyond the power of reason. This would have been a shortcoming
only
if
they
had
sincerely
entered
into
competition
with
other
parties;
it was not
if they were sure of dealing with people who had reason to be
equally
hostile to
all
parties.
The success of totalitarian movements among the masses meant the end
of two
illusions of democratically
ruled countries
in general and of Euro-
pean
nation-states and
their party system
in particular. The
first was
that
the people
in
its majority had taken an active part in government and that
each individual was
in sympathy with one's own or somebody else's party.
On
the
contrary,
the movements showed
that
the
politically
neutral and
indifferent masses
could
easily be
the
majority
in
a
democratically
ruled
country,
that
therefore
a
democracy
could
function
according
to
rules
which
are
actively recognized by only a minority. The second democratic
illusion exploded by
the
totalitarian movements was
that
these
politically
indifferent masses did not matter, that they were
truly neutral and consti-
tuted no more than
the
inarticulate backward
setting for the
political
life
of
the
nation. Now
they made
apparent what no
other organ
of
public
opinion had ever been able
to show, namely, that democratic government
had rested as much on the silent approbation and tolerance of the indifferent
and
inarticulate
sections of the people
as on
the
articulate and
visible
in-
stitutions
and
organizations
of
the
country.
Thus when
the
totalitarian
movements invaded Parliament with
their contempt for parliamentary gov-
ernment,
they
merely
appeared
inconsistent:
actually,
they
succeeded
in
convincing the people
at large that parliamentary majorities were spurious
and did not necessarily correspond to the
realities of the country, thereby
undermining
the
self-respect
and
the
confidence
of
governments
which
also believed
in majority
rule rather than
in their constitutions.
It has frequently been pointed out
that
totalitarian movements use and
abuse democratic freedoms
in order to abolish them. This
is not just devil-
ish cleverness on the part of the leaders or childish
stupidity on the part
of the masses. Democratic freedoms may be based on the
equality of
all
citizens
before
the
law;
yet
they
acquire
their
meaning
and
function
organically only where the citizens belong to and are represented by groups
or form
a
social and
political hierarchy. The breakdown of the
class
sys-
tem, the only social and political stratification of the European nation-states,

A CLASSLESS SOCIETY

certainly was "one of the most dramatic events in recent German history" ^^
and as favorable
to the
rise of Nazism
as the absence of
social
stratifica-
tion in Russia's immense rural population
(this "great flaccid body destitute
of
political
education,
almost
inaccessible
to
ideas
capable
of
ennobling
action"^'*)
was
to
the
Bolshevik
overthrow
of
the
democratic Kerensky
government. Conditions in pre-Hitler Germany are indicative of the dangers
implicit in the development of the Western
part of the world
since,
with
the end of the second World War, the same dramatic event of a breakdown
of the class system repeated
itself in almost
all European countries, while
events
in Russia clearly indicate the direction which the inevitable revolu-
tionary changes
in Asia may take.
Practically speaking,
it
will make
little
difference whether totalitarian movements adopt the pattern of Nazism or
Bolshevism,
organize
the
masses
in
the name
of
race
or
class,
pretend
to follow the laws of life and nature or of dialectics and economics.
Indifference to public
affairs, neutrality on political
issues,
are
in them-
selves no sufficient cause for the
rise of totalitarian movements. The com-
petitive
and
acquisitive
society
of
the
bourgeoisie had produced
apathy
and even
hostility toward public
life not
only, and not even primarily,
in
the social strata which were exploited and excluded from active participa-
tion in the
rule of the country, but
first of
all
in
its own
class. The long
period of false modesty, when the bourgeoisie was content with being the
dominating class in society without aspiring to political rule, which
it gladly
left to the
aristocracy, was followed by the
imperialist
era,
during which
the bourgeoisie grew increasingly hostile to existing national institutions and
began to claim and
to organize
itself for the
exercise
of
political power.
Both
the
early
apathy and
the
later demand
for monopolistic
dictatorial
direction of the nation's foreign affairs had their roots in a way and philoso-
phy of
life so
insistently and exclusively centered on the
individual's
suc-
cess or failure in ruthless competition that a citizen's duties and responsibili-
ties
could
only
be
felt
to
be
a
needless
drain on
his
limited
time
and
energy. These bourgeois
attitudes
are very useful for those forms
of
dic-
tatorship
in which
a
"strong man"
takes upon
himself
the
troublesome
responsibility for the conduct of public affairs; they are a positive hindrance
to
totalitarian movements which can
tolerate
bourgeois
individualism no
more than any
other kind
of
individualism. The
apathetic
sections
of
a
bourgeois-dominated
society,
no
matter how
unwilling
they may
be
to
assume
the
responsibilities
of
citizens,
keep
their
personalities
intact
if
only because without them they could hardly expect
to
survive
the com-
petitive struggle for
life.
The
decisive
differences between
nineteenth-century mob
organizations
and twentieth-century mass movements are difficult to perceive because the
modern totalitarian leaders do not differ much in psychology and mentality
from the earlier mob leaders, whose moral standards and
political devices
so closely resembled those of the bourgeoisie. Yet, insofar as individualism

TOTALITARIANISM
characterized
the
bourgeoisie's
as
well
as
the mob's
attitude
to
life,
the
totalitarian
movements
can
rightly
claim
that
they
were
the
first
truly
antibourgcois parties; none of their nineteenth-century predecessors, neither
the
ScKicty
of
the
1 0th
of December which
helped Louis Napoleon
into
pt>wcr, the butcher brigades of the Dreyfus
Affair, the Black Hundreds of
the Russian pogroms, nor the pan-movements, ever involved their members
to the point of complete loss of individual claims and ambition, or had ever
realized
that
an
organization
could
succeed
in
extinguishing
individual
identity permanently and not just for the moment of collective heroic action.
The
relationship between the bourgeois-dominated class
society and the
masses which emerged from
its breakdown
is not the same as the relation-
ship between the bourgeoisie and the mob which was a by-product of capi-
talist production. The masses share with the mob only one
characteristic,
namely, that both stand outside
all social ramifications and normal
political
representation. The masses do
not
inherit,
as
the mob does—albeit
in
a
perverted form—the
standards and
attitudes
of the dominating
class,
but
reflect
and somehow
pervert
the
standards
and
attitudes
toward
public
affairs of
all
classes. The standards of the mass man were determined not
only and
not even
primarily by
the
specific
class
to which he had once
belonged, but rather by all-pervasive influences and convictions which were
tacitly and inarticulately shared by
all classes of society alike.
Membership in a class, although looser and never as inevitably determined
by social origin as in the orders and estates of feudal society, was generally
by birth, and only extraordinary gifts or luck could change
it. Social status
was decisive for the individual's participation in politics, and except in cases
of
national emergency when he was supposed
to
act
only
as
a
national,
regardless
of
his
class
or
party membership,
he
never was
directly
con-
fronted with public affairs or felt directly responsible for their conduct. The
rise of a class to greater importance in the community was always accom-
panied by the education and training of a certain number of
its members
for
politics
as a job, for paid
(or,
if they could
afford
it, unpaid)
service
in
the government and
representation of the
class
in Parliament. That the
majority of people remained outside
all party or other political organization
was
not important
to
anyone, and no
truer for one
particular
class than
another.
In other words, membership
in a
class,
its
limited group
obliga-
tions and
traditional
attitudes toward
government,
prevented
the
growth
of a citizenry that
felt individually and personally responsible
for the
rule
of
the country. This
apolitical
character
of
the
nation-state's
populations
came
to
light only when the
class system broke down and carried with
it
the whole
fabric of
visible and
invisible
threads which bound
the people
to the body politic.
The breakdown of the class system meant automatically the breakdown
of
the
party
system,
chiefly
because
these
parties,
being
interest
parties,
could no longer represent
class
interests.
Their continuance was of some
importance
to the members of former classes who hoped
against hope
to
regain their old social status and who stuck together not because they had

A CLASSLESS SOCIETY
3]5
common interests any longer but because they hoped to restore them. The
parties, consequently, became more and more psychological and ideological
in their propaganda, more and more apologetic and nostalgic in their polit-
ical approach. They had
lost, moreover, without being aware of
it, those
neutral supporters who had never been interested
in
politics because they
felt
that
parties
existed
to
take
care
of
their
interests.
So
that
the
first
signs
of
the
breakdown
of
the
Continental
party
system
were
not
the
desertion of old party members, but the
failure
to
recruit members from
the younger generation, and the loss of the silent consent and support of the
unorganized masses who suddenly
shed
their apathy and went
wherever
they saw an opportunity to voice their new violent opposition.
The
fall of protecting class walls transformed the slumbering majorities
behind
all parties into one great unorganized, structureless mass of furious
individuals who had nothing
in common except
their vague
apprehension
that
the
hopes
of
party members
were doomed,
that,
consequently,
the
most
respected,
articulate and
representative members
of
the community
were
fools
and
that
all
the
powers
that be
were
not
so much
evil
as
they were equally stupid and fraudulent.
It was of no great consequence for
the
birth
of
this new
terrifying
negative
solidarity
that
the unemployed
worker hated
the
status quo and
the powers
that be
in
the form
of
the
Social
Democratic
Party,
the
expropriated
small
property owner
in
the
form of a centrist or rightist party, and former members of the middle and
upper classes
in the form of the
traditional extreme
right. The number of
this mass of generally
dissatisfied and desperate men
increased
rapidly
in
Germany and Austria
after
the
first World War, when
inflation and un-
employment added to the disrupting consequences of military defeat; they
existed in great proportion in
all the succession states, and they have sup-
ported
the
extreme
movements
in
France
and
Italy
since
the
second
World War.
In
this atmosphere of the breakdown of class society the psychology of
the European mass man
developed. The
fact
that
with monotonous
but
abstract
uniformity the same
fate had
befallen
a mass
of
individuals
did
not prevent
their judging themselves
in terms
of individual
failure or
the
world
in terms of specific
injustice. This
self-centered
bitterness, however,
although repeated again and again in individual isolation, was not a common
bond despite
its tendency to extinguish individual differences, because
it was
based on no common
interest, economic
or
social
or
political.
Self-cen-
teredness, therefore, went hand
in hand with a
decisive weakening of the
instinct for self-preservation. Selflessness in the sense that oneself does not
matter,
the
feeling of being expendable, was no
longer
the expression of
individual idealism but a mass phenomenon. The old adage that the poor
and oppressed have nothing to lose but
their chains no longer applied to
the mass men, for they lost much more than the chains of misery when they
lost interest in their own well-being: the source of all the worries and cares
which make human
life troublesome and anguished was gone. Compared

Uf)
TOTALITARIANISM
with
their
nonmaterialism,
a
Christian monk
looks
like
a man absorbed
in worldly
affairs. Himmler, who knew so well the mentality of those whom
he organized, described not only his SS-men, but the large strata from which
he
recruited
them, when
he
said
they
were
not
interested
in
"everyday
problems"
but
only
"in
ideological
questions
of importance
for
decades
and centuries,
so
that the man
.
.
. knows he
is working for a great task
which occurs but once in 2,000 years." ^o The gigantic massing of individuals
produced
a
mentality
which,
like
Cecil Rhodes some
forty
years
before,
thought
in continents and
felt in centuries.
Eminent European scholars and statesmen had predicted, from the early
nineteenth century onward, the
rise of the mass man and the coming of a
mass
age. A whole
literature on mass behavior and mass psychology had
demonstrated and
popularized
the wisdom, so familiar
to the
ancients,
of
the
affinity
between democracy
and
dictatorship,
between mob
rule and
tyranny. They had prepared certain politically conscious and overconscious
sections of the Western educated worid for the emergence of demagogues,
for gullibility, superstition, and brutality. Yet, while
all these predictions in
a
sense came
true,
they
lost much
of
their
significance
in view
of
such
unexpected and unpredicted phenomena as the radical loss of self-interest,^!
the
cynical
or bored
indifference
in
the
face
of
death
or
other personal
catastrophes, the passionate inclination toward the most abstract notions as
guides for life, and the general contempt for even the most obvious rules of
common sense.
The masses, contrary to prediction, did not result from growing equality
of condition, from the spread of general education and
its inevitablejower-
ing of standards and popularization of content. (America, the classical land
of equality of condition and of general education with
all
its shortcomings,
knows
less
of the modern psychology
of masses than perhaps any other
country in the world.)
It soon became apparent that highly cultured people
were
particularly
attracted
to mass movements and
that,
generally,
highly
differentiated
individualism
and
sophistication
did
not
prevent,
indeed
sometimes encouraged, the self-abandonment into the mass for which mass
movements provided. Since the obvious fact that individualization and culti-
vation do not prevent the formation of mass attitudes was so unexpected,
it
has frequently been blamed upon the morbidity or nihilism of the modern
intelligentsia, upon
a supposedly
typical
intellectual
self-hatred, upon
the
spirit's
"hostility
to
life"
and
antagonism
to
vitality.
Yet,
the
much-
slandered
intellectuals
were
only
the
most
illustrative
example
and
the
most
articulate spokesmen
for a much more general phenomenon.

atomization and extreme
individualization preceded

which, much more
easily and
earlier than
they
did
the
sociable,
nonin-
diyidualistic members
of
the
traditional
parties,
attracted
the
completely
unorganized,
the
typical
"nonjoiners" who
for
individualistic
reasons
al-
ways had refused to recognize social links or obligations.
The truth
is that the masses grew out of the fragments of a highly atom-
ized society whose competitive structure and concomitant loneliness of the
individual had been held in check only through membership in a class. The
chief characteristic of the mass man
is not brutality and backwardness, but
his isolation and lack of normal social relationships. Coming from the class-
ridden society of the
nation-state, whose cracks had been cemented with
nationalistic sentiment,
it
is only natural that these masses, in the first help-
lessness of their new experience, have tended toward an especially violent
nationalism, to which mass leaders have yielded against their own instincts
and purposes for purely demagogic reasons. ^^
Neither
tribal nationalism nor
rebellious
nihilism
is
characteristic of or
ideologically appropriate to the masses
as they were to the mob. But
the
most gifted mass leaders of our time have
still risen from the mob rather
than from the masses. ^^ Hitler's biography reads like a textbook example in
this respect, and the point about Stalin
is that he comes from the conspira-
tory apparatus of the Bolshevik party with
its
specific mixture of outcasts
and
revolutionaries.
Hitler's
early
party,
almost
exclusively composed
of
misfits,
failures,
and
adventurers,
indeed
represented
the
"armed
bo-
hemians" ^^ who were only the reverse side of bourgeois society and whom,
consequently, the German bourgeoisie should have been
able
to use
suc-
cessfully
for
its own
purposes.
Actually,
the
bourgeoisie
was
as much
taken
in by the Nazis
as was the Rohm-Schleicher faction
in the Reichs-
wehr,
which
also
thought
that
Hitler, whom
they had
used
as
a
stool-
pigeon,
or the SA, which
they had used
for
militaristic propaganda and
paramilitary
training, would
act
as
their agents and help
in the establish-
ment of a military
dictatorship.^"* Both considered the Nazi movement

^^ The
founders
of
the
Nazi
party
referred
to
it
occasionally even
before
Hitler
took over as a "party of the Left." An incident which occurred after the parliamentary
elections
of
1932
is
also
interesting:
"Gregor
Strasser
bitterly
pointed
out
to
his
Leader
that before
the
elections
the National
Socialists
in
the Reichstag might have
formed a majority
with
the
Center; now
this
possibility was
ended,
the two parties
were
less
than
half
of parliament;
.
.
.
But
with
the Communists
they
still had
a
majority,
Hitler replied; no one can govern
against us" (Heiden,
op.
cit., pp. 94 and
495,
respectively).
^^ Compare
Carlton
J.
H.
Hayes,
op.
cit., who does
not
differentiate between
the
mob and
the
masses,
thinks
that
totalitarian
dictators "have come from
the masses
rather than from
the
classes."
^* This
is the
central
theory of K.
Heiden, whose analyses of the Nazi movement
are
still
outstanding. "From
the
wreckage
of dead
classes
arises
the new
class
of
intellectuals, and
at
the head march
the most
ruthless,
those with
the
least
to
lose,
hence
the
strongest:
the
armed
bohemians,
to whom war
is home
and
civil war
fatherland" (op.
cit., p.
100).
*^ The
plot
between
Reichswehr General
Schleicher and Rohm,
the
chief
of the
SA,
consisted
of
a
plan
to
bring
all
paramilitary
formations
under
the
military
authority of the Reichswehr, which
at once would have added millions to the German

their own
terms,
in
terms
of
the
political
philosophy
of the
mob,^"
and
overlooked
the
independent,
spontaneous
support
given
the
new
mob
leaders by masses as well as
the mob
leaders' genuine
talents for creating
new
forms
of
organization. The mob
as
leader
of
these
masses was
no
longer the
agent of the bourgeoisie or of anyone
else except
the
masses.
That
totalitarian movements depended
less on
the
structurelessness
of
a
mass
society
than on
the
specific
conditions
of an
atomized
and
in-
dividualized mass, can
best be seen
in a comparison of Nazism and Bol-
shevism
which
began
in
their
respective
countries
under
very
different
circumstances.
To
change
Lenin's
revolutionary
dictatorship
into
full
totalitarian
rule,
Stalin had
first to create
artificially
that atomized
society
which
had
been
prepared
for
the
Nazis
in Germany by
historical
cir-
cumstances.
The October Revolution's amazingly easy victory occurred
in a country
where a despotic and centralized bureaucracy governed a structureless mass
population which
neither the remnants of the
rural feudal orders nor
the
weak,
nascent
urban
capitalist
classes
had
organized. When
Lenin
said
that nowhere
in the world would
it have been so easy
to win power and
so
difficult to keep
it, he was aware not only of the weakness of the Rus-
sian
working
class,
but
of
anarchic
social
conditions
in
general,
which
favored sudden changes. Without
the
instincts
of
a mass
leader—he was
no orator and had a passion for public admission and analysis of
his own
errors, which
is against the rules of even ordinary demagogy—Lenin seized
at once upon
all the possible
differentiations,
social, national, professional,
that might bring some
structure
into
the population, and he seemed con-
vinced
that
in
such
stratification
lay
the
salvation
of
the
revolution. He
legalized the anarchic expropriation of the landowners by the rural masses
and established thereby for the
first and probably
last time
in Russia that
emancipated peasant
class which,
since
the French Revolution, had been
army.
This,
of course, would
inevitably have
led
to
a
military
dictatorship.
In June.
1934,
Hitler
liquidated Rohm
and
Schleicher. The
initial
negotiations
were
started
with
the
full knowledge of
Hitler who used Rohm's connections with
the Reichswehr
to
deceive German
military
circles
about
his
real
intentions.
In
April,
1932, Rohm
testified
in one
of
Hitler's
lawsuits
that
the SA's
military
status had
the
full
under-
standing of the Reichswehr. (For documentary evidence on the Rohm-Schleicher plan,
sec Nazi Conspiracy. V, 456
f[. See also Heiden, op.
cit.. p. 450.) Rohm himself proudly
reports
his negotiations with
Schleicher, which according
to him were started
in
1931.
Schleicher
had
promised
to
put
the SA
under
the command
of Reichswehr
ollicers
in
case
of
an
emergency.
(See
Die Memoiren
des
Stahschefs Rohm,
Saarbriicken,
1934,
p.
170.) The
militaristic character of the SA, shaped by Rohm and constantly
fought
by
Hitler,
continued
to
determine
its
vocabulary
even
after
the
liquidation
of
the Rohm
faction.
Contrary
to
the
SS,
the members
of
the SA
always
insisted
on
being
the
"representatives
of Germany's
military
will," and
for them
the Third
Reich was
a "military community [supported by] two
pillars:
Party and Wehrmacht"

A CLASSLESS SOCIETY

the firmest supporter of the Western
nation-states. He
tried to strengthen
the working
class by encouraging independent trade unions. He
tolerated
the timid appearance of a new middle
class which
resulted from the NEP
policy
after the end of the
civil war. He introduced further
distinguishing
features by organizing, and sometimes
inventing,
as many
nationalities
as
possible, furthering national consciousness and awareness of historical and
cultural
differences even among
the
most
primitive
tribes
in
the
Soviet
Union.
It seems clear that in these purely practical
political matters Lenin
followed his great
instincts for statesmanship rather than
his Marxist con-
victions; his policy,
at any rate, proves that he was more frightened by the
absence of social and other structure than by the possible development of
centrifugal
tendencies
in
the newly emancipated
nationalities
or even by
the growth of a new bourgeoisie out of the newly established middle and
peasant classes. There
is no doubt
that Lenin suffered
his
greatest defeat
when, with the outbreak of the
civil war, the supreme power that he orig-
inally planned to concentrate in the Soviets definitely passed into the hands
of the party bureaucracy; but even
this development,
tragic
as
it was for
the course of the revolution, would not necessarily have led to
totalitarian-
ism. A one-party
dictatorship added
only one more
class
to
the
already
developing
social
stratification
of
the
country,
i.e.,
bureaucracy,
which,
according to socialist
critics of the revolution, "possessed the State
as
pri-
vate property" (Marx).-^ At the moment of Lenin's death the roads were
still open. The formation of workers, peasants, and middle classes need not
necessarily have led to the
class
struggle which had been characteristic of
European capitalism. Agriculture could
still be developed on a
collective,
co-operative, or private
basis, and the
national economy was
still
free
to
follow
a
socialist,
state-capitalist,
or
a
free-enterprise
pattern. None
of
these
alternatives would
have
automatically
destroyed
the new
structure
of the country.
All these new classes and nationalities were in Stalin's way when he began
to prepare the country for totalitarian government. In order to fabricate an
atomized and structureless mass, he had
first to liquidate the remnants of
power in the Soviets which,
as the
chief organ of national representation,
still played a certain role and prevented absolute rule by the party hierarchy.
^' It
is well known
that the
anti-Stalinist
splinter groups have based
their
criticism
of
the
development
of
the
Soviet
Union
on
this
Marxist
formulation,
and
have
actually never outgrown
it. The repeated "purges" of Soviet bureaucracy, which were
tantamount
to
a
liquidation
of
bureaucracy
as
a
class,
have
never
prevented them
from
seeing
in
it the dominating and
ruling
class of the Soviet Union. The following
is
the
estimate
of Rakovsky,
writing
in
1930 from
his
exile
in
Siberia:
"Under our
eyes has formed and
is being formed a great class of directors which has
its internal
subdivisions and which
increases through
calculated
co-option and
direct
or
indirect
nominations.
.
.
. The element which unites this original class
is a form, also original,
of private property, to wit, the State power" (quoted from Souvarine, op.
cit.,
p. 564).
This
analysis
is
indeed
quite
accurate
for
the
development
of
the
pre-Stalinist
era.

development
of
the
relationship
between
party
and
Soviets,

TOTALITARIANISM
Therefore
he
first undermined
the
national
Soviets through
the
introduc-
tion
of Bolshevik
cells from which
alone
the
higher
functionaries
to
the
central committees
were
appointed.-^ By
1930,
the
last
traces
of former
communal
institutions had disappeared and had been replaced by a firmly
centralized
party bureaucracy whose tendencies toward
Russification were
not
too
different from
those
of
the
Czarist
regime,
except
that
the new
bureaucrats were no longer afraid of literacy.
The Bolshevik government then proceeded to the
liquidation of classes
and
started,
for
ideological
and
propaganda
reasons,
with
the
property-
owning classes, the new middle class
in the
cities, and the peasants in the
country. Because of the combination of numbers and property, the peasants
up to then had been potentially the most powerful class in the Union; their
liquidation, consequently, was more thorough and more cruel than that of
any other group and was carried through by
artificial famine and deporta-
tion under the
pretext of expropriation of the kulaks and
collectivization.
The
liquidation
of the
middle and
peasant
classes was completed
in the
early
thirties;
those who were
not among
the many
millions
of dead
or
the
millions of deported slave laborers had learned "who
is master here,"
had
realized
that
their
lives and
the
lives
of
their families depended not
upon their fellow-citizens but exclusively on
the whims of the government
which they faced
in complete loneliness without any help whatsoever from
the
group
to which
they happened
to
belong. The
exact moment when
collectivization
produced
a new
peasantry bound
by common
interests,
which owing
to
its numerical and economic key
position
in the country's
economy
again
presented
a
potential
danger
to
totalitarian
rule,
cannot
be determined either from
statistics or documentary sources. But for those
who know how
to
read
totalitarian
"source
material"
this moment had
come two years before
Stalin died, when he proposed to dissolve the col-
lectives and
transform them
into
larger
units. He
did
not
live
to
carry
out
this
plan;
this
time
the
sacrifices would have been
still
greater and
the
chaotic
consequences
for
the
total economy
still more
catastrophic
than
the
liquidation of the
first peasant
class,
but there
is no
reason
to
doubt
that
he
might
have
succeeded;
there
is
no
class
that
cannot
be
wiped out
if a
sufficient number of
its members
ar6 murdered.
The next class to be liquidated as a group were the workers. As a class
they were much weaker and offered much less resistance than the peasants
because their spontaneous expropriation of factory owners during the revo-
lution,
unlike
the
peasants'
expropriation of landowners, had been
frus-

A CLASSLESS SOCIETY

trated
at once by the government which
confiscated the
factories
as
state
property under the pretext that the
state belonged to the proletariat in any
event. The Stakhanov system, adopted
in the
early
thirties, broke up
all
solidarity and class consciousness among the workers,
first by the ferocious
competition and second by the temporary
solidification of
a Stakhanovite
aristocracy whose
social distance from the ordinary worker
naturally was
felt more acutely than the distance between the workers and the manage-
ment. This process was completed
in 1938
with
the
introduction
of
the
labor book which transformed
the whole
Russian worker
class
officially
into a gigantic forced-labor force.
On top of these measures came the liquidation of that bureaucracy which
had helped to carry out the previous
liquidation measures.
It took
Stalin
about two years, from 1936 to 1938, to rid himself of the whole adminis-
trative
and
military
aristocracy
of
the
Soviet
society;
nearly
all
offices,
factories, economic and
cultural
bodies,
government,
party,
and
military
bureaus came
into new hands, when
"nearly
half the
administrative
per-
sonnel, party and nonparty, had been swept out," and more than 50 per
cent of
all
party members and
"at
least
eight
million more" were
liqui-
dated.2^ Again the
introduction of an
interior
passport, on which
all de-
partures from one
city
to another have
to be
registered and
authorized,
completed the destruction of the party bureaucracy
as
a
class. As for
its
juridical
status,
the
bureaucracy
along
with
the
party
functionaries was
now on the same level with the workers;
it,
too, had now become
a part
of the vast multitude of Russian forced laborers and
its
status
as
a
privi-
leged class in Soviet society was a thing of the past. And since this general
purge ended with the liquidation of the highest police
officials—the same
who had organized the general purge in the
first place—not even the cadres
of the GPU which had carried out the terror could any longer delude them-
selves
that
as
a group they
represented
anything
at
all,
let
alone power.
None
of
these immense
sacrifices
in human
life was
motivated by
a
raison
d'etat
in the old sense of the term. None
of the
liquidated
social
strata was hostile to the regime or likely to become hostile in the foreseeable
future.
Active
organized
opposition had
ceased
to
exist by
1930 when
Stalin,
in his speech to the Sixteenth Party Congress, outlawed the
rightist
and
leftist
deviations
inside
the
Party, and even these
feeble
oppositions
had hardly been able to base themselves on any of the
existing
classes.^"

in the case ol Soviet Russia
we basically have nothing but questionable sources to resort to—meaning that we have
to
rely
altogether on news
stories,
reports and evaluations
of one kind or another
all we can do
is use whatever information
at
least appears to have
a high degree of
probability. Some
historians seem
to think
that
the opposite method—namely,
to use
exclusively whatever
material
is furnished by
the Russian government—is more
reli-
able, but
this
is
the
not

as
it
threatens only authentic opponents but not harmless citizens without
polit-
ical opinions—had been grim enough to suffocate
all
political
life, open or
clandestine,
even
before
Lenin's
death.
Intervention from
abroad,
which
might
ally
itself with one of the
dissatisfied sections
in the population, was
no longer a danger when, by
1930, the Soviet regime had been recognized
by
a majority of governments and concluded commercial and other
inter-
national
agreements
with many
countries.
(Nor
did
Stalin's government
eliminate
such
a
possibility
as
far
as
the
people
themselves
were
con-
cerned: we know now
that
Hitler,
if he had been an ordinary conqueror
and not
a
rival
totalitarian
ruler, might have had an extraordinary chance
to win
for
his cause
at
least the people of the Ukraine.)
If the liquidation of classes made no political sense,
it was positively dis-
astrous for the
Soviet economy. The consequences of the
artificial famine
in 1933 were
felt for years throughout the country; the introduction of the
Stakhanov system
in 1935, with
its arbitrary speed-up of individual output
and
its complete
disregard
of
the
necessities
for teamwork
in
industrial
production,
resulted
in a "chaotic imbalance" of the young industry. ^^ The
liquidation of the bureaucracy, that
is, of the class of factory managers and
engineers,
finally
deprived
industrial
enterprises
of what
little
experience
and know-how
the new Russian technical
intelligentsia had been
able
to
acquire.
Equality of condition among their subjects has been one of the foremost
concerns of despotisms and tyrannies since
ancient
times,
yet such equal-
ization
is not
sufficient for totalitarian
rule because
it leaves more or
less
intact certain
nonpolitical communal bonds between the
subjects,
such
as
family
ties and common
cultural
interests.
If totalitarianism takes
its own
claim seriously,
it must come to the point where
it has "to finish once and
for
all with the neutrality of chess," that
is, with the autonomous existence
of any
activity whatsoever. The
lovers
of "chess
for
the
sake
of
chess,"
aptly compared by their liquidator with the lovers of "art for art's sake,"^^
are not yet absolutely atomized elements in a mass society whose completely
heterogeneous uniformity
is one of the primary conditions for totalitarian-
ism. From
the
point
of view
of
totalitarian
rulers,
a
society devoted
to
chess for the sake of chess
is only
in degree
different and
less dangerous
than a class of farmers for the sake of farming. Himmler quite aptly defined

A CLASSLESS SOCIETY

Mass atomization
in Soviet
society was achieved by
the
skillful use of
repeated purges which invariably precede actual group liquidation. In order
to destroy all social and family ties, the purges are conducted in such a way
as to threaten with the same
fate the defendant and
all
his ordinary
rela-
tions, from mere acquaintances up to his closest friends and relatives. The
consequence of the simple and ingenious device of "guilt by association"
is
that as soon
as a man
is accused,
his former friends
are transformed im-
mediately into his
bitterest enemies;
in order to save their own
skins, they
volunteer information and
rush
in with
denunciations
to
corroborate
the
nonexistent evidence
against him;
this obviously
is the only way to prove
their own trustworthiness. Retrospectively, they will try to prove that their
acquaintance or friendship with the accused was only a pretext for spying
on him and revealing him as a saboteur,
a Trotskyite, a foreign spy, or a
Fascist. Merit being "gauged by the number of your denunciations of close
comrades," ^^
it
is obvious that the most elementary caution demands that
one avoid
all
intimate
contacts,
if
possible—not
in order
to
prevent
dis-
covery of one's secret thoughts, but rather to
eliminate,
in the almost cer-
tain case of future trouble, all persons who might have not only an ordinary
cheap interest in your denunciation but an
irresistible need to bring about
your ruin simply because they are
in danger of their own
lives. In the
last
analysis,
it has been through the development of this device to
its farthest
and most fantastic extremes
that Bolshevik
rulers have succeeded
in
cre-
ating an
atomized and
individualized
society
the
like
of which we
have
never seen before and which
events
or
catastrophes
alone would
hardly
have brought
about.
Totalitarian movements
are
mass
organizations
of
atomized,
isolated
individuals . Compared with
all
other
parties and movements,
their most
conspicuous external
characteristic
is
their demand for
total,
unrestricted,
unconditioiial, and unalterable loyalty
of the
individual member. This de-
mand
is made by the
leaders of
totalitarian movements even before they
seize power.
It usually precedes the total organization of the country under
their actual rule and
it follows from the claim of their ideologies that their
organization will encompass,
in due course, the entire human race. Where,
however, totalitarian rule has not been prepared by a totalitarian movement
(and
this,
in contradistinction to Nazi Germany, was the case
in Russia),
the movement has
to
be
organized
afterward and
the
conditions
for
its
growth have
artificially
to be created
in order to make
total
loyalty—the
psychological basis for total domination—at
all possible. Such
loyalty can
be_expected only from the completely isolated human being who, without
any other social
ties
to family,
friends, comrades, or even mere
acquaint-
for internal consumption emphasize time and again "the absolute necessity for under-
standing
the
futility of everything
that
is an end
in
itself"
(see Der Reichsfiihrer SS
iind Chef der deutschen
Polizei,
undated, "only
for
internal
use
within the police").
^^ The
practice
itself has been abundantly documented. W.
Krivitsky,
in
his book
In Stalin's Secret Services (New York, 1939), traces
it directly to Stalin.

Hitler's
greatest achievement
in
the organization of the Nazi movement, which he
gradually
built
up from
the obscure
crackpot membership
of
a
typically
nationalistic
little
party, was
that
he
unburdened
the
movement
of
the
party's
earlier
program,
not
by
changing
or
officially
abolishing
it,
but
simply
by
refusing
to
talk
about
it
or
discuss
its
points, whose
relative
moderateness of content and phraseology were very soon
outdated.^"'
Stal-
in's task
in this as in other respects was much more formidable; the socialist
program of
the
Bolshevik
party was
a much more troublesome burden^*
than
the 25
points
of an amateur economist
and
a
crackpot
politician.^''
But
Stalin achieved
eventually,
after having abolished the
factions
of the
Russian party, the same
result through the constant zigzag of the Commu-
nist Party
lines, and the constant reinterpretation and application of Marx-
ism which voided
the doctrine of
all
its content because
it was no longer
possible
to
predict
what course
or
action
it would
inspire. The
fact
that
the most perfect education
in Marxism and Leninism was no guide whatso-
ever
for
political
behavior—that, on
the
contrary,
one
could
follow
the
party
line only
if one
repeated each morning what
Stalin had announced

resulted
in
the same

the same

A CLASSLESS SOCIETY
325
Lack of or ignoring of a party program
is by itself not necessarily a sign
of totalitarianism. The
first to consider programs and platforms as needless
scraps of paper and embarrassing promises, inconsistent with the style and
impetus of a movement, was Mussolini with
his Fascist philosophy of ac-
tivism and inspiration through the historical moment
itselif.^'^ Mere lust for
power combined
with contempt
for
"talkative"
articulation
of what
they
intend to do with
it
is characteristic of
all mob leaders, but does not come
up to the standards of totalitarianism. The true goal of Fascism was only
to
seize power and establish
the Fascist
"elite"
as uncontested
ruler over
the
country.
Totalitarianism
is never content
to
rule by
external means,
namely,
through
the
state
and
a
machinery
of
violence;
thanks
to
its
peculiar ideology and the
role assigned to
it in this apparatus of coercion,
totalitarianism has discovered
a means
of dominating and
terrorizing hu-
man beings from
within.
In
this sense
it eliminates
the
distance between
the rulers and the ruled and achieves a condition in which power and the
will to power, as we understand them, play no role, or at best, a secondary
role. In substance, the totalitarian leader
is nothing more nor less than the
functionary
of the masses he
leads; he
is
not
a power-hungry
individual
imposing a tyrannical and
arbitrary
will upon
his
subjects. Being
a mere
functionary, he can be replaced at any time, and he depends
just as much
on the
"will"
of
the masses he embodies
as
the masses depend on him.
Without him they would lack external representation and remain an amor-
phous horde; without the masses the leader
is a nonentity. Hitler, who was
fully
aware
of
this
interdependence,
expressed
it
once
in
a
speech
ad-
dressed to the SA:
"All that you
are, you are through me;
all that
I am,
I am through you alone." ^'^ We are only too inclined to
belittle such state-
ments or
to misunderstand them
in
the
sense
that
acting
is
defined here
in terms of giving and executing orders,
as has happened too often in the
political tradition and history of the West.^^ But this idea has always pre-
supposed someone
in command who
thinks and
wills, and then imposes
his thought and will on a thought- and will-deprived group—be
it by per-
suasion,
authority,
or violence.
Hitler, however, was
of
the
opinion
that
even "thinking

.
[exists] only by virtue of giving or executing orders,"*^
faithfulness.
Nazi
Conspiracy,
whose
translations
of German
documents
and
Nazi
literature are indispensable source material but, unfortunately, are very uneven, renders
the SS watchword: "My honor signifies faithfulness" (V, 346).
^^ Mussolini was probably
the
first party leader who consciously
rejected a formal
program and
replaced
it
with
inspired
leadership and
action
alone.
Behind
this
act
lay the notion that the actuality of the moment itself was the chief element of inspira-
tion, which would only
be hampered by
a party program. The philosophy of Italian
Fascism has been expressed by Gentile's "actualism"
rather than by
Sorel's "myths."
Compare
also
the
article "Fascism"
in
the Encyclopedia
of
the Social Sciences. The
Program of 1921 was formulated when the movement had been in existence two years
and contained, for the most
part,
its nationalist philosophy.

and thereby eliminated even
theoretically
the
distinction between thinking
and acting on one hand, and between the rulers and the ruled on the other.
Neither National
Socialism nor Bolshevism
has ever
proclaimed
a new
form of government or asserted that
its goals were reached with the seizure
of power and the control of the
state machinery. Their idea of domination
was something
that no
state and no mere
apparatus of violence can ever
achieve,
but
only
a movement
that
is
constantly
kept
in motion:
namely,
the
j^rrmanent
domination
of
each
single
individual
in
each
and
every
sphere of life.^' The seizure of power through the means of violence
is never
an end
in
itself but only the means to an end, and the seizure of power in
any given country
is only a welcome transitory stage but never the end of
the movement. The
practical goal of the movement
is to organize as mariy
pciiplc
as
possible
within
its
framework
and
to
set
and
keep
them
in
motion;
a
political
goal
that would
constitute
the end
of
the movement
simply does not
exist.
II:
The Temporary Alliance Between the Mob and the Elite
WHAT
IS MORE
disturbing
to our
peace
of mind
than
the
unconditional
loyalty of members
of totalitarian movements, and the popular support of
totalitarian regimes,
is the unquestionable attraction these movements exert
on the elite, and not only on the mob elements in society.
It would be rash
indeed
to
discount,
because
of
artistic
vagaries
or
scholarly
naivete,
the
terrifying roster of distinguished men whom totalitarianism can count among
its sympathizers, fellow-travelers, and inscribed party members.
This attraction for the elite
is as important a clue to the understanding of
totalitarian movements
(though
hardly
of
totalitarian
regimes)
as
their
more obvious connection with the mob.
It indicates the specific atmosphere,
the general climate in which the
rise of totalitarianism takes place.
It should
be remembered
that
the leaders of totalitarian movements and
their sym-
pathizers arc, so to speak, older than the masses which they organize so that
chronologically speaking the masses do not have to wait helplessly for the
rise of their own leaders
in the midst of a decaying class society, of which
they
are
the most outstanding product. Those who voluntarily
left
society
before the wreckage of classes had come about, along with the mob, which
was an
earlier by-product
of
the
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie,
stand
ready
to
welcome them. The present totalitarian rulers and the leaders of totalitarian
movements
still bear the characteristic traits of the mob, whose psychology

and political philosophy
are
fairly well known; what
will happen once the
authentic mass man takes over, we do not know
yet, although
it may be
a fair guess that he
will have more
in common with
the
meticulous,
cal-
culated correctness of Himmler than with the hysterical fanaticism of Hitler,
will more resemble the stubborn dullness of Molotov than the sensual vin-
dictive cruelty of Stalin.
In this respect, the situation after the second World War in Europe does
not
differ
essentially from
that
after the
first;
just
as
in
the
twenties
the
ideologies
of Fascism, Bolshevism, and Nazism were formulated and
the
movements
led by the so-called
front generation, by those who had been
brought up and
still remembered distinctly the times before the war, so the
present general
political and
intellectual climate of postwar totalitarianism
is being determined by
a generation which knew
intimately
the time and
life which preceded the present. This
is
specifically true for France, where
the breakdown of the class system came after the second instead of after the
first War. Like the mob men and the adventurers of the imperialist era, the
leaders of totalitarian movements have
in common with
their
intellectual
sympathizers the fact that both had been outside the class and national sys-
tem of respectable European society even before
this system broke down.
This breakdown, when the smugness of spurious respectability gave way
to anarchic despair, seemed the first great opportunity for the elite as well as
the mob. This
is obvious for the new mass leaders whose careers reproduce
the features of earlier mob leaders:
failure
in professional and
social
life,
perversion and disaster in private
life. The fact that their lives prior to their
political careers had been failures, naively held against them by the more
respectable leaders of the old parties, was the strongest factor in their mass
appeal.
It seemed to prove that individually they embodied the mass destiny
of the time and that their desire to
sacrifice everything for the movement,
their assurance of devotion to those who had been struck by catastrophe,
their determination never to be tempted back
into
the
security of normal
life, and their contempt for
respectability were
quite
sincere and not
just
inspired by passing ambitions.
The postwar elite, on the other hand, was only
slightly younger than the
generation which had
let
itself be used and abused by imperiaUsm for the
sake of glorious careers outside of respectability, as gamblers and spies and
adventurers,
as knights
in shining armor and
dragon-killers. They shared
with Lawrence of Arabia
the
yearning
for
"losing
their
selves" and
the
violent disgust with
all existing standards, with every power that be.
If they
still remembered the "golden age of security," they
also remembered how
they had hated
it and how real their enthusiasm had been
at the outbreak
of the
first World War. Not only Hitler and not only the failures thanked
God on their knees when mobilization swept Europe
in
1914.^^ They did
not even have
to reproach themselves with having been an easy prey for

(Ernst
Jiinger).
In
the
carefully chosen words
of
Thom.is Mann, war was "chastisement" and
"purification"; "war
in
itself,
rather than victories, inspired the poet." Or in the words of a student of the
lime, "what counts
is always the readiness to make a sacrifice, not the object
for which
the
sacrifice
is made"; or
in
the words of
a young worker,
"it
doesn't matter whether one
lives a few years longer or not. One would like
to have something to show for one's life."^'' And long before one of Nazism's
intellectual
sympathizers
announced, "When

drau my

pt>ets had proclaimed
their disgust with "rubbish
cul-
ture" and called
poetically on "ye Barbarians, Scythians, Negroes,
Indians,
to trample

Simply
to brand
as outbursts of nihilism
this violent dissatisfaction with
the prewar
age
and
subsequent
attempts
at
restoring
it
(from
Nietzsche
and Sorcl
to Pareto. from Rimbaud and T. E. Lawrence to Jiinger, Brecht,
and Malraux. from Bakunin and Nechayev to Alexander Blok)
is to over-
look how
justified
disgust can be
in
a
society wholly permeated with the
ideological outlook and moral standards
of the bourgeoisie. Yet
it
is
also
true
that
the
"front generation,"
in marked
contrast
to
their own chosen
spiritual
fathers, were completely absorbed by
their desire to see the
ruin
of this whole world of fake security, fake culture, and fake
life. This desire
was
so
great
that
it
outweighed
in
impact
and
articulateness
all
earlier
attempts
at a "transformation of values," such as Nietzsche had attempted,
or a reorganization of political
life as indicated
in Sorel's writings, or a
re-
vival of human authenticity
in Bakunin, or a passionate love of
life in the
purity
of exotic
adventures
in Rimbaud.
Destruction
without
mitigation,
chaos and ruin as such assumed the dignity of supreme values. ^^
The genuineness of these feelings can be seen
in the
fact that very few
of this generation were cured of their war enthusiasm by
actual experience
of
its horrors. The survivors of the trenches did not become pacifists. They
cherished an experience which, they thought, might serve to separate them

definitely from the hated surroundings of respectability. They clung to their
memories of four years of life in the trenches as though they constituted an
objective criterion for the establishment of a new
elite. Nor did they yield
to the temptation to
idealize
this
past; on the contrary, the worshipers of
war were the first to concede that war in the era of machines could not pos-
sibly breed
virtues
like
chivalry, courage,
honor, and
manliness,*^
that
it
imposed on men nothing but the
experience
of bare
destruction
together
with
the
humiliation
of being
only
small
cogs
in
the
majestic
wheel
of
slaughter.
This generation remembered the war as the great prelude to the break-
down of classes and their transformation into masses. War, with its constant
murderous
arbitrariness, became
the symbol
for
death,
the
"great
equal-
izer"
•*•' and therefore the true father of a new world order. The passion for
equality and justice, the longing to transcend narrow and meaningless class
lines, to abandon stupid privileges and prejudices, seemed to find in war a
way out of the old condescending
attitudes of
pity
for the oppressed and
disinherited. In times of growing misery and individual helplessness,
it seems
as difficult to resist pity when
it grows into an all-devouring passion as
it is
not to resent
its very boundlessness, which seems to
kill human dignity with
a more deadly certainty than misery
itself.
In the early years of his career, when a restoration of the European status
quo was
still the most serious threat to the ambitions of the mob,^° Hitler
appealed almost exclusively to these sentiments of the front generation. The
peculiar selflessness of the mass man appeared here as yearning for anonym-
ity, for being just a number and functioning only as a cog, for every trans-
formation,
in brief, which would wipe out the spurious identifications with
specific types or predetermined functions within society. War had been ex-
perienced as that "mightiest of all mass actions" which obliterated individual
differences so
that even
suffering, which
traditionally had marked
off
in-
dividuals through unique unexchangeable destinies, could now be interpreted
as "an instrument
of
historical progress." ^^ Nor did
national
distinctions
limit the masses into which the postwar
elite wished to be immersed. The
first World War, somewhat paradoxically, had almost extinguished genuine
national feelings in Europe where, between the wars,
it was far more im-
portant to have belonged to the generation of the trenches, no matter on
which side, than to be a German or a Frenchman.^^ The Nazis based their

shows how
consistently
Hitler
sided
with
catastrophe
in
the
early days of the movement, how he feared
a possible recovery of Germany. "Half a

in
different terms, he declared to
his storm

the
ranks
of
the
so-called
Right,
which
used
them
for
their connotation
of violence rather than for
their specific national content.
No single element
in
this general
intellectual climate
in postwar Europe
was vers new. Bakunin had already confessed, "I do not want to be
/,
I want
to be HV."'^ and Nechayev had preached the evangel of the "doomed man"
with "no
personal
interests, no
affairs, no
sentiments,
attachments,
prop-
erty,
not even
a name
of
his
own."'"'^ The
antihumanist,
antiliberal,
anti-
individualist, and anticultural
instincts of the front generation, their brilliant
and wittv praise of violence, power, and cruelty, was preceded by the awk-
ward and pompous "scientific" proofs of the imperialist elite that a struggle
of all against
all
is the law of the universe, that expansion
is a psychological
necessity before
it
is a political device, and that man has to behave by such
universal
laws.'' What was new
in the writings of the front generation was
their high literary standard and great depth of passion. The postwar writers
no longer needed
the
scientific demonstrations of genetics, and they made
little
if any
use
of
the
collected works
of Gobineau or Houston
Stewart
Chamberlain,
which
belonged
already
to
the
cultural
household
of
the
Philistines. They read not Darwin but the Marquis de Sade.-"'" If they believed
at
all
in universal
laws, they certainly did not particularly care to conform
to them. To them, violence, power, cruelty, were the supreme capacities of
men who had definitely
lost their place
in the universe and were much too
proud to long for a power theory that would safely bring them back and re-

integrate them into the world. They were
satisfied with bUnd
partisanship
in anything that respectable society had banned, regardless of theory or con-
tent, and they elevated
cruelty
to
a major
virtue because
it
contradicted
society's humanitarian and
liberal hypocrisy.
If we compare
this
generation
with
the
nineteenth-century
ideologists,
with whose theories they sometimes seem to have so much in common, their
chief distinction
is
their greater
authenticity and
passion. They had been
more deeply touched by misery, they were more concerned with
the
per-
plexities and more deadly hurt by hypocrisy than all the apostles of good will
and brotherhood had been. And they could no
longer escape
into
exotic
lands, could no longer afford to be dragon-slayers among strange and excit-
ing people. There was no escape from the daily routine of misery, meekness,
frustration, and resentment embellished by a fake culture of educated talk;
no conformity to the customs of fairy-tale lands could possibly save them
from the rising nausea that this combination continuously inspired.
This inability to escape into the wide world,
this feeling of being caught
again and again in the trappings of society—so different from the conditions
which had formed the
imperialist character—added
a constant
strain and
the yearning for
violence
to
the
older passion
for anonymity and
losing
oneself. Without the
possibility of a radical change of role and character,
such as the identification with the Arab national movement or the rites of an
Indian village,
the
self-willed immersion
in the suprahuman forces of de-
struction seemed
to be
a salvation from the automatic
identification with
pre-established functions in society and their utter banality, and at the same
time to help destroy the functioning itself. These people felt attracted to the
pronounced activism of
totalitarian movements,
to
their curious and only
seemingly contradictory insistence on both the primacy of sheer action and
the overwhelming force of sheer necessity. This mixture corresponded pre-
cisely to the war experience of the "front generation," to the experience of
constant activity within the framework of overwhelming fatality.
Activism,
rnoreover,
seemed
to
provide new
answers
to
the
old
and
trouBlesorne question, "Who am
I?" which always appears with redoubled
persistence in times of crisis.
If society insisted, "You are what you appear
to be," postwar activism replied: "You are what you have done"—for
in-
stance, the man who for the
first time had crossed the
Atlantic
in an
air-
plane (as in Brecht's Der Plug der Lindberghs)—an answer which after the
second World War was repeated and
slightly varied by
Sartre's "You
are
your life" (in Huis Clos). The pertinence of these answers
lies less in their
validity as redefinitions of personal identity than
in their usefulness for an
eventual escape from
social
identification, from
the
multiplicity
of
inter-
changeable roles and functions which society had imposed. The point was
to do something, heroic or criminal, which was unpredictable and undeter-
mined by anybody else.
The pronounced activism of the totalitarian movements, their preference
for terrorism over
all other forms of
political
activity,
attracted
the
intel-
lectual elite and the mob alike, precisely because
this terrorism was so

different
from
ihat
of
the
earlier
revolutionary
societies.
It was
no

a
matter of calculated
policy which saw
in
terrorist
acts
the
only
n»eans to eliminate
certain outstanding
personalities who, because
of their
policies or position, had become the symbol of oppression. What proved so
attractive was
that
terrorism
had
become
a
kind
of
philosophy
through
which to express frustration, resentment, and blind hatred,
a kind of politi-
cal expressionism which used bombs to express oneself, which watched de-
lightedly the publicity given to resounding deeds and was absolutely willing
to pay the price of
life
for having succeeded
in forcing the
recognition of
one's existence on the normal
strata of society.
It was
still the same
spirit
and the same game which made Goebbels, long before the eventual defeat of
Nazi Ciermanv. announce
with
obvious
delight
that
the
Nazis,
in
case
of
defeat, would know how to slam the door behind them and not to be
for-
gotten for centuries.
Yet
it
is here
if anywhere
that
a
valid
criterion may be found
for
dis-
tinguishing the
elite from the mob
in the pretotalitarian atmosphere. What
the mob wanted, and what Goebbels expressed
with
great
precision, was
access to history even
at the price of destruction. Goebbels' sincere convic-
tion that "the greatest happiness that a contemporary can experience today"
is cither to be a genius or to serve one,"'^ was typical of the mob but neither
of the masses nor the sympathizing
elite. The
latter, on the contrary, took
anonymity seriously to the point of seriously denying the existence of genius;
all the
art theories of the twenties
tried desperately to prove that the excel-
lent
is the product of
skill, craftsmanship,
logic, and the realization of the
potentialities of the
material.''^ The mob, and
not
the
elite, was charmed
by the "radiant power of fame" (Stefan Zweig) and accepted enthusiastically
the genius idolatry of the
late bourgeois world. In this the mob of the twen-
tieth century
followed
faithfully
the
pattern
of
earlier parvenus who
also
had discovered the
fact that bourgeois society would
rather open
its doors
to the fascinating "abnormal," the genius, the homosexual, or the Jew, than
to simple
merit. The
elite's contempt
for the
genius and
its yearning
for
anonymity was
still witness of a spirit which neither the masses nor the mob
were
in
a position
to understand, and which,
in the words of Robespierre,
strove to assert the grandeur of man against the pettiness of the great.
This difference between
the
elite and the mob notwithstanding,
there
is
no doubt that the elite was pleased whenever the underworld frightened re-
spectable society into accepting
it on an equal footing. The members of the
elite did
not object
at
all
to paying a
price,
the destruction of civilization,
for the fun of seeing how those who had been excluded unjustly in the past
forced
their way
into
it. They were not
particularly outraged
at the mon-
strous forgeries in historiography of which
all totalitarian regimes are guilty
and which announce themselves
clearly enough
in totalitarian propaganda.
They had convinced themselves that traditional historiography was a forgery

in any case, since
it had excluded the underprivileged and oppressed from
the memory of mankind. Those who were rejected by their own time were
usually forgotten by
history,
and
insult added
to
injury had
troubled
all
sensitive consciences ever since faith in a hereafter where the last would be
the first had disappeared. Injustices in the past as well as the present became
intolerable when
there was no longer any hope
that
the
scales
of
justice
eventually would be set right. Marx's great attempt to rewrite world history
in terms of class struggles fascinated even those who did not believe in the
correctness of his thesis, because of his original intention to find a device by
which to force the destinies of those excluded from
official history into the
memory of posterity.
The temporary alliance between the
elite and the mob
rested largely on
this genuine delight with which
the former watched the
latter destroy
re-
spectability. This could be
achieved when the German
steel barons were
forced to deal with and to receive socially Hitler the housepainter and self-
admitted former derelict, as
it could be with the crude and vulgar forgeries
perpetrated by the
totalitarian movements
in
all
fields
of
intellectual
life,
insofar
as they gathered
all
the
subterranean,
nonrespectable elements
of
European history
into one consistent
picture. From
this viewpoint
it was
rather gratifying to see that Bolshevism and Nazism began even to eliminate
those sources of their own ideologies which had already won some recogni-
tion in academic or other official quarters. Not Marx's dialectical material-
ism, but the conspiracy of 300 families; not the pompous
scientificality of
Gobineau and Chamberlain, but the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion"; not
the traceable influence of the Catholic Church and the role played by anti-
clericalism in Latin countries, but the backstairs literature about the Jesuits
and the Freemasons became the inspiration for the rewriters of history. The
object of the most varied and variable constructions was always
to
reveal
official
history
as a joke,
to demonstrate
a sphere
of
secret
influences
of
which the visible, traceable, and known historical reality was only the out-
ward fagade erected explicitly to fool the people.
To this aversion of the
intellectual
elite for
official historiography, to
its
conviction that history, which was a forgery anyway, might
as well be the
playground of crackpots, must be added the
terrible, demoralizing fascina-
tion in the possibility that gigantic lies and monstrous falsehoods can eventu-
ally be established as unquestioned
facts, that man may be free to change
his own past
at
will, and that the
difference between
truth and falsehood
may cease to be objective and become a mere matter of power and clever-
ness,
of pressure and
infinite
repetition. Not
Stalin's and
Hitler's
skill
in
the art of lying but the fact that they were able to organize the masses into
a collective unit to back up their
lies with impressive magnificence, exerted
the fascination. Simple forgeries from the viewpoint of scholarship appeared
to
receive the
sanction of
history
itself when
the whole marching
reality
of the movements stood behind them and pretended to draw from them the
necessary inspiration for action.

.^i't
TOTALITARIANISM
The
;ittrac(ion which
the
totalitarian movements
exert on
the
elite,
so
long as and wherever they have not seized power, has been perplexing be-
cause the patently vulgar and arbitrary,
positive doctrines of totalitarianism
arc more conspicuous
to the
outsider and mere observer than the general
motxl which pervades the pretotalitarian atmosphere. These doctrines were
so much at variance with generally accepted
intellectual, cultural, and moral
standards that one could conclude that only an inherent fundamental short-
coming of character in the intellectual,
"la trahison des dens"
(J. Benda),
or a perverse self-hatred of the
spirit, accounted for the delight with which
the elite accepted the "ideas" of the mob. What the spokesmen of humanism
and
liberalism
usually
overlook,
in
their
bitter
disappointment
and
their
unfamiliarity with
the more general experiences of the time,
is that an
at-
mosphere
in which
all
traditional
values and propositions had evaporated
(after the nineteenth-century ideologies had refuted each other and exhausted
their vital appeal
)
in a sense made
it easier to accept patently absurd propo-
sitions
than
the
old
truths which
had become
pious
banalities,
precisely
because nobody could be expected
to take
the
absurdities
seriously.
Vul-
garity with
its cynical dismissal of respected standards and accepted theories
carried with
it a frank admission of the worst and
a disregard for
all pre-
tenses which were easily mistaken for courage and a new style of life. In the
growing prevalence of mob attitudes and convictions—which were
actually
the
attitudes
and
convictions
of
the
bourgeoisie
cleansed
of
hypocrisy
those who
traditionally hated
the bourgeoisie and had
voluntarily
left
re-
spectable society saw only the lack of hypocrisy and respectability, not the
content
itself.'''
Since
the bourgeoisie claimed
to be the guardian of Western
traditions
and confounded
all moral issues by parading publicly virtues which
it not
only did not possess
in private and business
life, but actually held in con-
tempt,
it seemed revolutionary to admit cruelty, disregard of human values,
and
general
amorality, because
this
at
least destroyed
the
duplicity upon
which the existing society seemed to
rest. What a temptation to
flaunt ex-
treme
attitudes
in
the
hypocritical
twilight of double moral
standards,
to
wear publicly
the mask of cruelty
if everybody was patently inconsiderate
and pretended to be gentle, to parade wickedness in a world, not of wicked-
ness, but of meanness! The intellectual
elite of the twenties who knew
little
of the earlier connections between mob and bourgeoisie was certain that the
old game of epater le bourgeois could be played to perfection
if one started
to shock society with an ironically exaggerated picture of
its own behavior.
At that time, nobody anticipated that the true victims of this irony would

be the elite rather than the bourgeoisie. The avant-garde did not know they
were running their heads not against
walls but against open
doors, that
a
unanimous success would belie their claim to being a revolutionary minority,
and would prove that they were about to express a new mass
spirit or the
spirit of the
time.
Particularly
significant
in
this
respect was
the
reception
given Brecht's Dreigroschenoper in pre-Hitler Germany. The play presented
gangsters as respectable businessmen and respectable businessmen as gang-
sters. The irony was somewhat
lost when
respectable businessmen
in
the
audience considered this a deep insight into the ways of the world and when
the mob welcomed
it as an artistic sanction of gangsterism. The theme song
in the play, "Erst kommt das Fressen, dann kommt die Moral," was greeted
with
frantic
applause by
exactly everybody,
though
for
different
reasons.
The mob applauded because
it took the statement
literally; the bourgeoisie
applauded
because
it had been
fooled by
its own
hypocrisy
for
so
long
that
it had grown tired of the tension and found deep wisdom in the expres-
sion of the banality by which
it lived; the
elite applauded because the un-
veiling of hypocrisy was such superior and wonderful fun. The effect of the
work was exactly the opposite of what Brecht had sought by
it. The bour-
geoisie could no longer be shocked;
it welcomed the exposure of
its hidden
philosophy,
whose
popularity
proved
they had
been
right
all
along,
so
that
the
only
political
result
of
Brecht's
"revolution"
was
to
encourage
everyone
to
discard
the
uncomfortable mask
of hypocrisy
and
to
accept
openly the standards of the mob.
A reaction similar in
its ambiguity was aroused some ten years
later
in
France by Celine's Bagatelles pour un Massacre,
in which he proposed to
massacre all the Jews. Andre Gide was publicly delighted in the pages of the
Nouvelle Revue Frangaise, not of course because he wanted to kill the Jews
of France, but because he rejoiced
in the blunt admission of such
a desire
and
in
the
fascinating
contradiction
between
Celine's
bluntness
and
the
hypocritical politeness which surrounded the Jewish question in
all
respect-
able quarters. How
irresistible
the
desire
for the unmasking
of hypocrisy
was among the
elite can be gauged by the fact that such delight could not
even be spoiled by Hitler's very
real persecution of the Jews, which
at the
time of Celine's writing was already
in full swing. Yet aversion against the
philosemitism of the liberals had much more to do with
this reaction than
hatred of Jews. A similar frame of mind explains the remarkable fact that
Hitler's and Stalin's widely publicized opinions about art and their persecu-
tion of modern artists have never been able to destroy the attraction which
the totalitarian movements had for avant-garde
artists; this shows the elite's
lack of a sense of
reality, together with
its perverted
selflessness, both
of
which resemble only too closely the fictitious world and the absence of self-
interest among the masses.
It was the great opportunity of the
totalitarian
movements, and the reason why a temporary alliance between the intellectual
elite and the mob could come about, that in an elementary and undifferen-
tiated way
their problems had become
the same
and
foreshadowed
the
problems and mentality of the masses.

TOTALITARIANISM
CU>scIy
rclaled
to the
attraction which
the mob's
lack of hypocrisy and
the
masses'
lack
of
self-interest exerted on
the
elite was
the equally
irre-
sistible appeal of the
totalitarian movements' spurious claim
to have abol-
ished the separation between
private and public
life and to have restored a
mysterious
irrational wholeness
in man.
Since
Balzac
revealed
the
private
lives of the public figures of French society and since
Ibsen's dramatization
of the "Pillars of Society" had conquered the Continental theater, the issue
of double morality was one of the main topics for tragedies, comedies, and
novels.
Double
morality
as
practiced by
the
bourgeoisie became
the out-
standing sign of that
e.sprii de serieux, which
is always pompous and never
sincere. This division between private and public or social
life had nothing
to do with the justified separation between the personal and public spheres,
but was rather the psychological reflection of the nineteenth-century struggle
between houri^eois and ciioyen, between the man who judged and used
all
public
institutions by the yardstick of his private
interests and the respon-
sible citizen who was concerned with public
affairs
as the
affairs of
all.
In
this connection,
the
liberals'
political
philosophy,
according
to which
the
mere sum of individual interests adds up to the miracle of the common good,
appeared to be only a rationalization of the recklessness with which private
interests were pressed regardless of the common good.
Against
the
class
spirit
of
the
Continental
parties,
which
had
always
admitted they represented certain
interests, and
against the "opportunism"
resulting from
their conception of themselves
as only
parts of
a
total, the
totalitarian movements
asserted
their
"superiority"
in
that
they
carried
a
Wt'Uanschouunii by which they would take possession of man as a whole.^"
In this claim to totality the mob leaders of the movements again formulated
and only reversed the bourgeoisie's own political philosophy. The bourgeois
class, having made
its way through social pressure and, frequently, through
an economic
blackmail
of
political
institutions,
always
believed
that
the
public and visible organs of power were directed by their own secret, non-
public
interests
and
influence.
In
this
sense,
the
bourgeoisie's
political
philosophy
was
always
"totalitarian";
it
always
assumed
an
identity
of
politics, economics and
society,
in which
political
institutions
served only
as
the
facjade
for
private
interests. The
bourgeoisie's double
standard,
its
differentiation between
public and
private
life,
were
a
concession
to
the
nation-state which had desperately tried to keep the two spheres apart.
What appealed to the elite was radicalism as such. Marx's hopeful predic-
tions that the state would wither away and
a classless society emerge were
no longer radical, no longer Messianic enough.
If Berdyaev
is right in stat-
ing
that "Russian

the attraction which Soviet Russia exerted almost equally on Nazi and Com-

in the
fact
that

"the revolution was a religion and a philosophy, not merely a conflict con-
cerned with the social and
political
side of
life.""^ The truth was that the
transformation of classes into masses and the breakdown of the prestige and
authority of
political
institutions had brought to Western European coun-
tries conditions which resembled those prevalent
in Russia, so that
it was
no accident that
their revolutionaries
also began
to
take on
the
typically
Russian revolutionary fanaticism which looked forward,
not
to change
in
social or political conditions, but to the radical destruction of every existing
creed, value, and
institution. The mob merely took advantage of this new
mood and brought about a short-lived alliance of revolutionaries and crim-
inals, which
also had been present
in many revolutionary
sects
in
Czarist
Russia but conspicuously absent from the European scene.
The disturbing alliance between the mob and the
elite, and the curious
coincidence of their aspirations, had their origin in the fact that these strata
had been the first to be eliminated from the structure of the nation-state and
the framework of class
society. They found each
other so
easily,
if only
temporarily, because they both sensed that they represented the fate of the
time, that they were followed by unending masses, that sooner or later the
majority of European peoples might be with them—as they thought, ready
to make their revolution.
It turned out that they were both mistaken. The mob, the underworld of
the bourgeois
class, hoped that the
helpless masses would help them into
power, would support them when they attempted to forward
their private
interests, that they would be able simply to replace the older strata of bour-
geois society and to
instill into
it the more enterprising spirit of the under-
world. Yet totalitarianism
in power learned quickly
that enterprising
spirit
was not restricted to the mob strata of the population and that, in any event,
such
initiative could only be a threat to the
total domination of man. Ab-
sence of scruple, on the other hand, was not restricted to the mob either and,
in any event, could be taught in a relatively short time. For the ruthless ma-
chines of domination and extermination, the masses of co-ordinated philis-
tines provided much better material and were capable of even greater crimes
than so-called professional criminals, provided only that these crimes were
well organized and assumed the appearance of routine jobs.
It
is not
fortuitous,
then,
that
the few protests
against the Nazis' mass
atrocities against the Jews and Eastern European peoples were voiced not
by the
military men nor by any other part of the co-ordinated masses
of
respectable philistines, but precisely by those early comrades of Hitler who
were typical representatives of the mob.*'^ Nor was Himmler, the most power-

ful man in Germany after 1936, one of those "armed bohemians" (Heiden)
whose
features were
distressingly
similar
to those of the
intellectual
elite.
Himmlcr was himself "more normal," that
is, more of a philistine, than any
of the original leaders of the Nazi movement."'' He was not a bohemian like
Gix-bbcls. or a sex criminal
like Streicher, or a crackpot like Rosenberg, or
a fanatic
like
Hitler, or an adventurer
like Goring. He proved
his supreme
ability
for organizing
the
masses
into
total domination
by assuming
that
most
people
are
neither
bohemians,
fanatics,
adventurers,
sex
maniacs,
crackpots, nor social
failures, but
first and foremost job holders and good
family men.
The
Philistine's retirement into private
life,
his single-minded devotion to
matters of family and career was the last, and already degenerated, product
of the bourgeoisie's belief in the primacy of private
interest. The
philistine
is the bourgeois isolated from his own class, the atomized individual who
is
produced
by
the breakdown
of
the bourgeois
class
itself. The mass man
whom Himmler organized
for the greatest mass crimes ever committed
in
history bore the features of the philistine rather than of the mob man, and
was the bourgeois who in the midst of the ruins of his world worried about
nothing so much as
his private security, was ready to sacrifice everything
belief, honor, dignity—on the
slightest provocation. Nothing proved easier
to destroy than the privacy and private morality of people who thought of
nothing but safeguarding their private lives. After a few years of power and
criminated against even by the indigenous population?
I could not do
it.
I ask you to
give me
clear-cut
instructions to take care of the matter
in the most humane way for
ihc sake of the prestige of our Reich and our Party." This
letter
is published
in Max
Wcinrcich,
Hitler's Professors, New York,
1946, pp.
153-154. Kube's intervention was
quickly
overruled,
yet an
almost
identical
attempt
to
save
the
lives of Danish
Jews,
made
by W.
Best,
the
Reich's plenipotentiary
in Denmark, and
a well-known
Nazi,
was more successful. See Nazi Conspiracy, V.
2.
Similarly Alfred Rosenberg, who had preached
the
inferiority of the Slav
peoples,
obviously never realized that his theories might one day mean their liquidation. Charged
with
the
administration
of
the
Ukraine,
he
wrote
outraged
reports about
conditions
there during the
fall of
1942 after he had
tried earlier to get direct intervention from
Hitler himself. See Nazi Conspiracy,
III, 83
fT., and IV, 62.
There
are of course some exceptions
to
this
rule. The man who saved
Paris from
destruction
was General
von
Choltitz who,
however,
still
"feared
that
he would
be
deprived
of
his command
as he had
not executed
his orders" even though he knew
that
the "war had been
lost
for several
years." That he would have had the courage
to
resist
the order "to turn
Paris
into
a mass of ruins" without the energetic support
of a Nazi of old standing. Otto Abetz the Ambassador to France, appears dubious ac-
cording to
his own testimony during the
trial of Abetz in
Paris. See New York Times,
July 21.
1949.

as

still a private individual in Germany

In
all fairness to those among the
elite, on the other hand, who
at one
time or another have
let themselves be seduced by totalitarian movements,
and who sometimes, because of their intellectual
abilities, are even accused
of having
inspired
totalitarianism,
it must be
stated
that what these
des-
perate men of the twentieth century did or did not do had no influence on
totalitarianism whatsoever,
although
it did
play some
part
in
earlier,
suc-
cessful, attempts of the movements to force the outside world to take their
doctrines
seriously.
Wherever
totalitarian
movements
seized
power,
this
whole group of sympathizers was shaken off even before the regimes pro-
ceeded toward their greatest crimes.
Intellectual,
spiritual, and
artistic
ini-
tiative is as dangerous to totalitarianism as the gangster initiative of the mob,
and both are more dangerous than mere political opposition. The consistent
persecution of every
higher form of intellectual
activity by the new mass
leaders springs from more than their natural resentment against everything
they cannot understand. Total domination does not allow for free
initiative
in any field of
life, for any
activity that
is not entirely
predictable.
Totali-
tarianism
in power
invariably
replaces
all
first-rate
talents,
regardless
of
their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence
and creativity is
still the best guarantee of their loyalty."''
"^ The remark was made by Robert Ley. See Kohn-Bramstedt, op.

178.

this respect surprisingly consistent,

careers of those comparatively few

such
as Hans Frank,

last
to
fall
into disgrace was the

CHAPTER ELEVEN
The Totalitarian
Movement
i:
Totalitarian Propaganda
ONLY THE MOB and the elite can be attracted by the momentum of total-
itarianism
itself;
the masses have
to be won by propaganda. Under
conditions of constitutional government and freedom of opinion, totalitarian
movements struggling for power can use terror to a limited extent only and
share with other parties the necessity of winning adherents and of appearing
plausible
to
a public which
is not
yet
rigorously
isolated from
all
other
sources of information.
It was recognized early and has frequently been asserted
that
in
total-
itarian countries propaganda and terror present two sides of the same coin.^
This, however,
is only partly
true. Wherever totalitarianism possesses
ab-
solute control,
it replaces propaganda with indoctrination and uses violence
not so much to frighten people
(this
is done only in the
initial stages when
political opposition
still exists)
as to
realize constantly
its ideological doc-
trines and
its practical
lies. Totalitarianism will not be satisfied to assert, in
the face of contrary facts, that unemployment does not exist;
it will abolish
unemployment benefits as part of
its propaganda.- Equally important
is the
fact
that
the
refusal
to acknowledge unemployment
realized—albeit
in
a
rather unexpected way—the old socialist doctrine: He who does not work
shall not eat. Or when, to take another instance,
Stalin decided to rewrite
' See, for instance, E. Kohn-Bramstedt, Dictatorship and Political Police: The Tech-
nique
of Control by
Fear, London,
1945,
p.
164
flf. The
explanation
is
that
"terror
without propaganda would
lose most
of
its psychological
effect, whereas propaganda
without
terror does not contain
its
full punch"
(p.
175). What
is overlooked
in these
and
similar statements, which
mostly go around
in
circles,
is
the
fact
that
not
only
political propaganda but
the whole of modern mass publicity contains an element
of
threat;
that
terror, on
the other hand, can
be
fully
effective without propaganda,
so
long
as
it
is only a question of conventional
political
terror
of tyranny. Only when
terror
is
intended
to coerce
not merely from
without
but.
as
it
were, from
within,
when
the
political
regime
wants
more
than
power,
is
terror
in
need
of
propa-
ganda.
In
this sense
the Nazi
theorist, Eugen Hadamovsky, could say
in Propaganda
iind nationale Macht,
1933:
"Propaganda and
violence
are never contradictions. Use
of violence can be part of the propaganda"
(p. 22).
^ "At
that
time,
it was
officially announced
that unemployment was
'liquidated'
in
Soviet
Russia. The
result
of
the announcement
was
that
all
unemployment
benefits
were equally 'liquidated'" (Anton Ciliga, The Russian Enigma, London,
1940, p.
109).

.u:
TOTALITARIANISM
the
hisior>' of
ihc Russian Revolution,
the propaganda of
his new version
consisted in destroying, together with
the older books and documents, their
authors and readers:
the publication in 1938 of a new official history of the
Communist Party was the
signal
that the superpurge which had decimated
a whole generation of Soviet
intellectuals had come
to
an end.
Similarly,
the Nazis
in the Eastern occupied
territories
at
first used chiefly antisemitic
propaganda
to win
firmer control
of
the
population. They
neither needed
nor used terror to support this propaganda. When they liquidated the greater
part of the Polish intelligentsia, they did
it not because of
its opposition, but
because according
to
their doctrine
Poles had no
intellect, and when they
planned to kidnap blue-eyed and blond-haired children, they did not intend
to frighten the population but to save "Germanic blood. ^
Since
totalitarian movements
exist
in
a world which
itself
is
nontotali-
tarian. they are forced to resort to what we commonly regard as propaganda.
But such propaganda always makes
its appeal to an external sphere—be
it
the
nontotalitarian
strata of the population
at home or the nontotalitarian
countries
abroad.
This
external
sphere
to
which
totalitarian
propaganda
makes
its appeal may vary greatly; even
after the seizure
of power
totali-
tarian propaganda may address
itself to those segments of
its own popula-
tion whose co-ordination was
not followed by
sufficient
indoctrination.
In
this
respect
Hitler's speeches
to
his generals during
the war
are
veritable
models
of propaganda,
characterized
mainly by
the
monstrous
lies
with
which the Fuehrer entertained his guests
in an attempt to win them
over.'*
The external sphere can also be represented by groups of sympathizers who
'The
so-called
"Opcriilion Hay" began with
a decree dated February
16,
1942, by
Himmlcr "concerning
[individuals]
of German stock
in Poland," stipulating
that
their
children should be sent
to families "that are
willing
[to accept them]
without reserva-
tion*, out of love
for
the good blood
in them" (Nuremberg Document R
135, photo-
stated by the Centre dc Documentation Juive,
Paris).
It seems that
in June,
1944,
the
Ninth Army actually kidnapped 40,000 to 50,000 children and subsequently transported
Ihcm to Germany. A report on this matter, sent to the General Staff of the Wehrmacht
m Berlin by a man called Brandenburg, mentions similar plans for the Ukraine (Docu-
ment PS 031, published by Leon Poliakov
in Brcviaire de
la Haine,
p. 317). Himmler
himself made
several
references
to
this
plan.

are not yet ready to accept the true aims of the movement; finally,
it often
happens that even party members are regarded by the Fuehrer's inner circle
or the members of the
elite formations
as belonging
to such an external
sphere, and in this case they, too, are
still in need of propaganda because
they cannot
yet be
reliably dominated.
In order
not
to overestimate
the
importance of the propaganda
lies one should recall the much more numer-
ous instances in which Hitler was completely sincere and brutally unequivocal
in the
definition of the movement's
true
aims, but they were
simply
not
acknowledged by a public unprepared for such consistency/' But, basically
speaking,
totalitarian
domination
strives
to
restrict
propaganda
methods
solely to
its foreign policy or to the branches of the movement abroad for
the purpose of supplying them with suitable material. Whenever totalitarian
indoctrination
at home comes
into
conflict with
the propaganda
line
for
consumption abroad (which happened in Russia during the war, not when
Stalin had concluded his alliance with Hitler, but when the war with Hitler
brought him
into
the camp
of the
democracies),
the propaganda
is
ex-
plained
at home as a "temporary tactical maneuver."" As far
as
possible,
this distinction between ideological doctrine for the
initiated
in the move-
ment, who are no longer in need of propaganda, and unadulterated propa-
ganda for the outside world
is already established in the prepower existence
of the movements. The relationship between propaganda and indoctrination
usually depends upon the
size of the movements on one hand, and upon
outside pressure on the other. The smaller the movement, the more energy
it will expend in mere propaganda; the greater the pressure on totalitarian
regimes from the outside world—a pressure that even behind iron curtains
cannot be ignored entirely—the more actively will the totalitarian dictators
be
set up
in
the
fall
of
1941
(see Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression,
II,
pp. 265
ff.;
Ill,
pp. 783
ff. Document PS
1104; V.
pp. 322
ff. Document PS 2605). Himmler
al-
ready knew
in
the spring of
1941
that "the Jews
[must
be] exterminated
to
the
last
man
by
the end
of
the
war.
This
is
the
unequivocal
desire
and command
of
the
Fuehrer" (Dossier Kersten
in the Centre de Documentation Juive).
^ In
this
connection
there
is
a
very
interesting
report, dated
July
16,
1940, on
a
discussion
at the Fuehrer's headquarters,
in the presence of Rosenberg, Lammers and
Keitel, which
Hitler began by
stating
the
following
"basic
principles":
"It was now
essential
not to parade our ultimate goal before the entire world;
.
.
. Hence
it must
not be obvious that
[the decrees for maintaining peace and order
in the occupied ter-
ritories] point to a final settlement. All necessary measures—executions,
resettlements
—can, and
will be, carried out in spite of this." This
is followed by a discussion which
makes no reference whatever to
Hitler's words and
in which
Hitler no longer partici-
pates. He quite obviously had not been "understood" (Document L 221
in the Centre
de Documentation Juive).
® For
Stalin's confidence
that
Hitler would
not
attack
Russia,
see
Isaac Deutscher,
Stalin: a Political Biography. New York and London,
1949, pp. 454
ff., and especially
the footnote on p. 458:
"It was only in 1948 that the Chief of the State Planning Com-
mission, Vice-Premier N. Voznesensky, disclosed that the economic plans for the third
quarter
of
1941
had been
based on
the assumption
of peace and
that
a new
plan,
suited
for war, had been
drafted only
after
the outbreak
of
hostilities."
Deutscher's
estimate has now been solidly confirmed by Khrushchev's report on Stalin's reaction to
the German attack on the Soviet Union. See
his "Speech on
Stalin"
at the Twentieth
Congress as released by the State Department, New York Times, June
5,

TOTALITARIANISM
engage
in propaganda. The essential
point
is that the necessities for propa-
ganda
arc
always
dictated by
the
outside world
and
that
the movements
themselves do
not
actually
propagate
but
indoctrinate.
Conversely,
indoc-
irmation,
inevitably coupled with
terror,
increases with the strength of the
movements or the totalitarian governments' isolation and security from out-
side interference.
Propaganda
is
indeed
part and
parcel
of
"psychological
warfare"; but
terror
is more. Terror continues
to
be used by
totalitarian
regimes
even
when
its psychological aims
are achieved:
its
real horror
is
that
it
reigns
over a completely subdued population. Where the
rule of terror
is brought
to
perfection,
as
in
concentration camps, propaganda disappears
entirely;
it was even expressly
prohibited
in Nazi Germany.'^ Propaganda,
in
other
words,
is one, and
possibly
the most important, instrument of totalitarian-
ism

terror, on

contrary,
is

Its existence depends as
little on
psychological
or
other
subjective
factors
as
the
existence
of
laws
in
a
constitutionally governed country depends upon the number of people who
transgress them.
Terror as the counterpart of propaganda played a greater role
in Nazism
than
in Communism. The Nazis did not strike
at prominent figures
as had
been done
in the earlier wave of political crimes
in Germany
(the murder
of Rathenau and Erzberger); instead, by killing small socialist functionaries
or
influential members of opposing parties, they attempted to prove
to the
population
the dangers involved
in mere membership. This kind
of mass
terror, which
still operated on a comparatively small scale, increased steadily
because neither the
police nor the courts seriously prosecuted
political
of-
fenders on the so-called Right.
It was valuable as what a Nazi publicist has
aptly called "power propaganda": ^
it made clear to the population at large
that the power of the Nazis was greater than that of the authorities and that
it was
safer
to be
a member of
a Nazi
paramilitary
organization than
a
loyal Republican. This impression was greatly strengthened by the
specific
use
the Nazis made of their
political crimes. They always admitted them
publicly, never apologized for "excesses of the lower ranks"—such apologies
were
used
only
by
Nazi
sympathizers—and
impressed
the
population
as
being very different from the "idle talkers" of other parties.
The similarities between this kind of terror and plain gangsterism are too

obvious to be pointed out. This does not mean that Nazism was gangster-
ism, as has sometimes been concluded, but only that the Nazis, without ad-
mitting
it, learned
as much from American gangster organizations
as
their
propaganda,
admittedly,
learned from American
business
publicity.
More specific in totalitarian propaganda, however, than direct threats and
crimes against individuals
is the use of indirect, veiled, and menacing hints
against
all who
will not heed
its teachings and,
later, mass murder perpe-
trated on "guilty" and "innocent"
alike. People are threatened by Commu-
nist propaganda with missing the train of history, with remaining hopelessly
behind their time, with spending their lives uselessly, just as they were threat-
ened by the Nazis with
living against
the
eternal laws of nature and
life,
with an irreparable and mysterious deterioration of their blood. The strong
emphasis of totalitarian propaganda on the
"scientific" nature of
its
asser-
tions has been compared
to certain
advertising techniques which
also
ad-
dress themselves to masses. And
it
is
true that the advertising columns of
every newspaper show this "scientificality," by which a manufacturer proves
with facts and figures and the help of a "research" department
that
his
is
the "best soap in the world.""
It
is also true that there
is a certain element
of violence
in the imaginative exaggerations of publicity men,
that behind
the assertion that
girls who do not use
this particular brand of soap may
go through
life with pimples and without a husband,
lies the wild dream of
monopoly, the dream that one day the manufacturer of the "only soap that
prevents pimples" may have the power to deprive of husbands
all girls who
do not use his soap. Science in the instances of both business publicity and
totalitarian propaganda
is obviously only a surrogate for power. The obses-
sion of totalitarian movements with "scientific" proofs ceases once they are
in power. The Nazis
dismissed even
those
scholars who were
willing
to
serve them, and
the Bolsheviks
use
the
reputation
of
their
scientists
for
entirely
unscientific purposes and
force them
into
the
role
of
charlatans.
But there
is nothing more to the frequently overrated similarities between
mass advertisement and mass propaganda. Businessmen usually do not pose
as prophets and they do not constantly demonstrate the correctness of their
predictions. The scientificality of totalitarian propaganda
is characterized by
its almost exclusive insistence on
scientific prophecy
as distinguished from
the more old-fashioned appeal
to
the
past. Nowhere does
the
ideological
origin,
of
socialism
in one
instance and racism
in
the
other, show more
clearly than when their spokesmen pretend
that they have
discovered
the
hidden
forces
that
will
bring them good
fortune
in
the
chain
of
fatality.
There
is of course a great appeal to the masses in "absolutist systems which
represent
all the events of history
as depending upon the great
first causes
linked by the chain of fatality, and which,
as
it were, suppress men from
the history of the human race" (in the words of Tocqueville )
. But
it cannot
^Hitler's analysis of "War Propaganda" (Mein Kumpj, Book
I, chapter vi)

the
business angle of propaganda and uses the example of publicity for soap.

he doubted cither that the Nazi leadership actually believed
in, and did not
merely use as propaganda, such doctrines as the following: "The more ac-
curately ue recognize and observe the laws of nature and
life, ... so much
the moTC do we conform
to the
will of the Almighty. The more insight we
havr into the will of the Almighty, the greater will be our successes."'"
It
is
quite apparent that
ver\' few changes are needed to express Stalin's creed in
two sentences which might run as follows: "The more accurately we recog-
nize and observe the laws of history and class struggle, so much the more do
we conform to dialectic materialism. The more insight we have into dialectic
materialism,
the
greater
will
be our
success."

at any
rate, could
hardly be
better
illustrated.
lot.ilitarian
propaganda
raised
ideological
scientificality
and
its
tech-
nique of making statements
in
the form of predictions
to
a height of
eflfi-
cicncy of method and absurdity of content because, demagogically speaking,
there
is hardly
a better way
to avoid discussion than by
releasing an argu-
ment from the control of the present and by saying that only the future can
reveal
its
merits. However,
totalitarian
ideologies did not invent
this
pro-
cedure, and were not the only ones to use
it.
Scientificality of mass prop-
aganda has indeed been so universally employed
in modern
politics that
it
has been interpreted
as
a more general
sign of that obsession with science
which
has characterized
the Western world
since
the
rise
of mathematics
and physics in the sixteenth century; thus totalitarianism appears to be only
the
last stage
in a process during which "science [has become] an idol that
will magically cure the evils of existence and transform the nature of man." *^
And there was,
indeed, an early connection between
scientificality and
the
rise of the masses. The "collectivism" of masses was welcomed by those who
hoped for the appearance of "natural laws of historical development" which
would
eliminate
the
unpredictability
of
the
individual's
actions
and
be-
havior.'' There has been cited
the example of Enfantin who could already
"see the time approaching when the
'art of moving the masses'
will be so
perfectly developed that the painter, the musician, and the poet will possess
the power to please and to move with the same certainty
as the mathema-
tician solves a geometrical problem or the chemist analyses any substance,"

Socialism and Christianity"

and
it
has been concluded
that modern propaganda was born
then
and
there.i^
Yet whatever the shortcomings of positivism, pragmatism, and behavior-
ism, and however great their influence on the formation of the nineteenth-
century brand of common sense,
it is not at all "the cancerous growth of the
utilitarian segment of existence"''"' which characterizes the masses to whom
totalitarian propaganda and scientificality appeal. The positivists' conviction,
as we know
it from Comte, that the future
is eventually
scientifically pre-
dictable,
rests on
the
evaluation
of
interest
as
an
all-pervasive
force
in
history and the assumption that objective laws of power can be discovered.
Rohan's
political
theory
that
"the
kings command
the
peoples
and
the
interest commands the king," that objective interest
is the rule "that alone
can
never
fail,"
that
"rightly
or wrongly
understood,
the
interest makes
governments
live or
die"
is
the
traditional
core
of modern
utilitarianism,
positivist or socialist, but none of these theories assumes
that
it
is possible
"to transform the nature of man"
as totalitarianism indeed
tries to do. On
the contrary, they
all
implicitly or
explicitly assume
that human nature
is
always
the
same,
that
history
is
the
story
of changing
objective
circum-
stances and the human reactions to them, and that
interest,
rightly under-
stood, may lead to a change of circumstances, but not to a change of human
reactions
as
such.
"Scientism"
in
politics
still
presupposes
that human
welfare
is
its
object,
a concept which
is
utterly
alien
to
totalitarianism.'*'
It
is
precisely because
the
utilitarian core
of
ideologies was taken
for
granted
that
the
anti-utilitarian behavior of
totalitarian governments,
their
complete indifference
to mass
interest, has been such
a shock. This
intro-
duced into contemporary politics an element of unheard-of unpredictability.
Totalitarian propaganda, however—although in the form of shifted emphasis
—indicated
even
before
totalitarianism
could
seize
power how
far
the
masses had drifted from mere concern with
interest. Thus the suspicion of
the Allies that the murder of the insane which Hitler ordered
at the begin-
ning of the war should be attributed to the desire to get
rid of unnecessary
mouths to feed was altogether unjustified.'^ Hitler was not forced by the war

they
were
suddenly
confronted with an element of unprecedented
unpredictability. Because
of
its
dcm.igogic
qualities,
totalitarian
propaganda,
which
long
before
the
seizure of p<-)wer clearly indicated how
little the masses were driven by the
famous instinct of self-preservation, was not taken seriously. The success of
totalitarian propaganda, however, does not
rest so much on
its demagoguery
as on the knowledge that interest as a collective force can be felt only where

no
effective propaganda
based on mere
inter-
est can be carried on among masses whose chief characteristic
is that they
belong to no social or political body, and who therefore present a veritable
chaos
of
individual
interests. The
fanaticism
of members
of
totalitarian
movements, so clearly different in quality from the greatest loyalty of mem-
bers of ordinary'
parlies,
is produced by the lack of self-interest of masses
who arc quite prepared to sacrifice themselves. The Nazis have proved that
one can lead
a whole people
into war with the slogan "or else we shall go
down" (something which the war propaganda of 1914 would have avoided
carefully), and
this
is not
in times of misery, unemployment, or frustrated
national ambitions. The same
spirit showed
itself during the
last months of
u war that was obviously
lost, when Nazi propaganda consoled an already
badly frightened population with
the promise that the Fuehrer "in his wis-
dom had prepared an easy death for the German people by gassing them in
case of defeat."

become unending
infallibility; he can never admit an error. -^ The assump-
tion of infallibility, moreover,
is based not so much on superior intelligence
as on the correct interpretation of the essentially reliable forces in history or
nature, forces which neither defeat nor ruin can prove wrong because they
are bound
to
assert themselves
in
the
long
run.-- Mass
leaders
in power
have one concern which
overrules
all
utilitarian
considerations:
to make
their predictions come true. The Nazis did not hesitate to use,
at the end of
the war,
the concentrated
force
of
their
still
intact
organization
to
bring
about as complete a destruction of Germany as possible,
in order to make
true
their prediction
that
the German
people would be
ruined
in case of
defeat.
The propaganda
eflFect of infallibility, the striking success of posing as
a
mere interpreting agent of predictable forces, has encouraged in totalitarian
dictators
the habit of announcing
their
political
intentions
in the form of
prophecy. The most famous example
is
Hitler's announcement
to the Ger-
man
Reichstag
in January,
1939:
"I want today once
again
to make
a
prophecy:
In case the Jewish financiers
.
.
. succeed once more
in hurling
the peoples into a world war, the
result will be
.
.
. the annihilation of the
Jewish
race
in Europe."-^
Translated
into
nontotalitarian
language,
this
meant:
I intend to make war and
I intend to
kill the Jews of Europe. Simi-
larly Stalin, in the great speech before the Central Committee of the Com-
munist
Party
in
1930
in which
he
prepared
the
physical
liquidation
of
intraparty right and
left
deviationists, described them
as representatives of
"dying classes."-^
This
definition
not
only gave
the argument
its
specific
sharpness
but
also announced,
in
totalitarian
style,
the
physical
destruc-
tion of those whose "dying out" had just been prophesied.
In both instances
the same objective
is accomplished:
the liquidation
is fitted into a historical
process
in which man only does or
sufi"ers what,
according
to immutable
laws,
is bound to happen anyway. As soon as the execution of the victims
has been carried out, the "prophecy" becomes a retrospective
alibi:
noth-
ing happened but what had
already been
predicted.-''

this

"Hitler's decision

"Their claim

This method, like other totalitarian propaganda methods,
is foolproof only
after the movements have seized power. Then
all debate about the truth or
falsity of
a
totalitarian
dictator's
prediction
is
as weird
as arguing with
a
potential murderer about whether
his future victim
is dead or
alive—since
by
killing the person
in question the murderer can promptly provide proof
of the correctness of his statement. The only valid argument under such con-
ditions
is promptly
to
rescue
the person whose death
is predicted. Before
mass leaders seize the power to
fit
reality to their
lies,
their propaganda
is
marked by
its extreme contempt
for
facts
as
such,-^
for
in
their opinion
fact depends entirely on the power of man who can fabricate
it. The asser-
tion that
the Moscow subway
is the only one
in the world
is a
lie only so
long as the Bolsheviks have not the power to destroy
all the others. In other
words, the method of infallible prediction, more than any other totalitarian
propaganda device, betrays
its ultimate goal of world conquest,
since only
in a world completely under his control could the totalitarian ruler possibly
realize
all
his
lies and make
true
all
his prophecies.
The

may be victorious, or the particular enterprise that may be a success,
is the
victory of no matter what cause, and success in no matter what enterprise.
Totalitarian propaganda perfects the techniques of mass propaganda, but
it neither invents them nor originates their themes. These were prepared for
them by fifty years of the rise of imperialism and disintegration of the nation-
state, when the mob entered the scene of European politics. Like the earlier
mob leaders, the spokesmen for totalitarian movements possessed an unerring
instinct for anything that ordinary party propaganda or public opinion did
not care or dare
to
touch.
Everything hidden,
everything passed
over
in
silence, became of major significance, regardless of
its own intrinsic impor-
tance. The mob
really believed that truth was whatever respectable society
had hypocritically passed over, or covered up with corruption.
Mysteriousness as such became the
first criterion for the choice of topics.
The origin of mystery did not matter;
it could
lie in a reasonable, politically
comprehensible desire for secrecy, as in the case of the British Secret Serv-
ices or the French Deuxieme Bureau; or in the conspiratory need of revolu-
tionary groups, as in the case of anarchist and other terrorist sects; or in the
structure of societies whose original secret content had long since become
well known and where only the formal
ritual
still retained the former mys-
tery, as in the case of the Freemasons; or in age-old superstitions which had
woven legends around certain groups, as in the case of the Jesuits and the
Jews. The Nazis were undoubtedly superior in the selection of such topics
for mass propaganda; but the Bolsheviks have gradually learned the
trick,
although they rely
less on traditionally accepted mysteries and prefer their
own inventions—since the middle
thirties, one mysterious world conspiracy
has followed another in Bolshevik propaganda, starting with the plot of the
Trotskyites, followed by the rule of the 300 families, to the sinister imperial-
ist
(i.e., global) machinations of the British or American Secret
Services.-"
The effectiveness of this kind of propaganda demonstrates one of the chief
characteristics of modern masses. They do not believe
in anything
visible,
in the reality of their own experience; they do not trust their eyes and ears
but only their imaginations, which may be caught by anything that is at once
universal and consistent in
itself. What convinces masses are not facts, and
not even invented
facts, but only
the consistency of the system of which
they are presumably part. Repetition, somewhat overrated in importance be-
cause of the common belief in the masses' inferior capacity to grasp and re-
member,
is important only because
it convinces them of consistency in time.
What the masses refuse to recognize
is the fortuitousness that pervades
^' It
is interesting to note that the Bolsheviks during the Stalin era somehow accumu-
lated
conspiracies,
that the discovery of a new one did
not mean they would discard
the
former. The

around

the

families
were

1935 onward, British imperialism became

war;

Totalitarian pri>paganda thrives on this escape from reality into fiction,
from coincidence
into consistency.
The chief disability of totalitarian propaganda
is that
it cannot
fulfill this
longing of the masses for a completely consistent, comprehensible, and pre-
dictable
world
without
seriously
conflicting
with common
sense.
If,
for
instance,
all the "confessions" of political opponents
in the Soviet Union are
phrased
in the same language and admit the same motives, the consistency-
hungry masses will accept the fiction as supreme proof of their truthfulness;
whereas conunon sense
tells
us
that
it
is
precisely
their consistency which
is out of this world and proves that they are a fabrication. Figuratively speak-
ing,
it
is as though
the masses demand a constant
repetition of the miracle
of the Septuagint. when, according to ancient legend, seventy isolated trans-
lators produced an identical Greek version of the Old Testament. Common
sense can accept this tale only as a legend or a miracle; yet
it could also be
adduced
as proof of
the absolute
faithfulness of every
single word
in
the
translated
text.
In other words, while
it
is true that the masses are obsessed by
a desire
to escajX" from
reality because
in
their essential homelessness they can no
longer bear
its accidental, incomprehensible aspects,
it
is also true that their
longing for fiction has some connection with those capacities of the human
mind whose
structural
consistency
is
superior
to
mere
occurrence.
The
masses' escape from
reality
is a verdict against the world in which they are
forced to live and
in which they cannot exist, since coincidence has become
its supreme master and human beings need the constant transformation of
chaotic and accidental conditions into a man-made pattern of relative con-
sistency.
I he revolt of the masses against "realism," common sense, and
all
"the plausibilities of the world" (Burke) was the result of their atomization,
of their loss of social
status along with which they
lost the whole sector of
communal relationships in whose framework common sense makes sense. In
their situation of spiritual and social homelessness, a measured insight into
the interdependence of the arbitrary and the planned, the accidental and the
necessary, could no longer operate. Totalitarian propaganda can outrageously
msult common sense only where common sense has lost
its validity. Before
the alternative of facing the anarchic growth and total arbitrariness of decay
or bowing down before the most
rigid, fantastically
fictitious consistency of
an ideology, the masses probably will always choose the latter and be ready
to pay for
it with individual sacrifices—and this not because they are stupid
or wicked,
but
because
in
the
general
disaster
this escape
grants them
a
minimum of self-respect.
While
it has been the
specialty of Nazi propaganda
to
profit from the
longmg
of
the
masses
for
consistency,
Bolshevik
methods
have demon-
strated, as though
in a laboratory,
its impact on the isolated mass man. The

they never committed, and
in many instances were
in no position to com-
mit, completely isolates and eliminates all real factors, so that the very logic,
the very consistency
of "the
story" contained
in
the prepared
confession
becomes
overwhelming.
In
a
situation
where
the
dividing
line
between
fiction and
reality
is blurred by the monstrosity and the inner consistency
of
the
accusation,
not
only
the
strength
of
character
to
resist
constant
threats but great confidence in the existence of fellow human beings—rela-
tives or friends or neighbors—who will never believe "the story" are required
to
resist the temptation to
yield
to
the mere
abstract
possibility
of
guilt.
To be
sure,
this extreme
of
an
artificially
fabricated
insanity
can
be
achieved only in a totalitarian world. Then, however,
it
is part of the propa-
ganda apparatus
of the
totalitarian regimes
to which
confessions
are
not
indispensable
for punishment.
"Confessions"
are
as much
a
specialty
of
Bolshevik propaganda as the curious pedantry of legalizing crimes by retro-
spective and retroactive legislation was a specialty of Nazi propaganda. The
aim
in both cases
is consistency.
Before they
seize power and
establish
a world according
to
their doc-
trines, totalitarian movements conjure up a lying world of consistency which
is more adequate
to
the needs
of the human mind than
reality
itself;
in
which, through sheer imagination, uprooted masses can
feel
at home and
are spared the never-ending shocks which real life and real experiences deal
to human beings and their expectations. The force possessed by totalitarian
propaganda—before the movements have the power to drop iron curtains
to prevent anyone's disturbing, by the
slightest
reality, the gruesome quiet
of an
entirely imaginary world—lies
in
its
ability
to
shut
the masses
off
from the real world. The only signs which the real world
still offers to the
understanding of the unintegrated and disintegrating masses—whom every
new stroke of
ill luck makes more
gullible—are,
so to speak,
its lacunae,
the questions
it does not care to discuss publicly, or the rumors
it does not
dare
to
contradict because
they
hit,
although
in an exaggerated and
de-
formed way, some sore spot.
From these sore spots the
lies of totalitarian propaganda derive the
ele-
ment of truthfulness and real experience they need to bridge the gulf between
reality and
fiction. Only
terror could
rely on mere
fiction,
and even
the
terror-sustained lying
fictions of
totalitarian regimes have not yet become
entirely arbitrary, although they are usually cruder, more impudent, and, so
to speak, more original than those of the movements.
(It takes power, not
propaganda skill, to circulate a revised history of the Russian Revolution in
which no man by the name of Trotsky was ever commander-in-chief of the
Red Army.)
The
lies
of
the movements, on
the
other hand,
are much
subtler. They attach themselves to every aspect of social and
political
life
that
is hidden from
the
public
eye. They
succeed
best where
the
official
authorities have surrounded themselves with an atmosphere of secrecy.
In
the eyes of the masses, they then acquire the reputation of superior "realism"
because they touch upon
real conditions whose existence
is being hidden.
Revelations of scandals in high society, of corruption of politicians, every-

thing that belongs
to yellow journalism, becomes
in their hands
a weapon
of more than sensational importance.
The most efficient
fiction of Nazi propaganda was the story of a Jewish
world
conspiracy.
Concentration
on
antisemitic
propaganda
had
been
a
common device of demagogues ever since the end of the nineteenth century,
and was widespread
in the Germany and Austria of the twenties. The more
consistently
a discussion of the Jewish question was avoided by
all
parties
and organs
of
public opinion,
the more convinced
the mob became
that
Jews were the true representatives of the powers that be, and that the Jew-
ish
issue was
the symbol
for
the
hypocrisy and
dishonesty
of
the whole
system.
The
actual
content
of
postwar
antisemitic
propaganda
was
neither
a
monopoly of the Nazis nor particularly new and original. Lies about a Jew-
ish world conspiracy had been current since the Dreyfus
Affair and based
themselves on
the
existing international
interrelationship and interdepend-
ence of a Jewish people dispersed
all over the world. Exaggerated notions
of Jewish world power are even older; they can be traced back to the end
of
the
eighteenth
century, when
the
intimate
connection
betwen
Jewish
business and the nation-states had become visible. The representation of the
Jew as the incarnation of evil
is usually blamed on remnants and
supersti-
tious memories from the Middle Ages, but
is actually closely connected with
the more
recent ambiguous
role which Jews
played
in European
society
since their emancipation. One thing was undeniable:
in the postwar period
Jews had become more prominent than ever before.
The
point about
the Jews themselves
is
that they grew prominent and
conspicuous
in
inverse
proportion
to
their
real
influence and
position
of
power. Every decrease in the stability and force of the nation-states was a
direct blow
to Jewish
positions. The
partially
successful
conquest
of
the
state by the nation made
it impossible for the government machine to main-
tain
its position above
all classes and parties, and thereby nullified the value
of alliances with the Jewish sector of the population, which was supposed
also to stay outside the ranks of society and to be indifferent to party poli-
tics. The growing concern
with
foreign
policy
of
the
imperialist-minded
bourgeoisie and
its growing
influence on the
state machinery was accom-
panied by the
steadfast refusal of the
largest segment of Jewish wealth
to
engage
itself
in
industrial enterprises and to leave the
tradition
of
capital
trading. All this taken together almost ended the economic usefulness to the
state of the Jews
as
a group, and
the advantages
to themselves of
social
separation. After the first World War, Central European Jewries became as
assimilated and nationalized
as French Jewry had become during the
first
decades of the Third Republic.
How conscious the concerned states were of the changed situation came
to light when, in 1917, the German government, following a long-established
tradition,
tried
to
use
its Jews
for
tentative
peace
negotiations
with
the
Allies.
Instead
of addressing
itself
to
the
established
leaders
of German

THE TOTALITARIAN MOVEMENT

Jewry,
it went to the small and comparatively uninfluential Zionist minority
which were
still trusted
in the old way precisely because they
insisted on
the existence of a Jewish people independent of citizenship, and could there-
fore be expected to render services which depended upon international con-
nections and an international point of view. The
step, however, turned out
to have been a mistake for the German government. The Zionists did some-
thing that no Jewish banker had ever done before; they
set their own con-
ditions and
told
the government
that
they would
only
negotiate
a
peace
without annexations and
reparations.'"' The old Jewish
indifference to po-
litical issues was gone; the majority could no longer be used,
since
it was
no longer aloof from the nation, and the Zionist minority was useless because
it had political ideas of
its own.
The replacement
of
monarchical
governments by
republics
in
Central
Europe completed the
disintegration of Central European Jewries,
just
as
the establishment of the Third Republic had done
it
in France some
fifty
years earlier. The Jews had already
lost much of their influence when the
new governments
established
themselves under
conditions
in which
they
lacked the power
as well
as the
interest
to protect their Jews. During the
peace
negotiations
in
Versailles,
Jews were
used
chiefly
as
experts,
and
even
antisemites admitted
that
the
petty Jewish
swindlers
in
the postwar
era,
mostly new
arrivals
(behind whose
fraudulent
activities,
which
dis-
tinguished them
sharply from
their
native
coreligionists,
lay
an
attitude
which oddly resembled the old indifference to the standards of their environ-
ment), had no connections with the
representatives
of
a supposed Jewish
international.^^
Among a host of competing antisemitic groups and in an atmosphere ripe
with
antisemitism, Nazi propaganda developed
a method
of
treating
this
subject which was different from and superior to
all others.
Still,
not one
Nazi slogan was new—not even
Hitler's shrewd picture of a class struggle
caused by the Jewish businessman who exploits
his workers, while
at
the
same time his brother in the factory courtyard incites them to
strike.^^ The
only new element was that the Nazi party demanded proof of non-Jewish
descent for membership and that
it remained, the Feder program notwith-
standing, extremely vague about
the
actual measures
to be taken
against
Jews once it came to power.^"* The Nazis placed the Jewish issue at the center

less consistently, Bol-

Nazi propaganda was ingenious enough
to transform antisemitism into a
principle of self-delinition, and thus to eliminate
it from the fluctuations of
mere opinion.
It used the persuasion of mass demagogy only as
a prepara-
tory step and never overestimated
its

influence, whether
in oratory
or
in

This gave
the masses of atomized, undefinable,
unstable and
futile individuals a means of self-definition and identification which not only
restored some of the self-respect they had formerly derived from their func-
tion in society, but also created a kind of spurious stability which made them
better candidates for an organization. Through this kind of propaganda, the
movement could
set
itself up as an
artificial extension of the mass meeting
and rationalize the essentially futile feelings of self-importance and hysterical
groups:
expulsion
of
naiurali/ed
Jews, and
treatment
of
native Jews
as
aliens.

security that
it offered to the isolated individuals of an atomized
society.^**
The same ingenious application of slogans, coined by others and tried out
before, was apparent in the Nazis' treatment of other relevant issues. When
public
attention was equally focused on nationalism on one hand and so-
cialism on the
other, when the two were thought
to be incompatible and
actually
constituted
the
ideological watershed between
the
Right and
the
Left,
the
"National
Socialist German
Workers'
Party"
(Nazi)
offered
a
synthesis supposed
to
lead
to
national
unity,
a
semantic
solution whose
double trademark of "German" and "Worker" connected the nationalism of
the Right with the internationalism of the Left. The very name of the Nazi
movement
stole
the
political
contents
of
all
other
parties
and
pretended
implicitly to incorporate them
all. Combinations of supposedly antagonistic
political doctrines
(national-socialist,
christian-social,
etc.) had been
tried,
and successfully, before; but the Nazis
realized
their own combination
in
such a way that the whole struggle in Parliament between the socialists and
the nationalists, between those who pretended to be workers
first of
all and
those who were Germans
first, appeared as a sham designed to hide ulterior
sinister motives—for was
not
a member
of the Nazi movement
all these
things
at once?
It
is
interesting
that even
in
their
beginnings
the
Nazis were
prudent
enough never to use slogans which,
like democracy,
republic,
dictatorship,
or monarchy, indicated a specific form of government.^'*
It
is as though, in
this one matter, they had always known that they would be entirely original.
Every
discussion about the
actual form
of
their
future government could
be dismissed as empty talk about mere formalities—the
state, according to
Hitler, being only a "means" for the conservation of the race,
as the
state,
according to Bolshevik propaganda,
is only an instrument
in
the
struggle
of classes.

(ibid,
p. 47). "The enthusiasm
of
the moment becomes a principle and a
spiritual
attitude
through organization and systematic training and discipline"
{ibid.,
p. 21-22).
^® In
the
isolated instances
in which
Hitler concerned himself with
this question
at
all, he used to emphasize:
"Incidentally,
I am not the head of a state in the sense of a
dictator
or monarch,
but
I am
a
leader
of
the German
people"
(see Ausgewdhlte
Reden des
Fiilirers,
1939,
p.
114).—Hans Frank expresses himself in the same
spirit:
"The National Socialist Reich
is not a dictatorial,
let alone an arbitrary, regime. Rather,
the National
Socialist Reich
rests on the mutual loyalty of the Fiihrer and the people"
(in Recht iind Verwaltung, Munich, 1939, p.
15).
"' Hitler repeated many times: "The state
is only the means
to an end. The end
is:
Conservation of race" (Reden,
1939, p.
125). He also stressed that his movement "does
not
rest on
the
state
idea,
but
is
primarily based on
the
closed
Vulksgemeinschaft"
(see
Reden,
1933.

TOTALITARIANISM
In another curious and roundabout way, however, the Nazis gave a propa-
ganda answer to the question of what
their future
role would be, and that
was in their use of the "Protocols of the Elders of Zion" as a model for the
future organization of the German masses for "world empire." The use of
the
ProtiKois was
not
restricted
to
the
Nazis; hundreds
of thousands
of
copies were
sold
in postwar Germany, and even
their open adoption
as
a
handbook of
politics was not
new.^'
Nevertheless,
this forgery was mainly
used for the purpose of denouncing the Jews and arousing the mob to the
dangers of Jewish domination.''- In terms of mere propaganda, the discovery
of the Nazis was
that
the masses were not so frightened by Jewish world
rule as they were interested
in how
it could be done, that the popularity of
the Protocols was based on admiration and eagerness to learn rather than
on hatred, and that
it would be wise
to stay as close
as possible to certain
of their outstanding formulas,
as
in the case of the famous slogan:
"Right
is what
is good for the German people," which was copied from the Proto-
cols'
"Everything
that
benefits
the
Jewish
people
is
morally
right
and
sacred."
""^
The Protocols are a very curious and noteworthy document in many re-
spects.
Apart from
their cheap Machiavellianism,
their
essential
political
characteristic
is that in their crackpot manner they touch on every important
political issue of the time. They are antinational in principle and picture the

It was the motif of a global conspiracy in the Protocols which appealed
most to the masses, for
it corresponded so well to the new power situation.

represented by
the Chevalier de

quotes
extensively from

him "mannequins"
of an "agence

the
agents of the Freemasons.
But
Free-
masonry
is only
the name which
his contemporaries have
given
to a

has existed
at

to attack

maining behind the scenes, manipulating the strings of the marionettes

venient

starts by
saying:

the same
constancy:

transcript of a session of the SS Committee on Labor Questions
at SS headquarters in Berlin on January
12,
1943, where
it was suggested that the word
"nation," a concept
being burdened with connotations of
liberalism, should be
elimi-
nated as
it was inadequate for the Germanic peoples (Document 705—PS in Nazi Con-
spiracy and Aggression, V, 515).

made within the SS to erase the word "nation" from the National Socialist
vixrabulary altogether.) Only world powers seemed
still to have a chance of
independent
survival and only
global
politics
a chance
of
lasting
results.
That
this situation should frighten the smaller nations which are not world
powers
is only
too understandable. The
Protocols seemed
to show
a way
out
that did not depend upon objective unalterable conditions, but only on
the power of organization.
Nazi propaganda,
in other words, discovered
in
"the
supranational
be-
cause
intensely
national Jew"*^
the
forerunner
of
the German
master
of
the world and assured the masses that "the nations that have been the
first
to see through the Jew and have been the first to fight him are going to take
his place
in
the domination
of the
world."-*" The delusion
of an
already
existing Jewish world domination formed the basis for the illusion of future
German world domination. This was what Himmler had
in mind when he
stated
that "we owe
the
art
of government
to
the Jews," namely,
to
the
ProtcKols which "the FiJhrer [had]
learned by heart." ^" Thus the Protocols
presented world conquest
as
a
practical
possibility, implied that the whole
affair was only
a question of inspired or shrewd know-how, and
that no-
body stood
in
the way of
a German
victory over
the
entire world but
a
patently small p)eople, the Jews, who ruled
it without possessing instruments
of violence—an easy opponent, therefore, once their secret was discovered
and
their method emulated on
a larger
scale.
Nazi propaganda concentrated
all these new and promising vistas in one
concept which
it
labeled Volksgemeinschajt.
This new community,
tenta-
tively realized
in the Nazi movement in the pretotalitarian atmosphere, was
based on the absolute equality of all Germans, an equality not of rights but
of nature, and
their absolute
difference from
all other people.^'
After the
Nazis came
to power,
this concept gradually
lost
its importance and gave
way
to
a general contempt
for the German people
(which the Nazis had
always
harbored
but
could
not
very
well show
publicly
before)

hand,''- and a great eagerness, on the other, to enlarge their own ranks from

"Aryans" of other nations, an idea which had played only a small role in
the
prepower
stage
of
Nazi
propaganda. ^^
The
Volksgemeinschaft
was
merely the propagandistic preparation for an "Aryan"
racial society which
in the end would have doomed
all peoples, including the Germans.
To
a
certain
extent,
the
Volksgemeinschaft was
the
Nazis'
attempt
to
counter the Communist promise of a classless society. The propaganda ap-
peal of the one over the other seems obvious
if we disregard
all ideological
implications. While both promised to level all social and property differences,
the classless society had the obvious connotation that everybody would be
leveled to the status of a factory worker, while the Volksgemeinschaft, with
its connotation
of conspiracy
for world
conquest,
held
out
a
reasonable
hope that every German could eventually become a factory owner. The even
greater advantage of the Volksgemeinschaft, however, was that
its establish-
ment did not have to wait for some future time and did not depend upon
objective conditions:
it could be realized immediately in the fictitious world
of the movement.
The true goal of totalitarian propaganda
is not persuasion but organiza-
tion—the "accumulation of power without the possession of the means of
violence." ^^ For
this
purpose,
originality
in
ideological
content can only
be considered an unnecessary obstacle.
It is no accident that the two totali-
tarian movements of our time, so frightfully "new" in methods of rule and
ingenious
in forms
of organization, have never preached
a new
doctrine,
have never invented an ideology which was not already popular.^"' Not the
passing successes of demagogy win the masses, but the
visible
reality and
power of a "living organization."^" Hitler's brilliant
gifts
as a mass orator
did not win him
his
position
in the movement but
rather misled
his op-
ponents into underestimating him
as a simple demagogue, and Stalin was
able to defeat the greater orator of the Russian Revolution.^^ What distin-
German nation and extracting the steel from
this people. And
I have often stated that
the time will come when all worth-while men in Germany are going to be in my camp.
And
those who
will
not
be
in my camp
are
worthless anyway." Even
then
it was
clear to Hitler's immediate environment what would happen to those who "are worth-
less anyway"
(see Der grossdeutsche Freiheitskampf. Reden Hitlers vom
I.
9. 1939—
10.

1940,
p.
174).—Himmler meant the same when he said: "The Fiihrer does not
think
in German,
but
in Germanic terms"
(Dossier
Kersten,
cf. above), except that
we know from
Hitlers Tischgesprdvhe
(p. 315
ff.)
that
in
those days he was already
making fun even of the Germanic "clamor" and thought in "Aryan terms."

at Kharkov
in April,

"I

indication
of
this
non-national
policy was
given
by
Hitler

TOTALITARIANISM
guishcs
the
totalitarian
leaders and
dictators
is
rather
the simple-minded,
single-minded purposefulness with which they choose those elements from
existing
ideologies which
are
best
fitted
to become
the fundaments of an-
other, entirely fictitious world. The fiction of the Protocols was as adequate
as the
fiction of a Trotskyite conspiracy, for both contained an element of
plausibility—the nonpublic influence of the Jews in the past; the struggle for
power between Trotsky and
Stalin—which not even the
fictitious world of
totalitarianism can safely do without. Their art consists in using, and at the
same time transcending, the elements of reality, of verifiable experiences, in
the chosen
fiction, and
in
generalizing them
into
regions which
then
are
definitely removed from
all possible control by individual experience. With
such generalizations, totalitarian propaganda establishes a world
fit to com-
pete with the
real one, whose main handicap
is that
it
is not
logical, con-
sistent, and organized. The consistency of the
fiction and
strictness of the
organization make
it possible for the generalization eventually to survive the
explosion of more
specific
lies—the power of the Jews
after their helpless
slaughter, the sinister global conspiracy of Trotskyites after their liquidation
in Soviet Russia and the murder of Trotsky.
The
stubbornness
with which
totalitarian
dictators have clung
to
their
original
lies
in the face of absurdity
is more than superstitious gratitude to
what turned the trick, and, at least in the case of Stalin, cannot be explained
by the psychology of the liar whose very success may make him his own last
victim. Once these propaganda slogans are integrated into a "living organiza-
tion," they cannot be safely eliminated without wrecking the whole structure.
The assumption of a Jewish world conspiracy was transformed by
totali-
tarian propaganda from an objective, arguable matter into the chief element
of the Nazi
reality; the point was that the Nazis acted as though the world
were dominated by the Jews and needed a counterconspiracy to defend itself.
Racism
for them was no
longer
a
debatable
theory
of dubious
scientific
value, but was being realized every day
in the functioning hierarchy
of a
political organization in whose framework
it would have been very "unreal-
istic" to question
it. Similarly, Bolshevism no longer needs to win an argu-
ment about
class
struggle,
internationalism, and unconditional dependence
of the
welfare of the
proletariat on
the welfare of the
Soviet Union;
the
functioning
organization
of
the Comintern
is more
convincing
than
any
argument or mere ideology can ever be.
Weber's category of the "charismatic leadership." See Hans Gerth, "The Nazi Party,"
in American Journal of
Sociolof-y,
1940,
Vol. XLV. (A
similar misunderstanding
is
also
the
shortcoming
of
Heiden's
biography,
op.
cit.)
Gerth
describes
Hitler
as
the
charismatic
leader of a bureaucratic party. This alone,
in his opinion, can account for
the
fact
that "however
flagrantly actions may have contradicted words, nothing could
disrupt
the firmly disciplinary organization."
(This contradiction, by the way,
is much
more
characteristic
of
Stalin who "took
care always
to say
the
opposite of what he
did, and to do the opposite of what he said." Souvarine, op.
cit., p. 431.)
For the source of this misunderstanding see Alfred von Martin, "Zur Soziologie der

fiir Kiilturgeschichte, Band
27, and Arnold Koettgen, "Die
Gcsclzmassigkeit
der
Verwaltung
im
Fuhrerstaat,"
in
Reichsverwaltungsblatt,
1936,
both of whom characterize the Nazi state as a bureaucracy with charismatic leadership.

THE TOTALITARIAN MOVEMENT
363
The fundamental
reason
for
the
superiority
of
totalitarian propaganda
over the propaganda of other parties and movements
is that
its content, for
the members of the movement
at any
rate,
is no longer an objective
issue
about which people may have opinions, but has become as real and untouch-
able an element in their lives as the rules of arithmetic. The organization of
the entire texture of
life according to an ideology can be
fully carried out
only under a totalitarian regime. In Nazi Germany, questioning the validity
of racism and antisemitism when nothing mattered but race origin, when a
career depended upon an "Aryan" physiognomy (Himmler used
to
select
the applicants for the SS from photographs) and the amount of food upon
the number of one's Jewish grandparents, was like questioning the existence
of the world.
The advantages of a propaganda that constantly "adds the power of or-
ganization" ^'" to the feeble and unreliable voice of argument, and thereby
realizes, so to speak, on the spur of the moment, whatever
it says, are ob-
vious beyond demonstration. Foolproof against arguments based on a reality
which the movements promised to change, against a counterpropaganda dis-
qualified by the mere fact that
it belongs to or defends
a world which the
shiftless masses cannot and will not accept,
it can be disproved only by an-
other, a stronger or better, reality.
It
is
in the moment of defeat that the inherent weakness of totalitarian
propaganda becomes visible. Without the force of the movement,
its mem-
bers cease
at once
to believe
in the dogma
for which yesterday they
still
were ready to sacrifice
their
lives. The moment the movement, that
is, the
fictitious
world which
sheltered them,
is
destroyed,
the
masses
revert
to
their old status of isolated individuals who either happily accept a new func-
tion in a changed world or sink back into their old desperate superfluous-
ness. The members of totalitarian movements,
utterly
fanatical
as long
as
the movement exists, will not follow the example of religious fanatics and die
the death of martyrs
(even though they were only too
willing
to
die
the
death of robots)."''* Rather they will quietly give up the movement as a bad
bet and look around for another promising fiction or wait until the former
fiction regains enough strength to establish another mass movement.
The experience of the Allies who vainly tried to locate one self-confessed
and convinced Nazi among the German people, 90 per cent of whom prob-
ably had been sincere sympathizers
at one time
or
another,
is not
to be
taken simply
as a sign of human weakness or gross opportunism. Nazism
as an ideology had been so fully "realized" that
its content ceased to exist
"'" Hadamovsky, op.
tit.,
p.
21. For totalitarian purposes
it
is a mistake to propagate
their ideology through teaching or persuasion.
In
the words of Robert Ley,
it can be
neither "taught"
nor
"learned,"
but
only
"exercised" and
"practiced"
(see Der Weg
zur Onlensburg, undated).
^''•' R. Hoehn, one of the outstanding Nazi
political
theorists, interpreted
this lack of
a doctrine or even a common set of ideals and beliefs in the movement in his Reichsge-
meinscliaft und
Volksgemeinschujt.

"From

Totalilnrian
Organization
THE loRMS OF
totalitarian organization,
as
distinguished from
their ideo-
logical
content and propaganda
slogans,
are completely
new.<^o They
are
designed
to translate the propaganda
lies of the movement, woven around
a central
fiction—the conspiracy
of the
Jews,
or
the
Trotskyites,
or 300
families, etc.—into a functioning
reality, to build up, even under nontotali-
tarian circumstances, a society whose members
act and
react according to
the rules of a fictitious world. In contrast with seemingly similar parties and
movements of Fascist or Socialist, nationalist or Communist orientation,
all
of which back up
their propaganda
with
terrorism
as soon
as
they have
reached
a certain stage of extremism (which mostly depends on the stage
of
dcsF>cration
of
their members),
the
totalitarian movement
is
really
in
earnest about
its propaganda, and this earnestness
is expressed much more
frightcningly
in the organization of
its followers than in the physical
liqui-
dation of
its opponents. Organization and propaganda
(rather than
terror
and propaganda)
are two
sides of the same
coin."^
The most strikingly new organizational device of the movements in their
prepower stage
is the creation of front organizations, the distinction drawn
between
party members
and
sympathizers. Compared
to
this
invention,
other typically totalitarian features, such as the appointment of functionaries
from above and the eventual monopolization of appointments by one man
are secondary
in
importance. The
so-called
"leader principle"
is
in
itself
not totalitarian;
it has borrowed certain features from authoritarianism and
military dictatorship which have greatly contributed toward obscuring and
belittling
the
essentially
totalitarian phenomenon.
If
the
functionaries
ap-
pointed from above possessed
real
authority and
responsibility, we would
have to do with
a hierarchical structure
in which authority and power are
delegated and governed by laws. Much the same
is true for the organization
of an army and the
military dictatorship established
after
its model; here,
absolute power of command from
the
top down and
absolute obedience
from the bottom up correspond to the situation of extreme danger in combat,
which
is precisely why they are not totalitarian. A hierarchically organized
chain of command means that the commander's power
is dependent on the
whole
hierarchic system
in which he operates. Every hierarchy, no matter

mils as a matter of course that the Nazis took over from other groups and parties the
"racial

(die vdlkische Idee) and acted as though they were
its only representa-
tives because they were the
first to base a fighting organization on
it and to formulate

how authoritarian in
its direction, and every chain of command, no matter
how
arbitrary or
dictatorial
the
content
of
orders,
tends
to
stabilize and
would have restricted the
total power of the leader of a totalitarian move-
ment."- In the language
of the
Nazis,
the
never-resting, dynamic
"will of
the Fuehrer"—and not
his orders,
a phrase
that might imply
a fixed and
circumscribed
authority—becomes
the
"supreme
law"
in
a
totalitarian
state."^
It
is only from
the
position
in which
the
totalitarian movement,
thanks
to
its unique organization,
places
the leader—only from
his func-
tional
importance
for
the movement—that
the
leader
principle
develops
its
totalitarian character.
This
is
also borne out by
the
fact
that both
in
Hitler's and Stalin's case the actual leader principle crystallized only rather
slowly, and parallel with the progressive
"totalitarianization" of the move-
ment."^
An anonymity which contributes
greatly to the weirdness of the whole
phenomenon clouds the beginnings of this new organizational structure. We
do not know who
first decided to organize fellow-travelers into front organ-
izations, who
first saw
in vaguely
sympathizing masses—upon whom
all
parties used to count
at election day but whom they considered to be too
fluctuating for membership—not only a reservoir from which to draw party
members, but a decisive force
in
itself. The early Communist-inspired or-
•'- Himmler's vehemently
urgent
request
"not
to
issue
any
decree
concerning
the
definition of
the term
'Jew' "
is a case
in
point;
for "with

in

party machine were
a
question of accumulation of personal power.
(Yet,
it was only
in the
thirties, after he
had studied
Hitler's example, that he
let himself be addressed as "leader.")
It must be
admitted,
however,
that
he
could
easily
justify
these
methods
by
quoting
Lenin's
theory
that "the
history of
all countries shows
that the working
class,
exclusively by
its own
effort,
is able to develop only trade-union consciousness," and that
its leader-
ship therefore necessarily comes from without. (See What is to be done?,
first published
in
1902,
in Collected Works,
Vol.
IV, Book
II.) The point
is
that Lenin considered
the Communist Party as the "most progressive" part of the working
class and
at the
same time
"the
lever of
political organization" which
"directs the whole mass of the
proletariat."
i.e., an organization outside and above the class. (See W. H. Chamberlin,
The Russian
Revolution,
1917-1921, New
York,
1935,
II.
361.)
Nevertheless, Lenin
did not question the validity of inner-party democracy, though he was inclined to
re-
strict democracy to the working class
itself.

TOTALITARIANISM
ganizations of sympathizers, such as the Friends of the Soviet Union or the
Red
Relief associations, developed
into
front
organizations but were
orig-
inally nothing more or less than what their names indicated:
a gathering of
sympathizers for financial or other (for instance, legal)
help. Hitler was the
first to say that each movement should divide the masses which have been
won through propaganda
into two
categories,
sympathizers and members.
This in itself is interesting enough; even more significant
is that he based this
division upon a more general philosophy according to which most people are
too lazy and cowardly for anything more than mere theoretical insight, and
only
a
minority want to
fight
for
their
convictions."'"
Hitler, consequently,
was the
first to devise a conscious policy of constantly enlarging the ranks of
sympathizers while
at the same time keeping the number of party members
strictly limited.'"' This notion of a minority of party members surrounded by
a
majority of sympathizers comes very
close
to
the
later
reality
of
front
organizations—a
term
which
indeed
expresses
most
aptly
their
eventual
function, and indicates the relationship between members and sympathizers
within the movement
itself. For the front organizations of sympathizers are
no
less essential
to
the functioning of the movement than
its
actual mem-
bership.
The
front
organizations
surround
the
movements'
membership
with
a
protective
wall which
separates them from
the
outside, normal
world;
at
the same time, they form
a bridge back into normalcy, without which
the
members
in the prepower stage would
feel too sharply the
differences be-
tween their beliefs and those of normal people, between the lying fictitious-
ness of their own and the reality of the normal world. The ingeniousness of
this device during the movements' struggle for power
is
that the front or-
ganizations not only isolate the members but offer them a semblance of out-
side normalcy which wards
of! the impact of true
reality more
etifectively
than mere indoctrination.
It
is the difference between his own and the
fel-
low-traveler's attitudes which confirms a Nazi or Bolshevik in
his belief in
the
fictitious explanation of the world, for the fellow-traveler has the same
convictions,
after
all,
albeit
in
a more "normal,"
i.e.,
less
fanatic, more
confused form; so that to the party member
it appears that anyone whom
the movement has not expressly singled out
as an enemy
(a Jew,
a capi-
talist, etc.)
is on
his side, that the world
is full of secret
allies who merely
cannot, as yet, summon up the necessary strength of mind and character to
draw the logical conclusions from their own convictions."^

THE TOTALITARIAN MOVEMENT
361
The world
at large, on the other side, usually gets
its
first glimpse of
a
totalitarian movement
through
its
front
organizations. The
sympathizers,
who are to
all appearances
still innocuous fellow-citizens in a nontotalitarian
society,
can
hardly
be
called
single-minded
fanatics;
through
them,
the
movements make their fantastic
lies more generally acceptable, can spread
their propaganda
in
milder, more
respectable
forms,
until
the whole
at-
mosphere
is poisoned
with
totalitarian elements which
are
hardly
recog-
nizable as such but appear to be normal political reactions or opinions. The
fellow-traveler
organizations
surround
the
totalitarian movements
with
a
mist of normality and
respectability
that
fools
the membership
about
the
true character of the outside world
as much
as
it does
the
outside world
about the true character of the movement. The front organization functions
both ways:
as
the
fagade
of
the
totalitarian movement
to
the
nontotali-
tarian world, and as the fagade of this world to the inner hierarchy of the
movement.
Even more
striking than
this
relationship
is the
fact
that
it
is repeated
on different levels within the movement
itself. As party members are related
to and separated from the fellow-travelers, so are the elite formations of the
movement related to and separated from the ordinary members.
If the
fel-
low-traveler
still appears
to be
a normal
inhabitant
of
the
outside world
who has adopted the
totalitarian creed
as one may adopt the program of
an ordinary party, the ordinary member of the Nazi or Bolshevik movement
still belongs,
in many
respects,
to the surrounding world:
his
professional
and social relationships are not yet absolutely determined by his party mem-
bership, although he may
realize—as distinguished from
the mere sympa-
thizer—that
in case of conflict between his party allegiance and his private
life, the former
is supposed to be decisive. The member of a militant group,
on the other hand,
is wholly identified with the movement; he has no pro-
fession
and
no
private
life
independent
of
it.
Just
as
the
sympathizers
constitute
a
protective
wall
around
the members
of
the movement
and
represent the outside world to them, so the ordinary membership surrounds
the militant groups and represents the normal outside world to them.
A definite advantage of this structure
is that
it blunts the impact of one of
the basic totalitarian tenets—that the world
is divided into two gigantic hos-
tile camps, one of which
is the movement, and that the movement can and
must fight the whole world—a claim which prepares the way for the
indis-
criminate aggressiveness of totalitarian regimes
in power. Through
a care-
fully graduated hierarchy of militancy in which each rank is the higher level's
image of the nontotalitarian world because
it
is
less militant and
its mem-
bers less totally organized, the shock of the terrifying and monstrous totali-
tarian dichotomy
is
vitiated and never
full
realized;
this type of organiza-
tion prevents
its members' ever being directly confronted with the outside
world, whose hostility remains for them a mere ideological assumption. They
are so well protected
against the
reality of
the
nontotalitarian world
that
they constantly underestimate
the tremendous
risks of totalitarian
politics.
There
is no doubt that the totalitarian movements attack the
status quo

niotv
radically than did any of the earlier revolutionary
parties. They can
afford this radicalism, apparently so unsuited to mass organizations, because
their
orjianization
offers
a temporary
substitute
for ordinary,
nonpolitical
life, which
totalitarianism
actually
seeks
to
abolish. The
whole
world
of
non[x>li(ical social relationships, from which the "professional revolutionary"
had to cut himself off or had to accept
as they were,
exists
in the form of
less
militant groups
in
the movement; within
this
hierarchically organized
world
the
fighters
for world conquest and world
revolution
are never ex-
posed to the shock inevitably generated by the discrepancy between "revolu-
tionary" beliefs and the "normal" world. The reason why the movements in
their prepower, revolutionary stage can attract so many ordinary
philistines
is that
their members
live
in a fool's paradise of normalcy; the party mem-
bers
are surrounded
by
the
normal
world
of
sympathizers and
the
elite
formations by the normal world of ordinary members.
Another advantage of the
totalitarian pattern
is that
it can be repeated
indefinitely and keeps the organization in a state of fluidity which permits
it
constantly
to
insert new
layers and
define new degrees
of militancy. The
whole
history
of
the Nazi
party can be
told
in terms
of new formations
within the Nazi movement. The SA, the stormtroopers (founded in 1922),
were the
first Nazi formation which was supposed to be more militant than
the party
itself;''^ in 1926, the SS was founded as the elite formation of the
SA;
after three
years,
the SS was
separated from
the SA and
put under
Himmler's command;
it took Himmler only a few more years to repeat the
same game within the SS. One after the other, and each more militant than
its predecessor, there now came into being,
first, the Shock Troops,"'' then
the Death Head
units
(the "guard
units
for
the
concentration camps"),
which
later were merged
to form the Armed SS
(Waffen-SS),
finally
the
Security Service
(the "ideological intelligence service of the Party," and
its
executive arm for the "negative population policy") and the Office for Ques-
tions of Race and Resettlement (Rasse-und Siedlungswesen)
, whose tasks
were of a "positive kind"— all of them developing out of the General
SS,
whose members,
except
for
the
higher Fuehrer Corps, remained
in
their
civilian occupations. To
all these new formations the member of the Gen-
eral SS now stood in the same
relationship
as the SA-man to the SS-man,
or the party member to the SA-man, or the member of a front organization
to a party member.'" Now the General SS was charged not only with "safe-

In
the course of the war, when
the ranks of the Waffen-SS had to
be
filled with enlistments owing to losses at the front, the Waffen-SS lost
its elite char-
acter within the SS to such an extent that now the General SS,

"protecting the members of
all
special SS cadres from becoming detached
from the movement
itself."^'
This
fluctuating hierarchy, with
its constant addition of new
layers and
shifts in authority, is well known from secret control bodies, the secret police
or espionage
services, where new
controls
are
always needed
to
control
the controllers. In the prepower stage of the movements,
total espionage
is
not
yet
possible;
but
the
fluctuating
hierarchy,
similar
to
that
of
secret
services, makes
it possible, even without actual power, to degrade any rank
or group that wavers or shows signs of decreasing radicalism by the mere
insertion of a new more radical layer, hence driving the older group auto-
matically in the direction of the front organization and away from the center
of
the movement.
Thus,
the Nazi
elite
formations were
primarily
inner-
party organizations:
the SA rose to the position of a superparty when the
party appeared to lose
in
radicality and was then
in turn and for similar
reasons superseded by the SS.
The
military value of the
totalitarian
elite formations,
especially of the
SA and the SS, are frequently overrated, while their purely inner-party
sig-
nificance has been somewhat neglected."^- None of the Fascist Shirt-organiza-
tions was founded for specific defensive or aggressive purposes, though de-
fense of the leaders or the ordinary party members usually was cited
as a
went about
its
recruiting
both among
foreign workers and
the
native
population by
deliberately imitating the methods and rules of the French Foreign Legion. Enlistment
among
the Germans was
based on an
order by
Hitler
(never published)
dated De-
cember,
1942, according to which "the 1925 class [should] be drafted into the Waffen-
SS" (Himmler
in
a
letter
to Bormann).
Conscription
and
enlistment
were
handled
ostensibly on
a
voluntary
basis.
Precisely what
this amounted
to can
be
seen from
numerous reports of SS leaders entrusted with
this assignment. A report dated July 21,
1943,
describes how
the police surround the
hall
in which French workers are
to be
enlisted, how
the French
first
sing
the MurseiUuise and
then
try
to jump
out of the
windows.
Attempts among German youth were
scarcely more encouraging. Although
they
were
put
under
extraordinary
pressure
and
told
that
"they
certainly
would
not want
to join
the
'dirty gray hordes'" of the army, only
18
out of 220 members
of the
Hitler youth
reported
for duty
(according
to a
report of April
30,
1943,
sub-
mitted
by
Haussler,
head
of
Conscription
Center
Southwest
of
the
Waffen-SS);
all
others preferred
to
join
the Wehrmacht.
It
is
possible
that
the
greater
losses of
the
SS, as compared with those of the Wehrmacht, entered into their decisions (see Karl O.
Paetel,
"Die
SS,"
in
Vierteljalireshefte
fi'ir
Zeitgeschichte,
January,
1954).
But
that
this factor alone could not have been decisive
is proved by the following: As early as
January,
1940,
Hitler had
ordered
the
drafting
of SA-men
into
the
Waffen-SS, and
the
results for Koenigsberg, based on a report that has been preserved, were
listed as
follows:
1807 SA-men were
called up
"for
police
service"; of
these,
1094
failed
to
report; 631 were found to be
unfit; 82 were
fit
for service
in the SS.

'^ This,
however,
was
not
the
fault
of
Hitler, who
always
insisted
that
the
very
name of the SA
(Stiirmahlcilung)
indicated
that
it was only "a section
of the move-
ment"
just
like other party formations such
as the propaganda department,
the news-
paper, the

institutes,

tried to dispel
the
illusions of the possible
military value of a paramilitary formation and wanted training to be carried through

the needs of the party and
not according to the

result of their being founded

a troop of well-trained soldiers. The SA and the
SS were
certainly model
organizations
for
arbitrary
violence and murder;
they were hardly
as
well trained
as
the Black Reichswehr, and they were
not equipped for a
fight against regular troops.
Militaristic propaganda was
more popular in postwar Germany than military training, and uniforms did
not enhance the military value of paramilitary troops, though they were use-
ful
as
a clear indication of the
abolition
of civilian standards and morals;
somehow
these
uniforms eased
considerably
the
consciences
of
the mur-
derers and also made them even more receptive to unquestioning obedience
and unquestioned
authority. Despite these
militaristic trappings, the inner-
party faction of the Nazis, which was primarily nationalistic and militaristic
and therefore viewed the paramilitary troops not
as mere party formations
but as an
illegal enlargement of the Reichswehr (which had been limited by
the terms
of
the
Versailles Peace Treaty), was
the
first
to be
liquidated.
Rohm,
the
leader
of
the SA
stormtroopers, had
indeed dreamed
of and
negotiated for incorporation of his SA into the Reichswehr after the Nazis
seized power. He was killed by Hitler because he tried to transform the new
Nazi regime
into a military
dictatorship.'^*' Hitler had made
it clear several

those of the
Nazis. He always desired
a

insisted on

(op.

p. 349).
Especially
telling
for
his
nontotalitarian
attitude, or rather for
his
inability even
to understand
totalitarian-
ism and
its "total" claim,
is the following passage:
"I don't see why the following three
things should

loyalty
to the hereditary
prince of the house of
Wittelsbach and
heir to
Bavaria's crown; my admiration for the quartermaster-general

man
people;
and my
comradeship
with

harbinger
and
bearer
of

struggle. Adolf Hitler"
(p.
348). What
ultimately
cost Rohm
his head was that after
the
seizure
of power
he
envisioned
a
Fascist
dictatorship
patterned
after
the
Italian
regime,
in which
the Nazi
party would
"break
the
chains

"itself

state," which was
exactly what
Hitler meant
to avoid under
all
circum-
stances. See Ernst Rohm, Wariim SA?, speech before the diplomatic corps, December,
1933.
Berlin,
undated.
Within
the Nazi
party, the possibility of an SA-Reichswehr plot against the rule of
the SS and
the
police apparently
never was
quite
forgotten. Hans
Frank, Governor
General
of
Poland,
in
1942,
eight
years
after
the murder
of Rohm
and
General
Schleicher, was
suspected
of
wishing
"after

.
.
.
to
inaugurate
the
greatest
fight
for
justice
[against
the
SS]
with
the
assistance
of
the Armed
Forces and
the
SA
(Nan Conspiracy, VI, 747).

THE TOTALITARIAN MOVEMENT
371
years before that such
a development was not desired by the Nazi move-
ment when he dismissed Rohm—a real soldier whose experience
in the war
and
in
the
organization
of
the
Black Reichswehr would have made him
indispensable to
a serious
military training program—from
his
position
as
chief of the SA and chose Himmler, a man without the slightest knowledge
of military matters, as reorganizer of the SS.
Apart from the importance of the
elite formations
to the organizational
structure of the movement, where
they comprised
the changing
nuclei
of
militancy,
their
paramilitary
character must be
understood
in
connection
with
other
professional
party
organizations,
such
as
those
for
teachers,
lawyers, physicians, students, university professors, technicians, and workers.
All these were primarily duplicates of existing nontotalitarian
professional
societies,
paraprofessional
as
the
stormtroopers were
paramilitary.
It was
characteristic
that
the more
clearly
the European Communist
parties
be-
came branches of a Moscow-directed Bolshevik movement, the more they,
too, used their front organizations
to compete with
existing purely profes-
sional groups. The difference between the Nazis and the Bolsheviks
in
this
respect was only that the Nazis had a pronounced tendency to consider these
paraprofessional formations
as
part of the party
elite, while
the Commu-
nists preferred to recruit from them the material for their front organizations.
The
important
factor
for
the movements
is
that,
even
before
they
seize
power, they give the impression that
all elements of society are embodied in
their ranks.
(The
ultimate
goal of Nazi propaganda was
to
organize
the
whole German people as sympathizers."^) The Nazis went one step further
in
this game and
set up a
series of fake departments which were modeled
after the regular state administration, such as their own department of for-
eign
affairs,
education,
culture,
sport,
etc. None
of these
institutions had
more professional value than the imitation of the army represented by the
stormtroopers, but together they created a perfect world of appearances in
which every reality in the nontotalitarian world was slavishly duplicated in
the form of humbug.
This technique of duplication, certainly useless for the
direct overthrow
of government, proved extremely
fruitful
in the work
of undermining
ac-
tively existing institutions and
in the "decomposition of the
status
quo"''*
which totalitarian organizations invariably prefer to an open show of force.
If
it
is the task of movements "to bore their way like polyps
into
all posi-
tions of power," '^^ then they must be ready for any
specific social and po-
litical
position.
In accordance with
their claim
to
total domination,
every
single organized group
in
the
nontotalitarian
society
is
felt
to
present
a
specific challenge
to the movement
to
destroy
it; every one
needs,
so
to
speak, a specific instrument of destruction. The practical value of the fake
organizations came
to
light when the Nazis seized power and were ready

They
could
change
overnight
the
whole
structure
of German
society—and not just
political
life—precisely because they had prepared
its
exact counterpart
within
their own
ranks.
In
this
respect,
the task of the
paramilitary
formations was
finished when
the
regular
military
hierarchy
could be placed, during the
last stages of the war, under the authority of SS
generals. The technique of this "co-ordination" was as ingenious and
irre-
sistible as the deterioration of professional standards was swift and radical,
although
these
results were more immediately
felt
in
the
highly
technical
and specialized
field of warfare than anywhere
else.
If the importance of paramilitary formations for totalitarian movements
is not
to be found
in
their doubtful
military value,
neither
is
it wholly
in
their fake imitation of the regular army. As
elite formations they are more
sharply separated from the outside world than any other group. The Nazis
realized
very
early
the
intimate
connection between
total
militancy
and
total separation from normality; the stormtroopers were never assigned
to
duty
in
their home communities, and
the
active cadres of the SA
in
the
prepower stage, and of the SS under the Nazi regime, were so mobile and
so frequently exchanged that they could not possibly get used to and take
root
in any other part of the ordinary world. ^'^ They were organized
after
the model of criminal gangs and used for organized murder.^' These mur-
ders
were
publicly
paraded
and
officially
admitted
by
the
upper
Nazi
hierarchy,
so that open complicity made
it well-nigh impossible for mem-
bers to quit the movement even under the nontotalitarian government and
even
if they were
not
threatened,
as
they
actually
were, by
their former
comrades.
In
this
respect, the function of the
elite formations
is the very
opposite of that of the front organizations:
while the
latter lend the move-
ment an
air of respectability and inspire confidence, the former, by extend-
ing complicity, make every party member aware that he has

THE TOTALITARIAN MOVEMENT

prepower stage, when the leadership systematically claims responsibility for
all crimes and leaves no doubt
that they
are committed
for
the
ultimate
good of the movement.
The
artificial creation of civil-war conditions by which the Nazis black-
mailed their way into power has more than the obvious advantage of stirring
up trouble. For the movement, organized violence
is the most
efficient of
the many protective walls which surround its fictitious world, whose "reality"
is proved when
a member fears leaving the movement more than he fears
the consequences of his complicity
in
illegal actions, and feels more secure
as a member than as an opponent. This feeling of security,
resulting from
the organized
violence
with which
the
elite
formations
protect
the
party
members from the
outside
world,
is
as important
to
the
integrity
of
the
fictitious world of the organization as the fear of its terror.
In the center of the movement,
as the motor that swings
it into motion,
sits the Leader. He
is separated from the elite formation by an inner circle
of the
initiated who spread around him an aura of impenetrable mystery
which corresponds to his "intangible preponderance."^^ His position within
this
intimate
circle depends upon
his
ability
to
spin
intrigues among
its
members and upon his
skill
in constantly changing
its personnel. He owes
his
rise to leadership
to an extreme
ability
to handle inner-party
struggles
for power rather than to demagogic or bureaucratic-organizational qualities.
He
is distinguished from
earlier types of dictators
in that he hardly wins
through simple violence. Hitler needed neither the SA nor the SS to secure
his position as leader of the Nazi movement; on the contrary, Rohm,
the
chief of the SA and able to count upon
its loyalty to his own person, was
one
of Hitler's inner-party enemies.
Stalin won
against Trotsky, who not
only had a far greater mass appeal but, as chief of the Red Army, held in his
hands the greatest power potential in Soviet Russia at the time.** Not Stalin,
but
Trotsky, moreover, was
the
greatest
organizational
talent,
the
ablest
bureaucrat of the Russian Revolution.^^ On the other hand, both Hitler and

their careers almost entirely
to questions of personnel, so that
after a few
years hardly any man of importance remained who did not owe his position
to them.""
Such personal
abilities, however, though an absolute prerequisite for the
first
stages of such a career and even
later
far from
insignificant,
are no
longer decisive when a totalitarian movement has been
built up, has estab-
lished
the
principle
that
"the
will
of the Fuehrer
is the
Party's law," and
when
its whole hierarchy has been efficiently trained for a single purpose
swiftly
to communicate the
will of the Leader to
all
ranks. When
this has
been achieved,
the Leader
is
irreplaceable because the whole complicated
structure
of
the movement would
lose
its
raison
d'etre
without
his com-
mands. Now, despite eternal cabals
in the inner clique and unending
shifts
of personnel, with their tremendous accumulation of hatred,
bitterness, and
personal resentment, the Leader's position can remain secure against chaotic
palace revolutions not because of his superior gifts, about which the men in
his intimate surroundings frequently have no great illusions, but because of
these
men's
sincere
and
sensible
conviction
that
without him
everything
would be immediately
lost.
The supreme task of the Leader
is
to impersonate
the double function
characteristic of each layer of the movement—to act as the magic defense of
the movement against the outside world; and
at the same
time,
to be
the
direct bridge by which the movement is connected with
it. The Leader repre-
sents the movement in a way totally different from
all ordinary party lead-
ers;
he claims
personal
responsibility
for every
action,
deed,
or
misdeed,
committed by any member or functionary in his
official capacity. This total
responsibility
is the most important organizational
aspect
of the
so-called
Leader principle, according to which every functionary
is not only appointed
by the Leader but
is his walking embodiment, and every order
is supposed
to emanate from
this one ever-present source. This thorough
identification
of the Leader with every appointed subleader and this monopoly of respon-
sibility for everything which
is being done
are
also
the most conspicuous
signs of the decisive difference between a totalitarian leader and an ordinary
dictator or despot. A tyrant would never identify himself with his subordi-
nates,
let alone with every one of their acts;" he might use them as scape-
""The circumstances surrounding
Stalin's death seem
to contradict
the
infallibility
of these methods. There
is the possibility that Stalin, who, before he died, undoubtedly
planned
still another general purge, was
killed by someone in
his environment because
no one
felt safe any longer, but despite a great deal of circumstantial evidence this can-
not be proved.
"'Thus
Hitler personally cabled
his
responsibility
for
the Potempa murder to
the
SA
assassms
in
1932, although presumably
he had
nothing whatever
to do
with
it.
What
mattered here was establishing a principle of identification,
or,
in the language
of the Nazis, "the mutual loyalty of the Leader and the people" on which "the Reich
rests

«/>. c(7.).

goats and
gladly have them
criticized
in order
to
save
himself from
the
wrath of the people, but he would always maintain an absolute distance from
all his subordinates and
all his subjects. The Leader, on the contrary, can-
not tolerate criticism of his subordinates, since they act always in his name;
if he wants to correct
his own errors, he must liquidate those who carried
them out;
if he wants to blame his mistakes on others, he must
kill
them.'*'*
For within
this organizational framework
a mistake can only be
a
fraud:
the impersonation of the Leader by an impostor.
This
total
responsibility for everything done by
the movement and
this
total
identification with every one of
its functionaries have
the very prac-
tical consequence that nobody ever experiences a situation in which he has
to be responsible for his own actions or can explain the reasons for them.
Since the Leader has monopolized the
right and possibility of explanation,
he appears to the outside world as the only person who knows what he
is
doing,
i.e.,
the only representative
of the movement with whom one may
still talk in nontotalitarian terms and who,
if reproached or opposed, cannot
say: Don't ask me, ask the Leader. Being in the center of the movement, the
Leader can act as though he were above
it.
It
is therefore perfectly under-
standable (and perfectly
futile)
for outsiders
to
set
their hopes time and
again on a personal
talk with the Leader himself when they have to deal
with totalitarian movements or governments. The real mystery of the totali-
tarian Leader
resides
in an organization which makes
it possible
for him
to assume the total responsibility for all crimes committed by the elite forma-
tions of the movement and to claim
at the same time, the honest, innocent
respectability of
its most naive fellow-traveler.^"
"" "One of Stalin's distinctive characteristics ...
is systematically
to throw
his own
misdeeds and
crimes,
as
well
as
his
political
errors ...
on
the
shoulders
of
those
whose discredit and ruin he
is plotting"
(Soiivarine, op.
cit..
p. 655).
It
is obvious that
a
totalitarian leader can choose
freely whom he wants
to impersonate
his own errors
since
all
acts committed
by
subleaders
are supposed
to
be
inspired
by
him,
so
that
anybody can be forced
into the
role of an impostor.

they were always more

the
proposals
made
by
his
immediate
environment;
that
even
Himmler
was
appalled when
he was
entrusted
with
the

of

Jewish
question

this

important
to remember

that
their
real
role—namely,
to
drive
the movement forward

if anything
to
step
up
its
speed—remains
carefully
concealed.

Admiral
Erich

in Nazi Cun-

to
the conclusion by
the conduct of the
Fuehrer
that

Fuehrer
himself. ...
In
the
course
of

years,
I
gradually came

TOTALITARIANISM
The totalitarian movements have been called "secret societies established
m broad

"'
Indeed,

sociological
struc-
ture and
the more
recent
history
of
secret

the
structure
of

if compared with

one of nothing so much
as of certain outstanding traits of secret
societies."'
Secret
societies
also form
hierarchies according to degrees
of

their members according

and
always
mysterious
leader, who himself
is surrounded, or supposed to be surrounded, by a small
group

in
turn
are
surrounded by
the
half-initiated who
form
a

In the inlraparly struggle which preceded
his rise to absolute power, Stalin was care-
ful always to pose as "the man of the golden mean" (see Deutscher, op.

hough
certainly no "man of compromise," he
never abandoned
this
role
altogether.
When,
for instance, in
1936 a foreign journalist questioned him about the movement's
aim
of world
revolution, he
replied: "We have
never had such plans and
intentions.

is the product of a misunderstanding ... a comic one, or rather a tragicomic
one"

Hitler, op.

II, chapter
ix, discusses extensively the pros and cons of secret
societies as models
for totalitarian movements.
His considerations actually
led him to
Koyrc's
conclusion,
i.e..
to
adopt
the
principles
of
secret
societies
without
their
secreliveness and
to
establish them
in "broad
daylight." There
was,
in
the prepower
stage
of
the movement, hardly anything which
the
Nazis
consistently
kept
secret.
It
was only during the war. when the Nazi regime became
fully totalitarianized and the
party
leadership found
itself surrounded from
all
sides by
the
military hierarchy on
which
it depended
for the conduct of the war, that the elite formations were instructed
in
no
uncertain
terms
to
keep
everything
connected
with
"final
solutions"—/.t.,
deportations
and
mass
exterminations—absolutely
secret.
This
was
also
the
time
when
Hitler began
to
act
like
the
chief
of
a band
of
conspirators,
but
not without
personally
announcing and
circulating
this
fact
explicitly.

Hitler

rules, which sound

hostility to the sur-
rounding
world,
is
very
different from
the
ordinary
parties'
tendency
to
divide people into those who belong and those who don't. Parties and open
societies
in general
will consider only those who expressly oppose them to
be their enemies, while
it has always been the principle of secret
societies
that "whosoever is not expressly included
is excluded." ^^ This esoteric prin-
ciple seems
to be
entirely
inappropriate
for mass
organizations;
yet
the
Nazis gave their members
at least the psychological equivalent for the
ini-
tiation ritual of secret societies when, instead of simply excluding Jews, from
membership, they demanded proof of non-Jewish descent from their mem-
bers and
set up a complicated machine to shed
light on the dark
ancestry
of some 80 million Germans.
It was of course a comedy, and even an ex-
pensive one, when 80 million Germans
set out
to look for Jewish grand-
fathers; yet everybody came out of the examination with the feeling that he
belonged to
a group of included which stood
against an imaginary
multi-
tude of ineligibles. The same principle
is confirmed in the Bolshevik move-
ment through repeated party purges which inspire in everybody who
is not
excluded a reaffirmation of his inclusion.
Perhaps the most striking similarity between the secret
societies and the
totalitarian movements
lies
in the
role of the
ritual. The marches around
the Red Square
in Moscow are
in
this
respect no
less
characteristic than
the pompous formalities of the Nuremberg party days. In the center of the
Nazi ritual was the so-called "blood banner," and in the center of the Bolshe-
vik ritual stands the mummified corpse of Lenin, both of which introduce a
strong element of idolatry into the ceremony. Such idolatry hardly
is proof
"' The
terms "sworn
brothers,"
"sworn
comrades,"
"sworn
community,"
etc.,
are
repeated ud nauseam
throughout
Nazi
hterature,
partly
because
of
their
appeal
to
juvenile romanticism which was widespread
in
the German youth movement.
It was
mainly Himmler who used these terms
in a more
definite sense, introduced them into
the
"central watchword" of the SS ("Thus we have
fallen
in
line and march forward
to a
distant
future following
the unchangeable laws
as a National
Socialist order of
Nordic men and
as a sworn community of
their
tribes [Sippen]"
see
D'Alquen,
op.
cit.) and gave them
their
articulate meaning of "absolute
hostility"
against
all
others
(see Simmel, op.
cit., p. 489): "Then when the mass of humanity of
1
to
1 '/a milliards
[sic!]
lines up
against
us,
the Germanic
people,

.
." See Himmler's
speech
at
the
meeting of the SS Major Generals
at
Posen, October
4,
1943, Nazi Conspiracy, IV,
558.
'^ Simmel,
op.
cit.,
p.
490.—This,
like
so many
other
principles, was adopted by
the Nazis after careful reflection on the implications of the "Protocols of the Elders of
Zion."
Hitler
said
as
early
as
1922:
"[The gentlemen
of
the
Right]
have
never
yet
understood
that
it
is not necessary
to be an enemy of
the Jew
to drag you one day
...
to the
scaffold ...
it
is quite enough
.
.
. not
to be a Jew: that
will secure the
scaffold for you"
(Hitler's Speeches,
p.
12). At that time, nobody could guess that this
particular form of propaganda actually meant: One day,
it will not be necessary to be
an enemy of ours
to be dragged
to the
scaffold;
it
will be
quite enough to be a Jew,
or, ultimately, a member of some other people, to be declared "racially unfit" by some
Health Commission. Himmler believed and preached that
the whole SS was based on
the
principle
that "we must
be
honest,
decent,
loyal
and comradely
to members
of
our own blood and nobody
else"

TOTALITARIANISM
—as
is sometimes asserted—of pseudoreligious or heretical tendencies. The
"idols"
are mere organizational
devices, famihar from
the
ritual of secret
societies, which
also^ used
to
frighten
their members
into
secretiveness by
means of frightful, awe-inspiring symbols.
It
is obvious that people are more
securely held together through the common experience of a secret ritual than
by the common sharing of the
secret
itself. That the
secret
of totalitarian
movements
is exposed
in broad
daylight does
not
necessarily change
the
nature of the
experience.'''^
These
similarities
are
not,
of course,
accidental; they cannot simply be
explained
by
the
fact
that
both
Hitler and
Stalin had been members
of
modern
secret
societies before
they became
totalitarian
leaders—Hitler
in
the secret service of the Reichswehr and Stalin
in the conspiracy section of
the Bolshevik
party. They
are
to some extent the
natural outcome
of the
conspiracy
fiction
of
totalitarianism whose
organizations
supposedly
have
been founded to counteract secret
societies—the
secret society of the Jews
or the conspiratory society of the Trotskyites. What
is remarkable in the to-
talitarian organizations
is
rather that they could adopt so many organiza-
tional devices of secret societies without ever trying to keep their own goal
a secret. That the Nazis wanted to conquer the world, deport "racially alien"
peoples
and
exterminate
those
of
"inferior
biological
heritage,"
that
the
Bolsheviks work for the world
revolution, was never a
secret; these aims,
on
the
contrary,
were
always
part of
their propaganda.
In
other
words,
the
totalitarian movements
imitate
all
the
paraphernalia
of the
secret
so-
cieties
but empty them
of the
only thing
that could
excuse, or was
sup-
posed to excuse, their methods—the necessity to safeguard
a secret.
In
this, as in so many other respects, Nazism and Bolshevism arrived
at
the same organizational
result from very different historical beginnings. The
Nazis started with the fiction of a conspiracy and modeled themselves, more
or less consciously,
after the example of the secret society of the Elders of
Zion. whereas the Bolsheviks came from a revolutionary party, whose aim
was one-party dictatorship, passed through a stage
in which the party was
"entirely
apart and above everything"
to the moment when the
Politburo
of
the
party
was
"entirely
apart
from
and
above
everything";'**'
finally
Stalin imposed upon
this party structure the
rigid
totalitarian
rules
of
its
conspiratory sector and only then discovered the need for a central
fiction
to maintain the iron discipline of a secret society under the conditions of a
mass organization. The Nazi development may be more logical, more con-
sistent
in
itself, but the history of the Bolshevik party offers a better
illus-
tration
of
the
essentially
fictitious
character
of
totalitarianism,
precisely
because the fictitious global conspiracies against and according to which the
Bolshevik conspiracy
is supposedly organized have not been
ideologically
fixed. They have changed—from the Trotskyites
to the 300 families, then
to various "imperialisms" and recently to "rootless cosmopolitanism"—and
were adjusted to passing needs; yet
at no moment and under none

most various circumstances has
it been possible for Bolshevism to do with-
out some such fiction.
The means by which
Stalin changed
the Russian one-party dictatorship
into a totalitarian regime and the revolutionary Communist parties
all over
the world
into totalitarian movements was
the
liquidation of factions,
the
abolition of inner-party democracy and the transformation of national Com-
munist parties into Moscow-directed branches of the Comintern. Secret so-
cieties
in general, and the conspiratory apparatus of revolutionary
parties
in
particular, have always been characterized by absence of factions, sup-
pression of dissident opinions, and absolute centralization of command. All
these measures have the obvious utilitarian purpose of protecting the mem-
bers against persecution and the society against treason; the total obedience
asked of each member and the absolute power in the hands of the chief were
only inevitable by-products of practical
necessities. The
trouble, however,
is that conspirators have an understandable tendency to think that the most
efficient methods in politics in general are those of conspiratory societies and
that
if one can apply them in broad daylight and support them with a whole
nation's instruments
of
violence,
the
possibilities
for power
accumulation
become
absolutely
limitless. ^^ The
conspiratory
sector
of
a
revolutionary
party can, as long as the party
itself
is
still intact, be likened to the role of
the army within an intact political body: although
its own rules of conduct
differ radically from those of the civilian body,
it serves, remains subject to,
and
is controlled by
it. Just as the danger of a military dictatorship
arises
when the army no longer serves but wants to dominate the body politic, so
the danger of totalitarianism arises when the conspiratory sector of a revolu-
tionary party emancipates
itself from the
control
of the party and
aspires
to leadership. This
is what happened
to the Communist
parties under the
Stalin regime. Stalin's methods were always typical of a man who came from
the conspiratory
sector of the
party:
his devotion
to
detail,
his emphasis
on the personal side of politics,
his ruthlessness
in the use and liquidation
of comrades and friends. His chief support in the succession struggle
after
Lenin's death came from the secret police "^ which
at that time had already
become one of the most important and powerful sections of the
party.^''
It
was only natural that the Cheka's sympathies should be with the representa-
tive of the conspiratory section, with the man who already looked upon
it
''' Souvarine,

TOTALITARIANISM
as a kind of secret society and therefore was
likely
to preserve and to ex-
pand
its
privileges.
The seizure of the Communist parties by
their conspiratory sector, how-
ever, was only the
first step
in their transformation into
totalitarian move-
ments.
It was not enough that the secret police
in Russia and
its agents in
the Communist parties abroad played the same role in the movement as the
elite formations which the Nazis had constituted in the form of paramilitary
troops. The
parties themselves had
to be transformed,
if
the
rule
of the
secret
police was to remain stable. Liquidation of factions and inner-party
democracy, consequently, was accompanied
in Russia by the admission of
large,
politically uneducated and "neutral" masses to membership, a policy
which was quickly followed by the Communist parties abroad after the Pop-
ular Front policy had
initiated
it.
Nazi
totalitarianism
started
with
a mass
organization which was
only
gradually dominated by
elite formations, while the Bolsheviks started with
elite formations and organized the masses accordingly. The
result was the
same
in both cases. The Nazis, moreover, because of their militaristic
tra-
dition and
prejudices,
originally modeled
their
elite
formations
after
the
army, while
the Bolsheviks from
the beginning endowed the
secret police
with the exercise of supreme power. Yet
after a few years
this
difference
too disappeared:
the chief of the SS became the chief of the secret police,
and
the SS formations were gradually incorporated
into and replaced the
former personnel of the Gestapo, even though
this personnel already con-
sisted of reliable Nazis. ^''^
It
is because of the essential
affinity between the functioning of a secret
society of conspirators and of the secret police organized to combat
it that
totalitarian regimes, based on a
fiction of global conspiracy and aiming
at
global
rule, eventually concentrate
all power in the hands of the police. In
the prepower stage, however, the
"secret
societies in broad daylight"
offer
other organizational advantages. The obvious contradiction between a mass
organization and an exclusive
society, which alone can be trusted to keep
a secret,
is of no importance compared with the fact that the very structure
of
secret
and conspiratory
societies
could
translate
the
totalitarian
ideo-
logical dichotomy—the blind hostility of the masses against the existing world
regardless of
its divergences and
differences—into an organizational
prin-
ciple. From the viewpoint of an organization which functions according to
the principle that v/hoever
is not included
is excluded, whoever
is not with
me
is against me, the world
at large
loses
all the nuances, differentiations,
and
pluralistic aspects which had
in any event become confusing and un-
'""Thc Gestapo was
set up by Goring
in
1933; Himmler was appointed
chief of
the Gestapo in
1934 and began at once to replace
its personnel with his SS-men; at the
end
of the war, 75 per cent of
all Gestapo agents were SS-men.
It must also be con-
sidered
that
the
SS
units
were
particularly
qualified
for
this
job
as Himmler had
organized them, even
in
the prepower
stage,
for espionage duty among
party mem-
bers (Hciden, op.

bearable to the masses who had lost their place and their orientation in
it.^**^
What inspired them with the unwavering loyalty of members of secret so-
cieties was not so much the
secret
as
the dichotomy between Us and
all
others. This could be kept intact by imitating the secret societies' organiza-
tional structure and emptying
it of
its
rational purpose
of safeguarding a
secret. Nor did
it matter
if
a conspiracy ideology was
the
origin of
this
development, as in the case of the Nazis, or a parasitic growth of the con-
spiratory sector of a revolutionary party,
as in the case of the Bolsheviks.
The
claim inherent
in
totalitarian organization
is
that everything
outside
the movement
is
"dying,"
a claim which
is
drastically
realized under the
murderous conditions of totalitarian rule, but which even in the prepower
stage appears plausible
to the masses who escape from disintegration and
disorientation into the fictitious home of the movement.
Totalitarian movements have proved time and again that they can com-
mand the same total loyalty in life and death which had been the prerogative
of secret and conspiratory
societies. ^''^ The complete absence of resistance
in a thoroughly trained and armed troop like the SA in the face of the mur-
der of a beloved leader (Rohm)
and hundreds of close comrades was a
curious
spectacle. At
that moment probably Rohm,
and
not
Hitler, had
the power of the Reichswehr behind him. But these incidents
in the Nazi
movement have by now been overshadowed by the ever-repeated spectacle
of self-confessed "criminals" in the Bolshevik parties. Trials based on absurd
confessions have become part of an internally all-important and externally
incomprehensible ritual. But, no matter how the victims are being prepared
today, this ritual owes
its existence to the probably unfabricated confessions
of the old Bolshevik guard in 1936. Long feefore the time of the Moscow
Trials men condemned to death would receive
their
sentences with
great
calm, an attitude "particularly prevalent among members of the Cheka." ^^^
So long as the movement exists,
its peculiar form of organization makes sure
that at least the elite formations can no longer conceive of a life outside the
closely
knit band
of men who,
even
if
they
are
condemned,
still
feel
superior to the
rest of the uninitiated world. And since
this organization's
exclusive aim has always been to deceive and fight and uUimately conquer
'°* It was probably one
of
the
decisive
ideological
errors of
Rosenberg, who
fell
from the Fuehrer's favor and
lost
his influence
in the movement to men
like Himm-
ler, Bormann, and even
Streicher,
that
his Myth
of
the
Twentieth Century admits a
racial
pluralism
from
which
only
the Jews were
excluded. He
thereby
violated
the
principle that whoever
is not included ("the Germanic people")
is excluded ("the mass
of humanity").

their
lives
if only
this helps
again
to fool
the world.*"*
The chief value, however, of the
secret or conspiratory
societies' organ-
iziitional
structure and moral
standards
for purposes of mass organization
docs not even
lie
in the inherent guarantees of unconditional belonging and
loyalty,
and
organizational
manifestation
of unquestioned
hostility
to
the
outside world, but
in
their unsurpassed capacity to establish and safeguard
the
fictitious world through consistent
lying. The whole
hierarchical
struc-
ture of totalitarian movements, from naive fellow-travelers
to party mem-
bers, elite formations, the intimate circle around the Leader, and the Leader
himself, could be described
in terms of a curiously varying mixture of gulli-
bility and cynicism with which each member, depending upon his rank and
standing
in the movement,
is expected to react to the changing lying
state-
ments of the
leaders and
the central unchanging ideological
fiction of the
movement.
A mixture of gullibility and cynicism had been an outstanding character-
istic of mob mentality before
it became an everyday phenomenon of masses.
In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world
the masses had
reached
the
point where they would,
at the same time, believe everything and nothing,
think
that everything was possible and that nothing was
true. The mixture
in
itself was remarkable enough, because
it spelled the end of the
illusion
that gullibility was a weakness of unsuspecting primitive souls and cynicism
the
vice of superior and
refined minds. Mass propaganda discovered
that
its audience was ready
at
all times to believe the worst, no matter how ab-
surd,
and
did
not
particularly
object
to
being
deceived
because
it
held
every
statement
to
be
a
lie anyhow. The
totalitarian mass
leaders based
their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such
conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one
day, and trust that
if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their
falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the lead-
ers who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known
all along
that the statement was a
lie and would admire the leaders for their superior
tactical cleverness.
What had been a demonstrable reaction of mass audiences became an im-
portant
hierarchical
principle
for mass
organizations. A
mixture
of
gulli-
bility and cynicism
is prevalent
in
all ranks of totalitarian movements, and
the higher the rank the more cynicism weighs down
gullibility. The essen-
tial conviction shared by
all
ranks, from
fellow-traveler
to
leader,
is
that
politics
is
a game
of cheating and
that
the
"first commandment"
of
the
movement: "The Fuehrer
is always right,"
is as necessary for the purposes
of world politics,
i.e., world-wide cheating, as the rules of military discipline
are for the purposes of war.

THE TOTALITARIAN MOVEMENT
383
The machine that generates, organizes, and spreads the monstrous false-
hoods
of totaHtarian movements depends
again upon
the
position
of
the
Leader. To the propaganda assertion that
all happenings
are
scientifically
predictable according
to the laws of nature or economics,
totalitarian
or-
ganization adds the position of one man who has monopolized
this knowl-
edge and whose
principal
quality
is
that
he
"was
always
right
and
will
always be right." ''^" To a member of a totalitarian movement this knowledge
has nothing
to do with truth and
this being
right nothing
to do with
the
objective truthfulness of the Leader's statements which cannot be disproved
by facts, but only by future success or failure. The Leader
is always
right
in his actions and since these are planned for centuries to come, the ultimate
test of what he does has been removed beyond the experience of his con-
temporaries.^"^
The only group supposed to believe loyally and textually in the Leader's
words are the sympathizers whose confidence surrounds the movement with
an atmosphere of honesty and simple-mindedness, and helps the Leader to
fulfill half his task, that
is, to inspire confidence in the movement. The party
members never believe public statements and are not supposed
to, but are
complimented
by
totalitarian
propaganda
on
that
superior
intelligence
which supposedly distinguishes them from the nontotalitarian outside world,
which, in turn, they know only from the abnormal gullibility of sympathizers.
Only Nazi sympathizers believed Hitler when he swore his famous
legality
oath before
the supreme court
of the Weimar Republic; members
of
the
movement knew very well that he
lied, and trusted him more than ever be-
cause he
apparently was
able
to
fool
public
opinion and the
authorities.
When in later years Hitler repeated the performance for the whole world,
when he swore to his good intentions and at the same time most openly pre-
pared
his
crimes,
the
admiration
of
the Nazi membership
naturally was
boundless. Similarly, only Bolshevik fellow-travelers believed in the dissolu-
tion of the Comintern, and only the nonorganized masses
of the Russian
people and
the
fellow-travelers abroad were meant
to
take
at
face value
Stalin's prodemocratic statements during the war. Bolshevik party members
were
explicitly warned
not
to be
fooled by
tactical maneuvers
and were
asked to admire their Leader's shrewdness in betraying his
allies. ^"^

TOTALITARIANISM
The graduation of cynicism expressed in a hierarchy of contempt
is
at least
as necessary
in the face of constant refutation as plain
gullibility. The point
is that the sympathizers
in front organizations despise their
fellow-citizens'
complete lack of
initiation,
the party members despise the fellow-travelers'
gullibility and lack of radicalism, the elite formations despise for similar rea-
sons the
party membership, and within the
elite formations a similar hier-
archy of contempt accompanies every new foundation and development. ^"''
The
result
of
this system
is
that the
gullibility of sympathizers makes
lies
credible to the outside world, while at the same time the graduated cynicism
of membership and
elite formations eliminates the danger that the Leader
will ever be forced by the weight of his own propaganda to make good his
own
statements
and
feigned
respectability.
It
has been one
of
the
chief
handicaps of the outside world
in dealing with totalitarian systems that
it
ignored
this system and therefore trusted that, on one hand, the very enor-
mity of totalitarian
lies would be
their undoing and
that, on
the
other,
it
would be possible to take the Leader at his word and force him, regardless
of
his
original
intentions,
to make
it good. The totalitarian system, unfor-
tunately,
is foolproof against such normal consequences;
its ingeniousness
rests precisely on the elimination of that
reality which either unmasks the
liar or forces him to live up to his pretense.
While the membership does not believe statements made for public con-
sumption,
it believes all the more fervently the standard cliches of ideological
explanation,
the
keys
to
past and
future
history which
totalitarian move-
ments took from
nineteenth-century
ideologies,
and
transformed,
through
organization, into a working reality. These ideological elements in which the
masses had come
to believe anyhow,
albeit
rather vaguely and
abstractly,
were turned into factual lies of an all-comprehensive nature (the domination
of the world by the Jews instead of a general theory about races, the con-
spiracy of Wall
Street instead of a general theory about classes) and
inte-
grated into a general scheme of action in which only the "dying"—the dying
classes
of
capitalist
countries
or
the
decadent
nations—are
supposed
to
stand
in the way of the movement.
In contrast
to the movements'
tactical
lies which change
literally from day to day, these
ideological
lies
are sup-
posed
to be believed
like sacred untouchable
truths. They
are surrounded
by
a carefully elaborated system of "scientific" proofs which do not have
to be convincing for the completely "uninitiated," but
still appeal to some
vulgarized
thirst
for knowledge by "demonstrating"
the
inferiority
of the
Jews or the misery of people living under a capitalist system.
The
elite
formations
are
distinguished from
the
ordinary
party mem-
bership
in
that
they do
not
need
such
demonstrations and
are not even
supposed to believe in the literal truth of ideological cliches. These are fabri-
cated to answer a quest for truth among the masses which in its insistence on
explanation and demonstration
still has much in common with the normal

world. The elite
is not composed of ideologists;
its members' whole educa-
tion
is aimed
at abolishing
their capacity for distinguishing between
truth
and falsehood, between reality and fiction. Their superiority consists in their
ability immediately to dissolve every statement of fact into a declaration of
purpose.
In distinction to the mass membership which, for instance, needs
some demonstration of the inferiority of the Jewish race before
it can safely
be asked to kill Jews, the elite formations understand that the statement,
all
Jews are inferior, means, all Jews should be killed; they know that when they
are told that only Moscow has a subway, the real meaning of the statement
is that all subways should be destroyed, and are not unduly surprised when
they discover the subway in Paris. The tremendous shock of disillusion which
the Red Army suffered on its conquering trip to Europe could be cured only
by concentration camps and forced exile for a large part of the occupation
troops; but the police formations which accompanied the Army were pre-
pared for the shock, not by different and more correct information—there
is no secret training school in Soviet Russia which gives out authentic facts
about
life abroad—but simply by
a general training in supreme contempt
for all facts and
all reality.
This mentality of the
elite
is no mere mass phenomenon, no mere con-
sequence
of
social
rootlessness, economic
disaster,
and
political
anarchy;
it needs careful preparation and cultivation and forms
a more important,
though less easily recognizable, part of the curriculum of totalitarian lead-
ership schools, the Nazi Ordensburgen for the SS troops, and the Bolshevik
training centers for Comintern agents, than race indoctrination or the tech-
niques of civil war. Without the elite and
its
artificially induced inability to
understand
facts
as
facts,
to
distinguish between truth and falsehood,
the
movement could never move
in
the
direction of
realizing
its
fiction. The
outstanding negative quality of the totalitarian elite
is that
it never stops to
think about the world as
it really is and never compares the lies with reality.
Its most cherished virtue, correspondingly,
is loyalty to the Leader, who, like
a talisman,
assures
the ultimate
victory
of
lie and
fiction over
truth and
reality.
The topmost
layer
in the organization of totalitarian movements
is the
intimate circle around the Leader, which can be
a formal
institution,
like
the Bolshevik Politburo, or a changing clique of men who do not necessarily
hold office, like the entourage of Hitler. To them ideological cliches are mere
devices to organize the masses, and they feel no compunction about changing
them according to the needs of circumstances if only the organizing principle
is kept intact. In
this connection, the chief merit of Himmler's reorganiza-
tion of the SS was
that he found
a very simple method
for
"solving the
problem of blood by action," that
is, for selecting the members of the
elite
according to "good blood" and preparing them to "carry on a racial struggle
without mercy" against everyone who could not trace his "Aryan" ancestry
back to 1750, or was less than 5 feet 8 inches tall ("I know that people who
have reached a certain height must possess the desired blood to some de-

?,Vft
TOTALITARIANISM
grce") or did not have blue eyes and blond hair."" The importance of this
racism
in
action was
that
the organization became independent
of almost
all concrete teachings of no matter what
racial "science," independent
also
of antiscmitism
insofar as
it was
a
specific doctrine concerning the nature
and
role of the Jews, whose
usefulness would have ended with
their ex-
termination.'"
Racism was
safe
and
independent
of
the
scientificality
of
propaganda once an
elite had been
selected by
a "race commission" and
placed
under
the
authority
of
special
"marriage
laws,""-
while
at
the
opposite end and under the jurisdiction of this
"racial
elite," concentration
camps existed for the sake of "better demonstration of the laws of inheri-
tance and race.""^ On the strength of this "living organization," the Nazis
could dispense with dogmatism and offer friendship to Semitic peoples, like
the Arabs, or enter into alliances with the very representatives of the Yellow
Danger,
the Japanese. The
reality
of
a
race
society,
the formation
of an
elite
selected from an
allegedly
racial viewpoint, would indeed have been
a
better safeguard
for the
doctrine
of racism than the
finest
scientific
or
pseudo-scientific proof.
The policy-makers of Bolshevism show the same superiority to their own
avowed dogmas. They are quite capable of interrupting every existing class
struggle
with
a sudden
alliance
with
capitalism
without undermining
the
reliability of their cadres or committing treason against their belief in class
struggle.

to the movement. In contrast, however, to other despotic forms of govern-
ment, where frequently a clique rules and the despot plays only the repre-
sentative role of a puppet
ruler, totalitarian leaders are
actually free to do
whatever they please and can count on the loyalty of their entourage even
if they choose to murder them.
The more technical reason for this
suicidal loyalty
is that succession to
the supreme office
is not regulated by any inheritance or other laws. A suc-
cessful palace revolt would have as disastrous
results for the movement as
a whole as a military defeat.
It
is in the nature of the movement that once
the Leader has assumed his
office, the whole organization
is so
absolutely
identified with him that any admission of a mistake or removal from office
would break
the
spell
of
infallibility
which
surrounds
the
office
of
the
Leader and spell doom to
all those connected with the movement.
It
is not
the
truthfulness
of
the Leader's words but
the
infallibility
of
his
actions
which
is the basis for the structure. Without
it and in the heat of a discus-
sion which presumes
fallibility, the whole fictitious world of totalitarianism
goes to pieces, overwhelmed at once by the factuality of the real world which
only the movement steered in an infallibly right direction by the Leader was
able to ward
off.
However, the loyalty of those who believe neither
in ideological cliches
nor in the
infallibility of the Leader also has deeper, nontechnical reasons.
What binds these men together is a firm and sincere belief in human omnipo-
tence. Their moral cynicism, their belief that everything
is permitted,
rests
on the solid conviction that everything
is possible.
It
is true that these men,
few in number, are not easily caught in their own specific lies and that they
do not necessarily believe in racism or economics,
in the conspiracy of the
Jews or of Wall Street. Yet they too are deceived, deceived by their impudent
conceited idea that everything can be done and their contemptuous convic-
tion that everything that exists
is merely a temporary obstacle that superior
organization
will
certainly
destroy.
Confident
that power
of
organization
can destroy power of substance,
as
the violence
of a well-organized gang
might rob a rich man of ill-guarded wealth, they constantly underestimate
the
substantial power of
stable communities and overestimate
the
driving
force of a movement. Since, moreover, they do not
actually believe in the
factual existence of a world conspiracy against them, but use
it only as an
organizational device, they fail to understand that their own conspiracy may
eventually provoke the whole world into uniting against them.
Yet no matter how the delusion of human omnipotence through organiza-

jtgg
TOTALITARIANISM
lion
is
ultimately defeated, within the movement
its practical consequence
is that the entourage of the Leader,
in case of disagreement with him,
will
never be very sure of their own opinions,
since they believe
sincerely that
their disagreements do not
really matter, that even the maddest device has
a
fair chance of success
if properly organized. The point of their loyalty
is
not that they believe the Leader is infallible, but that they are convinced that
everybody who commands
the
instruments
of
violence
with
the
superior
methods of totalitarian organization can become
infallible. This delusion
is
greatly strengthened when totalitarian regimes hold the power to demonstrate
the
relativity of success and
failure, and
to show how a
loss
in substance
can become a gain in organization. (The fantastic mismanagement of indus-
trial enterprise
in Soviet Russia led to the atomization of the working class,
and
the
terrifying mistreatment of
civilian prisoners
in Eastern
territories
under
Nazi
occupation,
though
it
caused
a
"deplorable
loss
of
labor,"
"thinking
in terms of generations,
[was]
not
to be
regretted."^'"*)
More-
over,
the decision regarding success and
failure under totalitarian circum-
stances
is very largely a matter of organized and terrorized public opinion.
In
a
totally
fictitious world,
failures need not be
recorded,
admitted, and
remembered.
Factuality
itself depends for
its continued existence upon the
existence of the nontotalitarian world.

Posen, Nazi Conspiracy,

CHAPTER TWELVE
Totalitarianism in Power
WHEN A MOVEMENT, international in organization, all-comprehensive in
its ideological scope, and global in its political aspiration, seizes power
in one country, it obviously puts itself in a paradoxical situation. The socialist
movement was spared
this
crisis,
first, because the national question—and
that meant
the
strategical problem
involved
in
the
revolution—had been
curiously neglected by Marx and Engels,
and,
secondly, because
it faced
governmental problems only after the
first World War had divested the Sec-
ond International of
its authority over the national members, which every-
where had accepted the primacy of national sentiments over
international
solidarity as an unalterable
fact.
In other words, when the time came for
the
socialist movements
to
seize power
in
their
respective
countries,
they
had already been transformed into national
parties.
This transformation never occurred in the totalitarian, the Bolshevik and
the Nazi movements. At the time
it seized power the danger to the move-
ment lay in the fact that, on one hand,
it might become "ossified" by taking
over the
state machine and frozen
into
a form
of
absolute government,^
and
that, on the
other hand,
its freedom
of movement might be
limited
by the borders of the territory in which
it came to power. To a totalitarian
movement, both dangers are equally
deadly:
a development toward abso-
lutism would put an end to the movement's interior drive, and a develop-
ment toward
nationalism would
frustrate
its
exterior
expansion,
without
which
the movement cannot
survive. The form
of government
the
two
movements
developed,
or,
rather,
which
almost
automatically
developed
from their double claim to total domination and global
rule,
is best char-
acterized by Trotsky's slogan of "permanent revolution" although Trotsky's
theory was no more than a socialist forecast of a series of revolutions, from
the
antifeudal
bourgeois
to
the
antibourgeois
proletarian,
which
would
spread from one country to the other.^ Only the term
itself suggests "per-
' The Nazis fully realized that the seizure of power might lead to the establishment
of absolutism. "National Socialism, however, has not spearheaded the struggle against
liberalism
in
order
to bog down
in
absolutism
and
start
the game
all
over
again"
(Werner
Best, Die deutsche
Polizei,
p. 20). The warning expressed here,
as
in count-
less other places,
is directed against the
state's claim to be absolute.
-Trotsky's theory,
first pronounced
in
1905, did of course not
differ from the revo-
lutionary strategy of
all
Leninists
in whose eyes "Russia
herself was merely
the
first
domain,
the
first rampart,
of
international
revolution:
her
interests were
to be
sub-
ordinated
to
the
supernational
strategy
of
militant
socialism.
For
the
time
being,
however,
the
boundaries
of
both
Russia
and
victorious
socialism
were
the
same"

Political Biography. New York and London,

mancncy." with
all
its semi-anarchistic implications, and
is,
strictly speak-
ing, a misnomer; yet even Lenin was more impressed by the term than by
its theoretical content.
In the Soviet Union,
at any
rate, revolutions,
in the
form
of
general
purges,
became
a
permanent
institution
of
the
Stalin
regime
after
1934.''
Here,
as
in
other
instances,
Stalin
concentrated
his
attacks on Trotsky's half-forgotten slogan precisely because he had decided
to
use
this
technique.'
In Nazi Germany,
a
similar tendency toward per-
manent
revolution was
clearly
discernible though
the
Nazis
did
not have
time
to
realize
it to the same extent.
Characteristically enough,
their "per-
manent
revolution"
also
started
with
the
liquidation of
the
party
faction
which had dared to proclaim openly the "next stage of the revolution"^

is
significant
because
of
the new
Party
statute, announced
at
the
Seventeenth Party Congress, which provided that "periodic
.
.
. purges are to
[be]
car-
ried out for the systematic cleansing of the Party." (Quoted from A. Avtorkhanov, "So-
cial
Differentiation and Contradictions
in
the
Party,"
Bulletin
of
the
Institute for the
Stuily of the USSR. Munich. February, 1956.)—The party purges during the early years
of the Russian Revolution have nothing
in common with their later totalitarian perver-
sion into an instrument of permanent instability. The
first purges were conducted by lo-
cal control commissions before an open forum to which party and non-party members
had
free
access. They
were
planned
as
a
democratic
control
organ
against
bureau-
cratic
corruption
in
the
party and "were
to
serve
as
a
substitute
for
real
elections"
(Deutscher,
op.
cit..
pp.
233-34).—An
excellent
short survey of the development
of
the purges can be found
in Avtorkhanov's
recent
article which also refutes the legend
that
the murder
of Kirov gave
rise
to
the new
policy. The
general purge had begun
before
Kirov's death which was no more than a "convenient pretext
to give
it added
drive."
In view of the many "inexplicable and mysterious" circumstances surrounding
Kirov's murder, one suspects
that
the "convenient pretext" was carefully planned and
executed
by
Stalin
himself. See
Khrushchev's
"Speech on
Stalin," New York
Times,
June
5.
1956.
' Deutscher, op.
cit..
p. 282, describes the
first attack on Trotsky's "permanent
rev-
olution" and
Stalin's counterformulation of "socialism
in one country" as an
accident
of political maneuvering.
In
1924, Stalin's "immediate purpose was to descredit Trotsky.

Searching
in
Trotsky's
past,
the
triumvirs came
across
the
theory
of
'perma-

he had formulated
in
1905. ...
It was
in
the course of that
polemic that Stalin arrived
at
his formula of 'socialism

and precisely because
"the Fuehrer and
his old guard knew
that
the
real
struggle had just begun."" Here, instead of the Bolshevik concept of per-
manent revolution, we find the notion of a racial "selection which can never
stand
still"
thus
requiring
a
constant
radicalization
of
the
standards
by
which the selection,
i.e., the extermination of the unfit,
is carried outJ The
point
is that both Hitler and Stalin held out promises of stability
in order
to hide their intention of creating a
state of permanent
instability.
There could have been no better solution for the perplexities inherent in
the co-existence of a government and a movement,
of both
a totalitarian
claim and limited power in a limited territory, of ostensible membership
in
a comity of nations in which each respects the other's sovereignty and claim
to world
rule, than
this formula
stripped
of
its
original
content. For
the
totalitarian ruler is confronted with a dual task which at first appears contra-
dictory to the point of absurdity:
he must
establish the
fictitious world of
the movement as a tangible working reality of everyday
life, and he must,
on the other hand, prevent this new world from developing a new stability;
for a
stabilization
of
its
laws and
institutions would
surely
liquidate
the
movement
itself and with
it
the hope
for eventual
world
conquest. The
totalitarian ruler must, at any price, prevent normalization from reaching the
point where a new way
of
life
could develop—one which
might,
after
a
time, lose
its bastard
qualities and take
its place among the widely
differ-
ing and profoundly contrasting ways of life of the nations of the earth. The
moment the revolutionary institutions became
a national way of
life
(that
moment when
Hitler's claim
that Nazism
is
not an export commodity or
Stalin's that socialism can be built in one country, would be more than an
attempt
to
fool the
nontotalitarian world),
totalitarianism would
lose
its
"total" quality and become subject to the law of the nations, according to
which each possesses
a
specific
territory,
people,
and
historical
tradition
which relates
it to other nations—a plurality which ipso facto refutes every
contention that any specific form of government
is absolutely valid.
Practically speaking, the paradox of totalitarianism
in power
is that the
possession of
all instruments
of governmental power and violence
in one
country is not an unmixed blessing for a totalitarian movement.
Its disregard

This

radicalization
of
the

racial
selection can be found
in
all phases of Nazi
policy. Thus, the

the

Jewish and

the

sick
and,
eventually, by
all

in which
there were
any
"incurably

which

did
not
stop
before

itself,
either. A

19, 1943, ordered that

ties, marriage or friendship were
to be eliminated from

TOTALITARIANISM
for facts,
its strict adherence to the rules of a fictitious world, becomes stead-
ily more difficult to maintain, yet remains as essential as
it was before. Power
means
a
direct
confrontation with
reality, and
totalitarianism
in power
is
constantly concerned
with overcoming
this
challenge. Propaganda and
or-
ganization no longer suffice to assert that the impossible
is possible, that the
incredible
is true, that an insane consistency rules the world; the chief psycho-
logical
support
of
totalitarian
fiction—the
active resentment of
the
status
quo. which
the masses refused to accept
as the only possible world—is no
longer
there; every
bit of factual
information
that
leaks through
the
iron
curtain,
set up against
the ever-threatening flood of
reality from the other,
nontotalitarian
side,
is
a
greater menace
to
totalitarian
domination
than
counterpropaganda has been
to
totalitarian movements.
The struggle for total domination of the total population of the earth, the
elimination
of every competing
nontotalitarian
reality,
is
inherent
in
the
totalitarian
regimes themselves;
if they do not pursue global
rule
as
their
ultimate
goal,
they
are only too
likely
to
lose whatever power they have
already seized. Even a single individual can be absolutely and reliably dom-
inated only under global totalitarian conditions. Ascendancy to power there-
fore means primarily the establishment of
official and
officially recognized
headquarters (or branches
in the case of satellite countries)
for the move-
ment and the acquisition of a kind of laboratory
in which to carry out the
experiment
with
or
rather
against
reality,
the experiment
in organizing
a
people
for
ultimate purposes which
disregard
individuality
as
well
as na-
tionality, under conditions which are admittedly not perfect but are sufficient
for important
partial
results. Totalitarianism in power uses the state admin-
istration for
its long-range goal of world conquest and for the direction of
the branches of the movement;
it establishes the secret police as the execu-
tors and guardians
of
its
domestic experiment
in constantly transforming
reality
into
fiction;
and
it
finally
erects
concentration camps
as
special
laboratories to carry through
its experiment in total domination.

The So-called

State
HISTORY TEACHES THAT
rise to power and responsibility
affects deeply the
nature of revolutionary parties. Experience and common sense were perfectly
justified
in expecting that totalitarianism in power would gradually lose
its
revolutionary momentum and Utopian character, that the everyday business
of government and the possession of real power would moderate the pre-
power claims of the movements and gradually destroy the
fictitious world
of their organizations.
It seems, after
all, to be in the very nature of things,
personal
or
public,
that extreme demands and
goals
are checked by ob-
jective
conditions; and
reality, taken
as
a whole,
is only
to
a very
small
extent determined by
the
inclination toward

of a mass
society
of
atomized individuals.

TOTALITARIANISM IN POWER
393
Many
of the
errors of the nontotalitarian world
in
its diplomatic deal-
ings with totalitarian governments
(the most conspicuous ones being con-
fidence in the Munich pact with Hitler and the Yalta agreements with Stalin)
can clearly be traced to an experience and a common sense which suddenly
proved
to have
lost
its grasp on
reality. Contrary
to
all expectations, im-
portant concessions and
greatly heightened
international
prestige
did
not
help to reintegrate the
totalitarian countries
into the comity of nations or
induce them
to abandon
their
lying complaint
that
the whole world had
solidly lined up against them. And far from preventing this, diplomatic vic-
tories clearly precipitated their recourse to the instruments of violence and
resulted
in
all
instances
in increased
hostility
against the powers that had
shown themselves willing to compromise.
These disappointments
suffered by
statesmen and
diplomats
find
their
parallel
in the
earlier disillusionment of benevolent observers and sympa-
thizers with the new revolutionary governments. What they had looked for-
ward to was the establishment of new institutions and the creation of a new
code of law which, no matter how revolutionary in content, would lead to a
stabilization of conditions and thus check the momentum of the totalitarian
movements
at
least
in
the countries where
they had
seized power. What
happened instead was that terror increased both in Soviet Russia and Nazi
Germany in inverse ratio to the existence of internal political opposition, so
that
it looked
as though
political opposition had not been
the
pretext of
terror (as liberal accusers of the regime were wont to assert) but the
last
impediment to
its full fury.^
Even more disturbing was the handling of the constitutional question by
the totalitarian regimes. In the early years of their power the Nazis let loose
an avalanche of laws and decrees, but they never bothered to abolish
offi-
**
It
is common knowledge that
in Russia "the repression of socialists and anarchists
had grown in severity in the same ratio as the country became pacified" (Anton Ciliga,
The Russian Enigma, London,
1940,
p.
244). Deutscher,
op.
tit.,
p.
218, thinks
that
the reason for the vanishing of the "libertarian
spirit of the revolution" at the moment
of victory could be found
in a changed
attitude of the peasants:
they turned against
Bolshevism
"the more
resolutely
the more
they became
confident
that
the power of
the landlords and the White generals had been broken." This explanation seems rather
weak
in view of the dimensions which
terror was to assume
after
1930.
It
also
fails
to
take
into account
that
full
terror
did
not break
loose
in
the
twenties
but
in
the
thirties, when
the opposition of the peasant
classes was no longer an
active factor in
the
situation.—Khrushchev,
too
(op.
cit.),
notes
that
"extreme
repressive
measures
were not used" against the opposition during the fight against the Trotskyites and the
Bukharinites, but
that "the
repression against them began" much
later after they had
long been
defeated.
Terror by
the Nazi regime reached
its peak during
the war, when the German na-
tion was actually "united."
Its preparation goes back
to
1936 when
all organized
in-
terior resistance had vanished and Himmler proposed an expansion of the concentra-
tion camps. Characteristic of this spirit of oppression regardless of resistance
is Himm-
ler's speech
at Kharkov before the SS
leaders
in
1943: "We have only one task,
.
.
.
to
carry on
the
racial
struggle
without
mercy.
.
.
. We
will
never
let
that
excellent
weapon, the dread and
terrible reputation which preceded us
in the battles
for Khar-
kov, fade, but will constantly add new meaning to
it" {Nazi Conspiracy, IV, 572
ff.).

^Q^
TOTALITARIANISM
cially the Weimar constitution; they even
left the civil services more or less
intact—a fact which induced many native and foreign observers to hope for
restraint of the
party and
for rapid normaUzation of the new
regime. But
when with the issuance of the Nuremberg Laws this development had come
to an end,
it turned out that the Nazis themselves showed no concern what-
soever
about
their own
legislation.
Rather,
there was
"only
the
constant
going ahead on the road toward ever-new
fields," so that
finally the "pur-
pose and scope of the
secret
state
police"
as
well
as of
all other
state or
party
institutions created by the Nazis could "in no manner be covered by
the
laws and
regulations
issued
for them.""
In
practice,
this
permanent
state of lawlessness found expression in the fact that "a number of valid reg-
ulations [were] no longer made public."'" Theoretically,
it corresponded to
Hitler's dictum
that "the
total state must not know any difference between
law and ethics";" because
if
it assumed that the valid law
is identical with
the ethics common
to
all and springing from
their consciences, then there
is indeed no further necessity for public decrees. The Soviet Union, where the
prerevolutionary
civil services had been exterminated in the revolution and
the regime had
paid scant
attention
to constitutional questions during the
period of revolutionary change, even went to the trouble of issuing an entirely
new and very elaborate constitution in 1936 ("a veil of liberal phrases and
premises over
the
guillotine
in
the background"'-),
an event which was
hailed
in Russia and abroad
as the conclusion of the revolutionary period.
Yet the publication of the constitution turned out to be the beginning of the
gigantic superpurge which
in nearly two years
liquidated
the
existing
ad-
ministration and
erased
all
traces
of normal
life and economic
recovery
which had developed in the four years
after the liquidation of kulaks and

enforced collectivization of the
rural population.'^ From then on, the con-
stitution of 1936 played exactly the same role the Weimar constitution played
under the Nazi regime:
it was completely disregarded but never abolished;
the only difference was that Stalin could
afford one more absurdity—with
the exception of Vishinsky,
all those who had drafted the never-repudiated
constitution were executed as traitors.
What strikes the observer of the totalitarian state
is certainly not its mono-
lithic structure. On the contrary,
all serious students of the subject agree at
least on the co-existence
(or the conflict) of a dual authority, the party and
the state. Many, moreover, have stressed the peculiar "shapelessness" of the
totalitarian government.''* Thomas Masaryk saw
early
that
"the
so-called
Bolshevik system has never been anything but a complete absence of sys-
tem";'"' and
it
is perfectly true that "even an expert would be driven mad
if he tried to unravel the relationships between Party and State" in the Third
Reich.'"
It has also been frequently observed that the relationship between
the two sources of authority, between state and party,
is one of ostensible
and
real
authority, so that the government machine
is usually pictured
as
the powerless fagade which hides and protects the real power of the party.

close
reading of
Stalin's speech concern-
ing
the constitution
(his report to
the Extraordinary
Eighth
Soviet Congress of No-
vember 25,
1936)
it becomes evident
that
it was never meant
to be
definitive.
Stalin
stated
explicitly:
"This
is
the framework
of our
constitution
at
the
given
historical
moment. Thus the
draft of the new constitution
represents
the sum
total of the road
already
traveled,
the sum
total
of
achievements
already
existing."
In
other
words,
the
constitution was already dated
the moment
it was announced, and was merely of
historical
interest. That
this
is not
just an arbitrary
interpretation
is proved by Molo-
tov, who
in
his speech about
the constitution
picks up
Stalin's theme and
underlines
the provisional nature of the whole matter: "We have realized only the
first, the lower
phase, of Communism. Even this first phase of Communism, Socialism,
is by no means
completed;
only
its
skeletal
structure
has
been
erected"

political

Nazi Germany
consistently
on
the
co-
existence
of "two governments
in Germany—the
real and
the
ostensible. The forms
of the German Republic were maintained
for a time and
it was the outward and
vis-
ible government. But the
real authority in the State was outside of and above the law
and rested in the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party" (Nazi Conspiracy,

also the distinction of Roberts, op.

"Hitler obviously leans toward increasing the duplication of functions."
Students of Nazi Germany seem agreed
that the
state had only ostensible authority.
For the only exception,
see Ernst
Fraenkel, The Dual State, New York and London,
1941, who claims the co-existence of a "normative and
a
prerogative
state"
living
in
constant friction as "competitive and not complementary parts of the German Reich."
According to Fraenkel, the normative
state was maintained by the Nazis for the pro-
tection of the
capitalist order and
private
property and had
full authority
in
all eco-
nomic matters, while
the prerogative
state of the party ruled supreme
in
all
political
matters.

TOTALITARIANISM
All
levels of the administrative machine
in the Third Reich were subject
to a curious duplication of offices. With a fantastic thoroughness, the Nazis
made sure that every function of the state administration would be duplicated
bv some
party organ:
'^
the Weimar division
of Germany
into
states and
provinces was duplicated by the Nazi division into Gaue whose borderlines,
however, did not coincide, so
that every given locality belonged, even geo-
graphically,
to two altogether different administrative
units.^" Nor was the
duplication
of
functions abandoned
when,
after
1933,
outstanding
Nazis
occupied the official ministries of the state; when Frick, for instance, became
Minister of the
Interior or Guerthner Minister
of
Justice. These
old and
trusted
party
members,
once
they
had embarked upon
official
nonparty
careers,
lost their power and became as uninfluential as other civil servants.
Both came under the
factual authority of Himmler, the
rising chief of the
pt^licc, who normally would have been subordinate
to the Minister of the
Interior.-" Better known abroad has been the fate of the old German Foreign
Affairs
Office
in
the
Wilhelmstrasse. The
Nazis
left
its
personnel
nearly
untouched and of course never abolished
it; yet at the same time they main-
tained the prepower Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Party, headed by Rosen-
berg;-'
and
since
this
office had

in maintaining

Rosenberg had
never

position

belonged to the intimate circle around
Hitler. Now
that he had become Reichsminister
for
the
Eastern Occupied
Territories,
he was
constantly confronted
with
"direct
ac-
tions"
of
other
plenipotentiaries
(chiefly SS-men) who
overlooked
him
because
he
now belonged
to the ostensible apparatus of the
state. See
ibid.,
IV, 65
ff. The same
happened
to Hans
Frank, Governor General
of
Poland. There were
only two
cases
in
which
the
attainment
of
ministerial
rank
did
not
entail
any
loss
of power and
prestige:
that
of
Minister
of Propaganda Goebbels, and
of
Minister of
the
Interior
Himmler.
As
regards
Himmler, we
possess
a memorandum,
presumably
from
the
year
1935, which
illustrates the systematic singlemindedness of the Nazis in regulating
the
relations
between
party
and
state.
This memorandum,
which
apparently
origi-
nated
in
Hitler's immediate
entourage and was found among
the correspondence
of
the
Reichstuliiitlaniiir
of
the
Fuehrer
and
the
Gestapo,
contains
a
warning
against
making Himmler
state
secretary
of the
Ministry
of
the
Interior because
in
that case
he could "no
longer be a
political
leader" and "would be
alienated from
the party."
Here,
too, we
find mention of the
technical
principle
regulating the
relations between
party and
state: "A
Reichsleiter
[a
high party functionary] must not be subordinated
to a Reichsminister
[a high
state functionary]." (The undated, unsigned memorandum,
entitled Die f>eheime Staatspolizei. can be found in the archives of the Hoover Library,

organ to compete with the office in the Wilhelmstrasse, the so-called Ribben-
trop Bureau, which handled foreign
affairs
in the West, and survived
the
departure of
its chief as Ambassador to England, that
is, his incorporation
into the official apparatus of the Wilhelmstrasse. Finally, in addition to these
party
institutions,
the
Foreign
Office
received
another
duplication
in
the
form of an SS Office, which was responsible "for negotiations with all racially
Germanic groups
in Denmark, Norway, Belgium and
the Netherlands.""
These examples prove
that for the Nazis
the duplication
of
offices was
a
matter of principle and not
just an expedient for providing jobs for party
members.
The same division between a real and an ostensible government developed
from very different beginnings in Soviet Russia.-^ The ostensible government
originally sprang from
the All-Russian Soviet Congress, which during the
civil war lost
its influence and power to the Bolshevik
party. This process
started when the Red Army was made autonomous and the secret
political
police re-established as an organ of the party, and not of the Soviet Con-
gress;-^
it was completed in 1923, during the
first year of Stalin's General
Secretaryship.-"' From then on, the Soviets became the shadow government
in whose
midst, through
cells formed by Bolshevik party members,
func-
tioned the representatives of real power who were appointed and responsible
to
the Central Committee
in Moscow. The
crucial
point
in
the
later de-
velopment was not the conquest of the
Soviets by the
party, but the
fact
that "although
it would have presented no
difficulties,
the Bolsheviks did
not abolish the Soviets and used them as the decorative outward symbol of
their
authority."-''
The co-existence of an ostensible and a
real government therefore was
partly the outcome of the revolution
itself and preceded Stalin's totalitarian
dictatorship. Yet while the Nazis simply retained the existing administration
and deprived
it of
all power,
Stalin had to revive his shadow government,
which in the early
thirties had
lost
all
its functions and was
half forgotten

gress about the work of the personnel department during his
first year in the General
Secretariat:
"The year
before only 27
per cent
of
the
regional
leaders
of

trade
unions were members of the party. At present 57 per cent of them were Communists.
The percentage of Communists
in the management of co-operatives had
risen from 5
to 50 per cent; and in the commanding
staffs of the armed forces from
16 to 24. The

ence
as
well
as
the powerlessness of the
Soviets. (None of
its paragraphs
ever had the slightest
practical significance
for
life and jurisdiction
in Rus-
sia.
)
The
ostensible
Russian government,
utterly
lacking
the glamour
of
tradition so necessary
for
a fagade,
apparently needed
the sacred
halo of
written
law. The
totalitarian defiance of law and
legality
(which "in
spite
of the greatest changes
.
.
.
still
[remain]
the expression of a permanently
desired order")
-'' found
in
the written Soviet constitution, as in the never-
repudiated Weimar constitution,
a permanent background for
its own law-
lessness, the permanent challenge to the nontotalitarian world and
its stand-
ards whose helplessness and impotence could be demonstrated
daily.-^
Duplication of offices and division of authority, the co-existence of
real
and ostensible power,
are
sufficient
to create confusion but not
to explain
the "shapelessness" of the whole structure. One should not forget that only
a building can have a structure, but that a movement—if the word
is to be
taken
;ls seriously and as
literally
as the Nazis meant
it—can have only
a
direction, and that any form of legal or governmental structure can be only
a handicap to a movement which
is being propelled with increasing speed
in a certain direction. Even in the prepower stage the totalitarian movements
represented those masses that were no longer willing to live in any kind of
structure, regardless of
its nature; masses that had started to move in order
to flood the legal and geographical borders securely determined by the gov-
ernment.
Therefore, judged by our conceptions
of government and
state
structure, these movements, so long as they find themselves physically
still
limited to a
specific
territory, necessarily must
try to destroy
all
structure,
and
for
this
willful destruction a mere duplication of
all
offices into party
and
state
institutions would not be
sufficient. Since
duplication
involves
a
relationship between the fagade of the state and the inner core of the party,
it,
too. would eventually
result
in some kind of structure, where
the
rela-
tionship between party and state would automatically end in a legal regula-
tion which
restricts and
stabilizes
their
respective
authority."*

TOTALITARIANISM IN POWER
399
As
a matter of
fact, duplication of
offices,
seemingly
the
result
of
the
party-state problem in
all one-party dictatorships,
is only the most conspicu-
ous sign of a more complicated phenomenon that
is better defined as multi-
plication of offices than duplication. The Nazis were not content to establish
Gone
in
addition
to
the old
provinces,
but
also introduced
a
great many
other geographical
divisions
in accordance with
the
different
party organ-
izations:
the
territorial
units of the SA were
neither co-extensive with
the
Gaue nor with the provinces; they differed, moreover, from those of the SS
and none of them corresponded
to the zones dividing the
Hitler Youth. ^"
To
this geographical confusion must be added
the
fact
that
the
original
relationship between
real and
ostensible power repeated
itself throughout,
albeit
in
an
ever-changing
way. The
inhabitant
of
Hitler's
Third
Reich
lived not only under the simultaneous and
often conflicting
authorities
of
competing powers, such
as
the
civil
services,
the
party,
the SA, and
the
SS; he could never be sure and was never
explicitly
told whose
authority
he was supposed
to place above
all
others. He had
to develop
a kind of
sixth sense to know at a given moment whom to obey and whom to disregard.
Those, on the other hand, who had to execute the orders which the leader-
ship,
in the interest of the movement, regarded as genuinely necessary—in
contradistinction to governmental measures, such orders were of course en-
trusted
only
to
the
party's
elite
formations—were
not much
better
off.
Mostly such orders were "intentionally vague, and given in the expectation
that
their
recipient
would
recognize
the
intent
of
the
order
giver,
and
act accordingly";^' for the
elite formations were by no means merely obli-
party. Of party members who made such
proposals he was wont
to speak with con-
tempt,
describing them
as
"eternally
tied
to
the
past,"
as
persons "who
are
unable
to leap across their own shadow"
(Felix Kersten, Totenkopf unci
Tretie, Hamburg).
'" "The 32 Gaue ... do
not
coincide
with
the
administrative or military
regions,
or even
the 21
divisions of the SA, or the
10
regions of
the SS, or
the 23
zones of
the
Hitler Youth.
.
.
. Such
discrepancies
are
the more remarkable
because
there
is
no reason for them" (Roberts, op.

gated to obey the orders of the Fuehrer
(this was mandatory for
all existing
organizations anyway), but "to execute the
will of the
leadership."-^- And,
as can be gathered from the lengthy proceedings concerning "excesses" be-
fore
the party courts,
this was by no means one and the same
thing. The
only difference was that the
elite formations, thanks to their special indoc-
trination
for such
purposes, had
been
trained
to understand
that
certain
"hints meant more than their mere verbal contents." ^^
Technically speaking, the movement within the apparatus of totalitarian
domination derives
its mobility from the fact that the leadership constantly
shifts the actual center of power, often to other organizations, but without
dissolving or even publicly exposing the groups that have thus been deprived
of their power.
In the early period of the Nazi regime, immediately after the
Reichstag fire, the SA was the real authority and the party the ostensible one;
power then shifted from the SA to the SS and finally from the SS to the Se-
curity Service." The point
is that none of the organs of power was ever de-
prived of its right to pretend that
it embodied the will of the Leader.^" But not
only was the will of the Leader so unstable that compared with
it the whims of
Oriental despots are
a shining example of steadfastness; the consistent and
ever-changing division between real secret authority and ostensible open rep-
resentation made the actual seat of power a mystery by definition, and this
to such an extent
that
the members of the
ruling clique themselves could
never be absolutely sure of their own position in the secret power hierarchy.
Alfred Rosenberg, for instance, despite his long career in the party and his
impressive accumulation of ostensible power and
offices
in the party
hier-
archy,
still talked about the creation of a series of Eastern European States

Particularly
significant
is
the end
of
the
report,
in
which
the supreme
party court
quite openly takes exception
to
these methods:
"It
is
another question
whether,
in
the
interest
of discipline,
the order
that
is
intentionally
vague, and piven
in
the expectation
that
its
recipient
will
recognize
the
intent of the
order giver and
act
accordingly, must
not be
relegated
to the
past." Here,
too,
there
were persons who, in Hitler's words, "were unable to leap across their own shadow" and
insisted upon
legislative measures, because they did not understand that not the order
hut
the
will
of
the Fuehrer was
the supreme
law.
Here,
the
difference between
the
mentality of the elite formations and the party agencies
is particularly clear.

it
this way:
"So long

exterminated.^^
In
other words, since knowledge of whom to obey and a comparatively perma-
nent settlement of hierarchy would introduce an element of
stability which
is essentially absent from
totalitarian
rule, the Nazis constantly disavowed
real authority whenever it had come into the open and created new instances
of government compared with which the former became
a shadow govern-
ment—a game which obviously could go indefinitely. One of the most im-
portant technical differences between the Soviet and the National
Socialist
system is that Stalin, whenever he shifted the power emphasis within his own
movement from one apparatus to another, had the tendency to liquidate the
apparatus together with
its
staff, while Hitler,
in
spite of his contemptuous
comments on people who "are unable to leap across their own shadows,"
^'^
was perfectly willing to continue using these shadows even though in another
function.
The multiplication of offices .was extremely useful for the constant
shift-
ing of power; the longer, moreover, a totalitarian regime stays in power, the
greater becomes the number of offices and the possibility of jobs exclusively
dependent upon the movement, since no office
is abolished when
its author-
ity
is liquidated. The Nazi regime started this multiplication with an
initial
co-ordination
of
all
existing
associations,
societies,
and
institutions.
The
interesting
thing
in
this
nation-wide
manipulation was
that
co-ordination
did not
signify incorporation
into the already existing respective party
or-
ganizations. The result was that up to the end of the regime, there were not
one,
but two National
Socialist
student organizations, two Nazi women's
organizations,
two
Nazi
organizations
for
university
professors,
lawyers,
physicians, and so
forth.^**
It was by no means
sure, however,
that
in
all
cases the original party organization would be more powerful than
its co-

could
anybody
predict
with
any
assurance
which party organ would
rise
in the ranks of the internal party hierarchy.'^
A classical instance of this planned shapelessness occurred
in the organ-
ization
of
scientific
antisemitism.
In
1933,
an
institute
for
study
of
the
Jewish question
( Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage) was founded
in
Munich which,
since
the Jewish question presumably had determined
the
whole of German history, quickly enlarged into a research institute for mod-
ern German
history. Headed
by
the
well-known
historian
Walter Frank,
it transformed
the
traditional
universities
into
seats
of ostensible
learning
or
fai,\idcs.
In
1940, another
institute for the study of the Jewish question
was founded
in Frankfurt, headed by Alfred Rosenberg, whose standing as
a party member was considerably higher. The Munich institute consequently
was relegated to a shadowy existence; the Frankfurt, not the Munich
insti-
tution was supposed to receive the treasures from looted European Jewish
collections and become
the
seat
of
a comprehensive
library on
Judaism.
Yet, when these collections actually arrived in Germany a few years
later,
their most precious parts went not to Frankfurt, but to Berlin, where they
were received by Himmler's special Gestapo department for the liquidation
(not merely the study)
of the Jewish question, which was headed by Eich-
mann. None of the older institutions was ever abolished, so that in 1944 the
situation was this: behind the fagade of the universities' history departments
stood
threateningly
the more
real power
of
the Munich
institute,
behind
which rose Rosenberg's
institute in Frankfurt, and only behind these three
facades, hidden and protected by them, lay the real center of authority, the
Rekhssicherheitshauptomt, a special division of the Gestapo.
The fagade of the Soviet government, despite
its written constitution,
is
even
less impressive, erected even more exclusively for foreign observation
than the
state administration which the Nazis inherited and retained from
the Weimar Republic. Lacking the Nazis' original accumulation of offices in
the period of co-ordination, the Soviet regime
relies even more on constant
creation of new offices
to put the former centers of power in the shadow.
The gigantic increase of the bureaucratic apparatus, inherent in this method,
is checked by repeated liquidation through purges. Nevertheless, in Russia,
too, we can
distinguish
at
least
three
strictly
separate
organizations:
the
Soviet or state apparatus,
the party apparatus, and the NKVD apparatus,
each of which has
its own independent department of economy,
a political

works,

Hitler
outside
of
all party
hierarchies and
affiliations.
This organization might have been used against the authority of party or even police
organizations.
It
is noteworthy
that Speer could
risk pointing out
to Hitler
(during a
conference
in
1942)
the
impossibility
of

*"Such an innocuous and unimportant society, for instance,
as the NSKK (the Na-
tional Socialist corps of automobilists founded in 1930) was suddenly elevated, in 1933,
to the status of an
elite formation, sharing with the SA and the SS the privilege of an
independent
affiliated
unit of the party. Nothing followed
this
rise
in the ranks of the
Nazi
hierarchy;
retrospectively,
it looks
like an
idle
threat to the SA and SS.

department, a ministry of education and culture, a military department, etc."*^
In Russia, the ostensible power of the party bureaucracy
as
against the
real power of the
secret police corresponds
to
the
original
duplication
of
party and state as known in Nazi Germany, and the multiplication becomes
evident only in the secret police itself, with
its extremely complicated, widely
ramified network of agents, in which one department
is always assigned to
supervising and spying on another. Every enterprise in the Soviet Union has
its special department of the
secret
police, which
spies on party members
and ordinary personnel
alike.
Co-existent with
this department
is another
police division of the party
itself, which again watches everybody, including
the agents of the NKVD, and whose members are not known to the
rival
body. Added to these two espionage organizations must be
the unions
in
the factories, which must see
to
it that the workers
fulfill
their prescribed
quotas. Far more important than these apparatuses, however,
is "the special
department" of the NKVD which represents "an NKVD within the NKVD,"
i.e., a secret police within the secret police*^ All reports of these competing
police
agencies ultimately end up
in the Moscow Central Committee and
the Politburo. Here
it
is decided which of the reports
is decisive and which
of the
police
divisions
shall be
entitled
to carry out
the
respective
police
measures. Neither the average inhabitant of the country nor any one of the
police departments knows, of course, what decision will be made; today
it
may be the special division of the NKVD, tomorrow the party's network of
agents; the day after,
it may be the local committees or one of the regional
bodies. Among all these departments there exists no legally rooted hierarchy
of power or authority; the only certainty
is that eventually one of them will
be chosen to embody "the
will of the leadership."
The only rule of which everybody
in a totalitarian
state may be sure
is
that the more
visible government agencies
are,
the
less power they
carry,
and the less
is known of the existence of an institution, the more powerful
it will ultimately turn out to be. According to this
rule, the Soviets, recog-
nized by a written constitution
as the
highest
authority
of the
state, have
less power than the Bolshevik party; the Bolshevik party, which recruits
its
members openly and
is recognized as the
ruling class, has
less power than
the secret police. Real power begins where secrecy begins. In this respect the
Nazi and the Bolshevik
states were very much
alike;
their difference
lay
chiefly in the monopolization and centralization of secret police services in
Himmler on one hand, and the maze of apparently unrelated and uncon-
nected police
activities
in Russia on the
other.

TOTALITARIANISM
If wc consider the totalitarian state solely as an instrument of power and
leave
aside
questions
of
administrative
efficiency,
industrial
capacity,
and
cci>nomic
productivity,
then
its
shapelessness
turns
out
to
be
an
ideally
suited
instrument
for
the
realization
of
the
so-called Leader
principle. A
continuous competition between
offices, whose
functions
not only
overlap
but which are charged
with
identical
tasks,^''
gives opposition or sabotage
almost no chance
to become
effective;
a
swift change
of emphasis which
relegates one
office
to
the shadow and
elevates
another
to
authority can
solve
all problems without anybody's becoming aware of the change or of
the
fact
that opposition had
existed,
the
additional advantage
of the
sys-
tem being that the opposing office
is likely never to learn of
its defeat, since
it
is either not abolished
at
all
(as
in the case of the Nazi regime)
or
it
is
liquidated much later and without any apparent connection with the specific
matter. This can be done
all the more easily since nobody, except those few
initiated, knows the exact relationship between the authorities. Only once in
a while does the nontotalitarian world catch a glimpse of these conditions, as
when
a high official abroad confesses that an obscure clerk in the Embassy
had
been
his
immediate
superior.
In
retrospect
it
is
often
possible
to
determine why
such
a sudden
loss of power occurred,
or,
rather,
that
it
occurred
at
all. For
instance,
it
is
not hard
to understand today why
at
the outbreak
of war people
like
Alfred Rosenberg or Hans Frank were
removed
to
state
positions
and
thus
eliminated from
the
real
center
of
power,
namely,
the
Fuehrer's
inner
circle.^'* The
important
thing
is
that
they
not
only did not know
the reasons for these moves, but presumably
not
even
suspected
that
such
apparently
exalted
positions
as
Governor
General
of
Poland
or
Reichsminister
for
all
Eastern
territories
did
not
signify the climax but the end of their National Socialist careers.
The Leader
principle does
not
establish
a hierarchy
in
the
totalitarian
state any more than
it does
in the
totalitarian movement;
authority
is not
filtered down from the top through
all intervening layers
to the bottom of
the body politic as
is the case in authoritarian regimes. The factual reason
is
that
there
is no
hierarchy
without
authority
and
that,
in
spite
of
the
numerous
misunderstandings
concerning
the
so-called
"authoritarian
per-
sonality," the principle of authority
is in all important respects diametrically
opposed
to
that
of
totalitarian
domination.
Quite
apart from
its
origin
*' According to the testimony of one of his former employees (Nazi Conspiracy, VI,
461
).
It was "a specialty of Himmler
to give one task
to two different people."
"In the aforementioned address (see footnote 29) Hans Frank showed that at some
pomt he wanted
to stabilize the movement, and
his numerous complaints as Governor
General
of
Poland
testify
to
a
total
lack
of understanding
of
the
deliberately
anti-
ulilitarian tendencies of Nazi
policy. He cannot understand why the subjected peoples
are
not
exploited
but
exterminated.
Rosenberg,
in
the
eyes
of
Hitler,
was
racially
unreliable because he meant
to
establish
satellite
states
in
the conquered Eastern
ter-
ritories and
did
not
understand
that
Hitler's population policy aimed
at depopulating
these
territories.
fro

TOTALITARIANISM IN POWER
405
in Roman
history,
authority, no matter
in what form, always
is meant to
restrict or Hmit freedom, but never
to
abolish
it.
Totalitarian domination,
however,
aims
at
abolishing
freedom,
even
at
eliminating human
spon-
taneity in general, and by no means
at a
restriction of freedom no matter
how
tyrannical.
Technically,
this
absence
of
any
authority
or
hierarchy
in the
totalitarian system
is shown by the
fact
that between
the supreme
power
(the Fuehrer) and the ruled there are no reliable intervening levels,
each of which would receive
its due share of authority and obedience. The
will of the Fuehrer can be embodied everywhere and
at
all times, and he
himself
is not tied to any hierarchy, not even the one he might, have estab-
lished
himself.
Therefore,
it
is
not
accurate
to
say
that
the
movement,
after
its
seizure of power, founds
a
multiplicity of
principalities
in whose
realm each
little leader
is free
to do
as he pleases and
to imitate the
big
leader
at
the
top.^"'
The
Nazi
claim
that
"the
party
is
the
order
of
fuehrers"
^''" was an ordinary
lie. Just as the
infinite multiplication of offices
and confusion of authority leads to a state of affairs in which every citizen
feels himself directly confronted with the will of the Leader, who arbitrarily
chooses the executing organ of his decisions, so the one and a half million
"fuehrers" throughout the Third Reich *' knew very well that their authority
derived directly from Hitler without the intervening levels of a functioning
hierarchy."*^ The direct dependence was real and the intervening hierarchy,
certainly of social importance, was an ostensible, spurious imitation of an
authoritarian
state.
The Leader's
absolute monopoly
of power and
authority
is most con-
spicuous
in the relationship between him and
his
chief of
police, who
in
a
totalitarian
country
occupies
the
most
powerful
public
position.
Yet
despite
the enormous
material
and
organizational power
at
his
disposal
as
the head
of
a
veritable
police army and
of
the
elite
formations,
the
chief of police apparently
is
in no position ever to seize power and himself
become the ruler of the country. Thus prior to Hitler's
fall, Himmler never
dreamed of touching Hitler's claim to leadership *^ and was never proposed
"' The notion of a division
into
"little
principalities" which formed
"a pyramid of
power outside the law with the Fuehrer
at
its apex"
is Robert H. Jackson's. See chap-
ter

ff.
In
order
to
avoid
the establishment
of such an
authoritarian
state.
Hitler,
as
early
as
1934,
issued
the following party decree:
"The
form
of address 'Mein Fuehrer"
is
reserved
for
the Fuehrer alone.
I
herewith
forbid
all
subleaders of
the NSDAP
to allow
themselves
to be
addressed
as 'Mein
Reichs-
leiter,'
etc., either
in words or
in writing.
Rather,
the form of address has to be
Pg.

interesting
in
this context
is
Beria's
ill-
fated attempt at seizing power after Stalin's death. Although Stalin had never
pcrniittcd any of
his
police
chiefs
to enjoy
a
position comparable
to
that
of Himmler
during
the
last
years
of Nazi
rule,
Beria,
too,
disposed
of
enough troops to challenge the
rule of the party

by
occupying
the
whole
of Moscow
and
all
accesses
to
the
Kremlin;
nobixJy except the Red Army might have disrupted his claim to power and
this would
have
led
to
a bloody
civil war whose outcome would by no
means have
been
assured. The
point
is
that Beria
voluntarily abandoned
all
his
positions only
a few days
later even though he must have known
that he would forfeit
his
life because for a matter of days he had dared to
play off the power of the
police against the power of the party. ^°
This
lack
of
absolute power does
of course
not
prevent
the
chief
of
police from organizing
his enormous apparatus
in accordance
with
totali-
tarian power
principles. Thus
it
is most remarkable
to
see how Himmler
after
his appointment began
the
reorganization
of
the German
police by
introducing
into the
hitherto centralized apparatus of the secret
police the
multiplication of offices
i.e., he apparently did what
all experts of power
who preceded the totalitarian regimes would have feared as decentralization
leading to
a diminution of power. To the
service of the Gestapo Himmler
first added the Security Service, originally a division of the SS and founded
as an inner-party police body. While the main
offices of the Gestapo and
the
Security
Service
were
eventually
centralized
in
Berlin,
the
regional
branches of these two huge secret services retained their separate
identities
and
each
reported
directly
to
Himmler's own
office
in
Berlin. ^^
In
the
course
of
the
war, Himmler added
two more
intelligence
services:
one
consisted
of
so-called
inspectors who were
supposed
to
control
and
co-
ordinate the Security Service with the police and who were
subject to the
jurisdiction
of
the
SS;
the
second was
a
specifically
military
intelligence
bureau which acted independently of the Reich's military forces and finally
succeeded
in absorbing the army's own

TOTALITARIANISM IN POWER
407
(With one exception no
dissatisfied Nazis took
part
in
tiie
military con-
spiracy against Hitler of July,
1944.) On the surface, the Leader principle
seems
to
invite
bloody
changes
of
personal power
without
a
change
of
regime.
This
is but one of many
indications
that the
totalitarian form
of
government has very
little to do with lust for power or even the desire for
a power-generating
machine,
with
the game
of power
for
power's
sake
which has been characteristic of the
last
stages of imperialist
rule.
Tech-
nically speaking, however,
it
is one of the most important indications that
totalitarian government,
all appearances
notwithstanding,
is
not
rule by
a
clique or a gang.^^ The evidence of Hitler's
as well
as
Stalin's dictatorship
points clearly to the fact that isolation of atomized individuals provides not
only the mass basis for totalitarian rule, but
is carried through to the very
top of
the whole
structure.
Stalin
has
shot
almost everybody who
could
claim
to belong to the
ruling clique and has moved
the members
of the
Politburo back and forth whenever a clique was on the point of consolidating
itself. Hitler destroyed cliques in Nazi Germany with less drastic means—the
only
bloody
purge
having been
directed
against
the Rohm
clique which
indeed was
firmly kept together through
the homosexuality
of
its
leading
members; he
prevented
their formation by
constant
shifts
in power
and
authority, and frequent changes of intimates in his immediate surroundings,
so that
all former solidarity between those who had come into power with
him quickly evaporated.
It seems
obvious,
moreover,
that
the monstrous
unfaithfulness which
is reported in almost identical terms as the outstanding
trait
in
both
Hitler's and
Stalin's
characters
did
not
allow them
to
pre-
side over anything so lasting and durable as a clique. However that may be,
the point is that there exists no interrelationship between those holding office;
they are not bound together by equal status
in a political hierarchy or the
relationship between superiors and inferiors, or even the uncertain loyalties
of gangsters. In Soviet Russia, everybody knows that the top manager of a
big
industrial concern can
as
well
as
the
Minister
of Foreign
Affairs be
demoted any day to the lowest social and
political status, and that a com-
plete unknown may
step
into
his
place. The
gangster
complicity, on
the
other hand, which played some
role
in

stages
of
the Nazi
dic-
tatorship, loses
all cohesive force, for totalitarianism uses

is doubtful "whether Germany can be called

It

to spread
this complicity through
the population
until
it has organized the
guilt of the whole people under
its domination."'*
The absence of a
ruling clique has made the question of a successor to
the
totalitarian dictator especially
baffling and troublesome.
It
is true
that
this
issue has plagued
all
usurpers, and
it
is quite characteristic that none
of
the
totalitarian
dictators
ever
tried
the
old method
of
establishing
a
dynasty and appointing their sons. Against Hitler's numerous and therefore
self-defeating appointments
stands
Stalin's
method, which made
the
suc-
cession one of the most dangerous honors in the Soviet Union. Under totali-
tarian conditions, knowledge of the
labyrinth
of transmission
belts equals
supreme power, and every appointed successor who actually comes to know
what
is going on
is automatically removed after a certain time. A valid and
comparatively permanent appointment would indeed presuppose the
exist-
ence of a
clique whose members would
share
the
Leader's monopoly
of
knowledge of what
is going on, which the Leader must avoid by
all means.
Hitler once explained this in his own terms to the supreme commanders of
the Wehrmacht, who
in the midst of the turmoil of war were presumably
racking their brains over
this problem: "As the ultimate factor
I must, in
all modesty, name my own person:

eflfective. They
assure
not only an
absolute power monopoly,
but unparalleled certainty that all commands will always be carried out; the
multiplicity of the transmission belts, the confusion of the hierarchy, secure
the dictator's complete independence of
all his inferiors and make possible
the swift and surprising changes in policy for which totalitarianism has be-
come famous. The body politic of the country
is shock-proof because of
its
shapelessness.
The reasons why such extraordinary efficiency was never tried before are
as simple as the device
itself. The multiplication of offices destroys
all sense
of responsibility and competence;
it
is not merely a tremendously burden-
some and unproductive increase of administration, but actually hinders pro-
ductivity because conflicting orders constantly delay real work until the order
of the Leader has decided the matter. The fanaticism of the elite cadres, ab-
solutely essential for the functioning of the movement, abolishes systemati-
cally
all genuine
interest
in
specific jobs and produces
a mentality which
sees every conceivable
action
as an instrument for something entirely
dif-
ferent.^'^ And
this mentality
is not confined to the
elite but gradually per-
vades
the
entire
population,
the most
intimate
details
of whose
life
and
death depend upon
political
decisions—that
is, upon causes and
ulterior
motives which have nothing to do with performance. Constant removal, de-
motion, and promotion make
reliable teamwork
impossible
and
prevent
the development of experience. Economically speaking, slave labor is a lux-
ury which Russia should not be able to afford; in a time of acute shortage
of technical
skill,
the camps were
filled with
"highly
qualified
engineers
[who] compete
for
the
right
to do plumbing jobs,
repair
clocks,
electric
lighting and telephone." ^^ But then, from a purely utilitarian point of view,
Russia should not have been able to afford the purges in the thirties that in-
terrupted a long-awaited economic recovery, or the physical destruction of
the Red Army general
staff, which led almost to a defeat in the Russian-
Finnish war.
Conditions
in Germany were
different
in degree.
In the
beginning,
the
Nazis showed a certain tendency to retain technical and administrative
skill,
to allow profits in business, and to dominate economically without too much
interference. At the outbreak of the war Germany was not yet completely
totalitarianized, and
if one accepts preparation for war as a rational motive,
it must be conceded that
until roughly 1942 her economy was allowed to

ever,
is that
it was by no means checked by such a shattering defeat as Stalin-

But even many high Nazi

this

expanded; the ban on party membership for those in the armed forces was
lifted and the military command was subordinated to SS commanders. The
jealously guarded crime monopoly of the SS was abandoned and
soldiers
were assigned at will to duties of mass murder."* Neither military, nor eco-
nomic, nor political considerations were allowed to interfere with the costly
and troublesome program of mass exterminations and deportations.
If one considers these last years of Nazi rule and their version of a "five-
year plan," which they had no time
to carry out but which aimed
at the
extermination of the Polish and Ukrainian people, of 170 million Russians
(as mentioned in one plan), the intelligentsia of Western Europe such as the
Dutch and the people of Alsace and Lorraine, as well as of all those Germans
who would be
disqualified under
the prospective Reich
health
bill
or
the
planned "community alien law," the analogy to the Bolshevik five-year plan
of 1929, the
first year of clear-cut totalitarian dictatorship
in Russia,
is
al-
most inescapable. Vulgar eugenic slogans
in one
case, high-sounding eco-
nomic
phrases
in
the
other, were
the
prelude
to
"a
piece
of
prodigious
insanity, in which all rules of logic and principles of economics were turned
upside down.""''
To be
sure,
totalitarian
dictators do
not
consciously embark upon
the
road to insanity. The point
is rather that our bewilderment about the anti-
utilitarian character of the totalitarian state structure springs from the mis-
taken notion that we are dealing with a normal state after all—a bureaucracy,
a tyranny, a dictatorship—from our overlooking the emphatic assertions by
totalitarian
rulers
that they consider
the country where they happened
to
seize power only the temporary headquarters of the international movement
on the road to world conquest,
that they reckon
victories and
defeats
in
terms of centuries or millennia, and that the global interests always overrule
the local
interests of their own
territory."" The famous "Right

organizations,
far from
disappearing,
leads
to
the
"co-ordination"
of
the
whole population, who are now organized as sympathizers. The tremendous
increase in sympathizers
is checked by limiting party strength to a privileged
"class" of a few millions and creating a superparty of several hundred thou-
sand, the elite formations. Multiplication of offices, duplication of functions,
and adaptation of the party-sympathizer relationship to the new conditions
mean simply
that
the
peculiar
onion-like
structure
of
the movement,
in
which every
layer was
the
front
of the
next more
militant
formation,
is
retained. The state machine
is transformed into a front organization of sym-
pathizing bureaucrats whose function
in domestic
affairs
is to spread con-
fidence among the masses of merely co-ordinated citizens and whose foreign
affairs consist in fooling the outside, nontotalitarian world. The Leader, in
his dual capacity
as chief of the
state and leader of the movement,
again
combines
in
his person the acme
of
militant ruthlessness and confidence-
inspiring normality.
One of the important differences between a totalitarian movement and a
totalitarian state is that the totalitarian dictator can and must practice the to-
talitarian art of lying more consistently and on a larger scale than the leader
of a movement. This
is
partly the automatic consequence
of
swelling the
ranks of fellow-travelers, and
is partly due to the fact that unpleasant state-
ments by a statesman
are not
as
easily revoked
as those of a demagogic
party leader. For this purpose. Hitler chose to fall back, without any detours,
on
the
old-fashioned
nationalism
which
he
had
denounced many
times
before his ascent to power; by posing as a violent nationalist, claiming that
National Socialism was not an "export commodity," he appeased Germans
and non-Germans alike and implied that Nazi ambitions would be satisfied
when the traditional demands of a nationalist German foreign policy—re-
turn of territories ceded in the Versailles treaties, Anschluss of Austria, an-
nexation of the German-speaking parts of Bohemia—were
fulfilled.
Stalin
likewise reckoned with both Russian public opinion and
the non-Russian
world when he invented his theory of "socialism in one country" and threw
the onus of world revolution on Trotsky.''^^
Systematic lying to the whole world can be safely carried out only under
the conditions of totalitarian
rule, where the
fictitious
quality of everyday
reality makes propaganda largely superfluous.

tioning the name of Trotsky, there
is no further need for propaganda against
Trotsky. But
the use of the methods for carrying out the
ideological goals
can be "expected" only from those who
are
"ideologically
utterly firm"

in the Comintern schools or the
special
Nazi
indoctrination
centers—even
if
these
goals
continue
to

occasions
it
invariably
turns
out
that
the mere sym-
pathizers never realize what
is happening.^-' This leads to the paradox that
"the
secret
society
in broad daylight"
is never more conspiratory
in char-
acter and methods than after
it has been recognized as a full-fledged mem-
ber of the comity of nations.
It
is only logical that Hitler, prior to his seizure
of power, resisted
all attempts to organize the party and even the
elite for-
mations on a conspiratory basis; yet after 1933 he was quite eager to help
transform
the SS
into
a
kind
of
secret
society.''^
Similarly,
the Moscow-
directed Communist parties,
in marked contrast to their predecessors, show
a curious tendency to prefer the conditions of conspiracy even where com-

possible.

rule, by consciously developing
a method of always doing the opposite of
what they say J" Stalin has carried this
art of balance, which demands more
skill than the ordinary routine of diplomacy, to the point where
a modera-
tion in foreign policy or the political
line of the Comintern
is almost invari-
ably accompanied by radical purges
in the Russian party.
It was certainly
more than coincidence
that
the Popular Front
policy and
the
drafting of
the
comparatively
liberal
Soviet
constitution
were
accompanied
by
the
Moscow Trials.
Evidence
that totalitarian governments
aspire
to conquer the globe and
bring all countries on earth under their domination can be found repeatedly
in Nazi and Bolshevik
literature. Yet these ideological programs,
inherited
from pretotalitarian movements (from the supranationalist
antisemitic par-
ties and the Pan-German dreams of empire
in the case of the Nazis, from
the international concept of revolutionary socialism
in the case of the Bol-
sheviks)
are not decisive. What
is decisive
is that totalitarian regimes really
conduct their foreign policy on the consistent assumption that they will even-
tually achieve
this ultimate goal, and never lose
sight of
it no matter how
distant
it may appear or how
seriously
its
"ideal" demands may
conflict
with the necessities of the moment. They therefore consider no country
as
permanently foreign,
but, on the contrary, every country
as their potential
territory. Rise to power, the fact that
in one country the fictitious world of
the movement has become a tangible reality, creates a relationship to other
nations which
is similar to the situation of the totalitarian party under non-
totalitarian rule: the tangible reality of the fiction, backed by internationally
recognized state power, can be exported the same way contempt for parlia-
ment could be imported
into
a nontotalitarian parliament.
In
this
respect,
the prewar
"solution" of the Jewish
question was
the
outstanding export
commodity of Nazi Germany: expulsion of Jews carried an important por-
tion of Nazism into other countries; by forcing Jews to leave the Reich pass-
portless and penniless, the legend of the Wandering Jew was
realized, and
by forcing the Jews into uncompromising hostility against them, the Nazis
had
created
the
pretext
for
taking
a
passionate
interest
in
all
nations'
domestic
policies.''^
How
seriously
the
Nazis took
their conspiratorial
fiction,
according
to
which they were the future rulers of the world, came to light in
1 940 when
despite necessity, and in the face of
all their all-too-real chances of winning
over the occupied peoples of Europe—they started their depopulation poli-
cies
in the Eastern
territories,
regardless of loss of manpower and serious
military
consequences,
and
introduced
legislation

force cx{H)rtcd part of the Third Reich's penal code into the Western occu-
pied countries.'" There was hardly a more effective way of pubUcizing the
Nazi claim to world
rule than punishing as high treason every utterance or
action against the Third Reich, no matter when, where, or by whom
it had
been made.
Nazi law treated
the whole world
as
falling
potentially under
its jurisdiction, so that the occupying army was no longer an instrument of
conquest that carried with
it the new law of the conqueror, but an executive
organ which enforced a law which already supposedly existed for everyone.
The assumption
that Nazi law was binding beyond
the German border
and the punishment of non-Germans were more than mere devices of op-
pression.
Totalitarian regimes
are
not
afraid of the
logical implications
of
world conquest even
if they work the other way around and are detrimental
to their own peoples'
interests.
Logically,
it
is indisputable that a plan for
world conquest involves the abolition of differences between the conquering
mother country and the conquered territories, as well
as the difference be-
tween foreign and domestic politics, upon which
all existing nontotalitarian
institutions and
all
international
intercourse
are
based.
If
the
totalitarian
conqueror conducts himself everywhere as though he were
at home, by the
same token he must treat his own population
as though he were
a foreign
conqueror.'" And
it
is
perfectly
true
that the
totalitarian movement
seizes
power in much the same sense as a foreign conqueror may occupy a coun-
try which he governs not for
its own sake but for the benefit of something
or somebody
else. The Nazis behaved
like foreign conquerors
in Germany
when, against
all
national
interests, they
tried and
half succeeded
in con-
verting
their defeat
into a
final catastrophe for the whole German people;
similarly
in
case
of
victory,
they
intended
to
extend
their
extermination
politics into the ranks of "racially unfit" Germans.

A similar attitude seems to have inspired Soviet foreign policy
after the
war. The

during
the war the introduction of a
National Health

prohibitive:
it has foregone the great postwar loan from the United States
which would have enabled Russia
to reconstruct devastated
areas and
in-
dustrialize
the
country
in
a
rational,
productive
way.
The
extension
of
Comintern
governments
throughout
the
Balkans
and
the
occupation
of
large Eastern
territories brought no tangible
benefits, but on
the contrary
strained
Russian
resources
still
further.
But
this
policy
certainly
served
the interests of the Bolshevik movement, which has spread over almost half
of the inhabited world.
Like
a
foreign conqueror,
the
totalitarian
dictator
regards
the
natural
and
industrial
riches
of each
country,
including
his own,
as
a
source
of
loot and a means of preparing the next step of aggressive expansion. Since
this economy
of systematic
spoliation
is
carried
out
for
the
sake
of
the
movement and not of the nation, no people and no territory,
as the poten-
tial beneficiary, can possibly
set a saturation point to the process. The
to-
talitarian dictator is like a foreign conqueror who comes from nowhere, and
his looting is likely to benefit nobody. Distribution of the spoils
is calculated
not to strengthen the economy of the home country but only as a temporary
tactical maneuver. For economic purposes, the
totalitarian regimes
are
as
much
at home in their countries as the proverbial swarms of locusts. The
fact that the totalitarian dictator rules
his own country
like a foreign con-
queror makes matters worse because
it adds
to
ruthlessness an
efficiency
which
is conspicuously lacking
in tyrannies
in
alien surroundings.
Stalin's
war against the Ukraine
in the early
thirties was twice
as
effective
as the
terribly bloody German invasion and occupation.^^ This
is the reason why
totalitarianism prefers
quisling governments
to
direct
rule
despite
the ob-
vious dangers of such regimes.
The trouble with totalitarian regimes
is not that they play power politics
in an especially ruthless way, but that behind their politics
is hidden an en-
tirely new and unprecedented concept of power, just as behind their Real-
politik
lies an entirely new and unprecedented concept of
reality. Supreme
disregard for immediate consequences rather than ruthlessness; rootlessness
and neglect of national interests rather than nationalism; contempt for utili-
tarian motives rather than unconsidered pursuit of self-interest; "idealism,"
i.e., their unwavering faith in an ideological fictitious world, rather than lust

for power—these have
all introduced
into international
politics a new and
more disturbing factor than mere aggressiveness would have been able to do.
Power,
as conceived by totalitarianism,
lies exclusively
in the force pro-
duced through organization. Just as Stalin saw every institution, independent
of
its actual function, only as a "transmission belt connecting the party with
the people"
''- and honestly believed that the most precious treasures of the
Soviet Union were not the riches of
its soil or the productive capacity of its
huge manpower, but the "cadres" of the party
^'^
(i.e., the police), so Hitler,
as early
as
1929, saw the "great thing"
of the movement
in the
fact
that
sixty thousand men "have outwardly become
almost
a
unit,
that
actually
these members
are uniform not only
in
ideas, but that even the
facial ex-
pression
is almost the same. Look
at these laughing eyes,
this fanatical en-
thusiasm and you
will
discover
.
.
. how
a hundred thousand men
in
a
movement become a single type."*** Whatever connection power had in the
minds of Western man with earthly possessions, with wealth, treasures, and
riches, has been dissolved
into
a kind of dematerialized mechanism whose
every move generates power as
friction or galvanic currents generate elec-
tricity. The totalitarian division of states into Have and Have-not countries
is more than a demagogic device; those who make
it are actually convinced
that the power of material possessions
is negligible and only stands
in
the
way of the development of organizational power. To Stalin constant growth
and development of police cadres were incomparably more important than
the oil in Baku, the coal and ore in the Urals, the granaries in the Ukraine,
or the potential treasures of Siberia—in short the development of Russia's
full power arsenal. The same mentality led Hitler to
sacrifice
all Germany
to
the cadres
of the
SS; he
did not
consider the war
lost when German
cities lay
in rubble and industrial capacity was destroyed, but only when he
learned that the SS troops were no longer reliable.^'"' To a man who believed
in
organizational omnipotence
against
all mere
material
factors,
military
or economic,
and who,
moreover,
calculated
the
eventual
victory

defeat was

catastrophe or threatened

of generations to
its eventual end.

:
The
Secret
Police
UP TO NOW we know only two authentic forms of totalitarian domination:
the dictatorship of National Socialism
after
1938, and the
dictatorship
of
Bolshevism
since
1930. These forms
of domination
differ
basically from
other kinds of dictatorial, despotic or tyrannical
rule; and even though they
have developed,
with
a
certain
continuity, from
party
dictatorships,
their
essentially
totalitarian features
are new and cannot be
derived from one-
party systems. The goal of one-party systems
is not only to
seize the gov-
ernment
administration
but, by
filling
all
offices
with
party
members,
to
achieve
a complete
amalgamation
of
state
and
party,
so
that
after
the
seizure of power the party becomes a kind of propaganda organization for
the government. This system
is
"total" only
in
a negative
sense, namely,
in that the
ruling party
will
tolerate no other
parties, no
opposition and
no freedom
of
political
opinion. Once
a
party
dictatorship
has come
to
power,
it
leaves
the
original power
relationship between
state
and
party
intact; the government and
the army
exercise
the same power
as
before,
and the "revolution" consists only in the fact that
all government positions
are now occupied by parly members.
In
all these
cases the power of the
party rests on a monopoly guaranteed by the state and the party no longer
possesses
its own power center.
The
revolution
initiated by
the
totalitarian movements
after
they have
seized power
is of a considerably more radical nature. From the
start, they
consciously
strive
to maintain
the
essential
differences between
state and
movement and to prevent the "revolutionary" institutions of the movement
from being absorbed by the government.^" The problem of seizing the state
*"' Hitler
frequently commented
on
the
relationship
between
state
and
party,
and
always emphasized
that
not
the
state,
but
the
race, or the
"united
folk community,"
was
of primary
importance
(cf.
the
afore-quoted
speech,
reprinted
as annex
to
the
Tischgesprache).
In
his
speech
at
the
Nuremberg
Parteitag
of
1935,
he
gave
this
theory
its most
succinct
expression:
"It
is
not
the
state
that commands
us,
but we
who command the state."
It
is self-evident
that,
in
practice, such powers of command
are
possible
only
if
the
institutions
of
the
party
remain
independent from
those
of
the
state.

machine
without amalgamating with
it
is solved by
permitting only
those
party members whose
importance
for
the movement
is secondary
to
rise
in
the
state
hierarchy. AH
real power
is
vested
in
the
institutions
of the
movement, and outside
the
state and
military apparatuses.
It
is
inside the
movement, which remains the center of action of the country,
that
all de-
cisions are made;
the
oflicial
civil
services are often
not even informed of
what
is going on, and party members with the ambition to
rise to the rank
of ministers have in
all cases paid for such "bourgeois" wishes with the loss
of
their
influence on
the movement and
of the confidence
of
its
leaders.
Totalitarianism
in power uses the
state
as
its outward fagade,
to
repre-
sent the country
in the nontotalitarian world. As such, the totalitarian state
is the
logical
heir of the
totalitarian movement from which
it borrows
its
organizational
structure.
Totalitarian
rulers
deal
with
nontotalitarian
gov-
ernments
in
the same way they
dealt with parliamentary
parties or
intra-
party factions before their
rise to power and, though on an enlarged
inter-
national
scene,
are
again faced with
the double problem
of
shielding the
fictitious world of the movement
(or the totalitarian country) from the im-
pact of factuality and of presenting a semblance of normality and common
sense to the normal outside world.
Above the state and behind the facades of ostensible power, in a maze of
multiplied offices, underlying
all
shifts of authority and in a chaos of
ineffi-
ciency,
lies the power nucleus of the country, the
superefficient and super-
competent services of the secret police.^"" The emphasis on the police as the
sole organ of power, and the corresponding neglect of the seemingly greater
power arsenal of the army, which
is characteristic of all totalitarian regimes,
can
still be
partially explained by the
totalitarian
aspiration to world
rule
and
its conscious abolition of the distinction between a foreign country and
a home country, between foreign and domestic
affairs. The military forces,
trained to
fight a foreign aggressor, have always been a dubious instrument
for civil-war purposes; even under totalitarian conditions they find
it
diffi-
cult to regard their own people with the eyes of a foreign conqueror.^^ More
important in this respect, however,
is that their value becomes dubious even
in time of war. Since the totalitarian ruler conducts his policies on the
as-
sumption of an eventual world government, he treats the victims of his ag-
gression as though they were rebels, guilty of high treason, and consequently
prefers to rule occupied territories with police, and not with military forces.
Even before the movement seizes power,
it possesses a secret police and
spy service with branches in various countries. Later its agents receive more
money and authority than the regular military intelligence
service and
are

frequently the secret chiefs of embassies and consulates
abroad.**'*
Its main
tasks consist in forming
fifth columns, directing the branches of the move-
ment, influencing the domestic policies of the respective countries, and gen-
erally preparing for the time when
the
totalitarian
ruler—after overthrow
of the government or military victory—can openly
feel
at home.
In other
words, the international branches of the secret
police
are the transmission
belts which
constantly transform
the
ostensibly
foreign
policy
of
the
to-
talitarian
state
into
the
potentially
domestic
business
of
the
totalitarian
movement.
These functions, however, which the secret police
fulfill
in order to pre-
pare the totalitarian Utopia of world
rule,
are secondary to those
required
for the present realization of the totalitarian fiction in one country. The dom-
inant role of the secret police
in the domestic
politics of totalitarian coun-
tries has naturally contributed much to the common misconception of totali-
tarianism.
All
despotisms
rely
heavily on
secret
services
and
feel more
threatened by their own than by any foreign people. However, this analogy
between totalitarianism and despotism holds only for the
first stages of to-
talitarian
rule, when there
is
still a political opposition. In this
as in other
respects totalitarianism takes advantage of, and gives conscious support
to,
nontotalitarian misconceptions, no matter how uncomplimentary they may
be. Himmler, in his famous speech to the Reichswehr staff in 1937, assumed
the role of an ordinary tyrant when he explained the constant expansion of
the police forces by assuming the existence of a "fourth theater in case of
war, internal Germany."**" Similarly, Stalin at almost the same moment half
succeeded
in convincing the old Bolshevik guard, whose
"confessions" he
needed,
of
a war
threat
against
the
Soviet Union
and,
consequently,
an
emergency in which the country must remain united even behind a despot.
The most striking aspect of these statements was that both were made after
all political opposition had been extinguished, that the
secret services were
expanded when
actually no opponents were
left
to be
spied upon. When
war came, Himmler neither needed nor used his SS troops in Germany
it-
self, except for the running of concentration camps and policing of foreign
slave labor; the bulk of the armed SS served at the Eastern front where they
were used for
"special
assignments"—usually mass murder—and
the
en-
forcement of policy which frequently ran counter to the military as well as
the Nazi civilian hierarchy. Like the secret police of the Soviet Union, the
SS formations usually arrived after the military forces had pacified the con-
quered territory and had dealt with outright political opposition.
In the
first stages of a totalitarian regime, however, the secret police and
the party's elite formations
still play a role similar to that in other forms of
dictatorship and the well-known terror regimes of the past; and the excessive
cruelty
of
their methods
is
unparalleled
only

TOTALITARIANISM
Western countries. The first stage of ferreting out secret enemies and hunting
down former opponents
is usually combined with drafting the entire popula-
tion into front organizations and re-educating old party members for volun-
tary espionage services, so that the rather dubious sympathies of the drafted
sympathizers need not worry the specially trained cadres of the police.
It
is
during this stage that a neighbor gradually becomes a more dangerous enemy
to one who happens to harbor "dangerous thoughts" than are the
officially
apfxiinted police agents. The end of the first stage comes with the liquidation
of open and secret resistance
in any organized form;
it can be
set
at about
1935
in Germany and approximately 1930 in Soviet Russia.
Only after the extermination of real enemies has been completed and the
hunt
for "objective enemies" begun does terror become the
actual content
of totalitarian regimes. Under the pretext of building socialism in one coun-
try, or using a given territory as a laboratory for a revolutionary experiment,
or
realizing
the
Volksgemeinschaft,
the
second
claim
of
totalitarianism,
the claim
to
total
domination,
is
carried
out. And
although
theoretically
total domination
is possible only under the conditions of world rule, the to-
talitarian regimes have proved
that
this part of the
totalitarian Utopia can
be
realized almost
to
perfection, because
it
is temporarily independent
of
defeat or
victory. Thus
Hitler could
rejoice even
in the midst of military
setbacks over the extermination of Jews and the establishment of death fac-
tories; no matter what the
final outcome, without the war
it would never
have been possible "to burn the bridges" and
to
realize some of the goals
of the totalitarian movement.^"
The elite formations of the Nazi movement and the "cadres" of the Bol-
shevik movement serve the goal of total domination rather than the security
of the regime
in power. Just as the totalitarian claim to world
rule
is only
in appearance the same as imperialist expansion, so the claim to total dom-
ination only seems familiar to the student of despotism.
If the chief differ-
ence
between
totalitarian
and
imperialist
expansion
is
that
the
former
recognizes no difference between
a home and a foreign country, then the
chief difference between a despotic and a totalitarian secret police is that the
latter does not hunt
secret thoughts and does not use
the
old method of
secret services, the method of provocation.^*
Since the totalitarian secret police begins
its career after the pacification
of the country,

Paris,

provocation "the foundation stone" of the secret
police
(p.
19).
In Soviet
Russia, provocation, far from being the secret weapon of the secret police,
has been used as the widely propagandized public method of the regime
to gauge the
temper of public opinion. The reluctance of the population to avail
itself of the periodi-
cally

invitations
to

resistance. ^^' The
superfluousness
of
secret
services
is
nothing
new;
they
have always been haunted by the need to prove
their usefulness and keep
their jobs
after their original task had been completed. The methods used
for this purpose have made the study of the history of revolutions a rather
difficult enterprise.
It appears, for example, that there was not a single anti-
government action under the reign of Louis Napoleon which had not been
inspired by the police itself."-^ Similarly, the role of secret agents in all revolu-
tionary parties in Czarist Russia strongly suggests that without their "inspir-
ing" provocative actions the course of the Russian revolutionary movement
would have been far less successful.''^ Provocation, in other words, helped as
much to maintain the continuity of tradition as
it did to disrupt time and
again the organization of the revolution.
This dubious
role of provocation might have been one reason why the
totalitarian rulers discarded
it. Provocation, moreover,
is
clearly necessary
only on the assumption that suspicion
is not sufficient for arrest and punish-
ment. None of the totalitarian rulers, of course, ever dreamed of conditions
in which he would have to resort to provocation in order to trap somebody
he thought to be an enemy. More important than these technical considera-
tions
is the fact that totalitarianism defined
its enemies ideologically before
it seized power, so that categories of the
"suspects" were not established
through
police
information. Thus
the Jews
in Nazi Germany
or
the
de-
scendants of the former ruling classes in Soviet Russia were not really sus-
pected of any
hostile
action; they had been declared
"objective" enemies
of the regime in accordance with
its ideology.
The chief difference between the despotic and the totalitarian secret police
lies in the difference between the "suspect" and the "objective enemy." The
latter is defined by the policy of the government and not by his own desire to
overthrow
it.'^^ He
is never an individual whose dangerous thoughts must be

that
Himmler, who
on
the
contrary
wanted to expand the secret services at this moment (around

the danger coming from the "internal enemies." See Nazi Conspiracy,

It
seems,
after
all,
no
accident
that
the
foundation
of
the
Okhrana
in
1880
ushered
in a period of unsurpassed revolutionary activities in Russia.
In order to prove
its
usefulness,
it had occasionally
to organize murders, and
its agents "served despite
themselves
the ideas of those whom they denounced. ...
If a pamphlet was
distrib-
uted by a police agent or
if the execution of a minister was organized by an Azev
the
result was the same" (M. Laporte, op.
cit.,
p. 25). The more important executions
moreover seem
to have been
police jobs—Stolypin and von
Plehve.
Decisive
for
the
revolutionary
tradition was
the
fact
that
in
times of calm
the
police
agents had
to
"stir up anew the energies and stimulate the zeal" of the revolutionaries

Practically
speaking,
the
totalitarian
ruler
proceeds
like
a man who
persistently
insults another man
until everybody
knows that the latter
is his enemy, so that he can, with some plausibility, go
and
kill him
in self-defense. This certainly
is
a
little crude, but
it works—
as c\fT>body
will know who ever watched how certain successful careerists
eliminate competitors.
The introduction of the notion of "objective enemy"
is much more de-
cisive for the functioning of totalitarian regimes than the ideological
defini-
tion of the respective categories.
If
it were only a matter of hating Jews or
bourgeois,
the
totalitarian
regimes could,
after the commission
of one
gi-
gantic crime, return, as
it were, to the rules of normal
life and government.
As we know,
the opposite
is the
case. The category of objective enemies
outlives the
first
ideologically determined foes
of the movement; new ob-
jective enemies
are
discovered
according
to
changing
circumstances:
the
Nazis, foreseeing the completion of Jewish extermination, had already taken
the necessary preliminary steps for the liquidation of the Polish people, while
Hitler even planned the decimation of certain categories of Germans;"^ the
Bolsheviks,
having
started
with
descendants
of
the former
ruling
classes,
directed
their
full
terror against
the kulaks
(in the
early
thirties), who
in
turn were followed by Russians of Polish origin (between 1936 and 1938),
the Tartars and the Volga Germans during the war, former prisoners of war
and units of the occupational forces of the Red Army after the war, and Rus-
sian Jewry after the establishment of a Jewish state. The choice of such cate-
gories
is never
entirely
arbitrary;
since
they
are
publicized and used
for
propaganda purposes of the movement abroad, they must appear plausible
as possible enemies; the choice of
a particular category may even be due
and behavior; the political police of the Nazis
is concerned not just with actions hostile
to the
state
but
with
"all attempts—no matter what
their aim—which
in
their
effects
endanger the State." See

to certain propaganda needs of the movement
at large—as for instance the
sudden entirely unprecedented emergence of governmental antisemitism
in
the Soviet Union, which may be calculated to win sympathies for the Soviet
Union
in the European
satellite
countries. The show
trials which
require
subjective
confessions
of
guilt from
"objectively"
identified
enemies
are
meant
for these purposes; they can
best be
staged with
those who have
received
a
totalitarian
indoctrination
that
enables them
"subjectively"
to
understand their own "objective" harmfulness and to confess "for the sake
of the cause." ^^ The concept of the
"objective opponent," whose
identity
changes according to the prevailing circumstances—so that, as soon as one
category
is liquidated, war may be declared on another—corresponds ex-
actly to the factual situation reiterated time and again by totalitarian rulers:
namely, that their regime
is not a government in any traditional sense, but
a movement, whose advance constantly meets with new obstacles that have
to be eliminated. So far as one ma" speak a^
all of any legal thinking within
the totalitarian system, the "objective opponent"
is
its central idea.
Closely connected with this transformation of the suspect mto the objec-
tive enemy
is the change of position of the secret police
in the
totalitarian
state. The secret services have rightly been called a state within the state, and
this not only
in despotisms but
also under
constitutional
or semiconstitu-
tional governments. The mere possession of secret information has always
given this branch a decisive superiority over
all other branches of the
civil
services and constituted an open threat to members of the government."^ The
totalitarian police, on the contrary, is totally subject to the will of the Leader,
who alone can decide who the next
potential enemy
will be and who,
as
Stalin
did, can
also
single out cadres of the
secret
police
for
liquidation.
Since the police are no longer permitted to use provocation, they have been
deprived of the only available means of perpetuating themselves independ-
ently of the government and have become entirely dependent on the higher
authorities for the safeguarding of their jobs. Like the army in
a nontotali-
tarian state, the police in totalitarian countries merely execute political policy
and have lost
all the prerogatives which they held under despotic bureauc-
racies.^'"^

^-ift
TOTALITARIANISM
The task of the totalitarian police
is not to discover crimes, but to be on
hand when the government decides to arrest a certain category of the popu-
lation.
Their chief pohtical
distinction
is
that they
alone
are
in
the con-
fidence
of
the
highest
authority
and know
which
political
line
will
be
enforced. This does not apply only to matters of high policy, such as the liqui-
dation of a whole class or ethnic group (only the cadres of the GPU knew
the actual goal of the Soviet government
in the early
thirties and only the
SS formations knew
that
the Jews were
to be exterminated
in
the
early
forties); the point about everyday
life under
totalitarian conditions
is that
only
the
agents of the NKVD
in an
industrial
enterprise
are informed of
what Moscow wants when
it orders, for instance, a speed-up in the fabrica-
tion of pipes—whether
it simply wants more pipes, or to ruin the director of
the factory, or to liquidate the whole management, or to abolish
this par-
ticular factory, or, finally, to have this order repeated
all over the nation so
that a new purge can begin.
One
of
the
reasons for the
duplication of
secret
services whose
agents
are unknown to each other
is that total domination needs the most extreme
flexibility;
to use our example, Moscow may not yet know, when
it gives
its
order
for
pipes, whether
it wants
pipes—which
are always needed—or
a
purge.
Multiplication
of
secret
services
makes
last-minute
changes
pos-
sible, so that one branch may be preparing to bestow the Order of Lenin
on the director of the factory while another makes arrangements for his ar-
rest. The efficiency of the police consists in the fact that such contradictory
assignments can be prepared simultaneously.
Under
totalitarian,
as under other regimes,
the
secret police has
a mo-
nopoly on certain vital information. But the kind of knowledge that can be
possessed only by the police has undergone an important change: the police
are no longer concerned with knowing what is going on in the heads of future
victims (most of the time they ignore who these victims
will be), and the
police have become the trustees of the greatest state secrets. This automati-
cally means a great improvement in prestige and position, even though
it
is
accompanied by a definite loss of real power. The secret services no longer
know anything that the Leader does not know better;
in terms of power,
they have sunk to the level of the executioner.
From a legal point of view, even more interesting than the change from
the
suspect
to
the
objective enemy
is
the
totalitarian replacement
of the
suspected offense by the possible crime. The possible crime
is no more sub-
jective than the objective enemy. While the suspect is arrested because he
is
thought to be capable of committing a crime that more or less
fits his per-
sonality
(or
his
suspected
personality ),i''i

totalitarian
version
of

possible crime is based on the logical anticipation of objective developments.
The Moscow Trials of the old Bolshevik guard and the chiefs of the Red
Army were classic examples of punishment for possible crimes. Behind the
fantastic, fabricated charges one can easily detect the following logical cal-
culation: developments in the Soviet Union might lead
to a
crisis,
a
crisis
might lead to the overthrow of Stalin's dictatorship,
this might weaken the
country's
military force and possibly bring about a
situation
in which the
new government would have
to sign
a truce or even conclude an
alliance
with Hitler. Whereupon Stalin proceeded to declare that a plot for the over-
throw of the government and
a conspiracy with
Hitler
existed.'"- Against
these "objective," though entirely improbable, possibilities stood only "sub-
jective"
factors, such
as
the
trustworthiness of the
accused,
their
fatigue,
their inability to understand what was going on,
their firm conviction that
without Stalin everything would be
lost,
their sincere hatred of Fascism
that
is, a number of factual details which naturally lacked the consistency of
the
fictitious,
logical,
possible
crime.
Totalitarianism's
central
assumption
that everything
is possible thus leads through
consistent elimination of
all
factual restraints to the absurd and terrible consequence that every crime the
rulers can conceive of must be punished, regardless of whether or not
it has
been committed. The possible crime,
like the objective enemy,
is of course
beyond the competence of the police, who can neither discover, invent, nor
provoke
it. Here again the secret services depend entirely upon the political
authorities. Their independence as
a
state within the
state
is gone.
Only in one respect does the totalitarian secret police
still resemble closely
the secret services of nontotalitarian countries. The secret police has tradi-
tionally,
i.e., since Fouche, profited from
its victims and has augmented the
official state-authorized budget from certain unorthodox sources simply by
assuming a position of partnership in activities
it was supposed to suppress,
such as gambling and prostitution.'"'' These illegal methods of financing itself,
ranging from
friendly acceptance
of bribes
to
outright blackmail, were

'"" The charges
in
the Moscow Trials "were based ... on
a grotesquely brutalized
and
distorting
anticipation
of

developments.
[Stalin's]
reasoning
probably
developed
along
the
following
lines:
they may want
to overthrow me
in
a
crisis—
I
shall charge them
with having made
the attempt. ... A change of government may
weaken
Russia's fighting capacity; and
if they succeed, they may be compelled to sign
a

Hitler, and perhaps even
agree
to a cession of
territory. ...
I
shall

It
is curious to
sec that
the
financing of police
activities with income from
its
victims has
survived
all other changes.
In Soviet Russia,
the NKVD
is almost entirely
dependent
upon
the
exploitation
of
slave
labor
which,
indeed,
seems
to
yield no i>thcr profit and to serve no other purpose but the financing of the
huge secret apparatus."" Himmler
first financed his SS troops, who were the
cadres of the Nazi secret police, through the confiscation of Jewish property;
he then concluded an agreement with Darre, the Minister of Agriculture, by
which Himmler
received
the
several hundred
million marks which Darre
earned
annually
by
buying
agricultural
commodities
cheaply
abroad
and
selling them
at
fixed
prices
in
Germany.'"''* This source
of regular income
disappeared of course during the war; Albert Speer, the successor of Todt
and the greatest employer of manpower
in Germany
after
1942, proposed
a similar deal
to Himmler
in
1942;
if Himmler agreed
to
release from SS
authority
the
imported
slave
laborers whose work had
been
remarkably
incfticient,
the Speer organization would give him
a certain percentage of
the
profits for the
SS.'"" To such more or
less
regular sources of income,
Himmler added
the old
blackmail methods
of
secret
services
in times
of
financial
crisis:
in
their communities SS
units formed groups of "Friends
of the SS" who had to "volunteer" the necessary funds for the needs of the
local SS men.'"'
(It
is noteworthy that in
its various financial operations the
Nazi secret
police did not exploit
its prisoners. Except
in the
last years of
the war, when the use of human material
in the concentration camps was
no longer determined by Himmler
alone, work
in the camps "had no
ra-
tional
purpose
except
that
of
increasing
the
burden
and
torture
of
the
unfortunate prisoners."'"**)

It no longer organizes murders on
its own
initiative, no longer
provokes offenses against
state and society, and
it sternly proceeds against
all forms of bribery, blackmail and irregular financial gains. The moral lec-
ture, coupled with very tangible threats, that Himmler could permit himself
to deliver to
his men
in the middle of the war—"We had the moral
right
...
to wipe out
this
[Jewish]
people bent on wiping us
out, but we do
not have the
right to enrich ourselves
in any manner whatsoever, be
it by
a fur coat, a watch,
a
single mark, or a cigarette" ^"^—strikes
a note
that
one would look for in vain in the history of the secret
police.
If
it
still
is
concerned with "dangerous thoughts," they are hardly ones which the sus-
pected persons know to be dangerous; the regimentation of
all
intellectual
and
artistic
life demands a constant re-establishment and revision of stand-
ards which naturally is accompanied by repeated eliminations of intellectuals
whose "dangerous thoughts" usually consist in certain ideas that were
still
entirely orthodox
the day
before.
While,
therefore,
its
police function
in
the accepted meaning of the word has become
superfluous,
the economic
function of the secret police, sometimes thought to have replaced the
first,
is even more dubious.
It
is undeniable, to be sure, that the NKVD periodi-
cally rounds up a percentage of the Soviet population and sends them into
camps

at
a
slightly divergent and
quite
plausible assumption,
accord-
ing
to which
"arrests were
planned
as
follows: The NKVD
files covered
practically
the whole population, and everyone was
classified
in a category. Thus
statistics were
available
in every town showing how many former Whites, members of opposing par-
ties,
etc., were
living
in
them.
All incriminating material
collected

from
prisoners' confessions was
also entered
in
the
files, and each person's card was
marked to show how dangerous he was considered;

suspicious or incriminating material appearing
in
his
file. As the

its unemployment problem,
it
is
also generally known
that
the output
in
those camps
is
infinitely lower than
that
of ordinary
Soviet
labor and hardly suffices to pay the expenses of the police apparatus.
Neither dubious
nor
superfluous
is
the
political
function
of

the most

partments.'"
in the power apparatus of the totalitarian regime.
It constitutes
the true executive branch of the government through which
all
orders
are
transmitted. Through the net of secret agents, the totalitarian ruler has created
for
himself
a
directly
executive
transmission
belt
which,
in
distinction
to
the onion-like
structure
of the
ostensible
hierarchy,
is completely
severed
and
isolated from
all other
institutions."-
In
this
sense,
the
secret
police
agents
are
the only openly
ruling
class
in
totalitarian
countries and
their
standards and scale of values permeate the entire texture of totalitarian so-
ciety.
From
this viewpoint,
it may
not be
too
surprising
that
certain
peculiar
qualities of the secret police are general qualities of totalitarian society rather
than
peculiarities of the totalitarian secret
police. The category of the sus-
pect thus embraces under totalitarian conditions the total population; every
thought that deviates from the officially prescribed and permanently chang-
ing line
is already suspect, no matter in which
field of human activity
it oc-
curs. Simply because of their capacity
to think, human beings are suspects
by definition, and this suspicion cannot be diverted by exemplary behavior,
for
the human capacity
to think
is
also
a capacity
to change one's mind.
Since, moreover,
it
is impossible ever to know beyond doubt another man's
heart— torture
in
this context
is only
the desperate and eternally
futile
at-
tempt
to achieve what cannot be achieved—suspicion can no longer be
al-
layed
if neither a community of values nor the predictabilities of self-interest
exist as social (as distinguished from merely psychological)
realities. Mutual
suspicion, therefore, permeates
all
social
relationships
in
totalitarian coun-
tries and creates an all-pervasive atmosphere even outside the special pur-
view of the secret police.
In totalitarian regimes provocation, once only the specialty of the secret
agent, becomes
a method
of dealing with
his
neighbor which everybody,
willingly or unwillingly,
is forced to follow. Everyone, in a way,
is the agent
larly reported lo higher authorities,
it was possible to arrange a purge
at any moment,
with
full knowledge of the exact number of persons
in each category."

will
call himself an

provocateur
if
ever
an
ordinary
friendly
exchange
of
"dangerous
thoughts"
(or what
in
the
meantime
have become
dangerous
thoughts)
should come to the attention of the authorities. Collaboration of the popula-
tion in denouncing political opponents and volunteer service as stool pigeons
are certainly not unprecedented, but in totalitarian countries they are so well
organized that the work of specialists
is almost superfluous.
In a system of
ubiquitous spying, where everybody may be
a
police agent and each
indi-
vidual feels himself under constant surveillance; under circumstances, more-
over, where careers are extremely insecure and where the most spectacular
ascents and
falls have become everyday occurrences, every word becomes
equivocal and subject to
retrospective
"interpretation."
The most
striking
illustration
of
the
permeation
of
totalitarian
society
with
secret
police methods and standards can be found
in
the
matter
of
careers. The double agent in nontotalitarian regimes served the cause he was
supposed to combat almost as much
as, and sometimes more than, the au-
thorities. Frequently he harbored
a
sort of double ambition:
he wanted to
rise in the ranks of the revolutionary parties as well as in the ranks of the
services. In order to win promotion in both fields, he had only to adopt cer-
tain methods which
in
a normal society belong to the secret daydreams of
the small employee who depends on seniority for advancement: through his
connections with the
police, he could certainly eliminate
his
rivals and su-
periors in the party, and through his connections with the revolutionaries he
had at least a chance to get rid of his chief in the police.'^'' If we consider the
career conditions in present Russian society, the similarity to such methods
is
striking. Not only do
almost
all
higher
officials owe
their
positions
to
purges that removed their predecessors, but promotions in
all walks of
life
are
accelerated
in
this way. About
every
ten
years,
a
nation-wide
purge
makes room for the new generation, freshly graduated and hungry for jobs.
The government
has
itself
established
those
conditions
for
advancement
*which the police agent formerly had to create.
This
regular
violent turnover
of
the whole
gigantic
administrative ma-
chine,
while
it
prevents
the
development
of competence,
has many
ad-
wantages:
it assures the
relative youth of officials and prevents
a
stabiliza-
tion of conditions which,
at least in time of peace, are fraught with danger
lifor totalitarian
rule; by eliminating seniority and merit,
it prevents the de-
velopment of the
loyalties
that usually
tie younger
staff members
to
their
f elders, upon whose opinion and good
will
their advancement "depends;
it
neliminates once and for all the dangers of unemployment and assures every-
one of a job compatible with his education. Thus, in 1939, after the gigantic
t>purge in the Soviet Union had come to an end, Stalin could note with great
lisatisfaction that "the Party was
able
to promote
to leading posts
in
State
or Party
affairs more than 500,000 young Bolsheviks.""'* The humiliation

TOTALITARIANISM
implicit
in owing a job
to
the
unjust elimination of one's predecessor has
the same
demoralizing
elTect
that
the
elimination
of
the
Jews
had upon
the German
professions:
it makes every jobholder
a conscious accomplice
in
the crimes
of
the government,
their
beneficiary whether
he
likes
it
or
not. with the result that the more sensitive the humiliated individual happens
to
be.
the more
ardently
he
will defend
the
regime.
In
other
words,
this
system
is the
logical outgrowth
of the Leader
principle
in
its
full
implica-
tions and the best possible guarantee for loyalty,
in that
it makes every new
generation depend
for
its
livelihood
on
the
current
political
line
of
the
Leader which started the job-creating purge.
It
also
realizes the
identity of
public and
private
interests, of which defenders of the
Soviet Union used
to be so proud
(or.
in the Nazi version, the abolition of the private sphere
of
life), insofar as every individual of any consequence owes his whole ex-
istence to the
political
interest of the regime; and when this factual
identity
of
interest
is broken and
the next purge has swept him out
of
office,
the
regime makes sure that he disappears from the world of the living. In a not
very
dilTerent way.
the double
agent was
identified
with
the
cause
of
the
revolution
(without which
he would
lose
his job), and not only with
the
secret
police;
in
that
sphere,
too,
a spectacular
rise could end only
in an
anonymous death, since
it was
rather unlikely
that the double game could
be played forever. The
totalitarian government, when
it set such conditions
for promotion
in
all careers as had previously prevailed only among social
outcasts, has
effected one of the most far-reaching changes
in
social
psy-
chology. The psychology of the double
agent, who was willing to pay the
price of a short
life for the exalted existence of a few years at the peak, has
necessarily become
the philosophy
in personal matters
of the whole
post-
revolutionary generation
in Russia, and to a lesser but
still very dangerous
extent, in postwar Germany.
This
is the society, permeated by standards and living by methods which
once had been the monopoly of the
secret police,
in which the totalitarian
secret police functions. Only
in the
initial stages, when a struggle for power
is
still going on, are
its victims those who can be suspected of opposition.
It
then embarks upon
its
totalitarian career with
the
persecution
of the ob-
jective enemy, which may be the Jews or the Poles
(as
in the case of the
Nazis)
or
so-called
"counter-revolutionaries"—an
accusation
which
"in
Soviet Russia ...
is established
.
.
.
before any question
as to
[the]
be-
havior
[of
the
accused]
has

all"—who may be
people who
at
any time owned
a shop or
a house or "had parents or grandparents who
owned such things," "'* or who happened to belong to one of the Red Army
occupational forces, or were Russians of Polish origin. Only in
its
last and
fully
totalitarian
stage
are
the
concepts
of
the
objective enemy
and
the
logically
possible crime abandoned,
the victims chosen completely
at
ran-
dom and, even without being accused, declared unfit to
live. This new cate-
gory of "undesirables" may consist, as in the case of the Nazis, of the men-

people who happen to have been taken up in that percentage, varying from
one province to another, which
is ordered to be deported.
This consistent arbitrariness negates human freedom more efficiently than
any tyranny ever could. One had at least to be an enemy of tyranny in order
to be punished by
it. Freedom of opinion was not abolished for those who
were brave enough to risk their necks. Theoretically, the choice of opposi-
tion remains in totalitarian regimes too; but such freedom
is almost
invali-
dated
if committing a voluntary act only assures a "punishment" that every-
one
else may have
to bear anyway. Freedom
in
this system has
not only
dwindled down to
its
last and apparently
still
indestructible guarantee, the
possibility
of
suicide, but has
lost
its
distinctive mark because
the conse-
quences of
its exercise are shared with completely innocent people.
If Hit-
ler had had the time to realize his dream of a General German Health
Bill,
the man suffering from a lung disease would have been subject to the same
fate as a Communist in the early and a Jew in the
later years of the Nazi
regime. Similarly, the opponent of the regime
in Russia, suffering the same
fate as millions of people who are chosen for concentration camps to make
up certain quotas, only relieves the police of the burden of arbitrary choice.
The innocent and the guilty are equally undesirable.
The change in the concept of crime and criminals determines the new and
terrible methods
of the
totalitarian
secret
police.
Criminals
are
punished,
undesirables disappear from the face of the earth; the only trace which they
leave behind
is the memory of those who knew and loved them, and one
of the most difficult tasks of the secret police
is to make sure that even such
traces will disappear together with the condemned man.
The Okhrana, the Czarist predecessor of the GPU,
is reported
to have
invented a
filing system in which every suspect was noted on a
large card
in the center of which his name was surrounded by a red circle; his political
friends were designated by smaller red circles and his nonpolitical acquaint-
ances by green ones; brown circles indicated persons in contact with friends
of the suspect but not known to him personally; cross-relationships between
the suspect's friends, political and nonpolitical, and the friends of his friends
were indicated by lines between the respective circles.*^*' Obviously the limi-
tations of this method are set only by the size of the filing cards, and, theo-
retically, a gigantic single sheet could show the relations and cross-relation-
ships of the entire population. And this
is the Utopian goal of the totalitarian
secret
police.
It has given up
the
traditional
old
police dream which
the
lie detector
is
still supposed to realize, and no longer tries to find out who
is who, or who thinks what. (The
lie detector
is perhaps the most graphic
example
of
the
fascination
that
this
dream
apparently
exerts
over
the
mentality of
all policemen; for obviously the complicated measuring equip-
ment can
hardly
establish
anything
except
the
cold-blooded
or
nervous
temperament
of
its
victims.
Actually,
the feeble-minded
reasoning under-
lying the use of this mechanism can only be explained by the irrational wish
that some form of mind reading were
possible
after
all.)

was terrible enouuh and since time immemorial has invariably led to torture
and
the most abominable
cruelties. There was only one thing
in
its favor:
it
asked
for
the
impossible. The modern dream
of the
totalitarian
police,
with
its modern techniques,
is incomparably more
terrible. Now the
police
dreams
that one look
at the gigantic map on the
office
wall should
suffice
at
any
given moment
to
establish who
is
related
to whom
and
in
what
degree
of
intimacy:
and,
theoretically,
this dream
is
not
unrealizable
al-
though
its
technical
execution
is bound
to
be somewhat
difficult.
If
this
map
really
did
exist,
not
even memory would
stand
in
the way
of
the
totalitarian
claim
to
domination;
such
a map
might make
it
possible
tc
obliterate people without any
traces,
as
if they had never existed
at
all.
If
the
reports
of
arrested NKVD
agents
can
be
trusted,
the
Russian
secret
police
has come
uncomfortably
close
to
this
ideal
of
totalitarian
rule.
The
police
has
secret
dossiers
about
each
inhabitant
of
the
vast
country, carefully
listing the many
relationships
that
exist between people,
from chance
acquaintances
to
genuine
friendship
to
family
relations;
for
it
is only to discover these relationships that the defendants, whose "crimes"
have anyway been established "objectively" prior to their
arrest,
are ques-
tioned
so
closely.
Finally,
as
for
the
gift
of memory
so
dangerous
to
totalitarian
rule,
foreign
observers
feel
that
"if
it
is
true
that
elephants
never forget, Russians seem to us to be the very opposite of elephants.
.
.
.
Soviet Russian psychology seems to make forgetfulness
really
possible.""''
How
important
to
the
total-domination
apparatus
this complete
disap-
pearance
of
its
victims
is can be
seen
in those
instances
where,
for one
reason or another, the regime was confronted with the memory of survivors.
During the war, one SS commandant made the
terrible mistake of inform-
ing
a
French woman
of her husband's
death
in
a German concentration
camp;
this
slip caused
a small avalanche of orders and
instructions to
all
camp commandants, warning them
that
under no
circumstances was
in-
formation ever to be given to the outside world. ^"^ The point
is that, as far
as the French widow was concerned, her husband had supposedly ceased to
live
at the moment of
his
arrest, or rather had ceased ever
to have
lived.
Similarly,
the
Soviet
police
officers, accustomed
to
this system
since
their
birth, could only
stare
in amazement
at those people
in occupied Poland
who
tried desperately to
find out what had happened to
their friends and
relatives under arrest.""
In
totalitarian countries
all
places of detention
ruled by
the
police
are
made
to be
veritable holes of oblivion
into which people stumble by
acci-
dent and without leaving behind them such ordinary traces of former exist-
ence as a body and a grave. Compared with this newest invention for doing
away with people, the old-fashioned method of murder, political or criminal,
is inefficient indeed. The murderer leaves behind him a corpse, and although
he tries to efface the traces of his own identity, he has no power to erase the

identity of his victim from the memory of the surviving world. The op)eration
of the
secret poUce, on the contrary,
miraculously
sees
to
it
that
the
vic-
tim
never
existed
at
all.
The connection between secret police and secret societies
is obvious. The
establishment of the former always needed and used the argument of dangers
arising from the existence of the
latter. The totalitarian secret police
is the
first in history which neither needs nor uses these old-fashioned pretexts of
all tyrants. The anonymity of
its victims, who cannot be called enemies of
the regime and whose identity
is unknown to the persecutors until the arbi-
trary
decision of the government
eliminates them from
the world
of
the
living and exterminates their memory from the world of the dead,
is beyond
all
secrecy,
beyond
the
strictest
silence, beyond
the
greatest
mastery
of
double
life that the discipline of conspiratory societies used to impose upon
their members.
The totalitarian movements which, during their rise to power, imitate cer-
tain organizational features of secret
societies and yet establish themselves
in broad daylight, create a true secret society only after their ascendancy to
rule. The secret society of totalitarian regimes
is the secret police; the only
strictly guarded secret in a totalitarian country, the only esoteric knowledge
that exists, concerns the operations of the police and the conditions
in the
concentration camps. ^-' Of course
the
population
at
large
and
the
party
members
specifically know
all the general facts—that concentration camps
exist, that people disappear, that innocent persons are arrested; at the same
time, every person in a totalitarian country knows also that
it
is the great-
est crime ever to talk about these "secrets." Inasmuch as man depends for
his knowledge upon the affirmation and comprehension of his fellow-men,
this generally shared but individually guarded,
this never-communicated in-
formation
loses
its
quality
of
reality
and
assumes
the
nature
of
a mere
nightmare. Only those who are
in possession of the
strictly esoteric knowl-
edge concerning the eventual new categories of undesirables and the opera-
tional methods of the cadres
are
in
a
position
to communicate
with each
other about what actually constitutes the reality for
all. They alone are in a
position to believe
in what they know to be
true. This
is their
secret, and
in order to guard
this secret they are established
as
a
secret
organization.
They remain members even
if
this secret organization
arrests them, forces
them
to make
confessions,
and
finally
liquidates
them.
So
long
as
they
guard the secret they belong to the
elite, and as
a
rule they do not betray
it even when they are in the prisons and concentration camps. ^-^
We already have noted that one of the many paradoxes that offend the

4if,
TOTALITARIANISM
common sense of the
nontotalitarian world
is
the seemingly
irrational
use
which totahtarianism makes of conspiratory methods. The totahtarian move-
ments, apparently persecuted by
the
police, very
sparingly
use methods of
conspiracy
foi
the overthrow of the government
in their struggle for power,
whereas totalitarianism
in power, after
it has been recognized by
all govern-
ments and seemingly outgrown
its
revolutionary
stage, develops
a true
se-
cret
police
as the nucleus of
its government and power.
It seems that
offi-
cial recognition
is
felt
to be a greater menace
to the conspiracy content of
the totalitarian movement, a menace of interior disintegration, than the half-
hearted
police measures of
nontotalitarian
regimes.
The truth of the matter
is
that
totalitarian leaders, though they are con-
vinced that they must follow consistently the fiction and the rules of the ficti-
tious world which were
laid down during their struggle for power, discover
only gradually the full implications of this fictitious world and
its rules. Their
faith
in human omnipotence,
their conviction that everything can be done
through organization, carries them
into experiments which human imagina-
tions may have outlined but human
activity certainly never
realized. Their
hideous discoveries in the realm of the possible are inspired by an ideological
scicntificality
which
has proved
to
be
less
controlled by
reason
and
less
willing to recognize factuality than the wildest fantasies of prescientific and
prephilosophical
speculation. They
establish
the
secret
society which now
no longer operates in broad daylight, the society of the secret police or the
political
soldier or the
ideologically trained
fighter,
in order to be
able to
carry out
the indecent experimental
inquiry
into what
is
possible.
The
totalitarian
conspiracy
against
the
nontotalitarian
world,
on
the
other hand,
its claim to world domination, remains as open and unguarded
under conditions of totalitarian
rule
as
in the
totalitarian movements.
It
is
practically
impressed upon
the co-ordinated population
of "sympathizers"
in the form of a supposed conspiracy of the whole world against their own
country. The
totalitarian dichotomy
is propagated by making
it a duty for
every national abroad to report home as though he were a secret agent, and
by treating every foreigner as a spy for his home government.'-'-
It is for the
practical realization of this dochotomy rather than because of specific secrets,
military and other, that iron curtains separate the inhabitants of a totalitarian
country from
the
rest
of
the
world.
Their
real
secret,
the
concentration
camps, those laboratories in the experiment of total domination,
is shielded
by the totalitarian regimes from the eyes of their own people as well as from
all
others.
For a considerable length of time the normality of the normal world
is
the most efTicient protection
against disclosure of totalitarian mass crimes.

their eyes and ears in the face of the monstrous, just as the mass men did
not trust theirs
in the face of a normal reahty
in which no place was
left
for them.'-^ The reason why the totalitarian regimes can get so far toward
realizing a
fictitious,
topsy-turvy world
is
that
the
outside
nontotalitarian
world, which always comprises a great part of the population of the
total-
itarian country
itself,
indulges
also
in
wishful
thinking and
shirks
reality
in the face of real insanity just as much as the masses do in the face of the
normal world. This common-sense disinclination to believe the monstrous
is
constantly strengthened by
the
totalitarian
ruler
himself, who makes
sure
that no
reliable
statistics, no
controllable
facts and
figures
are
ever pub-
lished, so that there are only subjective, uncontrollable, and unreliable
re-
ports about the places of the
living dead.
Because of this policy, the
results of the totalitarian experiment are only
partially
known.
Although we
have
enough
reports
from
concentration
camps to assess the possibilities of total domination and to catch a glimpse
into the abyss of the
"possible," we do not know
the extent of character
transformation under a totalitarian regime. We know even less how many of
the normal people around us would be willing to accept the totalitarian way
of life—that is, to pay the price of a considerably shorter life for the assured
fulfillment of all their career dreams.
It is easy to realize the extent to which
totalitarian propaganda and even some
totalitarian
institutions answer the
needs
of the new homeless
masses,
but
it
is
almost
impossible
to know
how many of them,
if they are further exposed to a constant threat of un-
employment, will gladly acquiesce to a "population policy" that consists of
regular elimination of surplus people, and how many, once they have fully
grasped their growing incapacity to bear the burdens of modern
life,
will
gladly conform to a system
that, together with
spontaneity, eliminates
re-
sponsibility.
In other words, while we know the operation and the specific function of
the totalitarian secret police, we do not know how well or to what an extent
the "secret" of this secret society corresponds to the secret desires and the
secret complicities of the masses
in our time.

in

must

is sup
posed
to furnish the "theoretical" verification of the
ideology.
The camps are meant not only to exterminate people and degrade human
beings,
but
also serve
the
ghastly experiment
of eliminating, under
scien-
tifically controlled conditions, spontaneity
itself
as an expression of human
behavior and of transforming the human personality
into
a mere
thing,
into
something that even animals are not; for Pavlov's dog, which,
as we know,
was trained to eat not when
it was hungry but when a bell rang, was a per-
verted animal.
Under

circumstances
this
can
never

because
spontaneity can never be entirely eliminated
insofar
as
it
is connected
not

on
the

so
the experiment
of

in

depends on sealing off the
latter against
the world of

the world
of the

in general, even against
the outside world of a country under

isolation
explains
the

that characterize
all

constitute one of the main

it may sound, these camps
are

reveals what

because
this
renders

will be more
readily believed than
the victims who
tell the truth. The Nazis did not even consider
it necessary
to keep this discovery to themselves.

TOTALITARIANISM
by nic.ms of
liberal
rationalizations.
In each one of
us, there
lurks such
a
liberal, wheedling us with
the
voice of common sense. The road to
totali-
tarian domination leads through many intermediate stages for which we can
fmd numerous
analogies and
precedents.
The extraordinarily bloody terror
during the initial stage of totalitarian rule serves indeed the exclusive purpose
of
defeating
the
opponent
and
rendering
all
further
opposition
impos-
sible; but total terror
is launched only after this
initial stage has been over-
come and
the regime no longer has anything to fear from the opposition.
In this context
it has been frequently remarked that in such a case the means
have become the end, but
this
is after
all only an admission, in paradoxical
disguise,
that the category "the end
justifies the means" no longer
applies,
that terror has
lost
its "purpose," that
it
is no longer the means to frighten
people. Nor does the explanation
suffice that the revolution,
as
in the case
of the French
Revolution, was devouring
its own
children,
for
the
terror
continues even
after everybody who might be described
as
a child
of the
revolution in one capacity or another—the Russian factions, the power cen-
ters of
party,
the army,
the bureaucracy—has long
since been devoured.
Many
things that nowadays have become the specialty of totalitarian gov-
ernment
are only
too
well known from
the
study
of
history. There have
almost always been wars of aggression; the massacre of hostile populations
after a victory went unchecked until the Romans mitigated
it by introducing
the parcere suhjeciis; through centuries the extermination of native peoples
went hand
in hand with
the
colonization
of the Americas,
Australia and
Africa; slavery
is one of the oldest institutions of mankind and
all empires
of antiquity were based on the labor of state-owned slaves who erected their
public buildings. Not even concentration camps
are an invention of totali-
tarian movements. They emerge for the
first time during the Boer War,
at
the beginning of the century, and continued to be used
in South Africa as
well
as
India for "undesirable elements"; here,
too, we
first find the term
"protective custody" which was
later adopted by
the Third Reich. These
camps correspond
in many
respects
to the concentration camps
at the be-
ginning of totalitarian
rule; they were used
for "suspects" whose
offenses
could not be proved and who could not be sentenced by ordinary process
of
law.
All
this
clearly
points
to
totalitarian methods
of domination;
all
these are elements they
utilize, develop and crystallize on the basis of the
nihilistic principle
that "everything
is permitted," which they inherited and
already take for granted. But wherever these new forms of domination assume
their authentically totalitarian structure they transcend this principle, which
is
still
tied to the
utilitarian motives and self-interest of the
rulers, and try
their hand
in a realm that up to now has been completely unknown to us:
the
realm where
"everything
is
possible." And,
characteristically enough,
this
is precisely the realm that cannot be limited by either utilitarian motives
or self-interest, regardless of the latter's content.
What runs counter to common sense
is not
the
nihilistic
principle
that
"everything
is permitted," which was already contained
in the nineteenth-
century
utilitarian conception of common sense. What common sense and

TOTALITARIANISM IN POWER
441
"normal people" refuse to believe
is that everything
is
possible.*-* We
at-
tempt to understand elements in present or recollected experience that simply
surpass our powers
of understanding. We
attempt
to
classify
as
criminal
a thing which, as we
all
feel, no such category was ever intended to cover.
What meaning has the concept of murder when we are confronted with the
mass production
of corpses? We
attempt
to
understand
the
behavior
of
concentration-camp
inmates
and SS-men
psychologically, when
the
very
thing that must be realized
is that the psyche can be destroyed even without
the
destruction of the physical man;
that,
indeed,
psyche,
character, and
individuality seem under certain circumstances
to express themselves only
through the rapidity or slowness with which they
disintegrate.*^*^ The end
result in any case
is inanimate men,
i.e., men who can no longer be psycho-
logically understood, whose return to the psychologically or otherwise
in-
telligibly human world
closely resembles
the
resurrection of Lazarus.
All
statements
of common
sense, whether
of
a
psychological
or
sociological
nature, serve only to encourage those who think
it "superficial"
to "dwell
on horrors." *3*
If it is true that the concentration camps are the most consequential insti-
tution of totalitarian
rule, "dwelling on horrors" would seem
to be
indis-
pensable for the understanding of totalitarianism. But
recollection can no
more do
this
than can
the uncommunicative
eyewitness
report.
In
both
these genres there
is an inherent tendency to run away from the experience;
instinctively or rationally, both types
of writer are so much aware of the
terrible abyss that separates the world of the living from that of the living
dead, that they cannot supply anything more than a series of remembered
occurrences that must seem just as incredible to those who relate them as to
their
audience.
Only
the
fearful
imagination
of
those who
have
been
aroused by such reports but have not
actually been smitten
in
their own
flesh, of those who are consequently free from the
bestial, desperate terror
which, when confronted by real, present horror, inexorably paralyzes every-
thing that
is not mere reaction, can afford to keep thinking about horrors.
Such thoughts are useful only for the perception of
political contexts and
the mobilization of political passions. A change of personality of any sort
whatever can no more be induced by thinking about horrors than by the real
experience of horror. The reduction of a man to a bundle of reactions sepa-
rates him as radically as mental disease from everything within him that
is
personality or character. When,
like Lazarus, he
rises from
the dead, he
finds
his personality or character unchanged,
just as he had
left
it.
Just as the horror, or the dwelling on
it, cannot affect a change of char-
acter in him, cannot make men better or worse, thus
it cannot become the
basis of a political community or party in a narrower sense. The attempts to
build up a European elite with a program of intra-European understanding
based on the common European experience of the concentration camps have

TOTALITARIANISM
foundered in much the same manner as the attempts following the first World
War
to draw
political conclusions from
the
international experience of the
front generation.
In both cases
it turned out that the experiences themselves
can communicate no more than nihilistic banalities.''*- Political consequences
such
as postwar
pacifism,
for example,
derived from
the
general
fear
of
war. not from the experiences in war. Instead of producing a pacifism devoid
of reality, the insight into the structure of modern wars, guided and mobilized
by fear, might have led to the realization that the only standard for a neces-
sary war
is the
fight against conditions under which people no longer wish
to
live—and our experiences
with
the
tormenting
hell
of
the
totalitarian
camps have enlightened us only too well about the
possibility of such con-
ditions.''" Thus the fear of concentration camps and the resulting insight into
the nature of total domination might serve to invalidate
all obsolete political
diflcrentiations from
right
to
left and
to introduce beside and above them
the
politically
most
important
yardstick
for
judging
events
in
our
time,
namely: whether they serve totalitarian domination or not.
In any event, the fearful imagination has the great advantage to dissolve
the sophistic-dialectical interpretations of politics which are
all based on the
superstition
that
something good might
result from
evil.
Such
dialectical
acrobatics had
at least a semblance of justification so long as the worst that
man could
inflict upon man was murder. But, as we know today, murder
is
only a limited
evil. The murderer who
kills
a man—a man who has to die
anyway—still moves within the realm of
life and death familiar to us; both
have indeed a necessary connection on which the dialectic
is founded, even
if
it
is not always conscious of
it. The murderer leaves a corpse behind and
does not pretend that his victim has never existed;
if he wipes out any traces,
they
are
those
of
his own
identity, and not
the memory and
grief of the
persons who loved
his victim; he destroys
a
life, but he does not destroy
the fact of existence
itself.
The
Nazis,
with
the
precision
peculiar
to them,
used
to
register
their
operations
in the concentration camps under the heading "under cover of

the
German and the Russian system are not uniform but consist of a
series of
categories
in which people are treated very differently.
In the case of Ger-
many, these different categories used to exist in the same camp, but without
coming
into contact with each other; frequently, the
isolation between the
categories was even stricter than the isolation from the outside world. Thus,

quite differently treated by the Germans than the members of other peoples,
although the former were outspoken enemies of the Nazis. The latter in turn
were
divided
into
those whose
"extermination" was
immediately on
the
agenda, as in the case of the Jews, or could be expected in the predictable
future, as
in the case of the Poles, Russians and Ukrainians, and into those
who were not yet covered by instructions about such an over-all
"final so-
lution," as in the case of the French and Belgians. In Russia, on the other
hand, we must
distinguish
three more or
less
independent systems.
First,
there are the authentic forced-labor groups that live in relative freedom and
are
sentenced
for
limited
periods.
Secondly,
there
are
the
concentration
camps in which the human material
is ruthlessly exploited and the mortality
rate is extremely high, but which are essentially organized for labor purposes.
And, thirdly, there are the annihilation camps in which the inmates are sys-
tematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.
The real horror of the concentration and extermination camps
lies in the
fact that the inmates, even
if they happen to keep alive, are more effectively
cut
off from the world of the
living than
if they had died, because
terror
enforces oblivion. Here, murder
is as impersonal as the squashing of a gnat.
Someone may die as the result of systematic torture or starvation, or because
the camp
is overcrowded and
superfluous human material must be
liqui-
dated. Conversely,
it may happen
that due
to
a shortage
of new human
shipments the danger arises that the camps become depopulated and that the
order
is now given to reduce the death rate
at any price. ^^^ David Rousset
called his report on the period in a German concentration camp "Les Jours
de Notre Mort," and
it
is indeed as
if there were a possibility to give perma-
nence
to
the process
of dying
itself and
to enforce
a
condition
in which
both death and
life are obstructed equally effectively.
It
is the appearance of some radical
evil, previously unknown to us, that
puts an end to the notion of developments and transformations of qualities.
-
Here,
there
are neither
political nor historical nor simply moral standards
but,
at the most,
the
realization
that something seems
to be
involved
in
modern
politics
that
actually should never be
involved
in
politics
as we
used to understand
it, namely
all or nothing—all, and that
is an undeter-
mined
infinity of forms of human living-together, or nothing, for a victory
of the concentration-camp system would mean the same inexorable doom
for human beings as the use of the hydrogen bomb would mean the doom
of the human race.
''^ This happened
in Germany toward
the end of
1942, whereupon Himmler served
notice
to
all camp commandants
"to reduce
the death
rate
at
all
costs." For
it had
turned
out
that
of
the
136,000 new
arrivals,
70,000 were
already dead on
reaching
the camp or died immediately
thereafter. See Nazi Conspiracy,
IV, Annex II.—Later
reports from Soviet Russian camps unanimously confirm that after 1949—-that
is, when
Stalin was
still alive—the death
rate
in the concentration camps, which previously had
reached up to 60 per cent of the inmates, was systematically lowered, presumably due
to a general and acute labor shortage
in the Soviet Union. This improvement
in
living
conditions
should
not
be confused
with
the
crisis of
the
regime
after
Stalin's
death
which,
characteristically enough,
first made
itself
felt
in the concentration camps.

TOTALITARIANISM
I here arc no
parallels
to the
lite
in
the concentration camps.
Its horror
can never be
fully embraced by the imagination for the very reason that
it
stands outside of
life and death.
It can never be fully reported for the very
reason
that
the survivor returns
to the world of the
living, which makes
it
iin|Xissible for him to believe fully in his own past experiences.
It
is as though
he had
a story to
tell of another planet, for the status of the inmates in the
world of the
living, where nobody
is supposed to know
if they are
alive or
dead,
is such
that
it
is
as though they had never been born. Therefore
all
parallels
create
confusion
and
distract
attention
from
what
is
essential.
Forced labor in prisons and penal colonies, banishment, slavery,
all seem for
a moment to offer helpful comparisons, but on closer examination lead no-
where.
Forced labor
as
a punishment
is
limited
as
to time and
intensity. The
convict retains his rights over his body; he
is not absolutely tortured and he
is not absolutely dominated. Banishment banishes only from one part of the
world to another part of the world, also inhabited by human beings;
it does
not exclude from
the human world
altogether. Throughout
history
slavery
has been an institution within a social order; slaves were
not,
like concen-
tration-camp inmates, withdrawn from the sight and hence the protection of
their fellow-men;
as instruments of labor they had
a
definite price and
as
property a definite value. The concentration-camp inmate has no price, be-
cause he can always be replaced; nobody knows
to whom he belongs, be-
cause he
is never seen. From the point of view of normal society he
is abso-
lutely superfluous, although
in times of acute labor shortage,
as
in Russia
and in Germany during the war, he
is used for work.
The concentration camp as an institution was not established for the sake
of any
possible labor
yield; the only permanent economic function of the
camps has been the financing of their own supervisory apparatus; thus from
the economic point of view the concentration camps
exist mostly for their
own sake. Any work that has been performed could have been done much
better and more
cheaply under
different
conditions. ^^^
Especially
Russia,
whose concentration camps are mostly described as forced-labor camps be-
cause
Soviet bureaucracy has chosen
to dignify them with
this name,
re-
veals most clearly that forced labor
is not the primary
issue; forced labor
is
the normal
condition
of
all Russian workers, who have no freedom
of
movement and can be arbitrarily drafted for work to any place at any time.

part of the work exacted

it was superfluous or

it had to be done over two or three times." Also Bettelheim, op.

TOTALITARIANISM IN POWER

The incredibility of the horrors
is closely bound up with their economic use-
lessness. The Nazis carried this tiselessness to the point of open
anti-utility
when in the midst of the war, despite the shortage of building material and
rolling stock, they set up enormous, costly extermination factories and trans-
ported millions of people back and forth.^^" In the eyes of a
strictly
utili-
tarian world the obvious contradiction between these
acts and military ex-
pediency gave the whole enterprise an air of mad unreality.
This atmosphere of madness and unreality, created by an apparent lack
of purpose,
is the real iron curtain which hides
all forms of concentration
camps from the eyes of the world. Seen from outside, they and the things
that happen in them can be described only in images drawn from a life after
death, that
is, a
life removed from earthly purposes. Concentration camps
can very
aptly be
divided
into
three
types
corresponding
to
three
basic
Western conceptions of a
life after death: Hades, Purgatory, and Hell. To
Hades correspond those
relatively mild forms, once popular even in non-
totalitarian countries, for getting undesirable elements of all sorts—refugees,
stateless persons, the asocial and the unemployed—out of the way; as DP
camps, which are nothing other than camps for persons who have become
superfluous and bothersome, they have survived the war. Purgatory
is rep-
resented by
the
Soviet
Union's
labor camps,
where
neglect
is combined
with chaotic forced labor. Hell
in the most
literal sense was embodied by
those types of camp perfected by the Nazis, in which the whole of life was
thoroughly and systematically organized with a view to the greatest possible
torment.
All three types have one thing in common:
the human masses sealed off
in them are treated as if they no longer existed, as
if what happened to them
were no longer of any interest to anybody, as
if they were already dead and
some
evil
spirit gone mad were amusing himself by stopping them
for
a
while between life and death before admitting them to eternal peace.
It
is not so much the barbed wire as the skillfully manufactured unreality
of those whom
it fences
in that provokes such enormous cruelties and
ulti-
mately makes extermination look
like
a perfectly normal measure. Every-
thing that was done in the camps is known to us from the world of perverse,
malignant fantasies. The
difficult thing to understand
is that, like such fan-
tasies, these gruesome crimes took place in a phantom world, which, how-
ever, has materialized, as it were, into a world which is complete with all sen-
sual data of reality but lacks that structure of consequence and responsibility
without which reality remains for us a mass of incomprehensible data. The
result
is that a place has been established where men can be tortured and
slaughtered, and yet neither the tormentors nor the tormented, and least of

films which
the
Allies
circulated
in Germany
and
elsewhere
after
the war showed clearly that
this atmosphere of insanity and unreality
is not
dispelled by pure reportage. To the unprejudiced observer these pictures are
just about as convincing as snapshots of mysterious substances taken at spir-
itualist seances.'-'" Common sense reacted to the horrors of Buchenwald and
Auschwitz
with
the
plausible
argument:
"What
crime
must
these
people
have committed that such things were done to them!"; or,
in Germany and
Austria, in the midst of starvation, overpopulation, and general hatred: "Too
bad that they've stopped gassing the Jews"; and everywhere with the skep-
tical shrug that greets ineffectual propaganda.
If the propaganda of truth
fails to convince the average person because
it
is too monstrous,
it
is positively dangerous to those who know from their
own
imaginings what
they themselves
are
capable
of doing and who
are
therefore
perfectly willing to believe
in the
reality of what they have seen.
Suddenly
it becomes evident
that things which for thousands of years
the
human
imagination
had
banished
to
a
realm beyond human competence
can be manufactured
right here on earth, that Hell and Purgatory, and even
a shadow of their perpetual duration, can be established by the most modern
methods of destruction and therapy. To
these people
(and they
are more
numerous in any large city than we like to admit)
the totalitarian hell proves
only
that
the power of man
is greater than they ever dared to think, and
that man can
realize
hellish
fantasies without making
the
sky
fall
or
the
earth open.
These analogies, repeated in many reports from the world of the dying,' ^®
seem to express more than a desperate attempt at saying what
is outside the
realm of human speech. Nothing perhaps
distinguishes modern masses

radically from
those
of previous
centuries
as
the
loss
of

in
a
Last
Judgment:
the worst have
lost their fear and the best have

Unable as yet to
live without fear and hope, these masses are attracted by
every effort which seems to promise a man-made fabrication of the Paradise
they had longed for and of the Hell they had feared. Just as the popularized
features of Marx's classless society have a queer resemblance to the Messi-

at
all typical for the Ger-
man

camps;
extermination was
handled
systematically
by

not
by
starvation. The condition of the camps was a
result of the war events during the
final
months: Himmler had ordered the evacuation of
all extermination camps
in the East,
the German camps were consequently vastly overcrowded, and he was no longer in a
position
to assure
the food supply
in Germany.

anic Age, so the reality of concentration camps resembles nothing so much
as medieval pictures of Hell.
The one
thing that cannot be reproduced
is what made
the
traditional
conceptions
of
Hell
tolerable
to man:
the
Last Judgment,
the
idea of an
absolute standard of justice combined with the
infinite
possibility of grace.
For in the human estimation there
is no crime and no
sin commensurable
with
the
everlasting torments
of
Hell. Hence
the discomfiture
of common
sense, which asks: What crime must these people have committed
in order
to suffer so inhumanly? Hence
also the absolute innocence of the victims:
no man ever deserved
this. Hence finally the grotesque haphazardness with
which concentration-camp victims were chosen in the perfected terror state:
such "punishment"
can,
with
equal
justice
and
injustice,
be
inflicted on
anyone.
In comparison with the insane end-result—concentration-camp society
the process by which men
are prepared for
this end, and the methods by
which individuals are adapted to these conditions, are transparent and logi-
cal. The insane mass manufacture of corpses
is preceded by the historically
and
politically
intelligible
preparation of
living corpses. The
impetus and
what
is more important, the silent consent to such unprecedented conditions
are the products of those events which in a period of political disintegration
suddenly and unexpectedly made hundreds of thousands of human beings
homeless, stateless, outlawed and unwanted, while millions of human beings
were made economically superfluous and socially burdensome by unemploy-
ment. This in turn could only happen because the Rights of Man, which had
never been
philosophically
established
but
merely formulated, which had
never been
politically secured but merely proclaimed, have,
in their
tradi-
tional form,
lost
all
validity.
The
first
essential
step on
the
road
to
total domination
is
to
kill
the
juridical person
in man. This was done, on
the one hand, by
putting cer-
tain categories of people outside
the protection of the law and forcing
at
the same
time, through
the instrument of denationalization,
the
nontotali-
tarian world into recognition of lawlessness;
it was done, on
the other, by
placing
the
concentration camp
outside
the normal
penal
system, and by
selecting
its
inmates
outside
the
normal
judicial
procedure
in
which
a
definite crime entails a predictable
penalty. Thus
criminals, who for other
reasons are an essential element in concentration-camp society, are ordinarily
sent
to a camp only on completion of their prison sentence. Under
all
cir-
cumstances
totalitarian domination
sees
to
it
that
the
categories gathered
in the camps—Jews, carriers of diseases, representatives of dying classes
have already
lost their capacity for both normal or criminal
action. Propa-
gandistically this means that the "protective custody"
is handled as a "pre-
ventive
police measure,"'^"
that
is,
a measure that deprives people of the
ability to
act. Deviations from this rule
in Russia must be attributed to the
catastrophic shortage of prisons and to a desire, so far unrealized, to trans-

into
a
system
of
concentration
camps. '^'
The
inclusion
of criminals
is
necessary
in order
to make
plausible
the
propaiiandistic claim of the movement that the
institution
exists for asocial
elements."- Criminals do not
properly belong
in
the concentration camps,
if only because
it
is harder to
kill the juridical person
in a man who
is guilty
of some crime than
in a totally innocent person.
If they constitute a perma-
nent category among the inmates,
it
is a concession of the totalitarian state
to the prejudices of society, which can
in
this way most
readily be accus-
tomed to the existence of the camps.
In order, on the other hand, to keep
the camp system
itself intact,
it
is essential as long as there
is a penal sys-
tem
in the country that criminals should be sent to the camps only on com-
pletion
of
their
sentence,
that
is when
they
are
actually
entitled
to
their
freedom. Under no circumstances must
the concentration camp become
a
calculable punishment for definite offenses.
The amalgamation of criminals with
all other categories has moreover the
advantage of making
it shockingly evident to
all other arrivals that they have
landed on the
lowest
level of
society.
It soon
turns
out,
to be
sure,
that
they have every reason to envy the lowest
thief and murderer; but mean-
while the lowest level
is a good beginning. Moreover
it
is an effective means
of camouflage:
this happens only to criminals and nothing worse
is happen-
ing than that what deservedly happens to criminals.
The
criminals everywhere
constitute
the
aristocracy
of the camps.
(In
Germany, during the war, they were replaced in the leadership by the Com-
munists, because not even a minimum of rational work could be performed
under the chaotic conditions created by a criminal administration. This was
merely a temporary transformation of concentration camps into forced-labor
camps,
a
thoroughly
atypical phenomenon
of
limited
duration.)^'*-'' What
places the criminals
in
the
leadership
is not so much
the
affinity between
supervisory
personnel and criminal elements—in
the
Soviet Union appar-
ently the supervisors are
not,
like the SS, a special
elite trained to commit

fact
that only criminals have been sent to the camp

In
Russia,
it
has also been customary from
the beginning
to mix
political prisoners
and criminals. During the
first ten
years of Soviet power, the
Left
political groups en-
joyed certain privileges; only with
the

connection with some definite
activity. They
at
least know why they are in
a concentration camp and therefore have kept a remnant of their juridical
person. For the politicals this
is only subjectively true; their actions, insofar
as they were actions and not mere opinions or someone else's vague suspi-
cions, or accidental membership
in a
politically disapproved group,
are as
a rule not covered by the normal legal system of the country and not juridi-
cally defined.
^^''
To
the amalgam
of
politicals
and
criminals
with which
concentration
camps
in Russia and Germany started
out, was added
at an early date a
third element which was soon to constitute the majority of all concentration-
camp inmates. This largest group has consisted ever since of people who had
done nothing whatsoever that, either in their own consciousness or the con-
sciousness of their tormenters, had any rational connection with their arrest.
In Germany,
after
1938,
this element was represented by masses of Jews,
in Russia by any groups which, for any reason having nothing to do with
their
actions, had incurred
the
disfavor
of the
authorities.
These
groups,
innocent in every sense, are the most suitable for thorough experimentation
in disfranchisement and
destruction
of the
juridical
person, and
therefore
they are both qualitatively and quantitatively the most essential category of
the camp
population.
This
principle
was
most
fully
realized
in
the
gas
chambers which,
if only because of their enormous capacity, could not be
intended for individual cases but only for people in general. In this connec-
tion, the following dialogue sums up the
situation of the
individual:
"For
what purpose, may
I ask, do the gas chambers exist?"—"For what purpose
were you born?"^^" It is this third group of the totally innocent who in every
case fare the worst in the camps. Criminals and politicals are assimilated to
this category; thus deprived of the protective distinction that comes of their
having done
something,
they
are
utterly
exposed
to
the
arbitrary.
The
ultimate goal, partly achieved in the Soviet Union and clearly indicated in
the
last phases of Nazi
terror,
is to have
the whole camp population com-
posed of this category of innocent people.
Contrasting with the complete haphazardness with which the inmates are
selected are the categories, meaningless
in themselves but
useful from the
standpoint of organization, into which they are usually divided on their ar-
rival. In the German camps there were criminals, politicals, asocial elements,
religious offenders, and Jews,
all distinguished by insignia. When the French
set up concentration camps
after the Spanish
Civil War, they immediately
introduced the typical totalitarian amalgam of politicals with criminals and
the
innocent
(in
this
case
the
stateless),
and
despite
their
inexperience
proved remarkably inventive in creating meaningless categories of inmates. ^^^

Oriiiin.illy devised
in oixkv
lo pa-vent any growth of solidarity among the
inmates,
this technique proved
particularly valuable because no one could
know whether
his own category was
better or worse than someone
else's.
In Germany
this
eternally
shifting
though
pedantically
organized
edifice
was given an appearance of solidity by the
fact that under any and
all
cir-
cumstances the Jews were the lowest category. The gruesome and grotesque
part of
it was
that the inmates
identified themselves with
these
categories,
as though they represented a
last authentic remnant of their juridical person.
Even
if we disregard
all other circumstances,
it
is no wonder that
a Com-
munist of 1933 should have come out of the camps more Communistic than
he went
in, a Jew more Jewish, and,
in France, the
wife of a Foreign Le-
gionary more convinced of the value of the Foreign Legion;
it would seem
as though
these
categories promised some
last shred
of
predictable
treat-
ment,
as
though
they embodied some
last
and
hence
most
fundamental
juridical
identity.
While the classification of inmates by categories
is only a tactical, organ-
izational measure,
the
arbitrary
selection of victims
indicates the
essential
principle of the
institution.
If the concentration camps had been dependent
on the existence of political adversaries, they would scarcely have survived
the
first years of the
totiUitarian
regimes. One only has
to take
a look
at
the number of inmates
at Buchenwald
in the years
after
1936
in order
to
understand how
absolutely necessary
the element
of the
innocent was
for
the continued existence of the camps. "The camps would have died out
if in
making
its
arrests the Gestapo had considered only the
principle of oppo-
sition,"'^"* and toward the end of 1937 Buchenwald, with
less than
1,000
inmates, was close to dying out until the November pogroms brought more
than 20,000 new
arrivals.'^'' In Germany,
this element of the innocent was
furnished
in
vast numbers by the Jews
since
1938;
in Russia,
it consisted
of random groups of the population which for some reason entirely uncon-
nected with their actions had fallen into disgrace.'''" But
if in Germany the
really
totalitarian
type
of concentration camp with
its enormous
majority
of completely "innocent" inmates was not established until
1938,
in Russia
it goes back to the early
thirties, since up to 1930 the majority of the con-
centration-camp
population
still
consisted
of
criminals,
counterrevolution-
aries and
"politicals" (meaning,
in
this
case, members
of deviationist
fac-
tions).
Since then there have been so many innocent people
in
the camps
that
it
is
difficult
to classify them—persons who had some
sort of contact
with a foreign country, Russians of Polish origin
(particularly
in the years
1936
to
1938),
peasants whose
villages
for some economic
reason were
liquidated,
deported
nationalities,
demobilized
soldiers
of
the Red Army
who happened to belong to regiments that stayed too long abroad as occu-
pation forces or had become

existence of a
political opposition
is for a concentration-camp system only
a pretext, and the purpose of the system
is not achieved even when, under
the most monstrous terror, the population becomes more or less voluntarily
co-ordinated,
i.e.,
relinquishes
its
political
rights. The aim
of an
arbitrary
system
is to destroy the civil
rights of the whole population, who ultimately
become just as outlawed in their own country as the stateless and homeless.
The destruction of a man's rights, the killing of the juridical person in him,
is
a prerequisite for dominating him entirely. And
this
applies not only
to
special categories such as criminals, political opponents, Jews, homosexuals,
on whom
the
early experiments were made,
but
to every
inhabitant
of a
totalitarian
state. Free consent
is
as much an obstacle to
total domination
as
free
opposition.^'*' The
arbitrary
arrest which chooses among innocent
people destroys the validity of free consent, just as torture—as distinguished
from death—destroys the possibility of opposition.
Any, even the most tyrannical,
restriction of this arbitrary persecution to
certain opinions of a
religious or
political
nature,
to certain modes of
in-
tellectual
or
erotic
social
behavior,
to
certain
freshly
invented
"crimes,"
would
render the camps
superfluous, because
in
the
long run no
attitude
and no opinion can withstand the threat of so much horror; and above
all
it would make for a new system of justice, which, given any stability
at
all,
could not
fail
to produce a new juridical person in man,
that would elude
the totalitarian domination. The so-called "Volksnutzen" of the Nazis, con-
stantly fluctuating (because what
is useful today can be injurious tomorrow)
and the eternally shifting party line of the Soviet Union which, being retro-
active, almost daily makes new groups of people
available for the concen-
tration camps, are the only guaranty for the continued existence of the con-
centration camps, and hence for the continued total disfranchisement of man.
The next decisive step in the preparation of living corpses
is the murder
of the moral person in man. This
is done in the main by making martyrdom,
for the first time in history, impossible: "How many people here
still believe
that a protest has even historic importance? This skepticism
is the real mas-
terpiece
of the
SS.
Their great accomplishment. They have corrupted
all
human solidarity. Here the night has fallen on the future. When no witnesses
are
left,
there can be no testimony. To demonstrate when death can no
longer be postponed
is an attempt to give death a meaning,
to
act beyond
one's own death.
In order to be successful, a gesture must have social mean-,
ing. There are hundreds of thousands of us here,
all living in absolute soli-
tude. That
is why we are subdued no matter what happens." ^°-

TOTALITARIANISM
The c.imps and
the murder of

adversaries
are only
part of or-
ganized oblivion that not only embraces carriers of public opinion such
as
the spoken and the written word, but extends even to the families and friends
of the victim. Grief and remembrance are forbidden.

The
Western
world
has
hitherto, even
in
its darkest periods, granted the slain enemy the
right to be
remembered
as
a
self-evident acknowledgment
of the
fact
that we
are
all
men (and only men).
It
is only because even Achilles
set out for Hector's
funeral,
only
because
the
most
despotic
governments
honored
the
slain
enemy,
only
because
the Romans
allowed
the
Christians
to
write
their
niartyrologies, only because the Church kept
its heretics alive in the memory
of men,
that
all was
not
lost and never could be
lost. The concentration
camps,
by making death
itself anonymous
(making
it
impossible
to
find
out whether a prisoner
is dead or alive) robbed death of
its meaning as the
end of a fulfilled
life. In a sense they took away the individual's own death,
proving that henceforth nothing belonged to him and he belonged to no one.
His death merely set a seal on the fact that he had never really existed.
This attack on the moral person might
still have been opposed by man's
conscience which
tells him that
it
is better to die a victim than to live
as a
bureaucrat of murder. Totalitarian terror achieved
its most terrible triumph
when
it succeeded
in
cutting
the moral person
off from
the
individualist
escape and
in making the decisions of conscience
absolutely
questionable
and equivocal. When a man
is faced with the alternative of betraying and
thus murdering his friends or of sending his wife and children, for whom he
is in every sense responsible, to their death; when even suicide would mean
the immediate murder of his own family—how
is he to decide? The
alter-
native
is no longer between good and evil, but between murder and murder.
Who could solve the moral dilemma of the Greek mother, who was allowed
by the Nazis to choose which of her three children should be killed? ^^*
Through the creation of conditions under which conscience ceases to be
adequate and to do good becomes utterly impossible, the consciously organ-
ized complicity of
all men
in the crimes of totalitarian regimes
is extended
to the victims and thus made really total. The SS implicated concentration-
camp inmates—criminals, politicals, Jews—in their crimes by making them
responsible for a large part of the administration, thus confronting them with
the hopeless dilemma whether to send their friends to their death, or to help
murder other men who happened to be strangers, and forcing them, in any
event,
to behave
like
murderers.''"''^ The

SS), but that the distinguishing Hne between persecutor and persecuted, be-
tween the murderer and his victim,
is constantly blurred.'^"
Once the moral person has been
killed, the one thing that
still prevents
men from being made
into
living corpses
is
the
differentiation of the
in-
dividual, his unique identity. In a sterile form such individuality can be pre-
served through a persistent stoicism, and
it
is certain that many men under
totalitarian
rule have taken and
are
each day
still
taking
refuge
in
this
absolute isolation of a personality without rights or conscience. There
is no
doubt that
this part of the human person,
precisely because
it depends so
essentially on nature and on forces that cannot be controlled by the will,
is
the hardest to destroy (and when destroyed
is most easily repaired ).^'^^
The methods of dealing with
this uniqueness of the human person
are
numerous and we shall not attempt to
list them. They begin with the mon-
strous conditions in the transports to the camps, when hundreds of human
beings are packed into a
cattle-car stark naked, glued to each
other, and
shunted back and forth over the countryside for days on end; they continue
upon arrival
at the camp, the well-organized shock of the
first hours, the
shaving of the head, the grotesque camp clothing; and they end in the utterly
unimaginable tortures so gauged
as not to
kill the body,
at any event not
quickly. The aim of
all these methods,
in any
case,
is
to manipulate
the
human body—with
its
infinite
possibilities of suffering—in such a way
as
to make
it destroy the human person as inexorably
as do certain mental
diseases of organic origin.
It
is here that the utter lunacy of the
entire process becomes most ap-
parent. Torture, to be sure,
is an essential feature of the whole totalitarian
police and judiciary apparatus;
it
is used every day to make people
talk.
This type of torture,
since
it pursues
a
definite,
rational aim, has certain
limitations: either the prisoner talks within a certain time, or he is killed. To
this rationally conducted torture anothc, irrational, sadistic type was added
in the
first Nazi concentration camps and
in
the
cellars
of the
Gestapo.
Carried on for the most part by the SA,
it pursued no aims and w£.s not sys-
tematic, but depended on the
initiative of largely abnormal elements. The
mortality was so high that only a few concentration-camp inmates of 1933
survived these
first years. This type of torture seemed to be not so much a
calculated political institution as a concession of the regime to
its criminal
and abnormal elements, who were thus rewarded for services rendered. Be-
hind the blind bestiality of the SA, there often lay a deep hatred and resent-
ment against
all those who were socially, intellectually, or physically better

afraid of returning
to the outer world.

is that "victim and execu-
tioner are alike ignoble; the lesson of the camps

in
their power. This resentment, which never died out
entirely
in the
camps,
strikes
us
as
a
last remnant
of humanly understandable
feeling.'^'^
The real horror began, however, when the SS took over the administration
of the camps. The old spontaneous bestiality gave way to an absolutely cold
and systematic destruction of human
bodies,
calculated
to destroy human
dignity; death was avoided or postponed
indefinitely. The camps were no
longer amusement parks
for beasts
in human form,
that
is,
for men who
really belonged
in mental
institutions and prisons; the reverse became true:
they were turned into
"drill grounds," on which perfectly normal men were
trained to be full-fledged members of the

for these purposes were not volunteers

Actually
the
experience
of
the concen-
tration camps does show that human beings can be transformed into speci-
mens
of
the human
animal,
and
that
man's
"nature"
is
only "human"
insofar as
it opens up to man the
possibility of becoming something highly
unnatural, that is, a man.
After murder of the moral person and annihilation of the juridical person,
the destruction of the individuality
is almost always successful. Conceivably
some laws of mass psychology may be found
to
explain why
millions
of
human beings allowed themselves to be marched unresistingly
into the gas
chambers, although these laws would explain nothing else but the destruc-
tion of individuality.
It
is more significant that those individually condemned
to death very seldom attempted to take one of their executioners with them,
that
there were scarcely any
serious
revolts, and
that even
in the moment
of liberation there were very few spontaneous massacres of SS men. For to
destroy individuality
is to destroy spontaneity, man's power to begin some-
thing new out of his own resources, something that cannot be explained on
the basis of reactions
to environment and events."'' Nothing then remains
but ghastly marionettes with human
faces, which
all behave
like
the dog
in Pavlov's experiments, which
all
react with
perfect
reliability even when
going to their own death, and which do nothing but
react. This
is the
real
triumph of the system: "The triumph of the SS demands that the tortured
victim allow himself to be led to the noose without
protesting, that he
re-
nounce and abandon himself to the point of ceasing to affirm
his
identity.
And
it
is not for nothing.
It
is not gratuitously, out of sheer sadism, that the
SS men desire his defeat. They know that the system which succeeds in de-
stroying
its victim before he mounts the
scaffold ...
is incomparably
the
best for keeping a whole people in slavery.
In submission. Nothing
is more
terrible than these processions of human beings going like dummies to their
death. The man who sees this says to himself: 'For them to be thus reduced,
what power must be concealed
in the hands of the
masters,' and he turns
away, full of bitterness but defeated.""'-

of

that
behave
in
exactly
the same
way,
is
the model
•'citizen" of
a
totalitarian
state; and such
a
citizen can be produced only
imperfectly outside of the camps.
Ihe uselcssness of the camps, their cynically admitted
anti-utility,
is only
apparent. In reality they are most essential to the preservation of the regime's
power than any of
its other institutions. Without concentration camps, with-
out the undefined fear they
inspire and the very well-defined
training they
offer in totalitarian domination, which can nowhere else be fully tested with
all of
its most
radical
possibilities,
a
totalitarian
state can
neither
inspire
its nuclear troops with fanaticism nor maintain a whole people
in complete
apathy. The dominating and
the dominated would only
too
quickly
sink
back
into
the "old
bourgeois
routine";
after
early
"excesses," they would
succumb to everyday
life with
its human laws; in short, they would develop
in
the
direction which
all observers counseled by common
sense were
so
prone to predict. The tragic fallacy of
all these prophecies, originating in a
world that was
still
safe, was to suppose that there was such a thing as one
human
nature established
for
all
time,
to
identify
this human nature with
history, and thus to declare that the idea of total domination was not only
inhuman but also unrealistic. Meanwhile we have learned that the power of
man
is so great that he really can be what he wishes to be.
It
is in the very nature of totalitarian regimes to demand unlimited power.
Such power can only be secured
if literally
all men, without a single excep-
tion,
are
reliably dominated
in every
aspect
of their
life.
In the realm
of
foreign
affairs new
neutral
territories must constantly be subjugated, while
at home ever-new human groups must be mastered in expanding concentra-
tion camps,
or, when circumstances
require
liquidated
to make room
for
others. The
question
of
opposition
is
unimportant
both
in
foreign
and
domestic affairs. Any neutrality, indeed any spontaneously given friendship,
is from the standpoint of totalitarian domination just as dangerous
as open
hostility,
precisely because
spontaneity
as
such,
with
its
incalculability,
is
the greatest of
all obstacles to total domination over man. The Communists
of non-Communist countries, who
fled or were called
to Moscow, learned
by bitter experience that they constituted a menace to the Soviet Union. Con-
vinced Communists
are
in
this
sense, which
alone
has any
reality
today,
just
as
ridiculous and
just
as menacing
to
the
regime
in
Russia,
as,
for
example, the convinced Nazis of the Rohm faction were to the Nazis.
What makes conviction and opinion of any
sort so
ridiculous and dan-
gerous
under
totalitarian
conditions
is
that
totalitarian
regimes
take
the

TOTALITARIANISM IN POWER
457
greatest pride in having no need of them, or of any human help of any kind.
Men insofar as they are more than animal reaction and fulfillment of func-
tions are entirely superfluous to totalitarian regimes. Totalitarianism
strives
not toward despotic rule over men, but toward a system
in which men are
superfluous. Total power can be achieved and safeguarded only
in a world
of conditioned
reflexes, of marionettes without the
slightest trace
of spon-
taneity.
Precisely because
man's
resources
are
so
great,
he
can
be
fully
dominated only when he becomes a specimen
of the
animal-species man.
Therefore character
is a threat and even the most unjust
legal
rules are
an obstacle; but
individuality, anything indeed
that
distinguishes one man
from another,
is intolerable. As long as
all men have not been made equally
superfluous—and
this has been accomplished only
in concentration camps
—the
ideal of totalitarian domination has not been
achieved.
Totalitarian
states
strive
constantly, though
never
with complete
success,
to
establish
the superfluity of man—by the arbitrary selection of various groups for con-
centration
camps,
by
constant
purges
of
the
ruling
apparatus,
by
mass
liquidations. Common sense
protests desperately
that the masses
are
sub-
missive and that all this gigantic apparatus of terror is therefore superfluous;
if they were capable of telling the truth, the totalitarian rulers would reply:
The apparatus seems superfluous to you only because
it serves to make men
superfluous.
The totalitarian attempt to make men superfluous
reflects
ihe experience
of modern masses of their superfluity on an overcrowded earth. The world
of the dying,
in which men are taught they are superfluous through
a way
of life in which punishment
is meted out without connection with crime, in
which exploitation is practiced without profit, and where work
is performed
without product,
is a place where senselessness
is daiiy produced anew. Yet,
within the framework of the
totalitarian ideology, nothing could be more
sensible and logical;
if the inmates are vermin,
it
is logical that they should
be killed by poison gas;
if they are degenerate, they should not be allowed
to contaminate the population;
if they have
"slave-like souls" (Himmler),
no one should waste
his time trying to re-educate them. Seen through the
eyes of the ideology, the trouble with the camps
is almost that they make
too much sense, that the execution of the doctrine
is too consistent.
While the totalitarian regimes are thus resolutely and cynically emptying
the world of the only thing that makes sense to the utilitarian expectations
of common sense, they impose upon
it
at the same time
a kind of super-
sense which the
ideologies
actually always meant when they pretended to
have found the key to history or the solution to the riddles of the universe.
Over and
above
the
senselessness
of
totalitarian
society
is enthroned the
ridiculous supersense of
its ideological superstition. Ideologies are harmless,
uncritical, and
arbitrary opinions only
as long as they
are not believed
in
seriously. Once their claim to total validity
is taken literally they become the
nuclei of logical systems
in which, as
in the systems of paranoiacs, every-
thing follows comprehensibly and even compulsorily once the
first premise

45,V
TOTALITARIANISM
is accepted. 1 he insanity of such systems
lies not only
in their
first premise
but
in the very logicality with which they are constructed. The curious
logi-
cality of
all
isms,
their simple-minded
trust
in
the salvation value of stub-
born devotion without regard
for
specific, varying
factors,
already harbors
the
first germs of totalitarian contempt for
reality and
factuality.
Common sense trained
in utilitarian thinking
is helpless against this ideo-
logical supersensc,
since
totalitarian
regimes
establish
a functioning world
of no-sense. The ideological contempt for factuality
still contained the proud
assumption of human mastery over the world;
it
is,
after
all, contempt for
reality which makes possible changing the world, the erection of the human
artifice. What destroys the element of pride
in the totalitarian contempt for
reality
(and
thereby
distinguishes
it
radically from
revolutionary
theories
and
attitudes)
is
the supersense which
gives
the contempt
for
reality
its
cogency,
logicality, and consistency. What makes
a truly totalitarian device
out of the Bolshevik claim
that
the
present Russian system
is superior to
all others
is the fact that the totalitarian ruler draws from this claim the logi-
cally
imF)eccable
conclusion
that
without
this
system
people
never
could
have
built such a wonderful thing
as,
let us
say, a subway; from
this, he
again draws the logical conclusion that anyone who knows of the existence
of the Paris subway
is a suspect because he may cause people to doubt that
one can do things only in the Bolshevik way. This leads to the
final conclu-
sion that in order to remain a loyal Bolshevik, you have to destroy the Paris
subway. Nothing matters but consistency.
With these new structures, built on the strength of supersense and driven
by the motor of logicality, we are indeed
at the end of the bourgeois era of
profits and power, as well as at the end of imperialism and expansion. The
aggressiveness of totalitarianism springs not from
lust
for power, and
if
it
feverishly seeks to expand,
it does so neither for expansion's sake nor for
profit,
but only
for
ideological
reasons:
to make
the world
consistent,
to
prove that
its respective supersense has been right.
It
is chiefly for the sake of this supersense, for the sake of complete con-
sistency,
that
it
is
necessary
for
totalitarianism
to destroy every
trace
of
what we commonly call human dignity. For respect for human dignity implies
the recognition of my fellow-men or our fellow-nations as subjects, as builders
of worlds or cobuilders of a common world. No ideology which aims
at the
explanation
of
all
historical
events
of
the
past
and
at mapping
out
the
course of all events of the future can bear the unpredictability which springs
from the fact that men are creative, that they can bring forward something
so new that nobody ever foresaw
it.
What
totalitarian
ideologies
therefore aim
at
is
not
the transformation
of
the outside world
or
the
revolutionizing transmutation
of
society,
but
the transformation of human nature
itself. The concentration camps are the
laboratories where changes
in human nature
are
tested, and
their shame-
fulness therefore
is not just the business of their inmates and those who run
them
according
to
strictly
"scientific"
standards;
it
is
the
concern
of
all
men. Suffering, of which there has been always too much on earth,
is not

TOTALITARIANISM IN POWER
459
the
issue, nor
is the number of victims. Human nature
as such
is
at stake,
and even though
it seems
that these experiments succeed not
in changing
man but only in destroying him, by creating a society in which the nihiHstic
banality of homo homini lupus
is consistently
realized, one should bear
in
mind the necessary limitations
to an experiment which requires global con-
trol in order to show conclusive results.
Until now the totalitarian belief that everything
is possible seems to have
proved only that everything can be destroyed. Yet,
in their effort to prove
that
everything
is
possible,
totalitarian
regimes
have
discovered
without
knowing
it that there are crimes which men can neither punish nor forgive.
When the impossible was made possible
it became the unpunishable, unfor-
givable
absolute
evil which could no longer be understood and explained
by the evil motives of self-interest, greed, covetousness, resentment,
lust for
power, and cowardice; and which therefore anger could not revenge, love
could not endure, friendship could not
forgive.
Just
as the
victims
in the
death factories or the holes of oblivion are no longer "human"
in the eyes
of their executioners, so this newest species of criminals
is beyond the pale
even of solidarity in human sinfulness.
It is inherent in our entire philosophical tradition that we cannot conceive
of a "radical evil," and this
is true both for Christian theology, which con-
ceded even to the Devil himself a celestial origin,
as well as for Kant, the
only philosopher who, in the word he coined for
it,
at least must have sus-
pected the existence of this
evil even though he immediately rationalized
it
in the concept of a "perverted
ill will" that could be explained by compre-
hensible motives.
Therefore, we
actually have nothing
to
fall back on
in
order to understand a phenomenon that nevertheless confronts us with
its
overpowering reality and breaks down
all standards we know. There
is only
one thing that seems
to be
discernible: we may say
that
radical
evil has
emerged in connection with a system in which
all men have become equally
superfluous. The manipulators
of
this system
believe
in
their own
super-
fluousness as much as
in that of
all others, and the
totalitarian murderers
are
all the more dangerous because they do not care
if they themselves are
alive or dead, if they ever lived or never were born. The danger of the corpse
factories and holes of oblivion
is
that today,
with populations and home-
lessness everywhere on the increase, masses of people are continuously ren-
dered superfluous
if we continue to think of our world in utilitarian terms.
Political, social, and economic events everywhere are in a silent conspiracy
with totalitarian instruments devised for making men superfluous. The im-
plied temptation
is well understood by the
utilitarian common sense of the
masses, who
in most countries
are
too
desperate
to
retain much
fear
of
death. The Nazis and
the
Bolsheviks can be
sure
that
their
factories
of
annihilation which demonstrate the swiftest solution to the problem of over-
population, of economically superfluous and socially rootless human masses,
are
as much of an attraction as a warning. Totalitarian solutions may well
survive the
faU
of
totalitarian
regimes
in the form
of
strong temptations
which will come up whenever
it seems impossible to alleviate political, social,
or economic misery in a manner worthy of man.

.MAPTKR thirteen:
IcleologY Bncl Terror:
A Novel Form of Government
IN THE PRECEDING chapcrs we emphasized repeatedly that the means of
total domination are not only more drastic but that totalitarianism differs
essentially from
other forms of
political oppression known
to us
such
as
despotism, tyranny and
dictatorship. Wherever
it
rose to power,
it
devel-
oped
entirely new
political
institutions and
destroyed
all
social,
legal and
political traditions of the country. No matter what the specifically national
tradition or the particular spiritual source of its ideology, totalitarian govern-
ment always transformed classes into masses, supplanted the party system,
not by one-party dictatorships, but by a mass movement, shifted the center
of power from the army to the police, and established a foreign policy openly
directed toward
world
domination.
Present
totalitarian
governments have
developed from one-party systems; whenever these became truly totalitarian,
they started to operate according to a system of values so radically different
from
all others, that none of our traditional
legal, moral, or common sense
utilitarian categories could any longer help us
to come
to terms with, or
judge, or predict their course of action.
If
it
is true that the elements of totalitarianism can be found by retracing
the history and analyzing the
political implications of what we usually
call
the crisis of our century, then the conclusion
is unavoidable that
this crisis
is no mere threat from the outside, no mere result of some aggressive foreign
policy of either Germany or Russia, and that
it will no more disappear with
the death of Stalin than
it disappeared with the fall of Nazi Germany.
It may
even be that the true predicaments of our time will assume their authentic
form—though
not
necessarily
the
cruelest—only when
totalitarianism
has
become a thing of the past.
It
is in the line of such reflections to raise the question whether totalitarian
government, born of this
crisis and
at the same time
its clearest and only
unequivocal symptom,
is merely
a
makeshift arrangement, which borrows
its methods
of intimidation,
its means of organization and
its
instruments
of violence from the well-known political arsenal of tyranny, despotism and
dictatorships,
and owes
its
existence only
to
the
deplorable,
but
perhaps
accidental failure of the traditional political forces—liberal or conservative,
national or socialist, republican or monarchist, authoritarian or democratic.
Or whether, on
the contrary, there
is such
a thing as the nature of
totali-

IDEOLOGY AND TERROR
461
tarian government, whether
it has its own essence and can be compared with
and defined Hke other forms of government such
as Western thought has
known and recognized since the times of ancient philosophy.
If this
is true,
then the entirely new and unprecedented forms of totahtarian organization
and course of action must
rest on one of the few basic experiences which
men can have whenever they
live together, and
are concerned with public
affairs.
If there
is a basic experience which
finds
its
political expression in
totalitarian domination, then, in view of the novelty of the totalitarian form
of government,
this must be an experience which, for whatever reason, has
never before served as the foundation of a body
politic and whose general
mood—although
it may be
familiar
in every
other
respect—never before
has pervaded, and directed the handling of, public
affairs.
If we consider
this
in terms of the
history of ideas,
it seems extremely
unlikely. For the forms
of government under which men
live
have been
very few;
they were
discovered
early,
classified by
the Greeks and have
proved extraordinarily long-lived.
If we apply these findings, whose funda-
mental idea, despite many variations, did not change in the two and a half
thousand years that separate Plato from Kant, we
are tempted
at once to
interpret totalitarianism as some modern form of tyranny, that
is a lawless
government where power
is wielded by one man. Arbitrary power, unre-
stricted by law, yielded in the interest of the ruler and hostile to the interests
of the governed, on one hand, fear
as the principle of action, namely fear
of the people by the ruler and fear of the ruler by the people, on the other
these have been the hallmarks of tyranny throughout our tradition.
Instead of saying that totalitarian government
is unprecedented, we could
also say that
it has exploded the very
alternative on which
all
definitions
of the essence of governments have been based in political philosophy, that
is the alternative between lawful and lawless government, between arbitrary
and legitimate power. That lawful government and legitimate power, on one
side, lawlessness and
arbitrary power on the other, belonged together and
were inseparable has never been questioned. Yet, totalitarian rule confronts
us with a totally different kind of government.
It defies,
it is true, all positive
laws, even to the extreme of defying those which
it has itself established (as
in the case of the Soviet Constitution of 1936, to quote only the most out-
standing example)
or which
it did not care to
abolish
(as
in the case
of
the Weimar Constitution which the Nazi government never revoked). But
it operates neither without guidance of law nor
is
it arbitrary, for
it claims
to obey strictly and unequivocally those laws of Nature or of History from
which
all positive laws always have been supposed to spring.
It
is the monstrous, yet seemingly unanswerable claim of totalitarian rule
that, far from being "lawless,"
it goes to the sources of authority from which
positive laws received
their ultimate legitimation, that far from being arbi-
trary
it
is more obedient to these suprahuman forces than any government
ever was before, and that far from wielding
its power in the interest of one
man,
it
is quite prepared
to
sacrifice everybody's
vital immediate
interests
to the execution of what
it assumes to be the law of History or the law of

^f^2
TOTALITARIANISM
Nature.
Its defiance of positive laws claims to be a higher form of legitimacy
which,
since
it
is
inspired
by
the
sources
themselves, can do away
with
petty
leiiaiity.
lotalitarian
lawfulness
pretends
to
have
found
a
way
to
establish
the
rule
of
justice
on
earth—something
which
the
legality
of
fX)sitive law admittedly could never attain. The discrepancy between legality
and justice could never be bridged because the standards of right and wrong
into
which
positive
law
translates
its own
source
of
authority—"natural
law" governing the whole universe, or divine law revealed in human history,
or customs and traditions expressing the law common
to the sentiments of
all men—are necessarily general and must be valid for a countless and un-
predictable number of cases, so that each concrete
individual case with
its
unrepeatable
set of circumstances somehow escapes
it.
Totalitarian
lawfulness,
defying
legality and
pretending
to
establish
the
direct
reign of justice on earth, executes
the law of History or of Nature
without
translating
it
into standards of
right and wrong for individual
be-
havior.
It
applies the law
directly
to mankind without bothering with
the
behavior of men. The
law
of Nature
or
the
law
of
History,
if
properly
executed,
is expected to produce mankind
as
its end product; and
this ex-
pectation
lies behind the claim to global
rule of
all totalitarian governments.
Totalitarian
policy claims
to transform
the human
species
into
an
active
unfailing
carrier
of
a
law
to which human
beings
otherwise would
only
passively and
reluctantly be
subjected.
If
it
is
true
that
the
link between
totalitarian countries and the civilized world was broken through the mon-
strous crimes of totalitarian regimes,
it
is also true that this criminality was
not due
to simple
aggressiveness,
ruthlessness, warfare and treachery, but
to a conscious break of that consensus iiiris which, according to Cicero, con-
stitutes
a "people," and which,
as
international
law,
in modern times has
constituted the civilized world insofar as
it remains the foundation-stone of
international
relations even under the conditions of war. Both moral judg-
ment and
legal punishment presuppose this basic consent; the criminal can
be judged justly only because he takes part in the consensus iuris, and even
the revealed law of God can function among men only when they
listen
and consent to
it.
At this point the fundamental difference between the
totalitarian and
all
other concepts of law comes
to
light. Totalitarian policy does
not
replace
one
set
of laws
with
another, does
not
establish
its own consensus
iuris,
does not create, by one revolution, a new form of legality.
Its defiance of
all,
even
its own
positive
laws
implies
that
it
believes
it can do
without any
consensus iuris whatever, and
still
not
resign
itself
to
the
tyrannical
state
of lawlessness, arbitrariness and
fear.
It can do without the consensus iuris
because
it promises to release the fulfillment of law from
all action and will
of man; and
it promises justice on earth because
it claims to make mankind
itself the embodiment of the law.
This identification of man and law, which seems to cancel the discrepancy
between
legality and
justice
that
has plagued
legal
thought
since
ancient
times, has nothing in common with the lumen naturale or the voice of con-

IDEOLOGY AND TERROR
463
science, by which Nature or Divinity as the sources of authority for the ius
natiirale
or
the
historically
revealed commands
of God,
are supposed
to
announce their authority
in man himself. This never made man a walking
embodiment of the law, but on the contrary remained distinct from him as
the
authority which demanded consent and obedience. Nature or Divinity
as the source of authority for positive laws were thought of as permanent and
eternal; positive laws were changing and changeable according
to circum-
stances,
but
they
possessed
a
relative permanence
as compared
with
the
much more rapidly changing actions of men; and they derived this perma-
nence from the eternal presence of their source of authority.
Positive laws,
therefore,
are
primarily
designed
to function
as
stabilizing
factors for the
ever changing movements of men.
In
the
interpretation
of
totalitarianism,
all
laws
have become
laws
of
movement. When
the
Nazis
talked
about
the law
of
nature
or when
the
Bolsheviks
talk
about
the
law
of
history,
neither
nature
nor
history
is
any longer the stabilizing source of authority for the actions of mortal men;
they
are movements
in
themselves.
Underlying
the
Nazis'
belief
in
race
laws
as
the expression
of
the
law
of nature
in man,
is Darwin's
idea
of
man
as
the product
of
a
natural development which does not
necessarily
stop with the present species of human beings, just as under the Bolsheviks'
belief
in
class-struggle
as
the expression of the law
of
history
lies Marx's
notion of society
as the product
of
a
gigantic
historical movement which
races
according
to
its own law
of motion
to
the end
of
historical
times
when
it
will
abolish
itself.
The
difference between Marx's
historical and Darwin's
naturalistic
ap-
proach
has
frequently
been
pointed
out,
usually
and
rightly
in
favor
of
Marx. This has led us to forget the great and
positive
interest Marx took
in Darwin's
theories; Engels could
not
think
of
a
greater compliment
to
Marx's scholarly achievements than
to
call him
the "Darwin of history."'
If one
considers,
not
the
actual
achievement,
but
the
basic
philosophies
of both men,
it turns out that ultimately the movement of history and the
movement
of
nature
are one and
the same.
Darwin's
introduction
of
the
concept of development into nature,
his insistence
that,
at least in the field
of biology,
natural movement
is
not
circular but unilinear, moving
in
an
infinitely
progressing
direction, means
in
fact
that
nature
is,
as
it
were,
being swept into history, that natural
life
is considered to be historical. The
"natural" law of the survival of the
fittest
is
just
as much a historical law
and could be used
as such by racism
as Marx's law of the survival of the
most
progressive
class. Marx's
class
struggle, on
the
other hand,
as
the
driving force of history
is only the outward expression of the development
' In
his
funeral speech on
Marx,
Engels
said:
"Just
as Darwin discovered
the law
of development of organic
life, so Marx discovered the law of development of human
history." A
similar comment
is found
in
Engels'
introduction
to
the
edition
of
the
Cominiinist Manifesto
in
1890, and
in
his introduction
to
the
Urspnitif; der Familie,
he once more mentions "Darwin's theory of evolution" and "Marx's theory of surplus
value" side by side.

46-t
TOTALITARIANISM
of productive
forces which
in turn have
their origin
in
the "labor-power"
of
men.
Labor,
according
to
Marx,
is
not
a
historical
but
a
natural-
biological
force—released
through
man's
"metabolism
with
nature"
by
which he conserves
his
individual
life and reproduces the
species.'' Engels
saw the
affinity between the
basic convictions of the two men very
clearly
because he understood
the
decisive
role which the concept of development
played
in
both
theories. The
tremendous
intellectual
change
which
took
place
in
the middle of the
last century consisted
in the
refusal to view or
accept anything "as
it
is" and
in the consistent
interpretation of everything
as being only a stage of some further development. Whether the driving force
of
this development was
called
nature
or
history
is
relatively
secondary.
in
these
ideologies,
the term
"law"
itself changed
its
meaning:
from
ex-
pressing the framework of stability within which human actions and motions
can take place,
it became the expression of the motion
itself.
Totalitarian
politics which proceeded to follow the
recipes of ideologies
has unmasked
the
true
nature
of
these
movements
insofar
as
it
clearly
showed that there could be no end to this process.
If
it
is the law of nature
to
eliminate
everything
that
is harmful
and
unfit
to
live,
it would mean
the end
of nature
itself
if new
categories
of the harmful and
unfit-to-live
could not be found;
if
it
is the law of history that in a class struggle certain
classes
"wither away,"
it would mean
the end
of human
history
itself
if
rudimentary new
classes did not form,
so
that they
in turn could "wither
away" under
the hands of
totalitarian
rulers.
In
other words,
the law of
killing by
which
totalitarian movements
seize
and
exercise power would
remain
a law of the movement even
if they ever succeeded
in making
all
of humanity
subject
to
their
rule.
By
lawful government we understand
a body
politic
in which
positive
laws are needed
to
translate and
realize the immutable
ius naturale or the
eternal commandments
of God
into
standards
of
right
and wrong.
Only
in
these
standards,
in
the body
of
positive
laws
of each
country, do
the
ius naturale or the Commandments
of God
achieve
their
political
reality.
In
the body
politic
of
totalitarian government,
this
place
of positive
laws
is taken by
total
terror, which
is designed
to translate
into
reality the law
of
movement
of
history
or
nature.
Just
as
positive
laws,
though
they
define
transgressions,
are independent of them—the
absence
of crimes
in
any society does not render laws superfluous but, on the contrary,
signifies
their
most
perfect
rule—so
terror
in
totalitarian
government
has
ceased
to be
a mere means
for
the suppression
of
opposition, though
it
is
also
used for such purposes. Terror becomes total when
it becomes independent
of
all opposition;
it
rules supreme when nobody any longer
stands
in
its
way.
If lawfulness
is the essence of non-tyrannical government and lawless-
ness
is
the
essence
of
tyranny,
then
terror
is
the
essence
of
totalitarian
domination.

IDEOLOGY AND TERROR
465
Terror
is
the
realization
of
the
law
of movement;
its
chief aim
is
to
make
it possible for the force of nature or of history to race freely through
mankind, unhindered by any spontaneous human
action. As
such,
terror
seeks to "stabilize" men in order to liberate the forces of nature or history.
It
is
this movement which
singles out the foes of mankind
against whom
terror
is
let loose, and no free action of either opposition or sympathy can
be permitted to interfere with the elimination of the "objective enemy" of
History or Nature,
of the
class or the
race.
Guilt and innocence become
senseless
notions;
"guilty"
is he who stands
in the way
of the
natural or
historical
process which has passed judgment over
"inferior
races,", over
individuals
"unfit
to
live,"
over
"dying
classes
and
decadent
peoples."
Terror executes
these judgments, and
before
its
court,
all concerned
are
subjectively innocent:
the murdered because
they
did nothing
against
the
system, and the murderers because they do not really murder but execute
a death sentence pronounced by some
higher
tribunal. The
rulers them-
selves do not claim
to be
just or
wise,
but only
to execute
historical
or
natural laws; they do not apply laws, but execute a movement in accordance
with
its inherent law. Terror
is lawfulness,
if law
is the law of the move-
ment of some suprahuman force. Nature or History.
Terror as the execution of a law of movement whose ultimate goal
is not
the welfare of men or the
interest of one man but the fabrication of man-
kind, eliminates individuals for the sake of the species, sacrifices the "parts"
for the sake of the "whole." The suprahuman force of Nature or History has
its own beginning and
its own end, so that
it can be hindered only by the
new beginning and the individual end which the life of each man actually
is.
Positive laws in constitutional government are designed to erect boundaries
and establish channels
of communication between men whose community
is continually endangered by the new men born into
it. With each new birth,
a new beginning
is born into the world,
a new world has potentially come
into being. The
stability of the laws corresponds to the constant motion of
all human
affairs,
a motion which can never end
as long as men are born
and
die. The
laws hedge
in each new
beginning
and
at
the same
time
assure
its freedom of movement, the potentiality of something entirely new
and
unpredictable;
the
boundaries
of
positive
laws
are
for
the
political
existence of man what memory
is for his historical existence
: they guarantee
the pre-existence of a common world, the
reality of some continuity which
transcends the individual life span of each generation, absorbs all new origins
and
is nourished by them.
Total terror is so easily mistaken for a symptom of tyrannical government
because
totalitarian
government
in
its
initial
stages
must
behave
like
a
tyranny and raze the boundaries of man-made law. But total terror leaves
no arbitrary lawlessness behind
it and does not rage for the sake of some
arbitrary
will or for the sake
of despotic power of one man
against
all,
least of all for the sake of a war of all against
all.
It substitutes for the boun-
daries and channels of communication between individual men a band of
iron which holds them so tightly together that
it
is as though their plurality

4M
TOTALITARIANISM
had disappeared into One Man of gigantic dimensions. To abolish the fences
of laws between men—as tyranny docs—means to take away man's liberties
and destroy freedom as a living political
reality; for the space between men
as
it
is hedged
in by
laws,
is
the
living space of freedom. Total terror uses
this old instrument of tyranny but destroys
at the same time
also the law-
less, fenceless wilderness of fear and suspicion which tyranny leaves behind.
This desert,
to be
sure,
is no longer
a
living space of freedom, but
it
still
provides some room
for
the
fear-guided movements and
suspicion-ridden
actions of its inhabitants.
By
pressing men
against each other,
total
terror destroys
the space
be-
tween them; compared to the condition within
its iron band, even the desert
of tyranny, insofar as
it
is
still some kind of space, appears like a guarantee
of freedom. Totalitarian government does not just curtail
liberties or abolish
essential freedoms; nor does
it,
at
least to our limited knowledge, succeed
in eradicating the love for freedom from the hearts of man.
It destroys the
one
essential
prerequisite
of
all freedom which
is
simply
the
capacity
of
motion which cannot exist without space.
Total
terror,
the
essence
of
totalitarian government,
exists
neither
for
nor against men.
It
is supposed
to provide
the forces of nature or history
with an incomparable instrument to accelerate their movement. This move-
ment, proceeding according to
its own law, cannot
in the long run be hin-
dered; eventually
its force
will always prove more powerful than the most
powerful forces engendered by the actions and the
will of men. But
it can
be slowed down and
is slowed down almost
inevitably by the freedom of
man, which even
totalitarian
rulers cannot deny,
for
this freedom—irrele-
vant and arbitrary as they may deem
it—is identical with the fact that men
are being born and that therefore each of them
is a new beginning, begins,
in a
sense,
the world anew. From the
totalitarian point of view,
the
fact
that men are born and die can be only regarded as an annoying interference
with
higher
forces.
Terror,
therefore,
as
the
obedient
servant
of
natural
or historical movement has to eliminate from the process not only freedom
in any
specific
sense, but the very source of freedom which
is given with
the fact of the birth of man and resides in his capacity to make a new begin-
ning.
In the
iron band of terror, which destroys the
plurality of men and
makes out of many the One who unfailingly
will
act as though he himself
were
part of the course of history or nature, a device has been found not
only to liberate the
historical and natural forces, but to accelerate them to
a speed they never would reach
if
left to themselves.
Practically speaking,
this means
that
terror
executes on
the
spot
the
death
sentences
which
Nature is supposed to have pronounced on races or individuals who are "unfit
to live," or History on "dying classes," without waiting for the slower and
less
efficient processes of nature or history themselves.
In this concept, where the essence of government
itself has become mo-
tion, a very old problem of political thought seems to have found a solution
similar to the one already noted for the discrepancy between
legality and
justice.
If the essence of government
is defined as lawfulness, and
if
it
is

IDEOLOGY AND TERROR
461
understood that laws are the stabilizing forces
in the public
affairs of men
(as indeed
it always has been since Plato invoked Zeus, the god of the boun-
daries,
in
his Laws),
then
the problem
of movement
of the body
politic
and the actions of
its citizens
arises. Lawfulness
sets limitations to
actions,
but does not inspire them; the greatness, but also the perplexity of laws in
free societies
is that they only
tell what one should not, but never what one
should do. The necessary movement of a body
politic can never be found
in
its essence
if only because
this essence—again
since Plato—has always
been defined with a view to
its permanence. Duration seemed one of the
surest yardsticks for the goodness of a government.
It
is
still for Montes-
quieu the supreme proof for the badness of tyranny that only tyrannies are
liable
to be destroyed from
within,
to
decline by themselves, whereas
all
other governments are destroyed through exterior circumstances. Therefore
what the
definition of governments always needed was what Montesquieu
called a "principle of action" which, different in each form of government,
would
inspire government and
citizens
alike
in
their
public
activity and
serve as a criterion, beyond the merely negative yardstick of lawfulness, for
judging
all action
in public
affairs. Such guiding principles and
criteria of
action are, according to Montesquieu, honor in a monarchy, virtue in a re-
public and fear in a tyranny.
In a
perfect
totalitarian government, where
all men have become One
Man, where
all action aims
at the acceleration of the movement of nature
or history, where every single act
is the execution of a death sentence which
Nature or History has already pronounced, that
is, under conditions where
terror can be completely
relied upon
to keep
the movement
in constant
motion, no principle of action separate from
its essence would be needed at
all. Yet as long as totalitarian rule has not conquered
the earth and with
the iron band of terror made each single man a part of one mankind, terror
in its double function as essence of government and principle, not of action,
but of motion, cannot be fully realized. Just as lawfulness in constitutional
government
is
insufficient
to
inspire and guide men's
actions,
so
terror in
totalitarian government is not sufficient to inspire and guide human behavior.
While under present conditions
totalitarian domination
still shares with
other forms of government the need for a guide for the behavior of
its
citi-
zens
in public
affairs,
it does not need and could not even use a principle
of action
strictly speaking,
since
it
will eliminate
precisely the capacity of
man to
act. Under conditions of total terror not even fear can any longer
serve
as an advisor of how
to behave, because
terror chooses
its
victims
without reference to individual actions or thoughts, exclusively in accordance
v^ath the
objective
necessity of the
natural or
historical
process. Under to-
talitarian conditions,
fear probably
is more widespread than ever before;
but fear has lost
its practical usefulness when actions guided by
it can no
longer help to avoid the dangers man fears. The same
is true for sympathy
or support of the regime; for total terror not only selects
its victims accord-
ing
to
objective
standards;
it chooses
its
executioners
with
as
complete
a disregard as possible for the candidate's conviction and sympathies. The

46S
TOTALITARIANISM
consistent
elimination of conviction
as
a motive
for
action has become
a
matter of record
since
the
great
purges
in Soviet Russia and
the
satelhte
countries. The aim of totalitarian education
has never been
to
instill con-
victions but to destroy the capacity to form any. The introduction of purely
objective
criteria into the selective system of the SS troops was Himmler's
great organizational invention; he selected the candidates from photographs
according to purely
racial
criteria. Nature
itself decided, not only who was
to
be
eliminated,
but
also who
was
to
be
trained
as
an
executioner.
No guiding principle of behavior, taken
itself from the realm
of human
action, such as virtue, honor, fear,
is necessary or can be useful to
set into
mi>tion
a body
politic which no longer uses terror as a means of intimida-
tion, but whose essence
is
terror.
In
its stead,
it has introduced an entirely
new
principle
into public
affairs
that dispenses with human
will
to
action
altogether and
appeals
to
the craving need
for some
insight
into
the law
of movement according to which the terror functions and upon which, there-
fore,
all private destinies depend.
The inhabitants of a
totalitarian country
are thrown
into and caught
in
the process of nature or history for the sake of accelerating
its movement;
as such, they can only be executioners or victims of
its inherent law. The
process may decide
that
those who today eliminate
races and
individuals
or the members of dying classes and decadent peoples are tomorrow those
who must be sacrificed. What totalitarian
rule needs to guide
the behavior
of
its subjects
is a preparation to
fit each of them equally well for the role
of executioner and the
role of victim. This two-sided preparation, the sub-
stitute for a principle of action,
is the ideology.
Ideologies—isms which to the satisfaction of their adherents can explain
everything and every occurence by deducing
it from
a single premise—are
a very recent phenomenon and, for many decades, played
a negligible
role
in political
life. Only with the wisdom of hindsight can we discover in them
certain elements which have made them so disturbingly useful for totalitarian
rule. Not before
Hitler and
Stalin were the great
political
potentialities of
the ideologies discovered.
Ideologies are known for their scientific character:
they combine the sci-
entific approach with
results of philosophical
relevance and pretend
to be
scientific
philosophy. The word
"ideology"
seems
to
imply
that
an
idea
can become the subject matter of a science just
as animals are the subject
matter of zoology, and that the suffix -logy in ideology, as in zoology, indi-
cates nothing but the logoi, the scientific statements made on
it.
If this were
true, an
ideology would
indeed be
a pseudo-science and
a
pseudo-philos-
ophy,
transgressing
at
the same
time
the
limitations
of
science
and
the
limitations of philosophy. Deism, for example, would then be the ideology
which treats the idea of God, with which philosophy
is concerned, in the sci-
entific manner of theology for which God
is a revealed reality. (A theology
which
is
not based on
revelation
as
a given
reality but
treats God
as an
idea would be as mad as a zoology which
is no longer sure of the physical,
i

IDEOLOGY AND TERROR
469
tangible existence of animals.)
Yet we know that
this
is only
part of the
truth. Deism, though
it denies divine revelation, does not simply make "sci-
entific" statements on a God which
is only an "idea," but uses the idea of
God in order to explain the course of the world. The "ideas" of isms—race
in racism, God in deism, etc.—never form the subject matter of the ideologies
and the suffix -logy never indicates simply a body of "scientific" statements.
An ideology
is quite
literally what
its name
indicates:
it
is the
logic of
an
idea.
Its
subject matter
is
history,
to which
the "idea"
is
applied; the
result of this application
is not a body of statements about something that
is, but the unfolding of a process which
is in constant change. The ideology
treats the course of events
as though
it followed
the same
"law"
as
the
logical exposition of
its
"idea."
Ideologies pretend
to know the
mysteries
of the whole
historical process—the
secrets
of the
past,
the
intricacies of
the
present, the uncertainties of the future—because of the
logic inherent
in their respective ideas.
Ideologies are never interested in the miracle of being. They are historical,
concerned with becoming and perishing, with the
rise and
fall of cultures,
even
if they
try
to
explain
history by some
"law
of
nature." The word
"race"
in racism does
not
signify any genuine
curiosity about
the human
races
as
a
field for
scientific
exploration, but
is
the
"idea" by which
the
movement of history
is explained as one consistent process.
The "idea" of an ideology
is neither Plato's eternal essence grasped by
the
eyes
of
the mind
nor
Kant's
regulative
principle
of
reason
but
has
become
an
instrument
of
explanation. To
an
ideology,
history
does
not
appear
in
the
light
of an
idea
(which would
imply
that
history
is
seen
sub
specie
of some
ideal
eternity
which
itself
is
beyond
historical mo-
tion) but as something which can be calculated by
it. What
fits the "idea"
into this new role
is
its own "logic," that
is a movement which
is the con-
sequence of the "idea"
itself and needs no outside factor to
set
it into mo-
tion. Racism
is the
belief that there
is
a motion inherent in the very idea
of race,
just
as deism
is
the
belief
that
a motion
is
inherent
in
the
very
notion of God.
The movement of history and the logical process of this notion are sup-
posed to correspond to each other, so that whatever happens, happens
ac-
cording to the
logic of one "idea." However, the only possible movement
in the realm of logic
is the process of deduction from a premise. Dialectical
logic, with
its process from
thesis through
antithesis
to synthesis which
in
turn becomes the thesis of the next
dialectical movement,
is
not
different
in principle, once an ideology
gets hold
of
it; the
first thesis becomes the
premise and
its advantage for ideological explanation
is that this dialectical
device can explain away
factual contradictions
as
stages
of one
identical,
consistent movement.
As soon as logic as a movement of thought—and not as a necessary con-
trol of thinking—is applied to an idea, this idea is transformed into a prem-
ise.
Ideological world
explanations performed
this
operation
long
before
it became so eminently fruitful for totalitarian reasoning. The purely nega-

470
TOTALITARIANISM
live coercion of
logic,
the
prohibition
of contradictions, became
"produc-
tive" so that a whole hne of thought could be initiated, and forced upon the
mind, by drawing conclusions
in the manner of mere argumentation. This
argumentative process could be
interrupted
neither by
a new
idea (which
would have been another premise with a different set of consequences) nor
by a new experience. Ideologies always assume that one idea
is sufficient to
explain everything in the development from the premise, and that no experi-
ence can teach anything because everything
is comprehended
in
this con-
sistent process of logical deduction. The danger in exchanging the necessary
insecurity of philosophical thought for the
total explanation of an ideology
and
its Weltanschauung,
is
not even so much
the
risk of
falling
for some
usually vulgar, always
uncritical assumption as of exchanging the freedom
inherent in man's capacity to think for the straightjacket of logic with which
man can force himself almost as violently as he
is forced by some outside
power.
The Weltanschauungen and ideologies of the nineteenth century are not
in themselves
totalitarian, and although
racism and communism have
be-
come
the
decisive
ideologies
of
the
twentieth
century
they
were
not,
in
principle, any "more totalitarian" than the others;
it happened because the
elements of experience on which they were
originally based—the
struggle
between the races for world domination, and the struggle between the classes
for political power in the respective countries—turned out to be
politically
more important than those of other ideologies. In
this sense the ideological
victory of racism and communism over
all other isms was decided before
the
totalitarian movements took hold of precisely these
ideologies. On the
other
hand,
all
ideologies
contain
totalitarian
elements,
but
these
are
fully
developed
only by
totalitarian
movements, and
this
creates
the
de-
ceptive
impression
that
only
racism
and communism
are
totalitarian
in
character. The
truth
is,
rather,
that
the
real
nature
of
all
ideologies was
revealed only in the
role that the ideology plays
in the apparatus of totali-
tarian
domination.
Seen from
this
aspect,
there
appear
three
specifically
totalitarian elements
that
are
peculiar to
all
ideological
thinking.
First,
in their claim to total explanation, ideologies have the tendency to
explain not what
is, but what becomes, what
is born and passes away. They
are
in
all cases concerned solely with the element of motion,
that
is, with
history
in the customary sense of the word.
Ideologies are always oriented
toward history, even when, as in the case of racism, they seemingly proceed
from the premise of nature; here, nature serves merely to explain historical
matters and reduce them to matters of nature. The claim to total explanation
promises
to explain
all
historical happenings,
the
total explanation
of the
past, the
total knowledge of the
present, and the
reliable prediction of the
future. Secondly,
in this capacity ideological thinking becomes independent
of
all experience from which
it cannot
learn anything new even
if
it
is a
question of something that has just come
to pass. Hence ideological think-
ing becomes emancipated from
the
reality
that we
perceive with our
five
senses,
and
insists on
a
"truer"
reality
concealed
behind
all
perceptible
I

IDEOLOGY AND TERROR
471
things, dominating them from
this
place
of concealment and
requiring
a
sixth sense that enables us to become aware of
it. The sixth sense
is pro-
vided by
precisely
the
ideology,
that
particular
ideological
indoctrination
which
is taught by the educational
institutions,
established
exclusively
for
this purpose,
to
train the
"political
soldiers"
in
the Ordensburgen
of the
Nazis or the schools of the Comintern and the Cominform. The propaganda
of the totalitarian movement also serves to emancipate thought from expe-
rience and
reality;
it always
strives
to
inject a
secret meaning
into
every
public,
tangible event and
to
suspect
a
secret
intent behind every
public
political
act. Once
the movements have come
to power,
they proceed
to
change
reality in accordance with their ideological claims. The concept of
enmity
is replaced by
that of conspiracy, and
this produces a mentality in
which reality—real enmity or real friendship—is no longer experienced and
understood
in
its own terms but
is automatically assumed to signify some-
thing else.
Thirdly,
since
the
ideologies have no power
to transform
reality,
they
achieve this emancipation of thought from experience through certain meth-
ods of demonstration.
Ideological thinking orders
facts
into an
absolutely
logical procedure which
starts from an axiomatically accepted premise, de-
ducing everything else from
it;
that
is,
it proceeds with
a consistency that
exists nowhere in the realm of reality. The deducing may proceed logically
or dialectically; in either case
it involves a consistent process of argumenta-
tion which, because
it thinks
in terms of a process,
is supposed to be able
to comprehend the movement of the suprahuman, natural or historical proc-
esses. Comprehension
is achieved by the mind's imitating, either logically or
dialectically, the laws of
"scientifically" established movements with which
through
the
process
of
imitation
it becomes
integrated.
Ideological
argu-
mentation, always a kind of logical deduction, corresponds to the two afore-
mentioned elements
of
the
ideologies—the element
of movement
and
of
emancipation from reality and experience—first, because
its thought move-
ment does not spring from experience but
is self-generated,
and, secondly,
because
it transforms the one and only point that is taken and accepted from
experienced
reality
into an
axiomatic
premise,
leaving from
then on
the
subsequent argumentation process completely untouched from any further
experience. Once
it has established
its premise,
its point of departure, expe-
riences no longer
interfere with
ideological
thinking, nor can
it be taught
by reality.
The
device
both
totalitarian
rulers
used
to
transform
their
respective
ideologies into weapons with which each of their subjects could force him-
self into step with the terror movement was deceptively simple and incon-
spicuous: they took them dead seriously, took pride the one in his supreme
gift for "ice cold reasoning" (Hitler) and the other in the "mercilessness of
his dialectics," and proceeded to drive ideological implications into extremes
of logical consistency which, to the onlooker, looked preposterously "primi-
tive" and absurd: a "dying class" consisted of people condemned to death;
races that are "unfit to live" were to be exterminated. Whoever agreed that

472
TOTALITARIANISM
ihcrc
arc
such
things
as
"dying
classes"
and
did
not draw
the
conse-
quence of killing their members, or that
the
right to
live had something to
do with race and did not draw the consequence of killing "unfit races," was
plainly
either
stupid or
a coward.
This
stringent
logicality
as
a
guide
to
action (Krmeatcs the whole structure of totalitarian movements and govern-
ments.
It
is exclusively
the work of
Hitler and
Stalin who,
although
they
did
not add
a
single new thought
to the
ideas and propaganda slogans of
their movements, for this reason alone must be considered ideologists of the
greatest importance.
What
distinguished
these new
totalitarian
ideologists from
their
prede-
cessors was that
it was no longer primarily the "idea" of the ideology—the
struggle of classes and
the exploitation
of
the
workers
or
the
struggle
of
races and the care for Germanic peoples—which appealed to them, but the
logical
process
which
could
be
developed
from
it.
According
to
Stalin,
neither the idea nor the oratory but "the irresistible force of logic thoroughly
overpowered
[Lenin's]
audience."
The
power,
which Marx
thought was
born when the idea seized the masses, was discovered to reside, not
in the
idea
itself,
but
in
its
logical
process which
"like
a mighty
tentacle
seizes
you on
all sides as in a vise and from whose grip you are powerless to tear
yourself away; you must
either surrender or make up your mind
to
utter
defeat."-' Only when
the
realization of the
ideological
aims,
the
classless
society or the master race, was at stake, could this force show
itself. In the
process of realization, the original substance upon which the ideologies based
themselves as long as they had to appeal to the masses—the exploitation of
the workers or the national aspirations of Germany—is gradually
lost, de-
voured as
it were by the process
itself:
in perfect accordance with "ice cold
reasoning" and the "irresistible force of logic," the workers lost under Bol-
shevik rule even those rights they had been granted under Tsarist oppression
and the German people
suffered a kind of warfare which did not pay
the
slightest regard
to
the minimum requirements
for survival
of the German
nation.
It
is
in the nature of ideological
politics—and
is not simply
a be-
trayal committed for the sake of self-interest or lust for power—that the real
content of the ideology (the working class or the Germanic peoples), which
originally had brought about the "idea"
(the struggle of classes
as the law
of history or the struggle of races as the law of nature),
is devoured by the
logic with which the "idea"
is carried out.
The preparation of victims and executioners which totalitarianism requires
in
place
of Montesquieu's
principle
of
action
is
not
the ideology
itself
racism or dialectical materialism—but
its inherent logicality. The most per-
suasive argument in this respect, an argument of which Hitler like Stalin was
very fond,
is: You can't say A without saying B and C and so on, down to
the end of the murderous
alphabet.

seems to have
its source;
it springs from our fear of contradicting ourselves.
To the extent that the Bolshevik purge succeeds in making
its victims con-
fess to crimes they never committed,
it
relies chiefly on this basic fear and
argues as follows
: We are
all agreed on the premise that history
is a struggle
of classes and on the role of the Party
in
its conduct. You know therefore
that, historically speaking, the Party
is always right
(in the words of Trot-
sky: "We can only be right with and by the Party, for history has provided
no other way of being in the right."). At
this historical moment, that
is in
accordance with the law
of history,
certain crimes are due
to be commit-
ted which
the
Party, knowing
the law
of
history, must
punish. For these
crimes, the Party needs criminals;
it may be that the Party, though knowing
the crimes, does not quite know the criminals; more important than to be
sure
about
the
criminals
is
to
punish
the
crimes,
because
without
such
punishment. History will not be advanced but may even be hindered in
its
course. You,
therefore,
either have committed
the
crimes
or have
been
called by the Party to play the role of the criminal—in either case, you have
objectively become an enemy of the Party.
If you don't confess, you cease
to help History through
the
Party, and have become
a
real enemy.—The
coercive force of the argument is:
if you refuse, you contradict yourself and,
through this contradiction, render your whole
life meaningless; the A which
you said dominates your whole
life through the consequences of B and C
which
it logically engenders.
Totalitarian rulers rely on the compulsion with which we can compel our-
selves,
for
the
limited mobilization of people which even they
still
need;
this
inner compulsion
is
the
tyranny
of
logicality
against
which
nothing
stands but the great capacity of men to start something new. The tyranny of
logicality begins with the mind's submission to logic as a never-ending proc-
ess, on which man relies in order to engender his thoughts. By this submis-
sion,
he
surrenders
his
inner freedom
as
he
surrenders
his
freedom
of
movement when he bows down to an outward tyranny. Freedom as an inner
capacity of man
is identical with the capacity to begin, just as freedom as
a
political
reality
is identical with
a space
of movement between men. Over
the beginning, no logic, no cogent deduction can have any power, because
its chain presupposes,
in the form of
a premise, the beginning. As
terror
is needed
lest with
the
birth
of each new human being a new beginning
arise and raise
its voice in the world, so the self-coercive force of logicality
is mobilized lest anybody ever start thinking—which as the freest and purest
of
all human
activities
is the very opposite of the compulsory
process of
deduction.
Totalitarian government can be
safe only
to
the
extent
that
it
can mobilize man's own will power in order to force him into that gigantic
movement
of
History
or Nature
which
supposedly
uses
mankind
as
its
material and knows neither birth nor death.
The compulsion of total terror on one
side, which,
with
its
iron band,
presses masses of isolated men together and supports them in a world which
has become
a wilderness
for them, and
the
self-coercive
force
of
logical
deduction on the other, which prepares each individual

tion
against
all
others, correspond
to each other and need each
other
in
order to set the terror-ruled movement into motion and keep
it moving. Just
as terror, even
in
its pre-total, merely tyrannical form
ruins
all relationships
between men, so the self-compulsion of ideological thinking
ruins
all
rela-
tionships with
reality.
I he preparation has succeeded when people have lost
contact
with
their fellow men
as
well
as
the
reality around them;
for
to-
gether with
these contacts, men
lose
the capacity
of both experience
and
thought. The ideal subject of totalitarian
rule
is not the convinced Nazi or
the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact
and
fiction
{i.e., the
reality of experience) and the distinction between true
and false
{i.e., the standards of thought) no longer exist.
The question we
raised
at the
start of these considerations and to which
we now
return
is what
kind
of
basic experience
in
the
living-together of
men permeates
a form
of government whose essence
is
terror and whose
principle of action
is the logicality of ideological thinking. That such a com-
bination was never used before
in the varied forms of political domination
is obvious.
Still, the basic experience on which
it
rests must be human and
known
to men,
insofar
as even
this most "original" of
all
political bodies
has been devised by, and
is somehow answering the needs
of, men.
It has frequently been observed that terror can rule absolutely only over
men who
are
isolated
against each
other and
that,
therefore,
one
of
the
primary concerns of all tyrannical government is to bring this isolation about.
Isolation may
be
the
beginning
of
terror;
it
certainly
is
its
most
fertile
ground;
it always
is
its result. This isolation
is, as
it were, pretotalitarian;
its
hallmark
is impotence insofar as power always comes from men acting to-
gether, "acting in concert" (Burke)
; isolated men are powerless by definition.
Isolation and impotence,
that
is
the fundamental
inability
to
act
at
all,
have always been characteristic of tyrannies. Political contacts between men
are severed
in
tyrannical government and
the human capacities
for
action
and power are frustrated. But not
all contacts between men are broken and
not
all human capacities destroyed. The whole sphere of private
life
with
the
capacities
for experience,
fabrication and
thought
are
left
intact. We
know
that the
iron band
of
total
terror
leaves no space
for such
private
life and that the self-coercion of totalitarian
logic destroys man's capacity
for experience and thought just as certainly as his capacity for action.
What we
call
isolation
in the
political sphere,
is called
loneliness
in the
,
sphere
of
social
intercourse.
Isolation and
loneliness
are
not
the same.
I
can be isolated—that
is in a situation
in which
I cannot
act, because there
is nobody who will act with me—without being lonely; and
I can be lonely
—that
is
in a situation
in which
I
as
a person
feel myself deserted by
all
human companionship—without
being
isolated.
Isolation
is
that
impasse
into which men
are driven when the
political sphere of their
lives, where
they act together in the pursuit of a common concern,
is destroyed. Yet iso-
lation, though
destructive of power and
the capacity
for
action,
not only
leaves
intact but
is required for
all
so-called productive
activities of men.

ship or of
art. In isolation, man remains
in contact with
the world
as the
human
artifice; only when the most elementary form
of human
creativity,
which
is the capacity to add something of one's own to the common world,
is destroyed, isolation becomes altogether unbearable. This can happen in a
world whose
chief values
are
dictated by
labor,
that
is where
all human
activities have been transformed into laboring. Under such conditions, only
the sheer effort of labor which
is the effort to keep alive
is left and the rela-
tionship with the world
as a human
artifice
is broken.
Isolated man who
lost
his place
in
the
political realm of action
is deserted by the world of
things as well,
if he
is no longer recognized as homo faber but treated as an
animal laborans whose necessary "metabolism with nature"
is of concern to
no one. Isolation then becomes loneliness. Tyranny based on isolation gen-
erally leaves the productive capacities of man intact; a tyranny over "labor-
ers,"
however,
as
for
instance
the
rule
over
slaves
in
antiquity,
would
automatically be a rule over lonely, not only isolated, men and tend
to be
totalitarian.
While
isolation concerns only the
political realm of
life,
loneliness con-
cerns human
life
as
a whole.
Totalitarian government,
like
all
tyrannies,
certainly could not exist without destroying the public realm of
life, that
is,
without destroying, by
isolating men,
their
political
capacities. But
totali-
tarian domination as a form of government
is new in that
it
is not content
with this isolation and destroys private
life
as well.
It bases
itself on lone-
liness, on the experience of not belonging to the world at
all, which
is among
the most radical and desperate experiences of man.
Loneliness,
the common ground
for
terror,
the
essence
of
totalitarian
government, and
for
ideology
or
logicality,
the
preparation
of
its
execu-
tioners and
victims,
is
closely connected
with uprootedness and
superflu-
ousness which have been the curse of modern masses
since
the beginning
of the industrial revolution and have become acute with the
rise of imperi-
alism at the end of the last century and the break-down of political institu-
tions and social traditions
in our own time. To be uprooted means to have
no place
in the world, recognized and guaranteed by
others;
to be
super-
fluous means not to belong to the world
at
all. Uprootedness can be
the
preliminary
condition
for
supcrfluousness,
just
as
isolation can
(but must
not)
be the
preliminary condition
for
loneliness. Taken
in
itself,
without
consideration
of
its
recent
historical
causes
and
its new
role
in
politics,
loneliness
is
at
the same time
contrary
to
the
basic
requirements
of
the
human condition and one of the fundamental experiences of every human
life. Even the experience of the materially and sensually given world depends
upon my being in contact with other men, upon our common sense which
regulates and controls
all other senses and without which each of us would

in
his own particularity of sense data which
in themselves
are
unrchable and
treacherous. Only because we have common
sense,
that
is
only because not one man, but men
in the plural inhabit the earth can we
trust our immediate sensual experience.
Yet, we have only to remind our-
selves
that one day we
shall have
to leave
this common
world which
will
i!o on
as
before and
for whose
continuity we
are
superfluous
in order
to
realize
loneliness,
the
experience
of being abandoned
by
everything
and
cver>'body.
Loneliness
is
not
solitude.
Solitude
requires
being
alone whereas
lone-
liness shows
itself most sharply
in company with
others. Apart from a few
stray remarks— usuiilly framed
in a paradoxical mood like Cato's statement
(reported by Cicero, De Re Publico,
I,
17): numquam minus solum esse
quam cum solus esset, "never was he
less alone than when he was alone,"
or. rather, "never was he less lonely than when he was in solitude"—it seems
that
Epictetus. the emancipated slave philosopher of Greek
origin, was the
tirst
to distinguish between loneliness and solitude. His discovery,
in
a way,
was
accidental,
his chief
interest being neither solitude nor
loneliness, but
being alone {monos)
in
the sense of absolute independence. As Epictetus
sees
it (Disseriutiones. Book 3, ch.
13) the lonely man (eremos)
finds him-
self surrounded
by
others
with whom
he
cannot
establish
contact
or
to
whose
hostility he
is exposed. The
solitary man, on the
contrary,
is alone
and therefore "can be together with himself" since men have the capacity
of "talking with themselves." In solitude, in other words,
I am "by myself,"
together with my
self, and therefore two-in-one, whereas
in loneliness
I am
actually one, deserted by
all others. All thinking,
strictly speaking,
is done
in solitude and
is a dialogue between me and
myself; but
this dialogue of
the two-in-one does not
lose contact with the world of my fellow-men be-
cause
they
are
represented
in
the
self with whom
I
lead
the dialogue
of
thought. The problem of solitude
is that this two-in-one needs the others in
order
to become one
again:
one
unchangeable
individual whose
identity
can never be mistaken
for that
of any
other. For the confirmation of my
identity
1 depend entirely upon other people; and
it
is the great saving grace
of companionship for solitary men that
it makes them "whole" again, saves
them from the dialogue of thought
in which one remains always equivocal,
restores the
identity which makes them speak with
the single voice of one
unexchangeable person.
Solitude can become
loneliness;
this happens when
all by
myself
I am
deserted by my own
self. Solitary men have always been in danger of lone-
liness, when they can no longer find the redeeming grace of companionship
to save them from duality and equivocality and doubt. Historically,
it seems
as though
this danger became sufficiently great to be noticed by others and
recorded by history only in the nineteenth century.
It showed
itself clearly
when philosophers, for whom alone solitude
is a way of
life and a condi-
tion of work, were no longer content with the fact that "philosophy
is only
for the few" and began to insist that nobody "understands" them. Character-

IDEOLOGY AND TERROR
417
istic
in this respect
is the anecdote reported from Hegel's deathbed which
hardly could have been told of any great philosopher before him: "Nobody
has understood me except
one; and he
also
misunderstood."
Conversely,
there
is always the chance
that
a lonely man
finds himself and
starts
the
thinking dialogue of solitude. This seems to have happened to Nietzsche in
Sils Maria when he conceived Zarathustra. In two poems
("Sils Maria" and
"Aus hohen Bergen")
he
tells of
the empty expectation and
the yearning
waiting of the lonely
until suddenly "um Mittag
war's, da wurde Eins zu
iZwei
.
./ Nun feiern
wir,
vereinten
Siegs
gewiss,/
das Fest der
Feste;/
Freund Zarathustra kam,
der Cast der Gdste!" ("Noon was, when One
became Two
.
.
. Certain of united victory we celebrate the feast of feasts;
friend Zarathustra came, the guest of guests.")
What makes loneliness so unbearable
is the loss of one's own
self which
can be
realized
in solitude, but confirmed
in
its identity only by the
trust-
ing and
trustworthy company
of my
equals.
In
this
situation, man
loses
trust in himself as the partner of his thoughts and that elementary confidence
in the world which
is necessary to make experiences
at
all.
Self and world,
capacity for thought and experience are lost at the same time.
The only capacity of the human mind which needs neither the
self nor
the other nor the world in order to function safely and which
is as independ-
ent of experience as
it
is of thinking
is the ability of logical reasoning whose
premise
is
the
self-evident. The elementary
rules
of cogent
evidence,
the
truism
that two and two equals four cannot be perverted even under the
conditions of absolute loneliness.
It
is the only
reliable "truth" human be-
ings can fall back upon once they have lost the mutual guarantee, the com-
mon sense, men need
in order to experience and
live and know
their way
in a common world. But
this
"truth"
is empty or
rather no
truth
at
all,
because
it does not reveal anything. (To define consistency as truth as some
modern logicians do means to deny the existence of truth.) Under the con-
ditions of loneliness, therefore, the self-evident
is no longer just a means of
the
intellect
and
begins
to
be
productive,
to
develop
its own
lines
of
"thought." That thought processes characterized by
strict self-evident
logi-
cality, from which
apparently
there
is no
escape,
have some
connection
with loneliness was once noticed by Luther (whose experiences in the phe-
nomena of solitude and
loneliness probably were second to no
one's and
who once dared to say that "there must be a God because man needs one
being whom he can trust")
in a little-known remark on the Bible
text
"it
is not good that man should be alone": A lonely man, says Luther, "always
deduces one
thing from
the
other and
thinks
everything
to
the
worst."*
The famous extremism
of
totalitarian movements,
far from
having
any-
thing to do with
true
radicalism,
consists indeed
in
this
"thinking every-
thing to the worst,"
in
this deducing process which always
arrives
at
the
worst possible conclusions.

TOTALITARIANISM
What
prepares men
for
totalitarian
domination
in
the
non-totaUtarian
world
is
the
fact
that
lonchness, once
a
borderline experience
usually
suf-
fered in certain marginal social conditions like old age, has become an every-
day
experience
of
the evergrowing masses
of our
century. The
merciless
process
into which
totalitarianism
drives and
organizes
the
masses
looks
like
a
suicidal escape from
this
reality. The
"ice-cold reasoning" and
the
"mighty tentacle" of dialectics which "seizes you as in a vise" appears
like
a last support in a world where nobody
is reliable and nothing can be relied
upon.
It
is the innor coercion whose only content
is the
strict avoidance of
contradictions that seems to confirm a man's identity outside
all relationships
with others.
It
fits him
into the iron band of terror even when he
is alone,
and
totalitarian domination
tries
never
to
leave him
alone
except
in
the
extreme situation of solitary confinement. By destroying
all space between
men and pressing men against each other, even the productive potentialities
of isolation are annihilated; by teaching and glorifying the logical reasoning
of
loneliness where man knows
that
he
will be
utterly
lost
if ever he
lets
go of the
first premise from which the whole process
is being started, even
the slim chances that loneliness may be transformed into solitude and logic
into thought are obliterated.
If this practice
is compared with that of tyranny,
it seems as
if a way had been found to set the desert
itself in motion, to let
loose a sand storm that could cover
all parts of the inhabited earth.
The
conditions
under which we
exist today
in
the
field
of
politics
are
indeed
threatened by
these
devastating sand
storms.
Their danger
is
not
that they might establish
a permanent world. Totalitarian domination,
like
tyranny,
bears
the germs of
its own
destruction.
Just
as
fear and the im-
potence
from
which
fear
springs
are
antipolitical
principles
and
throw
men
into
a
situation
contrary
to
political
action,
so
loneliness
and
the
logical-ideological deducing the worst that comes from
it represent an anti-
social
situation
and
harbor
a
principle
destructive
for
all human
living-
together. Nevertheless, organized loneliness
is considerably more dangerous
than the unorganized impotence of all those who are ruled by the tyrannical
and arbitrary
will of a single man.
Its danger
is that
it threatens to ravage
the world
as we know
it—a world which everywhere seems to have come
to an end—before
a new beginning
rising from
this end
has had time
to
assert
itself.
Apart from such considerations—which
as predictions
are of
little
avail
and
less consolation—there remains the fact that the crisis of our time and
its central experience have brought forth an
entirely new form of govern-
ment which
as a potentiality and an ever-present danger
is only too
likely
to stay with us from now on, just as other forms of government which came
about
at
different
historical moments and
rested on
different fundamental
experiences have
stayed
with mankind
regardless
of temporary
defeats
monarchies, and
republics,
tyrannies,
dictatorships and
despotism.
But there remains also the truth that every end in history necessarily con-
tains
a new beginning;
this beginning
is
the promise,
the only "message"

IDEOLOGY AND TERROR

which the end can ever produce. Beginning, before
it becomes a historical
event,
is the supreme capacity of man; poUtically,
it
is identical with man's
freedom.

Epiloguei Reflectlons
on the
lliiiiL^ariaii Revolution
As
I WRITE
this, more than one year has passed since the flames of the
.
Hungarian
revolution
illuminated
the
immense
landscape
of
post-
war totalitarianism for twelve long days. This was a true event whose stature
will not depend upon victory or defeat;
its greatness
is secure in the tragedy
it enacted. For who can forget the silent procession of black-clad women in
the
streets of Russian-occupied Budapest, mourning
their dead
in
public,
the
last
political gesture of the revolution? And who can doubt the
solidity
of
this remembrance when one year
after the revolution the defeated and
terrorized people have
still enough
st.rength of action
left to commemorate
once more
in public the death of their freedom by shunning spontaneously
and unanimously
all places of pubHc entertainment, theaters, movies, coffee
houses and restaurants?
The context of circumstances within which the revolution happened was
of great
significance,
but
it was
not compelling enough
to
release one of
those automatic processes that seem almost always to imprison history and
which actually are not even historical,
if we understand by historical what-
ever
is worthy of being remembered. What happened in Hungary happened
nowhere else, and the twelve days of the revolution contained more history
than the twelve years since the Red Army had "liberated" the country from
Nazi domination.
For twelve years everything had happened
according
to expectations
the long dreary story of deceit and broken promises, of hopes against hope
and
final
disillusionment:
from
the
beginning
with
popular
front
tactics
and a sham parliamentary system to the open establishment of a one-party
dictatorship which quickly liquidated the leaders and members of the
for-
merly tolerated parties, until the last stage was set when the native commu-
nist
leaders, whom Moscow
rightly
or wrongly
mistrusted,
were
no
less
brutally
framed,
humiliated
in show
trials,
tortured and
killed
while
the
most despicable and most corrupt elements
in
the
party,
not communists
but Moscow
agents,
ruled
the country.
All
this and much more was
pre-
dictable, not because there were any social or historical forces pressing in
one direction, but because this was the automatic result of Russian hegemony.
It was
as though
the Russian
rulers repeated in great haste
all the
stages

EPILOGUE
481
of the October revolution up to the emergence of totalitarian dictatorship;
the story, therefore, while unspeakably
terrible,
is without much interest of
its own and varies very
Httle; what happened
in one
satellite country hap-
pened
at almost the same moment
in
all others from the Baltic Sea down
to the Adriatic.
The only exceptions to this rule were the Baltic States on the one hand,
and Eastern Germany on the other. The former were unhappy enough to
be
directly incorporated
into
the
Soviet Union, with the consequence that
the ceremonious
repetition of the whole development had to be dispensed
with
and
their
status
immediately
assimilated
to
that
enjoyed
by
other
Soviet
nationalities. When up
to
fifty per cent of the population was de-
ported and the
loss made good by forced random immigration,
it became
clear that they had been assimilated to the status of the Tartars, the Kalmyks
or the Volga Germans, that
is, to those who had been found untrustworthy
during the war against
Hitler. The case of Eastern Germany
is an excep-
tion in the opposite
direction.
It never became even a
satellite country but
remained occupied territory with a Quisling government despite the zeal of
German Moscow agents, with the result that the country, though
still miser-
able enough when compared with
the Bundesrepublik,
fared much
better
economically as well as politically than the
satellites. But these regions are
exceptions only because they, too,
fall into the orbit of Russian power; they
are not exceptions to the
satellite system because they did not belong to
it.
Not even the
difficulties which began shortly
after
Stalin's death can be
called unexpected, because they reflected so faithfully the difficulties, or rather
the controversies, within the top Russian leadership. Here, too, there seemed
to be a repetition of conditions
in the Twenties, before the streamlining of
the international communist movement
into
its eventual
totalitarian shape
had been completed, when every Communist party
split into factions which
faithfully mirrored the faction-ridden Russian party and each spHnter looked
up to its respective Russian protector as to a patron saint—which indeed he
was since the destinies of his proteges
all over the world depended
utterly
upon his own fate.
It certainly was
interesting, and gave food
for thought
about certain unchanging structures
of
this movement,
that
Stalin's
death
was not only followed by the same succession
crisis
as Lenin's thirty years
ago
(which,
after
all,
in the absence of any law of succession
is
rather
a
matter of course), but that the
crisis was met again by the temporary solu-
tion of "collective leadership,"
a term coined by
Stalin
in
1925, and that
the
result in the Communist Parties abroad was again a desperate struggle
to
line up with one of the leaders and form
a faction around him.
Thus,
Kadar is as much a protege of Khrushchev as Nagy was a protege of Malen-
kov. Even in the atmosphere of stark and sometimes sublime tragedy which
the Hungarian
revolution
created,
this
repetitiveness
frequently
bordered
upon the comical,
as when one
of the
last broadcasts
of
the Communist
Free Radio Rajk from Hungary urged "the comrades
to join
the pseudo-
Communist Party of Kadar" and turn
it into a "true Hungarian Communist

4}i2
TOTALITARIANISM
party." For
in the same vein the early opposition to
Stalin had urged
the
comrades
not
to
leave
the
party
but
to use
the Trojan-horse
tactic,
until
Stalin
himself ordered
the same
tactics
for
the German Communists
with
rcs|xrct to the Nazi movement. Fach time the result was the same: the joiners
became true and good
Stalinists and Nazis for
all
practical purposes.
The
Hungarian
revolution
interrupted
these
types
of
automatic
occur-
rences and conscious or unconscious
repetitions
just when
the
student
of
totalitarianism had grown
accustoined
to
them,
and
public
opinion
apa-
thetic. This event was not prepared
at
all by developments
in Poland.
It
was
totally
unexpected
and
took
everybody
by
surprise—those who
did
and
suffered, no
less than
those who watched
in furious impotence from
the outside, or those
in Moscow who prepared
to invade and conquer the
country
like enemy
territory.'
For what happened
here was something
in
which nobody any longer believed,
if he ever had believed
in
it—neither the
communists nor the anti-communists, and least of all those who, either with-
out knowing or without caring about the
price other people would have to
pay, were talking about possibilities and duties of people to rebel against to-
talitarian terror.
If there was ever such a thing as Rosa Luxemburg's "spon-
taneous
revolution"—this sudden
uprising of an oppressed
people
for the
sake of freedom and hardly anything
else, without the demoralizing chaos
of
military
defeat
preceding
it,
without coup
d'etat techniques,
without a
closely
knit
apparatus
of organizers and conspirators,
without
the
under-
mining
propaganda
of
a
revolutionary
party,
something,
that
is,
which
ever>'body, conservatives and
liberals,
radicals and
revolutionists, had
dis-
carded as a noble dream—then we had the privilege to witness
it. Perhaps
the Hungarian professor was
right when he told the United Nations Com-
mission:
"It was unique
in
history, that the Hungarian revolution had no
leaders.
It was
not
organized;
it was
not
centrally
directed. The
will
for
freedom was the moving force in every action."
Events,
past and
present,—not
social
forces and
historical
trends,
nor
questionnaires and motivation
research,
nor any other gadgets
in
the
ar-
senal of the social sciences—are the true, the only reliable teachers of poli-
tical
scientists,
as they are the most trustworthy source of information for
those engaged
in
politics. Once such an event
as the spontaneous uprising
in Hungary has happened, every policy, theory and forecast of future poten-
tialities needs
re -examination.
In
its
light we must check and enlarge our
understanding
of
the
totalitarian form
of government
as
well
as
of
the
nature of the
totalitarian version of imperialism.

I. Nicolaevsky, whose "Battle
in

(July

the most compre-
hensive and the soundest analysis of developments
in
Russia after Stalin's death,
finds
"that the United Nations' report on the Hungarian Revolution has established that the
outbreak
of violence
in Budapest was
the
result
of
cleliherate provocation."
I am not
convinced; but even
if he
is
right,
the
result of Ihe Russian provocation was certainly
unexpected and went far beyond the original intentions.

EPILOGUE
483
i:
Russia
after Statins
Death
SPONTANEOUS AS THE Hungarian
revolution
was,
it cannot be understood
outside the context of developments after Stalin's death. As we know today,
this death occurred on the eve of a gigantic new purge, so that whether he
died a natural death
or was
killed,
the atmosphere
in
the
party's
higher
echelons must have been one of
intense
fear.
Since no successor
existed,
no one appointed by Stalin and no one quick enough or who
felt up to the
task, a struggle for succession among the top leadership followed immedi-
ately and caused the
crisis
in
Soviet Russia and the
satellite countries.
Its
outcome even now, five years after the death of Stalin, may not yet be de-
cided. But one thing
is sure:
one of the most serious
flaws
in
totalitarian
dictatorship
is
its apparent inability to find a solution to this problem.
The attitude of totalitarian dictators in this matter we knew before:
Stalin's
carelessness in occasionally appointing his successor only to
kill or demote
him a few years
later was matched and supplemented by
a few
scattered
remarks of
Hitler on
the
subject;
everything we knew suggested
strongly
that they were convinced
that the
question was of minor importance be-
cause almost anybody would do as long as the apparatus remained
intact.
To understand this carelessness, one must bear in mind that the choice ob-
viously was limited
to a small
circle of people who by the very
fact
that
they were on top and alive had proven their superiority under totalitarian
conditions, with everything
that such
superiority
implies. From
the
totali-
tarian viewpoint, moreover, a binding regulation of succession would intro-
duce an element of
stability,
alien to and possibly in the way of the needs
of the "movement" and
its extreme
flexibility.
If
a succession law existed,
it would indeed be the only
stable, unalterable law
in
the whole
structure
and therefore possibly a
first step in the direction of some kind of legality.
Whatever we may have known, we could not possibly know what would
happen in the case of the dictator's death. Only Stalin's death disclosed that
succession
is an unsolved problem and causes a serious
crisis in which the
relations among the potential successors themselves, between them and the
masses, and the relationship among the various apparatuses on whose sup-
port they can count are involved. Totalitarian leaders, being mass
leaders,
need popularity, which
is no
less
efl'ective
if, under totalitarian conditions,
it
is fabricated by propaganda and supported by
terror. The
first
stage
in
the succession struggle was
a competition for popularity, because none of
the competitors was
well
known,
let
alone
popular—with
the
exception,
perhaps, of Zhukov, who, being an army man, was the least likely to succeed
in rising to power. Khrushchev borrowed tested American devices, travelled
around, shook hands and even learned how to kiss babies. Beria engaged in
an anti-war, appeasement policy whose very extremes were oddly reminiscent
of Himmler's efforts during the last months of the war to succeed Hitler by

^,S-f
TOTALITARIANISM
becoming the man the Allied powers would trust enough to conclude peace
with. Malenkov preached a greater emphasis on consumer goods and prom-
ised
to
raise
the standard of
living.
All
of them
together eventually
liqui-
dated Bcria, not only because
his foreign policy had become dangerous but
also because he was of course the very symbol of popular hatred
in Russia
as
well
as
abroad—which,
again
as
in
the
case
of Himmler,
apparently
everybody knew except
himself.
This competition for mass popularity should not be mistaken for a genu-
ine fear of the masses. Fear, to be sure, was a potent motive for the estab-
lishment of the collective leadership but unlike the triumvirate after Lenin's
death, which was indeed
a mutual
security pact against the "counter-revo-
lution," the collective leadership
after
Stalin's death was a mutual
security
pact of the concerned gentlemen against each other. And anyone who trou-
bles
to
look
up
their
past— all
of them
staunch
Stalinists,
educated
and
tested only
in
the
Stalin
era—will
have
to admit
that
their
fear
of each
other was entirely
justified.
Fear of the masses, on the other hand, would hardly have been
justified.
At the moment of Stalin's death,
the
police apparatus was
still
intact and
later developments proved that one could even afford to break up the police
empire and loosen the terror. For while there was some evidence of boom-
erang effects from
the unrest
in
the
satellite countries—a few student
dis-
turbances, one
strike
in
a Moscow
plant, some very cautious demands
for
more leeway
in
"self-criticism," though
hardly
any demands
for freedom
among the intellectuals-—there has never been any evidence of open revolt
or of the regime's being afraid of
it. Moreover, the
little show of opposition
among intellectuals was highly encouraged from above, and such an encour-
agement,
far from
being
a genuine concession, was one
of
Stalin's
tested
devices of domination. Appeals for "self-criticism" have served for decades
as deliberate provocation by which
to bring opponents
into the open and
test public opinion, whereupon the situation
is dealt with appropriately. As
far as Russia proper
is concerned, Khrushchev's speech
in 1957 informing
the
intellectuals
that they had indulged
in
"incorrect understanding of the
essence of the party's criticism of the Stalin personality cult," underestimated
"the positive
role of Stalin" and should go back to "Socialism realism
.
.
.
[with
itsj
unlimited opportunities"
in developing
"their talents to
glorify,"
was not much more than
a routine performance.
Another aspect of the same speech
is more interesting. For in
it Khrush-
chev announces the establishment of "creative unions" through which "the
creative growth of every
writer,
artist,
sculptor,
etc." would be subject "to
constant comradely concern." Here we find a clue to how he intends to re-
place the restriction of police terror and to the meaning of his insistence on

decentralization. He seems to plan a surveillance exerted not by an outside
(police) body but recruited from the midst of the people,
in
this case the
writers and
artists themselves. This would be an institutionalization of, pos-
sibly an improvement upon,
the mutual spying
principle which permeates
all
totalitarian
societies,
and whose
effectiveness
Stalin had
achieved
by
making information and denunciation of others the only test of loyalty. An-
other
innovation
points
in
the same
direction.
This
is
Khrushchev's new
decree about "social parasites," who will also be selected for punishment in
concentration camps by
the populace
itself.
In other
words,
Khrushchev
proposes to replace certain functions of the
secret police with a highly or-
ganized mob rule,
as though he thought the people by now can be trusted
to be their own policemen and to take the initiative in the selection of victims.
Similar new developments
in
the
techniques of domination can be
dis-
covered in the much discussed decentralization projects. For, far from indi-
cating
a democratization
of
Soviet
society
or
a
rationalization
of
Soviet
economy, they were obviously aimed
at breaking the power of the mana-
gerial
class through
the establishment
of new economic
regions
with new
men to run them.^ The redeployment of Moscow-centralized personnel to the
provinces
assured abo^e
all
their
atomization;
they were now
subject
to
the surveillance of local party
authorities, who
surely
will not
fail to exert
the same "constant comradely concern with the creative growth"
of every
plant and every branch
of
production.
This aim
is
not new; Khrushchev
learned from Stalin that every group of people who begin to show signs of
class identity and solidarity must be broken up, ideologically for the sake of
the
classless
society
and
practically
for
the
sake
of an
atomized
society
which alone can be totally dominated.^ But what Stalin achieved by means
of a permanent revolution and periodic gigantic purges, Khrushchev hopes
to achieve by new devices, built into, so to speak, the social structure
itself
and meant
to assure atomization from
within.
This difference
in method and approach
is important enough, especially
as
it is not restricted to the period of the "thaw."
It was quite striking, though
it has been hardly noticed, that the bloody crushing of the Hungarian revo-
lution, terrible and effective as
it was, did not represent a typically Stalinist

solution.
Stalin most probably would have
preferred
a
police
action
to
a
military operation, and he would certainly have carried
it through, not merely
by execution of leaders and imprisonment of thousands, but by wholesale
deportation and by
consciously
depopulating
the
country.
Nothing
finally
would have been further from
his mind than to send enough aid to prevent
a complete collapse of the Hungarian economy and to stave off mass starva-
tion, as the Soviet Union has done
in the year following the revolution.
It may be too early
to
tell how permanent
this change
in methods
will
turn out to be.
It may be
a temporary phenomenon, a hangover, as
it were,
from the time of collective leadership, of unsolved conflicts within the inner
circle of the regime with the concomitant relaxation of terror and ideological
rigidity. Moreover, these methods are
as yet untried and their effects could
be quite different from those expected. Yet, as
it
is certain that the
relative
relaxation of the post-Stalin era was not caused by pressure from below,
it
seems plausible that certain objective factors strongly favor an abandonment
of some
features and devices which we have come
to
identify with
totali-
tarian rule.
First among them
is the fact that the Soviet Union for the first time suffers
from
a very
real shortage of labor.
In
this
situation,
chiefly due
to severe
losses during the war but also to the country's progressing industrialization,
the
institution
of
slave
labor,
concentration—and
extermination—camps
which, among their other functions,
also had to solve the acute unemploy-
ment problem of the
thirties, caused
partly by the enforced collectivization
of the peasants, are not only obsolete but
positively dangerous.
It
is quite
possible
that
the younger generation objected
to
Stalin's
plans
for
a new
super-purge not only on the grounds of personal security, but because they
felt that Russia was no longer
in a position to afford the prohibitively high
cost in "human material" involved. This seems to be the most plausible ex-
planation of why the liquidation of Beria and his clique was followed by an
apparently serious and successful liquidation of the police slave-empire, the
transformation of some camps into forced settlements, and the
release of a
probably considerable number of inmates.
A second
factor,
closely connected
with
the
first,
is
the emergence
of
Communist China, which because of
its threefold superiority
in population
—600
against 200
million—puts Russia
at
a
serious disadvantage
in
the
half-hidden, but very
real struggle for ultimate supremacy. Even more im-
portant, China,
its adherence
to the
Soviet bloc notwithstanding,
has thus
far refused to follow the Russian depopulation policy; for great as the num-
ber of victims
in the
first years of dictatorial
rule may appear— 15 million
seems a plausible guess— it
is
insignificant
in proportion to the population
when compared with the losses Stalin used to
inflict on his
subjects.'"' These
'The best proof of the difference between Mao's and Stalin's rule may be found in
a comparison of the population censuses in China and Russia. The
last Chinese census,
counting
close
to 600
million
people, was
higher than
statistical
expectations,
while
Russian censuses for decades have been considerably lower than what
statistically was
expected.
In
the absence
of
reliable
figures
for population
losses through
extermina-
tion, one could guess the figure of those who were murdered in Russia from these mil-
lions of people who were
"statistically
lost."

EPILOGUE
487
considerations
of
sheer
numerical
force,
while
they do
not
preclude
the
establishment of a
police
state or necessitate
the
abolition of
rule through
terror, definitely stand in the way of the type of mass liquidation of "inno-
cents" or "objective enemies" which was
so
highly
characteristic
of both
the Hitler and the Stalin regimes.
These factors seem to impel Russia herself to the inner-communist heresy
of national communism which obviously has become the
ruling regime
in
Yugoslavia and
in China.
It
is not surprising
that communists
of smaller
countries
like Gomulka, Rajk and Nagy, and Tito
himself,
should
incline
to this deviation. Communists who were more than simple agents of Mos-
cow—willing
to become
ruling bureaucrats anywhere
in
the world when,
for some higher reason of world revolutionary strategy, the country of their
birth should cease
to
exist—had no other choice. The case
is
different
in
China, which could have afforded the price of totalitarian terror even more
easily than Russia. The
fact, however,
is that Mao has deliberately chosen
the national alternative and formulated a number of theories
in
his famous
speech
in 1957 which
are
in accordance with
it and
in flagrant contradic-
tion to the official Russian ideology. No doubt, the text of "On the Correct
Handling of Contradictions among
the
People"
constitutes
the
first
piece
of serious writing which has come out of the communist orbit since Lenin's
death," and with
it the
ideological
initiative has
shifted from Moscow
to
Peiping. This,
it is true, may harbor momentous consequences for the future;
it may even change
the
totalitarian nature
of the Russian
regime. But
at
this moment all such hopes are, to say the least, premature. By now Zhukov's
demotion should have convinced those who had any doubts
in
this matter,
for one reason for his dismissal
is certainly that he was guilty of "nationalist
deviations,"
that,
in
other
words,
he
started
to
speak
about
the
"Soviet
people" in much the same sense in which Mao tries to reintroduce le peuple,
word and concept, into communist ideology.
Still,
it may be that fear of Chinese competition constituted an important
factor
in
the
liquidation
of
the
police
empire, and
in
this
case
it would
indeed
be more
than
a mere maneuver
or temporary
concession;
but
in
view of the fact that no similar change in ideology has taken place, so that
the ultimate goal of world domination through war and revolution has
re-
mained unchanged,
it
is considerably
less than a
strategic change.
It
is
a
tactical retreat, and there are indications that Khrushchev quite deliberately
has
left the door wide open for the reestablishment of fullfledged terror as
well as the recurrence of super-purges.

the
speech,
one
quickly
realizes
that
the

title
"Let

quite
misleading.
The

theoretical
elements
are
the
recognition
of
contradictions
between
classes,
on
the
one
hand,
and
between
the
people and
the government on
the
other, even
under
a Communist
dictatorship. Of
even
greater importance
is
the
strong
populist
note
in
the
speech. On the matter of
freedom, on the other hand, Mao
is quite orthodox. Freedom to him
is a means to an
end as
is democracy; both "are relative, not absolute, they come into being and develop
under specific
historical circumstances."

48S
TOTALITARIANISM
One of these indications
I have mentioned already.
It
is the law against
"stK'ial
parasites"
(a term only too
familiar
to the
student
of Nazi
totali-
tarianism)
by which
at any moment any number of people can again
dis-
appear
into the concentration camps without having committed any crime
against
the
regime. The
totalitarian
character
of
the
decree
is
illustrated
by the careful omission of criminal acts which remain subject to prosecution
in court, by the
failure to define what constitutes a "social crime," and by
the extra-legal way of
its punishment:
deportation to places which are not
identified. As a matter of fact, the issuance of this law should be enough to
show that
all the talk about a new Soviet legality
is sheer hypocrisy.
Another indication appears
in Khrushchev's secret speech
at the Twen-
tieth Party Congress. The speech was originally
not meant for public con-
sumption;
it addressed
the higher echelons of the Russian
party, and
par-
ticularly those who were involved
in the gamble of "collective leadership."
This audience probably understood immediately
that
the speech could be
interpreted
in two altogether difTerent ways. Either
Stalin's mental
sickness
was the cause of
all crimes, and then nobody was to blame,
neither those
who heard
Mr.
Khrushchev nor Mr.
Khrushchev
himself; moreover, and
even more important,
in this case the mutual fear from which the collective
leadership emerged was unjustified, because only an unbalanced mind would
plot murder. Or, because of his mental condition and insane suspiciousness,
Stalin had been
susceptible
to
evil
influences, and
in
this case not
Stalin
was to blame but whoever used
his diseased power for his own ends. The
first alternative remained the official interpretation until 1957 when Khrush-
chev, with the help of the army, seized power. The second reading became
official policy when Khrushchev justified his coup d'etat by stressing Malen-
kov's
role
in the Leningrad
affair, alluding implicitly to Malenkov's job
as
head
of
Stalin's
personal
secretariat,
which had made him
the
unofficial
head of the NKVD.
It
is common knowledge that the techniques of Khrush-
chev's coiq) d'etat followed closely the pattern
set by Stalin
in the twenties
for the
liquidation of the
triumvirate and
the
right and
left wing factions
in
the
party, and
it therefore seemed only proper that Khrushchev imme-
diately
rehabilitate
his
late master and
curtail
certain
intellectual
liberties.
No one,
least of
all
probably Mr. Khrushchev
himself, can know what
the course of his future actions
will be. One thing
is certain: on the basis
of
his coup
d'etat speech,
he can
not only
liquidate
his
exiled colleagues
from the collective leadership
at any moment, he can also
let loose a new
purge of
Stalin collaborators
in the higher echelons
of the
party, govern-
mental and managerial bureaucracies. The law against social
parasites, on
the other hand, makes possible the reintroduction of mass-deportations and
the re-establishment of slave labor on a large
scale, should
this prove
de-
sirable. As yet, nothing has been decided; but
if one reads certain statements
of
the
Kadar group
in
Hungary, which
mirrors Khrushchev
very
closely
(Kadar's denunciation of Rakosi was modelled after the pattern of Khrush-
chev's earlier denunciation of Stalin), and which held that "the old Stalinist
group had not been severe enough
in crushing
the enemies of socialism,"
that
its mistake was "an
insufficient application of the dictatorship of the

EPILOGUE
489
proletariat,"^ one wonders
if the hopes of some Western observers for the
emergence
of some "enhghtened
totalitarianism"
will
not
turn
out
to be
wishful thinking.
The
last of the post-Stalin changes in the USSR to be mentioned
in our
context concerns the temporary shift of the party's emphasis from the police
to the army.
In recent years, Western observers placed their greatest hope
for a change within the totalitarian system on the sudden ascendancy of the
army and especially on the rise of Marshal Zhukov in the Soviet hierarchy.
These hopes were not entirely unfounded, for
it has thus far been an out-
standing
characteristic
of
totalitarian government
that
the army
played-
a
subordinate
role and could
not compete
with
the
police
cadres
either
in
power or
in
prestige. They
were,
however,
exaggerated
because
another
prominent feature
of
totalitarian government was
left
out
of
account.
It
was forgotten that no other form of government
is so
flexible in
its
institu-
tions, can so easily
shift power from one apparatus
to the other or create
new ones without even having to liquidate the old.
Moreover, ascendancy
of
the
police over the
military
apparatus
is
the
hallmark of
all, and not only of totalitarian tyrannies; in the
latter case,
it
not only answered the need
to suppress the population
at home but
fitted
the ideological claim to global
rule. For
it
is evident that those who regard
the whole earth
as
their future
territory
will
stress
the organ
of domestic
violence and
rule conquered
territory with
police methods and
personnel
rather than with the army. Thus, the Nazis used their SS troops, essentially
a police force, for the rule and even conquest of foreign territories with the
ultimate aim of amalgamation of the army and police under the leadership
of the SS. In view of the flexibility of totalitarianism, we should be prepared
for the possibility of the opposite process, the transformation of the army
and the military into a police organ, or for an amalgamation of military and
police troops under the command of the higher officer corps of the army; as
long as the party remains
the uncontested highest
authority,
this does not
necessarily preclude police methods of rule. This would have been impossible
in Germany because of the strong military traditions of the Relchswehr which
could be broken only from the outside. But this reason,
if
it ever had the
same force in Russia, certainly
is valid only so long as the officer corps
is not
exclusively chosen from
the ranks of the
party and
is not so
reliable and
pliable as the elite cadres of the police.
It
is quite possible that Khrushchev
will replace the political commissars in the army by the same control from
within—exerted by
trusted
officers—and supplement
it with
the same
or-
ganized mob rule—the mob in this instance being the soldiers—by which he
is trying to replace police control
in cultural and economic matters.
If this
should succeed, the decisive difference between army and police would cease
to exist.
When,
in
the course
of
the
succession
crisis, Khrushchev
appealed
to
Zhukov for support, the army's ascendancy over the police was an accom-
plished
fact.
This
had
been
one
of
the
automatic
consequences
of
the

TOTALITARIANISM
breaking up of the police empire, the other being a temporary strengthening
of the managerial group who were
rid of their most serious economic com-
petitor
and,
at
the same
time,
inherited
the
huge
police
share
in
Soviet
industries, mines and
real estate.
It speaks for Khrushchev's shrewdness that
he grasped these consequences more quickly than
his colleagues and acted
accordingly. Of the two beneficiaries of the
partial liquidation of the police
apparatus, the army was by far the stronger for the simple reason
that the
onlv
instrument of violence
left with which
to decide
inner-party
conflicts
was the army. And. indeed, Khrushchev used Zhukov exactly the same way
Stalin had used his relationships to the secret police in the succession strug-
gle of thirty years ago. Yet, just as
in the case of Stalin the supreme power
continued
to
reside
in
the
party,
not
in the
police, so
in
this case
it was
never the army but
again
the
party
apparatus which
retained
the
highest
power. And
just
as
Stalin never
hesitated
to purge
his
police cadres and
liquidate
their chiefs, so Khrushchev has followed up
his
inner-party ma-
neuvers by removing Zhukov from
the
highest command. But even
in the
days of his highest
prestige, Zhukov did not obtain more than minor con-
cessions such
as
a new party directive
affirming the supreme
authority of
military commands
against
interference by
political commissars, and
they
bore an ominous resemblance
to conditions during the war when
military
considerations together with
nationalist propaganda overruled party indoc-
trination for a few years.
This last point
is decisive. There hardly ever was anything to substantiate
hopes
for
a gradual transformation of
totalitarian domination
into
a
mili-
tary dictatorship and, from the viewpoint of peace,
it
is by no means sure
that such
a transformation was
to be
desired. Rule by
the
military,
curi-
ously
enough,
has come
to
be
identified
with
a
determinedly
peaceful
disposition.
But
the observation
that generals
are among the most peace-
loving and
least dangerous creatures
in the world, though quite correct
in
the Western hemisphere of the
last forty years, does
not
necessarily hold
true
for those who by
definition are
aggressors. Zhukov certainly was not
another Eisenhower, and throughout the period of rising army prestige, there
have been signs that Russia prepared herself for war. This has
little
to do
with the launching of satellites and the development of an intercontinental
rocket,
although
these
successes gave
the
policy
its
material
basis. What
we should
not
forget
is
that Malenkov's
statement
in
1954:
that
a
third
world war under
the
conditions
of nuclear warfare would
spell doom
to
mankind as a whole was immediately followed by
his
defeat. The
trouble
was that he probably meant what he
said,
for his program of non-military
industrial development and greater production
of consumer goods was
in
line with this statement—together they most
likely cost him the support of
the army and helped Khrushchev in the inner-party struggle. One year later,
at any
rate, Molotov expressed
the
opposite conviction:
that nuclear war
would be disastrous only for the
imperialist and
capitalist powers, whereas
the communist bloc would
profit by
it no
less than
it had
profited by the
two previous wars. Khrushchev uttered the same opinion in 1956 and con-
firmed
it officially in 1957 prior to Zhukov's fall: "A new worid war could

EPILOGUE
491
only end in collapse for capitalism
.
.
. Socialism will live on while capitalism
will
not
remain. For
despite
great
losses mankind
will
not
only
survive,
but will continue to develop." So emphatic was
this statement in an inter-
view for foreign consumption about peaceful coexistence,
that he
felt him-
self that "some may think Communists are interested in war, since
it would
lead to the victory of socialism.'"* This, to be sure, never meant that Russia
actually was on the point of starting a war. Totalitarian leaders can change
their minds
like everyone
else, and
it
stands
to
reason
that
the Russian
rulers
are wavering
not only between
the
hope
for
victory
and
the
fear
of defeat, but between the hope
that victory may make them the uncon-
tested masters over the globe and fear lest, exhausted by a too costly victory,
they be
left alone to face the growing power colossus of China. The
latter
considerations, which of course
are
hypothetical,
are
along national
lines;
if they
prevail, Russia may indeed be interested
in coming to
a temporary
arrangement with the United
States
to
freeze
the
present
constellation
in
which the two super-powers are bound to recognize and respect the existing
spheres of influence.
The demotion of Zhukov may be the most dramatic manifestation of this
change of mind. From the
little we know
at
this moment,
it seems
likely
that Zhukov, accused of "adventurism," the inner-party equivalent for war-
mongering, wanted war and that Khrushchev,
after a moment's
hesitation,
decided to follow once more the "wisdom" of his dead master whose ruth-
lessness in domestic policies always was matched by an extreme caution in
foreign
affairs.
It could
also be
that Khrushchev accused Zhukov
of war
preparations because he himself was toying with the idea—as Stalin accused
Tukhachevski of plotting with Nazi Germany when he himself prepared an
alliance with
Hitler. At any
event,
it was only proper
that Zhukov's
dis-
missal should have been followed by the strongest affirmation of peaceful-
ness that has come out of Soviet Russia since the end of the war, a toast
hailing the wartime alliance against Hitler accompanied by a veritable curse
on
the warmongers—who
in
Khrushchev's mind
just
then were
not
the
"capitalist and imperialist powers" but rather his generals
at home. Unfor-
tunately, and much as we are tempted to put our faith in a sincere change
of Mr.
Khrushchev's
heart,
it
is
only
too
likely
that
his words were
for
public consumption
in Russia and the
satellite
countries, where Zhukov's
popularity perhaps made a denunciation of him as a warmonger necessary.
Neither
they
nor
subsequent
proposals
to end
experiments
with
nuclear
weapons are reliable indications of a change in the party's inner evaluation
of war under the conditions of nuclear weapons.
It
is in the terrible nature of totalitarian government that a more reliable
indication of Russia's
present unwillingness
to
risk another world war
lies
in
the
fact
that conditions have turned
for
the worse again
in the whole
orbit of Soviet domination, where for a number of years the Russian people
as well as the people
in the
satellite countries had enjoyed a comparatively
easier and more plentiful
life.

Poland and Russia
herself, which was
in no way provoked by popular un-
rest
or
rebellion
but
has
been accompanied by
a
less
aggressive
attitude
toward
the Western world, may simply
signify
that
here,
too, Khrushchev
will show himself a
faithful
disciple of
his dead master.
Ihat
we
must
gauge
our own
security
by
the
tragedy
of
others
is
bad
enough,
but
it
is
not
the
worst. The
worst
is
that under
these
cir-
cumstances
the most
important
political
issue
of the nuclear
age,
the war
question, cannot
be
raised,
let
alone
solved. As
far
as
the
nontotalitarian
world
is concerned,
it
is a matter of fact that another world war will harbor a
threat of destruction
to the existence of mankind, even to the existence of
organic
life on earth. This, obviously, makes
all past political thought about
war,
its possible
justification
for the sake of freedom,
its
role
as an ultima
ratio
in foreism
affairs,
perfectly obsolete. But what
is
a matter of fact for
us.
is a matter of ideology for the totalitarian mind. The point
is not
in
dif-
ferences of opinion and basic convictions nor the concomitant
difficulties in
coming to an agreement,
but
in
the much more
terrifying impossibility
of
agreeing about
facts.'' Mr.
Khrushchev's
oflf-the-record contribution
to
the
war discussion, "poor men do not mind
fire,"
is truly appalling, not merely
because such popular
verities of yesterday have become dangerous
irrele-
vancies today, but because
it shows with rare precision that, no matter how
vulgar
his expressions may
be,
he
actually
thinks and operates within the
closed framework of his ideology and will not permit new facts to penetrate
it.
It has always been an error to measure
the
threat of totalitarianism by
the yardstick
of the
relatively harmless
conflict between
a communist and
a capitalist society and to overlook the explosive contradiction between the
totalitarian fiction and the everyday world of factuality in which we live. But
it was never more dangerously wrong than today when the same technical
discoveries, which taken together constitute for us a factually changed world,
are at the disposition of those who in dead seriousness regard them as mere
means, that
is, as devices with which to make
real a purely fictitious world
built of lies and based on denials of facts. The freedom of mankind,
let alone
its survival, does not depend upon
a free market economy; yet freedom
as
well
as
survival may
well deprnd upon our success or
failure
to persuade
the other part of the world
to recognize
facts
as they are and
to come
to
terms with the factuality of the world as
it
is.

Krushchev's speech at the Twentieth Party Congress could at the same time
end the thaw in Russia ^" and release the unrest,
finally the uprising,
in the
newly
bolshevized
territories.
Here,
the
sinister
ambiguity we
mentioned
above obviously was
lost on the
average reader who must have read
the
speech with pretty much the same understanding as the average reader in the
free world. In this naive reading
it could not but cause a tremendous
relief,
because
it sounded as though a normal human being were talking about nor-
mal human occurrences—insanity and crimes creeping into politics; Marxian
phraseology and historical necessity were conspicuous by their absence. Had
this been the
"correct understanding"
of the
speech,
the Twentieth
Party
Congress would have been an event of enormous significance.
It would have
indicated a break with totalitarian methods, though not with socialist meas-
ures or dictatorial procedures, and healed the breach between the two world
powers. For Khrushchev had only confirmed the charge of the
free world
that this was not so much a communist as a crime-ridden government which
lacked not only the democratic type of legality but any restriction of power
through law whatsoever.
If the Soviet government now intended to operate
a socialist economy on the same level as the western world operated a free-
market economy, then there was no reason why the two main powers,
to-
gether with their respective
allies, should not be able to coexist and coop-
erate peacefully and in good faith.
Several months elapsed before the
secret party speech reached
first the
Western world through the New York Times and then the communist-ruled
countries.
Its immediate consequence was something unheard of—open
re-
bellions
in Poland and Hungary which had not happened through
all
the
preceding years when
Stalin was
silently and most
efficiently downgraded,
when a number of Stalinists like Rakosi in Hungary had been removed from
power and
a relaxation of controls had taken
place, nor had
it happened
when these controls,
alrervdy prior to the publication of the
secret speech,
were gradually
retightened and some
Stalinists
rehabilitated. The
point
is
that
the people were aroused only by open words, and
not by
silent ma-
neuvers, no matter how telling they might have been for the observer of the
totalitarian
scene, and no amount
of bad
faith behind
these words—and
this bad
faith was by no means
inactive—could
alter
their inflammatory
power. Not acts, "mere words" had succeeded much against their intention
in breaking the deadly
spell
of impotent apathy which
totalitarian
terror
and ideology cast over the minds of men.
However,
this did not happen everywhere.
It happened only where some
old-guard communists,
like Nagy and Gomulka, had miraculously survived
the meticulous
care
with which
Stalin had purged
not
only
the
Russian
party but the
international movement of everybody who was
not
a mere
agent. In the beginning, the Polish and Hungarian developments were quite
tween Silone and Anissimov,
loc.
tit., read
like object lessons
in
this peculiarity of the
totalitarian mentality with
its horrifying capacity
to avoid
all
real
issues and dissolve
all facts in ideological talk.

similar.
In
both
countries,
an
inner-party
split had occurred between
the
"Muscovites"
and
these
survivors,
and
the
general
mood,
including
the
stress on
national
tradition,
religious
freedom,
and
violent
dissatisfaction
among students, was
similar. One
is tempted
to say
that
it was almost an
accident that what happened in Hungary did not happen in Poland and vice
versa.
I he fact, however,
is that Gomulka, setting before the Polish people's
eyes the tragic fate of Hungary, could stop the rebellion
in
its
initial
stage,
so that neither the exhilarating experience of power which comes from act-
ing together nor the consequences resulting from boldly putting freedom on
the market place could come
to
pass.
The
third
fact
to
remember
is
that
the
rebellion
in
both
countries
started
with
intellectuals
and
university
students,
and
generally
with
the
younger generation,
that
is, with those
strata of the population whose ma-
terial well-being and
ideological indoctrination had been one of the prime
concerns of the regime. Not the underprivileged, but the overprivileged of
communist
society
took
the
initiative, and
their motive was
neither
their
own nor their fellow-citizens' material misery, but exclusively Freedom and
Truth."
This, especially, must have been
as rude
a lesson for Moscow
as
it was heartwarming for the free world. Not only that bribes did not work,
but
the
rise of
totalitarian
ideologies and movements
has thus
far always
attracted
the
intelligentsia, and experience has shown
that nobody can be
so
easily
bribed and
frightened
into
submission
to nonsense
as
scholars,
writers and artists. The voice from Eastern Europe, speaking so plainly and
simply
of freedom
and
truth,
sounded
like
an
ultimate
affirmation
that
human nature
is unchangeable, that nihilism
will be
futile, that even
in the
absence of
all teaching and the presence of overwhelming indoctrination
a
yearning for freedom and truth will
rise out of man's heart and mind forever.
Unfortunately,
such conclusions need
qualification.
First,
the
rebellions
happened
in
countries whose
experience
with
total
domination had been
quite
short-lived. Not before 1949 were the
satellite countries even super-
ficially bolshevized, and the process was inlerrupted in 1953 by Stalin's death
and the subsequent period of thaw. The succeeding struggle resulted
in the
formation of factions, and discussion became
inevitable. The cry
for free-
dom was born
in the atmosphere of these inner-party discussions, but only
in
the
recently conquered
territories;
for
nothing comparable
with
these
words and deeds could be witnessed
in Russia proper.
Ilya Ehrenburg, an
old bohemian and
habitue of left-bank
Paris
bistros, may have nourished
certain hopes when he coined the
right metaphor 'Thaw' for the new party
line, but he
is of course much more typical of those whom "the gods have
failed" than of the Russian
intelligentsia.
Dudintsev's novel Not by Bread
Alone, unlike Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago, probably a product of the encour-
aged self-criticism mentioned above,
is not concerned with freedom, but with
the opening of careers
to
talent. And
scarce evidence
of some
authentic
"The
truly admirable United
Nations' Report on
the Problem of Hungary quotes
a young
girl student
as follows: "Even though we might
lack bread and other neces-
sities of
life, we wanted freedom. We,
the young
people, were
particularly hampered
because we were brought up amidst
lies. We continually had to
lie. We could not have
a healthy idea, because everything was choked
in
us. We wanted freedom of thought."

EPILOGUE
495
rebelliousness among Russian
intellectuals points much
rather
to
a yearn-
ing for the
right to know factual truth than
for any
right of freedom. One
such instance occurs also
in Dudintsev's novel, where he recounts the early
days of the Nazi invasion when he was watching from a trench a fight be-
tween German and Russian
airplanes
in which
the Messerschmitts proved
victorious
although
they
were outnumbered:
"Something snapped
in me
because
I had always been
told
that our planes were
the
fastest and
the
best." Here, indeed, the author
tells of one long moment during which to-
talitarian
disputing-away
of
facts
did
not
prevail;
experience
of
factual
truth exploded the
"historical truth"
of the
party's argument, whose "our
planes
are
the
fastest and
the
best" means:
eventually we
shall
have
the
fastest and the best planes, perhaps
at the cost of destroying
all those who
could compete with us.
Whatever our convictions and hopes concerning human nature may
be,
all our experiences with
these regimes
indicate
that, once
they
are
firmly
established, factual reality
is a much greater danger to them than an innate
yearning for freedom. We know
this from
the
Stalinist measure
to deport
the returning soldiers of the Russian occupation army en masse to concen-
tration camps because they had been exposed
to the impact of
reality;
as
we know
it from the curiously complete breakdown of Nazi indoctrination
after
Hitler's
defeat and
the automatic
destruction
of
his
fictitious
world.
The point
is that the impact of factual reality, like
all other human experi-
ences, needs speech
if
it
is to survive the moment of experience, needs talk
and communication with others
to remain sure of
itself.
Total domination
succeeds to the extent that
it succeeds in interrupting
all channels of com-
munication, those from person to person inside the four walls of privacy no
less than the public ones which are safeguarded in democracies by freedom
of speech and opinion. Whether this process of making every person incom-
municado succeeds except in the extreme situations of solitary confinement
and of torture
is hard to say; in any event,
it takes time, and
it
is obvious
that
it
is far from completed
in the
satellite countries. So long as terror
is
not supplemented by the
ideological compulsion from within, so hideously
manifest in the self-denunciations of the show
trials,^- the
ability of people
to distinguish between truth and lies on the elementary factual level remains
unimpaired; oppression, therefore,
is
felt for what
it
is and freedom
is de-
manded.
'-The collapse of the regime
in Hungary has yielded one more beautiful example of
motivation and technique of these self-denunciations by making public the preparation
of
Rajk.
for
his show
trial. Kadar was
in charge and
his conversation with Rajk was
secretly recorded by Rakosi—presumably for future use against Kadar—and the record
played back
at
the Central Committee's meeting which ousted
Rakosi. The comrades
heard the following: "Dear Laci,
1 come to you on behalf of Comrade Rakosi. He
re-
quested me
to come and
explain
the
situation
to
you. Of
course, we
all know
that
you are innocent.
But Comrade Rakosi
believes
that you
will
understand. Only
really
great comrades are chosen for such
roles. He asked me to
tell you
that by doing
this
you
will render
historic service
to
the Communist movement." (Quoted from

TOTALITARIANISM
The Hiingan.in people, young and old, knew that they were "living amidst
lies" and asked, unanimously and
in
all manifestos, for something the Rus-
sian
intcllieentsia apparently has even forgotten how
to dream
of, namely,
for freedom of thought,
it would probably be erroneous
to conclude from
this unanimity
that
the same concern
for freedom
of thought which gave
rise to the rebellion among the
intellectuals also turned the rebellion into a
revolution of the whole people, an uprising which spread
like wildfire
until
no one was
left outside
its ranks except the members of the
political police
—the only Hungarians prepared to defend the regime. A similar error would
be
to conclude from
the
initiative
taken
by members
of
the Communist
Party
that
the
revolution was
primarily an
inner-party
affair,
a
revolt
of
"true"
against
"false" communists. The
facts speak an altogether different
language. What are the facts?
An unarmed and
essentially harmless student demonstration grew from
a few thousand suddenly and spontaneously
into a huge crowd which took
it upon
itself to carry out one of the students' demands, the overturning of
Stalin's statue
in one of the public squares
in Budapest. The following day,
some students went to the Radio Building to persuade the station to broad-
cast the sixteen points of their manifesto. A large crowd immediately gath-
ered, as
if from nowhere, and when the AVH, the political police guarding
the
building,
tried
to disperse
the crowd with
a few
shots,
the
revolution
broke out. The masses attacked the police and acquired their first weapons.
The workers, hearing of the situation, left the factories and joined the crowd.
The army,
called
to defend
the regime and
help
the armed
police,
sided
with the
revolution and armed the people. What had
started
as
a student
demonstration had become an armed uprising in less than twenty-four hours.
From
this moment onward,
no
programs,
points
or
manifestos
played
any
role; what carried
the
revolution was the sheer momentum of
acting-
together of
the whole
people whose demands were
so
obvious
that
they
hardly needed elaborate formulation: Russian troops should leave the terri-
tory and
free elections should determine
a new government. The question
was no longer how much freedom to permit to action, speech and thought,
but how to
institutionalize
a freedom which was already an accomplished
fact. For
if we
leave
aside
the
outside
interventions
of Russian
troops
first of those stationed
in the country and then of regular battalions com-
ing from Russia
in
full
battle preparation—we may well say
that never a
revolution
achieved
its
aims
so
quickly,
so
completely
and
with
so few
losses. The amazing thing about the Hungarian revolution
is that there was
was no
civil war. For the Hungarian army
disintegrated
in hours and the
dictatorship was stripped of
all power
in a couple of days. No group, no
class in the nation opposed the will of the people once
it had become known
and
its voice had been heard
in the market place. For the members of the
AVH, who remained loyal to the end, formed neither group nor
class, the
lower echelons having been
recruited from
the
dregs
of
the
population:
criminals,
Nazi
agents,
highly
compromised
members
of
the
Hungarian
fascist
party,
the
higher
ranks being composed
of Moscow
agents, Hun-
garians with Russian citizenship under the orders of NKVD officers.

EPILOGUE
497
The swift disintegration of
tlie whole power structure—party, army and
governmental offices—and the absence of internal strife in the developments
that followed are
all the more remarkable when we consider that the up-
rising was clearly started by communists, who, however, did not retain the
initiative, and
still never became
the
object
of wrath and vengeance
for
non-communists nor turned themselves against the people. The striking ab-
sence
of
ideological
dispute,
the concomitant
lack
of
fanaticism
and
the
ensuing atmosphere of fraternity, which came into being with the
first dem-
onstration in the streets and lasted until the bitter end, can be explained only
on
the assumption
that
ideological
indoctrination had
disintegrated
even
more swiftly than the political structure.
It was as though ideology, of what-
ever shade and brand, had simply been wiped out of existence and memory
the moment
the
people,
intellectuals and
workers, communists and non-
communists, found themselves together in the streets fighting for freedom.^^
In this respect, the change in reality brought about by the revolution had
much the same effect on the minds of the Hungarian people as the sudden
breakdown of the Nazi world had on the minds of the German people.
Important as these aspects are, they
tell us more about the nature of the
regime
the Hungarian
revolution
rebelled
against than
about
the
revolu-
tion itself. In
its positive significance, the outstanding feature of the uprising
was that no chaos
resulted from
the
actions of people without leadership
and without previously formulated program.
First, there was no looting, no
trespassing of property, among a multitude whose standard of life had been
miserable
and whose
hunger
for
merchandise
notorious.
There
were no
crimes against
life either, for the few instances of public hanging of AVH
officers were conducted
with remarkable
restraint and
discrimination.
In-
stead
of
the mob
rule
which
might
have been
expected,
there
appeared
immediately,
almost
simultaneously
with
the
uprising
itself,
the
Revolu-
tionary and Workers'
Councils,
that
is,
the same
organization which
for
more than a hundred years now
has emerged whenever the people
have
been permitted for a few days, or a few weeks or months, to follow their
own political devices without a government (or a party program) imposed
from above.
For these councils made
their
first appearance
in
the
revolution which
swept Europe in 1848; they reappeared in the revolt of the Paris Commune
in 1871, existed for a few weeks during the first Russian revolution of 1905,
to reappear in
full force
in the October revolution in Russia and the No-
vember
revolutions
in Germany and
Austria
after
the
first World War.
Until now, they have always been defeated, but by no means only by the
"counter-revolution." The
Bolshevik
regime
destroyed
their power
even
under Lenin and attested to their popularity by stealing their name
{soviet
being the Russian word for council). In Russia, the Supreme Soviet is needed
'^ This aspect
is especially
striicing when we

to conceal the fact that the true seat of power
is in the party apparatus and
to present
to the outside world the facade of a non-existent parliament.
In
addition,
it serves as a kind of honor system; membership, acquired through
nomination by
the
party,
is bestowed
for outstanding achievement
in
all
professions and walks of
life. Members of the Russian
Soviets
neither
rule
nor govern;
they do not
legislate and have no
political
rights whatsoever,
not even the privilege to execute party orders. They are not supposed to act
at
all;
they
are chosen
in
recognition
of
non-political
achievements—for
their contribution to the "building of socialism." When Soviet-Russian tanks
crushed
the
revolution
in Hungary,
they
actually destroyed
the
only
free
and acting Soviets
in existence anywhere
in the world." And
in Germany,
again,
it was not the
"reliction," but the Social Democrats who liquidated
the Soldiers' and Workers' Councils
in
1919.
In
the
case
of
the Hungarian
revolution, even more markedly than
in
the case of earlier ones, the establishment of the Councils represented "the
first practical step to restore order and lo reorganize the Hungarian economy
on a
socialist
basis,
but
without
rigid
Party
control
or
the
apparatus
of
terror."'"' The councils thus were charged with two tasks, one
political, the
other economic, and though
it would be wrong to believe that the dividing
line between them was unblurred, we may assume that the Revolutionary
Councils
fulfilled
mainly
political
functions
while
the
Workers'
Councils
were supposed to handle economic
life. In the following, we shall deal only
with
the
Revolutionary Councils and
the
political
aspect;
their immediate
task was to prevent chaos and the spreading of crime, and in this they were
quite
successful.
The
question
whether economic,
as
distinguished
from
political, functions can be handled by councils, whether,
in other words,
it
is possible
to
run
factories under
the management and ownership
of
the
workers, we shall have to leave open. (As a matter of fact,
it is quite doubt-
ful whether the
political principle of equality and
self-rule can be applied
to the economic sphere of life as well. It may be that ancient political theory,
which held
that economics,
since
it was bound up with
the
necessities
of
life, needed the rule of masters to function well, was not so wrong after
all.
For
it
is somehow,
albeit paradoxically, supported by
the
fact that when-
ever the modern age has believed that history
is primarily the result of eco-
nomic forces,
it has come
to the conviction that man
is not free and that
history
is subject to necessity.)
At any event, the Revolutionary and the Workers' Councils, though they
emerged together, are better kept apart, because the former were primarily
the answer to political tyranny, whereas the
latter in the case of the Hun-
garian revolution were the reaction against trade unions that did not repre-
sent the workers but the party's control over them. Not only the Workers'
Councils, the program of the Revolutionary Councils too must be understood
in the context of special conditions of the Hungarian
revolution. Thus the
demand for free general
elections belongs
to
the program inherent

emergence of councils everywhere, whereas the demand to restore the multi-
party system,
as
it had ruled Hungary and
all European countries prior to
the
rise of tyranny, was the almost automatic reaction to the particularities
of the situation, the shameful suppression and persecution of all parties which
had preceded
the one-party
dictatorship.
In order to understand the council system,
it
is well to remember that
it
is as old as the party system
itself; as such,
it represents the only alternative
to
it,
that
is,
the only
alternative of democratic electoral representation
to
the one presented by the Continental multi-party system with
its insistence
on class interests on the one hand and ideology, or Weltanschauung, on the
other. But while the historical origin of the party system
lies in Parliament
with
its factions, the councils were born exclusively out of the actions and
spontaneous demands of the
people, and they were not deduced from an
ideology nor foreseen,
let alone preconceived, by any theory about the best
form of government. Wherever they appeared, they were met with utmost
hostility from
the
party-bureaucracies and
their leaders from
right
to
left
and with the unanimous
neglect
of
political
theorists and
political
scien-
tists. The point
is that the councils have always been undoubtedly demo-
cratic, but in a sense never seen before and never thought about. And since
nobody, neither statesman nor political
scientists nor parties, has ever paid
any serious attention to
this new and wholly untried form of organization,
its stubborn re-emergence for more than a century could not be more spon-
taneous and
less influenced by outside interest or theory.
Under modern conditions,
the councils
are
the only democratic
alterna-
tive we know
to
the
party
system, and
the
principles on which they
are
based stand in sharp opposition to the principles of the party system in many
respects. Thus, the men elected for the councils are chosen at the bottom,
and not
selected by
the
party machinery and proposed
to
the
electorate
either as individuals with alternate choices or as a slate of candidates. The
choice, moreover, of the voter
is not prompted by a program or a platform
or an ideology, but exclusively by
his estimation of
a man,
in whose per-
sonal integrity, courage and judgment he
is supposed to have enough confi-
dence to entrust him with his representation. The elected, therefore,
is not
bound by anyhing except trust in his personal qualities, and his pride
is "to
have been elected by the workers, and not by the government" ^^ or a party,
that
is, by his peers and from neither above nor below.
Once such
a body of trusted men
is elected,
it
will of course again de-
velop differences of opinion which
in turn may lead
into the formation of
"parties." But
these groups
of men
holding
the same opinion
within
the
councils would not be parties,
strictly speaking; they would constitute those
factions from which
the
parliamentary
parties
originally
developed.
The
election of
a candidate would not depend upon
his adherence
to
a
given
faction, but
still on his personal power of persuasion with which he could

present
his
point of view.
In other words,
the councils would
control
the
parties, they would not be
their representatives. The strength of any given
faction would not depend upon
its bureaucratic apparatus and not even upon
the appeal of
its program or Weltanschauung, but on the number of trusted
and trustworthy men
it holds
in
its ranks. This development manifested
it-
self
clearly
in
the
initial
stages
of
the
Russian
revolution,
and
the
chief
reason why Lenin
felt he had
to emasculate the Soviets was that the Social
Revolutionaries counted more men trusted by the people than the Bolsheviks;
the power of the Communist Party, which had been responsible for the revo-
lution, was endangered by the council system which had grown out of the
revolution.
Remarkable,
finally,
is the great inherent
flexibility of the system, which
seems to need no special conditions for
its establishment except the coming
together and
acting
together
of
a
certain number
of
people on
a
non-
temporary
basis.
In Hungary, we have seen the simultaneous setting-up of
all
kinds of councils, each
of them corresponding
to
a previously existing
group in which people habitually lived together or met regularly and knew
each other. Thus neighborhood councils emerged from sheer living together
and grew
into county and other
territorial councils; revolutionary councils
grew out of fighting together; councils of writers and
artists, one
is tempted
to think, were born
in the cajes, students' and youths' councils
at the uni-
versity, military councils
in the army, councils of
civil servants
in the min-
istries,
workers'
councils
in
the
factories, and so
on. The formation
of
a
council
in each
disparate group
turned
a
merely haphazard
togetherness
into a political
institution.
The men elected were communists and non-communists; party lines seem
to have played no
role whatsoever, the
criterion,
in the words of a news-
paper, being solely that there
is "none among them who would misuse
his
power or think only of his personal position." And this
is more a criterion
of qualification than of morality. Whoever misuses power or perverts
it into
violence, or
is only interested in his private
affairs and without concern for
the common world,
is simply not
fit to play a role in political
life. The same
principles were observed
in the further stages of election; for the councils,
elected
directly
at
the
base,
were
urged
to
elect
representatives
for
the
higher bodies "without regard
for Party
affiliation and with due regard to
the confidence of the working people." ^^
One of the most striking aspects of the Hungarian revolution
is that this
principle of the council system not only reemerged, but that in twelve short
days
a good
deal
of
its range of
potentialities could emerge
with
it. The
council-men were
hardly
elected
in
direct
vote when
these new
councils
began freely to coordinate among themselves to choose from their own midst
the representatives for the higher councils up to the Supreme National Coun-
cil, the counterpart of normal government,—and the initiative for this came
from the just revived Nationa' Peasant Party, certainly the
last group to be
suspected of extreme ideas. While
this Supreme Council remained
in prep-
aration, the necessary preliminary steps had been taken everywhere: work-

councils had
set up
coordinating committees
and
Central
Workers'
Councils were already functioning in many areas; revolutionary councils in
the provinces were coordinated and planning to
set up a National Revolu-
tionary Committee with which to replace the National Assembly. Here,
as
in
all
other
instances, when
for
the
shortest
historical moment
the
voice
of the people has been heard, unaltered by the shouts of the mob and un-
stifled by the bureaucracies of the parties, we can do no more than draw a
very sketchy picture of the potentialities and physiognomy of the only demo-
cratic system which in Europe, where the party system was discredited
al-
most
as soon
as
it was born, was ever
really
popular. (We
discussed
in
Chapter VIII,
Section
3,
the
decisive
difference between
the
Continental
multi-party system and
the Anglo-American two-party
system which one
must always keep
in mind for a proper understanding of European events
and revolutions.) The
rise of the
councils, not
the
restoration
of
parties,
was the clear sign of a true upsurge of democracy
against dictatorship, of
freedom against tyranny.
When we ponder the lesson of the Hungarian revolution,
it may be well
to consider how the restored regime proceeded in crushing the uprising. The
Russian army in a full-fledged invasion needed three whole weeks to pacify
the country—which indeed speaks well for the solidity of the organizational
power of the councils. The people's demands for freedom and truth were,
of course, denied, but in one respect the government did make a concession.
The peasants, who in Hungary as in Poland had spontaneously
left the col-
lectives, were not forced back, with the result that the whole experiment of
collective farming practically collapsed
in both countries and
the
agricul-
tural output of these regions fell far below the requirements for the national
economy. The concession to the peasants,
therefore, the only
class which
at least up to now has derived certain profits from the
rebellions, was im-
portant materially as well as ideologically. The
first blow of bloody oppres-
sion was directed
against the Revolutionary Councils, the organ of
action
and representative for the people
as
a whole.
After
the nation had been
once more reduced to impotence, freedom of thought was adamantly and
without the slightest concession stamped out. Only then followed the disso-
lution of the Workers' Councils, which the regime regarded as a substitute for
party and govenmient-directed trade unions rather than as a political body.
It certainly
is noteworthy that the same order in the restoration of
total
domination has been followed in Poland where the Russian rulers did not
have to crush
a revolution but had only to withdraw certain concessions,
won in the upheaval of 1956. Here too the new workers' councils, that
is,
trade unions independent of party control, were the last to go; they had been
able to survive for eighteen months, until April 1958, and their liquidation
followed upon and was accompanied by ever more
severe
restrictions on
intellectual liberties. If we translate into theory the order of these measures,
we see
that
first
priority
is given
to freedom of
action, embodied
in
the
Revolutionary Councils in Hungary; they were crushed
first and their mem-
bers were the
first to be persecuted. But freedom of thought was
felt to be

502
TOTALITARIANISM
almost equally dangerous, and the persecution of intellectuals followed im-
mediately upon the liquidation of the councils. Interest representation, which
the workers had established
in their own trade unions, apparently contained
too great an element of action to be tolerated;
still,
it was suppressed more
slowly and
less
violently than
the other two.
Finally, and most
interesting,
all Marxist talk about the absolute priority of the economic system notwith-
standing,
the only sphere where temporary concessions were deemed
pos-
sible and wise was precisely the economic, where nothing more was at stake
than
the organization of labor and
the mode
of consumption and
appro-
priation of consumer goods.
Clearly,
these measures were not dictated by
materialist ideology. They
were guided by the very
realistic understanding that freedom resides
in the
human
capacities
of action and
thought, and
not
in labor and earning
a
living. Since labor and earning a
living,
like
all
strictly economic
activities,
are
subject
to
necessity anyhow, bound
to
the
necessities
of
life,
it was
not thought likely that demands for more liberties in this sphere would ever
lead by themselves to the claim of freedom. Whatever the
free world may
think of the issue at stake
in
its conflict with totalitarianism, the totalitarian
dictators themselves have shown
in practice that they know very well that
the difference
in economic systems,
far from constituting the hard core of
final disagreement,
is even the only one where concessions are possible.

The
Satellite System
THE LAST WORDS to comc out of free Hungary were spoken over the Radio
Station Kossuth and ended with the following sentence: "Today
it
is Hun-
gary and tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow,
it will be the turn of other
countries because the imperialism of Moscow does not know borders, and
is only
trying
to play for time." A few days
earlier,
the Communist Free
Radio (Rajk) had already declared that
"it was not only
Stalin who used
Communism
as
a pretext
to expand Russian imperialism" and that
it had
been among the goals of the Hungarian revolution "to present a clear pic-
ture of Russia's brutal colonial rule."
We said in the beginning that the development and expansion of post-war
Soviet
totalitarianism must be seen
in
the flaming
light of the Hungarian
revolution.
This
light—who would deny
it?— is
not
steady,
it
flares and
flickers; yet
it
is the only authentic light we have. The words spoken during
the event by men
acting
in freedom and
fighting
for
it carry more weight
and, so we hope, are heard by more people than theoretical reflections, pre-
cisely because
they
are spoken on
the spur and
in
the excitement
of the
moment.'**

perialism,
political science must accept
the term, although we might have
preferred, for conceptual
as well
as historical reasons, to reserve the word
"imperialism" for the colonial expansion of Europe which began in the
last
third of the nineteenth century and ended with the liquidation of British rule
over India. Our task then can only be to analyze what kind of imperialism
developed out of the totalitarian form of government.
As we saw
before,
imperialism, both word and phenomenon, was
un-
known until the ever-quickening pace of industrial production forced open
the
territorial limitations
of the
nation-state.'"
Its outstanding feature was
expressed in the slogan of the time: expansion for expansion's sake, which
meant expansion without regard to what traditionally had been regarded as
national
interests such
as
the defense
of the
territory and
its
limited
ag-
grandizement through annexation
of neighboring lands.
Imperialist expan-
sion was prompted not by
political, but economic motives, and
it followed
the expanding economy wherever
it happened to lead in the form of invest-
ment
of
capital,
surplus money
within
the
national economy, and
of
the
emigration of unemployable
people, who had
also become
superfluous
to
the
life of the nation. Imperialism thus was the
result of the
nation-state's
attempt to survive under the circumstances of
a new economy and
in the
presence of an emerging world market.
Its dilemma was that economic inter-
ests of the nationals demanded an expansion which could not be
justified
on the grounds of traditional
nationalism with
its
insistence on
historical
identity of people, state and territory.
From beginning to end and for better and worse, the destinies of imperi-
alism, the fate that befell the ruling nations no less than the
lot suffered by
their "subject races," were determined by this origin. National consciousness
was perverted into race consciousness, prompted by
the
natural
solidarity
of "white men" in alien lands, which, in turn, made the subject races color
conscious. But together with racism, nationalism made
its inroads
into the
ancient
cultures
of Asia and
the
tribal
wilderness
of
Africa,
and
if
the
imperialist-minded colonial bureaucracy could turn a deaf ear to the national
aspirations which they themselves had aroused, the
nation-state could not
without denying
the
very
principle
of
its own
existence. The
colonial bu-
reaucracies lived
in a perennial
conflict with their home governments, and
while
imperialism
undermined
nationalism
by
shifting
the
loyalties
from
the nation to the race, the nation-state with
its
still intact legal and political
institutions always
prevailed
in preventing the worst excesses. The fear of
boomerang effects of imperialism upon the mother country remained strong
enough to make the national parliaments a bulwark of justice
for the op-
pressed people and against the colonial administration.
Imperialism on the whole was a failure because of the dichotomy between
the nation-state's legal principles and the methods needed to oppress other
life,
it
is easier to act than to think under conditions of terror. And the
spell
cast by
terror over man's mind can be broken only by freedom, not by mere thought.

of
the
historical background

people pcriivmently. This failure was neither necessary nor due to ignorance
or incompetence.
British
impcriaUsts knew
very
well
that
"administrative
massacres" could
keep
India
in bondage, but they
also knew
that
public
opinion
at home would
not
stand
for such
measures.
Imperialism
could
have been a success
if the nation-state had been willing to pay the price, to
commit suicide and transform
itself into a tyranny.
It
is one of the glories
of Europe, and especially of Great
Britain,
that she preferred to liquidate
the empire.
Such recollections of the past may serve to remind us of how much greater
the chances of success arc for an imperialism directed by a totalitarian gov-
ernment. Moreover, Russia was never a nation-state,
strictly speaking; even
the Czars ruled
a multi-national empire from the power center
in Moscow.
The
principle
of
national
self-determination,
this
nightmare
of
the
old
imperialists who had
to deny
to
the
subject
people
the
very
principle
of
their own political existence, poses not even a problem to the Moscow rulers
today. They
rule
the
satellites
with
essentially
the same
device
they
use
for their empire at home; they make concessions to national culture on the
folklore and linguistic level, imposing at the same time not only the Moscow-
conceived and directed policy, but also Russian as the
oflficial language for
all nationalities.
Introduction of obligatory study of Russian was one of the
first demands by Moscow
in the process of bolshevization,
as the demand
for its abolition figured prominently in all manifestos in Hungary and Poland.
No dichotomy
of
principle,
therefore, between home
rule and
colonial
rule
will impose
restraint on totalitarian imperialism, and
if
it,
too, has
to
fear
certain boomerang
effects from
its
imperialist
adventures,
they
have
other causes. Thus,
the
fact that the Russian army had
to be called
in to
crush the Hungarian uprising may have been one of the reasons why Zhukov
could
nourish
certain hopes of winning an
ascendancy
over
the
party
at
home
and,
at
any
rate,
for consolidating
his newly-won ascendancy over
the
police. For the Hungarian events seemed
to prove
that
police troops,
though modelled after the Russian NKVD, were not
sufficient to deal with
a full-fledged
rebellion. Of even greater importance, the swift disintegration
of the Hungarian army, which alone had enabled an annoying but harmless
show of dissatisfaction to grow into an armed uprising, demonstrated to what
an extent the regime everywhere depended upon the
loyalty of
its
soldiers
and
oflicers'
corps.
Khrushchev's
quick
reaction
against
such
hopes
and
aspirations shows a concern with boomerang effects upon the home govern-
ment similar to the concern of the older type of imperialism. But here the
danger of boomerangs
is temporary, because of the
inevitable time
lag
in
bolshevization between mother country and
colony. Thus,
the
disaffection
of satellite armies, their doubtful
reliability in case of war, proves only that
in
these
regions
national
military
traditions
are
still
intact and
that
bol-
shevization was slower in an
institution which, after
all, was inherited from
the former regime and had not,
like the political police, been built up from
scratch.
Boomerang effects
in totalitarian imperialism, naturally, are distinguished

EPILOGUE
505
from those of national imperialism
in
that
they work
in
the
opposite
di-
rection—the few, faint-hearted
stirrings of unrest
in Russia probably were
caused by events in Poland and Hungary—and so do the measures the gov-
ernment is forced to take to combat them. For just as European imperiahsm
could never transgress certain limits of oppression even when the effective-
ness of extreme measures was beyond doubt, because public opinion at home
would not have supported them and a legal government could not have sur-
vived them, so Russian totalitarianism is forced to crush opposition and with-
hold
all concessions, even when they may
pacify
the oppressed countries
for the time being and make them more
reliable
in case of war, because
such "mildness" would endanger the government
at home and
place
the
conquered territories in a privileged position.
This
last
point
was,
indeed,
of
considerable
importance
in
the
initial
stages of the satellite system, when the main concern of the ruling imperiaUst
power was not
hovv' to maintain a distinction between national and colonial
areas, but on
the contrary how
to
equalize
conditions
in
the newly
con-
quered territories down to the
level of Soviet Russia herself. Russia's post-
war expansion was not caused, and her rule of the conquered
territories
is
not determined, by economic considerations; the
profit motive,
so conspi-
cuous
in Europe's overseas
imperialism,
is
replaced
here by sheer power
considerations. But these are not of a national character and not led by the
interest of Russia
herself, although
it
is
true that
for almost a decade the
Moscow rulers seemed interested
in nothing more than robbing their satel-
lites of their industrial and other possessions and forcing them into grossly
unfair trade agreements. Yet the very neglect with which the Russians used
to treat their spoils from dismantled industries, which were frequently ruined
even before shipped to Russia, indicates that their true aim was much rather
to force
the
satellite standard of
life down than
to
raise
their own.
This
trend has now been reversed and large quantities of coal, iron ore,
oil
as
well as agricultural products are shipped back into the subject regions whose
needs have become a serious drain on Russian resources and have caused
severe shortages in the USSR. The goal
is again equalization of conditions.
However,
these
and
other
distinctions
between
Western
national
and
Russian totalitarian imperialism do not go to the heart of the
matter. For
the immediate
predecessor
of
totalitarian
imperialism
is
not
the
British,
Dutch or French version of overseas colonial rule, but the German, Austrian
and Russian version of a continental imperialism which never actually suc-
ceeded, and therefore
is neglected by students of imperialism, but which in
the form of the so-called pan-movements—pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism
—was
a very
potent
political
force
in Central and
Eastern
Europe.
Not
only does totalitarianism, nazism no less than bolshevism, owe a heavy debt
to pan-Germanism and pan-Slavism in matters of ideology and organization;
their expansion program, though global
in scope and thereby distinguished
from those of the pan-movements, follows the aims of continental imperi-
alism. The main point here
is that
the
strategy
of expansion follows geo-
graphic continuity and extends from a power center to a widening periphery

^06
TOTALITARIANISM
which then
is supposed
to gravitate "naturally" toward
its center. This co-
hesive extension could of course never have tolerated a dichotomy between
home government and colonial
rule; and since continental
imperialism
in-
tended
to found
its "empire"
in Europe
itself,
it did
not depend upon
a
color line to distinguish between "higher and lower breeds"; instead
it pro-
posed to treat European peoples as colonials under the rule of a master race
of Germanic or Slavic origin.
The word "satellite" is indeed a very appropriate metaphor for the Russian
version of totalitarian imperialism. Cohesive extension, and neither far-flung
possessions nor the engineering of communist
revolutions
in
distant coun-
tries, spells the present bolshevist strategy for global conquest.
(It
is indeed
quite likely that Russia would be almost as unhappy as America
if, through
some queer accident of chaotic conditions, the Communist Party should be
able
to seize power
legally
in France.)
Since the expansion
is continuous
and
starts from
the
national
frontier,
it can
easily hide
its
ultimate
aims
behind traditional nationalist claims; thus,
Stalin's demands
at Yalta would
hardly have been granted so easily
if the
allied statesmen had not
felt that
he demanded no more than what Russian foreign policy had
traditionally
aimed
at.
It was the same misunderstanding Hitler profited from
at Munich
when he claimed he wanted no more than the annexation of German
terri-
tory in Austria and Czechoslovakia and the liberation of German minorities.
The
satellite
system
itself,
however,
is
neither
the
only
nor
the most
natural version of totalitarian imperialism.
It must be seen against the back-
ground of Nazi
imperialism, with which the Russian model has only one
thing in common, the insistence on cohesive expansion; Hitler's lack of in-
terest
in acquiring overseas possessions or pressing the
nationalist German
claim for restitution of former German colonies was notorious. Nazi Ger-
many
ruled Western Europe through
Quislings,
corrupt
native
politicians
and collaborators, and carried out a policy of depopulation and extermina-
tion
in the East with
the aim of having these emptied lands colonized by
elite troops after the war. Moscow's agents in the satellite countries are no
Quislings, but old and
tested members
of the communist movement, and
as such they are in no worse a position in the face of their Moscow masters
than any Ukrainian or White Russian bureaucrat, who, also,
is supposed to
sacrifice the national interests of his people to the demands of the interna-
tional movement
or Moscow. And
not even
Stalin,
it
seems, wanted
to
exterminate the populations of the
satellite countries and to recolonize the
territory.
Another
alternative
for
Russian
imperialism
would
have
been
to rule this whole region like the Baltic countries, without the intermediary
of local authorities, that
is, to incorporate them directly into the Soviet Em-
pire which claims to be the Union of federal republics.
The
satellite system
is
clearly
a compromise and perhaps
a temporary
one.
It was born in the post-war constellation of two great powers agreeing
between
themselves
about
their
spheres
of
influence,
albeit
in
a
hostile
manner. As such, the satellite system
is the Russian answer to the American
system of alliances, and their sham independence
is important to Russia as

EPILOGUE
507
the
reflection
of
the
intact
national
sovereignty
of America's
allies. The
metaphor,
unfortunately,
is again only too appropriate; for
it corresponds
to the fears every country must feel when
it goes into an alliance with one
of the super-powers,
a fear, that
is, not so much of losing
its identity
alto-
gether as of becoming a "satellite" country gravitating in the orbit, and kept
alive onJy by the force of attraction,
of the
central power. And
certainly
the danger of the coexistence of two hostile super-powers
is that every sys-
tem
of
alliances
initiated
by
either
will
automatically
degenerate
into
a
satellite system
until the whole world
is sucked into their power orbits.
It
has been American policy to divide the world
into communist,
allied and
neutral countries with
the aim of preserving the balance between the two
super-powers by recognizing in fact,
if not de jure, the respective spheres of
influence and by
insisting on
the
neutrality of the
rest.^ No matter how
uneasy this balance of power may be, the image of American foreign policy
is essentially that of a stable structure. But Russian foreign policy
is guided
by a different image
in which there are no neutral countries. Disregarding
as
irrelevant the
small European
neutrals
like
Switzerland, and focussing
their attention chiefly on Asia and Africa, the Russians, as Khrushchev re-
cently
pointed
out,
reckon
with
a
force
of
revolutionary
nationalism
in
addition
to American "imperialism" and Russian-Chinese communism,
so
that the important third part of the world consists of areas where, according
to communism, the national revolution
is on the agenda of history and with
it an automatic increase of Russia's sphere of influence. Insofar as Russian
utterances about the
possibilities of peaceful competition between the two
super-powers are more than propaganda talk,
it
is not a competition in the
production of cars, refrigerators and butter, but a competition in the gradual
enlargement of the two respective spheres of influence that
is at stake.
Although the
satellite system may have been bom
as a compromise be-
tween the inherent tendencies
of
totalitarian domination and
the need
to
maintain a facsimile of normal foreign policy with regard to the free world,
the devices of rulership developed by Russian
imperialism were
quite
in
agreement with
it.
In every
instance,
the
conquest by
the
might
of
the
Soviet empire was enacted as though a seizure of power by a native party
had taken place. The elaborate preparatory game
in the forties when
first,
prior to
full bolshevization,
several
parties were
tolerated and then
liqui-
dated in favor of a one-party dictatorship, served to fortify the
illusion of
independent domestic developments. What Moscow did was to create exact
replicas not only of
its own form of government but of the developments
which had led up to
it. In order to make sure that the development would
not lead in an "incorrect" direction,
it took care even at the time of Popular
Front
tactics
to reserve the Ministry
of Interior for Communists,
thus
re-
maining in control of the police, which had been set up in nucleo by Soviet
police units accompanying the occupation army. The police was organized
^° The

a degree this recognition
is a fait accompli.

>()S
TOTALITARIANISM
in orthodox totalitarian fashion, an elite spy group within the police charged
with informing on the ordinary members of the police who in turn informed
on the
party members and
the
population
at
large. The bolshevization
of
the country was introduced through the same show trials of prominent party
members we know from
Russia,
while
here,
too,
the
less prominent ones
were
deported
to
concentration
camps,
presumably
in
Russia. From
the
beginning,
moreover,
this
police spy
net was
duplicated by
a
similar
or-
ganization established by the Russian army, and the only distinction between
the two competing bodies was
"that
they
served
different
masters
within
one Soviet oligarchy." This duplication and multiplication of offices
is also
in
line with orthodox
totalitarian
institutions. And
like
its model
in Russia,
the
police
in
the
satellite countries kept "cadre-cards"
for every
citizen in
the country, on which presumably not only compromising information was
recorded,
but
information on
associations,
friends,
family,
and
acquain-
tances which
is much more valuable for totalitarian terror.
Yet,
while
the
police was
set up
in
strict accordance with
the Russian
model,
the
device
of creating
replicas and
staffing them
with
native
per-
sonnel was
not
followed.
This was
the
only
institution
in which Russian
advisers did not stay
in the background but openly supervised the
natives
and even ran the show
trials. Something similar seems to have happened to
the satellite armies, which
after the Hungarian uprising were put under the
command of Russian officers, but while
this
military control was clearly a
reaction
against
unforeseen
developments,
the
control
of
the
police was
planned as though the Russian rulers thought that everything would follow
automatically once
this most important device of total domination had
set
the mechanism
into motion.
There
is,
however,
another
rather inconspicuous
but
not
uninteresting
difference between the Russian and the
satellite system, which concerns the
method of selecting rank and
file members
of the
police.
Here,
too,
the
Russians had
to
fall back upon experiences
in the
early
stages
of
totali-
tarian rule and rely upon criminal and otherwise compromised elements in
the population. This stands in stark contrast to the system the Russians have
been practicing for more than twenty-five years now,
in which the
police
appoints
its new members from
the rank and
file
of the
party and even
from the population at large. The point
is that members of the NKVD are
drafted into police service in almost the same way as
all citizens are drafted
into military
service. This flaw
in reproduction obviously
is caused by the
time
lag
in
totalitarian development we mentioned above;
in
the
satellite
countries the police
is still an "elite" body in the original sense of the word,
whose members
are chosen
according
to
characteristics which
distinguish
them not only from
the ordinary citizen but
also from the ordinary party
member.
Up to now,
this time element has thwarted Moscow's attempts to create
exact
replicas of the Russian government
in the
satellite countries. We do
not know whether this time lag would have become so dangerously notice-
able
if the succession crisis after Stalin's death had not pushed
all develop-

ments in uncalculated directions. At any event,
it was
at that moment that
the facsimile character of the
satelHte governments, with
its
slavish imita-
tion of the Moscow masters, took
its revenge. For the destalinization period
and the succession crisis, which did not create major disturbances in Russia
proper, had
their most dangerous consequences
in those countries, Poland
and Hungary,
which
followed
Russia
most
obediently
in
destalinization,
while Rumania and Albania and even Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, where
the
Stalinists had succeeded
in keeping power against the Moscow trend,
remained quiet and loyal. No doubt, from the viewpoint of totalitarian im-
perialism,
destalinization was
a major mistake.
It
is chiefly
this difference
in reaction to developments
in Russia which
explains
certain
diversities
of present conditions
in
the
satellite
countries,
and
this
diversity
is due
to
certain
failures
of
totalitarian imperialism;
it
does not indicate a new, more promising stage in
its development. The seri-
ousness of these
failures
is best gauged by the number of Soviet divisions
stationed in the
satellite countries—28 garrisons are
still needed to occupy
Hungary
while Hungarian
soldiers, now commanded
directly by
Russian
officers, can
still not be trusted with weapons, and the
situation
is hardly
much better elsewhere. The presence
of Russian
troops, though
legalized
by the Warsaw pact which could conveniently be modelled on NATO, may
help to destroy the illusion of independence for the sake of which the whole
system was devised and which in
itself, even disregarding all other atrocities,
constitutes a worse hypocrisy than any committed by imperialist Europe in
its colonial rule. Sitting on bayonets
is not only an old-fashioned and rather
uncomfortable device of domination,
it
is
a serious setback to
totalitarian
aspirations which had hoped to be able to keep the satellites in the Moscow
orbit by the sheer force of ideology and terror. But until now these setbacks
have not been
able
to break
the
spell
of
attraction
this system
exerts
in
Asia and Africa,
that
is,
in
all
regions whose
political and emotional
life
is
still tuned to the reaction against an older imperialism where foreigners
openly assumed power. Unfortunately, these people, without much experience
in politics in general and in modern politics in particular, are only too easy
to fool; they are apt to conclude that whatever this
is,
it
is not imperialism
as they knew
it, and whatever the faults of the regime may be, the principle
of racial equality
is not violated. This
is not likely to change so long as the
former colonial people are color conscious instead of freedom minded.
The failures of totalitarian imperialism should be taken no less seriously
than the successes of Soviet technicians and engineers. But neither the
fail-
ures of 1956 nor the successes of 1957 indicate a new development of this
form of government from within, either in the direction of enlightened despot-
ism or some other form of dictatorship. If the dramatic events of the Hungar-
ian revolution demonstrate anything,
it is at best the dangers which may grow
out of the lawlessness and formlessness inherent
in the very dynamics
of
this regime and so glaringly apparent in
its inability to solve the succession
problem. At present, this danger is past; Khrushchev seized power through a
careful repetition of all the methods Stalin used in his rise to power, and we
do not know yet whether this repetition of the relatively bloodless twenties

510
TOTALITARIANISM
will again be followed by a full-fledged terror like that of the thirties. More
important, wc cannot
even
tell
whether
the
succession
crisis would have
become dangerous
if
it had not been for the presence of the
satellites and
their insufticient training
in totalitarianism. One may suspect that only the
coincidence
of
the
succession
crisis
with
recent expansion brought
about
actual danger to the regime.
Still, the danger signs of 1956 were real enough, and although today they
are overshadowed by
the
successes of 1957 and the
fact
that
the system
was able
to survive,
it would not be wise to forget them.
If they promise
anything
at
all,
it
is much
rather
a sudden and dramatic
collapse
of
the
whole regime than
a gradual
normalization. Such
a catastrophic
develop-
ment,
as we learned from
the Hungarian
revolution, need not
necessarily
entail chaos—though
it
certainly would be
rather unwise
to expect from
the Russian people,
after forty years of tyranny and
thirty years of
totali-
tarianism,
the same
spirit and
the same
political
productivity
which
the
Hungarian people showed in their most glorious hour.

Hannal^^ren!
Containing two new chapters: ideology and terror and reflec-
tions ON THE HUNGARIAN REVOLUTION
To the
First Edition of The Origins of Totalitarianism
(the present
expanded edition contains two completely new chapters)
the critical
response was unanimous:
"An anatomy of totalitarianism that
is both a work of synthesis and
a notable contribution to original thinking.
.
.
."
The New Yorker
".
.
.
it
is written throughout under the
stress of deep emotion:
for
Miss Arendt totalitarianism
is a tragedy of the human race. ...
It is
also a pessimistic book ... the reader can be grateful for a disquiet-
ing, moving and thought-provoking book."
E. H. Carr, The New York times
"With
this book, Hannah Arendt emerges
as the most original and
profound—therefore the most valuable—political theoretician of our
times.
I can compare her only with another woman: Simone Weil."
Dwight Macdonald, the new leader
".
.
. her book will be read as a brilliant creative reconstruction.
.
.
.
It will stand as the measure of one person's spiritual torment and vic-
tory."
August Heckscher, The New York herald-tribune
"It
is not only an achievement in historiography, but also in political
science
and,
as
in
its extraordinarily
illuminating discussion
of the
rights of man,
in philosophy and
ethics.
It
is throughout a densely
imaginative work,
truly serious. ...
I happen to think such an ex-
perience
in understanding our times as this book provides
is
itself a
social force not to be underestimated."
