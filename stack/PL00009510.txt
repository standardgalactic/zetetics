Abstract.
Conway and Radin’s “quaquaversal” tiling of R3 is known to exhibit statistical
rotational symmetry in the inﬁnite volume limit. A ﬁnite patch, however, cannot be perfectly
isotropic, and we compute the rates at which the anisotropy scales with size. In a sample
of volume N, tiles appear in O(N 1/6) distinct orientations. However, the orientations are
not uniformly populated. A small (O(N 1/84)) set of these orientations account for the
majority of the tiles. Furthermore, these orientations are not uniformly distributed on SO(3).
Sample averages of functions on SO(3) seem to approach their ergodic limits as N −1/336.
Since even macroscopic patches of a quaquaversal tiling maintain noticeable anisotropy, a
hypothetical physical quasicrystal whose structure was similar to the quaquaversal tiling
could be identiﬁed by anisotropic features of its electron diffraction pattern.

Introduction and Results
This paper concerns statistical properties of Conway and Radin’s [CR] quaquaversal
(QQ) tiling of Euclidean 3-space. A QQ tiling is made by copies of a single wedge-shaped
tile, appearing in an inﬁnite number of distinct orientations. The set of orientations is
a dense subgroup of SO(3), and the orientations are in fact uniformly distributed on
SO(3): Given a smooth function f on SO(3), the average value of f on the orientations
of tiles in a large patch of R3 is close to the integral of f over SO(3) (with respect to
Haar measure). This property, called “statistical rotational symmetry” by Radin [R1],

suggests that a large quasicrystal based on the QQ tiling should appear round, and its
physical properties should be isotropic. We call such a material “asymptotically round.”
In this paper we address the question of how large such a quasicrystal would have to
be to make its roundness manifest. We show that the convergence to rotational symmetry
is polynomial in the sample size, but with an extremely small exponent. Samples with
1024 tiles have pronounced anisotropy, and even samples with 10100 tiles have noticable
anisotropy. In short, the asymptotic roundness of the QQ tiling, while mathematically
correct, is well beyond the range of any conceivable physics. If a physical material were
modeled on the QQ tiling, it would exhibit considerably more isotropy than a crystal,
while still being considerably less isotropic than a liquid or a glass. These comparisons
are discussed further in Section 5. There is some evidence [R2] that such asymptotically
round quasicrystals may indeed exist in nature.
The slow growth of complexity is not unique to the QQ tiling, but is a typical fea-
ture of three-dimensional substitution tilings. Two-dimensional substitution tilings have
even slower growth, with the number of orientations growing only as the logarithm of
the sample size. We expect that any three-dimensional substitution tiling that is quali-
tatively more isotropic than the QQ tiling would have to have a very complicated sub-
stitution rule. In other words, much of the complexity of the distribution of orienta-
tions would have to be built in from the start, sacriﬁcing the elegant simplicity of the
QQ tiling.
The orientations of a randomly chosen tile within the QQ tiling is described by a biased
random walk in a dense subgroup of SO(3). Lubotsky et al. [LPS1], [LPS2] considered
unbiased random walks on such subgroups in their study of optimal distributions of points
on S2, and some of our methods are related to theirs. Long-time behavior of unbiased
random walks on inﬁnite cyclic subgroups of SO(2) have been studied by Su [S].
It is possible to compare the optimal distribution of elements of SO(3) of [LPS1] with
the distribution of orientations in the QQ tiling as follows. The “operator discrepancy”

of L2(SO(3)) (or L2(S2)). This operator is Hermitian and has discrete spectrum, so its
operator norm is the supremum of the eigenvalues. For an optimal distribution of N

421
points, with N −1 prime, this supremum was shown to be 2√N −1/N, and in particular
to decay as N −1/2. In our case a distribution of orientations of N QQ tiles is obtained
by applying a ﬁxed Hecke operator log8 N times; the log8 Nth power of the largest
eigenvalue of this Hecke operator goes as N −1/336. These eigenvalues are discussed at
greater length in Section 4.
The operator discrepancy is a very strict measure of anisotropy. Indeed, all distribu-
tions of points on the circle have operator discrepancy equal to 1. In this paper we also
consider two much weaker measures of spreading. The ﬁrst is just a count of the number
of distinct orientations in SO(3), which turns out to scale as N 1/6. The second is the
number of distinct orientations needed to account for half the sample, which scales as
N 1/84. These measures are discussed in Sections 2 and 3, respectively.
The QQ tiling is constructed as follows (see [CR] for details). We begin with a single
right triangular prism,
√
3 units wide, one unit high, and one unit deep, as in Fig. 2(a).
This prism is divided into eight congruent pieces, each similar to the original. The front
four resulting tiles are shown in Fig. 2(b), the back four in Fig. 2(c). We then rescale the
entire pattern by a linear factor of 2, obtaining a cluster of eight tiles, each congruent to
the original.
We can repeat this process of subdivision and rescaling to obtain a cluster of 64 tiles,
of 512 tiles, and so on. We embed each cluster of size 8n within the succeeding cluster of
size 8n+1 (there are eight ways to do this). The union of all the clusters is then an inﬁnite
tiling, typically covering all of R3.
After a “parent” tile is subdivided, the orientations of the “daughters” are closely
related to that of the parent. We describe the orientation of a tile by a matrix M ∈
SO(3), the columns of which are unit vectors pointing along ﬁxed features of the tile.
There exist ﬁxed matrices g1, . . . , g8 ∈SO(3) such that the orientation of the ith
daughter is Mgi, where the orientation of the parent is M. After two subdivisions,
the orientations of the granddaughters are of the form Mgigj. After n subdivisions
the orientations of the descendant tiles are equal to M times words of length n in the
generators {gi}.
We now see why two-dimensional tilings have extremely slow growth. SO(2) is
abelian,sothenumberofwordsoflengthn inaﬁxedsetofgeneratorshasonlypolynomial
growth in n, while the sample size of a substitution tiling is exponential in the number
of subdivisions. In other words, the number of orientations is logarithmic in the sample
size. SO(3) is nonabelian, however, so the number of distinct words of length n grows
exponentially with n, hence as a power of the sample size. The power, however, need
not be large. For the QQ tiling we will prove:
Theorem 1.1.
Let n ≥2. If n = 2k is even, then the number of distinct orientations
in the nth subdivision of a tile is 24(2k −1) = 24(N 1/6 −1), where N = 8n is the
total number of tiles. If n = 2k + 1 is odd, the number of distinct orientations in the nth
subdivision is 34 × 2k −24 = (34/
√
2)N 1/6 −24.
ByTheorem1.1,amacroscopicsampleof,say,1024 tileswouldappearinover200,000
different orientations. The orientations do not, however, appear with equal frequency,
and they are not evenly distributed in SO(3). In a sample of 827 ≈2.4×1024 tiles, a mere
104 orientations account for 69% of the tiles, while in a sample of 8120 ≈2.3 × 10108

tiles, 1000 orientations account for slightly over half the tiles. The asymptotic behavior
is given by:
Theorem 1.2.
Let ρ >
1
28, and let Fα(n) be the number of distinct orientations needed
to account for a fraction α of the 8n tiles in the nth subdivision. For any ﬁxed α,
lim
n→∞2−ρn Fα(n) = 0.
That is, 2−n/28Fα(n) is asymptotically smaller than any exponential in n (i.e., any
power of the volume), so we speak of Fα(n) as growing essentially as 2n/28, or as the
84th root of the volume.
Finally, we consider the rate at which the orientations approach a uniform distribution
on SO(3). Let f (M) be a real-valued function of M ∈SO(3), and let fn(M) be the
average value of f on the 8n orientations of the nth-order descendants of a tile of
orientation M. If f is continuous, then fn(M) must converge to
R
SO(3) f dµ for every
M, where dµ is the Haar measure on SO(3). However, this convergence may be quite
slow:
Theorem 1.3.
There exists a smooth function f : SO(3) →R and a point M ∈SO(3)
such that | fn(M) −
R
SO(3) f dµ| > (0.9938)n for every n.
We believe this result to be close to sharp:
Conjecture 1.4.
For any continuous function f : SO(3) →R and any point M ∈
SO(3), there exists a constant C such that | fn(M) −
R
SO(3) f dµ| < C2−n/112 ≈
C(0.9938303)n for every n.
In other words, it appears that functions do converge to their average values exponen-
tially in the volume, with the exponents bounded away from zero, but there are exponents
about as small as
1
336. As in all linear systems of exponential decay, the long-time be-
havior is dominated by the smallest exponents, so we expect the anisotropy of a generic
function on SO(3) to decay roughly as N −1/336 for sufﬁciently large N.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we examine the set of orientations
that can arise from successive subdivisions of a single tile. This set turns out to be a
subgroup, denoted G(6, 4), of SO(3). The analysis of this section is a special case of
some general results of [RS1]. We establish a canonical form for an element of G(6, 4)
as a word in two generators, and provide an explicit list of the orientations in the nth
subdivision, thereby proving Theorem 1.1. We also develop a measure, called “size,” of
the complexity of an element of G(6, 4).
In Section 3 we consider the populations of the various orientations of the descendants
of a given tile as a function of n, the number of subdivisions. We show that the “size” of
the orientation of a randomly chosen tile is described by a biased random walk (on the
nonnegative integers) with a reﬂecting barrier. Although the maximum size is n/2, the
distribution of sizes is approximately Gaussian with mean n/28 + O(1). Since there are
O(2n/28) words of size n/28 or less, Theorem 1.2 follows.

Theorem 1.2 is an asymptotic statement. To obtain results for speciﬁc values of n we
numerically implement the random walk for n up to 200. This establishes the claims
previously made about samples of size 827 and 8120.
In Section 4 we consider the rate at which the distribution of orientations approaches
uniformity on SO(3). There is a linear map L on L2(SO(3)) such that fn = Ln f .
L is similar to the Hecke operators considered in [LPS1] and [LPS2], except that
those Hecke operators were Hermitian, while L is not. Nonetheless, the spectrum of
L appears to be entirely real. If fn is to approach a limiting function exponentially,
the base of the exponent (for generic f ) is the largest eigenvalue of L that is less
than 1. The operator L is the direct sum of ﬁnite-dimensional blocks, each block cor-
responding to an irreducible representation of SO(3). By numerically diagonalizing
blocks corresponding to the ﬁrst 300 representations (blocks with total dimension over
36,000,000), we ﬁnd a large number of eigenvalues over 0.993, with the largest be-
ing approximately 0.99381, and conjecture that the eigenvalues are bounded above by
2−1/112 ≈0.9938303.
2.
The Group G(6,4)
Let Rx
θ denote a rotation about the x axis by an angle θ. The group generated by Rx
2π/p
and Ry
2π/q is denoted G(p, q). (For a discussion of G(p, q) for general p and q, and
for further generalizations, see [RS1]and [RS2].) The set of orientations in the QQ tiling
is precisely G(6, 4), generated by S := Ry
π/2 and T := Rx
π/3. Indeed, the orientations
g1, . . . , g8 of the eight daughters of a tile in standard position are all words in S and T ,
and it is not hard to get S and T themselves as products of the gi’s. To understand these
orientations, therefore, we must understand G(6, 4).
A word α in S and T is said to be in canonical form if
α = Sa0T b0,
(2.1)
with a0 ∈{0, 1, 2, 3} and b0 ∈{0, 3}, or if
α = WSTb1 ST b2 · · · ST bn E,
(2.2)
with n ≥1, with W of the form (2.1), with each bi = 2 or 4, and with E = 1 or S.
We shall soon see that each element of G(6, 4) can be expressed by a unique canonical
form. The size of an element of G(6, 4) with canonical form (2.2) is deﬁned to be n.
(Elements of the form (2.1) have size zero.)
To understand the group G(6, 4), we represent S and T by explicit 3 × 3 matrices.
Relative to the standard basis {e1, e2, e3} of R3, the matrices of S and T are

Theorem 2.1.
Every element g ∈G(6, 4) can be expressed in canonical form, and
the canonical form is unique. If g has size n, then, in the representation (2.4), 2ng is
an integer matrix with at least one odd matrix element. There exist exactly eight group
elements of size 0 and 16 × 2n elements of size n > 0.
Proof.
Note that 2ST 2 and 2ST 4 are matrices with integer entries of the form
Ã even
odd
odd

,
(2.6)
and that the product of two or more matrices of the form given in (2.6) is also of the
form given in (2.6). If g can be expressed in canonical form (2.6), then
2ng = W(2ST b1)(2ST b2) · · · (2ST bn)E
= W(form 2.6)(form 2.6) · · · (form 2.6)E
= W(form 2.6)E.
(2.7)
Since S is a permutation matrix (up to sign), and T 3 is the identity (up to sign),
2ng is an integer matrix with four odd matrix elements and ﬁve even matrix ele-
ments. If g is of canonical form (2.1), then 2ng = 20g = g is an integer matrix
with three odd matrix elements. This proves the second statement of the theorem, and
also shows that the identity can be put in canonical form in only one way, namely
1 = S0T 0.
To see that every element of G(6, 4) can be put in canonical form, begin with an
arbitrary word
α = Sa1T b1 · · · SanT bn
(2.8)
in S and T . If any of the ai’s is even, or any of the bi’s is a multiple of 3, we can use the
relations
ST 3 = T 3S−1
(2.9)
and
S2T = T −1S2
(2.10)
to shorten the word. So we can assume that all the ai’s (except possibly a1) are odd,
and that none of the bi’s (except possibly b1) are multiples of 3. We then use (2.9) to

426
B. Draco, L. Sadun, and D. Van Wieren
extract powers of T 3 and move them leftwards, changing T 1 to T 4 and changing T 5 to
T 2. We then use (2.10) to extract powers of S2 and move them leftwards, changing S3
to S. In the process, we may change some T 2’s to T 4’s and vice versa, but that does not
affect the form (2.2). Finally, if b1 is not divisible by 3, we use (2.9) to rewrite Sa1T b1 as
Sa0T 3b0 ST b′
1 with b′
1 = 2 or 4.
To see that a canonical form is unique, suppose g and g′ are distinct canonical forms
for the same group element. Using the relations (2.9) and (2.10), we could then shorten
the word g′g−1 to a nontrivial word in canonical form, which would have to represent
the identity. However, we have already seen that there are no nontrivial canonical forms
for the identity.
Since group elements are in 1–1 correspondence with canonical forms, we can count
group elements of any given size. There are eight choices for W, two choices for each
bi, and two choices for E, for a total of 16 × 2n elements of size n > 0. For size 0 there
are only eight choices, four for a0 and two for b0.
We now have the machinery to understand the orientations of tiles in the n-fold
subdivision of a single QQ tile. In a single subdivision, the daughters are described by
group elements {g1, . . . , g8} with
g1 =

g7 = Rx
4π/3Ry
π = T 4S2 = S2T 2,
g8 =

4π/3
= T 4.
(2.11)
Note that T = g7g6, so the semigroup generated by the gi’s is precisely the group
generated by S and T . Also note that only two of the gi’s, namely g7 and g8, have size
1, while the rest have size 0. Since g2
7, g2
8, g7g8, and g8g7 all have size 1 or less, the
orientations in the second subdivision have size at most 1 and the orientations in the 2kth
subdivision have size at most k. This shows that the number of possible orientations in
the nth subdivision is bounded by a constant multiple of 2n/2.
However, we can be more precise. The following theorem implies Theorem 1.1:
Theorem 2.2.
The orientations appearing in subdivisions of a single tile (of standard
orientation) are as follows. Let Pm be the set of words of length m in the two generators
ST 2 and ST 4. For k > 0, the orientations of the 2kth subdivision are:
1. T b PmSa, with no restriction on a or b, and with m ranging from 0 to k −2,
2. T b Pk−1Sa, with b = 0, 2, 3, or 5 and a arbitrary,
3. T b Pk−1Sa, with b = 1 or 4 and a = 0 or 2,
4. ST 2Pk−1Sa, with a = 0 or 2, and
5. T 3(ST 4)Pk−1Sa, with a = 0 or 2.

Growth Rates in the Quaquaversal Tiling
427
For k > 0, the orientations in the (2k + 1)st subdivision are
1. T b PmSa, with no restriction on a or b and m ranging from 0 to k −1,
2. T b PkSa, with b = 0, 2, 3, or 5 and a = 0 or 2,
3. ST 2Pk−1Sa, with a = 1 or 3, and
4. T 3ST 4Pk−1Sa, with a = 1 or 3.
Proof.
It is not hard to see that, in each case, the sets are disjoint and their cardinalities
add up to the total indicated in Theorem 1.1. To complete the proof we must check
(i) that the claimed orientations for two subdivisions are correct, (ii) that the claimed
orientationsfor2k subdivisionstimesthegenerators g1, . . . , g8 givepreciselytheclaimed
orientations for 2k + 1 subdivisions, and (iii) that the claimed orientations for 2k + 1
subdivisions times the generators g1, . . . , g8 give precisely the claimed orientations for
2k + 2 subdivisions. We leave this straightforward (but quite tedious) computation as an
exercise for the highly motivated reader.
3.
Population Dynamics
In Section 2 we counted the number of distinct orientations of tiles in the nth subdivision
of a QQ tile, which equals the number of algebraically distinct words of length n in
the generators g1, . . . , g8. In this section we consider the distribution of tiles among
the various orientations. Equivalently, we count repetitions in the words of length n in
the gi’s.
We do this by modeling the subdivision process as a random walk on G(6, 4). If
at some stage we are at the group element M, then at the next stage we can go to
Mg1, Mg2, . . . , Mg8, each with probability 1/8. The distribution of orientations in the
nth subdivision of a tile (with standard orientation) is precisely the nth iterate of this
random walk, starting at the origin. The following theorem implies Theorem 1.2.
Theorem 3.1.
Consider the random walk starting at the origin, and let P(k, n) be the
probability that the nth iteration yields a group element of size k or greater. For any
ρ >
1
28, limn→∞P(nρ, n) = 0.
Proof.
We divide G(6, 4) into sets according to size and the pattern at the end of the
canonical form. The random walk on G(6, 4) then induces a random walk on the space
of sets, and we show that the bias in this random walk causes the average size to increase
by 1
28 each turn. The result then follows from the central limit theorem.
Let R(k, ST 2) be the set of group elements of size k whose canonical forms end
with ST 2. R(k, ST 4), R(k, T 2S), and R(k, T 4S) are deﬁned similarly. R(0) is the set
of elements of size 0.
If M ∈R(k, ST 2), then Mg1, Mg4 and Mg5 are equal to M, and so are in R(k, ST 2).
Mg2 is in R(k, T 4S), Mg3 is in R(k, T 2S), and Mg6 is in R(k, ST 4). Mg7 may be
in R(k −1, T 2S) or R(k −1, T 4S), depending on whether M ends with ST 2ST 2 or
ST 4ST 2. However, if Mg7 ∈R(k −1, T 2S), then Mg8 ∈R(k −1, T 4S), and vice versa.
In either case, starting in R(k, ST 2), there is a 3/8 probability of staying in R(k, ST 2)

428

and a 1/8 probabilty for each of the destinations R(k, ST 4), R(k, T 2S), R(k, T 4S),
R(k −1, T 2S) and R(k −1, T 4S).

Since the long-time behaviors of positively biased random walks are independent of
the boundary conditions at k = 0, the reﬂecting barrier at k = 0 does not affect the
theorem. To establish the theorem, we need only calculate the bias in the random walk
away from k = 0 and show it equals 1
28.
We ﬁrst compute the distribution of ST 2, ST 4, T 2S and T 4S endings. Summing over

That is, asymptotically 4
14 of the tiles have orientations whose canonical forms end with
ST 2, 4
14 end with ST 4, 3
14 end with T 2S, and 3
14 end with T 4S.
On each iteration, an ST 2 state has a 2
8 chance of decreasing k (and none of increas-
ing), ST 4 states have no chance of either increasing or decreasing k, while T 2S and T 4S
states each have a 2
8 chance of increasing k and no chance of decreasing. Weighing these
chances by the ( 4
14, 4

walk there is a 3
28 chance of increasing k and a 2
28 chance of decreasing k, for a net bias
of 1
28.
Theorem 3.1 is an asymptotic result that does not indicate how many iterations are
needed to reach the asymptotic regime. Indeed, the bias in the random walk is so small
that, for moderate numbers of iterations, one would expect diffusion and the reﬂecting
barrier at k = 0 to be quite signiﬁcant. To measure this transient behavior we rely on
the following numerical implementation, in MATLAB, of the biased random walk. Here
zz(n) is the fraction of orientations of size 0 in the nth generation, st2(k,n) (resp.
st4(k,n), t2s(k,n), t4s(k,n)) is the fraction in R(ST 2, k) (resp. R(ST 4, k),
R(T 2S, k), R(T 4S, k)) in the nth generation, and tot(k+1,n) is the fraction of size
k in the nth generation.

Note that by Theorem 2.1 there are exactly 8 orientations of size 0, 40 of size at
most 1, 104 of size at most 2, 232 of size at most 3, 488 of size at most 4, 1000
of size at most 5, 2024 of size at most 6, 4072 of size at most 7, and 8168 of size
at most 8. Thus for n = 27, just 104 orientations account for the majority of the
tiles, while for n = 120, a mere 1000 orientations account for the majority of the
tiles.
Table 1 shows the distribution of sizes for three samples, a microscopic sample with
85 = 32,768 tiles, a macroscopic sample with 827 ≈2.42 × 1024 tiles (about 4 moles),
and an impossibly large sample of 8120 ≈2.35×10108 tiles. Table 2 shows similar results
for n = 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.

Approach to the Ergodic Limit
Let f (M) be a function on SO(3) and let fn(M) be the average of f over the 8n tiles in
the n-fold subdivision of a tile of orientation M. Equivalently,
fn(M) = 8−n

As n →∞, fn(g) approaches the constant limit
R
SO(3) f dµ, where dµ is the Haar
measure. The question is how fast the (ergodic) limit is approached.
One approach to the problem is to consider the linear operator L: L2(SO(3)) →
L2(SO(3)) deﬁned by
L f (M) =

λi:
f =

so that
fn =

(4.3)
Of course, the constant function is an eigenfunction of L with eigenvalue 1. The rate at
which fn approaches a constant function is determined by the second-largest eigenvalue
of L.

The operator L is quite similar to the Hecke operators considered in [LPS1] and
[LPS2], except that the set {gi} is not balanced, as the inverses of g3 and g8 are not in the
set. As a result, L is not a self-adjoint operator on L2(SO(3)), not even with a weighted
measure, and we know of no a priori reason why the eigenvalues of L need be real.
However, the numerical experiments described below indicate that the eigenvalues of L
are indeed real. We do not understand the reason for this.
The natural (left and right) actions of SO(3) on L2(SO(3)), namely (l,r): f (g) →
f (lgr), decomposes L2(SO(3)) into irreducible representations of SO(3). Since L
is a linear combination of right-translations, it acts separately on each representation.
Thus the inﬁnite-dimensional job of diagonalizing L on all of L2 breaks down into a
sequence of ﬁnite-dimensional problems, namely diagonalizing L on each irreducible
representation that appears in the decomposition of L2.
The irreducible representations of SO(3) are standard. The spin-ℓrepresentation, of
dimension 2ℓ+ 1, appears 2ℓ+ 1 times in the decomposition of L2. In particular, each
representation appears at least once. For each representation Rℓ, we must diagonalize
the (2ℓ+ 1) × (2ℓ+ 1) matrix
Lℓ=
1
8 [Rℓ(g1) + · · · + Rℓ(g8)] .
(4.4)
We have done this, using MATLAB, for ℓup to 300, thereby diagonalizing L on
a subspace of L2(SO(3)) of total dimension greater than 36,000,000. There are nu-
merous eigenvalues over 0.993, but none over 0.994; the largest known eigenvalue is
λ ≈0.99381, appearing in the ℓ= 258 representation. This proves Theorem 1.4,
and suggests there is an upper bound to the eigenvalues slightly above 0.99381. Since
powers of 2 appear repeatedly in the analysis, and since Theorem 1.2 suggests a time
scale of 28 subdivisions, 2−1/(4×28) ≈0.9938303 is a fairly natural guess for that upper
bound.

Conclusions and Speculations
Much of the interest in tilings stems from the fact that crystals and quasicrystals are
modeled by tilings in which the tiles appear in only a ﬁnite number of orientations.
Is there a form of matter that is modeled on aperiodic tilings with statistical rotational
symmetry, in particular on a substitution tiling such as the QQ? If so, how would such a
form of matter be recognized?
This paper provides the tools needed to recognize such a substance. We have com-
puted the distribution of orientations in a sample of size N = 8n of the QQ tiling.
The exact same calculation gives the distribution of orientations of 8-tile clusters in a

434
B. Draco, L. Sadun, and D. Van Wieren
sample of size 8n+1, of 64-tile clusters in a sample of size 8n+2, and so on. In partic-
ular, the angular distribution of the relative positions of nearby tiles, and therefore the
angular distribution of the electron diffraction pattern, are governed by the results of this
paper.
To detect an asymptotically round quasicrystal, one must look at the diffraction pattern
of a ﬁnite sample and decompose it into spherical harmonics. As long as the wavelengths
in question are much shorter than the size of the sample, the angular distribution of the
diffraction pattern will scale with sample size in a manner determined by the eigenvalues.
If a spherical harmonic is an eigenvector of L with eigenvalue λ, then the diffraction
pattern of a sample of size 8N will exhibit this harmonic a factor of λ less than that of a
sample of size N.
As a result, some harmonics will be essentially absent from the diffraction pattern
of a macroscopic sample; those correspond to eigenfunctions of L with λn ≪1. Other
modes, with 1 −λ comparable with or less than 1/n, will appear. A macroscopic (say,
N = 827) sample of the QQ tiling, for example, would have a diffraction pattern with a
small but probably detectable ℓ= 4 component, and with essentially undamped ℓ= 6,
ℓ= 8, and ℓ= 10 components. There are relatively few eigenfunctions with such large
eigenvalues (even for ℓ= 8, all but two of the 17 eigenvalues are less than 0.65), so the
diffraction pattern will be dominated by the ℓ= 0 (isotropic) component, with some
corrections from harmonics with ℓ= 6, 8, 10, etc. This result is much more isotropic
than that of a crystal or ordinary quasicrystal (for which many harmonics are completely
undamped, and the spectrum consists of discrete points), while much less isotropic than
that of an amorphous substance such as a glass, for which only the isotropic ℓ= 0 term
is observable.
The radial dependence of the diffraction pattern also carries important information.
As with other quasicrystals, and unlike amorphous media, one expects asymptotically
round quasicrystals to have radially self-similar diffraction patterns. In combination, a
self-similar radial pattern combined with a mildly anisotropic angular pattern should
indicate an asymptotically round quasicrystal.
