A unified description of the depinning threshold Ec for domain walls in the random field Ising 
model is given. The coherence length _RC — J?<r1 of the metastable state is proportional to h~ vu, 
where h is the random field amplitude. For broad walls, the results interpolate between recent 
findings of Bruinsma and Aeppli (yH = 4/(5 — d)) valid at temperatures T < T^(t) and those of 
Villain (vH = 2) for Th(t) < T 
Tc0. Tco is the transition temperature of the pure system and 
Th(t) ~ ¿2(3-<*)/(5-d)/ln t, t denotes the time. For narrow walls vH = 2/(3 — d) is found for T < 
< Tb(t), vH = 2 for T > Th(t), 
Th(t) ~ A2(2~ ^ - « O / l n t and d £ 3. For d

dependence is expected of Bc on A-2. Vacancies are found to be decisive for wall pinning in diluted 
antiferromagnets in small external fields.

where i, j denote lattice sites, Si = ¿1, and HiHj = h2bij. It has been argued that 
this model has a lower critical dimensionality dt = 2 [1 to 9], although some authors 
still claim d, = 3 [10, 11]. 
Experiments on the RFIM are mainly performed with diluted antiferromagnets in 
external fields [23, 12 to 14] and show hysteresis effects. In particular, no long-range 
order is found for d = 3 if the system is cooled from the high-temperature phase in 
non-zero field H. Neutron scattering experiments in two or three dimensions [13, 14] 
yield a correlation length

The absence of long-range order has been traced back in these cases to domain wall 
pinning in metastable states [15, 16, 22]: once a domain state is created at low tem-
perature (e.g. by field cooling from high temperatures), only those parts of the walls 
with inverse curvature R <[ lt(. evolve toward a state of lower wall density. Wall 
configurations with R 
Rc remain frozen. 
The present article is devoted to the attempt to give a unified description of the 
pinning forces acting on metastable domain walls in the IiFIM. For broad walls, our 
results generalize earlier findings of Bruinsma and Aepplli [15] and Villain [16, 17]. 
For narrow walls, new results are obtained. We estimate also the pinning due to 
vacancies in diluted antiferromagnets. 
2. Interface Model 
We start from the equation of motion for the interface elongation f(r), measured in 
the z-direction from some reference plane (r, 0),

denotes the interface Hamiltonian belonging to the continuum version of the bulk 
RFIM [3], The first term in (4) represents the elastic energy of the distorted wall, g 
denotes the interfaces stiffness constant. The second term results from the Zeeman 
energy between the random field (Hi —> h(r, z)) and the spins. E is an external driving 
force per unit area, r] denotes the thermal noise. (3), (4) are only valid for |V/| ^ 1 [18] 
and walls with intrinsic width | large compared with the lattice spacing. 
We use now a wave-packet decomposition [3, 4],

where (p>{r) denotes a set of orthogonal functions, localized both in real and momentum 
spaces. (5) permits an approximate separation of the Hamiltonian 3C «s £

Since we restrict ourselves in the following to a fixed wave-packet, we omit the index 
X. In all relations of this article, the equal sign is meant to signify equality apart from 
numerical factors. Ths lattice constant is set equal to unity. 
3. Metastable States 
Next we consider the properties of the Hamiltonian (4'). A typical example for the 
potential is given in Fig. 1 [5], The Hamiltonian has metastable states 836/df = 0, 
which fulfil 
h 
/ = 
„(5-rf)/2 
g 
and have a characteristic average value

Note that w diverges for a —* 0. Since s(f) varies over a distance a by an amount 
!/)/«, neighbouring metastable states (of distance a) are separated by energy barriers 
m = /¡,^-D/2 a1'2 . 
(10) 
Most of the metastable states have a high energy, but there is a small fraction of 
low-energy states, which are characterized by Zeeman energies comparable in magnitude 
m 
(but with opposite sign) with the elastic energy. With / e(z) dz— |/|1/2 for |/| ^>a, 
o 
the corresponding average value for these states is [2 to 6]

w(q), w(q) are meaningful expressions only on a sufficiently large scale 
g*, 
where q* can be estimated from the condition w(q*) =t= a. The latter yields

(13) 
which fulfils also W(Q*) = a. 
Note that CJ(Q) ¡5: CO(Q) for Q ^ Q*. 
4. Pinning Forces 
Now we look for the maximal pinning force Ec, which keeps / in a certain metastable 
state. We start with the case T = 0. As follows from (6), the pinning force F can be 
estimated as 
F = hQ^-WZa-1'2 . 
(14) 
Since the largest forces result from the smallest scales, we get from (13), (14) for the 
maximal pinning force 
I h \4/<5—rf) 
Ec = F(e*) = g i— J 
a-(i+«0/(6-i) . 
(15) 
This is the result of Feigelman [19], and, without the explicit a-dependence, of Bruins-
ma and Aeppli [15]. 
If we neglect for the moment the fine structure of the potential on the scale a, a 
second pinning force can be made out by the expression 
m 
( h \2/3

( 1 6 ) 
On the scale Q > Q*, F(Q) is smaller than F(Q), whereas for Q = Q*, F(Q*) = F{Q*) 
given in (15). Thus we conclude that (15) is the actual pinning force at T = 0. 
5. Smoothing of Barriers 
Next we consider the influence of thermal fluctuations in (3'). According to the 
Arrhenius law, 
_ 
To 
t(a>)= r e x p — , 
(17) 
the system may overcome an energy barrier co after a time t(a>); t - 1 denotes some 
microscopic attempt frequency. (10), (12), and (17) define two time scales,

For a given scale Q, te 
te for Q* < Q, i.e. the characteristic time scale is determined 
by TE for Q > Q*. (18) and (19) can be inverted, defining two functions Qc and QT, 
respectively,

On a finite time scale t, all barriers with u> <C oj(gt), 
co(gt) are effectively smeared out 
of the potential. Hence, they cannot contribute to the pinning force. Then from (14),

which (if inserted in (26)) has been found previously by Villain [16]. Thus the shortest-
wavelength fluctuations, being decisive for Ec (see (14)), are the first affected by 
thermal fluctuations. The same result is obtained from (16) and (19'), i.e. F(QT) 
= 
= F(Qt). For QT, QT < Q*, Ec is still given by (15). We consider

{ Q * , 
Q T ) ) ' - 1 ~ D ^ 2 , but the present approach seems to be too crude to give the true 
functional dependence in the intermediate region Q* — QT.) R,. has the meaning of a 
critical curvature radius of metastable configurations (see (26)). The cross-over 
between the results of Bruinsma and Aeppli [15] (7T <<: Th(t))

6. Narrow Walls 
If the walls are narrow, the influence of the underlying lattice has to be taken into 
account . This point has been considered already in a previous publication of the author 
in the context of interface roughening [20]. Although we were not able to produce 
strict results, arguments have been given in favour of the assumption that, provided 
we are on a sufficiently large length scale (now we identify a with the lattice spacing, 
i.e. we set a = 1)

, 
the Hamiltonian (4) describes also the interface in the lattice RFIM. The relation to 
the lattice model is established by expressing the stiffness constant g as a function of 
h, T, and J. Such a mapping is well known from the pure Ising model [21]. Depending 
on h, T, and the dimensionality, various cross-overs may occur [20].

where a roughening transition occurs. Increasing temperature lowers g considerably.

(24') 
At low T, for d = 3, the pinning force is ruled by the second term and is exponentially 
small. This seemingly paradoxial result, namely that the lattice decreases the pinning 
force (originating from the random field!), relies on the fact that the lattice tries to 
flatten the interface. This, on its part, means a decrease of possible Zeeman energy 
gain and hence shallower potential minima.2) 
Indeed, for an essentially flat interface, as occurs for d > 5, the total interface 
Zeeman energy is proportional to the square root of the interface area (and not 
proportional to the area as in the present case), whereas the driving force is proportio-
nal to the area. A large interface is therefore always depinned above five dimensions. 
Note, however, that in this discussion we did not consider the pinning force due to the 
underlying lattice. This deserves a separate investigation. 
It is interesting that (24) can be derived alternatively from the following estimate 
basing on a Hamiltonian (4') with the elastic energy replaced by Jo"~2/ [7, 17, 20]:

which are probably valid for d > 2 only for g rg Zd. With w(q*) = a, o>(ot) = T In i/r 
for the minimal length scales q*, gt, and F = o)jQi~1w for the pinning force, we get in 
the same way as in Sections 4 and 5, 
For d = 2 (24") reproduces Ec given by (24). For d -— 3, the second term in (24") 
suggests an exponential dependence on {J/h)2 as in (24'). The cross-over temperature, 
separating the Bruinsma-Aeppli region from the Villain region, becomes now

2) Note, that the results of this Section apply only for q 
where ld ss q* for d < 3 with 
"* given by (13) and (23). For q < ld pinning is ruled by the details of the interface wandering 
mechanism (e.g. peeling) [22].

7. Droplet Evolution 
We consider now the evolution of a spherical antiphase droplet with radius R under 
the influence of a driving force E and a pinning force Ec. The driving force per unit 
area E results from a surface energy term aRd"1 and a bulk Zeeman term —hRdl2 x 
X In1'2 (R/a). The logarithmic factor in the last term arises from exploiting the tails 
of the Gaussian distribution of the Zeeman energy, where we assume a properly 
placed droplet. Then 
j r * = - 
( ^ n B) E<= - 
+ J h R - m ^ 
( £ ) . 
{ 25) 
For d 
2, the last term can be neglected and (25) yields collapsing droplets if the 
initial radius R is smaller than 
R c = ( d - 1 ) £ 
(26) 
with Ec given in (21) or (24). For R > Re droplets remain frozen in their initial state. 
For d = 2, the last two terms in (25) deliver an equilibrium droplet size 
R0=aexp(?-J. 
(27) 
If Ec = 0, droplets with R < R0 shrink to zero, whereas for R 
R0 they grow until 
they collide with neighbouring ones. If the pinning force is finite, the droplet evolution 
stops at radii Re, satisfying 
ECR __ 
/In R/a 
\1'2 
a 
\ln Ra 
where + ( —) refer to K <C ( > ) R0- There is always a solution Rc < R0, and for suffi-
ciently small pinning force, there may be two additional solutions Rc, R~l (Fig. 2). 
For R < Rc, droplets collapse, for Rc < R < R^ and 
< R they are frozen, 
whereas for R^ <C R <C Rt they grow. Note that for Ec -» 0, Rc, Rc -» R0, and R% -— 
—> oo. If the pinning force is sufficiently large, R(. is given by (26), which has to be 
considered as the typical metastable droplet size (and is therefore much smaller than 
the equilibrium size R0). A similar discussion applies to d <C. 2. 
In general, the initial metastable state will include also entangled, branched tubes, 
in addition to finite droplets [16]. In this case R~x represents the mean curvature of 
these animals, which should be identified with the inverse correlation length.

8. Forces and Energies 
One could raise the question, whether one should already identify the critical droplet 
size with gt or g„ respectively, given in (18'), (19'), since barriers on the scale g > nt 
cannot be crossed by thermal excitation. This view ignores, however, the fact that the 
driving forces E lead to a decrease of the potential barriers due to a bias term, 
S^e,;. = -EQ*-->-fx, 
(29) 
in the direction of the driving froce. Thus, one could alternatively derive our results 
from 3€\ = 
+ 8-Xe, a- The approach presented above, which bases on the consi-
deration of forces, seems to be, however, more transparent if approximations are per-
formed. 
9. Relations to Other Work 
Non-equilibrium pinning effects in the RFIM have been considered previously by 
other authors [15, 16, 22], Bruinsma and Aeppli [15] found the critical droplet radius 
Rc given by (15) and (26), although they give no explicit a-dependence. Clearly, our 
paper is mainly inspired by their work. Villain's result for Rc is a combination of (20) 
and (26).3) Actually, Villain [16] substitutes the consideration of forces by that of the 
energy o){q), supplemented by the geometrical condition Rio 
g2. The latter ensures 
that with E ~ g/R, f~w 
(see (29)) 
8 X e ~ 4 Q ^ W 
(30) 
is smaller than the energy barrier oo(q) or, by dividing by od~lw, 
the pinning force is 
larger than the driving one. The latter condition yields the threshold value Rc in our 
approach. 
The third paper, we are aware of, is that of Grinstein and Fernandez [22], who 
consider the RFIM on a lattice, i.e. the case of narrow walls. Their basic results for 
d = 2 are our expressions (18) and (19) for 5 «5 j*, respectively, provided one replaces 
g by J and h via (23). Thus, with (13) and (23), 
e* = ( x ) 2 
(13'> 
which is the cross-over length of Grinstein and Fernandez [22], Similar, from (19) 
and (23), 
h2P 
, 
¿e = T e x P ~j7j, • 
( 3 1) 
The authors claim that t0, te (cf. (18)) give the time scale (or alternatively pt, gt the 
length scale) of a metastable droplet. Our result (24) for the critical radius Rc > g* 
deviates from their expression substantially at low temperatures (see also footnote2)). 
10. Vacancy Pinning 
In diluted antiferromagnets, there is an additional wall pinning due to the site dilu-
tion [23]. The importance of pinning at vacancies has been shown also in a numerical 
simulation [24], A little reflection yields that this pinning is described by an additional

in the interface Hamiltonian (4). The interaction between the domain wall and the 
vacancies occurs only inside the wall. u(r, z) — uv §n(r, z) with 8n(r, z) = 0. Here uv 
and 8n(r, z) denote the interaction energy between the wall and the vacancy and the 
fluctuation in the vacancy concentration, respectively. Changing to the wave-packet 
description, we get for the additional part, corresponding to (32), in (4'),

Here u = uv (8m,2)1/2 — uynwhere 
nv denotes the vacancy concentration. vx(z) is the 
normalized residual part of 8n(r, z). For simplicity, we use (6) also for the v^(z) corre-
lations, which are assumed to be Gaussian, and put £ ^ a. 
We consider now the properties of the Hamiltonian (4') where the Zeeman term is 
replaced by 8X U, a (33). The calculation proceeds as described in Sections 2 to 4. Using 
the notation introduced there, we reproduce the results for w (9), <x> (10), q* (13), 
F (14), te, o(t) (18), and Ec (21), if h is replaced by u in all expressions. Deviations arise 
for the low-energy states, which are characterized by

In (34) we omitted logarithmic corrections. Further F(q*) 
= F(q*), 
but F(ot) 
F(ot). 
The final result for the pinning force is (21), with h replaced by u. For diluted anti-
ferromagnets in an external field, the total pinning force is expected to be the sum 
Ec ^ Ec(h) + Ec{u). 
Since h — H n u 
— Jn^2, 
where II is the magnitude of the 
external field and J the exchange constant, we expect Ec(u) 
Ec(h) for small H. 
11. Discussion 
The present paper is an attempt to unify previous approaches [15, 16] studying pinning 
thresholds and critical droplet radii in the RFIM. The main results of the paper are 
contained in (21), (22), (24), and (22'), and their corresponding extensions to vacancy 
pinning (see Section 10). 
Experimentally, one finds in three dimensions and at low temperatures for the 
exponent vH defined in (2) values in the range 2.1 to 3.6 [13, 14]. Their theoretical 
counterparts are (i) for broad walls vH = 2 (and for the time-dependent factor r(t) ~ 
— T In i/r), whereas (ii) for narrow walls we get vH —> oo (i.e. an exponential /¿-depend-
ence and r(t) essentially constant). The experimental values can be explained possibly 
as a case intermediate between (i) and (ii). 
Our theory is only applicable at small fields. At non-zero temperature and increas-
ing field strength, spins inside of clusters start to flip which leads to a stronger decrease 
of Rc with h (and hence to a larger vH) than predicted by our theory, which takes into 
account only wall motion.

The conditions are studied to be satisfied in order to use a iV-pole truncation to the continued-
fraction expansion. The correct way is shown to do the cut off and the result are applied to analyse 
experimental data for the unidimensional antiferromagnetic TMMC at low temperatures. 
Es werden die Bedingungen untersucht, die erfüllt sein müssen, um einen A?-Pol-Abbruch der Ent-
wicklung nach kontinuierlichen Brücken zu nutzen. Es wird der korrekte Weg für das Abschneiden 
sowie die Anwendung der Ergebnisse auf die Analyse experimenteller Daten für den eindimen-
sionalen Antiferromagnet TMMC bei niedrigen Temperaturen gezeigt. 
1. Introduction 
One of the most useful formalisms in the study of the dynamics of a magnetic system 
is the continued fraction expansion proposed by Mori [1] where the relaxation func-
tion can be expressed in terms of static correlation functions. The relaxation function 
F(q, co) which is of paramount importance in the interpretation of neutron scattering 
or magnetic resonance experiments is defined by

where <x = x, y, z and H is the Hamiltonian of the system. 
Mori's formalism expresses the Laplace transform of the time-dependent relaxation 
function

with /0(z) = iplq, z), and where the coefficients d are directly expressible in terms of 
the moments (o>n) of F(q, co) [2]. The relaxation function F(q, co) is then given by 
F(q, co) = — Re y(q, z = ico) .
