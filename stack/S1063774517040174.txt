Abstract—Definitions are given, based on which algorithms have been developed for constructing computer
models of two-dimensional quasilattices and the corresponding quasiperiodic tilings in plane, the point sym-
metry groups of which are dihedral groups Dm (m = 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 18), and the translation subgroups
are free Abelian groups of the fourth or sixth rank. The angles at the tile vertices in the constructed tilings are
calculated.

INTRODUCTION
According to the definition given by the Commis-
sion on Aperiodic Crystals of the International Union
of Crystallographers, a crystal is any solid having an
essentially discrete diffraction diagram. Quasicrystals
are solids that are characterized by a symmetry forbid-
den in classical crystallography and the presence of
long-range order and have at the same time a discrete
diffraction pattern. It follows from these definitions
that quasicrystals form a subclass of the class of crys-
tals. The crystals having rotational symmetry axes of
only the first, second, third, fourth, or sixth orders
form another subclass. Quasicrystals may also have
forbidden symmetry axes, for example, the fivefold
axis. The long-range order characterizing quasicrys-
tals differs from the long-range order the “conven-
tional” crystals possess. Since there are different types
of long-range order, we define below this charac-
teristic.
Definition 1. A crystal structure in space has a long-
range order if, independent of the location of some
point in space, there is an algorithm making it possible
to determine (with a finite number of steps) if a crystal
structure element (atom, molecule) is located or is not
located at this point.
From the group-theoretical point of view, the pres-
ence of long-range order indicates that the symmetry
group of crystal should contain an infinite subgroup,
which acts in space and determines this order. In the
case of conventional crystals, this subgroup is a sub-
group of parallel translations, which is a free Abelian
group with a rank (i.e., the maximum number of inde-
pendent elements) equal to the space dimension. The
lattice in an n-dimensional space is defined as a set of
points with integer affine coordinates. In other words,
a lattice in n-dimensional space is a free Abelian group
of rank n. In the case of physical Euclidean space Еn
(n = 2, 3), a lattice cannot have rotational axes of five-
fold symmetry and symmetries of order higher than
six. However, quasicrystals have some of the afore-
mentioned axes. Therefore, depending on the type of
the infinite subgroup the crystal symmetry group pos-
sess, a particular theory of quasicrystals will work.
Several such theories have been developed to date.
Two theories (the equivalence of which, as far as we
know, has not been proven) are most popular.
The first theory, developed by S.P. Novikov and his
student [1], is based on the statement that an infinite
subgroup providing long-range order is a quasilattice,
i.e., a free Abelian group whose rank exceeds the space
dimension. In 1986, Novikov proposed the following
definition: a subgroup G of the group Еn of all motions
of n-dimensional Euclidean space Еn is an n-dimen-
sional quasicrystallographic group (in the sense of
Novikov) if its intersection with the subgroup Rn ⊂ Еn
of all translations is some quasilattice Т ⊂ Rn.
The second theory, developed by Artamonov and
his students, considers quasicrystals as projections of
multidimensional crystals [2]. Levitov [3] was one of
the first researchers who proposed this model. How-
ever, only in 1998, Moody [4] proposed a model of
quasicrystal, which was referred to as the “cut-and-
project model.” Within this model, a radically new
approach to determining symmetry groups for quasic-
rystals was proposed in [5]. Study [6] should be men-
tioned, where a complete description of finite symme-
try groups in the cut-and-project model for three-
dimensional quasicrystals is given on the assumption
that the phase space dimension is no higher than
three. Note that the concept of the symmetry of crys-
tals as motions retaining distances has changed. Qua-
sicrystals are known to possess scale invariance, which

implies the following: the diffraction pattern of a qua-
sicrystal can be obtained by single or multiple increase
(decrease) in its central part (inflation–deflation the-
ory). Therefore, another theory of quasicrystals can be
proposed based on the concept of affine crystallo-
graphic group.
Definition 2 (Artamonov [2]). A subgroup Г in the
group Aff(V) of all affine transformations of real space
V is referred to as the affine crystallographic group if,
for each compact set D in V, the set of all such elements
γ ∈ Г that γ(D) ∩ D is not empty is finite (property of
complete discontinuity), there is such a compact set К0
in V that V = 
.
This definition is a generalization of the definition
of conventional crystallographic group. A particular
case of affine crystallographic group is the so-called
similarity symmetry group, introduced by Shubnikov
in 1960 [7]. An accurate definition of this group was
given by Zamorzaev [8]. It was shown in [9, 10] that
quasicrystals have a similarity symmetry group. This
theory is apparently equivalent to the theory in
which quasicrystals are considered as crystals of
Lobachevsky geometry (in Lobachevsky geometry, in
contrast to Euclidean geometry, similarity transfor-
mation are motions, i.e., they retain distance). It was
suggested for the first time in [11, 12] that quasicrystals
can be considered as crystals of Lobachevsky geome-
try. A tiling of Lobachevsky space Н3 into regular pen-
tagonal dodecahedra is known. The regular pentago-
nal dodecahedron is a fundamental domain of the
crystallographic group of motions of geometry Н3, and
the “hyperbolic space of dodecahedron” is formed as
a result of factorization of space Н3 with respect to the
subgroup of finite index, specifically, with respect to
the subgroup of index 120 in the tiling symmetry
group. This space was obtained in [13].
Let us present some important definitions from [1].
A group of orthogonal parts R = G/T is referred to as a
point group of quasicrystallographic group G, and the
quasilattice T ⊂ G will be referred to as a subgroup of
translations of quasicrystallographic group G. As was
noted in [1], quasicrystallographic groups are not dis-
crete groups of motions, because their subgroups of
translations are dense everywhere in space Rn. There-
fore, these groups cannot be interpreted as groups of
Euclidean space tilings, because the latter are always
discrete. Correct understanding of these groups in
terms of mathematics implies that they are subgroups
of Euclidean space motion groups, transforming
themselves into some quasilattice. It was suggested
in [1] that quasicrystallographic groups are imple-
mented as symmetry groups of quadratic quasilattice,
i.e., lattices whose rank is twice as large as the space
dimension. Let us show that a free Abelian group of
arbitrary rank exists in Euclidean plane Е2. This group
is a set of integer linear combinations of nth-order
roots of unity, which satisfy the equation xn – 1 = 0. It

follows from the vector addition rule (according to the
polygon rule) that the sum of all nth-order roots of
unity is zero, i.e., all nth-order roots of unity, consid-
ered as vectors of complex space, form an integer lin-
early dependent system of vectors. Therefore, this sys-
tem contains an integer linearly independent subsys-
tem of vectors. These vectors are roots of irreducible
(over the field of rational numbers) polynomial of
power ϕ(n) (ϕ(n) is the Euler function). The following
theorem was proven in [1]: an angle α can be a rotation
angle in some quasicrystallographic group G if and
only if z = exp(iα) is an algebraic integer. Recall that
an algebraic integer of power n is a root of a polyno-
mial irreducible over the field of rational numbers Q,
whose power is n and whose coefficients are integers
(the senior coefficient is equal to unity). A classifica-
tion of allowable rotation angles was given in [1] for a
quadratic quasilattice. The same result can be
obtained by classifying the generalized systems of sec-
ond-order roots introduced in [14]. Instead of the
integer linear combinations of four vectors, one can
consider linear combinations of two vectors—simple
roots of the generalized system of roots. The coeffi-
cients of this combination are algebraic integers of the
quadratic expansion of the field of rational numbers Q.
Note that the point groups of a two-dimensional qua-
sicrystallographic group with a quadratic quasilattice
can be dihedral groups Dm (m = 5, 8, 10, 12), as well as
subgroups of these groups Сm (m = 5, 8, 10, 12), i.e.,
rotations.
Axial quasicrystals of dodecagonal type (twelvefold
rotational symmetry axis) were obtained in [15] by
molecular dynamics simulation in the model of pure
aluminum; they turned out to be periodic in one
direction and quasiperiodic in the other two direc-
tions, which served an impetus for studies in this field.
In this study, we constructed original computer
models of atomic structure of two-dimensional quas-
icrystals, i.e., quasilattices with rotational symmetry
axes that are forbidden in classical crystallography.
Electron diffraction patterns of three-dimensional
quasicrystals may have this isostructural form.
ALGORITHMS FOR CONSTRUCTING 
QUASILATTICES
The matrix–vector technique was used to derive
equations within the Novikov theory, which make it
possible to calculate directly the coordinates of atoms
in quasilattices with the symmetry axes 5, 7, 8, 9, 10,
12, 14, and 18 and depict them in the complex plane C.
The term “atom” implies a sphere whose center coin-
cides with an element from the crystal set. With the aid
of algebraic integers 
, 
, and
 (ρ for a quasilattice with the symmetry axis
8, τ for the axes 5 and 10, and η for the axis 12), some
of the equations can be presented in a compact form:

where nі belongs to the ring of integers Z.
Connecting each atom by segments with atoms
from the first, second, and (in some cases) third coor-
dination spheres (circumferences), we obtain a qua-
siperiodic tiling of this plane into tiles, corresponding
to the specific quasilattice. Then tiles of different types
are differently colored.
Algebraic integers ρ, τ, and η are referred to as
metallic means in the literature: silver, golden, and
bronze means, respectively. They are also known as
Pisot numbers. Integers ρ, τ, and η are the roots of the
square equations х2 – 2х – 1 = 0, х2 – х – 1 = 0, and
х2 – 2х – 2 = 0, respectively. Note that each of the
integers ρ, τ, and η is a forming element of infinite
cyclic group: (τ)∞ = {…, τ0 = 1, τ1 = τ, τ2 = τ + 1, τ3 =
2τ + 1, τ4 = 3τ + 2, τ5 = 5τ + 3, τ6 = 8τ + 5, …}, (ρ)∞=
{…, ρ0 = 1, ρ1 = ρ, ρ2 = 2ρ + 1, ρ3 = 5ρ + 2, ρ4 = 12ρ + 5,
ρ5 = 29ρ + 12, ρ6 = 70ρ + 29, …}, and  (η)∞ =
{…, η0 = 1, η1 = η, η2 = 2η + 2, η3 = 6η + 4, η4 =
16η + 12, η5 = 44η + 32, η6 = 120η + 88, …}. Note
also that the coefficients at τ and unity in the expres-
sions for nonnegative powers of τ in the group (τ)∞ are
the numbers from the Fibonacci sequence (0, 1, 1, 2,
3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, …). By analogy, let us write the
first elements from the Pell sequence (0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29,
70, 169, 408, 985, …) and the sequence (0, 1, 2, 6, 16,
44, 120, 328, 896, 2448, …); the latter two sequences

An algorithm for constructing quasilattices and
corresponding tilings in plane, the symmetry groups of
which are quasicrystallographic groups, was devel-
oped within the complex approximation according to
the Novikov theory.
COMPUTER MODELS OF QUASILATTICES
Theorem 4.3 [6] describes the finite symmetry
groups in the cut-and-project model for a quasicrystal
in the case where the dimensions of the phase and
physical spaces are two and three. The groups indi-
cated in this theorem include those described within
the Novikov theory. Below we will consider the com-
puter realizations of some of these groups.
Figure 1 shows different crystal sets (obtained using
the system of equations (3)) with twelvefold rotational
symmetry axis, the point symmetry group of these sets
is D12. A fragment of tiling of plane by five geometric
figures (tiles of blocks) is presented in Fig. 1b. The
interior angles in the ditrigon (semiregular hexagon),
90° and 150°, coincide with the angles in the semireg-
ular octagon. The angle of 150° coincides with the
interior angle in the dodecagon (whose center has a
singularity). The sum of the trigon interior angle and
tetragon angle is also equal to 150°.
Note that the set of points shown in Fig. 1a (and
hereinafter in the text) should not be considered as a
crystal set of Euclidean geometry, because this set is
dense everywhere in plane. However, if this set is con-
sidered in Poincare models of Lobachevsky geometry,
it is a crystal set of this geometry. In particular, since
the similarity transformations are motions of the
Lobachevsky geometry, one can pass, using homo-
thety (with a homothety coefficient k > 1), from the
Fig. 1. Crystal sets having twelvefold rotational symmetry axis: (a) general view and (b) a fragment of tiling of Euclidean plane by
five geometric figures (tiling tiles, selected by segments): dodecagon, equilateral triangle (trigon), square (tetragon), ditrigon, and
semiregular octagon (the latter is elongated along the symmetry axis passing through the center and two opposite vertices).

pattern in which the set of points is dense everywhere
to a discrete pattern and consider the corresponding
tilings.
The crystal sets presented in Fig. 2 were calculated
using the system of equations (1). The number of dif-
ferent tiles in the quasiperiodic tiling shown in Fig. 2b
is five. The triangle vertex angles are 45°, 67.5°, and
67.5°. The vertex angles of semiregular hexagon
(which is elongated along the axis passing through the
center and two opposite vertices) are 90° and 135°.
The octagon and tetragon vertex angles are, respec-
tively, 135° and 90°. Eight triangles converge to the
singularity (tiling center); the bases of these triangles
form an octagon. Therefore, the first coordination
number of the singularity is 8. For the other atoms in
the tiling presented in Fig. 2b, the first coordination
numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8.
Figure 3 shows quasiperiodic tilings of Euclidean
plane (the system of equations (2)), having symmetry
axes 5 and 10, with identical numbers of tiles. In other
words, the same specific set of tiles can be used to per-
form tilings in plane with different symmetries (note
that, if a tiling has ten axes, it automatically has five
axes). The number of different tiles in tiling is five;
they include a triangle (with angles of 36°, 72°, and
72°), Penrose rhomb (with angles of 72° and 108°), a
trapezoid (with angles of 72° and 108°), and two simi-
lar pentagons (with a similarity coefficient τ). The
pentagon vertex angle is 108°.
Real quasicrystals with the rotational symmetry
axes 7 and 14 are likely to exist, because the rank of the
free Abelian group is six in this case. Number 6 is a
value of the Euler function ϕ(n), equal to the number
of natural numbers smaller than n and coprime with n.
Along with the rotational axes 7 and 14, there may be
the axes 9 and 18, because ϕ(7) = ϕ(9) = ϕ(14) =
ϕ(18) = 6.
Figure 4a shows a crystal set having a fourteen-fold
rotational symmetry axis, on which tetradecagons and
similar heptagons are separately selected by segments.
Another advantage of constructing quasilattices
with the aid of complex numbers is that different pro-
jective transformations can be performed in this case;
one of them is mapping to the Riemann sphere:  =
С ∪ {∞}. The corresponding map was obtained using

mann sphere has two singularities, corresponding to
the northern (infinitely distant point) and southern
poles. Since the crystal set (Fig. 4b) mapped to the
Riemann sphere (Fig. 4c) is finite, there is no element
in the northern pole. By analogy with the quasiperi-
odic tilings of plane, corresponding tilings of the Rie-
mann sphere were performed. Conformal mapping of
complex numbers to the Riemann sphere is applied to
construct quasicrystals in the Poincare models of
Lobachevsky space Н2. The residue theory was used to
develop algorithms for expanding any crystal set with
the symmetry group Dm (at even m) in subsets, having,
in particular, rotational axes of the m/2 order.
It follows from the fundamental theorem of crys-
tallography that one cannot implement face-to-face
(without gaps and overlaps) tiling of plane by e.g.,
identical pentagons. However, a tiling of this kind can
be performed with gaps and (or) overlaps. Figure 5
shows a fragment of a crystal set on which two octa-
decagons are selected by segments. The intersection of
these octadecagons is a rhomb with vertex angles of
160° and 20°.
CONCLUSIONS
Algorithms were developed within the Novikov
theory, which make it possible to calculate the posi-
tions of atoms in the quasilattices whose point groups
are dihedral groups Dm and to perform the corre-
sponding quasiperiodic tilings in plane, including
Fig. 4. (a, b) Crystal sets with point symmetry group D14 and (c) a map of crystal set (b) to the Riemann sphere (in two view-
points).

Penrose-type tilings, for specific quasilattices. These
algorithms do not require introduction of any local
self-assembly rules. Electron diffraction patterns
obtained from real quasicrystals may have a similar
isostructural form of model quasilattices.
Since atoms (of different types) can be located at
each vertex of quasiperiodic tiling of plane, the interior
angles of the tiles converging at these vertices corre-
spond to the angles made by the bonds between the
specific atoms and the atoms from the first coordina-
tion spheres. These angles characterize some bond
angles of the aforementioned atoms, with allowance
for the corresponding electron-shell hybridization.
The data reported in this paper can be useful when
choosing alloy components and calculating their con-
centrations in order to form quasicrystals of certain
types.
The developed algorithms make it possible to
obtain (using the concept of action of a group) mate-
rials having the symmetry of this group.
