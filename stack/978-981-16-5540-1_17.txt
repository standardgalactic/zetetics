Abstract
To provide diagnosis and therapy for dysfunction in the nervous system, var-
ious biomaterials and/or medical devices serve as platforms to communicate
with the system and regulate dysfunctional neuronal circuits. Recent advances
in nanotechnology enable the construction of nanostructured platforms with
ultrasmall feature size and superior material property at the nanoscale, targeted
at interfacing with the nervous system seamlessly. The chapter provides an
overview of nanostructured neural platforms and introduces three main kinds of
platforms: nanoelectronics, nanoﬁbers, and nanoparticles. The potential neural
applications of the nanostructured platforms are discussed, including neural
recording, neural modulation, neural regeneration, and imaging. The interactions
between the platforms and the neural cells in vitro and in vivo are also brieﬂy
reviewed. The chapter ends with a discussion on existing barriers to clinical
translation and future research directions of the platforms.

Introduction
As one of the most important systems in the body, the nervous system supports
the functioning of different organs in the body. It reacts to external stimuli and
modulates internal activity [1]. Injuries and diseases in the nervous system may
lead to a loss of control and body functions, including sensation, movement, vision,

and emotion [2]. Typical examples of nervous system diseases and injuries as well
as their causes and symptoms are shown in Table 1. Nearly 800 billion dollars
are spent treating neurological diseases in the United States per year [3], and the
patients suffer from disability for more than 28% of the years in their lives [4]. Due
to the serious consequences and especially hopeless self-recovery from damage in
the central nervous system [5], it is crucial to employ biomaterials and/or medical
devices that are able to code information from the neural signals for diagnosis
and to deliver stimulation for therapy. Nanostructured materials, owing to their
ultrasmall size and their speciﬁc material property at the nanoscale, emerged as
promising candidates to interface with the nervous system for diagnosis and therapy
of nervous system diseases and injuries. The following sections introduce three
kinds of nanostructured platforms and their neural applications: nanoelectronics,
nanoﬁbers, and nanoparticles.

Nanoelectronics
During the past decades, neural devices have been developed as promising interface
technology for nervous system injuries and diseases. Typical examples of the
neural interface include cochlear [10] and retinal implants [11], motor and sensory

interfaces for neuroprosthesis [12], and cortical subdural [13] and deep brain stim-
ulation [14]. Most of the noninvasive neural interfaces enable harmless interfacing
on patients, but the signals they obtain and/or deliver are limited. Higher levels
of functions such as artiﬁcial vision [11] require higher-quality signal recording
and/or delivery, which need to be realized through an implantable neural interface.
The recent advances in nanotechnology open the possibility of using nanostructured
materials to improve the performance of the neural interface.
2.1
Nanostructured Electrode Coating
Traditionally, the electrode site of the neural electrode is made of noble metals
such as gold (Au) [15], platinum (Pt) [16], and iridium (Ir) [17], as they have
excellent electrical conductivity and chemical stability. However, there is a signif-
icant mismatch between the metallic electrode and the resident tissue in electrical,
mechanical, and biological properties, which is a huge hurdle to achieve satisfactory
signal delivery [18], signal detection [19], and least tissue response [20] at the
electrode-tissue interface. The interaction between the native neural tissue and the
electrode site plays an important role in the performance of the neural device as
the signal delivery and/or recording is conducted through the electrode site [21]. To
bridge the difference at the electrode site-tissue interface, coating, an intermediate
layer, is applied to functionalize the electrode site. Owing to the high surface-
to-volume ratio, nanostructured materials emerge as coating materials with high
potential for the neural electrode. The larger surface area of the nanostructure would
provide more reaction sites for neuronal contact and signal transmission [22–25].
Electrodeposition is a common technique for formation of a coating on the neural
electrode. Various nanostructures were formed on conducting polymer (CP) coating
during electrodeposition with the assistance of templates and surfactants. Three-
dimensionally nanoporous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) coating was
realized when using nanosized polystyrene latex spheres as a template (Fig. 1a).
An electrode coated with the coating showed signiﬁcantly better performance
in impedance spectroscopy than an uncoated electrode over the whole range of
frequencies [25, 26]. The impedance of the electrode decreased most sharply by
more than 80 times with a pore size of around 300 nm, while that without the
nanostructure only decreased by 10 times. To further increase the surface area,
elongated structures like nanoﬁbrils were developed by using a surfactant and the
ordered nanoﬁbrils were proved to beneﬁt the improvement of electrical property
[27]. In addition to using nanopores and nanoﬁbrils, nanotubes were also employed
as a considerable structure of CP coating as their hollow structures provide nearly
double the surface area of a solid structure (Fig. 1b). The PEDOT nanotube coating
signiﬁcantly reduced the 1-kHz impedance of the electrode by 200 times and
beneﬁted cell attachment [24, 28, 29]. With this CP nanotube coating, double highly
effective recording sites were obtained for both in vitro and in vivo studies.
With superior electrical and mechanical properties [30–32], nanostructured
carbon materials such as carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene show promising

applications in functionalization of the neural electrode. CNT has been widely
studied as neural electrode coating, while the study of graphene has emerged as
a new trend in recent years [33, 34]. The application of the nanocarbon coating
markedly boosts the performance of the neural electrode. The employment of
the CNT coating on the Pt electrode reduced the threshold voltage for neuronal
excitation by 86% in vivo [35]. The CNT-coated electrode was found to elicit
stronger cell response as compared to tungsten wire and the Pt electrode with
the same stimulation current in vitro [36]. For recording, CNT-coated electrode
showed a signiﬁcant increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than six
times in vivo as compared to the bare electrode [35, 37, 38]. Noticeably, low-
frequency signals like local ﬁeld potential and small amplitude spiking signals
which are less than 20 μV were clearly detected in vitro [39]. A 1-year in vivo
recording study in nonhuman primates proved the great potential of the CNT
coating for chronic implantable application [38]. Monolayer graphene coated on
the neural electrode enabled chronic recording of single unit activity on mouse
motor cortex, while the bare electrode failed to do that [40]. Moreover, the
graphene coating exhibited high neural afﬁnity and reduced coverage of astrocyte

and microglia around the implanted electrode. The combination of nanocarbons
with photosensitive nanomaterials was able to achieve both electrical and optical
modulation of neural activity [41, 42]. The liquid crystal graphene oxide (GO)-gold
nanorods composite presented photoactivity at the near-infrared (NIR) range [41].
The employment of the cadmium selenide/cadmium sulﬁde/CNT coating enabled
wire-free stimulation of blind retinas with violet light (Fig. 1c) [42].
Neural cells showed different interactions with different nanostructured coatings.
Neurons cultured on a nanotunnel coating made of PEDOT-CNT composite con-
formed to the shape of the underlying structure and showed signiﬁcantly improved
neurite length compared to those on a non-nanotunnel structure (Fig. 2a) [43].
Neurons cultured on polymer nanopillars tightly contacted the tip of the pillars by
largely spreading on the top, which would allow intimate communication between
the cell and the device (Fig. 2b) [44]. The protruding nanopillars did not show
a negative effect on the normal synapse formation and neuronal functionality of
the cell. Nanoporous Au coating inhibited coverage of astrocytes and resulted in a
twofold neuron/astrocyte coverage ratio compared to planar Au coating (Fig. 2c)
[45]. The study showed that the nanoporous Au coating with different feature
sizes (30 nm and 170 nm) controlled astrocyte spreading by different mechanisms
including focal adhesion formation and other mechanotransduction mechanisms.
2.2
Nanopatterned Electrode
Although the currently developed neural electrode has good performance on
neural stimulating and recording, degradation of the performance during chronic
implantation and limited selectivity remain challenges due to the tissue response
induced by the hard microelectrode and large size of the single electrode site [46].
This translates to a push towards miniaturization of the neural electrode into the
nanoscale. The electrode at the nanoscale has a similar dimension to individual cells
and cell subunits, which would enable local communication with neurons and more
accurate monitoring of multimodal signals experienced by cellular subunits. The
reduction of the electrode size also beneﬁts the integration of the electrode with the
surrounding tissue. The softness and ﬂexibility of a rigid electrode can be improved
when its feature size reaches the nanoscale [47], which would reduce the mechanical
mismatch between the device and the native tissue and thus mitigate the immune
reaction.
With the development of electron beam and optical lithography techniques,
the thickness of the electrode site could be patterned as small as several hundred
nanometers (Fig. 3a) [48, 49]. The nanoelectronic probe showed ultralow bending
stiffness and probe-tissue interfacial force at the nanonewton range. The in vivo
neural recording performance of the nanoelectronic probe was superior and stable,
demonstrated by high SNR (>10) and low noise level (<10 μV) throughout a
4-month implantation. Moreover, few tissue responses were found around the probe,
and normal capillary perfusion was observed without the blood-brain barrier leakage
common in conventional microelectrodes. The stretchability and transparency of the

electrode were also improved by employment of the nanomaterial as a conductive
track (Fig. 3b) [50, 51]. The neural electrode with Ag/Au core-shell nanowires
as a conductive track showed high transparency of around 80% and stretchability
at a strain value of 60%. The electrode was able to conduct reliable recording
of somatosensory evoked cortical signals in rodents and optogenetically evoked
cortical signals in nonhuman primates. No cytotoxicity and low inﬂammatory
response were observed around the electrode, which indicated good biocompatibil-
ity. One additional beneﬁt of the transparent electrodes is the ability to combine
electrical stimulation with spatiotemporal imaging of neural responses (Fig. 3c)
[51]. The connection pad of the neural electrode also can be patterned with a
nanoscale thickness (Fig. 3d) [52]. The nanoscale input/output pad exhibited high
ﬂexibility and tight contact with standard interface cables, which enabled stable
monitoring of single unit neural activity over at least 2 months without a loss of
channel recording.

Neural probes made of nanomaterials such as CNTs (Fig. 4a) also showed
promising performance in neural recording and stimulating. Owing to the superior
mechanical property of CNT, the CNT yarn electrode exhibited lower stiffness than
a Pt-Ir electrode at the same size and allowed adjustment of the implant depth in
vivo [53, 54]. Lower inﬂammation was observed during chronic implantation when
compared to a Pt-Ir electrode (Fig. 4b) [53–55]. The CNT yarn was able to deliver
deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease as effectively as
much larger a Pt-Ir electrode [53]. Neural recordings from a rat cortex and tibial
nerve were also realized with high selectivity (Fig. 4c) [53, 54, 56]. Moreover, the
CNT yarn exhibited good compatibility with magnetic resonance imaging with few
artifacts and noise (Fig. 4d) [54, 55].
Nanostructured materials also ﬁnd promising applications in the preparation
of ﬁeld-effect transistors (FET) for neural applications. Carriers in the FET with
nanoscale channels allowed easier depletion or modulation of neural signals and
higher sensitivity compared to that in bulk [47]. FET prepared by silicon nanowire
modiﬁed with speciﬁc DNA aptamers showed a high sensitivity for detecting the
concentrations of potassium inside and outside the neurons and their change under
different stimulations (Fig. 5a) [57]. Flexible graphene solution-gated FET (Fig. 5b)
exhibited high ﬁeld-effect mobility of 863cm2/V/s, enabling recording of spon-
taneous slow-wave activity, visual and auditory evoked signals, and synchronous
activity in a rat model of epilepsy [58]. Recently developed nanoscale FET based
on SiO2 nanotubes achieved the recording of intracellular transmembrane potential
from cardiomyocyte cells, which may encourage possible application to neural
recording [59, 60].

Nanoﬁbers
Nanoﬁbers are ﬁbers whose diameters are on a scale of nanometers. There are
many well-established techniques for preparation of nanoﬁbers, such as electrospin-
ning, melt spinning, self-assembly, phase separation, and nanolithography [61–63].
Among them, electrospinning is one of the most feasible and efﬁcient methods
[61]. By employing the electrical ﬁeld, the electrospinning technique draws polymer
ﬁlaments with diameters in the nanometer range [64]. Electrospinning allows wide
applicability for different materials including natural polymers, synthetic polymers,

and their composite with other materials like carbons and metals. The highly
controlled parameters in the fabrication process afford the electrospun nanoﬁber
scalability and tunable material properties such as Young’s modulus and porosity
[65]. Additionally, different architectures, including core-shell, porous, and hollow
structure, can be achieved inside electrospun nanoﬁbers [63]. By using different
collectors, the nanoﬁbers can be randomly distributed (Fig. 6a), uniaxially aligned
patterned (Fig. 6b) [66], or even radially aligned patterned (Fig. 6c) [67, 68]. The
nanoﬁbers can be further functionalized with other components such as drugs and
catalysts to be tailored for speciﬁc applications.
Due to the network-like nanoﬁbrous structure, which is similar to the extracellu-
lar matrix (ECM), electrospun nanoﬁbers were explored to support and guide cell
growth, which opened the possibility of using them as tissue-engineered scaffolds
for neural regeneration. The damage and loss of parts of or whole neural tissues
caused by diseases and injuries are severe issues in the nervous system. Although the
body exhibits functional self-healing after injury, the regeneration is quite limited
for those with large tissue loss or low self-recovery ability [69]. Transplantation
of autograft is a preferred strategy to replace the damaged tissue, but the lack of
matched autologous neural tissue and immune rejection remain serious problems
[70]. Thus, tissue-engineered neural graft, encouraging repairment of previously
irreparable tissues with the body’s own potential, emerged as a promising strategy
[71]. Nanoﬁbers possess great superiority as neural tissue-engineered scaffolds
since they can provide (1) ECM-like structural support for cell growth, (2) a large
surface area for biomolecules attachment and cell interaction, and (3) high porosity
for cell migration and substance transport.
The potential of nanoﬁbers as a neural tissue-engineered scaffold was ﬁrst eval-
uated through the neural cell’s interaction with nanoﬁbers in vitro. Primary neurons
extended long neurites following the direction of aligned nanoﬁbers, which indi-
cated intimate attachment and interaction with the nanoﬁbers [72]. Schwann cells
(SCs) cultured on GO/silk ﬁbroin/poly(L-lactic acid-co-caprolactone) nanoﬁbers
spread well and exhibited a tendency of myelination with the secretion of nerve
growth factor [73]. When applying nanoﬁbrous scaffold on a rat injured spinal cord
slice, neurons and glial cells showed migration from the organotypic slice onto the
scaffolds (Fig. 7a) [74].
The capacity to support stem cells/progenitor cells is an important criterion for
a tissue-engineered scaffold as stem cells/progenitor cells loaded on the scaffolds
can proliferate rapidly and differentiate into speciﬁc neural cells to accelerate the
regeneration [75]. Nanoﬁbrous scaffold showed the ability to support the adhesion,
proliferation, migration, and differentiation of various stem cells/progenitor cells,

including neural stem cells (NSCs) [76–78], embryonic stem cells (ESCs) [66,
79, 80], neural progenitor cells (NPCs) [81], bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs),
neuroblastoma cells [82], SH-SY5Y cells [83], and human-induced pluripotent stem
cells [74] in vitro. Inducing the differentiation of stem cells/progenitor cells into
neurons is an important research direction. Silk nanoﬁbers were able to promote
the proliferation of the SH-SY5Y cells and their differentiation into neurons with
elongated neurites [83]. The addition of reduced GO further guided the neuronal
differentiation of the SH-SY5Y cells [83]. An earlier differentiation progression of
ESCs was observed on nanoﬁbers compared to the ﬂat substrate [79]. Silk nanoﬁbers
showed promotion of the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons
and inhibition of their differentiation into astrocytes compared to coverslips [81].
The incorporation of conductive materials such as PEDOT and GO allowed the
preparation of conductive nanoﬁbers and a combination of electrical stimulation

for enhancing neurite outgrowth [78, 84, 85]. In addition to neurons, some glial
cells such as SCs play an important role in neural regeneration. The differentiation
of BMSC into SCs was realized on nanoﬁbers. The derived cells had a high
viability of 90% and kept proliferating over time [86]. SCs derived on the nanoﬁbers
showed fourfold enhancement in nerve growth factor gene expression compared to
those derived on tissue culture plastic. The combination of the aligned nanoﬁbrous
structure and the neurotrophic effect of the derived SCs signiﬁcantly increased
the outgrowth of neurites in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, reaching an
impressive neurite growth rate of 566 μm per day (Fig. 7b). Formation of an in
situ microtissue-like structure was observed on an in vitro culture of bone marrow-
derived mesenchymal stem cells with nanoﬁbers [80].
Due to the high ﬂexibility in the fabrication process of the electrospun nanoﬁbers,
the nanoﬁber could be functionalized with different biomolecules and drugs to

improve the interaction with neural cells and stem/progenitor cells. Nanoﬁbers
coated with laminin displayed a twofold increase in BDNF expression from derived
SCs compared to bare nanoﬁbers [86]. Peptide RGD coated on nanoﬁbers upregu-
lated differentiation of ESC into glial cells including astrocyte and oligodendrocyte
[66], while peptide GYIGSR coated on nanoﬁbers inhibited this trend [79]. The
functionalization with siRNA targeting Re-1silencing transcription factor enhanced
the differentiation of NPC into neurons by nearly three times [74]. Controlled
release of biomolecules and drugs can be achieved through manipulating the

structure and pattern of nanoﬁbers. Core-shell nanoﬁbers with triiodothyronine and
retinoic acid loaded in the shell and core layer, respectively, induced much earlier
neuronal differentiation of neuroblastoma cells through time-phased regulation of
cell behaviors [82]. The employment of radially aligned nanoﬁbers enabled the
gradient release of stromal cell-derived factor-1α and thus directed the migration
of NSC from the periphery to the center of the scaffold, which exhibited great
potentials in repairing injured spinal cords and nerves [68].
The capacity of nanoﬁbers as a neural tissue-engineered scaffold was further
investigated through in vivo implantation into injured neural tissue. The aligned
nanoﬁbrous scaffold showed good host-implant integration with extensive cell
penetration throughout the scaffold and reduced inﬂammatory reaction [87]. With
the help of the nanoﬁbrous scaffold, few cystic cavity formations were observed in
the regenerated spinal cord. Newly regenerated blood vessels were found along the
aligned nanoﬁbers. Histological results showed that the regenerated nerve assisted
by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)(PLGA) /mussel adhesive proteins(MAP)/peptide
nanoﬁbrous scaffold had a properly aligned myelinated axonal structure and similar
regenerated quality to that assisted by autograft (Fig. 8a) [88]. The functional
recovery of the regenerated nerve was also demonstrated. Comparable neuromus-
cular function and recovery from tactile and nociceptive hypersensitivity induced
by incomplete nerve regeneration were observed between the autograft group and
the nanoﬁbrous scaffold group [73, 88–90]. Atrophy of the gastrocnemius muscle
was also reduced at the injured site after regeneration [73, 88]. Sequential release
of multiple growth factors from the nanoﬁbrous scaffold was able to accelerate
the nerve recovery [90]. Additionally, the nanoﬁbrous scaffold showed the ability
to support cell loading and transplantation into the injured site. The cell-loaded
scaffold restored multiple motor functions including toe spreading, walking, and
swimming (Fig. 8b) [91].

Nanoparticles
A nanoparticle (NP) is a microscopic particle with at least one dimension less than
100 nm. Due to the nanosize, the NP presents some peculiar properties such as
optical property induced by quantum conﬁnement, which enables the conversion of
different energies for neuronal excitation and sensation of change in the electrical
ﬁeld and chemicals for neuronal recording. The small size of the NP allows for local
communication with the individual cell or even molecules inside the cell, resulting
in a high selectivity and spatial resolution. These properties open the possibility of
using NPs for remote modulation and monitoring of cellular activity in the nervous
system with minimal invasiveness.
Nanoparticles exhibited promising performances in the modulation of neural
activity with optogenetics. 20 nm spherical AuNPs were employed to serve as
light-to-heat transducers for optical stimulation of neurons. With the NPs located
in close proximity to the neuronal membrane, the delivery of millisecond pulses of
laser light was able to induce the depolarization of the DRG neuron and initiate

action potentials [92]. To achieve tight and targeted binding to the cell membrane
and improve the resistance to convective washout, the AuNP was functionalized
with neurotoxin Ts1 or antibody. Neuronal activity excited by functionalized AuNP
was demonstrated in mouse hippocampal slices (Fig. 9a) [93]. The modiﬁed AuNP
allowed repetitive photothermal stimulation with low delivered energy and negligi-
ble cellular damage. The core/shell (NaYbF4:Tm3 + 0.5%)@NaYF4 upconversion
nanoparticle (UCNP) enabled intracellular conversion of tissue-penetrating, NIR

UCNP anchored on retinal photoreceptors also showed the ability to create NIR
light image vision in the mouse, which was originally unavailable in mammals
through the conversion of photons from low-energy to high-energy forms (Fig. 9b)
[95]. Results showed that the mouse injected with the UCNP was sensitive to
different sophisticated NIR shape patterns and the obtained NIR light pattern
vision was compatible with normal daylight vision. Additionally, some NPs display

speciﬁc size-dependent properties such as superparamagnetism [47], which may
allow multiple modulation of neural activity. For example, superparamagnetic ferrite
nanoparticles heated by the magnetic ﬁeld allowed remote activation of temperature-
sensitive ion channels in neurons [96].
Studies were also conducted on the investigation and application of nanoparticles
for recording and imaging of neural activity. Ultrabright quantum dots showed
the ability to monitor the voltage dynamics of groups of neurons during neuronal
spiking with millisecond precision through a substantial change in ﬂuorescence

intensity (Fig. 10a) [97]. The detection of the neurotransmitter dopamine based
on an AuNP-coated electrode exhibited high sensitivity (SNR = 3), fast response
time (<2 s), and low detection limit (7 nM). With the AuNP, real-time in vivo
detection of dopamine release evoked by electrical stimulation was achieved in
the striatum of rats [98]. Rare-earth-doped NPs were explored for photoacoustic
imaging of brain tumors due to their tunable ﬂuorescence and high SNR under NIR
excitation [99]. UCNP showed the ability to track intra-axonal retrograde transport
and cytoplasmic dynein speed of movement in the neuron, and its application did
not compromise the viability of neurons (Fig. 10b) [100]. The in situ tracking of
retrograde transport neurons may ﬁnd promising application in brain imaging and
diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases at the early stage.

Future Directions and Conclusions
Nanostructured platforms including manipulation of nanomaterials and patterning
of nanostructures have been proved to be promising ways to modulate and/or
monitor neural signals for diagnosis and therapy of nervous system injury and
disease. However, the design of the nanostructured platform has yet to be perfected.
Nanoelectronics were demonstrated to successfully interface with the nervous
system with high efﬁcacy and low invasiveness. Although one dimension of the
neural electrode site can be achieved at the nanoscale, the overall size of the
electrode site remained large when compared to the cellular subunit of the neural
cells, which results in limited selectivity in modulation and recording of neural
activity at the single cell level, cellular subunit, or even molecular level. Future
studies should be conducted on reduction of the electrode site’s size into the
nanoscale. Additionally, nanomaterials with multiple functions should be employed
to enable targeted interaction and modulation with different neural cells. Low

invasiveness during implantation and modulation is also an important future direc-
tion for nanoelectronics in neural applications.
Tissue-engineered nanoﬁbrous scaffold shows promising results in neural regen-
eration, but the scaffold remains in early-stage research and feasibility demon-
stration. Repair of large injured sites (e.g., nerve gap>3 cm) remains a challenge.
A future direction should be functionalization of the nanoﬁbrous scaffold with
different cues to induce satisﬁed healing. The combination of the nanoﬁbrous
scaffold with cell transplantation therapy should be further explored regarding
the manipulation of transplanted cells inside the scaffold and safety issues such
as foreign body reaction. Less invasive implantation of the nanoﬁbrous scaffold
through injection and targeted delivery to the injured site needs to be investigated in
the future.
NPs were found to be a highly promising platform to interface with the nervous
system through multiple modalities such as optogenetics and electrochemical
reaction. Future studies should be conducted on the improvement of the targeted
delivery of the NP to individual neural cells and cellular subunits. The chronic in
vivo biocompatibility of the nanoparticles also should be paid attention to.
Although great achievements were obtained in nanostructured platform interfac-
ing with the nervous system, these platforms remain in the research stage and have
not been translated into clinical study. Nanoﬁbrous scaffolds have been clinically
evaluated for wound dressing and regenerative endodontics, but they have not
been translated for neural regeneration. The barrier to translation would be the
comprehensive evaluation of the safety and efﬁcacy of the platforms, which is one
of the most important directions of future study.
