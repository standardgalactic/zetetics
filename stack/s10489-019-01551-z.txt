Abstract
Noise leads to the ambiguity in regions of interest detection by corrupting the pixel information and is a vital problem in
image processing domain. A novel hybrid technique based on fuzzy filtering and fuzzy thresholding is proposed here to
extract the object regions accurately in presence of Gaussian noises. The proposed method is automated, does not need any
parameter tuning as well does not need prior knowledge of the image or noise. An asymmetrical triangular fuzzy filter with
median center coupled with a thresholding based on fuzziness minimization technique are implemented for this purpose.
The fuzzy thresholding technique helps to classify the pixels with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) caused either due to noise
or by the application of noise removal process. The proposed technique is applied in benchmark images corrupted by noises
and are compared with some of the popular algorithms of object detection. The results indicate that the proposed method
has superior performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean square error (MSE) value for images
corrupted with Gaussian noises with standard deviation upto 1.5.

1 Introduction
Detection
and extraction of the object of interest (OoI)
or region of interest (RoI) from images are challenging
tasks, especially in the presence of noise. The complexity
of the problem gets increased while dealing with natural or
remote sensing images because of the presence of noise.
The images are mostly encountered with Gaussian noise,
salt and pepper or impulse noise, speckle noise, Poisson
noise, and structured noise. The existence of noise distorts
the actual image information by introducing additional
unwanted signals in the image. This leads to blurring of the

object, and vagueness in the corners and edges of the object.
In general, the problem becomes all the more complicated
as real images are usually in gray-scale, and the difference
between object and background is very small, which often
gets mixed-up due to the presence of noise.
There exists two broad methodologies for segmenting
out RoI from the region of the images encountered with
low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). One method is through
implementation of the segmentation technique directly on
the noisy images, while the other is to pre-process the
image and then implement the segmentation algorithm [24].
Some of the most popular techniques are threshold based
segmentation [47, 51], clustering based segmentation [17,
23], fuzzy clustering based technique [57], region based
methods [42], Neural Network based method [1], grow
cut based segmentation [19], active contour model [61],
watershed model [11], Markov Random Field (MRF) model
[5], etc. In the recent past, few more techniques, such as
Chan-Vese active contour model [22, 43], Fuzzy energy
based active contour model [36], two-dimension (2D)
Otsu’s thresholding [30], and superpixel based segmentation
method [31, 39] have been developed for the segmentation
purpose. Among these, most are not suited for segmentation
of noisy images, while some are robust to the noisy

environment [48]. Moreover, these methods are capable of
producing the desire output only for high values of SNR
[24].
There exists various state-of-the-art methodologies for
segmenting out RoI from low SNR images by applying
de-noising followed by segmentation algorithm[4, 24, 45].
Some of these techniques are a combination of; bilateral
filter, superimposing technique and Otsu’s thresholding
[45], average filtering and gradient based thresholding
[44], double mean filtering and Otsu’s thresholding [46],
guided filter and fuzzy clustering [24], etc. For de-
noising purposes, Gaussian filter [16], Kalman filter [12],
Wiener filter [6], averaging filter technique [50, 51],
and median filter [21] are being widely used. Recent
techniques like, artificial neural network based methods
[18, 58], fuzzy based methods [38], clustering based
techniques [15] and wavelet transform [6] have also
been proposed for image de-noising. However, these
noise removal methods sometimes lead to vital infor-
mation loss during image pre-processing step [24].
The majority of the existing methods require manual
intervention either in parameter tuning or contour initial-
ization. Some of the methods like machine learning based
models also need prior training data sets. The aim of this
paper is to introduce a hybrid method which is fully auto-
mated and does not require any prior knowledge. Here, we
focus only on one type of noise, i.e. Gaussian noise which
is one of the most commonly encountered noises in remote
sensing images. The main reason behind the occurrence
of this noise is the distortion in signal level during the
transmission of data as well as the variation in illumina-
tion (https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/noise.htm,

ppt). Here we propose a hybrid fuzzy based filtering and
thresholding (FFFT) technique to handle the high Gaussian
noise for image segmentation purpose in low SNR region.
The fuzzy concept is introduced to handle the ambiguity
of the pixels due to low SNR values. On the other hand,
thesholding based technique has been used for its simplicity
and time efficiency. The results of the proposed method
has been compared with heuristic combination of various
state-of-the-art de-noising methods and Otsu’s or fuzzy
thresholding, and recently developed image segmentation
techniques. The main contributions of this article are:
–
Integration of fuzzy theory simultaneously for both
image de-noising and object detection tasks.
–
The development of the fully automated FFFT tech-
nique for image segmentation in low SNR images.
–
Establishment of heuristically combined method of
different noise removal techniques and thresholding
based segmentation technique.
The proposed technique has been tested on a few syn-
thetic and real benchmark data sets, and the results have
been compared with other existing techniques of image
segmentation like 2D Otsu’s thresholding [30], superpixel-
based fast fuzzy C-means clustering (SFFCM) [39], mod-
ified Otsu-based image segmentation algorithm (OBISA)
[59], Region-based active contour model driven by fuzzy
c-means (RACMFCM) [32], and with heuristically inte-
grated segmentation techniques (Otsu’s/fuzzy thresholding)
along with different noise filters such as; recursive filtering
(RF) [10], statistical nearest-neighbor (SNN) method [20],
super-resolution convolutional neural network technique
(SRCNN) [18], Gaussian/bilateral filtering and method
noise thresholding (G/BFMT) [53], guided filter and fuzzy
clustering (GF-FCM) [24].
The overall flow of the paper is as follows: the related
work on noise removal and object detection have been
discussed in Section 2 of this paper. Section 3 discusses
the proposed techniques. Results and discussions have been
given in Section 4. Section 5 provides the overall conclusion
and future scope of the work.
2 Related work on object detection in noisy
image
The methods associated with noisy image segmentation
can be broadly classified into two groups namely; noise
removal in pre-processing followed by segmentation and
direct segmentation techniques. A brief detail of these
processes are outlined in the following subsections.
2.1 Noise removal techniques
Gaussian filtering based image de-noising [16] is widely
used for the removal of Gaussian noise. The filtering algo-
rithm involves convolution operation. Here the convolution
operation is performed directly between the image pixel and
Gaussian function, as a output de-noised image is obtained.
The filter perform like a low pass filter while performing
the noise removal operation. During the process their is a
chance that most of the noisy pixels remained in the image
after the first convolution operation of the image with that
of the Gaussian function [41].
In order to overcome this limitation of classical Gaussian
filter, an iterative Gaussian filtering had been induced for
the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) purpose [41]. In
this iterative filtering operation the resultant image obtained
from the Gaussian filtering operation is again pass through
the convolution operation using the Gaussian function for
certain number of iteration repetitively. In-spite of several

advantages, Gaussian based filtering technique has few
drawbacks. The filter blurs out (degrade the resolution) the
image in order to reduce the effect of noise. Additionally,
it often vanishes the edge information as well give rises
to the phantom edge [16]. Moreover, the performance of
Gaussian filter depends on the value of variance (σ) used in
Gaussian function and the determination of σ value requires
a supervised approach. Human supervision is also needed
for the determination of numbers of iteration for performing
iterative filtering operation.
Gaussian/bilateral filtering and method noise threshold-
ing (G/BFMT) using wavelets had been proposed by Kumar
[53] in-order to handle the drawback of classical Gaussian
or bilateral filter of noise removal. The bilateral filter can
store the edge information, but often remove some image
details. In order to restore the image details from the method
noise, Kumar [53] had introduced wavelet thresholding
technique, where method noise had been transformed into
wavelet domain. The accuracy of the method also depends
on proper selection of noise variance.
Mean filter [50] is another filter for such purpose, but
perform very poorly when there is a huge variation of pixel
values present in the window under consideration.
Kalman filter based on recursive algorithm is also used
for image de-noising. The filter is an optimal estimator and
has the capability to handle all the uncertainties related with
noisy image. Parameter setting is a critical issue in Kalman
filter based technique[12]. The outcome varies widely if the
input parameters given are not adequate.
The fast and robust recursive filter (RF) had been used
for the image de-noising in order to reduce the complexity
of the noise removal algorithm [10]. In this method, the
de-noised output from modified 1st-order and 3rd-order
recursive filter (RF) had been fused based on Stein’s
Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE) [54]. The outcome from
recursive filter based de-noising method had been compared
with the results of BM3D [13], Non-Local-Means (NLM)
[7], 1st-order-RF and 3rd-order-RF. Although the method
outperform in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),
but it is having longer run-time [10]. A statistical approach
based wiener filter has also been proposed for image de-
noising [37]. The filter use the parameters like mean,
standard deviation for noise detection and removing. This
filter also smooth out the image, which in turn results in
information loss of the image.
Traditional Non-Local-Means (NLM) of image de-
noising algorithm involve three vital steps for removing
noise from the image [8, 20]. These are, identification
of neighbors for each patch, averaging neighbors and
aggregation of de-noised patches [20]. In order to reduce
the error in prediction of noise free patch and to
overcome the bias due to nearest-neighbors search strategy,
Frosioand and Kautz [20] had introduced statistical nearest-
neighbors (SNN) searching algorithm. The method aims
in gathering neighbors which has squared distance close
to its expectation with respect to the reference patch. An
offset parameter used to force the algorithm to move from
traditional nearest-neighbors to SNN based technique. The
method leads to improvement of image quality also for the
case of bilateral filtering, along-side the method is effective
for the homogeneous region in an image [20]. The results
from the technique had been compared with those of BM3D
[13], BM3D-CFA [14], sliding discrete cosine transform
filter (SDCT) [63] and traditional nearest-neighbors based
algorithm.
Various version of the neural network (NN) based
technique had also been used for removal of noise from
the image. One of the most simpler versions of NN
based de-noising technique had been implemented by
Ohana
(https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/∼ben-shahar/Teaching/
Computational-Vision/StudentProjects/ICBV071/
ICBV-2007-1-ArieOhana/index.php). The method intro-
duced with single hidden layer along with input and output
layers. The overall structure of the network 10-50-1. In the
very first layer input from the pixel of the noisy image is
feed into one neuron of the input layer, while the other neu-
ron is feed with the pixel intensity from the same coordinate
of the source image. Pixels intensity of 8 neighbors of the
considered pixel is feed into rest of the neuron of the input
layer. The weighted sum of the output received from the
middle layer is being calculated in a single neuron present
in the last layer of the network to generate the de-noised
result. In the work, sigmoid function had been used. The
method require additional supply of original image as a
training set.
Turkmen [58] in recent past had introduced the artificial
neural network based method for removal of random valued
impulse noise from the image. The method showed its
promising capability to remove noise compared to the other
algorithms, but, require more computational time[58].

Network
(SRCNN) a deep neural network (DNN) based algorithm
had been implemented [18]. The method involves three
main operational parts. These are patch extraction and
representation, non-linear mapping and reconstruction. The
overall performance of the CNN depends on the proper
optimization of biases and filtering weight as-well-as on
training strategies of the network. Sparse coding-based

regression method [55], adjusted anchored neighbourhood
regression method [56] and KK- the method [34], used for
comparison with SRCNN.
Among fuzzy based noise removal techniques, the sym-
metrical triangular fuzzy filter with median center (TMED),
Gaussian fuzzy filter with median center (GMED), Gaus-
sian fuzzy filter with moving average center (GMAV),
asymmetrical triangular fuzzy filter with median center
(ATFFMED) [38], the symmetrical triangular fuzzy filter
with moving average center (TMAV), decreasing weight
fuzzy filter with moving average center (DWMAV), and
asymmetrical triangular fuzzy filter with moving average
center (ATMAV) had been implemented by Kwan [38].
These filters were found to be capable of handling Gaussian
noise with a maximum variance of 0.106 [38].
Fuzzy filter had also been used by Peng and Lucke [49]
for the removal of noise mixed with Gaussian noise as
well as impulsive noise. Here in the work [49], the authors
had used non-linear fuzzy filter for filtering purpose,
However, the method is a supervised technique where fuzzy
membership had been trained with local features for noise
removal task.
Ville et al. [60] had also used fuzzy filter for noise
removal. The authors in the paper [60] had implemented
fuzzy derivative for additive noise filtering.
Recently, Median filter with decision based model has
been used for filtering noise from highly affected images
[33]. In the work FPGA set up and strives has been
implemented in order to remove impulse noise from the
image with less computation time. The method shows
its promising results compared to the output obtained
from standard median filtering (SMF) and adaptive median
filtering (AMF).
2.2 Segmentation techniques
Otsu’s thresholding based segmentation [47] is one of
the popular methods. This technique aims to partition
the image into foreground and background based on the
maximization of inter-class variance. Although being one
of the simplest image segmentation technique, it shows its
limitation in segmentation for a low value of inter-class
variance. Alongside, the method alone is not robust to noise.
Classical Otsu’s thresholding method [47] does not
consider the intensity values of the neighboring pixels [30].
2D Otsu’s thresholding was introduced by Jianzhuang et al.
[30] in order to overcome the drawback of classical Otsu’s
thresholding based segmentation. The method used the
concept of averaging filter, where the mean value of the
neighborhood pixels has been taken along with the gray-
level intensity values to calculate the thresholds. Another
advantage of 2D Otsu’s thresholding method is that the
technique is capable of withstanding Gaussian noise.
A modified Otsu-based image segmentation algorithm
(OBISA) had been introduced, which replace the variance
formula with standard deviation for the computation of
optimal threshold [59]. The method is capable to set
reasonable threshold value by removing the outliers, but
computationally-expensive compared to classical Otsu’s
method.
Recently, active contours driven by non-local Gaussian
distribution fitting (NLGDF) energy had been proposed for
image segmentation by Li et al. [40]. The model uses patch
level information to describe each local image region. The
model outperforms the local Gaussian distribution fitting
(LGDF) model in segmenting images in presence of heavy
noises. A level set formulation of the NLGDF energy
had been used by representing the image regions. Then
variational methods was incorporated to solve the energy
minimization problem. Contour initialization is a major
problem in this method. The contour needed to be initialize
on the object in the image.
Global and local weighted signed pressure force (SPF)
based active contour model had also been used for
segmenting images [25]. Here, first, a new global weighted
SPF (GWSPF) had been defined. Second, a new local
weighted SPF (LWSPF) was introduced to the above global
weighted SPF. Third, the local and global within-class
variances of the image are used to weight the GWSPF
and the LWSPF. The model is robust to the initial curve.
However, it depends on the image gray-scale information to
control the contour evolution.
A fractional order derivative based active contour model
based segmentation had been introduced by Chen et al. [9].
The method incorporates image gradient, local environment
and global information for this purpose. The Energy or
level set functions in this method include both global
term and local term. The global term aims to enhance the
image contrast, while local term integrates fractional order
differentiation. The model is robust to noisy image and
capable for inhomogeneous image segmentation. However,
it is not suitable for uneven illuminated image segmentation.
In addition, the method suffer from the problem of
parameters selection.
Fuzzy energy based active contour model for image
segmentation [36] is one of the techniques which can
directly be applied to noisy images. In this technique, the
fuzzy membership values determine the object region in the
image.
Region-based active contour model driven by fuzzy c-
means (RACMFCM) energy had been implemented for fast
image segmentation [32]. The method used fuzzy c-means
energy to rapidly compute the two sorts of cluster center
functions for all points in the image. These two functions are
used to substitute the time-consuming local fitting functions
in traditional models. Moreover, a Gaussian filtering and

a sign function are used to supplant the length term and
the penalty term in most models, respectively. The model
is robust to contour initialization and noise, and segment
intensity inhomogeneous image with higher accuracy and
faster rate. But, it is only applicable for segmenting two-
phase images.
Classical fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) [3] aims in
segmenting the image by minimizing the objective function.
Despite several advantages, the method is very sensitive to
noise as the neighborhood pixel information is not taken
into account while segmenting an image. Moreover, the
FCM algorithm has a high computational complexity, since
it calculates the distance between clusters center and each
of the pixels present in the image [39].
In order to overcome the mentioned drawback of
FCM, Lei et al. [39] had introduced SFFCM for image
segmentation. The method reduces the complexity of FCM
by considering histogram of superpixel images, which
is quite less in number as compared to a number of
pixels present in the image. The superpixel images had
been obtained using the watershed transform based on
multiscale morphological gradient reconstruction (MMGR-
WT) [39]. The algorithm is suitable for fast segmentation
of color image, but it require prior information about the
cluster number like other k-means clustering algorithms, for
practical applications.
Recently Jin [31] had proposed a super pixel segmen-
tation method for removal of impulse noise from a color
image. A recursive vector median filter with adaptive win-
dow sizes had been taken into account for the task of object
detection in the noisy image [31].
Zho et al., [64] had introduced multiobjective evolu-
tionary clustering based image segmentation algorithm for
segmentation of noisy image. The work used a noise robust
IFS (NR-IFS) followed by a novel noise robust multiob-
jective evolutionary intuitionistic fuzzy clustering algorithm
(NR-MOEIFC). In the work, firstly a three-parameter intu-
itionistic fuzzy distance measure is computed and secondly
intuitionistic fuzzy fitness functions is constructed. Then a
nonuniform intuitionistic fuzzy mutation operator is devel-
oped for generation of an intuitionistic fuzzy cluster validity
index. This is then used to select the optimized solution
from the final non dominated solution set [64]. The method
outperform other state-of-the-art methods in noise robust-
ness and computational time. However, finding of the exact
Pareto optimal solution and the cluster number is the major
limitation of this method.
Modified moth-flame based optimization algorithm had
been also used for the multilevel thresholding segmentation
of an image by Jia et al. [28]. The method involve two
innovative strategies to segment an image. On one hand,
self-adaptive inertia weight scheme is used for enhancing
both exploitation and exploration, on the other hand, a
heuristic thresholding (TH) is incorporated into moth-flame
optimization (MFO) to improve the overall performance
of multilevel thresholding. Otsu’s variance, and Kapur’s
entropy criteria are employed as fitness functions to find
the optimal threshold values of an image. The method has
outperformed in terms of stability, efficiency, accuracy, and
convergence rate.

implemented for image segmentation [29]. It also takes the
Otsu or Kapur’s entropy as the objective function to find the
optimal threshold of image segmentation. It shows better
robustness on noise for large value of PSNR in cost of time
complexity.
3 Proposed FFFT technique for object
detection
In this work a hybrid fuzzy filtering and fuzzy thresholding
(FFFT) based methodology has been proposed. The
technique has been implemented in order to segment the
noisy image withstanding the blurring effect caused by the
filtering techniques. The technique works in two steps, first
fuzzy filtering technique is used for generating the de-
noised image and, next the segmentation task is done on
the de-noised image using a fuzzy thresholding method.
An asymmetrical triangular fuzzy filter with median center
(ATFFMED) has been used for removing noise from the
image [38].
The asymmetrical triangular fuzzy filter with median
center (ATFFMED) filter compromise of a hybrid combina-
tion of median noise filter with the notion of fuzzy logic.
The median filter is a non-linear filter, which carry for-
ward the task of image de-noising in two steps [52]. In
the first step, the filter carry out clustering function, where
it performs the clustering of corrupted and non-corrupted
pixels. After the clustering, in the second step, the filter
pass through the noisy pixels and restrain uncorrupted pix-
els in the image. These corrupted pixels are being removed
from the image based on the median value. The overall
formulation of the classical median filter is given by;
J(x, y) = median {I(x −p, y −q) | (p, q) ∈W} .
(1)
In (1), J and I are the output (de-noised) and the input
(noisy) images, where x and y are their spatial co-ordinates
along x and y axis respectively. The term W represents the
filtering window (square window) of size K ×K and length
Len = 2K + 1, with it center co-ordinates at (p, q).
The main advantage of the median filter is to retain
the edge information while filtering out the noisy pixels
present in the image [52], however, often eliminates corners
and thin lines [35]. Moreover, it generates undesired results
for signal dependent noises [35]. In order to preserve the
fine structure in the image and to handle the vagueness
associated with the classification of the noisy pixel, the
fuzzy concept had been introduced [52]. Where the median
value has been determined based on the value of the center
pixel of the window. The output value of the fuzzy based
median filter is estimated by;
J(x, y) =

(p,q)∈W
μ(x + p, y + q).I(x + p, y + q)

(p,q)∈W
μ(x + p, y + q)
.
(2)
The term μ represents fuzzy membership values, where the
asymmetrical triangular function is considered to represent
the membership values. The membership value μ is
calculated as given in (3):
μ(x, y) =
⎧
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩
1−Imed(x,y)−I(x+p,y+q)

1−I(x+p,y+q)−Imed(x,y)

1
for Imed(x, y) −Imin(x, y) = 0
or Imax(x, y) −Imed(x, y) = 0.
(3)
Where, the terms Imed(x, y), Imin(x, y) and Imax(x, y)
represent the median, minimum and maximum value of
intensity present in the particular window of the filter for
input of I(x+p, y+q). The asymmetric triangular function
has the advantage of reduction in fuzziness and increased
accuracy level of decision making or prediction [2].
The advantage of image segmentation based on fuzzy
thresholding is that it can handle the problem associated
with the overlapping of two classes which are often
encountered in de-noised images. Particularly, the pixels
near object boundaries often become ambiguous during the
de-noising process. In the present work, fuzzy thresholding
technique, proposed by Huang and Wang [27], has
been used for its simplicity and less computational time
requirement.
The threshold value has been estimated based on the
optimization function for de-noised image J of size M × N
and had been defined as:
E(T ) = −

Se = −μJ lnμJ −(1 −μJ )ln(1 −μJ ).

The entropy function had been used as a cost function,
which decreases as the fuzziness of the image pixels

reduces. The term μJ in (4) and (5) denotes the membership
function which is given by;
μJ (J(x, y)) =

1 −|J(x, y) −m1(T )|/D if J(x, y) ≤T
1
1 −|J(x, y) −m2(T )|/D if J(x, y) > T .
(6)
In the (6) D is a constant which is given by,
D = Jmax(x, y) −Jmin(x, y);
(7)
where Jmax(x, y) and Jmin(x, y) are the maximum and
minimum gray levels intensity present in the de-noised
image respectively. And the terms m1 and m2 are the
average gray level pixels present in two classes determined
based on the initial threshold value T . The terms m1 and m2
are denoted as;
m1 =

and
m2 =
Jmax(x,y)

i=T +1
ini
Jmax(x,y)

i=T +1
ni
.
(9)
The term i in (8) and (9) represents the intensity levels
present in the de-noised image and ni represents the number
of occurrences of the pixels with the intensity value i in
the image. Since here the target is to determine the final
threshold value Tth based on the optimization function, thus
the value of T for which the function given in (4) generate
the lowest values is considered as the final threshold value.
Thus, the final threshold value Tth is obtained by the
equation as given in (10).
Tth = arg
min
0≤T ≤Jmax(x,y) E(T ).
(10)
Finally, the segmented de-noise image is given by;
Is(x, y) =
 1 if J(x, y) ≥Tth
0 if J(x, y) < Tth.

The proposed technique has been illustrated in Algorithm 1.

The proposed FFFT technique has been tested on ten
different types of examples (Fig. 1). Zero mean Gaussian
noise with systematically increased σ (standard deviation)
has been induced in the original images. The corresponding
outcome obtained after applying the proposed technique has
been compared with other state-of-the-art methodologies
and a few heuristically developed methods, in terms of both
visual and quantitative analysis. The corresponding noisy

dataset.4 The dataset used is shown in Fig. 1.
Among the shown dataset, the first two examples are
synthetic images. These two (Figs. 1a and b) are MATLAB
generated image of circles. The image of the coin (shown in
Fig. 1c) present in MATLAB built-in dataset have also been
considered for the experimentation purpose.
The complexity of the data sets has been increased
gradually. The first data c3 in Fig. 1a, consists of three
circles with a little variation of gray level intensity.
Similarly, Figs. 1b contains 5 circles of different radius,
along with two overlapping circles in each of them. The
image Fig. 1c consists of a set of coins with a huge variation
in the gray-scale level. The rest images in Fig. 1 are the
color images. Images used for the experiment are having the
maximum resolution of 400 × 320 pixels, while minimun
image size used for the experiment is having resolution of
128 × 96 pixels.

procedure, methodologies have been divided into three
groups, namely; Gaussian filter based techniques, machine-
learning (ML) based techniques and direct segmentation
technique.

The Gaussian-based techniques explicitly incorporate
Gaussian function in the process of noise removal followed
by Otsu’s or fuzzy thresholding. Following combinations
are formed, (1) Gaussian noise filtering and Otsu’s
thresholding method (Gaussian-Otsu), (2) Gaussian noise

filtering and fuzzy thresholding method (Gaussian-Fuzzy),
(3) Iterative Gaussian noise filtering and Otsu’s thresholding
method (Iterative Gaussian-Otsu), (4) Iterative Gaussian
noise filtering and fuzzy thresholding method (Iterative
Gaussian-Fuzzy) and (5) G/BFMT and Otsu’s thresholding
technique (G/BFMT-Otsu).
On the other-hand. (1) RF and Otsu’s thresholding (RF-
Otsu), (2) SNN and Otsu’s thresholding (SNN-Otsu), (3)
NN and Otsu’s thresholding (NN-Otsu), (4) SRCNN and
Otsu’s thresholding (SRCNN-Otsu) and, (5) guided filter
and fuzzy clustering (GF-FCM) have been classified into
ML based technique.
In addition, methods which directly operate on the noisy
image and segment out the RoI, such as (5) 2D Otsu’s
thresholding, (6) SFFCM, (7) OBISA and (6) RACMFCM
have been included in third group.
4.3 Visual analysis
The results are shown in Figs. 2–31. In the Figs. 2–31,
the first row indicates the original noisy images obtained
for different σ values and the very next row contains the
corresponding ground-truth images. The last row shows the
outputs obtained using the proposed technique. The results
generated using other methods have been shown in between
the second and last rows of the figures.
Comparisons with Gaussian filter based techniques have
been shown in the Figs. 2–11, machine learning based

Fig. 32 MSE graph of output obtained using different methods for
different values of σ and σIN 2 for mentioned images
techniques have been shown in Figs. 12–21 and Figs. 22–
31 indicates the results obtained from direct segmentation
techniques.
From the figures, it can be seen that the proposed
technique is showing promising performance in object
detection in presence of high amount of Gaussian noise.
Only iterative Gaussian with fuzzy thresholding shows
similar performance to that of the proposed technique in
presence of high noise.
The figure indicates the important role of noise removal
in accurate object detection as both fuzzy and Otsu perform
similar way while Gaussian filtering is used. However,
fuzzy based segmentation performs much better than Otsu’s
method when the iterative Gaussian filter is used to
remove the noise. The fuzzy method able to extract the
useful information from de-noised image withstanding the
significant blurring effect due to multiple iterations.
The proposed FFFT technique has segmented out most
part of the objects from noisy image better compared to the
other discussed methods. The main reason behind this is the
combined advantage of ATFFMED and fuzzy thresholding.
The first helps in eliminating the noise from the image
while retaining the maximum details and, the second one
helps in generating the segmented output by reducing
the misclassification probability using fuzzy membership
function. From the images shown Figs. 22-31, it can be
noted that RACMFCM method is also show good results in
extraction of RoI from noisy images. However, it can also
be noted from Figs. 32 and 33 that RACMFCM technique
performs poorer than the proposed techniques for some of
the images. The main reasons behind this mis-classification
are; first, the performance of the method in detecting RoI
depends on contour initialization, and second, the evolution
of contour in this method depends on mean values of
foreground and background pixels initially generated using
FCM,and does not change for rest of the iteration.
4.4 Quantitative analysis
The results have also been compared quantitatively for
verifying the performance of the proposed technique.
Performance of the proposed technique, the existing
methods and heuristically developed techniques have been
measured in terms of PSNR and MSE for different
values of σ and corresponding total image variance after
addition of noise σIN 2 ; where the MSE and PSNR have
been calculated by the equations given in (12) and (13)
respectively.

In the above (12) the term Ig(x, y) denotes original ground-
truth image. The segmented de-noised image has been
compared with ground truth to generate MSE value. And the
term MFL indicates the maximum fluctuation level present
in the image. For this case, its value has been considered -3
equal to 255 as the ground-truth images are 8-bit images.
As an example, the MSE and PSNR values obtained for
different de-noised object detection algorithms is given in
Tables 1, 2 and 3 for de-noised coin image, where bold
symbol indicates the methods having the lowest MSE and
PSNR values for a particular value of standard deviation.
The comparisons of the proposed technique with other
algorithms have been shown in Figs. 32 and 33.
From the Figs. 32iii–a and iii–b and the data stated
in Tables 1 and 2, it can be concluded that the proposed
technique shows lower MSE value for the noisy images
with high σ values in comparison to other heuristically
developed techniques and ML based techniques. This fact
also holds true for the other cases as well as shown in
Figs. 32 and 33. However, it should be noted that some of
the existing techniques as well as heuristically developed
methods performs better than the proposed techniques for
specific images, such as NN-Otsu performs better in case of
horse2 while SFFCM performs better in case of images like
flower, sunflower and horse2. The G/BFMT-Otsu technique
is also found to perform better than the FFFT technique
for low σ values at some of the images. In other cases the
performances of the proposed model are similar or better to
the other existing as well as heuristically developed methods
for low σ values as well. The possible reason for obtaining
better results in SFFCM than proposed technique is due to
the presence of single object in the image. The performance
of proposed technique is always higher than SFFCM when
the image contains multiple objects. The performance of
NN-Otsu, however, depends strongly on the training dataset.
Since the same trained network is used in all of the study
cases, the good performances in only in few cases indicate
this fact. This is, in fact, one of the major issues in
any neural network based algorithms. The performance of
G/BFMT-Otsu depends on the variance of the filter as well
as pixel intensity in image, hence perform better than the
proposed technique only for low noise cases. The parameter
tuning is one of the important aspect of this method. On
the other hand, though the performance of RACMFCM
is good in comparison to the proposed technique, it
requires manual intervention in initializing the contours.
Considering the fact that the proposed FFFT technique
does not require human interaction (like in contour based
method), or parameter tuning (like in Gaussian filters) as
well no a-priory knowledge of the noise (like in NN based
techniques), the results are quite satisfactory.

5 Conclusions
The work proposed a hybrid fuzzy filtering and fuzzy
thresholding (FFFT) technique in detection and extraction
of the object present in the noisy image. The technique is
fully automated and no human interaction is required as in
case of contour based technique. The output obtained using
the proposed technique have been compared with other
existing algorithms and heuristically developed algorithms
for eight test images with varied level of σ values. It can
be concluded that the proposed technique is capable of
generating better output with high PSNR value and low
MSE rate for Gaussian noise with high values of standard
deviation compared to the most of the stated algorithms.
Moreover, the method does not require the parameter tuning
like Gaussian based techniques and prior information like
neural network based methodologies for detection of RoI.
However, it has been found that the algorithm results in
high MSE rate for the low values of σ. In the future
work, it will be in focus to handle this very limitation of
the proposed technique. Applying the proposed algorithm
on more realistic images such as remote sensing images,
medical images, and astronomical images will be in the
target for future work.
